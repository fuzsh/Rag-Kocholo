In mild to moderate blepharospasm cases, the spectacle-supported prosthesis can still produce satisfactory results. However, in moderate to severe blepharospasm, the force of the spasm moves the entire device forward and downward, making it ineffective or too uncomfortable to wear. To create greater stability and a more effective counterforce to the blepharospasm, the author has developed a simple headband-supported device which does not use a spectacle frame for support. This new prosthesis is constructed of varying diameters of spring tempered diamond drawn stainless steel orthodontic wire, partially or completely covered by Teflon tubing. A silicon rubber cylinder is placed over the center which becomes a bridge and the main support for the device. An elastic head band completes the prosthesis.\n\nSigns of essential blepharospasm: a motion-picture analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nColes, W H\n\n1977-06-01\n\nMotion pictures of 15 patients with essential blepharospasm were studied. Previously unrecognized signs indicated multiple cranial nerve involvement. These signs include impersistence of gaze, lid retraction, tongue thrust, head tilts, head jerks, vertical gaze spasms, and asymmetry. The sugns were also observed in a patient with bilateral blepharospasm who had a history of Bell's palsy suggesting facial nerve injury as a possible factor in blepharospasm. The presence of these signs can be explained by known neural pathways, but the site, or sites, of the lesion remains obscure. These signs may be important in assessing severity and in treatment evaluation.\n\nGlucose hypermetabolism in the thalamus of patients with drug-induced blepharospasm.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuzuki, Y; Kiyosawa, M; Wakakura, M; Mochizuki, M; Ishiwata, K; Oda, K; Ishii, K\n\n2014-03-28\n\nWe examined the difference in cerebral function alterations between drug-induced blepharospasm patients and essential blepharospasm (EB) patients by using positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Cerebral glucose metabolism was examined in 21 patients with drug-induced blepharospasm (5 men and 16 women; mean age, 53.1 [range, 29-78] years), 21 essential EB patients (5 men and 16 women; mean age, 53.0 [range, 33-72] years) and 24 healthy subjects (6 men and 18 women; mean age, 57.9 [range, 22-78] years) with long-term history of benzodiazepines use (drug healthy subjects). Drug-induced blepharospasm patients developed symptoms while taking benzodiazepines or thienodiazepines. Sixty-three normal volunteers (15 men and 48 women; mean age, 53.6 [range, 20-70] years) were examined as controls. Differences between the patient groups and control group were examined by statistical parametric mapping. Additionally, we defined regions of interests on both sides of the thalamus, caudate nucleus, anterior putamen, posterior putamen and primary somatosensory area. The differences between groups were tested using two-sample t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Cerebral glucose hypermetabolism on both side of the thalamus was detected in drug-induced blepharospasm, EB patients and drug healthy subjects by statistical parametric mapping. In the analysis of regions of interest, glucose metabolism in both sides of the thalamus in the drug-induced blepharospasm group was significantly lower than that in the EB group. Moreover, we observed glucose hypermetabolism in the anterior and posterior putamen bilaterally in EB group but not in drug-induced blepharospasm group and drug healthy subjects. Long-term regimens of benzodiazepines or thienodiazepines may cause down-regulation of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. We suggest that the functional brain alteration in drug-induced blepharospasm patients is similar to that in EB patients, and\n\nGenetics Home Reference: benign essential blepharospasm\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... that can be caused by fatigue, stress, or caffeine.

We hypothesize that strong stretching of these mechanoreceptors increases reflex contraction of the orbicularis oculi slow-twitch muscle fibers, resulting in blepharospasm. We examined a 71-year-old man with right blepharospasm and bilateral aponeurosis-disinserted blepharoptosis to determine whether the patient's blepharospasm was worsened by increased trigeminal proprioceptive evocation via stretching of the mechanoreceptors in MÃ¼ller's muscle owing to a 60Â° upward gaze and serrated eyelid closure, and whether local anesthesia of the mechanoreceptors via lidocaine administration to the upper fornix as well as surgical disinsertion of MÃ¼ller's muscle from the tarsus and fixation of the disinserted aponeurosis to the tarsus decreased trigeminal proprioceptive evocation and improved patient's blepharospasm. Before pharmacological desensitization, 60Â° upward gaze and serrated eyelid closure exacerbated the patient's blepharospasm. In contrast, these maneuvers did not worsen his blepharospasm following lidocaine administration. One year after surgical desensitization, the blepharospasm had disappeared and a 60Â° upward gaze did not induce blepharospasm.

High-frequency supraorbital electrical stimulation, asynchronous with the R2 component of the blink reflex, can also induce LTD-like effects on the blink reflex circuit in healthy subjects. Patients with blepharospasm have reduced inhibition of their blink recovery curves; therefore, a LTD-like intervention might normalize the blink reflex recovery (BRR) and have a favorable therapeutic effect. This is a randomized, sham-controlled, observer-blinded prospective study. In 14 blepharospasm patients, we evaluated the effects of high-frequency supraorbital stimulation on three separate treatment days. We applied 28 trains of nine stimuli, 400 Hz, either before or after the R2 or used sham stimulation. The primary outcome was the blink rate, number of spasms rated by a blinded physician and patient rating before, immediately after and 1 hour after stimulation while resting, reading, and talking; secondary outcome was the BRR. Stimulation \"before\" and \"after\" the R2 both showed a similar improvement as sham stimulation in physician rating, but patients felt significantly better with the before condition. Improvement in recovery of the blink reflex was noted only in the before condition. Clinical symptoms differed in the three baseline conditions (resting, reading, and talking). Stimulation before R2 increased inhibition in trigeminal blink reflex circuits in blepharospasm toward normal values and produced subjective, but not objective, improvement. Inhibition of the blink reflex pathway by itself appeared to be insufficient for a useful therapeutic effect.

This prospective and caseâcontrol study recruited 30 consecutive PBS patients and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. After questionnaire assessments of ocular surface disease index (OSDI), Jankovic rating scale, and blepharospasm disability index, all subjects underwent blink rate evaluation, tear film break-up time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), Schirmer test, MG expressibility, meibum quality, MG dropout, and LSCM examination of the MGs. The main LSCM outcomes included the mean MG acinar area and density, orifice diameter, meibum secretion reflectivity, acinar irregularity, and inhomogeneity of interstice and acinar wall. The PBS patients had significantly higher blink rate, higher OSDI and CFS scores, lower TBUT and Schirmer test value, and worse MG expressibility than the controls (All Pâ<â0.05), whereas meibum quality showed no difference (Pâ>â0.05). The PBS patients showed lower values of MG acinar area, orifice diameter and meibum secretion reflectivity, and higher scores of acinar irregularity and inhomogeneity of interstices than the controls (All Pâ<â0.05). For the PBS patients, the severity of blepharospasm evaluated by JCR scale was strong correlated with MG acinar area (Pâ<â0.001), orifice diameter (P = 0.002), meibum secretion reflectivity (P = 0.002), and MG acinar irregularity (P = 0.013). The MG expressibility was significantly correlated to MG acinar area (P = 0.039), orifice diameter (Pâ<â0.001), and MG acinar irregularity (P = 0.014). The OSDI score was moderate correlated with MG acinar irregularity (P = 0.016), whereas the TBUT value was positively correlated with MG acinar area (P = 0.045) and negatively correlated to MG acinar\n\nCranial dystonia, blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm: clinical features and treatment, including the use of botulinum toxin.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKraft, S P; Lang, A E\n\n1988-01-01\n\nBlepharospasm, the most frequent feature of cranial dystonia, and hemifacial spasm are two involuntary movement disorders that affect facial muscles. The cause of blepharospasm and other forms of cranial dystonia is not known. Hemifacial spasm is usually due to compression of the seventh cranial nerve at its exit from the brain stem. Cranial dystonia may result in severe disability. Hemifacial spasm tends to be much less disabling but may cause considerable distress and embarrassment. Patients affected with these disorders are often mistakenly considered to have psychiatric problems. Although the two disorders are quite distinct pathophysiologically, therapy with botulinum toxin has proven very effective in both. We review the clinical features, proposed pathophysiologic features, differential diagnosis and treatment, including the use of botulinum toxin, of cranial dystonia and hemifacial spasm.

From November 2011 to July 2013, 77 BoNT-A injections were performed in 38 patients. Eighteen patients were treated with conventional BoNT-A injections before 2011, and 20 patients were referred to our hospital for unsatisfactory results after a conventional injection technique. We classified the patients by spasm-dominant sites: the lateral orbital area, representing the orbital orbicularis-dominant group (ODG); the glabella, representing the corrugator-dominant group (CDG); and the ptosis, representing the palpebral part of the orbicularis-dominant group (PDG). We increased the injection dose into the spasm-dominant sites of the blepharospasm groups. We assessed subjective symptom scores (functional disability score, FDS) after treatment. This study included 38 patients (26 women, 12 men; mean age, 60.6 Â± 10.9 years). There were 21 patients in the ODG, 10 patients in the CDG, and 7 patients in the PDG. Mean ages were 59.7 Â± 12.6, 59.8 Â± 8.5, and 66.8 Â± 9.0 years, and mean BoNT-A injection dose was 38.8 Â± 11.2, 38.8 Â± 11.2, and 38.8 Â± 10.8 U in each group, respectively (p = 0.44, 0.82 Kruskal-Wallis test). Mean FDS after injection was 1.7 Â± 0.7 in the ODG, 1.4 Â± 0.8 in the CDG, and 1.2 Â± 0.3 in the PDG. There were significant differences in reading and job scale among the three groups. In a comparison between the conventional and individualized injection techniques, there was a significant improvement in mean FDS and in the reading scale in the PDG with the individualized injection technique.

Despite strong evidence for genetic contributions to BSP, progress in the field has been constrained by small cohorts, incomplete penetrance, and late age of onset. Although several genetic etiologies for dystonia have been identified through whole-exome sequencing (WES), none of these are characteristically associated with BSP as a singular or predominant manifestation. We performed WES on 31 subjects from 21 independent pedigrees with BSP. The strongest candidate sequence variants derived from in silico analyses were confirmed with bidirectional Sanger sequencing and subjected to cosegregation analysis. Cosegregating deleterious variants (GRCH37/hg19) in CACNA1A (NM_001127222.1: c.7261_7262delinsGT, p.Pro2421Val), REEP4 (NM_025232.3: c.109C>T, p.Arg37Trp), TOR2A (NM_130459.3: c.568C>T, p.Arg190Cys), and ATP2A3 (NM_005173.3: c.1966C>T, p.Arg656Cys) were identified in four independent multigenerational pedigrees. Deleterious variants in HS1BP3 (NM_022460.3: c.94C>A, p.Gly32Cys) and GNA14 (NM_004297.3: c.989_990del, p.Thr330ArgfsTer67) were identified in a father and son with segmental cranio-cervical dystonia first manifest as BSP. Deleterious variants in DNAH17, TRPV4, CAPN11, VPS13C, UNC13B, SPTBN4, MYOD1, and MRPL15 were found in two or more independent pedigrees. To our knowledge, none of these genes have previously been associated with isolated BSP, although other CACNA1A mutations have been associated with both positive and negative motor disorders including ataxia, episodic ataxia, hemiplegic migraine, and dystonia. Our WES datasets provide a platform for future studies of BSP genetics which will demand careful consideration of incomplete penetrance, pleiotropy, population stratification, and oligogenic inheritance patterns.

In hemifacial spasm, the degree of corneal astigmatism was evaluated between two eyes. Then the topographic changes were checked using vector analysis technique before and after passively opening the eyelids. They were also measured before and at 1 and 6 months after the injection of Botulinum toxin. Resultantly, 20 eyes had the with-the-rule (group1) and 9 eyes against-the-rule (group2) astigmatism. In hemifacial spasm, significantly more astigmatism was found at spastic eyes. The corneal topographic changes after passively opening the eyelids showed 10 eyes with the astigmatic shift to the with-the-rule, while the remaining 19 to the against-the-rule. At 1 month after injection of Botulinum toxin, group 1 showed reduced average corneal astigmatism, whereas group 2 showed increased astigmatism. The astigmatic change vector showed significantly more against-the-rule. In the contrary, 6 months after treatment, corneal astigmatism again increased in group 1 and decreased in group 2. So they took on the appearance of pretreatment astigmatic status eventually. Conclusively eyelids may play an important role in corneal curvature.

This trial explores the safety and efficacy of topical Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 (AH8), a competitive SNAP25 inhibitor, as a potential new therapy in BSP. Methods Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of daily topical application of AH8 in 24 patients with BSP. The primary outcome was time to return to baseline Jankovic Rating Scale (JBRS) after a BoNT injection simultaneously with initiation of AH8. Patients displaying a strictly regular pattern of response to 3-monthly injections of BoNT were included. Results There were no significant adverse events. There was a trend for longer time until return to baseline JBRS after injection in the active group compared to placebo (3.7 vs 3.0 months), and for better scores in the active group. One third (4/12) of the patients in the active group had a significant extension of symptom control after BoNT (range: 3.3-7.1 months). Conclusions Topical AH8 is safe and promising for extending the duration of action of BoNT therapy for BSP.

Cyclical treatment with botulinum toxin injections offers temporary relief, but the duration of treatment efficacy is variable. The standard model of patient care defines routine fixed-time based scheduled treatment cycles which may lead to unnecessarily frequent treatment for some patients and experience of distressing symptoms in others, if symptoms return before the scheduled follow-up period. A randomised controlled trial will compare a patient-initiated model of care, where patients determine botulinum toxin treatment timing, to the standard model of care in which care is scheduled by the clinical team. A sample of 266 patients with blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm will be recruited from Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH), London. The trial will be accompanied by a mixed-methods evaluation of acceptability of the new service. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be assessed at baseline and those in the intervention group will be provided with instructions on how to book their own treatment appointments. Patients in both groups will be followed up 3 and 9 months into the trial and all patients will be returned to usual care after 9 months to meet safety protocols. Primary outcome measures include disease severity (questionnaire), functional disability (questionnaire) and patient satisfaction with care (questionnaire). Secondary outcomes include disease-specific quality of life (questionnaire), mood (questionnaire), illness and treatment perceptions (questionnaire and semi-structured interviews), economic impact (questionnaire) and acceptability (questionnaire and semi-structured interviews). This trial will assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a patient-led care model for botulinum toxin therapy. If the new model is shown to be effective in reducing distress and disability in these populations and is found to be acceptable to\n\nSexual Well-Being in Patients with Blepharospasm, Spasmodic Torticollis, and Hemifacial Spasm: A Pilot Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPerozzo, Paola; Salatino, Adriana; Cerrato, Paolo; Ricci, Raffaella\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMood, anxiety, and other psychological symptoms are common in dystonic patients suffering from blepharospasm (BSP) and spasmodic torticollis (ST). Since sexual well-being is an important aspect of mental health, here, we investigated whether these patients may also experience a worsening of their sexual life. In particular, quality of sexual life was evaluated in patients suffering from BSP (N = 30), ST (N = 30), and in a control group of patient with Hemifacial spasm (HFS; N = 30), undergoing botulinum toxin type A therapy. A group of 30 age-matched healthy volunteers constituted an additional control group. Patients were evaluated just before the periodic injection of botulinum toxin. Sexual functioning was assessed using the Sexual Functioning Inventory, a reduced form of the Golombok Rust Inventory, previously employed in patients with Parkinsonâs disease. Depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and anxiety (STAI-X1/X2) were also assessed. Results revealed that sexual functioning was significantly affected in patients with BSP, ST, and HFS with respect to healthy controls. Dystonic patients manifested more sexual dysfunction than patients with HFS. Overall, females had a poorer quality of sexual life than males and, among females, women with BSP were the most dysfunctional. Psychological symptoms were present in patients with dystonia, but not in patients with HFS. As discussed in the paper, several factors might be taken into account to explain worse quality of sexual life in patients with dystonia compared to patients with hemifacial spasm. Among them an important role might be played by the central origin of dystonia pathophysiology (i.e., altered activity of cortico-striato-thalamic-cortical circuits). Future investigations are necessary to further explore these preliminary findings, considering that this is the first time that sexual well-being is evaluated in patients with BSP, ST, and HFS, and comparable data are not available.

Although similar in clinical presentation different pathophysiological mechanisms are assumed. Botulinum Neurotoxin (BoNT) is a standard evidence-based treatment for both conditions. In this study we aimed to assess grey matter microstructural differences between these two groups of patients and compared them with healthy controls. In patients we furthermore tracked the longitudinal morphometric changes associated with BoNT therapy. We hypothesized microstructural differences between the groups at the time point of maximum symptoms representation and distinct longitudinal grey matter dynamics with symptom improvement. Methods Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of 3T 3D-T1 MRI images from BEB, HFS patients prior to and one month after BoNT therapy and from a group of age and sex matched healthy controls. Cortical thickness as extracted from Freesurfer was assessed as parameter of microstructural integrity. Results BoNT therapy markedly improved motor symptoms in patients with BEB and HFS. Significant differences of grey matter integrity have been found between the two patients groups. The BEB group showed lower cortical thickness at baseline in the frontal-rostral, supramarginal and temporal regions compared to patients with HFS. In this group BoNT treatment was associated with a cortical thinning in the primary motor cortex and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Contrary patients with HFS showed no longitudinal CT changes. A decreased cortical thickness was attested bilaterally in the temporal poles and in the right superior frontal region in BEB patients in comparison to HC. Patients in the HFS group presented a decreased CT in the left lingual gyrus and temporal pole. Conclusions Although patients with BEB and HFS present clinically with involuntary movements of facial muscles, they exhibited differences\n\nA novel ANO3 variant identified in a 53-year-old woman presenting with hyperkinetic dysarthria, blepharospasm, hyperkinesias, and complex motorÂ tics.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlackburn, Patrick R; Zimmermann, Michael T; Gass, Jennifer M; Harris, Kimberly G; Cousin, Margot A; Boczek, Nicole J; Ross, Owen A; Klee, Eric W; Brazis, Paul W; Van Gerpen, Jay A; Atwal, Paldeep S\n\n2016-12-05\n\nCervical dystonias have a variable presentation and underlying etiology, but collectively represent the most common form of focal dystonia. There are a number of known genetic forms of dystonia (DYT1-27); however the heterogeneity of disease presentation does not always make it easy to categorize the disease by phenotype-genotype comparison. In this report, we describe a 53-year-old female who presented initially with hand tremor following a total hip arthroplasty. The patient developed a mixed hyperkinetic disorder consisting of chorea, dystonia affecting the upper extremities, dysarthria, and blepharospasm. Whole exome sequencing of the patient revealed a novel heterozygous missense variant (Chr11(GRCh38): g.26525644Câ>âG; NM_031418.2(ANO3): c.702Câ>âG; NP_113606.2. p.C234W) in exon 7 in the ANO3 gene. ANO3 encodes anoctamin-3, a Ca +2 -dependent phospholipid scramblase expressed in striatal-neurons, that has been implicated in autosomal dominant craniocervical dystonia (Dystonia-24, DYT24, MIM# 615034). To date, only a handful of cases of DYT-24 have been described in the literature. The complex clinical presentation of the patient described includes hyperkinesias, complex motor movements, and vocal tics, which have not been reported in other patients with DYT24. This report highlights the utility of using clinical whole exome sequencing in patients with complex neurological phenotypes that would not normally fit a classical presentation of a defined genetic disease.\n\nProspective Study Evaluating IncobotulinumtoxinA for Cervical Dystonia or Blepharospasm: Interim Results from the First 145 Subjects with Cervical Dystonia.\n\nPubMed\n\nFernandez, Hubert H; Pagan, Fernando; Danisi, Fabio; Greeley, David; Jankovic, Joseph; Verma, Amit; Sethi, Kapil; Pappert, Eric J\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe report the interim results from XCiDaBLE, a large, prospective, observational \"naturalistic\" study evaluating XeominÂ® (incobotulinumtoxinA) for Cervical Dystonia or BLEpharospasm in the United States.

The present study reports a prospective case series of 38 patients (76 eyes, 11 men and 27 women; mean age 66.8Â Â±Â 9.8Â years) with BEB who underwent BTX-A treatment at Kokura Memorial Hospital between 2013 and 2014. Patients were evaluated for ophthalmoscopic findings, Schirmer I test, tear film break-up time (t-BUT), HOAs, fluctuation index (FI), stability index (SI) using a wavefront aberrometer, 15 subjective symptoms using the Dry Eye-Related Quality of Life Score (DEQS), and complications before and after the treatment. After BTX-A treatment, the Schirmer I test score improved significantly from 5.9Â Â±Â 5.4 to 8.7Â Â±Â 6.1Â mm and t-BUT recovered from 5.2Â Â±Â 1.7 to 7.3Â Â±Â 1.7Â s. HOAs were classified into four patterns: stable (60.5Â %), small fluctuation (14.5Â %), sawtooth (17.1Â %), and reverse sawtooth (7.9Â %), and they significantly reduced after the treatment. Only FI (not SI) showed a marked reduction, and the DEQS significantly improved from 44.7Â Â±Â 21.6 to 37.6Â Â±Â 21.0 after the treatment (pÂ <Â 0.05). There were no complications during the observations.

Similarly, masticatory dystonia may occur in isolation or in combination with dystonia of other cranial and cervical muscles. The non-possessive and possessive forms of Meige and Brueghel syndromes have been variably and imprecisely ascribed to various anatomical variations of craniocervical dystonia. Herein, the origin of eponymic terms as applied to craniocervical dystonia is reviewed as support for proposed elimination of these eponyms from clinical usage. Although the term âsegmental craniocervical dystoniaâ more accurately captures the combination of blepharospasm and dystonia of other head and neck muscles, delineation of craniocervical subphenotypes is essential for etiological/genetic and treatment studies. To conclude, the clinical features, epidemiology, pathophysiology and therapeutic management of segmental craniocervical dystonia are examined with a particular focus on âblepharospasm-plusâ subphenotypes.

This study aimed to explore alterations in the basal ganglia in different forms of primary focal dystonia. Methods: cross-sectional observational study was performed between December 2013 and December 2014 in 80 patients with different forms of primary focal dystonia and 55 neurologically normal control subjects. TCS was performed in patients and control subjects. Multiple comparisons of multiple rates were used to compare LN hyperechogenicity ratios between control and patient groups. Results: Thirteen individuals were excluded due to poor temporal bone windows, and two subjects were excluded due to disagreement in evaluation by sonologists. Totally, 70 patients (cervical dystonia, n = 30; blepharospasm, n = 30; oromandibular dystonia, n = 10) and 50 normal controls were included in the final analysis. LN hyperechogenicity was observed in 51% (36/70) of patients with primary focal dystonia, compared with 12% (6/50) of controls (P < 0.001). Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity did not differ between the two groups. LN hyperechogenicity was observed in 73% (22/30) of patients with cervical dystonia, a greater prevalence than in patients with blepharospasm (33%, 10/30, P = 0.002) and oromandibular dystonia (40%, 4/10, P = 0.126). LN hyperechogenicity was more frequently observed in patients with cervical dystonia compared with controls (73% vs. 12%, P < 0.001); however, no significant difference was detected in patients with blepharospasm (33% vs. 12%, P = 0.021) or oromandibular dystonia (40% vs. 12%, P = 0.088). Conclusions: LN hyperechogenicity is more frequently observed in patients with primary focal dystonia than in controls. It does not appear to be a characteristic TCS echo feature in patients with blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia.

The purpose of this paper is to examine these published claims for possible methodological and design errors and potential sources of bias. The authors evaluated the published results in comparison to the published literature on zinc deficiency, the role of phytase, prior reports of an effect of zinc on activity of botulinum toxin, issues of study design and execution and if the reported results of the study supported the study's conclusions. Multiple issues are present in the reported study, which appear to invalidate its conclusions. These areas include lack of direct evidence for the presence of clinical or subclinical zinc deficiency in the study population or for the level of phytate in the study population sufficient to interfere with zinc absorption in these subjects. Additionally, there is ambiguity as to the actual dose of zinc used as well as in the study design itself. Also there is a failure of the study through the \"unmasking\" of the crossover design. There is potential financial conflict of interest in the study execution that may have biased the reported results. Finally there is inadequate data presented to evaluate the claims made of a \"new discovery\" as to the three disease entities reported on and the various botulinum toxins used in each of the three treatment arms of the study. Based on this evaluation, it appears that a high level of clinical and scientific skepticism is warranted concerning any claim of a beneficial effect of zinc and phytase supplementation on the efficacy or\n\nGenetics Home Reference: dystonia 6\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... neck, causing problems with speaking (dysarthria) and eating (dysphagia).

Its pathophysiology is not clearly determined. A 35-year-old female presented to psychiatric department with blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia with clinical provisional diagnosis of psychiatric disorder (Conversion Disorder). After thorough physical examination including detailed neurological exam and psychiatric evaluation no formal medical or psychiatric diagnosis could be made. The other differential diagnoses of extra pyramidal symptom, tardive dyskinesia, conversion disorder, anxiety disorder were ruled out by formal diagnostic criteria. Consequently with suspicion of Meige's syndrome she was referred to the department of Neurology and the diagnosis was confirmed. Hence, Meige's syndrome could be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder such as conversion disorder or anxiety disorder because clinical features of Meige's syndrome are highly variable and affected by psychological factors and also can be inhibited voluntarily to some extent.\n\nDystonia rating scales: critique and recommendations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlbanese, Alberto; Sorbo, Francesca Del; Comella, Cynthia; Jinnah, H.A.; Mink, Jonathan W.; Post, Bart; Vidailhet, Marie; Volkmann, Jens; Warner, Thomas T.; Leentjens, Albert F.G.; Martinez-Martin, Pablo; Stebbins, Glenn T.; Goetz, Christopher G.; Schrag, Anette\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Many rating scales have been applied to the evaluation of dystonia, but only few have been assessed for clinimetric properties. The Movement Disorders Society commissioned this task force to critique existing dystonia rating scales and place them in the clinical and clinimetric context. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify rating scales that have either been validated or used in dystonia. Results Thirty six potential scales were identified. Eight were excluded because they did not meet review criteria, leaving twenty-eight scales that were critiqued and rated by the task force. Seven scales were found to meet criteria to be ârecommendedâ: the Blepharospasm Disability Index is recommended for rating blepharospasm; the Cervical Dystonia Impact Scale and the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale for rating cervical dystonia; the Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire for blepharospasm and cervical dystonia; the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and the Vocal Performance Questionnaire (VPQ) for laryngeal dystonia; and the Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale for rating generalized dystonia. Two ârecommendedâ scales (VHI and VPQ) are generic scales validated on few patients with laryngeal dystonia, whereas the others are disease-specific scales. Twelve scales met criteria for âsuggestedâ and seven scales met criteria for âlistedâ. All the scales are individually reviewed in the online appendix. Conclusion The task force recommends five specific dystonia scales and suggests to further validate in dystonia two recommended generic voice-disorder scales. Existing scales for oromandibular, arm and task-specific dystonia should be refined and fully assessed. Scales should be developed for body regions where no scales are available, such as lower limbs and trunk.

Dysport (Ipsen Ltd, Wrexham, United Kingdom) is a botulinum neurotoxin type A preparation that has been available for a number of therapeutic uses for over 20 years in the European Union (EU). This survey was part of the EU botulinum toxin risk management plan to identify potential educational needs of injectors by collecting data on their routine practice administration of Dysport and their awareness of potential adverse events (AEs) that are included in the current product labeling. Dysport-experienced injectors in 5 EU countries were surveyed via telephone about their experience of Dysport in patients with cervical dystonia, adult upper and lower limb spasticity, pediatric cerebral palsy, and blepharospasm/hemifacial spasm. The reconstitution dilution volume most often used was 2.5 mL per 500 U for all indications. The mean total dose ranged from 387 to 530 U for cervical dystonia, 508 to 773 U for upper limb spasticity, 600 to 832 U for lower limb spasticity, 375 to 700 U for pediatric cerebral palsy, and 54 to 213 U for blepharospasm/hemifacial spasm. The potential AEs most commonly mentioned by surveyed physicians were dysphagia for cervical dystonia, arm muscle weakness for upper limb spasticity, leg muscle weakness for lower limb spasticity, and pediatric cerebral palsy and ptosis for blepharospasm/hemifacial spasm. The results indicate that product-labeling recommendations are generally applied in clinical practice and that there is a good familiarity with potential AEs based on clinical condition. Nevertheless, the survey shows that experienced injectors do sometimes deviate from the manufacturers labeling recommendations, highlighting the importance of ongoing education.\n\nCrotoxin in humans: analysis of the effects on extraocular and facial muscles.\n\nPubMed\n\nRibeiro, Geraldo de Barros; Almeida, Henderson Celestino de; Velarde, David Toledo\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCrotoxin is the main neurotoxin of South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus. The neurotoxic action is characterized by a presynaptic blockade. The purpose of this research is to assess the ability of crotoxin to induce temporary paralysis of extraocular and facial muscles in humans. Doses of crotoxin used ranged from 2 to 5 units (U), each unit corresponding to one LD50. We first applied 2U of crotoxin in one of the extraocular muscles of 3 amaurotic individuals to be submitted to ocular evisceration. In the second stage, we applied crotoxin in 12 extraocular muscles of 9 patients with strabismic amblyopia. In the last stage, crotoxin was used in the treatment of blepharospasm in another 3 patients. No patient showed any systemic side effect or change in vision or any eye structure problem after the procedure. The only local side effects observed were slight conjunctival hyperemia, which recovered spontaneously. In 2 patients there was no change in ocular deviation after 2U crotoxin application. Limitation of the muscle action was observed in 8 of the 12 applications. The change in ocular deviation after application of 2U of crotoxin (9 injections) was in average 15.7 prism diopters (PD). When the dose was 4U (2 applications) the change was in average 37.5 PD and a single application of 5U produced a change of 16 PD in ocular deviation. This effect lasted from 1 to 3 months. Two of the 3 patients with blepharospasm had the hemifacial spasm improved with crotoxin, which returned after 2 months. This study provides data suggesting that crotoxin may be a useful new therapeutic option for the treatment of strabismus and blepharospasm. We expect that with further studies crotoxin could be an option for many other medical areas.\n\nTopical anesthesia without intracameral lidocaine in cataract surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpiritus, A; Huygens, M; Callebaut, F\n\n2000-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of topical anesthesia with oxybuprocaÃ¯ne 0.4% without intracameral lidocaÃ¯ne as an alternative to peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia in cataract surgery. Fifty-eight patients (eighty-two eyes) were included in this study. All patients received topical anesthesia with oxybuprocaÃ¯ne 0.4%. No intracameral lidocaÃ¯ne was used at the start of the intervention. Seventy-five per cent of patients received oral sedation with lorazepam 2.5 mg. All surgery was done using a superior corneal incision and phacoemulsification followed by a foldable IOL implantation. Subjective pain was assessed at 4 intervals during surgery using a 4-point pain scale. All patients were evaluated for intraoperative eye motility and blepharospasm. Patient and surgeon satisfaction was measured with a 4-point satisfaction scale. 15% of patients experienced mild pain during phaco and 43% had mild pain during corneal suturing. No patient had severe pain during the operation. In 4% of patients, intracameral lidocaÃ¯ne was used to relieve pain. The surgeon and patient satisfaction was high. No eye movements or blepharospasm were recorded in 75% and 62% of cases respectively. No serious complications occurred. Topical anesthesia is a safe and effective alternative to peribulbar and retrobulbar anesthesia in corneal cataract surgery for the experienced surgeon.\n\nA Novel Animal Model for Investigating the Neural Basis of Focal Dystonia\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-09-01\n\nbasal ganglia as the predisposing condition and dry eye as an environmental trigger.

Reported prevalence rates vary considerably; well-characterized cohorts are important to our understanding of this disorder. To perform a nationwide epidemiological study of adult onset idiopathic isolated focal dystonia in the Republic of Ireland. Patients with adult onset idiopathic isolated focal dystonia were recruited from multiple sources. Diagnosis was based on assessment by a neurologist with an expertise in movement disorders. When consent was obtained, a number of clinical features including family history were assessed. On the prevalence date there were 592 individuals in Ireland with adult onset idiopathic isolated focal dystonia, a point prevalence of 17.8 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval 16.4-19.2). Phenotype numbers were cervical dystonia 410 (69.2%), blepharospasm 102 (17.2%), focal hand dystonia 39 (6.6%), spasmodic dysphonia 18 (3.0%), musician's dystonia 17 (2.9%) and oromandibular dystonia six (1.0%). Sixty-two (16.5%) of 375 consenting index cases had a relative with clinically confirmed adult onset idiopathic isolated focal dystonia (18 multiplex and 24 duplex families). Marked variations in the proportions of patients with tremor, segmental spread, sensory tricks, pain and psychiatric symptoms by phenotype were documented. The prevalence of adult onset idiopathic isolated focal dystonia in Ireland is higher than that recorded in many similar service-based epidemiological studies but is still likely to be an underestimate. The low proportion of individuals with blepharospasm may reflect reduced environmental exposure to sunlight in Ireland. This study will serve as a resource for international comparative studies of environmental and genetic factors in the pathogenesis of the disorder.

The experiments were conducted on eight male Wistar rats (250-300Â g). After ophthalmic examination, epithelial cell layers in the central cornea were wounded. Rats received 30Â Î¼L of tramadol hydrochloride in one eye (Group Tramadol) and the same volume of vehicle in the other (Group Control) every 12Â h for 7Â days. Both eyes were stained with fluorescein dye, photographed, and wound area was calculated every 8Â h until complete healing was observed. Eye blink frequency and corneal reflex tests were measured before and after drug administrations. After 7Â days, slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, Goldmann applanation tonometry, and histological evaluation were performed. There was no difference in the corneal wound healing rates between the tramadol and control groups. Reduction in wound area over time was also similar; group-time interaction was insignificant (FÂ =Â 738.911; pÂ =Â 0.225). Tramadol application resulted in blinking and blepharospasm for 30Â s, but vehicle did not. Corneal reflex was intact and eye blink frequency test results were similar in all measurement times in both groups. Slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, and intraocular pressures were within normal range. Corneal cells appeared unaffected by the repeated doses of tramadol for 7Â days. Topical tramadol application on the cornea did not cause any side effect, except for initial temporary blinking and blepharospasm. Corneal wound healing was not affected, either.\n\n[Facial tics and spasms].\n\nPubMed\n\nPotgieser, Adriaan R E; van Dijk, J Marc C; Elting, Jan Willem J; de Koning-Tijssen, Marina A J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFacial tics and spasms are socially incapacitating, but effective treatment is often available. The clinical picture is sufficient for distinguishing between the different diseases that cause this affliction.We describe three cases of patients with facial tics or spasms: one case of tics, which are familiar to many physicians; one case of blepharospasms; and one case of hemifacial spasms. We discuss the differential diagnosis and the treatment possibilities for facial tics and spasms. Early diagnosis and treatment is important, because of the associated social incapacitation. Botulin toxin should be considered as a treatment option for facial tics and a curative neurosurgical intervention should be considered for hemifacial spasms.\n\nHemifacial Spasm: A Neurosurgical Perspective\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKong, Doo-Sik\n\n2007-01-01\n\nHemifacial spasm (HFS) is characterized by tonic clonic contractions of the muscles innervated by the ipsilateral facial nerve. Compression of the facial nerve by an ectatic vessel is widely recognized as the most common underlying etiology. HFS needs to be differentiated from other causes of facial spasms, such as facial tic, ocular myokymia, and blepharospasm. To understand the overall craniofacial abnormalities and to perform the optimal surgical procedures for HFS, we are to review the prevalence, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, details of each treatment modality, usefulness of brainstem auditory evoked potentials monitoring, debates on the facial EMG, clinical course, and complications from the literature published from 1995 to the present time.

It already has been given several market authorizations as indicated for: blepharospasm, spasmodic stiff neck, and glabellar lines. Furthermore, several studies are ongoing to prove its effectiveness and usefulness for many other pathologies: treatment of pain following cervical spine surgery; action on salivary glands after trauma, hypertrophy, or hyper-salivation; analgesic action (acknowledged but still being experimented) on neuralgia, articular pain, and keloids scars due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Botulinum toxin injections in the cervico-facial area are more and more used and should be to be correctly assessed. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Parkinson's disease and other causes.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiller, J Q\n\n1986-03-01\n\nDyskinesia is usually lifelong and progressive; therefore, physicians generally see the disorder in elderly patients. Medical treatment must be carefully selected on the basis of the cause of the dyskinesia. Parkinsonian dyskinesia is well controlled by drug therapy. However, patients can become less responsive to a drug after years of use and may experience unwelcome side effects. Cerebellar tremor is extremely disabling because it worsens with activity, but no satisfactory therapy is available. Senile, essential, and familial tremors are also intensified by action, but they can often be suppressed with a mild tranquilizer or a beta blocker. Drug treatment of blepharospasm and spastic dysphonia has been disappointing: Facial or laryngeal surgery is sometimes required. Tardive dyskinesia is caused by neuroleptic drugs, so the only therapy for the disorder is withdrawal of the offending drug.\n\nHow Many Dystonias? Clinical Evidence.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlbanese, Alberto\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLiterary reports on dystonia date back to post-Medieval times. Medical reports are instead more recent. We review here the early descriptions and the historical establishment of a consensus on the clinical phenomenology and the diagnostic features of dystonia syndromes. Lumping and splitting exercises have characterized this area of knowledge, and it remains largely unclear how many dystonia types we are to count. This review describes the history leading to recognize that focal dystonia syndromes are a coherent clinical set encompassing cranial dystonia (including blepharospasm), oromandibular dystonia, spasmodic torticollis, truncal dystonia, writer's cramp, and other occupational dystonias. Papers describing features of dystonia and diagnostic criteria are critically analyzed and put into historical perspective. Issues and inconsistencies in this lumping effort are discussed, and the currently unmet needs are critically reviewed.\n\nCurvularia keratomycosis in a dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nBen-Shlomo, Gil; Plummer, Caryn; Barrie, Kathleen; Brooks, Dennis\n\n2010-03-01\n\nA 10-year-old, spayed female Bichon Frise was referred to the Veterinary Medical Center of the University of Florida with a 6-week history of blepharospasm and a nonhealing ulcer of the left eye. Ophthalmic examination revealed a 3-4 mm diameter corneal ulcer with faint edema at the lesion edge, and a raised grayish area on the paraxial cornea near the 2 o'clock position. Cytological testing revealed fungal hyphae and extracellular cocci. Culture of the lesion found heavy growth of Enterococcus faecalis and Curvularia spp. Treatment with a combination of topical antibiotics (polymyxin B, sulfate/trimetoprim, and 10% sulfacetamide sodium), 1% miconazole, autologous serum, and 5% hypertonic saline was instituted. After 8 days of medical therapy, an improvement of clinical signs was noted, and 15 days after initiation of treatment, the ulcer was healed with minimal corneal scarring.\n\nBotulinum Toxin for the Treatment of Tremor and Tics.\n\nPubMed\n\nLotia, Mitesh; Jankovic, Joseph\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe therapeutic applications of botulinum toxin (BoNT) have grown manifold since its initial approval in 1989 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of strabismus, blepharospasm, and other facial spasms. Although it is the most potent biologic toxin known to man, long-term studies have established its safety in the treatment of a variety of neurologic and nonneurologic disorders. Despite a paucity of randomized controlled trials, BoNT has been found to be beneficial in treating a variety of tremors and tics when used by clinicians skilled in the administration of the drug for these hyperkinetic movement disorders. Botulinum toxin injections can provide meaningful improvement in patients with localized tremors and tics; in some cases, they may be an alternative to other treatments with more undesirable adverse effects.

Vehicles incorporating nanotechnology have led to great strides in drug delivery, allowing for increased active ingredient stability, bioavailability, and site-specific targeting. Botulinum toxin has historically been used for the correction of neurological and neuromuscular disorders, such as torticollis, blepharospasm, and strabismus. Recent dermatological indications have been for the management of axillary hyperhydrosis and facial rhytides. Traditional methods of botulinum toxin delivery have been needle-based. These have been associated with increased pain and cost. Newer methods of botulinum toxin formulation have yielded topical preparations that are bioactive in small pilot clinical studies. While there are some risks associated with topical delivery, the refinement and standardization of delivery systems and techniques for the topical administration of botulinum toxin using nanotechnology is anticipated in the near future.\n\nDevelopment of future indications for BOTOX.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrin, Mitchell F\n\n2009-10-01\n\nSince the late 1970s, local injections of BoNT have provided clinical benefit for patients with inappropriately contracting muscles with or without pain or sensory disturbance. Marketing authorization for some BoNTs, depending on country, include core indications of dystonia (blepharospasm and cervical dystonia), large muscle spastic disorders (not yet approved in the United States, e.g., adult post-stroke spasticity and equinus foot deformity), hyperhidrosis and aesthetic. Subsequent development has extended to selected conditions characterized by recurrent or chronic pain (migraine headache), and urologic indications (neurogenic/idiopathic overactive bladder; prostate hyperplasia), with multiple additional opportunities available. Portfolio management requires a careful individual opportunity assessment of scientific and technical aspects (basic science foundation, potential to treat unmet medical need, product-specific risk in specific populations, therapeutic margin/safety profile, and probability of successful registration pathway). This article describes ongoing development targets for BOTOX.\n\nSystemic mycosis in three dogs from nonendemic regions.\n\nPubMed\n\nPratt, Carmela L; Sellon, Rance K; Spencer, Erick S; Johnson, Ty W; Righter, Daniel J\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThree dogs were examined for clinical signs ultimately attributed to systemic fungal infections. One dog was evaluated for chronic, ulcerated dermal lesions and lymphadenomegaly; one dog was examined for acute onset of unilateral blepharospasm; and one dog had diarrhea and hematochezia. Two of the dogs were diagnosed with blastomycosis (one with disseminated disease and the other with the disease localized to the left eye). The third dog was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis. None of the dogs originated from, or had traveled to, typical regions endemic for these fungal diseases. All diagnoses were established from histopathology and either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or cytology and culture. The two dogs diagnosed with blastomycosis were treated with either itraconazole or ketoconazole with apparent resolution of the infections. The dog with ocular involvement had an enucleation prior to beginning therapy. The dog diagnosed with histoplasmosis was euthanized without treatment. In patients with characteristic clinical features, systemic fungal infections should still be considered as differential diagnoses regardless of their travel history.\n\nCurrent and future medical treatment in primary dystonia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDelnooz, CathÃ©rine C.S.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder, characterized by involuntary and sustained contractions of opposing muscles causing twisting movements and abnormal postures. It is often a disabling disorder that has a significant impact on physical and psychosocial wellbeing. The medical therapeutic armamentarium used in practice is quite extensive, but for many of these interventions formal proof of efficacy is lacking. Exceptions are the use of botulinum toxin in patients with cervical dystonia, some forms of cranial dystonia (in particular, blepharospasm) and writerâs cramp; deep brain stimulation of the pallidum in generalized and segmental dystonia; and high-dose trihexyphenidyl in young patients with segmental and generalized dystonia. In order to move this field forward, we not only need better trials that examine the effect of current treatment interventions, but also a further understanding of the pathophysiology of dystonia as a first step to design and test new therapies that are targeted at the underlying biologic and neurophysiologic mechanisms.

Right mandibular, and right and left maxillary nerve blocks were administered using a 1 ml syringe attached to a 25 G x 5/8 inch needle and an intraoral technique. The following day the cat displayed blepharospasm of the right eye. The ocular signs progressed and 5 days later an ophthalmologist confirmed a blind, glaucomatous right eye. It was suspected that the eye had suffered a penetrating injury during dental surgery. Enucleation of the right eye was performed and gross and histopathological examination revealed a penetrating wound consistent with a needle tract injury. Complications arising from veterinary dental regional anaesthesia appear to be rare; however, it may be that they are under-reported. This case report highlights the risks involved and reviews the safest and most efficacious regional anaesthesia technique for the feline maxilla.

Clinical examination confirmed euryblepharon and entropion bilaterally in two females and one male and unilaterally in two female kids. Deep stromal corneal ulceration was present in two eyes, and corneal granulation tissue and fibrosis were present in half (5/10) the affected eyes. A combination Hotz-Celsus and lateral eyelid wedge resection procedure was performed on all affected eyelids. Recheck examinations and long-term follow-up confirmed resolution of the entropion, preservation of normal eyelid conformation, and restoration of ocular comfort. Pedigree analysis ruled out sex-linked and autosomal dominant inheritance patterns; a specific mode of inheritance could not be determined. The Boer goat breed may be at increased risk for the development of entropion. This cases series represents the first report of entropion in the caprine species.

The hamster had been used only for breeding. Because of the poor prognosis, the hamster was euthanized without additional diagnostic assays or treatments. Routine gross pathologic evaluation demonstrated exophthalmos and presumptive hyphema of the left eye, bilateral facial edema, freely movable nodules within the mesentery, white foci within the liver, and a large mass effacing the cranial pole of the right kidney. On histologic evaluation, the mesenteric nodules and liver foci expressed histiocytic marker CD163 and thus were diagnosed as sites of histiocytic sarcoma, whereas the kidney mass was a well-differentiated renal cell carcinoma. The facial swelling resulted from bilateral, chronic, severe, branching thrombi in many facial veins. Additional age-related histopathologic findings were observed in other organs, including diffuse glomerulopathy, nesidioblastosis (pancreatic islet neoformation), and multiple foci of severe cartilage degeneration in the axial skeleton. To our knowledge, this report provides the first description of histiocytic sarcoma in a Siberian hamster.\n\nActinomyces bowdenii ulcerative keratitis in a dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nSherman, Amanda; Daniels, Joshua B; Wilkie, David A; Lutz, Elizabeth\n\n2013-09-01\n\nA 5-year-old spayed female diabetic mixed-breed dog underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation to correct bilateral hypermature cataracts. Two months postsurgery, the patient presented with ulcerative keratitis and multifocal stromal abscessation OD, which was controlled, but never resolved, with topical fluoroquinolone therapy. The patient re-presented 2âmonths later with a new, raised, white gritty corneal opacity associated with hyperemia, chemosis, and blepharospasm OD. Cytology of the right cornea revealed filamentous bacteria, suggestive of Actinomyces spp. Actinomyces bowdenii was subsequently isolated in pure culture and identified via 16s rDNA sequencing. Actinomyces bowdenii has never before been described as a cause of ocular infection. An immunosuppressed corneal environment likely contributed to this opportunistic Actinomycosis. The infection was not controlled with fluoroquinolone therapy, and the isolate, in vitro, was resistant to three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin), which also has not been previously reported for this species of Actinomyces. A superficial keratectomy with conjunctival graft was employed to successfully manage the infection.

A historical sketch].\n\nPubMed\n\nHomann, C N; Wenzel, K; Kriechbaum, N; Suppan, K; Crevenna, R; Ivanic, G; Dressler, D\n\n2002-06-01\n\nBotulism, a potentially lethal form of paralytic food poisoning, was described as early as 1793. Basic research, especially in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, revealed that botulism is caused by exotoxins. Further biochemical work around and after the Second World War gave insight into the molecular structure of seven different serotypes of botulinum toxin (BT/A-G) as well as into its acetylcholine blocking mode of action. In 1977, Scott treated patients with strabism by injecting minute amounts of purified BT/A. In short sequence, BT proved effective in blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, and various off-label indications. In the near future, registration of these new indications, marketing of new serotypes (BT/B), and availability of more practical antibody tests can be expected. The first applications of BT were performed by Roggenkaemper, Dressler, and Benecke in Germany and by Poewe and Auff in Austria. According to a worldwide trend, a rapid expansion regarding BT users and indications followed. Formation of BT competence centers in both countries aims at maintaining high standards in BT research and education.\n\nA 14-year-old girl who regained normal vision after bilateral visual impairment following hot water injury to the eyes.\n\nPubMed\n\nMonsudi, Kehinde F; Ayanniyi, Abdulkabir A\n\n2011-04-01\n\nA 14-year-old girl presented with bilateral visual impairment following hot water injury to the eyes.

Also, the patient was managed with capsule doxycycline 100Â mg 12Â h for 10Â days, tablet cataflam 50Â mg 12Â h for 7Â days and intramuscular tetanus toxoid 0.5Â mg stat and dermacine cream for facial scald. The visual acuities improved from 3/60 (right eye) and 6/24 (left eye) to 6/6 in both eyes. There were resolutions of facial/eye pain, tearing, photophobia, lid edema, blepharospasm, and conjunctival hyperemia. There was complete healing of facial wounds and corneal ulcers. She was discharged from hospital on the 7th day of admission. Prompt presentation, degree of scald sustained, and appropriate medical intervention enhanced visual recovery and wound healing in the patient.\n\nIntraerythrocytic iridovirus in central bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps).\n\nPubMed\n\nGrosset, Claire; Wellehan, James F X; Owens, Sean D; McGraw, Sabrina; Gaffney, Patricia M; Foley, Janet; Childress, April L; Yun, Susan; Malm, Kirsten; Groff, Joseph M; Paul-Murphy, Joanne; Weber, E Scott\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThree adult central bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) originating from a commercial breeding facility presented with clinical signs, including anorexia, dehydration, white multifocal lesions on the dorsal aspect of the tongue, blepharospasm, and weight loss. In 1 of 3 lizards, a marked regenerative anemia was noted, and all 3 bearded dragons had erythrocytic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Nine bearded dragons housed in contact also had identical, but fewer intraerythrocytic inclusions. Inclusion bodies examined by electron microscopy had particles consistent with iridoviruses. Attempts to culture the virus were unsuccessful; however, amplification and sequencing of regions of the viral DNA polymerase by polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of an iridovirus. One of the bearded dragons died, while the 2 others showing clinical signs were euthanized. The remaining 9 infected bearded dragons of the teaching colony were also euthanized. Postmortem examination revealed a moderate, multifocal, lymphoplasmacytic or mononuclear adenitis of the tongue in the 3 bearded dragons, and a lymphohistiocytic hepatitis with bacterial granulomas in 2 lizards.

Examination of the left eye revealed mild exophthalmos, pain on retropulsion, and absent menace response and pupillary light reflexes. Examination of the posterior segment was not possible owing to the anterior segment pathology. Differential diagnoses considered were iatrogenic globe penetration and peribulbar abscess/cellulitis. Ocular ultrasound was consistent with a penetrating wound to the globe. Treatment with systemic prednisolone and marbofloxacin, and topical atropine sulfate 1%, prednisolone acetate, and brinzolamide was started. Marked clinical improvement allowed visual confirmation of the perforation. Oral prednisolone was tapered over the following 10 weeks. At final re-examination (10 months), the patient was visual, and fundic examination revealed an additional chorioretinal scar, most likely an exit wound that was obscured by vitreal debris on initial examinations. Neither scar was associated with retinal detachment. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of successful medical management of iatrogenic globe penetration following exodontic procedures.

The etiology is unknown. Diagnosis is based on somatometric data and the particular phenotype traits. Biochemical and endocrine studies are normal. Torticollis is a focal dystonia and therefore more common in adults. A 20 year old woman with macrosomic features since birth presented with: weight 104 kg, height 182 cm; prognathism, hypertelorism, a broad over hanging forehead with a high hair line; large ears, hands and feet; torticollis towards the right with elevation and anteroversion of the right shoulder which caused symptomatic scoliosis. She was bradypsychic and rather slow in speech. The complementary tests done (cerebral and cervical CT and MR, bone gammography, evoked potentials, EMG-ENG, sural nerve biopsy, biopsy of skin and muscle, EEG and hormone and biochemistry studies) were normal. The torticollis was treated with botulinus toxin and improved considerably, as did the scoliosis. To date, dystonia has not been described in association with Sotos syndrome. This may be a causal association, or even perhaps hereditary, since the patient's mother had dystonia (in the form of blepharospasm).\n\nEffect of Botulinum Toxin A on Muscle Healing and its Implications in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilberstein, Eldad; Maor, Ehud; Sukmanov, Oleg; Bogdanov Berezovsky, Alexander; Shoham, Yaron; Krieger, Yuval\n\n2018-04-06\n\nMuscle activity contributes to the enhancement of facial aging deformity, blepharospasm, cerebral palsy spasticity, trismus, torticollis, and other conditions. Myotomy of the involved muscles in order to reduce the deformity has variable success rates due to muscle healing and regeneration of activity. The goal of this study was to investigate whether blocking striated muscle activity with Botulinum toxin (BtxA) during the healing time after myotomy alters the healing process and reduces long-term muscle activity. Eighteen Sprague Dawley rats where divided into 3 groups: group A (n = 7) underwent myotomy of their Latisimus Dorsi muscle; group B (n = 7) underwent myotomy and injection of BtxA into their severed muscle; group C (n = 4) injection of BtxA only. Muscle strength was tested periodically using a grip test. Starting at week 16 and until the termination of study at week 22, group B (Myotomy + BtxA) showed significant reduction in muscle power compared to the two control groups. Addition of BtxA injection into a muscle immediately after myotomy may interfere with muscle healing and contribute to a more successful long-term result.\n\nEpiscleral cyclosporine A implants for the management of unilateral keratoconjunctivitis sicca in an 8-year-old mare.\n\nPubMed\n\nMackenzie, Catriona J; Carslake, Harry B; Robin, Matthew; Kent, Rebecca J; Malalana, Fernando\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAn 8-year-old mare was presented for investigation of a 1-month history of blepharospasm, eyelid swelling, corneal edema, and ocular discharge of the right eye (OD). Ophthalmic examination confirmed mucopurulent ocular discharge, conjunctival hyperemia, and a dry, dull appearance to the cornea OD. Schirmer tear test results confirmed an absence of tear production OD (0 mm/min) consistent with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Treatment with topical 0.2% cyclosporine A resulted in an improvement in clinical signs. An episcleral cyclosporine A implant was placed under standing sedation 5 days after initial presentation. Re-examination 9 days post-operatively confirmed that the mare's tear production in the right eye had improved and no further clinical signs had been observed. Topical medications were gradually discontinued. Re-examinations performed up to 12 months postsurgery showed no recurrence of clinical signs and no adverse effects of the implant. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of a cyclosporine A implant in the management of KCS in a horse and highlights its potential as an effective, alternative therapy in the management of KCS in horses.

The purpose of this study was to identify possible endogenous and exogenous risk and protective factors uniquely associated with SD. Prospective, exploratory, case-control investigation. One hundred fifty patients with SD and 150 medical controls (MCs) were interviewed regarding their personal and family histories, environmental exposures, illnesses, injuries, voice use patterns, and general health using a previously vetted and validated epidemiologic questionnaire. Odds ratios and multiple logistic regression analyses (Î±<0.15) identified several factors that significantly increased the likelihood of having SD. These factors included (1) a personal history of mumps, blepharospasm, tremor, intense occupational and avocational voice use, and a family history of voice disorders; (2) an immediate family history of meningitis, tremor, tics, cancer, and compulsive behaviors; and (3) an extended family history of tremor and cancer. SD is likely multifactorial in etiology, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Viral infections/exposures, along with intense voice use, may trigger the onset of SD in genetically predisposed individuals. Future studies should examine the interaction among genetic and environmental factors to determine the pathogenesis of SD. Copyright ÃÂ© 2011 The Voice Foundation. Published by Mosby, Inc.

The BPEI Photosensitivity System provides a light stimuli emitted from a bi-cupola concave, 210 white LED array with varying intensity ranging from 1 to 32,000 lux. The system can either utilize a normal or an enhanced testing mode for subjects with low light tolerance. The automated instrument adjusts the intensity of each light stimulus. The subject is instructed to indicate discomfort by pressing a hand-held button. Reliability of the responses is tracked during the test. The photosensitivity threshold is then calculated after 10 response reversals. In a preliminary study, we demonstrated that subjects suffering from Achromatopsia experienced lower photosensitivity thresholds than normal subjects. Hence, the system can safely and reliably determine the photosensitivity thresholds of healthy and light sensitive subjects by detecting and quantifying the individual differences. Future studies will be performed with this system to determine the photosensitivity threshold differences between normal subjects and subjects suffering from other conditions that affect light sensitivity.\n\n[Myths and evidence on the use of botulinum toxin: neuropharmacology and dystonia].\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcia-Ruiz, P J; Sanz-Cartagena, P; Martinez-Castrillo, J C; Ares-Pensado, B; Aviles-Olmos, I; Blazquez-Estrada, M; Fanjul-Arbos, S; Garcia-Caldentey, J; Gazulla, J; Gutierrez-Garcia, J; Huete-Anton, B; Lucas-Rodenas, C; Luquin, M R; Martinez-Torres, I; Medialdea-Natera, P; Mendoza-Rodriguez, A; Mir-Rivera, P; Posada, I J; Ruiz-Martinez, J; Sanchez-Alonso, P; Trejo-Gabriel Y Galan, J M; Vela, L; Pena-Segura, J L\n\n2018-03-01\n\nBotulinum toxin type A (BTA) is a bacterial endotoxin, whose therapeutic use has had a dramatic impact on different neurological disorders, such as dystonia and spasticity.
