        "text": "Posted at http://community.sigames.com/showthread.php/212972-FM10-Makonnen-s-World?p=6673632#post6673632\n\nWith two clubs well into their offseason, January whirls by seeing a charge up the table by Chelsea, a record streak ending in Ethiopia, and continued mediocrity in Italy. Still, a good time to look back at 2010, including annual reviews of NASL, NACL,NADI, and NADII as well as an overview of the World, North American, and Continental awards handed out for the past year.\n\nChelsea / Cameroon\n\nIt would have been hard for 2011 to begin much better for Chelsea: January saw them go 6-0 in the league, outscoring their opponents 18-1 and culminating in a tense but decisive 2-0 win over Manchester United. After defeating Wigan 2-1 in the third round of the FA Cup, Walsall was the victim of a 4-0 thrashing in the fourth.\n\nEven with the match against Walsall, Chelsea boss Danyil Oranje resisted temptation to rush young starlet Leigh Musicek, allowing her to continue her development with the Under-18s, where she was elected captain in their most recent match (albeit largely by default). In other non-first team news, there was more than a modicum of celebration when it Oranje learned ofMarco van Basten’s firing by Tottenham.\n\nChelsea was relatively quiet on the transfer front, despite bringing in roughly a dozen youth players. The only name signing was Danish international Michael Larsen, lured away from Twente for $11M; however Chelsea is Larsen’s third club this year, so the nineteen year old will be ineligible for league play until next season. With the influx of bodies, eleven players were sent out on loan with Gaël Kakuta, Yaya Sanogo, and Matej Delac going overseas and the other eight remaining in England.\n\nFebruary brings a harder league schedule, with Fulham, Everton, and Arsenal among the five domestic opponents; however Preston North End should provide very little opposition, other than the weight of history, in the 5th round of the FA Cup. The first leg of knockout play in the UEFA Cup looms as well, with Chelsea travelling to face Ajax towards the end of the month.\n\nComets / Costa Rica U20s\n\nDead quiet off-season in Houston. The only news was Levi McKinnon being linked momentarily to the opening at Tottenham. Other than that, the Comets are just waiting through the offseason, unable to really prepare for the year until their financial budgets are clarified.\n\nRacing Club\n\nAn absolutely quiet month in Haiti. The only news was a minor signing of a teenage defender—and there is not likely to be much news from Port-au-Prince for another month or so.\n\nRodengo Saiano\n\nNo new injuries, and a 1-2-1 record. Meh. That summarizes the month and Terry Langford’s reactions as well. Surely, such mediocrity was a key factor in his apparent choice to leave Italy at the end of the year for North America. Now, whether that decision stands after his squad returns to full strength—and if they find a way to win a few games—is yet to be seen.\n\nThe problem on the field is obvious: while tied with Sambonifacese for the 2nd stingiest defense in Serie C2/A, the Pandas have managed only 13 goals in 22 games. Off the field, chairman Alessandro Ferrari has added some more cash to the coffers, but the club is still bleeding money.\n\nSaint George\n\nIt was a rough, rough month in Ethiopia’s capital. Not only did the forty-six unbeaten run in the league come to a shocking endwith a 1-0 loss to lowly Adama City, but it was followed by two more league losses before V were able to right the ship 3-1 against Nyala. Since the losses, Saint George has looked better but still not back to form: their three victories in Group A of the Addis Cup were each by a single score against much weaker teams.\n\nStill, the biggest news may have been off the pitch, where V’s best player, seventeen year old Mohammed Abera, was signed by German Bundesliga club Hoffenheim with the transfer taking effect in July. While this was expected at some point, the timing could not be worse for a club teetering on the edge of crisis.\n\nFor all that, Saint George close the month atop the league table by two points over Banks SC and look safe to qualify in the Addis Cup. Assuming their depth can hold, the continued good form of Bereket Addisu and Fitsum Kebede, along with the return of Abera and Liban Elmi from injury, should allow for at least the possibility of a return to form.\n\nFebruary has twelve games on the schedule: four in the league, three in Addis Cup group play (with more anticipated at the conclusion of that round of play), the second leg of the RASS quarterfinal against Al-Ahly, the first two games of group play in the All African Challenge, and a home and home affair with African Stars in the African Champions League Preliminary Round.\n\nElsewhere\n\nJanuary means transfers, and the windows across Europe were quite busy. The two most expensive signings were transfers between Italian clubs, with Napoli laying out just over $50M to Palermo for Simon Kjær and Genoa spending $47M for Udinese’sAlexis Sánchez. Napoli added another $25M for Köln’s Brazilian defender Geromel while Shakhtar spent just under $70M for three Brazilians: Sandro and Taison from Internacional and Felipe from Udinese. Udinese—trapped in the middle of the Serie A table—received over $100M in income during the month, also moving Juan Guillermo Cuadrado to Juventus and Ghanaian youngster Kwadwo Asamoah to Manchester United.\n\nWhile Asamoah may be the most important British signing, he was well down the list in terms of cost which was topped by Aston Villa’s $21.5M purchase of Ismaël Bangoura from Stade Rennais. Manchester City brought young Dutch winger Ibrahim Afellay into the fold for $21M and Fulham picked up Burnley’s Steven Fletcher for $20M.\n\nTottenham, still struggling to climb up the table, fired Marco van Basten (and replaced him with Hans Backe) and brought in two players, Congolese attacker Chris Malonga and Spanish defender Javier Garrido.\n\nFletcher was one of the few transfers that stayed within England. The only other transfers between English teams in excess of $5M were Niko Kranjkar moving from Tottenham to Manchester United, Armand Traoré from Arsenal to Manchester City,Titus Bramble from Wigan to Middlesbrough, and Simon Poulsen from Tottenham to Aston Villa.\n\nA quick look around the major European leagues:\n\nEngland. Chelsea and Manchester City are tied atop the table with Middlesbrough, Portsmouth, and West Brom facing relegation.\n\nFrance. OM up by 3 points over Paris Saint-Germain, with FC Metz, Stade Rennais, and FC Nantes at the bottom.\n\nGermany. Stuttgart leads HSV by a point, with Werder Bremen and FC Bayern in the race as well. Kaiserslautern is struggling just above Bochum and Mainz to avoid relegation.\n\nHolland. Perennial champion Ajax leads FC Twente by 3.\n\nPortugal. Braga leads Benfica by seven points.\n\nSpain. The expected three horse race is emerging: Barcelona leads Atletico Madrid by three and Real Madrid by five.\n\n2010 at the bottom of the North American pyramid was marked by extremes. At the positive end, the Rochester Rhinos dominated the Yashin Conference, earning 65 of a possible 72 points with 21 wins and only a single loss in their league play. Fans of Mérida FC will complain their team had an even better year by going undefeated in their 22 games; however, the Mexican side was held to a draw six times. Similarly, the Vancouver Whitecaps—with a single loss against them all year—would normally be the talk of the league, but in 2010 the Canadians faded into a distant third among the top teams.\n\nAt the other end, perhaps predictably, Haiti and Cuba continued to be the most difficult locations for home sides to find winning ways in North American soccer: Cienfuegos failed to gain a single victory in the league, while fellow Cuban side Villa Clara and Haitian minnows Violette managed only two each during their long seasons.\n\nThe promotion playoffs were dominated by teams from the Maradona Conference, which saw all four of their playoff participants promoted into NADI for next year. As such, AC St. Louis and Real Miami are both underdogs to survive at the higher level, while X. Tijuana and FC Chicago—both with over 50 points in the regular season—will be quite disappointed to spend 2011 again in the fourth level of play.\n\nThe misery ran especially deep at X. Tijuana, who boasted the league MVP in Alejandro Leyva and the only offense in NADII to score more than fifty goals on the year. But Albuquerque—who had faded dramatically at the end of the season—managed a goal in extra time from their veteran leader William Thompson to unseat the Mexican side. Still, the assumption has to be that, if the finances hold up, X. Tijuana will be among the favorites for promotion in 2011.\n\nIndividual play was dominated by Nashville’s veteran striker Josh Russell, who found the back of the net 19 times on the year, besting Houston’s Felix Garcia and Santa Fe’s Ricardo Flores by five. Nashville was unable to overcome their defensive woes however, and didn’t even make the playoffs, while both the Comets and the Red Devils both succeeded in gaining promotion.\n\nAwards in NADII were handed out as follows:\n\nKeeper of the Year. Scott Vallow (Rochester), Adrián Zermeño (X. Tijuana), Diego (Vancouver).\n\nDefender of the Year. Scott Jones (Vancouver), Marco Reda (Vancouver), Armando Gallegos (X.
