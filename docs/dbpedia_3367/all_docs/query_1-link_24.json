But in today's constantly connected world, it's easy to find yourself glued to your phone, checking work emails, and feeling anything but relaxed. In this post, our HR team offers you three key tips to help you truly disconnect from work during your vacation. #HRTips #Careers #TheRightPlaceToBe\n\nSTIGA’s investment in sport continues because teamwork and a winning mentality are as important in business as they are in a soccer game. We are excited to show you what has happened this month during the SK Rapid vs. AC Milan match in Austria. Our electric tractors and autonomous robotic mowers were shown on the 240-metre LED screen at the Vienna West Stadium, reaching thousands of fans and viewers on ORF, the Austrian national public broadcaster. What's next? Europa League qualification on August the 1st, at 8:30pm. Stay tuned and look up for STIGA! #WeAreSTIGA #CorporateValues #CorporateCulture #STIGAAustria\n\nAnother step towards continuous improvement for STIGA! Our Lean & Process Engineering team, after achieving the MTM technical certification from the MTM Association, is completing the second step of practicum with UAS (Universal Analyzing System) and EAWS (Ergonomic Assessment Worksheet) certifications. The course, integrated with a plan to unify Work Analysis and Process Engineering, will elevate even more the team’s work method according to the highest standards. #WeAreStiga #CorporateCulture #Innovation\n\nSTIGA is committed to progressively replacing petrol-powered products with battery-powered alternative machines, with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of its products sold in the market. STIGA robot mowers are part of this vision. Have a look at our full range here: https://lnkd.in/dUszkdrg With zero gas emissions, STIGA Robots help reducing air and noise pollution, and help cultivate a healthier lawn. Robots trim a little at a time, which is less stressful for the grass than bigger cuts and nourish the soil by leaving the tiny clippings to mulch into the soil. #STIGATechnology #Innovation #NatureBasedSolutions #SmartHomes\n\nGetting the right level of detail is crucial for success in any task.

June was a special month for the Marketing department. Part of the HQ’s team travelled to Germany to meet Nico Dietsch and his wife Bianca from the dealer Kortenbrede GmbH.
