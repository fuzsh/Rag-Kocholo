        "text": "Navigating the journey toward securing an internship for my graduation project as a fashion communication student has been a unique challenge. While my portfolio spans diverse roles, I acknowledge that I may not be a specialist compared to peers with more focused majors. Balancing academic excellence, portfolio development, and the quest for a promising internship with a substantial stipend in a metropolitan city is no easy feat. I understand the hiring process is intricate, and HR teams have their hands full with numerous applications. However, it's disheartening when substantial assignments with tight deadlines are added to the mix, only to be met with silence afterward. The pressure intensifies, making it crucial to share these experiences openly. To fellow students facing similar challenges, you're not alone in this journey. Let's navigate these hurdles together, acknowledging the complexities while staying resilient and focused on our goals. #InternshipJourney #FashionCommunication #CareerChallenges Ps - The picture is with my great team from my summer internship at SocialPanga\n\nHow did I get into the Bioscience Forum for a research internship? This was my road map to the internship : 1. Compiled a comprehensive list of bioscience labs and projects. 2. Identified and highlighted labs aligning with my expertise and interests. 3. Revamped CV to spotlight relevant skills despite minimal bioscience experience. 4. Emailed applications to research heads, followed up persistently. 5. Secured 10 interviews en route to the final opportunity. 6. Showcased qualitative research skills in the final interview, highlighting potential contributions as an intern. I submitted applications to approximately 50 labs and projects worldwide, meeting the qualifications for 10 of them. As a result, I received two substantial internship offers for the previous summer period If you're interested in learning more about securing an internship or need help with your CV, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm here and happy to assist however I can! #research #qualitativeresearch #internship #stemcareers\n\nHi everyone, My name is Annika de Munnik, a second-year student pursuing a degree in Business Administration at the Erasmus University Rotterdam. I am actively seeking a full-time internship opportunity abroad for my upcoming third year, starting around August/September and extending through the end of the year. I am flexible with the duration and even willing to extend into my summer break to make the most of the opportunity. My primary interests revolve around marketing and sales. However, I am open to explore alternative fields of interests that are linked to international business. I have attached my CV and an internship summary outlining the requirements. If you or anyone you know has oppurtunities that align with my ambitions, feel free to send me a message! #internship #business #international\n\nMe with short hair? In a band? Surely not! But yes, I was exploring. I figured short hair and rock bands were not for me. Same as the 2 internships I did at the UN: in Geneva and in London. The UN? Not for me. Teens and young adults need to explore, try out, figure out if it sticks. Not just with haircuts, but with problems they want to solve, technologies they want to use. How are you (or your ambitious student) exploring problems and technologies, mindsets and habits outside school now? #coachingambitiousstudents #buildyourT #findyourintersection\n\nGreetings connections, I m thrilled to share my successful completion of the 45 day internship at ORVI During this transformative period, I had the privilege of working closely with the Sales and Marketing team, diving into exciting projects, and gaining invaluable skills. Key Learnings: 1. Conducted comprehensive #market #research, identifying over 70 potential clients for the #company. 2. Created detailed reports summarising exported container data — a crucial aspect of logistics and #international trade 4. I flawlessly created a compelling PowerPoint presentation for a client, showcasing the requested #products, #pricing, and #features. Additionally, I designed a #presentation that meticulously detailed the packaging process for a bulk order, ensuring clarity and #efficiency in every step. 6. Accompanied the inspection team from a #client company, keenly observing the inspection process. Learning firsthand about quality control and #attention to detail. 7. From client needs to CAD #software, I explored the end-to-end #design process, #witnessing the magic of turning ideas into reality. 8. Explored social media marketing and e-commerce strategies and even tackled an #SEO project. 9. Delved into #graphic design and product #photography, appreciating the aesthetics that #enhance #brand identity. People Power: The heart of any workplace lies in its people. I'm immensely grateful to my mentors—the B2B Sales Head, E-Commerce Head, and Vice President—for their guidance. They taught me not only the technical aspects but also the art of effective #communication. Conversations with plant workers, office staff, and clients shaped my understanding of #workplace #dynamics. Building Relationships: #Maintaining healthy #relationships was paramount. The camaraderie with colleagues made this internship truly special. Their encouragement, #constructive #feedback, and friendship fuelled my #growth. Thank you, ORVI for this incredible opportunity. Looking forward to applying these learnings in my future endeavours! #internship #internshipjourney #summerinternship #learningexperience #student #collegestudents #opportunities #collegelife #university #experience #praise #happy #corporatelife #exposure\n\nTODAY Jobbsprånget internship application round opens I have participated three times. Each time one of my partner SMEs in my innovation ecosystem have joined. This means that our innovation ecosystem concept aligns with competence needs. This round I have internship activity at ALMINICA AB towards sustainable manufacturing activities in advanced materials. The intership activity is rewarding for both candidates as well as companies. Company? Get in touch with me if you want me to share my experience. There are SYNERGIES if you do this in a smart way. There is so much competence and experience with those in this programme. Some of them just have not got the opportunity. Seven out ten get a job after. About half at the internship place, about half at another place because there is reference. It is useful even if we can not employ as start-up or SME with insufficient funding in this year. And later we can collaborate in some years. It builds network. Many good things! One step in will create many steps to go! This will grow the Swedish industry and wellfare. Do it, do it. Requirements for the internship: ✔ College/University graduate born outside of Europe ✔ a valid working permit (NOT a student visa) ✔ Good English language skills ✔ Registered at Arbetsförmedlingen ✔ Degree in Engineering, IT, Architecture, Science, Pharmacy or, HR/Business/Finance, etc. www.jobbspranget.se - #manufacturing #siliconcarbide #sustainability #jobleap #jobbspranget #skills #internship #compatence #advancedmaterials #recruitment\n\n#CompanyInfoSession Ruhlamat is from Germany and has nearly 60 years of manufacturing experience.
