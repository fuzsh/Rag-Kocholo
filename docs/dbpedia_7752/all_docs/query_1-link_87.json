It accumulated this artificial collection of brief manuscript files over the years. The files pertain largely to individuals, and also to organizations, events and topics, and contain correspondence, manuscripts and typescripts, as well as a few items of printed ephemera.",

        "text": "The Tamiment Library, a special collection documenting the history of United States radicalism, labor, and progressive social action, accumulated this artificial collection of brief manuscript files over the course of its early existence. The files pertain largely to individuals, and also to organizations, events and topics, and correspondence, manuscripts and typescripts, as well as some items of printed ephemera. While most of the individuals and organizations were active in the United States, there are also files for a number of prominent European and other foreign figures and organizations represented.\n\nThe collection consists largely of correspondence to and from important figures in American and European radical and labor movements, among them Angela Balabanoff, Clarence Darrow, Karl Marx, Eugene V. Debs, Fredrick Engels, J. Keir Hardie, Darlington Hoopes, Samuel Gompers and Leon Trotsky. Some letters from the files of the Tamiment Library to and from researchers are also part of the collection.\n\nAlso included in the collection are a significant number of typescripts and manuscripts (some in the form of photocopies) by political and literary figures such as David Ben-Gurion, Earl Browder, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Jack London and Mark Twain.\n\nEphemeral items include a receipt for a payment to V. I. Lenin in Switzerland, two documents from the French Revolution, a manifesto signed by Emiliano Zapata and early nineteenth century British broadsides. Handwritten Russian-language newsletters circulated by Palmer Raid deportees known as the \"Ellis Island Bulletins\" are also included in the collection.\n\nThe provenance of much of the material is unknown; the bulk of it was given to or generated by staff of the Tamiment Library in its early years, before the Library was transferred.\n\nThe materials that comprise Box 8, Folders 17 and 18 were found in the repository and added to the collection in 2014. The accession number associated with these materials is 2014.039."
