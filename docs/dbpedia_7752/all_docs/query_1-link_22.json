We are learning some basic homesteading, and loving life here in Eatonville.\n\nEducation: Graduated with honors in 1995 from Eatonville HS, completed some college at SPSCC but a professional career moved more swiftly than schooling and received a different kind of education that has lent itself to both personal and professional growth.\n\nProfessional Experience: Currently working as an Sr. HR Digital Consultant for the 6th largest, not-for-profit healthcare system, Providence St. Joseph Health. Their focus on serving our communities, especially our most poor and vulnerable populations, has what kept me there for the last 12+ years. Their philosophy of servitude is what not only drew me to be a part of the EFA board but allowed me an opportunity to serve in some of the remotest villages in Guatemala as well as volunteering at our skilled nursing facilities.\n\nPersonal: I spent most of my youth in Eatonville, spending summers up at the lake with friends and making sure we returned home 'when the street lights came on.' After about a 10-year hiatus away; I returned after having kids of my own with the confidence this tight-knit community was something they could benefit from as well. I have 2 boys of my own while having the privilege of being a part of 3 bonus kids, thanks to a blended family. Three of the five graduated from EHS, with our last one currently in middle school. I love getting outside, whether it's on a trail or a run through town, traveling with the family to new places and checking off national parks as we go. Even as I get up in years, I still love to compete and have spent almost a dozen years playing in the co-ed volleyball league in town. Digging in the dirt is like therapy as is testing new things in the kitchen- anything that essentially allows me to create.\n\nThe four of us graduated from Eatonville High School. After high school, I left for Spokane where I met my wife Laura at Gonzaga University. My wife and I met while I was working and she volunteering for a mentoring program in Spokane connecting Gonzaga students with disadvantaged middle school students. We returned to western Washington where I completed medical school at the University of Washington. During medical school, I volunteered for an organization of health professional students which operated a free clinic and worked to advocate for underserved populations in the Seattle area. In 2009, we moved to Tacoma for three years of residency at Tacoma Family Medicine. In 2010, we had our first daughter Ida. We returned to Eatonville in 2012 where I began work at the MultiCare Eatonville Clinic as a family doctor. In 2013, our second daughter Mae was born. We are now settled in Eatonville and are fortunate to be near our families who we see regularly. We look forward to supporting the Eatonville Family Agency in the work of providing critical services to families in our community who are in need."
