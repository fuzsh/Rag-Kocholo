Patel, MD, MSPH, MSHS\n\nJonathan Butler, Phd, MDiv\n\nAbby Cabrera, MPH\n\nLaura Schmidt, PhD, MSW, MPH\n\nRoberto Ariel Vargas, MPH\n\nUCSF’s Community Engagement resources were deployed for more than a decade to create a lasting impact toward Chronic Disease Equity. Via Collective Impact, we shaped health policy and the built environment, improved access to healthy foods in low-income communities, and created the largest source of funds for community-based organizations to engage in work that helped increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, reduce consumption of sugary drinks, and increase consumption of public drinking water, among other important things. Join us for a panel discussion about what we learned about Collective Impact and partnership along the way, how the pandemic has threatened progress, and what opportunities lie ahead for community-university partnerships for health and UCSF.\n\nVanessa Bohm, MPH is the director of CARECEN SF’s Family Wellness and Health Promotion programs. She was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area by immigrant parents. She holds a B.A. in Psychology and an M.A. in Ethnic Studies. She has worked with Latinx and low-income families for more than twenty years, providing direct services and program management in the areas of family and youth support, health education and promotion. She has used her knowledge and experience to develop staff capacity, enhance program activities, and build partnerships that more effectively advocate, support, and improve the health and wellbeing of Latinx and low-income communities living in San Francisco. She has also dedicated much of her work to supporting the development of community health workers (promotoras de salud) to address health disparities in the Latinx community, such as chronic and diet-sensitive diseases and children’s oral health.

However, the culture of family medicine does not always recognize or embrace this potential, at least in part due to the perception that research is inherently disconnected from the immediate needs of the communities we serve. In this session, five family medicine physicians who conduct research on a range of topics and using a range of methodologies will discuss their paths to becoming clinician researchers, and how their identity as a family physician interrelates with and informs their identity as a researcher. They will further reflect on the relationship of their research, and of research in general, to our departmental mission to advance health equity.\n\nChristine Dehlendorf, MD, MAS, is a Professor and Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, with additional appointments in the Departments of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences and Epidemiology and Biostatistics. She founded and directs the Person-Centered Reproductive Health Program, which aims to advance reproductive autonomy and well-being by conducting research and designing programs that center people’s experiences and preferences for sexual and reproductive health and health care, guided by an attention to the intersecting oppressions and structural injustices that impact people’s lives and health.

Residents of the Tenderloin (San Francisco’s most diverse neighborhood) and Dr. Monica Hahn (FCM) will be in dialogue with each other and with you, discussing strategies for creating effective, supportive collaborations for institutional and structural change at UCSF. We began this work in 2021, amid the chaos of COVID and discovered in the process what it looks like to mutually honor the experiences of those struggling to access care and those juggling inequitable resources and burnout as they provided care. We will tell you the history of this project, how it supports our work as community and healthcare advocates, and how you can find your place in similar communities of change agents.\n\nShavonne Allen, Skywatchers Ensemble, San Francisco Artist and Resident, is a community leader whose creative talents bring light to the needs of the community and uplifts the talents of all.\n\nSam Dennison, Faithful Fools, Tenderloin Resident, is a community advocate who challenges UCSF to deepen community partnerships with unlikely allies for deep institutional change.\n\nFreddy Martin, Congregational Life & Community Engagement Manager Glide Memorial Church, Skywatcher, whose depth of commitment brings people together and knits community threads into vibrant patterns.\n\nMonica Hahn, MD, MPH, MA, AAHIVS, Associate Clinical Professor at UCSF in the Department of Family & Community Medicine and OBGYN, is a valued community collaborator and liaison between UCSF and community residents who opens UCSF doors to otherwise unheard community voices.\n\nFebruary 2, 2024 - Preparing the Next Generation of Leaders and Change Agents\n\nKatherine Mathews, MD, MPH, MBA\n\nIn this Grand Rounds presentation, Dr. Mathews will discuss strategies for training medical students to be leaders and change agents in medicine and society at large. Many medical students bring passion to our profession and are often distressed to learn about the entrenched structural inequities within the US health care system. This combination of passion and distress can lead students to jump to solutions that have the potential to do more harm than good. By focusing on self-awareness, moral humility, perspective taking, teamwork, and cultivating a \"lifelong learner\" mindset, Dr. Mathews prepares students for leadership as a long-term endeavor that is best done in partnership with others. She will review both opportunities and challenges with this approach.\n\nKatherine Mathews, MD, MPH, MBA, is an Ob/gyn physician with a background in international work, healthcare administration, and public health.

In California, despite an overall decline in the numbers behind bars in the last decade, the number of people age 55 and older has nearly doubled. Studies have shown that the chronic disease burden and degree of functional impairment of incarcerated people is similar to those 10-15 years older in the community as more and more older adults are facing the prospect of aging, coping with serious illness and dying in prison. How do we, as a society and as clinician advocates better meet the needs of this aging population pre-sentencing, during incarceration and upon reentry?\n\nMichele DiTomas, MD, MS is currently the Chief Medical Executive over the Palliative Care Initiative with the California Correctional Healthcare Services, which strives to improve whole person care for those struggling with the challenges of serious illness and aging behind bars.

This \"Gender Affirming Care\" can include medical or surgical care to align one's body with their identified gender, as well as access to a full scope of medical care that is respectful and culturally grounded, and acknowledges gender identities as valid. Recent political developments have added an additional layer of complexity to the barriers to care and disparities faced by this vulnerable population. In this talk, Dr. Deutsch will review current evidence in selected areas of gender affirming care for children, adolescents, and adults of all ages.\n\nMaddie Deutsch, MD, MPH is a Professor of Clinical Family & Community Medicine at UCSF, and the founding Medical Director for the UCSF Gender Affirming Health Program, a multidisciplinary group of medicine, surgical, and behavioral health providers for trans and gender expansive adults at UCSF Health.

There is a current political struggle in the US over the meanings of \"race,\" \"racism,\" and \"wokeness.\" In this presentation,\" I argue that defining \"health\" is a radical idea. The meaning of health has profound implications for how we organize research, healthcare, and ultimately society. For this reason, our nation has avoided defining health. This definitional void yields a default disease-based biomedical definition of health. The consequences of this default definition are profound: 1) enabling research and healthcare funding that supports the biomedical-industrial-healthcare complex; 2) obscuring deeper meanings of health equity; 3) trivialization of social determinants of health 4) marginalization of primary care; 5) contributing to unprecedented declines in national health, wellbeing; and 6) perpetuation of gross inequities in health. The concept of health has profound implications for what it means to be human, to care for self and others, and for the social conditions that enable people to optimize their full health potential. We need a national dialogue on the meaning of health and critically how to enable it through research, healthcare, and societal change.\n\nKevin is a tenured professor in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. He is co-director of the department research division and co-director of the equity-focused dissemination and implementation core within the University of Rochester Clinical and Transnational Science Institute.

Kevin is currently leading a scoping review for AcademyHealth on equity and value in US healthcare and a NASEM-commissioned review of trends in racial and ethnic inequities in healthcare access and quality in the US.\n\nMay 5, 2023 - The Present Illness: American Health Care and Its Intractable Afflictions\n\nMartin Shapiro, MD, PhD, MPH\n\nDrawing on the analyses in his recent book, The Present Illness: American Health Care and Its Afflictions, Dr. Shapiro will explore the reasons why it has been so difficult to solve the many problems in American health care. He identifies three underlying phenomena that shape the behavior of physicians and their organizations, medical schools and their faculty, hospitals and health systems, other corporations in the health sector, scientists and their sponsors, and also patients and the public. These are the commodification of health care and health by all the groups of participants; the consciousness of the actors—their attitudes, values, expectations, interests, and perceived needs; and the communication and the structure of the relationships across these groups, which tend to reinforce the worst tendencies in all groups. He will discuss a range of steps that can be taken to address these many problems, but that meaningful reform will need to be broad and deep.\n\nDr. Martin Shapiro obtained his medical degree from McGill University and a PhD in history and Master’s in Public Health from UCLA. He is Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell and Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Medicine and Public Health at UCLA. Prior to coming to Cornell, he spent many years at UCLA, where he was chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research for 25 years.

His new book, The Present Illness: American Health Care and Its Afflictions, has just been published by Johns Hopkins University Press.\n\nApril 7, 2023 - Demoralization in Medicine with a focus on Strategies and Solutions\n\nMegan Mahoney, MD\n\nChanges in the health care system have altered the nature of primary care clinician’s interactions with patients and our sense of empowerment to improve the practice environment. Profound health disparities have caused disillusionment and dwindling faith in the systems for which we work. Strategies and solutions lie in the fact that we are internally motivated when we believe in what we are doing and feel part of a community. The objective of this presentation is to review the evolution of demoralization in medicine and discuss evidence for coalition-building to drive change and restore wellbeing.\n\nDr. Megan Mahoney is the Hellman Endowed Professor and Chair in the UCSF Department of Family and Community Medicine. Throughout her career, Dr. Mahoney has built and led sustainable initiatives in provider engagement, quality improvement, and DEI for health care organizations.

In fact, many health problems can be firmly linked to a political action or inaction (Dawes, 2020). Our political system has not always valued each group equally much less realized the long-term implications of policies on the health of its citizenry. Conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play, can have a wide range effect of health risks and outcomes (CDC, 2021).\n\nHowever, the real instigators or drivers of these unjust and inequitable outcomes, are the Political Determinants of Health (PDoH) which involve the systematic process of structuring relationships, distributing resources and administering power, operating simultaneously in ways that mutually reinforce or influence one another to shape opportunities that either advance health equity or exacerbate health inequities (Dawes, 2020). These determinants and drivers are what have given way to racism and health inequity in America which remain to be addressed. Before we can begin to look beyond to a more equitable America, we must first understand the foundational nature of the political determinants of health’s and their systemic influence and structural concretization i.e. the “isms” plaguing the United States. Equally paramount, is to offer novel solutions including policies, that will forge a path towards recovery and ultimately, advancing health equity for all.\n\nDaniel E. Dawes, J.D., is a widely respected healthcare and public health leader, health policy expert, educator, and researcher who serves as executive director of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute at Morehouse School of Medicine and a professor of health law, policy and management. A trailblazer and nationally respected voice in the health equity movement, his scholarship and leadership, particularly the innovative political determinants of health framework that he pioneered, have resulted in increased policies and laws prioritizing health equity. By tackling upstream determinants of health, he has ventured into such uncharted territory as the intersection between equity and the social and political determinants of health to change the course of domestic and global policies for the better.\n\nHis groundbreaking works, 150 Years of ObamaCare, which document the health equity movement in America and elevates the health equity-focused provisions of the Affordable Care Act that he led in negotiations and formulation, and The Political Determinants of Health, which provides an in-depth lens on the root causes of inequities, both published by Johns Hopkins Press are now nationally and internationally recognized and used as top health policy books. His passion for addressing health inequities is exemplified in his unyielding commitment to building collaboratives, including the HHS grant-funded National COVID-19 Resiliency Network and the Health Equity Leadership & Exchange Network, both exist to leverage evidence-based research and develop actionable solutions to advance health equity.\n\nProfessor Dawes’ work focuses on health reform, health equity, mental/behavioral health inequities, social and political determinants of health, poverty, and health system transformation. His work bridges research, technology, healthcare, population health and public health – the translation of research discoveries into all communities, including under-resourced, vulnerable, and marginalized communities. Professor Dawes brings a forward-thinking, inclusive, and multidisciplinary approach to address issues impacting diverse populations in urban and rural communities in our progressively complex health system, including a national study examining the health and economic impact of mental health inequities in the United States and a major research project which created the nation’s first health equity tracker. Among his many achievements, he was an instrumental figure in developing and negotiating the Mental Health Parity Act, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act, and an architect of the Affordable Care Act’s health equity-focused provisions, among other landmark federal policies.\n\nProfessor Dawes is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine and an elected fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine.

The capacity to systematically identify and incorporate patient life context into medical decision making has been described as the process of contextualizing care. Based on an analysis of over 500 unannounced standardized patient simulations and 7000 audio recorded clinical encounters over the course of more than a decade, Dr. Weiner’s team has characterized the skills required to contextualize care, measured their effect on patient outcomes and health care costs, tested various strategies for teaching the skills and measuring performance, and established a contextualizing care QI program at several VA medical centers. His presentation will provide an overview of this work.\n\nSaul Weiner, MD, is professor of medicine, pediatrics, and medical education at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and deputy director of the research Center of Innovation for Complex Chronic Health Care at the Veterans Health Administration. His research on contextualization of care has been supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs (Health Services Research & Development), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the National Board of Medical Examiners. Dr. Weiner is the University of Illinois at Chicago 2013 Distinguished Researcher of the Year in the Clinical Sciences. He has served as medical education dean, university vice provost, and currently as senior advisor to the provost. His book, Listening for What Matters: Avoiding Contextual Errors in Health Care, published by Oxford University Press, received the 2017 American Publishers Award for Professional & Scholarly Excellence in the Life Sciences from the American Association of Publishers. His latest book is On Becoming a Healer: The Journey from Patient Care to Caring About Your Patients, published by Johns Hopkins University Press (April 2020).\n\nFor those of you interested in this body of work and its clinical and research implications, here is a new “fireside chat” series of short videos on contextualizing care:\n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9-b6XZZMupzmVuuwn1Ipph0dpI1fxx2d\n\nOctober 1, 2021 - “Should We Screen for and Document Social Risk in Health Care Settings?”\n\nScreening for adverse social determinants of health, or social risk factors, is becoming increasingly common in health care settings. This screening is supported by multiple professional societies, including the AAFP, AAP and ACP. There is growing evidence to support activities to identify and intervene on patient social risk factors, with the goal of improving patient health, wellness, and health equity. Researchers from UCSF SIREN will discuss 1) the acceptability of social risk screening from the perspective of patients and caregivers of pediatric patients, and 2) current screening activities at UCSF and ZSFG.\n\nDr. Emilia De Marchis is a family physician and health services researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. Her research is based out of the UCSF Social Intervention Research & Evaluation Network (SIREN), where she works to assess and improve how we screen for and address social risk factors within health care settings. Dr. De Marchis co-directs coursework through the UCSF Implementation Science Training program, Partnerships for Research in Implementation Science for Equity (PRISE) Center. She uses implementation science methods to focus on moving research on social risk screening, assistance and adjustment activities into real-world settings. Her clinical work is based out of the UCSF Family Medicine Center at Lakeshore. Through her research and clinical practice, she hopes to advance the health care system’s integration of patient social risk data to provide high quality, patient-centered preventative health care, to reduce health disparities. Dr. De Marchis received her MD from Stanford University, and her MAS in Clinical Research and Certificate in Implementation Science from UCSF.\n\nDr. Matt Pantell is an Assistant Professor at UCSF, where his research is conducted with the UCSF Center for Health and Community, the UCSF Social Interventions Research and Evaluation Network, and the UCSF Preterm Birth Initiative. His research focuses on the utility of incorporating social information into clinical decision making, addressing social needs in clinical settings, data mining and the analysis of large datasets, and biological manifestations of the social determinants of health. Clinically, Dr. Pantell works is as a pediatric hospitalist at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital - Mission Bay and Washington Hospital in Fremont. He also works as a pediatric urgent care physician and runs the Tattoo Removal Clinic at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.\n\nDr. Caroline Fichtenberg is the Managing Director of the Social Interventions Research and Evaluation Network (SIREN) and Research Scientist in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

She brings to these positions more than a decade of experience working to improve health and economic outcomes for America’s most vulnerable families, including seven years working on national efforts in Washington, DC. While Director of Research at the Children’s Defense Fund (CDF), she led the development of a report that identified nine federal policy changes that could reduce child poverty by 60 percent. As Director of Epidemiology and Planning at the Baltimore City Health Department, she oversaw the city’s first analysis of neighborhood health inequities that uncovered a 20-year gap in life expectancy between the richest and poorest neighborhoods of the city. Caroline also served as director of the Center for Public Health Policy at the American Public Health Association (APHA) and as Health Policy Advisor to Senator Harkin on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, where she promoted health in all policies approaches to improve health outcomes and reduce health inequities. She earned her Ph.D. in Epidemiology from Johns Hopkins University, an M.S. degree in Biology from Yale University and an A.B. in Molecular Biology from Princeton University.\n\nSeptember 3, 2021 - “Redefining Global Health through Structural Competency and Allyship”\n\nUnlike hypertension, the widely used term Global Health has very different meanings depending on where one stands: United States, Switzerland or Malawi. This highlights long standing differences in power and privilege, and the persistence of Global Health’s colonial roots. We however find ourselves in a time of opportunity to push for greater accountability and true partnership on the part of privileged countries and institutions. Doing so requires continuous self-study and the willingness to take personal and professional risks. We will discuss a structural competency framing of Global Health, and the challenges and rewards of pursuing true allyship as part of the larger struggle for dignity for all.\n\nSundeep K Gupta, MD, MPH, DTMTH, is a FCM faculty member at Natividad Medical Center; he is a past CDC Country Director for Uganda, Malawi and Zambia.
