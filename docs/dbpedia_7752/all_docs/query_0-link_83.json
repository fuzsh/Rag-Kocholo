        "text": "The Work Ahead\n\nThe Work Ahead\n\nBrennan Center staff are publishing books, developing research, and creating new policy — all aimed at building a more perfect union.\n\n1) Court Reform: Back on the Agenda\n\nDecades after President Donald Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell have left the political scene, their imprint on American life will be felt through the rulings of more than 230 new federal judges. But this stark remaking of the courts has only heightened a crisis long in progress, says Alicia Bannon, managing director of the Democracy Program. The changing of the guard in Washington brings an opportunity to ensure that the judiciary delivers justice and is seen as legitimate.\n\nWhy should Supreme Court reform be a priority?\n\nThe Court is supposed to be the last line of defense for holding our government accountable to the Constitution, protecting our rights, and making sure our democracy functions. In 2020, though, the Court made it harder to vote amid the pandemic — one of many instances in which it has rolled back rights.\n\nThese decisions come against the backdrop of a judicial confirmation process that has descended to the rawest kind of partisan constitutional hardball. Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed just about a week before Election Day, even though Senate Republicans had refused to consider filling Justice Scalia’s seat when it opened nearly nine months before the 2016 election.\n\nThis is more than just hypocrisy. It’s a crisis for the rule of law and for our democracy. Courts don’t have an army. What they have is their public legitimacy — the fact that people are willing to accept judicial decisions even when they vehemently disagree with them.\n\nThere is also a broader democratic legitimacy deficit on the Court. We appoint our judges through a political process so that there is a link between the Court and the values of our country. But this means that democracy deficits in our political system reverberate in the judiciary. For example, among the six conservative justices, all but Chief Justice Roberts were confirmed by senators who won their most recent elections with fewer votes in sum than the senators who voted against confirmation. This affects the Court in substantive ways; it is ideologically extreme and not aligned with either the public or the legal profession.\n\nWhat are some starting points for reform?\n\nIt’s best to start with the problems we’re trying to address. What packages of reforms respond to those concerns and reset the dynamic so we don’t have continued escalation around confirmations and so the Court is more stable, more representative, and more legitimate?\n\nOne place where reformers could start to address this is through the size of the Court. While expansion is often framed as a partisan move, it could be a component of a broader structural reform. Subsets of justices could hear cases in panels, as courts do in India, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Some uncertainty around who’s going to cast the deciding vote in any particular case would discourage the Court from pushing the legal envelope too far, and it would help lower the stakes — and hopefully the temperature — of confirmations.\n\nOn a lot of dimensions, the Court does not look like America or even the legal profession, and a larger court could open up opportunities for greater diversity in terms of education, professional background, geography, race, and ethnicity.\n\nAnother thing to look at is how vacancies get created. It’s become the norm for justices to time their retirements, waiting for a president who’ll appoint a like-minded successor. That doesn’t make any sense from the perspective of the Court’s legitimacy or the democratic process. Regular appointments — with every president getting two appointments every four years — are one way of introducing predictability into the process and taking away justices’ power to shape the Court’s future composition. Term limits are also responsive to this concern.\n\nHow should we look at district and circuit courts, where the vast majority of federal cases end?\n\nWe need a different approach to the nomination process, and we need pathways to the federal bench other than prosecutors’ offices and corporate law firms. Civil rights lawyers and public defenders are virtually absent from the bench right now. There’s also a stark lack of demographic diversity; nearly three-quarters of federal judges are white, and more than two-thirds are male.\n\nWe should also be thinking about how our system of justice is and isn’t working for people. Judge-made doctrines like qualified immunity have slammed the courthouse doors to those looking to hold police accountable for abuses. Laws like the 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act pose huge barriers to incarcerated people bringing civil rights cases. Congress should open up our courts so people can vindicate their rights.\n\nWhat can Biden and Congress accomplish on the courts?\n\nBiden has already signaled that he’s going to prioritize judicial nominations — and that he’s looking for nominees from diverse backgrounds, including civil rights lawyers. This is urgently needed to bring some balance to a judiciary that Trump has left a tremendous mark on.\n\nThe Supreme Court justices are the only judges in the country who don’t follow a code of conduct, and it’s telling that they have yet to adopt one. The For the People Act would require it. I also expect to see a push in Congress to add seats to the lower courts — something the judiciary says it needs to handle caseloads, which have grown tremendously. This has received bipartisan support in the past.\n\nHow does the judiciary fit into the broaderdemocracy reform agenda?\n\nSo many of the problems in our courts come from the fact that our political branches aren’t sufficiently representative of and responsive to the public. This makes it harder for the public to advocate for strong judicial nominees. It means that a lot of issues that should be addressed legislatively end up getting booted to the courts. And most consequentially, it means that Congress only rarely uses its power to undo harmful Supreme Court decisions, even though in many instances the Court has left that option open.\n\nCongress will have the chance to consider key legislation — the For the People Act and the Voting Rights Advancement Act. If we have a government that’s really by, for, and of the people, that will make the courts less important. That’s good news for the courts, and for all of us.\n\n2) Racial Justice: Perfecting the American Experiment\n\nTheodore R. Johnson is the director of the Brennan Center’s Fellows Program. His book, When the Stars Begin to Fall: Overcoming Racism and Renewing the Promise of America, will be published in 2021 by Grove Atlantic.\n\nYou are the first director of the Brennan Center’s Fellows Program. What’s your vision for the program going forward?\n\nI have two primary goals for the Fellows Program. The first is to bring new and diverse voices and perspectives that expand the reach of the Brennan Center’s core mission and look ahead to policy challenges that Americans must confront. For example, we’re bringing on a formerly incarcerated fellow to augment our policy work with the perspective of someone with lived experience in our nation’s correctional facilities.\n\nThe second is to focus on the necessity to reform our democratic culture. We need to ensure a citizenry that is properly equipped to participate in our democracy. Much of the Brennan Center’s work is necessarily aimed at protecting and defending our democracy’s systems and processes through executive, legislative, and judicial means. But if systemic reforms are paired with a disengaged or ill-prepared public, our democracy will not fulfill its potential. Our ability to achieve these goals will benefit from the input of a mix of fellows who collectively bring scholarship and an array of lived experiences and nontraditional career paths to bear.\n\nYou’ve also been a Brennan Center fellow for three years. What makes the program distinct?\n\nThere are few places where one can explore complicated topics and ideas, have the freedom to determine how best to pursue and share those ideas, and do so alongside the best legal minds working to reform our systems of democracy and justice. You can bring an entrepreneurial spirit and your personal experience to the work, pair it with rigorous scholarship, and build on the Brennan Center’s programmatic work to reach new audiences. Our current cohort of fellows have undertaken book projects, organized public events and symposia, conducted applied and theoretical research, written narrative essays, and contributed timely op-eds on current news to complement the organization’s work.\n\nThe time and space to be curious is invaluable. In my three years here, I’ve written not only a book, but also essays and op-eds for more than a dozen national newspapers and magazines on Black voting behavior as well as race relations in America writ large. And I’ve moderated talks with leading scholars, renowned authors and journalists, and politicians from Georgia’s Stacey Abrams to South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. The opportunity that the Fellows Program affords is extraordinary.\n\nYour book grapples with racism, arguably the most critical issue facing America, and does so with optimism. Tell us about it.\n\nThere are lots of books out that tackle various challenges resulting from structural racism, and the seriousness of the topic often leaves readers feeling pessimistic about our ability to confront them. My book doesn’t shy away from the immensity of the challenges, but it seeks to provide a pathway through so that the United States can manage the effects of structural racism.\n\nThe argument is pretty straightforward: racism is the primary obstacle to America’s living up to its professed ideals, and the only way to get past it is to instill a multiracial solidarity among Americans. It also argues that Black Americans’ historical experience in the United States provides lessons for what national solidarity should look like.\n\nThe book incorporates a wide reading of history, political science, and sociology as the foundation for its insights on how to create connections among the members of a diverse society. But it also includes deeply personal narratives to pair the scholarship with appeals to public sentiment. The book weaves this all together in a way that makes it accessible, engaging, and challenging all at once.\n\nA lot of your writing delves into your family’s and your own experiences with race and racism. What experiences in your life make you optimistic that national solidarity is possible?\n\nAlmost the entirety of my life has required not only that I live and work with different racial and economic groups, but that I invest in each of them. I grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, where my family was one of the few Black families in an overwhelmingly white neighborhood. I spent 20 years in the military, where I met, served with, and befriended Americans holding political ideologies across the spectrum. I went to a historically Black university for my undergraduate education and to graduate schools with students from very wealthy families.\n\nAll of the experiences and exposures demonstrated how very much the vast majority of Americans have in common. But it also exposed how dangerous it is when we are unable or unwilling to exit our comfort zones and engage the very people we need to create a true multiracial democracy. The American project requires we find ways to create connections with democratic strangers. It is hard and involved and resource intensive, but it is possible. And frankly, it is the only way to ensure that the nation endures.\n\nOne of the admirable things about your work is you practice what you preach. You’ve written for very conservative audiences. Can you tell us about the experience and the responses you get?\n\nThe only way to make progress on race relations is to engage different audiences with a range of worldviews. So I’ve never been shy about making my argument for racial equality to whoever is willing to engage. I’ve written to share aspects of the Black experience in school, the military, politics, and in America writ large. And I rely heavily on personal and historical anecdotes to bring political and sociological research to life.\n\nSome of the reception to my writing in conservative publications has been quite rough, as one might expect. But almost invariably, I receive comments or emails from readers who appreciate how the piece helped them see an issue differently or understand it more comprehensively.\n\nIf we are really serious about tackling structural racism, it’s going to require nearly all of us — not just across lines of race and ethnicity, but also across partisan and ideological divides. The whole of the American project is contingent on engaging one another and finding common ground. Right now, that isn’t happening as people become more and more polarized. But I hope my work can help people of good faith see they aren’t so different from one another.\n\n3) Fair Votes: Phasing Out the Electoral College\n\nThe undemocratic nature of the Electoral College is facing greater scrutiny. In two of the last six presidential elections, the system delivered the presidency to candidates who lost the popular vote. It encourages campaigns to focus on relatively few “battleground” states. And it dilutes the influence of voters of color. There are, however, efforts underway to phase it out. John F. Kowal, the Brennan Center’s vice president for programs, and Wilfred U. Codrington III, assistant professor of law at Brooklyn Law School and Brennan Center fellow, explore this movement — and a history of constitutional reforms that have expanded the scope of American democracy — in their book, The People’s Constitution, to be published in 2021 by The New Press.\n\nWhat did the 2020 election teach us about the Electoral College?\n\nJohn F. Kowal: Last year, Donald Trump treated the post–Election Day period as a sudden-death playoff, as if what had happened in the election itself didn’t matter. He lobbied state legislatures to disregard their own laws, and the will of the voters in their states, to appoint their own electors. That kind of behavior is made possible by this dangerous, outmoded, and absurd system of electing presidents.\n\nWhat makes the Electoral College incompatible with American values?\n\nWilfred U. Codrington III: The Electoral College undermines the fundamental ideal of political equality. That was one of the biggest blights in the Constitution from the start: there just was no ideal of equality. We know that about half of the men who created the Constitution were slave owners. We know that there were no women in the rooms where these decisions were made. It took a civil war to actually enshrine the notion of equality in the Constitution. The Electoral College was built on the ideas that 1) it’s the states and not the people that matter, and 2) only a certain segment of people have a voice. It was built on a lot of pretty awful compromises to thwart the idea of political equality.\n\nHow do the Electoral College’s racist origins continue to manifest today?\n\nCodrington: Every time there’s been a chance to reform or get rid of the Electoral College, it was race that was in the foreground, stopping change from occurring. After the disastrous 1800 election almost tore the country apart, there was a proposal by a Massachusetts congressman to institute a direct popular vote for president. But even he knew it wouldn’t be accepted because the three-fifths compromise gave southern states disproportionate representation. It created a political incentive to expand slavery.\n\nLater, in the 1960s and ’70s, when there was a real possibility of getting rid of the Electoral College and 80 percent of the country was behind that reform, it was the southern segregationists, led by Sen. Strom Thurmond, who thwarted that opportunity. He knew the Electoral College gave his bloc more clout in the South, where the majority of the country’s Black population resides. In a winner-take-all system, Black votes don’t matter, even where they make up a substantial minority.\n\nTrump and his enablers looked to invalidate votes in cities like Detroit and Philadelphia, and in Fulton and Dekalb Counties in Georgia — all places with high concentrations of Black people.\n\nDisenfranchising people of color is not even veiled at this point. But the 2020 election was determined by a popular vote margin of more than 7 million. Without the Electoral College, those schemes to try to overturn the will of the people would have been meaningless. Instead, what the Electoral College does is augment and aggrandize the divisive racial politics in the country.\n\nIs the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPV) an effective path to reform?\n\nCodrington: The ultimate reform would involve eliminating the Electoral College by constitutional amendment. In the meantime, the NPV is an interim reform that will hopefully push the country along.\n\nUnder the NPV, the participating states would award their electoral votes to whoever wins the national popular vote. Were 270 electoral votes’ worth of states and jurisdictions — the amount required to elect the president — to sign on to the agreement, you would have a de facto popular vote election. Since the NPV was conceived, 16 states and the District of Columbia have joined. That’s nearly 75 percent of the needed total.\n\nIn short, the NPV uses the current system to advance the ideal system. The idea is that the popular vote does not necessarily help Democrats or Republicans; it helps whoever wins the most votes. It encourages candidates to appeal to people beyond a handful of swing states.\n\nKowal: The NPV would address the pernicious effect of a battleground map in which a few states get all the attention. Under the current system, candidates have no incentive to increase their vote in reliably red or blue states, ignoring large numbers of voters of color in the process. One advantage of the NPV is that it’s a lot easier to persuade a number of states equaling 270 electoral votes to join this compact than it is to get two-thirds of Congress to agree to an amendment in the first place. Once the NPV is established, we believe lawmakers will be more willing to devise a more permanent solution.\n\nWhat role does this movement play in broader democracy and constitutional reform efforts?\n\nCodrington: The Constitution has become more democratic, more inclusive, and more legitimate over time. That’s because the franchise has been expanded and more people have been able to take part in the politics of this country.\n\nFor much of American history, Black people weren’t even conceived of as people, never mind political beings. But the 15th Amendment ultimately changed that. Women were previously not conceived of as independent persons beyond the property of their fathers and husbands. But the 19th Amendment began to change that. Eighteen-year-olds weren’t uniformly able to vote across the country until the 26th Amendment changed that. What we’ve seen is that people have gotten together and changed the Constitution because of movements to broaden democracy, to include more people, to make the country more legitimate.\n\nThese are all examples of the country moving toward the “more perfect union” described in the Constitution’s preamble. Electoral College reform is part of the same movement — achieving a more democratic system where everyone gets to have a voice in selecting the single elected official who’s supposed to represent everyone.\n\nKowal: We have to look at Electoral College reform as part of a larger set of remedies for what ails American democracy. There’s the continued threat of voter suppression, the outsize role of big money in our elections, the continued repercussions of partisan gerrymandering. Reforms that address these issues share the same goal — making our democracy more responsive to the will of the people.\n\n4) Criminal Justice Reform: From Protest to Policy\n\nLast summer, millions of Americans took to the streets in the wake of George Floyd’s killing to protest police brutality and racial injustice. The national reckoning pushed criminal justice reform squarely to the fore of public debate ahead of the election and culminated in significant victories this past November, ranging from relaxed drug laws to greater police accountability across the country. Lauren-Brooke Eisen, director of the Justice Program, outlines the unique opportunities for the Biden administration to seize upon this momentum.\n\nDuring the campaign, Joe Biden conceded that his support for the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act was a “mistake.” What opportunities will he have as president to truly reform our justice system?\n\nLocal jails and state prisons house the majority of our country’s incarcerated population — but the federal government still has a critical role to play in transforming our criminal legal systems. It can spark a paradigm shift in this country. One way the Biden administration can start is to halt federal subsidies for mass incarceration. It can do so by working with Congress to enact the Reverse Mass Incarceration Act (RMIA), a bill that would incentivize states to reduce both crime and incarceration. Under the RMIA, states would be free to choose the best path to achieving these goals, relying both on local expertise and on federal support.\n\nCertainly, both Democrat and Republican leaders would be attracted to a program that improves public safety, reduces our reliance on an expensive and inefficient system, and recognizes the irreparable harms of mass incarceration, particularly on Black and brown people. First proposed by the Brennan Center in 2015, the RMIA was introduced in two previous congressional sessions and was named by Biden as a key priority during his campaign. If the RMIA is enacted, we predict that it could reduce the national prison population by up to 20 percent over the next 10 years, saving state governments as much as $12.1 billion and reducing the population of state prisons by 260,000.\n\nBecause this legislation would provide much-needed dollars for states, it offers the chance for immediate and high-impact action on behalf of criminal and racial justice reform.\n\nThe administration should also support federal drug law reform. It can also play a greater role in reimagining incarceration itself by limiting the use of solitary confinement, improving access to education, and ensuring that incarcerated people are treated with humanity and dignity.\n\nWhat can the federal government do to ensure greater police accountability?\n\nThe Biden administration, through the Justice Department, should mandate use-of-force reporting by all law enforcement agencies and build a comprehensive database. The administration can convey its seriousness by making compliance a condition of federal aid.\n\nAdditionally, the DOJ should resume “pattern or practice” investigations that focus on systemic problematic behavior by a police department and should support legislation that would provide subpoena power for these investigations. This would be a 180-degree turn from the previous administration’s approach to local police departments that violate civil rights, which opened only one of these investigations in four years.\n\nThe events of 2020 highlighted how police departments are often called on to respond to situations and problems better addressed by social workers and mental health professionals. The new administration should work with Congress to provide more funding to help counties and states implement co-responder models where social workers or therapists arrive on the scene together with police, allowing behavioral health specialists to offer assistance in crisis situations.\n\nThis administration should also prohibit the transfer of military-grade weapons to state and local law enforcement agencies. These military-grade weapons and armored vehicles belong in combat zones, not American streets.\n\nIn response to Trump’s controversial pardons, critics have argued that the president’s clemency power needs to be revoked or limited. You take the opposite view. Why should this practice be expanded?\n\nClemency is an important but seldom-used tool for checking the unjust outcomes produced by the criminal legal systems. In fact, as of October 2020, more than 13,000 federal clemency petitions still sat awaiting action.\n\nBut the current process is not transparent. Fact-finding takes place behind closed doors and requires seven layers of review. Reasons for grants or denials are neither explained nor subject to judicial review.\n\nGiven that there are possibly thousands of people who are appropriate clemency candidates sitting in federal prison, the new administration should increase the number of pardons and clemency grants. A new process, independent of the Department of Justice, should be adopted to better routinize its use. Clear standards and written decisions should be made accessible to the public to help demystify how clemency operates and secure public confidence.\n\nWith the pandemic surging among incarcerated populations, what measures can the new administration prioritize to improve conditions in federal prisons?\n\nTo date, there have been outbreaks at more than 850 jails and prisons in the country. At least 372,583 incarcerated people in prison have tested positive for Covid-19, and more than 2,359 have died. And these are just the people we know about.\n\nThe Biden administration should urge all 50 state governors, many of whom possess the power to grant clemency, to cut prison sentences short or pardon offenses outright. The administration should encourage governors and directors of correction to expand their states’ “good time credit” or equivalent programs to reduce overall incarceration. And it should work with state prosecutors to keep people who have been convicted of crimes, but not yet sentenced, out of prison for the duration of this health crisis. Essentially, we’re asking for the broadest relief for the largest group of people possible.\n\nAt the federal level, the administration must direct the federal Bureau of Prisons to proactively identify and release those who are medically vulnerable, or older, or who may be otherwise eligible for early release under the federal compassionate release provision.\n\nFor years the Brennan Center has pushed to reduce the size and scope of our correctional system. We saw some reduction in jail populations and number of arrests at the beginning of the pandemic, but we’ve since seen a huge uptick in jail populations. I hope this public health crisis will spark a true rethinking of who we can keep away from our vast incarceration infrastructure.\n\nWe’ve just witnessed a dramatic uptick in federal executions. What should this administration do to expedite the eradication of the federal death penalty?\n\nThe president should implement a moratorium on federal executions. If the Department of Justice refuses to pursue death penalty sentences, the Supreme Court may be encouraged to strike it down for good; the president’s and Department of Justice’s view that the death penalty is unconstitutional may convince the Court that our “standards of decency” have evolved beyond this cruel and unusual practice.\n\nThe administration should also work with Congress to pass legislation to immediately and permanently abolish the federal death penalty and commute existing federal death sentences to life without parole.\n\nWhat’s the broader/longer-term outlook for the fight to end mass incarceration?\n\nWe have 2.2 million people in our prisons and jails, more than 5 million on probation or parole, and 12 million admissions cycling through county and city jails every year. I hope we can continue to educate policymakers and the public that this level of incarceration has massive societal consequences. It drives and reinforces deep-seated racial inequity and disproportionately punishes both poor and Black Americans. It ruins people’s lives and breaks up families. It’s time for transformative change. We must work locally and nationally to reinvest in communities we’ve historically divested from, reduce unnecessary contact with law enforcement, shorten our overly long and punitive sentences, and ultimately, not mete out more harm through our criminal legal systems."
