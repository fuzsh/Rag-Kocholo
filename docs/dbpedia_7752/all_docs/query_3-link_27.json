He covers topics such as infrastructure, climate laws, energy companies like Entergy, legislative redistricting, home insurance issues and electric grid maintenance.\n\nTo effectively reach out to Sam Karlin with pitches or information, consider providing insights into local political developments in Louisiana or New Orleans. If you have expertise related to infrastructure projects, climate legislation impact on the state or city level, energy policy affecting residents of these areas or legal matters concerning insurance and utilities regulation in this specific region would be relevant for his coverage."
