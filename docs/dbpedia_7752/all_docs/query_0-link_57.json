Formerly, she was a Professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, and a Visiting Assistant Professor at California Western School of Law. She has also taught as a legal writing instructor at the University of San Diego School of Law. Before joining the faculty at Thomas Jefferson, Professor Rierson was a partner at Quinn Emanuel in Los Angeles, California, where her practice focused on civil litigation, primarily government contracts and intellectual property law.\n\nProfessor Rierson’s scholarship falls into two general categories: Trademark Law and Constitutional Law. She has utilized a historical approach to both subjects and explored issues relating to federalism in both contexts. Prof. Rierson’s trademark scholarship highlights the dangers to free speech and anti-competitive effects posed by the modern expansion of trademark law, which reaches far beyond its historical roots in the law of unfair competition. She has explored these issues in the framework of trademark antidilution laws, the genericism doctrine, trademark functionality, and trademark remedies. Her Constitutional scholarship focuses on the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Reconstruction era more broadly, and the intersectional nature of race and gender discrimination during this historical period. She has also explored the parallels between this era and today, particularly in the context of immigration law and citizenship.\n\nProfessor Rierson received the 1L Faculty of the Year Award at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in 2019. She also co-chaired the 2023 Women and the Law Conference at Thomas Jefferson (with Dean Linda Keller), entitled Hate Crimes: Theory, Reality, Impact. Professor Rierson is a member of the State Bar of California, the American Constitution Society, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, and the American Society for Legal History.\n\nYou can view Professor Rierson’s complete research on her SSRN Author page: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=337819\n\nFrom Dred Scott to Anchor Babies: White Supremacy and the Contemporary Assault on Birthright Citizenship, 38 Geo.
