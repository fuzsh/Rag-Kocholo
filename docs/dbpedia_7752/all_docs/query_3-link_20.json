The subcommittee met, pursuant to recess, at 2:10 p.m., in room 2300, New Senate Office Building, Senator Strom Thurmond presid- inAlso present: J. G. Sourwine, chief counsel, and David Martin. Senator THURMOND. The hearing will be in order. The witness is still under oath. Proceed. Mr. SOURWINE. Mr. Karlin, toward the end of our last session, you were given a number of photographs and asked to study them and be ready to discuss them when you came back. Do you have these photographs with you? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. Do you want to take them up one by one and tell us if there are any you recognize and what you notice about the person or the photograph? Mr. KARLIN. All right. Generally, I wanted to find some pictures which possibly were published in the Soviet press to get the participants of some of the KGB operations which we discussed. Mr. SOURWINE. You mean people who, like you, were co-opted by the KGB? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, sir; that is first. Secondly, well, there is one foreigner here who was a \"victim.\" Mr. SOURWINE. Take the pictures one by one and tell what the picture is. Mr. KARLIN. The first picture is the President of Indonesia in the past, Sukarno, which was published in the newspaper Pravda when he arrived firstly in Moscow. That was 1956. Mr. SOURWINE. Off the record. (Discussion off the record.) Mr. SOURWINE. On the record. Mr. KARLIN. This picture was published when he arrived to Mos- cow and we discussed his operation with the girl, Reschetnyk, who was from KGB. The KGB \"supplied\" her as an interpreter to President Sukarno. But in a week or maybe 10 days later, on the same newspaper Pravda, on the first page, there was published another picture where (167) Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 i ,IA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 there was Sukarno on the right and to the left was this girl, this KGB girl, Reschetnyk blonde one. Mr. SouRwINE. I think you have told us that this girl became Sukarno's traveling secretary. Mr. KARLIN. Yes, sir, and at the same time, mistress. That is the same thing you mean, yes? Mr. SOURWINE. Not necessarily. It is well to make it clear. Mr. KARLIN. All right. Mr. SOURwINE. May this photo be designated as No. 1? Mr. KARLIN. And now probably No. 2. Mr. SOURWINE. And No. 2 and go in the record at this point. Senator THURMOND. It is so ordered. (The photograph follows:) Mr. KARLIN. Now, the picture, the second, that is Sergei Bondar- chuk. That is the famous director and actor who, by the way, produced the War and Peace movie. He was invited as the man who would be in our special party when \"we\" invited the French Ambassador, his wife and some of his employees to the Soviet Committee of Movies, to start the operation with him. It was particularly the beginning of the operation and Bondarchuk was included in our group. But it does not mean that he was used later in that operation. I don't know later what happened, but he was included in this circle, probably as a \"garnish.\" Mr. SOURWINE. Go ahead, finish what you were saying. Mr. KARLIN. I would like to underline that the KGB sometimes use people in such a way, as I mentioned as the garnish on the dish, only for representation and make the meeting or party or something like that more natural and solid. Well, look, when you are among these men, no one in the world would suspect that there is someone from KGB here. It is a matter of the atmosphere. The KGB produces the atmosphere of the \"natural\" life. They use some people for this. Of course, still, they must talk to them and to tell them that there will be something special. It means that still they are co-opted, or sometimes they are used without any knowledge of it. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 169 It has to be known, there could be different sorts of people in the operation with the KGB-the participant, active one, and some of them who must only produce, let me say, nice chorus music. Mr. SouRwINE. When you spoke of Bondarchuk being used in connection with the initiation of the operation against the Ambassador, you meant Ambassador Dejean? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. That is No. 2. Mr. SouRwINE. No, this would be No. 3. May it be received at this time? Senator THURMOND. Yes. (The photograph follows:) Mr. KARLIN. No. 4. It's Georgian artist Gudiaschvily. It is par- ticularly the artist whose exhibition we visited with the French Ambassador Dejean, with his Cultural Attache, Girard, and with the KGB lady, Khovanskiy. It was particularly a moment when she, after the exhibition, asked the Ambassador whether he would be able to pick her up and would take her to her flat and they went there. So the love relation with this lady was started. Mr. SouRwINE. Off the record. Senator Thurmond. Off the record. (Discussion off the record.) Senator Thurmond. Back on the record. Mr. SouRwlNE. This would be No. 4. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 170 (The photograph follows:) Mr. KARLIN. Now, this is Mr. Mikhalkov. He is really now one of the most important and very orthodox writers in the U.S.S.R. He is, by the way, the author of the Soviet hymn. Mr. SOURwINE. You are talking now about Mikhalkov? Mr. KARLIN. Yes; he is now, I read in yesterday's newspaper, he is now the First Secretary of the Moscow organization of the Union of Soviet Writers. It is the top position among the Moscow writers. This Mikhalkov and his wife Konchalovskiy-they both were in the center of the operation against the French Ambassador, Maurice Dejean. Well, particularly they invited firstly to their flat, the Ambassador with his wife and then in this party, they introduced the French Ambassador and his wife to General Gorbunov and his KGB wife, Major Andreev. Mr. SOURwINE. They introduced him as Mr. KARLIN. As Gorbunov, as the VIP government officer. And later on, Mikhalkov participated in many top level parties organized by the KGB with girls. He presented on that party which I mentioned with the girl Zoia. Many times, he was in those parties, but unfor- tunately I cannot tell you exactly whether he knew the whole plot of the operation. Maybe he \"worked\" like Bondarchuk, but still he was very close to General Gribanov. I know that exactly because I had a conversation with General Gribanov about Mikhalkov from which I realized they were in a very close relation. Mr. SOURWINE. This will be No. 5. May it go in the record at this point? Senator THURMOND. It is so ordered. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/111//1 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 (The photograph follows:) Mr. KARLIN. There is Surkov. His first name is Alexei. He was the general secretary of the Union of Soviet Writers. After the Pasternak \"case\", he was replaced by Fedin. But still until now, until today, I guess last week, he was 70 and he was very greatly publicized, he is until now a top level orthodox writer, one of the most orthodox you see. And he is a KGB man. I will tell you how I knew it. When 1 went to Germany, in 1947, 1 remember the KGB's Lieu- tenant Colonel Povlovskiy told me that among the top level KGB co-opted people there is Surkov, whom I knew, of course, at that time. He was at that time the editor of the magazine Ogonek. It is similar to your Life, for example. Povlovskiy said that he telephoned him, he named me in a friendly way, and that he said that I can come to his office and he would give me the letter, with recommendations to go to Germany. Well, why I needed this letter? An idea was in that time to find the place where to stay, where to meet foreigners, where to be sold. Later the KGB decided to put me under the roof of the Bureau of Information. But at the beginning, they wanted me to go to Germany with numerous possibilities. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIDP73B00296R000500140002-0 One of these possibilities was the letter of this Surkov. I saw him and he gave me such letter. It was an evidence of his collaboration with KGB. Mr. SOURWINE. That would be No. 6. May it be received? Senator THURMOND. So ordered. (The photograph follows:) Mr. KARLIN. Now, a man, whose name is Mdivani. He was a par- ticipant in the operation against the French Ambassador, Maurice Dejean. He was co-opted by KGB, particularly during this operation, because I remember he was co-opted by my own recommendation. Kunavin asked me to give him some famous Soviet people whom the KGB would be able to use to create a little bit bigger, not only two or three men, but five, six, seven persons company. Well, I gave him Mdivani's name and later Kunavin told me that he telephoned him and then he invited him to come to the Hotel Moscow and he talked to. him. He said everything is all right, Mdivani is co-opted and will help me in every possible way. He said he didn't open to him everything, of course. But still, Mdivani was a clever man. He realized what is going on. Mr. SOURWINE. Well, it is your recommendation if I understand you correctly, Mdivani was co-opted to serve as a sort of assistant to you? Mr. KARLIN. It is correct, but without such a deed Mr. SOURWINE. To do as you wanted without asking questions? Mr. KARLIN. Right. Mr. SOURWINE. This would be No. 7; may it go in at this point? Senator' THURMOND.YeS. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/1.1,91 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 (The photograph follows:) Mr. KARLIN. It is Skobtsev. The wife of the movie director Bon- darchuk whom I mentioned first. She is a movie star, famous, too. She played the part of Juliette in the movie \"Romeo and Juliette.\" She was invited to General Gri- banov's or Gorbunov's, as you wish, parties when Zoia was presented there. Zoia told me that among those females, there was Skobtsev. That is what I cannot tell you exactly, whether she was one of the swallows of the KGB or she was like her husband the \"garnish\" the famous girl who created the natural atmosphere. But I know a little bit about this lady because she was the fiancee of the Khrushchev son-in-law, Adjubei. Mr. SOIJRWINE. That was before she married? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, that was before she married. Then she became the wife of the movie cameraman, Kun, who was involved in the KGB operation against the French Ambassador and his wife, with the idea to seduce her. It was the third attempt, you see. And Skobtsev was his wife, before. It was, of course, coincidence. Kun told me about her many things, which could give me a guess that probably she was more than only the lady to create a natural atmosphere. Mr. SOTRWINE. In any event, you knew her as a resource of the KGB? Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 174 Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouxwINE. That would be No. 8; if I may, I offer it at this time. Senator THURMOND. Proceed. It will go in. (The photograph follows:) Mr. KARLIN. It is the last picture. It's Alexander Chakovskiy. Now he is the chief editor of the \"Literaturnaya Gazeta\". I must say that I only can-I know only as a rumor, but it was very, very per- sistent rumor about his work for the KGB. He is top man. He visits foreign countries each year five, 10 times. He was here in, the States three or four times, he met some of your Congressmen here, he told me personally, how he talked to them. He is a clever man, very crafty, but as a writer he is typical medi- ocre. I was told this story: Well-known Russian writer, Poustovskiy, a great writer I would say, second, probably, after Pasternak . . . when he went firstly to Italy, the Soviet Government sent him with this Chakovskiy and he followed him everywhere and Poustovskiy-that is what I heard-Poustovskiy called him in a jokable way, the colonel. Poustovskiy was a very movable man, he wanted to see this, that, and go this place, another place, all day long he spent in walking. Chakovskiy was tired. He said the second day; \"Listen, you know what is possible for you and what is impossible, do yourself.

I must repeat I, myself, never had any job with Chakovskiy and I never heard from the official KGB men that he is a co-opted agent. Well, that is, I would say, all with these pictures. Mr. SOTRWINE. This would be No. 9. It is offered for the record. Senator THURMOND. It is so ordered. (The photograph follows:) Mr. SoURwINE. Now, you mentioned several writers. I think at one time earlier, you were asked if you knew Alexander Solzhenitsyn. You said you knew who he was. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. The newspapers today are carrying stories about the expulsion of Solzhenitsyn from the Writers Union. This is ap- parently a process that is to begin at a low or local level and then be ratified at a high or higher level. Are you familiar with this process of ousting a man? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. You held a position for a number of years in the Writer's Union, did you not? Mr. KARLTN. I would say that what really happened, of course, was not the local process which was approved then at a higher level. It is opposite, because such an action was done, and could be done only by the order and decision on the top level in the Central Com- mittee. I would say that the decision about Solzhenitsyn, whether to Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 176 expel him from the Union of Soviet Writers or to wait, was done, even, I guess, at the meeting of the Politburo. Because it is big, and crucial point. In the situation which exists now in the Soviet Union, the literary area, is the most dangerous place where something could happen, if something could happen. It is known in the Central Com- mittee. Therefore, first of all, of course, the decision was done in the Central Committee, in the Politburo. Mr. SouRwINE. According to the newspapers and to the announce- ments made from the U.S.S.R. by the foreign press to the foreign newspaper men, this action was first taken one day by a local branch of the Union with 10 members and then the matter went before a higher branch and was ratified. Mr. KARLIN. Yes; it is correct. Mr. SOURWINE. Are you telling us that was all window dressing? Mr. KARLIN. Right. Mr. SOURWINE. Actually, it was decided at the top level, the Politburo? Mr. KARLIN. Sure. Mr. SoURWINE. And then the wheels were set in motion. Mr. KARLIN. That is only a formality, you know. When they gave Solzhenitsyn possibility to talk, he talked. That's all. Who knows what he said? Where it was published? It was a show where someone wrote the protocol, you know, the report, and in the Soviet news- paper there were probably two, three lines printed. It was sort of dem- ocratic show. First, the Ryazan district committee where Solz- henitsyn, was a member of the organization, expelled him, then the Union of Writers of the Russian Federation would confirm it. Still now, the last step must be approval by the Union of Writers of the U.S.S.R. But the Soviet newspaper now mentioned only the Union of Writers of the Ryazan district. Mr. SOURWINE. You are saying there are three levels of the Union involved-the local level? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWTNE. The Russian Writers Union? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SovRWINE. And the U.S.S.R. Writers Union? Mr. KARLIN. That is correct in particularly Solzhenitsyn \"case.\" Mr. SOURWINE. That the local level went through the motions first? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRWINE. Then the U.S.S.R. Mr. KARLIN. Then the Russian Federation. Mr. SOURWINE. Which ratified it yesterday, according to the news stories? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. You say there still remains action by the U.S.S.R. Writers? Mr. KARLIN. It is correct. Mr. SOURWINE. And that will be coming up the next day or so. Mr. KARLIN. The decisive is the second one, the Union of Russian Federation. Mr. SOURWINE. The second is decisive? Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 177 Mr. KARLIN. After that, you are out. But after that, it has to be confirmation by the Union of Writers of the U.S.S.R. It is the same as you are expelled from the Party. Firstly, it is the cell, the party cell, and they expel you, but still you have your card. After that, there is the whole meeting of the Party organization and they will say, we ratify it, and from this moment, you are out of the Party. But the card is still in your pocket. But you are out by the code. And the regional committee, that is a confirmation, you see. It is a very complicated procedure. Still one can apply to the center, to Moscow, to the Central Committee, as well as to the Union of Writers of the U.S.S.R., if it concerns a writer. Mr. SoURw1NE. Well, as a practical matter-off the record. Senator THURMOND. Off the record. (Discussion off the record.) Senator THURMOND. On the record. Mr. KARLIN. I repeat from my point of view, it is a pretty crucial moment, now. Because still, as it is known in the world now, the Soviets again started to control the intellectual life and the situation is absolutely unfavorable for any liberal movement in the Soviet Union. Solzhenitsyn is in my opinion as great as Pasternak was. I think they have done now particularly what they have done with Pasternak. It is an important parallel, because in that time, there was also a crucial moment. The next step from my point of view would be automatically in 3, 4, 5 months time, displacement of Alexandre Tvardovski. He is the man who published Solzhenitsyn-the editor of the best, if it is possible to say, Soviet literary magazine, \"Noviy Mir.\" This man is a very interesting person, because he is a very talented poet and he is an absolutely devoted Communist. But his idea is this: \"There is something wrong with our Soviet system. We must try to change it and to make it better. We must criticize it.\" And he pub- lished first-well, of course, it was permitted by Khrushchev at that time, but he published Solzhenitsyn and he was and is one of the strongest supporters of Solzhenitsyn. I would not say he was a close friend of Solzhenitsyn. They are dif- ferent. But from the point of view how literature has to serve people, they were together. I personally thought that the Central Committee would dismiss first Tvardovskiy and I thought Solzhenitsyn would be the second \"victim.\" I think they decided to go the opposite way simply because they did not want to go in my way. Mr. SOURWINE. You are predicting that Tvardovski will be the next to be ousted or will be ousted within the next reasonable period, 4 or 5 months? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. I think it is inevitable. * Maybe they can prolong it only because * * * you know, when you put two shots all together, it is too noisy. They are thinking now only about tactics, when to do it, and how to do it. I think it is absolutely clear they will do it. Put it all together with the recently published novel of the leader of the Soviet Orthodox writers, Kochetov. In his novel, titled \"What Do You *Editors note : Tvardovskiy was dismissed from his post as editor of Noviy Mir in late March or early April 1970. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 178 Want?\" he proclaimed uncompromised ideological war. He showed how the American lady who graduated Slavonic faculty in some U.S.A. university became the agent of the CIAand then went to Italy to find a Russian emigrant together with her to go to Russia. He put it like a fiction, but he mentioned many real names, he mentioned Radio Liberty, BBC, Voice of America, and then the \"Novoye Russkoye Slovo,\" the newspaper, he mentioned real names of the Russian emigrants. It means he got an admission to the special collec- tion where are all these newspapers, magazines, you see, and then I guess he had had a consulter from the KGB, because the intelligence network is involved in his story. It is strong evidence that the orthodox are going to eliminate those little things which were approached during so-called \"thaw.\" It cannot be only Kochetov private initiative to write this novel. I think it is his own initiative plus something which came from the hill. I think they are in a position to make a very rough action again to frighten people. It's what they really need-to frighten Soviet people. Mr. SOURWINE. Right at this point, would you tell us over the years what positions did you hold in these unions? Mr. KARLIN. I? Mr. SOURWINE. YOU. Mr. KARLIN. It starts from my institute. I graduated particularly this institute Mr. SOURwINE. Off the record. Senator THURMOND. Off the record. (Discussion off the record.) Senator THURMOND. On the record. Mr. KARLIN. I graduated the same institute which later graduated Kuznetsov and Belinkov. It is the literary institute under the Union of Soviet Writers, which was the special one. There are some \"gifted\" young writers, dramatists, poets, \"study\" how to become good writers. Being in this institute, I made money because simultaneously I was a Chief of the Literary Department in one of Moscow's theaters. I was responsible for repertoire. I had relations with writers to offering them to write plays for my theater or to put their novels into plays. Mr. SouRWINE. What one must consider, is it not true, is that in this position, you were in a sense a Government employee? You were not employed by the theater? Mr. KARLIN. I was employed by the theater, and it was a Govern- ment theater. Mr. SOURWINE. That is a Government function? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, because all theaters in the U.S.S.R. are Govern- ment theaters. There are no private ones. Mr. SOURWINE. It was not a free enterprise deal? Mr. KARLIN. Oh, no. Mr. SOURwINE. Go ahead. Mr. KARLIN. In that period, because ofmy father's friendship with Pasternak, I entered his home, actually he recommended me to this institute and that is the beginning of my long relation with the Pasternaks, practically until a day when I left Russia. A month before I left Russia, I spent 3 weeks in the dacha of his wife and sons, in Peredelnino. I told you that, when I came back to Moscow in 1943 I became TASS correspondent and editor.

When I came from Germany, first time, before KGB recruited me, it was 1945. I was free lance correspondent. Mr. SouRWINE. Now, between 1938 or 1939 and 1945, did you hold any office or position in any writers unions? Mr. KARLIN. No I worked in TASS as a newspaper man. At that time, I was simply the columnist. Mr. SoIRwINE. When did you first become connected with the writers union? Mr. KARLIN. That was when I reproduced my play about Paul Robeson, titled, \"John, Soldier of Peace.\" From that time, I had a close relation with the Union of Soviet Writers and little bit later I became a member of the Moscow Committee of Dramatists. Mr. SouRwINE. Would that have been the committee that would have expelled Solzhenitsyn if he had been a playwright instead of an author? Mr. KARLIN. As the first cell, if he had been in Moscow. Mr. SotRwINE. So that was the Moscow equivalent for drama- tists Mr. KARLIN. Almost. Mr. SouRwINE (continuing). Of the cell which did in fact first expel Solzhenitsyn? Mr. KARLIN. In the Union of Soviet Writers in Moscow, for example, or in Leningrad or in the Ukraine-there must be numeral sections. One is writing only novels. Another section is poetry, another section is drama. Another is fantasy, and so on. Mr. SOURWINE. And you were secretary of the dramatists Mr. KARLIN. No; I wasn't the secretary. In Ryazan, where Solzhenitsyn was expelled, there was only five members altogether. He was the sixth. There was a small cell. Therefore, there was not different sections. Mr. SouRwINE. I understand. The machinery would have been the same, though, would it not? Mr. KARLIN. Oh, yes; the syetem is the same. Mr. SouRwINE. That is what I meant. Now, from what you know of that system, having been a part of that system, having been a part of it, as a practical matter, how would it have worked, this decision to expel Solzhenitsyn? Who would have told whom? Who would have scheduled action? Mr. KARLIN. Oh, it is simple Mr. SOURWINE. Well, it is simple to you, but make it simple on this record. Mr. KARLIN. That is a very simple and I would say very reliable way to do that. The decision was done, as I say, in the Politburo. They talked between themselves, probably three or four of them. That is actually Suslov job, of course. Mr. SomRWINE. Could he have made the decision alone, by himself? Mr. KARLIN. No, it is impossible for him to make a decision alone. When I came here and was interviewed I told that I think that Suslov is No. 1 man in the hill, practically, who doesn't want to be No. 1 man for some reason. You know, among all this company of Soviet bosses, he is the one who has been in the Central Committee longer than anyone else. 45-158 0-70-pt. 3--2 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 180 He even, I guess, knows where is the lamp which is broken in the men room in the Central Committee's huge building, he is one man who knows everything in this enormously big machine. And being such a man and of course, with some other necessary qualities, he practically became the master who put all in the right way, with knowing what would be the result, you know, because Brezhnev was not so long the Secretary of the Central Committee, and then became the President. Suslov was there from the Stalin time. I guess even his chair is rather deteriorated, but it helps him. So Suslov and his adherents and assistants decided to raise the question in the Politburo. And decision was done in the Politburo, probably Suslov, himself or Demichev gave practical order down- to \"screws.\" By the way when Pasternak died, Poustovskiy, whom I just mentioned, came to Pasternak's place, spent there some hours, then went to Moscow and asked Surkov, whom I also mentioned, because he at that time was the Chief Secretary, to have a meeting and to see established, Pasternak as a member of the Union of Soviet Writers, to organize normal funeral procedure. It's known that Surkov went to see Suslov and they discussed the situation, Suslov said no, and ordered to put Pasternak into coffin as the member of the Litfund. That is a literary fund which is the organ- ization which helps writers financially. Mr. SOURWINE. Like a pension plan? Mr. KARLIN. That is practically how it works. But in the Solzhenitsyn case they were not in it hurry, because he (lid not die. The decision was done in the Politburo,' then Suslov, or could be Demichev-he is the Central Committee Secretary who is responsible for cultural questions-he is a gentleman whom General Gribanov called when he wanted to \"educate\" poet Yevtuschenko, because in that time, he was the Secretary of the Moscow Party Committee. So this Demichev would invite to the Central Committee Fedin-he is the Chief Secretary of the Union of Soviet Writers now. But he is an old man, with his own tragedy, because he was a friend of Pasternak in past and they later quarreled, you see. He felt himself guilty of many, many things, I guess. But during the last 3 or 4 years, he was against Solzhenitsyn because he knew the situation. He would come to this Demichev, not alone, he would come with the Secretary of the Union of Soviet Writers Voronkov. Voronkov is Central Committee man, he has pretty important position, he is responsible for all political and ideological movement in the Union of Soviet Writers, simply he is a watchdog. Let's say Demichev talked with Voronkov and Fedin. He would say officially: \"I must inform you that Solzhenitsyn was discussed in the Politburo, we want to advise you to expel him from your Union. We cannot leave this man unpunished after his anti-Soviet novels were published in the West.\" Practically then, Voronkov, probably he would go or he would invite the boss of Union of Writers of the Russian Federation. It is a rather bureaucratic way, too. They needed to do that. But this Sobolev, now he is a hero of the Socialist labor. He is the boss of the Union of Soviet Writers of Russian Federation. Mr. SOURwINE. He would be told to do that? Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 ijA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Mr. KARLIN. Yes. It could be that they would come to see Demichev together. I can- not tell you exactly how many came to the Central Committee. They could come 2 or 3 of them to do it at once. But still, they were informed and after that, it is absolutely easy, because in that case, they will call to the Ryazan District Party Committee, to the First Secretary or to the Second Secretary. Mr. SOURWINE. The Secretary of the Party Committee then would call the five writers in and tell them what to do? Mr. KARLIN. Not necessarily five; maybe one or two, it would be enough. Mr. SouRwINE. May I interrupt you? I want to ask what may seem to you to be a very silly question. Do you know anything about hooking up sled dogs in the Arctic? Mr. KARLIN. No. Mr. SOURWINE. Well, I have been told that when you hook up sled dogs, the strongest dog goes in front, because if you put the strongest dog behind a weaker dog, he bites him in the flank. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwINE. Now, when a dog behind the strongest dog tries to veer right or left, the strongest dog turns around and bites him on the shoulder. Mr. KARLIN. On the shoulder, yes. Mr. SouRwINE. When the strongest dog moves forward, the dog behind him has an option. He can follow him or he can turn right or left. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwINE. But he does not want to get bit, so he follows him. So you have wonderful cooperation if you get the dogs in the right order. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. It reminds me of what you are telling me about the way the writers union is organized in Russia. Mr. KARLIN. Yes, but I can add to this dog's story-That my people are moving in this way 50 years. It was 2 or 3 years thaw when there was some hope, very little but hope, but now everything again is absolutely hopeless. Mr. SouRwINE. Are you saying that for 40 years, there has been no freedom of expression, no freedom to write, no freedom to publish in the Soviet Union? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. I totally agree with what was said by Kuznetsov who came to the West 6 years later than I. Mr. SOURWINE. You are talking about Anatoly Kuznetsov? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. Who is in Great Britain now? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. Recently defected? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. He is also a writer? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, a known writer. Mr. SOURwINE. Did he ever hold a position with the Writers Union like you did? Mr. KARLIN. What do you mean by the Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 182 Mr. SOURWINE. You were secretary. Mr. KARLIN. He was secretary. Mr. SOURWINE. I understood you to say that you were secretary of the Dramatists Committee? Mr. KARLIN. No, I was not secretary, I was a member of the committee. Mr. SOURWINE. You were a member of the Dramatists Committee? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwINE. Was he similarly a member of the committee? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, but he was not a dramatist, he is a novelist. Mr. SOURWINE. He writes prose, not poetry? Mr. KARLIN. It is correct. He is from Tula. Solzhenitsyn is from Ryazan. Kuznetsov was from Tula. They are very similar cities. I remembered in the Literary Gazette it was mentioned that there were five or six signatures in the letter against Kuznetsov. The whole organization in Tula con- sisted of six or no more than 10 writers. Mr. SOURWINE. I think there were nine in the case of Solzhenitsyn. Mr. KARLIN. It is a very similar scale of those two organizations. Mr. SouRwINE. Now, so far as you have read what Kuznetsov has written, you would agree with him? Mr. KARLIN. Absolutely, totally. Mr. SOURWINE. He also had been co-opted by the KGB, had he not? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. Did you know him in Moscow? Mr. KARLIN. No. Mr. SouRwINE. His position with the KGB was not the same as yours was, was it? Mr. KARLIN. No, I think it was different. But in some way, it was the same. I would like to tell you now this: He was co-opted first of all with the idea to give, get domestic information. What I mean by domes- tic? Information about his colleagues, writers, what they are thinking about, what they want to do, you know, and so on. I was doing the same thing being among foreigners, particularly Moscow diplomats. Well, of course, there is difference, but at the same way, it is pretty similar thing, Mr. SOURWINE. He was a sounding board for Soviet intellectuals, writers? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. And you were a sounding board for foreign diplo- mats and dignitaries? Mr. KARLIN. That is true. But I wouldlike now to underline that it is possible that being co-opted firstly for let me say again, domestic job, later, under some special circumstances the KGB could shift one to \"serve\" the diplomats, for example. For example, once I had a rather important job which was ab- solutely domestic, being working among the foreigners generally. It happened immediately after Stalin's death, when Malenkov became the Prime Minister, and he was at that time the First Secretary of the Central Committee, and Beria became the Minister of MVD. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 183 They put all together KGB, and MVD, to make a big office. I know privately, from the wife of Dekanozov, who was assistant minister of the foreign staff, and the Soviet Ambassador in Germany before the war there was a grave quarrel, a fight for death or life between Malen- kov and Beria. That fight was underground before Stalin died. When Stalin died Beria and Malenkov showed that they are well together. But there was still fighting between them. Why I am telling you all this? I remember Kunavin called me to the Hotel Moscow and told me: \"Listen, we have a very important job for you and you must help us.\" He told me it is the order, per- sonally Beria's order, to select three or five men like me, with such a background-what I mean by background, it is not the KGB back- ground, but, well, I was born in Georgia, my father and mother were intellectual people, you see, and for me it was so easy to relate to these people, I was known in Georgia. Beria was ordered to select such a man and to send them to 5 or 6 different national republics for 2 or 3 weeks to be among writers, artists, musicians, to know what they feel, what is their idea of Beria and Malenkov, whom they support and whom they did not, you know; whom they prefer. I could not say \"no\" in that time. They gave me the ticket and the number of the telephone of the KGB people in Tbilisi. When I came I telephoned them and we met in a hotel. Then I spent 2 weeks in Tbilisi with the absolutely crucial and totally tragical mission, you see. It was necessary for me to meet people whom I knew all my youth time, school time, some of them were very famous writers, movie producers, and to talk to them and then to make a report what they thought. I realized, of course, that my report would be first of all in Beria's hands, not in Malenkov's hands. I remember that when I came to Moscow, I spent 2 or 3 days to compose that report with the idea not to harm people and in the same time, not to put myself in trouble, because if I would compose some- thing absolutely wrong, it would be suspicious, too. It was a very difficult work which I have done, I think in a good way, because still I realized that it would be better for me to say some- thing a little bit worse about Malenkov and a little bit good about Beria, because the master of MVD was Beria. I tell you this to show that in particular situation, they can forget all about those foreigners and put one to be an informer among Soviet people. Well, it is an awful game in which they can create for you, pretty dangerous situation. Why I am telling you this? I am writing now for the emigrant newspaper here in New York. There were many awful publications about Kuznetsov, disgraceful publications. The old Russian emigrants say, oh, he was an informer, he is a \"black\" man and so forth. They do not know how difficult to be a writer in the U.S.S.R. They do not understand that there is a strong practical relation- ship between the KGB and the Union of Soviet Writers. There is a strong contatt between those two organizations. It is now a historical fact. Mr. SouRwINE. Now, what does it mean to a man to be expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers? Mr. KARLIN. It depends on a caliber of man. Mr. SOURWINE. Take a man like Solzhenitsyn. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21: CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Mr. KARLIN. That is a crucial matter for him, but actually, nothing will be changed. He was before expulsion out of any social faction, you see. He was totally isolated from the Soviet life. And it was done a long time ago. In the western newspapers, you can read something about him. But nothing was published about Solzhenitsyn in Russia for the last 5 or 6 years. No one knew anything about him, you know. Here you have some information and someone can think, well, what happened to him? But there no one knows about it. Mr. SOURWINE. After the publication in Russia of \"A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\" Mr. KARLIN. After that there was nothing, because there was a short time, about a year's time, when there was an unstable situation. Still you could get his novel in the library. Then Tvardovski, pub- lished another of Solzhenitsyn's short stories. Five of them it seems to me were published. Still people were more brave. They sent him letters. Some of them were printed here in New York. In the first couple of years, there was a hope, you see, for him. Let me tell you now what happened later-well, I think, there was a big quarrel in the second meeting between the Soviet intelligentsia and Khrushchev, when Sholohov mentioned that Solzhenitsyn is Jewish, a Jew, because you know, Solzhenitsyn, Alexander-that is the first name, the middle is Isaevich. It is a rather Jewish name. When Sholohov met Tvardovski, he said, \"Hey, what about Isaevich? He's a Jew.\" He said, no, he is not Jewish, Sholohov is the anti-Semitic leader in the U.S.S.R. He is abnormal in his anti-Semitic feeling. He is even physically anti-Semitic. Mr. SOURWINE. Are you saying Solzhenitsyn is being acted against partly because he is Jewish-- Mr, KARLIN. He is not Jewish, Mr. SOURWINE (continuing). Or are you saying people are claiming that against him in order to use Soviet anti-Semitism to bring him down? Mr. KARLIN. Particularly this Sholohov, the Nobel prize man. I would say until 1963 Solzhenitsyn was in the position to be a great writer in the U.S.S.R. It is known. Even Simonov in New York a week ago, answering question: \"What do you think about So]z- henitsyn?\" Said: \"He is a big writer, but I read only his first novel.\" He said he did not read his second and third ones. Simonov is a talented man, but the orthodox party writer. Mr. SOURWINE. If he had admitted having read the other two, he would have been confessing that he read an illegal, bootlegged, carbon copy version circulated unlawfully? Mr. KARLIN. It is firstly, secondly, of course, Solzhenitsyn's last two books-well, let me say for the clever man, and that is absolutely correct, they are a strong accusation of the Soviet system. That is a direct accusation, not only in the direction toward Stalin; it is deeper, you see. It is a really great novel, I would say the greatest novel of our time. But the first novel was rather local. It is possible to interpret it as a local one. It is about Stalin's concentration camp and the hero was-well, the man who could, even in the awful situation still produce something to survive.

Have you read all of Solzhenitsyn's three major novels? Mr. KARLIN. Sure. I have read them. Even I paid 40 marks to Harper & Rowe, publisher-it means $10 for one novel. It was big money for me to spend when I was in Spain. But I sent a letter and someone sent me a book. Mr. SOURwINE. Cheer up. It costs that much here. Mr. KARLIN. It is too expensive; particularly for the poor Russian emigrant. Mr. SOURWINE. There is something I want to ask you about. You said you agreed with Kuznetsov. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. Off the record. Senator THURMOND. Off the record. (Discussion off the record.) Senator THIURMOND. We will go back on the record now. Mr. SOURWINE. Kuznetsov made reference to the infiltration of KGB agents into foreign governments, including the Government of the United States. Mr. KARLIN. Made he? Mr. SOURWINE. He did not purport to know the names or where- abouts of any particular agents in Government departments in this country. Mr. KARLIN. I guess SO. Mr. SOURwINE. Do you think, from what you know of his position, he would have been in a position to know this? Were you in a position to know about this? Mr. KARLIN. Well, I cannot guarantee it. Maybe one day he would publish another article and maybe he would open some other part of his life, you see. But I personally think that he had some relation with foreigners, too. He went to Paris. Even twice, I guess, he was there. And I think he mentioned something about this. First of all, he said you must know that each Soviet man who is going abroad has to be not only checked, but is under the KGB control being outside. Mr. SouRwINE. Well, you made this same point in your book, \"The Angry Exile?\" Mr. KARLIN. It is correct. Mr. SouRwINE. Before Kuznetsov ever defected. Mr. KARLIN. I have been firstly in Japan. Before I went to Japan, Major Andreev telephoned me and said: \"Please come to our usual place.\" When I came, she introduced me to the KGB Sub- Colonel Kozlov-I do not remember his first name. And she told me, well, he will be in your group as the watchman from KGB. She asked me to help him as much as I can but keep it secret, of course. When i went to England it was absolutely same thing. Andreev telephoned me and introduced me to the KGB Major Stepanov. They have a very funny system. Firstly they watch people, from the KGB who were sent abroad being as to say rewarded for something. They were paid their salary, then they were paid currency-little currency, but still currency- and the cost of the trip, all that. So for the KGB officers to go to France for 2 weeks or to go to Italy for 2 weeks, was something pleasant, very pleasant. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 186 Therefore, in the first period of the Soviet tourism, it was a pleasant reward, for the KGB officers to go abroad under the cover name and profession. They liked to do it. But after some defections, after more often and often, people defected, situation for them changed because if someone defected, the KGB officer would be punished. There could be different punishments depending on the case, who defected, what situation was, what defector did and so on. But still this sort of journey became for them dangerous. And I repeat the situation now changed. Now they do not want to go, you see, abroad, even being paid and with the currency because it is a pretty risky game. They will go for 2 weeks and then Krotkov would defect and the KGB watchdog would be without his shoulder straps. Mr. SOURWINE. He would lose his epaalets. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. And he has a family, children. Now the KGB press them. Now they are going abroad under an order. Mr. SOURWINE. It is not a reward anymore, going abroad. Mr. KARLIN. Why I am telling you this? When Kuznetsov went to France firstly-he visited France twice, he had a relation with watch- dogs. Well, I do not think he mentioned everything. Well, his position was rather difficult, you know. It is enough he said he was co-opted, and particularly was domestic informer. If he would say something more and more, he would become an absolutely \"black man\"; for you Westerners and particularly for Russian emigrants. I notice they hate him. Mr. SouRwINE. If he were only a helper to the watchdog, he would have been in a position to know anything about KGB infiltration in the West? Mr. KARLIN. I doubt it. Well, maybe some little cases, very little details. Mr. SOURWINE. Did you hear anything about this? You were 17 years with the KGB? Mr. KARLIN. About him? Mr. SOURWINE. No, did you hear anything about infiltration of KGB agents in the United States? Mr. KARLIN. I heard something. Mr. SOURWINE. Well, maybe you heard it was an objective of the KGB to do this if they could. Mr. KARLIN. Maybe. Mr. SouRwINE. But did you ever hear of any cases where they did it or anything about having people? Mr. KARLIN. No-well, the point is, still, they know their job and they are trying to save all that. It is a top secret area. Something which I knew besides my own KGB job, I knew partic- ularly from Kunavin in private way. Mr. SOURWINE. Many things you know Colonel Kunavin told you? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, sir. When he was dismissed. Mr. SOURWINE. But Colonel Kunavin was not dealing with the people in the United States? Mr. KARLIN. No. Mr. SOURWINE. You had no need to notice anything. Mr. KARLIN. Once I remember-what was his name-Kapichkus- it is so long ago. I came from Germany and 1 day I have been in Mr. Bespalov's private room and we discussed something. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21: CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 187 He told me, I do not know why, but he told me he knew there was one KGB man in America a long time ago. He was a Latvian and he had a relation with the Soviet Embassy. What I had heard from Bespalov was very approximately, not clear, therefore I don't want you to think about it seriously. Mr. SOURWINE. Do you feel you have a basis for believing that operations are continuing and have been continuing? Mr. KARLIN. Oh, yes, I am absolutely sure of it. Mr. SOURWINE. You just know nothing of any of them in detail? Mr. KARLIN. No, sir. Mr. SOURWINE. Our time is pushing. I want to run along to one or two other things. Solzhenitsyn, according to our newspapers yesterday and today, was disciplined primarily because he persisted in attacking Stalin. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwINE. What is your view on this? Mr. KARLIN. Well, that is true. That is absolutely correct, because in the third novel, he even depicted Stalin himself. Mr. SOURWINE. I will try to pronounce that right. Mr. KARLIN. This episode when Stalin talks to the Minister of KGB, Avakumov, is written, brilliantly. And of course the author hates Stalin. There is no question about it. From my point of view, it is more than anti-Stalinist novel. It is a great Russian prose which shows the evil, where that evil is, and accuses the system, including Stalin. Mr. SOURWINE. Do you think, then, that Solzhonitsyn is attacking the whole Soviet system rather than just. Stalin? Mr. KARLIN. Of course. I am sure of this, because I read his novels, because I know what it is, my past Soviet life. Mr. SOURWINE. And because his attack is couched in literature, it is going to live longer and have more effect? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, he is a man with a great talent. Mr. SOURWINE. Which, I suppose, is why they have to discipline him now? Mr. KARLIN. Correct. The point is that he pronounced the death penalty for them. Mr. SOURWINE. This might be a good place to get into the record your story of whatever it is you know, it anything, or whatever it was you heard about Stalin. Mr. KARLIN. Oh, yes. Mr. SOURWINE. You remember certain derogatory information you had heard about him? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. Tell us about that. Mr. KARLIN. Well, even from my childhood-well, it is probably not correct, but when I was 16 or 17 years old-I heard practically, let me say three stories as a rumor, or gossip. First was about Lenin's testimony before Lenin died. Mr. SOURWINE. Lenin's will? Mr. KARLIN. Lenin's will. No one knew what was that. That was a rumor, but it existed. Second was about Scholokov-that his novel, a really. great novel, \"The Quiet Don,\" was not his, that he plagiarized it. That was the the second big rumor.

Mr. SOURWINE. This was the secret police under the Tzar? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, correct. Mr. SOURwINE. Succeeded by the Cheka, after the revolution? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Even in some places, they worked and continue to do it in the same buildings, you see. Now when Khrushchev became one-man leader, he started to- how do we call it, denounce Stalin, he produced his anti-Stalin speech. After that, I know there was a conference, International Trade Union conference, something like that, with some foreign representatives. At that conference, Khrushchev said that he only started this big job, that he wanted to show the real face, real image of Stalin, he said he must continue it, must do it until the end. After that, there were hopes. People were happy with this and they thought it would be something new, a document, some new secrets would be opened, because there were many. The Leningrad case, the doctors case and so on. At that time I remember, I met one writer--but I hope no one would ever use this name. Mr. SOURWINE. You want to give this name to the committee but not on the record, even though the record is classified? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. Mr. Chairman, if that may be the order. Seanator THURMOND. It is so ordered. (The name has been recorded in the subcommittee files.) Mr. KARLIN. He is a very well-known writer. He is a Jewish writer, the Jewish community in Moscow admires him very much. He was my close friend and I would say he was a really good man, honest man very clever man. Of course, he hated Stalin, especially, probably because he was a Jew. When I met him in Moscow in Gorky Street, he told me, being in a nervous condition, he told me: \"I know exactly that in the magazine Communist, which is the Central Committee of the Communist Party magazine there are sheets, proofs, of the article devoted to Stalin and the basic point in this article is that the author proved the rumor that Stalin was the Czarist agent. He was the agent of the Okhranka. Mr. SOURWINE. He said that there were in proofs articles which contained evidence to establish that Stalin had been a Czarist agent? Mr. KARLIN. That is correct. Mr. SOURWINE. He had worked for the Okhranka? Mr. KARLIN. That is absoutely correct. I was surprised, of course, and I told him that it is impossible. He said, no, no, that is exactly so. Mr. SOURwINE. When was this supposed to have been? What time and what place? Mr. KARLIN. That was in Moscow. That was a conversation in the-- Mr. SOURWINE. No, I mean the time and place when Stalin was supposed to have worked for the Okhranka. Would that have been at Baku? Mr. KARLIN. That is what he did not tell me. That was so impor- tant, the fact itself. We did not go into details and I am not sure whether he knew the details, whether Stalin was co-opted in Batumi, Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/218gCIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 or in Tbilisi, or in Baku. I thought about this and I have my own idea about this. But what I heard from him was particularly this. Later, of course, I was expected-we called one another every day practically. We awaited this magazine and we have not seen here that article. It was not published. And I personally think that Kru- shchev later came to the decision that he had done too much, and probably he himself stopped this publication. Mr. SouRwINE. From your knowledge of your friend, do you think that he did know what he said he knew, that there were in fact such articles in proof? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, because he was a serious man and all what he had told me before, many, many different things, were very close to the truth, 90 percent of his information. He was informed well. I repeat the source was good. But there could be 10 percent-of course, there could be 10 percent against him. Mr. SouRwINE. I have two more things I would like to mention briefly before we close today. One, you have told us in detail of a number of operations in which you participated. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwINE. But when you add them all up, they are a relatively small part of the 17 years during which you worked for the KGB as a person who had been co-opted into that effort. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. How about all the rest of the time? Were you doing nothing of any importance? Mr. KARLIN. Oh, no, I am sorry. There were many other opera- tions. But I would not say that the whole 17 years, I was totally busy with the KGB. But still, I was busy. There were other operations. Do you want me to mention all of them? Mr. SouRwINE. Well, I am wondering if it would be possible for you to draw up a list of the operations and the people involved, searching your memory for the purpose, and let us have a list the next time you come back. Mr. KARLIN. Fine. Mr. SOURWINE. And if we want details about any of them, we can ask you. Mr. KARLIN. Only to mention the information and-- Mr. SouRwINE. And try to put them in the proper chronological order as far as you can. Mr. KARLIN. Sure. Mr. SounwINE. So we get a picture and account for the 17 years. Mr. KARLIN. Good. Mr. SOURWINE. Not that you owe us an accounting, but to be sure we have covered everything. Senator THURMOND. Very well, now. We will meet again on Monday. (Whereupon, at 3:50 p.m., the subcommittee was recessed, to reconvene at 10 a.m., Monday, November 17, 1969.)

The subcommittee met, pursuant to recess, at 2:10 p.m., in room' 2300, New Senate Office Building, Senator Strom Thurmond presid- ing. present: J. G. Sourwine, chief counsel; John R. Norpel, Jr., research director ; and David Martin. Senator THURMOND. The committee will come to order. Mr. Karlin, may I remind you that you are still under oath. Mr. SouRwINE. Mr. Karlin, we had started toward the end of the last session discussing the question of how did you spend your time for the KGB during the 17-year period that you were under their con- trol after you were co-opted, and I believe you had agreed you would come back at the next session, which is today, and tell us about this as near chronologically as you can, fitting in the incidents you have al- ready told us about so we can get the whole overall picture. Mr. KARLIN. I prepared the list. It put names chronologically, but some cases have happened in the same period, and therefore it is approximately chronological. Mr. SoURwINE. Sometimes there was more than one case being handled? Mr. KARLIN. That is correct. Mr. SOURWINE. By you, at the same time? Mr. KARLIN. That is correct. Mr. SoURwINE. Or to which you were assigned? Mr. KARL-IN. Yes, therefore I repeat my chronology is approximate. Mr. SOURwINE. Yes. Mr. KARLIN. The first was the Academician Schtern. That was the first operation. The second was the Academician. I don't remember correctly his name, something like Panton. Mr. SOURWINE. These men, Schtern and Panton, were both Soviet citizens? Mr. KARLIN. It is correct, and I mentioned about them. It was in the beginning when the KGB tried to give me an experience how to relate with people having KGB purpose in mind. Then third was British diplomat Bulmer. Then after that I (191) Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 199IA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Mr. SOURWINE. You told us about the Bulmer case. Mr. KARLIN. Yes, I told you about this case. Then I was sent to Germany, to last Germanyy, to Berlin, there I relate basically with the British Mayor Colby, anct the American, Bob Gray, or maybe better to say Mr. Henry, because still the relation was really with Mr. Henry. Mr. SOURWINE. Have you told us all about this operation before? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, I mentioned it. Mr. SouRwINE. This is the same one you told us about? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, sir. Mr. SOURWINE. Go ahead. Mr. KARLIN. Then when I came back to Moscow, it was a new opera- tion with the first secretary of Indian Embassy, Mr. Kaul. Then after this operation, there was another one when I had a relation with the Pakistanian diplomats, two of them, one was Koreshi, and second one Murad. Mr. SOURWINE. This brings us to what year'? Mr. KARLIN. That would be approximately 1949, including the Cana- dian case. Mr. SOURwINE. You started when? Mr. KARLIN. I started in 1946. In 1948 it was also a case with the British Major Squires, Richard Squires, which I did not mention and I would like to mention in two or three words. Mr. SouRwINE. Go ahead. Mr. KARLIN. This British major defected from the Rulir, from some- where close to Dusseldorf. He was an army major. He was taken to Moscow, and I was invited to Shubnikov. He asked me to write a book. It was so-called cold war time and at that time there was published the book by Anabella Bukar, \"From the Window of the Embassy.\" Sec- ond blow to the West which was planned by General Pedovranov was this : \"To publish the book of the British Major Squires.\" It was pretty complicated work because the major himself was sim- ply the army major from the educational department, and he had not any interesting and important information. Mr. SOURWINE. Did you have an opportunity to interview him at length? Mr. KARLIN. Oh, well, I spent with him 2 weeks. We lived together outside of Moscow, and he was not alone. He was with a German girl, Lotty, and practically I heard from the guards that the operation was done through this Lotty, that she was co-opted by the KBG in Schverin then sent to Dusseldorf to pick up some British officer. She did it. I noticed when I stayed with them for his part a real love, and it was an explanation why lie defected. Mr. SouRwINE. Had lie been questioned by the KBG before you went to- Mr. KARLIN. Yes. No question about it. Mr. SouRwINE. Were you given any briefing papers, or debriefing papers? Mr. KARLIN. No. Mr. SOURWINE. Or any case history before you went to see him? Mr. KARLIN. They invited me to the KGB. Mr. SOURWINE. All you learned about the case you learned from Squires? Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21?CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Mr. KARLIN. No, firstly from Shubnikov, then from his assistants. Mr. SoURwINE. Then Shubnikov, did he just tell you or did he give you any papers? Mr. MARLIN. No,-lie told me all his story. Mr. SOURWINE. He just told you? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, and there were contradictions. He and Pavlovsky said differently, Pavlovsky said that Squires was involved in some intelligence work. Shubnikov interrupted him and said that British major wasn't in intelligence. According to Shubnikov he was simply from the educational department. He was Catholic. Shubnikov men- tioned about his real wife. It was a French girl whom he left in Germany. At that period they did not say anything about Lotty, but the next day or two, 3 days later when I went to see Squires I went there with Colonel Pavlovsky and in the car he told me: \"Look, be a little careful because there is a German girl who came with him, and he is rather jealous.\" There was a special KGB house in a place called Malahovka. It was one of the KGB's suburb houses with two body guards and the cook, a woman. Then I worked with this Squires 2 weeks and I realized there is no way to compose any book if to use only his material, his life story, because it was a very ordinary one without any significant details. Then they told me that I would find some other information from documents which they gave me, some documents about Germany, about British officials, and Americans. At that time there was some export-import company. They wanted me to prepare some propagandistic materials about the Western Zone, and put all them into the Squires' mouth. I have done the first version of the book, and someone there at the top level read this book and they said that it is not good because that is not sharp enough, because it is not significant. They needed a big slap. Mr. SOURWINE. Did they tell you at the beginning what they wanted you to put in the book? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, in general, because, I repeat earlier, 2 or 3 months' time before the Anabella Bukar book was published, and it was a rather sensation, and they wanted to follow this, to make another sensation. I told them that that is impossible to \"improve\" Sqiures' book without other coauthors, and I recommended them to invite Bespalov. He was invited. But later they included in this job Albert Norden, who soon became the member of the 'Politburo of the SPEG, that is the Union Socialist Party in East Germany. He was one of the-I don't know-probably third or fourth man after Ulbrich. Mr. SOURWINE. Norden? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. When N( ?den put his finger in that pie, I was- automatically, they put me aside, and I do not know how they did it later. This Norden-well, the book appeared under the name of Rich- ard Squires. -112r. SoURwINE. How much of it was what you wrote and how much of it was different? Mr. KARLIN. I estimated it before my defection. I went to the library. I got this book because that was published in 1951, I guess, and I wanted to find how much in this book was written by me. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/214 IA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Well, I would say probably 15 percent was mine, and they make this book, pretty big. They invented some American General Grow or some- thing like that who lost his diary somewhere. In this diary there was some secret documents. How Richard Squires approached this docu- ment? So it was a typical example of the KGB's propaganda work. Mr. SOURWINE. It was a combination of propaganda and disinfor- mation? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, and it was some tragedy for this British officer, because he became at. that time absolutely distorted. He never thought when he defected with this girl, that these kind of things happened with him. He was actually aside. The KGB only used his name. Mr. Soi7RWINE. He wasn't even asked about it, was he? Mr. KARLIN. Later on, no, but when I started to work with him, that was a very interesting psychological process. IIe wanted to help me, but his material was poor. I wrote \"his story\" myself. When I dictated it to the typist, he heard it, you see, and one day he told me that that is all a lie, that I cannot do it. I telephoned Pavlovsky. He came, he talked to him in another room an hour and then he became absolutely obedient. It was an awful tragedy. It's a long story but I must make it shorter. Mr. SOURWINE. Go ahead, tell what .is necessary, enough to at least identify the case. Mr. KARLIN. Being in London in 1965 I read in \"Evening Stand- ard\" the story about Richard Squires. Suddenly one English columnist discovered him in Moscow, and published some absolutely fantastic story, saying the KGB used Squires as the agent, that Squires visited London, and that he is an important man in the foreign emigrant community in Moscow. Well, there were some details which were correct, but there was mis- leading information, too, and I am sure that this type of man would not be used by the KGB to send him illegally to London. Squires was not this kind of man. Therefore, I think it was only the sensation which was created by this British correspondent. Now after this operation, there was another one which I did not men- tion before : An Australian, Cecile Osborn. She was a cipher worker in the Australian Embassy. I was introduced to the Soviet co-opted girl named Irina, who was the teacher of Russian language from the organization which I mentioned before, UPDK, that is the bureau which makes all services for the diplomatic corps in Moscow. She worked for this bureau, and she taught Osborn Russian lan- guage. The operation was like that: Cecile and Irina went to the Bolshoi Theater to hear the opera \"Count Igor.\" They have in third or fourth line, two chairs, and mine was next. In the interval I started to talk to them. Then we went all together to walk a little bit in the foyer. Of course this Irina helped me in every way to create the good impression, and had an opportunity to give Australian girl my telephone and to ask her telephone. Well, we succeeded, and I telephoned her later. We went to see another theater performance. Then we went to the restaurant. I met her three or four times, and in that time the case officer, the KGB officer who controlled this case, who was responsible for it was Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/iu CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Samoylov. In that time I guess he was only a lieutenant, but before I left Moscow in 1963 I heard that Samoylov became a top-level KGB man in the First Chief Directorate. Working with the MI-5 people in London I found his picture. He visited England being among dele- gation of the Soviet teachers. This man pushed me energetically to seduce Cecile. One day they came to my flat, Osborn and Irina, 'because still she helped me, in all this operation. Well, I did not seduce Cecile. I could not do it. I do not want to say I was puritanist, simply she was not attractive-therefore I tried to avoid sexual relation. I tried to convert our relation in intellectual area. Particularly one day she visited my place, we discussed some politics. Some literature, all that, and the next day when I met Samoylov he even cried and he said : \"Please, please don't talk about politics and literature. She needs different, she needs you as a man, she wants to feel herself being with you as a woman. Do something in this way.\" For him it was at the time so important. Ile was a young man and this was maybe one of his first cases and he wanted to succeed at any price. Still the operation ended without results, and Cecile went back to Australia. She showed me before some pictures of her family and her nephews, I guess. 'She gave me her address. It means that the operation ended without any profit for KGB. Mr. SouRwINE. They were not happy with you 'a'bout that, I imagine? Mr. KARLIN. Who? Mr. SOURWINE. The KGB. Mr. KARLIN. Yes, they were not happy. Particularly this Samoylov was unhappy, but still they could not press me in the physical way, you see, and that was the same thing which happened later with Marie Claire Dejean. I guess it is correct, that they were not happy and they were many times not happy with me, but still they needed me, they told me that I have a rather special ability to attract foreigners. Next case, Jack Raymond, the American corresponent. After that or probably before that the Marguerite Higgins case which I depicted, too, and Bill Jordan which I also mentioned. Now there is something which I did not mention. It is the British correspondent, John Rettie. I was introduced to him by Colonel Barsegov who used his agent's name, Borodin. He worked himself -among the foreign correspondents, being known as the correspondent of the Literary Gazette. I had, I think, 3 or 4 months' relation with this Rettie. I met him many times in different places. Then he introduced me to his wife, Molly. She was a Finnish girl, absolutely blonde, very beautiful. Later Barsegov gave this case to Captain,Churanov, who actually 'tried to recruit Rettie. Once Churanov told me that he knows there is something false be- tween Molly and Rettie, then a little bit later I realized what really happened, because among the Moscow foreign correspondents there was one French Sheray and this Sheray had love relation with Molly. Twice or three times I was with them all together. There was Rettie, Molly, Sheray and Saharenko, another French correspondent. IIe came only for few days from Paris. We went to the concert and I noticed that there was really not a nice relation between Rettie and Molly. 45-158 0-70-pt. 3-3 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 196 Then one day Captain Churanov told me that he would like to work himself with Nettie under the name Fedorov, that it is necessary for me to call Rettie, and to invite him and his wife to the restaurant, and to mention that I would be not alone but with my \"friend.\" I did it. They of course came and I introduced Fedorov to John as the worker of one Society of Friendly Relations between the U.S.S.R. and the Foreign Countries. I introduced him as the employee of this Society. Soon Molly went, I guess, to Finland to see her parents, and Fedorov met Rettie once or twice with me, and then he did all the rest himself. So, from that time I never have seen John again. I can say only that he was a nice guy. He brought me from London a great present. He brought five or 10 books with the best plays writ- ten by British playwrights. He was a very intelligent man. What happened later according to Churanov was this : Rettie was rather nervous. He with one other foreigner, I don't know who was that man, decided to drink and they met the Russian girls, two of them, I guess, or maybe three of them (of course they were KGB girls) and they invited them to his flat, which I visited once. This flat was in one of the special buildings for foreigners near the Riga railway station and they drank there and these girls created scandal. Of course, the Soviet police were somewhere close, and they came and wrote an official protocol that two foreigners wanted to rape two Soviet girls. What happened later? Federov told me he had seen Rettie and opened his \"card\" and said, \"I -am from KGB. If you will not work for us we will publish all this story and it will be trouble for you. It will be particular trouble for your career.\" Iheard from the MI-5 people that Rettie immediately reported all that to the Embassy and went back to London. That is all. Now let me mention the case which we discussed. It is Australian Communist Burchette. Then the very short, but pretty unique story. At that time the rela- tion between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Government was not so good, and the KGB decided to look into the Yugoslavian Embassy. There was such a Yugoslvanian diplomat Bogich, and that was the case which was conducted again by Colonel Barsegov and Kartser. Barsegov sent a special telegram to the Soviet. Embassy in Canada to find some probably Ukrainian newspaper which would accredit me in Moscow as their free lance correspondent. The answer wasn't posi- tive, therefore I was told to go to Yugoslavian Embassy, see Bogich who was a cultural attache, and tell him that I want to be a free lance correspondent from one of the Yugoslavian newspapers, probably \"Borba,\" or something like that. I went to see Bogich. He was handsome, cultured gentleman, and he talked to me in a nice way, but I realized that he understood what is going on, and he told me that he would like to help me, that he would send a letter to \"Borba,\" and then he would telephone me. He perhaps sent a letter, I don't know, but maybe to another Yugoslavian organization, and he never called me back and I never have seen him since. But still an attempt was done. Then another case was the cook in the English Embassy, the personal cook of Ambassador Hunter of Great Britain. His name was Christ, I know only this, Christ. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/7. CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 In his past he was a sailor. He was a real drunkard, and he wanted to make love with the Soviet KGB girl Tonya. She worked in the Embassy as a servant and he wanted to make love with her, but there was no place to meet and she introduced me as her brother-in-law. He visited me many times. Churanov's idea was to make him drunk once, a second time, and then to offer him money, to give him money, because he needed money, and to get a receipt from him, to get his sig- nature, once, and to repeat it. Then Churanov wanted to beat him, to show that the opposite side is very strong and merciless, and to recruit him, saying : \"Look, these are your signatures here. You owe money from the IGB and you must work for us now.\" I do not know whether they realized this second part of the operation, but my part was done. We met three or four times. He drank in my place pretty much. I do not know what they had done later. Then there is a French case, the whole French case, to which I must add the French girl Francois de Damper. She was a cipher girl there. Major Andreev told me that there is a Soviet man, Petrov, who had been in France and who met her there. Then this man came back to Moscow and lie worked in Moscow Radio and he knew her. He met the French girl once or twice in Moscow, too, when she came to Moscow to work in the French Embassy. The KGB wanted to do this : Petrov would invite her to the restaurant and occasionally I would be there. Being Petrov's \"friend\" I would come to their table and he would introduce me to her. But nothing like this happened, because when he telephoned her two or three times, she told him that she was busy and she could not come to meet him. Therefore, Major Andreev found for me another way to be ac- quainted with the French girl. Francois had a Russian teacher, a Soviet lady in Moscow. Later she went to Prague to work there in some Soviet office, but she still had a friendly relation with the French girl. The KBG composed this fable : I was in Prague and met this teacher because she was my teacher a long, long time ago too. When I said to her that I am going back to Moscow the Russian lady said : \"Probably you will be kind enough to take a letter to my French friend,\" and she gave me a letter and a telephone number and I called the French girl and I said to her; \"I brought from Prague a letter for you.\" All that, so to say, was done, but De Damper was a very sharp and clever girl, and I guess she realized something because there were many other attempts to introduce some Russian to her, and she told me over the telephone that it would be better if I would send the letter by post. No, before this she told me that she would not be able to meet me because she is on the way to Paris for her vacation, and then she said, \"Please put this letter to the mail box and I would get it.\" When I reported our telephone conversation to Major Andreev she told me that it is nonsense, she is not going anywhere, she is here and she would be here, and she simply does not want to have any relation with any Russian. Later Andreev told me that all that probably happened, because particularly in that time, according to Andreev, this French girl had a love affair with an American correspondent in Moscow, whom, it seems to me, she later married. Mr. SOURWINE. How many correspondents did she marry? Did I hear that right? Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 :ICIIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Mr.KARLIN. Major Andreev, when she tried to explain to me why it ended unsuccessfully said well, she had a love affair with the Amer- ican correspondent, and that later this correspondent married Francois de Damper. The next little case was again-the French girl Ravel. She worked in the French Exhibition in Moscow in 1961. Major Andreev told me that Ravel visited Russia before and had some special relation with some Soviet people, and the KGB suspects her. Andreev wanted me to come to the Exhibition and to meet her and to talk to her and maybe to relate with her, trying to understand what sort of person she is. The KGB gave me her picture. I went two or three times to the Exhibition, but I could not find her, and all ended without any result. There was only an attempt. I never met Ravel. The next operation would be the Indian Ambassador, the Extraor- dinary and Plenipotentiary, Kaul ; the same Kaul who was the First Secretary of the Indian Embassy a long time ago. I would say the last operation which I must mention, is my relation with the First Secretary of the Mexican Embassy, Ormando Contu. The French Ambassador's wife, Marie Claire, mentioned once that she is,very friendly with the wife of the Mexican Ambassador, and in that time I wrote a movie script for the Mexican firm Zaharia Film. The script was entitled \"The Rose of Castiliano.\" The KGB decided to use an opportunity and to organize some operation in a direction toward Mexicans. I told Marie Claire that I would be happy to be introduced to the Mexican Ambassador, and to give him my script to read, because I need to be cooperative with Mexicans and I would like to have a good relation with the Mexican Embassy in Moscow. Marie Claire telephoned to the Mexican Ambassador's wife, who told her that I as a friend of Marie Claire, has to call to Ormando Contu and has to meet him first, and then he would introduce me to the Ambassador and his wife. Marie Claire gave me a telephone number. I called Ormando Contu. I met him. He was a young man, handsome, and I would say with an ability to control himself. I met him many times. The KGB case-officer was Alexei Mikhailovich. At that time, particularly I have heard from the KGB officer that there are two different groups of the foreign embassies in Moscow. One group is-the closed embassies others the opened, and the Mexican was among the opened in that time. Once when I went to meet Contu at the Mexican Embassy, I noticed it was not guarded as much as for instance the French Embassy was. The KGB officer told me that according to his information that Contu is a nice guy. He came here with the idea to have a friendly relation with the Soviet people, to try to understand them and so on. Later on, when I was ready to go to Japan, I remember Contu wanted to give me the address of one of his fellow Mexicans in Tokyo. He wanted me to take some gift for him from Moscow, but the KGB told me it would be better to avoid all this. So before I went to Tokyo, I did not call him and later when I came back to Moscow, I said to him that I could not call him. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/219 CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 In the second part of our relation, the situation changed. Alexei Mikhailovich told me that Contu has a very close relation with Amer- icans, that Americans ordered him to relate with me, and that even an idea of Mexican fellow and \"gift\" was American's. Another word, the KGB now wanted to show me Contu as the American agent, but still they wanted me to meet him and to hear what he is talking about, and in that time he got a new apartment in the new house for foreigners, and he wanted to invite me to a house warming, he wanted to organize some parties with girls and so on. When I told the KGB, all that they told me he is a homosexual. Well, in the case with Major Colby I suspected it myself. I would not say that I had any evidences, concerning Contu. When the KGB wants to black relation between foreigners and its co-opted man they very often use this arm. Then the IKGB told me it is better to end this relation, and I did not call Contu even before I left Moscow. I want to underline that still there was some risk in my relation with Contu. Once Major Andreev mentioned about it, because practically it was at the same time when I related with the Indian Ambassador. It is probably all operations against foreigners which I participated within 17 years of my collaboration with the KGB. Mr. SOURWINE. You have mentioned in connection with the Mexican the statement that he had homosexual tendencies or was a homosexual. You remember earlier in telling us about your experience in Berlin many years before? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwINE. You told us you had gone to a homosexual nightclub. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwINE. Have you had enough experience with homosexuals to be able to tell one, when you saw one? Mr. KARLIN. Well, I can try, at least.. I am not sure of this. Still from my point of view, as I mentioned, Contu was not a homosexual because, well, still, I guess a homosexual-well, I heard there could be such homosexuals who could at the same time have a great interest to females. Contu wanted to talk about females, and he looked at girls in cafes and so on, therefore from my point of view he was a normal man. Mr. SouRwINE. Have you had many dealings with homosexuals? Mr. KARLIN. No, sir. I hate them. Mr. SouRwINE. Have you had much experience with them? Mr. KARLIN. No, sir. Mr. SouRwINE. You do not consider yourself an expert on the subject? Mr. KARLIN. Psychologically, yes, I guess, being an old man as I am, experienced one, a writer, I can be expert in everything, I must, I guess, but not scientifically, of course. One can even look into the eyes of people and find who they are. I hope I have a little bit this sort of ability. Mr. SouRwINE. You have the opinion that you can tell by looking? Mr. KARLIN. It would be enough probably to tell myself who I think this gentleman is, but I would not be able and I would never cate- gorically say I'm sure I'm right. Mr. SouRwINE. I understand.

Mr. KARLIN. Oh, no. Mr. SouRwINE. Were any of the people with you homosexuals at the time, in your judgment? Mr. KARLIN. It was a cafe of homosexuals. There I had seen first time in my life something absolutely disgraceful. Man danced with man. One was young, rosy, beautiful, you can use this word, another was too masculine, and they danced together and they took a seat and they put some drugs in their drinks. Later there was a \"girl's show\" and then I realized all of them were boys. Mr. SOURWINE. Was that the only time you visited such a place? Mr. KARLIN. No, sir, I repeat it, in San Francisco, when I have been here in 1964. We went to this pretty funny, and interesting theater. Mr. SouRwINE. When you went in Berlin were any of the people who went with you homosexuals in your opinion? Mr. KARLIN. Major Colby was with me and he could be only one person whom I could suspect. Mr. SOURWINE. Did he pick the place to go? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, sir, it was his idea, to go to that place, but that was a known place in Berlin. Cafe \"Hanks\" was a very known place. Mr. SouRwINE. Yes, it was known as a homosexual place. Mr. KARLIN. Right. Mr. SOURWINE. But that is not a reason for picking it, unless one wants to go to that kind of a place. Mr. KARLIN. He told me : \"Let's go to see the night life in Berlin.\" It was a natural thing you know, to show me different places. But I realized that he was familiar with \"Hanka\" because he was greeted there by many people. I remember, for example, that I told him if that would be my right, I would take a gun and I would kill all of them and he said, \"That is the difference between your Soviet vandals and us civilized people. If they like it, give them way to do it, you see.\" Mr. SOURWINE. Were those the only two occasions that you had to go to such a place, once in Mr. KARLIN. What do you mean, the second one? Which one? Mr. SouRwINE. You said you did in San Francisco. Mr. KARLIN. Oh, yes ; but it was a theater. Mr. SouRwINE. If I summarize improperly, please correct me. Mr. KARLIN. OK. Mr. SOURWINE. You have told us that you were co-opted by the KGB, that over a period of 17 years you assisted in various assign- ments as they were given to you, various operations, some of which would be explained to you fully, some of which were explained to you less fully? Mr. KARLIN. Correct. Mr. SouRwINE. You were given particular objectives in each instance ? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwINE. Mainly the objectives of the KGB in these cases broke into two groups, the gathering of information, either about the individual to whom you were assigned, or through him, from him, about other persons or things. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 201 Mr. KARLIN. Right. Mr. SoURwINE. Or second, the compromising of an individual. Mr. KARLIN. To recruit the individual. Mr. SoURwINE. So that he could be used. Recruiting is only one of the ways he might be used? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, correct. Mr. SoURwINE. And I think in some of the cases you told us the compromising was accomplished, and the individual was used, and yet was not recruited. Mr. KARLIN. It's correct, sir. Mr. SoURwINE. Then I do not think we had specifically discussed means, but I will ask you if it is not true, judging from all that you have said so far, that among the various means that were used were what we might call cozening , offering friendship, persuasion, also on occasion blackmail and threats? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, and even beating. Mr. SoURwINE. Physical? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. The use of physical force? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SounwINE. And in different operations one or all of these have been used during your 17 years of experience? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. Now you told us earlier-I am trying to pull to- gether some loose threads-you have now mentioned twice during the course of your testimony the difference between a closed and an open embassy. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwiNE. I wish you would explain. You may have done so already, but if so, try to do it in different words now, so that we may be sure we understand, what in KGB terms is a closed embassy, what is an open embassy. Mr. KARLIN. Sir, I would be able only to repeat what I have been said because I cannot give you a complete answer, still, you know, I wasn't an officer of the KGB. I was only co-opted. Mr. SoURwINE. I understand. Mr. KARLIN. I was a co-opted worker, and therefore occasionally by my relation with some KGB officers, who were with me more friendly than it was necessary for them to be, I knew more than used to be known for co-opted worker. Nevertheless, I cannot depict for you the complete picture and there could be even some contradictions in my records. Sorry, but it is so. Let me tell you-now this : Take a whole \"service,\" in quotation marks, which the KGB makes for the American Embassy in Moscow. It is a colossal \"service\" and pretty expensive one. Many people involve in it. They \"serve\" not only the embassy they \"take care' of houses and places where Americans stay, where tfiey go, and so on. All that is an enormously big and expensive job. All this looks differently if you would take, let's say again, this Mexican Embassy, which I think could be somewhere between an opened and a closed embassy. Mexico is pretty close to the United States and has a lot of similar interests and one can penetrate the Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 202 United States through Mexico. Therefore I guess, and as far as I remember they told me the Mexican Embassy is an opened one, but not exactly. Of course, Afghanistan for example, or maybe the Ceylon Embassy, by the KGB classification would be opened embassies. The KGB wouldn't \"serve\" them in such an 'ntensive and serious way. So the cornerstone is political interest. Physically first of all you need to control the whole foreign houses, accesses to these houses. Then you must think about the special Soviet people who work in those closed embassies because there, I guess 100 percent are KGB officers or collaborators. Those people you must pay more. They must be better qualified, be more experienced, you see. Still that is a valuable thing. But the KGB can put III an opened embassy ordinary people, not so good paid. I repeat : from my point of view everything depends on a political matter. Of course, all this is approximately. When the KGB \"realized\" that Contu had a relation with the Americans, that he \"works\" for Americans if it was true, the situation particularly for Cantu, changed. The KGB paid more attention to him. Therefore, I think this is rather technical division. They use this word an opened embassy meaning that they would not pay so much attention to it, much attention, but not so much. Mr. SouxwINE. The term \"closed\" and \"open\" embassy, if I under- stand you correctly, is used in the KGB with reference to the KGB's own attitude and responsibilities with resepct to the embassy. Mr. KARLIN. Oh, Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. And also with respect to how KGB members or persons such as yourself who are working with the KGB must or may comport themselves when they are visiting such an embassy. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SorRwINE. That is involved also ; is it not? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, it is particularly the KGB term, it is their terminology. Mr. SouR\\INE. In the case of an open embassy, a KGB person, either an officer or person such as you could visit rather freely? Mr. KARLIN. Yes ; it is correct. Mr. SOURwINE. In the case of a closed embassy, you could not visit without permission there? Mr. KARLIN. It is correct. Something like it, by the way, happened, really when I went the first time to see the Indian Ambassador. It was all prepared, maybe they did it specially, but still it was not easy and there wasn't free access to the Indian Embassy at all. Of course one wouldn't be able to go free to the American Embassy in Moscow too. I mean being a common, ordinary Soviet man. The police would stop you. Mr. SouxwINE. Would the ordinary Soviet man go to any foreign embassy? Mr. KARLIN. Honestly, I doubt it. Mr. SOURWINE. How about the Embassy of other Communist countries? Mr. KARLIN. Well, again I think maybe there is a free access with some sort of control, but I repeat, I do not know it exactly, and I think it all depends on the particular situation, you see. Approved For Release 2005/11/21 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Approved For Release 2005/1 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000500140002-0 Mr. SOURWINE. Does the KGB maintain a full and complete cover- age on all the embassy personnel in the U.S. Embassy? Mr. KARLIN. I guess so. If there is not 100 percent coverage I think there is 99 percent cover- age. I think you must expect particularly this if you don't want to be fooled. Mr. SOURWINE. There is a much looser surveillance over, for in- stance, the personnel of the Afghanistan Embassy? Mr. KARLIN. Again, they, of course, try to control them, too, but I think there is a small section in the KGB with three or five men who are \"responsible\" for Afghanistanians. If they would realize that the Afghanistan Embassy is a rather special place where there are meet- ings between, let's say, Americans or British, they probably would declare the Afghanistan Embassy the closed one. Mr. SouRwINE. Let's go back to the Mexican Embassy. Are all of the Embassy staff personnel of the Mexican Embassy in Moscow kept under surveillance at all times? Mr. KARLIN. I remember once I met Contu, and he came not alone, he came with another Mexican girl, and another Russian girl. There were two of them, only for a couple minutes. Then later they left us. Another girl was the Soviet, and she worked in the Embassy, and I think that is one of the best way for them to know what is going on in an embassy generally talking of course. They like to put one of the Soviet employees in such a position as a secretary in the reception. Mr. SouRwINE. I think from what you have said earlier about hav- ing to use a better class of people in closed embassies Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. It must be your impression, and I ask you if it is not, that the U.S.S.R. nationals who work in foreign embassies are all in contact with and under the control of the KGB? Mr. KARLIN. Oh, yes. Mr. SOURWINE. In one way or another? Mr. KARLIN. Oh, yes, it is absolutely true. Mr. SouRwINE. In one degree or another. Mr. KARLIN. Sure. Mr. SouRwINE. Now to go back to another loose end, you told us that you had brought out with you when you left the U.S.S.R. micro- film of a manuscript. Mr. KARLIN. It is correct. Mr. SouRwINE. That you had yourself prepared. Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SouRwINE. Now what happened to this manuscript? Mr. KARLIN. When I defected, I gave to the British Intelligence Service those microfilms and all my documents, which I had, and then they did not give me these back. Instead of this, they gave me only one copy of my manuscript which they made a print of. It hap- pened when I came from the U.S.A., back to England in 1965. Mr. SouRwINE. You never got the microfilm back? Mr. KARLIN. No, sir. Mr. SouRwINE. And you did not get a print or a copy until 1965 ? Mr. KARLIN. It is correct. Mr. SouRwINE. During 6 months or thereabouts of 1964 you were in the United States? Mr. KARLIN. Yes, sir.

Having been brought here by an agency of the United States? Mr. KARLIN. It is correct. Mr. SOURWINE. Was there a copy of that manuscript over here while you were over here? Mr. KARLIN. Probably. Mr. SOURWINE. If you know. Mr. KARLIN. I have seen one copy of it in the hands of the Ameri- cans who worked with me here. Mr. SOURWINE. In the United States? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. Then there was a copy here? Mr._KARLIN. Yes; but that was not mine, you see. That was theirs. Mr. SOURWINE. There was a copy. You recognized it? Mr. KARLIN. Oh, Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. It was a copy, a photocopy I take 't? Mr. KARLIN. No; I think it was Xerox. Mr. SOURwINE. A Xeroxed copy? Mr. KARLIN. Yes ; because this one which they gave me Mr. SOURIVINE. Of the manuscript which you had microfilmed? Mr. KARLIN. Yes. Mr. SOURWINE. It must have been a Xeroxed copy of a print, then. Mr. KARLIN. Yes; and there was a copy I guess of the translation into English, too. Mr. SOURWINE. Did you make a translation? Mr. KARLIN. No. Someone did it for MI-5. Mr. SOURWINE. Who made the translation; if you know? Mr. KARLIN. They told me, the British told me that they did it and they said they paid, I don't know, 5,000 pounds for it. Mr. SOURWINE. Who gave you the translation ? Mr. KARLIN. No one gave me it, but I have seen it. British officers showed me it. Mr. SOURWINE. How did you come to see it? Who showed you? Mr. KARLIN. They showed me, these British officials, they showed me a rather thick volume, and they underlined what a great job they have done. Later when I came back from the United States, when MI-5 refused me to try to publish my manuscript, I said, why not think about the publication without real names, without real evidences and facts. They said, let's see what will be. I said, I want. to write it in English. I needed that translation which they have done. And they brought me partly by 10-15 pages a week that translation. Mr. SOURWINE. Did you see the translation of the whole manuscript? Mr. KARLIN. Only in British official's hands, never in my hands. Mr. SOURWINF. In your own hands you saw only portions of it? Mr. KARLIN. Correct., sir. Mr. SOURWINE. Perhaps 10 pages at a time? Mr. KARLIN. Yes; by 10 pages but not the whole manuscript. Mr. SOURWINE. You never saw the whole thing, even 10 pages at a time? Mr..KARLIN. I have seen it all, but never had it. Mr. SOURWINE. I mean you saw several fragments of 10 or some other number of pages.
