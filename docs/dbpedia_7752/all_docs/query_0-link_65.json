        "text": "Faculty and Graduate Student Fellowship awards have been at the center of HRI since its inception, with application guidelines published in the fall of the academic year prior to the fellowship year, and an announcement date in late winter.\n\nThe fellowship program typically revolves around an annual topic, and the fellowship provides an opportunity for faculty and graduate student fellowship recipients to develop research related to the theme in all of its many broad interpretations. Since fall 1998, HRI has awarded faculty fellowships and graduate student fellowships to U of I scholars in more than 40 departments.\n\nView current campus fellows.\n\n2022-23: Un/Doing\n\nFaculty Fellows\n\nJanett Barragán Miranda (Latina/Latino Studies)\n\n“Hungering for Equality: The Community of Mexican-Origin from Post-WWII to Civil Rights”\n\nYuridia Ramírez (History)\n\n“Indigeneity on the Move: Transborder Politics from Michoacán to North Carolina”\n\nDeena Rymhs (American Indian Studies)\n\n“Putting back together: re-worldings in annie ross’s Pots and Other Living Beings”\n\nR.
