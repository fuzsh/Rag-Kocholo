        "text": "NEW ORLEANS — Step Up Louisiana announced a “once in a generation” investment in grassroots organizing in the Deep South. The Fall for Liberation is an organizing drive that will train 50 Southeast Louisiana residents on community, labor and electoral organizing. With plans to knock on more than 100,000 doors and have thousands of conversations with workers and voters in our communities, the project has the potential to reshape upcoming elections in Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Jefferson Parish.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the Civil Rights Movement’s Freedom Summer, the Fall for Liberation seeks to build on the legacy of other movements like the Fight for $15 that have used a large-scale investment in organizing capacity to win rights and raises for working class Louisianans. Despite the victories of these movements, Black Louisianans live 8% shorter lives than white Louisianans, and Black residents in communities with industrial plants experience seven to 21 times more toxic air emissions than similar communities with more white residents. Seventy-six percent of students at F-rated schools are Black, while only seven percent are white.\n\n...\n\nLeaders of nonprofits Women with a Vision and the Power Coalition on Monday started the week by cutting the ribbon on a brand-new voter engagement center in New Orleans’ Central City neighborhood.\n\nThe center, next door to WWAV’s office, has four round tables with purple and green velvet chairs, as well as plush window seating and countertop space in front of a wall of greenery. The nonprofits plan to use the space to have open office hours, where people can stop by and ask any questions they may have about voting this fall.\n\nIt also will be a place that groups and residents can use to host voting events, even if that’s just some friends getting together.\n\n“There are so many misconceptions about who can vote, when you vote, what to do to vote and how to get engaged, and some people feel a lot of shame about not knowing that,” WWAV Executive Director Deon Haywood told Gambit. “We just wanted to create a space where people felt like they can get anything they needed around voting.”\n\n...\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Black voters asked the Supreme Court to take up a case to determine whether Louisiana will maintain the map enacted by the state legislature this year, which includes two majority-Black districts, following the 2024 elections. The appeal in Robinson v. Callais comes after the Court granted an emergency stay in May, pausing a district court’s decision to overturn the map, and allowing it to go into effect for the 2024 elections. The question remains whether the map will stand for the remainder of the decade until the next redistricting process.\n\nLouisiana’s current congressional map was drawn in direct response to a separate lawsuit, Robinson v. Landry. There, a federal court found that the state’s map passed in 2022, which included only one majority-Black district, likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). The same Black voters and civic organizations who filed today with the Supreme Court are responsible for that landmark win, which has been sustained on appeal.\n\n“In January, the Louisiana Legislature finally did what it should have done in 2022: pass a fair map that reflects the diversity of the great state of Louisiana,” said Stuart Naifeh, redistricting manager for the Legal Defense Fund. “It was wrong for the lower court to disrupt the state’s effort to do the right thing and throw the 2024 election into chaos. The Supreme Court set that right for this election cycle by allowing, and as our filing explains, federal law and the Constitution require that Louisiana maintain this new map until the next census.”\n\n“This year, Black voters in Louisiana will have an opportunity to elect their candidates of choice for two congressional seats—the same should be true moving forward,” said Ashley Shelton, president/CEO of Power Coalition for Equity and Justice. “The law, and basic principles of fairness, point in this direction. Black voters have mobilized since the beginning of the redistricting process in Louisiana. We will continue to mobilize to the polls. And we will continue to fight for fair maps until these cases are complete.”\n\n...\n\nA Louisiana voting rights advocacy group is touring the state this summer to register Black voters and educate residents on their voting rights in order to increase turnout in the 2024 elections.\n\nIn honor of the 1964 Freedom Summer voter registration drive, the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice is going to cities across Louisiana on a tour named after the historic civil rights era political action. The group is registering residents to vote in these cities and informing them on how to navigate potential barriers to vote. For instance, organizers have been teaching residents about a new state law going into effect Aug. 1, stipulating that only immediate family members or voter registrar employees will be able to assist with absentee ballots for more than one voter.\n\nThe tour also features information on polling locations and speakers from various social justice and social support organizations, such as the NAACP, Voice of the Experienced and Women with a Vision.\n\nIn addition to the presidential election, voters in Louisiana will decide in November on six congressional seats, a state Supreme Court judgeship and a ballot measure related to federal revenues from energy production. Ashley Shelton, founder and CEO of the Power Coalition, said her organization wants to make sure Louisiana voters know what is on the ballot.\n\n“We need voters to make it down the ballot and understand the power they have to change not only their communities but the country,” Shelton said.\n\n...\n\nThe New Orleans City Council on Thursday voted to waive parking fees for the streets surrounding City Hall during early voting periods — in time for the presidential election this fall.\n\nThe state assigns registered voters a specific early voting location, and for many in New Orleans, that’s City Hall, which is located in the Central Business District with paid street parking. The city will put up signs that say the free short-term parking is for voters only.\n\nEarly voting for the presidential election runs 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Oct. 18-29, excluding both Sundays. Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nVoting advocate and BikeNVote founder Morgan Walker brought the idea to the council to help make voting easier for people heading to City Hall.\n\nWalker “actually brought this to my attention about how often people come to try to early vote at City Hall, but there’s no parking or it’s a difficulty for some to pay for the parking,” said Council President Helena Moreno at a council committee meeting Wednesday.\n\n...\n\nA slew of laws quietly passed during the most recent Louisiana legislative session will make rules surrounding absentee voting more strict during the upcoming November election and beyond.\n\nThe changes are most likely to impact voters with disabilities and could also affect Democrats, who are more likely to vote by mail than their Republican counterparts.\n\nThough Louisiana has a strong election security system, Louisiana Secretary of State Nancy Landry said the changes would “bring us closer to being ranked first in the nation for election integrity.”\n\nBut critics say the laws amount to voter suppression, and a lawsuit has been filed alleging the rules will harm disabled voters. Also of concern is how the changes will impact those assisting elderly or disabled voters in filling out their ballots.\n\n...\n\nBlack voters in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, were outraged when a state judge ruled last Decemberthat their favored candidate for sheriff, Henry Whitehorn, had to submit to a third election after he won a runoff by one vote and a recount confirmed his one-vote margin of victory.\n\nThrowing out the election results particularly stung because Whitehorn would not only be the first Black sheriff in Caddo Parish, but one of only a handful of Black sheriffs in Louisiana history.\n\nWhitehorn is a Black man with decades of Louisiana law enforcement experience, including 10 years as a U.S. marshal after President Barack Obama nominated him for the position. His challenger was a lawyer without law enforcement credentials.\n\n“We were aghast that they wouldn’t uphold the recount,” said Billy Anderson, the North Louisiana organizer for the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice. “Sometimes an election can come down to race.”\n\n...\n\nSHREVEPORT, La. – It’s a story KTBS 3 has been covering for weeks, water is to be shut off at the end of the month at the Pines, Villa Norte, and The Jolie apartments due to unpaid water bills, leaving hundreds of residents in search of a new home.\n\nRecently the city scheduled additional meetings for relocation assistance.\n\nMany residents came for relocation help with 9 days left to move out, leaving many still desperate for help.\n\n“I recommend nobody will have to ever, ever live like this. You know, do the things that we’re going through. We are trying to do better. We just in a situation to what we cannot do better right now. We all have a cry right now for help,” said Tracey Collins, resident of The Jolie Apartments.\n\nAround 60 people showed up to Friday’s relocation meetings, 30 of them have found new homes.\n\n...\n\nSHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) — Displaced residents of three Shreveport apartment complexes met with city officials during emergency relocation assistance meetings Tuesday (May 21) evening.\n\nIn just 10 days, water service will be discontinued at The Jolie, Villa Norte and Pines apartments. That has hundreds of residents searching for a place to live.\n\n“We’re asking for help. We’re needing help tremendously right now. We’re needing help bad,” said Tracey Collins, a resident of The Jolie Apartments.\n\nDozens of Shreveport families are searching for a new place to call home after receiving notice that their utilities would be disconnected at the end of the month.\n\n“So now I have no air in my apartment unit; I have no running water in my apartment unit,” Collins said.\n\nBut for some residents at The Jolie, they were given no notice and already are experiencing utility shutoffs.\n\n“I have four kids in my apartment that are in heat. My thermostat is on 81º,” Collins said. “I have no running water. I have to get out and Doordash every day to make sure I can get enough water to flush.”\n\n...\n\nSHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) – An emergency program has been announced to assist residents who will be displaced when utilities are cut off at two apartment complexes in Shreveport.\n\nOn May 15, the City of Shreveport announced an Emergency Apartment Relocation Assistance Program for the residents of two apartments, Jolie and Villa Norte. The program has been introduced following the announcement that utilities will be cut off at both apartment complexes on May 31 due to unpaid bills.\n\nMultiple apartment complexes will soon have their water turned off due to lack of payments.\n\nThe program aims to provide necessary aid and resources to support the residents.\n\nBoth meetings regarding the program will be held on May 17.\n\n...\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily reinstated a congressional map in Louisiana that includes a second majority-Black district, increasing the likelihood that Democrats could gain a House seat from the state in the November election.\n\nThe move could be particularly significant in an election cycle in which the balance of power in the House is likely to be determined by a handful of races.\n\nThe order was unsigned, as is the Supreme Court’s custom in ruling on emergency applications. It came in response to a challenge to a lower-court decision that had blocked the map drawn by Louisiana’s Republican-controlled Legislature, deeming it a racial gerrymander.\n\n...\n\nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday paved the way for Louisiana to use a congressional map in this year’s election that includes two majority-Black districts.\n\nThe court granted emergency requests filed by an unlikely alliance of Republican state officials and civil rights groups, who were united in asking the high court to block a lower court ruling that invalidated the most recently drawn map. State officials had said they needed to have the map finalized by Wednesday to meet bureaucratic deadlines and avoid “disarray.”\n\nThe court’s three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writing that the state still had time to draw a map that would address the various legal questions that have been raised. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.\n\n...\n\nSHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) – An emergency program has been announced to assist residents who will be displaced when utilities are cut off at two apartment complexes in Shreveport.\n\nOn May 15, the City of Shreveport announced an Emergency Apartment Relocation Assistance Program for the residents of two apartments, Jolie and Villa Norte.

(KSLA) — The trial over a lawsuit attempting to overthrow Louisiana’s new congressional map will continue Wednesday (April 10).\n\nThe hearing before a three-judge panel is being held in Shreveport. It began Monday and could last at least one more day.\n\nEarlier this year, Louisiana lawmakers were tasked with making the map after a judge said a previous one violated the Voting Rights Act. The judge said Louisiana must have two majority-minority districts since one-third of its population is African-American. The previous map had one such district.\n\nUnder the latest map, the new 6th Congressional District extends from southern Caddo Parish through Natchitoches and Alexandria to Baton Rouge. The new boundaries jeopardize Republican Congressman Garret Graves’ place in Congress.\n\n..."
