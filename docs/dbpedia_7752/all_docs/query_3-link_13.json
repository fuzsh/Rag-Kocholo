        "text": "Louisiana Citizens Policyholders will receive a rate reduction and bad faith claims against Louisiana Citizens will be limited to the policy's limit if Legislature Acts Sam Karlin continues his reporting of the Louisiana legislative session with instant updates. \"Customers of Louisiana’s insurer of last resort, Citizens, may soon get a small break in their property insurance premiums, if lawmakers agree to legislation that would suspend the 10% surcharge for customers in the coastal part of the state. Republican leaders earlier in the session dismissed the idea of providing a break on Citizens premiums. But they agreed Tuesday to amendments on a bill by Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, to suspend the higher premiums for Citizens customers entirely in a dozen coastal parishes. Most of Citizens' policies are concentrated in the coastal zone. Customers in the rest of the state would pay 5% over the private market, down from 10% in current law.\" \"The bill would also limit the amount of damages people can get when they sue Citizens. Talbot hoped to ban all bad-faith penalties for Citizens, but agreed to a compromise that limits the damages to the policy limit.\" The limitation of bad faith penalties for Louisiana Citizens is a step in the right direction. Hopefully, this progress can be expanded upon.\n\nBad Faith: The violation of Florida Statutes governing the timely and proper adjustment practices of insurance claims. Typically, bad faith can include unwarranted delay or denial of insurance benefits, unfair or deceptive practices, and misrepresentations of fact. Depending on the magnitude of the bad faith, Florida Statutes allow for the recovery of extra-contractual damages (damages beyond the terms of the insurance policy) and/or punitive damages. At Cassel & Cassel, we strive to make the claim process as pain-free and easy to understand as possible. Below is a glossary of terms commonly used throughout property insurance policies and claim correspondences. Please note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, and these terms are defined generally as individual policies may contain alternative definitions. If you have any questions regarding the definitions below or their application to your claim/policy, do not hesitate to contact one of our attorneys for a free consultation. https://lnkd.in/d6zSc3U\n\nBad Faith: The violation of Florida Statutes governing the timely and proper adjustment practices of insurance claims.

Whether Insurance Claim is payable when there is a case of double insurance; 2. Whether Insurance Claim is payable when the stock insured does not belong to the Insured; 3. Whether the insurance company can deny payment of claim on the basis of “Goods held in Trust” are not covered under the policy; The Cold Storage/Complainant before the NCDRC as well as before the SC was represented by Senior Advocate Arvind Nayar along-with other advocates. Attaching the Judgment passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the Hon'ble NCDRC for the benefit of readers.\n\n❓ ❓ What has happened since the Insurance reform bill was approved by the Governor? ❓ ❓ 1. The media and industry celebrated a massive victory! 2. Positive comments from industry & political leaders. 3. National companies decided to leave Florida. 4. National companies have removed themselves from comparative rating tools to write fewer Florida policies. 5. Property companies decided to keep many zip codes closed. 6. Property companies decided to keep strict roof age underwriting guidelines. 7. Property companies rolled out additional strict pre-bind requirements. 8. Insurance companies have decreased the commissions paid to agents. 9. Insurance companies have cut new business binding authority for many agencies. 10. Non-renewal volume continues to grow. 11. Premiums continue to skyrocket. ✳ These companies stuck with us the past three years of chaos, but decided enough is enough AFTER an amazing reform bill was passed??? ✳ https://lnkd.in/ekckx4-5\n\nIf you have \"umbrella\" insurance (personal or commercial), ask yourself this: What point would there be to having an umbrella limit (amount of insurance) if it was restricted by the limit on an underlying policy? The Texas Supreme Court recently clarified this matter in a way that may have precedent for other states. #liabilityinsurance #umbrellainsurance #constructioninsurance https://lnkd.in/gB63rC2x"
