        "text": "A longtime resident of Newton, age 101, on December 29, 2017. Beloved wife of the late Joseph Karlin, former Newton City Clerk and Alderman. Cherished aunt of Richard Trehub (Judith), Susan Trehub Waldman (David), Ann Trehub, and Carol Trehub Shapiro (Daniel). Loving great-aunt of Kenneth Trehub (Jill), Eric Trehub, Lisa Waldman Friedman (Ari), and Karyn Waldman Samuel (Rowen). Dear great-great-aunt of Kyle, Scott, Matthew, Noah, Eli, Jacob, and Alex. Sister of the late George Trehub, Irving Trehub, and Frances Trehub, and sister-in-law of Etta Trehub, Bertha Trehub, and the late Harriet “Hattie” Trehub. She is also survived by numerous other dear family members and friends. Emma was a former member of Temple Emanuel in Newton and a former employee of the Newton Chamber of Commerce. She will be lovingly remembered as the matriarch of her family who graciously hosted many holidays and gatherings. The family all turned to her for guidance and advice and she always stayed current so she could interact with every generation of her family. Even while living at Lasell Village, Emma was the “go-to” person for driving her friends most of the time until age 96. Special thanks to her many dedicated caregivers who were so wonderful to her in her later years. Her memory will be eternal. Services at the Sharon Memorial Park Chapel, 40 Dedham St., Sharon, Wednesday, January 3, 2018 at 12:00 noon. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory may be made to Combined Jewish Philanthropies, 126 High St., Boston, MA 02110 or Temple Emanuel, 365 Ward St., Newton, MA 02459."
