        "text": "This article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at FSU chapter.\n\nThroughout my time at Her Campus at Florida State Univeristy (FSU), I have been highlighting various minority students and alumni in the FSU community. In light of the violence against the Asian community, I wanted to speak to a friend of mine who has a unique perspective on the subject.\n\nHer Campus (HC): Hi Karlin, I’m so excited to talk to you today! Can you tell us a little about yourself?\n\nKarlin Chung (KC): Hello! My name is Karlin Chung. I am a junior at Florida State University, majoring in marketing and HR management. I was born and raised in New York City and moved to Orlando a few years ago. Some of my campus involvements include being a Resident Assistant for University Housing, a Learning Assistant for College Algebra, a member of the National Residence Hall Honorary and Lady Spirithunters! Fun fact about me is that I’m half Chinese and half Dominican!\n\nHC: What has it been like being both Asian and Hispanic? How have you dealt with the difficulties of identifying with two different cultures that face their own set of challenges?\n\nKC: Being both Asian and Hispanic has its ups and downs. I love it because I get to live an amazing life that includes two completely different cultures. My favorite part about being both Hispanic and Asian is that I get to see my parents embrace others’ cultures as well. For example, my dad is an older, Chinese man who loves eating rice and beans and blasts merengue every road trip we go on. However, it can also be internally challenging; I don’t always feel like I fit in or feel fully accepted on either side or by others. When I was around other Hispanics, they always called me “La Chinita,” which basically means the Chinese Girl. They would tell my mom that I “look so Asian” and talk about me in Spanish, which would be funny because I understand everything they were saying, but they didn’t know that. My dad would always get asked, “Who is that girl?” in Chinese supermarkets or restaurants and he would have to explain that I’m his daughter and that I’m half Hispanic. They would just be amazed because they’ve never really seen anyone like me. When I moved to Florida, things changed. The area I lived in and the people I was around were completely different and it was harder to stay connected to my roots. However, since then, I’ve learned that the culture is within myself and I have to make sure that I don’t stop embracing my cultures at home.\n\nHC: With the pandemic, there has been a surge in violence against Asian Americans. What are your thoughts/feelings about that, and how has your reality changed due to this violence?\n\nKC: The surge in violence against Asian Americans definitely made me angry and scared. I’m not too scared for me, but instead for my father because he is an older, Chinese man, which shockingly fits the description of many of the attacks that have been occurring. For example, the attack and murder of Vichar Ratanapakdee and the 91-year-old Chinese man in Oakland hit home the most because that can potentially be my dad. After the Black Lives Matter protests that occurred during [the] summer [of] 2020, I was an ally; however, [I] honestly didn’t know what it must’ve felt like to be afraid for your life. Now that the violence rates towards Asian Americans have risen, I am able to understand better why this is such an important issue and the power behind those who work together to stop hate because it can happen to anyone.\n\nHC: As an Asian student at FSU, do you feel safe and supported on-campus and in the Tallahassee community?\n\nKC: As an Asian American at FSU, I do feel safe and supported here. The Asian American Student Union is an amazing organization to have here because that is where I’ve found lots of people who I can relate to, feel supported by and even build a connection to my culture here in Tallahassee. Even with my friends/mentors who aren’t necessarily Asian, I know I still have the support I need. In the Tallahassee community, I think it can be better. I just recently found one restaurant that serves some traditional dishes that remind me of home (shout out Blossom Kitchen).\n\nHC: Is there any message you want to leave the reader with?\n\nKC: To conclude, I just want to say that we should all be there to support those in need, especially in times of need. Research online, donate to organizations, support small businesses, follow pages and get information out on your social media to help inform yourself and others about issues that are happening. We can stop hate if we work together to spread the love!"
