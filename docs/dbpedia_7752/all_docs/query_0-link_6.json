        "text": "A bipartisan war on migrants has been at the center of national politics. This was apparent at the recent presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, who has built his political career on a pillar of anti-migrant rhetoric, used the debate to claim over and over again that Biden has maintained a policy of “open borders,” a line that the Far Right continues to put forward even as the Biden administration maintains most of Trump’s worst anti-migrant policies. In fact, in many ways Biden has gone further than Trump on opposing immigration, committing even more funding to federal border enforcement agencies than the former president did, and making drastic moves like executively closing much of the U.S.-Mexico border in June. This is all in line with a bipartisan trajectory of curbs on immigration and increasingly violent border policies, which has spanned Democrat and Republican administrations from Clinton to Bush to Obama to Trump to Biden.\n\nIn the debate, Trump claimed that the border was far more secure during his presidency, and that the Biden administration’s policies have resulted in “terrorists” coming to the United States from all over the world, running rampant, and killing people. Biden’s response was pathetic, and not just because he looked like he could drop dead at any second. The president showed in the debate what he has shown during his entire campaign: his platform on immigration is proudly to the right. Of course, Biden pointed out that Trump was lying about migrants flowing across the border and committing murders, but none of what he said was in defense of immigrants. Rather, Biden has been putting himself forward as the candidate who takes border security seriously. His position in the debate was a consolidation of a rightwing position he has developed over the past four years, which abandons lip service and tepid reforms for immigrants in favor of a hardline denial of the right to migrate and commitment to oppose that right with force.\n\nIf anyone went into this debate thinking that Biden has any interest in protecting immigrants, the two candidates fighting over which of them has actually been endorsed by the Border Patrol should make clear that both parties want to represent the war on migrants. As Left Voice has covered extensively, after running as a “pro-immigrant” candidate in 2020, Biden proceeded to shift to the right, overseeing a record number of deaths at the U.S.-Mexico border and building Trump’s infamous border wall, along with administering plenty of other anti-migrant atrocities.\n\nIt’s Not Just The Candidates — It’s Capitalism\n\nThis bipartisan rightward shift is reflected in the two presidential candidates, but it cannot be blamed on just them as individuals. Capitalists are increasingly looking to nationalist solutions as a way to overcome economic and political crises that neoliberalism has been unable to resolve. In the United States, this means an “America first” economic policy put forward by both Biden and Trump. It also means that Latin America, which has a massive working class and natural resources for emerging technologies, becomes central to U.S. competition with China. The U.S. building up its repressive forces through a war on migrants allows the country to strongarm neighboring countries in Latin America to act in service of U.S. imperialist interests. This is relevant as both Republicans and Democrats pursue nearshoring, a policy in which multinational companies that have used China’s cheap, easily exploitable workers, shift to countries in Latin America for cheap, precarious labor, such as the workers in maquiladoras in Mexico.\n\nThe war on migrants also helps divide U.S.-born workers and migrant workers as a way to weaken the international working class. This division was shown at the debate when Trump sought to appeal to oppressed workers that are native to the United States by claiming that immigrants are taking “Black and Hispanic jobs.” This division of the working class keeps us from using our collective power by pitting us against one another based on nationality. Meanwhile, the threat of deportation creates unique conditions of precarity for undocumented workers, forcing them to accept jobs in more grueling, unregulated, dangerous industries in the United States, such as agriculture and construction.\n\nIn short, capitalism relies on dividing workers along national lines and citizenship status to save money by hyper-exploiting some sectors of our class, while using appeals to nationalism to keep all of us from fighting for our shared interests against the economic insecurity that capitalists have created. This division is escalating as U.S. imperialism increasingly benefits from a more extreme war on migrants to re-establish its geopolitical and economic dominance in competition with China. It should then be no surprise that the Democrats and Republicans, both political parties that exist to represent capitalists, are increasingly shifting to the right on immigration.\n\nWe Need a Party that Fights For Immigrant Rights\n\nDespite Biden’s clear rightward lurch in service of an increasingly anti-migrant capitalist class, the president has made some minor concessions to the more progressive sectors of the Democratic Party, and immigrant rights groups that organize within the party. Most notable was his recent expansion of protections for undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens and “Dreamers,” the latter referring to children who were brought into the United States without documentation.\n\nThese minor concessions are due to the strength of immigrant rights activists, many of whom became committed to fighting back against the war on migrants during the Trump years. While immigrant rights activism is no longer as massive of a force as it was under Trump’s presidency — in large part due to the role of Democrats funneling activism off the streets and into the polls and the courts — the strategic power of migrant workers in key industries along with a dedicated vanguard of immigrant rights activists remains a force to be reckoned with. While Biden clearly isn’t interested in representing immigrant rights, the Democratic Party’s coalition is so fractured that Biden is attempting to maintain every last vote he can get in order to win the election. This explains any concessions he offers on the campaign trail.\n\nIt is a mistake, however, for those of us fighting for immigrant rights to tie our fight to the Democratic Party. As explained above, the Democratic Party is increasingly obligated to shift right on immigration, not just because of Biden, but because the capitalist class that the Democrats represent increasingly see a war on migrants as a priority. Immigrant rights activists tying themselves to the Democratic Party has only led to a weakening of our activism. A movement that once flooded airports in response to Trump’s Muslim travel ban has failed to mobilize similarly under attack after attack on immigrants under Biden’s presidency. This is yet another example of how the Democrats act as the graveyard of social movements.\n\nNow, more than ever, we need to fight back against both the Far Right and the Democrats who enable and make concessions to the nationalism, racism, and authoritarianism of the Right. This means fighting the whole capitalist system that props itself up on xenophobia and division of workers.\n\nWhile a sector of the U.S. working class is buying into the scapegoating of immigrants that the Right puts forward, many workers in the United States, migrant and native, don’t see themselves represented in either capitalist party and could be won to a socialist program that responds to the misery of the working class with revolutionary proposals for a system that unites workers and advances our interests. We need a party that wages this fight for a socialist system in favor of all workers — all who have been politically activated against the war on immigrants, the anti-imperialist student movement which has emerged in the United States against genocide in Gaza, and all who are disgusted at the monster that is the bipartisan U.S. regime.\n\nA working class party with a socialist program, completely independent of all capitalists, can be a force that mobilizes migrant workers and their allies in the streets nationally against repressive, racist policies being developed by the Republicans and Democrats. This party can organize all workers — both undocumented and those with citizenship — to withhold their labor to demand better economic conditions and programs to provide housing and jobs for all workers. The capitalists who pit us against one another actually have plenty of resources to go around, but it will take a fight to not just defend against attacks on immigrants and all workers but win concessions. Of course, any concessions we win should not stop us from fighting even further for a whole new system which unites our class around the world, opens all borders, abolishes all repressive forces, and puts the world’s resources towards meeting all workers’ needs."
