        "text": "Lately, public scrutiny has shined a bright spotlight on Entergy New Orleans’ $1 billion Operation Gridiron. The New Orleans City Council has been rightfully cautious, given the fees that would hit residents and the recent evidence of company deceit in pitching their plans to the council.\n\nOperation Gridiron is highly visible, taking center stage. But behind the scenes,Entergy is pushing multiple other measures out of public view that could affect residents just as much — if not more.\n\n​​\n\nOn December 19, 2022 Entergy filed an application at the Louisiana Public Service Commission requesting $4.6B for upgrades to the transmission and distribution system it claims will reduce future hurricane recovery costs and shorten outage durations following storms. This request is for Phase I of Entergy’s two part $10B total resilience investment plan.\n\n​Entergy’s plan uses a complex simulation model to predict damage following a hurricane but has never checked any of its predictions against a single actual hurricane to validate the complex analysis it relies on, raising questions about the accuracy of their analysis. ​\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Entergy New Orleans (ENO) filed an application with the New Orleans City Council (the Council) for an increase in both electric and gas rates. ENO’s application would see monthly bills for ratepayers who use 1000 kWh per month rise by $3.79 on the electric side and $5.85 on the gas side.\n\n​In response to ENO’s application, the Council’s utility advisors have recommended that the Council lower electric bills for the average user by about $0.24 per month, while recommending that gas bills increase by about $4.93 per month.\n\nEntergy New Orleans (ENO) customers with grievances can submit a formal complaint to the New Orleans City Council using the utility complaint form recently added to their website.\n\nAs a ratepayer you have the right to “safe and reliable service in accordance with industry standards,” guaranteed to you by the utility Ratepayer Bill of Rights. ​The Alliance for Affordable Energy and Citizens for Change worked with the New Orleans City Council and ENO to develop this Ratepayer Bill of Rights, and in 2007 the Council codified it into law.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has released a decision siding with the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) in its dispute against System Energy Resources, Inc. (SERI), a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation (Entergy).\n\nFERC's decision reaffirms regulatory and advocate concerns that Entergy has systematically overcharged ratepayers across the states of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana for over two decades for costs related to its ownership, and mismanagement, of the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Port Gibson, Mississippi.​\n\nWith Louisiana residents receiving unprecedentedly high electricity bills, Democrats on the Louisiana Public Service Commission last week blamed Entergy Louisiana for the “mess,” saying the utility giant ignored calls to diversify its sources of fuel for power generation.\n\n​While some commissioners blamed Entergy for the problem, one advocate said the commission also bears responsibility. Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said the commission never really pushed hard for renewables. The energy industry knew years ago that renewables were going to become the cheapest sources of power, yet the commission over the course of four years approved four new natural gas power plants in Louisiana, Burke said.​\n\nAmid wide-ranging allegations that it soaked ratepayers for inflated costs at its troubled Grand Gulf nuclear power plant, which serves customers in three states, Entergy has struck a settlement with Mississippi, agreeing to refund the state $300 million.\n\n​\n\nBut it’s not yet clear if regulators in Louisiana will opt into the deal, and some officials are skeptical.\n\nThe Alliance's take: This plant has been a problem from the jump. Louisianans are owed far more than this pittance and we’re glad to see regulators in the state indicate the same sentiment."
