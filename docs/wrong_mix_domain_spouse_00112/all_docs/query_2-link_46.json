        "text": "January 2024\n\nPut A Ring On It: A New Mechanism of Bacterial Immunity to Viruses\n\nCRISPR-Cas systems are being used extensively in genetic engineering in a wide range of cellular contexts and, most recently, as a new means to treat human genetic diseases. However, these systems originated as an adaptive immune system in bacteria that protects them against viral invaders. Most CRISPR systems mediate this immunity by using RNA to interfere with viral nucleic acids. One of the most widely found systems, type III CRISPR, is not an exception, however, it possesses an additional signaling cascade that enhances its immunity mechanism. Uniquely, the type III CRISPR effector Cas10 cleaves single-stranded DNA and also produces cyclic oligoadenylate molecules from ATP. These cyclic adenylates act as second messengers to activate additional effectors. These effectors have a CARF domain that binds the cyclic oligoadenyalate ligand and are fused to domains that provide additional immunity. Recently, TPCB student Christian Baca and colleagues identified a novel type III CRISPR accessory protein named Cam1, in which the CARF domain is fused to a transmembrane helix not found in other CARF effectors. In a collaborative effort between the labs of TPCB faculty members Prof. Luciano Marraffini at Rockefeller and Prof. Dinshaw Patel at MSK, Cam1 was shown to provide immunity to bacteria against viruses by arresting the infected host cell, making it inhospitable for viral replication, and thus preventing the spread of the virus to neighboring bacteria within the population. Cam1 is a tetrameric protein that forms a pore in the bacterial cell membrane. Upon activation by binding of cyclic tetraadenylate, a Cam1 pore causes depolarization across the bacterial membrane. These findings were published recently in Nature, and are a part of growing body of work showing that CRISPR-Cas systems do not always mediate interference through destruction of nucleic acids and can provide immunity through diverse mechanisms.

The program featured a keynote presentation by Jesse H. Ausubel, Director of the Program for the Human Environment at Rockefeller and an alumni panel discussion with Prof. Vidhya Rangaraju (Group Leader, Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience; TPCB ‘13, Ryan Lab) and Dr. Christopher Stratton (Senior Scientist, Janssen Research and Development; TPCB ‘12, Tan Lab).\n\nStudents engaged in some friendly competition in our annual 3-Minute Thesis Talk event, around the go-kart track, and on the volleyball court, and also enjoyed paddleboarding and kayaking around the lake, and exercising their creativity in a painting class. The event was organized by rising 3rd-year students Jared Ramsey, Nicolai Tornow, and Nora Zhou and received generous financial support from the TPCB NIH T32 Chemistry–Biology Interface Training Grant.\n\nJuly 2023\n\nChBSP Summer Program Welcomes 2023 Chemical Biology Interns\n\nTPCB welcomes this year’s summer undergraduate interns in the Chemical Biology Summer Program (ChBSP)! Now in its sixth year, the program provides students with unique experience in chemical biology research in TPCB labs. Students also participate in faculty seminars, professional development seminars, and a journal club hosted by current TPCB graduate students. Alumni of the program have continued onto PhD training in a wide range of prestigious graduate programs, including TPCB itself! The program will culimate in a poster session on August 9, 2023 hosted at MSK. The program is directed by TPCB faculty member Prof. Daniel Bachovchin and Dr. Ushma Neill, who leads the MSK Office of Scientific Education & Training. Generous financial support is provided by the Sanders Innovation & Education Initiative of the Tri-Institutional Therapeutics Discovery Institute.

To recognize these important contributions, the program recently established the TPCB Student Service Award, to be awarded annually to a student who has undertaken exceptional service to the scientific community. Recently, Gianna Stella was named the inaugural recipient of the award for 2023. Gianna co-chairs the Tri-Institutional Outreach Committee and co-founded the Tri-Institutional Mentorship Initiative (TIMI) in 2020. TIMI provides mentorship to undergraduate and postgraduate students who are applying to PhD programs in the biomedical sciences, with a particular focus on students from underserved backgrounds. In three short years, this grassroots program has grown to 79 mentor–mentee pairs and has recruited graduate student mentors from every PhD program across the three institutions. TIMI has had a remarkable impact, reaching mentees from across the U.S. and 13 countries around the world this year, with 96% of the U.S. students receiving at least one admission offer.\n\nIn addition to her work on TIMI, Gianna was recognized by her peers for her steadfast commitment to representing graduate student interests and concerns to institutional leadership. In her roles as an elected student representative at both Weill Cornell and Rockefeller, she has advocated successfully for increased mental health support services and new diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Gianna is currently a graduate student working with Prof. Luciano Marraffini at Rockefeller investigating the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-based immunity in bacteria. Prof. Marraffini commented, “Gianna has demonstrated exemplary leadership skills and a devotion to improving the lives of people, not only within the university, but also the community at large. Her dedication to teaching and improving scientific literacy in the community is awe-inspiring.” Nominations and supporting letters were solicited in March and April of this year and reviewed by a committee of TPCB students and faculty, chaired by Prof. Daniel Heller of MSK.

Academy membership is one of the highest honors in science. Prof. Boudker is recognized for her seminal work in understanding the molecular mechanisms of glutamate transporters in neurons. These cellular machines help transmit signals through nerves by pumping glutamate, a small-molecule neurotransmitter, from cell–cell synapses into brain cells. In this way, they terminate signaling between neurons, help recycle the transmitter, and allow multiple rounds of signaling. This neurotransmission in the brain is the basis for learning, memory, and cognition. Prof. Boudker’s lab at Weill Cornell has hosted numerous TPCB graduate students, and she serves on the TPCB Admissions Committee. She is also an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, as well as acting Chair of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine. Prof. Boudker joins 9 other current TPCB faculty members who have been recognized with this high honor.

To compact this genetic material into the cell nucleus, a group of five proteins called histones collaborate to organize the DNA into a condensed yet readable format. Histone H1, also known as linker histone, has for many years been known to act in concert with the other four histone proteins to compact double-stranded genomic DNA. Together, these histone proteins pack away the vast majority of the genome that eventually form chromosomes as we know them. However, in a new report in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology, a collaborative TPCB team has discovered an unexpected and independent function for linker histone H1. The work was led by TPCB students Dr. Rachel Leicher, Dr. Adewola Osunsade, and Gabriella Chua, and postdoctoral fellow Dr. Sarah Faulkner, along with other colleagues including TPCB student Sophia Christodolou-Rubalcava in the labs of Prof. Yael David (MSK) and Prof. Shixin Liu (Rockefeller). Using a combination of protein chemistry and single-molecule biophysical techniques, the team demonstrated that linker histone H1 preferentially interacts with single-stranded DNA to promote phase separation, a process linked to the formation of many types of membraneless sub-compartments in the cell. In particular, they found that this phase separation occurs at single-stranded DNA in replication forks, structures that are formed when the genome is being copied. Replication forks become vulnerable if the DNA is damaged, leading to genome instability. Thus, this work suggests that H1 plays a role beyond simply compacting DNA and, by compartmentalizing the genome, may help maintain its stability when the cell is under stress. [Read more at: Nat.

CAR-T cells are produced from patient’s own T cells, which are engineered to express a non-natural receptor that recognizes a tumor antigen and activates an antitumor immune response. However, despite this breakthrough, CAR-T cell therapies face several limitations, including immunosupression in the tumor microenvironment, limited penetration of solid tumors, and eventual relapse resulting from antigen-negative tumor cells. In a recent publication in Nature Chemical Biology, TPCB student J. Peter Lee, postdoctoral fellow Dr. Thomas Gardner, Prof. Derek Tan, Prof. David Scheinberg, and their coworkers at MSK have created a new class of CAR-T cells that have the added capability to generate small-molecule anticancer drugs in situ, which may synergize with the antitumor activity of the cells themselves, potentially overcoming several of the limitations of conventional CAR-T cells. These novel SEAKER (Synthetic Enzyme-Armed KillER) cells proliferate at tumors and express an activating enzyme that converts a non-toxic prodrug, which is administered systemically, to the active parent drug locally at the tumor site. The team demonstrated the effectiveness of this modular platform across several different enzyme–prodrug combinations, both in cell culture and in mouse tumor models. This work sets the stage for further investigations of this new therapeutic strategy for cancer and potentially other diseases. [Read more at: MSK News | Nat. Chem. Bio. | Nat. Rev.

The molecular mechanisms of ribosomal protein synthesis have been studied for decades, but numerous question remain regarding how this complex process is orchestrated and driven energetically. Now, TPCB student Emily Rundlet and Prof. Scott Blanchard, formerly of Weill Cornell and currently on the faculty at St. Jude Children’s Hospital, and coworkers have used single-molecule fluorescence imaging and cryoelectron microscopy to provide important new insights into this process. Their work, which was published recently in Nature, focuses on translocation, whereby the ribosome orchestrates the movement of aminoacyl-tRNA building blocks and mRNA templates through its active site to synthesize a specific protein sequence according to the genetic code. They first used single-molecule FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) experiments to identify conditions and small-molecule antibiotics that could trap the ribosome in intermediate states for structural characterization. This led to the surprising discovery that EF-G (elongation factor G), a GTP-dependent enzyme that drives translocation, engages the ribosome complex at an early stage in translocation with its GTP intact. This indicated that the chemical energy released by GTP hydrolysis is not used until later in the translocation process. The lab’s ongoing efforts are now focused on elucidating the molecular details of those downstream steps. These studies provide a deeper understanding of this fundamental cellular process and may shed light on ribosome dysfunction in disease states, as well as set the stage for the development of new antibiotics that disrupt ribosome function.

[Read more at: AAAS]\n\nOctober 2020\n\nMay the Force Be with You: How Cells Use Actin to Detect Mechanical Signals\n\nCells respond to a wide range of chemical signals in their environment, using receptors that transmit signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, thus controlling cellular processes such as proliferation and death. In a new study published in the journal eLife, TPCB student Lin Mei and Prof. Gregory Alushin at Rockefeller, show how cells also detect mechanical signals from their environment using the multifunctional cytoskeletal protein actin, which forms filaments within cells. The team hypothesized that external mechanical tension might be transmitted through the cell by the actin filaments. Using single-molecule techniques, they demonstrated that a cell–cell adhesion protein, α-catenin, bound more tightly to actin filaments that were under mechanical tension. In contrast, another homologous adhesion protein, vinculin, did not respond to force on actin. Structural studies using cryoelectron microscopy pointed to a C-terminal tail found only in α-catenin as a potential source of this functional difference, and this was confirmed using a truncated mutant that showed no increase in binding in response to actin tension. This work sets the stage for further studies of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of mechanotransduction by cytoskeletal proteins and may one day open the door to the development of new therapeutics to treat diseases associated with defects in this signaling, including muscular dystrophies, cardiomyopathies, and metastatic cancer. TPCB student Rachel Leicher and Prof. Shixin Liu, both at Rockefeller, also contributed to the work.

Penn.), Victoria Rasmussen (Providence College), Bria VarnBuhler (Pomona College), and Tiffany Zhang (Caltech). While their arrival on campus was delayed by one month due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the students were able to begin their studies on time in early July through specially organized remote programming, completed from their homes across the country. The summer curriculum included weekly Meet the Faculty Seminars presented by TPCB faculty members, journal clubs with students from the Tri-Institutional Chemical Biology Summer Program and with senior TPCB students, and regular research group meetings with their rotation labs. The students also attended a weekly live seminar series sponsored by the MSK Chemical Biology Program, which included student meetings with and presentations by Prof. Heeseon An (MSK incoming faculty), Prof. Paramjit Arora (NYU), Prof. Elizabeth Boon (Stony Brook University), Prof. Ruben Gonzalez (Columbia University), Prof. Mandë Holford (Hunter College), Dr. Luke Lavis (HHMI Janelia Research Campus), Prof. Dirk Trauner (NYU), and Prof. Eranthie Weerapana (Boston College).\n\nThe new class also completed the Tri-Institutional Responsible Conduct of Research Course and participated in a pilot session of a new discussion focusing on Racism, Discrimination, and Bias in Science along with first-year students from the the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine Program. The discussion was led by TPCB Director Prof. Derek Tan, CBM Director Prof. Christina Leslie, Dr. Yaihara Fortis-Santiago (MSK Associate Director of Postdoctoral Affairs and Trainee Diversity Initiatives), and Dr. Avelino Amado (Weill Cornell Diversity Program Manager), with support from Dr. Maika Mitchell (MSK Associate Director of Research Outreach & Compliance), and will serve as the basis for further integration of these important topics into the main Tri-Institutional RCR Course this fall.\n\nThe three institutions provide extensive resources and support to students, which were introduced in a series of virtual orientation events. Information on the Offices of Career and Professional Development was provided by Dr. Thalyana Stathis (MSK), Dr. Andrea Morris (Rockefeller), and Dr. Aubrey Leukart (Weill Cornell). Important resources for Student Mental Health & Wellness were shared by Dr. Judith Cukor (Weill Cornell), Dr. Nisha Mehta-Naik (Rockefeller), and Dr. Chanchal Sharma (MSK). Further, an overview of Diversity, Inclusion, & Outreach Programs was provided by Dr. Marcus Lambert (Weill Cornell), Dr. Yaihara Fortis-Santiago (MSK), and Dr. Jeanne Garbarino (Rockefeller).\n\nThe new students were also welcomed to the program through a series of virtual social events organized by the TPCB Orientation Committee of Gabriella Chua, David Hsieh, Gianna Stella, Kristen Vogt, and Lauren Vostal. In addition, TPCB students Chloe Burnside and Chen Chen hosted a new series of biweekly TPCB Ask A Student panels to discuss life in NYC, choosing rotations, impostor syndrome, and choosing a thesis lab. Through the combined efforts of numerous staff, students, and leadership across the three campuses, the first-year students were able to arrive on campus in early August. The students are now embarking on their first laboratory rotations, while benefitting from the academic head start provided by the summer remote curriculum.\n\nChBSP Students Complete Virtual Summer Internships\n\nThe Tri-Institutional Chemical Biology Summer Program (ChBSP) hosted its third class of outstanding undergraduate students this summer. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the internships were all carried out remotely. However, the students were still immersed virtually in TPCB research labs and participated in a wide variety of scientific and career development training activities. The students also joined the TPCB first-year students in a semiweekly journal club led by TPCB students Emma Garst and Natalie Jones, and attended a weekly chemical biology seminar series hosted by the MSK Chemical Biology Program. The ChBSP students presented their work alongside other summer interns in MSK programs at an online poster session on July 31, 2020, showcasing their exposure to forefront research in chemical biology.\n\nJoann Chongsaritsinsuk\n\nUniversity of Richmond, Class of 2021\n\nStructural Basis for Catch Bonding between Mdn1 and Rsa4\n\nwith Prof. Tarun Kapoor, Rockefeller\n\nSamuel Croes\n\nBrown University, Class of 2021\n\nKinome Structure – A Computational Method to Determine Kinase Substrate Specificity\n\nwith Prof. Lewis Cantley, Weill Cornell\n\nBenjamin Freeman\n\nPrinceton University, Class of 2021\n\nHuman Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC) for Replacement Therapy and Drug Discovery\n\nwith Prof. Shuibing Chen, Weill Cornell\n\nAnna Soltys\n\nPrinceton University, Class of 2021\n\nUsing Bis-electrophiles to Capture Ub Tetrahedral Intermediates\n\nwith Prof. Derek Tan, MSK\n\nCharles Warren\n\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Class of 2021\n\nExploring NACHT-LRR Binding Proteins’ Influence on Inflammasome Biology\n\nwith Prof. Daniel Bachovchin, MSK\n\nChBSP receives generous financial support from the Sanders Innovation and Education Initiative of the Tri-Institutional Therapeutics Discovery Institute, which is led by Dr. Peter Meinke.

[Read more]\n\nJune 2020\n\nTPCB Students Continue their Training during the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has profoundly impacted everyone’s lives, and TPCB’s graduate students are no exception. The program moved quickly in early March to keep students informed of rapidly evolving policies on the three Tri-Institutional campuses to protect the health and safety of all staff. The three institutions voluntarily paused non-essential laboratory research activities in mid-March, and TPCB transitioned to online enrichment programming to keep students intellectually engaged and socially connected. The members of the TPCB Online Programming Task Force, Nathan Harper, Ilana Kotliar, Elizabeth Orth, Mizuho Horioka, and Linamarie Miller, worked closely with Prof. Derek Tan, TPCB Director and Margie Hinonangan-Mendoza, TPCB Graduate Program Administrator, to organize these activities.\n\nOver the ensuing months, TPCB students and faculty adapted to these new conditions, working out of their homes, in NYC and abroad, to continue advancing their training and research outside of the laboratory. Classes continued online, with our first-year students completing the TPCB Chemistry in Biology & Medicine course via Zoom meetings. With in-person seminar visits canceled, an online seminar series was established, and TPCB students and faculty came together virtually each week to learn about the latest advances in chemical biology. TPCB students also organized a “Quarantine Journal Club” to discuss recent scientific breakthroughs with their peers. Online lunch meetings and game nights also provided some fun and relaxation for the students. In addition, individual labs organized online group meetings, journal clubs, literature presentations, brainstorming sessions, and social gatherings.\n\nOur second-year students worked toward completing their PhD candidacy exams with their thesis committees while our senior students continued to present their work at our weekly Research in Progress Seminar Series. We also welcomed two new TPCB faculty members, Prof. Viviana Risca and Prof. Ekaterina Vinogradova, both of Rockefeller, who presented live seminars on their exciting research programs. The entire TPCB community also came together for four online thesis defenses by Dr. Chaya Stern (Chodera Lab, MSK), Dr. Ashley Chui (Bachovchin Lab, MSK), Dr. Darren Johnson (Bachovchin Lab, MSK), and Dr. Fangyu Liu (Chen Lab, RU), who were surrounded virtually by colleagues, friends, and family.\n\nTPCB also worked to promote mental health awareness throughout the pause, keeping students informed of support resources available within the three institutions and via the NIH Office of Intramural Education and Training. On April 8, Dr. Judith Cukor, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs at Weill Cornell and a clinical psychologist, gave an insightful presentation on “Coping with Changing Routines and Uncertain Times”, sharing helpful strategies for adjusting to working from home. TPCB students also had access to a variety of free, online wellness activities provided by the institutions, including meditation, yoga, and Zumba classes.\n\nAs the situation in NYC continued to improve steadily in May and June, laboratories on all three campuses began gradual, staged reopenings, bringing both students and faculty back to the bench to continue their research. Prof. Tan commented, “While the last three months have been incredibly difficult for everyone, I have never been more proud to be part of the TPCB community, and to witness the exceptional resilience and commitment of our students in particular.”\n\nSahana Rao, Daniel Heller, and Alex Kentsis Recognized at Convocation Ceremonies\n\nTPCB student Sahana Rao and faculty members Prof. Daniel Heller and Prof. Alex Kentsis were recognized with prestigious awards at this year’s academic convocation ceremonies. The events were held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSahana Rao was honored with the inaugural Marie-Josée Kravis Women in Science Endeavor Graduate Fellowship. The fellowship was recently establshed as part of a broader effort at MSK to recognize the vital importance of recruiting at supporting top female scientists, with the goal of closing the gender gap in research and career opportunities. Sahana’s research focuses on understanding the molecular basis for activation of inflammasomes, innate immune sensors that detect pathogens and endogenous danger signals. Previous work showed that Val-boroPro, a small-molecule inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 8/9 (DPP8/9), induces powerful antitumor responses in syngeneic cancer models by activating the NLRP1 inflammasome in myeloid cells. However, the molecular mechanism of this process remained unclear. Sahana’s thesis research has revealed that, in mice, NLRP1 is activated by autoproteolytic cleavage into two parts, with degradation of one fragment leading to activation of the other. Her current efforts seek to understand the endogenous danger signal that is sensed by the inflammasome as a consequence of DPP8/9 inhibition.

The award honors his long-standing commitment to mentoring trainees, including scientists in his own lab and budding biomedical entrepreneurs across the Tri-Institutional campuses. An avid educator, he also co-directs two innovative courses in drug discovery and development, “Drug Development from Molecule to Prescription” and the “Accelerating Bioventure Innovation” entrepreneurship course and training program. Prof. Heller and his laboratory are also active in outreach efforts, including at the Math, Engineering, and Science Academy, a public charter high school in Brooklyn. In fact, Prof. Heller began his career as a 7th and 8th grade science teacher in Houston, Texas. There, he became exposed to chemistry research opportunities at Rice University and the University of Houston, later deciding to pursue his PhD, a postdoc, and ultimately his current faculty position. To date, he has trained over two dozen graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in his lab at MSK. He is known as an open-minded, supportive, and caring mentor who leads by personal example with a positive attitude and infectious enthusiasm. Prof. Heller’s lab develops nanotechnologies to research, diagnose, and treat cancer. His group builds nanoparticles to target drugs to tumors and sensors to detect cancers before they have the chance to spread. They also develop nanoscale tools to interrogate biological processes, such as fluorescent nanosensors that enter the endolysosomal space to detect lipid accumulation within live cells and non-invasively in living organisms. The lab is using these tools to investigate liver diseases and the early-stage genesis of cancers. Prof. Heller is the fourth TPCB faculty member to receive this honor, joining Yueming Li (2018), David Scheinberg (2016), and Derek Tan (2013).

This prestigious award honors junior faculty physicians at MSK who have demonstrated great promise and accomplishment in clinical research. Prof. Kentsis is a pediatric oncologist and cancer biologist. His research takes advantage of modern technologies to improve our understanding of the biologic causes of blood and solid tumors. Together with colleagues, he has made discoveries about new therapeutic targets in cancer cells, mechanisms by which cancer cells can evade new treatments, and improved strategies to overcome treatment resistance. Recently, his lab has identified new mechanisms of aberrant gene control and resistance to apoptosis in leukemias, and mechanisms of site-specific oncogenic mutations and DNA repair dependencies in solid tumors. Combined with improved technologies for proteomics and protein engineering, these studies aim to define precise molecular mechanisms that should lead to rational therapeutic strategies for patients. Prof. Kentsis is the first TPCB faculty member to receive the Boyer Clinical Research Award. Five other faculty members have received the Boyer Basic Science Award previously, Morgan Huse (2017), Xuejun Jiang (2007), Christopher Lima (2006), Stephen Long (2016), and Derek Tan (2010). [Read more at: MSK Convocation]\n\nTPCB Students Present Research at 2020 NYAS Chemical Biology Symposium\n\nThe annual New York Academy of Sciences Chemical Biology Symposium on May 21, 2020 was held online this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The organizers took advantage of this opportunity to expand the reach of the program, showcasing forefront chemical biology research from around the country. TPCB was well represented, with four students presenting posters, two of whom were selected to present short talks by the organizing committee.\n\nThe day kicked off with a keynote presentation by Prof. Anna Marie Pyle of Yale University, who described her lab’s discovery of novel small-molecule RNA binders that target introns and modulate transcript splicing. This work paves the way to potential therapeutic applications of these molecules in infectious disease and genetic disorders. In one of the student talks, Rachel Leicher (pictured), a TPCB graduate student with Prof. Shixin Liu at Rockefeller, presented her single-molecule studies of the histone methyltransferase complex PRC2, and her discovery that it can bridge non-adjacent nucleosomes, adopting different chromatin binding modes.\n\nTPCB student Adewola Osunsade (pictured), from the lab of Prof. Yael David at MSK, also shared her recent work on H1 linker histones, in which she developed the first robust approach to the purification of H1s, enabling the biochemical characterization of their functions in chromatin compaction. The second faculty keynote presentation was given by Dr. Elaine Pinheiro of Merck, who described the development of PT2977, now known as MK-6482, as a first-in class Hif-2α inhibitor that has advanced to Phase II human clinical trials in renal cell carcinoma. The compound is a protein–protein interaction inhibitor that acts by blocking heterodimerization of Hif-2α with Hif-1β, thus preventing transcriptional activation of the hypoxia response element.\n\nThe day culminated in an online poster session, which included presentations by representatives from several TPCB labs. Igor Maksimovic, a TPCB student from the lab of Prof. Yael David at MSK, shared his work on the development of new chemical tools to study histone glycation. TPCB student Jonghan Peter Lee, from the lab of Prof. Derek Tan at MSK, also presented his efforts to develop a novel cell-based therapeutic that generates cytotoxic small-molecule drugs locally at the site of a tumor, a project pursued in collaboration with another TPCB faculty member, Prof. David Scheinberg.
