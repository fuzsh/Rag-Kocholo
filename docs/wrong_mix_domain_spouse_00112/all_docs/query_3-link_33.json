        "text": ":\n\nThere he is, my baby boy. His eyes are closed, his tiny rosebud mouth is pursed in sleep. My eyes well up as I catch a whiff of his newborn skin and I swallow back a wave of emotion. I should feel happy, I should feel grateful, but all I can think about is everything I just lost…\n\nIt’s a miracle when Katherine’s baby boy is born healthy. But his twin sister doesn’t survive, and when Katherine is told she can’t have any more children the loss is almost too much for her to bear.\n\nKatherine always saw herself having a big family: she remembers how the loneliness of being an only child used to overwhelm her, and she is desperate to adopt a sibling for her son.\n\nBut her husband Davis won’t agree. He worries that Katherine will struggle when the new baby arrives. What if growing their family only adds to the grief she feels over losing her little girl? What if this breaks their marriage apart?\n\nAnd Katherine is forced to make a choice. Give up the second child she has always dreamed of or risk losing the family she already has?\n\n:\n\n:\n\nReview\n\nOH MY GOD! It’s not the first time I start a review with this exclamation and it won’t certainly be the last time either. I had to write it in capital letters and in full because the small abbreviation would not cut it. It would not express my feelings about this book.\n\nI opened it and my heart already started breaking. It broke more and more until I found myself with one million pieces of it. But I was lucky. The author added a very good glue to the story so that finally I could put it together again.\n\nThe book made my heart bleed, my eyes well up and my bin fill up with wet tissues, but I ended with my heart full of warmth, my eyes crying happy tears and a big smile on my face.\n\nAn amazingly beautiful story that I could not put down. 5 stars\n\nThank you, Sam Vickery and Bookouture\n\n:\n\nAbout the author\n\nSam Vickery is an English author who loves gritty, emotional stories that can make you sob. As a child, she was forever getting in trouble for being caught with her nose in a book, and these days are no different. She lives on the south coast of England with her husband, two children and a cat that thinks it’s a dog.\n\n/\n\nAuthor Link\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SamVickeryWrites/\n\nWebsite: http://samvickery.com/\n\n:\n\n:\n\nBook Links\n\nAmazon: https://bit.ly/2TkXfLS\n\nApple: https://apple.co/3j6QKrN\n\nKobo: https://bit.ly/38XTS4i"
