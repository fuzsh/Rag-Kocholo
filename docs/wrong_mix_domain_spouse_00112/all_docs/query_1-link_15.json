        "text": "Melissa Riker is Artistic Director and Choreographer of Kinesis Project dance theatre. She is a dancer and choreographer who emerged as a strong creative voice in the NYC performance world. Riker is the Executive Producer of the EstroGenius Festival, Founder and Co-Director of Women in Motion and Founder and Collective Member of Dance Rising. Riker’s dances and aesthetic layer her training in ballet, modern dance, martial arts, theatre and circus. She invents large-scale out-door performances and spontaneous moments of dance for public spaces.\n\nIn 2022 Riker was the Artist in Residence for the Progressive Failure of Brittle Rocks Conference (PRF22) an international conference of Geologists, Geomorphologists and Mechanical Engineers, convened by Dr. Missy Eppes and her colleagues. In 2023, Riker’s work as a dance advocate is through Dance Rising and Dance/NYC as a community organizer and master facilitator of the Dance Industry Census Roundtables.\n\nAudiences and critics have called Riker’s work “a Marx Brothers’ routine with soul,” “A movable feast.” And from The New York Times, her choreography is: “comically acrobatic, gracefully classical, visually arresting.” Her work has been seen and supported nationally, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, Vermont, Florida and in New York City at such venerable venues as Danspace Project, Judson Church, Joyce Soho, The Minskoff Theatre, The Cunningham Studio, West End Theatre and Dixon Place. The company dances outside in sculpture gardens, universities, and annually since 2006 in Battery Park’s Bosque Gardens and The Cloisters Lawn as well as hosting over 30 surprise performances all over New York City and the tri-state area as an element of the company’s earned income and outreach programming with volunteer populated flashmobs. Residencies include: Earthdance 2006, Omi International Arts Center 2008, Kaatsbaan International Dance Center 2011, TheaterLab 2014, Adelphi University 2014. Ms. Riker is a 2016 and 2017 CDI Residency Fellow, 2015 LMCC Community Arts Fund grantee and was commissioned by The Brooklyn Botanic Garden for a surprise large-scale work. Performances of the Company’s work Secrets and Seawalls were seen at Omi International Arts Center, LongHouse Reserve, Gateway National Park in partnership with Rockaways Artist Alliance and The South Street Seaport Museum. Ms. Riker has received commissions from Carson Fox and the Ephemeral Festival in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 for large-scale outdoor events, NYU in 1998, for an outdoor work long before “flashmob” was coined, 2006 and 2008 grants from the Puffin Foundation for her work Community Movements, a dance work with community volunteers, Fellowships from the Dodge Foundation, Space Grant Residencies from 92nd St Y, The New 42nd St Studio, Gibney Dance Center, and The Joyce Theatre Foundation, and grants from The Bowick Family Trust and John C. Robinson to support the continued work of Kinesis Project dance theatre. Kinesis Project’s home studio is part of the Nord Anglia International School NY 5th Floor Artist in Residence program on Second Street in the East Village.\n\nSabrina Canas (dancer/collaborator) (she/her) is a first generation Argentine American artist based in Brooklyn, NY. She completed her BFA in Dance at the University of the Arts (UArts) in May 2019, where she performed works by Jesse Zaritt, Netta Yerushalmy, Helen Simoneau, Marguerite Hemmings, Beth Gill, Sidra Bell and others. In 2020, she presented a collaborative duet at The Craft that uses two female bodies as a conduit through which energetic currents flow to support deterioration, chaos, and regrowth. Sabrina was also featured in jazz musician Tony Glausi's music video, When It All Comes Crashing Down, in February 2021. She recently presented a collaborative duet with Indigo Sparks at Triskelion Arts that was an investigation on the many ways we experience loss. Sabrina is currently working with Kinesis Project in NYC and Hillary Pearson in Philadelphia while continuing to make her own work in Brooklyn.\n\nYolette Yellow-Duke (they/she, dancer/collaborator) has been exploring their love for the arts their entire life. Originally from Brooklyn, NY, they received their MA in Dance Performance with honors from the London Contemporary Dance School, where they wrote a dissertation examining cultural appropriation in dance and disparities between dancers of color and white dancers. While at LCDS, they trained at RESET 2020 with Wayne McGregor company members and at GAGA LAB in Tel Aviv. Yolette has also trained at the Bates Dance Festival, Gallim Dance Intensive, Movement Research’s MELT Intensive, and the American Dance Festival, where she was a stagecraft apprentice for companies including Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, Ballet Folklorico, Shen Wei Dance Arts, and Pilobolus.\n\nAs a performer, they’ve had the pleasure to work with Johannes Wieland, Renegade Performance Group, Johnny Cruise Mercer, Kayla Farrish, J. Bouey, Thomasin Gulgec, Andre Tyson, Sara Hook, Camilo Godoy, Yun Cheng, and James Avery. Their choreography has premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the Here Arts Summer Sublet Series, and Movement Research at Judson Church.\n\nFor Yolette, dance is rooted in the idea that movement is an act of healing, of resistance against oppressive systems, as well as a form of self-care. Through dance, they believe that we can all find moments of liberation.\n\nKimberly Holloway, Dancer/Collaborator A North Carolina native, Kimberly is a creative soul who likes rich depth of connection, spontaneity, and adventuring to new places. This led her to earn her BFA at Belhaven University, then on to Kansas City where she spent three seasons with Störling Dance Theater, and finally westward to beautiful Seattle.\n\nKimberly is passionate about conveying specific narratives abstractly enough to allow audiences to translate the work through their own experiences. She pairs emotionally visceral movement with technical articulations, her movement infused with quirkiness and virtuosity. She desires to be part of seeing people become themselves fully. Her work has shown at the Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland, The Folly Theater (Kansas City), Out on a Limb Festival (Olympia, WA), Waterfire Arts Center (Providence, RI), and in Seattle at Velocity Dance Center, Fremont Abbey, Studio Current, and Seattle International Dance Festival. Kimberly is the recipient of grants from the Seattle Office of Arts & Culture and Artist Life Guild, the Cornish Arts Incubator Residency, and is an artist in residence at the Fremont Abbey. She has been honored to perform with artists including Michelle Miller/Catapult Dance, Störling Dance Theater, Stone Dance Collective, Shannon Stewart, Alana O Rogers, Maya Soto, and Ashleigh Claire Miller/Faunix. Kimberly has been dancing and creating with Kinesis Project since 2016\n\nKimberly enjoys teaching and sharing movement through classes, and intensives. She teaches for workshops and intensives in NYC, Kansas City, Colorado, Bainbridge Island, and Seattle.\n\nMargaret Behm, Dancer/Collaborator is a dancer and teaching artist with an affinity for improvisation. She takes pride in her own, and guiding others’ discoveries of their dancing bodies, and wants everyone to feel empowered to take up space in the world. Since graduating in 2013 from CU Boulder with a BFA in Dance and a Minor in Women and Gender Studies, Margaret has made a life performing and teaching in Colorado, her home state, with Keshet Dance Company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and now in Seattle, since late 2016. Margaret is a member of AJnC Dance-Theater, directed by Amy J Lambert. Other Seattle artists she has worked with include Wade Madsen, Marlo Martin, Cameo Lethem and Corina Dalzell. As an educator, Margaret is passionate about creating community empowered through movement. She has taught people of all ages and abilities in both studio and community settings. In Albuquerque, Margaret taught adaptive dance, working with dancers with disabilities. She has been an instructor at American Dance Institute since 2016, and is a 2017 graduate of TAT Lab. Margaret has been dancing with Kinesis Project in Seattle since 2019."
