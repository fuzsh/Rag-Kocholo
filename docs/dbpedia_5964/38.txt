Eldar Alexandrovich Ryazanov, the Russian film director responsible for Carnival Night (1956), The Irony of Fate (1975), and The Man from Nowhere (1961)—the only film of his ever to be banned by the Soviet Union—passed away on November 30, reports William Grimes of the New York Times.

For thirty years he worked at refining what he called the “sad comedy,” the range of which went, according to the Novaya Gazeta, “from lyric to satiric, from slapstick to tragicomic fantasy.” Though a popular and well-known filmmaker in his native Russia, he never received the same kind of acclaim in the United States, even though a number of his films made the rounds on the film festival circuit.

In 1984, Ryazanov was given the People’s Artist of the USSR award. He also hosted his own talk show, Guests of Eldar Ryazanov, and the television show Kinopanorama_ (At the Movies), which ran from 1979 to 1985.
