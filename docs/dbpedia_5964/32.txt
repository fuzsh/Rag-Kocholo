Born November 18, 1927 in Samara.

Eldar Ryazanov loved to read since childhood, was going to be a writer, dreamed of traveling. After the ten-year, he even sent a letter - a statement in Odessa Nautical School. But the war went on, and the answer he did not wait.

For chance Ryazanov became a student of 1-year student VGIK (workshop Grigory Mikhailovich Kozintsev). By the time Kozintsev was already world famous director, author of such films as "The Overcoat" (1926), "S.V.D." (1928), "New Babylon" (1929), "One" (1931), "Trilogy of Maxim (1934-1939) (all - together with Leonid Zakharovich Trauberg).
