(Download)\n\n“Operation Y and Shurik’s Other Adventures” (1965)\n\nRussian title: Операция «Ы» и другие приключения Шурика\n\nDirector: Leonid Gaidai\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.5\n\nSummary: A slapstick comedy about a student who gets involved in a series of misadventures.\n\nWhile America had The Three Stooges, Soviet Russia had Shurik. The Shurik movies played a crucial role in shaping the comedic landscape of Soviet cinema and remain iconic to this day. They were social commentaries disguised as slapstick, with Shurik, the quick-witted student, serving as a champion for honesty and wit against bumbling bureaucrats and arrogant figures of authority.\n\nIn “Operation Y and Shurik’s Other Adventures,” we meet the titular student Shurik. The film follows him in three separate yet interconnected stories.\n\nThe first has Shurik face off with a rude drunkard who refuses to give up his seat to a pregnant woman, the second follows his (failed) attempts to cram for upcoming exams and the third pits Shurik against the same drunk man from the first story, this time at a construction site.\n\nThroughout the film, Shurik’s intelligence, humor and resourcefulness help him navigate these comedic situations, often leaving the rude and arrogant characters outsmarted and humbled.\n\n“Kidnapping, Caucasian Style” (1966)\n\nRussian title: Кавказская пленница, или Новые приключения Шурика\n\nDirector: Leonid Gaidai\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.3\n\nSummary: Misadventures ensue when a naïve ethnographer unwittingly aids a corrupt official’s kidnapping scheme.\n\nThe Russian title of this film translates to “Prisoner of the Caucasus, or Shurik’s New Adventures,” but the movie is better known in English as “Kidnapping, Caucasian Style.” This time, Shurik travels to the Caucasus to research local customs and folklore and encounters the charming young Nina.\n\nA powerful local official, Saakhov, covets Nina’s hand in marriage but faces her resistance. Enter Shurik, who unwittingly gets mistaken for a potential groom and becomes part of Saakhov’s elaborate plan to “abduct” Nina as part of a local tradition.\n\nWhat unfolds is a hilarious rollercoaster of cultural clashes, mistaken identities and slapstick situations as Shurik navigates the chaos, unaware of the true motive behind his involvement.\n\nShurik and other old Russian movies offer an especially valuable glance into the often layered nature of Russian media. That’s why learning with authentic content like these Russian comedies is so important to understanding the language and culture. The FluentU program is a great way to get even more exposure to Russian videos, with embedded learning tools.\n\n“Beware of the Car” (1966)\n\nRussian title: Берегись автомобиля\n\nDirector: Eldar Ryazanov\n\nIMDB Rating: 8\n\nSummary: A charismatic carjacker outsmarts the authorities and redistributes wealth to the needy.\n\nYuri Detochkin appears to be an ordinary insurance agent with a passion for car repair. But by night, he leads a secret double life as a skilled and charming car thief. Yuri doesn’t steal from just anyone—he targets corrupt officials and profiteers who flaunt their ill-gotten gains by driving fancy cars.\n\nHe then discreetly sells these stolen vehicles and uses the money to help those in need, particularly orphans.\n\nYuri becomes friends with Maxim, a detective tasked with catching the elusive car thief. Little does Max know, his new friend and the culprit he chases are one and the same! As Yuri continues his Robin Hood-esque activities, the law closes in, the cat-and-mouse game with Max intensifies and a charming romance blossoms in his personal life.\n\n“Don’t Grieve” (1968)\n\nRussian title: Не горюй!\n\nDirector: Georgiy Daneliya\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.8\n\nSummary: Life and love blossom across two generations amid wartime hardships.\n\n“Don’t Grieve” paints a poignant portrait of love and resilience amidst the devastation of World War II. Set in a small Ukrainian village under German occupation, the story follows Sasha, a young woman, and Boris, a soldier on leave.\n\nTheir lives collide unexpectedly and in the face of hardship and uncertainty, a deep bond blossoms between them. They find solace and strength in each other, providing love and support to themselves, orphaned children in the village and others impacted by the war.\n\nThe film doesn’t shy away from the harsh realities of wartime, balancing the tragedy with moments of tenderness, humor and hope.\n\n“The Diamond Arm” (1969)\n\nRussian title: Бриллиантовая рука\n\nDirector: Leonid Gaidai\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.3\n\nSummary: A screwball comedy about a bumbling Soviet citizen who gets tricked into smuggling diamonds.\n\nMeet Semyon Gorbunkov, just a simple, honest worker on a relaxing cruise. Fate throws him a curveball when he accidentally breaks his arm in Istanbul. While seeking medical attention, he gets entangled with a gang of smugglers who mistake him for their diamond courier. Unbeknownst to Semyon, they hide their precious gems inside his cast.\n\nWhen Semyon returns to the USSR, he suddenly finds the smugglers in pursuit, desperate to retrieve their loot. What unfolds is a hilarious caper filled with slapstick comedy, mistaken identities and a dash of satire.\n\nSemyon, aided by his wife and a charismatic neighbor, tries to evade the criminals while grappling with his newfound “treasure.”\n\n“Twelve Chairs” (1971)\n\nRussian title: Двенадцать стульев\n\nDirector: Leonid Gaidai\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.2\n\nSummary: Two penniless adventurers chase hidden treasure hidden in a lost chair set.\n\nThis movie is based on the 1928 novel of the same name by Ilf and Petrov, and was directed by Leonid Gaidai, who you might recognize as the mind behind the famous Shurik movies. While there have been many adaptations of the book (including a 1970 film by Mel Brooks!), this one remains the most beloved.\n\nIn the film, the poor nobleman Ippolit “Kisa” Vorobyaninov and cunning ex-convict Ostap Bender join forces on a treasure hunt across Soviet Russia. Before her death, Kisa’s mother-in-law confessed to hiding diamonds inside one of their 12 dining chairs. The chairs, however, were scattered by the revolution.\n\nTheir quest becomes a hilarious journey across diverse regions, encountering wacky characters and absurd situations. As they acquire chairs one by one, the duo face hilarious roadblocks, posing as bill-painters, bamboozling a chess club and even getting trapped on a mountaintop.\n\nMeanwhile, they continue to evade Father Fyodor, a priest who overheard the confession and covets the jewels for himself.\n\n“Gentlemen of Fortune” (1971)\n\nRussian title: Джентльмены удачи\n\nDirector: Aleksandr Sery\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.3\n\nSummary: A criminal doppelganger of a history professor leads them both on a wild ride of mistaken identity.\n\nSemyon Gorbunkov is a kind but absent-minded kindergarten teacher, and Dmitri Tsvetkov is a notorious criminal dubbed “Dotsent.” The two seem to have nothing in common… except an uncanny resemblance, which becomes the catalyst for chaos.\n\nThe criminal Dotsent escapes from prison and disappears, leaving behind a stolen gold helmet worth a fortune. The authorities, desperate to recover it, hit upon a daring plan: replace Dotsent with Semyon!\n\nThe gentle teacher suddenly finds himself thrust into the criminal underworld, tasked with infiltrating Dotsent’s gang and uncovering the helmet’s location.\n\n“Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future” (1973)\n\nRussian title: Иван Васильевич меняет профессию\n\nDirector: Leonid Gaidai\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.4\n\nSummary: A hilarious time travel comedy about a housing management officer who accidentally travels back to the time of Ivan the Terrible.\n\nThis film, titled “Ivan Vasilievich Changes His Profession” in Russian, is another gem from Gaidai and is based on the play “Ivan Vasileivich” by Mikhail Bulgakov.\n\nA young engineer manages to invent a time machine. However, his creation malfunctions and accidentally sends him, a bumbling burglar and his grumpy building manager back to the 16th century. There, the building manager, who looks eerily similar to the real Tsar Ivan the Terrible, finds himself mistaken for the fearsome leader.\n\nForced to impersonate the Tsar, he struggles to navigate the courtly intrigues and brutal reality of Ivan’s reign. Meanwhile, the engineer and burglar try to blend in while desperately seeking a way back to their own time. As chaos ensues, misunderstandings multiply and historical figures like Leonardo da Vinci get hilariously involved.\n\n“The Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath!” (1975)\n\nRussian title: Ирония судьбы, или С легким паром!\n\nDirector: Eldar Ryazanov\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.1\n\nSummary: A drunken mix-up sends a man to a stranger’s apartment, sparking unexpected romance and a night of comedic chaos.\n\nOn a snowy New Year’s Eve in Moscow, three friends embark on their annual tradition: celebrating at the local bathhouse. Amidst copious amounts of vodka and steam, Zhenya, a young man about to get married, accidentally boards the wrong plane to Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) instead of Moscow.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, there exists the same exact apartment building address in both cities, with identical layouts. Dazed and confused, Zhenya enters the apartment of the beautiful young Nadya, believing it’s his friend’s place in Moscow.\n\nThrough a series of misunderstandings and comical situations, a connection sparks between the two unlikely protagonists. Then Nadya’s fiancé Ippolit unexpectedly arrives, creating further confusion and leading to hilarious clashes of personalities.\n\n“Irony of Fate,” better known as “С легким паром!” (“Enjoy Your Bath!”) became an instant phenomenon, transcending its romantic-comedy premise to become a national treasure. With its iconic soundtrack, heartwarming characters and relatable scenarios, it became a must-watch holiday tradition.\n\n“Mimino” (1977)\n\nRussian title: Мимино\n\nDirector: Georgiy Daneliya\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.1\n\nSummary: A heartwarming comedy about a Georgian truck driver who moves to Moscow.\n\nJourney with Valiko Mizandari, a charming and passionate helicopter pilot nicknamed “Mimino” (“falcon” in Georgian). Mimino soars through the breathtaking mountains of his home region, transporting everything from mail and fruit to sheep and cows. His dream, however, transcends the local skies: He longs to pilot large international airliners.\n\nDriven by this ambition, Mimino leaves his beloved mountains and heads to the big city of Moscow. A pivotal encounter with Rubik, a truck driver from Armenia, leads to a series of unexpected adventures and hilarious situations.\n\nHowever, as Mimino experiences the wonders of the world and complexities of city life, he grapples with a newfound longing for his mountain home and the simple life he left behind.\n\n“Office Romance” (1978)\n\nRussian title: Служебный роман\n\nDirector: Eldar Ryazanov\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.2\n\nSummary: A timid statistician and a stern director find love amidst clashing personalities and workplace humor.\n\nWhen Ludmila Prokofievna Kalugina, a stern and efficient director of an office, and Anatoly Novoseltsev, a timid statistician new to the department meet, their personalities clash instantly. Ludmila criticizes Anatoly’s lack of initiative, while he finds her aloof and intimidating.\n\nFate intervenes when Anatoly’s friend suggests he use his charm to gain favor with Ludmila. Hesitantly, Anatoly tries awkward attempts at courtship, leading to more clashes and comedic confusion.\n\nAs they work together on a project, they discover humor and kindness beneath each other’s gruff exteriors, leading to unexpected moments of connection. But will their office romance blossom despite workplace gossip and their contrasting personalities?\n\nDon’t confuse this with the (inferior, in my opinion) 2011 remake!\n\n“Love and Pigeons” (1984)\n\nRussian title: Любовь и голуби\n\nDirector: Vladimir Menshov\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.9\n\nSummary: A plumber’s dream vacation goes hilariously wrong when he inadvertently ends up on a remote island with a flock of trained pigeons.\n\nThis film follows Vasily Murashov, a plumber with a peaceful life and a fondness for pigeons. His passion leads him to enter a prestigious pigeon breeding competition and win a trip to the sunny Black Sea resort. However, Vasily’s wife, Nadezhda, misinterprets his excitement as boredom with their marriage and takes off.\n\nFeeling a mix of guilt and liberation, Vasily embarks on his prize-winning trip…. where he accidentally releases his trained pigeons in the unfamiliar landscape, leaving him stranded and pigeon-less.\n\nIn this predicament, he encounters Raisa, a confident and independent woman vacationing at the resort. Vasily grapples with navigating a new romantic possibility while still experiencing lingering feelings for his home and all the while trying to recapture his lost pigeons.\n\n“Kin-dza-dza!” (1986)\n\nRussian title: Кин-дза-дза!\n\nDirector: Georgiy Daneliya\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.9\n\nSummary: A surreal sci-fi satire where two men travel to a bizarre planet and struggle to understand its absurd customs.\n\nVladimir (Uncle Vova), a middle-aged worker, and Gedevan (Fiddler), a young student, are accidentally transported to a desolate and strange planet called Pluke. On this planet, water is considered a luxury, social status is determined by the color of your pants and communication involves telepathy.\n\nLost and confused, Uncle Vova and Fiddler’s simple quest to return home gets tangled in misunderstandings and encounters with quirky characters. Throughout their journey, they desperately try to understand the nonsensical language, acquire the coveted “Kets” (matches) and ultimately, escape this ridiculous planet.\n\n“Peculiarities of the National Fishing” (1998)\n\nRussian title: Особенности национальной рыбалки\n\nDirectors: Alexander Rogozhkin and Inna Gorlova\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.2\n\nSummary: A mockumentary about the unique fishing customs of a remote Russian village.\n\nSet in the remote wilderness of Russia, the film follows a group of men who embark on a fishing trip, each with their own quirks and idiosyncrasies. As they navigate the challenges of fishing and bonding in the wilderness, they unknowingly cross the border into a neighboring country.\n\nUnaware of this, they continue their fishing spree, blissfully oblivious to the cultural differences and hilarious misunderstandings that await them.\n\nWith each fish caught and story shared, the film celebrates the joys of friendship, unexpected adventures and embracing the quirks of different cultures, all filtered through a lens of lighthearted humor.\n\nThis is the second film in the “Peculiarities of the National…” series, but it’s not necessary to watch the others to understand this one. The series shares common characters and explores different situations: hunting, winter hunting and politics.\n\n“What Men Talk About” (2010)\n\nRussian title: О чем говорят мужчины\n\nDirector: Dmitriy Dyachenko\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.5/10\n\nSummary: Four friends gather for regular fishing trips, where they share their thoughts on life, love, and male anxieties.\n\nIn “What Men Talk About,” join four middle-aged friends on their regular fishing trips, where they gather not just for the catch, but for honest and sometimes humorous conversations about life, love and masculinity.\n\nAs they cast their lines and unwind on the water, their conversations range from lighthearted banter about women and work to more introspective discussions about personal anxieties, aging and the evolving expectations of men in society.\n\nThese candid dialogues reveal their vulnerabilities and their dreams, painting a relatable picture of male friendship and emotional connection. The film avoids clichés and delves into nuanced portrayals of masculinity, showing how men support each other.\n\nBonus: “KVN” (1950)\n\nRussian title: Клуб Весёлых и Находчивых (Club of the Funny and Inventive)\n\n“KVN” isn’t a movie but no list of Russian comedies would be complete without mention of this iconic and hilarious variety show.\n\n“КВН” (KVN), which stands for “Клуб Весёлых и Находчивых” (Club of the Funny and Inventive) is a comedic competition show where teams from various cities and universities compete against each other through themed comedy sketches, improvisations and humorous performances.\n\nThe show has been a beloved and influential program in Russian culture since its inception in the late 1950s, fostering talent and creativity among young comedians and entertainers.\n\nIncredibly, it’s still ongoing today! It’s maintained its popularity over the years and continues to be broadcast on television in Russia and other countries where Russian-speaking communities exist. The format has evolved over time, but the essence of the show remains the same.\n\nIf you want a true taste of Russian humor, past and present, this series is a must-watch!\n\nHumor in a different language can be hard to understand. After all, it’s tied so closely to the culture and the things it finds funny and satirical. The 15 Russian comedies (and one hilarious show) offer a fantastic glimpse into Russian humor."
