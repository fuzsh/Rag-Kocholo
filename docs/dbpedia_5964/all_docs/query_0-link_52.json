Rhodes Board of advisors: Lizelle Bisschoff (University of Glasgow) Stephanie Hemelryck Donald (University of Lincoln) Anna Misiak (Falmouth University) Des O’Rawe (Queen’s University Belfast) ReFocus is a series of contemporary methodological and theoretical approaches to the interdisciplinary analyses and interpretations of international film directors, from the celebrated to the ignored, in direct relationship to their respective culture—its myths, values, and historical precepts—and the broader parameters of international film history and theory. The series provides a forum for introducing a broad spectrum of directors, working in and establishing movements, trends, cycles, and genres including those historical, currently popular, or emergent, and in need of critical assessment or reassessment. It ignores no director who created a historical space—either in or outside of the studio system—beginning with the origins of cinema and up to the present. ReFocus brings these film directors to a new audience of scholars and general readers of Film Studies. Titles in the series include: ReFocus: The Films of Susanne Bier Edited by Missy Molloy, Mimi Nielsen, and Meryl Shriver-Rice ReFocus: The Films of Francis Veber Keith Corson ReFocus: The Films of Jia Zhangke Maureen Turim and Ying Xiao ReFocus: The Films of Xavier Dolan Edited by Andrée Lafontaine ReFocus: The Films of Pedro Costa: Producing and Consuming Contemporary Art Cinema Nuno Barradas Jorge ReFocus: The Films of Sohrab Shahid Saless: Exile, Displacement and the Stateless Moving Image Edited by Azadeh Fatehrad ReFocus: The Films of Pablo Larraín Edited by Laura Hatry ReFocus: The Films of Michel Gondry Edited by Marcelline Block and Jennifer Kirby ReFocus: The Films of Rachid Bouchareb Edited by Michael Gott and Leslie Kealhofer-Kemp ReFocus: The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky Edited by Sergey Toymentsev edinburghuniversitypress.com/series/refocint\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd ii\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nReFocus: The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky Edited by Sergey Toymentsev\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd iii\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nEdinburgh University Press is one of the leading university presses in the UK.

All of his features won prestigious awards at international film festivals and have gained cult status among cineastes, often being mentioned in various kinds of ranking polls and charts dedicated to the “best films ever made.” The British Film Institute, for example, honored three of Tarkovsky’s films in its “50 Greatest Films of All Time” poll conducted for the film magazine Sight & Sound in 2012: Andrei Rublev (1966) is ranked at No. 26, Mirror (1974) at No. 19, and Stalker (1979) at No. 29. In fact, rumor has it that the Russian director supposedly knew that he was going to make only seven features. In his essay-film One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevitch (1999), Chris Marker makes a reference to a spiritualist séance at which the soul of Boris Pasternak allegedly informed the filmmaker he would make only seven films—“but good ones.” Improbable and supernatural as this legend may seem, Pasternak’s prophecy is well documented in Tarkovsky’s diary, where he repeatedly recalls it at moments of self-doubt and loss of confidence.2 Despite being a relatively small body of work, Tarkovsky’s films—famous for languid pacing, excessively long takes, dreamlike imagery, spiritual depth, and philosophical allegories— have had a profound influence on world cinema. On the one hand, by having revolutionized the aesthetic possibilities of the cinematic medium, he is widely considered one of the progenitors of slow cinema, alongside other auteurs such as Béla Tarr, Theo Angelopoulos, and Tsai Ming-liang, among others; while numerous critically acclaimed directors— Lars von Trier, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, and many more— openly admit his substantial influence on their work. On the other hand, the\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 1\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n2\n\nS E RG E Y T O Y M E N T S E V\n\n“cultlike veneration and imitation”3 of Tarkovskian stylistic features and artistic ideals have produced a phenomenon called “the Tarkovsky syndrome,” or Tarkovshchina, which stands for unnecessary intellectualization, messianic selfaggrandizement, and elitism in film, mostly evident in the Russian cinema of the late 1980s and early 1990s.4 Having become an integral part of global cultural heritage, his films are now regularly screened in repertory cinemas all over the world, just as his treatise Sculpting in Time: Reflections on the Cinema (1986) has been translated into multiple languages. The cult of Tarkovsky peaked especially in post-Soviet Russia, where the director has been exalted into a national hero whom countless hagiographic memoirs, semi-fictional biographies, and laudatory documentaries almost unanimously herald him as prophet, visionary, and martyr. Furthermore, in 2017 Russian philanthropists set up a monument to the director in Suzdal (Figure I.1), where his Andrei Rublev was shot in 1965, in addition to the 2009 monument at the entrance to the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) in Moscow, where Tarkovsky stands in the company of his no less legendary schoolmates, Vasily Shukshin and Gennady Shpalikov (Figure I.2).\n\nFigure I.1 Monument to Andrei Tarkovsky and Andrei Rublev’s characters in Suzdal.\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 2\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nR E F O C U S O N TA R K O V S K Y\n\n3\n\nFigure I.2 Monument to Andrei Tarkovsky, Gennady Shpalikov, and Vasily Shukshin at the entrance to the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography, Moscow.\n\nThe aim of this volume is to move beyond this kind of fascination with the Russian master and take a more level-headed approach to his career by balancing cinephilic enthusiasm with academic expertise. Tarkovsky’s cinema has always attracted film scholars because of the philosophical depth and aesthetic appeal of his films. As Birgit Beumers rightly points out, there is an “over-emphasis in scholarship” on Tarkovsky at the expense of other Russian filmmakers who are no less worthy of attention.5 At the same time, despite the impressive scope of Tarkovsky criticism written in, or translated into, English—sixteen monographs and two collections of essays—most monographic studies, with the exception of Nariman Skakov’s The Cinema of Tarkovsky: Labyrinths of Space and Time (2012), which actively engages with cultural theory, are methodologically limited to film history and formalist analysis.6 Although all of them have done an excellent job at placing Tarkovsky’s films into their biographical, historical, and cultural contexts by extensively commenting on their production history as well as overall narrative and symbolic structure, such studies nevertheless fail to capture the rich complexity of his work, while being heavily descriptive and undertheorized. Scholars’ considerable aversion or indifference to theory and their concomitant immersion in the analysis of narrative motifs and cinematic techniques became a rather consistent feature of the field that could be traced from the earliest to more recent literature on the subject. Maya Turovskaya, for example,\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 3\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n4\n\nS E RG E Y T O Y M E N T S E V\n\nadmits from the start in her pioneering book-length study Tarkovsky: Cinema as Poetry (1989) that her “book was written . . . straight from the heart,” that is, from her first-hand knowledge of Soviet film industry as well as personal conversations with the director.7 Her perspective of a “knowledgeable insider,” however, masks a lack of theoretical sophistication in her perceptive readings of the films. Vida Johnson and Graham Petrie’s The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky: A Visual Fugue (1994) is acclaimed as the highest standard in the field due to its encyclopedic scope and rigorous research, yet it almost never refers to any film theory (with the exception of “post-theoretical” David Bordwell and Noël Carrol), just as it downgrades Tarkovsky’s own aesthetic views as anachronistic. Johnson and Petrie’s skepticism regarding theoretical abstractions is especially evident in their critical assessment of previous studies of the filmmaker by European critics (e.g. Guy Gauthier, András Bálint Kovács, and Antoine de Baecque), whose contributions they condemn as “high-blown philosophical analyses . . . [written] in that cloudy, pompous, pseudo-poetic style that has now infiltrated from its natural home in France into what was once plain English prose.”8 Contrary to the philosophical (or poststructuralist) approach to film, which is, according to Johnson and Petrie, often based on “flimsy evidence,” “downright inaccuracies,” “factual mistakes,” and “grandiose philosophical constructs,”9 they emphasize instead the importance of paying attention to the narrative and aesthetic details of Tarkovsky’s films as well as their cultural and historical contextualization. Robert Bird’s Andrei Tarkovsky: Elements of Cinema (2008) continues to abstain from theoretical interventions in his detailed hermeneutical analysis of the director’s visual aesthetics which he laboriously maintains at the level of neutral phenomenological description. As he states, the main focus of his book is “Tarkovsky’s sense of cinematic pitch, rather than any discursive ‘meaning’ of his films;”10 hence, much attention is given to the representational devices of the cinematic medium from the viewer’s perspective as well as the director’s statements about cinema as art, the aspects which were left out in Johnson and Petrie’s study. While considering Tarkovsky as a “great practitioner” rather than a “great thinker” or a “philosophical filmmaker” (following Alexei German’s observation),11 Bird admirably succeeds in justifying the aesthetic autonomy of his films from his mystical and religious inclinations. Still, he appears far too cautious to avoid “sealing Tarkovsky’s films with the glue of theory”12 by briefly mentioning a number of theorists (e.g. Bergson, Deleuze, Lacan) without fully engaging with their ideas. The anti-theoretical (or post-theoretical) stance in Tarkovsky studies reached its full momentum in Thomas Redwood’s Andrei Tarkovsky’s Poetics of Cinema (2010), methodologically informed by the analytical discourse of such post-theorists as David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, namely their notion of “parametric narration” in art cinema driven by its commitment to\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 4\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nR E F O C U S O N TA R K O V S K Y\n\n5\n\nstyle rather than plot development. In his neo-formalist study, Redwood outrightly dismisses the worth of any “overarching” film theory for his project (“be it ontological, phenomenological, psychological, theological, ‘cultural’ or whatever”) and concentrates exclusively on the interplay of subtle stylistic strategies and devices that constitute “the internal narrational dynamics of Tarkovsky’s films.”13 Even though Redwood’s analytical rigor does feel like a breath of fresh air in Tarkovsky criticism preoccupied with religious and spiritualist problematics, it is hard not to notice that the focus of his study is indeed “strictly and conscientiously limited,” just as his perspective on the subject is “somewhat old fashioned.”14 He never allows his references to other fields— such as art criticism, musicology, psychoanalysis, or philosophy—to evolve into a mutually productive interdisciplinary engagement which Tarkovsky’s work actively suggests. The growing corpus of Tarkovsky scholarship also includes two collections of essays that follow the same tendency described above. Gunnlaugur A. Jónsson and Thorkell Á. Óttarsson’s Through the Mirror (2006) is largely dedicated to mystical and theological themes, and includes only two out of thirteen contributions that approach the filmmaker from theoretical perspectives (e.g. Bazin and Deleuze); whereas twenty essays in Nathan Dunne’s Tarkovsky (2008) discuss mostly aesthetic, thematic, and historical aspects of his oeuvre. As one reviewer described Dunne’s volume, “the book is definitely ‘posttheory’: although some authors invoke a few philosophers, from Heidegger and Benjamin to Deleuze and Derrida, these references . . . do not evolve into a sustained theoretically informed analysis.”15 At the same time, Tarkovsky scholarship is being continuously enriched by journal articles and various collections’ chapters from film scholars specializing in feminism, psychoanalysis, poststructuralism, diaspora studies, urban studies, and film-philosophy, thus leaving their interpretative trace on the reception of his work.16 The purpose of this volume is therefore to reinforce the latter tendency by placing Tarkovsky in a more interdisciplinary and methodologically diverse context without, however, underestimating the value of previous achievements in the field. Another trend in Tarkovsky scholarship, which this volume aims to counter, is the incurable idolatry of the director in Russian-language film studies. A considerable number of Tarkovsky scholars in Russia have largely contributed to the field since the early 2000s, yet most of their contributions, despite their scholarly input, are permeated by hagiographic pathos and intensely preoccupied with religious themes and symbols. Igor Evlampiev, for example, approaches the filmmaker as a religious philosopher striving for the Absolute along with other Russian thinkers grounded in the Orthodox Christian tradition, such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Nikolai Berdyaev, and Lev Shestov.17 In a similar vein, Nikolai Boldyrev offers several biographical studies of Tarkovsky’s mysticism in connection to Zen Buddhism, German Romanticism, Carlos Castaneda, and\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 5\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n6\n\nS E RG E Y T O Y M E N T S E V\n\nRudolf Steiner.18 Both authors, however, passionately idolize the director as a spiritual teacher, just as his films are uncritically viewed as incarnations of divine truth. Tarkovsky’s reverent treatment still persists even when scholars focus on more aesthetic subjects of research. Dmitry Salynskii, for example, discusses the filmmaker’s career in terms of St Augustine’s hermeneutical model, in which meaning is hierarchically distributed on literal, allegorical, moral, and eschatological levels, and explains it as a “meta-film” consistently ascending towards the transcendental realm and culminating in his final film The Sacrifice where the eschatological dimension manifests itself to the fullest. However rich and ambitious Salynskii’s 570-page opus is, it locks Tarkovsky’s work in the confines of scholastic hermeneutics, while heavily discriminating the material layer in his films.19 Mikhail Perepelkin examines the filmmaker’s engagement with literature and poetry, but his allegorical perspective often results in decoding cinematic images as the signs of hidden epiphany.20 Natalia Kononenko’s monograph undertakes a rigorous audiovisual analysis of the soundtrack evolving throughout Tarkovsky’s entire career, yet she ostensibly downplays the role of sound-designers in his films, Eduard Artemiev and Owe Svensson, while crediting the director with “demiurgic” powers in creating his “sounding world.”21 Such a scholarly reverence for Tarkovsky in his native country may certainly put off a Western reader accustomed to a more impartial film criticism and could be studied in its own right as a symptom of anti-modern sentiments in the present-day Russian humanities excessively concerned with the issues of spirituality (dukhovnost’) and patriotism, and their ideological investment in national cultural politics. It is against the backdrop of these tendencies in Tarkovsky scholarship— namely the methodological narrowness of Anglophone auteur studies on the one hand and Russophone hagiographic zeal on the other—that this volume hopes to offer new directions and insights for the study of the filmmaker by opening up the field to various interdisciplinary approaches. While refocusing on Tarkovsky through a more theoretical lens (e.g. Green, Lacan, Bergson, Deleuze, Aristotle, Lyotard, Žižek, Merleau-Ponty, Hadot, Kristeva, Bloom, and Sloterdijk, among others), the present work by no means intends to rekindle the theory vs. post-theory debate and advocate the legitimacy of “grand theory” for its own sake.22 The volume’s emphasis on the theoretical recontextualization of Tarkovsky’s legacy should rather be viewed as yet another endeavor to understand his films in their multifaceted complexity: whereas earlier studies were more grounded in empirical research of the director’s career, the following chapters invite the reader to ponder over these and other findings at a more abstract and conceptual level. The volume consists of four parts covering biographical, aesthetic, and philosophical aspects of Tarkovsky’s work, as well as tracing his influence on other filmmakers. Part one, entitled “Backgrounds” (chapters one to three),\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 6\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nR E F O C U S O N TA R K O V S K Y\n\n7\n\ndiscusses extra-cinematic factors that influenced Tarkovsky’s cinema, such as his biography and theoretical statements. Evgeny Tsymbal’s chapter focuses on the traumatic events in the director’s childhood that continued to haunt him throughout his life and found their reflection in his films. Unlike scholars who emphasize the importance of Tarkovsky’s trauma of paternal abandonment for interpreting his films, for Tsymbal it is the director’s strained relationship with his mother that defines much of his artistic impulse. Andrei Gornykh’s chapter continues the discussion of Tarkovsky’s life, albeit in later periods, by offering a verbal code of his psychobiography through a close reading of his diary. Unlike earlier biographers whose work is heavily steeped in hagiography, both authors in this section present their arguments in psychoanalytic terms: Tsymbal methodologically relies on André Green’s notion of the dead mother complex, whereas Gornykh’s approach is informed by Lacan’s theory of the Signifier. The section is concluded by Sergey Toymentsev’s analysis of the filmmaker’s writings on film in light of Bergson’s philosophy. Part two, entitled “Film Method” (chapters four to eight), examines Tarkovsky’s cinematic techniques, including his treatment of film genre, documentary style, temporality, landscape, and sound. Sara Pankenier Weld’s chapter explores how Ivan’s Childhood (1962) transcends the genre of the Soviet war movie by foregrounding the child’s eye view in multiple cinematic dimensions and thus forces the audience into a subservient and vulnerable position. Zdenko Mandušić’s chapter discusses the director’s engagement with the notion of the objective and documentary representation of reality in the context of post-Stalinist aesthetic debates and its practical implementation in Andrei Rublev. Donato Totaro’s chapter provides a detailed textual analysis of Tarkovsky’s long-take technique in Stalker and its key role in creating the atmosphere of spatial and temporal ambiguity in the film. Yelizaveta Goldfarb Moss focuses on the innovative representation of the Russian landscape in Nostalghia (1983), which underscores its unmasterable infinite spatiality via framing and one-point perspectives. This section concludes with Julia Shpinitskaya’s analysis of the complex nature of Tarkovsky’s sound design that, despite its overall commitment to realist aesthetics, tends towards irrealism in his later films. Part three, “Theoretical Approaches” (chapters nine to thirteen), discusses Tarkovsky’s work in the contexts of psychoanalytical, philosophical, and other theoretical perspectives. The section opens with Slavoj Žižek’s “The Thing from Inner Space”, which argues for a materialist reading of Tarkovsky’s films that present an encounter with the radical otherness of some impossible and traumatic Thing, an encounter which is devoid of religious and mystical connotations that often accompany commentators’ discussions. Žižek’s chapter was originally published in Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities, but is presented here in its unabridged version. Another psychoanalytic reading of\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 7\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n8\n\nS E RG E Y T O Y M E N T S E V\n\nTarkovsky’s films is offered in Linda Belau and Ed Cameron’s chapter, which explains the auteur’s spiritual longings as the religious sublimation of his melancholic attachment to the lost object. Tarkovsky’s cinematic materialism, first elaborated by Slavoj Žižek, is further explored in Robert Efird’s chapter, which focuses on Solaris’s chiasmic representation of intersubjective space and time in light of Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy. Anne Eakin Moss argues for the affinity between Pierre Hadot’s philosophy of spiritual practice and Tarkovsky’s films, all of which are characterized by the quixotic seekers of a transcendent aim and cinematic techniques invoking the miraculous. This section concludes with Mikhail Iampolski’s chapter, which focuses on the director’s consistent preoccupation with memory, and delineates his cinematic representation of the past from his attempts to historically reconstruct a period setting in Andrei Rublev, to private and subjective memories and dreams in Solaris and Mirror, and to the impersonal and metaphysical trace in Stalker and Nostalghia. The fourth and final part of this volume, “Legacy” (chapters fourteen and fifteen), is dedicated to Tarkovsky’s long-standing influence on such prominent auteurs as Andrei Zvyagintsev and Lars von Trier, who are often hailed as the heirs of the Russian master, yet have not received sufficient critical attention in this regard. Lisa Ryoko Wakamiya examines the presence of Tarkovskian thematic and stylistic motifs in a series of Zvyagintsev’s films as well as the latter’s struggle for authorial autonomy from the depersonalizing influence of the inherited tradition. Sergey Toymentsev and Anton Dolin focus on von Trier’s lifelong engagement with the Russian director, which begins in his student short films and continues in more recent features. While certainly not intending to be exhaustive, this volume provides a wide coverage of topics related to the director’s oeuvre, ranging from the analysis of key biographical events that influenced the genesis of his personality as an artist, to the discussion of his formative influence on other filmmakers. Furthermore, although all chapters are firmly grounded in critical theory, the present work pays equal (or balanced) attention to both empirical (aesthetic and technical) and purely theoretical aspects of his work. Overall, this volume hopes to emphasize the urgency of a more sober appreciation of Tarkovsky’s films as well as inspire further critical inquiry and debate. NOTES 1.

To be exact, at this spiritualist séance, which allegedly took place before Tarkovsky started working on Solaris (1972), Pasternak foretold that the director would make “another four films,” which amounts to six, not seven of his features in total. As we read in his diary’s entry of 27 January 1973, “Boris Leonidovich [Pasternak] was obviously right when he said\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 8\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nR E F O C U S O N TA R K O V S K Y\n\n3. 4. 5. 6.\n\n7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16.\n\n9\n\nthat I would make another four pictures. I’ve made the first—Solaris. That leaves another three.” In an entry of 22 November 1979 he prepares a list of questions to consult with a local psychic, one of which is: “Should I believe what Boris Pasternak told me about making four films?” Finally, in an entry of 21 December 1985 Tarkovsky, already stricken with cancer, worries whether he would manage to complete his last film: “I am getting worse by the day. Boris Leonidovich Pasternak was right when he said I would make another four films.

The section opens with Evgeny Tsymbal’s chapter on the traumatic events in the director’s childhood that continued to haunt him throughout his life. Tarkovsky scholars often point out the autobiographical nature of his cinema and, more specifically, how the divorce of his parents influenced his cinematic representation of marital relationships. According to Helena Goscilo (2010), for example, Tarkovsky’s personal trauma of paternal abandonment provides a clue to the narrative structure of his films. For Tsymbal, however, it is the director’s strained relationship with his mother, viewed in the context of André Green’s theory of the dead mother complex, that defines much of his artistic impulse. This chapter also discusses what hardships Tarkovsky experienced during the wartime and how his father’s influence inadvertently helped him choose his future profession. Andrei Gornykh’s chapter offers a close reading of Tarkovsky’s diary from a Lacanian perspective by focusing on the director’s recurrent use of those keywords which symbolically epitomize and organize the major thematic layers of his biography and cinema as well: namely, grass (or trava in Russian), persecution from the state authorities (travlia), and expense (trata). Phonetically consonant and etymologically derived from the same root tra(or proto-Slavic ter-), these words make up a coherent cluster of signifiers (trava-trata-travlia) which are centered around the director’s primal fantasy of the house. As the author argues, the signifying constellation “trava-tratatravlia” in Tarkovsky’s diary could be viewed as a psychobiographical code to the internal dynamics of his visual imagery.\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 13\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n14\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N T O PA RT I\n\nThis part concludes with Sergey Toymentsev’s chapter, which attempts to answer the question whether Tarkovsky’s insights in cinema, documented in interviews and in Sculpting in Time (1986), could amount to a coherent film theory. Although many scholars observe that one should abandon analytical reasoning while comprehending his films, they nevertheless follow a certain logic that seems to align with many of Henry Bergson’s philosophical arguments. The same could be said about Tarkovsky’s theoretical propositions: namely, his preference for intuition over intellectual cognition, psychological duration over chronological time, the past over the present, as well as his foregrounding the dual nature of the film image in which subjective consciousness (spirit) and objective reality (matter) are coalesced into a single unit. Viewing Tarkovsky as being subconsciously Bergsonian, the author argues, could help us salvage his theoretical musings from being dismissed as unembarrassedly Romantic or outdated.\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 14\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1\n\nTarkovsky’s Childhood: Between Trauma and Myth Evgeniy Tsymbal\n\nT\n\narkovsky’s early films, such as The Steamroller and the Violin (1961) and Ivan’s Childhood (1962), as well as his later Mirror (1974) are usually viewed as his most autobiographical films in which he realistically reproduces the happiest moments of his childhood, experienced either in Moscow or in the village of Ignatievo. By narrativizing his childhood as a pastoral paradise, Tarkovsky places himself into Russian literary heritage exemplified by such prominent works as Leo Tolstoy’s Childhood, Boyhood, Youth (1852–7), Sergei Aksakov’s Childhood Years (1856), Alexander Herzen’s My Past and Thoughts (1852–68), Ivan Bunin’s The Life of Arseniev (1927–39), and Vladimir Nabokov’s Speak, Memory (1947), to name but a few. All of these writers not only recollected their childhood to the minutest detail, they reinvented it as a blissful and enchanted realm by mixing memory with myth. Yet it would be a mistake to think of Tarkovsky’s fictionalized account of his childhood exclusively in mythical terms, since its idyllic appearance is indispensable from its deeply traumatic underside. In this chapter I explore the early years of Tarkovsky’s biography, presented mostly by his sister Marina Tarkovskaya, in order to trace how the traumatic events of the director’s childhood found their uncanny expression in his films. I primarily focus on how young Andrei was affected by his parents’ divorce as well as his mother’s consequent alienation in later years. To get a better glimpse of Andrei’s estranged relationship with his mother, I discuss it in the context of André Green’s theory of the dead mother complex. I also examine how the collective trauma of the war in the 1940s, associated with famine and destroyed families, was experienced by Andrei personally. To conclude, I discuss how the influence and authority of his father, Arseny Tarkovsky, helped his son become an artist as well as overcome his romantic illusions in teenage years.\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 15\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n16\n\nE VG E N I Y T S Y M B A L\n\nE A R LY C H I L D H O O D\n\nThe first years in the life of Andrei Tarkovsky and his sister Marina, before their father left the family, were quite fortunate, even though they lived in extreme poverty. They had this in common with the majority of the Soviet intelligentsia in the early 1930s. Arseny Tarkovsky and Maria Vishnyakova met each other at what is now known as the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute, where both of them were attending the advanced creative writing classes. After dating for a year and a half, they married. Both Andrei (born in 1932) and Marina (born in 1934) were adored by their young parents and surrounded by caring and benevolent people. During the summer the children were taken out to Pavel Gorchakov’s country house near the village of Ignatievo where they were exposed to the beauty and charm of Russian nature. They were at times visited by relatives and friends of their parents, among whom there were many writers and poets who became famous later on. Thus, from the very beginning, they were placed in an artistic environment in which they were exposed to classical music, poetic verse, and intellectual debates. One of their frequent visitors, for example, was the poet and photographer Lev Gornung, the children’s godfather, whose family photographs of the Tarkovskys and their house later became the major inspiration for the creation of Mirror. As Marina Tarkovskaya recalls, her parents at first doted on each other and her mother, according to the poet Maria Petrovykh, used to have a “face as if it was lit up by the sun.”1 Nevertheless, she also adds, “father was rarely at the dacha,”2 as he had to go on long business trips. Yet the happiness of Andrei and Marina’s early childhood was already overshadowed by a number of traumatic circumstances that affected their lives later on. In Stalin’s Russia descendants of noble families who refused to immigrate after the Bolshevik revolution were still viewed with a sneering attitude among common people. This was also the case for representatives of the old Russian intelligentsia who were never respected as a professional middle class, but rather contemptuously disregarded as an intermediate layer between the working class and the peasantry. The rumors about serial arrests, and relatives and acquaintances either disappearing forever or ending up in remote and desolate regions of the country, also served as the disturbing background for their growing up. Furthermore, constant relocations from one apartment to another, and from Moscow to the countryside and back again, undoubtedly had a traumatizing impact on the children and their parents. The main cause was the state-controlled famine spreading through Russia and Ukraine in the early 1930s. As Andrei’s grandmother wrote to his mother at that time, “Marusya, save up flour and send us some grains and flour too because all this is gone here already.”3\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 16\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nTA R K O V S K Y ’ S C H I L D H O O D\n\n17\n\nA B S E N T FAT H E R\n\nThe most powerful trauma of the young Andrei’s life was the dissolution of his family and his father leaving his mother for another woman, Antonina Bokhonova. As most psychologists agree, “The most common and difficult form of emotional trauma is the sudden loss of a loved one.”4 As Tarkovsky himself comments on his early childhood, “I lived with mother, grandmother, and sister. Family without a man. This had a considerable impact on my character . . . That was a difficult time. I have always missed my father. When father left us, I was three years old. Life was incredibly difficult in any possible way.”5 Arseny Tarkovsky abandoned his children and their mother in 1936–7.6 In fact, the proud Maria Vishnyakova willingly helped him to move out by packing his clothes in a suitcase, since she was no longer able to tolerate his sudden disappearances, coming home late at night, offering poor excuses after he started pursuing Antonina Bokhonova, who herself was married at the time. Even though he did help his ex-wife financially from time to time and always tried to maintain a decent relationship with her and the children, for them his departure was, as Nikolai Boldyrev puts it, a “cosmogonic catastrophe.”7 For both Andrei and Marina, their father—despite his occasional visits— forever remained an absent and distant figure whose desertion for another family was simply incomprehensible. As Marina Tarkovskaya writes, in 1937 they and their father’s new family (his new wife also had a daughter from the first marriage) became neighbors and, because of this, they continued to see each other quite often after separation: “I was very surprised back then why my father lived on Party Street and not on Arsenyevsky Street nearby, even though his name was Arseny and he was not a party member . . . Just as why he was not living with me and Andryusha, but with some other girl Lyalya [Bokhonova’s daughter], although he was our father, not hers.”8 As Marina Tarkovskaya later observes, “Andrei dearly loved his father whose departure from the family was deeply traumatic for him.” This is why, she continues, in his diploma film The Steamroller and the Violin (1961) “we see no father of the boy and learn nothing about him.” What we see instead is “the striving of the young protagonist to find a surrogate father in his grown-up friend.”9 Helena Goscilo goes as far as to argue that most of Tarkovsky’s films came out of his continuous struggles to work through his personal “trauma of paternal abandonment”10 and reclaim his father in multiple forms. The Steamroller and the Violin, she argues, blatantly brings out “Tarkovsky’s denigration of women and his yearning for a loving father”11 whose role is adopted by a benevolent steamroller driver. Ivan’s Childhood offers a number of “eager surrogate paternal caretakers” for the young protagonist who, nevertheless, prefers to perish as a fatherless martyr in “a defiant indifference to paternal absence.”12 Solaris (1972), on the contrary, strives “to incorporate the Lost Father into the formative paradigm of\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 17\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n18\n\nE VG E N I Y T S Y M B A L\n\nFamily” by “Tarkovsky’s unexpected wish-fulfillment introduction of a wise and caring paternal figure.”13 Mirror delves into the unresolved issues of the director’s Oedipal drama and stages “the adolescent transfer of cathexis to the father as the norm of male identity formation.”14 The Sacrifice (1986) promises “rebirth and independence for the son, but at the cost of the father’s self-inflicted withdrawal from the son’s life.”15 It is hard to disagree with Goscilo’s assertion that “the absence of [Tarkovsky’s] own father created the single weightiest and psychologically most incapacitating trauma in his life.”16 The impact of this trauma is especially evident in his autobiographical Mirror, which is particularly rich with poignant scenes reproducing the father’s absence from the family. The opening sequence, for example, depicts the mother ritually sitting on the fence and waiting for him to come back, while Arseny Tarkovsky himself is reciting his love poems dedicated to another woman; later on in the film we see his children happily rushing towards him when he returns from the front. However, I want to suggest that Tarkovsky’s “chronic longing”17 for his absent father is not the only clue in his biography that can shed light on the narrative dynamics of his films. The relationship with his mother was no less important. After their divorce, Tarkovsky’s father remarried twice, while his mother remained single for the rest of her life, devoting herself to her work and children. TA R K O V S K Y ’ S M O T H E R\n\nAccording to many testimonies, Tarkovsky’s mother was quite a character, so to speak: she was strict, honest, straightforward, modest, and overly responsible. She was a woman of principle with a clear and unshakable sense of right and wrong, which made her difficult to deal with at times. Her parents also got divorced when she was little. When her mother, Vera Vishnyakova, left her family for another man whom she eventually married, her father, Ivan Vishnyakov, refused to let go of their daughter and thus kept her around for a few years. The mother’s long absence had a traumatic impact on the young Maria, just as her mother, according to Viktor Filimonov (one of Tarkovsky’s biographers), always felt guilty for their long separation. As he writes, “When Vera Nikolaevna [Andrei’s grandmother] learned that Arseny Tarkovsky left the family, she decided to help Maria raise the children, as if she wanted to right the wrongs before her daughter who still couldn’t forgive her the years of loneliness in her childhood.”18 As Marina Tarkovskaya recalls, She never told me how much she suffered while being separated from her mother. Because she had to live with her tough father, while having only secret meetings with her mother in the years of her character formation,\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 18\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nTA R K O V S K Y ’ S C H I L D H O O D\n\n19\n\nshe became shy, reserved, and withdrawn. With time her mother became a stranger to her. Here’s what her grandmother wrote to Lev Vladimirovich Gornung during the war: “Marusya never let me into her life! Since her childhood she has been terribly withdrawn. Should you come any closer to her, she would hide into her shell right away like a snail. As a teenager she couldn’t stand any advice or guidance of worldly wisdom. But now you cannot even talk to her.”19 Even though the reason for the father’s sudden desertion was never discussed in the Tarkovsky family, it is possible to suggest that it had something to do with his perception of Maria Vishnyakova’s personality. She never cared about her clothes or appearance, since she wore only those dresses that were sent by her mother. Her “monastery asceticism,”20 according to Filimonov, was the exact opposite of Arseny Tarkovsky’s subsequent wives, Antonina Bokhonova and Tatiana Ozerskaya, who were both glamorous ladies of literary society. Tarkovsky’s mother, however, was indifferent to judgment from the outside world. As Marina Tarkovskaya testifies, In everyday life our mother was a nihilist: she needed nothing, even window curtains. She was beyond the household concerns. She represented the type of women popular in the 1920s who prioritized spiritual life over everything else, dismissing the rest as petty bourgeois values.21 There’s a proverb: everyone is the blacksmith of his own fortune. And mother was a bad smith. She couldn’t really settle in life and seemed to purposefully choose the hardest paths for herself. She never married again, she went to work in a printing house with its low wages and excessive man-hours, and she declined the evacuation opportunity provided by the Literary Fund during the war. This was all because she always had to be honest even with herself. She never cared about clothing. She thought she had no right to spend money on herself, so she dressed in random clothes. She seemed to need nothing in life, except a cup of tea with a piece of bread and cigarettes.22 After the divorce, Maria Vishnyakova seemed to remain faithful to Arseny by keeping in her memory the image of an ideal husband—a talented poet and the father of their children—she had formed by the time of their marriage. She might have served this image throughout her later life, by idolizing his spiritual essence yet completely overlooking his erotic nature. Arseny, however, was not only a poet, he was also a handsome and down-to-earth man prone to passionate love affairs, for whom the idealistic love of his wife might have seemed rather burdensome. As Marina Tarkovskaya describes him, “Father\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 19\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n20\n\nE VG E N I Y T S Y M B A L\n\nwas a man completely immersed in passion. He was madly and deeply in love with mother. But later, when the feeling for her burnt out, he fell in love with another woman with the same passion. His poet’s nature was completely devoid of rationality.”23 THE DEAD MOTHER COMPLEX: A HYPOTHETICAL R E C O N S T RU C T I O N\n\nIn the years following the divorce, the young Andrei and Marina became unwilling witnesses to their mother’s mournful and sacrificial fidelity to a past love, through which she continued to maintain an integrity and moral rigor that can be compared to the passionate devotion of the Decembrist wives. As Marina Tarkovskaya recalls, When I asked her once why she never married again, she said no one could replace our father to us. We never saw a man around her. The problem of a lifetime companion was solved for her once and for all. Mother was so chaste and timid that everything feminine about her, such as desire to look pretty and be admired, seemed to be unconsciously suppressed.24 Maria Vishnyakova’s steadfast loyalty to her absent husband could also be explained as the result of her deep emotional scarring that prevented her from finding another love interest afterwards. In contemporary psychoanalysis, the mother’s experience of loss and grief is viewed as a catastrophe for the motherchild relationship predicated on the mother’s undivided emotional availability. As André Green demonstrated in his essay “The Dead Mother” (1983), “the mother’s bereavement modifies her fundamental attitude with regard to the child, whom she feels incapable of loving, but whom she continues to love just as she continues to take care of him.”25 The emotional withdrawal of the mother, caused by “the loss of a person dear to her . . . a change of fortune in the nuclear family or the family of origin, a liaison of the father who neglects the mother, humiliation, etc.”26 has a profoundly traumatic impact on the growth of the child who up until then had been the center of the mother’s attention. Green calls this condition the “dead mother complex,” which refers to “a mother who remains alive but who is, so to speak, psychically dead in the eyes of the young child in her care.”27 The child’s psychical murder of the mother, “accomplished without hatred”28 and standing for the decathexis of the maternal image, is, of course, an action of last resort taken out of desperation. It occurs, according to Green, after “the child has attempted in vain to repair the mother who is absorbed by her bereavement, which has made\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 20\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nTA R K O V S K Y ’ S C H I L D H O O D\n\n21\n\nhim feel the measure of his impotence, after having experienced the loss of his mother’s love and the threat of the loss of the mother herself.”29 Such murder results in “the constitution of a hole in the texture of object-relations with the mother,”30 a psychical hole which redirects the trajectory of the child’s psychosexual and intellectual development. Because the mother’s “love has been lost at one blow” and “the baby disposes of no explication to account for what has happened,” “this position . . . obliges him to find someone responsible for the mother’s black mood.”31 From now on the child is destined to forever search for the meaning of the mother’s bereavement and this “loss of meaning” will launch the early development of his or her imagination and cognition. As Green elaborates, the quest for lost meaning structures the early development of the fantasmatic and the intellectual capacities of the ego . . . The compromised unity of the ego which has a hole in it from now on, realizes itself either on the level of fantasy, which gives open expression to artistic creation, or on the level of knowledge, which is at the origin of highly productive intellectualization. It is evident that one is witnessing an attempt to master the traumatic situation.32 The child’s premature development of imagination and cognitive abilities, manifested in his or her “compulsion to imagine” and “compulsion to think,” is thus subjected to the inexplicable mystery of the mother’s withdrawal and directed towards the mastery of its traumatic impact through fantasy and thought. As Green puts it metaphorically, “to surmount the dismay over the loss of the breast,” the child creates “a patched breast, a piece of cognitive fabric which is destined to mask the hole left by the decathexis.”33 Another consequence of such loss is the child’s “early and particularly intense attachment to the father” who is “felt to be the saviour from the conflict” but who, nevertheless, remains unhelpful and inaccessible in reality “because he leaves the mother-child couple to cope with this situation alone.”34 Green’s discovery of the dead mother complex was largely influenced by his clinical practice with patients who happened to be professionally engaged in literature and the arts. Despite their relative success in their abstract creativity, most of them were experiencing dissatisfaction in work and “profound disturbances in love, sexuality and affective communication,”35 which Green diagnosed as the projective actualization of their early childhood struggles with the loss of the mother’s love—or their compulsive reenactment of the experience of the loss—as well as their unconscious identification with the mother’s depressive disposition and incapacity to love. In most cases the image of the dead or unloving mother continues to hold sway over the patients in adulthood by making them unable to commit “to a deeper personal involvement which\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 21\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n22\n\nE VG E N I Y T S Y M B A L\n\nimplies concern for the other.”36 Their treatment, according to Green’s clinical method, “reveals a deep-seated longing for the ideal loving mother, the good mother that preceded the depressed one”37 whom they refuse to mourn. It is the reactivation of the positive maternal imago buried deep down in the unconscious, he argues, that can promise a cure for such patients after many stages of the analysis: namely, “the rediscovery of the early happiness that existed prior to the appearance of the dead mother complex” and the ability “to reach a transferential repetition of a happy relationship with a mother who is alive at last and desirous of the father.”38 Even though we have little evidence to confirm “profound disturbances” in Andrei Tarkovsky’s love life, the complicated relationship with his parents and the autobiographical motifs in his films may well be interpreted in terms of Green’s psychoanalytic insights. It would be reasonable to assume that Maria Vishnyakova did fall into depression after her husband left the family, given her subsequent ascetic commitment to chastity and self-denying devotion to the children’s upbringing. As her daughter testifies, “The sunlight coming from her face quickly went out.”39 Furthermore, given that there is “something transgenerational in the dead mother concept [because] most of the conflicts which make the mother ‘dead’ (while still alive) might be related to her conflicts with the previous generation: her mother, father, etc.,”40 Maria Vishnyakova might have been more susceptible to emotional withdrawal due to the prior traumatic experience of her own mother’s absence in early childhood. And yet, her affective distance as the mother could only be hypothetically reconstructed, since neither Andrei nor Marina ever complained about this in interviews or diary. As Tarkovsky says in a 1984 interview: My mother had a greater influence on me than my father . . . When the war started, not only did she save our lives . . . Being completely inept in everyday life, she did everything so that we could get an education. I went to music school, majoring in piano, and painting school, and I have no idea how she could make this happen, because there were no proper conditions for this at that time . . . If it was not for my mother, I would never be able to become a filmmaker.41 The mother’s bereavement, according to Green, does not prevent her from enacting her nutritious role as a caretaker. Despite Maria Vishnyakova’s sacrificial investment in her children’s lives, she was nevertheless “too tough” on them and, because of this, could appear emotionally distant to them. As Marina Tarkovskaya writes, Her entire life was devoted to the benefit of Andrei and me. But she didn’t spoil us, not at all. She was, on the contrary, too tough on us.\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 22\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nTA R K O V S K Y ’ S C H I L D H O O D\n\n23\n\nAs for Andrei’s upbringing, she must have made a mistake by trying to subdue him, make him follow her orders. And this was impossible, this only estranged him from her.42 The estrangement of the young Andrei, who “was on his own from early childhood,”43 could certainly be explained by his personality traits. Johnson and Petrie, for example, describe him as a restrained loner, touchy and stubborn as well as recalcitrant and hyperactive.44 According to a family friend’s account, “He caused his mother a lot of worry—he was hot-tempered and uncommunicative.”45 And yet, Andrei’s emphatic autonomy from his mother’s supervision could also have been the result of her previous divorce trauma which might have had an alienating effect on the formation of his character. According to Green, the child’s psychological loss of the mother’s love is often temporary, just as its impact varies from case to case, without necessarily developing into clinical depression. But even if the mother comes back to the child after her emotional withdrawal, the latter would never treat her in the same way. As Green argues, “The return of the presence of the object is not enough to heal the disastrous effects of its too long absence. Non-existence has taken possession of the mind, erasing the representations of the object that preceded its absence.”46 It is possible, therefore, to infer that Andrei’s relationship with his mother became strained after Arseny Tarkovsky left them. Both children and their mother were affected by the trauma of paternal abandonment, but it is through the mother’s “bereavement” and her emotional withdrawal that they might have been traumatized most of all. Tarkovsky’s films, however, provide us with more reliable evidence to support our hypothesis about Maria Vishnyakova’s dead mother complex that might have occurred after her husband’s desertion. It is there that we find the most vivid manifestation (“accompanied by a richness of representation and a gift of auto-interpretation”47) of the compulsive reenactment of the experience of the loss that is so characteristic of Green’s patients. Both Solaris and Mirror are structured by the autobiographical protagonist’s narcissistic “quest for lost meaning”48 about the hidden cause of the family dissolution, just as they strive to restore the Oedipal family by reuniting both parents in a pre-traumatic setting and thus rediscover the happy ideal mother before her grieving. Furthermore, Tarkovsky’s later features Stalker and Nostalghia testify how the director’s previous phantasmatic attempts to resurrect the dead mother by making her happy again miserably failed, and how her deadness continues to hold sway over the protagonist by “[drawing his] ego towards a deathly, deserted universe.”49 As Green writes, “The mother’s blank mourning induces blank mourning in the infant, burying a part of his ego in the maternal necropolis.” Isn’t the Stalker’s Zone, in the waters of which he falls asleep in fetal position, indeed a “maternal necropolis”? Nostalghia, dedicated\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 23\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n24\n\nE VG E N I Y T S Y M B A L\n\nto Tarkovsky’s mother, is focused exclusively on the protagonist’s “feeling of narcissistic depletion, expressed phenomenologically by the sentiment of emptiness,”50 which has all the symptoms of Green’s dead mother syndrome. It is therefore safe to argue that the father’s absence in Tarkovsky’s early childhood is not “the single weightiest and psychologically most incapacitating trauma in his life,”51 it is rather the mother’s grieving and emotional withdrawal that became most traumatizing for him and, as a result, stimulated his “intense attachment to the father”52 as well as his quest for lost meaning in art. B OY H O O D T R AU M A S\n\nDuring World War II, Tarkovsky’s family evacuated to Yurievets, about 500 km east from Moscow, to live there with Maria Vishnyakova’s mother until 1943. The evacuation time became a new period of hardships for the young Andrei: whereas in Moscow he used to spend most of his time indoors, in Yurievets he was left on his own and fully exposed to street life, mingling with the tough boys of the town. As his sister writes, Andrei didn’t want to stand out and was friends with the savvy local boys whose influence on him was not always positive. Thus, for example, while recklessly sliding down from the famous Yurievets hills, he would scream a stream of profanities across the area, which was often brought to our mother’s attention. What was most striking in Andrei’s behaviour was his incredible fearlessness. This trait—call it courage or bravery—later helped him to fight Soviet officials of all kinds. It is truly impressive how bravely he defended each of his films!53 Thanks to his innate bravery, the young Andrei was able to save his mother from drowning in the river, which was one of his most traumatic experiences during their stay in Yurievets. Besides their constant shortage of food and harsh living conditions, to keep their house warm enough they were always in need of firewood, most of which could be obtained in the river. As Marina Tarkovskaya recalls, This was our most terrible memory. The early spring of 1942. Ice started to break on the Volga River . . . All the townsfolk came to the riverbank to catch floating pieces of timber which we all needed for heating. We were standing on the bank, collecting the wood our mother would catch in the river, jumping from one ice float to another. All of a sudden, in front of our eyes, she fell through the ice and disappeared for a moment among drifting ice floats.54\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 24\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nTA R K O V S K Y ’ S C H I L D H O O D\n\n25\n\nRisking drowning themselves, Andrei and Marina got their mother out of the dark and cold water and thus experienced the shock of almost losing her. Confronting death and tragedies of the war became somewhat common for the teenage Andrei at that time: most of his schoolmates lost their fathers in the war, just as his female teachers lost their husbands. This is probably why his Mirror dedicates an entire episode to the orphan Asafiev whose parents died in the siege of Leningrad. Andrei’s father himself was severely wounded, while serving as a war correspondent on the front lines, and his leg was amputated as a result. Even after the war was over, the reality of death was still quite palpable: at the age of fourteen he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, which was poorly treated at that time. Missing classes in school, he spent about two years under treatment in various hospitals and sanatoriums, where only half the patients survived. Even though he was cured, weak lungs—inherited from his father—remained a troublesome issue for him for the rest of his life. When Andrei turned eighteen, he decided to get married. Furthermore, because of his passionate engagement with an amateur theatre at school, he was convinced that the stage was his true and only vocation to which he should dedicate his life. He kept both decisions a secret from his mother, knowing she would not approve of them, and wrote his father a letter in which he asked for his opinion. Touched by his son’s request, Arseny Tarkovsky responded with caring fatherly guidance, which may have determined most of Andrei’s decisions later in life: I do not think your childhood was too easy, but I think that you, unfortunately, almost never had a need to be active. You didn’t choose a path for yourself, it was chosen for you by circumstances, and you submitted to them . . . All your problems were solved for you by your mother, not by yourself. Hence, your childhood and adolescence may have been sorrowful, but not difficult. At your age I was more experienced because I was growing up in a more difficult time. But I still remember and understand very well what an airhead I used to be. Nevertheless, it was my untamed passion for poetry that saved and served me as my guiding light back then. I was like you in everything, except poetry. I was also light-minded and ready to follow the circumstances whatever they are, but in poetry my discipline was impeccable . . . Your mother remembers with how much diligence, perseverance, and endurance I worked on my poetry. This is the only thing which was my school of life and which stops me from being ashamed of myself . . . And now I really, really regret that my education (mainly self-education) was directed only toward the path of poetry . . . I really regret that I never studied at some school where I’d needed to work much harder . . . What keeps eating at me is that I didn’t go to study physics, math or natural sciences at\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 25\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n26\n\nE VG E N I Y T S Y M B A L\n\nuniversity when I was seventeen-eighteen. I could have turned to poetry later! How much I would have gained! Here’s my advice: it’s necessary you graduate from high school. Then learn any profession at university (preferably, in natural or physical sciences) and work at least a year in it. If you still have this need for art afterwards, then yes, you may do whatever you want, even get enrolled in acting school. I really wish I could pass you the understanding of my own mistakes so you could use it not to repeat them. Now about your falling in love . . . We share so much in common. We have this propensity to jump off into any abyss if it attracts us somehow and we both forget about everything else . . . And this is bad, this could be harmful. For the love of God, don’t get married . . . What if your marriage turns out to be premature? Life for both of you will turn into hell for which divorce is the only way out: this would be agony for you, your wife, and your children if you have them. I am telling you this because I know it from my experience. Talk to your mother, she will tell you the same.55 According to Tarkovsky’s sister, this letter was not the reason for Andrei’s breaking up with his would-be fiancée, given his passionate and light-hearted nature always ready to move on towards a new romance. Yet what is interesting about these didactic instructions is how they set up a program or a code of rules for Tarkovsky’s career path in the future. As is known, he did try to follow his father’s advice to get a useful profession at university which would require serious work: in the early 1950s he studied Arabic at the prestigious Oriental Institute in Moscow for a little bit more than a year. Neither his mother nor sister could understand why Andrei decided to choose such a major, but Arabic could be viewed as his best approximation of what his father meant by natural sciences. He even worked in a profession related to natural sciences for a year, as his father requested, by participating as a prospector in a research expedition to the taiga prior to his enrolment in the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK) in Moscow. Furthermore, as a filmmaker he fully adopted his father’s poetic perfectionism, which he later idolized as if it were some sort of religious service requiring suffering and sacrifice. C O N C LU S I O N\n\nDespite the poetic authority of his father, to whom he always looked up with the greatest admiration, it is nevertheless to his mother that Tarkovsky owed much of his personality formation, both as a person and an artist. As Maya Turovskaya observes, his “spiritual baggage was acquired during his none-toohappy childhood, and was little affected by subsequent external influences.”56 To this we may add that his childhood influenced his later life mainly in\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 26\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nTA R K O V S K Y ’ S C H I L D H O O D\n\n27\n\nterms of stressing the development of such seemingly contradictory character traits as recalcitrance and victim mentality, both of which stemmed from his strained relationship with his mother and which, in turn, became constituent in the individualization of his semi-autobiographical protagonists. As shown above, in light of Green’s psychoanalytic findings, it would not be a far-fetched assumption to suggest that after his father’s desertion, Tarkovsky’s relationship with his mother may have suffered an irreparable rift because of her subsequent emotional withdrawal, which the young Andrei attempted to overcome by alienating himself from her, while fostering his own autonomy within the realm of imagination and thought. Andrei’s early estrangement from his mother resulted in his systematic disobedience to her will, which later solidified in his constant desire for transgression that manifested itself in virtually all aspects of his social behavior: hanging out with street delinquents, skipping classes in school, getting married before graduation, getting lost in the taiga, dressing up as stilyaga (i.e. as a member of the Soviet youth counterculture in the 1950s), being rejected by the Komsomol (i.e. the youth division of the Communist Party), and rebelling against the Soviet status quo, fiercely defending his films from any censorship cuts, and, eventually, leaving the Soviet Union. Tarkovsky’s persistent recalcitrance against social norms and traditions, developed from his adolescent defiance of the mother’s authority, was always accompanied by his parallel devotion to a higher, almost divine, law of art, which he associated with his father’s rigorous commitment to poetry. And so, stuck between an emotionally withdrawn mother and a physically inaccessible father, Tarkovsky still longed for the intimacy of parental love, while perceiving himself as the victim of his unresolved family drama, which he painstakingly attempted to repair in his cinematic fantasies. As his father told him through tears after the premiere of Mirror: “Andryusha, was it really like this? I didn’t think you took to heart so much.”57 Tarkovsky’s acute sense of victimhood was not attached exclusively to the familial context. In his later features it acquired a theological dimension that added a messianic component to his characters. By honing them into self-styled martyrs, rejected by society yet driven by transcendental aspirations, and foregrounding the Christian motif of sacrifice, he thus sublimated his personal traumas into the romantic myth of an artist-savior.

Phonetically consonant and etymologically derived from the same Russian root tra- (or protoSlavic ter-), these words make up a coherent cluster of signifiers (trava-travlyatrata) that are centered (and circling) around Tarkovsky’s primal fantasy of the house, a cinematic motif in his work which metaphorically stands for the maternal womb (e.g. the Zone and “the room of desire” soaked with water in Stalker (1979)). In real life this cinematic motif of the house is paralleled by his lifelong obsession with living in a country house surrounded by grass (trava), which he viewed as a refuge to hide from the Goskino officials’ persecution (travlya). At the same time, he was also preoccupied with all kinds of expenses (trata) which would prevent him from getting settled there. I will demonstrate that Lacan’s model of signifying chains, which establishes symbolic trajectories of representations— that maintain their distance from the Real (das Ding) and thus predetermine their modes of associations and displacements of affects—allows us to grasp the symbolic mechanisms underlying Tarkovsky’s artistic imaginary. As I will argue, in Tarkovsky’s diary the signifying constellation trava-travlya-trata presents itself as a psychobiographical code to the internal dynamics of his visual imagery. T H E H O U S E T H AT A N D R E I B U I LT\n\nThe house occupies a central place in Tarkovsky’s biography by serving as the pivotal point around which his domestic and professional activities always\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 30\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nTA R K O V S K Y ’ S P S Y C H O B I O G R A P H Y\n\n31\n\nrevolved. In his memories it is represented by various locations: first, as the place of birth in 1932 in the village of Zavrazhye in the Yurievets district and later as a hideout from the war during evacuation to the town of Yurievets in the Ivanovo Region in 1941–3. Between them lies Pavel Gorchakov’s farmstead near the village of Ignatievo where Andrei and his sister Marina spent their happy summers in 1935–6. As he recalls about this period, “Happiness is tied to my childhood. The time when my mother and I lived in a steading near Moscow I remember as that of enormous happiness. It was a very happy time for me because I was still a child, connected with nature, and we lived in the woods. I felt completely happy. I did not feel anything like that later on.”1 The persistent repetition of the word “happy” in this passage points to the fact that at the moment of this recollection Tarkovsky as an adult was, on the contrary, quite unhappy and could remember his childhood only in terms of the lost happiness, whose toponymical particles were nostalgically projected into the names of his cinematic characters, such as Ignat from Mirror (1975) or Gorchakov from Nostalghia (1983). In his grown-up life, however, the house for Tarkovsky was associated with nothing but problems. In fact, it is with the purchase of a house in the village of Myasnoye in 1970 that he started his famous diary titled “martyrology,” which he decided to keep to record his hardships in everyday and professional life. Almost immediately the house purchase turned out to be a black hole in Tarkovsky’s family budget. As he writes in an entry of 20 October 1970, “Our house in Myasnoye burned down. The entire middle part is gone . . . Everything should be rebuilt in the Spring, as we wanted earlier. It will cost three thousand rubles. Will see. In any case, reconstruction should be complete by the Summer.”2 Tarkovsky’s preoccupations with home renovations became, therefore, the recurrent subject of his diary entries. The house was literally swallowing up his income, time, and even his wife: he personally had to do a lot of housework, just as Larisa Tarkovskaya worked there for weeks when Tarkovsky stayed in the city. And yet, despite getting mired in debts, he stubbornly clung to the idea of building his own house which, he thought, could bring “some sense” to his life. Along with his plans to rebuild the house, the diary is full of lists of items necessary for reconstruction as well as corresponding costs for them. Instead of serving him as a refuge from the stress at work, the house required increasing investments without the relief of ever getting any closer to its completion. Even after immigration Tarkovsky continued to pursue his obsession with houses. In Italy he bought an old two-story cottage in the town of San Gregorio, which also required major repairs and thus threatened to become yet another black hole for his income. Until his final days he kept designing layouts for this house and never abandoned his plans to reconstruct it. In his films—from Solaris (1972) to The Sacrifice (1986)—Tarkovsky steadily reincarnates various models of his childhood house. For Mirror, for example, in 1973 he built a replica of Gorchakov’s log cabin (which was dismantled long ago)\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 31\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n32\n\nANDREI GORNYKH\n\nFigure 2.1 Replica of Tarkovsky’s childhood house in Mirror.\n\nin the village of Ignatyevo by following the exact same dimensions of its exterior and interior. Even his mother, during her visit to Mirror’s set, was struck by the uncanny resurrection of the original (Figure 2.1). These mimetic replicas, however, serve only as the façade appearances of Tarkovsky’s imagination of the house, behind which the unsettling drama of a dysfunctional family takes place: from Stalker’s utter neglect of home maintenance resulting in the alienation of domestic space, to the invasion of ghosts into the grief-stricken house in Solaris. Tarkovsky’s houses are always flooded with water: in Solaris rain comes in through the roof; in Mirror, likewise, water bursts through the ceiling with pieces of plaster crumbling and falling in slow motion; in Stalker water leaks through the walls, shimmers through the large floor cracks, and keeps trickling in from above. As Evgeniy Tsymbal recalls, Tarkovsky was trying to achieve the “mucus-like appearance of the slimy walls in Stalker’s bedroom by covering them with varnish, while the kitchen and the hall were coated with glistening greasy graphite.”3 The watery nature of Tarkovsky’s cinematic house manifests itself to the fullest as an abandoned half-ruined dwelling with the room fulfilling unconscious desires, placed inside the deserted and derelict landscape of the Zone. The walls here could be interpreted as representing the maternal membranes enclosing the womb flooded with amniotic waters, which resonates with Mirror’s dream sequence, where streams of water from the ceiling merge with the mother’s long hair being washed in the basin.\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 32\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nTA R K O V S K Y ’ S P S Y C H O B I O G R A P H Y\n\n33\n\nD A S D I N G A N D T H E I N S TA N C E O F T H E L E T T E R\n\nTarkovsky’s house as the locus of the impersonal maternal Thing at its core may serve as the perfect illustration of what Freud calls the uncanny, or unheimlich, which refers to “that class of the terrifying that leads back to something long known to us, once very familiar.”4 The German term unheimlich is, for Freud, the opposite of cozy and comfortable, and is at the same time hidden and secret, best left unseen. As Freud explains, the meaning of the word heimlich “develops in the direction of ambivalence, until it finally coincides with its opposite, unheimlich.”5 That is, the unheimlich experience, in which the terrifying affect is produced by what seems to be most attractive, is characterized by radical ambivalence, best exemplified by the figure of the mother. Whereas initially she serves as the primary object of the child’s desire, after the resolution of the Oedipus complex and the child’s internalization of the Law-of-the-Father, she becomes fundamentally unattainable and any attempt to get back to the maternal space inevitably turns that space into something unbearable and hostile. Compulsive repetition constitutes the essence of one’s relation to the maternal. To further develop the Freudian approach to the nature of desire, Lacan introduced the notion of das Ding (the Thing), referring to the Kantian thing-in-itself, understood as ultimately inaccessible and unknowable yet exciting and affecting the soul: “Right at the beginning of the organization of the world in the psyche, both logically and chronologically, das Ding is something that presents and isolates itself as the strange feature around which the whole movement of the Vorstellung turns.”6 According to Freud, Vorstellung stands for representations or mental images in which sensations, recollections, and expectations interweave. In Lacan’s reading, our representations do not unfold in linear time but revolve around das Ding as some invisible gravity center. Their meaning is constituted not so much by their content as by their movement of re-presenting (Vor-stellung), while always keeping das Ding at a distance as the eternally absent sought-after object. As Lacan writes, The transference of the quantity [of psychic energy] from Vorstellung to Vorstellung always maintains the search at a certain distance from that which it gravitates around. The object to be found confers on the search its invisible law; but it is not that . . . which controls its movements. The element that fixes these movements, that models the return—and this return itself is maintained at a distance—is the pleasure principle.7 Finally, in one’s compulsive repetition to approach das Ding, what one finds is not das Ding but representations that function not so much as image but rather as “associative,” “combinatorial” elements or “constellations of representations.”\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 33\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\n34\n\nANDREI GORNYKH\n\nAs Lacan argues, “these Vorstellungen gravitate, operate exchanges and are modulated according to . . . the fundamental laws of the signifying chain.”8 The basic laws of the signifying chain were already discovered by Freud as that of displacement and condensation. In Interpretation of Dreams (1899), the material for such operations is provided not only by dream images and hidden thoughts but by words as well. As he writes, The condensing activity of the dream becomes most tangible when it has selected words and names as its object. In general, words are often treated as things by the dream, and thus undergo the same combinations, displacements, and substitutions, and therefore also condensations, as ideas of things. The results of such dreams are comical and bizarre word formations.9 For example, Freud continues, one of his patients had a dream about a nonexistent verbal compound “Maistollmutz” which, after analysis, turned out to be a condensed constellation of various words referring to different affectively charged representations: Mais, Meissen, miss, toll, mannstol, Olmutz. For Lacan, this is the essence of Freud’s discovery: it is precisely the words, or the “instance of the letter,” that should count as the formal elements, or “signifiers,” which, through their combinations, lay out the channels for psychic energy and determine associative series of representations as well as their trajectories around das Ding. As he argues, “The space of the signifier, the space of the unconscious, is effectively a typographical space, which we must try to define as being constituted along lines and little squares, and as corresponding to topological laws.”10 That is to say, it is the correlations of words in which letters, not only meanings, blend with each other, that regulate the dynamics of the transition of one representation into another, as well as the intensity of their affective charge.

The first component of this cluster is the word trava or “grass” that functions in Tarkovsky’s imagery as a phantasmatic enclosure around the Thing. In Tarkovsky’s memories, his mother, Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, always remained a guardian and caretaker: she kept him and his sister Marina in a rural house in Zavrazhye near Yuryevets away from the traumatic events of the 1930s and 1940s, such as the stress of living in a Moscow communal apartment, the war, and the famine. While hiding her children in a quiet abode in the countryside, she exposed them to the beauty and serenity of nature by taking\n\n6616_Toymentsev.indd 34\n\n12/01/21 11:21 AM\n\nTA R K O V S K Y ’ S P S Y C H O B I O G R A P H Y\n\n35\n\nthem for long walks in the woods and meadows where they could pick strawberries and even stay overnight in a self-made shelter. When his mother passed away in 1979, Tarkovsky experienced her death as an ontological catastrophe, throwing him into a deep emotional crisis. As he writes in his diary, “Mama’s funeral. It was in Vostryakovsky Cemetery. Now I feel quite defenseless; and no one in the world is ever going to love me as she did . . . God! how utterly wretched I feel! To the point of nausea, to the point of hanging myself. I am so lonely . . . I am afraid to be alone. I do not want to live. I am frightened. My life has become intolerable.”11 Even years after her death he continued to remember her as his beloved guardian. As he writes in an entry of 10 July 1981, I went to the cemetery today, to Mama’s gr"
