        "text": "Barbie and The Three Musketeers is the 16th Barbie movie. It was released on September 15, 2009, and it made its TV premiere on Nickelodeon on November 22, 2009.[1] It is based on the novel The Three Musketeers by Alexander Dumas. It is the last Barbie movie to be based on the plot of classic literature, a ballet, or a fairytale.\n\nOfficial Summary[]\n\nJoin Barbie as Corinne, a young country girl headed to Paris to pursue her big dream – to become a female musketeer! Never could she imagine she would meet three other girls who secretly share the same dream! Using their special talents, the girls work together as a team to foil a plot and save the prince. Come along on an action-filled adventure that dares you to dream as never before.\n\nStory[]\n\nIn 17th-century France, Corinne, a spirited seventeen-year-old girl portrayed by Barbie, resides on a quaint farm with her mother. Inspired by the legendary tales of her father, D'Artagnan, a renowned Musketeer, Corinne harbors a fervent dream of following in his footsteps. Alongside her, Miette, her playful kitten with aspirations of becoming a \"mus-cat-eer,\" adds a touch of whimsy to their shared ambition.\n\nTheir journey to Paris, the bustling heart of France, brims with anticipation. However, the grandeur of the capital quickly gives way to the harsh realities of ridicule and skepticism. Philippe, the cunning cousin and advisor to Prince Louis, emerges as a formidable adversary, his disdain mirrored by his mischievous dog, Brutus. A misadventure involving Brutus and a crucial letter destined for Monsieur Treville serves as an initial setback, yet it leads Corinne to Madame de Bossé and her eventual role as a palace maid.\n\nWithin the opulent confines of Prince Louis' palace, Corinne's path intertwines with Viveca, Aramina, and Renée, portrayed by Summer, Teresa, and Nikki respectively. Their initial apprehensions and misunderstandings evolve into a profound bond, solidifying their alliance in pursuit of a shared dream. The discovery of a sabotaged chandelier, coupled with a mysterious gem and a clandestine encounter with the enigmatic elderly maid, Helen, unveils a hidden musketeer training room. Under Hélène's expert tutelage, the quartet transforms into formidable musketeers, honing their skills and fortifying their resolve.\n\nAmidst the backdrop of burgeoning romance and political intrigue, as Corinne and Prince Louis' affections blossom, a shadow of treachery looms large. Phillippe's nefarious machinations, including a perilous hot-air balloon incident and a sinister plot to assassinate Prince Louis at the masquerade ball, propel the narrative toward a thrilling crescendo.\n\nThe masquerade ball emerges as a pivotal juncture, a dazzling tableau of suspense, romance, and heroism. Disguised beneath masks, Corinne and her friends navigate a treacherous labyrinth of deception and danger, culminating in a dramatic confrontation with Phillippe and his malevolent cohorts.\n\nThe narrative reaches its triumphant zenith with the arrest of the conspirators and the proclamation of Corinne, Viveca, Aramina, and Renee as royal musketeers. Their valor and camaraderie echo through the corridors of history, immortalized by the iconic proclamation, \"All for one, and One for all!\"\n\nAs the tale draws to a close, Corinne and her intrepid companions, poised for their next adventure, exemplify the transformative power of dreams, friendship, and courage. Their odyssey from humble beginnings to revered musketeers serves as a timeless testament to the indomitable spirit of adventure that resides within us all, a beacon of hope and inspiration that transcends the boundaries of time.\n\nStarring the Voices Of[]\n\nBarbie as Corinne: Kelly Sheridan\n\nPhilippe: Tim Curry\n\nTeresa as Viveca: Kira Tozer\n\nSummer as Aramina: Willow Johnson\n\nNikki as Renée: Dorla Bell\n\nCorinne's Mother: Nicole Oliver\n\nMadame de Bossé: Merrilyn Gann\n\nHélène: Kathleen Barr\n\nPrince Louis: Mark Hildreth\n\nBertram: Michael Dobson\n\nMonsieur Treville: Bernard Cuffling\n\nSerge: Brad Swaile\n\nMiette: Amelia Henderson\n\nMiette Walla: Tabitha St. Germain\n\nBrutus: Brian Dobson\n\nAlexander: David Kaye\n\nPig: Terry Klassen\n\nMusketeer #1: Alistair Abell\n\nMusketeer #2: Brian Drummond\n\nMusketeer Guard: Michael Dobson\n\nRegent Guard #1: Terry Klassen\n\nRegent Guard #2: Brian Dobson\n\nHenchmen: Terry Klassen\n\nDriver: David Kaye\n\nRoyal Announcer: Alistair Abell\n\nHandsome Man: Brad Swaile\n\nFancy Dress Girl #1: Nicole Oliver\n\nFancy Dress Girl #2: Kathleen Barr\n\nLocations[]\n\nParis, France\n\nCorinne's Farm\n\nPrince Louis's Palace\n\nMusic[]\n\nThe music in Barbie and The Three Musketeers was composed by Eric Colvin.

However, there's a picture of the previous movie to use the new Barbie font. While The Barbie Diaries had a different font, the next film would go back to the original font.\n\nThis is the first Barbie movie starring all Barbie's friends: Teresa, Nikki and Summer.\n\nAlthough Summer had starred in Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus, Teresa starred in Barbie in the Diamond Castle and Nikki starred in Barbie in A Christmas Carol.\n\nAllusions to the original story[]\n\nWhile speaking to Trèville, Corinne says her father's name is D'Artagnan. D'Artagnan is one of the protagonists in the original novel.\n\nLike the hot-blooded D'Artagnan, Corinne is shown as a brave and feisty young woman who gets angry when people tell her that girls can’t be Musketeers.\n\nAlexander, Corinne's horse, is a nod to the author of the Three Musketeers novel, Alexandre Dumas.\n\nWhen the other girls invited Corinne to stay with them, Viveca mentions that their former roommate was Constance. In the novel, Constance Bonacieux is the woman that D'Artagnan falls in love with.\n\nOne of the guests at the masquerade ball is introduced as the Countess de Winter. She is named after Milady de Winter, one of the antagonists from the original story.\n\nMonsieur Trèville, the captain of the Musketeers in the film, is named after the captain in the original story, Monsieur de Trèville.\n\nThe part when Corinne accidentally falls on each of three girls and makes them angry is similar to the part in the novel when D'Artagnan accidentally ends up falling into each of the Musketeers and making them challenge him to the duel.\n\nCorinne’s hometown is Gascony, which is the name of D’Artagnan’s family estate in the novel.\n\nPrince Louis is named after King Louis XIII from the novel.\n\nThe famous fleur-de-lis, which was branded on the villainess Milady de Winter in the story, is on the fronts of the tunics worn by the Musketeers in the film.\n\nAramina and Renée are named after René Aramis, one of the original novel's protagonists.\n\nParis, which is France’s capital city and the center location of the original story, is also the location for the film.\n\nIn the original novel, D'Artagnan's father gives him a pony. In the film, Corinne's mom gives her 15 crowns and the horse, just like in the novel.\n\nGoofs[]\n\nCorinne, Viveca, Aramina and Renée wear pumps for the Masquerade Ball, though when they transform into musketeers, they're wearing boots.\n\nWhen Aramina transforms into musketeer, the gem in the middle of her necklace is missing.\n\nWhen Renée is shown playing the violin at the beginning of the movie (before she falls in the fountain), you can see that the sound holes on the violin are too far down.\n\nWhen Corinne first arrives at the ball, she has her hair down. However, it suddenly becomes a bun when she changes into her musketeer outfit.\n\nAlso Known As[]\n\nGerman - Barbie und die drei Musketiere\n\nItalian - Barbie e le Tre Moschettiere\n\nSpanish - Barbie y los Tres Mosqueteros\n\nCroatian - Barbie i tri mušketira\n\nHungarian - Barbie és a Három Muskétás\n\nAlbanian - Barbie dhe Tri Musketieret\n\nGreek - Μπάρμπι και οι Τρεις Σωματοφύλακες\n\nRussian - Барби и Три Мушкетера\n\nPolish - Barbie i Trzy Muszkieterki\n\nFinnish - Barbie ja Kolme muskettisoturia\n\nSwedish - Barbie och de Tre Musketörerna\n\nFrench - Barbie et les Trois Mousquetaires\n\nTurkish - Barbie ve Üç Silahşörler\n\nDutch - Barbie en de Drie Musketiers\n\nPersian - باربی و سه تفنگدار\n\nGeorgian - ბარბი და სამი მუშკეტერი\n\nHebrew - ברבי ושלושת המוסקטרים\n\nJapanese - バービーの三銃士\n\nChinese - 芭比公主三剑客\n\n[]"
