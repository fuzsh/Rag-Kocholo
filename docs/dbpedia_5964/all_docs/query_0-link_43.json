Other kinds of “Responsibilities”: The Bolsheviks demand, “Have you volunteered?” to fight on their side in the Russian Civil War.\n\nPreface: Responsibilities\n\nI am not a film critic, though I have written a lot on Russian films. Neither am I a film-studies academic, though I have spent my adult life teaching in academia. In my articles and reviews you won’t find the specialized jargon and post-modern vocabulary that spackles the prose of critics and scholars—no conceits, discourses, situatings; no reifications or oneirics, please. The inimitable writer and critic James Agee explained to his readers what qualified him to write on film. He was, he told them, “in your own situation: deeply interested in moving pictures, considerably experienced from childhood in watching them and thinking and talking about them….” Same here. Richard Schickel, another fine writer and critic of a later generation, called for more than “idle opinion-mongering” in reviewing films or other creative works; there has to be a “sense of responsibility” on the part of the critic, who must do “justice to the work at hand and to the culture in which it appeared.” Here is James Agee again, on a different kind of “responsibility”: Of John Huston’s “pictures” he wrote that they “are not acts of seduction or of benign enslavement but of liberation, and they require, of anyone who enjoys them, the responsibilities of liberty. They continually open the eye and require it to work vigorously; and through the eye they awaken curiosity and intelligence.” He might just as well have been writing of all good art and entertainment, not just John Huston’s. To those responsibilities must be added another when it comes to Russian and Soviet films (not fluency in the Russian language, though that would be very helpful). Film goers of a certain age will\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nalways identify Russian films with the Soviet Union, even long after the demise of the USSR. (I have friends who still say Soviet when they mean Russian.) If Soviet cinema was conceived and organized around a definite political purpose—not necessarily by the filmmakers, but by the State that financed them—then viewers and critics have the “responsibility” to learn something of the political or historical back-story behind the films. For Soviet films, viewers in the West inevitably brought strong, pre-formed ideas and prejudices to the theater. These were pro or contra, rarely neutral, to what used to be called “the Soviet experiment,” and to the character and intentions of the USSR. A bit of tempering of any hard and fixed attitudes from either perspective was not a bad thing. One of the reasons I introduced films in my classes on Soviet history (a time when, I admit, I held strong views of my own that were very sympathetic to Moscow) was to show students who were reared in the culture of the Cold War, with its images of Big Brother totalitarianism, that there were other sides to Soviet life that undermined the imagery. The films I showed communicated a different, benign story instead. “See!,” the films would reveal, “Russians and Georgians and Ukrainians are just like us—working, loving, laughing, crying, going about the business of getting on with their lives with a hope we all shared, that of living in peace on our thermonuclear endangered planet.” But wait. Yes, those folks in the films were just like us, but they lived their real, non-celluloid lives within patterns that weren’t up on the screen. Certain features of Soviet society were either lacquered heavily, or bypassed completely. Aspects of Soviet reality, whether pictured in daily life of the time, or in representations of the past in war and peace, came through in the films, but taboo after taboo handed down from above or internalized by the filmmakers themselves masked too much of that reality. The task of the “responsible” critic or film historian whose specialty was the Soviet Union was to peel away the masks and lead the “responsible” viewer to a clearer, more truthful understanding of what was going on over there: My job. In other words, when it comes to Soviet cinema, a cigar is never just a cigar: a Soviet film was never just a movie. There were always political nuances that informed the films overtly or beneath the\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nsurface, and there were political attitudes held by the audiences that went to see them. Naturally, post-Soviet films may have a politics as well, and demand care with background and context too, but those old, very Soviet political and ideological overtones identifying all art and entertainment from the USSR, films included, are gone. From lecturing about the films I showed in my classes on Russian and Soviet history, and discussing them with my students, I went a step further and began writing and publishing articles and reviews about those and other films. I also took part in several film projects about Soviet Russia, most notably as Associate Producer for two award-winning PBS documentaries, In the Shadow of Sakharov and Inside Gorbachev’s USSR. (See my essay, “Historians of the USSR Cross Over into Filmmaking,” in chapter IV, below.) My scholarly interest in the USSR began with a socialist edge, although reading Chekhov and Turgenev as a teenager also had something to do with my romance with the Russians. For an earlier me, the Russian Motherland was the Soviet Russian Motherland of Socialism that would help open our own paths to revolution and utopia in the West. When disillusion set in, a process that started with my first trips to the Motherland in the 1960s and climaxed with the failures of Gorbachev’s glasnost and perestroika to put a human face on Soviet socialism, I turned more and more away from political concerns as such and retreated—advanced?—into the precincts of art, particularly film art. The emphasis on art is not amiss here. Soviet filmmakers in general, even without the promptings of the kino bosses, rarely conceived their work simply as entertainment; there was always a certain high-mindedness among them, as befitted the traditions of the Russian cultural intelligentsia. The shifts in my personal and professional perspectives resulted in the materials assembled in this collection, a kind of commonplace book of reviews, interviews, reports, journal entries, long essays and short takes, written over a span of three decades, from the last years of the Soviet Union to the first years of the Former Soviet Union. Most of the writing was published in diverse magazines and periodicals, especially in Cineaste, which rightly describes itself as “America’s leading magazine on the art and politics of the cinema,” and to whose founder and Editor-in-Chief, Gary Crowdus, and his team of editors, I owe much gratitude for making their pages available to my critical views.\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\nThe work here will naturally interest the specialist, whether in film or Russian studies, though there is likely to be small and large disagreements over my presentations and interpretations, but I hope the non-specialist film lover will find them appealing enough to awaken a taste, if not already there, for watching and understanding Russians through their cinema.\n\nA Note on Contents\n\nMost of the articles and reviews that follow look at films with Russian or Soviet themes made by Russian or Soviet filmmakers. But I have also included reviews of films about those subjects by nonRussian, non-Soviet directors from abroad. The fascination foreigners have had with Russia, the Russian soul, or with Soviet history and its wayward paths, crisscrossed by trauma and triumph, is an enduring fact of modern times, and has found a place in filmmaking from different lands.1 It deserves some attention here. Reviews are indicated by the name of the film in italics in the Table of Contents, while titles of articles, essays and review-essays are in roman face. All of the materials in this volume appear as originally published or presented, with only minor, primarily cosmetic or clarifying changes. Sources are indicated throughout. Since this is not a work of reference I have done very little updating, mainly changing a tense here and there, or noting the demise of a film figure. Some repetition and duplication is inevitable in a collection of this kind; my apologies. Thus, for example, Askoldov and his Commissar turn up in varying guises: in an interview (Chapter VII); in reviews (Chapter II, 2); and in several places in the historical essays.\n\nHollywood’s affair with Russians and Russian themes is deftly examined by Harlow Robinson in his Russians in Hollywood, Hollywood’s Russians: Biography of an Image (Boston: Northeastern University Press, and Hanover, N.H. and London: University Press of New England, 2007). See also my review, Cineaste, XXXIII, 4, 2008. 1\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am grateful to the following publications and publishers for reprinting permissions (full citations appear in the text): Documentary (formerly International Documentary); Cambridge University Press, publisher of International Labor and Working-Class History; Wiley, publisher of The Russian Review; Slavonica; Commonweal; University of California Press, publisher of Film Quarterly; Tikkun; Cengage Learning, Inc. I owe a particular debt to Cineaste, where most of the reviews, articles and short takes in this volume originally appeared. I’m fortunate to have received support and encouragement from its Founder and Editor-in-Chief, Gary Crowdus, along with Editors Dan Georgakas, Cynthia Lucia and Richard Porton—themselves contributors par excellence to film criticism and film history. Gary is ever Mr. Reliable, no matter how busy, who always follows through with help when asked. My thanks also go to Dr. Jeffrey B. Rubin, who planted the idea of a book; to Anna Lawton who proposed doing the book for New Academia, and whose talents as a publisher, film scholar, and novelist are matched by personal warmth and fine humor; to Gail Sinai, who got me started on the task of scanning and collating the materials that make up this collection; to Louis Evans and Laura Ciporen for their technical wizardry around the computer—I much valued their skills in formatting, etc., but it was also a pleasure working with them; to Helmut Gruber, who introduced the “Politics and Film” courses at Polytechnic; to Fred Ciporen, BP, for advice on some of the arcane ways of the publishing world, and for challenging opinions on film art; to Masha Godovannaya of St. Petersburg, always ready to answer whatever query I might\n\nxx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nsend her way; to Anne Borin of New York, who helped connect me more closely with Russian/Soviet films and filmmakers back in the 1980s, and has remained an ever resourceful friend since; to Oleg Smirnoff, who I met on a Moscow tennis court in 1984, and who eventually came to New York where I regularly pepper him with questions of Russian language and contemporary culture; to the remarkable blues guitarist, Danny Kalb, who took an interest in my writing, and kept prodding me to produce; to Julia Arkhipova, now of New York, but once an excellent guide around her city, St. Petersburg, and its film festivals; to my friend, the writer and film critic, Leonard Quart, who always enriches our conversations on cinema and life; to Rubye Monet, for keeping me informed about Russian films on Paris screens; to my friend, the economist David Mermelstein, who values lay opinions as much as critics’ views when talking about films; to Allis and Ronald Radosh, with whom I like to discuss movies, even as we disagree about political matters; to my friends Renée and Simon Dinnerstein, cinema buffs both, with whom I have shared many a discussion of Russia and Russian films. And thanks, too, to other non-professional cinephiles in my circle: brother Bob Menashe, Jan Rosenberg, Fred Siegel, Sima Szaluta, Mort Weiner, Elayne Archer, Manuela Dobos, the late Artyom Englin and cousins Jack Zaraya and Wendy Sabin. I am also very grateful to Birgit Beumers for her sharp editorial eye in matters of Russian film and filmmakers. Sheila Menashe, always my first, critical reader, gets my very special, very big message of appreciation and affection. I’m glad my daughter Claudia, her husband, John Anderson, and my son, David, are film enthusiasts and I’m grateful for their attention to dad’s writing.\n\nPrologue\n\nRussian films aren’t what they used to be. Ask any filmgoer of that certain age mentioned above about Russian cinema, and the response is likely to include classics like Potemkin and Ballad of a Soldier. Such films earned attention and praise for political significance as well as artistic merit. Ask filmgoers of less than that certain age, and the response is likely to be a blank. How is it that the cinema of Eisenstein and Chukhrai, which once drew accolades from critics and public alike in the global theater, has not been, with some exceptions, followed by comparable successes? It’s a long story. It involves a political and cultural history that spanned several decades and several upheavals, from the age of Stalin to the age of Putin. That story won’t be told here in simple narrative form, but by examining films from and about those eras we can sketch a picture of development and underdevelopment for Russian cinema and for the society out of which it emerged. The materials collected in this volume don’t comprise film criticism in the usual sense, nor do they constitute history as such, but they draw on both realms and together help us locate the place and value of Russian cinema in modern times.\n\nCHAPTER I I Found It at the Movies: Kinojournal, 1991-2004 The great American film critic, Pauline Kael, “lost it at the movies” (the title for her book of dazzling reviews and essays has multiple shades of meaning).1 You might say, in my case, I found it at the movies—“it” being a rewarding way to illuminate Russian/Soviet life, culture and history; “movies” being, of course, the Russian/Soviet films themselves. From time to time, I tried keeping a journal of what I saw, making entries right after viewing. Some of these unbuttoned reactions are offered, unchanged, here, except for spelling and other like minor corrections. Programmers at different venues in New York—The Museum of Modern Art, the Film Society of Lincoln Center, and elsewhere—enjoyed a bounty of new films coming out or conceived during perestroika and after, and I always hurried to catch them there, or at press screenings. I’ve indicated location and date of screening (not the film’s production date), just as they appeared in my Kinojournal.\n\nI Lost it at the Movies: Film Writings 1954 to 1965 (Boston: Little Brown & Company, 1965).\n\n1\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n3\n\n2. Continued coast-to-coast media and festival enthusiasm for the glasnost films that arrived after the collapse of the USSR. The San Francisco Chronicle reports on films by Lidiya Bobrova and Dmitry Astrakhan, April 26, 1992. I saw them in New York around the same time.\n\nPassport: A Film by Georgi Danelia 6/19/91, Museum of Modern Art\n\nI winced when it was announced that this was an Austrian-IsraeliFrench co-production. It showed: what a mess. Later Danelia told the audience the film was shot in ten days. That showed too. Everyone was wooden, everything weighed a ton, though the string of comic situations the film consisted of should have, on the face of it, been hilarious. Danelia later said the film was not a comedy but a “tragedy.” It ends sadly, with people the victims of a world divided by borders.\n\n4\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nAnother problem: the film is overdubbed in Russian, so the usual Babel the result. Also, the English titles amusingly wrong; Jew appears often as Few. D. said he conceived the film five years ago, but then it “was impossible to even utter the word Israel.” Two Georgian halfbrothers look like twins; one is Yakov, the other is Merab, i.e., one the son of a Jewish, the other of a Georgian mother. Yakov therefore entitled to emigrate to Israel with his wife and daughter, angering his Georgian father. At the airport Merab wants to celebrate with champagne, but since there is no alcohol at the regular counters, he gets into the duty-free area by borrowing his brother’s ticket, passport, and visa. He gets the champagne but of course he can’t get back into the airport and flies to Vienna. Query: how come the crew which is expecting him doesn’t ask about the wife and daughter? But credibility is not one of the film’s strong points. In Vienna he is put off by Soviet bureaucracy (Yevgeny Leonov plays a consular official in a wonderful cameo.) Along the way he picks up a Russian friend (Oleg Yankovsky), who hustles everywhere. E.G., he presents an American tourist with a balalaika at the airport, but reclaims it on the plane out of “nostalgia”. In Vienna he pries it open to reveal stacks of dollars. Yankovsky turns up wherever Merab is, involved in one scheme or another. Last seen in an Arab headdress with a millionairess rug merchant in Jordan. All sorts of characters appear—cousins in Israel, an American journalist, Georgian compatriots—in situation after situation, all unfunny, except for some anti-Soviet digs, as when he calls Tbilisi from Austria and is told to bring condoms and #10 screws, or when he’s told to make a case of victimization, then worldwide Jewry will come to his defense through the UN, the Voice of America, etc., or when there’s a discussion about declaring gold teeth. The serious theme is that this is all a commentary on a world divided by borders protected by armed guards who send you to jail (he experiences them in the USSR, Israel, Jordan, and Austria). The film opens, inexplicably, with Merab laying a rose on the grave of a woman named Klein in Omsk. The conclusion of the film reveals the secret: Merab is taken across the Israeli-Jordan border by a hard-drinking Red Army veteran of WW II, the émigré Klein— who is killed by a land mine (in slow-mo). From comedy, bathos.\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n5\n\n“Maybe we’ll meet in another world where there are no borders,” Klein had told him. As he crosses into Jordan Merab cries, “Don’t shoot me, brothers!” Danelia speaks of a specific Georgian sense of humor. It was there alright, but smothered by cheap comic situations.\n\nComrade Stalin Goes to Africa: A Film by Irakli Kvirikadze 7/16/91, Museum of Modern Art\n\nAnother absurdist Georgian comedy, not very good. A nice idea: a tale of preparing a Stalin look-alike to stand in for the dictator. Stalin can’t bear sitting through boring ceremonial events, so he orders an occasional substitute. (I forget what the Africa in the title refers to; something Stalin said about some woman in Africa, vaguely salacious.) The NKVD locates a look-alike, a Georgian Jew (the bosses are assured his name Pikhchadze can be Georgian too) who has a fabulous memory, hence can repeat Stalin’s speeches word for word. (Is he the wonderful guy who plays Motyl in IZ IDI?) We are told—the NKVD knows everything—that he is impotent with his wife, but has a mistress named Fanya Kaplan. He is trained in some abandoned mansion where he has to relieve himself outdoors, and where the crew chief is always screwing his secretary, both fully clothed. What kills what could be a mordant piece of work? Filmic shenanigans, basically. The usual alternations, b/w and color; selfreferences (the film opens with the narrator telling us the home movie we are watching shows us the director of the film shooting himself); lots of home movies; documentary intercuts—as usual for me the most fascinating part because they show shots of Stalin and the entourage I’ve never seen; here I spotted the young Kosygin and the young Suslov, and Mao himself; intercuts of US scenes like the Brooklyn Bridge and Broadway at night with Presley’s “Jailhouse Rock” on the soundtrack [Nana Djordjadze, Kvirikadze’s wife, explained to the audience that America was always a dream for all Soviets and there’s irony here because it’s Africa not America(?)];\n\n6\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\ndisjointedness as a principle; shots repeated; and other such juvenilia. As in the Danelia film, the comedy suddenly turns grim when Stalin dies and a prikaz comes down to eliminate the double. Shoot yourself they tell him but he asks, why not let me go? (I think they shoot him.) There is something here—Stalinism was an absurdity, and it’s good to be able to poke fun at its bizarre pretenses. But this amateurish treatment doesn’t do the possibilities justice. At work again— busting loose from the old restrictions: sex, free form, mocking the icons. But all so flat….\n\nBlack Rose the Emblem of Sorrow, Red Rose the Emblem of Love: A Film by Sergei Soloviev 8/20/91, Museum of Modern Art\n\nAnother infuriatingly disappointing glasnost film by the maker of the popular ASSA, all the more disappointing because this has been touted as a supremely rich talented effort. There may be talent somewhere, there is vitality certainly, but the excess of everything— of costumes, of tired sight gags, of self-conscious, sophomoric absurdities (meaningless and uninteresting intercuts, directions to the audience, titles in several languages), of film-school camera tricks, and absence of real wit and subtlety make of this another boring effort to shock and break loose from the old conventions. Someone said the typical glasnost film is a nude woman smoking grass gazing at a portrait of Stalin. Yep, that’s Black Rose… The “story”: A young woman is nailed into an empty flat by her father to make her study for exams. She lets herself out by the window, enters the apartment of an adolescent boy who shares it with a kooky but good layabout, calls her boyfriend, who comes over. (Example of excess: she can’t just escape, she has to do it in an elaborate naval uniform with a fancy straw hat, net gloves, and what else I can’t remember. It reminds me of that whacky loft soirée of the Russian émigrés I went to a few years ago.) From then on it’s absurdist mayhem with no particular logic or feeling. (Well maybe\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n7\n\nthe boy Mitya evokes some affection with his dreamy sensitive looks and kindness.) In the course of things a rock band appears, mama and papa appear, as does Mitya’s guardian from Luber (translated as “the suburbs”), a nude woman, the boyfriend’s father-in-law, a black man denouncing imperialism, and, in a dream sequence— how could he not appear?—Stalin himself with an entourage that includes the young Brezhnev and Beria. (The Stalin figure seems to an obligatory standard in all these films, usually, unlike here, in documentary footage.) In the end, Tolik dies (he’s the dotty dissident who brews moonshine just to retaliate against them; the jugs are capped by rubber gloves that balloon when the liquid ferments; he also likes to go around with balloons tied to him); Alexandra bears Mitya’s (?) baby; Vova reforms; a priest baptizes Mitya who also joins the navy. Along the way a trenchant comment or two—e.g., grandpa, who is a White Guard aristocrat living in France, writes to Mitya to uphold honesty and truth, to distrust the lies of perestroika even more than the lies of Brezhnev; Vova comments that perpetual irritation is the common condition of all Soviets. An occasional amusing touch— the priest asks for stripping to the waist, meaning Mitya, but the guardian and his girlfriend do it. But for the most part bad farce, bad slapstick, bad put-ons…. Nudity, absurdity, sophomoric épater le socialist realism, misfiring critiques, and much wasted energy. The frenetic pace reminiscent of Almodóvar. Soloviev is an intellectual (that’s the problem with these guys) whose declared esthetic is that art begins when meaning ends. One pictures him scurrying around the set or tearing through the script purging all meaning. Why a turtle in the death scene?, someone asks. No reason, he answers. Ditto in other cases. He is dedicated to beauty and love, and finds them in the seemingly ugly. This is, with ASSA, part of trilogy. Soloviev had just arrived; awakened on plane with news of the anti-Gorbachev coup; quit kidding, and let me sleep, he replied.\n\n8\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nSwan Lake. The Zone: A Film by Yuri Ilyenko 9/13/91, Film Forum\n\nAgain, trouble ahead: Canadian, Hungarian, U.S., Swedish, and Dovzhenko Studios all involved. But it’s not joint productions they need. It’s not technical hardware and Western sophistication they need. (Tarkovsky’s greatest works made do with what he had at home.) It’s talent they need. And discipline, and restraint, and overcoming the glee of doing whatever they want after years of hamhanded controls. It’s art they need and not counter-statements and counter-esthetics. Lots of promise here: It’s Ilyenko after all, Paradzhanov’s cameraman for the extraordinary Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (speaking of making do), and, as the introductory title tells us, shot in Paradzhanov’s prison camps. (A couple of times we see a magazine with Paradzhanov on the cover, under the heading “Maestro”.) And an interesting idea, too: that of an escaped convict hiding out in the interior of, of all things, a monumental sheet-metal hammerand-sickle, while life goes on along the highway below. This could have been, and was, up to a point, a kind of Slavic-absurdist Beckett in which the convict keeps returning to his peculiar haven. Instead, the convict leaves (made to leave? discovered? evicted?) for prison again, followed up by a couple of suicide attempts, one unsuccessful ending in resurrection, the other successful ending with his stiff cadaver standing against the bars of his prison. There are also sequences of is it real? or is it fantasy? often involving a blonde beauty (too gorgeously glamorous to fit in) who befriends him and wants to whisk him away. Here too, great possibilities: in the USSR love can only be realized in self-made havens like the convict’s hammer and sickle interior. This is only partially fulfilled in a couple of surreal sections: she dresses for the “wedding”, putting on, incidentally, hammer and sickle pendant earrings—are we supposed to laugh? In their erotically charged interior, however, they never do consummate things—once, effectively done, when her son refuses to accept their relationship and aims a barrage of slingshotted pebbles at their metal exterior: cacophony and unrealized desire. Another time, an overdone picture of disappointment as she gets herself all messed up with the new silver paint the exterior has\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n9\n\nbeen painted with after his eviction. [One of these interior scenes shows the incredibly sloppy work they think they can get away with these days—it makes you want to scream, bring back the commissars! bring back socialist realism! She lights a candle then fumbles with the match-box, finally putting it down somewhere; she changes position and carefully tugs at her slip to keep it from climbing up her thighs; she wants to reach over but can’t find something to lean on to support her weight: all these touches of clumsy improvisation and/or direction in a film of high surreal pretension.] Here and there, as always, some powerful moments, aside from the overall powerful mood of despair: the convict running, running over barren rocks, the camera following him from above; the convict taking off his socks, revealing his horribly bloodied feet; the many ugly prison scenes, one with the caged convicts doused with a hose while swans waddle about. (Other swan images: in blue monotint they fly in formation; three dead swans on a flat-bed truck.) A “blood transfusion” in which not the blood, which spills inadvertently from the unconnected tubing, but an old woman’s faith revives the dead man. This whole sequence something out of old Russian literature with its pain and pathos: the tipsy guard hauls the body on a horse-drawn cart to the old woman’s on Easter night. The ugly terrain with some foul sulphurous water gushing from a sewer duct. The boy climbing into the convict’s space…. But they don’t all hold together. Perhaps Paradzhanov’s different stories were woven too artificially around the one convict? Perhaps some linking sequences cut? (E.G., according to [Vincent] Canby, the program notes make it clear the boy turned the convict in.) Reminiscent of Stalker (also taking place in a “zone”), but not as magical.\n\nDays of Eclipse: A Film by Alexander Sokurov 8/29/91, Museum of Modern Art\n\nA moody meditation in the Central Asian desert by the Tarkovskylike Sokurov. S. is quoted as being taken by “the deep, difficult, painful impressions which Asia” made on him, and produced this\n\n10\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nreverie shot in a Turkmenia filled with heat and dust and poverty and suffering and the inability of a Russian to survive without some emotional or intellectual anchor. Reminiscent of the English-in-India theme and ambience. S. adds lots of strange images to the already exotic milieu. E.G., a lobster arrives in the post preserved in a gel; a lizard appears when there is food around; shots of the village structures in eerie light (eclipse?), and a shot of the lead figure (Sasha) walking among the miniature mock-ups that are the “village structures”; a clerk gets Sasha to fill out some forms, crossing his legs, seemingly desperate to urinate—when the forms are completed he rushes outside, flings the forms into the air and runs away. Lots of tight close-ups, slow pans, long holds; a horribly jangling phone, local folk music on the sound track (not often enough). The film opens in amber, amber screen for the titles then amber sands shot from overhead. Somber Asian faces: a psychiatric compound? A Russian doctor—long-haired, arty, a Slavic Patrick Swayze—is there in a medical setting, but he never actually attends to patients; he taps incessantly at his portable typewriter, at work on his study of an Old Believer community in Turkmenia. There are political exiles here, including Seventh Day Adventists. Volga Germans are also mentioned, as are Crimean Tatars. There is no plot or real story line, only a series of scenes/images that have an emotional depth from the way they are shot. E.G., a Russian friend commits suicide. There is a long, long take against a silent soundtrack of the local police in the dead man’s apartment, talking to each other, picking up items, looking around, they take the body out on a stretcher (the dead man’s toes—a recurring Russian image?), and load it in the ambulance. (Later the dead man speaks to Sasha and he experiences a terror freak-out; this alienating place has gotten to him.) Another haunting scene, simply done: a maddened soldier is tracked down and shot by a patrol; the body is viewed by Sasha. Filmed from afar. Sasha has a friend, Dima, a local Crimean Tatar raised by a Volga German family, and they have a tender (homoerotic?) relationship. A particularly beautiful/powerful scene: after the encounter with the talking corpse, Sasha goes to Dima, shaken. He is comforted by him, and without actually touching, they kind of embrace in a contorted way, their torsos horizontally parallel to one another. At the end of the film, they part sadly.\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n11\n\nBesides the exiles references, there is another “political” moment in the film: Someone leafs through some pages of a book with Hitler photographs while the soundtrack has the hackneyed speech of some Komsomol official. Other characters appear and disappear—Sasha’s sister; an eccentric historian and his wife; an angelic boy nursed back to health by Sasha. (That kid, of beautiful visage of course, is the one cloying, annoying thing in the film.) The script is based on a novel by the Strugatsky brothers, hence reasonable to assume sci-fi elements. Sokurov’s melancholic mysticism and relentlessly ominous mood doesn’t always work, but he is still the most original voice in contemporary Soviet cinema. Despite the new freedoms, he hasn’t gone haywire like some others, and remains true to himself. Eclipse has the look and feel of his Lonely Voice, made (and shelved) ten years earlier, pre-glasnost.\n\nThe Second Circle: A Film by Alexander Sokurov 12/13/91, Walter Reade Theater\n\nSokurov is certainly Tarkovskian (down to interior rain and the sounds of water), but without his dramatic and narrative style. This is a depressing, not quite real-time film of a son’s arranging for a father’s burial. The mood, like Stalker, is dismal, as much from the emotional material as from the squalid settings and the squalid interactions of the few characters. Overall, the film is compelling and intense despite the paucity of content. The son is grieving, clearly, for reasons we never know. We know neither son nor father, in fact. Hence, the film is almost a documentary of a death and burial arrangements in the contemporary USSR. (Seeing it now, one cannot help thinking it is a metaphor for the squalid death of the USSR itself.) The opening is characteristic: a driving snow, a solitary figure bending and then kneeling into the wind. Silence, then a roar of the storm; fade. [Long list of credits follows, rather ruining the mood.] Soundtrack filled throughout, sometimes deafeningly, with ordinary effects—knocks, bundles hitting the surface of a table or\n\n12\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nfloor, running water, radio static. Blue-grey colors alternate with greens, monotints, grey and white. A favored camera angle is from above. Some scenes shot from a peculiar vantage—e.g., when the 3 embalmers silently go about their business, injecting the cadaver with fluid (one gooses the other), applying make-up to its face, the son stands silently in the kitchen and the camera captures all four through the doorway. The son, evidently not a professional actor, is just right as the anxious, inept, but still concerned only next of kin. He is probably everyone’s idea of Raskolnikov—poor, distracted, feverish. Not an intellectual though. Emphasized throughout—as I noted for Eclipse—the dead man’s toes. In fact, in one particularly pathetic episode, the son takes off his own socks to cover the feet of the dead man, patters around barefoot as the casket is taken out of the building with great difficulty, then asks the others to wait so he can put on his shoes over his bare feet. Oh, the flavor of Dostoevsky, Oh what a sad place our Russia is. When someone comes to wash the body and is told by the son the pipes have cracked, there is no water, he hauls the cadaver out into the snow to wash it there. Oddly, there is emotional depth, despite our not knowing the faintest thing about the dead man or his surviving son, or of their relationship. We know each lived alone, the son in another town. Father was a military man, though there was some kind of falling out with his superiors. Did he fight at Stalingrad?—the son goes through some pathetic possessions; among them is a cigarette case with the Stalingrad monument on its face. From the moody stares and from the way the son does his best to care for the cadaver and see to a decent burial, we know he feels something at his father’s passing. There is a strange and powerful moment when the son opens the dead man’s eyes and stares into them for a long while, as if trying to see something there that he hadn’t known in life. There are some revealing portraits of Soviet officialdom in action. The local coroner who has to turn to a little boy (a rather beatific little boy, as in the Eclipse film) for the proper medical term for cancer (a diagnosis offered by the son). (The little boy also tries to comfort the son.) A wry exchange: the coroner, an old woman, cites “Ilyich” in the struggle against bureaucracy. What Ilyich are you talking about? asks the son. Lenin, replies the woman with a\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n13\n\nstraight face. Then there is the undertaker, a big Russian woman who is impatient with her wimpy and impecunious client. She bosses him around with venom in her voice and gestures, and with total disregard of the dead man or the situation. [The archetypical unsentimental Soviet woman who really runs that miserable society.] Some surreal episodes: a hand-held camera films the son as he gets ill in a crowded bus; jostling blurred images—a dream?, we wonder; no, it really happened, we find out later. A bobbing headshot of the son as the background moves behind him—reminiscent of the wonderful scene in Stalker where we discover the young daughter is not floating but sitting atop her father’s shoulders. Here we never see what the son is riding on. A huge incinerator seems to look down over the town below, but then the son, who is burning his father’s clothes and bedding, appears and he is the same size as the incinerator. Hallucinatory. (Same trick in Eclipse where a figure strides among the miniature mock-up of the village.) This is the penultimate image. At the very end: the pathetic squalid empty room. Then the message: Fortunate are the nearest and dearest of ours who die before us.\n\nSatan: A Film by Viktor Aristov 3/29/92, Museum of Modern Art\n\nYet another filmic pop sociology from the moribund USSR with its usual graphic, painfully ugly representation of daily life. The difference here is that real EVIL is presented, not just loose living, corruption, alcoholism and the other standard blots we have come to expect from candid portrayals of Soviet life in the era of glasnost when filmmakers and other creative people overdosed on telling things as they are. Here, the corruption is on a scale that takes it out of just the Soviet ordinary. The main character, a blandly handsome young man in his 20s, is a psychopath, clinically speaking, or if you like, an existential cold-blooded amoralist echoing memorable types in Dostoevsky, Camus, and Simenon. There is real depth here, unlike say Taxi Blues or Little Vera. The Dostoevskian echoes are especially strong in that the young man kills not for the money, just like Raskolnikov, although his motives are not intellectual as in\n\n14\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nRaskolnikov’s case, but personal—he wants attention, is tired of being a nobody. Other Dusty (Nabokov’s wry name for Dostoevsky) echoes: his victim is a pre-adolescent schoolgirl, recalling D’s grief at a world that allows the death of single innocent child. Also: a friend spouts some superman theory when he berates someone for maligning Stalin. Stalin, he says, belongs to a group of historic figures like Hitler, Solzhenitsyn, Einstein and Gorbachev (!) who comprise a special category. The poverty and confined quarters, the feverishness, and also the detective story (though there are no detectives) aspect all also recall D. But though there is a real crime, there is no punishment and no redemption. Vitaly gets away with it, leaving a string of victims, not just the dead child. In the ending—a cheap shot that detracts—he smiles triumphantly, wickedly at the camera. Also the title is unsubtle and somehow diminishes things. Reading the above, I find the film sounds a lot more powerful than it really is. The shooting style is very straightforward, naively so, the colors are those mousy blue greys we’ve come to expect from recent Soviet films, and all of the violent scenes—the murder, the two seduction/rapes are played without any dynamics or real shocking effects. It’s almost as if Soviet filmmakers are still too prudish. The one exception: Svetlana Bragarnik’s Alyona is chilling in her portrayal as the murdered girl’s mother. Two highpoints: when she learns of the purported kidnapping—she wails and writhes on the floor, her back to the camera—and when she realizes her lover is the kidnapper/killer. But she also is good throughout as a high-powered woman in some vaguely powerful position with vaguely illegal connections (two burly comrades seem to know the underworld and promise to help her.) She looks a lot like Anna Friendlich, and even limps like what I remember Friendlich doing in some film (Rasputin?, Stalker?). Part of the absence of the shocking may have to do with rendering evil as matter-of-fact. That’s certainly the way Sergei Kuprianov’s Vitaly goes about his business. Whether he’s hitting the kid over the head (we see this at a distance)—he does throw up, though; or enticing a bride, at her wedding, in full bridal dress to go off to some back hallway with him, then possessing her standing up (she has no choice he tells her, it would be too embarrassing, and no one will believe she\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n15\n\ndidn’t go willingly), or finally has his way with someone he’s been after. When the mother resists, he simply excuses himself. “I have to go to the bathroom”—and disappears into the night. In between extortionist phone calls to the parents in disguised voices and his seduction/rapes he goes about things calmly, normally. Takes care of an old man in his communal apartment (shown for the hell such things are), pals around with an Armenian friend. [Is the city Leningrad? No water though. He and his grandfather are from Buzuluk. A Bergman-like scene (from The Silence)— marching soldiers in the night, self-propelled guns.] Opening: we know we’re in for trouble and ugliness—dank colors, a fog, sinister percussion. Crowds. A pack of running dogs. A woman’s body attended to by EMS. (Looks real.) The girl, innocently riding on the handlebars with him to school reports a plane crash locally, 200 dead. All of this means: Welcome to the Soviet Union! In the Era of Apocalypse! Apparent throughout: sexism and the strong women, but even the strong ones are treated like shit. His Armenian friend is sleeping with someone whose name he gets wrong; she still wants to be with him, but he tells her to get lost. Vitaly picks up a homely woman at the wedding (after he’s violated the bride, evidently a virgin); she’s delighted by this, but he gives her the slip and she goes berserk in the city’s night streets. (A street-fair/carnival à la Arbat is aswirl.) The strong single parent mother who resists him and threatens to call the police, finally can’t fight him off. And there’s nothing Alyona can do either: he’s got too much on her. Even her husband didn’t know she had all that money stashed away. At the poshlust wedding, the father of the bride is a Pamyat type who rants about Jews and Israel and how all take advantage of poor Russia. The only nice person in the film: the unnamed father, a two-bit actor, whose trips abroad Alyona cruelly tells him were her doing. Even the dead girl’s younger sister, a mere toddler, is a selfish creature, who knows sister is dead and wants her toys. At the end, Vitaly wanders into the night after his encounter with Alyona. Fade to morning: we see him with two girls aboard a trolley-bus. He’s seduced them too. A triumphal smile (and the bush-league—self-referential—wave to the camera).\n\n16\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nAn existential thriller. Really among the most interesting films spawned by glasnost. Not saying much, but still…. [My friend, the émigré Artyom, reported that he was told it is a really good film, but he won’t go see it, or others like it: too painful to recall the Soviet past, evidently.]\n\nHey, You Wild Geese!: A Film by Lidiya Bobrova 4/1/92, Museum of Modern Art\n\nThis, too, a piece of (what we may now call) late-Soviet filmic pop sociology. But with a difference, namely a severe almost modern primitive style that comes from straightforward narrative, the nonprofessional actors, the stark black and white, and the recurring folk-like title song (Hey you wild geese, tell me what’s my fate in this world/Am I ever destined to bear my pitiful lot?). Another difference: this is not Moscow, but village or small town life in Southern Russia. The obvious reference is Shukshin, but with no romanticism. The film begins and ends with sepia tint: a musician, handsome, bearded in the peasant way, and his three sons, sometime in the 1950s when life was simple and signified hope. An outbreak of color with the showing of a typical Soviet triumphalist/sentimental propaganda documentary on the 1980 Moscow Olympics with tears and Mischa the Bear. Moscow’s food, hospitality, and the enthusiasm of adoring foreigners contrast against the squalid lives of the locals watching the film. It is the 80s. The sons have grown up: Mitya the child-like invalid simpleton (he has one lung and can’t find work; he has an invalid’s pension of 21 rubles) with a wife who drives herself to fainting spells trying to make ends meet for her husband and daughter by taking in sewing. (A problem: locating needles for her sewing machine.) Petya, an alcoholic stoker with a melancholy temperament and a powerful unhappy wife. Sanka, a hulking excon (manslaughter), given to drink and an occasional catatonic fit. What ties them together is not only their pitiful lives, but their shared memories of a happier youth. The accordion Mitya plays is papa’s; it symbolizes the old family and its hopes. It is almost expropriated by the militia when Mitya is driven to play at the\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n17\n\nmarketplace for money. The policeman has pity on him and lets him have it back. [Mitya looks remarkably like the White officer’s Cossack orderly in Chapayev: full head of dark hair and beard, sad eyes, and broad face. Bobrova’s camera loves to linger in close-up on his sad visage.] Just a series of situations, no real plot—adding to the old-fashioned look and feel of the film. Almost like a silent film—even an episode out of Chaplin in which Sanka picks up an alcoholic tramp with a front tooth missing, feeds her, dresses her, takes her to the bath-house. There’s a peculiar shift in the film’s focus from Mitya to Sanka when the latter suddenly appears, looking a bit like a menacing Raymond Massey in Arsenic and Old Lace. Sanka almost runs off with Petya’s wife, who was, obviously, his old girl friend. The note of menace continues with a bunch of ex-cons with ugly mugs sitting around drinking and singing with Sanka at Mitya’s house. But nothing horrible happens, only daily life. Even the stray animals look beaten, as do the old folks sitting around waiting for dinner at some center. The closing: the older Raya still at her sewing machine, still looking for needles, Mitya feeding slops to the pigs and breaking out into song. Oi, what a sad place our Russia is…. Bobrova worked up the script in 1981 and never dreamed then it could be filmed. It’s a diploma film for Gherman’s workshop. Taken from life, not fictitious. Not happy, unfortunately, “but that’s our life.” Someone in the audience from Ukraine asks, does this really exist in Russia? Never saw in Ukraine! Someone else: yep, I saw it. Bobrova says, what’s this, Soviet patriotism? Distributors don’t like the film, not commercial enough. “Women not more aggressive, but stronger.” It’s true women in Soviet society the dominant force, “history shows it.”\n\nRaspad: A Film by Mikhail Belikov\n\n4/14/92, 1600 Broadway Screening Room Unfortunately, another misfire. An ambitious piece of work by an angry Ukrainian filmmaker determined to use Chernobyl as\n\n18\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nmetaphor for the collapse of Soviet society and morality (see the interview with Belikov, Chapter VII, 2). Curiously, Raspad is never\n\ntranslated for western audiences: it means collapse, breakdown, disintegration. Not a bad idea in that Chernobyl did in fact reveal the Soviets’ lousy technology, lousy maintenance, lousy deceitful and selfish authorities, and their lousy capacity to hide the dangerous truth even from (especially from!) their own people. And Chernobyl finally forced Gorbachev to really open things up and give meaning to glasnost—the candidness and de-moralization that characterized the USSR in the ensuing period certainly contributed to its collapse. Add the many fascinating real-life personal stories that unfolded during the disaster. And FINALLY, the apocalyptic overtones of this “wormwood” event…add all of this and there is potentially an engrossing docudrama with large emotional resonances. Belikov tries to achieve all of this but the problem is the film is neither gripping docudrama nor effective melodrama. The characters are stereotypes without any depth and their stories are integrated poorly. Special effects and the docudrama format (time and place titles at lower left) are not up to the technical levels to have a real impact, despite the assistance of US co-production (e.g., post-production at Lucas’s Skywalker Ranch). Some of the crowd and panic and evacuation scenes work well enough, as do some initial on-site shots—burning graphite on the ground, Reactor No. 4 spouting fiery radioactivity into the night sky, etc. But there is no tension and no spectacular impact. Even when the journalists climb to the roof of the reactor at the end the effect is wooden. (The program notes describe actual filming at the reactor site—Belikov even got a dose of radiation sickness—but I suspect that scene was a studio shot.) As for moral decay, this theme centers principally on the journalist’s family—he forgets to bring back soil from his father’s ancestral Greece (and improbably faints when he remembers this at a party) but his carousing friends assure him if he shovels some local dirt papa won’t know the difference; his wife is having an affair with a local influential pretty-boy (this is never really spelled out, and there is no dramatic development); a young couple getting married wants a doctor to hospitalize his dad so they can have some privacy; an operator tries to sell over-priced tickets at the RR terminal\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n19\n\nas thousands are desperate to leave. Even the priests are anxious to get away. Not very powerful stuff. The atrocious behavior of the authorities is shown in their arriving in limos at the airport making their getaways with their families even as they are lying to the public; in a local editor refusing to run anything on the disaster, preferring feel-good news; and in a spokesman denying anything major at a news conference (a cute touch: he tells an American journalist “did the Soviet public suffer any consequences from the Three Mile Island event?”). The best sequences involve the young married couple on a motorcycle seeking privacy in the countryside but only suicidally (and improbably) getting deeper and deeper into the contaminated zone, but we never know what happens to them, and some of what could have been tender moments are clumsily handled. Also a little flat: the helicopter shots of the deserted Pripyat below, and the little boy who stays behind waiting with his cat for his mother. (On the soundtrack: Albinoni’s Adagio, endlessly used by Soviet filmmakers.) Both cat and boy are fatally radiated. Overall, especially in the crowd scenes (and especially when in one of them a couple is fornicating standing up), and in the party drinking scenes (someone comments on the fatalist character of the Slavs), we do get a feel for a society going to hell with itself with the fire and brimstone of Chernobyl as the backdrop. And there is someone’s bitter comment: “We are all to blame.” Add also Vysotsky’s mordant song rasping out at the end and you have the elements of a powerful statement. BUT only the elements.\n\nGo Away!: A Film by Dmitry Astrakhan, Human Rights Film Festival\n\n5/14/92, Columbus Circle Theater [The Russian—Izydi—might be rendered as Get Thee Out (or maybe better, Begone!) as in Izydi Satana!] A moving first film by the Leningrader Astrakhan set in BabelAleichem-Kuprin land before the Revolution in vodka-soaked pogrom time (see the interview with Astrakhan, Chapter VII, 2). Rich characterizations and rich social-cultural textures mark this yet an-\n\n20\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nother film in the modern Soviet series on Jewish themes flourishing under perestroika. Fiddler on the Roof without any gloss, but with tremendous vitality. Motyl, a big man with lusty appetites, gets his Second-Guild Merchant permit to run a dairy in a village where he and his family are the only Jews living on very friendly terms among the gentiles. He has dreams of making it someday in Petersburg. There are nice family textures—his red-headed daughter (played a little too modernly) is the sweetheart of his Russian friend’s son Petya; his wife’s relatives come for a visit and never seem to leave; he lives it up with some prostitutes and his wife smacks him when she notices a hickey on his neck. But all of this is overshadowed by the pogrom we know is to come from the constant black and white visions that begin the film and are interspersed throughout. In a powerful denouement (real time now in black and white) Motyl decides not to run away, as his Russian friends encourage, but grabs an ax and marches alone to confront the Black Hundred mob that has already ravaged the Jewish population in town. His Russian friends, including the local constable, grab weapons and join him. This intense moment which builds from Motyl’s other-worldly eye-bulging crazed peering into the distance is, I think, ruined by the cliché end: a freeze frame of Motyl’s haunted face, then fade to white. Some beautifully done moments: • The tender nuptial scene in an old woman’s cottage between Petya and Belka, now Yefrosinia. Just lie there and let him fool around, the old woman advises her. • Motyl is enraged when he finds out. His mother tells him, I too went mad when your father first kissed me. Motyl: but that was Solomon Moiseyevich not Petya Ivanovich! • After the shock and a moment’s hesitation, Motyl’s friend Ivan: “Motyl, we’re relatives!” • Motyl buys a cow for his drunken and treacherous neighbor (this guy is a bit overdone—constantly soused and ready to join the pogrom against Motyl, who is always kind to him). Life was raw, colorful, dangerous. (A gypsy horse-thief is beaten to death.) Terrific Motyl by the Georgian O. Megvinetukhtsesi.\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n21\n\nThe Stone: A Film by Alexander Sokurov, New York Film Festival Feature 9/28/92, Walter Reade Theater\n\nI wish someone hadn’t told the audience in a special announcement before the film at this press screening that the “ghost” described in the press kit was really Anton Chekhov. Would I have guessed it to have been him? Would it have been seen differently if we did not know it was intended as a returned Chekhov? The answer to the first question is yes, I would probably have identified him as Chekhov—the actor [Leonid Mosgovoy] was a good image of the writer, particularly the writer we know from the photograph showing him in mid-years, with pince-nez and formal dress. The museum-house and its setting by the sea was also reminiscent of what I have seen or imagined as Chekhov’s Crimean summer home. As to the second question, I’m not sure knowing or not knowing makes any difference. The film is so opaque it really doesn’t matter whether it is Chekhov or some other ghost who has returned to his seaside house. This is Sokurov in his most riddlelike, impenetrable mode. There is no plot, no story, just a ghostly encounter in which nothing much happens, and rendered in black and white, with shadows, often through a distorted lens. There are several endlessly long, silent takes. I nodded off repeatedly, awoke, and discovered it was still the same scene. One of these was particularly moving, though, and remains in my memory: “Chekhov” stares, just stares intently for a long time at the close face of the young man who is evidently the night watchman. There is so much in that stare—amusement, love, curiosity, an intense curiosity like that of a person who can’t take his eyes off a beloved son he hasn’t seen in many years: how you’ve grown, how handsome you are, how you resemble my father, how is life treating you?…. The young man discovers an intruder taking a bath. The intruder acts as if he belongs in this fine old mansion. “How long are you here for?,” he’s asked. “Don’t know. Maybe forever,” he replies. He wanders around, plays the piano, tries on clothes, dresses (formally) for dinner. An egret appears. He advises the young man about his health (he is, after all, Dr. Chekhov). There’s not much for dinner, just the young man’s sausage to share. They drink from an old bottle\n\n22\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\n(literally ink? or, it tastes just like ink?). A walk out of doors. Woods. The sea. Chekhov sits out a snowstorm on a bench. “There used to be an orchard,” he observes a couple of times. Back inside. Someone is at the door. Chekhov goes to see who it is. “I’m coming with you,” says the young man. End of film. At the end a dedication to Vladimir Soloviev (the pre-revolutionary mystic philosopher), and to a woman whose name I didn’t catch. Hmmm. An allegory here? With the end of the Soviet Union, the return of old Russia is inevitable and desirable. Shown here is the best of old Russian culture and thought, Anton Chekhov. He is amused and puzzled by the present; and of course by the nice Soviet touch—little to eat or drink. And they’ve destroyed the fine old orchard. He’ll make the best of it; let’s start all over again, with a cleansing bath. But hold on, there’s an ominous knock at the door….. Maybe. Unfortunately, what is sometimes haunting here—in the silent, dark, visually riveting manner of Tarkovsky and Sokurov (more Sokurov)—is overwhelmed by tedium.\n\nClose to Eden: A Film by Nikita Mikhalkov 11/14/92, Lincoln Plaza Cinema\n\nWon the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, 1991—Europeans are suckers for this kind of stuff, though the theater was packed on the Saturday night I saw it here, and it’s been running for about a month. [Still running, 12/19] Jointly produced with the French. The original title is Urga, the Mongolian word for the lasso-pole riders use for various purposes, including, evidently, capturing women—in the opening scene, a hooded rider, with blood-curling shrieks, chases another hooded rider with an Urga, successfully. The prey we discover is a woman; not only a woman, but the hunter’s wife, who is boycotting sex because they have three kids already and besides, government policy, for the cities at least, limits families to one child. Also, the Urga, when driven into the ground lets people know that lovemaking is going on in the vicinity. The wife, whose beauty matches\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n23\n\nher handsome husband’s, fights him off, and so begins a visually and anthropologically satisfying, but not very compelling tale of the clash between tradition (the Eden of the title) and modernization. And into a cluster of clichés enters a Russian, with all of his problems. [Eduard] Artemyev contributes a haunting flute motif to the score. The script was jointly authored by Mikhalkov and [Rustam] Ibragimbekov, from an idea by Mikhalkov. Lots of sky. Frequent shots of the sun. The bare hills stretching to the horizon. The land of Ghengis Khan (no wonder he set out to conquer other lands: where’s the Eden here?) [I had an amusing discussion of the new title translated back into Russian—there is a word for Eden, Edem, but no Russian would understand it.] The Mongol theme has of course a particular resonance for Russians, but not a pleasant one. Mikhalkov plays with this theme: Zomba wants another son, the child would be the fourth, like Genghis Khan. In a fantasy-dream sequence the great conqueror appears with his fierce retinue scourging all signs of modernity—a TV set, a truck; they wrap the Russian in a rug and drag him with their horses. This sequence looked so good that I thought perhaps this is the film Mikhalkov should have made—an old-fashioned adventure tale with the conquering Mongols, minus TV sets. The handsome couple live in their yurt with their 3 kids and a grandma. A Russian comes their way when his truck gets stuck in the sand—he fell asleep at the wheel, and almost fell into a pond. They bring him home, he drinks their firewater, they slaughter and roast a lamb for him, and their daughter shows her skill with the accordion, playing and gesturing merrily like a seasoned performer (and in contrast to the primitive ambience), a paso doble, of all things. Sergei is good-hearted, sentimental, earthy—a Sibiryak who cries when the girl plays. He hits it off with Zomba. Anthropology: he finds a corpse rotting in the plain when he goes for help—it’s only uncle, Zomba assures him, that’s the way we handle our dead. The wife is a city girl, and she wants a TV. Also condoms. So off Zomba goes to the city with her note about condoms (but he’s too shy to get them at the local pharmacy). At the local hotel nightclub, with Zomba and a Russian pal (who wants to roll Zomba), Sergei asks the band to play “The Hills of Manchuria” and has them read\n\n24\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nthe notes tattooed on his back. One hundred years ago my grandfather died for you (the 1905 War?). Toska amidst the disco dancing of the young folks. Some nice sight gags back at the yurt. A Rambo poster. Grandma contentedly popping the bubbles of the plastic wrap for the TV. On the screen Gorbachev and Bush. And the Mongolian plains. The accordion whiz reads Sergei’s tattooed notes. The subtle as borshch flash-forward ending—the landscape defiled by smokestack and gas station; the narrator is the fourth son in a new modernized Mongolia. Mikhalkov the social romantic, just like his brother in Sibiriade.\n\nShy Boy: An Uzbek Film Directed by Kamara Kamalova 7/26/93, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign\n\nI know nothing about the film or the director, except what was printed in the Center’s Calendar of Events: “…captures the awkwardness of adolescence and the challenges for those coming of age in the Stalin era of the 1940s.” Actually, I think from internal evidence the film is set [Tashkent?] in the early 1950s. Moonstruck among the Uzbeks. Elizabeth Talbott of the UI library told me it wasn’t very good; what surprised her was how aggressive the women were portrayed in the film—unrealistically, she implied. But maybe not; this was still the post-war period (many references to men going off to the War), and there was a man shortage. Also, things were a lot looser on the frontiers for the Russians depicted here. Not very professionally shot, and the sentiments and characterizations are rather primitive, but as usual with films from exotic places, there is a certain “anthropological” fascination. And several elements in the work impart a bit of depth and mystery, the lush, sad musical score, for one thing; the constant haunted, fixed stare of Alik the moonstruck young man infatuated with Maya, the saucy would-be actress. (Unfortunately, she is not as striking as his rapturous gaze suggests, nor is there much subtlety in her portrayal.)\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n25\n\nThere are lots of Russian-Uzbek overtones: mixed marriages, half-breed offspring, etc.—but this aspect was hard to follow. E.G., we know Alik’s sister is married to an Uzbek, but is Alik himself a child of a mixed marriage? His father never came back from the war. His mother is clearly Russian—and she is rather strange, always working, charitably it seems, and this annoys Alik, who seems to hold things together. Alik is handsome, and in the way Maya describes: powerful and gentle at the same time. He stares at Maya, follows her everywhere, can’t bring himself to speak to her, and when he is to recite his lines to her in a rehearsal of a play they have parts in, he falls down in a dead faint. Finally, an aggressive Uzbek friend brings them all together for some sexual fun, and Alik pounces on Maya, to her horror. He retreats, and their affair is never really consummated, despite heavy breathing, some exposure of her flesh (she bathes in her underwear, while he averts his eyes), and his passionate declarations. A touching moment: he brings her his pet lamb. In the busy courtyard where Alik and others live a subplot with a treacherous outcome takes shape. A local bully-bigwig lives there, and when he bruises Alik’s sister (the big-wig’s son pees on people below from his porch above), Alik is determined to right the insult, something his brother-in-law is too frightened to do. Finally, in a poorly realized scene (much tension had been building), Alik slaps the big-wig, who promptly has his thugs seize Alik and pile him into a waiting truck. Ominously, the big-wig calls for fetching Alik’s “dirk” (a gift from his father) before they depart. Next, Alik, wearing a workman’s cap, clearly years later, returns from somewhere, staring at a mosque we remember from the opening scene, and heads first for Maya’s; she is gone, he is told, and he notices a lambskin used as a doormat in front of what was Maya’s apartment. Next, he heads for the courtyard. Everyone is at a wedding, the big-wig’s older son’s, Alik’s grandma tells him, and pleads with him not to go there, to leave things be. But Alik goes, sees the merriment, watches the big-wig dance, his sister and brother-in-law too. What will he do? What has happened to him? We wait…. and the credits scroll. Was he castrated? I thought at first his tongue was cut out. You know, some Uzbek revenge blood rite. But we don’t know…. And\n\n26\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nevil has triumphed—in the form of the big-wig’s getting away with his crime, and the victims are silent and complicitous. A parable of Stalinism?\n\nLa Chasse aux Papillons: A Film by Otar Ioseliani 11/11/93, Lincoln Plaza Cinema\n\nI’m glad I caught it on the last day of its New York run—[Vincent] Canby’s mean-spirited pan, rather insensitive to its meaning, didn’t help the film. I went in particular because a) it’s Ioseliani and b) I wanted to discuss it with Aleko Tsabadze, a fellow Georgian filmmaker and exile (see the interview with Tsabadze in Chapter VII, 3). Aleko told me he didn’t care much for it—and neither did I at first; I thought Canby was absolutely correct in his put-down of the film as third-rate Buñuel. There was about it that quality of what Soviet filmmakers think of as the kind of art they would make if only they could (and, unfortunately did, during the glasnost years)—nonnarrative, full of disconnected images, absurdity displacing meaning, and, worst of all, NOT FUNNY, certainly not as funny as they think…. ….But then…. I was soon caught up in the really underlying mood and meaning of the undertaking, the elegy for a world forever gone, remembered only in the daydreams of the émigrée. Of course, Ioseliani also takes not all too subtle pot shots at the moral squalor and greed of both the very rich—the French, Indians, and Japanese—and the very poor—the Russians. The first group at least have a certain, though faded grandeur, while the Russians have only squalor, material and moral. The moment I felt all this was when the film takes a sudden turn brought on by the death of the lady of the manor, an invalid Russian émigrée of great wealth, but not enough wealth to keep up the estate in really grand style. The news is telegraphed to her poor sister in squalid Moscow, and then begins the sad/funny tale of the distribution of the estate. Up to that point I agreed with Canby: the pace was tortuously slow, and the satire heavy-handed, though very well acted, particularly by Narda Blanchet, playing the lady’s cousin, an eccentric amid lots of other eccentrics. We are treated to a series of images, some\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n27\n\nof them quite beautiful, shot in a small French town. At the estate dwell a visiting maharajah, a band of Hare Krishnas, the Lady and her cousin, and a maid who doubles as everything else, including car mechanic. There is also a whiskey priest who has difficulty getting up in the morning and needs a pick-me-up to get him through mass. Cousin plays the organ at mass, and also trombone in a local band. Women come and go, riding their bicycles, capes billowing in the wind. The neighboring estate belongs to the notary, who complains that the Lady’s gardener trespasses with his tractor. His son has a beautiful black girlfriend who periodically blows up at him; she throws an egg at him, hitting a fine old oil portrait instead. They ride, play boules and croquet, drink cognac, take target practice, and fish—cousin does this with a bow-and-arrow in the estate pond. They also steal—cousin too, placing silverware in the toilet tank—or does she do this to prevent the maid from stealing it? In any event, the black girlfriend pinches it. (She also acts as guide in the mansion of the notary, who also fancies himself an operatic singer.) Finally, a group of Japanese are on hand looking for a chateau to buy, and they have settled on the Lady’s, nothing will shake them. All done in very nice deadpan, especially cousin’s. It all unfolds episodically in a gorgeous autumn, as befits the real mood of the film. Then the central story genuinely unfolds (all is merely preparatory): Mme. de Bayonette is reading some old letters and falls asleep. The ghost (played by Ioseliani) of her officerhusband hovers, lights a cigarette, and leaves it, lit, on an ashtray at her side. She dreams of a duel, beautifully shot, distantly, in which two young officers fell each other in the wintry morning. She awakes suddenly, feeling his presence, sees the cigarette, takes a puff and expires. The news is dispatched to various relatives, including the dead lady’s sister in Moscow. This allows Ioseliani to have some sardonic fun: the telegram is received in an ancient telegraph office, a clerk uses some ancient glue to make two copies, one for the KGB file of course, the other is delivered to a communal apartment where the usual squabbles and shrieking among the communards fill the air. There, two old ladies, one of them Mme. de Bayonette’s sister, read the news in her small room, decorated with old photographs. Her daughter, a dance instructor, is summoned; she walks through the queues-filled Moscow streets to the noisy apartment and learns\n\n28\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nof her aunt’s death. “Now which one was she?,” she asks, and is shown an old photograph. She calls France, the connection is lousy, and Ioseliani throws another barb: the KGB listening room. They arrange to go to France, and at the reading of the will sister learns she is the heiress to the estate. The relatives all leave, squabbling in their disappointment. How grubby are the rich, too. But the really incisive portrait is of the grasping niece who settles nicely into her new wealth: momma wants to clear the dishes, but she insists the servants are for that. She bosses the servant around. She savors the luxurious digs. Later, she pockets the money the Japanese pay for the estate, buys an apartment in Paris and throws a party for her Russian friends (one of whom is played by Alexander Askoldov). The vulgarity of the Soviet petit bourgeois. Meanwhile, poor momma sits in her new room, alone, discomfited, with only her memories. (Very nicely played by Alexandra Liebermann.) Much of this I got from the untranslated Russian. In the end: the Japanese get their estate and practice village ways—bicycles to mass, etc.—and hang enormous banners in Japanese on the facade of the chateau. In the last scene the maid is instructed on how to operate the new massive gates with a remote. And, oh yes, the train carrying the Maharajah’s private car, with cousin aboard, is blown up by unidentified terrorists (just as in Buñuel’s film—was it Discrete Charm?) So: a curse on all classes and nationalities; humans are a nasty quarreling, money-grasping lot. Or at least the modern species is. Perhaps there is a nostalgia here for the Russian aristocratic way of life long gone, existing only in fading photographs and in the memory of a poor old woman sitting in a lonely room. In the end: I was moved. Postscript: Why am I including this in my notes on Soviet film? Isn’t this after all a European film, made in Europe, shot with an international cast, by a director who has lived and worked in Europe for several years? Well, you can’t get the Soviet out of a former Soviet director. Or perhaps better: you can’t get the anti-Soviet out of a former Soviet director. (Cf. the glasnost directors.) Absurdity that is humorless—fatal for the absurd. A huge cast of characters. A certain cold humor. What else? Very amateurish editing, seeking “European” effects like intercut images of no narrative import,\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n29\n\nmiddle and long distance shots. (Maybe this is a Georgian painterly dimension?) Aleko Tsabadze, picking up my word, found the film irritating. He thinks Ioseliani, like many émigrés, smug and arrogant and derisive of others. [He thought this of the Georgian composer Kancheli whose work for viola and orchestra I heard at BAM last week.] His humor “cynical”, his characters cold, his emphasis on “things” overdone. He also didn’t think the shift to Moscow worked.\n\nThe Chekist: A Film by Aleksander Rogozhkin 3/21/94, Museum of Modern Art\n\nThis was a last-minute replacement for Sergei Ovcharov’s Drumroll, which didn’t arrive from Moscow. According to Kardish, this the first time in the 30-odd year history of the New Directors New Films festival that this has happened. Another sad commentary on the state of things over there…. The Chekist is a …shocker is I suppose the mot juste. (Speaking of mots justes, I noticed at the end that the film was scripted by the French in this French-Russian co-production, which explains some of the heavy-handed political-existential themes informing some of the dialogue—“I hate; you philosophize,” says the worker Chekist to the intellectual Chekist when the latter asks him if he ever feels any qualms about what he’s doing.) The theme: the constant bloodletting finally gets to Srubov, the intellectual, who goes berserk, inserts himself into the group of prisoners about to be shot, is only wounded, is committed to a psychiatric ward. At first, the graphic grimy execution is powerful. The troika of Srubov, Katz, and the worker-Chekist coldly read off names of prisoners and describe them briefly (priest, anti-Bolshevik, aristocrat, merchant, et al.) : “Opinion?” Each answers: “Shoot!” Was there a single discussion or an exception from this routine? I don’t think so. The prisoners, about half a dozen or so at a time, are told to strip— even the priest who begs exemption—to face a wall, then are shot by a group of Chekists with pistols. The corpses are transported by a flat dolly to another part of the basement, then hauled up to street\n\n30\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nlevel by rope, like so much cattle, dumped onto a truck, covered with tarpaulin, their limbs sticking out, and taken to be, presumably, incinerated. All this in vivid color. The blood and blood stains are then hosed down in preparation for the next batch. Often there are pleas to Srubov, sometimes by people known to him, but to no avail. The action centers on the black-garbed chain-smoking Srubov who stalks about stonily. Here’s the rhythm: troika says shoot; the cellar; Srubov watches; worker watches Srubov; Srubov stalks; repeat. After a while there is so much of this repetition, especially near the end with scene after scene of the executions that the effect is numbing and numbingly boring. All that nude hoisted flesh frontal and rear is shocking at first, but then… But then you realize that the intent is not to shock by piling it on, but to shock by the very ritualization of it all. (And I have no doubt that this is the way it very probably took place.) There are all sorts of moments: a bride and groom are married before execution; they hold hands as they are shot; a young man soils his underwear and a guard rubs his face in it; another man spits in the executioner’s face, etc. Throughout, a heavy babushka cleans up (in one scene she polishes the floor with her foot à la the Cossack-orderly in Chapayev). She sees all, crosses herself when Srubov walks by. In one startling scene I think was truncated, she is shown showering in all her blubbery flesh and watched by Srubov. He has just been asked by one of his victims, a doctor, “are you executing me because your wife told me you cannot consummate your marriage?” Did Srubov in the uncut version assault the babushka? Sex and violence, then, are related in the character of Srubov. As for the worker (Pepel? Pepelin?), he is accustomed to having his female secretaries run through rifle positions with him, after which they strip. One of them gets shot too, nonetheless. A petitioner brings her daughter into to see Srubov; she unclothes her and offers her to him; he is unmoved. The executioner Chekists snort drugs. One of them refuses to shoot a priest. Later, he tries to hang himself. Katz was responsible for shooting Srubov’s own father. When S. brings him home for dinner, his mother is appalled. An interesting scene pitting Katz against an old Jew who knew him from the\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n31\n\ncommunity. At one point Katz inserts Pepel’s name into the list of prisoners: Pepel automatically responds: Shoot! At the end, a dream-like sequence of men on horseback, b/w then color; an aerial pan; snow. The idealization of the Revolution. We kill in basements says one of the Chekists, not publicly with the guillotine. The revolution is not clothed in Marx’s white gown says Srubov, the angel of death. In one scene he releases a whole company after they have shot their commissar. A sign that he is cracking….? Rogozhkin made Karaul, also about ugly Soviet violence (and sex). For all its overt heavy psycho-political themes, the film is flat and uninteresting. But oh how once again it reveals what an abomination Russian filmmakers think The Triumph of October was.\n\nAnna: A Film by Nikita Mikhalkov 10/31/96, Film Forum\n\nI had heard quite a bit about this documentary shot by Mikhalkov over a 12-year period, each year filming his daughter and asking her the same questions. [What do you fear? What do you hate? What do you love? What do you want? What do you expect from life?] This is the Apted 7-Up genre, but in Mikhalkov’s hands the vehicle reveals less about his daughter—we hardly remember her answers, in any event rather banal, except her first answers (she would like a crocodile, she hates borshch), and learn little of her life and development aside from the visual indicators that she is growing up. (From these, she seems shy, and sensitive, unlike her self-assured kid sister Nadia—she of Burnt by the Sun fame—who is introduced at the end of the film as a possible subject for a similar chronicle.) No, this is not a revealing longitudinal portrait full of intimate details. Actually, if revealing or intimate, it is about Mikhalkov himself, as might be expected, knowing his ego. And about the vast drama of contemporary history unfolding as the background to the chronicle. With, of course, Mikhalkov’s commentary and preaching (and preaching) throughout. We hear of the Mikhalkov and Konchalovsky backgrounds, of his dear mother and her death, of his own happy childhood, especially at New Year’s.\n\n32\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nIn part I guess his strategy was to use Anna’s banal responses as evidence of the totalitarian state having captured her mind and soul. She fears wrong answers and worries about Brezhnev’s health and peace and war. He had just finished Oblomov and began formulating the film in terms of Iliusha and Anna—and where did their convergence separate? (The opening shots of field and stream recalled immediately Oblomov and Burnt). They were both children of privilege growing up in Empires. He uses a lot of Oblomov footage throughout to parallel the chronicle. His conclusion: the divergence is accounted for by the loss of faith and God. (Does this mean the Tsarist Empire had God?) (The Soviet Empire had everything, he says, except God). Narrated by M. in that sentimental slavophilic style. Shot, he says, or the press kit says, when home movies were forbidden. Mistake here: not home movies, but state resources (film stock, crews, archive footage, etc.) used without authorization is what was dangerous about the venture. Best parts, as usual, the documentary footage: a particularly pathetic episode—a trembling aged Suslov pins, tries to pin, I think Hero of the Soviet Union medal on Brezhnev’s medal-heavy chest. (Kosygin glowers in the background.) The film, without Anna, could easily have stood up as a chronicle of those fateful years, from Brezhnev’s doddering days and his death through the deaths of Andropov and Chernenko through Gorbo and perestroika and the coup and the death of the Soviet Union and the (what he sees as) moral Western-influenced degeneration of Russian society. The official public bombast of those years. A shot from a Lenin film. Pioneers. “Let there always be sunshine…” Brezhnev can hardly speak. Gorbo’s provincial rhetoric (though M. admires for his achievement), and Yeltsin (a new Boss). Great shots of Red Square protesters shouting Resign! A sad Gorbo announces resignation. And no one, M. comments, fills his tea-cup. Interesting also: banned footage from M.’s Kinfolk, referring to Afghanistan. And brief cuts of Russian soldier defectors. A recurring image—a group of workers, waiting, waiting. Russian people’s patience. The public life and the different private one. At her last interview Anna, bound for Switzerland, talks of her\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n33\n\nlove for this field, this wood and, with his prodding, says it’s “better here” in our rodina, as a tear falls. Then: Nadya. Back to Anna: long shot walking down a road, her back to us. (An earlier touching moment: his son cries and turns away when queried on camera; M. comforts him fatherly.) NB, he drives up to his dacha in his Mercedes. All a testament to “the mysterious Russian soul.” Repeat: Best as a documentary of contemporary history, and certainly not as a portrait of his daughter.\n\nThe Thief: A Film by Pavel Chukhrai, 1998 (on video) My general reaction was that this is a well-made “popular” film (with possible metaphoric overtones), but rather conventionalmelodramatic. A husband-less woman gives birth to a son on a dismal plain just after the War. We see them six years later on a train when their compartment is rudely entered by a handsome swaggering Captain in uniform who wastes no time in seducing the beautiful Katya. Sanya, the gorgeous little boy (who compares favorably with Kolya of Kolya) is transfixed by Tolyan—is he his real father? (In an early scene the boy imagines his father on the caboose of a train. This is repeated.). They are now a family and arrive in an unnamed town where they settle in a communalka. Sanya resents this wedge between him and his mother as they dance and make love (they shut the door on him during love-making). He begins getting into trouble, but “dad” stands up for him, and shows him how to be tough with bullies. He dazzles him with his Stalin tattoo (“my father”) on his breast, and a jaguar on his shoulder. Oh, Tolyan is quite a charmer; he dances, plays the accordion, is generous…. but really, a talented con-man who gets the people in the apartment tickets to the circus. While they attend he empties the apartment of valuables. Katya objects but she is fatally hitched to him and his destiny. The three leave hurriedly. Next stop: the Black Sea (where he ignores a checkpoint shout for him to stop), and where they once again settle in as a family. This time he seduces a lonely neighbor so he can raid her apartment while she is at the movies with Katya. (He has\n\n34\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nSanya assist him in getting in.) Another get-away, but this time he is nabbed and jailed. Momma dies. Sanya is sent to an orphanage. As an adolescent he meets a wrecked alcoholic Tolik-drifter who doesn’t recognize him. With the pistol he saved (along with Stalin’s photo) he shoots him, fatally it appears. Next Sanya is a professional soldier in the killing fields of Chechnya. Is the old crazed man he meets Tolyan? No. He boards a train; a beautiful young woman asks for vodka (not to drink; for her infant). He gazes on the two; full circle. The retro feel of the period well captured. Is it a subliminal spoof on Fate of a Man, and/or Ballad of a Soldier, or other Soviet films glorifying the ordinary soldier-Ivan? Some nice touches: • Stalin toasts at dinners. • Prisoners transferred to Black Marias; they run a gauntlet of guards and guard-dogs as their women watch and shriek. Here Sanya yells Papka! (as in Fate of a Man?). • The feel of a Soviet train. • Twice: as boy and adolescent Sanya pees in his pants in Tolyan’s powerful presence. • The recurring song: La Paloma • A regular feature of Soviet films: the big dinner table loaded with food, drink, and merriment. • Russian-film fascination with trains. • Is his neighbor-victim stereotypically Jewish (big nose, sensuous, vulgar, rich)? • The anti-hero. Or, hero as rogue. (Mashkov is clearly a boxoffice heart-throb, à la Menshikov.) Up for academy award as best foreign-language film, but so far (March, 1998) no theatrical release here. Who was it that told me it was one of the best Russian films s/he had seen?\n\nBrigands, Chapter VII: A Film by Otar Ioseliani 3/29/98, Anthology Film Archives\n\nA multiple-source production (French, Georgian, Russian), ditto the cast. Locations in Georgia and Paris.\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n35\n\nA disappointment: too long, too dull. The unimpeachable impulse is to mock men’s follies and violence through the ages. We see medieval fighting aristocrats and their women (in Georgia?), the Bolsheviks/Chekists in the first years of Soviet rule (in Georgia), and the everyday street violence of civil war today, also in Georgia. All these centuries of bloodshed and greed have led only to more bloodshed and greed, its latest manifestations courtesy the new Mafiosi of the post-Soviet era. Naturally, Ios. chooses the absurdist style to show this within an unconventional structure—the episodes mix with one another, the same characters appear in each (men never change), and the whole thing is presented as a film within the film. At the outset, after the silent-film style credits, we see a vulgar crowd of strip poker players carousing; just as a woman tears off her bra, a young man from another room enters with an Uzi and mows them all down (even children are infected)—hold it, a woman tells a projectionist, you’ve shown the last reel first (a special screening for a group of big-wigs, smokers all; Ioseliani’s producers?). Then the film (within the film) begins—with the comic/absurdist street violence complete with tanks, high-powered rifles, and artillery (could apply to Sarajevo) in Georgia. The omnipresent hero (with a nose like Akhmatova’s) wends his way unemotionally through all of this, revealing another trademark of the film—the matter-of-fact way everybody goes about their business killing, torturing, executing. Victims, too, are unemotional. (Yes, we do hear screams in the Cheka cellars.) Very reminiscent of Rogozhkin’s The Chekist, and especially of Jansco’s The Red and the White. Another stylistic affectation: speaking in soft mumbles, when anyone speaks at all. Then back and forth in time, but always the same cruelties. With sword and axe if not AK-47s. The longest sequence involves the Red takeover and rule in Georgia. A pickpocket is recruited by the revolutionaries—we are communists they tell him, oh yes, he says, “freedom, happiness…” He becomes a commissar in the new regime (shades of Kamo and Koba-Stalin and the Caucasian bank raids organized by the Bolsheviks). Apartments are expropriated and re-expropriated, a father instructs a Pioneer-son on the instruments of torture and allows him to watch a session. “Was it interesting?” his mother asks. Silently he demonstrates nose pincers, ear\n\n36\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\ngouging. But Pioneer also informs on his father and teacher (Pavlik Morozov!). Amusing sections here and there—an opera rehearsal, with Lenin and Krupskaya singing an aria, is interrupted by the arrest of Lenin. Later we see orchestra seats empty; players depleted by repressions. (In this sequence they speak Russian.) But all of this is shooting fish in a barrel…. Everyman appears in Paris, a clochard. (A survivor.) Meanwhile the New Russians when they are not killing each other are taking French lessons and learning the art of wine-tasting. (Mercedeses, Chrysler New Yorkers). The final sequence sees the young man calmly calling the police to inform them of what he has just done. (The West is corrupt and deranged too?) Some cute parts ribald and Monty Python-like in the Middle Ages section involving a virginal iron girdle. At the end (phew!) the camera pans across the eternal mountain-filled horizon…. [Evidently the subtitle refers to his seventh film; all have been about Brigands.]\n\nA Friend of the Deceased A Film by Vyacheslav Krishtofovich 4/17/98, Sony Screening Room\n\nI was very impressed by K’s last film seen here, Adam’s Rib, and looked forward to this (see my review in Chapter IV). I wasn’t disappointed, but certain things got in the way and kept the film from being as successful as Rib. Present were the same lyrical-melancholic tones, but with none of the humor; rather not—this had a strong dark narrative; but the pastels were there, as was the simple sad sound track with its solo flute, solo piano, solo sax, and at the end, over the credits, solo voice in a plaintive folk song. It is today’s Kiev, where the young seem to be having a good time but others are in trouble, like the hero, the sad, dark, brooding, handsome Tolya (Alexander Lazarev—where have I seen him before?), an intellectual (translator) having a tough time finding\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n37\n\ndecent-paying work and watching his marriage disintegrate—his wife is having an affair with someone at work. We never see him, but he has a flashy red Ford, symbolic of the aggressive “New Russians” or New Ukrainians who know how to make a “back” (they use the original in referring to money). He feels humiliated interpreting for a businessman (a nice scene: a tough dealer exacts a good price for oranges from an Indian exporter). Tolya runs into an old friend Dima who does well as a salesman at a shop with imported consumer items like Absolut. They drink together (a lot of drinking goes on) and Tolya lets him in on his wife’s cheating. Simple solution says Dima; he has a friend who will off him for a price. (In today’s Ukraine everything, including murder is a business deal.) He wouldn’t think of such a thing, but when the guy calls him, he doesn’t reject his proposal and remembers the details—a photograph of the intended victim, the bucks, and where and when the target hangs out, all to be placed in a postal box (query: would this professional killer reveal these instructions on the phone? or maybe he’s not such a professional? The latter is plausible given what we see later, but maybe it’s an irrelevant detail—it’s very dramatic to only hear the killer on the phone—he sounds smart and very cool.). Now here is the fascinating, Dostoevskyan twist on which the whole film should turn: Tolya, at the end of his rope, decides to offer himself as the victim. He has himself photographed, places the essentials in the postal box, and waits to be murdered at his favorite café. But he is fated to live: the café shuts down to accommodate a private birthday party. Now plastered, he celebrates his accidental reprieve from his self-imposed death sentence and picks up a jaunty young (and overplayed) prostitute for a night of sex— mercifully K. doesn’t show us the usual boring scenes in bed, but he does reveal a lot of her flesh. The twist continues: he can’t call off the original deal; it’s just not done. Now he has to save himself from his own contract. His solution is to find another professional killer to knock off the first. He does, and it is done successfully. (The second killer is an older guy, an Afghan who does his executions with a six-inch knife.) Now what? This is where the two elements of the film—his deep disaffection, and the thriller part, both working nicely together—\n\n38\n\nMoscow Believes in Tears\n\nget scattered into a mess of new plot lines and characters, including a mawkish turn. The title of the film suggests that what turns up at the end, and offers an open-ended resolution, is really what the story should have been about. It is this: Overcome with sadness at what he has done, and having sifted through the dead killer’s wallet (of course, a photograph of the wife and kid is there), he visits the widow, telling her he owed her husband some money. Naturally, she is very young and very beautiful and very grateful and very lonely with a cute young toddler to take care of, and what a way to wrap it up…. But not so fast: 1) Dima’s shop is firebombed; 2) Vika the hooker reports physical abuse—I’ll have him bumped off Tolya decides—he arranges it with his guy (whom we see again rather bitter and remorseful looking, sitting on a river bank fishing); 3) finding another “contract” in the postal box, he warns the intended victim of the coming hit. All of this—overpopulation, excessive plots and story turns, and multiple possible endings, and several codas aggregate to undercut what could have been the neat concentrated power of the film, yet another example of the esthetic of the excess all too often wounding otherwise good efforts. (The otherwise is a real pity here because the film is so well made, with an economy of dialogue, fine acting, and effective, quiet camera work—medium shots especially.) The press notes emphasize K’s dissatisfaction with the crass current post-Soviet scene. In the old days, he argues, warm friendships made life bearable. Now business and profit rule. So his intent is to make a chernukha film about the present. I can do without this low-intensity nostalgia for Soviet times, though there is considerable merit in just showing how difficult it is for many— especially the sensitive “weak” types like Tolya—to fit in. Oddly, the overall mood of the film and its main character reminded me of the Cuban film, Memories of Underdevelopment. Oddly, because in the latter it is the socialist revolution that has destroyed the old society, an inverse of what has happened here. Some items: • He wears a cross. Throughout there are shots of the domes of churches. Cf. especially the beautiful opening shot of the gold\n\nI Found It at the Movies\n\n39\n\ndomes in medium range, then the camera pulling back to Tolya at his desk working the phone. The sad lyrical tone set at the start. • Nice, underplayed set-up: we know with very little shown that he is disoriented and dispirited, and that his marriage is in trouble (they are not sleeping togethe"
