        "text": "\"Anyone without a car dreams of buying one. And anyone who’s got a car dreams of selling it, but doesn’t do it just because once it’s sold, you are left without a car. A human being, more than any other living creature, likes to create himself as many problems as possible. That’s the only reason to wish to have a car of your own.

Initially, Yuri Nikulin was invited to play this character (he declined), as well as Oleg Efremov (he eventually earned the second main role), and Leonid Kuravlev (the commission didn't like him). They didn't, however, show a childish spontaneity or a sense that they were slightly out of this world, which were key features for Detochkin's character.\n\nSmoktunovskiy was exhausted after playing Lenin in two films at…"
