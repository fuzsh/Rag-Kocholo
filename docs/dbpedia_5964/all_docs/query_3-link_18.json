Some people prefer to spend their time actively, but others just want to sit at home and watch their favorite films. \"Forum\" offers the TOP 10 holiday films in Russian. Of course, you have already seen most of these pictures. But, as they say, classics can be reviewed several times.\n\nIrony of Fate or Enjoy Your Bath!\n\nThis is perhaps the most popular film in the New Year holidays. The story of how a doctor from Moscow, Zhenya Lukashin, went on New Year's Eve with his friends to a bath, and then quite by chance ended up on a plane.

On New Year's Eve, when the workers of the House of Culture are ready to launch a perfectly rehearsed entertainment program, Comrade Ogurtsov intervenes in the creative process. He has been appointed acting director. Ogurtsov categorically does not like the program of performances, and he decides to replace the “frivolous” numbers with more “serious” ones. Many people probably remember what came of it. And the song “Five Minutes” performed by Lyudmila Gurchenko became a popular hit. In 2006, the film “Carnival Night 2” was released.\n\nZigzag of Luck\n\nThis is another comedy directed by Eldar Ryazanov. Employees of the fashion studio Sovremennik are going to celebrate the New Year. They want to use public money from the mutual aid fund to organize a festive table.

Once upon a time there lived a good, kind girl Nastenka. Her evil stepmother forced her to work constantly. One day, the stepmother decided to get rid of her stepdaughter and sent the girl into the winter forest. And there Nastenka met her beloved Ivan. But, if not for the help of the good wizard Morozko, the fate of the main characters could have turned out differently.\n\nEvenings on a Farm Near Dikanka\n\nThis film adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's novel “The Night Before Christmas” was released almost 50 years ago. The action takes place on the eve of Christmas. A merry story about how on the Christmas night in the Ukrainian village everyone was beguiled by a demon and how the mighty blacksmith Vakula managed to overcome evil spirits.\n\nPoor Sasha\n\nLyrical New Year's comedy directed by Tigran Keosayan.
