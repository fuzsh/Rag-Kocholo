In February 1888â€“just one month after the Societyâ€™s founding and before the first published National Geographic magazineâ€“explorer John Wesley Powell inaugurated the speakers series by delivering a talk about the physical geography of the United States.\n\nVery quickly the Society began attracting explorers eager to tell their stories, including Fridtjof Nansen, an Artic explorer; Gifford Pinchot, founder of the U.S. Forest Service; and mountaineer Annie S. Peck, who told of climbing peaks in the Alps and volcanoes in Mexico. Thousands gathered to hear Roald Amundsen, soon to be the first man to reach the South Pole, discuss his recent navigation of the Northwest Passage.\n\nPhoto credits (from top of page): Sam Kittner, Jeanne Modderman, Sam Kittner, Mark Thiessen, Kris Ugarriza, John Landino, Terry Virts, National Geographic, Brian Skerry, John Landino, Mark Synnott"
