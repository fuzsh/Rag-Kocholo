        "text": "From the very beginning we were meant to take on only technical tasks for the exhibition project, commemorating the 90th anniversary of famous Russian film director Eldar Ryazanov. But as we became part of the team we participated more and more in reviewing and rebuilding of the whole concept, graphic solutions and its realization. Finally, due to some tragic circumstances we had to take on the full scope of work — from re-thinking the concept to the realization. When we have started from scratch, the time were pressing: we had around 70 days only until opening and a huge space over 1 200 sq.m in the New Manege exhibition center in the center of Moscow to fill.\n\nAt the pre-production stage we created interaction scenarios for all installations, wrote a lot of detailed scenarios for content development and made sketches and storyboards for further content production. Those were agreed upon with the director’s widow, E.V. Abaidullina-Ryazanova, who, along with the Foundation of Eldar Ryazanov assisted and enormously helped us at all stages of the work on the exhibition. After all of this work was approved, we turned to the production. At this stage we made different multimedia and graphic content, exclusive style of the exhibition and indoor navigation. At the same time, we ordered technical and multimedia equipment.\n\nThe main hall was filled with exhibits from Ryazanov’s movies and presented him as film director. There were a lot of requisite, recreated setting scenes, hand-written screenplays, real objects from some legendary movies: a huge 2 m in diameter watch from ‘The Carnival Night’ (1956), which we found at Mosfilm warehouse and had to restore, the Volga car once driven by Yuri Detochkin, the main character of the ‘Beware of the Car’ (1966). We also have found lots of original costumes from the film sets, such as iconic pieces of clothes from Russian cult movie ‘The Irony of Fate’ (1976). To show authentic costumes from Ryazanov’s films we put them above the huge lightbox with sketches of the characters who wore these outfits in movies that backlit them for a better appearance.\n\nWe also found some space for tiny cinema: two screensplacedopposite, a sound system and numerous padded stools made this small isolated room for 20 spectators an ideal place for watching all of the Ryazanov’smovies, shown on schedule. Light and sound from the outside were blocked by thick curtains. The medium hall contained artefacts and installations related to other sides of Ryazanov’s creative heritage. One of such installation deployed some old Soviet era telephones that rung times to time. A visitor who, will pick up the phone, could listen to a random Ryazanov’s poem read by the author himself. On the other side of the wall, dividing the space in half, there were 5 old Soviet tube TVs, which we modified so that the audience, switching the channels, could see one of the television programs of popular Soviet TV show ‘Cinema-Panorama’, which Ryazanov was the permanent author and host for many years. It is funny that due to their age, TV sets could not work all day from the opening to the close of the exhibition for a month, and were switching off beyond repair. Taking this into account, we prepared 2 more replacement TVs — nevertheless, by the end of the exhibition, only 4 of 5 were working anyway.\n\nThe last exhibition space was dedicated to Ryazanov’s biography. We aimed to make this experience more personal. That’s why the entourage of the director’s flat full of books, watches, paintings, collections and other artefacts was the best choice to immerse visitors into every-day real life of the director.We used a large number of Soviet-style furniture sets, so-called ‘stenka’. Stenkas, familiar to every Soviet person also echoed with the director’s films. For those furniture pieces, along with other replicas of the common objects of the Soviet lifestyle, such as telephones, typewriters, etc., we searched for at flea markets and bought by ads in newspapers. After that, we modeled them in 3D and assembled from them a display case located in the center of the hall, which we painted in neutral white. On the shelves inside the cabinets and around we placed the exhibits. We could not find some rare pieces such as movie cameras and film projectors of the 1950s, but our colleagues from the Open Funds of the Moscow Polytechnic Museum came to the rescue here, providing them to us for the duration of the exhibition, for which we would like to bring special thanks to Natalia Sergievskaya, who responded to our cry for help on Facebook. We also placed objects from the Ryazanov collections on the walls: wall clocks and painted wooden boards. Some of the objects with special value, such as paintings, we projected onto the walls. We also hung Ryazanov’s personal belongings on the dressing hooks at the wall, such as his jacket and a handbag.\n\nThe next installation — ‘Typewriter’ combined projection of the screenplay of ‘Beware of the Car’ with the related scenes from the movie. It led visitors deeper into the personal and creative world of EldarRyazanov. In it, we wanted to reflect how the scripts of Ryazanov turned into films: under the sound of keys, a sheet of the script «Beware of the car» crawled out of the typewriter was projected onto the wall, the letters of which turned into a scene from the film.\n\nThe so-called ‘Virtual Tour’ was the most impressive multimedia installation of the whole project. By using 14 projectors and ScreenBerry media serverswe have shown a 34-minutes story of EldarRyazanov’s life. The inspiration of this installation we found in his autobiography. We also collected numerous interesting and obscure facts and anecdotes of his life, based on which we wrote a script for the virtual tour that consisted of 11 chapters. Our next step was to ask Ryazanov’s favorite actors and friends to take part. Such movie stars as Oleg Basilashvili, LiyaAkhedzhakova, SvetlanaNemolyaeva, AleksandrShirvindt and, Nikolai Fomenkoagreed to participate in the project.\n\nThe last chapter was conceived as a metaphoric farewell to the director, who, according to our idea, did not just leave the Earth but moved to a small planet (asteroid 4258), that was opened on September 1, 1987 and in fact named after him. He lives on it, like the Little Prince, and watches us from afar. We decided to implement this idea with the help of video mapping technology. To do this, we made a hemisphere resembling the surface of an asteroid, fixed it on the wall and projected content onto it — the texture of the planet and the figure of Ryazanov on it. With the help of 3D graphics, we reproduced the features of the director’s face, worked through his various emotions, recreated his walk and the algorithm of his movements."
