        "text": "About the ASME Nuclear Quality Assurance Program\n\nThe ASME Nuclear Quality Assurance (NQA-1) Certification Program provides centralized, independent, third-party certification for quality assurance programs in conformance with the ASME NQA-1 standard, \"Quality Assurance Requirements for Nuclear Facility Applications\". It entails a full audit of the Quality Assurance Program performed by trained ASME auditors with an extensive background in quality assurance. A successful audit will yield a NQA-1 Quality Program Certificate.Example of a nuclear facilities can include reactors such as, nuclear power plants (NPP), small modular reactors (SMR), microreactors, and advanced reactors, and the handling of radioactive and/or fissionable materials for fuel processing, and fuel recycling.\n\nThe ASME NQA-1 Certification Program seeks to meet the needs of the nuclear industry by expanding the supply chain with organizations who are committed to understanding quality and providing high quality products and services."
