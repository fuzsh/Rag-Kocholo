        "text": "We brought quantum computing to life by activating the senses, allowing our audiences to see, hear and touch what promises to be the future of computing.\n\nSee: In a Facebook Live with two of our top quantum computing researchers, over 4 million people tuned in to see and learn about the technology.\n\nHear: We released an ASMR video that allowed people to go inside the lab and hear the “tinkling whoosh” made by the system.\n\nTouch” We created a physical experience, bringing a prototype system to CES, where reporters could get up close and touch a quantum computer. The prototype is now on the road, giving more people the chance to experience our quantum computer in person.\n\nThink of this like our space program – we’re bringing media and others in at the very early stages of development for a technology with the promise to change the world.\n\nSince IBM Q’s launch in March 2017, we’ve reached a global audience of press, analysts and influencers about each successive quantum computer system advancement and breakthrough: IBM Q as the first universal quantum computers for science and business; the first public, cloud-enabled quantum computer systems; the first commercial universal quantum computer systems; the first prototype 50-qubit quantum computer in the world; and a new quantum startup program.\n\nWe supported each announcement with tactics to help bring quantum to life by activating the senses, allowing our audiences to see, hear and touch this new paradigm of computing:\n\nSee: a Facebook Live with IBM Research scientists in our quantum lab.\n\nHear: ASMR “Sounds of IBM Q” video that allows people to go inside the lab and hear the system’s “tinkling whoosh.”\n\nTouch: Unveiled prototype 50-quibit “monolith” system at CES. Included in Mashable’s “CES’ Best of 2018” list.\n\nEarned and owned media contributed to business outcomes:\n\n• 82K+ users ran 3 million+ experiments on IBM Q quantum devices. 60+ research publications written based on the technology.\n\n• July 2017 - March 2018 - IBM led competitive share of voice in social media and on-line news about quantum computing. Comparison conducted using Sysomos.\n\nEarned Media:\n\n• 700+ earned media stories about IBM Q quantum computing advancements in top publications from 20+ countries, including NYT, WSJ, CNBC, USA Today, Nikkei, BBC, and Financial Times.\n\n• MIT Tech Review feature on the state of \"serious\" quantum computers; IBM Q in list of \"Top 10\" 2018 breakthroughs.\n\n• Nature (influential science journal) cover story featured IBM Q research simulating the largest molecule by a quantum computer.\n\n• The WSJ's Future of Everything podcast featured IBM Q scientists and tours of IBM Q labs for two-part quantum computing episode.\n\n• Bloomberg Markets feature on quantum focused on IBM's progress.\n\nOwned media convened a digital dialogue:\n\n• IBM Q Facebook Live – 4M views, 10,717 reactions/comments/shares--more than any other IBM FB Live\n\n• \"Sounds of IBM Q\", an ASMR video, earned media coverage in Quartz, The Verge, and Popular Mechanics (826K views, 10,200+ reactions/comments/shares across social platforms)\n\n• #IBMQ hashtag campaign shared 18,314+ times\n\n• Launched search-optimized quantum education page. Increased its search ranking to the top 3 organic spots for key terms such as quantum computing. Competitiveness of the search term 'quantum computing,' as ranked by Serpstat, is rated ‘very difficult.’\n\nWe implemented a comprehensive media and influencer strategy to explain quantum computing and demonstrate our progress toward making it a physical reality.\n\n- Positioned our IBM Q Experience system as the only real quantum computer, available to the public over the cloud – appealing to scientists, academics, developers, and technical press.\n\n- Promoted IBM Q commercial systems as the only real quantum computers being applied to solve practical industry problems – targeting Fortune 500 companies, academic institutions, national research labs and the mainstream media.\n\n- Aligned with influential academic organizations - including MIT, Oxford University, Keio University, and the University of Melbourne - who share our vision of the promise of quantum computing, and who can help advocate on our behalf.\n\n- Targeted Silicon Valley investors, VCs and startups, announcing a new program that gives startup companies access to the IBM Q Network and further broadening access to quantum computing."
