        "text": "Capgemini has inked a deal with IBM to become an \"IBM Quantum Hub.\" The French SI will provide access to IBM's quantum computing systems as well as professional services. Capgemini will set up an in-house quantum technology team to develop quantum technologies the consulting giant has announced.\n\nThe collaboration with IBM also includes ways to help IBM & customers build their own services in the area of Quantum Computing.\n\nThe Quantum Lab (Q-Lab) of the French systems integrator is comprised of quantum technology experts and operates in UK, Portugal, and India to help users utilize the potential of quantum technologies.\n\nThe Q-Lab of Capgemini will coordinate research programs to develop business-driven client propositions for sectors that are most likely to benefit from the use of the quantum technologies shortly, such as life sciences, financial services, automotive, and aerospace.\n\nPascal Brier, the chief innovation officer at Capgemini and member of the group executive committee, stated, “The launch of our Q-lab tangibly demonstrates our ambition to bring our clients the most innovative, breakthrough solutions, and to invest in capabilities early on so we can become the leading quantum systems integrator.”\n\n“Our collaboration with IBM will enable us to explore the vast potential of quantum computing, bringing our clients the top capabilities and skills available in the market today and tomorrow.”\n\nWay Ahead\n\nThe deal will enable the customers of Capgemini to access the quantum computing systems of IBM, including IBM’s recently announced 127 qubit processor, “Eagle” along with IBM’s quantum expertise and Qiskit, the open source quantum software development kit by IBM.\n\nThe deal will see the IBM Quantum team and clients researching and exploring how quantum computing will aid an array of industries and disciplines such as Energy, Material Science, Finance, Chemistry, and Machine Learning.\n\nThrough this agreement, Capgemini will facilitate clients to access IBM’s licensed technology and provide them with professional services for end-to-end implementation.\n\nThe company also intends to demonstrate with prototypes and proofs and concepts, the potential value of leveraging quantum technologies to tackle previously intractable business problems for clients, working for the implementation of quantum computing use cases.\n\nAccording to Jay Gambetta, IBM Fellow and VP, Quantum Computing, “Establishing a quantum industry will require a deep focus on expanding the quantum computing ecosystem across public and private sectors – something IBM cannot do alone.\n\nBy working with Capgemini, clients have even more options for hands-on expertise to develop proofs of concepts to explore the potential of quantum computing across a variety of industries and disciplines.”\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is headquartered in Armonk, New York, and specializes in areas such as Cloud, Mobile, Cognitive Intelligence, Watson, Commerce, Experience Design, Systems Services, Resiliency Services, Financing, Internet of Things (IoTs) & IT Infrastructure.\n\nFounded in the year 1911, IBM is the largest technology and consulting employer in the world with more than 350,000 employees serving clients in more than 170 countries. With Watson, the AI platform for business, powered by data, IBM is building industry-based solutions to real-world problems.\n\nAbout Capgemini\n\nCapgemini is headquartered in Paris, France. The company specializes in Outsourcing, Process Consulting, Package Based Solutions, Custom Solution Development, Application Management, Business Information Management, Cloud, Digital, and Managed Services. Capgemini partners with companies to help them transform and manage their business by harnessing the power of technology. The company is a responsible and diverse organization of 300,000 team members in nearly 50 countries. Clients trust Capgemini to address the entire breadth of their business needs from strategy and design to operations, fueled by the fast-evolving and innovative world of cloud, data, AI, connectivity, software, and digital engineering. Their latest innovative streak is the deal with IBM to step into the area of Quantum Computing. The Group reported in 2020 global revenues of €16 billion."
