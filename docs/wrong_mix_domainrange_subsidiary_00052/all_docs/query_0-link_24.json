At QCaMP, you will get a primer on the fundamentals of computing, learn hands-on the oftentimes perplexing phenomena of quantum physics, and apply those phenomena to solve computing problems in new ways.\n\nParticipants will gain experience creating circuits on a real-world quantum computer and gain access to resources to bring quantum concepts into the classroom. The only prerequisites for this camp are basic algebra and an interest in learning more!\n\nQCaMP 2024 will be a 4-week-long camp aimed at the high school student level. A separate 3-day camp will be held for high school teachers. We hope you’ll join us in the upcoming summer!"
