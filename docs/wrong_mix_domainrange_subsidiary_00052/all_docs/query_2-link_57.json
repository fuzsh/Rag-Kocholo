        "text": "KAIST has joined the IBM Q Network, a community of Fortune 500 companies, academic institutions, startups, and research labs working with IBM to advance quantum computing for business and science.\n\nAs the IBM Q Network’s first academic partner in Korea, KAIST will use IBM's advanced quantum computing systems to carry out research projects that advance quantum information science and explore early applications. KAIST will also utilize IBM Quantum resources for talent training and education in preparation for building a quantum workforce for the quantum computing era that will bring huge changes to science and business. By joining the network, KAIST will take a leading role in fostering the ecosystem of quantum computing in Korea, which is expected to be a necessary enabler to realize the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nProfessor June-Koo Rhee who also serves as Director of the KAIST Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) of Quantum Computing for AI has led the agreement on KAIST’s joining the IBM Q Network. Director Rhee described quantum computing as \"a new technology that can calculate mathematical challenges at very high speed and low power” and also as “one that will change the future.”\n\nDirector Rhee said, “Korea started investment in quantum computing relatively late, and thus requires to take bold steps with innovative R&D strategies to pave the roadmap for the next technological leap in the field”. With KAIST joining the IBM Q Network, “Korea will be better equipped to establish a quantum industry, an important foundation for securing national competitiveness,” he added.\n\nThe KAIST ITRC of Quantum Computing for AI has been using the publicly available IBM Quantum Experience delivered over the IBM Cloud for research, development and training of quantum algorithms such as quantum artificial intelligence, quantum chemical calculation, and quantum computing education.\n\nKAIST will have access to the most advanced IBM Quantum systems to explore practical research and experiments such as diagnosis of diseases based on quantum artificial intelligence, quantum computational chemistry, and quantum machine learning technology. In addition, knowledge exchanges and sharing with overseas universities and companies under the IBM Q Network will help KAIST strengthen the global presence of Korean technology in quantum computing.\n\nAbout IBM Quantum\n\nIBM Quantum is an industry-first initiative to build quantum systems for business and science applications.
