        "text": "Quantum computers run on multi-state components called qubits, which can reach the “superposition” of essentially being both one and zero while also “entangling” in combined states. In lay terms, that means quantum computers can do lots of things classical computers can’t, including crunching massive amounts of complex information faster and simulating molecules.\n\nAt this point, quantum computing applications are garnering increased attention and anticipation, but wide-scale use itself remains a ways off.\n\nAn increasing number of companies — like the ones below — are trying to close the gap between present and future. When quantum computing is perfected, it will transform a host of industries.\n\nQuantum Computing Companies to Know\n\nTech mainstay IBM is a leader in quantum research, having developed various quantum-specific technologies and software for research, including quantum SDK Qiskit. IBM also hosts quantum data centers where clients can access quantum computing systems in-person. In 2023, IBM unveiled the IBM Quantum System Two, the world’s first modular utility-scale quantum computer system, which aims to act as a building block for quantum supercomputing.\n\nIn 2019, Google announced it had achieved quantum supremacy, the power of quantum computers to perform tasks that classical computers can’t. The company has taken strides to advance quantum technology through efforts such as Google Quantum AI, a lab which develops quantum hardware and software, and Cirq, an open-source quantum programming framework. Hartmut Neven, director of the tech giant’s Quantum AI lab, told Quanta that quantum computers are growing “doubly exponential” where “it looks like nothing is happening, nothing is happening, and then whoops, suddenly you’re in a different world.”\n\nWhile most quantum-computing research hitches its qubits to the superconductor/solid-state wagon or, to a lesser degree, trapped ions, Microsoft rolls along a third route: topological qubits. These qubits would sidestep so many pesky stability requisites by splitting an electron — essentially, double anti-interference protection — and exhibiting two ground states (a.k.a. ground state degeneracy). We say “would,” however, because the process still remains strictly theoretical, but the physical building blocks are there, as discovered by Microsoft.\n\nIntel has been seriously exploring quantum computing since at least 2015, when it partnered with research group QuTech. Its focus lies on creating quantum computer chips and software, as seen in its Tunnel Falls silicon spin qubit chip and its Intel Quantum SDK. As for the long term, according to its director of quantum hardware, Intel is eyeing nothing less than a million-qubit system — the number at which truly transformational power will occur.\n\nRead Next5 Quantum Computing Careers and How to Break Into Them\n\nNVIDIA is helping boost quantum computing innovation by creating quantum hardware and software solutions. The NVIDIA Quantum Cloud is an ecosystem of quantum computing tools, including NVIDIA CUDA-Q, a platform for developing hybrid classical-quantum computers and quantum processors (QPUs), emulations, GPUs and CPUs into one system. NVIDIA also provides quantum SDK and architecture products, known as NVIDIA cuQuantum and NVIDIA DGX Quantum, respectively.\n\nD-Wave Systems delivers quantum computing solutions to industries such as manufacturing, finance and life sciences. This includes Leap, a cloud platform providing real-time quantum computer access, and Advantage, a quantum system built for business applications. In 2022, D-Wave announced its Advantage2 quantum computer prototype with over 500 qubits.\n\nWhen XPRIZE founder Peter Diamandis listed what he believes to be the three “major players” in the push toward quantum supremacy in America, he named Google and IBM and one startup: Rigetti Computing. Rigetti works to build quantum computing parts, from chips and control systems to superconducting qubit-based quantum processors. Its 9-qubit QPU, titled Novera, features a square lattice of qubits for two-qubit operations, and is available for order. Rigetti’s technology has partnered with names like NASA, MIT and Oxford Instruments.\n\nAs its name hints, Atom Computing develops quantum computing systems using qubits made from neutral atoms, described by Science as a “dark horse candidate” in the quantum-computing field. The company bills itself as the first to exceed 1,000 qubits in a quantum system, doing so by controlling its qubits wirelessly with lasers. Atom hopes its novel approach will lead to scalable beyond-supercomputers that advance pharmaceutical research, computational chemistry and more.\n\nRelated10 Quantum Computing Applications and Examples\n\nIt’s tempting to reduce quantum computing to a simple numbers game, namely number of total qubits. The truth is, you have to consider qubit quality rather than mere quantity. Still, when IonQ bested the qubit counts of IBM (50) and Google (72) in 2018 with its 160-qubit processor, jaws dropped. Whereas most QC companies employ superconductors, IonQ is pioneering the trapped-ion method through which ions are isolated in a vacuum chamber and subatomic particles are cooled via lasers, eliminating the need for the gigantic copper-looking contraptions that are common to quantum computers.\n\nFounded by three veterans of Yale’s applied physics department, Quantum Circuits unveiled its testing facility in 2019. The cofounders are considered trailblazers in quantum computing with superconducting circuits, and the company is illustrative of the science-meeting-tech, academia-meeting-big-business cross-pollination that marks the quest for quantum supremacy.\n\nToshiba’s Quantum Key Distribution program is working to solve security problems that quantum computers could potentially bring about. Toshiba’s quantum cryptography solutions have been in the works since 2003, when the company invested time at the Cambridge Research Laboratory of Toshiba Research Europe Limited. According to its website, Toshiba’s quantum key distribution was the first to reach over 100 kilometers of fiber as well as the first company exceeding 1 Mbit per second with a continuous key rate.\n\nRelatedQuantum Computing Has Entered the Logical Qubit Era. Why Does That Matter?\n\nAWS, part of Amazon, offers quantum services and resources to help organizations explore quantum computing applications and research. Amazon Braket is one such resource. It’s a fully-managed quantum service that allows users to build, test and run quantum algorithms on different choices of quantum computers. AWS also hosts the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab, AWS Center for Quantum Computing and AWS Center for Quantum Networking, all groups which help accelerate quantum research and expert collaboration.\n\nQuantinuum was formed by the merger between Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum. The company offers solutions for cybersecurity, natural language processing and machine learning. It also offers research partnerships that allow customers to access quantum computers. Some organizations Quantinuum has partnered with include Samsung, Nipton Steel and BMW.\n\nXanadu is a startup notable for exploring photonic quantum computing, which uses the quantum properties of light particles to run. The company released free, open-source software that basically lets anyone run commands on publicly accessible, cloud-based quantum computers, like the IBM Q Experience or the University of Bristol’s Quantum in the Cloud — part of a wider push to familiarize enthusiasts with QC operational basics.\n\nAtos specializes in quantum computing emulations, providing its Quantum Learning Machine as an on-premises hardware environment to simulate and develop quantum software. The Quantum Learning Machine Enhanced version in particular presents up to 12 times of acceleration power to simulate algorithms suited for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) devices. Atos also offers myQLM, a freeware Python package that allows the testing and development of quantum algorithms on any device, as well as Q-score, a quantum metrics reference applicable to all quantum processors.\n\nWhile you can’t exactly hit up TaskRabbit when your quantum computer needs help, service and product support are must-haves for developers. Infleqtion, previously ColdQuanta, manufactures various quantum components like vacuum systems and processors to keep atoms brutally cold, which aids the all-important work of cutting down qubit motion and noise.\n\n1QBit focuses on combining quantum technology to accelerate artificial intelligence capabilities, and vice versa, and solve optimization problems. In 2017, 1QBit also made waves when it partnered with two major players: tech consultants Accenture and biotech multinational Biogen. Quantum computing was used to create a molecular modeling application, which was able to be applied by Biogen and could lead to breakthroughs in drug discovery and development.\n\nA Rigetti partner, ProteinQure uses quantum computing and machine learning to computer-simulate designs for protein-based drugs. The company specializes in small proteins striving to have applications across all major disease indications. According to its website, ProteinQure has partnerships with top pharma companies to aid in drug discovery practices.\n\nA developer of enterprise software for quantum computers, QC Ware counts Citi and Goldman Sachs among its investors. It has also teamed with a number of other outfits, including D-Wave, IBM and, perhaps most notably, Google, whose open-source quantum interface Cirq was integrated into QC Ware’s cloud service.\n\nWilliam Hurley, the serial entrepreneur who heads up Strangeworks, is a serious quantum enthusiast. The company hosts a suite of over 60 quantum resources such as quantum frameworks and management tools to create quantum solutions within the aerospace, energy, pharmaceutical and finance industries.\n\nISARA has emerged as a frontrunner working to solve the issues that quantum computing might cause for RSA security encryption. The company is working to develop quantum-safe cryptography systems that essentially allow communication between classical and quantum algorithms. RSA security encryption relies on prime numbers to secure your information. More specifically, it relies on the fact that prime factorization of large numbers is prohibitively time-consuming for would-be hackers. But if a quantum computer powerful enough to run Shor’s factorization algorithm ever came along, all that security essentially vanishes.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
