        "text": "NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\nNASA Today\n\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery. For more than 65 years, NASA has made the seemingly impossible, possible. At its 20 centers and facilities across the country and with U.S. commercial companies and international partners, NASA leads studying Earth science, including climate, our Sun, solar system, and the larger universe. We conduct cutting-edge research to advance technology and aeronautics. We operate the world’s leading space laboratory, the International Space Station, and will establish a sustainable and strong exploration presence on the Moon this decade through the Artemis campaign.\n\nNASA Centers and Facilities\n\nLooking Forward\n\nNASA’s future will continue to be a story of human exploration, technology, and science. We will go back to the Moon to learn more about what it will take to support human exploration to Mars and beyond. We will continue to nurture the development of a vibrant low-Earth orbit economy that builds on the work done to date by the International Space Station. NASA engineers will develop new technologies to improve air transport at home and meet the challenges of advanced space exploration. Our scientists will work to increase an understanding of our planet and our place in the universe.\n\nNASA Missions\n\nA History of Innovation\n\nWhen NASA opened for business on October 1, 1958, it accelerated the work already started on human and robotic spaceflight, and over the last 65 years it has continued to push the boundaries of aeronautics and space exploration. Now NASA is preparing to take humankind farther than ever before, as it helps to foster a robust commercial space economy near Earth, and pioneers further human and robotic exploration as we venture into deep space.\n\nNASA History\n\nNASA Leadership\n\nAdministrator Bill Nelson\n\nSen. Bill Nelson was sworn in as the 14th NASA Administrator on May 3, 2021, tasked with carrying out the Biden-Harris administration’s vision for the agency. Nelson served in the U.S. Senate for 18 years from Florida and as a payload specialist on space shuttle mission 61-C in 1986.\n\nDeputy Administrator Pam Melroy\n\nCol. (USAF, ret) Pam Melroy was sworn in as the NASA deputy administrator on June 21, 2021. Melroy performs the duties and exercises the powers delegated by the administrator, assists the administrator in making final agency decisions, and acts for the administrator in his absence.\n\nAssociate Administrator James Free\n\nJames Free is the senior advisor to Administrator Bill Nelson and Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy. In his role, Free leads the agency’s 10 center directors as well as the mission directorate associate administrators. Free previously served as associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate.\n\nCareers at NASA\n\nAlign your talents with your passion and find out why NASA consistently is named a best place to work in the federal government.
