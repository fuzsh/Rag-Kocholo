        "text": "Channel efforts started to heat up this past November when the network security vendor hired Shaun McConnon, who has a long history with the channel, including positions with Data General and Sun Microsystems.\n\nOne of his first actions was to hire Jim Charlton as vice president of worldwide sales and operations.\n\nAt the time, McConnon promised a \"strong emphasis\" on the channel and \"a robust channel program.\"\n\nThe Q-Alliance Partner Program offers a Partner Portal called QMMUNITY, dedicated training for new partners, and marketing support including joint marketing events.\n\nThe program has four levels: Q-Vantage, Q-Solve, Q-Team and Q-Technology. Q-Vantage, the highest partner level, is aimed at strategic consultants, integration and implementation partners. This level receives technical support, ongoing training, preferential lead referrals and joint marketing.\n\nQ-Solve is aimed more at resellers, regional consultants and implementation partners serving the midmarket. Such partners receive pre-sales field support, training and sales tools, discounts on products and maintenance, and marketing support.\n\nQ-Team is a referral program for smaller resellers. Q 1 Labs has developed what it is calling a channel-ready product designed for easy resale for such partners. These partners also receive sales and training tools and Web-based marketing materials.\n\nQ-Technology is for OEM and ISVs seeking to integrate Q1 Labs' technology with their own offerings, said the company.\n\nNew partners include Accudata Systems, BMD Solutions, BruteForce, CDG, Computer Tech, Dataway, Education Engines, INCAT, Integration Technologies, Paladin Technologies, Patriot Technologies, Realtime Office Solutions, ReSoft International, Siegeworks and Stalwart."
