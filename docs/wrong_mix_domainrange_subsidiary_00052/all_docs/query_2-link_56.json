        "text": "IBM and the University of Tokyo unveiled a landmark collaboration with the launch of the Quantum Innovation Initiative Consortium (QIIC). Expanding from the December 2019 Japan–IBM Quantum Partnership initiative, QIIC, aims to accelerate the collaboration between industry, academia, and government to advance Japan’s leadership in quantum science, business, and education.\n\nHR Technology News: Online School Made Simple: K12 Inc. Introduces New Tech Tools for Thousands of Students\n\nQIIC’s main goal is to strategically accelerate quantum computing R&D activities in Japan by bringing together academic talent from across the country’s universities and prominent research associations and large-scale industry. The consortium plans to further develop technology for quantum computing in Japan and build an ecosystem to improve student skills and expertise, opening doors to future scientific discoveries and practical quantum applications.\n\nHeadquartered at the University of Tokyo, member organizations of QIIC will collaborate to engage students, faculty, and industry researchers with seminars, workshops, and events to foster new quantum business opportunities in Japan. Organizations in agreement to join the consortium include Keio University, Toshiba, Hitachi, Mizuho, MUFG, JSR, DIC, Toyota, Mitsubishi Chemicals and IBM Japan.\n\nHR Technology News: Toptal Launches Remote Work Solutions to Help Companies Create Effective Remote Work Environments\n\nThese organizations in consortium will also be part of the IBM Q Network – the world’s first community of Fortune 500 companies, startups, academic institutions and research labs – to advance quantum computing and the development of practical applications for it. As part of the network, they will have access to IBM’s expertise and resources, and cloud development environment, as well as cloud-based access to the IBM Quantum Computation Center, which includes IBM’s most-advanced quantum computers.\n\nIn addition to cloud-based access to the IBM’s fleet of quantum systems, the QIIC will also have access to an IBM Q System One, a dedicated system planned for installation in Japan in 2021. The first of its kind in the region, and only the second such installation outside of the US, this system – along with a separate testbed system to be part of a system technology development lab – will support the consortium’s goals of next-generation quantum hardware research and development, including cryogenic components, room temperature electronics, and micro-signal generators.\n\nHR Technology News: Minimize the Number of Regular Meetings with Virtual Stand-ups"
