        "text": "Master Consultant\n\nFollowing the completion of my undergraduate studies in Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering, I became acquainted with the world of data and analytics. As a result of my passion for problem solving, I pursued a Master’s degree in Business Analytics. Through my graduate studies, I acquired the skills to use data in order to assist in solving business problems and to influence business decisions.\n\nIn my role as a Master Consultant at QueBIT, I help customers with the acquisition, preparation, and utilization of business data to improve reporting, planning, or other aspects of their business. I value my role at QueBIT because it provides me with a daily opportunity to apply my passion for problem-solving in a collaborative environment. The most fulfilling part of my job comes from delivering products and services that help to optimize business operations by enabling end-users to make informed management decisions easily and effectively.\n\nMaster Consultant\n\nI enjoy helping others and sharing knowledge, and QueBIT is a perfect place for that. QueBIT understands how to blend both technology and business which mirrors my own educational interests. I have a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, a master’s degree in engineering management, as well as an MBA. In prior positions I have worked in a range of different industries and analytics has always been at the forefront. Here at QueBIT this is our expertise. We work towards adding value for our clients through our products, solutions, and services.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Analyst\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Modeler\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Administrator\n\nTechnology Manager\n\nMy time in this industry has seen a lot of innovation and complexity, both in terms of our clients’ needs and the tools we have developed to help them. I started in finance with a degree in Economics (BA, University of Massachusetts) and gravitated to data systems and programming.\n\nThe speed at which data storage and a management is growing can be really intimidating for companies. For me, that is where I see the big difference working with QueBIT. We recognize that our clients are experts in their business. Part of our role is to be well prepared with training and team knowledge to help our clients embrace transitions. I feel vested in the technology, and I share that confidence with our clients throughout our partnership.\n\nCertification:\n\nIBM Certified Advanced Solution Expert – Cognos TM1\n\nImplementation Manager\n\nThe principal that drives my passion with QueBIT is taking each unique challenge and mapping the road to deliver successful solutions. With QueBIT’s clients ranging across diverse industries, each client and project have specific goals that make our work exciting.\n\nI began my career as a Civil Engineer designing water systems. Whether my task is to build an analytics solution or a clean water network, every project is an opportunity to start from a concept and build something tangible that will remain strong throughout time.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Cloud Administration\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Dimensions and Cubes\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – General Administration\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Local Administration\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Rules and Feeders\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – TurboIntegrator\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Analyze Data\n\nAdaptive Insights – Partner Certification\n\nImplementation Manager\n\nMy curiosity, and desire to understand what drives a successful business led me to pursue a Master’s degree in Accounting. My time at QueBIT has given me the opportunity to work with many different clients, of a wide variety of backgrounds. It has enabled me to leverage my Finance and Accounting background to solve an array of business problems. I love having the opportunity to be creative and see my solutions provide immediate impact on a clients success.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Planning analytics – Cloud Administration\n\nIBM Planning analytics – Dimensions and Cubes\n\nIBM Planning analytics – General Administration\n\nIBM Planning analytics – Local Administration\n\nIBM Planning analytics – Rules and Feeders\n\nIBM Planning analytics – TruboIntegrator\n\nAdaptive Insights – Partner Certification\n\nImplementation Manager\n\nI started my career working in the Media industry using technologies to help drive client success. Now, as a Implementation Manager at QueBIT, I have the unique perspective of seeing technology through the user’s lens and delivering effective products that enhance the every-day user’s experience.\n\nEvery new challenge is an opportunity to apply technology to improve a client’s business process and help them drive more informed business decisions. The collaborative nature of QueBIT fosters a culture of teamwork that enables a group of people with varying professional backgrounds to solve problems in incredibly creative ways.\n\nI would say the most fulfilling aspect of working at QueBIT is knowing that our products help transform business processes that ends up saving users time and energy.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Administrator, Modeler, Analyst – PA 2.X\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – General Administration, Local Administration 2.X\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Dimensions and Cubes, TurboIntegrator, Rules and Feeders 2.X\n\nAdaptive Insights – Partner Certification\n\nSenior Software Engineer\n\nMatthew Hopkins, Senior Software Engineer, has over 15 years of Software Development Leadership in Financial Planning and Reporting. During his time at IBM, he designed and developed commercial applications including Cognos Analysis for Excel (Cafe), several APIs and led a team that developed Planning Analytics for Excel. Matthew is driven to make every customer successful through direct collaboration. He has presented product and training sessions, as well as hands on labs at multiple industry conferences. At QueBIT, Matthew is responsible for delivering high quality applications for customers and creating exceptional automation tools to enhance the services delivered by the consulting team.\n\nProduct & Solution Management\n\nAndrew Weiss, Directory of Solutions and Product Management, brings over 20 years of Software Engineering, Cognos Application Development and Leadership expertise to QueBIT. Through his tenure at Cognos/IBM and other business partners he has designed and developed several familiar application such as Cognos Analysis for Excel (Café) and MetaManager. He enjoys public speaking and has presented at countless user groups, training events and conferences. In addition he holds a Masters in Software Engineering and is the inventor of 3 software related patents. At QueBIT, Andrew is responsible for growing the software arm of the business including designing infrastructure, developing direct and indirect sales channels and managing a roadmap. Andrew believes that delivering impeccable customer service is top priority and the method for which to measure success.\n\nDirector, Services Delivery\n\nAs a former student of economics, I greatly enjoy the opportunity to work with so many different types of firms and industries. They each make economic decisions of varying scales and consequences that impact the global economy in very tangible and fascinating ways. It is a privilege to see firsthand how our clients analyze the data available to them and respond to the strategic challenges that they encounter every day.\n\nThe incredible enthusiasm, support, and experience of my co-workers at QueBIT is a constant source of personal and professional growth. We provide each other with as much insight into new technologies and business practices as we do our clients.\n\nBefore becoming a QueBIT consultant, I worked for a few years in finance. At that time, I was responsible for financial reporting, planning, and occasional audits. After countless hours in Excel, Access, and SQL, I eventually found myself thinking, “There must be an easier way to get this done.” Those practical experiences in finance have been invaluable in helping me empathize with our clients.\n\nDirector, Services Delivery\n\nAnalytical and competitive by nature, I am highly motivated to provide solutions that satisfy each customer’s specific needs. It is very rewarding to implement a solution and instantly see the positive effects it has for a company. I find it exciting to work with different clients, learn about their industry and unique business challenges, and understand how each conducts their financial and operational planning and forecasting slightly different than the next.\n\nI feel each project is relatable to a game of Tetris. They consist of different moving pieces with multiple ways of connecting them together. Ultimately, the goal is to find the best fit for each piece, which impacts the next piece, and the end result should yield no gaps. With a Finance degree from Bryant University and the wealth of knowledge and expertise in many areas from my QueBIT team, I am confident I have the resources and aspiration to win each game of Tetris.\n\nCertifications:\n\nWorkday Adaptive Planning – Product Certification Program, Customer Support Certification, & Customer Success Certification.\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Administrator Badge, Modeler Badge, & Analyst Badge\n\nDirector, Services Delivery\n\nMy favorite thing about being a consultant is working with different companies in all kinds of industries. It is eye-opening how vastly different two seemingly comparable companies operate on a day-to-day basis, and I find it fascinating. One of my favorite things to do when I was younger was a Sudoku puzzle, and what I do every day with our clients is often like solving a puzzle. Oftentimes, organizations know where they want to be, but they don’t know how to get there. To me, solving the tough problems to “get there” is the fun part.\n\nMy finance background is a perfect fit for what we do with our clients every day. With my experience and the QueBIT team behind me, I know that I will add value to every project I work on.\n\nCertifications:\n\nCognos TM1 10.1; IBM Certified Developer – Cognos TM1 10.1\n\nIBM Certified Specialist – Cognos TM1 10.1 Data Analysis\n\nIBM Certified Developer – Cognos TM1\n\nIBM Certified Specialist – Cognos TM1 Data Analysis\n\nImplementation Manager\n\nStudying Mathematics and Computer Science (BS, Wagner College) taught me a great deal about discussing complicated problems and elegant solutions. Math has long been a passion of mine. In college, I was the VP for the mathematics honors society, Kappa Mu Epsilon. I am very analytical and outcome oriented. QueBIT gives me a great opportunity to apply my approach while working with so many different business verticals.\n\nIt is an exciting time in our industry because of the advancement in technology and processing power that keep opening up options for us to design impactful solutions for our clients. It is a joy to see our clients have the chance to step back from their data and reveal the data relationships and processes that make their work more efficient and productive.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Certified Developer – Cognos TM1\n\nIBM Certified Specialist – Cognos TM1 Data Analysis\n\nIBM Certified Advanced Solution Expert – Cognos TM1\n\nTechnical Pre Sales Consultant\n\nEver since I was young, I’ve always strived to be the best at everything I did. I’m sure that is a sentiment that can be attributed to many of my co-workers. Reading the statement, I realize it sounds very arrogant but I am fueled by the desire to constantly try to improve myself. One example of this perseverance was related to high school and track; which I really enjoyed and was good at it. Ultimately, I was awarded a track and academic scholarship to a Division I school. While there (Wagner College and Monmouth University), I earned a Master’s degree in Financial Mathematics, I was an Academic All-American, in addition to winning the conference championship multiple times.\n\nIt is this same approach that I apply to my performance on the job and transferred to all the clients I’ve been assigned and will apply to future clients, as well. Whether your company’s focus in the retail, insurance, asset management, medical, etc. fields, QueBIT provides expertise for all niches of business analytics.\n\nWhen combining the vast knowledge and overall expertise of QueBIT and their resources, a client, in need of an analytics model or improvement of an existing system, the possibilities are endless and without limitations.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Cognos TM1 10.1 Analyst\n\nIBM Cognos TM1 10.1 Developer\n\nIBM Cognos TM1 10.1 Administrator\n\nSenior Software Engineer\n\nThe most rewarding part of our work is when the client takes ownership of the product we designed for them. They take the reins and reap the rewards of the analytical potential, which usually leads to lower business costs and time savings. Learning the inter-working of so many different types of businesses is a fascinating part of what we do. The challenge is delivering a flexible solution for each type of business.\n\nTeamwork has always been important to me. I played football at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where I studied Computer Systems Engineering. QueBIT is more than a team, however. It really feels like family with all the support and interaction available to all of us.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Certified Specialist – Cognos TM1 Data Analysis Exam\n\nIBM Certified Developer – Cognos TM1 Developer Exam\n\nIBM Certified Master – Cognos TM1 Masters Exam\n\nImplementation Manager\n\nI have had the unique opportunity to see QueBIT from two perspectives: First as a client (at ETS) and now as a consultant. Early in my career, QueBIT was engaged by ETS to implement a Budgeting and Forecasting system, with a feed to the Cognos Business Intelligence solution. Given the use of the CARE methodology during the project, the ETS team successfully maintained the applications after the engagement and further enhanced the systems as time went on.\n\nAs an Implementation Manager working for QueBIT, I am now able to provide this same level of expertise and support to a new generation of clients. I am especially excited by the new Cognos Analytics technology, and the tools it provides for the business decision making process. However, I personally believe a BA solution is only as good as the design behind it. Therefore, my personal ambition in every project is to ensure the business owner’s goals and vision are at the forefront of every task, helping to ensure the final product is a valuable tool going forward.\n\nImplementation Manager\n\nMy decision to study accounting in college was not because I wanted to practice public accounting, although I’ve been a licensed CPA since 1995, but rather because I was very interested in business and I thought accounting would give me the best understanding of business. Therefore, I started my career in corporate accounting and spent the first 10 years performing many disciplines in accounting and finance.\n\nIn 1999, I was able to combine my love for business and accounting when the company and team I worked for had IBM Cognos TM1 (now renamed to IBM Planning Analytics) installed. This began my fascination with the tool that could take our forecasts and budgets from Excel and make them so much more alive. I poured myself into learning TM1 and eventually began developing TM1 to work within other departments in our company. That passion evolved into me becoming a TM1 consultant in 2008, eventually leading me to QueBIT. And at QueBIT, we have the same passion to make businesses better by improving their ability to succeed.\n\nSenior Consultant\n\nLearning how much data is created every day was eye-opening. The first thought that came to my mind was “How can anyone possibly manage that data?” This question has since translated into a passion for helping my clients to overcome this challenge; evaluating each client’s unique business need to provide a solution that is easy to understand and yields big improvements to the organization.\n\nI obtained my B.S. Business Administration, with a concentration in Management Information Systems and by M.B.A with a concentration in Business Analytics from Binghamton University. Having a background sitting at the confluence of both business and data technology, I strive to understand each business requirement in front of me and successfully translate them into technical solutions.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0 Analyst\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0 Modeler\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0 Administrator\n\nPlanning Analytics with Watson Sales Foundation\n\nPlanning Analytics with Watson Technical Sales Intermediate\n\nMaster Consultant\n\nStudying Mechanical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute provided me a strong background in analytical thinking and creative problem solving. Inventing unique and efficient solutions to complicated problems has been a passion of mine throughout my life. My time at QueBIT has allowed the opportunity to further develop his skills while exposing me to various businesses and industries.\n\nI am focused on leveraging my background and experiences to deliver solutions that truly solve our clients’ business problems and help facilitate their successes.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Analyst\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Modeler\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Administrator\n\nAdaptive Insights – Partner Certification\n\nMaster Consultant\n\nProblem solving and building meaningful solutions is QueBIT’s constant focus. Providing a client with a solution that not only solves their problem but also makes their life and job easier is the most satisfying feeling. The challenge of using creative methods to unravel conundrums and gain new skills has always excited me. As much as I love solving client’s problems, it’s the QueBIT team that really brings out the best in me.\n\nI am someone who has always loved being part of a team. I come from a close-knit family where it is not uncommon to have a dozen cousins going to the movies or baking gingerbread houses together. This has helped me realize the importance of teamwork and collaboration from an early age. My background in mathematics and computer science has given me the building blocks for great consultant work but it’s the QueBIT team that really brings out the best in each other and our clients.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Certified Developer – Cognos TM1 10.1\n\nIBM Certified Specialist – Cognos TM1 10.1\n\nIBM Certified Administrator – Cognos TM1 10.1\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Administrator – 2017\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Analyst – 2017\n\nIBM Planning Analytics – Modeler – 2017\n\nQuerying Microsoft SQL Server 2012 70-461\n\nDirector, Services Delivery\n\nAfter receiving my BS in Computer Science from the University of Rochester, I was faced with the question of what kind of career I wanted. I loved coding and solving problems with technology, but I never felt comfortable working closed off from others, staring at a screen all day. Having worked at a customer-facing IT support job in college, I discovered my passion for taking my technological skills and using them to solve people’s problems.\n\nIt turned out that QueBIT was the perfect fit for me. Working with clients to fully understand and solve their business problems is truly fulfilling. The CARE methodology at QueBIT fosters a strong and close relationship with our clients. We build solutions working closely alongside our clients and give them the skills to own and build upon their solutions. At QueBIT, there is a team of dedicated consultants just like me striving to provide as much value to our clients as possible.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Certified Specialist – Cognos TM1 10.1 Data Analysis\n\nIBM Certified Developer – Cognos TM1 10.1\n\nIBM Certified Administrator – Cognos TM1 10.1\n\nPrincipal Consultant\n\nIn my prior life as it were, I was an Accountant by education and trade. As my skills grew, I eventually joined the ranks of other Financial Analysts who mostly work in Excel to do Budgeting, Forecasting and Analysis. During these earlier phases of my career, I learned a lot about how different businesses track and measure success as well as plan for the future. I have always been captivated by how technology can make our lives easier and passionate about how it can be combined with a little creativity and ingenuity to drive meaningful change.\n\nNow as a Senior Consultant specializing in Cognos TM1 and Certent Disclosure Management (formerly Cognos Disclosure Management), I am fortunate to have the opportunity to help clients drive such changes within their businesses. Nothing about my career makes me happier than a successful project which solves my clients’ business problems.\n\nCertifications:\n\nIBM Certified Developer – Cognos TM1 10.1\n\nIBM Certified Analyst – Cognos TM1 10.1\n\nIBM Certified Administrator – Cognos TM1 10.1\n\nDirector, Services Delivery\n\nA common dilemma for most companies today is spending too much time gathering key data, resulting in rushed decisions to meet deadlines. At QueBIT, we are well aware of this cycle and nearly 20 years of experience implementing solutions has us well positioned to reverse this pattern for our customers. Prior to joining QueBIT, I had been partnering with Sales, Finance, Marketing and Sales Operations teams in several Fortune 500 companies and found we suffered from “data drought”. Several years were spent in the trenches, forecasting both units and revenues for large, global companies where we consistently found ourselves struggling to gather key data, leaving no time for proper analysis and decision making. Finally, we invested in a new OLAP system built on IBM Cognos TM1 that allowed us to break that pattern and significantly improve our forecasting process and business results. Now I work with experts crafting solutions that deliver outstanding results for our customers every day.\n\nAt QueBIT, we understand how to apply advanced technologies to solve many different types of business problems and we can help you with yours. Like everyone else here at QueBIT, I have a passion for analytics and helping companies resolve key business issues. I earned my undergraduate degree in Business Administration from North Carolina State University and would love to discuss how QueBIT can help solve your problems and earn your trust.\n\nSenior Consultant\n\nI obtained my bachelor’s degree in actuarial science from the University of Delaware and am now pursuing a masters of business & science (MBS) degree at Rutgers University in analytics. Both degrees have offered me an extensive background in coding, analytics, and business problem solving. QueBIT offers the perfect balance of technology and business problems through many different industries to continue to challenge myself and grow. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring the possibilities that analytics can offer and apply the knowledge to each client problem.\n\nCertifications Include:\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0. Administrator\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0. Analyst\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0. Modeler\n\nSenior Consultant\n\nWith a BS of Mechanical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I spent much of my working life in the Oil and Gas industry as a Field Engineer. Thorough knowledge of each part of the complex, data-gathering, tool suite was necessary to operate, maintain, and troubleshoot the systems in that role. Now, as a Senior Consultant at QueBIT, I similarly evaluate a client’s business needs holistically. I believe a good balance of business process, user training, and technical implementation is important to a solution’s success.\n\nCertifications Include:\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0. Administrator\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0. Analyst\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0. Modeler\n\nSenior Consultant\n\nI’ve always been motivated to empower others in their understanding of complex ideas. This mentality guided me to earn a bachelor’s degree in economics from Susquehanna University and subsequently a master’s degree in economics from the University of New Hampshire. My economics training and professional experience working for academic institutions provide me with a strong foundation of data analytics, coding, an ability to breakdown complex issues simply, and a tenacity to never stop learning. My excitement for systematic data processes and programming led me to the consulting industry.\n\nAs a senior consultant for QueBIT, I harness my passion for problem-solving and collaboration to find solutions for each customer’s needs through the power of data analytics. I strive to illuminate the way for my clients with warmth and vibrance, even when facing the most challenging of roadblocks, and to provide analytical advice while instilling trust and connection.\n\nCertifications include:\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0 Administrator\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0 Analyst\n\nIBM Planning Analytics V2.0.0 Modeler\n\nAnaplan Certified Model Builder"
