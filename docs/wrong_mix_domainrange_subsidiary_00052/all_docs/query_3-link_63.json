        "text": "As mentioned by Rammus average temperature in space is 2.7 K while quantum processor are cooled to 15 mK (e.g. IBM Q). There are objects with lower temperature than 2.7 K in the space - black holes. But as you can see this option is very unpractical.\n\nMoreover, I would add that it is not possible to reach absolute zero. This is forbidden by third law of thermodynamics. See details here."
