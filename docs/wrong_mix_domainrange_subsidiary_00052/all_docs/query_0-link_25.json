        "text": "IBM Research is known for leading the frontier of innovation in the field of computing for more than 75 years. That said, IBM Research is even better known for innovators who created these technologies and are part of computing industry across the world. Today was a special all hands meeting with our world wide research team. While sharing innovations in the field of computing, we celebrated the impactful life of three outstanding innovators from IBM Research who left us recently. Everyone in our industry is touched by their contributions for which we all are forever grateful. Thank you Bob Dennard, Rama Divakaruni and Lynn Conway, your legacy will live forever. Dario Gil IBM Research IBM\n\nIt was our honor to host Liesje Schreinemacher, Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, leading a delegation of Business and Government leaders from the Netherlands at IBM Research. We shared deep history of partnership between IBM and ASML, starting in 1991 when IBM became the first partner to invest in ASML’s 200mm Lithography System PAS 5500…. the rest is history and this deep partnership continues to the generation of High N.A. EUV. We also shared our commitment to collaborate across government, academia and industry to develop the future computing. This event was followed by the visit of Their Majesties King and Queen of the Netherlands to Albany Nanotech Complex hosted by NY CREATES. The day was topped off by NYS Governor Hochul hosting a celebration at her official residence celebrating 400 years of history between NY State and the Netherlands!\n\nAdvanced Packaging and Chiplet technology innovation will enable semiconductor chips to fuel the computing demand of Generative AI Era! IBM Bromont in Canada is a unique packaging manufacturing facility with more than 50 years of leadership. This is also a trusted manufacturing facility for the US. We are proud of public private partnership announcement today between IBM and Government of Canada to invest in this manufacturing facility and further strengthen the semiconductor supply in North America.\n\nIt is truly humbling to receive Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay on its 65th Foundation Day! My days at IIT are among the most memorable that defined my career trajectory. I met Prof. Juzer Vasi at IIT who mentored and shaped my journey to whom I am greatful forever. Thank you IIT B and Prof. Vasi for this prestigious honor.\n\nThis was an amazing week for the Semiconductor industry and public-private-academic partnerships across the US and Japan. Monday marked the largest semiconductor R&D investment in the US where New York State Governor Kathy Hochul together with Senators Schumer and Gillibrand announced $10B investment at the Albany NanoTech Complex that included High NA EUV Lithography capabilities and a new R&D Fab. This public-private-academic investment in an open innovation ecosystem will fuel semiconductor technology leadership and economic growth for decades! Later this week was the Semicon Japan where the whole country is energized to regain semiconductor leadership through public private partnerships. Attendance at Semicon Japan crossed 70,000 this year, the highest ever, which used be a declining forum few years back. I was honored to share our vision that Generative AI workload will be the primary driver of growth in semiconductor industry for next decade and the future of sustainable computing can only be achieved through partnership between academia, industry and government’s of like minded countries. Looking at the excitement and investment in Semiconductor and Generative AI technologies, I wish to be twenty years younger to learn and enjoy the creation of the most consequential technology of generations. https://lnkd.in/e3ZS5z3N\n\nThe future of AI is approaching a fork in the road. One path is dangerously close to creating consolidated control of AI, driven by a small number of companies that have a closed, proprietary vision for the AI industry. Down the other path lies a broad, open road: a highway that belongs to the many, not the few, and is protected by the guardrails that we create together. IBM at its core believes in open and collaborative approach to developing most consequential technology of our era where industry, university and government can work together. We are proud to launch AI Alliance https://thealliance.ai/ in partnership with more than 50 leading institutions. We welcome you to join in this AI journey together.
