IBM in 20 slides #ibmin20slides\n\n2. \" You who run our financial and energy systems; who design, build and fly our planes, run our trains, manage our cities; who cure us, feed us, clothe us, entertain us and keep us safe; who teach our children. Every profession in every industry in every part of the world is changing, simultaneously. You are drawing on a wealth of new data, knowledge, insights and tools. You are being equipped to rethink your job, and freed to do your life’s work. That is a world we all want to live in. The world you’re building, with IBM. You to the power of IBM. Source: IBM Annual Report 2016\n\n3. Companies and organizations like yours are undertaking large processes of digital transformation, driven by three factors: The growth of large amounts of structured and unstructured data The emergence of cloud as an architecture and business model for all types of organizations. The adoption of cognitive systems and processes to differentiate and improve decision making\n\n4. IBM has reinvented itself to respond to this moment. With Watson, with IBM Cloud.\n\n5. We have transformed ourselves into a company of cognitive solutions on Cloud platform Watson is the platform of Artificial Intelligence for companies. IBM Cloud is the global leader platform in the enterprise cloud environment.\n\n6. The power of Congnitive transformation The cognitive capabilities of Watson will reach more than 1.000 milions persons in 2018 Is the interactive process to take decisions with arguments based on data knowledge, combining tools as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Different techniques that include natural language processing, reasoning and planning for advanced tasks. Statistical analysis of pattern recognition to make predictions based on data. Watson on the IBM Cloud is available to more than 200 million consumers to answer questions, find what they need online and make recommendations. Clients from 133 countries can simulate and prepare for real-world attacks and draw on the power of Watson to fight cybercrime. Half a million students can choose courses and master a subject with Watson, which also helps teachers address each student’s unique learning needs. Buildings are reducing CO2 emissions by 10 million tons a year; businesses are accelerating hiring cycles by 75 percent; and airlines are improving maintenance efficiency by 80 percent. Cognitive Computing Artificial intelligence Machine Learning\n\n7. …plus our capability to deploy Cloud 55 Cloud Centres, in 19 countries from the 6 continents, to provide solutions for all business needs calls/month for API help +9.500 millions new apps/month 560.000 apps updates/month 3.5 millones services available for developers 160 cognitive servicies +30\n\n8. Industrial specialization Integrated Solutions Today we are the most powerful innovation platform for companies Our proposal is the key piece of architecture that companies are designing today\n\n9. Healthcare We bring our transformation to all industries Financial services IoT (Communication, Retail, Electronics, Production, Building…) • 10.000 clients and partners • +35 healthy systems use Watson for Oncology in EU, Japan, Thailand, India • Broad knowledge and expertise • Watson Health brings 200M+ clinic results, 100M+ patients records, 4M+ pharmaceutical patents, 20M+ research documents • Our clients brings innovation: • 20% have cognitive pilots or they will have • The 28 largest banks in the world use IBM cloud • We have the largest network for intelligent threat monitoring • 500 organizations in 55 countries • 100M threats/day • 600 experts in risks and fraud work with Watson • New Watson IoT centres • Cognitive projects: BNP Paribas, BMW, Avnet, Tech Mahindra, Capgemini • New capabilities without precedent in IoT • Blockchain, weather, edge, Visa global payment services • In Q4 2016: 100% growth in new clients and developers • The number of devices connected to IoT is doubled in 2016\n\n10. The evolution of our business mix In the 60s we were essentially a hardware company. In the 90s, the Services are consolidating and the Software appear. 1960 1990 Hardware Services Software From 1990 to 2014, the IBM software develops into Cloud platforms and models. In 2014, the first cognitive solutions appear. SW platforms Middleware Analytics Cloud IaaS/PaaS Security Cognitive solutions Starting with 2015, IBM predicts that half of its revenue from the following years will come from Cognitive and Cloud areas. COGNITIVE CLOUD SERVICES HARDWARE 50% 2014 2020\n\n11. We have invested in and built the capabilities—cloud, analytics, cognitive, mobile, security—to power the emerging needs of modern business. Our strategic imperatives grew by 14 percent adjusting for currency, generating $33 billion in revenue last year, representing 41 percent of our total revenue. CLOUD ANALYTICS MOBILE SECURITY +30% 9% 23% 132% 4Q 2017 Growth 13,80 $ operating earnings per share IBM 2017 5.75 $ billion earnings 79.139 $ millions Revenue IBM results in 2017 2015 2016 2017 2014 $25B $29B $33B $36.5B\n\n12. IBM is already essential to global business… 97% the world’s travel reservations are processed on IBM systems 80% of the word’s largest banks use IBM products to run their systems 90% of global credit card transactions are processed on IBM mainframes 83% of the world’s largest communications service providers are IBM clients 80% of global retailers are powered by IBM retail solutions\n\n13. With a powerful ecosystem of Alliances and Business Partners * IBM has more than 160,000 Business Partners, with very different business models including VARs (Value Added Resellers), Solution Providers, System Integrators, Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and ISVs (Independent Software Developers) *\n\n14. Photo: IBM Q Lab, in New York, in which the first quantum computers are designed, available via Cloud IBM Research… For the 25th year in a row, IBM led in U.S. patents earned 9.043 patents in 2016 (22 each day) +105.000 patents since 1993 IBM annually invests 6 to 7 percent of total revenue for R&D Total invested research, development and engineering $5,751 millions 12 R&D laboratories USA, China, Japan, India, Israel, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland, Brazil and Kenya +3.000 researchers 6 Nobel prizes. 10 medals for technology. 6 Turing prizes\n\n15. …and the most advanced research lines in the industry Blockchain will do for trusted transactions what the Internet did for information. The Hiperledger Project pretends to reinforce the security of transactions and eliminate the business barriers. BLOCKCHAIN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING QUANTUM COMPUTING At IBM Research we work for Artificial Intelligence to increase and enhance human capabilities as well as develop cognitive systems that help us make decisions and learn from the data A new paradigm that seeks to take advantage of physical concepts to solve problems that today have no solution with current systems. In 2016 we launched the 1st quantum platform Cloud: IBM Quantum Experience\n\n16. IBM Design Thinking is our approach to understanding our clients needs, creating empathy and always focusing on the results that matter. And, above all, a new way to do things Our global platform for IBMer training. Mobile Sales Experience Deployment of our mobility platform with an App Store that is unique in the market. In everything we all do, it’s all about working in an agile way … envisioning an outcome, prototyping, iterating, multi- disciplinary teams… We do that in many parts of IBM today, but we’re scaling it at an enterprise level. Ginni Rometty, “Becoming Agile” A focus on user outcomes: When you use IBM Design Thinking, put your users’ needs first Multidisciplinary teams: Collaborate across disciplines to move faster and work smarter Restless reinvention: Everything is a prototype. Listen, learn, and course-correct\n\n17.
