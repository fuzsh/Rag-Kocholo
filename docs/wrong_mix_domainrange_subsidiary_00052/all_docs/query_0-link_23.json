        "text": "Hello. My name is Q. Malandrino ('Quirino', if you can pronounce it - go ahead, I dare you). This 'Q' nickname was never my choice: it was given to me by my first boss, the pipe-smoking Charles Finsilver, the day I started my first job in the US. He decided he wasn't going to try and pronounce it, \"my life's complicated enough\" were his exact words, and so \"Q\" was it. I work in Branding, a discipline made of left and right brains exploring and then exchanging ideas and concepts, all of which ends up residing in the collective marketplace's mind. As it is a profession that lets you have a different day every single day, and I had very many days in it, I have a ton of memories. I thought to share a few of them -- some will be long and some will be single scenes, hopefully meaningful and informative, and perhaps entertaining; and in doing so, I'll also have the opportunity to pay homage to clients and colleagues whose counsel, personalities, and influence have shaped the professional - and in part the person - in me. And I'll end each story with what I learned, and with Experience, which is really the only way to learn this business of ours - this (Branding) Cosa Nostra.\n\n--\n\nIBM, and APPLE (1991-1992)\n\nrecommended soundtrack while reading: any and all parts of Dire Straits' April 26 1986 Sydney concert\n\nJanuary 18, 1992 - THE WASHINGTON POST - by Mark Potts\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp., struggling to reinvent itself amid changing times in the computer industry, yesterday reported a $2.8 billion loss for 1991 -- its first annual loss ever. Buffeted by the global economic slowdown, the company also reported its first year-over-year decline in corporate revenue since 1946, when IBM's principal products were typewriters and adding machines. Although IBM's core businesses turned a profit in 1991, it was more than erased by two one-time write- offs totaling $5.7 billion, one covering severance pay for 29,000 employees who left the company under voluntary retirement or other inducements, the other covering future health care benefits of retirees. Both had been previously announced but the cost of the workforce reductions was somewhat higher than anticipated.\n\n1991 \"was a disappointing year,\" IBM Chairman John F. Akers said in a prepared statement from the company's headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. \"We were adversely affected by protracted worldwide economic weakness, competitive pressures and transitions within our product lines.\" The poor results had been widely expected on Wall Street, and were slightly better than some analysts expected. As a result, IBM stock was cushioned from the effects of the news: It fell $3 after the announcement, then rebounded to close up 87 1/2 cents, at $96.37 1/2, on the New York Stock Exchange. Over the past year, IBM has moved dramatically to reposition itself and build a foundation for growth by cutting costs, reducing employment by 29,000 workers, reorganizing operations to make its business units more independent and entering into a landmark agreement with former archrival Apple Computer Inc. to jointly develop the next generation of software and personal computers.\n\n--\n\nArmonk is a hamlet within the town of North Castle, in Westchester County, 37 miles and about an hour drive north of Manhattan via the Saw Mill Parkway and NY-9A. It's one of those little places that are famous the world over because of a company's headquarters - in this case, IBM. Chuck and I had been going up there once or twice a week for the past six months, with my blue VW Golf or a black car. We have fun doing these business drive-arounds, the Hudson Valley is one fertile path and another one is up & down Route 78 in New Jersey - we hit all the pharma companies there, from Johnson & Johnson to Ortho Biotech to McNeil etc. I open the window and smoke, he sits back and enjoys (and marvels at) my Italian driving, while pondering his plans for world domination and here & there asking my opinion, and tells me John Murphy stories (JM was the founder of Interbrand, in London in 1974). I'll write a separate story about how Chuck and I met -- he had acquired me and my little Corporate Identity firm (was called MARQ -- oh, what a clever name) a year earlier in order to start a CI division (our first program? Cordis Corporation - thank you Kris Larsen) to be added to Interbrand's historical Naming business and the pioneering and already successful Brand Valuation practice. Chuck is five years younger than me, looks fifteen years younger than me, and is a charismatic and savvy businessman and brand strategist, CEO of Interbrand USA and my boss.\n\nAs the WP article outlined, at the outset of the 90s IBM's CEO John Akers was in the midst of reframing the business: basically, turn the company into a federation of companies -- the so-called Baby Blues, autonomous business units that could compete more effectively in a rapidly evolving marketplace. Chuck had a relationship with Ruth Nelson, IBM's Director of Corporate Marketing, and had served IBM with some naming work in the past, and the fact that we now had a CI practice let us jump on the opportunity: in just two years, 1991 and 1992, we created twelve new brands, Akers's desired spinoffs -- one after another and a few of them concurrently -- a brand foundation and then corporate name and visual identity. Very busy times for us, and contextually the beginning of a reputational rise and visibility that two years later caught the attention of Omnicom -- which led to the acquisition, which led to the firm's meteoric rise: under Chuck's global leadership and drive, with the support and keen business sense of Michael Birkin who had gone on to run DAS within Omnicom, and with the financial strategies of Noel Penrose the firm expanded organically and via acquisitions, and by the end of the decade was the largest branding firm in the world: 1,000+ employees in 32 offices in 27 countries.\n\nChuck and I were partners-in-crime in the IBM relationship. The work was fast & furious, but fun & varied: for example, the Information Products division (printers, typewriters, and supplies) which we named Lexmark: it was based in Lexington, KY -- 'Lex'(ington) + 'mark', as in marks-on-paper. Another interesting one was ISSC, Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation, which was given to run to Dennie Welsh - a well-respected IBM VP who joined the company as an engineer in 1966 to work on the NASA Apollo space program; sadly, he passed away in 2004 - at the young age of 61. John Murphy and I presented the work to him in Paris, at IBM's offices at La Défense, just outside the city across the Périphérique. We were staying at a small hotel on Avenue Victor Hugo next to the Arc de Triomphe; I remember it well because when sixteen years later Interbrand sent me to Paris, I lived five minutes from there, my kids' school was next door, and I used to go to La Défense with them to hang out at the mall-like shops there.\n\nOk -- focus. The subject matter.\n\nIt's late August 1991, and Chuck and I met with Ms Nelson about one of the other spinoffs -- a healthcare-related joint venture with Baxter which we had named IBAX -- IbmBAXter, cool name, right? At the end of the meeting she told us that there was yet another brand to be created, a joint venture in the area of software, and that an executive by the name of Jim Cannavino would reach out to brief us. We did get a call the next day, and were asked to meet him two days later at the golf course next to Armonk's IBM HQ.\n\nJim Cannavino was an IBM legend: he was hired in Chicago, an 18-year old attending a technical institute and working in a supermarket, who applied at the IBM office only because it happened to be at the end of his bus route. He rose to be head of both the Mainframe and the PC divisions, and eyed the top job -- \"I've had an itch to run a business, I just know that one day I'd like to sit at the end of the table and see if I can do it.\" When the board forced John Akers to resign in late 1992, he vied for the top job against the board's all-star list (Motorola's Fisher, Compaq's Pfeiffer, Sun Microsystems' McNealy, and even John Sculley and Bill Gates), but then Louis Gerstner was chosen -- a surprise to everyone, the first IBM CEO from outside the company; indeed, Wall Street humor said that Gerstner was hired \"out of the Blue\" (but he did have a connection: his older brother Richard had run IBM's PC Division until four years earlier). Mr Gerstner had run Amex Travel Related Services and then was CEO of RJR Nabisco -- clearly, not a technologist. Rumor had it that Cannavino wanted to leave, but he accepted to be a much-needed new CEO's technology-Richelieu SVP for Strategy & Development. (He then retired from IBM two years later - at the ripe age of 50.) Famously, Gerstner started his tenure by declaring that \"the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision\", as he started the process of reversing Akers's strategies by focusing on the exact opposite: consolidating the company's functions to be able to provide integration of capabilities and services - a newfangled 'integrated IT solutions provider'. This decision to keep the company together and be a broad technology integrator turned out to be the very basis for the eventual evolution away from hardware and into the consulting & services company it is today.\n\nChuck and I meet Mr Cannavino at the golf course, in a small private room in the clubhouse. Young and college-like gregarious, without much of an introduction and no documents of any kind he expands on the assignment - one that he takes pains to emphasize is extremely confidential: it's a new entity jointly owned with Apple -- as IBM and Apple didn't quite like each other then, the news of a joint venture would have caused quite a stir. The new company was going to be about a new object-oriented operating system, which had started in 1988 at Apple with the codename PINK; it was intended to be the next generation MacOS, the successor to System 6 at the time, and go head-to-head with Microsoft Cairo and NeXTSTEP (from Steve Job's NeXT company). PINK is a fascinating story, and contextualized all our branding work.\n\nOnce System 6 was released, the Apple team held a strategy session to plan the future of the OS. They had index cards of different colors: far-out ideas were to be written on red cards, more advanced ideas on pink cards, and readily implementable ideas on blue cards (called 'Blue Meanies'). The summarized pink cards ended up being the chosen future direction, and some of the red ideas made their way in it as well -- including 'objects' based on a People-Places-Things metaphor that would simplify users' work management; as to the Blue Meanies, they were implemented in the soon-to-be released System 7. While Pink was supposed to be sequential to Blue, in reality they - and their teams - became competitors, technologically and philosophically. The dual development process continued, but then Apple joined an alliance with IBM and Motorola, called AIM, to develop a new software engine for PowerPC-based PCs. Concurrently, IBM and Apple went on to form two other JVs: we had created the name and ID for one already, Kaleida Labs, for multimedia software products, and the second was the new company that Jim Cannavino briefed us on - which was going to be headed by IBM's Joe Guglielmi (to the chagrin of the PINK team).\n\nWe got to work. Interbrand New York's 60th St office was small, about 25 extremely talented people. We were next to the famed Copacabana, one minute from the Pierre Hotel (where I was fond to hold my team's performance reviews in the oval tea room with all the frescoes), and two minutes from Central Park. When I joined in January 1990, coming from my office at 28th St and 5th Avenue where Chuck came to visit the first time I saw him two months earlier, I was eagerly anticipating to take my lunch times and cigarette breaks on a park bench. (yeah right, I took lunch in the park twice in four years, and I was smoking in my office - those were the days). The naming team came up with a fabulously meaningful and poetic name, TALIGENT, combining the Talent of the people and the Intelligence of the software. My Identity team then designed a meaningfully gorgeous logo and ID system illustrating the far-reaching impact and ripple effect that the new OS would have had on developers, users, and the computer industry at large -- and the double ripple was of course IBM and Apple. I'd be hard pressed to find a name and a logo with so much verbal and visual accuracies vis-a-vis the business realities.\n\nChuck and I presented it first in Cupertino to John Sculley. It was the first time for me at Apple, Chuck had been there once before, and I remember our excitement to meet Mr Sculley -- a highly regarded executive for his tenure as Pepsico's CEO (particularly for the success of the Pepsi Challenge) and, less gloriously, for his power struggle with Steve Jobs - whom he had forced out in 1985. A kind, congenial, and courteous CEO, he was very complimentary of our work: he liked the name (which had been shared with him a few days earlier on a conference call with Jim Cannavino as well) and loved the logo and ID work, and our recommendations --- \"very Apple\", he said. At the end of the project we sent him two champagne bottles with mocked-up labels -- one Kaleida and one Taligent -- you can see his congratulatory letters.\n\nThree days later, we presented the logo to Jim Cannavino and Jack Kuehler, IBM's President, back in Armonk. An electrical engineer by trade, a highly esteemed technologist who had risen through the ranks and become President a couple of years earlier (unusually, as most IBM Presidents came from Sales), Mr Kuehler had replaced John Akers - who had succeeded John Opel as CEO. So here we are, huge companies, secret project, IBM President and IBM legend -- a bit apprehensive as both of them are techies, not the types that usually take too well to imagery. We get to the executive suites, a uniformed guard at the entrance, an assistant ushers us into the anteroom of Mr Kuehler's office -- a conference table and sitting area, a single painting on the windowless wall, then an opening into his private office.\n\nThis is pre-PowerPoint (it had been released in 1987, but was still in its infancy), and presentations were usually done with slides in a rotating carousel projecting onto a wall or screen; but this was a design presentation, you gotta see and feel the designs, and so we had exhibits: 20\" x 30\" Bainbridge boards with color stats prints of the logo options and applications neatly glued (sprayglue or twintack - there were two schools of thought) on them, one per board; we had twenty-five boards in total. Our typical m.o., the industry's really, was to push-pin or tape the boards to the wall and then cover each with a dark sheet lightly taped on -- which in the presentation we'd progressively and swiftly unveil one by one while gracefully and fluidly dancewalk back and forth in front of the wall; you needed dramatic flair to do that well. Setup was a time-consuming proposition, and we always made sure to arrive no less than 45 minutes before the appointed time. We'd also move things around in the room -- table, chairs, plants, wall posters, so that we'd have the environment we needed -- and then had to remember to put things back exactly the way they were. Chuck and I had done so many of these presentations together and were a great team: I was in charge and was ordering him around (him, my boss) -- \"move those chairs\", \"no, not there - there\", \"hold this board up, down a bit, left, ok\", \"no, put that plant in that corner\", \"pass me the pushpins\", \"no no, not that, take it down, that board goes last\", etc. I had stopped allowing him to handle the pushpins as often he'd place them not precisely enough in the corners of the boards and once -- horror -- he even used different color pushpins for a given board. (gotta say, today, thinking back, the man had some patience with me.) But he was/is a charismatic presenter with an uncanny feel for where the audience's minds is (and watch out when he switches on his southern drawl y'all --- he can sell you the Brooklyn Bridge), as well as (in an Corporate Identity presentation) a supportive and collaborative wingman.\n\nThe room is ready, the boards are sitting on the floor against the wall, in groups of three, seven sets -- it's gonna be three rows of seven boards each, nice and neat --- and four boards are on the table as they are the finals and will be shown at the end, but on a table easel. Now I just need to move that painting off the wall. Beautiful painting, town scene of sort with people, didn't quite focus on it, got a heavy and ornate frame. Stand in front of it, grab the sides with my hands, nose touching the canvas, lift and pull. Two things happen at the same time: the painting hardly moves, and a deafening siren goes off. I'm startled, trying to figure what happened -- a uniformed guard and the assistant rush in, I still have my hands on the frame, I'm sure a deer-in-headlight expression. The guard shouts \"let go!\". I let go, step back. Siren still going. He puts a hand under the painting, flicks something I guess, the siren goes off. He asks me what I was doing -- \"I need to move it for the presentation\" I say, meekly. He smiles, seems to relax. The assistant looks at me and says: \"It's a Renoir\".\n\nWe end up putting up the boards (taped, no way we were going to prick pinholes on that wall) all around the painting -- a sight to behold: a wall full of Taligent logo options with, smack in the very middle, a beautiful Renoir. I wish I had a camera. The clients walk in a few minutes later, I shake Mr Kuehler's hand, he looks at me and then at Chuck, says \"who's the one that tried to steal my painting?\". The presentation is then a success, and I just know that Pierre-August was looking down, smiling, and ... impression-ed. Everyone's happy. But ... now we have to present to the Apple/PINK employees.\n\nChuck and I fly back to Cupertino two days later. We are met by Joe Guglielmi and follow him to an open room area -- I want to say that it was a cafeteria of sort, not sure. We are in suits and ties of course, in a room populated by about thirty young people in jeans and shorts and T-shirts and flip-flops, but arguably Silicon Valley's software best. We are very well aware, and our clients had repeatedly told us, that this is the PINK team, the initiators, with their history, their pride in their pioneering work, and all the corporate politics as a backdrop. The public announcement is ten days from now, and if they don't buy our work ... I don't know what we're going to do.\n\nWe knew about the large-scale meeting and so we are projecting slides this time. Go through the presentation -- the name first, then the logo exploration and recommendation -- taking great care to respectfully mention the various aspects of the PINK heritage. Pretty much silence throughout. Then Mr Guglielmi opens the floor to questions -- two on the genesis of the name and three on the meaning of the logo and the chosen colors -- Chuck answers the name's and I answer the logo's. All good. Then a hand goes up, and a fellow with a beard asks -- states really, \"you realize that an anagram of Taligent is Tgenital; will that be a problem?\". I look at Chuck, he looks at me - I don't know what to say, but he always does. Without missing a beat, he goes \"yes, you're right, when we do name generations we always look at potential anagrams and the naming team flags potential problems; it was noticed, but the letter sequence doesn't suggest that reading with any degree of immediacy\". Just like that, on the spot, on his two feet, with complete confidence. The bearded gentleman seems satisfied, a few seconds of uncomfortable silence, then the next, and last, voice from the audience, from a fellow who seems a bit older than the rest: \"I think it's beautiful, both the name and the logo\". Murmurs of approvals, then Joe says \"great, it seems we are in business then\". An applause materializes. We breathe again.\n\nWe keep working closely with them, under the guidance of our appointed manager -- head of Communications Karen Domyon, one of my most favored clients ever, incredibly knowledgeable, in her business and in ours, smart and wise, and as nice a human being as a human being can be. This is not the last time I'll work with her -- stay tuned.\n\nThe brand was introduced and positively received, but the business never really took off. Apple pulled out a couple of years later and started the Copland project instead, while IBM crafted a version of the software - named CommonPoint - which soon disappeared as well.\n\nAs Wikipedia summarizes it: \"The general sense was that Taligent was a threat to both the Apple and the IBM plans. Fred Davis, a writer in Wired magazine, wrote: \"This is a Greek tragedy: a child is born, destined to kill his father and commit cruel acts against his mother. The parents love the child and don't want to kill him, so they imprison it in a secret dungeon. Despite that, the child grows stronger and even more intent on committing its destined crimes. But then he dies of isolation.\" In early 1995 Joe Guglielmi left and IBM's Dick Guarino became the new CEO, starting Taligent on a new course as an object technology supplier in an effort to remain an independent company. But in the fall, Guarino died of a heart attack while jogging, prompting the end of Taligent as a joint venture. It was decided that Taligent would become a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM, focusing on developing technology and leaving the marketing to IBM. In January 1998, after two years as a wholly owned subsidiary, Taligent was dissolved and the remaining engineering team members became IBM employees.\"\n\nGreat project(s), great work, great colleagues, great client (Karen), and the intoxicating smell of a Renoir. What more can one ask for.\n\n--\n\nKey Learning\n\nALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE LARGER CONTEXT\n\nAt the time, I was excited to serve a leading company and was of course focused on doing our very Branding Best for each of those new companies under severe time constraints. But over time the real primary function we served became clear to me: provide the visual frontline, an initial proof point, a tangible persona for an epochal business promise made by the CEO of arguably one of the top five companies on the planet and in the history of Business -- so that he could say to the world \"see? what I'm promising is 'real'\".\n\nDid the twelve brands we created matter? They did matter as a CEO proof point on Day One, and they did matter to the employee groups that would exists under those new brands. But they mattered little to the businesses of those brands, as they would have run on the 'formerly IBM' provenance and reputation for at least a couple of years. The way I'd approach that work today (granted, based on what 'branding' is and what I've learned since) would be to establish a positioning foundation of IBM as a holding company, with a tendril as an 'IBM heritage' serving as the brand basis for all the upcoming Baby Blues rooted in Akers's breakup reasoning, then slice and dice it by the given company as appropriate, and then provide a communications-related 'exit IBM' strategy over time - which would or would not be used, according to how things evolved.\n\nIn the 80s, before the advent of true Corporate Branding in all of its fanciful conceptual depth, the tagline of Lippincott & Margulies, one of the giants in our small industry, was Influencing Perceptions -- two simple words with very profound significance. In the entire IBM involvement, more than in other projects, that's exactly what we delivered -- without really realizing that that's what was needed.\n\n--\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nI'll always include this paragraph at the end of every story. Branding is not black & white, there's never a clear right and a clear wrong, it's not formulaic, and it's never a fact: everything we do is a more-or-less educated opinion recommended to clients on the basis of a lot of homework, endless development hours sprinkled with a few moments of genius, and a healthy dose of self-confidence (some would say ... self-righteousness, or even arrogance) --- bought by clients based on their own background, beliefs, corporate politics, and again, opinions. I'm sure there's a parallel universe out there full of all our recommendations that weren't accepted, and I'm pretty sure it's a fully functioning one.\n\nMost importantly, as every project is different because every business problem to be addressed is different, you can never fully 'learn' and 'know' Branding and just be done with what you know. Experience is half of the worth - and credibility - of a brand consultant. And it is the job of the more seasoned consultants to show the way to a younger generation, to teach not necessarily how to do things (although some best practices are going extinct, sadly), but most importantly a Way of Thinking.\n\n--\n\n(the next story: THE RYDER CUP, 2007-2008)\n\n--"
