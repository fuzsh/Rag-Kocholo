Is a picture of the form acceptable?\n\nNo, a picture of the form is not acceptable. The form must be in PDF file format. If you are unable to complete the PDF form, mail the original paper application.\n\nQ: How many Product Types may I apply for?\n\nA maximum of eight (8) Product Types are allowed on a permit at any time. On the CFO application form, each line on the Product Types dropdown field is a separate Product Type. For example, \"Baked Goods\" is one Product Type.\n\nQ: Why are the number of Product Types restricted?\n\nA Food Safety Specialist carefully reviews each submitted product to verify compliance with non-TCS requirements. Each review takes time and resources. To ensure a fair waiting time for all pending applications, there is a maximum of eight (8) Product Types allowed for each permit. If you require more than eight (8) Product Types on your permit, submit a policy exemption request to: cfo@doh.nj.gov\n\nQ: What do you mean by Proof of Water Potability?\n\nPotable water is water that is safe for drinking or cooking.\n\nQ: How do I prove water potability if my home is not serviced by a municipal source?\n\nIf your home uses well water, a private lab must take a sample of your well water. The lab will test the sample for total coliform. They will provide you with a report. Submit the report with your cottage food permit application.

The letter must be addressed to NJ Department of Health Cottage Food Project. It must show the name of the water company. Send the letter with your application.\n\nQ: Why do I need Food Manager’s certification and how do I get one?\n\nYou need Food Protection Manager Certification (NOT Food Handler’s) because you are making and selling food to the public. Food Manager training will help you understand how to make food safely. You must send your certificate with your application. NJ Department of Health (NJDOH) does not offer training and certification. For training and certification, see our list of new Jersey Accredited Food Protection Manager Organizations.\n\nTop ^\n\nZONING\n\nQ: What are zoning laws?\n\nYour town may have local zoning laws. Those laws may or may not allow you to have a cottage food business in your home.\n\nQ: How do I know if my town will allow me to have a cottage food business in my home?\n\nContact your local zoning office to see if you can have a cottage food business in your home.

You must also have a sign on display with your permit information and the statement: this food is prepared pursuant to N.J.A.C. 8:24-11 in a home kitchen that has not been inspected by the Department of Health.\n\nQ: Do I have to list the allergens on the application?\n\nYes, you must state on the label if your food item has one of these major allergens: eggs, fish, milk, peanuts, sesame, shellfish, soy, tree nuts, wheat.\n\nQ: Do I have to include my home address on my product labeling?\n\nYes, you must include the physical address of your home kitchen on your product label.\n\nTop ^\n\nSALES\n\nQ: Can I sell Dog treats / pet food?\n\nNo, you cannot make or sell dog treats or pet food under the Cottage Food rules (NJ.A.C. 8:24-11.1).

Cottage Food Operators (CFO) are required to obtain a temporary food permit for the event as would any other food vendor. Local policies enacted by farmers market boards and other local governing bodies are outside the scope of any Cottage Foods regulations. Consult the local health department to determine the protocol for acquiring a temporary food permit for the event.\n\nQ: Can I prepare food onsite at a temporary event?\n\nNo. The NJ Cottage Food Operator’s permit is not appropriate for preparing food onsite at a temporary food event. Contact the local health department with jurisdiction over the event location.\n\nQ: May I sell my Cottage Food products to a retail store or a wholesale food establishment?\n\nNo, you cannot sell your food products to a retail store or a wholesale food establishment that will resell product. To operate a wholesale food business, a commercial kitchen and a Wholesale Food-Cosmetic License are required.\n\nQ: Can non-profit organizations produce and sell cottage food products?\n\nCharitable bake sales are not impacted by the Cottage Food Operator permit rules. Charitable bake sales continue to be exempt from regulatory inspection if the baked goods do not require refrigeration and the required signage is posted.\n\nQ: Do I need to register a business? How do I register a business? How do I pay taxes?\n\nYou are not required to have a registered business in order to apply for a CFO permit. This office is not associated with business registrations. For assistance with business registration and associated questions, contact your local City Hall.\n\nTop ^\n\nSUBMISSION PROCESS\n\nQ: What methods of payment are available?\n\nPayments may be made via e-check or online payment. Online payment with a credit card or e-check is available at the Cottage Food Operators webpage.\n\nQ: How do I submit my application?\n\nIf payment was made online, the completed application form CFO-1 and the supporting documents can be sent as PDF attachments via email to: cfo@doh.nj.gov\n\nQ: May I drop off my application in person?\n\nWalk-ins are not accepted and there is no receptacle for personally delivered applications. All applications must be filed electronically via email to cfo@doh.nj.gov or, if needed, mailed via USPS or courier to ensure proper processing.\n\nQ: Can I get expedited service?\n\nThe office does not offer expedited service. Each application is carefully reviewed for compliance with the Cottage Food rule and to ensure public safety. Provided ALL products submitted are clearly listed in the Cottage Food Rule, N.J.A.C. 8:24-11.5, allow 6-8 weeks for processing. If some or all products submitted are not listed in the Cottage Food Rule, allow 8-12 weeks.\n\nQ: Is the application fee refundable?\n\nThe application fee pays for the processing and review of your application form and is non-refundable. If the application is denied, you will be given an opportunity to revise the form and submit the missing documents. If you are unable to meet the requirements or choose not to resubmit, your application fee will be forfeited.\n\nQ: Can out of state residents apply for Cottage Food Operator’s permit?\n\nThe Cottage Food Operator's permit is only for residents of New Jersey.\n\nQ: How long is my permit valid?\n\nThe Cottage Food Operator’s Permit is valid for two (2) years.\n\nQ: Is the permit transferable from one address to another?\n\nNo. The issued CFO permit is only valid for products made at the listed address. Upon change of address, apply for a new permit.\n\nQ: Will my home kitchen receive an inspection?\n\nHome kitchens are not inspected by the Department of Health. However, if the Department receives notice that a Cottage Food Operator is preparing TCS food at a private residence, the Department may investigate. In the event of a foodborne illness outbreak, the Department or local health authority may act to prevent an immediate and serious threat to human life or health.\n\nQ: How do I add products to my existing permit?\n\nEach new product must be carefully reviewed and approved by a food safety specialist. A complete application is required for review purposes. To add products to an existing permit, complete a full application form, attach all required supporting documents, and pay the application fee of $100. If your product submission is approved, your permit expiration date will extend to two years from the new permit issue date.\n\nQ: I just received my issued permit and I realized I forgot a product on my application. Do I have to pay again?\n\nYes. Each submission of products initiates a new review process. A full application and payment are required for each separate submission of products.\n\nQ: Who should I contact if I have additional questions?\n\nYou may contact the Cottage Food Operators project at cfo@doh.nj.gov with any questions.\n\nTop ^"
