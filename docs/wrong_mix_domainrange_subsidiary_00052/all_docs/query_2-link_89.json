To pursue a master’s, you’ll need an undergraduate (bachelor’s) degree. Many degrees are specialized to prepare you to enter the job market as a highly qualified applicant or work as an educator in your field.\n\nDoctoral\n\nA doctoral degree is the highest achievable graduate degree, preparing students to work in the upper echelons of their field as either practitioners or educators. Many doctoral candidates complete a dissertation, thesis or project based off original research, defending their work in front of a committee of experts. Others take rigorous coursework that prepares them for professional practice and licensure.\n\nCertificate\n\nA graduate certificate is approximately equivalent to a bachelor’s or master’s degree, but with a more limited scope. Most can be achieved in a year or less, and many confer professional benefits such as licensure.
