        "text": "Kazuhiro Gomi leads NTT Research, Inc. as president and chief executive officer (CEO). Mr. Gomi has been at NTT for more than 30 years and was involved in product management/product development activities at the beginning of his tenure. In September of 2009, Mr. Gomi was first named to the Global Telecoms Business Power100 — a list of the 100 most powerful and influential people in the telecoms industry. He was the CEO of NTT America Inc. from 2010 to 2019 and also served on the Board of Directors at NTT Communications from 2012 to 2019. Mr. Gomi received a MSIE from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a MSEE from Keio University, Tokyo. Mr. Gomi is a member of the board at US Japan Council, a non-profit organization aimed at fostering a better relationship between the US and Japan. Personal interests include soccer, which he’s followed closely since the 70s. Since his earliest fandom, Mr. Gomi’s favorite number has always been 14.\n\nHideaki Ozawa is the COO/CTO of NTT Research Inc. He oversees Corporate and Technology strategy at NTT Research Inc. His focus is on research and development of new technologies regarding Environmental Recognition systems. These include image recognition, speech recognition language media recognition etc., Artificial Intelligence for human machine interaction etc, As general manager of the Smart Navigation division at NTT Resonant, he overseas technology-based web services, Web search for mobile, Multimedia search service, Mobile cloud service, Interactive Digital map, Local search service, Tele health service etc. Formerly, as General Manager of the IT development division at Walkerplus.com, he launched a major Japanese local portal service, Walkerplus.com, with Kadokawa Shoten publishing Co. Dr. Ozawa received his Ph. D, M. Eng and B. Eng, from Department of Electrical Engineering at Keio University. Personal interests include golfing and staying fit: swimming, jogging, etc\n\nDr. Waters earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University in 2004. From 2004-2005, he was a post-doctoral at Stanford University and then work at SRI as a Computer Scientist. In 2008 he joined the faculty at The University of Texas at Austin. In 2019, he was recruited to NTT Research as a Distinguished Scientist. His research interests are within the realm of cryptography computer security. His work focuses on Identity-Based Cryptography, Functional Encryption, and code obfuscation. Recipient of numerous awards and invited papers, he is noted as a founder of Functional Encryption and Attribute-Based Encryption. Personal interests include spending time outdoors with his son and daughter.\n\nHis background is in engineering and medicine. After graduating with a degree in Chemical Engineering from Auburn University, he studied medicine as a fellow of the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at Johns Hopkins Medical School, receiving both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees – with the latter in Biomedical Engineering. He specialized in cardiovascular dynamics, training with Dr. Kenji Sunagawa in the laboratory of the late Dr. Kiichi Sagawa. Immediately afterwards, he completed a fellowship in research cardiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine before additional training as a Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS) Fellow at Kyushu University. Academic faculty positions followed in Biomedical Engineering and Medicine at Vanderbilt University while simultaneously completing his residency in Internal Medicine at Vanderbilt Hospital. During that time, he also helped train astronauts like Dr. Chiaki Mukai for the Neurolab Spacelab Mission. Dr. Alexander collaborated with The National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center as a Visiting Researcher supported by the Science and Technology Agency of Japan. Following academia, he entered Pharma – first Merck, then Pfizer, working in various capacities including Field Medical Director, R&D, Business Development, and Medical Affairs. In Pharma as in academia, his passion for modeling and simulation extended across therapeutic areas. He is credited with creating several Pharma modeling platforms including The Lyrica Virtual Lab, The Neuropathic and Neuropathic-like Pain Virtual Lab, and The Pulmonary Vascular Disease Virtual Lab. Finally, he is a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology (FACC) with interests in heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and in medical devices. Personal interests include poetry, Russian literature, and TRX functional training.\n\nAfter obtaining a degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University, he studied the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac relaxation at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, receiving a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering. During postdoctoral and faculty appointments at the University of Vermont, he delved into molecular energetics in the normal and diseased heart. Shortly thereafter he joined a small consulting group, working on biomedical projects ranging from the detection and classification of atrial fibrillation to a teleoperated surgical robotics system. For the past 15 years, he has focused on implanted sensors, systems and simulations for diagnosis of cardiac rhythm disorders and heart failure. His primary interest is in the application of engineering principles to medical challenges. Personal interests include poetry, reading, photography, hiking and bicycling, and coffee roasting at home."
