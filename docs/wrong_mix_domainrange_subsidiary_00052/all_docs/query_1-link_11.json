Speaking in favor of the FTC, Ramos said, \"The FTC has shown that there is a reasonable probability that the proposed acquisition will substantially impair competition in the relevant market and that the equities weigh in favor of injunctive relief.\" An administrative trial was scheduled to start on January 18, 2024.[42][43][44] However, on January 5, 2024, IQVIA and Propel Media announced that they had mutually agreed to abandon the proposed merger and avoided trial.[45]"
