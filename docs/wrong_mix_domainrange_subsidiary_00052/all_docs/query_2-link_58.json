        "text": "This post originally appeared on the IBM Research blog.\n\nAt IBM we’re committed to an exploratory science agenda, working with companies to advance innovation research and learning within their ecosystem. Today, IBM is embarking on a multi-year, collaborative effort with Wells Fargo focused on research and learning that is intended to enhance the company’s artificial intelligence and quantum computing capabilities. Together with IBM, Wells Fargo plans to accelerate its learnings to inform innovation initiatives that reimagine the future of financial services in a way that is designed to deliver customer experiences that are simple, fast, safe and convenient.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Wells Fargo will join the IBM Q Network, a community of Fortune 500 companies, startups, academic institutions and research labs working to advance quantum computing and explore practical applications. IBM will provide Wells Fargo access to the world’s largest fleet of quantum computing systems for commercial use case exploration and fundamental research at the IBM Quantum Computation Center.\n\nWells Fargo will also participate in the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, engaging with research scientists from MIT and IBM Research in pursuit of leading-edge AI advances that hold the potential to transform how business is done.\n\n“Wells Fargo is very excited to accelerate our learning efforts in artificial intelligence and quantum computing through this relationship with IBM Research,” said Ravi Radhakrishnan, head of Wholesale, Wealth & Investment Management, and Innovation Technology at Wells Fargo. “We are looking forward to exploring how advances in artificial intelligence and quantum computing can help make banking faster, easier, smarter, and safer — for our customers and the whole financial services industry.”\n\n“We are delighted to be able to work with Wells Fargo to explore how the frontiers of information technology, from AI to quantum computing, will ultimately impact the financial sector and the banking experience,” said Dario Gil, director of IBM Research."
