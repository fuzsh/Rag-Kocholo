ExxonMobil, CERN, Argonne National Laboratory, Fermilab, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory join the IBM Q Network.

Energy giant ExxonMobil and some of the world's pre-eminent research laboratories including CERN, Argonne, Fermilab, and Lawrence Berkeley are joining the IBM Q Network, IBM announced today at the 2019 Consumer Electronics show (CES) in Las Vegas.

The IBM Q Network is the world's first community of Fortune 500 companies, startups, academic institutions and research labs working with IBM to advance quantum computing and explore practical applications for business and science.

For example, future applications for quantum computing may include finding and developing new materials for automotive application through quantum chemistry.

“As we continue our own research and development efforts toward advancing new energy technologies, our agreement with IBM will allow us to expand our knowledge base and potentially apply new solutions in computing to further advance those efforts,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development for ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company.

ExxonMobil will become the first energy company to join the IBM Q Network.
