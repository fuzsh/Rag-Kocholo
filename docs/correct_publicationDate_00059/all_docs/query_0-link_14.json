        "text": "Time's Eye - A Wonderful Story\n\nArthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter team up to bring a story of the ages. The book begins with a Time Distortion that leaves a cast of characters trapped in a mixture of time. The main character turns out to be a U.N. peace keeper named Bisesa Dutt who is from the year 2037. Bisesa and her fellow 'Time Travelers' link up with others who are trapped in time. On their journey they meet up with Rudyard Kipling, Alexander the Great and his mighty army and a number of others. What follows is a wonderful story of survival in a world where nothing makes sense, especially time. Arthur C. Clarke is known for his great story telling and anyone who likes Clarke's work will love this book. I am not real familiar with Steven Baxter adds a lot of technical details to this wonderful story. Rated 4 of 5 for an interesting story and a very well thought out time adventure. If you like this book, don't miss Sunstorm, the second book in the Time Odyssey stories.Read full review\n\nA cosmic ride through time in space\n\nI Originally, borrowed this book from our public library. I thought it was such a great book, that I wanted to have it for my own. This book will appeal to science fiction fans, history buffs, philosophers or anyone who is looking for a book filled with fast-paced adventure and imagination. The story brings characters from the 19th and 21st century together, with the armies of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great. The book includes several major story lines, during divergent time-periods, which all convene in an exciting conclusion. The authors, Clark and Baxter do a great job conveying several major plots without confusing the reader. The reader is kept in suspense throughout the book. The conclusion of the book left me with some unanswered philosophical questions, which are hopefully addressed in the sequel (Sun Storm). Overall I recommend this book. I felt that Times Eye was intelligent and highly entertaining.Read full review"
