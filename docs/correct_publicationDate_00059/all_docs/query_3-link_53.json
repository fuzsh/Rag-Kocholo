O'Brien and Charles Willis) English novelist, short-story writer, essayist, editor, critic, autobiographer, and nonfiction writer.\n\nThe following entry presents an overview of Clarke's career through 2005.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRenowned not only for his science fiction, which has earned him the title of Grand Master from the Science Fiction Writers of America, Clarke has also developed a reputation for his first-rate scientific and technical writing. Perhaps best known in this field for \"Extraterrestrial Relays,\" the 1945 article in which he first proposed the idea of communications satellites, Clarke has published works on such diverse topics as underwater diving, space exploration, and scientific extrapolation. Nevertheless, Clarke is most recognized for his accessible and dynamic portrayals of the scientific aspects of astronomy and physics in his novels and short stories. In addition, he is noted for his optimistic views regarding the uses of technology, which contrast sharply with the prevailing mood of distrust and uneasiness found in much of the science fiction genre. Many of his novels, including Childhood's End (1953) and Rendezvous with Rama (1973), have earned critical acclaim, but his most famous works are his screenplay and subsequent novel 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), which has been consistently hailed as the most important science fiction film of the twentieth century.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\n\nClarke was born on December 16, 1917, in Mine-head, Somersetshire, England, to Charles Wright and Norah Willis Clarke. He began to read science fiction around the age of twelve and quickly became enamored with the genre. He wrote for his school publication until economic circumstances forced him to secure a position as an auditor for the British government. While living in London, Clarke joined the British Interplanetary Society, a science fiction and space enthusiasts club, where he was introduced to other science fiction writers and editors. Soon after, he began to publish short stories as well as scientific articles addressing the feasibility of space travel. In 1941 Clarke enlisted in the Royal Air Force, serving as a radar instructor. During this period, Clarke published an article in Wireless World, advocating the use of synchronous satellites for communication, a revolutionary idea at the time. After the war, Clarke earned degrees in physics and in pure and applied mathematics from King's College at the University of London. Clarke won critical praise for his nonfiction tome The Exploration of Space (1951), which some have argued is one of the first books to present an accurate scientific discussion in a manner accessible to average readers. After the success of The Exploration of Space and his novel Childhood's End, Clarke was able to pursue writing full-time. During the 1960s and 1970s, Clarke continued to build on his reputation and developed an avid following, publishing a new novel almost every year. In collaboration with famed film director Stanley Kubrick, Clarke co-authored the screenplay for 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968, which has since become one of the canonical works of science fiction cinema. The film earned four Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best screenplay for Clarke and Kubrick. Clarke followed the film with a novel of the same name, a text that expands upon events in the movie. His 1973 novel Rendezvous with Rama earned him four of the highest honors in science fiction literature: the Nebula, Hugo, John W. Campbell Memorial, and Jupiter Awards. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Clarke continued his \"Odyssey\" series with three additional novels, concluding with 3001: The Final Odyssey in 1997. Clarke has also been recognized for his involvement in television, beginning with his co-broadcast of the Apollo space missions and for his work on several space exploration documentaries. In addition, he has published numerous nonfiction books about deep sea diving and operates a diving school in Sri Lanka, where he has resided since the 1950s. In 1988 Clarke was diagnosed with post-polio syndrome, forcing his continued reliance on a wheelchair. While Clarke has struggled with health issues, he has since co-authored several novels and accepted a wide array of awards and accolades, including a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 1994. Recognized as a Knight Bachelor by the British Empire in 2000, he has also served as the honorary head of the Institute for Cooperation in Space, the Chancellor of the International Space University, and the head of Moratuwa University in Sri Lanka. In 2005 he was presented with the Lankabhimanaya Award, the highest civilian honor in Sri Lanka.\n\nMAJOR WORKS\n\nThroughout his lengthy career, Clarke has been a prolific writer of both fiction and nonfiction. In Clarke's early works, which primarily consist of nonfiction accounts of theoretical science and juvenile short stories, several critics have identified a thematic undercurrent, which Thomas Clareson regards as \"strongly didactic, reflecting Clarke's desire to sell astronautics to the public.\" For Clarke, however, the \"prime function of a story is to entertain—not to instruct or preach,\" a philosophy that may account for his noticeable attempts to use clear expressions of manifest and real-world descriptions to convey his personal vision of the future, as opposed to normative science fiction conventions. In regards to his nonfiction writing, Clarke has been admired for his lucid, dynamic prose and his ability to explain complicated scientific ideas. This same skill carries over into his fiction, where his plots are routinely based upon factual scientific information culled from the fields of astronomy and physics, prompting Clarke to incorporate new ideas and theories into his books as time progresses. His early works can be divided into two categories: works in which he concentrates on technology and space adventure and novels in which he focuses on metaphysical themes. One of his most highly regarded novels, Childhood's End, falls into the second category. Throughout the narrative, Clarke describes an alien life force that creates a utopia on Earth, only to destroy the planet before abducting all of the world's children. The novel treats the potentially negative consequences of human contact with aliens, while additionally examining transcendental philosophy and the nature of utopias. Clarke's speculative fiction encompasses a broad scope of thematic subtexts, including British colonialism in Childhood's End, environmentalism in Dolphin Island (1963), and the threat of runaway technology in The Light of Other Days (2000). The interaction between science and religion is another of Clarke's most common recurring motifs and can been seen in The Nine Billion Names of God (1967), Rendezvous with Rama, and the short story \"The Star\" (1955). In \"The Star,\" a space traveler discovers the remains of a great civilization destroyed by the same star that guided the Magi—or Three Wise Men—to the newborn Jesus in Biblical history. The miracle of Jesus and his revelation to the world is juxtaposed against that of an apocalypse for another civilization, creating frightening hypotheticals about the nature of God.\n\nPossibly the author's most famous work, 2001 is based upon Clarke's earlier short story \"The Sentinel,\" in which aliens place giant black monoliths on the Earth and moon to aid humans in their further evolution as a species. While traveling through space to investigate the forces responsible for creating the monoliths, HAL 9000—a super-computer powered by a sentient artificial intelligence—attempts to take control of its spacecraft in order to sabotage the mission, leaving the sole surviving astronaut, Dave Bowman, to stop HAL's machinations. The text focuses on the relationship between man and technology, illuminating the dangers of total human dependence upon machines as well as the tenuous uncertainty of human life in the universe. Clarke's later work includes the novels Rendezvous with Rama and The Fountains of Paradise (1979). The former centers upon the human investigation of an alien spacecraft and the resulting impact of extraterrestrial life on mankind. In The Fountains of Paradise, Clarke depicts a God-like man who combines his near-omniscient intelligence with modern technological developments. In the subsequent novels of the \"Odyssey\" series, Clarke advances the story of the monoliths through several generations of astronauts, examining their difficulties in comprehending the scope of the galaxy that they have spent their lives exploring. In the last novel of the \"Odyssey\" series, 3001: The Final Odyssey, Clarke introduces the concept that the aliens who created the monoliths in 2001 were not acting for the benevolent good of humanity, but rather were working toward the sinister aim of controlling the evolution of mankind.\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\nClarke has been recognized as one of the three deans of twentieth-century science fiction, along with his fellow masters Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, and his writing has attracted favorable comparisons to such nineteenth-century science fiction legends as H. G. Wells. Though critics have been generally less enthusiastic about the work Clarke has published since the 1970s, he is still widely regarded as among the most influential science fiction writers of all time—one who helped set the parameters of the science fiction genre and who consistently introduced new concepts and ideas in his work. Reviewers have noted his strong interest in technological advancements and his accurate depictions of new developments in space exploration. In addition, many have argued that Clarke depicts an unusually varied and complex portrayal of alien life throughout his fiction. Such supporters have been quick to applaud Clarke for rejecting the science fiction stereotype of threatening alien life forms that are vastly different from humans and bent on destruction and, instead, choosing to illuminate the nature of humanity through a juxtaposition of benevolent human and alien life. Although most science fiction scholars have almost universally criticized the subsequent \"Odyssey\" novels published after 2001, several have asserted that, while the books fail to measure up to Clarke's earlier works, even the author's later fiction still surpasses the efforts of many contemporary science fiction authors. Speaking of Clarke's unique ability to present ambitious philosophical and technological speculation throughout his reader-friendly texts, Donald L. Lawler has stated that, \"no reader of Clarke will want to ignore the outstanding success with which the author manages his special effects and the skill with which he again brings together scientific symbols and mythic patterns to give expression to his vision of both a possible and hopeful future.\"\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\nScience Fiction\n\nPrelude to Space (novel) 1951; also published as Master of Space, 1961, and The Space Dreamers, 1969\n\nThe Sands of Mars (novel) 1951\n\nIslands in the Sky (novel) 1952\n\nAgainst the Fall of Night (novel) 1953; revised as The City and the Stars, 1956\n\nChildhood's End (novel) 1953\n\nExpedition to Earth (short stories) 1953\n\nEarthlight (novel) 1955\n\nReach for Tomorrow (short stories) 1956\n\nThe Deep Range (novel) 1957\n\nTales from the White Hart (novel) 1957\n\nThe Other Side of the Sky (short stories) 1958\n\n*Across the Sea of Stars (novels) 1959\n\nA Fall of Moondust (novel) 1961\n\n†From the Oceans, from the Stars (novels) 1962\n\nTales of Ten Worlds (short stories) 1962\n\nDolphin Island: A Story of the People of the Sea (novel) 1963\n\nGlide Path (novel) 1963\n\n‡An Arthur C.

Clareson (essay date 1976)\n\nSOURCE: Clareson, Thomas D. \"The Cosmic Loneliness of Arthur C. Clarke.\" In Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science Fiction Writers, edited by Thomas D. Clare-son, pp. 216-38. Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green University Popular Press, 1976.\n\n[In the following essay, Clareson offers a critical introduction to Clarke's body of work, noting the author's early nonfiction advocacy of space travel and his thematic preoccupation with the philosophical ramifications of man's first contact with extraterrestrial life.]\n\nSince the publication of Interplanetary Flight: An Introduction to Astronautics (1950) and The Exploration of Space (1951)—the latter a Book of the Month Club selection in the summer of 1952—Arthur C. Clarke has undoubtedly become the most widely known spokesman for those advocating space travel. Indeed, he has been called \"one of the truly prophetic figures of the space age.\"1 Yet despite such early awards as the 1961 Kalinga Prize in recognition of his success in popularizing space flight, the incident best measuring the impact of his dream of man's journeys to the Moon, the planets, and—ultimately—the stars did not occur until 1971. Then, during the Apollo 15 missions, astronauts David Scott and James Irwin named a crater near Hadley Rille for Earthlight, Clarke's early novel (1951, 1955)2 in which he used a twenty-first-century lunar colony as setting and suggested that the Moon will become the hub of the habitable solar system because of its mineral wealth.\n\nAcknowledging that \"the explosive development of astronautics\" during the 1960's had made some of his books \"very out of date,\" Clarke declared that The Promise of Space (1968) was \"an entirely new book\" which replaced many of the earliest ones and should remain \"largely valid through the 1970's\"; similarly, Report on Planet Three and Other Speculations (1972) contained his \"later thoughts on a number of subjects.\"3 As a result his nonfiction has a special value for the student of his fiction because in it one can trace the persistence and evolution of his themes as he continually explores and reworks ideas and situations which inform his short stories and novels. As in The Challenge of Space (1959),4 one may learn that he has used \"much of the material\" in three essays \"to provide the background\" of three early novels, Earthlight, The Sands of Mars (1951, 1952), and Islands in the Sky (1952).5 In one of those articles, \"Vacation in Vacuum,\" one discovers the \"Sky Hotel,\" which develops into the resort hotel on Titan in \"Saturn Rising\" (F&SF, March 1961) and, finally, into the hotel satellite of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Again, much later, Clarke pointed out that in the essay \"The Star of the Magi\" (1954) readers of his fiction would \"recognize … the origins\" of his prizewinning story, \"The Star\" (Infinity, November 1955).6\n\nAlthough it is everywhere apparent that his main concern involves man's encounter with alien intelligence, at the heart of his vision—most obvious throughout his nonfiction and early novels—remains the certainty that the exploration of space and the colonization of the planets of innumerable suns will bring a new Renaissance freeing mankind from the shortsighted prejudices and limitations of earthbound, modern civilization. Repeatedly he invokes images fusing his voyagers \"Across the Sea of Stars\" with those explorers who opened up the Earth, as he does in Prelude to Space (1951), which celebrates preparations for the voyage of the Prometheus to the Moon and climaxes with the departure of that first ship. In an epilogue, some years after the establishment of a lunar colony, the narrator muses:\n\n… Once more the proud ships were sailing for unknown lands, bearing the seeds of new civilizations which in the ages to come would surpass the old. The rush to the new worlds would destroy the suffocating restraints which had poisoned almost half the [twentieth] century. The barriers had been broken, and men could turn their energies outward to the stars instead of striving among themselves.\n\nOut of the fears and miseries of the Second Dark Age, drawing free—oh, might it be forever!—from the shadows of Belsen and Hiroshima, the world was moving toward its most splendid sunrise. After five hundred years, the Renaissance had come again. The dawn that would burst above the Apennines at the end of the long lunar night would be no more brilliant than the age that had now been born.7\n\nOr again, in The Challenge of Space, in a different but frequent mood:\n\n… For a man 'home' is the place of his birth and childhood—whether that be Siberian steppe, coral island, Alpine valley, Brooklyn tenement, Martian desert, lunar crater, or mile-long interstellar ark. But for Man, home can never be a single country, a single world, a single Solar System, a single star cluster. While the race endures in recognizably human form, it can have no abiding place short of the Universe itself.\n\nThis divine discontent is part of our destiny. It is one more, and perhaps the greatest, of the gifts we have inherited from the sea that rolls so restlessly around the world.\n\nIt will be driving our descendants on toward a myriad unimaginable goals when the sea is stilled forever, and Earth itself a fading legend lost among the stars.8\n\nAlthough Clarke spreads the human drama across future millennia, he often strikes a contrapuntal note by warning that \"Everyone recognizes that our present racial, political, and international troubles are symptoms of a sickness which must be cured before we can survive on our own planet—but the stakes may be higher than that…. The impartial agents of our destiny stand on their launching pads, awaiting our commands. They can take us to that greater Renaissance whose signs and portents we can already see, or they can make us one with the dinosaurs…. If our wisdom fails to match our science, we will have no second chance.\"9 Out of the conflict revealed by these admonitions came one of his finest short stories, \"If I Forget Thee, O Earth\" (1951), in which a son of the lunar colony witnesses for the first time the rising of an Earth poisoned for centuries to come by a nuclear holocaust.\n\nAnd when Clarke wonders whether or not the Solar System will, indeed, \"be large enough for so quarrelsome an animal as Homo sapiens,\"10 one conjures up the second of his stories to be published in America, \"Rescue Party\" (Astounding, May 1946), in which alien representatives of a galaxy-wide Federation come to save mankind just before the Sun goes into nova. Finding an empty Earth, they learn that man has built a fleet of ships to save himself. The captain muses about such \"very determined people\" and jests that one must be polite to them because they are outnumbered only \"about a thousand million to one\": \"Twenty years afterward, the remark didn't seem funny.\" Both narratives bear one of the distinguishing marks of Clarke's story-telling. Not unlike O. Henry, he likes a quick climax—often a single punchline—which may surprise but always opens new perspectives.\n\nAny misgivings that Clarke may have, rise from his doubts concerning the uses made of the new technologies. As early as 1946 he wrote:\n\nWe must not, however, commit the only too common mistake of equating mere physical expansion, or even increasing scientific knowledge, with 'progress'—however that may be defined. Only little minds are impressed by sheer size and number. There would be no virtue in possessing the Universe if it brought neither wisdom nor happiness. Yet possess it we must, at least in spirit, if we are ever to answer the questions that men have asked in vain since history began.11\n\nSomewhat later he approached this basic theme more affirmatively when he asserted that \"mere extension of the life span, and even improved health and efficiency, are not important in themselves…. What is really significant is richness and diversity of experience, and the use to which that is put by men and the societies they constitute.\"12 Still in the 1950's, while speculating about man's encounter with alien intelligence, he used that central concern to say something of man himself:\n\n… Most disconcerting of all would be the discovery that Man alone is a myth-making animal, forever impelled to fill the gaps in his knowledge by fantasies. (Yet if this be the price we have had to pay for the whole realm of art, which is always an attempt to create the nonexistent, we need not be ashamed. We will be better off than beings who possess all knowledge, but know nothing of poetry and music.)13\n\nThis emphasis upon both man's humanity and the need for it to shape the workings of society leads to Clarke's judgment of H. G. Wells, a judgment which seems a valid appraisal of Clarke himself:\n\n… Wells saw as clearly as anyone into the secret places of the heart, but he also saw the universe, with all its infinite promise and peril. He believed—though not blindly—that men were capable of improvement and might one day build sane and peaceful societies on all the worlds that lay within their reach.14\n\nWhen he adds that \"we need this faith now, as never before in the history of our species,\" he has completed the context which gives importance to that \"greater Renaissance\" brought about by the advent of space flight. In 1951 Clarke captured the significance of that awakening when he concluded The Exploration of Space with the imagined verdict that \"an historian of the year 3,000\" might pass on the twentieth century:\n\nIt was, without question, the most momentous hundred years in the history of Mankind…. To us a thousand years later, the whole story of Mankind before the twentieth century seems like a prelude to some great drama, played on the narrow strip of stage before the curtain has risen and revealed the scenery…. Man realised at last that the Earth was only one of many worlds; the Sun only one among many stars. The coming of the rocket brought to an end a million years of isolation. With the landing of the first spaceship on Mars and Venus, the childhood of our race was over and history as we know it began….15\n\n\"… the childhood of our race was over …\": there is a delightful irony in that line because of the widespread popularity of Childhood's End (1953), Clarke's only work—fiction or nonfiction—in which \"The stars are not for Man.\"16 Billed as \"a towering novel about the next step in the evolution of man,\" it belongs, most simply, to that group of stories in which vastly superior aliens intrude into the affairs of men—a plot having perhaps its widest vogue during the decade or so after World War II. In this instance the Overlords, who possess the form of Satan, terminate the Soviet-American race for the Moon, end the threat of nuclear holocaust, and in fifty years bring about a seeming utopia. (At their appearance one hears briefly what has become for Clarke an ever more important theme: \"… the stars—the aloof, indifferent stars—had come to him…. The human race was no longer alone.\") Creating an 'Earthly Paradise,' is not, however, the final purpose of the Overlords; they were sent, their leader explains, to act as midwives while the human race evolved psychically preparatory to uniting itself with the cosmic Overmind. The most dangerous threat to this development, he continues, lay in the scientific investigation of \"paranormal phenomena.\" Left to itself, such study might have unleashed forces capable of spreading \"havoc to the stars.\" The Overlords are racially incapable of taking this evolutionary step and do not comprehend the forces at work; yet while the Over-mind triggers and guides the change, they must act as guardians, protecting man from himself, until the last generation of children is ready for the transformation.\n\nThe novel ends as a solitary adult watches the children, now joined into a single intelligence, undergo a metamorphosis which not only releases them from their human form but dissolves the Earth itself into the energy necessary to complete the change. All of this in the presence of what seems to be \"a great cloud … a hazy network of lines and bands that keep changing their positions … a great burning column, like a tree of fire … a great auroral storm … the great misty network …\"17 Like other galactic races which have completed their probation, mankind has become a part of the Overmind. Although David Samuelson questions the artistic effectiveness of much of Childhood's End, he notes that \"we feel the tug of the irrational, in familiar terms. The Overmind clearly parallels the Oversoul, the Great Spirit, and various formulations of God, while the children's metamorphosis neatly ties in with mystical beliefs in Nirvana, 'cosmic consciousness,' and 'becoming as little children to enter the Kingdom of God.'\"18 One might add that its resolution recalls—but does not duplicate—stories by the followers of Madame Blavatsky and John Fiske in the late nineteenth century which sought reconciliation between traditional beliefs and new scientific data, thereby often insisting that the next step in evolution must involve some higher potential of the human spirit. The essentially traditional mysticism of that resolution, as well as the emphasis upon the children as \"successors\" to mankind with whom their parents would \"never even be able to communicate,\" may well account for much of the appeal of the novel, particularly in the classroom. A typical academic reading, that of L. David Allen, concludes that \"basically, Childhood's End is a religious vision of the way that mankind might develop and the desirability of that direction.\"19\n\nApparently many individuals have felt that such a transformation—\"apotheosis\"20—more than compensates for the loss of the stars. Clarke did not. He prefaced the original, paperback edition with the warning that \"The opinions expressed in this book are not those of the author,\" and in a recent letter explained that he had inserted the \"disclaimer in CE [Childhood's End] so people wouldn't think I'd recanted the views expressed in The Exploration of Space, etc!\"21 In view of his continuing attack upon orthodox religion—it surfaces frequently in Childhood's End itself—such a disavowal suggests a deep conflict in Clarke which may even have affected the artistry of the novel, leading, for example, to Samuel-son's inference that \"not fully in control of his materials, Clarke has attempted more than he can fulfill.\"22 In contrast, Allen believes that Clarke brought to the \"sweeping vision\" of the novel \"a sense of detailed reality … more concrete, detailed, and complex\" than 2001: A Space Odyssey. 23 Most importantly, the disavowal emphasizes the uniqueness of Childhood's End in the canon of Clarke's work. Its final sequence contradicts all else that he has said about the future of humanity.\n\n\"Earth and the Overlords,\" the first of the three parts of Childhood's End, was originally published as a magazine novelette, \"Guardian Angel\" (Famous Fantastic Mysteries, April 1950); it alone appeared separately. The basic action of the two ver-sions remains the same, although in a climax typical of so many of Clarke's stories, the novelette ends upon the suggestion that man's \"Guardian Angel\" is, indeed, the Devil. Not yet satisfied, Clarke closed the narrative with fragments of an earlier dialogue telling something of Karellen and thereby opened an otherwise closed incident:\n\n\"… and he put up a terrific fight before they made him take this job. He pretends to hate it, but he's really enjoying himself.\"\n\n\"… immortal, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, after a fashion, though there's something thousands of years ahead of him which he seems to fear—I can't imagine what it is.\"\n\nArmageddon?24\n\nClarke ignored that ending in the subsequent development of Childhood's End. Thus in the novelette it simply provided an amusing—startling?—twist on another story of the first contact between humanity and aliens. Once again, as so often occurs in science fiction, an idea rather than the quality of human experience, had fascinated the author.\n\nVariations in language and detail show Clarke's eye for revision, but the most significant difference between the versions of the story occurs because of the omission of a single speech originally in the novelette. In sketching the long-term plans of the Overlords, Karellen remarks:\n\n\"Then there will be another pause, only a short one this time, for the world will be growing impatient. Men will wish to go out to the stars, to see the other worlds of the Universe and to join us in our work. For it is only beginning—not a thousandth of the suns in the Galaxy have ever been visited by the races of which we know. One day, Rikki, your descendants in their own ships will be bringing civilization to the worlds, that are ripe to receive it—just as we are doing now….\n\n\"It is a great vision,\" he said softly. \"Do you bring it to all your worlds?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Karellen, \"all that can understand.\"\n\n(p. 128)\n\nHere, then, is the basic dream: man will one day become an active participant in the galactic community. Yet nothing of this passage remains in the finished novel. For whatever reasons, sometime between 1950 and 1953, even while he was popularizing space flight and advocating the journey to the stars in his other writing, both fiction and nonfiction, Clarke set aside that dream while completing Childhood's End in a fashion that could not be predicted from the text of \"Guardian Angel.\"\n\nIn light of his immediate disclaimer, his production of one of the generally recognized \"classics\" of modern science fiction speaks well for his ability to be convincing despite any personal disbelief in what he portrays. (Its reception also says something about his audience. While the majority continue to see it as a religious vision, surely one may read that final transformation as an escape from, a denial of the human condition. Nor should one forget that the metamorphosis solves a basic problem which Clarke raised in a number of his early works. Not only do the Overlords bring about utopia, they also close off the promise of space except for a few flights to the Moon to establish a lunar observatory. For Clarke, when the abolition of armed forces increases \"the world's effective wealth,\" when standard of living rises to a point where the necessities are provided free as a public service, when neither the arts nor science contributes anything fresh or expands man's knowledge, and when the earth becomes a vast playground as humanity attempts to escape the boredom of utopia, only a single question remains: \"Where do we go from here?\" Not coincidentally the \"Earthly Paradise\" of Childhood's End calls to mind those decadent societies of the far future against which his young protagonists rebel in works like Against the Fall of Night (1948, 1953) and The Lion of Comarre (1949, 1968). Indeed, Jan Rodricks' stowing away aboard a flight to the home planet of the Overlords echoes that rebellion. With the challenge of interstellar space eliminated by the Overlords, Clarke provides in the metamorphosis of the children an alternate answer—one with which he apparently was never in sympathy intellectually. Thus its uniqueness.)\n\nOther than Childhood's End, the longer narratives among his early works divide themselves into two groups, the first strongly didactic, reflecting Clarke's desire to sell astronautics to the public. Prelude to Space, written within three weeks during the summer of 1947, celebrates preparations for the voyage of the Prometheus to the Moon in 1978 and, as noted, climaxes with the departure of that ship. In the \"Epilogue\" Dirk Alexson, the historian who must produce an enduring record of that flight, reflects upon the successful colonization of the Moon and the coming of a new Renaissance. Wisely the shifting narrative focus stays primarily with Alexson, thereby making more acceptable the introduction of an abundance of technical detail as he learns about the project. This includes far more than the mechanics of the technology, however, for he readily understands the importance of the program to the future. He discerns, for example, that the men who are \"not ashamed of wanting to play with spaceships\" are \"visionaries, poets if you like, who also happen to be scientists\"; in the course of their play, they \"will change the world, and perhaps the Universe.\" They are the Space Dreamers.25\n\nAnother character summons up what has become a familiar image in Clarke's rebuttal to those who would spurn the venture into space because, properly run, there is no better world than Earth: \"The dream of the Lotus Eaters … is a pleasant fantasy for the individual—but it would be death for the race.\" (p. 89). Finally, on the eve of the flight as the Director-General of the project muses over a book of poetry, one senses that the fictional mask has dropped and that Clarke speaks for himself as much as any imagined character. The passage ends on an elegiac tone out of keeping with the optimism of the novel but anticipatory of a chord which has sustained Clarke's finest fiction:\n\nThe eternal night would come, and too soon for Man's liking. But at least before they guttered and died, he would have known the stars; before it faded like a dream, the Universe would have yielded up its secrets to his mind. Or if not to his, then to the minds that would come after and would finish what he had now begun.\n\n(p. 151)\n\nPrelude to Space has little plot action because there are too many things to describe and talk about, including overviews imagining the ship's departure from the atmosphere and summarizing the diverse, essentially uninformed public attitudes toward space flight. It is on the eve of the launching, through the Director-General that Clarke insists, \"We will take no hunters into space.\" The principal incident involves the failure of a religious fanatic to sabotage the Prometheus. In contrast, Earthlight (1951, 1955) introduces a spy from Earth into the Moon colony of the twenty-second century on the eve of an interplanetary war between Earth and the Triplanetary Federation. (That name alone underscores his intimacy with the older magazine science fiction.) Earth's ex-colonies on Mars, Venus, Mercury, and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn comprise the Federation; the issue concerns raw materials, for only Earth has access to the heavy elements essential to the technologies of all the worlds. Clarke has explained that Earthlight had its beginning as early as 1941 when he wondered whether or not he could outdo \"the splendid battle sequence in E. E. Smith's classic space opera Skylark Three [1930].\"26 So much attention is given to descriptions of the Moon colony and the lunar surface and to an extended account of a battle between spaceships and a lunar fortress that the spy does not reveal who had been leaking information to the Federation until twenty years afterward.\n\nThe battle is not an end in itself because the fortress masks a mining operation which, for the first time, obtains heavy elements from the deep interior of the Moon; thus, as noted, the Moon becomes the hub of the solar system, her \"inexhaustible wealth\" supporting all of the inhabitable planets. Again idea dominates. One incident, the sinking of a tractor beneath surface dust—related to the main story line only in that it allows characters with whom the reader is familiar to observe the battle—served as the genesis of A Fall of Moondust (1961). All of this is played out against the backdrop of Nova Draconis, the first supernova in this Galaxy since the Renaissance. Its appearance permits reflections upon the fragility of life, but unfortunately it does not attain a unifying symbolic value. Its presence, however, does emphasize how long the phenomenon has teased Clarke's imagination.\n\nThe Sands of Mars (1952) makes use of familiar patterns. Its protagonist, a famous science fiction writer, has been invited to be the sole passenger aboard the new spaceliner Ares so that he can write a book about its initial voyage. One journeys with him from a space station to Port Lowell, the principal domed city of the Martian colony. When he decides to throw in with the Martian pioneers rather than to return to Earth, his task becomes that of selling the colony to an Earth already weary of supporting it. The novel gains a unity because the point of view remains almost entirely with the protagonist, but apparently in an attempt to make the characters more complex, Clarke has added to the plot the contrived romance between the protagonist's protégé (actually his son by a young woman he loved at the university) and the daughter of the \"Chief Executive\" of the colony. More appropriate adventures occur: discovering a project so secret that most of the colonists know nothing of it; crashing into a geological fault in an unexplored area after a sandstorm of hurricane force; finding an unknown species of animal life which brings to mind Tweel of Stanley Weinbaum's \"A Martian Odyssey.\" Project Daw, as it is called, detonates Phobos, the Martian moon, transforming it into a miniature sun. Not only does it bring heat to the barren world, but its light will promote the growth of a recently discovered plant capable of releasing the oxygen from those metallic oxides which form the Martian sands. In short, Mars has been reborn.\n\nHowever readable these novels are, beyond the circle of science fiction aficionados they have their chief importance, as Clarke suggested of Prelude to Space, as a means of spreading the \"Zeitgeist of Astronautics.\"27 They are as much propaganda pieces as is The Exploration of Space. Yet they may also say something of the essential nature of science fiction. Even in Prelude to Space, the protagonists leave familiar settings to venture into unknown worlds, whether extraterrestrial or not. As in Earth-light and The Sands of Mars especially, much attention may be given to their technologies. (One recalls Clarke's frequently cited remark that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.) However, the true sense of wonder spoken of by him and many others lies in the exploration of those exotic, often hostile worlds. The protagonists may return or not—often they have come home; often they have created new homes. In Clarke intellectual curiosity may replace such reliable devices as those devastating catastrophes so popular with a writer like John Wyndham, but the result is the same. The issue is man's ability to survive in and comprehend those far lands, whether they are beyond Eden or beyond Jupiter. This mixture of familiarity and otherness, reality and fantasy, has led David Young to refer to science fiction as \"our most viable version of the pastoral.\"28\n\nThe degree to which he is correct may be seen even more clearly in a second group of Clarke's early narratives. In an introduction to The Lion of Comarre and Against the Fall of Night (1968), while acknowledging the emotional impact of Olaf Staple-don's Last and First Men (1930), and John W. Campbell's \"Twilight\" (1934), upon him as an individual and subsequently upon his early fiction, he wrote:\n\n… And, undoubtedly, much of the emotional basis came from my transplantation from the country (Somerset) to the city (London), when I joined the British Civil Service in 1936. The conflict between a pastoral and an urban way of life has haunted me ever since.\n\nHe went on to say of the two stories:\n\nThough they are set eons apart in time, they have much in common. Both involve a search, or quest, for unknown and mysterious goals. In each case the real objectives are wonder and magic, rather than any material gain. And in each case the hero is a young man dissatisfied with his environment.29\n\nOne discerns an indebtedness to Stapledon, but Against the Fall of Night (1948) and The Lion of Comarre (1949) are the earliest of those works in which Clarke responds to Campbell's melancholy vision of the twilight of humanity seven million years in the future. Having been served and cared for too long by perfect machines which will operate flawlessly until the end of time, the childlike remnant of mankind awaits extinction because it has forgotten the knowledge behind those machines and has lost the intellectual curiosity needed to learn again. Taken as a group, these works are restatements of Clarke's refusal to accept Campbell's pessimism.\n\nBegun in 1937, the year after Clarke's move to London, and not completed until 1946—after five drafts—Against the Fall of Night has retained a devoted audience, although flawed by its brevity and a reliance upon unembellished conventions from magazine science fiction. Clarke's feeling for it led him to expand it as The City and the Stars (1956), the only instance in which he has completely revised a published story. Its point of departure echoes Campbell. The immortal populace of Diaspar, the only city remaining amid the deserts of Earth, lives contentedly amid wondrous machines which fulfill their every need and desire. The people have never viewed the world beyond the walls of the city and know of the desert—the nothingness—only by legend; indeed, they are afraid to venture out of Diaspar. Much of their fear stems from a supposed fact of history: half a billion years ago the Invaders drove man from the stars; since then he has confined himself to his dying planet. (Like Triplanetary Federation, the term Invaders links Clarke to the space opera of the 1930's.)\n\nOnly Alvin, the young protagonist, the only child born to the immortals in seven thousand years, possesses curiosity and a desire for knowledge. Refusing to accept the \"gracious decadence\" of Diaspar, he seeks and finds a way into the outer world, where he finds the \"Land of Lys,\" a vast oasis of forest and grass-covered plains protected by mountains from the desert. When asked why he left the city, he explains that he was lonely. The tall, golden-haired inhabitants—very unlike the people of Diaspar—are both mortal and telepathic; they welcome him because during the four hundred million years since communication between the two cultures was ended by mutual consent, they have aided the handful of individuals who escaped from the closed city, seeking to \"regenerate\" mankind. His discovery precipitates a crisis, for he wishes Lys and Diaspar to cooperate, and they are unwilling to do so.\n\nTo suggest that Against the Fall of Night is an account of Alvin's search for self-identity is to read the novel as another exercise in psychological realism. It is instead an attempt to make a symbolic statement about the destiny of mankind. Alvin functions to destroy man's false concept of history—his fear of the Invaders and their supposed blockade of Earth—thereby liberating both cultures from their self-imposed confinement. As soon, however, as the escape from the prison of the city becomes a quest for meaning, the narrative surrenders to an assortment of conventions and devices from magazine science fiction. Too much happens too quickly. Whereas Alvin largely controls the action of the first half of the story, one feels that from this point onward he is manipulated by his discoveries. Nothing is fleshed out. To summarize briefly: he learns that from space, accompanied by marvelous robots, came a mystic who taught his followers to await the return of the \"Great Ones.\" Since the robots survive, one helps Alvin discover the interstellar ship left near Diaspar and now buried beneath the sands. Seeking the \"Great Ones,\" they fly to the central sun of the Galaxy, but find its planet devoid of life. Although there are ruins, Alvin, lonely and filled with despair, does not know where else to search for intelligence; he has observed the \"stars scattered like dust across the heavens,\" but realizes \"that what is left of Time is not enough to explore them all.\"30 Only then does Clarke intrude a solution.\n\nThe \"burst of power\" of Alvin's ship summons the creature Vanamonde \"across the light-years.\" He is \"a pure mentality\"—a mind free from physical limi-tations—whose creation by the \"Empire\" (the \"Great Ones\") consumed the efforts of all the races of the Galaxy for half a billion years. He sets straight the record of history. Man never battled with Invaders for control of the stars. Before he passed the orbit of Persephone, \"the stars reached him\"—with devastating effect, for everywhere he found \"minds far greater than his own.\" In dismay he turned in upon himself, studying genetics and the mind. Only after he had mastered such things as telepathy and immortality did he return to space to take his place in the \"Empire,\" whose supreme achievement was the creation of Vanamonde. Yet Vanamonde was a second effort; the first had been the so-called \"Mad Mind,\" which, for whatever reasons, ravaged—destroyed—portions of the universe until brought under control and imprisoned in an artificial star. It will one day gain its freedom; thus, after the creation of Vanamonde, the Empire abandoned this Universe for another.\n\nHere may well be a vision comparable to that of Stapledon's Last and First Men, but so sudden is the revelation, so vast the time span (how many billion years?) and cosmic sweep of the Empire, that all which has gone before in the novel dwindles in significance. Alvin, Diaspar, the Earth: \"I have made no reference to the Earth itself, for its story is too small a thread to be traced in the great tapestry\" (p. 207). Nevertheless, because of the cooperation of the two cultures and the coming of Vanamonde, a Renaissance is assured. \"Man had rediscovered his world,\" reflects Alvin, \"and he would make it beautiful while he remained upon it. And after that—\" (p. 212). Clarke undoubtedly improved upon the artistry of the work when he revised it as The City and the Stars, but the theme remains the same.\n\nSimilarly, in The Lion of Comarre, the young protagonist, who wishes to be an engineer and dreams of flight to the stars, rebels against a world grown stagnant. Just as Alvin was the only child born to the immortals in seven thousand years, so Richard Peyton III is the genetic reincarnation of Rolf Thordarsen, the builder of legendary Comarre, associated with the Decadents. Weary of \"this unending struggle for knowledge and the blind desire to bridge space to the stars,\" these men believed that the aim of life was pleasure and chose to build cities \"where the machines will care for our every need as soon as the thought enters our minds….\": \"It was the ancient dream of the Lotos Eaters … the cloying promise of peace and utter contentment\" (pp. 15, 61). Peyton finds the city in the Great Reserve of Africa, resists the attempt of the \"Thought Selectors\" to entrance him in a dream world while he is asleep, and encounters a master robot which has a will and consciousness of its own. From that meeting will come \"The Third Renaissance,\" when man and machine will share the future as equals. Peripheral to the group, \"The Road to the Sea\" (1950) projects a future in which mankind has retained the use of a few wonderful machines, although forgetting the knowledge behind them. Man has forsaken the great cities and \"returned to the hills and forest.\"31 Seeking to learn something of the new country into which his village has been required by law to move, as it must every three lifetimes, a young artist searches for the ancient city of Shastar. There he encounters descendants of those men who long ago had traveled to the stars; they have returned only in order to evacuate Earth—which faces destruction from a force reminiscent of the \"Mad Mind\" of Against the Fall of Night. Even a cursory glance indicates how closely these narratives are interrelated at all levels from imagery and incident to theme.\n\nTo emphasize the creative relationship of science and mankind, however bright a future it may portend, may well overlook those concerns which lead to Clarke's finest fiction. In The City and the Stars, while embellishing an early description of the mystic who came from the stars, Clarke accuses him of suffering from a disease that afflicted \"only Homo sapiens among all the intelligent races of the Universe … religious mania.\" He then declares:\n\nThe rise of science, which with monotonous regularity refuted the cosmologies of the prophets and produced miracles which they could never match, eventually destroyed all these faiths. It did not destroy the awe, nor the reverence and humility, which all intelligent beings felt as they contemplated the stupendous Universe in which they found themselvess.32\n\nUnlike those nineteenth-century writers, like John Fiske, who protested the astronomical difficulties they encountered in maintaining their beliefs, Clarke, obviously, is not afraid of the distances between the stars. Nor does he need to impose some deductive system upon the nature of things because, for him, the interaction of life, intelligence, and the galactic universe itself is mystery enough. However else one interprets these early stories, they celebrate intelligence per se, and in so doing anticipate his essay, \"Science and Spirituality,\" in Voices from the Sky (1965):\n\nOf all these questions, the place of intelligence in this gigantic universe of a hundred thousand million suns is the most important, the one that most teases the mind. During the past decade, the idea that life was a very rare and peculiar phenomenon, perhaps existing only upon our planet, has been completely demolished; within ten years we may know.33\n\nThroughout Clarke's fiction there is no want of life or intelligence; they abound in a multitude of forms on a multitude of planets: \"For what is life but organized energy?\"34 In Against the Fall of Night and The City and the Stars, while wandering the blighted universe, Vanamonde had found \"on countless worlds … the wreckage that life leaves behind\"; in Childhood's End, the first child to travel psychically goes beyond the range of the Overlords' ships and finally travels in another universe to a planet lighted by six colored suns—a planet that never repeats the same orbit: \"And even here there was life.\"35 But there is the other side of the coin, those stories like \"Tran-science\" (Startling Stories, July 1949) which are dominated by a note of sadness.\n\nIn \"Transcience\" —whose indebtedness to the mood of Campbell's \"Twilight\" Clarke has acknowl-edged—an omniscient narrator paints three scenes. A hominid encounters the ocean for the first time. While building castles in the sand, a small boy from a village watches the departure of the last great ocean liner, not yet realizing that \"tomorrow would not always come, either for himself or for the world.\" In the far-distant future, another child is interrupted at play to be taken aboard a spaceship into exile from Earth, for \"something black and monstrous eclipsed the stars and seemed to cast its shadow over all the world.\" During what time is left only the sea and the sand will remain: \"For Man had come and gone.\"36\n\nMost often Clarke has maintained an omniscient narrator so that he can, as noted, switch the perspective quickly in order to gain some desired effect. Consistently, however, he has achieved his highest artistry in those stories unified by a first-person narrator recalling personal experience, as in \"The Star\" (1955). A Jesuit, the astrophysicist of an expedition returning to Earth from the so-called Phoenix Nebula, finds himself troubled by the report he must make of what was actually a supernova. The \"burden of our knowledge\" has caused his faith to falter. On the farthest planet of what was a solar system, the crew of his ship found a Vault prepared by a people who knew that they were doomed and were trapped because they had achieved only interplanetary flight, not starflight. \"Perhaps,\" he writes, \"if we had not been so far from home and so vulnerable to loneliness, we should not have been so deeply moved\":\n\nMany of us had seen the ruins of ancient civilizations on other worlds, but they had never affected us so profoundly. This tragedy was unique. It is one thing for a race to fail and die, as nations and cultures have done on Earth. But to be destroyed so completely in the full flower of its achievement, leaving no survivors—how could that be reconciled with the mercy of God?\n\n… There can be no reasonable doubt: the ancient mystery is solved at last. Yet, oh God, there were so many stars you could have used. What was the need to give these people to the fire, that the symbol of their passing might shine above Bethlehem?37\n\nOr again, \"Before Eden\" (1961), in which the first astronauts to land on Venus discover a responsive, though mindless, plant. After conducting appropriate tests, Graham Hutchins, \"the happiest biologist in the solar system,\" reflects:\n\n… This world around them was no longer the same; Venus was no longer dead—it had joined Earth and Mars.\n\nFor life called to life across the gulfs of space. Everything that grew or moved upon the face of any planet was a portent, a promise that Man was not alone in this universe of blazing suns and swirling nebulae. If as yet he had found no companions with whom he could speak, that was only to be expected, for the light-years and the ages still stretched before him, waiting to be explored. Meanwhile, he must guard and cherish the life he found, whether it be upon Earth or Mars or Venus.38\n\nPressed by the inexorable deadline for their departure, Hutchins and his companion postpone a little longer—for a few months until they can return to Venus with a team of experts and with the eyes of the world upon them—this meeting which \"Evolution had labored a billion years to bring about.\" The mindless plant absorbs their wastes collected into a plastic bag and thereby contaminates the planet so that Hutchins' pictures and specimens are the \"only record that would ever exist of life's third attempt to gain a foothold in the solar system. Beneath the clouds of Venus, the story of creation was ended\".\n\nFor Clarke, these stories give expression to the central drama of the universe. He might be speaking for himself when he says of the alien visiting prehistoric Earth in \"Moon-Watcher\" (1972): \"Centuries of traveling through the empty wastes of the universe had given him an intense reverence for life in all its forms.\"39 Yet as the very language of these stories indicates, this reverence is accompanied by an anxiety which reechoes through his finest fiction, perhaps reaching something of a climax in his essay, \"When Aliens Come,\" in Report on Planet Three:\n\n… perhaps the most important result of such contacts [radio signals] might be the simple proof that other intelligent races do exist. Even if our cosmic conversations never rise above the 'Me Tarzan—You Jane' level, we would no longer feel so alone in an apparently hostile universe.40\n\nSuch a view surely echoes something of that horror felt especially during the decades at the turn of the century when science told man that he dwelt alone in an alien universe. That is why the apocalyptic moment of first contact is so important to Clarke; it dramatizes—resolves—what may be called his cosmic loneliness.\n\n\"The Sentinel\" (1951) captures the melancholy of that loneliness. Perhaps more than any other single story it has proved seminal to the development of his artistry. That it provided the symbolic monolith which structures 2001: A Space Odyssey measures but does not determine its importance. Once again Clarke makes use of a first-person narrator, one who recalls a discovery which he made twenty years earlier. From the first he fuses vividly his memories of the lunar landscape and what it was like to live aboard a surface vehicle in Mare Crisium during the summer of 1996. Because he is reflecting upon past action, one soon realizes that what is important is the implication of such a discovery on a moon proved barren by twenty years' further research. He guesses that early in prehistory Earth was visited by \"masters of a Universe so young that life as yet had come only to a handful of worlds. Theirs would have been a loneliness we cannot imagine, the loneliness of gods looking out across infinity and finding none to share their thoughts.\"41 And so they left a sentinel—a signaling device to let them know when man had reached the Moon.\n\nIn November 1950, Clarke first dramatized that \"Encounter in the Dawn.\" 42 An alien astronaut gives various tools, including a flashlight of some kind, to a prehistoric man already possessing a flint-tipped spear. This may be called the astronauts' story. That their own worlds are being destroyed by a series of explosions—whether supernovae or atomic bombs, one cannot be finally certain—well illustrates how a number of ideas and images wove themselves through Clarke's imagination. As he is about to depart, the astronaut muses:\n\n… In a hundred thousand of your years, the light of those funeral pyres will reach your world and set its people wondering. By then, perhaps, your race will be reaching for the stars…. One day, perhaps, your ships will go searching among the stars as we have done, and they may come upon the ruins of our worlds and wonder who we were. But they will never know that we met here by this river when your race was very young.43\n\nDespite the increasing number of references in his nonfiction to a possible meeting during some period of the Earth's past, he did not rework the plot until 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), where it becomes the first section of both the film and the novel. This version may be called Moon-Watcher's story, the story of the man-apes, particularly since the \"super-teaching machine\"44—the monolith—is substituted for the physical presence of the astronauts. The emphasis upon the education—the awakening—of Moon-Watcher and his companions completely submerges the sense of cosmic loneliness. Thus, not until the four short tales—\"First Encounter,\" \"Moon-Watcher,\" \"Gift from the Stars,\" and \"Farewell to Earth\" —first published in The Lost Worlds of 2001 (1972) did Clarke give the encounter its fullest development thematically.\n\nAgain the narrative focus is upon one of the astronauts, Clindar. A member of one of ten landing parties making a census of the Earth, he finds a small group of hominids. Possessing no tools and living \"always on the edge of hunger,\" they have not yet been \"trapped in any evolutionary cul-de-sac\"; \"they could do everything after a fashion.\" Whether because Clindar \"looked straight into a hairy caricature of his own face\" or because he saw one of the young males contemplating the moon in a manner suggesting \"conscious thought and wonder,\" he decides to intervene in an attempt to tip the scales \"in favor of intelligence.\" Left to themselves the near-apes would have little chance of survival, for \"the universe was as indifferent to intelligence as it was to life.\" And so he gave them an \"initial impetus\" by teaching them to hunt and use clubs.\n\nAs his ship departs, he realizes that nothing may come of his efforts because many factors could destroy \"the glimmering pre-dawn intelligence, before it was strong enough to protect itself against the blind forces of the Universe.\" Nevertheless, he and his companions install a signaling device on the moon to inform them if the descendants of Moon-Watcher reach their satellite. Then they will be worthy of a second visit. For \"only a spacefaring culture could truly transcend its environment and join others in giving a purpose to creation\": Clarke makes no more succinct statement of his central dream. Yet it is a dream hard-pressed by anxiety, \"for if the stars and the Galaxies had the least concern for mind, or the least awareness of its presence, that was yet to be proved.\"45\n\nWithout exception Clarke's recent major works—2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), \"A Meeting with Medusa\" (1971), and Rendezvous with Rama (1973)—have dealt with the concept of first contact, but none has significantly modified the philosophical stance presented in the encounter between Clindar and Moon-Watcher. 2001: A Space Odyssey suggests that those who left the Sentinel have now evolved into beings \"free at last from the tyranny of matter,\" thereby bringing to mind Vanamonde.46 Bowman journeys to the eighth moon of Saturn, Japetus, an artificial satellite which proves to be a kind of \"Star Gate\" through which he passes; he finally undergoes a metamorphosis changing him into a \"Star-Child\"—certainly an echo of the visions of Olaf Stapledon. In Rendezvous with Rama, Clarke pays explicit tribute to H. G. Wells's \"The Star,\" adapting its basic plot to his own ends, for the new celestial body plunging through the solar system proves to be a giant spaceship. Most attention is given to its exploration, although there is opportunity for political confrontation in the General Assembly of the United Planets when the citizens of Mercury launch a missile at Rama because it invades their solar space and supposedly threatens to become another planet. Instead it draws energy directly from the sun and departs, leaving the protagonist indignant because \"the purpose of the Ramans was still utterly unknown\":\n\nThey had used the solar system as a refueling stop, a booster station—call it what you will; and then had spurned it completely on their way to more important business. They would probably never know that the human race existed. Such monumental indifference was worse than a deliberate insult.47\n\nBecause the Ramans seem always to do things in threes, there is the final suggestion of further flights.\n\nIn contrast, \"A Meeting with Medusa\" attains the highest artistry of his recent works; it combines an innovative plot with an effective character study, and it gains unity by focusing solely upon Howard Falcon, though not told from the first person. He is a cyborg who flies a hot-air balloon through the upper atmosphere of Jupiter. And he discovers life in the form of a gargantuan creature like a jellyfish, a medusa. When it begins to handle his balloon, he flees. There is the final suggestion that he will act as an ambassador between humanity and the \"real masters of space,\" the machines; the awareness of his destiny makes him take \"a somber pride in his unique loneliness.\"48 Certainly \"A Meeting with Medusa\" suggests that Clarke may have found a new perspective from which to consider the old concerns.\n\nFor Clarke, man has chosen the right path, employing his intelligence and technology to reach out toward the stars. \"Though men and nations may set out on the road to space with thoughts of glory or of power,\" he wrote in 1965, \"it matters not whether they achieve those ends. For on that quest, whatever they lose or gain, they will surely find their souls.\"49 Somewhere amid the blazing suns and swirling nebulae, if only in the artifacts of a civilization long dead in the vastness of time, man will find that he has become part of a community of intelligence which alone gives meaning to the indifferent splendor of the Universe. Until then he must dream of the stars and, like Clarke, be haunted by a sense of cosmic loneliness until he finds the Sentinel.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Clarke.\" In Science Fiction Writers: Critical Studies of the Major Authors from the Early Nineteenth Century to the Present Day, edited by E. F. Bleiler, pp. 313-20. New York, N.Y.: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1982.\n\n[In the following essay, Samuelson assesses Clarke's broad canon of science fiction and speculative nonfiction, paying particular attention to his early short stories.]\n\nOne of the three best-known \"hard\" science fiction writers of the mid-twentieth century, Arthur Charles Clarke, was born on 16 December 1917 in Minehead, Somerset, England, in farming country. His early love of astronomy coincided with his introduction to science fiction and fantasy, in the pulp magazines of Hugo Gernsback and via the more literary tradition of H. G. Wells, Lord Dunsany, and especially the novelist-philosopher Olaf Stapledon.\n\nIn high school Clarke contributed science fictional sketches of his own to The Huish Magazine (1934–1936) before leaving for London to become a government auditor. Disliking his job, he felt more at home with other science fiction fans and members of the British Interplanetary Society (BIS), then in its infancy. To fanzines and BIS publications, Clarke contributed reviews, articles (some on science fiction), and stories before and during World War II. In technical journals he also published some papers resulting from his work as a Royal Air Force instructor in the new technology of radar, including his now famous 1945 suggestion for communications satellites in stationary orbits.\n\nAfter the war Clarke attended King's College, London (1946–1948), to earn his Bachelor of Science degree in physics and mathematics. Active in the British Astronomical Association, he also served for three terms (1946–1947, 1950–1952) as chairman of the revived and growing BIS, and he seized every opportunity to propagandize for space travel, in the assumption that Britain would play a significant role in it. This phase of his career culminated in his first book, Interplanetary Flight (1950), and its successor, The Exploration of Space (1951), a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, which made him the foremost popularizer of space travel. Nine more books and many articles on space would follow.\n\nClarke's professional debut as a science fiction writer also took place right after the war, with nineteen stories (sometimes under pseudonyms) preceding his first book of fiction, the novel Prelude to Space (1951). Although several of his short stories and four early novels took place in science fiction's \"consensus history\" of man's expansion into space, overseen by the presence of Astounding editor John W. Campbell, Jr., Clarke also wrote stories of a more somber, even melancholy tone—far future tales in which man's science and technology seemed to lead to a dead end, or in which contact with alien intelligence cast doubt on naïve ideas of progress. Some of his early stories also were essentially jokes, of the \"shaggy dog\" variety, or \"ghost stories\" as Eric Rabkin calls them. This whimsical streak climaxed with the 1957 publication of Tales from the White Hart.\n\nThe jokes continued after the mid-1950's, as did the near future scenarios and the more mythic tales, but this period marked a break in Clarke's career. A marriage in 1953, to Marilyn Mayfield, did not last long (a divorce officially came about in 1964), but his fascination with Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and the sea did. Introduced to the undersea world by the young photographer Mike Wilson, with whom he would collaborate on six books and a film, Clarke also discovered the Indian Ocean \"island paradise,\" which has been his home since 1956. After publication of another sixteen short stories and The Deep Range (1957), his science fiction production slackened, and the sea and the East began to play a somewhat larger role in his work, beyond the facile Odyssean parallel with space already evident.\n\nMaking the movie of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) with Stanley Kubrick probably earned Clarke his greatest fame and widest audience, but other honors have not been lacking. The science fiction community awarded him prizes for the short story \"The Star\" (1956); the novella \"A Meeting with Medusa\" (1971); and two novels Rendezvous with Rama (1973) and The Fountains of Paradise (1979). UNESCO's Kalinga Prize for \"the popularization of science\" in 1962 was the first of several honors resulting from his \"invention\" of Comsats, numerous lecture tours, and nonfiction works now surpassing twenty books. By the 1970's, academic critical interest in science fiction virtually guaranteed that Clarke would be the subject of numerous books and articles delving into his fiction, science writing, and those autobiographical snippets that can be drawn from his many prefaces and forewords and from a miscellaneous assemblage of nonfiction, The View from Serendip (1977).\n\nMost studies of Clarke focus on his \"mythic\" stories and novels of alien contact and/or the far future, in which there appears an attempt to transcend the biological and technological limits of the human condition. But the Clarke canon consists almost equally of \"scenarios\" and \"jokes,\" the latter mainly being restricted to shorter forms.\n\nAlgis Budrys once complained about Clarke's predilection for scary stories with surprise endings, which often failed either to scare or to surprise. Rabkin's description of these as \"ghost stories\" may be more apt, indicating that it is all in fun and connecting them to the more explicitly humorous tall tales. Certainly the scare-potential of ants ruling the world (\"The Forgotten Enemy,\" 1948), of a traditional bogeyman on a distant planet (\"A Walk in the Dark,\" 1950), or of a kitten in a spacesuit (\"Who's There?\" 1958) depends on reader naïvete.\n\nInterspecies miscomprehension is a subject for humor in other Clarke tales, ranging from paranoid fantasies of possessed people (\"The Parasite,\" 1953) and lemmings (\"The Possessed,\" 1953) to a bare awareness of each other's existence between humans and beings below the Earth's surface (\"The Fires Within,\" 1947). The failure to understand humans is dangerous to aliens only in Clarke's first two professional sales (1946), \"Loophole\" and \"Rescue Party.\" In the better-known \"Rescue Party\" (written prior to \"Loophole\" ), a mixed-species alien rescue mission finds that the sun is about to go nova—an impossibility, according to contemporary astronomical theory—and Earth is deserted. Even contrasted with the aliens' numbers and technological sophistication, this future Earth is still notable, by our present standards, for its accelerated development, culminating in an Exodus fleet, which the aliens deem unprecedentedly large as well as technologically primitive, relying on mere rocket power. Adrift and in need of rescue themselves, after a swift departure from the Solar System, the aliens jest about the potential danger these newcomers may pose to the vast Federation, leading to the low-key punch line: \"Twenty years afterward, the remark didn't seem funny.\"\n\nTypical of Clarke's explicit jokes are Harry Purvis' tales of implausible inventions, from anti-gravity (\"What Goes Up,\" 1956) and intimidated carnivorous plants (\"The Reluctant Orchid,\" 1956) to aphrodisiac recordings (\"Patent Pending,\" 1954) and insanity-producing music (\"The Ultimate Melody,\" 1957) in Tales from the White Hart (1957), allegedly told to a pub full of science fiction aficionados. Not every reader's palate may be sensitized to this special form of humor, but Clarke's predilection for it has been evident from his schoolboy days to the present.\n\nClarke's scenarios for man's exploration and development of the Solar System are noteworthy for their transparent style and matter-of-fact handling of technical details fully familiar from his contemporaneous nonfiction writing. \"Hide and Seek\" (1949) demonstrates the flexibility, superior to an incomparably faster and heavily armed enemy cruiser, of a spy in a spacesuit, if he chooses as his terrain a satellite as small as Mars's Phobos. Other rescues of helpless astronauts are made possible by flimsy sunshades inside the orbit of Mercury (\"Summertime on Icarus,\" 1960), by the weak gravity of the Moon (\"Maelstrom II,\" 1965), and by a battery of abacuses when computers break down (\"Into the Comet,\" 1960).\n\nTwo cycles, each consisting of six short-short stories, best illustrate Clarke's public-relations work. In the first cycle, \"Venture to the Moon\" (1956), the commander of the British spaceship Endeavour chronicles a joint expedition of the United States and Russia, while the second cycle, \"The Other Side of the Sky\" (1957), gives an insider's view of the building of space stations. Each story is a vignette illustrating a single point—such as the Moon's potential uses for advertising, archery, and vegetation; the value of canaries for detecting bad air; the favorable chances of surviving a brief exposure to vacuum; and the evanescent glimpse of what might be the hulk of an alien spaceship. Like his other contributions to the \"consensus future,\" these human-interest stories have little or no plot complication.\n\nThe static situation of an astronaut abandoned on Mars is charged with memories and allusions to previous explorers, Captain Cook and Admiral Byrd, in \"Transit of Earth\" (1971). Equally static is the elegiac \"'If I Forget Thee, O Earth …'\" (1951), in which a ten-year-old boy gets his first trip outside the base on the \"dark side\" of the Moon to get his first glimpse of radioactive Earth and learn the lesson of exile. In \"Death and the Senator\" (1961) a dying opponent of American space stations refuses a lifesaving offer by the Russians' orbital hospital. Even the obvious potential for drama of a race to the Moon between sun-powered sailing ships is short-circuited by a solar flare in \"Sunjammer\" (1964), and in Clarke's best-selling novel, A Fall of Moondust (1961), the drama consists largely of doing one's best to survive until rescuers can devise and execute a plan to release the passengers of a sightseeing tour trapped in a pocket of lunar dust. The characters are stereotyped, but the narrative crackles with wit, and the reader's fun is partly in trying to solve the problems posed before the rescuers do.\n\nClarke's reluctance to tell a traditional action-adventure story in the pulp tradition may be credited to his literary allegiances and a desire to downplay the thoughtless romanticism evident in such tales of derring-do. Whatever the reason, his few attempts at melodrama are not very successful—from two Venus-bound astronauts deciding who will survive on their limited air supply (\"Breaking Strain,\" 1949) and an expedition to an artificial Jovian satellite (\"Jupiter Five,\" 1953) to the kidnaping of the UN Secretary-General (\"Guardian Angel,\" 1950; Childhood's End, 1953).\n\nHe is more clearly in his element in those novels that attend to the first stages of settling the Solar System, as seen from an outsider's point of view. A historian of contemporary events observes preparations for the launching of the first Moon-rocket, a predominantly British effort from an electromagnetic launching track in Australia, in Prelude to Space (1951). A science fiction writer accompanies a ship to Mars just in time to see the colony approach self-sufficiency, in The Sands of Mars (1951). In Earthlight (1955; shorter magazine version, 1951), an accountant turned ineffective spy investigates the lunar observatory in time to see a fruitless battle—between an impromptu fleet of the interplanetary Federation and a hurriedly erected Terran fortress—presage the independence of the Moon, which is rich in mineral resources. All three works are lowkey and antiromantic, except in such lyrical passages as point upward, outward, and toward further technological progress, and in the effective dwarfing of man's puny battles by the discovery of a supernova, in Earthlight. With their deliberately distanced central characters, all three are debilitated by the necessity for long lectures and flashbacks and by awkwardly motivated departures from the primary viewpoint.\n\nTechnically superior is Clarke's first juvenile novel, Islands in the Sky (1952), in which a teenaged TV contest winner visits the \"Inner [space] Station.\" As George Slusser points out, this is virtually a parody of the teen-age space-adventure story that was then coming into popularity, with Clarke's protagonist typically passive, having things explained and happening to him, and with a brief scare at being lost in space. Unabashedly a sightseeing story, this book rehearses propaganda pieces about low-gravity environments, and ends like its predecessors with the protagonist's yearning to participate in further colonization of the planets.\n\nNot inconsistent with this consensus future, Clarke's stories of exploring the sea run in tandem with those concerned with space. The protagonist of The Deep Range (1957; expanded from a short story, 1954) is himself a grounded astronaut, Walter Franklin, with a wife and children permanently separated from him on Mars. In one of Clarke's rare attempts at a love story, Franklin's new Eurasian wife is wooed, won, and retired to homemaking from a potential career in ichthyology, but the major interest in the story is in the details of underwater farming and whale-herding. Remarkable also is the Scottish-born leader of a world-sweeping Buddhism, the Mahanayake Thero of Ceylon, who successfully puts an end to the butchering of whales, in part from his conviction that extraterrestrials may well judge mankind by its actions toward other creatures.\n\nCommunication with \"aliens\"—dolphins—is the object of the research base in Dolphin Island (1963), Clarke's second juvenile, in which an orphaned teenager is adopted by dolphins and dolphinologists near the Great Barrier Reef, one of the author's favorite skin-diving areas. The mechanics of getting Johnny Clinton to the island from the newly grown \"forests\" of Oklahoma (by stowing him away on a hovership!) are no more believable than the quiz-show prize of his predecessor in Islands in the Sky; but Johnny is a more active hero, working with the dolphins and, with their assistance, going for help when the island is cut off by a tropical storm and his mentor is seriously ill. Other \"people\" of the sea, in a follow-up to Franklin's questing in the deep, include the giant squid of \"The Shining Ones\" (1964), whose methods of electronic communication point toward the Jovians of \"A Meeting with Medusa\" (1971).\n\nClarke's joke-stories do not lack for aliens. Even some of his scenarios feature extraterrestrial life forms and artifacts. But Clarke's aliens seem more at home in stories with a mythic cast, often suggesting an advancement over man, which is technological, spiritual, or both. Here his acknowledged debt to the British philosopher Olaf Stapledon is most pronounced. A hint of this may be gleaned from \"Before Eden\" (1961), in which primitive life on Venus is wiped out by the detritus of human visitors; from \"Castaway\" (1947) and \"Out of the Sun\" (1958), with their barely conceivable energy life forms; and from \"History Lesson\" (1949), in which Venusian explorers find man's last \"time capsule\" and identify human life and culture with the antics of a Walt Disney cartoon.\n\nHuman beings of the far future have something alien about them, too. In \"The Lion of Comarre\" (1949), an advanced scientific society is rescued from stagnation by a young hero. He must first overcome the mechanized \"dream-factory\" of Comarre a previous rebel had set up, and separate its knowledge of the mind from its deleterious effects. Closely related to this fairy tale is Clarke's fine novel, Against the Fall of Night (magazine version, 1948; book form, 1953; revised expansion in 1956 as The City and the Stars ). Beginning with a vision of urban stasis in the \"perfect\" city of Diaspar—London as Clarke first saw it—Fall/City follows young Alvin on a quest through the post-urban pastoral perfection of Lys, and contacts with aliens (including the immature \"mental energy creature,\" Vanamonde), to recapture his people's forgotten space-faring history. As he returns to Earth to digest what he has learned, the ending suggests the coming of a new equilibrium of city and country, mechanical and mental, past and future, human and alien, Earth and space, in keeping with the fairy-tale construction of the novel.\n\nThis book has more than a little in common with the classic Childhood's End (1953), in which devil-shaped Overlords act as midwives to the transformation of man's last generation of children into part of the mature \"energy-state,\" the Overmind (a concept borrowed from Olaf Stapledon). The last stages of recognizably human existence are spent in varieties of utopia, short-range kin to stagnant Diaspar and Lys. But where the ambivalence of Fall/City leads to a fairy-tale equilibrium, that of Childhood's End leads to a radical split between the path of the human children and the path of the proud, individualistic, scientific Overlords. Clarke prefaced the narrative with a disclaimer, \"The opinions expressed in this book are not those of the author,\" as well he might, since Ouija boards, telepathy, the end of space travel, and aliens keyed to traditional human religious concepts are foreign to his consistent overt positions. But many readers have trusted the tale more than the teller, among them film director Stanley Kubrick, who enlisted Clarke's collaboration on another tale of transformation.\n\nClarke's contribution to 2001: A Space Odyssey was anchored not only in his earlier \"mythic\" or \"visionary\" novels, but also in two low-keyed short stories. \"The Sentinel\" (1951, as \"Sentinel of Eternity\") posited, originally in the shape of a pyramid, an alien transmitter on the Moon, whose broadcast signal was broken when man reached the threshold of space. \"Encounter at Dawn\" (1953) broached the idea of prehistoric tutoring of early man by alien visitors. Clarke's novel tends to be explicit where the film is elliptical, displaying less mysticism than Kubrick's vision. But the film and the novel both include alien-tutored apemen, the lunar transmitter, a sentient computer that deliberately kills the spaceship's astronauts before it can be dismantled, rectangular monoliths, and astronaut Bowman's transformation into a superhuman baby.\n\nClarke critics find in these stories a mythic core for his fiction, sscontextualizing both his scenarios of space travel and his satires of technological complacency. According to this interpretation, achieving space travel is a necessary but not sufficient condition for man to transcend his human limitations. Certainly Clarke has sought imaginatively to transcend man's Earthbound condition; he has alluded approvingly to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky's dictum that man \"can not live in the cradle [Earth] forever\" and to J. D. Ber-nal's provocative suggestion in The World, The Flesh, and The Devil (1929) that star travel may demand experienced human minds in what might be called \"post-human\" bodies. Traditional symbolism drawn from religion and literature is also at home in Clarke's fiction, along with astronomical and technological figures, as is particularly evident in two of his best-known stories.\n\n\"The Nine Billion Names of God\" (1953) is an end-of-the-world \"joke\" in which, to the utter astonishment of the pragmatic Western computer salesmen and technicians involved, their help enables Tibetan monks to count all of God's names more efficiently, thus fulfilling the purpose of man and triggering the end of the world. There is little characterization and not much story, but the contrast and complementarity of Eastern goals and Western means effectively questions our complacency once again. The ending is a marvelously quiet punch line to a low-key story of technical detail: \"Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.\" But it clearly has not taken place outside the world of the fiction. Clarke may sympathize with the lamas, as he does with the Buddhist veneration of life, but it is not evident that he takes the ending of this tall tale seriously.\n\nBeginning with \"it is three thousand light-years to the Vatican,\" the Jesuit astrophysicist who narrates \"The Star\" (1955) reflects in that story on the findings that have troubled his faith. From all the evidence the crew have gathered, it seems inescapable that this nova, which destroyed a civilization except for remnants left in a vault on the star's outer-most planet, guided the Wise Men's way to Bethlehem. Putting aside the problem of a star's always being \"in the east,\" as in the biblical story, Clarke's narrative shows astrophysics confronting Christianity with a difficult question: what kind of God would use such means to achieve such ends? Although the narrator's faith is troubled, his trust in science—like Clarke's—is not.\n\nOvert dependence on \"Grace\" is difficult to demonstrate in a writer who consciously opposes mysticism and organized religion in favor of the individual's quest for scientific knowledge and enlightenment. Clarke may seek to speak for the human race's \"cosmic loneliness,\" as Thomas Clareson asserts, but he also speaks for the loneliness of the individual mind. When a man nicknamed \"Ego\" since his youth maintains an office called his \"ego chamber,\" and writes largely cerebral adventures, in which close human relationships play almost no significant role, we should take him at his word, as Jeremy Bernstein reports, \"that he has always been more interested in things and ideas than in people.\" Like George Bernard Shaw, of whom Clarke is fond, he may aspire to an ideal state \"above\" biological concerns. Those giant stairways (often spiral), pyramids, towers, or monoliths no doubt have Freudian connotations, as Rabkin points out, but they are also obstacles, challenges, stages in ascent along a \"great chain of being.\"\n\nTranscendence, in his latest works at any rate, is more explicitly naturalistic, even as its expression is more elaborately artistic. Howard Falconer, in \"A Meeting with Medusa\" (1971), moves in the direction charted by Bernal, from man to cyborg, after a dirigible disaster, which has made him uniquely suited for an expedition into Jupiter's atmosphere. That he is losing contact with other humans and is at the same time unable to establish contact with the electrically communicating squidlike Jovians is ironically emblematic of Falconer's position \"between two worlds.\"\n\nTranscendence seems totally beyond man in Rendezvous with Rama, when an asteroid-sized, hollow cylindrical alien spaceship passes through the Solar System to the curiosity and consternation of twenty-second-century mankind. The sexually mixed, English-speaking crew of the Endeavour, the only ship near enough, explore the alien craft, while experts fuss at a distance and the Mercury colony, fearing attack, sends an automated bomb. The reader puzzles with the crew over specifics of Rama's construction, appropriating what our scientific knowledge is capable of, baffled by the rest. Utterly insignificant to the ship and its \"biots\" (biological robots), they disembark just before it closes in on the sun to refuel for the next leg of its journey. Dwarfed by the ship's scale, with its three gigantic stairways, its central \"Circular Sea,\" and its (phallic) electric thunder-generating needles, Captain Norton nevertheless compares himself with the intrepid Captain Cook. With comparable equanimity he accepts the fact of his two wives (cf. The Deep Range ) and the attentions of Medical Officer Laura Ernst. Other variations from traditional monogamy are also hinted at. Part myth (advanced aliens), part scenario (planetary colonization), part joke (a \"ghost story\" ending suggests more alien ships will follow), Rama with its intense visual and stylistic precision reflects a new artistic peak for Clarke at age fifty-six.\n\nThe transcendence of history may be a subtheme of Imperial Earth (1975), the closest he has come to a traditional utopia. Twenty-third-century Earth has at least lived up to Clarke's nonfiction forecasts, having eliminated such present-day features as overpopulation, pollution, energy shortages, urban blight, war, even farming, almost government. Duncan Makenzie, second-generation clone of his \"grandfather,\" Malcolm (a founder of the Titan colony), visits Earth in 2276. He meets some Earth politicians; an \"old flame\" who was more interested in his older friend and rival, Karl Helmer; and Karl himself, whom Duncan's guards inadvertently kill (atop a communications tower with a spiral staircase). Duncan finally returns to Titan with Karl's plan for an alien-listening network to maintain Titan's importance and economic function when its atmosphere is no longer needed for spaceship refueling. Called \"Project Argus,\" it will be one to ten thousand kilometers in diameter (an immense engineering job looking forward to Clarke's next novel). Consisting of thousands of stiff wires projecting from Titan's neighboring Saturnian satellite, Mnemoysyne, it resembles a sea urchin Duncan has killed, convincing him that he has had \"a momentary glimpse in the Mirror of time\" (in turn recalling Clarke's explanation for mankind's \"racial memory\" of devils in Childhood's End ). But rather than clone himself according to plan, dark-skinned Duncan brings home a clone of the blond Karl, to replace dynastic stasis with a more random succession. (Breeding could have been just as effective, but normal biological ties seem to get in Clarke's way.)\n\nThe narrative is sometimes tedious; connections between parts and between actions are often schematic rather than clearly motivated. This structural peculiarity of Clarke's, explicit also in Childhood's End and 2001, is given metaphorical justification by the \"pentominoes\" puzzle explained in Chapter 7. The loose construction, moreover, allows for digressive descriptions of Earth's surprises for Duncan, which have attracted professional futurists to the book.\n\nClarke claims that The Fountains of Paradise (1979) is his last novel; if so, it is a fitting culmination of his career. Centrally it is the tale of \"master-builder\" Vannevar Morgan, who erects the \"ultimate bridge\" from Earth to a space station in synchronous orbit. Morgan's daring impinges on hubris, and his luck is tantamount to fate; even his demise is that of a hero, risking his weak heart on a successful rescue mission up the incomplete tower. Metaphorically, he stands for the active side of his creator; the observer side is Johan Rajasinghe, famous diplomat retired to his eyrie on \"Taprobane\" (Sri Lanka moved southward to straddle the Equator). Clarke effectively employs the lore and local color of his adopted homeland, including a Buddhist monastery that must give "
