        "text": "(December 16, 1917 – March 18, 2008)\n\nSir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE, was a British fan and pro. He was active in pre-war UK fandom and was known as ACC and “Ego” “after his most prominent physiognomic feature.” He used the pennames Charles Willis and E. G. O'Brien. He was GoH at NYCon II.\n\nFan[edit]\n\nHe attended the first convention in the UK (the 1937 Leeds Convention, which has some claim on being the first convention anywhere). He was also present at the second in 1938 and the third in 1939. After Maurice K. Hanson moved himself and his fanzine to London, Clarke became an associate editor of Novae Terrae from #18 in November 1937. He shared a flat with William F. Temple and later Hanson which was for a time the national headquarters of both the British Interplanetary Society and the Science Fiction Association. Known prosaically as 'The Flat', it was fictionalised by Temple as 88 Gray's Inn Road: A Living-Space Odyssey (2000). Post-World War II, Clarke was a member of the London Circle, whose pub meetings are remembered in the Tales from the White Hart. He attended Midwestcon in the 1950s.\n\nPro[edit]\n\nProfessionally, he began publishing with the short story \"Loophole\" and went on to publish such classic novels as Rendezvous with Rama and Childhood's End. When approached by Stanley Kubrick to work on a film, they created the movie 2001 and Clarke also wrote the novelization and three sequels. His stories \"The Star\" and \"The Nine-Billion Names of God\" are classics in the field.\n\nIn 1986, Clarke provided a grant to fund the prize money (initially £1,000) for the Arthur C. Clarke Award for the best science fiction novel published in the United Kingdom in the previous year.\n\nHe wrote an autobiography, Astounding Days.\n\nClarke's Three Laws[edit]\n\nThe first two axioms were formulated by Clarke in an essay, \"Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination\", published in Profiles of the Future (1962); he added the third in a 1973 revision. Any of them may be cited simply as “Clarke's Law,” though it most often applies to Clarke's Third Law.\n\nWhen a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\n\nThe only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.\n\nAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\nPersonal Life[edit]\n\nBesides sf, he was heavily involved in promoting space flight and in the post-war was chairman of the British Interplanetary Society for many years. His book, The Exploration of Space, won the 1951 International Fantasy Award for nonfiction. Also a science writer with a degree in physics, Clarke is often credited with popularizing the concept for the communications satellite, and the Clarke Orbit is named for him.\n\nClarke emigrated from England to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1956, to pursue his interest in scuba diving. He lived in Sri Lanka until his death.\n\nMore Reading:[edit]\n\nReminiscence of Clarke by Dave Kyle.\n\nEntry in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction.\n\nWebsite.\n\nAstounding Days by Arthur C.

The stories were collected in Tales from the White Hart. \"White Hart\" is a play on the White Horse where Clarke attended London Circle meetings.\n\nThe Exploration of Space[edit]\n\nThe Exploration of Space was an influential 1951 guide to the possibility of interplanetary travel by Clarke.\n\nAwards and Honors\n\n1952 -- International Fantasy Award for non-fiction.\n\nAstounding Days[edit]\n\nAstounding Days, published in the United States in 1990 by Bantam Books, is Clarke's memoirs of his youth in SF, which centers on three prozine editors: Harry Bates, F.
