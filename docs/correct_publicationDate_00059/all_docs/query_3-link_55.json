        "text": "Even today, anyone over the age of fifty or so is likely to think of Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke when the subject of science fiction comes up. Yet all three have been dead for a long time (Heinlein in 1988, Asimov in 1992, Clarke in 2008), and the field has moved light-years away from the genre they dominated for so long. At least two generations of younger writers have come along. In fact, some of them have already retired.\n\nToday, the big names in the field include William Gibson, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Neal Stephenson, all of whom published their first novels in 1984. But a new generation has emerged in the last decade—and that’s my subject here. A great many of the newly emerging masters, even possibly a majority, are women. Although I can’t possibly claim to have read them all, I’ve explored the work of many of the newer sci-fi authors. And here I’ll list the very best of those I’ve come across.\n\nFor each of the six authors in the list below I’ve noted the novels I’ve reviewed, with each title linked to its review.\n\nPlease note that the books listed here are all science fiction, not fantasy. I recognize that a great deal of the bestselling work in the field is fantasy, but it doesn’t interest me.\n\nPeter Cawdron\n\nPeter Cawdron is an Australian author who specializes in hard science fiction. He lives in Brisbane with his wife and three children. Goodreads lists thirty books he’s written, making him by far the most prolific of this crop of new writers listed here.\n\nRetrograde (Retrograde #1) – What life on Mars would really be like\n\nReentry (Retrograde #2) – A fast-paced science fiction thriller grounded in believable science\n\n3zekiel (First Contact) – A thoughtful treatment of First Contact in this new sci-fi novel\n\nBecky Chambers\n\nBecky Chambers self-published the first novel in her Wayfarers series after raising the needed funds on Kickstarter. Following the publication of the series’s third book, she won the Hugo Award for Best Series in 2017. She lives with her wife in California.\n\nThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (Wayfarers #1) – A delightful modern space opera that’s all about character development\n\nA Closed and Common Orbit (Wayfarers #2) – Lovable characters in this off-beat space opera\n\nRecord of a Spaceborn Few (Wayfarers #3) – A brilliant invented universe in an unusually good new science fiction novel\n\nTo Be Taught, If Fortunate – An excellent hard science fiction novella from Becky Chambers\n\nMary Robinette Kowal\n\nMary Robinette Kowal has published more than a dozen science fiction novels and numerous short stories, winning her a slew of literary awards. The most recent of those awards were the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus Awards for her novel The Calculating Stars. She is also a puppeteer and voice actor. Kowal is currently the president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFFWA).\n\nThe Calculating Stars (Lady Astronaut #1) – This novel shows just how good hard science fiction can be\n\nThe Fated Sky (Lady Astronaut #2) – An astonishingly good science fiction novel about the first manned mission to Mars\n\nMarie Lu\n\nChina-born American author Marie Lu writes science fiction for young adults. In addition to her celebrated Legend series), she has published seven other novels. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband and son.\n\nLegend (Legend Trilogy #1) – Far-future teens battling for survival in dystopia\n\nProdigy (Legend Trilogy #2) – In this YA sci-fi trilogy, Marie Lu imagines a novel future for the United States\n\nH. C. H. Ritz\n\nMississippian-turned-Texan H. C. H. Ritz, who goes by Hilary, was a web designer before turning to writing. She lives in Houston with her spouse (“a wonderful human being”) and her son. She is the author of three science fiction novels.\n\nAbsence of Mind – In an unusually original sci-fi techno-thriller, technology meets neuroscience\n\nThe Robin Hood Thief – A grim look into the near future that’s all too plausible\n\nThe Light Bringers – The power of positive thinking goes awry in this dystopian novel\n\nAdrian Tchaikovsky\n\nAdrian Tchaikovsky is a British science fiction and fantasy author who has written twenty novels. He uses role-playing games, including live action role-playing, in constructing his stories. He won the Arthur C. Clarke Award for Children of Time in 2016.\n\nChildren of Time (Children of Time #1) – Accelerated evolution is the theme in a superior science fiction novel\n\nThe Expert System’s Brother – An exceedingly clever science fiction story\n\nWalking to Aldebaran – A science fiction novel that reads like a fever dream\n\nAnd it’s also worth watching Marina J. Lostetter, who lives in Arkansas with her husband. Her debut novel, Noumenon, was outstanding.\n\nNoumenon (Noumenon #1) – A visionary science fiction novel with hard science at its core\n\nFor further reading\n\nFor more good reading, check out:\n\nThe ultimate guide to the all-time best science fiction novels;\n\nGreat sci-fi novels reviewed: my top 10 (plus dozens of runners-up); and\n\nThe top 10 dystopian novels reviewed here (plus dozens of others)."
