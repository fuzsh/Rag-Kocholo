Ross 2003).\n\nAlthough he long enjoyed recognition as the world's greatest living science fiction writer, it is not surprising that relatively few of Arthur C. Clarke's works have made their way to the screen—because most film narratives are character-driven, and human characters were always of little interest to Clarke. Instead, his novels and stories wrestled with ideas, ranging from microcosmic concerns about the best way to construct and maintain a moon colony to the very Biggest Questions of the all: What is the universe all about? What is its purpose, and where is it going? And how do human beings, and human technology, fit into the picture? Attention to these grand issues—which are manifestly the focus of his greatest contribution to film, 2001: A Space Odyssey—may be mistakenly regarded as glib and fatuous by anthropocentric critics like David Thomson, who insist that the subject of all great works must be The Human Condition. But the fact remains that human beings are tiny, evanescent creatures in a vast, ancient, and mysterious universe, and it is mean-spirited and short-sighted to dismiss those artists who choose, however unsatisfactorily, to ponder the implications of that undeniable situation.\n\nSince the scripts that he wrote for the pioneering television series Captain Video—and even their titles—probably are forever lost, and since few people have been able to see his episode of Tales of Tomorrow, Clarke's talents as a screenwriter must be primarily evaluated by examining 2001—a film with precious little dialogue but enduring imaginative power, regularly voted by critics as one of the ten best films ever made. And, as anyone familiar with the works of Clarke and director and co-author Stanley KUBRICK can attest, the film is more characteristic of Clarke's work than of Kubrick's work. Still, Kubrick must be credited with the decision to strip away all of Clarke's narration and explanations, making the film more of an evocative mystery than Clarke's accompanying novel, in which everything seems much clearer but more prosaic (one specific example being the elaborately decorous rooms in which the aliens deposit Dave Bowman, more realistically replaced in Clarke's novel by a bland hotel room constructed by the aliens out of Bowman's memories).\n\nA decade after 2001, Clarke attempted to launch other film projects—his novels 2010: Odyssey Two (1982) and The Songs of Distant Earth (1986) both originated as film proposals—but he had no direct involvement in the film that eventually resulted from the first novel, and no film version of the second novel ever materialized—which was also the fate of a once-circulating screenplay based on his novel A Fall of Moondust. But Clarke kept busy writing other novels and hosting three documentary series: Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World, Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers, and Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe. These are all entertaining but a bit strange, for unlike Leonard NIMOY, who could get himself genuinely interested in and enthusiastic about the paranormal topics covered by his series In Search Of ..., the more seriously scientific Clarke could discern nothing credible in reports of UFOs, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and the like, so that he mostly functioned as a skeptical commentator on his own series, dashing cold water on the feverish speculations of others interviewed for the series. He undoubtedly earned less money, but garnered more enjoyment, from co-writing and hosting a 1995 documentary about fractals, a subject which came to fascinate Clarke in the late 1980s and 1990s."
