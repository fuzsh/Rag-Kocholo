        "text": "Prelude to Space by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nPrelude to Space is the first novel Arthur C. Clarke wrote and is generally not considered as good as Childhood’s End (1953), probably the most famous of Clarke’s early novels. The publication history of this story is not unusual for the period. Clarke wrote the novel in the space of a month in 1947 but it wasn’t until 1951 that the whole novel was published in magazine format by Galaxy Science Fiction.\n\nRead More\n\nRob Weber | Arthur C. Clarke | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nChildhood’s End by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nThere’s something very comforting in the SF novels of Arthur C. Clarke, my favorite of the Big Three SF writers of the Golden Age (the other two being Robert A. Heinlein and Isaac Asimov). His stories are clearly-written, unembellished, and precise, and they focus on science, ideas, and plot. Though some claim his characters are fairly wooden, I don’t see it that way. They tend to be fairly level-headed and logical, and focus on handling the situations on hand in an intelligent manner.\n\nRead More\n\nStuart Starosta and Kat Hooper´s rating: 4.5 | Arthur C. Clarke | Audio, Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 2 comments |\n\nAgainst the Fall of Night by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nAgainst the Fall of Night, by Arthur C. Clarke, originally appeared as a novella in 1948, in Startling Stories. Clarke expanded the story and published it as a novel with Gnome Press in 1953. Still later he wrote The City and the Stars which expands some of the themes posited in Against the Fall of Night.\n\nAgainst the Fall of Night would be considered a novella by today’s standards;\n\nRead More\n\nMarion Deeds´s rating: 3 | Arthur C. Clarke | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 10 comments |\n\nThe City and The Stars by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nThe City and The Stars is a 1954 rewrite of Arthur C. Clarke’s first book Against the Fall of Night (1948). There are plenty of adherents of the original version, but the revised version is excellent too.\n\nAs one of his earlier classic tales, this one features many familiar genre tropes: A far-future city called Diaspar, where technology is so sophisticated it seems like magic, a young (well not exactly,\n\nRead More\n\nStuart Starosta and Kat Hooper´s rating: 5 | Arthur C. Clarke | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 2 comments |\n\nEarthlight by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nArthur C. Clarke is one of the most influential writers of science fiction. His quiet optimism, faith in science, and ability to tell straightforward but intriguing tales endeared him to a generation of fans that continues to this day. Earthlight, his sixth published novel, follows directly on the heels of his successful Childhood’s End, and though rather simplistic in presentation, adheres to the author’s style in perfect fashion.\n\nEarthlight is the story of Bertram Sadler,\n\nRead More\n\nJesse Hudson and Kat Hooper´s rating: 3 | Arthur C. Clarke | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nA Fall of Moondust by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nPat Harris is the captain of Selene, the only tour bus on the moon. Every day he and his stewardess, Sue Wilkins, take passengers on a trip across the moon’s Sea of Thirst. This crater filled with moondust seems similar to a lake on Earth, and Selene, like a motorboat, smoothly skims across its surface. By the light of Mother Earth, Selene’s passengers are entertained by glorious views of the moon’s topography, including the impressive Mountains of Inaccessibility.\n\nRead More\n\nKat Hooper´s rating: 4 | Arthur C. Clarke | Audio, Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 5 comments |\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nArthur C. Clarke actually collaborated with Stanley Kubrick to produce the novel version of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) in order to provide the basis for brilliant Stanley Kubrick film of the same name. So although the book can be considered the original work, the filmmaker also had a role in its creation, and Clarke also rewrote parts of the book to fit the screenplay as that took shape.\n\nReaders and viewers will forever enjoy debating whether a film or novel version is better,\n\nRead More\n\nStuart Starosta, Kat Hooper and Jason Golomb´s rating: 5 | Arthur C. Clarke | Audio, Film / TV | SFF Reviews | 2 comments |\n\n2010: Odyssey Two by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nPlease note that this review will include spoilers of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nIn 2001: A Space Odyssey, we learn that mysterious forces have guided humanity’s evolution. We don’t meet these forces, but we do see their monoliths. The first monolith appears before a group of struggling chimpanzees. When they touch the monolith, they are inspired to use tools. The novel shifts to the twenty-first century, when another monolith is found on the moon.\n\nRead More\n\nRyan Skardal and Jason Golomb | Arthur C. Clarke | SFF Reviews | 3 comments |\n\n2061: Odyssey Three by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nThis is not a great book. It’s really more of an extended novella or perhaps part one of Arthur C. Clarke‘s SPACE ODYSSEY finale, 3001. This story has none of the depth, nuance or scale of Clarke’s classic original, 2001 nor its solid follow up 2010.\n\nBeware of spoilers for the previous novels below. I’m assuming anyone who reads this review will likely have read the two preceding novels,\n\nRead More\n\nJason Golomb´s rating: 2 | Arthur C. Clarke | SFF Reviews | 5 comments |\n\n3001: The Final Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nThe elements that make 2001: A Space Odyssey a classic — the pacing, dramatic tension, smartly efficient plot lines — are mostly missing from Arthur C. Clarke‘s Space Odyssey finale, 3001: The Final Odyssey. What it retains is Clarke’s obvious exuberance for biological, technological and cultural evolution. Each book in the series represents an evolution in itself even, of Clarke’s own perspective and thinking on the growth of humanity overtime,\n\nRead More\n\nJason Golomb´s rating: 2 | Arthur C. Clarke | SFF Reviews | 2 comments |\n\nA Meeting with Medusa by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nIf speculative fiction has any stranglehold on literature, it’s the lack of limitations to the question: what if? Fantasy is a complete expression of this facet, while science fiction tugs lightly on the reins lest the imagination escape reality entirely. In Arthur C. Clarke’s 1971 novella A Meeting with Medusa, Jupiter is that reality. Clarke penned the novella for anyone who ever wondered what being in the gas giant’s atmosphere might be like.\n\nRead More\n\nJesse Hudson´s rating: 3 | Arthur C.

Clarke\n\nIn 2131, humans are minding their own business when a large object thought to be an asteroid is detected at the edge of our solar system. As it gets closer to Earth it is photographed and found to be unnatural — obviously an alien spaceship. A team of scientists is sent to meet the ship dubbed “Rama” and to make our first contact with an alien species. When they get there, they find Rama uninhabited and they set out to discover all they can about the aliens who must have launched it.\n\nRead More\n\nKat Hooper´s rating: 4 | Arthur C.

Clarke’s first short story appeared 15 years before his first novel, and much of his oeuvre is to be found in short fiction. In fact, despite the success of his novels — Childhood’s End, Rendezvous with Rama, and The City and the Stars among them — Clarke produced as much short fiction in the middle and end of his career as the beginning.\n\nRead More\n\nJesse Hudson´s rating: 2.5 | Arthur C.

Clarke\n\nThe latest scheme dreamed up by Dr. Vannevar Morgan, a materials engineer, is either pure genius or pure crackpot: He wants to build an elevator to space. He’s discovered a new material that he thinks is strong enough to withstand the gravitational and climatic forces that would act on such a structure and he’s found the only place on Earth where it’s possible to achieve his dream: the top of the mountain Sri Kanda on the equatorial island of Taprobane (pronounced “top-ROB-oh-knee”). Unfortunately, this mountain is the sacred home of a sect of Buddhist monks who are not willing to budge unless one of their prophecies is fulfilled.\n\nRead More\n\nKat Hooper´s rating: 4.5 | Arthur C.

Clarke\n\nThe Songs of Distant Earth is one of Clarke’s later novels, based on a shorter piece of the same name that he wrote in the 1950s. In the foreword Clarke states it is something of a response to the rise of what he calls “space opera” on television and the silver screen (he specifically mentions Star Trek, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas), which according to him are fantasy. I suppose one could see them as such if you stick to the narrow interpretation of science fiction.\n\nRead More\n\nRob Weber | Arthur C.

How about an ancient battle-royale between Alexander the Great and his army vs. Genghis Khan and his Mongolian horde?\n\nOh yes, sci-fi power couple Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter have all that and more in the 2003 opening to their A TIME ODYSSEY series, which, in theory, takes place in the same universe as Clarke’s SPACE ODYSSEY stories.\n\nInexplicably,\n\nRead More\n\nJason Golomb´s rating: 4 | Arthur C.

Clarke died at the age of 90. At the time he was working on The Last Theorem, a collaboration with another big name in science fiction, the slightly younger Frederik Pohl who died in 2013. Clarke’s health would not permit him to do the writing himself so much of the novel was written by Pohl based on an outline and notes by Clarke.\n\nRead More\n\nRob Weber | Arthur C.

Clarke (1954, free online or purchase at Audible)\n\nIn this Hugo-awarded Christmas-themed story, an astrophysicist who is also a Jesuit priest struggles with his faith as he returns from a scientific voyage to investigate a white dwarf, the remains of a star that went supernova thousands of years ago. What they discover shakes the priest’s faith as he tries to incorporate his new knowledge with some of the more innocent-seeming ideals of his order’s teachings.\n\nRead More\n\nKat Hooper and Tadiana Jones | Arthur C.
