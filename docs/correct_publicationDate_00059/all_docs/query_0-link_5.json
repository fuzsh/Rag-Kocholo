        "text": "interesting concept\n\nThe concept behind this book was interesting. But I found the story's characters to be flat. The characters seemed to fall into common archetypes, and this is worsened by the narration. Mr Lee does very well with English accent variations (at least to my untrained ear), but his American accents are abysmal. Driving me well beyond the point of distraction, I had to stop listening several times. Then I had to steel myself, bracing for the impending onslaught of his \"Southern US female\" before I could return to the story.\n\nI'm a great fan of the work of Arthur C. Clarke, but this story felt a bit directionless, with a plodding plot, and left far too many questions unanswered for me to recommend it. I know it is part of a series, but it feels incomplete as a separate book, and likely should have been combined with the next book.\n\nFun read!\n\nIt is fun to imagine the interaction of characters from vastly different time periods and societies. How do they react to being pulled from what is familiar? How do they deal with a culture that has different values from their own? One reviewer mentioned they felt the story was disjointed. I didn't feel that but part of the point is how do people react when their world becomes disjointed.\n\nGood Premise - Weak Execution\n\nTime's Eye is based on a fascinating premise -- time discontinuities that force people and places from different eras into the same location -- that soon gets sidetracked by annoying characters and a meandering plot that never resolves itself.\n\nHistorical figures, man-apes, and futuristic astronauts duke it out for supreme control over the new world while floating \"eyes\" record it all.\n\nThe plot takes off with a bang as characters from different times in history find themselves together in the new world. The plot then wanders aimlessy through deserts, wars, discussions of morality, and bids for power played out with real warriors and a female astronaut. Suddenly, the plot comes to an improbably conclusion when all the science of string theory is pushed aside and replaced by a mother's hopes and dreams to return home to her daugher.\n\nAlthough this book is the first installment in the trilogy, it isn't plausible enough to follow through with the rest of the series. Skip it and read the Space Odyssey series instead.\n\nNow this is science fiction at it's best!\n\nUnbelievably great book and good listening! I was swept up and away into the visual patchwork quilt of many times merged together and it felt very believable! I highly recommend anything Clarke has ever written. His view of the human race as a whole, almost as an organism, comes through crystal clear. He tends to be a bit off on the individuality, but not because of any lack of depth, I think it's because he simply \"sees\" a bigger picture.\n\nNot Bad, But Not for Everyone\n\nArthur C Clarke is a great author... usually. This story is good, but it does not seem up to his usual standards. It is an interesting enough premise. There are a few surprises. However, most of the characters are shallow or two-dimensional. In addition, the story seems to end a little abruptly. It is a bit disatisfying.\n\nThe narrator, John Lee, does a great job. The sound quality is not perfect, but it is not distracting. The narrator's voice, tone, and pitch are good.\n\nI like science-fiction, so I enjoyed this audiobook. If you are not a sci-fi fan, then this one might not be for you. It gets a little strange in parts.\n\nThere are heavy curse words, references to sexual intercourse (including using sex to manipulate), rape, cruelty, and violence. This audiobook is not for children."
