        "text": "by Charles M. Chafer\n\nCo-Founder & CEO\n\nFor many Baby Boomers, nothing preoccupied us more than the Space Race, epitomized by the goal of reaching the Moon. As befitted the times, those who observed and translated this great human spectacle for all of us became epic in their own right. One such observer was Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nInventor of the geosynchronous telecommunications satellite, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, underwater explorer, best selling author of fiction and non fiction, Sir Arthur was knighted in May 2000 for his services to literature.\n\nClarke wrote the short story, and co-wrote the screenplay for Stanley Kubrick’s epic film 2001: A Space Odyssey, widely considered one of the most influential films of all time. It certainly was for me – I knew, after seeing the movie in 1968, I wanted to be a part of the adventure.\n\nYears later, when I was living that adventure – heading up the Washington, D.C. office of Space Services, Inc. of America – I would have the opportunity at the 1982 UN Unispace Conference in Vienna to meet the man whose work so influenced my life.\n\nAs a speaker at the NGO session of the conference, I received an invitation to a reception held at the American embassy honoring Arthur Clarke – of course I went. I approached him, introduced myself and explained that rarely was I this forward, but I had to meet him. Dressed in a white sarong from his adopted home Sri Lanka, he smiled, deflected my reticence and asked what work I was engaged in.\n\nI replied that I was part of the team that would launch the first privately funded rocket into space later that year under the direction of retired Mercury astronaut Donald K. “Deke” Slayton.\n\n“Deke Slayton!” exclaimed Clarke. “Have I got a great Deke Slayton story for you.” It seems that Deke had been the NASA astronaut assigned as the agency’s technical adviser to 2001. As people began to gather around our conversation, Clarke explained that upon arrival at the vast sound stage at Borehamwood, southwest of London where the movie was being filmed, Deke was quickly spirited off for a tour, escorted by Clarke.\n\nContact us for more information or to receive launch updates"
