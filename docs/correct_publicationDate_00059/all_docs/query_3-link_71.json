        "text": "About the Book\n\nFrom early work like \"Rescue Party\" and \"The Lion of Comarre, \" through classics like \"The Star, \" \"Earthlight, \" \"The Nine Billion Names of God, \" and \"The Sentinel\" (kernel of the later novel, and movie, \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"), all the way to later work like \"A Meeting with Medusa\" and \"The Hammer of God, \" this immense volume encapsulates one of the great SF careers of all time.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nIn a single volume, the complete short fiction of one of the greatest SF writers of the century\n\nAuthor of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Childhood's End, The City and the Stars, and the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning Rendezvous with Rama, Arthur C. Clarke is the most celebrated science fiction author alive. He is--with H. G. Wells, Isaac Asimov, and Robert A. Heinlein--one of the writers who define science fiction in our time. Now Clarke has cooperated in the preparation of a massive, definitive edition of his collected shorter works. From early work like \"Rescue Party\" and \"The Lion of Comarre,\" through classics like \"The Star,\" \"Earthlight,\" \"The Nine Billion Names of God,\" and \"The Sentinel\" (kernel of the later novel, and movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey), all the way to later work like \"A Meeting with Medusa\" and \"The Hammer of God,\" this immense volume encapsulates one of the great SF careers of all time.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"This may be the single-author collection of the decade, even though the decade has barely begun . . . If the term 'sense of wonder' didn't exist, it would now have to be invented to describe what Clarke's majestic narratives evoke.\" --Booklist (Starred Review)\n\n\"With his awesome inventiveness, sure grasp of scientific principle, readability, openness, and utter lack of viciousness or meanness, it's easy to understand why Clarke became the single most famous and influential non-American SF writer of the post-WWII period. If you are unacquainted with Clarke--possible, though barely--begin here at once. If you're old friends: Browse. Enjoy. Wonder.\" --Kirkus Reviews \"Arthur C. Clarke is one of the truly prophetic figures of the space age . . . the colossus of science fiction.\" --The New Yorker \"He is the prophet of the space age.\" --Times of London \"Nobody has done more in the way of enlightened prediction than Arthur C. Clarke.\" --Isaac Asimov \"Arthur C. Clarke is one of the true geniuses of our time.\" --Ray Bradbury \"One of the most astounding imaginations ever encountered in print.\" --The New York Times\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBorn in Minehead, Somerset in 1917, Arthur C. Clarke is perhaps the most celebrated science fiction author alive today. He is the author of more than sixty books with more than 50 million copies in print, and the winner of all the field's highest honors. He was named Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1986.\n\nIn 1945 he published the technical paper \"Extra-terrestrial Relays\", which in essence invented the principle of worldwide communication via geosynchronous satellite. His well-known novels include Childhood's End; Against the Fall of Knight; 2001: A Space Odyssey; Rendezvous with Rama; Imperial Earth; The Fountains of Paradise; 2010: Odyssey Two; 2061: Odyssey Three, and 3001. In 1968, he collaborated with director Stanley Kubrick on the screenplay for the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, which was derived from his story \"The Sentinel.\" He has lived in Colombo, Sri Lanka since 1956. He was awarded the CBE in 1989 and knighted in 1998."
