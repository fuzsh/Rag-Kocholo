        "text": "Sorry, but if I want to read good literature . . . rather clearly implies that most sf is not good literature, but you want to read it anyway.\n\nPart of the problem here, I suspect, is the unstated but implied proposition that \"literature\" or \"literary\" has some special meaning other than \"well-conceived and well-crafted fiction\"; it doesn't. That is a silly concept that academia has foisted off on the unsuspecting, who don't know The Emperor's New Clothes when they don't see them.\n\nThe \"well-conceived and well-crafted fiction\" sounds to me like making a chair or following the latest 10 rules for writing good fiction that everyone is fond of posting these days; I strongly disagree in the sense that books have magic or do not have magic, they come alive or not - of course the experience of such is deeply personal and strongly depends on one's background, life experiences..., so books that will have magic for me, may be a big meh for you and vice-versa and I am absolutely fine with that...\n\n\"Literary\" means something different, harder to articulate, but for me is essentially the ability to make me read and love a text irrespective of content, just by the arrangement of words - somewhat more nuanced than that but you get the idea; sf is in many ways opposite in the sense that as long as the prose is ok'ish and has enough flow, the content is king and I want the content to have sense of wonder, world building and such\n\nI see a lot of emphasis on \"characters\" in discussion of \"good fiction\", but to me what is baffling is why \"characters\" need to be human, alive or sentient; why cannot language be a \"character\", or a world, or an universe?? If you hold to the idea that \"fiction is about human experience\" (implicitly of today since it's truly hard to understand another age) than you limit yourself needlessly...\n\nAnyway enough rambling and back on topic, while nobody will accuse ACC of writing \"literary\" prose, i still hold firm that he will be remembered, read and will exert influence as long as genre-sf is around, while I strongly doubt R. Silverberg will be more than a footnote in 50 years from now\n\nThis is purely speculative, but from Silverberg's post, I get a sense that he's envious of Clarke. It is my supposition that Silverberg sees his own writing as being superior to Clarke's, in many different ways. How Clarke enjoyed such fame and recognition baffles Silverberg. (snip)\n\nAgain, this is sheer speculation on my part, but were I to bet on the situation, it sounds to me like Silverberg looks back on the course of Clarke's writing career, compares with his own and is stunned with disbelief that there would be such a comparative gap between he and Clarke, especially in Clarke's favor.\n\nAgreed.\n\nIn my current view that no writer is perfect, and every writer is better at some aspects of writing than others, I would say that both Clarke and Silverberg have limitations...that do not match up. They weren't interested in the same things (either inside or outside writing and SF) and thus did not pursue the same paths to writing success. Their strengths and weaknesses were in different parts of the spectrum; it is not surprising that Silverberg does not recognize Clarke's strengths, but easily sees his weaknesses (which, in my view, are here exaggerated.) It would be instructive to know what mainstream commercial writers Silverberg appreciates (if any)--Clarke wrote well enough to have at least one book that I know of (A Fall of Moondust) chosen to be a Readers Digest Condensed Book--and that was not an organization full of, or appreciative of, SF.\n\nAn awful lot of sf doesn't do all of that, and too much of it doesn't do any of that. Now that is equally true of all other sorts of fiction, but the difference is that (at least by and large) no one claims it's good stuff anyway just because it's got this or that genre hook in it.\n\nActually...there are bland, less-well-written mysteries that are prized as mysteries because the mystery part is well-handled. I have in fact heard both mystery and romance readers say of a writer \"Well he/she is kind of wooden, but it's got a really good (mystery setup/love story) in it.\" Agatha Christie, for instance, was not a great stylist (not to be compared to Dorothy L. Sayers) and yet--I have enjoyed many of her books. Any genre attracts readers who care about one particular part of that genre and will put up with less-than-stellar work in other areas of those books.\n\nEven more confusing, even educated and experienced readers do not agree on what \"good writing\" is, and the academic definition changes over time. I remember when the idea of giving readers \"an eye-kick\" came in as an element of good style...using very obvious stylistic surface tricks, especially extreme sensory details, to create a nearly impenetrable surface experience, below which characterization and plot moved invisibly. (Explained this way by one of its proponents at a meeting I attended years ago.) Others consider this concentration on surface effects to be self-indulgent bad writing. Some think highly emotional writing is good, the more the better on every page. Others think that's self-indulgent bad writing, and the authorial tone should be calmly authoritative. All those are opinions, expressing the personal preferences of readers...not Rules of the Universe. (Rules only if you want to attract a certain audience.)\n\nOver the course of a lifetime of reading (now reaching six decades of same) I've been able to enjoy many different kinds of writing--some of which I no longer enjoy (the kind of humor that attracted me four decades ago isn't as funny now...yeah, yeah, you can make puns about sex, big deal) but many of which still work for me. I have preferences (like every other reader) but tolerate things that don't stroke my preferences if there's another reward in the work. (Much more tolerant in mysteries than in fantasy, much less tolerant in \"literary\" writing than in fantasy.) I look at the style of writing in terms of its fitness for the particular story, as well as my preferences...and also consider the age of the story--is the style \"right\" for the time in which it was written?\n\nOne of my friends says there's not enough time in one life to waste on reading less-than-great books. I, on the other hand, believe in the old granny's saying \"You have to eat a peck of dirt before you die\" and swallow the mediocre for the pleasure I can extract.\n\nSome desultory observations . . . .\n\nActually...there are bland, less-well-written mysteries that are prized as mysteries because the mystery part is well-handled. I have in fact heard both mystery and romance readers say of a writer \"Well he/she is kind of wooden, but it's got a really good (mystery setup/love story) in it.\" Agatha Christie, for instance, was not a great stylist (not to be compared to Dorothy L. Sayers) and yet--I have enjoyed many of her books. Any genre attracts readers who care about one particular part of that genre and will put up with less-than-stellar work in other areas of those books.\n\nAh, but that's just the point: such readers will indeed, as you aptly phrased it, put up with such flaws for some counter-balancing idiosyncratic pleasure inherent in the genre--but will they say \"This is great stuff\" or will they say \"Flawed, but I like it\"? I greatly enjoy The Shadow, and have read many of the old pulp novels featuring him, but I'd never say to anyone, \"you know, these are good books.\"\n\n(Incidentally, I think that that sort of thing is much less true today in mystery fiction than it was a few decades ago. Back then, agreed, mystery novels were expressly supposed--as many of their authors said--to not be \"literary\", a point of view that I have railed against elsewhere. But I think, though I am not expert in that field, that in modern times that has changed, such that Christie, for example, is now more revered as an icon than as a writer, while Sayers and Simenon and Stout remain esteemed qua writers. My impression is that today mystery readers expect more from a book than just clever puzzles.)\n\nEven more confusing, even educated and experienced readers do not agree on what \"good writing\" is, and the academic definition changes over time.\n\nUndoubtedly so, but the academic definition is not particularly related to the commonsensical critical view, which typically expects strengths in language use, plot, characterization, and setting. And language use refers to solidly crafted prose, which is not, as was suggested elsethread, a matter of some \"10 Magic Rules of Writing\" but of adherence to the basic principles one can find expounded in, say, Herbert Read's classic English Prose Style (Read wrote the acclaimed fantasy novel The Green Child). Good prose comes in many flavors, from Lord Dunsany to Jack Vance to M. John Harrison, but it's easy enough to recognize when encountered: it can be as various as those authors' trademark styles suggest, but it is not characterized by fanciness or tricks, just sound writerly talent.\n\nAs to the other elements, I won't repeat what I have said at great length at another elsewhere, but I reckon that most readers want characters who seem three-dimensionally human, not mere animated plot devices or (as is often said of Asimov's) walking, talking ideas.\n\nOne of my friends says there's not enough time in one life to waste on reading less-than-great books. I, on the other hand, believe in the old granny's saying \"You have to eat a peck of dirt before you die\" and swallow the mediocre for the pleasure I can extract.\n\nI think, if we're going for apothegms, that \"you have to kiss a lot of frogs to find a prince\" might be closer; but, on the other hand, a kissed frog that remains steadfastly batrachian need not be further romanced. I find it remarkable how little of a work one needs to taste to get the flavor; often a few paragraphs here and there will suffice. There are occasional exceptions, in both directions, but usually by just a few pages in I have a pretty good idea if the book in hand will be rewarding or no.\n\n(When I was young and idealistic--not to bring the Civil War into this--I firmly believed that a glass of beer or a book, once begun, had to be finished; but it's been a long year since I first put down a book and said \"Not another page.\" Beer, on the other hand . . . .)\n\nTalk about flame bait! No where in this article does Silverberg even come close to calling Clarke a hack. Me thinks a small fur-footed poster is looking to (and successfully did) stir up a controversy!\n\nSilverberg said:\n\nSo I decided, for this series of essays on rereading my early SF favorites, to see what it was that I had found so marvelous in Clarke’s first novel when I encountered it more than sixty years ago.\n\nOk, so context is important. This article is part of series of articles wherein Silverberg discusses sci-fi childhood favorites. It isn't here because he's going out of his way to slam Clarke. He's discussing this particular early works of Clarke because they were childhood favorites.\n\nBut the earlier sense of amateur derives from the Latin word amator, a lover—specifically, a lover of literature, of fine wine, of rare postage stamps, of anything that can excite strong commitment, be it intellectual or emotional or both. We no longer use the word that way in English because, since it has come to take on negative connotations in its other sense, it has been replaced by its Spanish synonym, aficionado. But those of us who love science fiction are amateurs of science fiction, and I think there was no greater amateur of SF than Arthur C. Clarke, who when he was eighteen or so set out to show his love for the work of Olaf Stapledon and other SF visionaries by writing his own tale of the far future. And it is that love that shines through in Against the Fall of Night and most of Clarke’s later work and makes it compelling to us despite all its literary shortcomings.\n\nThis is hardly an all out attack on Clarke.\n\nSilverberg's thinks that Clarke is a poor technical writer with some really nifty ideas and that Clarke's love for science comes through clearly in his books. Basically every post here has agreed with him. And yet some people seem to think that he wrote this piece out of envy. Sigh."
