hello

this little question to see, to list or have a glance about the uses of openbsd, outside of servers/developpers...

I was wondering, with a friend, who, which system, uses openbsd, and is not a server system nor a developper computer..

we see lot of that of linux (digital signage, point of sales machines), freebsd runs netflix, and I was wondering, what about openbsd?

even for end users?

CiotBSD

in a way I tried, on 6-8 yrs laptops, where youtube/mails/internet/etc (even gimp/blnder) works well under linux/debian/mint, but running openbsd you unfortunately loose immediately a large scale of performance/fastness of computer, it's a huge slow... really üôÅ

I know several users (including me) whom appreciate the way of working of openbsd, but can't run 20-30 firefox tabs at all, while under LMDE it's still going well üôÅ

It can be said, including the derivatives of OpenBSD, that is runs the majority of networking appliances that aren't Enterprise level. As well, Apple has admitted to using OpenBSD software as the basis for it's firewall.

You'll find on your Mac terminal almost all the OpenBSD commands, including "fancy" ones, will be recognized, but not execute to completion of course.
