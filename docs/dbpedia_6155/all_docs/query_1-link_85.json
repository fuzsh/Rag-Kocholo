        "text": "Technically you're right: install X11, download app, go!\n\nBUT: Well, \"go\" means installing the app, which quite often could mean compiling it from the source. And moreover, where do you find your apps? Which ones do you want? etc.\n\nOne very useful management system that keeps track of what you have installed and what is available is Fink. Fink makes a directory dedicated to unix applications, nicely organised etc. However, it is not graphical, so you need to use the terminal. A nice graphical front end to Fink is FinkCommander, which shown the list of installed/available applications, sorted by name, size, type, etc. with all the version numbers, description etc. buttons, menu's etc. Very good for a beginner.\n\nSo now you have all those unix apps installed through fink, and how do you use them? Well, you launch X11, type in the name of the app in the X11 Terminal and the app launches.\n\nHowever, a very nice way of managing, launching, configuring your X11 environment and unix applications is through a desktop environment, like Gnome or KDE. These provide an environment with a desktop, icons, menu-bars, control centres etc. With these you can launch, control your unix apps in an intuitive and graphical point-'n-click way, just like you were used to with OS X.\n\nAnother plus is customisation, you can use various different file mangers, browsers etc. but also window managers and alternative workspaces.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nOK, I'll try, but probably others (Racer X for instance) know this better than me:\n\nMac OS X is based on several things: the Mach microkernel, Darwin-OpenBSD and of course the NeXT heritage. Read this if you want to know more. Forget the specifics, but this is what \"Unix Underneath\" refers to. This is the \"machine room\" of OS X.\n\nWhen you log in as >console you can see how this looks like: mostly black. If you want pretty windows etc. you need a Window Management System: this draws windows, with buttons, edges, etc. Then you might like a Desktop Environment: the desktop itself, icons, menubars etc.\n\nNow, of course we have all these, but inside OS X these are specifically tuned to run Mac applications, so they are not suited to run unix apps. To run unix apps as unix apps, hence without porting them, they need their own X11 window system.\n\nOk, so now you can run unix apps alongside your mac apps: great. If you want to increase the functionality and ease of use (and avoid the terminal) you can enhance your X11-unix experience by using a different window manager and desktop environment. Practically you are now running two OS'es in parallel.\n\nOnward to Fink. Fink is a package manager: it tracks which packages (apps) are available for Apple's Darwin+X11, which ones you have installed, whether updates are available, a description etc. But it's not graphical. FinkCommander adds a nice window and graphical controls (buttons, menu's). They are both OS X apps, not unix apps. They help you install unix apps.\n\nWhy doesn't apple include them by default? Well, many people don't need/want it, I think. Moreover, they are freely downloadable and both Fink and FinkCommander aren't that big ...\n\nSo summarising this gargantuan post: FinkCommander is the frontend for Fink.\n\nX11 is the windowing system, necessary for graphical unix apps like the Gimp and FreeCiv.\n\nYou can consider window-managers as custom skins for your X11 windows.\n\nGnome and KDE are optional enhancements of X11 by providing menubars and desktops (and games and utilities)\n\nSo the hierarchy goes like this:\n\nMach/OpenBSD-Darwin (core OS)\n\nMac layer (Carbon, Cocoa)\n\nGraphic engines (OpenGL, Quartz)\n\nAqua interface\n\nand on the other side\n\nMach/OpenBSD-Darwin\n\nGraphic X11 Window System\n\nInterface elements (WindowManager, Gnome)"
