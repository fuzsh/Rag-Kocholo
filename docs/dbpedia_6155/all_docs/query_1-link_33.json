        "text": "I've been using ufraw with gimp under OpenBSD and Linux for maybe 3 years, since I've had a camera that would shoot raws. I just got a 64 bit Debian running on a Raspberry Pi and I wanted one of the newer Gimp versions that will let you set precision of your images, so I built 2.10. Only the newer gimps don't recognize ufraw. So I looked at nufraw and it won't recognize my gimp. There's some strange politics going on here.\n\nSo the original ufraw has been abanonded just when gimp might finally handle a 16 bit input? I would imagine passing data fom ufraw to gimp might need an overhaul to accomodate wider data but it's something I've been looking forward to for years."
