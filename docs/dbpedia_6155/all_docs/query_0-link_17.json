The guide below is still valid if you want to try out this alternative open source operating system.\n\nEdit (April 25th, 2019): Yesterday OpenBSD 6.5 has been released with lots of useful improvements (changelog). I went through my tutorial to see if this guide needed some polishing. It seems everything I wrote is still relevant; the installation process of OpenBSD 6.5 works just fine with this guide. Have fun!\n\nTheo de Raadt and the other developers behind OpenBSD unveiled (pun intended) version 6.4 a few days ago (October 18th, 2018). It’s the 45th release and — like any other release before that — it’s stable, secure and fast.\n\nOpenBSD is perfect for older computers. If you have hardware that is too slow (or too sacred) to be operated with Windows or MacOS, you could resurrect it by installing OpenBSD or a lightweight Linux distribution."
