        "text": "GIMP for Unix-like systems\n\nIf available, the official package from your Unix-like distribution is the recommended method of installing GIMP!\n\nThe flatpak build is new and has known limitations, though it will likely provide faster updates, following GIMP releases closely.\n\nTherefore choose your installation medium according to your needs.\n\nInstall GIMP flatpak\n\nFlatpak build available in: i386, x86-64, ARM and AArch64.\n\nFlatpak additional instructions\n\nThe flatpak link above should open your software installer and prompt you to install GIMP. Yet it may not work out-of-the-box on some platforms since the flatpak technology is new. If that is the case, ensure flatpak is installed and if clicking the link still does not prompt to install GIMP, then manually install by command line:\n\nflatpak install https://flathub.org/repo/appstream/org.gimp.GIMP.flatpakref\n\nOnce installed, it will be made available exactly the same way as other applications (menus, desktop overview, or any specific application launch process used by your desktop).\n\nIf this is not the case, we suggest to report a bug to your desktop or distribution asking for proper support of flatpak. In the meantime, you can still run it by command line (not as the recommended method, only a workaround):\n\nflatpak run org.gimp.GIMP//stable\n\nThis installation will also provide regular update. You don't have to come back on this page and install again (it will not work!) when a new version of GIMP is released. Instead if your distribution and/or desktop has a good support for flatpak, it should propose to perform updates.\n\nOnce again, if your distribution does not have proper support, you can always fall back to using the following command line:\n\nflatpak update\n\nSystems without flatpak support\n\nGIMP can also run on Solaris and is available for the BSD family of systems such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD.\n\nPlease refer to the documentation for your Unix-like system on the installation of software.\n\nGIMP for macOS\n\nThere is no macOS package yet, sorry. Please check back later.\n\nOlder Downloads\n\nPrevious installers for OSX can be found here: download.gimp.org.\n\nMacports\n\nAn easy way to compile and install GIMP and other great Free software on your Mac is by using Macports. The installer allows you to choose from a large directory of packages. To install gimp using Macports, you simply do sudo port install gimp once you have Macports installed.\n\nLast we checked, the GIMP port file pointed to the current stable release and we have reports from people who've built GIMP successfully this way.\n\nDownload Macports\n\nHomebrew\n\nHomebrew is similar to Macports and provides packages (aka formulas) to install, either by compiling them from source or by using pre-made binaries. There are indications that there is now a formula for GIMP, installable with: brew tap homebrew/cask && brew cask install gimp.\n\nDownload Homebrew\n\nNOTE! Please be aware that it was announced recently that Homebrew is using analytics. To turn this off in homebrew then run: brew analytics off\n\nYou can read more about this on Brew Analytics.\n\nFink\n\nFink is a package repository that offer mostly precompiled binaries. It provides the apt-get command known to e.g. Debian and Ubuntu users, and installing GIMP is as easy as sudo apt-get install gimp once you have installed the Fink installer.\n\nIf there's no binary package, then fink install gimp will compile GIMP from source.\n\nDisclaimer: we haven't been able to determine if it is possible to install or build recent GIMP from Fink. Last we checked, GIMP 2.6.12 appears to be the most recent GIMP package that is offered there.\n\nDownload Fink\n\nGIMP for Windows\n\nDownload GIMP 2.10.38\n\nvia BitTorrent Download GIMP 2.10.38\n\ndirectly\n\nThe download links above will attempt to download GIMP from one of our trusted mirror servers. If the mirrors do not work or you would rather download directly from our server, you can get the direct download here.\n\nSupported OS: Windows 10 or over\n\nThese links download the official GIMP installer for Windows (~200 MB). The installer contains both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of GIMP, and will automatically use the appropriate one.\n\nBitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing system. It works by downloading GIMP from a distributed network of BitTorrent users, and may improve download speed dramatically. Choosing this option will download the torrent file for the GIMP installer. You may need to install a torrent client to make use of this file.
