        "text": "OpenBSD for everything … almost.\n\nThe beauty of using Open Source software is that you change operating systems and still have the same applications that will work with the same files. For example: I have Libre Office installed on MacOS, Windows and OpenBSD. I also have NextCloud installed on the same devices. I can edit a document using my Mac, save it to NextCloud and know that it will be synced to both Windows and OpenBSD. I can then carry on working on the document on what ever hardware I have to hand.\n\nI use my OpenBSD desktop for almost everything these days if I’m sat down at my desk. The XFCE desktop has everything I need including a screenshot app. The problem being I usually need to crop the screenshot. The GIMP is overkill for that. It takes an age to open and then I have absolutely no idea how to use the GIMP to crop an image. I managed it once but never again.\n\ngThumb is packaged for OpenBSD:\n\npkg_add gthumb\n\nAnd it works a treat. Crop works as you would expect - well, as I expect. And screenshots can be sent straight from the Screenshot app to gThumb.\n\nMy old method of working involved taking a screenshot, saving it to NextCloud, opening it on my Mac, cropping with Affinity Photo, saving back to NextCloud and then using it on my OpenBSD box. gThumb saves a huge amount of time and relegates my Mac a little more. The end game is that my Mac will only be Logic Pro but there is a way to go before that. Affinity Photo, Designer and Publisher are still in the MacOS mix, as is the 10GB of photos stored on iCloud. Cleaning up the duplicates will take time and eventually they will be in NextCloud.\n\nHMRC’s Basic PAYE Tools only run on Windows, MacOS and Linux. Might have to keep the Mac for that or use the token Windows laptop I have.\n\nShotwell is also very good. Pinta is a little more involved and can do rounded corners although I prefer to let CSS handle that."
