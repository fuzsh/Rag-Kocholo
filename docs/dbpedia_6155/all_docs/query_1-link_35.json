I use it as my private OS and i'm very happy with it. The only thing i really miss is something like Virtualbox (with usable performance) to set up some linux dev boxes.\n\nYou take a hit on performance by using OpenBSD, not terrible though.\n\n(25-08-2015, 06:13 AM)bsdkeith Wrote: I'm a fairly recent convert to OpenBSD also, (systemd made me look elsewhere in case it takes over Linux).\n\nI also use FreeBSD on machines that are not supported fully under OpenBSD, & have used GhostBSD.\n\nWhat I particularly like is how small a basic installation is under OpenBSD, less than 1GB for Fluxbox with Firefox & Xmms.

Also CWM is a neat window manager.\n\n(17-07-2016, 07:12 PM)z3bra Wrote: [...] our world need both!\n\nMaybe it is a paradox, but I feel that ^^this^^ is the way to get along with standards.\n\nThat is also why I really like projects built in portable C, or ported from BSDs to Linux (with libbsd?, or in the other direction, but I am running Linux right now).\n\nGhostBSD may be my entrance door to BSD, as Ubuntu was for Linux: I was needing to see how a system can work while fully configured before to start setting up a new one on its own. But I have seen nixers starting with slackware as a first distro!"
