Many of the missing pieces are getting together, even though it is still a work in progress. As usual, issues are expected and in particular in this release which got important updates in major areas, such as canvas interaction code, scripts, but also theming…\n\n[...]\n\nWe still can’t give you any date for GIMP 3.0, but we are getting there!\n\nRead on\n\nUPDATE\n\nOne more now, there will be press coverage in the coming week...\n\nLibre Arts - GIMP 2.99.12: CMYK, canvas interaction, and more\n\nThis new development version of GIMP is a bit of a game-changer as it arrives with some long-anticipated CMYK-related features. The way they are implemented will make some users happy, but some users might feel annoyed. It’s got to do with early binding vs late binding. So let’s talk about it.\n\nThis morning from Arindam Giri."
