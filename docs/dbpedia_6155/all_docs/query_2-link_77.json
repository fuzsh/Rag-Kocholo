        "text": "In my OpenBSD installation guide I mentioned many reasons to try out this unique operating system. I should update the tutorial, but the process outlined in the article is still applicable and results in a working copy of OpenBSD on your desktop computer or laptop.\n\nOn May 19, 2020, OpenBSD 6.7 was released with several interesting fixes, upgrades, and security improvements. We‚Äôll look at the most important ones and maybe you‚Äôll just try it out while you‚Äôre still mostly stuck in your cave, working from home, unsure what to do with yourself üòè\n\nAlthough OpenBSD has never been an operating system for beginners, it‚Äôs slowly becoming more user-friendly. Recently, out-of-the-box WiFi support for many cards has been added, the Kernel update/upgrade process has been refined, and adding software works without adding repository mirrors manually now.\n\nAll in all, OpenBSD has come a long way in the last few years, of course still being totally neglected by mainstream open-source reporting. OpenBSD may have been underrated for a reason in the past, but today it‚Äôs really not that different from any of the popular Linux distributions available."
