        "text": "Downloading Gutenprint\n\nPlease download Gutenprint from our project page.\n\nMacintosh Users\n\nMacintosh OS X users should download files whose names end in \".dmg\". These are pre-built packages that can be installed by opening the file and following instructions. You can find information and download links for the latest release at https://gimp-print.sourceforge.io/MacOSX.php\n\nUsers of printers connected via USB (either directly or with USB-parallel converters) may want to download \"usbtb-1.0.17.uni.dmg\". This is an alternative USB driver that may provide better performance and functionality with certain printers and systems. If you are unable to print to a directly connected printer, or printing stops partway, this driver may solve your problem. It may also help if your printer is printing extremely slowly, but there are many reasons why printers may be slow and this will not resolve all of them. This is also a universal binary.\n\nUsers of Macintosh OS 10.2 (\"Jaguar\") who wish to print from legacy applications that generate PostScript should install \"espgs-7.07.1.ppc.dmg\". This is a PPC-only binary. You do not need to download the source package \"espgs-7.07.1-source.tar.bz2\".\n\nAll Other Users\n\nUsers of other operating systems, such as Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, HP-UX, etc. should download the main package, named \"gutenprint-5.0.0.tar.bz2\". This is a \"source tarball\"; it contains the source code for the package and must be compiled to produce binary executables. The command to unpack this file is\n\ntar xjvf gutenprint-5.0.0.tar.bz2\n\nOn some systems, you may have to issue the following command:\n\nbunzip2 -c gutenprint-5.0.0.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -\n\nThis will create a subdirectory named gutenprint-5.0.0. You should read the files named README and NEWS in that subdirectory for further instructions.\n\nGit access\n\nIf you want to use the current development, you can clone the repository:\n\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/gimp-print/source gimp-print-source"
