It's not an officially supported platform, but one of the Cincom guys was telling me that it should be able to run under a linux compatibility mode. How did you set it up?\n\nI already have Squeak running without a problem, so I'm not looking for an alternative. I specifically need to run VisualWorks's Web Velocity for a project.\n\nThanks,\n\nif you're wondering about setting up linux compatibility mode and you're running the GENERIC kernel:\n\n# sysctl kern.emul.linux=1\n\nto enable at boot uncomment the kern.emul.linux=1 line in /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nanswered Sep 17, 2008 at 12:01\n\nInetpubInetpub\n\nSee the OpenBSD FAQ, specifically section 9.4 - Running Linux Binaries on OpenBSD.\n\nTypically there are more steps needed then just kern.emul.linux=1 unless you have statically linked (i.e. completely stand-alone) binaries. The good news is that packages exist that contain Linux libs, and they are easy to install. This is all detailed in the above link.\n\nanswered Jun 6, 2009 at 15:44\n\ndwcdwc\n\n24.7k77 gold badges4545 silver badges5555 bronze badges"
