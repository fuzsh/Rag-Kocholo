        "text": "Gilbert Sanford\n\nPost by Chris Cappuccio\n\nPost by Gilbert Sanford\n\nThough the following has nothing to do with AMD GPU's, it may be of interest.\n\nI will share my config with you with one caveat: I'm from Alabama, and we all\n\nknow what that means ... http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=139656417532670&w=2\n\nIf you're lucky someone will have Nouveau ported before too long.\n\nI've noticed that Nvidia laptops tend to get really damn hot. I stick\n\nwith integrated video because it is always cooler than a discrete video\n\nchip.\n\nI wonder, why not just buy something with integrated, supported Intel or ATI\n\nvideo to begin with? (And that's exactly what this guy wants, as well.)\n\n--\n\n\"If you see fraud and don't shout fraud, you are a fraud\" -- Nassim Taleb\n\nChris, you're absolutely right. I now know more than I did a year ago, and my\n\nnext purchase, when this one dies, will be a box with integrated Intel only.\n\nIntel with integrated video is the only way to fly for those of us who just live\n\nin a tmux'ed xterm with Firefox or Chrome on the side (genuine, one-man,\n\nin-house web devel from Alabama -- man, that's funny!! You guys think OpenSSL\n\nis horrifying . . . pray that you never have to look at the 9500 lines I wrote\n\nfor our multiple warehouse inventory system for the Parts Department, hahaha :)\n\nit's worked for over 2 years!) Occasionally, I break out the GIMP, but, again,\n\nintegrated Intel is more than up to the task. No doubt, I got lucky with what\n\nI'm doing, to the point that Nouveau isn't necessary, nor do I care to run\n\nanything else to get it. (I keep \"Winders\" and Linuxmint on the box to ensure\n\nI can handle whatever comes my way in the business world.)\n\nYou may have noticed \"acpitz0 at acpi0: critical temperature is 107 degC\" in my\n\ndmesg . . . it always says that, and that's probably where it was before I\n\ndisabled processor cores. I don't think the GPU is doing anything, but the\n\nprocessor was definitely cooking. My unit is very comfortable now, and\n\nOpenBSD simply flies. This is a very fast box compared to what I've had in\n\nthe past. Perhaps the poster from Poland can acquire the right kind\n\nof hardware.\n\nSorry I top-posted earlier. All you guys are great!! Pure genius hard at work.\n\nGilbert"
