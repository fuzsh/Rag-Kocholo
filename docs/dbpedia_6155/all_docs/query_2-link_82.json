If the examples on the webpage are representative, then this is the most astonishingly good image regularization filter that I have ever seen. It is based on a non-linear diffusion technique. It can be used for noise and artifact removal, resizing, and inpainting (which means filling in missing image regions). It works on color photographs and cartoons. (Added Feb 2, 2006).\n\nHere are some web articles, listings, blogs, and books that cover Potrace and its applications.\n\nTrying Potrace [English] by Exocert.com.\n\nPotrace, rad image vectorizer by Will Benton.\n\nConverting images from bitmap to vector format [English] by Mike Vargas.\n\nCompiling bitmaps to SVG and PDR using Potrace by Sarusekkei [English].\n\nHow to create your own font [English] by B.
