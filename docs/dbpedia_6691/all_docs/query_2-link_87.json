        "text": "Post by petrolino on\n\nErnest Borgnine always referred back to Spencer Tracy as an example of the way to conduct yourself as an actor. Charles Durning said when receiving a golden star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame it meant the world to him as he was now on a pavement with his hero James Cagney. Cagney and Tracy went toe to toe and then some.\n\nPost by Penn Guinn on\n\nJames Cagney with Spencer Tracy and director William K. Howard on the set of \"The Power and the Glory\", 1933.\n\nThe tragic life story of a power-hungry industrialist (Tracy) is recounted in the aftermath of his death.\n\nCagney is not in this film.\n\nPost by Penn Guinn on\n\nWere they both practicing Catholics back in the day?\n\nPracticing Catholics irl ?\n\nNo idea ... but they played Catholics in a lot of films .... sometimes as Priest and sometimes as church going gangster.\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nWere they both practicing Catholics back in the day?\n\nPracticing Catholics irl ?\n\nNo idea ... but they played Catholics in a lot of films .... sometimes as Priest and sometimes as church going gangster.\n\nWell, they both seem like they could be Irish Catholics to me. What do you think ?\n\nPost by Penn Guinn on\n\nPracticing Catholics irl ?\n\nNo idea ... but they played Catholics in a lot of films .... sometimes as Priest and sometimes as church going gangster.\n\nWell, they both seem like Irish Catholics to me.\n\nThey both are at least partly Irish and Catholic ... it's the practicing part am not sure of !\n\nCagney was of Irish and Norwegian descent.\n\nTracy attended a Catholic University and from his biog on IMDb :\n\nTracy's strong Roman Catholic beliefs precluded his divorcing wife Louise, though they mostly lived apart.\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nWell, they both seem like Irish Catholics to me.\n\nThey both are at least partly Irish and Catholic ... it's the practicing part am not sure of !\n\nCagney was of Irish and Norwegian descent.\n\nTracy attended a Catholic University and from his biog on IMDb :\n\nTracy's strong Roman Catholic beliefs precluded his divorcing wife Louise, though they mostly lived apart.\n\nI'm sorry. Didn't mean to suggest or insinuate anything upon religious lines. I'm just a fan of these actors. I'm sorry if any hurt was caused, if it was that's my stupidity and ignorance when it comes to James Cagney and Spencer Tracuy.\n\nPost by Penn Guinn on\n\nToo bad JC and ST didn't work for the same studio ... might have been fun to see them together, eh ?\n\nFunny thing happened as I was typing earlier ....\n\nCagney and Tracy appeared together in\n\nmade me think of TV's Cagney and Lacey !\n\nTracy, Cagney, O'Brien and McHugh were known as the \"Irish Mafia\" back in the day.\n\npetrolino fwiw ... I saw no suggestion or insulation in the religion question.\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nWell, they both seem like they could be Irish Catholics to me. What do you think ?\n\nI don't know about Cagney, but the fact that Spencer Tracy never divorced his wife despite his long term, live-in relationship with Katherine Hepburn, means that he was a practicing Catholic.\n\nThanks. I didn't mean to open a can of worms. They just both remind me of people I know, growing up.\n\nPost by Penn Guinn on\n\nA Cagney / Tracy connection\n\nTribute to a Bad Man (1956)\n\nProduction began with Spencer Tracy as the star of the film, but he clashed with director Robert Wise and was extremely temperamental causing several delays in filming. When Tracy claimed that the high altitude of the mountain set was making him ill and insisted that the set be moved to a lower location, he was finally dismissed from the film by MGM and replaced by James Cagney.\n\nFinal western of James Cagney.\n\nPost by petrolino on\n\nThanks. I didn't mean to open a can of worms. They just both remind me of people I know, growing up.\n\nCan of worms? I don't see any can of worms around here. The great thing about Cagney and Tracy is that they both had/have that universal appeal of reminding us of people we know. That's why they were loved by so many and became enduring stars.\n\nI was worried I might get cancelled for speculating these men might be recognised Catholics. Truth is, I have no idea, having known neither man in person. Just a movie fan.\n\nPost by Penn Guinn on\n\nI watched Tracy in Bad Day at Black Rock last month and that guy could say MORE when not saying anything than most speech making swearing mumbling acting stars that came after his era !\n\nTwo from IMDb\n\nErnest Borgnine always referred to Spencer Tracy as \"Mr. Tracy,\" never by his first name. \"I was in awe of him,\" he said. \"To me, he was the world's greatest actor, and my God, here I am working with the man.\"\n\nThe suit that Spencer Tracy wears throughout the film, he bought himself off-the-rack at a second-hand store.\n\nPost by phantomparticle on\n\nI don't know if Tracy was a practicing Catholic, but he apparently kept some of his Catholic beliefs (never divorcing his wife even when living with Hepburn). He was also a periodic alcoholic, which some say stemmed from a sense of guilt over the birth of his deaf son.\n\nPost by marshamae on\n\nThey both are at least partly Irish and Catholic ... it's the practicing part am not sure of !\n\nCagney was of Irish and Norwegian descent.\n\nTracy attended a Catholic University and from his biog on IMDb :\n\nI'm sorry.

I'm sorry if any hurt was caused, if it was that's my stupidity and ignorance when it comes to James Cagney and Spencer Tracuy.\n\nI am sure no one was hurt or offended\n\nPost by kijii on\n\nA Cagney / Tracy connection\n\nTribute to a Bad Man (1956)\n\nProduction began with Spencer Tracy as the star of the film, but he clashed with director Robert Wise and was extremely temperamental causing several delays in filming.

My mom was hoping to see Tracy, but Cagney finally did the film."
