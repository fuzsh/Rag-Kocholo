After Dorothy tells him she could never love a quitter, he returns to the ship, where he is court-martialed for being away without leave. The other sailors ostracize Chesty because of his attitude toward the Navy. When Dorothy defends Biff's actions, Chesty breaks up with her. Despite his dislike of the Navy, Chesty risks his life to put out a fire in the gunroom and receives a medal, which he does not take seriously. Finally the Navy transfers him to the dirigible field ashore. The dirigible is sent to San Pedro for Navy Day. While helping to land the air craft, Biff gets tangled in the ropes and is towed aloft. Chesty asks permission to rescue him, and when it is denied, he climbs down the rope anyway, parachuting to safety with Biff. Chesty and Dorothy are reconciled, and Biff gives the bride away when they marry. Chesty has the last laugh when he is promoted over Biff.\n\nLess"
