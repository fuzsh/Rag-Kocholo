To quote from a movie list: \"Inspired by Wells, this is one of the first real science fiction films to be made in England. The story concerns an attack on London by a fleet of airships from an unknown country. Through the extensive use of models, buildings were wrecked, prototype tanks destroyed, and railroads blown up.

(UA, 1965)\n\nThe Beatles -- from Beethoven to Blimp.\n\nDirector: Richard Lester.\n\nHere Comes The Navy (WB, 1934)\n\nA Cagney comedy with the perpetual misfit bouncing from the ARIZONA to the real MACON. As far as I can tell the cast and crew actually went to Sunnyvale and filmed a typical MACON undocking and launch operation. There is a very good closeup of the stern beam and bridle. Since this was fine grain 35mm the quality is much better than we usually get. And it's unique to that picture, even though some stock Navy film is also used.\n\nHidden Valley (Monogram Pictures, 1932)\n\nBob Steele and Gertrude Messinger -- and the Goodyear blimp: Volunteer! The typical B-western story involves a cowboy and a gang of crooks searching for a secret treasure. The hero is injured and the plot is resolved when (of all unlikely things) the blimp and the protagonist's allies come to the rescue.\n\nThe Hindenburg (Universal, 1975)\n\nBased on the stabotage theory.

Go figure.\n\nDirector: Robert Stevenson.\n\nKiki's Delivery Service (1989)\n\nMajo no Takkyubin\n\nA dirigible plays a big part.\n\nDirector, Screenplay, Production: Hayao Miyazaki\n\nKing of the Texas Rangers (Republic, 1941)\n\nThis serial features a ZR3-like airship that takes a bad-guy's hook-on plane in the first and last chapters. Forgettable other than it is one of the few times Hollywood featured the hook-ons.\n\nLaputa: The Castle in the Sky (US: Buena Vista, 1986)\n\nTenku no shiro Rapyuta\n\n\"In an imaginary kingdom where new technology mixes with old and giant airships ply the skies, a young boy, an evil mastermind, a forgotten princess, a band of sky pirates, and a legion of doomsday robots battle to discover or protect the secrets of the legendary floating city called Laputa.\" Animated.\n\nThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (US: 20th Century Fox, 2003)\n\nEnglish-uniformed raiders devastate a German Zeppelin works, the flaming skeletons collapsing in Hindenburg-style devastation.\n\nStars: Sean Connery.\n\nDirector:Stephen Norrington.\n\nLost Zeppelin (Tiffany, 1930)\n\nNaval airship crashes in Antarctica\n\nMadam Satan (MGM, 1930)\n\nStrange musical aboard a passenger ship.\n\nStars: Kay Johnson, Reginald Denny, Lillian Roth.\n\nDirector: Cecil B. DeMille.\n\nMaster of the World (Disney, 1961)\n\nBased on the Jules Verne novel.\n\nStars: Vincent Price aboard a fantastic airship.\n\nDirector: William Witney.\n\nMummy Returns (Universal, 2001)\n\nStarnge airship allows the fearless crew to escape supernatural sandstorms.\n\nStars: Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo.\n\nDirector: Stephen Sommers.\n\nMurder in the Air (WB, 1940)\n\nInvolves a US airship named the USN Mason (not a typo). Surprisingly enough, the Mason -- which is testing the super secret Inertia Projector -- crashes off the coast of California. It all appears to be shot using studios mock ups and props. I don't remember seeing any prototype footage in the movie. This film is the source of the crash scenes in the 1946 history of the rigids.\n\nStars: Ronald Reagan as 'Brass' Bancroft\n\nDirector: Lewis Seiler.\n\nThe Quest (Universal , 1996)\n\nStars Jean Claude Van Dam as an American fighter in the 1920s who gets entered into a global martial arts tournament in the Far East. Roger Moore plays an English con man. At the height of the tournament, he and his assistant try to make off in the night with the heavy grand prize by sailing away in a hovering vintage white blimp. The blimp is real and is in many shots, though Moore and companion are caught when the blimp is shot and deflated.\n\nThe Red Tent (Paramount, 1969)\n\nRecreation of Nobile's doomed arctic voyage\n\nStars: Sean Connery, Claudia Cardinale, Peter Finch.\n\nDirector: Mikhail Kalatozov.\n\nThe Rocketeer (Disney, 1991)\n\nBased on Dave Stevens' graphic novel character Cliff Secord -- a hot pilot who stumbles across a one-man rocket pack. Explosive climax on the LZ130 \"Luxemburg\" with remarkable effects from ILM. This is a highly underrated film.\n\nStars: Bill Campbell, Jennifer Connely, Timothy Dalton.\n\nDirector: Joe Johnston.\n\nS1 (Nordisk [a Danish company], 1913-Silent)\n\nSet in Germany, it features a generals daughter, played by Asta Nielsen, who gets a ride in a zeppelin, namely LZ10 Schwaben. The film used the airship extensivly --- in the hanger, on the ground, and in the air with vistas mainly of the Ruhr. Apparantly, Nielsen used the ship for a leaflet drop advertising a new cinema.\n\nScarface (Universal, 1983)\n\nGoodyear blimp makes an appearance over Miami's night sky.\n\nStars: Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeifer.\n\nDirector: Brian DePalma.\n\nSky Captain & The World of Tomorrow (Paramount, 2004)\n\nLooks like it took its inspiration from Fleicher's classic Superman cartoons. In fact, it looks like a comic. Laden with state-of-the-art deco visuals -- including the usual exploding dirigibles.\n\nStars: Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nDirector: Kerry Conrtan.\n\nA Star is Born (First Artists, 1976)\n\nStreisand vehicle with the blimp's shadow passing over a stadium.\n\nSteamboy (Triumph Films [Sony], 2005)\n\nAnimated.

Robinson, Nigel Bruce, Ralph Richardson.\n\nDirector: Marion Gering.\n\nA Ticklish Affair (1963)\n\nFinale features a rescue from an aerial ladder into a U.S. Navy blimp gondola\n\nStars: Gig Young, Red Buttons.\n\nDirector: George Sidney.\n\nTwo Minute Warning (Universal, 1976)\n\nFootball and blimp as a sniper spotter.\n\nStars: Charlton Heston, John Cassevetes, Martin Balsam.\n\nUp! (Disney/Pixar, 2009)\n\nA house, lifted by balloons, sails the sky and a Hindenburg-size dirigible grace this wonderful film.\n\nDirectors: Pete Docter, Bob Peterson.\n\nView to a Kill (UA, 1985)\n\nBond is shaken, not stirred, atop the Golden Gate Bridge via blimp.\n\nStars: Roger Moore, Christopher Walken, Grace Jones.\n\nDirector: John Glen.\n\nWaterworld (Universal, 1995)\n\nPostapocalytic airship in search of land.\n\nStars: Kevin Costner, Dennis Hooper, and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nDirector: Kevin Reynolds.\n\nWhite Diamond (Marco Polo Film AG, 2004)\n\nDocumentary released as a feature film.
