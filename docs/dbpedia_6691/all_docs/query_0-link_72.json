        "text": "Love is in the air this time, and what better way to make your heart beat faster than in the company of threeclassic romantic comedies.\n\nFirst up, Carole Landis and John Hubbard are switching places, literally, in 1940 body-swap comedy Turnabout. James Cagney is romancing Gloria Stuart on the high seas in 1934's Here Comes The Navy. And Charles Boyer and Margaret Sullavan have the most unorthodox marriage you can imagine in 1941's Appointment For Love.\n\nWe've got music from Cagney himself, as well as dreamy tunes from Doris Day and Jo Stafford. We're playing another round of Who The Hell Is That Hollywood Legend?\n\nAnd radio entertainment this week comes courtesy of Charles Boyer and Myrna Loy!\n\nTo sign up as a co-producer/patron of the shows CLICK HERE or go to www.patreon.com/attaboysecret\n\nCredits\n\nThis week, hear all about the wonderful thing that \"SCIENCE\" discovered lately...\n\nThere's some classic MUSIC from Johnny Mercer, Bing Crosby and Bea Wain...\n\n'Who The Hell Is That Hollywood Legend?' RETURNS with a new mystery to solve...\n\nFind out who's won the VAL LEWTON competition...\n\nPlus reviews of two movie favourites, the James Cagney & Pat O'Brien comic drama 'Ceiling Zero', and the scintillating 'The Farmer's Daughter' starring Loretta Young and Joseph Cotten.\n\nTo become a patron of the shows, click here\n\nTo find out more about 'The Dark Pages' click here\n\nCredits\n\nIn this week's episode...\n\nLEARN how to make food taste better, with the judicious application of wine...\n\nGRIMACE as we discover if it's possible to improve some classic movie lines with the use of sound effects...\n\nCELEBRATE the birthdays of Adam and his all-time favourite movie star, this week's guest of honour: the one and only Mr James Cagney.\n\nThis week's reviews are of three of Mr Cagney's classics, including 1933's 'Lady Killer', 1936's 'Great Guy', and 1941's 'The Strawberry Blonde'.\n\nRadio entertainment comes this week in the form of a very suspenseful outing for Cagney, as he pays a visit to radio's outstanding theatre of thrills, plus we'll take a trip back to 1981, when Cagney and his best friend, Pat O'Brien, journeyed to England, and recounted the story of how they met.\n\nALSO: Some thank yous!
