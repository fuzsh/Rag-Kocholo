The film stars James Cagney, Pat O'Brien, Gloria Stuart and Frank McHugh.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nRiveter \"Chesty\" O'Connor and his best friend \"Droopy\" join the US Navy to annoy O'Connor's nemesis, Chief Petty Officer \"Biff\" Martin. O'Connor gets himself court-martialled for being AWOL while visiting Martin's sister Dorothy. Disgruntled at his treatment, O'Connor angrily derides the Navy and finds himself ostracized by his fellow sailors.\n\nDuring gunnery practice, O'Connor helps put out a fire in a gun room and receives the Navy Cross medal, but is still determined to get out of the Navy. Later. O'Connor transfers to the US Naval Air Service and is assigned to the rigid airship USS Macon. When the Macon tries to dock, Martin is accidentally caught on a guide rope and is hoisted into the air. [Note 1] Despite orders, O'Connor climbs down the rope and saves Martin's life by parachuting both of them to the ground.\n\nLater, at the wedding of O'Connor to Dorothy, Martin finds out that O'Connor has been promoted to boatswain and now outranks him.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJames Cagney as Chester \"Chesty\" O'Connor\n\nPat O'Brien as Chief Petty Officer William \"Biff\" Martin\n\nGloria Stuart as Dorothy \"Dot\" Martin\n\nFrank McHugh as Wilbur \"Droopy\" Mullins\n\nDorothy Tree as Gladys\n\nWillard Robertson as Lieutenant Commander\n\nEddie Acuff as Marine Orderly\n\nGeorge Irving as Admiral\n\nSam McDaniel as Porter\n\nFred \"Snowflake\" Toones as Sailor\n\nNiles Welch as Officer\n\nLeo White as Professor\n\nHoward Hickman as Captain\n\nChuck Hamilton as Hood at Dance\n\nEddy Chandler as Supply Sergeant\n\nJoseph Crehan as Recruiting Officer\n\nIda Darling as Aunt\n\nEdward Earle as Navy Chaplain\n\nMaude Eburne as Droopy's Ma\n\nRobert Emmett as Tansey\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the full cooperation of the US Navy, principal photography, which ended early May 1934, took place at a number of naval facilities, including the Bremerton Navy yard, Washington, Naval Training Station, San Diego, California, as well as other locations in San Pedro and Sunnyvale, California.[3] Naval personnel made up many of the extras on the film. Of historical interest is that a portion of the filming of Here Comes the Navy took place aboard the battleship Arizona, which was sunk by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, at Pearl Harbor. Further, portions of the film also include shots of the dirigible Macon, a year before the accident that destroyed the airship with the loss of two crew.[4]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nIn his review for The New York Times, film critic Frank Nugent described Here Comes the Navy as another of the films in \"traditional Cagneyesque manner.\" \"Some of the heartiest laughs of the current cinema season were recorded last night in the Strand Theatre, where \"Here Comes the Navy\" had its metropolitan premi√®re. A fast-moving comedy enriched by an authentic naval setting, this Warner production has the added advantage, in these parlous times, of being beyond censorial reproach.\"[5]\n\nHere Comes the Navy was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,183,000 domestically and $575,000 internationally.[1]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nSmith, Richard K.
