Thanks to the miracles of digital video, Sokurov uses a single, unbroken, 90-minute shot to wind his way through the Hermitage in St. Petersburg--the repository of Russian art and the former home to royalty. Gliding through time, we glimpse Catherine II, modern-day museumgoers, and the doomed family of Nicholas II. History collapses on itself, as the opulence of the past and the horrors of the 20th century collide, and each door that opens onto yet another breathtaking gallery is another century to be heard from.

The year is 1936, and Stalin's purges are in full swing. Despite his reputation and revolutionary record, Sergei Kotov (Mikhalkov) seems to be on the dictator's hit list, as indicated by the insulting arrival of his wife's former lover, an agent of government police. Mikhalkov treats all this as a matter of personal and political intrigue dropping like rotting fruit in the middle of a sunny and loving period for the Kotov clan. The director ingeniously understates the mounting threat until one begins to realize that the Kotovs are only geographically distant from the long, bloody reach of Stalin. By the time we do realize it, the shock of change is almost unbearable. A very fine movie all around, though Mikhalkov's touches of magic realism (particularly the presence of a golden orb that keeps popping into the action) are distracting and a subject of controversy among viewers.

Earth, originally released as a motion picture in 1930. Bezhin meadow is a partial reconstruction from episodes originally filmed in 1935-1937.\n\nZerkalo = The Mirror (1974) directed by Andrei Tarkovsky PN1997 .M586 2000\n\nTarkovsky's looking glass is not merely cracked but shattered and we see the jagged, jumbled reflections of its shards, imges of Tarkovsky's childhood mixed with fragments of his adult life--a child's wartime exile, a mother's experience with political terror, the breakup of a marriage, life in a country home--all intermingled with slow-motion dream sequences and poetic chunks of stark newsreels.\n\nRepentance = Pokayaniye/directed by Tengiz Abulaze PN1997 .M4577 1988 Poka︠i︡anie = Repentance PN1997 .P6468 2003\n\nIn a small Russian village a woman is put on trial for repeatedly digging up the body of the town's recently deceased ruler. The trial gradually reveals the truth about the despot's vicious reign of terror, and forces the townspeople to face the reality of his (and the Soviet Union's) monstrous inhumanity during the Stalinist era.Comment: Another hit from the perestroika time.

Repentance was the first Soviet film that openly denounced the horrors of Stalinism, though the Georgian director Tengiz Abuladze chose to make it allegorical, deliberately using anachronisms and making the leading character look like a combination of Stalin's henchman Lavrentii Beriia, Hitler, and Mussolini.\n\nGREAT PATRIOTIC WAR / WWII (1940s)\n\nOsvobozhdenie = Liberation (1968-1971) directed by Yuri Ozerov PN1997 .O7164 2004\n\nWar, Drama, Color, 445 min; Format: Full screen, 4:3; Russian film director Yuri Ozerov's most famous work was the five-part WWII epic Osvobozhdeniye (The Liberation) that was hugely popular in his native country -- each of the first two parts was seen by 56 million people.
