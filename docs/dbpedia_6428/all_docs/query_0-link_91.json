The first makes gloopy studio fodder like Good Will Hunting and the odious Finding Forrester. The second is the visionary auteur of Drugstore Cowboy, Gerry, My Own Private Idaho and the Palme d’Or-winning Elephant (an elegant, ultimately devastating take on the Columbine tragedy). For the record, it is the second Gus Van Sant who gets the votes here.\n\nSubstance 14\n\nLook 14\n\nCraft 15\n\nOriginality 14\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 73\n\n39. David Fincher\n\nHeading the list of the pop-promo-and-TV-commercial wonderkids of the early 90s, Fincher successfully brought that world’s visual inventiveness into the feature film world. In Alien 3, Seven, and Fight Club, he forged a string of visceral, unforgettable images; but his subsequent career has been dogged by aborted projects. Fincher’s most recent film, the unremarkable Panic Room, saw him in a holding pattern - it’s certainly cost him a few points.\n\nSubstance 12\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 14\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 74\n\n38.

Not that you’d want him to change. Miike’s casual technical brilliance and total disregard for taste are what makes his best films such a joy.

Either way, there’s no denying the impact of this phobic, Prozac-popping Dane. His most successful pictures (Breaking the Waves, The Idiots, the upcoming Dogville) are hazardous human dramas in which cruelty and compassion come equally blended. Happily there seems little danger of von Trier selling out and heading to Hollywood. He hates America and nurses a crippling fear of flying.\n\nSubstance 14\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 14\n\nTotal 76\n\n36.

Her films get bolder and more confrontational every time - Blackboards took her into the Kurdish lands on the Iranian border; her latest, At Five in the Afternoon, was shot in the chaos of post-Taliban Afghanistan - but for all their political currency, there’s still evidence of an artistic sensibility.

Larry and Andy Wachowski\n\nNow that their Matrix trilogy is finally wrapped up, it’s a good time to draw breath and appreciate the scale of the Wachowskis’ achievement. Merging the techno-porn of the contemporary action movie with the artful ballet of the Hong Kong martial arts film, the sci-fi paranoia of Philip K Dick with the visual exuberance of Japanese anime, the Matrix phenomenon utterly redefined the nature of the blockbuster movie serial, as well as relegating such mid-90s action luminaries as John Woo and Roland Emmerich to the margins.

He dished up a deadpan Oedipal comedy with 1994’s Spanking the Monkey and then dispatched Ben Stiller cross-country in the freewheeling adoption caper Flirting With Disaster. Yet this tart, original talent adapts well to other terrain. On the one hand his big-budget Three Kings was an expert, high-concept war thriller. On the other, it can be read as a savage assault on bungled US policy during the first Gulf War.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 15\n\nOriginality 15\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 76\n\n33. Pawel Pawlikowski\n\nWith only one substantial feature under his belt, Polish-born, British-based director Pawlikowski has arguably the slenderest claim of all to be on this list. But Last Resort, with its mix of heartfelt social insight (the then-radical subject of asylum seekers) and improvisatory, documentary-style film-making, has exerted an influence of gigantic proportions on a whole generation of British cinema.

There’s nothing pretty about either his carnal debut Seul Contre Tous, or last year’s backwards-told rape-revenge drama Irréversible - both have challenged boundaries of decency and induced reactions as extreme as nausea and vomiting. In a supposedly unshockable age, that’s some kind of cinematic achievement.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 14\n\nTotal 77\n\n31. Richard Linklater\n\nLinklater is the grunge philosopher of independent cinema. Hailing from Austin, Texas, he casually defined an era with 1991’s loose-knit, haphazard Slacker. The uproarious Dazed and Confused and the seductive Before Sunrise extolled the joys of footloose youth, while his animated Waking Life spun a woozy, bong-smoking rumination on dreams and reality. Incredibly, Linklater recently graduated to the big time when his School of Rock hit number one at the US box office.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 15\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 78\n\n30. Takeshi Kitano\n\nFew directors have ever made themselves look as cool as Kitano has. His shark-eyed gangster persona became a fixture of Japanese action thrillers in the 1990s, but behind the camera his controlled blend of visual slapstick and sudden violence has become a distinctive style. Recent efforts have seen him trying to diversify. Dolls was a subdued art film, but next year’s Zatoichi is a sword-swishing crowd pleaser.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 15\n\nTotal 78\n\n29. Wes Anderson\n\nNo less an authority than Martin Scorsese recently tipped Anderson as the brightest hope for American cinema. Scripted in tandem with his actor buddy Owen Wilson, Anderson’s work is literate, quirky and unexpectedly moving. His breakthrough picture, Rushmore, amounted to a poignant salute to high-school losers everywhere. More recently, the vibrant, Salinger-esque The Royal Tenenbaums charted the decline and fall of a precocious New York family.\n\nSubstance 13\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 78\n\n28. Michael Moore\n\nYou could say it’s Moore’s blend of humour, righteousness and persistence that has made his documentaries so successful, but his political commitment would be nothing without the film-making skills to back it up. Bowling for Columbine has been one of the most influential films of recent years, affecting the public in a way that most directors on this list will never know, but it would never have become such a cause had it not been so rigorously researched, painstakingly constructed and broadly entertaining.\n\nSubstance 17\n\nLook 13\n\nCraft 15\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 79\n\n27. Ang Lee\n\nHe may have taken a bit of a stumble with The Hulk, his elevation to blockbusterdom, but the Taiwanese-born Lee clocked up plenty of brownie points over the preceding decade for his dazzling versatility, if nothing else. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (a record-breaker for a subtitled film), The Ice Storm, The Wedding Banquet and Sense and Sensibility are all testament to a career of wonderfully fertile cinematic cross-pollination. Lee’s proficiency at swapping genres, but retaining a purposeful humaneness, is his hallmark.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 17\n\nOriginality 14\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 79\n\n26. Alexander Sokurov\n\nThe veteran Russian director is inexhaustibly prolific, making both features and documentaries, with 31 credits to his name over a 23-year career. His movies are powerful, poetic, often severe, and at their most accessible when they meditate on the nature of Russia. Sokurov had his biggest recent success with Russian Ark: a staggeringly ambitious single-take 90-minute journey through the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. His latest movie, Father And Son, is an enigmatic and often baffling study of a father-son relationship between two soldiers. His work gets a lively, mixed reaction in the west, but Sokurov’s admirers revere the haunting, occasionally austere power of his films.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 79\n\n25. Spike Jonze\n\nBorn into millionaire stock (and heir to the Spiegel mail-order catalogue fortune), Spike Jonze has installed himself as the genius jester in the court of King Hollywood. His 1999 debut, Being John Malkovich, was a delirious satire on celebrity culture, while Adaptation led the viewer on a slaloming joyride along the border between truth and fiction. Inevitably, though, one cannot celebrate Jonze without also crediting his scriptwriter - the ingenious Charlie Kaufman.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 14\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 79\n\n24. Alexander Payne\n\nPayne came to prominence in 1999 with his stunning high school satire Election, the Animal Farm of American sexual politics in the Clinton era. From here, Payne went on to direct About Schmidt, which gave Jack Nicholson the best role of his late career. With these two movies, Payne has established an auteur distinctiveness: amplifying the disappointment and regret lurking within the peppy, can-do civic culture of middle America, while acknowledging the sweetness and innocence that is still there.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 15\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 79\n\n23. Walter Salles\n\nThe godfather and trailblazer of the buena onda - the “good wave” of contemporary Latin American cinema, Salles’s directorial reputation rests largely on two recent films, Central Station and Behind the Sun, which virtually on their own put Brazilian cinema on the map. Salles has just finished another road movie, The Motorcycle Diaries, based on Che Guevara’s book, for Britain’s FilmFour, and is finally going Hollywood with a remake of Hideo “Ring” Nakata’s Dark Water. But Salles is equally notable as a facilitator for other Brazilian projects - most importantly the sensational City of God, which he co-produced.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 15\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 79\n\n22. Michael Haneke\n\nNo one, perhaps not even Gaspar Noé, delivers more hardcore horror than the German-born Austrian Haneke - even when his shocks are happening off camera, which they mostly do. After a long career in TV, Haneke graduated to the big screen in the early 90s and audiences quickly came to know they were in for a profoundly uncomfortable experience.The Piano Teacher, with Isabelle Huppert, was a disquieting study of a musician driven to agonies of despair and self-loathing. More recently, Time of the Wolf was an almost unwatchably horrible vision of post-apocalyptic Europe.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 13\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 79\n\n21.

His two best pictures (Boogie Nights and Magnolia) are works of gob-smacking ambition in one so young - lush, multi-layered ensemble pieces that spotlight the damaged souls of his native San Fernando Valley. But let’s not forget the recent Punch-Drunk Love, starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson. Smaller in scale but no less turbulent, this undervalued effort is like a nail bomb in the guise of a romantic comedy.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 17\n\nIntelligence 15\n\nTotal 79\n\n20.

His films spirit us from Hardy’s Wessex (Jude) to war-torn Bosnia (Welcome to Sarajevo), and from post-punk Manchester (24 Hour Party People) to the asylum-seekers’ “silk road” out of Pakistan (In This World). As well as being technically brilliant and a seeming workaholic, Winterbottom is arguably the most politically astute director in the business, with an unerring eye for the stories that matter. British cinema would be lost without him.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 17\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 80\n\n19. Aki Kaurismaki\n\nCinema needs the occasional breath of fresh air, and you can always rely on Kaurismaki to provide it. Coming from Finland, he had a head start, but where other quirky directors last a film or two, Kaurismaki seems to have a bottomless pool of eccentric ideas to draw from. His films are an acquired taste, but they never pander to good taste. For a supposed director of art films, he’s more interested in the world out on the street, or in the gutter. And his most recent, The Man Without a Past, saw him re-emerge into the global spotlight after some years at its fringe.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 15\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 80\n\n18. Tsai Ming-Liang\n\nOne of the least well-known names on the list, but a director who has steadily refined his own gentle, bittersweet style. Using his native Taipei as a backdrop, Tsai distills the complexity and alienation of city life into films that are austere, unhurried and emotional, but also comical. His pre-apocalyptic The Hole included 1950s musical numbers, for example, while What Time Is It There? paid homage to Harold Lloyd in a movie about death and loneliness. In his latest, Goodbye Dragon Inn, he has almost done away with dialogue altogether.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 80\n\n17. Quentin Tarantino\n\nThe jury may still be undecided on the virtues of Kill Bill, but no one can deny the massive impact the former video-store clerk has had on cinema across the world. The chewy, minutiae-obsessed dialogue and abundant bloodletting of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction catapulted him to era-defining stature and influence beyond the wildest dreams of any director; had this poll been taken in 1995, he would have been top three, no question. But Tarantino has since been the victim of his own success: he took three years to make his third film, Jackie Brown, and another six to make his fourth. Perhaps inevitably, neither of them made the splash of his first two, but whatever else, Tarantino can still make the simple act of watching a film seem oh-so-exciting.\n\nSubstance 14\n\nLook 17\n\nCraft 18\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 14\n\nTotal 81\n\n16.

In 1996 Haynes had made an earlier masterpiece, Safe; few directors could have topped that, but Far From Heaven managed it.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 81\n\n15.

But Almodovar is much more than some posturing agent provocateur. He spins soulful, spellbinding stories and creates characters that ring with life. All About My Mother and Talk to Her were exotic masterpieces that confirmed their creator as the most important Spanish director since Luis Buñuel.\n\nSubstance 15\n\nLook 16\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 18\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 81\n\n14.

His trademark portraits of quirky urban longing have influenced Asian film as a whole, but the delectably sensuous In the Mood for Love proved that Wong is still improving (and that he has one of the best cinematographers in the business in Christopher Doyle).

His recent Werckmeister Harmonies was a dreamlike film: compelling and sublime. From 1994, Satantango has cult status on the festival circuit, not least for its awe-inspiring length: seven hours.

Her first film, Ratcatcher, set during the binmen strikes of 70s Glasgow, was the anti-Billy Elliot; her second, adapted from Alan Warner’s novel Morvern Callar, confirmed her promise. Morvern is an authentic modern classic, with an actress, Samantha Morton, whose blank-faced performance is a perfect complement to Ramsay’s studied camerawork.\n\nSubstance 16\n\nLook 17\n\nCraft 17\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 16\n\nTotal 82\n\n11.

His 2001 hit Together - about hippies living communally in 1970s Stockholm - was warm, witty and altogether disarming. By contrast, his follow-up, Lilya 4-Ever (about a Russian teen dragooned into prostitution), was a social-realist vision of hell.

Terence Davies\n\nOur highest-placed British film-maker is here because of his uncompromising and unique cinematic vision; but, with painful irony, it’s also made him the highest-profile victim of Britain’s commercial film industry revival. Emerging from the state-sponsored art-film sector in the mid-80s, Davies completed a trilogy of short films and two features - Distant Voices, Still Lives and The Long Day Closes. But, in a more cut-throat environment, the sensitive Davies has suffered, making only two films in a decade - one of them the international hit The House of Mirth. So it seems a shame - and somehow scandalous - that his current project, an adaptation of Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s Sunset Song, should be facing major funding obstacles.\n\nSubstance 17\n\nLook 17\n\nCraft 16\n\nOriginality 16\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 83\n\n9.

Crash set the entire film world agog with its bizarre sexual constructs; eXistenZ examined the implications of the virtual world more thoughtfully than most; and Spider superbly summoned up a bleak, decaying Britishness (largely forgotten by our own film-makers).

He’s now in his 60s, but as this year’s Spirited Away proved, the work just keeps getting better. His films create the world anew, literally. Each is set in an intricate, self-contained fantasy world that’s been built from scratch and drawn with devotion.

Operating mostly in rural Iran, Kiarostami has often concealed potentially life-threatening political commentary within films of simplicity and compassion. But he has complicated his medium, too, by mixing drama and documentary, and actors and non-actors, to dizzying effect.

Even so, the wild beauty of his 1973 debut Badlands casts a formidable shadow, while his sprawling 1999 war epic The Thin Red Line at least proved that the master had lost none of his magic.

Nobody makes films like David Lynch. He is our spooky tour guide through a world of dancing dwarves, femme fatales and little blue boxes that may (or may not) contain all the answers. We wouldn’t want to live in the places he takes us. Somehow, we suspect, we do.\n\nSubstance 17\n\nLook 18\n\nCraft 18\n\nOriginality 19\n\nIntelligence 17\n\nTotal 89"
