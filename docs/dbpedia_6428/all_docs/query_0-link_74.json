        "text": "The subject matter is certainly important, as human trafficking has become a much storied and horrific issue around the globe. This film however suffers from some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a film. Many scenes are extraordinarily drawn out for no reason, for no point whatsoever. Other parts are extremely vague, and never end up showing us what the part was even about. There is really only one interesting and remotely clever moment in the entire film, but it is quickly ruined by where it leads. None, and I do repeat none of the characters are interesting at all. Everything and everyone in the film is either quite flat or dreary, or both. The truck driver you could say is perhaps slightly interesting, but what they do with him in the story also leaves his part of the film feeling mostly pointless, and very unfitting by the end. This film is so naive, it seems as though it was written by a child. I've seen and rated thousands and thousands of films on this site. By the end of this, it really is one of the more unbalanced, pointless, and insincere stories I've ever come across. It's also amazingly boring. It tries at times to throw heavy guilt around, and yet at other times the dialogue is overly vulgar and sensationalistic without any clear reason for this at all plot wise. It really makes no sense, these parts feel so out of place. As I alluded to earlier, it seems like this was written by someone with very little real world experience in much of anything. It's a very immature film in nearly every single way, but this is not at all an immature subject. This combination just makes for a truly terrible film.\n\n2/10.\n\nIn one aspect this movie is very realistic. It shows that those involved into the trade of humans don't care about their victims. They are nothing more than merchandise that can be sold several times to make more and more money....with estimated $150 billions a year nearly as successful as drugs but with less riscs. The acting is OK, the plot...well it's a movie. If they would show the real thing: around 30 customers/day, organ harvesting, child trafficking, beatings, drugs, selling and buying 'fresh meat' at a daily base, corruption at every scale.....such a movie would never seen the light.\n\nOf course this is not something for everyone....but I would recommend it to watch it and than discuss the problems with your kids....because this happens every minute.\n\nSlick well dressed Russian dudes forcing girls into a dirty lifestyle abducting them and prostituting them. That's what you'll get here. A lot of liberties taken (obviously, it's a movie so there has to be an aspect of entertainment) otherwise the subject matter would literally make the movie unwatchable (watch \"Lilya 4-Ever\" if that's what your into, though). All the stuff about the sex trafficking is pretty interesting but hard to watch. It's not going to leave you feeling good, that's for sure. It may have the opposite effect, watching girls covered in dirt and cuts gets raped while they scream bloody murder, not exactly for everyone. Definitely not a great movie (a bit confused why the baddies are Russian: not sure why it's necessary we sympathize with the evil characters so much: for sure it's focus drops and stops having the punch it started with). Would have given it 5 stars but since it actually tries to spread some awareness gave it a little higher. If you can stomach it watch this instead of some easily digested Hollywood movie, feels more rewarding."
