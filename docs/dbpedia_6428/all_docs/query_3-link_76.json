        "text": "DL: What were your feelings about the collapse of the USSR?\n\nLM: I am not nostalgic about the political system. For example, when we made the scene in the submarine base they had just had a big celebration for people who had worked there before. It was not political. It was just that this had been their way of life and now their lives had been ruined. I can relate to that but I don't want a return to the Soviet system. One of the ironies and tragedies of history is that those societies that were raped by Soviet communism are now being raped by capitalism. It is like double abuse. The fact now is that we are rich and they are poor. We have some things that they don't have. And that is wrong. And I think it is very important not to blame the victims but to blame the people who are doing these bad things. I think we must take responsibility for what is happening in Eastern Europe. Sorry, I keep talking about responsibility. But this is where the demand exists. This is where they are sold and abused. I think that the main reason for trafficking is economic injustices of the world. I don't think that the problem can be solved without major social, economic, cultural and political revolution. I think the world will explode if that doesn't happen soon.\n\nDL: Can you see that happening?\n\nLM: Yes, I can. Everything is difficult but everything is possible. You just have to look at how fast things in the world change. A very bad catastrophe in every way happened with the Twin Towers but it was interesting that everything changed in the world in two minutes. I believe that it is possible to change the world in a positive way in two minutes. I am not sure exactly how or in what direction. But I do think it's possible.\n\nDL: I am now going to open it up to questions from the audience.\n\nQ: I am interested in your work with handheld cameras but wonder if you would like to move into the more formally composed work of people like Kubrick?\n\nLM: I would like to move in many different directions. So far it has been a matter of creating a visual style that works both on a visual level but also in a way that allows freedom for the actors. I think that acting is more important than the camera. I am not saying that it is always like that but it is with the films that I have made so far. I also think that my visual style has changed from film to film. That is something that I work rather intuitively on with my photographer. It is quite hard to answer questions about why we made certain decisions. It is quite abstract and a bit mysterious for me.\n\nQ: How does your work fit into the Swedish tradition?\n\nLM: I am more inspired by things other than films. As a film director, I am more inspired by things that happen in reality, books that I read or music. As a human being I am quite inspired by films. I like films that make me question my life. But as a film-maker I am not sure I have really dealt with being a part or not being part of the Swedish tradition of film-making. There were some things that happened in Sweden in the 70s that I liked. But I am not sure how I fit into a tradition. One thing that could be specifically Swedish is the idea of taking children seriously in the movies and of taking children's movies seriously. It doesn't mean that the films are good but I do think there is an attempt to take them seriously.\n\nQ: How hard is it for actors to keep a level of realism, while sticking to the script?\n\nLM: For me it is very important to find the right actors. When I have found the right actors I must know that they can connect with the character. When I know that I can relax and trust them, and they can trust me. I don't like rehearsal and things like that. I just let them say what they are meant to say.\n\nQ: What are the differences between directing children and adults?\n\nLM: I am personally more nervous directing adults. I am not saying that they are more difficult but I am more nervous about it. Some professional actors have worked a bit too much, which makes them more sure about their methods. They are not all like that but some of them are. I also think that, going back to the Lego thing, some actors build their characters so that they don't break and are symmetrical. But they are not strange. Children have better imaginations and are more in touch with their intuitive sides. It sometimes feels like I have to intellectualise more with adult actors. Children don't have to know the whole time why they are doing something. They are just present.\n\nQ: How does God fit into your films?\n\nLM: I believe in God but I am not an enormously religious person. I believe but I also doubt. I am not sure about things but I believe in Jesus and I believe in God. It was important when I realised that believing meant just that - believing. You don't know. Before I wasn't sure if I believed. But you don't have to be sure about believing. You can just believe.\n\nQ: What is your next project?\n\nLM: There are many things that I am interested in but I do not know exactly what I am going to do next. Even if I did know, I am not sure if I would say. There are some elements in Lilya 4-Ever that I am still interested in, such as consumerism. We live in a society where people believe that everything can be bought and everything can be sold. But it will deal with a different set of issues, I think.\n\nQ: What frustrates you?\n\nLM: In Sweden, I am frustrated by intolerance. I am frustrated by silence. I am frustrated by empty streets on Sundays. I am frustrated by segregation. I sometimes do like empty streets and silence but I never like segregation.\n\nQ: How much editing do your films go through?\n\nLM: Quite a lot. Together was the film that transformed the most in editing. Lilya 4-Ever wasn't that hard to edit but it changed a little. Together was special because we changed everything around. We mixed everything around. I think it is important to have people around you that you trust. You can be quite lazy as a director when you are editing. I have a tendency to say that the film is finished when it isn't. But I have a team around me who tell me when it isn't, which can be frustrating because it means more work.\n\nQ: Has there been much difference in the reaction of men and women to Lilya 4-Ever?\n\nLM: It's a good question. I can give you some facts, even if they are generalising and stereotypical and there are obviously many exceptions. It seems to be seen in a more positive way by women than men. I receive letters saying that this is the best film they have ever seen and they are always women. Almost all of the negative responses I have received are from men. In the Swedish newspapers there were four film critics who had a grade of zero to six, with six at the top. The two female critics gave it six and five but the two male critics gave it two. That's an extreme example but that is the case. It is interesting to think about why but I am not sure why.\n\nQ: What is the difference in screen-writing and writing poetry?\n\nLM: I am trying to combine the two things now. They used to be very different. My poetry was very self-centred and I then had a reaction against poetry. So far my films have been very realistic, except for some parts of Lilya 4-Ever. But I am now interested in combining the two voices I have in my head but I am not sure if it will happen. I have now written things that are closer to poetry that I would like to translate into films.\n\nQ: Do you think you will make more films abroad?\n\nLM: I will always be a Swedish film-maker first and foremost. But there are one or two subjects that I find very interesting that would be more suited to the English-speaking world. I would like to make a film in America. There are things that really interest me there - some are positive but some are negative.\n\nQ: I don't believe in God and I find the ending of Lilya 4-Ever very depressing. I just don't see any hope there.\n\nLM: Even if you don't believe in God, you have to accept that some people live in hell on earth. For some people there is no hope. If we talk about a woman who jumps from the bridge after she has been repeatedly raped in a country where she doesn't understand a word and her mother has left her there is of course hope that things will change for her if she doesn't jump. But if she does jump from the bridge I personally cannot live with the idea that she just dies. I believe that when she does jump, she will meet someone. Even if you cannot relate to that, I think that the film in itself can play a part in the world to create hope. The film is in itself hopeful. When people see the film, some people get sad, some people get depressed but some people get angry. I think that people getting angry is, in itself, hopeful.\n\nQ: How important is music to you?\n\nLM: It is important to me personally and as a director. I work with music a lot to illustrate things but also to play a realistic and dramatic part in the story. In this film, the Russian pop music has meaning. It is not just pop music. The songs mean something. With this film, I wanted to achieve the effect of the audience being hit by a bulldozer. That's what I wanted the film to be. Some people say that the film is predictable but I wanted people to know what was going to happen. The music is a very important part of that.\n\nDL: Thank you very much for coming, Lukas. It has been a pleasure.\n\n[Applause]"
