        "text": "Before I bid adieu-or a more tentative au revoir-to the 2003 movie year, with its insane schedule of 500 or so releases, I’d like to take a stab at explaining my modus operandi behind my end-of-year list-making, an activity I’ve been engaged in for close to half a century. This year, I’m comparatively late in unveiling my various lists, mostly because it’s taken me well into the new year to drag myself through three hours and 20 minutes-a long time for my shrinking life span-of Peter Jackson’s widely acclaimed Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King . But of course I had to see it, before inevitably leaving it off my 10-best list of films in the English language.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

Back in the 40’s, I took to heart a seemingly casual comment by the British film critic, C.L. Lejeune. She observed that the greatest gift of the film medium may turn out to be not so much its scope as its intimacy. And when I think of my most cherished moviegoing memories, it is a voice, a face, a pair of eyes that haunt my dreams-not vast hordes of extras assembled for battle. This is not to say that thrilling charges don’t rock my boat, especially the ill-fated battles in Henry V , Four Feathers and Alexander Nevsky , a foolish but stirringly heroic tradition currently preserved in The Last Samurai and Lord of the Rings .\n\nMy esteemed colleagues have compared Rings with the epic periods of David Lean and the silent-era Fritz Lang of Die Niebelungen . Putting Lang aside, I much prefer the earlier Lean of Brief Encounter , The Passionate Friends and Great Expectations to the later Lean of The Bridge on the River Kwai , Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago .\n\nThough the final segment of Mr. Jackson’s massive enterprise is well-crafted, surprisingly well-paced and not without its own subtleties, I still feel that its most popular feature is teenage narcissism, elevated to the level of cosmic megalomania: The fate of a kingdom, its massed armies and the earth itself-mythologically “Middle” as it may be-hangs on an accursed magic ring on a hobbit’s finger. So it won’t be a surprise that I prefer Mr. Jackson’s earlier, earthbound work in Heavenly Creatures (1994) to his efforts in Middle Earth.\n\nHaving said that, Mr. Jackson’s prodigious energy in transforming New Zealand into a worldwide tourist attraction cannot be dismissed, and in this spirit I hereby institute the annual Star Wars Prize and present it to Mr. Jackson for fashioning a franchise blockbuster that has made it even harder for grown-up films in the pipeline to be made. Ah-hemmm.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my other choices, both positive and negative, for a year in which there were more talented players than there were creative projects.
