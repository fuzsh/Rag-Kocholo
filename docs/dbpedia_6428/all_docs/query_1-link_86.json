        "text": "Current Swedish cinema is local - but also international, moving freely between different worlds and shunning neither large nor small. It presents both totally ordinary characters and some extremely odd ones, and ranges in scope from epic megamovies to private cell phone films on microbudgets. The new directors, who have just embarked on their careers, are as interested as their established predecessors in describing relationships-but from their own special perspectives rooted in contemporary Sweden. Their films feature both the undead and the very much alive. Close collaboration between creative directors, producers and actors has yielded an array of multifaceted films rich in depth and color. Swedish film - Fired by Passion describes how these moviemakers are trying out fresh approaches and exploring genres, extending boundaries or following traditions. Welcome to the new Swedish film scene!"
