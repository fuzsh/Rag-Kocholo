        "text": "Lilja 4-Ever has been selected as Sweden's entry for next year's Oscars, despite worries that it would fail a language requirement as it is filmed almost entirely in Russian.\n\nThe film is a dark tale of a girl who escapes her life in Russia for a similarly bleak existence in Sweden, and was thought to be ineligible for the foreign language Oscars because of its dialogue.\n\nAcademy rules stipulate that the dialogue of competing films must be largely in the language of the country of origin, but an exception is apparently being made on the grounds that \"the story mandates that an additional non-English language be predominant\".\n\nScreen Daily reports that the film, which is directed by Lukas Moodysson, has been critically acclaimed in Sweden and been sold for distribution in the USA and many European countries, including the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, two other countries have submitted their entries for the best foreign language film at the Oscars, ahead of the deadline at the end of this week.\n\nBrazil's gangland drama City of God (Cidade De Deus) and India's blockbuster Devdas have joined films from 15 other countries."
