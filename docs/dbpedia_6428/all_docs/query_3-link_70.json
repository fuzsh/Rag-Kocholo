Apple just hosts that content all the while the distributor makes it available.\n\nHave you looked back at your purchase history?\n\nIf you have an iPhone or iPad open the iTunes Store app and select More at the bottom then select purchased, do any of those movies show up in the list?\n\nAnother possibility have you looked under your AppleID to see if they’ve somehow been put in your hidden purchases library?\n\nAs far as the service goes you haven’t lost access to the service so nothing for Apple to warn you about.\n\nDigital ownership is more complicated than it needs to be but iTunes is just a digital storefront which upon purchase your digital license resides with the studio/distributor who put it in the store.

Nor are they available for purchase any more. I keep all my iTunes receipt emails as proof of purchase.\n\nI have about 500 purchased iTunes movies, and several are now gone. Whilst a 1% disappearance rate may not sound like a big deal, it's very annoying when it does happen.\n\nMy contention is that if a service suddenly fails to deliver everything I expect, that is a failure and - at the very least - warrants a warning that one should download the movie somewhere to keep a permanent record.\n\nMy contention is that if a service suddenly fails to deliver everything I expect, that is a failure and - at the very least - warrants a warning that one should download the movie somewhere to keep a permanent record.\n\nTV app (used to be iTunes) on a personal computer is the only place, where you can download a backup copy to your own storage. Not the 4K version, though. Only SD/720p/1080p and only SDR and without Atmos.\n\nI have noticed in the past, a film I bought a long time ago doesn't show on my iPad (icloud content), but is on my Mac, because I downloaded it.\n\nAlso if I search for it in the store, it shows the price again, rather than the download icon.\n\nYes, that has happened to me a few times as well. I suspect that the content owner remove the movie from sale - bingo, your purchase has gone - then they, or another distributor, make it available for purchase again. You’ve lost your money and you have to “buy“ it again to watch it. Tell me how that’s good for the customer!\n\nIt's made clear when you \"purchase\" a movie or TV series that you're purchasing a non-exclusive license to download and/or stream the item in question.

What about Apple Books? As best I can tell I keep books that have been deleted from the store."
