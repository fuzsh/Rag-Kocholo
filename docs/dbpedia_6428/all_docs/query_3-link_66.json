        "text": "Fourth annual film issue in store now.\n\nwww.indexmagazine.com\n\nON THE COVER: THE DARK UNIVERSE OF AMY SEDARIS\n\nAMY: “What makes you laugh?”\n\nAMY: “Everything. During the recent hurricanes in Florida, my friend’s mother was outside praying for the hurricane to stop, and her wig blew off her head. Can’t write that shit.”\n\nIn an index exclusive, the star of cult cable comedy Strangers with Candy is interviewed by the one person who understands the inner demons that fuel her comedy – her best friend and worst enemy, herself.\n\nPhotos by Leeta Harding\n\nGUERILLA FILMMAKING: WERNER HERZOG AND DOUG AITKEN\n\n“I scared my wife recently by saying that I should be the first director to make a real porno movie.” Werner Herzog, master filmmaker, and Doug Aitken, video artist, compare notes on the rigors of filming in the jungle, why theater is a dead art form, and what you need to make a real movie – karate, Fred Astaire, or porn.\n\nPhotos by Doug Aitken\n\nSCOTTISH VERITE\n\n“I cast a lot of kids straight from the street – to change the way they speak would make things far too stilted.” Lynne Ramsay’s poetic tales of Scottish inner city life are the only English-language films to come with subtitles. The director of Morvern Callar talks about the challenges of working with kids straight from the street, her new project with Warp Records, and staying indie in the face of international acclaim.\n\nPhotos by Juergen Teller\n\nDOES SYD MEAD DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?\n\n“Science fiction designers nowadays don’t want to design some wild futuristic thing and then find it for sale in the latest Sharper Image catalog.”\n\nSelf-proclaimed visual futurist Syd Mead shaped the retro-tech worlds of Blade Runner, Aliens, and Tron. The son of a Baptist minister with a sharp wit and eye for telling detail, Mead’s pragmatism is matched only by his wry sense of humor. He tells photographer Shawn Mortensen about scrounging for junk to build Blade Runner’s street sets, and Steven Spielberg’s fast cars and bad dress sense.\n\nPhotos by Shawn Mortensen\n\nA MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION\n\n“As a teen, I spent a lot of time in my room chain-smoking and watching Z Channel. And it wasn’t just me – everybody in Los Angeles watched it.”\n\nIn her new documentary, Xan Cassavetes traces the rise and tragic fall of Z Channel, the all-movie cable station of the ’70s and ’80s. It brought Paul Verhoeven, Rodney Dangerfield, and Bernardo Bertolucci to a generation of L.A. teens including Quentin Tarantino and Alexander Payne.\n\nPhotos by Todd Cole\n\nALSO IN THIS ISSUE Interviews with:\n\n– Aiden Shaw, porn star and poet, featured in Timothy Greenfield-Sanders’ new book, XXX;\n\n– Oksana Akinshina, 17-year-old Russian star of Lilya 4-Ever;\n\n– Steve Golin, movie and music video producer;\n\n– Seu Jorge, Brazilian star of Wes Anderson’s upcoming The Life Aquatic;\n\nAnd\n\n– On the set of Everything is Illuminated: Photo portfolio by Susanna Howe.\n\nSubscribe online at www.indexmagazine.com/subscribe.shtml\n\nComplete interview archive at www.indexmagazine.com\n\ne-flux announcements are emailed press releases for art exhibitions from all over the world.\n\nAgenda delivers news from galleries, art spaces, and publications, while Criticism publishes reviews of exhibitions and books.\n\nArchitecture announcements cover current architecture and design projects, symposia, exhibitions, and publications from all over the world.\n\nFilm announcements are newsletters about screenings, film festivals, and exhibitions of moving image.\n\nEducation announces academic employment opportunities, calls for applications, symposia, publications, exhibitions, and educational programs.\n\nSign up to receive information about events organized by e-flux at e-flux Screening Room, Bar Laika, or elsewhere."
