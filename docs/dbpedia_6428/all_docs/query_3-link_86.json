        "text": "There’s never a need for an excuse to seek out movies that will make you cry, and we have you covered with the saddest Hollywood movies ever. Per the inimitable Nicole Kidman, movies have a unique power to provoke intense emotions, and frankly that may be all that’s separating us from the looming robots at this point. Plus shedding emotional tears is scientifically proven to release oxytocin and endorphins. (That’s why you sometimes feel refreshed or calmer after a good cry.) So whether you’re in the mood to get a little misty-eyed or are looking for a nice cathartic chest sob, enjoy below our all-time favourite movies for when you need a good cry.\n\nBelow, find a list of our all-time favourite saddest Hollywood movies that are all but guaranteed to induce a cathartic crying jag.\n\nAll of Us Strangers (2023)\n\nIn Andrew Haigh’s wrenching fantasy-tinged drama, a reclusive screenwriter (Andrew Scott, in an Oscar-snubbed performance) embarks on an affair with a mysterious younger neighbour (Paul Mescal) while also encountering visions of his long-deceased parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy).\n\nHow to watch: In theatres on 8 March\n\nAftersun (2022)\n\nOne of the most acclaimed debuts in recent years, Charlotte Wells’s restrained, impressionistic drama is a meditation on memory through the eyes of an 11-year-old (Frankie Corio), who carefully observes her young father (Paul Mescal) as he wrestles with his demons on their Turkish vacation in the late 1990s. Mescal’s tremendous performance earned him an Academy Award nomination for best actor.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Prime Video\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin (2022)\n\nThis tragicomedy, directed and written by Martin McDonagh, tells the poignant story of two friends whose relationship comes to a sudden end at the close of the Irish Civil War in 1923. There’s plenty to get tearful about in Banshees—the punishing effects of isolation, the claustrophobia of a life with limited options, the tender bond between the character played by Colin Farrell and his sister. And perhaps you’ve heard of the sad fate of Jenny the donkey, perhaps the most sob-inducing performance of them all.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Disney+ Hotstar\n\nThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)\n\nThis aughts classic has a reputation for being a sickly-sweet girl-power film, and it’s deserved. But the movie based on the Ann Brashares novel also gets into some incredibly sad territory, from the loss of Bridget’s mom to Carmen’s pain over her dad’s remarriage to...Bailey. (No spoilers, but that particular plot line is guaranteed to make you sob.)\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Prime Video\n\nLiving (2022)\n\nBill Nighy earned an Oscar nomination for best actor for his moving portrayal of a bureaucrat in 1953 London who, facing a terminal illness, searches for meaning in life; also nominated was Nobel Prize–winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, who adapted the script from Akira Kurosawa’s 1952 film Ikiru.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Sony Liv\n\nPieces of a Woman (2021)\n\nThis film, which follows a young married woman (Vanessa Kirby) as she struggles with the devastating death of her baby during childbirth, isn’t for the faint of heart, but Kirby’s restrained yet heartbreaking performance adds a new layer of texture to the cultural conversation about miscarriage and pregnancy loss.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Netflix\n\nLittle Women (2019)\n\nThere’s plenty to smile about in this Greta Gerwig–directed adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott classic, (particularly the costumes). But without giving away too many spoilers, there’s also a metric ton of heartbreak and pain to contend with. (I am, once again, thinking about Jo’s speech on loneliness.)\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Zee5\n\nThe Way We Were (1973)\n\nFive words: “Your girl is lovely, Hubbell.” Do you really need to hear anything more to burst into tears? This 1970s Barbra Streisand classic set in the wild world of pre-WWII McCarthyism more than holds up as a study of two people who...just aren’t right for each other, no matter how much they want to be. (Sob.)\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Prime Video\n\nRent (2005)\n\nYes, it’s well-worn territory for musical-theatre nerds, but the script for this film adaptation of the 1996 Broadway show is absolutely heartrending, with tunes like “One Song Glory,” “Without You,” and “I’ll Cover You” absolutely firing up the tear ducts. We will always love you, Angel!\n\nManchester by the Sea (2016)\n\nThis Kenneth Lonergan film, which revolves around a depressed man taking care of his nephew after his brother dies, is practically a monument to depression. The bleary East Coast landscape only heightens the aura of despair in Manchester by the Sea, leaving you with a portrait of a family that’s guaranteed to make you call your mom and cry.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Prime Video\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)\n\nThis moody and unabashedly queer love story from director Céline Sciamma is, in a way, all the more beautiful for the brevity of its central affair. In the film, Adèle Haenel plays Héloïse, a sullen 18th-century French daughter of privilege, and Noémie Merlant plays Marianne, the adventurous artist hired to paint her. A star-crossed romance ensues.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Prime Video\n\nA Ghost Story (2017)\n\nA rumination on time and grief, love and loss, David Lowery’s supernatural drama involves the sheet-bedecked ghost of a recently deceased man (Casey Affleck) who must observe in silence what happens in his house after his death.\n\nBlackfish (2013)\n\nThis Gabriela Cowperthwaite–directed documentary isn’t the most traditional tearjerker, but the story of Tilikum, an orca who has taken the lives of three people during his time spent captive at various aquatic amusement parks, is definitely hard to watch (and will make you think twice about that trip to SeaWorld).\n\nDancer in the Dark (2000)\n\nLars von Trier’s Palme d’Or–winning, handheld-shot musical melodrama stars Björk (named best actress at Cannes) as a factory worker who’s slowly going blind and trying to scrape together money to save her son from the same fate. Fair warning: It’s an exceedingly bleak watch, with its musical interludes (including the Oscar-nominated song “I’ve Seen It All”) only exacerbating the dismalness.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Prime Video\n\nA Walk to Remember (2002)\n\nIs this rom-com extremely early aughts? Sure. Kind of cheesy? You bet. Still, we challenge you not to sob like a tiny baby as Jamie (Mandy Moore) and Landon (Shane West) fall in love in spite of everything and against the backdrop of Jamie’s tragic illness.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Prime Video\n\nInside Out (2015)\n\nThis is the rare film that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike, but if you do happen to be of legal driving age, you might find yourself welling up and feeling kind of embarrassed about it. Don’t! Pixar is nothing if not exceptional at crafting cartoons that get right to the heart of the human experience, and Inside Out is no exception.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Disney + Hotstar\n\nIngrid Goes West (2017)\n\nOkay, this movie is billed as more of a social-media romp than a tearjerker, and it’s easy to clock its quick pans through the Los Angeles of influencer culture and think of it as a comedy. At its heart, though, Matt Spicer’s film is about the devastating loneliness that propels one young woman to craft a fake identity around a friend crush, and without spoiling anything...let’s just say the ending is pretty painful to watch.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Prime Video\n\nThe Notebook (2004)\n\nI mean, can we even talk about sad movies without talking about The Notebook? This Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams–led romantic drama that tracks a couple from youthful intoxication to old age is emotionally potent enough to make you tear up anytime you hear the phrase “it’s not over.”\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Netflix\n\nBambi (1942)\n\nNobody gets the tears flowing freely like Walt Disney, the mastermind behind this animated classic about a baby deer who gets tragically separated from his mother. Yes, he makes forest friends, but that scene with the hunter traumatised generations of kids.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Disney + Hotstar\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars (2014)\n\nOur hearts will go on, as will our love for this ocean-set classic that sees Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio in career-defining roles as a pair of star-crossed lovers who—spoiler alert—meet an epically tragic end.\n\nHow to watch: Stream on Disney + Hotstar\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)\n\nOkay, all the Harry Potter movies contain some element of sob-worthiness, but this one stands apart because it’s the one where, well, a certain beloved character dies.
