        "meta_description": "The 16-year-old title character of this great, heartbreaking film by Lukas Moodysson, the Swedish director of &quot;Together,&quot; is a throwaway teenager abandoned by her mother in a grim, unidentified town somewhere in  the former Soviet Union. The tale of this vulnerable, credulous teenager, who prays earnestly to a cheap painting of an angel cradling a child, is a variation on countless true stories that have come out of Eastern Europe since the fall of Communism. Lilya is tricked into a life of forced prostitution in another country (in this case, Sweden) by gangsters posing as prospective employers. The film's most remarkable achievement is its presentation of Lilya's story as both an archetypal case study and a personal drama whose spunky central character you  come to care about so deeply that at each step toward her ruination you want to cry out a  warning. â€” Stephen Holden",

        "text": "In many ways the 16-year-old title character of Lukas Moodysson's great, heartbreaking ''Lilya 4-Ever'' could be any throwaway teenager living anywhere in the world. But growing up in a grim unidentified town somewhere in the former Soviet Union (much of the movie was filmed in Estonia) makes Lilya's plight infinitely sadder than if she were an overprivileged brat mopily foraging in a land of plenty.\n\nRoaming through an impoverished town whose decrepit public housing resembles stacked-up rows of army barracks crumbling under a slate sky, the local youth have nothing to do but scrounge around for whatever drugs and booze they can come up with, although sniffing glue seems the most popular escape into oblivion.\n\nThe movie, written and directed by the Swedish filmmaker who created a deeply humane, even-handed portrait of a 1970's commune in ''Together,'' follows Lilya (Oksana Akinshina) on a descent into a hell whose inevitability only makes it feel all the more tragic.\n\nLilya's future, like that of thousands of other girls drifting through the wreckage of the former Soviet Union, looks so bleak that she will pursue almost any path that holds out the promise of a better life somewhere else. And like thousands of those girls, this vulnerable, credulous teenager, who prays earnestly to a cheap painting of an angel cradling a child and boasts of having the same birthday as Britney Spears, is tricked into bartering away her one readily marketable asset, her nubile body.\n\nLilya's story is a variation on countless true stories that have come out of Eastern Europe since the fall of Communism about the luring of desperate underage girls with false promises of jobs in other countries, where they find themselves enslaved and forced to turn tricks without pay. Promised a real job in Sweden by a decoy posing as a boyfriend, Lilya is handed a fake passport and plane ticket and sent abroad. Her prospective employer, who immediately confiscates her documents, is really a pimp in a ruthlessly well-organized international operation in human traffic.\n\nThe most remarkable achievement of the film, which opens today in Manhattan and Los Angeles, is its presentation of Lilya's story as both an archetypal case study and a personal drama whose spunky central character you come to care about so deeply that you want to cry out a warning at each step toward her ruination.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
