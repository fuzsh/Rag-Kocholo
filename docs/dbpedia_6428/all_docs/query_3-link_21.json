        "text": "Здравствуйте, Charlie. There are many good Russian movies with both Russian and English subtitles. There are also many American movies put to English subtitles. I would highly recommend watching BOTH varieties of movies with BOTH combinations of subtitle presentation.\n\nListening to the movie in Russian with English subtitles will help your vocabulary. You'll learn some limited slang and idioms, and just expand your general vocabulary. This is an important element to add for being able to hear the contrast between Russian and English in terms of how things are expressed, as they are more often than not presented as very different sentence structures.\n\nListening to Russian with RUSSIAN subtitles is equally important. This will help your ability to comprehend Russian. As with any language, listening to Russian often seems like you're listening to something that is happening much faster than it actually is. Words in any language seem to a forgein speaker to run together. Being able to see exactly what's being said WHILE YOU HEAR IT is absolutely essential to improving comprehension of the spoken language.\n\nCheck out a movie called \"белое солнце пустыни.\" It's an older movie, but it's good, and the subtitles are done accurately (many Russian films have horrible subtitles, same with English to Russian films)\n\nCheers!\n\nMy friends learning Russian and I found an interesting way of watching Russian films with English (or Russian, depending on their level) subtitles simultaneously (meaning both of us turn on the very same version of the film with the same subs simultaneously) and watch it together having audio or text chat in Skype at the same time. Personally I find audio chat quite distracting, but some people prefer it.\n\nWhile watching I usaully comment some scenes (if it's related to traditions or politics and might be unclear for a non-Russian speaker in some way ), correct subtitles etc. All the friends admitted they were missing quite a lot watching the films on their own.\n\nWe usually watch either Soviet classics (e.g. Moscow does not believe in tears / Москва слезам не верит, The Irony of Fate / Ирония судьбы..., White Sun of the Desert / Белое солнце пустыни etc.) or unorthodox modern Russian films (like Silent Souls / The Buntings / Овсянки, The Return / Возвращение etc.)\n\nSo if you have Russian-speaking friends you are comfortable with to try it, I would definitely recommend it, you'll be amazed how much you were missing watching the same films by yourself.\n\nMy pick: the film Heart of a Dog / Собачье сердце (1988) based on Bulgakov's novel of the same name, but I'm afraid you are going to need some comments watching it, otherwise most of the \"written between the lines\" might be missed."
