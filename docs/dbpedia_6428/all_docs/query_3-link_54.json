        "text": "No, this isn't an unofficial remake of 10,000 B.C., it's Swedish filmmaker Lukas Moodysson's latest feature film. Mammoth is an English language drama starring Michelle Williams and Gael García Bernal as a married couple. Similar to Alejandro González Iñárritu's Babel, Mammoth explores the connection between three people in three different places. Tom (Bernal) heads on a business trip to Thailand where he tries to radically change his life; Allison (Williams), his wife, lives in New York and struggles to spend time with their daughter and deal with their live-in Filipino maid; and lastly, their maid's family and her two kids struggle with her absence in the Philippines. Our friend Eric at IONCINEMA.com predicted that this would premiere at Sundance in January. After this trailer, I hope it does, because I really want to check it out.\n\nWatch the official trailer for Lukas Moodysson's Mammoth from YouTube:\n\nMammoth is both written and directed by Swedish filmmaker Lukas Moodysson of Together, A Hole in My Heart, and Container previously. With fellow Swedish director Tomas Alfredson's vampire film Let the Right One In being heralded as one of the best films of the year, it would be great to see more unknown Swedish directors get some attention as well. Mammoth is set to debut in Sweden and other European countries early next year, but doesn't have a US distributor just yet. We're crossing our fingers and hoping that Mammoth will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January - stay tuned. How does that look?"
