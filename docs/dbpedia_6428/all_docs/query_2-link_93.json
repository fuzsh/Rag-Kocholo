        "text": "This is the latest reproduction of email exchanges between two American friends living apart. This time they disagree on their topic of choice; the film Lilya 4-Ever by director Lukas Moodysson. Lindsay saw the film in London on Tuesday 29th April as part of the Womenâ€™s Library film and debate at the Barbican Centre. Francesca Levy saw the film on 15th May, at Cinema Village, in New York City.\n\nFrancesca Levy and Lindsay are clearly bored with their jobs and would happily accept a living wage for their feminist film critiques."
