EchoStar Announces Agreement to Acquire Sling Media, Inc.

Combination Will Create Industry-Leading Digital Media Solutions Provider

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. and FOSTER CITY, Calif., September 24, 2007 –

EchoStar Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: DISH) announced today

that it has agreed to acquire Sling Media, Inc., a privately-held

digital lifestyle products company. EchoStar, through its DISH

Network(r), is the third largest pay-TV provider in the United States.

The transaction values Sling Media at approximately $380 million and

is payable in cash and EchoStar options. The transaction is subject to

customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the fourth

quarter of 2007.

Established in 2004, Sling Media has been a leading innovator in the

digital lifestyle space through the introduction of the

internationally-acclaimed, Emmy award-winning Slingbox and

SlingPlayer software. Sling Media’s product line is distributed in

over 5,000 retail stores in 11 countries.

In 2006, Sling Media created the Sling Entertainment Group with the

mission of developing entertainment experiences and business models

that reach beyond the Slingbox. The group also fosters and manages

relationships with content creators and owners. Its first initiative,

Clip+Sling , dramatically changes the way consumers socialize around

TV by enabling users to clip and share limited segments of their

favorite television programming.

“As an early investor in Sling Media, EchoStar has been pleased with

the progress and commitment the company has made establishing Sling

Media and the Slingbox as powerful and beloved digital media brands,”

said Charlie Ergen, CEO and co-founder of EchoStar. “With today’s

increasingly mobile lifestyle, EchoStar’s acquisition of Sling Media

will allow us to offer innovative and convenient ways for our

customers to enjoy their programming on more displays and locations,

including TVs, computers and mobile phones, both inside and outside of

the home. This combination paves the way for the development of a host

of new innovative products and services for our subscribers, new

digital media consumers and strategic partners.”
