        "text": "Global satellite services provider\n\nEchoStar Corporation is an American company providing satellite communication and Internet services. Its Hughes Network Systems and EchoStar Satellite Services business are operated from its headquarters in Arapahoe County, Colorado. The company also provides television services under the Dish and Sling brands as well as mobile services under the Boost Mobile brand.\n\nThe company in its current form was founded in 2008 after the original EchoStar spun off its non-consumer assets while the original company was renamed to Dish Network Corporation. In an industry reverse, Echostar proposed to buy Dish in 2023 with the acquisition being completed by the end of that year, as a result, Dish was absorbed into EchoStar as a whole.[2]\n\nEchoStar made its debut on the Fortune 500 list in 2024, ranking #242.[3]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nEchoStar was originally formed in 1980 by its chairman Charles Ergen as a distributor of C band TV systems. In 1987, it applied for a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) license with the Federal Communications Commission and was granted access to orbital slot 119° west longitude in 1992.\n\nOn December 28, 1995, the firm successfully launched its first satellite, EchoStar I.[4] On March 4, 1996, it established the DISH Network brand name to market its home satellite TV system.[5]\n\nOn January 2, 2008, the DISH Network business was demerged from the technology and infrastructure side of the business. A split in the shares created two companies; the former EchoStar Communications Corporation changed its name to DISH Network Corporation[6] which consisted mainly of the DISH Network business, and EchoStar Corporation, which retained ownership of the technology side including the satellites, Sling Media, and the set-top box development arm. DISH Network completed its distribution to EchoStar of its digital set-top box business, certain infrastructure, and other assets and related liabilities, including certain of their satellites, uplink and satellite transmission assets, and real estate (the \"Spin-off\"). Since the spin-off, EchoStar and DISH Network have operated as separate publicly traded companies, until they were reunited in 2023.[7] In addition, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of DISH Network and EchoStar is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, Chairman, and by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.\n\nOn February 14, 2011, EchoStar announced that it would acquire Hughes Communications in a deal valued at US$1.3 billion.[8]\n\nOn January 31, 2017, EchoStar announced that it had reached an agreement with DISH to transfer the EchoStar Technologies businesses, which designed, developed and distributed digital set-top boxes, provided satellite uplinking and broadcast services and developed and supported streaming video technology back to DISH.[9] The transaction was completed on January 31, 2017,[10] substantially returning DISH to its pre-2008 status as a set-top-box hardware manufacturer.\n\nIn March 2017, after two delays caused by weather worries, SpaceX delivered EchoStar XXIII into orbit. The satellite was launched on a Falcon 9 Rocket and provides broadcast services for Brazil.[11] Because EchoStar XXIII is a heavy satellite, this mission did not include a rocket landing post-takeoff, as it would require too much fuel. This was the first time a purely commercial satellite was launched from a pad that once served as the base for Apollo moon trips and space shuttle flights.[12][13]\n\nOn May 20, 2019, EchoStar announced[9] that it had reached an agreement with DISH Network Corporation to transfer the portion of the business which managed and provided broadcast satellite services, referred to as the BSS (Broadcast Satellite Services) business, to DISH in order to concentrate on broadband services and other initiatives. The transaction was completed on September 10, 2019.[14]\n\nOn August 8, 2023, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Ergen was proposing a remerger between Dish and EchoStar.[15] Later that day, the acquisition was formally announced by both companies.[16] On January 2, 2024, it was announced that the transaction had been completed on December 31, 2023.[17][18]\n\nIn May 2024, EchoStar announced that it has been awarded a U.S. Navy Wireless and Telecommunications Contract to Provide 5G Smart Devices and Services for the Department of Defense and Federal Agencies.[19]\n\nIn May 2024, Dish Network and Hughes Network Systems, both Echostar companies announced a new bundled service of Dish satellite TV with Hughesnet satellite internet.[20]\n\nSatellite fleet[edit]\n\nOrbital locations may change\n\nSince EchoStar frequently moves satellites among its many orbiting slots this list is not necessarily up-to-date.\n\nEchoStar satellites Satellite Location Launch date Launcher Satellite bus Status EchoStar I December 28, 1995 Long March 2E/EPKM Decommissioned EchoStar II September 11, 1996 Ariane 42P H10-3 Decommissioned EchoStar III (DBSC 1) October 05, 1997 Atlas IIAS Decommissioned EchoStar IV May 07, 1998 Proton-K/DM-03 Decommissioned EchoStar V September 23, 1999 Atlas IIAS Decommissioned EchoStar VI July 14, 2000 Atlas IIAS Decommissioned EchoStar VII February 21, 2002 Atlas IIIB-DEC Decommissioned EchoStar VIII August 22, 2002 Proton-K/DM-03 Decommissioned EchoStar IX (Galaxy 23) 121° W August 8, 2003 Zenit-3SL FS-1300 In Service EchoStar X 110° W February 15, 2006 Zenit-3SL A2100AXS In Service EchoStar XI July 16, 2008 Zenit-3SL In Service EchoStar XII (Rainbow 1) July 17, 2003 Atlas V521 In Service EchoStar XIII (CMBstar 1) - Proton-M/Briz-M Cancelled EchoStar XIV March 20, 2010 Proton-M/Briz-M In Service EchoStar XV 61.5° W July 10, 2010 Proton-M/Briz-M LS-1300 In Service EchoStar XVI 61.5° W November 20, 2012 Proton-M/Briz-M LS-1300 In Service EchoStar XVII (Jupiter 1) 107.0° W July 5, 2012 Ariane 5 LS-1300 In Service EchoStar XVIII June 18, 2016 Ariane 5ECA In Service EchoStar XIX (Jupiter 2) 97.1° W December 18, 2016 Atlas V431 SSL 1300 In Service EchoStar XXIII 109.9° W March 16, 2017 Falcon 9 SSL 1300 In Service EchoStar XXIV (Jupiter 3) 105.2° W July 29, 2023 Falcon Heavy SSL 1300 In Service EchoStar XXV TBA TBA Planned EchoStar 105 (SES-11) 105.0° W October 11, 2017 Falcon 9 Eurostar E3000 In Service"
