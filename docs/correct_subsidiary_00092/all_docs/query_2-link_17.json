        "text": "FOSTER CITY, Calif., July 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Sling Media Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of EchoStar Corp. (NASDAQ: SATS), today announced the release of the Slingbox® M2 — a new entertainment experience designed to meet the ongoing shift in consumers' television viewing habits. With the Slingbox M2 bundle, today's ultra-connected generation will have uncompromised access to their live and recorded home TV content from anywhere on their personal computers, tablets and smartphones without the previous cost-by-device barrier.\n\nAccording to the 2014 Ericsson Mobility Report, the average household has at least five connected devices. The Slingbox M2 accommodates this growing household trend by empowering consumers with the ability to download the Slingplayer app to view their home TV content on an unlimited number of devices at no additional cost. By connecting to a cable or satellite box, the Slingbox M2 turns consumers' preferred mobile devices into a convenient entertainment companion—perfect for on-the-go use while traveling domestically or abroad, or to catch up on content between daily errands.\n\n\"Consumer media consumption is evolving at a faster rate than ever before. The new Slingbox M2 experience enables people to enjoy the live and recorded TV content they care most about, whether that's seeing who makes the game-winning play or catching a cliffhanger season finale. Now anyone can stay connected to their local news, events and sports, even if they're miles away from their home,\" says Michael Hawkey, senior vice president and general manager of Sling Media. \"Our customers have been asking us to eliminate the cost of downloading the app for every mobile device that they own. The Slingbox M2 bundle addresses this request by providing a no-compromise entertainment experience across a variety of touch points, allowing users to view what they're paying for at home from anywhere in the world—and on their own terms.\"\n\nTo further enhance the customer experience, the Slingbox M2 comes with a complimentary live video setup service available after the purchase of the product to improve ease of installation and use. Additionally, the Slingplayer app includes free upgrades for the lifecycle of all new Slingbox models and later this year, Sling Media will release usability enhancements to the app, including video quality improvements and a gallery viewing mode on iPhone and Android phones, similar to what is available on the iPad. The unlimited free app downloads are supported by seamlessly integrated ad spots, ensuring customers can leverage their Slingbox M2 on compatible media devices in their household while still enjoying an excellent viewing experience.\n\nIn addition to enhancing the value of consumers' existing cable or satellite subscriptions, Slingbox M2 users who have Apple TV®, Chromecast®, Fire TV® or Roku®* can use these services to shift content from their mobile devices to a second TV anywhere in the world that has an Internet connection.\n\nKey benefits of the Slingbox M2 include:\n\nWatch and control live TV on a tablet**, smartphone**, PC or Mac\n\nAccess to 100% of your cable or satellite channel subscription\n\nPlay and schedule all of your DVR recordings\n\nQuick setup and playback via PC/Mac desktop apps, as well as iPhone, iPad and Android phone apps\n\nWiFi connectivity and Ethernet port for simple network setup\n\nHigh-definition video up to 1080p\n\nAbsolutely no monthly fees\n\nThe Slingbox M2 suggested retail price (MSRP) is $199.99 and is available immediately for purchase at leading retailers including Best Buy and Amazon Marketplace, as well as at www.slingbox.com.
