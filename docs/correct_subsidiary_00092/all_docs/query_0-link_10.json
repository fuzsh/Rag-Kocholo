        "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Jan. 8, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- EchoStar Corp. (NASDAQ: SATS), a leading global satellite services provider and developer of hybrid video delivery technologies, today announced its subsidiary Sling Media has filed a lawsuit against two companies in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging infringement of five Sling Media patents.\n\nThe civil complaint names Monsoon Multimedia Inc. of San Mateo, CA. and Belkin International Inc. of Los Angeles. Sling Media alleges that products sold by the two California companies infringe proprietary Sling technology used to power the segment-leading Slingbox product family. Using Slingbox, consumers have the ability to watch and control content placeshifted from their living room TVs at any time, to any location, using Internet-connected PCs, Macs, tablets and smartphones.\n\nSpecifically, the suit alleges that Monsoon and Belkin infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,725,912, \"Method for Implementing a Remote Display System with Transcoding;\" 7,877,776, \"Personal Media Broadcasting System;\" 8,051,454, \"Personal Media Broadcasting System with Output Buffer;\" 8,060,909, \"Personal Media Broadcasting System;\" and 8,266,657, \"Method for Effectively Implementing a Multi-Room Television System.\"\n\nEchoStar is a pioneer of the \"TV Everywhere\" trend. Sling Media launched the Slingbox in 2005, and completely refreshed the product family with the new Slingbox 350 and 500 models in 2012.
