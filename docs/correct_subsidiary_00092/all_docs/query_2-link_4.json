        "text": "·\n\nCross officerships, directorships and stock ownership. We will continue to have significant overlap in directors and executive officers with DISH Network, which may lead to conflicting interests. Certain of our executive officers, including Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, also serve as executive officers of DISH Network. Three of these individuals provide us services pursuant to a management services agreement we will enter into with DISH Network. Our board of directors will include persons who are members of the board of directors of DISH Network, including Mr. Ergen, who will serve as the Chairman of DISH Network and us. The executive officers and the members of our board of directors who overlap with DISH Network have fiduciary duties to DISH Network’s shareholders. Pursuant to the management services agreement, three of these officers will be paid by DISH Network even if their duties include work for EchoStar. Therefore, these individuals may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. For example, there will be the potential for a conflict of interest when we or DISH Network look at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both companies. In addition, many of our directors and officers own DISH Network stock and options to purchase DISH Network stock, which they acquired or were granted prior to the Spin-off, including Mr. Ergen, who beneficially owns approximately 50.0% of the total equity and control approximately 80.0% of the voting power of DISH Network and us. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and DISH Network."
