It will be interesting to see how this plays out and I imagine that DISH Network subscribers will see the first benefits of this acquisition with some added functionality to their system.\n\nI do have several questions and am sure they will be answered in time as the purchase details are worked out. Will there be a separate Slingbox division of EchoStar? How will the Slingbox hardware be sold (independently, only through DISH Network, etc)? Can we still expect continued mobile clients from Sling Media (SlingPlayer Mobile for S60 devices)?\n\nCongratulations to all the awesome people at Sling Media and I wish you the best as you move forward with EchoStar."
