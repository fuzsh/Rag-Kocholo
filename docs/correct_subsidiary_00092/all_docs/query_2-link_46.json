        "text": "The global satellite technology provider, EchoStar, and the U.S. satellite TV provider, DISH, choose NAGRA for its ability to deliver a turnkey solution to further drive their broad multiscreen strategy\n\nThe NAGRA solution consists of a secure media player with DECE-approved NAGRA MediaAccess PRM digital rights management\n\nCheseaux, Switzerland and Englewood, Colo., - April 16, 2014 – NAGRA, the Kudelski Group’s (SIX:KUD.S) digital TV business and the world’s leading independent provider of content protection and multiscreen television solutions, announced it has further extended its security partnership with DISH Network L.L.C (“DISH”) and EchoStar Technologies L.L.C. (“EchoStar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of EchoStar Corporation. Working together, DISH and EchoStar have deployed the NAGRA MediaLive Player (NMP) with NAGRA’s DECE-approved MediaAccess Persistent Rights Management (PRM) technology, NAGRA’s studio-approved DRM solution, to enable and secure the DISH Anywhere™ multiscreen video-on-demand service, which provides premium content to computers, smartphones and tablets.\n\n“More and more consumers are demanding greater flexibility in the way they enjoy their DISH content,” said Vivek Khemka, DISH Senior Vice President of Product Management. “To successfully provide this service, we chose the NAGRA MediaLive Player with PRM because of their proven ability to effectively protect our content investment while at the same time meeting the requirements of our premium content providers. What’s more, our close security partnership with NAGRA allows us to focus on creating innovative new services.”\n\nEchoStar developed the popular and award-winning whole-home solution deployed by DISH to service its customers. This includes the Hopper® Whole-Home HD DVR, the Joey® client options, which extends the Hopper functionalities to additional rooms; and Sling® placeshifting technology, which enables Hopper content to be viewed anywhere from a mobile device.\n\n“While providing consumers with the best possible viewing experience, both inside and outside the home, we recognize the need of content creators to protect their rights. NAGRA’s solutions will add an extra layer of security to protect those rights,” said Mark Jackson, President, EchoStar Technologies.\n\n“DISH Network and EchoStar are leading the way in providing consumers with cutting edge services that help win new customers and retain existing ones,” said Pierre Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Executive President, NAGRA. “Content has to be secured throughout the entire ecosystem, whether on the set-top box, personal computers, smartphones or tablets. With the NAGRA Media Player and our studio-grade PRM, service providers can have the peace of mind that their premium content is secure on any device and gives them a rich set of features that will keep their subscribers coming back for more.”\n\nNAGRA Media Player with PRM technology can be implemented on any device to give service providers a truly operator-controlled DRM functionality they can use to support a wide variety of use cases and business models.\n\nNAGRA MediaAccess PRM currently protects DISH’s Hopper Transfers™ feature within the DISH Anywhere app, which allows users of the Hopper® with Sling® Whole-Home HD DVR to transfer their favorite recorded content to any device for offline, “on-the-go” viewing. What’s more, the solution was recently added to the Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem’s (DECE) list of approved DRMs for the delivery of premium content to open devices like smartphones, tablets and PC’s. NAGRA MediaAccess PRM is independent of the conditional access system (CAS) and can be deployed as a standalone component.\n\nAbout NAGRA\n\nNAGRA, the digital TV division of the Kudelski Group (SIX:KUD.S), provides security and multiscreen user experience solutions for the monetization of digital media.
