EchoStar, through\n\nits DISH Network, is the third largest pay-TV provider in the\n\nUnited States.\n\nThe transaction values Sling Media at approximately $380 million and is payable\n\nin cash and EchoStar options. The transaction is subject to customary closing\n\nconditions, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007.\n\nEstablished\n\nin 2004, Sling Media has been a innovator in the digital lifestyle\n\nspace through the introduction of the internationally-acclaimed, Emmy\n\naward-winning Slingbox and SlingPlayer software. Sling Media’s product line\n\nis distributed in over 5,000 retail stores in 11 countries.\n\nIn 2006,\n\nSling Media created the Sling Entertainment Group with the mission of\n\ndeveloping entertainment experiences and business models that reach beyond the\n\nSlingbox. The group also fosters and manages relationships with content\n\ncreators and owners. Its first initiative, Clip+Sling, dramatically changes\n\nthe way consumers socialize around TV by enabling users to clip and share\n\nlimited segments of their favorite television programming.\n\n“As an\n\nearly investor in Sling Media, EchoStar has been pleased with the progress and\n\ncommitment the company has made establishing Sling Media and the Slingbox as\n\npowerful and beloved digital media brands,” said Charlie Ergen, CEO and\n\nco-founder of EchoStar. “With today’s increasingly mobile lifestyle, EchoStar’s\n\nacquisition of Sling Media will allow us to offer innovative and convenient\n\nways for our customers to enjoy their programming on more displays and\n\nlocations, including TVs, computers and mobile phones, both inside and outside\n\nof the home. This combination paves the way for the development of a host of\n\nnew innovative products and services for our subscribers, new digital media\n\nconsumers and strategic partners.”"
