        "text": "The Corrupt Supreme Court Makes A Reckless Mess Of Broadband Consumer Protection (And Everything Else)\n\nLegal Issues\n\nfrom the look-kids,-we're-dismantling-the-federal-government dept\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a recent ruling that could take an absolute wrecking ball to everything from consumer protection and environmental reform to public safety. It was a ruling that dismantled decades of precedent and puts nearly all regulatory enforcement efforts at risk, yet it somehow barely warranted much coverage by a largely disinterested, billionaire-owned U.S. press.\n\nIt’s being sold as some sort of noble, good faith rebalancing of power by industry, but the Loper Bright v. Raimondo ruling eliminates Chevron deference and upends the major questions doctrine, which, in many instances, risks turning U.S. regulators into the legal and policy equivalent of decorative gourds.\n\nChevron deference delegated independent regulators (often with detailed subject matter expertise Congress doesn’t have) the authority to craft policy (and sometimes new rules) provided they were within the reasonable confines of the law. The Loper ruling strips that authority away, leaving many policy determinations in the hands of an increasingly corrupt, and increasingly extremist, court.\n\nFrom Feckless Mush To Something Much, Much Worse\n\nYou can already routinely see how hard it is for a U.S. regulator like the FCC, whose domain is telecom and (some) media, to pass even fairly-feckless policy choices without them being sued into oblivion. Even in instances where they’re clearly acting within their Congressional mandate.\n\nYou saw it with net neutrality and consumer privacy. You see it with their fairly basic effort to rein in broadband discrimination. Even efforts to make ISPs clear about their pricing have seen bottomless legal challenge by a telecom industry incessantly trying to claim regulators have zero authority whatsoever to do anything to protect American consumers under the law.\n\nAll enforcement and reform is much, much harder now. Every policy and reform effort by regulators (even long established) will now be challenged anew, flooding the courts with numerous new contentious debates once believed somewhat settled. And it’s going to impact everything you deal with on a daily basis, from the quality of your local drinking water to your local labor protections.\n\nIn broadband land, efforts like net neutrality are at particular risk. In part because the Communications Act of 1934 was particularly murky in terms of the width and breadth of FCC authority. We’d settled much of that over the decades with various legal fights from Brand X to several rounds of net neutrality fights; fights that, more often than not, already routinely came down on the side of telecom giants.\n\nBut even the existing corrupt, feckless mess that passes for coherent consumer protection in telecom is about to be upended by a Republican minority. An unelected minority keen on dismantling the regulatory state on behalf of corporations looking to eliminate most, if not all, meaningful oversight.\n\nUniversity of Colorado Professor Blake Reid has an excellent post exploring how the Loper ruling could send broadband consumer protection into complete disarray with the dismantling of decades of precedent. His wager, which is likely the right one, is that the court (historically in lockstep with AT&T and Comcast) will simply declare the FCC lacks all consumer protection authority:\n\n“The easy money is that the Court’s conservative majority (including then-Judge Kavanaugh, who wrote a blistering dissent against an earlier iteration of the rules in USTA v. FCC), will simply rule that Title II of the ‘34 Act does not apply to ISPs. This result would obliterate the Damoclean pendulum of rules that has more or less kept ISPs in check over the last two decades and make it clear that America’s oft-reviled ISPs have free rein to, um, dutifully serve their customers.”\n\nAs Blake notes there are some bright spots.\n\nThe legal debates over FCC authority are so extensive and tortured that a court looking to dismantle FCC authority has to trample many of their own past determinations to fit a square peg into a round hole, which could provide ample legal opportunities for those challenging the dismantling of the regulatory state. There’s also the fact that the courts have repeatedly declared that states have the right to protect broadband consumers (and net neutrality) if the feds won’t.\n\nSo we’re not doomed. And people should not give up hope. But in my opinion, informed by 25 years of studying and writing about U.S. consumer protection, it’s very, very, very bad.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in corrupt fealty to large corporations, simply decided it would be fun to throw several large grenades into the belly of what’s left of semi-coherent U.S. federal policy governance. But if you read the insights of folks like the American Enterprise Institute’s Daniel Lyons, they’ll try to tell you it’s all for the greater good:\n\n“By overturning Chevron, the Court hopes to shift the locus of legislative decision making back to Congress, where it belongs. There are significant benefits to shifting important, politically sensitive issues from agencies to Congress. It increases political accountability by placing key decisions in the hands of directly elected officials. And the legislative process makes more room for bipartisan compromise, assuring more gradual but more lasting change supported by a broader swath of the political spectrum.”\n\nThis pretty common framing of the ruling teeters somewhere between delusion and lying. Corporations didn’t lobby the unelected Supreme Court because they were just super concerned about the balance of policy power among “unelected bureaucrats.” They did it because they know they’ve already lobbied Congress into absolute, corrupt dysfunction on nearly all meaningful reform and corporate oversight. Now they’re taking aim at the already shaky authority of U.S. regulators.\n\nAll during the net neutrality debate you saw some variation of the claim that “if we want net neutrality protections, Congress should just pass a law.” This was usually made by companies like AT&T who know full well they’ve ensured that Congress is a corrupt, feckless mess. Now they’ve ensured regulators often can’t implement reforms without the explicit instruction of a Congress too corrupt to function.\n\nThis is not a good faith effort at meaningful reform of policy power, and you don’t drop rulings like this the Friday before a major holiday because you’re proudly attempting to serve the public interest.\n\nOnce corporate America has the federal regulatory state handcuffed and neutered, they’ll shift their collective attention and resources toward undermining state rights. This is the culmination of a 50+ year Republican effort to dismantle coherent federal corporate oversight and accountability. All fights, on everything, are now local. And which state you currently live in matters more than ever.\n\nThe goal isn’t some noble defense of freedom or constitutional balance. The goal is legal gridlock for all meaningful reform. The goal is near-zero meaningful oversight of giant corporations. And there are decades upon decades of evidence as to precisely how that’s going to go for everybody without a seven figure lobbying budget.\n\nAnd again, we’re not just talking about telecom or your expensive broadband bill. We’re talking about entirely new, bottomless legal fights over every last regulatory policy that impacts your everyday life. Every reform and every effort by every regulator governing every sector in the U.S. is going to be inundated with lawsuits by corporations claiming regulators lack the authority to do anything they view as detrimental to their goal of improved quarterly returns.\n\nThis intentional fracturing of coherent federal regulatory authority also comes as we collectively face unprecedented chaos caused by a destabilizing climate that’s only just getting started.\n\nI’m not sure the impact and scope of this ruling is even calculable. And I don’t think the folks saying things like “this can’t possibly be that bad” or “the impact of dismantling Chevron is being overstated” fully understand precisely what we’re talking about just yet. Fortunately for them, the impacts over the next five to ten years won’t be subtle, so the learning opportunities should prove limitless.\n\nFiled Under: chevron, chevron deference, corruption, general questions, loper, regulators, supreme court\n\nBig Telecom Again Takes Net Neutrality To Court, But Faces Long Odds\n\nBroadband\n\nfrom the here-we-go-again dept\n\nBack in April the Biden FCC finally got around to restoring both net neutrality rules, and the agency’s Title II authority over telecom providers. The modest rules, as we’ve covered extensively, prevent big telecom giants from abusing their monopoly and gatekeeper power to harm competitors or consumers. They also require that ISPs be transparent about what kind of network management they use.\n\nContrary to a lot of industry and right wing bullshit, the rules don’t hurt broadband investment and they’re not some “radical government overreach.” They’re some very basic guidelines proposed by an agency that under both parties is generally too feckless to stand up to industry.\n\nBut big telecom giants like AT&T and Comcast have unsurprisingly challenged the rules once again in the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, Eleventh Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit as they seek a lucky lottery draw. At the same time, they’ve filed a petition asking the FCC to pause the rules (set to take effect July 22), claiming (falsely, as it turns out) that the agency’s decision was illegal (all consumer protection efforts are illegal if you’re ignorant enough to ask an AT&T or Comcast lawyer’s opinion about it).\n\nBig ISPs, as usual, insist that if net neutrality is to be addressed, it should be done by Congress:\n\n“The good news is that the FCC’s action will be overturned in court. Congress has always been the appropriate forum to resolve these issues.”\n\nTelecom lobbyists, which spend an estimated $320,000 every day lobbying Congress, enjoy making this claim hoping you’re too daft to realize that Congress has long been too corrupted by corporate influence to do this (or much of anything else on consumer protection or consumer privacy). They know they have Congress in their pockets, and they’re obviously working hard on the courts.\n\nUnfortunately for big ISPs, legal history hasn’t been in their favor. This particular debate has wound through the legal system several times now, and each time the courts have ruled that the FCC has the legal right to reclassify broadband and impose net neutrality under the Telecom Act — provided they provide hard data supporting their decisions.\n\nBig ISPs, like most corporations seeking an accountability-free policy environment, are hoping that the right wing Supreme Court’s looming attack on regulatory independence results in the rules being killed. But that’s no guarantee, given the FCC’s authority over telecoms has been more roundly tested via legal precedent than a lot of other regulatory disputes.\n\nEven if telecom giants like AT&T land a corrupted judge willing to overlook all functional legal precedent and foundational reason (which happens a lot these days), they’re in a terrible position to try and stop states from stepping in to fill the void.\n\nWhen the Trump FCC killed net neutrality in 2017, the tried to simultaneously ban states from stepping in to protect broadband consumers. But the courts have ruled repeatedly that the federal government can’t abdicate its authority over broadband consumer protection, then tell states what to do.\n\nSo if big telecom and the Trumplican courts once again kill FCC net neutrality protections, the groundwork is set for states (many of which already have passed laws) to once again fill the consumer protection void.\n\nAs the longstanding corporate and right wing legal assault on federal regulatory oversight culminates in Supreme Court “victory,” you’re going to see some variation of this play out across numerous fronts. Except unlike in telecom, a lot of the disputes will be of the life and death variety.\n\nThe goal is to effectively lobotomize all federal oversight of corporate America, bogging down absolutely any federal reform effort down in a perpetual legal quagmire. The stakes of that across labor, consumer protection, public safety, and the environment are profound and boundless, but for whatever reason, large segments of the press and public still haven’t quite figured out what’s coming.\n\nFiled Under: chevron, consumer protection, net neutrality, regulators, telecom\n\nDish Network, The Trump Era ‘Fix’ For The Sprint T-Mobile Merger, Heads Into Its Final Death Spiral\n\nFailures\n\nfrom the pointless-distraction dept\n\nAging satellite TV provider Dish Network is supposed to be undergoing a major transformation from tired old satellite TV provider to streaming and wireless juggernaut. It was a cornerstone of a Trump administration FCC and DOJ plan to cobble together a new wireless carrier out of twine and vibes as a counter-balance to the competition-eroding T-Mobile and Sprint merger.\n\nIt’s… not going well. All of the problems critics of the T-Mobile and Sprint merger predicted (layoffs, price hikes, lest robust competition) have come true. Meanwhile Dish has been bleeding satellite TV, wireless, and streaming TV subscribers for a while (last quarter the company lost another 314,000 TV subscribers, including 249,000 satellite TV subs and 65,000 Sling TV customers).\n\nDish’s new 5G network has also generally been received as a sort of half-hearted joke. Dish also lost 123,000 prepaid wireless subscribers last quarter; it can’t pay its debt obligations, can’t afford to buy the spectrum it was supposed to acquire as part of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger arrangement; and expanding its half-cooked 5G network looks tenuous at best.\n\nLast year Dish proposed merging with Echostar in a bid to distract everybody from the company’s ongoing mess. They’ve also tried to goose stock valuations by hinting at an equally doomed merger with DirecTV. But those distractions didn’t help either, and there are increasing worries among belatedly aware analysts that this all ends with bankruptcy and a pile of rubble:\n\n“MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett offered a blunt assessment of the company’s future based on Dish’s deteriorating pay-TV and mobile subscriber customer base: “Dish’s business is spiraling towards bankruptcy. Gradually, then all at once, the declines are gathering speed,” he wrote in a research note.”\n\nFrom 2019 or so I noted that this whole mess was likely a doomed effort, primarily designed to provide cover for an anti-competitive, job-killing wireless merger. It always seemed likely to me that Dish (which had never built a wireless network) would string FCC regulators along for a few years before selling off its valuable spectrum assets and whatever half-assed 5G network it had managed to construct.\n\nDespite this, trade magazines that cover the telecom industry tried desperately to pretend this was all a very serious adult venture, despite zero indication anyone involved had any idea what they were doing. And the deal rubber stamping and circular logic used to justify it ran in very stark contrast to the ongoing pretense that we supposedly care about “antitrust reform.”\n\nUltimately Dish will make a killing on spectrum, the FCC will fine them a relative pittance for failing to meet the flimsy build requirements affixed to the merger conditions, and Dish CEO Charlie Ergen will trot off into the sunset on a giant pile of money. Some giant player like Verizon will then swoop in to gobble up what’s left of the wreckage, and the industry will consolidate further (the whole point)\n\nThe regulatory impact of approving Sprint/T-Mobile, which consolidated the U.S. wireless market from four to three major providers (jacking up prices and killing off thousands of jobs), will be forgotten, and the regulators and officials behind the entire mess will have long ago moved on to other terrible, short-sighted ideas.\n\nFiled Under: 5g, antitrust, competition, fcc, job cuts, john legere, regulators, telecom, wireless\n\nCompanies: dish\n\nDumb, Telecom Industry Backed ‘Network Fees’ Drive Twitch Out Of Korea\n\nBroadband\n\nfrom the please-pay-me-extra-for-no-coherent-reason dept\n\nTwitch has announced that the company is shutting down in Korea after regulators there imposed a ridiculous new regulatory framework that drove the company’s operational costs through the roof.\n\nBasically: Korean telecoms convinced gullible regulators to pass a new regulatory framework wherein edge providers and content companies are forced to pay telecoms additional fees just to have their traffic successfully reach its destination (consumers). It’s in addition to bandwidth costs, and, as we’ve pointed out for a while, it’s a dumb cash grab and the latest extension of the longstanding net neutrality wars.\n\nIn a blog post, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy explains that with the addition of these new mandated network fees, the company has found it impossible to turn a profit in Korea and has been forced to close up shop:\n\n“Ultimately, the cost to operate Twitch in Korea is prohibitively expensive and we have spent significant effort working to reduce these costs so that we could find a way for the Twitch business to remain in Korea. First, we experimented with a peer-to-peer model for source quality. Then, we adjusted source quality to a maximum of 720p. While we have lowered costs from these efforts, our network fees in Korea are still 10 times more expensive than in most other countries. Twitch has been operating in Korea at a significant loss, and unfortunately there is no pathway forward for our business to run more sustainably in that country.”\n\nFor the better part of the last few decades, global telecom giants have been trying to “double dip.” As in, not only do they charge businesses and consumers an arm and a leg for (often terrible) broadband, but they’ve been trying very hard to institute new regulatory frameworks where consumer and content companies alike pay telecoms huge sums of additional money for no coherent reason.\n\nThis idea that big ISPs are inherently owed a cut of the revenues of services traveling over their networks is what launched the net neutrality wars around the world several decades ago, when AT&T insisted Google “wouldn’t ride our pipes for free.” It’s evolved in dumber and dumber ways ever since.\n\nUnder Korea’s model, edge providers (like Netflix) are forced to pay “network service fees” to ISPs. Basically, ISPs there have claimed that they’re inherently owed more money if a TV show on Netflix is super popular, claiming they should be compensated for extra bandwidth costs.\n\nOf course, bandwidth provisioning doesn’t really work like that. ISPs are supposed to build networks that can handle any peak capacity spikes caused by normal consumer demand. The origins of those demands are irrelevant. Consumers and edge providers have already paid an arm and a leg for bandwidth, particularly if regional monopolization has driven down any incentive to compete on price.\n\nAll they’re really doing here is trying to offload network operations and maintenance costs to someone else. In this case: Korean game streamers or Netflix users.\n\nDemanding that popular companies pay more to telecoms just for being popular is an inherently stupid idea, but it’s been dressed up by telecom lobbyists as serious adult policy under terms such as “sender pays” or sometimes “Sending Party Network Pays” (SPNP). I’ve been dumbfounded by how these proposals have been treated as serious policy.\n\nThe efforts always begin with false claims that companies like Google and Netflix are somehow “getting a free ride” on the internet, despite spending billions in bandwidth, CDNs, undersea cables, and cloud infrastructure. From there, they usually involve some flavor of false claim that this model will help expand broadband availability to those in need. But its only real function is to fatten telecoms’ purses.\n\nLike many countries, Korean regulators largely favor just three big major ISPs, which then influence policy determinations to an extremely lopsided degree. This muted competition, combined with regulatory capture, plus the SPNP model, has driven up costs for Korean consumers (see Michael Nelson’s good 2021 piece on this, or this 2022 Techdirt story by Konstantinos Komaitis).\n\nNow, regulatory capture is driving edge companies out of business, and driving up both bandwidth and content costs for consumers. It’s all predatory nonsense created by regulatory capture and corruption, and the telecom policy marionettes pushing the idea aren’t operating in good faith. They’ve hijacked regulators to implement systems that deliver telecoms billions of additional dollars for doing nothing.\n\nAnd if you think this is only happening in Korea, it’s not. It’s been an ongoing debate in the EU, where telecoms have floated a direct tax on any company that accounts for more than 5 percent of a telco’s average peak traffic. Here in the States, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr (R, AT&T) has been a big proponent of the idea for several years now.\n\nAgain, it’s basically telecoms trying to get paid twice for the same (often substandard) service. That it has been dressed up as a serious policy proposal is embarrassing. California’s net neutrality rules ban such practices, and if they’re worth anything, the FCC’s soon-to-be-restored rules will as well.\n\nFiled Under: fcc, lobbying, net neutrality, open internet, regulators, sender pays, sening party network pays, south korea, spnp, streaming, telecom\n\nCompanies: amazon, twitch\n\nDish Tries To Distract Everyone From Doomed 5G Network By Proposing Pointless Merger With Echostar\n\nFailures\n\nfrom the hey,-look-behind-you! dept\n\nWe just got done noting how Dish Network’s long-hyped 5G wireless network is likely doomed. While they’re technically building a “wireless network,” the network’s coverage, phone selection, and overall quality has proven laughable so far, and there have been growing worries that Dish is running out of cash.\n\nHoping to distract the press and regulators from this fact, Dish last week leaked word that they were considering a merger with satellite provider Echostar (spun out from Dish back in 2008).\n\nLike so many U.S. megadeals the merger is a pointless one. Dish Network is saddled with debt, on the regulatory hook for a 5G network they’ll probably never finish, and is consistently bleeding not only traditional satellite TV subscribers, but the streaming video and wireless users its pivot was supposed to have been luring in by the bucketful.\n\nDuct-taping Echostar to the side of this mess would be a giant distraction, likely result in pointless layoffs, and, outside of the stock bump and tax breaks, serves no technical function. And it generally smells like a desperation move from Dish CEO Charlie Ergen, who has a general reputation as an annoyingly and sometimes pointlessly stubborn negotiator and a bit of a cheapskate:\n\nErgen is as cautious and calculating in dealmaking as he was during his days as a professional gambler, when he was kicked out of a Lake Tahoe casino for counting cards. The sticky governance issues mean he would have to pay top dollar to get EchoStar, and he’s not known for that.\n\nYou might recall the Dish network was the Trump-era “fix” for the competitive erosion caused by the Sprint and T-Mobile merger. We noted back in 2019 that the whole thing was a doomed mess custom built by Trump-era “antitrust enforcers” as a flimsy way to justify additional industry consolidation.\n\nNow the check’s coming due. While Dish has technically met the FCC’s obligation to craft a wireless network reaching 70% of the population (concentrated in a handful of major cities), the network reach, quality, and phone selection has generally been laughed at in terms of Dish being a valid player in the wireless space.\n\nAnd it gets harder for Dish now. The next FCC-set benchmark is to reach 75 percent of the U.S. population by 2025, but that involves pushing into a lot more higher deployment cost rural and suburban markets. That’s hard to do when you’re running out of money and nobody takes your wireless play seriously (outside of a handful of telecom trade magazines whose ads and event funding rely on a cozy relationship with industry).\n\nI still suspect this all ends with Ergen selling his vast troves of spectrum holdings and half-completed network to somebody like Verizon, and the FCC doling out a tiny wrist slap (if that) for Dish missing deployment obligations. And the Trump-era regulators that birthed this turd of a plan pretending the whole thing never happened.\n\nThe collapse will result in a bunch of layoffs and consumer annoyance. But everybody high up in the chain will have gotten what they wanted, ensuring nobody learns anything. Ergen gets a big load of cash from spectrum holdings that appreciated as feckless U.S. regulators were strung along for years. AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint see less competition. And Trump-era officials got the pointless consolidation they craved.\n\nFiled Under: 5g, consolidation, fcc, megamergers, merger, regulators, telecom, trump, wireless\n\nCompanies: dish, echostar\n\nNY AG Doles Out Wrist Slap Fine To Companies That Helped Telecom Giants Use Fake And Dead People To Lie About Net Neutrality\n\nScams\n\nfrom the fake-plastic-trees dept\n\nYou might recall how when U.S. telecom giants lobbied the Trump FCC to kill net neutrality, they hired a bunch of PR firms to flood the FCC with fake comments from a bunch of fake and dead people. The goal: create the illusion of support for shitty, unpopular policies. It’s a pretty popular tactic by corporations and lobbying firms looking to influence the government and/or create the illusion of consensus.\n\nIn 2021, New York Attorney General Leticia James unveiled a report (also see accompanying statement) proving what most people already knew: the broadband industry was behind the use of fake and dead people to generate bogus support for the FCC’s controversial 2017 repeal of net neutrality. The report didn’t name any specific broadband companies and only singled out the proxy firms they used.\n\nSeveral years later, and James’ office has finally managed to dole out a wrist slap fine ($615,000) for the three PR and policy firms used by the broadband industry: LCX Digital Media, Lead ID, LLC., and Ifficient Inc. All three “lead generation” companies also worked for other companies looking to influence policies at agencies like the EPA. And not for the betterment of competent policymaking or mankind.\n\nOnce again, none of the telecom monopolies that actually hired the firms (Comcast and AT&T are often suspected to be the most active in these kinds of campaigns) are even named in the announcement, despite James likely knowing full well who paid for these “services.” In a statement, James tries to pretend that such a half-assed penalty will actually change anything:\n\n“No one should have their identity co-opted by manipulative companies and used to falsely promote a private agenda,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in an announcement Wednesday.\n\nAgain, these fake comment efforts are glorified propaganda campaigns by deep-pocketed corporations designed to provide flimsy cover for corrupt and captured regulators to make policy decisions that are opposed by a majority of Americans (the repeal of net neutrality saw widespread, bipartisan opposition).\n\nOne such effort plagued a proceeding at the Labor Department, where numerous people who either don’t exist or don’t recall ever sending messages breathlessly opposed agency efforts to prevent conflicts of interest in retirement advice. The same problem plagued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau when it proposed a rule trying to rein in some of the nastier habits of the payday lending industry.\n\nNobody in government or policy circles ever seems to show much interest in getting to the bottom of this problem. The public rarely can be bothered to care either (kudos to you if you made it this far down this article). And in the rare instance where somebody does act (like the NY AG), the fines are a tiny pittance in relation to whatever policy proposal the companies were attempting to game out.\n\nNow pause for a moment and consider how “AI” tech like ChatGPT will make these kinds of lobbying influence and propaganda campaigns cheaper and easier than ever just as we face a well-funded, deeply coordinated campaign to finally and fully defang the regulatory state once and for all.\n\nFiled Under: broadband, chevron deference, consumer rights, fake comments, fcc, letitia james, net neutrality, propaganda, regulators, trump\n\nCompanies: ifficient, lcx digital media, lead id"
