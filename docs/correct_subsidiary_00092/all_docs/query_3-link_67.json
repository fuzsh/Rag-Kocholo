        "text": "Wed 03/20/2024 06:00 AM\n\nShare this article:\n\nCredit Research: Adam Rhodes, CFA\n\nAmericas Covenants: Mitch Oates, JD\n\nSummary:\n\nIn light of EchoStar Chairman Charlie Ergen’s increased exposure to the legacy DISH Network Corp.’s, or DNC’s, operations and assets, we believe that DNC’s expected first-quarter cash burn will be funded via intercompany loans from EchoStar Corp.\n\nFollowing DNC’s purchase of manager interests in the subsidiaries that hold its AWS-3 licenses, the company could potentially look to move the licenses to the EchoStar Corp. level to raise new secured debt and/or facilitate an exchange of its 2025 and 2026 convertible notes.\n\nDespite the fourth-quarter accounting write-down of its option to purchase certain 800 MHz spectrum licenses from T-Mobile, which expires April 1, we expect that EchoStar is continuing to explore a purchase of the spectrum. Potential avenues to be pursued include a 600 MHz spectrum trade, a spectrum sale and/or private investment in public equity, or PIPE, investment at Ergen’s Conx Corp. SPAC.\n\nEchoStar Corp.’s spectrum licenses could potentially attract strategic interest from SpaceX, Amazon’s Project Kuiper or Apple, among others. Recent activity by Qualcomm demonstrates an interest in a standards-based approach to nonterrestrial networks, while recent moves by SpaceX may show a similar interest.\n\nAfter EchoStar Corp.’s execution of “strategic transactions” in January, in which it transferred tens of billions of dollars in assets across its organizational structure, and its since-terminated exchange offers, market participants are eagerly awaiting the company’s next transactions as the company faces a total of $3.9 billion in maturities before the end of 2025.\n\nOn the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call earlier this month, DISH CFO Paul Orban stated, “We are in active discussions with numerous parties to secure committed financing to meet our future obligations and have received significant inbound interest from reputable counterparties looking to provide such financing in various forms and at various positions in our capital structure.” CEO Hamid Akhavan added, “We're able to engage with anyone and all the stakeholders.”\n\nIn Reorg’s view, EchoStar Chairman Charlie Ergen significantly escalated his exposure to the risks of legacy DNC’s operations and assets with the merger of DISH and EchoStar at the close of 2023. Ergen was a majority shareholder in both companies and, following the merger close, it appears likely that the combined company has looked to legacy EchoStar’s liquidity, which stood at $2.2 billion as of Sept. 30, to fund DNC’s 2024 cash burn, including its 5G network capital expenditures and operating costs as well as the repayment of $951 million of 2.375% convertible notes that matured on Friday, March 15.\n\nIn turn, many of the company’s strategic asset transfers in January would directly benefit EchoStar shareholders, including Ergen, if the company were to file for bankruptcy. EchoStar may have similarly structured the recent payments from EchoStar Corp. to DNC, discussed below, as intercompany loans, which would further benefit shareholders in a bankruptcy context.\n\nWe believe, as discussed below, that as a strategy to coercively address its convertible notes, the company could look to move its AWS-3 spectrum licenses from the DNC credit box to the EchoStar Corp. level, raise additional debt on the transferred licenses and fund cash needs at DNC via additional intercompany loans, again, to the benefit of EchoStar Corp. shareholders.\n\nFollowing the January asset transfers, we estimate that tens of billions of dollars of value from spectrum licenses and other assets at EchoStar Corp. and DNC could flow to the company’s shareholders if EchoStar were to file for bankruptcy today.\n\nIn our view, however, other recent actions by Ergen, including the DISH-EchoStar merger, which potentially subjected legacy EchoStar’s assets to risks from DISH’s capital structure, and subsequent “strategic transactions,” which could be deemed fraudulent conveyances in a near-term bankruptcy, strongly indicate to us that he does not intend to follow this path. Instead, we expect EchoStar to try and raise new capital utilizing its unencumbered assets, potentially moving some assets away from DNC, to help fund its cash needs.\n\nA summary of EchoStar’s complex organizational chart, including a breakdown of assets and debt by credit box, is shown below (a more detailed version of the org. chart is available HERE):\n\n(Click HERE to enlarge.)\n\nPresumably, EchoStar plans to leverage its unencumbered assets and incremental structural flexibility after the January transactions to address the company’s $2 billion in DISH DBS Corp. unsecured notes due on Nov. 15, its $11.1 billion in third-party debt maturing in 2025 and 2026, and other obligations. However, it remains unclear exactly what the company plans.\n\nNote: Includes pro forma adjustment for March 15 maturity of $951 million of 2.375% DNC convertible notes.\n\nSeparate from the $11.1 billion third-party maturities mentioned above, the company has significant near-term maturities of intercompany loans, including:\n\n$4.7 billion of DNC intercompany loan tranche A payable to EchoStar Intercompany Receivable Co. LLC, which matures Dec. 1, 2026; and\n\n$2.8 billion of DNC intercompany loan tranche B payable to DISH DBS Corp., which matures Dec. 1, 2028.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible that, since year-end 2023, EchoStar Corp. has funded in excess of $1 billions in intercompany loans to DNC. As shown below, we estimate that DNC burned roughly $1.2 billion of liquidity in the fourth quarter, resulting in an about $650 million liquidity deficit that was presumably funded with liquidity from DBS.\n\nAfter the close of the EchoStar merger at year-end, it is possible that DNC funded its $442 million SNR Wireless put obligation, its $951 million March 15 maturity of 2.375% convertible notes and its first-quarter FCF burn all with intercompany loans from EchoStar Corp.\n\nAWS-3 Licenses Might Facilitate New-Money Financing, Convert Refi; 800 MHz Option, Strategic Possibilities Remain\n\nAt the pay-TV-focused DBS credit box, $2 billion of unsecured notes will come due on Nov. 15. We continue to expect that the company will seek to address that maturity with proceeds from a securitization transaction involving the DISH TV subscriber agreements now held at the DBS unrestricted subsidiary DISH DBS Issuer LLC, possibly with a modified version of the proposed secured notes at the center of the now-abandoned exchange offer for the DBS unsecured notes.\n\nIn fact, on the fourth-quarter call on March 1, Akhavan commented, “Financing will be required” to address the November maturity, and referenced the new unrestricted subsidiary as a potential source of “significant new financing capacity.”\n\nAt the DNC credit box, after the March 15 maturity of $951 million in convertible notes through 2026, the company faces:\n\n$4.9 billion of additional convertible notes maturing in 2025 and 2026;\n\n$4.7 billion of tranche A intercompany loans payable to EchoStar Corp. due Dec. 1, 2026;\n\nIncremental 5G network buildout capex, which, for 2024, Orban guided to be “less than half” of the 2023 amount, which was about $2.6 billion;\n\nOngoing 5G network operating expenses, which totaled about $1.4 billion on an annualized run-rate basis in the fourth quarter;\n\nSubscriber acquisition and related equipment costs, to the extent that DNC looks to accelerate the growth of its retail wireless business;\n\nA $3.5 billion obligation to T-Mobile, if it chooses to execute its option to purchase certain 800 MHz licenses; and\n\nPossible capital calls to the Federal Communications Commission for re-auctioned AWS-3 licenses.\n\nWe believe that to raise new money and potentially address DNC’s 2025 and 2026 convertible notes, EchoStar may look to DNC’s unencumbered and newly controlled AWS-3 licenses, which are carried at a $9.9 billion book value. As discussed below, potential capital calls at the DNC credit box related to the FCC’s re-auction of DNC’s relinquished AWS-3 licenses, for which it previously sought 25% small business bidding credits, adds a degree of structuring complexity.\n\nEchoStar could potentially move the AWS-3 licenses from the DNC credit box to EchoStar Corp. and raise new money secured by those licenses. New money raised at EchoStar Corp. could fund DNC’s cash needs through intercompany loans, which could benefit from security or guarantees that the existing convertible notes do not benefit from. These intercompany loans could potentially provide the company with leverage to push out maturities through a coercive exchange for new convertible notes.\n\nWe believe that EchoStar continues to explore a path to purchase T-Mobile’s 800 MHz spectrum, despite having written down the 800 MHz option value to zero in the fourth quarter of 2023. We believe that the company could draw on some combination of a 600 MHz spectrum swap, 700 MHz spectrum sale, debt financing and Conx participation to finance the purchase. During the fourth-quarter call, Akhavan suggested that the company may have flexibility to monetize some of its spectrum, stating, “We don’t find ourselves in a position that we are tied to a very specific recipe of [spectrum ownership] … We have plenty of spectrum - far more than I need at this moment.”\n\nThe involvement of a strategic partner, which remains a real possibility, has the potential to provide momentum to EchoStar equity’s narrative, potentially allowing equity to play a role in addressing the company’s structure in a less dilutive fashion than a straight equity raise, which we believe could only be done at very dilutive terms.\n\nWe believe that the spectrum licenses EchoStar moved from DNC to EchoStar Wireless Holding LLC were selected because of their strategic nature, particularly when combined with legacy EchoStar’s global S-band licenses. These licenses could attract transactions with low Earth orbit operators, such as SpaceX or Amazon’s Project Kuiper, or even device makers such as Apple, which has demonstrated its interest in spectrum, particularly nonterrestrial network, or NTN, spectrum, through its partnership with Globalstar.\n\nWe believe that, in addition to these considerations, the following unencumbered assets could play a role addressing EchoStar’s capital needs:\n\nThe DNC credit box’s 5G network: Through year-end 2023, DISH has expended more than $8 billion on this network, including more than $6 billion in capex and more than $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA losses specific to the unit deploying its 5G network.\n\nThe $7.5 billion in intercompany loan receivables owed by DNC, held at EchoStar Intercompany Receivable Co. LLC ($4.7 billion tranche A) and DISH DBS Corp. ($2.8 billion tranche B).\n\nThe DNC credit box’s retail wireless assets and operations, which included 7.4 million subscribers as of Dec. 31.\n\nThe Sling TV entities that the company designated as unrestricted subsidiaries in the DBS credit box as part of the January “strategic transactions.”\n\nEight satellites, including direct-to-home and S-band related satellites, held by DNC and EchoStar Corp., as shown above.\n\n$10B in Book Value of Newly Controlled AWS-3 Licenses Might Provide Path to Raise New Secured Debt; Carrot, Stick for Convert Refi\n\nFollowing the January “strategic transactions,” the spectrum license holdings remaining at the DNC credit box consist of the following: 600 MHz; 700 MHz; AWS-3 and 3.45 GHz. Of these licenses, the AWS-3 and 700 MHz licenses are unencumbered, while the 600 MHz licenses serve as collateral for DNC’s $3.5 billion of 11.75% senior secured notes and its 3.45 GHz licenses serve as collateral for $7.5 billion of intercompany loans.\n\nThe AWS-3 spectrum consists of uplink spectrum used in DISH’s proprietary band 70 and paired (uplink/downlink) spectrum that is used in band 66 by the three large U.S. wireless carriers: AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile.\n\nEchoStar recently purchased the interests in its AWS-3 spectrum license-holding subsidiaries that it did not previously own from two former manager entities, including:\n\nNorthstar Manager’s ownership interests in Northstar Spectrum LLC, purchased on Oct. 12, 2023, for about $109 million; and\n\nSNR Wireless Management LLC’s interest in SNR Wireless HoldCo LLC, purchased on Feb. 16 for about $442 million.\n\nFollowing these purchases, EchoStar now owns 100% of each of the spectrum-owning entities, Northstar Spectrum LLC and SNR Wireless HoldCo LLC.\n\nBecause the purchase of the manager’s interests provide EchoStar with control of the AWS-3 licenses, these purchases potentially unlock these spectrum assets, with a $10 billion book value, for use as collateral for future financing.\n\nIn Reorg’s view, if the AWS-3 licenses are removed from the DNC credit box, they could also serve as both a carrot and a stick for a convertible notes coercive exchange. Even if the licenses are used as collateral for a new financing, current convertible noteholders may seek to maintain their credit support, albeit unsecured, from these assets.\n\nDNC’s existing debt documents do not restrict the company from moving the AWS-3 licenses out of the DNC box, similar to how they did not impede the transfer of DNC’s previously discussed licenses to EchoStar Corp. as part of the January transactions.\n\nOne potential route for raising new money using the unencumbered AWS-3 licenses and refinancing the 2025 and 2026 convertible notes is summarized in the figure below. The company could:\n\nRequest that the FCC allow the transfer of the AWS-3 licenses to a new entity below EchoStar Wireless Holding LLC. This request is potentially complicated by DNC’s guarantee of possible default payments that will be determined upon the re-auction of Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless licenses.\n\nIssue new debt, at this new entity below EchoStar Wireless Holding LLC, secured by the AWS-3 licenses and equity of entities directly holding the licenses.\n\nLend the proceeds from the new debt to DNC via an intercompany loan.\n\nLaunch a discounted exchange for the outstanding DNC convertible notes, offering new later-maturing DNC convertible debt, with improved conversion features and an additional guarantee by the issuer of the new-money debt.\n\n(Click HERE to enlarge.)\n\nThe indenture for DNC’s 11.75% secured notes restrict DNC and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, including through an intercompany loan. However, there are several debt baskets that could potentially be used to incur and/or guarantee new intercompany debt, including:\n\nA basket allowing DNC to incur debt in any amount, if secured solely by FCC licenses other than the 600 MHz licenses that secure the 11.75% notes;\n\nA basket allowing debt in any amount issued by a subsidiary that holds only assets that are primarily used in the company’s retail wireless business; such debt can be secured by such assets as long as the entity remains a nonguarantor under the 11.75% notes;\n\nA general debt basket under which DNC could incur up to $1.05 billion of unsecured debt;\n\nA basket allowing any debt of DNC subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 11.75% notes, secured by assets of such subsidiaries, if such debt can be incurred in pro forma compliance with a 5x “Priority Indebtedness to Cash Flow Ratio”; and\n\nA basket allowing any of the above debt to be guaranteed by DNC and subsidiaries of DNC that guarantee the 11.75% notes.\n\nOn the basis of these options to incur additional debt, we believe the company is most likely to seek to use the capacity provided for debt secured solely by FCC licenses that do not serve as collateral for the 11.75% secured notes and/or the $1.05 billion general debt basket. Any such newly issued debt could also be guaranteed by DNC and/or its subsidiaries that guarantee the 11.75% notes. If guaranteed by such subsidiaries, the intercompany loan we expect to utilize this capacity would have structural seniority relative to the existing convertible notes (which are not secured or guaranteed) with respect to those subsidiaries’ assets.\n\nYet-to-Be-Scheduled AWS-3 Re-Auction Adds Complexity to Financing\n\nAdding a degree of complexity to the already complex AWS-3 license financing, the entities holding EchoStar’s AWS-3 licenses and DNC, as a guarantor of these obligations (SNR, Northstar), are potentially subject to capital calls by the FCC of up to $2.9 billion. The capital calls result from the long-running saga relating to DISH’s attempt to claim 25% small-business-related bidding credits in the 2015 FCC auction of AWS-3 licenses. The FCC denied DISH’s eligibility for the credits, and the denial was upheld after a lengthy appeal process. Accordingly, the FCC will retain and re-auction, at a yet-to-be-determined date, certain AWS-3 licenses that DISH entities relinquished in 2015 (representing 25% of the gross purchase price).\n\nIn 2015, as a penalty for not paying for specific licenses that it won at auction and which were subsequently relinquished, NorthStar Wireless and SNR Wireless made interim payments of 15% of the gross winning bids for these respective relinquished licenses. These interim payments will be credited against any future payments owed. Following a re-auction of these relinquished licenses, final default payments will come due. The final default payments are composed of two components dependant upon the winning bid at the re-auction, with a credit provided for any interim payments made previously:\n\nIf a winning bid in a re-auction is less than the defaulted bid, the lesser of:\n\nThe difference between net, or cash, defaulted bid and the subsequent net winning bid; or\n\nThe difference between the gross defaulted bid and the subsequent gross winning bid.\n\nA payment equal to 15% of the lesser of the initial gross winning bid or the re-auction winning bid.\n\nIn other words, in the re-auction, if the winning bids received by the FCC are greater than or equal to the respective defaulted gross winning bids of Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, no additional amounts will be owed to the FCC.\n\nAn illustration of hypothetical default payments for Northstar’s New York City block I licenses under three subsequent bid scenarios is shown below:\n\nDNC provided guarantees to the FCC for both Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless’ future default-related payments in October 2015. Reorg expects that if EchoStar were to look to move the licenses to EchoStar Wireless Holding LLC, the FCC may require a guarantee of these payments from Echo Wireless Holding LLC. The FCC approved the company’s transfer of spectrum from the DNC credit box to the EchoStar Corp. level in January, and, in Reorg’s view, it appears that a transfer of the AWS-3 could be negotiated.\n\nFurther, the FCC stated in October 2015 letters to Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless that any retained AWS-3 licenses would include a condition obligating the licensee and its “assignee or transferee of such license, jointly and severally, to make timely payment of its ‘Proportional Share’ of any total payment that may subsequently be required” for their respective relinquished licenses. The “Proportional Share” is further defined in the letters to be “equal to the total amount that is due with respect to all” relinquished licenses, multiplied by a ratio of: the winning bid of a retained license to the aggregate total winning bids for the licensee (Northstar Wireless or SNR Wireless). The FCC states that a retained AWS-3 “license shall automatically terminate upon failure” of its licensee to timely pay its “Proportional Share,” thus, in our view, effectively encumbering the retained licenses with the obligation to make the payments on the relinquished licenses\n\nEchoStar’s 2023 10-K notes, “At this time, DISH Network (through itself, a subsidiary or another entity in which it may hold a direct or indirect interest) expects to participate in any re-auction of those AWS-3 licenses.” Since EchoStar’s AWS-3 default payments are determined on a license-by-license basis, rather than on a net basis based on the aggregate total defaulted bids for the relinquished licenses, we expect that the company will be obligated to pay some additional amount to the FCC, via either winning bids and/or default payments.\n\nHowever, in Reorg’s view, capital calls related to a re-auction could be far less than the company’s $2.9 billion total potential liability, since it is our understanding that other carriers have built out capacity for this spectrum in their networks, potentially allowing them to bid higher prices. Regardless of the exact outcome, any potential default payments, and any potential associated DNC subrogation claim, must be accounted for in a potential financing. To mitigate concerns related to the capital calls, a new debt agreement could potentially provide for a facility that would backstop any unpaid default payments in exchange for the backing of additional collateral.\n\nA summary of the gross bids for Northstar Wireless’ and SNR Wireless’ relinquished licenses is shown below:\n\nDNC’s 800 MHz Option Appears to Remain in Play With Potential Conx Financing\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, EchoStar fully wrote down its option to purchase approximately 14 MHz of paired 800 MHz licenses from T-Mobile. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the company will ultimately exercise the option. To exercise the option, which expires April 1, the company must pay T-Mobile $3.5 billion, which is net of a $100 million extension fee that DISH paid T-Mobile in October 2023.\n\nOn EchoStar’s fourth-quarter call, Orban’s comments suggested that the write-down was driven by accounting requirements, rather than the company’s decision to not exercise the option. Specifically, he said that the write-down was “due to the relatively short time period remaining prior to the option's expiration, coupled with not having a definitive financing agreement in place.” Similarly, T-Mobile CFO Peter Osvaldik, at a March 5 conference, left open the possibility that EchoStar would exercise the option, commenting, “From our perspective … DISH has until April 1 to exercise that option … while what they inferred in their 10-K is that the likelihood is down, they still have that time.”\n\nInterestingly, on March 10, special-purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, Conx Corp, which Ergen founded, agreed to acquire DISH Wireless’ Colorado headquarters for $26.75 million. The purchase is expected to trigger a $200 million preferred equity investment from Ergen in Conx, adding to the SPAC’s $27.9 million of cash held in trust on Sept. 30.\n\nPotentially indicating that Conx could be in play as a financing vehicle for an 800 MHz licenses purchase, Conx stated that, following the real estate closing, it “anticipates to grow through acquisition opportunities, including, but not limited to, disruptive technologies and infrastructure assets.” Further, the SPAC stated that it is “currently involved in ongoing discussions regarding potential acquisitions with the objective of becoming a diversified operating entity focused on the future of communications and connectivity.” Burns & McDonnell’s Aligned Interests Might Position It as a Conx 800 MHz Financing Partner\n\nIn August 2023, Burns & McDonnell, or B&M, which describes itself as an engineering, architecture, construction, environmental and consulting solutions company, opposed DISH’s efforts to extend the expiration date of the 800 MHz option. B&M said that it had “been planning for years to purchase the spectrum at auction if DISH declines to exercise its option.” The company continued, “Over the past three years … Burns & McDonnell has put together a team, with American-led financing, that has the financial scale and operational expertise to acquire the spectrum and put it to good use.”\n\nB&M’s intended use of the 800 MHz licenses closely aligns with Conx’s stated investment strategy. B&M said that it is “committed to leveraging the nationwide spectrum for targeted community benefit enabling critical infrastructure operators like electric utilities to deploy wireless broadband networks.” The company maintains this would “bolster the reliability, resiliency, and security of our nation’s critical infrastructure” and place “these infrastructure operators … in an excellent position to aid in closing the digital divide with 5G and Open Radio Access technologies because of their commitments to serving all their customers with essential goods and services.”\n\nDNC has built the 800 MHz spectrum into its network, placing it in a unique position to quickly and cost-effectively put the spectrum into use. Ergen said on Nov. 6 during the third-quarter call that the company had invested “more than $1 billion” in the buildout of the 800 MHz licenses. We believe that as B&M is “not a facilities-based nationwide wireless carrier,” it would likely need to rely on a third-party, such as DISH, to execute its strategy. We believe this means that B&M could more cost-effectively put the spectrum to use if it were to partner with DISH.\n\nAlso on the third-quarter call, Ergen said that his focus over the next six months would be to determine whether there is “a good business plan for [the 800 MHz spectrum] that may be financeable.”\n\nConsidering B&M’s demonstrated interest in the 800 MHz spectrum, their potential alignment in use-cases for the spectrum with Conx’s, and DISH’s ability to host the spectrum on its network, it appears that a deal between the three companies might accommodate each of their shared interests.\n\n600 MHz Trade, 700 MHz Sale, B&M PIPE Might Provide 800 MHz Financing Path If EchoStar were to purchase the 800 MHz licenses in a deal involving Conx and Burns & McDonald, there are several potential financing sources for the $3.5 billion option purchase price:\n\nUsing certain of EchoStar’s New York City 600 MHz spectrum licenses as partial consideration to T-Mobile for the $3.5 billion purchase price as T-Mobile uses these bands in its New York City network already. The 600 MHz licenses serve as collateral for the DNC 11.75% secured notes. However, those notes would allow the 600 MHz licenses to be exchanged for other spectrum licenses “with the same wireless spectrum license bandwidth, MHz-POPs and [FCC Partial Economic Area].” If “same wireless spectrum license bandwidth” is interpreted to allow for the replacement of 20 MHz of 600 MHz licenses for 20 MHz of spectrum licenses in another band, then EchoStar Corp.’s 20 MHz of band 66 AWS-4 spectrum could potentially be swapped as collateral for the 11.75% notes, freeing up the 600 MHz licenses to possibly partially pay the $3.5 billion purchase price.\n\nOn a combined basis, T-Mobile agreed to pay $2.41 per MHz-POP for 600 MHz licenses in its Columbia Capital and Comcast transactions announced in August and September 2022, respectively. Based on 25.3 million POPs in the NYC PEA, as of 2010, a trade of 20 MHz of DISH’s contiguous 600 MHz licenses could reasonably be worth more than $1.2 billion to T-Mobile. As illustrated below, this would leave DISH with 20 MHz of paired licenses in the NYC PEA, similar to the amount it holds in many other PEAs:\n\nSource: FCC filing\n\nA sale of DNC’s 700 MHz E block spectrum licenses. These licenses provide the company with 6 MHz of downlink spectrum. Access to T-Mobile’s 800 MHz licenses, which include approximately 7 MHz of uplink and and approximately 7 MHz of downlink spectrum, would potentially provide EchoStar with low-band spectrum similarly situated to its 700 MHz licenses. This spectrum might fully replace the sold 700 MHz downlink licenses and provide incremental uplink capacity. EchoStar carries the 700 MHz at a $712 million book value, based on the price DISH paid for the licenses in the FCC’s 2008 auction. We expect that the value has likely appreciated in the past 16 years.\n\nA private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from Burns & McDonnell to Conx, supplemented by debt financing, either at Conx or EchoStar/DNC.\n\nConx could provide DNC/EchoStar with cash, funded with the PIPE and Ergen’s $200 million preferred investment, in exchange for the purchase or long-term lease of the 800 MHz licenses. If DNC sold the licenses to Conx, DNC/EchoStar could gain access to the 800 MHz licenses through a licensing agreement with Conx. Alternatively, if the licenses are leased to Conx, DISH could retain a certain amount of 800 MHz capacity.\n\nAnterix Operates a Business Model Similar to the Model Described by B&M, Conx\n\nAnterix Inc. is a publicly traded company holding licensed paired 900 MHz spectrum (896-901 MHz; 935-940 MHz) that could represent a business model for the spectrum similar to that described by B&M and could perhaps play a role either as a partner with or potential merger target for Conx. Anterix states that it partners with “utilities and technology companies to harness the power of 900 MHz broadband for modernized grid solutions.” A Feb. 28 petition for rulemaking from Anterix and a group of utility companies highlighted use cases for utility private broadband networks including “wildfire prevention, decarbonization, integration of distributed energy resources, and enhancement of cybersecurity protections.” In a specific use case for wildfire protection, San Diego Gas & Electric deployed a “Falling Conductor Protection solution” that is “designed to recognize when a live utility electric wire has broken and is falling, and de-energizes that line before it hits the ground.”\n\nAnterix provides its spectrum under long-term agreements and leases to utilities that deploy private wireless broadband networks. The company generated only $2.6 million of revenue in calendar year 2023 but stated that it had “contracted” approximately $270 million in proceeds as of Feb. 14, with a total “pipeline” of more than $3 billion.\n\nEchoStar Corp.’s Licenses Appear to Position the Company for Strategic Transactions\n\nIn line with Reorg’s expectation that EchoStar would create a global S-band credit box, EchoStar moved numerous spectrum licenses to the EchoStar Corp. level in January. These licenses, which we view as strategically attractive for potential partnerships, include the company’s AWS-4, H-Block, CBRS, 12 GHz and various high-band licenses.\n\nAs discussed in Reorg’s EchoStar initiation, the AWS-4 band includes the same frequencies as the company’s global S-band licenses, it also serves as downlink spectrum in the 3GPP’s band 66 (2180-2200 MHz) and band 70 (2000-2020 MHz). The H-Block licenses, which were also transferred to EchoStar Corp., include 10 MHz of nationwide paired spectrum, of which the 5 MHz of downlink spectrum is directly adjacent to the AWS-4 spectrum. The AWS-4 licenses are strategically valuable to both:\n\nLow Earth orbit, or LEO, satellite operators, such as SpaceX and Amazon’s Kuiper; and\n\nThe big three mobile operators (AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile) that employ band 66 in their networks.\n\nEchoStar implied that AWS-4 licenses had a “fair market value” of about $18 billion, or about $1.36 per MHz-POP in aggregate, when it announced its since-terminated convertible notes exchange in January.\n\nSeparately, EchoStar continues to petition the FCC to repurpose its 12 GHz spectrum licenses, which also now sit at EchoStar Corp., for fixed wireless access, or FWA, use. On Feb. 2, Ergen and DNC’s regulatory management conducted meetings with FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and three of the FCC’s four commissioners to discuss, among other items, repurposing the 12 GHz band. SpaceX has opposed EchoStar’s efforts to repurpose the band, first opposing DISH’s initial proposal to operate terrestrial mobile services and now opposing its efforts to conduct FWA with the spectrum. SpaceX argues that the services would interfere with its Starlink services that operate under the fixed-satellite service, or FSS, rules for the band.\n\nGiven their common points of interest in licensing matters and potential related coordination opportunities, a strategic partnership with SpaceX or other LEO satellite operators could unlock the value of EchoStar Corp.’s global S-band licenses and its 12 GHz licenses. Separately, EchoStar Corp.’s high-band licenses, which the company transferred in January, might be valuable for automation or for separate high-capacity purposes at other Elon Musk-related companies, such as Tesla.\n\nDirect-to-Device Opportunities May Attract SpaceX, Amazon and Apple, Among Others, to EchoStar’s 3GPP Supported Band\n\nAs Reorg has previously discussed, the satellite direct-to-device services market is quickly taking shape.\n\nAdvancing SpaceX, AST Mobile and Lynk’s efforts to provide satellite coverage to mobile devices via terrestrial spectrum, the FCC on Thursday, March 14, unanimously adopted an order that provides for “Supplemental Coverage from Space,” or SCS. This coverage would potentially allow LEO satellite operators to provide supplemental coverage through lease arrangements with mobile operators in certain bands previously used exclusively for terrestrial services.\n\nEchoStar’s H-block licenses (1915-1920 MHz uplink; 1995-2000 MHz downlink) are among the bands approved for such services. As noted above, the downlink portion of the H-block spectrum is directly adjacent to EchoStar’s AWS-4 licenses, which are approved for international satellite use.\n\nThe FCC’s SCS order provides SpaceX with the opportunity to pursue its direct-to-device efforts utilizing T-Mobile’s G-block spectrum. However, indicating a continuing interest in a standard-based and/or a globally harmonized approach to nonterrestrial networks as well, nearly simultaneously with the FCC’s Feb. 22 SCS proposed order release, SpaceX petitioned the FCC to “modernize” its sharing framework for GlobalStar’s and EchoStar’s mobile-satellite service, or MSS, spectrum bands, on Feb. 21 and Feb. 22, respectively.\n\nSeparately indicating momentum for a standards-based approach for nonterrestrial networks, mobile device chipmaker Qualcomm informed satellite operator Iridium on Nov. 3, 2023, that it was terminating its partnership to “enable satellite messaging and emergency services in smartphones” via its Snapdragon Satellite. After the announcement, Qualcomm told CNBC that smartphone makers have “indicated a preference towards standards-based solutions” for satellite-to-phone connectivity. DISH’s S-band spectrum is part of nonterrestrial network band 256 under the 3GPP’s standards.\n\nOn the EchoStar-DISH conference call in August announcing the merger, Ergen said that one of the main rationales for merging the companies was to combine both companies’ S-band spectrum assets, “taking advantage of the 5G standards, which now have a satellite to handset standard.”\n\nCEO Hamid Akhavan explained that a standards-based approach is preferable to the use of non-standards-based terrestrial spectrum for SCS, as designed in the FCC’s recent order, since a non-standards-based approach leaves operators with “a spectrum hodgepodge around the world in every geography.” A non-standards-based approach “adds a lot of cost and interference that you have to then mitigate,” according to Akhavan. He added that conversely, “when you have the same frequency around the world, it’s much easier for your modem manufacturers, handset manufacturers and your operators who don’t have to give their spectrum up.”\n\nShare this article:"
