        "text": "American television provider\n\nDISH Network L.L.C. (an acronym for \"Digital Sky Highway\"[1]), a subsidiary of EchoStar, provides multichannel television and satellite television via DISH Network, mobile phone service via DISH Wireless (Boost Mobile), as well as over-the-top IPTV services via Sling TV.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding, early growth and launch of DBS services\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was formed in 1980 as EchoStar Communications by Charlie Ergen, Candy Ergen, and Jim DeFranco, as a distributor of C-band satellite television systems.[2] In 1987, EchoStar applied for a satellite television broadcast license with the FCC and was granted access to orbital slot 119° west longitude in 1992.[citation needed] A year after the launch of its first satellite, EchoStar I,[3] EchoStar launched its DBS broadcast services under the DISH Network name on March 4, 1996.[1] That launch marked the beginning of its television services under a subscription business model.[citation needed]\n\nSpin-off of infrastructural assets\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2007, EchoStar Communications completed the corporate spin-off of its technology and infrastructure assets into a separate company under the EchoStar name, and the remainder of the company was renamed DISH Network Corporation.[4][5][6][7]\n\nAcquisitions and expansion\n\n[edit]\n\nJoseph Clayton became president and chief executive officer of the company in June 2011, while Charlie Ergen remained chairman.[8] Clayton remained in the position until March 31, 2015, when he retired, leaving Ergen to resume the post.[9][10] In December 2017, Ergen was replaced by Erik Carlson.[11] That same year, Dish Network spent over $3 billion in acquisitions of companies in bankruptcy,[12] This includes the April 6, 2011, purchase of Blockbuster in a bankruptcy auction for $322 million in cash and the assumption of $87 million in liabilities.[13][14][15] After acquiring Blockbuster, Dish Network made available Dish Movie Pack for Dish Network subscribers and Sling TV for non-Dish Network subscribers. Blockbuster also has agreements that allow it to receive movies 28 days before Netflix and Redbox which could encourage customers to use these services.[12]\n\nDISH Network also acquired DBSD and TerreStar Corporation.[12] Dish Network also made a bid to purchase Hulu in October 2011, but Hulu's owners chose not to sell the company.[16] In January 2013, Dish bid $5 billion for Clearwire to add wireless internet and mobile video services.[17][18][19] In April 2013, it made a $25 billion bid for Sprint Corporation.[20][21][22][23]\n\nIn 2011, Dish petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to combine the S-Band spectrum it acquired from DBSD and Terrestar, and combine this spectrum with LTE. Unlike LightSquared, Dish's spectrum has minimal risk of disrupting Global Positioning Systems.[24]\n\nAt the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show, Dish Network announced it would shorten its trade name to \"DISH\", to emphasize new developments such as its Hopper DVR and broadband services.[25]\n\nAfter changing the position of a satellite orbital position from being over Mexico to Brazil in 2011, Dish Network sought companies that could make a deal, among them Telefónica. However, nothing ever came of this, and DISH decided to enter the country itself. According to the Brazilian Agency of Telecommunications (Anatel), they awaited the authorization of the application.[26] In June 2019, nonetheless, DISH TV accepted to resign its satellite exploration rights assigned to EchoStar and thus ending the possibility of entering the Brazilian market.[27]\n\nIn 2019, EchoStar transferred the portion of its business which managed and provided broadcast satellite services, referred to as the BSS (Broadcast Satellite Services) business, to DISH to concentrate on broadband services and other initiatives.[28]\n\nIn 2020, DISH acquired Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, Sprint's prepaid businesses, for $1.4 billion from T-Mobile and Sprint. Dish also acquired $3.6 billion of 800 MHz spectrum, Sprint's entire 800 MHz portfolio.[29][30][31][32]\n\nIn August 2023, Echostar announced that it would acquire DISH Network in an all-stock purchase, undoing their previous split. The acquisition, which was completed December 31, 2023, was part of an effort to bolster the company's wireless business, with chairman Charlie Ergen stating that it would allow them to offer \"an enhanced consumer connectivity business\". As Ergen already held 90% of the voting stock in both companies, the FCC considered the \"acquisition\" to be a reorganization of assets with no change in effective control.[33][34]\n\nCriticism and legal issues\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Criticism of Dish Network\n\nDISH and its subsidiaries have faced legal action for some of its questionable practices, including fines for telemarketing tactics such as failure to disclose fees with full transparency.[35][36][37][38]\n\nDISH has been sued and countersued dozens of times. DISH argues that effective litigation is important to corporate operations. One such lawsuit was DISH's use of their Hopper DVR to make it easy for viewers to skip commercials.[39]\n\nIn 2023 DISH was fined $150,000 by the FCC for failing to de-orbit its EchoStar VII satellite according to the terms of its license; this was the first fine ever issued to a company over the matter of \"space debris\".[40]\n\nRemoval of regional sports programming\n\n[edit]\n\nDish Network has always refused to carry some of the higher-priced regional sports networks, most notably AT&T SportsNet Southwest, YES Network, and Spectrum SportsNet, which have never been available on Dish. The contract of the entire MSG Network had ended on October 1, 2010, early; CSN New England was dropped on August 6, 2014.[41] In July 2019, Dish removed the entire slate of Fox Sports Networks channels (which have since been re-branded as Bally Sports).[42] This was the beginning of a trend with Altitude being removed in August and NBC Sports Chicago in October of that year.[43] On April 1, 2021, Dish removed the remaining NBC Sports Regional Networks and the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. Dish Network president Brian Neylon commented that \"The current RSN model is fundamentally broken,” stating that he was in favor of offering the networks as an a la carte service.[44] Six months later on October 1, 2021, Dish removed the entire AT&T SportsNet network of channels.[45][46] In 2022, Dish, alongside Sling made The Walt Disney Company pull their programming from the services. This was only temporary, as they got brought back later. They had previously been pulled from YouTube TV in 2021, and were pulled from Spectrum for ten days in early-September 2023.\n\nThe last remaining regional sports network, NESN, was removed from DISH on December 20, 2021.[47]\n\n2023 ransomware attack\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2023, Dish Network suffered a major ransomware attack which resulted in internal outages, loss of service at subsidiary companies such as Boost Mobile, and data theft.[48] The company had to retain outside experts to resolve the issue, and the news caused a slide in the company's share price to a 14-year-low.[49][50] Service outages lasted for more than a month, with customers reporting wait times for customer service stretching to more than 14 hours.[51] In the aftermath of the ransomware attack, Dish Network was criticized for lack of transparency or communication with its customers.[52]\n\nServices and devices\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Subscribers[53] 1996 350,000 1997 1,040,000 1998 1,900,000 1999 3,400,000 2000 5,260,000 2001 6,830,000 2002 8,180,000 2003 9,425,000 2004 10,905,000 2005 12,040,000 2006 13,105,000 2007 13,780,000 2008 13,678,000 2009 14,100,000 2010 14,133,000 2011 13,967,000 2012 14,056,000 2013 14,057,000 2014 13,978,000 2015 13,897,000 2016 13,671,000 2017 13,242,000 2018 12,322,000 2019 11,986,000 2020 11,290,000 2021 10,707,000 2022 10,018,000\n\nDISH's main service is satellite television and its offerings are comparable to other satellite and cable companies. Viewers can choose from a series of service bundles, paying more money for more channels. A la carte programming is available, however limited to premium channels such as HBO or Showtime. The company is currently working on diversifying its offerings. With its purchase of Blockbuster LLC, DISH owns the Blockbuster trademarks and has used its intellectual property agreement to offer streaming and mail-order video services.\n\nDishNET\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Satellite Internet access\n\nOn September 27, 2012, DISH Network announced a satellite broadband service called DishNET, aimed at rural areas where cable is often not available.[54]\n\nWireless\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2019, DISH entered an agreement as part of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger in which DISH would acquire Sprint's prepaid wireless businesses, including Boost Mobile.[55] As part of this agreement, DISH became the 4th-largest major wireless carrier in the United States.[56] After the merger was approved by the Justice Department, DISH announced plans to \"deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network capable of serving 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023.\"[56]\n\nOn July 1, 2020, DISH officially purchased Boost Mobile from T-Mobile for $1.4 billion.[57] With this purchase it officially launched its wireless business, DISH Wireless, LLC, offering prepaid service through the Boost brand as an MVNO on the T-Mobile network.[30] DISH stated intentions to offer branded postpaid service in the future with the build-out of their own network.[30] DISH also intends to have the first standalone, 5G-only network in the United States.[30]\n\nOn July 19, 2021, DISH signed a $5 billion contract with AT&T and becoming a new AT&T MVNO within approximately two years. As a result, DISH Wireless customers will be able to roam on AT&T's 4G and 5G while DISH is continuously building its 5G-only network. The previous roaming agreement with T-Mobile remained unchanged.[58]\n\nOn May 4, 2022, Dish announced it had released its 5G network live to consumers in Las Vegas in addition to listing 113 cities for the next phase of roll out by the end of June. The service named \"Project Genesis\" is currently only compatible with the latest Motorola Edge Plus.[59]\n\nOnTech Smart Services\n\n[edit]\n\nDISH launched the direct-to-consumer smart home technology brand OnTech Smart Services in 2019; initially available in 11 metropolitan areas, the brand offers smart home devices and installation services.[60]\n\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency\n\n[edit]\n\nDISH has been described as the first large company to accept cryptocurrency and being “comfortable with cryptocurrency”. The company has accepted Bitcoin since 2014. Four years later it began accepting Bitcoin Cash. In September 2021, it announced a partnership with Input Output Global (formerly known as IOHK) to build subscription services based on the Cardano blockchain.[61] The following month it set up a system to expand 5G mobile network through customers using the Citizens Broadband Radio Service with rewards paid in cryptocurrency.[62]\n\nCharitable causes\n\n[edit]\n\nDISH Cares was launched in 2014 and focuses on community engagement, sustainability, and providing services following disasters.[64] The company has engaged in disaster relief efforts, including after Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Irma, and Maria.[65][66][67]\n\nTechnical information\n\n[edit]\n\nBroadcast technology\n\n[edit]\n\nFor years DISH used standard MPEG-2 for broadcasting, but the addition of bandwidth-intensive HDTV called for a change to the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC system. DISH announced that, from February 1, 2006, all new HDTV channels would be available in H.264 format only, while maintaining the current lineup as MPEG-2. The company intended to convert the entire platform to H.264 to provide more channels to subscribers. In 2007, DISH Network reduced the resolution of 1080-line channels from 1920x1080 to 1440x1080. Reducing the horizontal resolution and/or data rate of HD video is known as HD Lite and is done by other TV providers as well.[citation needed]\n\nBoth a standard receiver and a receiver with built-in digital video recorder (DVR) were available to subscribers.[68] The DISH Network ViP722 HD DVR replacement for the ViP622 received generally positive reviews.[69] It could record up to 350 hours of standard-definition (SD) broadcasts, or 55 hours of high-definition (HD). These set-top boxes (STBs) allow for HD on the primary TV and SD on the secondary TV (TV2) without a secondary box on TV2.\n\nReceivers and devices\n\n[edit]\n\nEarlier satellite dishes\n\n[edit]\n\nDISH Network's first satellite antenna was simply called the \"DISH Network\" dish. It was retroactively named the \"DISH 300\" when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming DISH 500 systems. It uses one LNB to obtain signals from the 119°W orbital location,[70] and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional high-definition or international programming from either the 148°W or 61.5°W orbital locations.[71][72] The 119°W slot is one of two primary orbital locations, the other being 110°W, that provide core services.[73][74]\n\nAfter EchoStar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between ASkyB and MCI WorldCom, it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110°W orbital location. Since EchoStar also owned the adjacent 119°W orbital location it developed the DISH 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative dual-LNB assembly. Although the new 20-inch DISH 500 was slightly larger than the then-current 18-inch DISH 300 and DirecTV dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from EchoStar's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500-channel capacity. The DISH 500, as a result, provided very large capacity for local-into-local service, nationwide programming, and business services. In order to migrate existing customers to DISH 500, DISH Network provided value-added channels in addition to local channels that could only be received with the DISH 500 and newer systems. Some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems were H2, Boomerang, Science, Planet Green, PBS Kids Sprout and Comedy Central.\n\nTailgater\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Tailgater is a portable satellite antenna; the tailgater can be purchased as a standalone device for $350. The Tailgater is compatible with the Wally and VIP211 receivers. Customers only need to pay for the period of time where the receiver is active on the account, the monthly cost for a Vip211 or Wally is $7 per month, if the receiver is the only one on the account, there is no charge.[75] It weighs ten pounds, is protected from weather, and automatically searches for a signal. The only satellites that are currently compatible with the Tailgater are at DISH's 119 (SD/HD TV), 110 (SD/HD TV), and 129 (SD/HD TV) orbital slots.[76]\n\nWally\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Wally is a solo-receiver without a built in digital video recorder (DVR).\n\nHopper and Joey\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hopper (DVR)\n\nHopper is a line of multi-tuner set-top boxes first introduced in 2012; they are digital video recorders that can be networked with accompanying \"Joey\" set-top boxes for multi-room access to recordings. DISH Network subsequently introduced updated versions of the Hopper, including Hopper with Sling (which adds integrated placeshifting capabilities), the Hopper 3, and the Hopper Plus [77] which features 4K support and 16 tuners. Hopper supports a voice-activated remote,[78][79][80][81][82][83] as well as Amazon Echo and Google Home integration.[84][85]\n\nApps\n\n[edit]\n\nDISH Anywhere\n\nDISH Anywhere is DISH's subscriber-only streaming video service. The DISH Anywhere app combines Sling broadcast technology and internet to bring subscribers DISH content wherever they are.[86] It also pairs with DISH On Demand, a library that has over 80,000 movies and shows.[87]\n\nAs of late 2018, HBO and Cinemax were no longer available for DISH customers due to Contract disputes.[88] However, Dish returned HBO and Cinemax programming as of August 2021 [1].\n\nSling TV\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Sling TV\n\nIn May 2012, DISH launched DISHWorld, a subscription-based over-the-top streaming IPTV service, as an app on Roku devices, offering access to over 50 international television channels via broadband streaming.[89]\n\nIn 2014, DISH Network began to reach carriage deals with broadcasters for a new over-the-top service that would be aimed towards cord cutters as a low-cost alternative to traditional pay television.[90] On January 5, 2015, DISH Network officially unveiled Sling TV, an over-the-top IPTV service designed to complement subscription video on-demand services such as Hulu and Netflix.[91]\n\nSome broadcasters have been hesitant about over-the-top services such as Sling TV, showing concern that they may undermine their carriage deals with larger conventional cable, satellite and Internet TV providers. Time Warner initially noted that the carriage of its channels on the service was only for a \"trial\" basis, while both Time Warner's CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and an analyst from the firm Macquarie Capital disclosed that current contract language in DISH's OTT carriage deals with the service's content distributors would cap the number of subscribers that the service is allowed to have at any given time to 5 million. Neither DISH Network or its content providers have confirmed any such cap.[92][93][94] As of January 2022, the service has reached 2.49 million subscribers.[95]\n\nSatellite fleet\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil 2019, most of the satellites used by DISH Network were owned and operated by EchoStar Corporation. DISH frequently moves satellites among its many orbiting slots so this list may not be accurate. Refer to Lyngsat and DISH Channel Chart for detailed satellite information.\n\nDISH Network satellites Satellite Location (degrees west) Launched Type Notes EchoStar I 77 December 28, 1995 Lockheed Martin Astro Space Series 7000 (AS-7000) Can carry a limited number of services on odd numbered transponders. DISH is not licensed to serve CONUS customers in the United States from this location but may transmit local stations. EchoStar II 148 September 10, 1996 Ariane 4 On 14 July 2008, EchoStar reported to the SEC that EchoStar II \"experienced a substantial failure that appears to have rendered the satellite a total loss\". Retired in mid-2008. EchoStar III 61.5 October 5, 1997 Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space A2100AX Replaced by EchoStar XV and was serving as an in-orbit spare. Placed on graveyard orbit by September 6, 2017.[96] EchoStar IV 77 May 8, 1998 Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space A2100AX This satellite had a launch issue, is now in an inclined orbit and is not currently[when?] operational. It largely serves as a placeholder for EchoStar slots. EchoStar V Deorbited from 148 September 23, 1999 Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 EchoStar V was moved from 110 to 129 and finally to 148. International programming at 148 has moved to Anik F3/118.75°. Locals have moved to spot beams at other locations. The satellite was to serve as a placeholder for EchoStar at the 148 slot. The satellite was experiencing stability issues that made signal levels unstable for the short time it was located at 148. On July 31, 2009, all remaining programming at 148 ceased. Factors now indicate discontinuation of the 148 slot, at least for the short term, 3–4 years. EchoStar VI 77 July 14, 2000 Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 Replaces EchoStar VIII. EchoStar VII 119 February 21, 2002 Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space A2100AX Currently[when?] an on orbit spare. Provides DISH Network's spot beam services to the western United States, as well as Muzak programming to businesses on leased bandwidth. EchoStar VIII 77 August 21, 2002 Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 Formerly at 110. On January 30, 2011, the satellite experienced a single event upset and drifted out of its intended orbit, this required all services to be relocated to other available satellite capacity in the Eastern Arc. One week later some services were restored, but the satellite is expected to be taken out of service again and replaced temporarily by EchoStar VI in order to conduct further testing. EchoStar X 110 February 15, 2006 Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space A2100AXS First seen functioning May 2006 in the 110.0W slot and is still transmitting from the same location as of October 2016. EchoStar XI 110 July 16, 2008 Space Systems/Loral LS-1300 EchoStar XII 61.5 July 17, 2003 Lockheed Martin AS-2100 Originally known as Rainbow 1, this satellite was launched by Cablevision/Rainbow DBS and used for the Voom DBS service at 61.5° W until the satellite and transponder licenses were sold to EchoStar in 2005.
