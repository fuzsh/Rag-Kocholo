        "text": "Shares of EchoStar Communications Corp. leapt nearly 7 percent yesterday on news that the company had purchased Sling Media and was contemplating a separation of its satellite-television business and its technology assets.\n\nEchoStar said yesterday that it was pursuing a plan under which its technology and infrastructure assets would be spun off from its core DISH network satellite-TV service, which features 13.6 million subscribers, in a tax-free deal. Its shares closed up $2.82 to $44.14.\n\nThe news came only hours after EchoStar agreed to buy Sling Media, whose set-top box technology allows consumers to shift their TV signal to mobile and broadband devices anywhere in the world, for $380 million in cash.\n\nPart of the reason for so much investor enthusiasm over the spin-off is because it theoretically makes an acquisition of EchoStar’s TV business by AT&T or another suitor easier to digest.\n\nRumors have swirled about a potential deal for EchoStar for years, particularly with AT&T, though analysts believe nothing is imminent and are unclear as to whether CEO Charlie Ergen is even a willing seller.\n\nUnder the spin-off plan, the technology unit would house EchoStar’s set-top box design and manufacturing business, its international operations and other infrastructure services. Sling would also be included as part of this division and count as one of its main revenue-generating assets."
