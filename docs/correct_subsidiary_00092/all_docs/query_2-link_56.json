        "text": "DISH Network Corporation (DISH, an acronym for Digital Sky Highway[1]) is an American television provider and the owner of the direct-broadcast satellite provider Dish, commonly known as Dish Network, and the over-the-top IPTV service, Sling TV. Additionally, Dish offers mobile wireless service, Dish Wireless. On July 1, 2020, Dish acquired prepaid service Boost Mobile and intends to add postpaid service as well in the future.[2][3] Based out of unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado the company has approximately 16,000 employees.[4]\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn January 2008, EchoStar Communications Corporation, which was founded by Charlie Ergen as a satellite television equipment distributor in 1980, changed its name to DISH Network Corporation and spun off its technology arm as a new company named EchoStar Corporation.[5] The company had begun using DISH Network as its consumer brand in 1996,[6] after the launch of its first satellite, EchoStar I, in December 1995.[7] That launch marked the beginning of its subscription television services.[6]\n\nJoseph Clayton became president and chief executive officer of the company in June 2011, while Charlie Ergen remained chairman.[8] Clayton remained in the position until March 31, 2015, when he retired, leaving Ergen to resume the post.[9] Ergen has said diversifying and updating technology for the company will be a high priority, with an expectation that, over the coming decade, the company will provide internet, video, and telephone service for both home and mobile applications.[10] In December 2017, DISH Network announced that Ergen would step down and be replaced by Erik Carlson.[11]\n\nTemplate:As of, the company provided services to 13.7 million television and 580,000 broadband subscribers.[12]\n\nFounding and early growth[]\n\nDish Network began operations on March 4, 1996, as a service of EchoStar.[6] EchoStar was formed in 1980 by its chairman and chief executive officer, Charlie Ergen, along with colleagues Candy Ergen and Jim DeFranco, as a distributor of C-band satellite television systems.[13] In 1987, EchoStar applied for a direct-broadcast satellite broadcast license with the FCC and was granted access to orbital slot 119° west longitude in 1992.Template:Citation needed\n\nOn December 7, 2007, EchoStar announced it would spin off its technology and infrastructure assets into a separate company under the EchoStar name, after which the remainder of the company would be renamed DISH Network Corporation.[14] The spun-off EchoStar began trading on January 3, 2008.[15]\n\nAcquisitions and expansion[]\n\nIn 2011, Dish Network spent over $3 billion in acquisitions of companies in bankruptcy,[16] which The Motley Fool's Anders Bylund described as \"a veritable buying rampage in the bargain bin.\"[17] This includes the April 6, 2011, purchase of Blockbuster Inc. in a bankruptcy auction in New York, agreeing to pay $322 million in cash and assume $87 million in liabilities and other obligations for the nationwide video-rental company.[18] DISH Network also acquired the defunct companies DBSD and Terrestar.[16] Dish Network also made a bid to purchase Hulu in October 2011, but Hulu's owners chose not to sell the company.[19] There was also speculation that DISH Network might purchase Sprint Nextel or Clearwire.[20] In 2013, Dish made a bid for both companies. CEO Charles Ergen plans on adding wireless internet and mobile video servicesTemplate:When that can compete with Netflix and cable companies.[16] About the new markets, Ergen said, \"Given the assets we've been accumulating, I don't think it's hard to see we're moving in a different direction from simply pay-TV, which is a market that's becoming increasingly saturated.\"[16]\n\nDish Network put its Blockbuster acquisition to work by making available Dish Movie Pack for Dish Network subscribers and Sling TV for non-Dish Network subscribers. Blockbuster also has agreements that allow it to receive movies 28 days before Netflix and Redbox which could encourage customers to use these services.[16]\n\nDish Network also plans on offering high-speed internet.Template:When The company plans a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile broadband service. In 2011, it petitioned the FCC to combine the S-Band spectrum it acquired from DBSD and Terrestar, and combine this spectrum with LTE. Unlike LightSquared, Dish's spectrum has minimal risk of disrupting Global Positioning Systems.[21]\n\nAt the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show, Dish Network announced a corporate rebranding, under which the company would publicly refer to itself as just \"Dish\" rather than \"Dish Network\".[22]\n\nAfter changing the position of a satellite orbital position from being over Mexico to Brazil in 2011, Dish Network sought companies that could make a deal, among them Telefónica. However, nothing ever came of this, and DISH decided to enter the country itself. According to the Brazilian Agency of Telecommunications (Anatel), they awaited the authorization of the application.[23] In June 2019, nonetheless, DISH TV accepted to resign its satellite exploration rights assigned to EchoStar and thus ending the possibility of entering the Brazilian market.[24]\n\nOn July 26, 2019, Dish announced it had reached an agreement with T-Mobile and Sprint to sell Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, Sprint's prepaid businesses, for $1.4 billion to DISH Network. They will also sell Dish $3.6 billion of 800 MHz spectrum, Sprint's entire 800 MHz portfolio. DISH customers will be able to use the New T-Mobile Network for seven years. DISH and T-Mobile are currently negotiating the lease of 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail stores being decommissioned by the New T-Mobile.[25] The deal for the purchase of all of Sprint's prepaid businesses, including Boost, officially closed on July 1, 2020.[2][3]\n\nOn May 20, 2019, EchoStar announced[26] that it had reached an agreement with DISH to transfer the portion of that company's business which managed and provided broadcast satellite services, referred to as the BSS (Broadcast Satellite Services) business, to DISH in order to concentrate on broadband services and other initiatives. The transaction was completed on September 10, 2019.[26]\n\nDisputes and lawsuits[]\n\nMain article: Criticism of Dish Network\n\nDISH and its subsidiaries have faced legal action for some of its questionable practices, including fines for telemarketing tactics such as failure to disclose fees with full transparency.[27][28][29][30]\n\nDISH has been sued and countersued dozens of times. DISH argues that effective litigation is important to corporate operations. One such lawsuit was DISH's use of their Hopper DVR to make it easy for viewers to erase commercials.[31]\n\nRemoval of regional sports programming[]\n\nDish Network has always refused to carry some of the higher-priced regional sports networks, most notably AT&T SportsNet Southwest, YES Network, and Spectrum SportsNet, which have never been available on Dish. The contract of the entire MSG Network had ended on October 1, 2010, early; CSN New England was dropped on August 6, 2014.[32] In July 2019 Dish removed the entire slate of Fox Sports Networks channels (which have since been re-branded as Bally Sports).[33] This was the beginning of a trend with Altitude being removed in August and NBC Sports Chicago in October of that year.[34] On April 1, 2021, Dish removed the remaining NBC Sports Regional Networks and the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. Dish Network president Brian Neylon commented that \"The current RSN model is fundamentally broken,” stating that he was in favor of offering the networks as an a la carte service.[35] Six months later (October 1, 2021), Dish removed entire AT&T SportsNet channel.[36][37]\n\nThe last remaining regional sports network, NESN was removed on December 20, 2021.[38]\n\nServices and devices[]\n\nYear Subscribers[39] 1996 350,000 1997 1,040,000 1998 1,900,000 1999 3,400,000 2000 5,260,000 2001 6,830,000 2002 8,180,000 2003 9,425,000 2004 10,905,000 2005 12,040,000 2006 13,105,000 2007 13,780,000 2008 13,678,000 2009 14,100,000 2010 14,133,000 2011 13,967,000 2012 14,056,000 2013 14,057,000 2014 13,978,000 2015 13,897,000 2016 13,671,000 2017 13,242,000 2018 12,322,000 2019 11,986,000 2020 11,290,000 2021 10,707,000\n\nDISH's main service is satellite television and its offerings are comparable to other satellite and cable companies. Viewers can choose from a series of service bundles, paying more money for more channels. A la carte programming is available, however limited to premium channels such as HBO or Showtime. The company is currently working on diversifying its offerings. With its purchase of Blockbuster LLC, DISH owns the Blockbuster trademarks and has used its intellectual property agreement to offer streaming and mail-order video services.\n\nDishNET[]\n\nSee also: Satellite Internet access On September 27, 2012, DISH Network announced a satellite broadband service called DishNET, aimed at rural areas where cable is often not available.[40]\n\nWireless[]\n\nIn 2019, DISH entered an agreement as part of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger in which DISH would acquire Sprint's prepaid wireless businesses, including Boost Mobile.[41] As part of this agreement, DISH became the 4th-largest major wireless carrier in the United States.[42] After the merger was approved by the Justice Department, DISH announced plans to \"deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network capable of serving 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023.\"[42]\n\nOn July 1, 2020, DISH officially purchased Boost Mobile from T-Mobile for $1.4 billion.[43] With this purchase it officially launched its wireless business, DISH Wireless, LLC, offering prepaid service through the Boost brand as an MVNO on the T-Mobile network.[2] DISH stated intentions to offer branded postpaid service in the future with the build-out of their own network.[2] DISH also intends to have the first standalone, 5G-only network in the United States.[2]\n\nOn July 19, 2021, DISH signed a $5 billion contract with AT&T and becoming a new AT&T MVNO within approximately two years. As a result, DISH Wireless customers will be able to roam on AT&T's 4G and 5G while DISH is continuously building its 5G-only network. The previous roaming agreement with T-Mobile remained unchanged.[44]\n\nOn May 4, 2022, Dish announced it had released its 5G network live to consumers in Las Vegas in addition to listing 113 cities for the next phase of roll out by the end of June. The service named \"Project Genesis\" is currently only compatible with the latest Motorola Edge Plus.[45]\n\nOnTech Smart Services[]\n\nDISH launched the direct-to-consumer smart home technology brand OnTech Smart Services in 2019; initially available in 11 metropolitan areas, the brand offers smart home devices and installation services.[46]\n\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency[]\n\nDISH has been described as the first large company to accept cryptocurrency and being “comfortable with cryptocurrency”. The company has accepted Bitcoin since 2014. Four years later in began accepting Bitcoin Cash. In September 2021, it announced a partnership with Input Output Global (formerly known as IOHK) to build subscription services based on the Cardano blockchain.[47] The following month it set up a system to expand 5G mobile network through customers using the Citizens Broadband Radio Service with rewards paid in cryptocurrency.[48]\n\nCharitable causes[]\n\nDISH Cares was launched in 2014 and focuses on community engagement, sustainability, and providing services following disasters.[49] The company has engaged in disaster relief efforts, including after Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Irma, and Maria.[50][51][52]\n\nTechnical information[]\n\nBroadcast technology[]\n\nFor years DISH used standard MPEG-2 for broadcasting, but the addition of bandwidth-intensive HDTV called for a change to the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC system. DISH announced that, from February 1, 2006, all new HDTV channels would be available in H.264 format only, while maintaining the current lineup as MPEG-2. The company intended to convert the entire platform to H.264 to provide more channels to subscribers. In 2007, DISH Network reduced the resolution of 1080-line channels from 1920x1080 to 1440x1080. Reducing the horizontal resolution and/or data rate of HD video is known as HD Lite and is done by other TV providers as well.Template:Citation needed\n\nBoth a standard receiver and a receiver with built-in digital video recorder (DVR) were available to subscribers.[53] The DISH Network ViP722 HD DVR replacement for the ViP622 received generally positive reviews.[54] It could record up to 350 hours of standard-definition (SD) broadcasts, or 55 hours of high-definition (HD). These set-top boxes (STBs) allow for HD on the primary TV and SD on the secondary TV (TV2) without a secondary box on TV2.\n\nReceivers and devices[]\n\nEarlier satellite dishes[]\n\nDISH Network's first satellite antenna was simply called the \"DISH Network\" dish. It was retroactively named the \"DISH 300\" when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming DISH 500 systems. It uses one LNB to obtain signals from the 119°W orbital location,[55] and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional high-definition or international programming from either the 148°W or 61.5°W orbital locations.[56][57] The 119°W slot is one of two primary orbital locations, the other being 110°W, that provide core services.[58][59]\n\nAfter EchoStar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between ASkyB and MCI WorldCom, it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110°W orbital location. Since EchoStar also owned the adjacent 119°W orbital location it developed the DISH 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative dual-LNB assembly. Although the new 20-inch DISH 500 was slightly larger than the then-current 18-inch DISH 300 and DirecTV dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from EchoStar's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500-channel capacity. The DISH 500, as a result, provided very large capacity for local-into-local service, nationwide programming, and business services. In order to migrate existing customers to DISH 500, DISH Network provided value-added channels in addition to local channels that could only be received with the DISH 500 and newer systems. Some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems were H2, Boomerang, Science, Planet Green, PBS Kids Sprout and Comedy Central.\n\nTailgater[]\n\nTailgater is a portable satellite antenna; the tailgater can be purchased as a standalone device for $350. The Tailgater is now being supported by a Wally receiver, to replace the still supported 211k model. Customers only need pay for the period of time where the receiver is active on the account, monthly cost for a Vip211k or Wally is $7 per month, if the receiver is the only one on the account, there is no charge.[60] It weighs ten pounds, is protected from weather, and automatically searches for a signal. The only satellites that are currently compatible with the Tailgater are at DISH's 119 (SD/HD TV), 110 (SD/HD TV), and 129 (SD/HD TV) orbital slots.[61]\n\nWally[]\n\nThe Wally is a solo-receiver without a built in digital video recorder (DVR).\n\nHopper and Joey[]\n\nMain article: Hopper (DVR)\n\nHopper is a line of multi-tuner set-top boxes first introduced in 2012; they are digital video recorders that can be networked with accompanying \"Joey\" set-top boxes for multi-room access to recordings. DISH Network subsequently introduced updated versions of the Hopper, including Hopper with Sling (which adds integrated placeshifting capabilities), and the Hopper 3, which features 4K support and 16 tuners. Hopper supports a voice-activated remote,[62][63][64][65][66][67] as well as Amazon Echo and Google Home integration.[68][69]\n\nApps[]\n\nDISH Anywhere\n\nDISH Anywhere is DISH's subscriber-only streaming video service. The DISH Anywhere app combines Sling broadcast technology and internet to bring subscribers DISH content wherever they are.[70] It also pairs with DISH On Demand, a library that has over 80,000 movies and shows.[71]\n\nAs of late 2018, HBO and Cinemax were no longer available for DISH customers due to Contract disputes.[72] However, Dish returned HBO and Cinemax programming as of August 2021 [1].\n\nSling TV[]\n\nMain article: Sling TV\n\nIn May 2012, DISH launched DISHWorld, a subscription-based over-the-top streaming IPTV service, as an app on Roku devices, offering access to over 50 international television channels via broadband streaming.[73]\n\nIn 2014, DISH Network began to reach carriage deals with broadcasters for a new over-the-top service that would be aimed towards cord cutters as a low-cost alternative to traditional pay television.[74] On January 5, 2015, DISH Network officially unveiled Sling TV, an over-the-top IPTV service designed to complement subscription video on-demand services such as Hulu and Netflix.[75]\n\nSome broadcasters have been hesitant about over-the-top services such as Sling TV, showing concern that they may undermine their carriage deals with larger conventional cable, satellite and Internet TV providers. Time Warner initially noted that the carriage of its channels on the service was only for a \"trial\" basis, while both Time Warner's CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and an analyst from the firm Macquarie Capital disclosed that current contract language in DISH's OTT carriage deals with the service's content distributors would cap the number of subscribers that the service is allowed to have at any given time to 5 million. Neither DISH Network or its content providers have confirmed any such cap.[76][77][78] As of January 2022, the service has reached 2.49 million subscribers.[79]\n\nSatellite fleet[]\n\nUntil 2019, most of the satellites used by DISH Network were owned and operated by EchoStar Corporation. DISH frequently moves satellites among its many orbiting slots so this list may not be accurate. Refer to Lyngsat and DISH Channel Chart for detailed satellite information.\n\nDISH Network satellites Satellite Location (degrees west) Launched Type Notes EchoStar I 77 Template:Dts Lockheed Martin Astro Space Series 7000 (AS-7000) Can carry a limited number of services on odd numbered transponders.

It largely serves as a placeholder for EchoStar slots. EchoStar V Deorbited from 148 Template:Dts Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 EchoStar V was moved from 110 to 129 and finally to 148. International programming at 148 has moved to Anik F3/118.75°. Locals have moved to spot beams at other locations. The satellite was to serve as a placeholder for EchoStar at the 148 slot. The satellite was experiencing stability issues that made signal levels unstable for the short time it was located at 148. On July 31, 2009, all remaining programming at 148 ceased. Factors now indicate discontinuation of the 148 slot, at least for the short term, 3–4 years. EchoStar VI 77 Template:Dts Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 Replaces EchoStar VIII. EchoStar VII 119 Template:Dts Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space A2100AX CurrentlyTemplate:When an on orbit spare. Provides DISH Network's spot beam services to the western United States, as well as Muzak programming to businesses on leased bandwidth. EchoStar VIII 77 Template:Dts Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 Formerly at 110. On January 30, 2011, the satellite experienced a single event upset and drifted out of its intended orbit, this required all services to be relocated to other available satellite capacity in the Eastern Arc. One week later some services were restored, but the satellite is expected to be taken out of service again and replaced temporarily by EchoStar VI in order to conduct further testing. EchoStar X 110 Template:Dts Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space A2100AXS First seen functioning May 2006 in the 110.0W slot and is still transmitting from the same location as of October 2016. EchoStar XI 110 Template:Dts Space Systems/Loral LS-1300 EchoStar XII 61.5 Template:Dts Lockheed Martin AS-2100 Originally known as Rainbow 1, this satellite was launched by Cablevision/Rainbow DBS and used for the Voom DBS service at 61.5° W until the satellite and transponder licenses were sold to EchoStar in 2005. Renamed EchoStar 12 in March 2006. Currently only used for spot beam capabilities. Echostar XIV 119 Template:Dts Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 Replaced Echostar VII. EchoStar XIV launched on an International Launch Services Proton/Breeze M vehicle from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Resides at an altitude of 22,000 miles.

Anik F3 is leased by DISH from Telesat Canada to serve CONUS customers. It broadcasts on non-DBS FSS frequencies (~11.7-12.2 GHz) using circular polarity (the only satellite serving the United States in this mode). It permanently replaces AMC-16, which was temporarily placed at 118.75° W due to delays in Anik F3 production. AMC-16 moved back to 85° W when Anik F3 was fully operational. A primarily international satellite with international channels once on 61.5, 121, or 148. Ciel-2 129 Template:Dts Thales Alenia Space Spacebus-4000C4 Replaced EchoStar V at the 129°W orbital location. Owned by Canadian Ciel Satellite Group, DISH leases the entire bandwidth of the Ciel-2 satellite. Provides national HD programming and HD spot beam locals.

DISH leases the satellite's capacity.\n\nDish Wireless[]\n\nTemplate:Main otherScript error: No such module \"Check for clobbered parameters\".Script error: No such module \"Check for unknown parameters\".\n\nDish Wireless LLC is an American wireless network provider. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dish Network. Dish Wireless was founded on July 1, 2020. Its headquarters is located in Littleton, Colorado.[82][83] Dish Wireless is the fourth-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with 8.2 million subscribers as of the end of Q1 2022.[84]\n\nDish Wireless provides wireless voice and data services in the United States under the Boost Mobile brand and will provide services under its own brand after its network is built. Dish Wireless is currently using T-Mobile's network for 7 years due to an agreement between Dish and T-Mobile. Dish Wireless is in the process of building their own 5G network which will be the Template:Clarify in the United States. Dish is committed to the FCC on covering 70% of Americans with 5G by the end of June 2023.[85]\n\nDish Wireless acquired Boost Mobile on July 1, 2020,[2][3] Ting Mobile on August 1, 2020,[86] Republic Wireless on March 8, 2021,[87][88] and Gen Mobile on September 1, 2021.[89]\n\nOn July 19, 2021, Dish Wireless announced a network services agreement with AT&T, which includes a 10-year roaming agreement, and the option for AT&T to use Dish's wireless spectrum on their network.[90] The agreement is non-exclusive, and Dish will continue to use T-Mobile's network in addition to AT&T's until that agreement expires in 2027.[91]\n\nRadio Frequency Spectrum Chart[]\n\nFurther information: 5G NR frequency bands\n\nThe following is a list of known frequencies that Dish Wireless employs or plans to employ in the United States.\n\nFrequencies on the Dish Wireless Network Frequency Band Band number Protocol Generation Status Notes 600 MHz DD n71 NR 5G Active/Building Out[92] Network launched in trial in November 2020.[93] Licenses cover 100% of the continental United States.[94] 700 MHz Lower SMH Block E n29 Supplemental downlink only. 1.7/2.1 GHz AWS n66 Active/Building Out[95][92] Combination of Dish's unpaired AWS-3, PCS-H, and AWS-4 holdings.[96][97] n70 3.4 GHz C-Band n77 Pending deployment Licenses cover 100% of the continental United States.
