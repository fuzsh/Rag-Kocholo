        "text": "EchoStar Corporation completed its acquisition of Dish Network to close out 2023 on Dec. 31. The deal, first announced in August, combines Dish Network’s satellite technology, streaming services, and nationwide 5G network with EchoStar’s satellite communications solutions, which EchoStar said will create a leader in terrestrial and non-terrestrial wireless connectivity.\n\nDish Network is now a wholly owned subsidiary of EchoStar. The merger brings the companies back together — Dish was developed as part of EchoStar and spun out in 2008. The combined company is headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. Its brands include Boost Mobile, Boost Infinite, Sling TV and DISH TV, as well as EchoStar, Hughes and Jupiter satellite services, HughesON managed services and HughesNet satellite internet.\n\nHamid Akhavan is president and CEO of the combined company EchoStar, with Charles Ergen serving as executive chairman.\n\n“This merger brings us one step closer to our goal of offering ubiquitous connectivity to people, enterprises and things, everywhere,” Akhavan said. “Together we’re better positioned to realize the connected future by leveraging every type of transport, combined with smart, enabling technologies and fully integrated services.”\n\nLeaders pitched the value of satellite and wireless technologies, including Dish’s 5G wireless network that covers 70% of the U.S. and Hughes satellite capacity, now with Jupiter 3 in service.\n\n“We have brought together two trailblazing companies with complementary portfolios to create a global connectivity leader with premier wireless, satellite, and video distribution capabilities. Together, EchoStar and DISH offer an enhanced consumer connectivity business and an unmatched enterprise managed services business. In a world that is increasingly wireless, we are well-positioned to drive revenue and profitable growth,” Ergen commented."
