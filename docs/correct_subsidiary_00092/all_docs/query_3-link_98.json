        "text": "Dish Network, The Trump Era ‘Fix’ For The Sprint T-Mobile Merger, Heads Into Its Final Death Spiral\n\nfrom the pointless-distraction dept\n\nAging satellite TV provider Dish Network is supposed to be undergoing a major transformation from tired old satellite TV provider to streaming and wireless juggernaut. It was a cornerstone of a Trump administration FCC and DOJ plan to cobble together a new wireless carrier out of twine and vibes as a counter-balance to the competition-eroding T-Mobile and Sprint merger.\n\nIt’s… not going well. All of the problems critics of the T-Mobile and Sprint merger predicted (layoffs, price hikes, lest robust competition) have come true. Meanwhile Dish has been bleeding satellite TV, wireless, and streaming TV subscribers for a while (last quarter the company lost another 314,000 TV subscribers, including 249,000 satellite TV subs and 65,000 Sling TV customers).\n\nDish’s new 5G network has also generally been received as a sort of half-hearted joke. Dish also lost 123,000 prepaid wireless subscribers last quarter; it can’t pay its debt obligations, can’t afford to buy the spectrum it was supposed to acquire as part of the Sprint/T-Mobile merger arrangement; and expanding its half-cooked 5G network looks tenuous at best.\n\nLast year Dish proposed merging with Echostar in a bid to distract everybody from the company’s ongoing mess. They’ve also tried to goose stock valuations by hinting at an equally doomed merger with DirecTV. But those distractions didn’t help either, and there are increasing worries among belatedly aware analysts that this all ends with bankruptcy and a pile of rubble:\n\n“MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett offered a blunt assessment of the company’s future based on Dish’s deteriorating pay-TV and mobile subscriber customer base: “Dish’s business is spiraling towards bankruptcy. Gradually, then all at once, the declines are gathering speed,” he wrote in a research note.”\n\nFrom 2019 or so I noted that this whole mess was likely a doomed effort, primarily designed to provide cover for an anti-competitive, job-killing wireless merger. It always seemed likely to me that Dish (which had never built a wireless network) would string FCC regulators along for a few years before selling off its valuable spectrum assets and whatever half-assed 5G network it had managed to construct.\n\nDespite this, trade magazines that cover the telecom industry tried desperately to pretend this was all a very serious adult venture, despite zero indication anyone involved had any idea what they were doing. And the deal rubber stamping and circular logic used to justify it ran in very stark contrast to the ongoing pretense that we supposedly care about “antitrust reform.”\n\nUltimately Dish will make a killing on spectrum, the FCC will fine them a relative pittance for failing to meet the flimsy build requirements affixed to the merger conditions, and Dish CEO Charlie Ergen will trot off into the sunset on a giant pile of money. Some giant player like Verizon will then swoop in to gobble up what’s left of the wreckage, and the industry will consolidate further (the whole point)\n\nThe regulatory impact of approving Sprint/T-Mobile, which consolidated the U.S. wireless market from four to three major providers (jacking up prices and killing off thousands of jobs), will be forgotten, and the regulators and officials behind the entire mess will have long ago moved on to other terrible, short-sighted ideas.\n\nFiled Under: 5g, antitrust, competition, fcc, job cuts, john legere, regulators, telecom, wireless\n\nCompanies: dish\n\nBehold Ongoing Merger ‘Synergies’: T-Mobile Lays Off Another 5,000 Employees\n\nfrom the merge-ALL-the-things! dept\n\nFormer T-Mobile CEO John Legere repeatedly promised in print that the Sprint merger would result in a massive surge in new jobs. In a rambling missive that took aim at deal critics predicting job losses, the charming, potty-mouthed ex-CEO proclaimed that critics were lying, and that the deal would be “job positive from day one” and every day thereafter.\n\nOf course, that’s not how telecom industry consolidation actually works.\n\nWithin just a few years Sprint had already laid off around 9,500 employees at Sprint and T-Mobile. And now the company has announced that it’s laying off another 5,000 employees. As is routine for industry-cozy business news outlets like CNBC, the merger isn’t even mentioned in stories announcing the news. Instead, the layoffs are blamed on “adding more subscribers in a competitive market”:\n\n“T-Mobile US said on Thursday it would reduce its workforce by about 7% by cutting 5,000 jobs in the United States as the wireless carrier grapples with rising costs related to adding more subscribers in a competitive market.”\n\nCNBC is happy to help T-Mobile pretend that the layoffs are necessary due to the inflation bogeyman. In reality, these layoffs were an inevitable streamlining of redundancies caused by industry consolidation. For those playing along at home, that’s nearly 15,000 layoffs since Legere proclaimed the deal would be “job positive on day one and every day thereafter.”\n\nLegere’s 2019 post still sits there like a turd on the T-Mobile website, showing you precisely how worried T-Mobile is about being held accountable for having lied to the press, public, and regulators.\n\nTelecom experts, academics, and consumer groups like the EFF warned repeatedly that reducing the number of major competitors in wireless from four to three would result in higher prices and layoffs. They weren’t just playing predictive patty cake: in nearly every country where regulators approved such a deal, they observed that layoffs and price hikes were always quick to follow.\n\nI’ve covered the telecom sector for twenty-plus years, and mindless consolidation and such megadeals always result in a less competitive market, higher prices, layoffs, and eventually a lower quality product. It’s simply not debatable, however much the industry and its various proxies like to pretend otherwise. As I wrote at The Verge in 2019 T-Mobile’s promises on this front were utterly meaningless.\n\nIn addition to the layoffs, the lion’s share of T-Mobile’s aggressive, consumer-friendly posturing has largely disappeared. The company’s “uncarrier” events have grown increasingly boring to the point where nobody much notices when they do or don’t occur. At the same time, T-Mobile has largely stopped competing seriously on price, also precisely as deal critics predicted.\n\nYou could also argue the merger distracted T-Mobile from more important things like securing its network, given the company has been hacked and seen consumer data compromised more than eight times in just the last five years.\n\nIf you recall, the Trump era “fix” for this reduced competition (in reality a hollow ploy to justify consolidation) was to try and cobble together a replacement fourth wireless carrier out of Dish Network. I also predicted that deal would be doomed, and my batting average is looking pretty good.\n\nMindless consolidation, “growth for growth’s sake,” and pointless megamergers may thrill short term Wall Street investors and overpaid executives, but are profoundly harmful. But instead of addressing that harm head on, press coverage (again, see: CNBC, CNN) often completely ignores the role of consolidation entirely, ensuring we learn nothing from experience as deal backers perpetually avoid accountability.\n\nFiled Under: 5g, competition, consolidation, high speed internet, jobs, john legere, layoffs, mergers, synergies, wireless\n\nCompanies: sprint, t-mobile\n\nT-Mobile Has Axed 9,501 Employees Since Its 2018 ‘Job Creating’ Merger Was Announced\n\nfrom the who-could-have-possibly-predicted-this dept\n\nFormer T-Mobile CEO John Legere repeatedly promised in print that the Sprint merger would result in a massive surge in new jobs. In a rambling missive that took aim at critics of the deal, who predicted job losses, the charming potty-mouth CEO proclaimed that critics were lying, and that the deal would be “job positive from day one” and every day thereafter.\n\nYeah, about that.\n\nThe latest tally by industry watchers indicates that 9,501 employees have lost their jobs since the two companies merged, with thousands of those cuts happening before the deal ink was even dry. This is of course what always happens with “growth for growth’s sake” consolidation, but it’s rare we look backward to meaningfully address such claims lest we learn something from experience.\n\n9,500 jobs have now disappeared across T-Mobile and Sprint since their deal was first announced in 2018. That’s 12% of the total back then, a figure that would be high even if the companies had not promised to be job creators. The message from Legere, designed to win over competition authorities and opponents, had been unequivocal. “This merger is all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the New T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter,” he said.\n\nT-Mobile isn’t quite the competitor it used to be either, now that the total number of wireless carriers have shrunk from four to three. Gone are the truly disruptive “uncarrier” announcements, and in their place is another perfectly ordinary wireless giant that tries its best to avoid competing directly on price, as it tries to find creative new ways to impose annoying fees.\n\nIt’s 2023 and the “uncarrier” still can’t secure its wireless network from hackers, is still trying to fight a wrist slap fine for playing fast and loose with user location data, and is still lying about its 5G coverage to grab government subsidies it may not deserve.\n\nThe merger certainly made former CEO John Legere an even wealthier man, and it certainly paid out for investors as the huge spectrum holdings allow it to fend off the other two industry giants in the 5G coverage race. But as somebody that has covered telecom mergers for a long time, it’s still positively stunning how little we learn from experience where megadeal employment promises are concerned.\n\nFiled Under: 5g, competition, consolidation, fcc, jobs, john legere, megamergers, telecom, wireless\n\nCompanies: t-mobile\n\n5,000 T-Mobile Employees Lost Their Jobs Post-Merger While Ex-CEO John Legere Saw A $137 Million Golden Parachute\n\nfrom the uncarrier-no-more dept\n\nTo be clear, former T-Mobile CEO John Legere did some amazing things with T-Mobile. After regulators blocked AT&T from acquiring T-Mobile in 2011 (which wound up being a very good thing), he took the $3 billion break up fee and turned an also-ran into a major thorn in the side of AT&T and Verizon. Legere accomplished this by (gasp) generally treating consumers well, eliminating annoyances like long-term contracts, sneaky fees, and many other telecom industry mainstays. He also did it by embracing an entertaining, wise ass persona in an industry not known for having a sense of humor.\n\nBut then, T-Mobile owners Deutsche Telekom decided it would be a good idea to throw all of this away by pursuing a $26 billion merger with Sprint. That suddenly forced Legere into a position where he had to behave exactly like the companies he’d just spent a decade making fun of. That included lying a lot about the benefits of the deal as the company tried to sell the Trump administration on the competition and job-eroding megadeal (that wound up not being particularly difficult, since the industry-allied Trump FCC and DOJ didn’t care about hard data).\n\nTechnically, Legere only worked for three months in 2020, but nabbed a $137 million exit package according to new data:\n\n“Legere’s 2020 compensation was revealed yesterday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (see pages 49 and 50). Legere was previously paid $27.8 million in the full year of 2019 and $66.5 million in 2018, mostly in the form of stock awards. His 2020 compensation of $137.2 million did not include any stock awards?instead, it consisted of a $136.55 million severance payment, $600,000 in salary, and $50,000 in reimbursement for legal fees.”\n\nLegere certainly had a comfy exit, also offloading his $17.5 million Central Park West apartment to Giorgio Armani on his way out of town.\n\nOf course, you’re supposed to ignore (and most of the US press certainly will) the fact that Legere repeatedly promised in print that the Sprint merger would result in a massive surge in new jobs. That never happens in the wake of telecom consolidation, and soon enough, the company was busy laying off 5,000 employees. Unions and Wall Street analysts predict the layoffs could get as high as 15-30,000 as redundant positions are inevitably eliminated over the next few years.\n\nOf course, there was always ample evidence that Legere’s brash, pink high-top wearing trash talking persona was more caricature than reality. After all, Legere supported the FCC’s decision to lobotomize its consumer protection authority, opposed net neutrality, and mocked the EFF when they pointed out the company was lying. But the mask really slipped during the merger sales pitch, which not only involved lying constantly about the benefits of the deal, but hiring Trump ally Corey Lewandowski, and throwing cash at Trump’s DC hotel to improve merger approval chances.\n\nGiven the Sprint merger reduced US wireless sector competition by 25%, and the FCC currently has its hands tied behind its back due to the net neutrality repeal, which T-Mobile supported (which again neutered most FCC authority, not just net neutrality rules), it’s inevitable that investors now pressure T-Mobile to behave more and more like AT&T and Verizon over the next few years. That means more empty promises, more efforts to nickel-and-dime subscribers, and a steadily eroding effort to seriously compete on price. All the stuff Legere repeatedly insisted he was opposed to. That’s not speculation or opinion, it’s what happens every time a country decides to give a middle finger to competition by allowing mindless consolidation in telecom. There are 40 years of indisputable evidence.\n\nAgain, Legere deserves all the praise in the world for turning T-Mobile into a heavyweight champion in wireless. But at the same time, he also deserves ample criticism for the ease in which he was willing to throw all of that in the toilet, and the grotesque amount of falsehoods and Trump ass kissing that accompanied the effort along the way.\n\nFiled Under: broadband, competition, jobs, john legere, lies, mergers, promises, wireless\n\nCompanies: sprint, t-mobile\n\nT-Mobile Promised Major Job Growth Post Sprint Merger. SEC Filings Show The Exact Opposite Happened\n\nfrom the Charlie-Brown-and-Lucy-Football dept\n\nWhen T-Mobile was selling its $26 billion Sprint merger to regulators, it told anybody who’d listen that the deal would create a parade of new jobs. In a 2019 blog post that still hasn’t been deleted (amateur move, guys), ex-T-Mobile CEO John Legere didn’t mince words in his predictions:\n\n“So, let me be really clear on this increasingly important topic. This merger is all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the New T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter. That?s not just a promise. That?s not just a commitment. It?s a fact.”\n\n“…These combined efforts will create nearly 5,600 new American customer care jobs by 2021.”\n\n2021 is here, and a recent SEC filing shows that the company has actually lost about 5,000 jobs in a little under a year and a half. That number could potentially be even higher. As noted last April, T-Mobile quickly set about immediately shuttering its Metro prepaid division (a decision that had nothing to do with COVID), resulting in an estimated 6,000 layoffs (something T-Mobile said wouldn’t happen). Last June, the company fired hundreds of additional Sprint employees during a conference call that lasted all of six minutes.\n\nThere’s likely more where that came from, as the company is still operating dual headquarters in both the Pacific Northwest and Overland Park, Kansas. In most mergers like this, the acquiring company tries to keep things the same for about a year to keep folks calm before the hatchets are unveiled.\n\nOf course, this is all something that consumer groups, antitrust experts, unions, and even Wall Street stock jocks predicted. Most of those folks predicted that, even though it would take time, the deal would eliminate anywhere between 10,000 and 30,000 jobs. That’s in addition to their complaints that the deal effectively reduced US wireless competition by 25% via 4-3 carrier consolidation, something that historically always, sooner or later, results in higher prices for consumers (see: Canada, Ireland, Germany).\n\nGranted in his original blog post, Legere made fun of those critics and insisted they were simply making shit up:\n\n“I guess if the real numbers don?t tell the story you want, you can just make up new ones? It?s actually offensive.”\n\nYes, accurate predictions are so offensive. Granted John Legere, who successfully built T-Mobile from an also-ran into a major competitor (thanks in part to regulators blocking AT&T’s 2011 merger with T-Mobile), was quick to leave the company shortly after the deal, offloading his Central Park West Penthouse to Giorgio Armani for $17.5 million (how many employee jobs is that?). And as Light Reading notes, T-Mobile’s revenues continue to soar as it continues job cuts it promised wouldn’t happen:\n\n“In 2015, T-Mobile was making about $650,000 per employee. Last year, it generated almost $912,000. For workers at the company, that is not a source of comfort.”\n\nGranted this happens absolutely every time there’s a major telecom merger. Companies throw out bullshit job growth claims, knowing full well such consolidation inevitably will result in massive job cuts a year or two later as redundant positions are eliminated. The press hypes the false merger “synergy” claims, then (usually) can’t be bothered to follow up with reports highlighting how the promises were empty. It’s a massive ouroboros of dysfunction, and no matter how many times we live through the exact same experience (AT&T’s countless mergers, Verizon’s countless mergers, Comcast’s repeated mergers), America has a severe allergy to learning absolutely anything from experience.\n\nMindless consolidation and “growth for growth’s sake” hurts employees, markets, and consumers. Full stop. Regulators could have forced Sprint to find another suitor, preferably one that didn’t result in a loss of overall competitors (Dish, Comcast, Charter, Google, Amazon). Instead we signed off on another massive deal, based on a parade of false promises. Then, in two or three years when US wireless prices (already some of the highest in the developed world) are even higher, everybody will stand around with a dumb look on their faces wondering how exactly we got this point. Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nFiled Under: competition, hiring, jobs, john legere, lies, merger, mobile service\n\nCompanies: sprint, t-mobile\n\nYet More Layoffs Hit Sprint/T-Mobile, Despite Promises This Assuredly Wouldn't Happen\n\nfrom the refusing-to-learn-from-experience dept\n\nBefore regulators signed off on T-Mobile’s $26 billion merger with Sprint, executives like former CEO John Legere told anybody who’d listen that the merger would create oodles of new jobs from “day one.” With the ink barely dry on the deal, it’s abundantly clear that’s not happening.\n\nLast month, T-Mobile laid off an estimated 6,000 employees from its Metro prepaid division, layoffs that had everything to do with the merger, and nothing to do with the COVID-19 crisis. And on June 15th, hundreds of Sprint employees were unceremoniously fired as part of a six minute conference call during which nobody was allowed to ask questions:\n\n“In a conference call on Monday lasting under six minutes, T-Mobile vice president James Kirby told hundreds of Sprint employees that their services were no longer needed. He declined to answer his employees? questions, citing the ?personal? nature of employee feedback, and ended the call.”\n\nCool. Cool.\n\nThis was all ridiculously predictable. There’s 40 years of documented US telecom history showing that the elimination of a major competitor reduces competition and raises prices (oh hi, Comcast). Global markets (Canada, Ireland) have also made this clear. Such deals almost universally result in thousands of layoffs as redundant retail, support, and management positions are culled. It’s why similar deals of this type (AT&T’s 2011 acquisition of T-Mobile, T-Mobile’s 2014 acquisition of Sprint) were blocked. This isn’t a debate topic. It’s not a murky subject. Telecom consolidation routinely ends badly for employees and customers.\n\nEconomists made all of these points to the DOJ and FCC, but they were unceremoniously ignored. First by an FCC that couldn’t bother to even read its own staff analysis before rubber stamping the a merger it helped cook up behind closed doors, then by a DOJ whose “antitrust” boss personally escorted the deal to fruition while ignoring all criticism.\n\nIf you go back and look at some of ex-CEO John Legere’s blog posts from a few months ago (which I’m sure won’t be around much longer), the CEO repeatedly promised that the merger would be “job positive” from “day one”:\n\n“So, let me be really clear on this increasingly important topic. This merger is all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the New T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter. That?s not just a promise. That?s not just a commitment. It?s a fact. To achieve what we?re setting out to do ? become the supercharged Un-carrier that delivers new value, ignites competition and delivers nationwide real 5G for All ? the New T-Mobile will provide an amazing and compelling set of services for consumers.”\n\nLegere was so breathlessly offended by statements to the contrary, he tried to insist that union officials were lying — before reminding everybody he testified under oath about the deal’s looming job explosion:\n\n“We also keep seeing the opposition try to use projected layoff numbers from an analyst?s projections that were based on a completely different deal at a completely different point in time to discredit this merger. It?s SO bad that the head of the Communications Workers Association (CWA) was bold enough to refer to those completely unrelated numbers in a CONGRESSIONAL HEARING. I guess if the real numbers don?t tell the story you want, you can just make up new ones? It?s actually offensive. At the hearings, I raised my right hand and swore under oath to tell the TRUTH… and the truth is that the New T-Mobile will CREATE JOBS.”\n\nIn the last two months alone we’ve seen 6,000+ non-Covid related layoffs and a 12 hour merger outage (purportedly due to merger integration headaches), so clearly everything is going swimmingly.\n\nFor T-Mobile, the COVID-19 crisis comes at an opportune time. It will allow the company to blame any layoffs on the pandemic, even if industry insiders have made it clear the layoffs were inevitable and already in the works. Meanwhile, John Legere has since sold his $17.5 million NYC penthouse in NYC To Giorgio Armani, and is likely already hard at work on his next act, during which we’ll all pretend none of this ever happened. So as usual, we’ll learn absolutely nothing from mergermania history, leaving us to repeat the process all over again down the lane.\n\nFiled Under: competition, fcc, jobs, john legere, layoffs, mergers\n\nCompanies: sprint, t-mobile\n\nKnowing What Happens Next, T-Mobile CEO Legere Heads For The Exit\n\nfrom the getting-out-while-the-getting's-good dept\n\nWe’ve long noted that T-Mobile’s brand reputation as a feisty consumer-friendly disruptor is only really skin deep. While the T-Mobile of 2012 or so certainly added some much needed competition to the wireless sector (killing ETFs, eliminating long-term contracts, and eroding international roaming costs), more recently the company has started to look a lot like the bigger competitors (AT&T, Verizon) it pretends to be superior to. From mocking groups like the EFF to opposing net neutrality, the company isn’t all that different from the companies its brash CEO John Legere likes to make fun of.\n\nThe disconnect between the T-Mobile consumer friendly “uncarrier” brand and reality has proven particularly notable as T-Mobile and Sprint have kissed up to the Trump administration to gain regulatory approval for their controversial $26 billion megamerger.\n\nFrom hiring Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski days after he mocked a kid with Down Syndrome on TV, to trampling the Constitution’s emoluments clause by ramping up patronage of Trump’s DC hotel to get merger approval, it hasn’t been a pretty sight. Not a week goes by where Legere, who spent years mocking other companies’ “bullshit,” can’t be found making false promises related to the megadeal.\n\nWhile the deal has unsurprisingly received the DOJ (now run by former Verizon lawyer Bill Barr) and FCC (now run by former Verizon lawyer Ajit Pai) blessing thanks to T-Mobile’s relentless ass kissing, it still faces a looming lawsuit by a bipartisan coalition of 13 state AGs. Which makes it an interesting time for T-Mobile CEO John Legere to announce he’ll be leaving the company starting next May to be replaced by current T-Mobile COO Mike Sievert. Legere likely realizes it’s best to go out on top. He also likely realizes that he probably shouldn’t stick around to watch his company slowly become everything he claims to despise:\n\n“Modern T-Mobile was born from the remnants of the DOJ?s decision to block AT&T from buying T-Mobile in 2011. The blocking of the deal forced AT&T to pay a $4 billion break up fee, money then used to propel T-Mobile to success.\n\nIronically, a company born out of government opposition to wireless consolidation is now pushing for one of the most controversial megadeals in industry history. The shift, driven largely by T-Mobile majority owner Deutsche Telekom, forced Legere into a role that?s in stark contrast to the brash, consumer-friendly persona he?d built since 2012.”\n\nIf you’ve listened to economists, consumer groups, or 40 years of telecom history, it’s clear that eliminating just one of four wireless competitors is going to hurt competition, raise rates, and result in endless layoffs as duplicative positions are inevitably eliminated. Since Legere has been busy promising the exact opposite of that, it’s probably a good time to get while the getting’s good, before his entire branding persona–replete with cookbooks and magenta high tops–is exposed as superficial by the company’s inevitable thirst to take advantage of less competition than ever.\n\nFiled Under: john legere\n\nCompanies: t-mobile\n\nT-Mobile's 'Revolutionary' New TV Service Looks Like The Same Old Crap\n\nfrom the meet-the-new-boss... dept\n\nSo we’ve noted for a while that T-Mobile’s brand reputation as a fiesty consumer-friendly disruptor is only really skin deep. While the T-Mobile of a few years ago certainly added some much needed competition to the wireless sector at first, more recently the company has started to look a lot like the bigger competitors (AT&T, Verizon) it pretends to be superior to. From mocking groups like the EFF to opposing net neutrality, the company isn’t all that different from the companies its brash CEO likes to make fun of. Especially as it snuggles up to Trump to gain approval for a merger with that Sprint nobody asked for.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s promised efforts at “disruption” aren’t quite what they used to be either. The company’s long-hyped new TV service, for example, was unveiled this week and doesn’t appear to be much different from the traditional offerings the company had promised to supplant:\n\n“Ignoring the trend toward less or no hardware, T-Mobile is introducing TVision, a cookbook-size box that must be plugged into home broadband connections. The $100-a-month, in-home TV package will be offered in eight cities, starting with 150 channels, including local broadcasts and regional sports networks. Some streaming apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video will be loaded on the device, though they?ll require separate subscriptions. Premium channels like HBO will also cost extra.”\n\nIn short, T-Mobile appears to have simply re-invented the bloated cable TV bundle and cable box. That’s not likely to appeal to users who can simply go out and buy their own streaming hardware, then install a universe of independent streaming apps they can rotate in and out at their leisure. Of course entertaining T-Mobile CEO John Legere dressed the new product (which is basically just a reskinning of the pricey Layer3 TV service it acquired a few years back) as something substantively more revolutionary than it actually is:\n\nLegere has spent the last few years mercilessly mocking (often quite justly) both AT&T and Verizon’s own forays into video, only to release something that is just as droll. There’s not much here that’s likely to make much headway into the market, given the entire point of “cutting the cord” is to get away from expensive channel bundles and locked down set top boxes in the first place.\n\nWatching T-Mobile change over the next few years is going to be interesting. The company effectively built its brand on being a consumer ally that’s different from traditional, entrenched players. But as the company has pushed distortion after distortion in its bid to gain regulatory approval for its Sprint merger, it continues to prove that’s not really the case. And if the deal’s approved, the sudden 25% reduction in major competitors is going to open the door to less competition, higher prices, and less innovation–all of the things T-Mobile and CEO Legere profess to be breathlessly dedicated to.\n\nFiled Under: disruption, john legere, mobile phone service, tv service\n\nCompanies: t-mobile\n\nT-Mobile Still Pretending That Staying At Trump's DC Hotel Isn't An Obvious Ploy To Gain Merger Approval\n\nfrom the nothing-to-see-here dept\n\nIn a letter responding to Congressional inquiry, T-Mobile has confirmed that the company dramatically ramped up its patronage of Trump’s hotel in DC as it sought regulatory approval of its $26 billion merger with Sprint. A copy of the letter, obtained by the Washington Post, makes it clear that the company spent upwards of $195,000 at the property since it originally announced the telecom industry’s latest megadeal last April. That was a dramatic shift from the period of time before the deal was announced:\n\n“T-Mobile?s patronage of President Trump?s Washington hotel increased sharply after the announcement of its merger with its Sprint last April, with executives spending about $195,000 at the property since then, the company told congressional Democrats in a letter last month. Before news of the megadeal between rival companies broke on April 29, 2018, the company said, only two top officials from T-Mobile had ever stayed at Trump?s hotel, with one overnight stay each in August 2017.\n\nT-Mobile has also hired former Trump ally Corey Lewandowski and former FCC Commissioners Robert McDowell and Mignon Clyburn to “consult” on the deal and grease the wheels of approval. T-Mobile CEO John Legere has consistently tried to play this obvious attempt at pandering to Trump as just unrelated happenstance:\n\nAmusingly, Legere built his entire brand on being a “no bullshit” alternative to AT&T and Verizon. Yet here we are.\n\nAs Legere has attempted to sell the press, public, and regulators on the deal, he’s adopted many of his competitors’ worst habits. It’s been clearly documented in countries like Canada or Ireland that when you reduce the total number of major wireless competitors from four to three, it results in dramatically higher rates as the incentive to compete on price is proportionally reduced. Such telecom mergers almost always result in significant layoffs as redundant positions are eliminated. Wall Street predicts T-Mobile’s merger will be no different, eliminating anywhere between 10,000 and 30,000 jobs.\n\nThis is not alien territory. In US telecom, these megadeals almost uniformly make the sector worse, as your wallet can attest. Yet both Sprint and T-Mobile execs have engaged in the same old game of Charlie Brown and Lucy football, breathlessly insisting that this deal will somehow be different. At the same time, execs continue to pretend that kissing Trump’s ass by staying at his DC hotel isn’t an obvious lobbying strategy for the company:\n\n“While we understand that staying at Trump properties might be viewed positively by some and negatively by others, we are confident that the relevant agencies address the questions before them on the merits,” (T-Mobile) wrote.\n\nThat makes one of you. The Trump FCC has been a glorified rubber stamp for absolutely every pipe dream telecom lobbyists can cook up, be it killing popular net neutrality rules (something Legere supported) or literally weakening the definition of the word “competitive” to make life easier on the sector’s biggest players. While the DOJ is less certain (though still sounding likely from what I’ve heard), there’s zero doubt that the FCC will rubber stamp this merger, likely piggybacking on T-Mobile’s (false) tailor-made claims that the deal is essential if the United States doesn’t want to “fall behind” in the “race to 5G.”\n\nOnce Legere gets done bullshitting his way to merger approval, he’ll have to quickly pivot back again to pretending he’s the “no bullshit” alternative to the other major wireless carriers. But of course as just one of three remaining competitors, history has shown us time and time again how T-Mobile will have less incentive than ever to seriously compete on price, and will, sooner or later, come to resemble AT&T and Verizon in all the wrong ways.\n\nFiled Under: donald trump, john legere, lobbying, merger, trump hotel, washington dc\n\nCompanies: sprint, t-mobile\n\nT-Mobile Tries To Save Its Unpopular Merger With A Few Concessions, But Nobody's Buying\n\nfrom the ill-communication dept\n\nSprint and T-Mobile have been facing some increased scrutiny of their claim that merging and reducing the total number of major wireless competitors from four to three will be a wonderful thing for both consumers and the wireless market. New York and California regulators in particular have apparently been pushing back a little at the idea that more consolidation is what’s needed in a largely consolidated and anti-competitive telecom sector:\n\nYou might recall that the companies’ previous merger attempt was blocked in 2014 after regulators noted that removing one of just four major carriers would result in a proportionally-lower incentive to actually compete on price. That’s really not debatable if you’ve paid attention to telecom and broadband industry history (it’s a major reason why we all loathe Comcast). That’s especially true in Canada, where consolidation to just three players has resulted in the highest mobile data prices in the developed world. AT&T’s attempt to acquire T-Mobile in 2011 was blocked for the same reason, a move that many forget (some intentionally) resulted in T-mobile being more competitive than ever.\n\nThis week, T-Mobile attempted to salvage the deal by offering up a few concessions. In a letter to FCC boss Ajit Pai (pdf), T-Mobile CEO John Legere proclaimed that the agency should ignore critics of the deal, since they’re “largely” employed by “big cable and big telco”:\n\n“Critics of our merger, largely employed by Big Telco and Big Cable, have principally argued that we are going to raise rates right after the merger closes. I want to reiterate, unequivocally, that New T-Mobile rates are NOT going to go up. Rather, our merger will ensure that American consumers will pay less and get more.\n\nOf course that’s nonsense. Every major consumer group (you know, the people paid very little to actually try and represent consumers) oppose the deal. And it’s not just critics saying that greater consolidation in wireless will raise rates. It’s history. You can, if the option is available to you, ask a Canadian how reducing the wireless sector’s total carriers from four to three works out for both competition and the end user. This kind of rhetoric only exemplifies how T-Mobile’s hip Millennial consumer advocate branding schtick only goes so far — assuming T-Mobile’s opposition to net neutrality and weird attacks on the EFF hadn’t clued you into that fact already.\n\nLegere goes on to promise Pai that the newly merged T-Mobile won’t raise rates for a period of three years as a condition affixed to the deal:\n\n“To remove any remaining doubt or concerns about New T-Mobile?s prices while we are combining our networks over the next three years, T-Mobile today is submitting to the Commission a commitment that I stand behind ? a commitment that New T-Mobile will make available the same or better rate plans for our services as those offered today by T-Mobile or Sprint.”\n\nRight, but this is the same FCC that just had its authority over telecom operators completely gutted by a massive telecom industry lobbying campaign Legere supported. There’s also zero indication coming from the Pai end that he’d have any interest in holding T-Mobile accountable were they to violate this agreement. Regulatory apathy is extremely common when it comes to actually enforcing merger conditions, and Pai worships at the altar of the (false) belief that mindlessly deregulating the broken telecom sector will somehow miraculously create more competition than ever.\n\nNeedless to say, critics of the deal aren’t calmed much by a three year promise not to raise rates. The 4Competition Coalition, comprised of consumer groups and smaller mobile carriers (not a “big telco” or “big cableco” among them), was quick to issue a statement proclaiming that the promise meant less than nothing:\n\n“Committing to not raise ?rate plans? for three years is an empty promise that does not provide any real price protection for consumers. In fact, T-Mobile?s announcement has confirmed exactly what their own data shows: The merger will eliminate wireless competition and increase prices for consumers. The company?s pledge is riddled with loopholes and ensures that any network improvements will allow them to justify higher monthly bills, effectively rendering the pledge meaningless.”\n\nWall Street analysts, meanwhile, saw the Legere concessions as a sign of desperation. From a research note circulated by Wall Street firm New Street Research:\n\n“The question for investors is whether this commitment is in indication that the deal is more likely or less likely to be approved. Count us in the less likely camp. We admit the clarified commitment could represent a concession that DOJ and/or FCC staff (or the White House) asked for in exchange for agreeing to support the deal. But we think that is unlikely for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, generally when it comes to mergers, the first side to offer concessions is likely to be the side that is losing.”\n\nJohn Legere is entertaining enough that many have been willing to overlook the historical evidence that these kinds of deals are almost always bad for employees and consumers. If they value the health of the telecom sector and their wallet, they really shouldn’t.\n\nFiled Under: ajit pai, competition, fcc, john legere, merger, mobile, rates\n\nCompanies: sprint, t-mobile"
