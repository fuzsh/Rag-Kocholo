The Wall Street Journal has won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting.

The prize was awarded to the staff of The Journal for accountability reporting on financial conflicts of interest among officials at 50 federal agencies that revealed officials who traded stocks they regulated and other ethical violations.

Journal reporters Rebecca Ballhaus, Brody Mullins, John West, Coulter Jones, Joe Palazzolo, James V. Grimaldi, James Benedict, Michael Siconolfi and Chad Day worked on the “Capital Assets” series.

The Journal last won a Pulitzer in 2019 for a series of articles that detailed hush-money payments to two women who said they had affairs with President Donald Trump.

It has now won 39 Pulitzers, considered the highest honor in journalism. The Journal was also a finalist in the international reporting category for stories about the war in Ukraine.

Last year, The Journal was a finalist in the explanatory reporting category for “stories that vividly reconstructed the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and illuminated its enduring effects, describing how the destruction of Black wealth and property burdened future generations.”
