        "text": "Investigative journalism is a vital part of American society, with the potential to uncover and report on important events and issues. For example, Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle highlighted the terrible conditions in Chicago’s meatpacking plants in the 1900s; Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein alerted the public to the Watergate scandal in the 1970s; and, more recently, Brian M. Rosenthal of The New York Times won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for his exposé of the taxi industry in New York City.\n\nWhile investigative journalism has similarities to traditional journalism, if you’re thinking about how to become an investigative journalist, it’s important to remember that investigative pieces take more time than the typical journalistic piece due to the in-depth research and interviews that must be done. To pursue an investigative reporting career, you should have a love for diving deep into the nuances of the topic you’re focusing on. Those interested in becoming an investigative journalist should consider pursuing a related educational program, such as a\n\nAn investigative journalist typically works for a newspaper, website, magazine, radio station, or television station. What an investigative journalist does from day to day can vary based on the organization, but it typically involves researching a specific topic that an editor or a news director has assigned.\n\nInvestigative journalism usually deals with serious issues and typically focuses on political events or social trends. Once assigned a topic, investigative journalists will reach out to sources and experts on the topic to arrange interviews. In addition, they often spend considerable time researching their topic and fact-checking sources. Then, it’s time to organize the information; write the story so the audience will easily understand it; review the story to ensure proper grammar, spelling, and style; and ultimately submit it to the editor or news director.\n\nIn this modern technological era, the investigative journalist’s job description has changed. Instead of just reporting for a print newspaper, a journalist may also post to a blog or social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter, or even do audio reporting through podcasts. “The Tip Off,” “The Bellingcat Podcast,” “White Lies by NPR,” and “Reveal” are examples of investigative reporting podcasts that go behind the scenes of criminal cases, investigations, and murder scenes.\n\nIndividuals interested in the process of how to become an investigative journalist can benefit from learning about potential career options in the field.\n\nPrint journalism is reported primarily through newspapers, magazines, and books. Investigative journalists in this field usually research topics, coordinate interviews, and write articles about a variety of subjects. Those who spend months or years researching and writing about criminal cases or other major news stories may end up publishing books.\n\nBroadcast journalism is reported through electronic means. Forms of broadcast journalism include radio, television, and the internet. The goal of broadcast journalism is to disperse news and information quickly to a diverse audience. Investigative journalists research and write stories that are eventually broadcast through different media avenues.\n\nInvestigative journalists working in global and international journalism research, investigate, and write stories regarding news and current affairs. They research major criminal cases and investigations going on around the world to share on different news platforms. They write content for TV or the internet and can also present stories through documentaries or news bulletins.\n\nPolitical journalism seeks to provide voters with the information they need to make well-informed decisions regarding elections. Investigative journalists working in politics investigate details about the lives of political figures or candidates. They address local and national matters and contribute to a larger social discourse.\n\nIf you’re interested in researching a story that’s meaningful to the public and writing accessible content, investigative reporting may be for you. Here are the steps you need to take to become an investigative journalist.\n\nBecoming an investigative journalist most often includes earning an undergraduate degree in a field like journalism or attending a program like Maryville’s online Bachelor of Arts in English, which can help you improve your writing and communication skills. English students read various works from all over the world and analyze them in both oral and written form. This type of background will help you prepare to interview individuals and write investigative articles.\n\nNews organizations often look to hire someone with prior experience. Job shadowing and internships are great ways to gain experience while you’re earning your degree. You may consider writing for the student newspaper while you’re taking courses, or you could spend a summer shadowing a reporter at a local newspaper or radio station. This type of real-world experience is appealing to employers since they know you’ll already have the journalistic experience to immediately apply to your new job.\n\nAnother benefit of having prior experience is the ability to create a portfolio of your work for future employers. Carrying a portfolio to an interview shows that you’re professional and accomplished. This will also give employers a chance to look at your work and see if your writing style and topic choices are a good fit for them.\n\nThe salary for an investigative journalist varies depending on the region, work, and organization. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median annual salary for a journalist was $46,270 in 2019. Salaries have a significant range, varying by industry, location, experience, and education level. PayScale.com, which sources data from those in the field, reports that the average annual salary of a mid-career investigative journalist in 2020 is about $67,400.\n\nThough traditional newspaper journalism has seen a general decline in recent years, that doesn’t mean that investigative reporting has died. Instead, most cutting-edge reporting has moved to online outlets and journals, offering plenty of opportunities for reporting of all kinds.\n\nAs such, many aspiring investigative journalists are turning to freelance work. Freelance journalists don’t work for a specific organization, but instead have the freedom to choose the topics and media outlets for their reporting. Writers who also have experience in multimedia journalism, such as website design or recording, may see improved job prospects.\n\nIf you love researching, interviewing, and writing and have a passion for sharing important issues with the public, an investigative journalism career may be a great fit for you.\n\nStarting an undergraduate degree where you develop communication, research, and writing skills can provide you the tools you’ll need to become the next Woodward or Bernstein.
