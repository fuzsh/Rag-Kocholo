        "text": "Our Mission\n\nInvestigateWest is a nonprofit investigative journalism newsroom located in Seattle, WA. We focus on critical issues that impact our communities throughout the Pacific Northwest and Cascadia, with a special focus on environment, government and corporate accountability, and public health. Our mission is to engage Pacific Northwest residents in social issues by providing compelling, change making investigative and explanatory journalism. Our vision is a society of informed residents empowered to exercise their rights and work within their communities to make the world a more just and equitable place.\n\nOur History\n\nInvestigateWest was founded in 2009 by Seattle Post-Intelligencer newspaper reporters and editors after the paper stopped publishing. Seeing the need for local news, we have worked to build a nonprofit model for public-service journalism, and publish dozens of in-depth stories every year that reach audiences of over one million people. We produce original reporting and tools that equip the public to participate in our democracy, and collaborate with other news outlets to pursue consequential journalism. Partners include The Atlantic, Crosscut, Grist, Salon, The New York Times, KUOW Public Radio, and more.\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility\n\nInvestigateWest is committed to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA). Our work relies on our ability to build authentic and trusting relationships across the spectrum of our human differences. As individuals, we carry our identities and experiences with us. Creating and sustaining inclusive working environments for all individuals is vital to the future of InvestigateWest and to providing the best public service journalism for our communities.\n\nCOMPETITIVE PAY. We offer competitive pay for staff and freelancers, including producers, editors, reporters, development, and in every area of our work. In journalism, socioeconomic factors have prevented diversity, and without addressing those factors many DEI efforts have failed. DEI EDITORIAL & OPERATIONAL FOCUS. We will create stories, working environments, and engagement techniques in which all people are valued, respected, and can engage without barriers. We will use an equity lens to examine all stories and initiatives going forward. This is a series of questions we will ask ourselves internally before we begin any new initiative at INVW, including: Who is the right person to report on this story? To edit this story? To photograph this story? What is their cultural competency, especially as it relates to language choice? There are more ongoing questions that we will define and answer with our community. WHERE WE LIVE & WORK. We acknowledge that the Seattle offices of InvestigateWest are located on Indigenous lands, and our work takes place in Indigenous spaces. We are located on the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Coast Salish people, including the Duwamish People past and present.\n\nFast Fact Information:\n\nMailing address: P.O.
