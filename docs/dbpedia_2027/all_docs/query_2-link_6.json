        "text": "The winners of the 2024 Pulitzer Prizes were announced from Columbia University Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Pulitzers are regarded as the highest honor a U.S.-based journalist or organization can receive.\n\nThis year’s awards come as universities across the country, including Columbia, grapple with protests over the war in Gaza. Much of Columbia’s Morningside campus has been closed to everyone except essential personnel and students living in on-campus residence halls. The Pulitzer board instead met at the corporate offices of The Associated Press.\n\nPoynter President Neil Brown is co-chair of the Pulitzer Prize Board. Brown declined to discuss last week’s board deliberations, but offered:\n\n“The journalism honored today connects with us on a personal level. Through service to our communities, large and small, and with exceptional storytelling at a time of conflict and confusion, journalists provide insight and reveal uncomfortable truths. The Pulitzer Prizes are essential to celebrating the value of that.”\n\nDuring the announcement, the Pulitzer Prize Board renewed its call for Russia to free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been wrongfully detained for more than a year. It also awarded two special citations this year — to the late writer and critic Greg Tate, and to journalists covering Gaza.\n\nRead more about the winners and finalists below.\n\nBreaking News

His aesthetic innovations and intellectual originality, particularly in his pioneering hip hop criticism, continue to influence subsequent generations, particularly writers and critics of color.\n\nJournalists covering Gaza: In recent years, the Pulitzer Board has issued citations honoring journalists covering wars in Ukraine and Afghanistan. This year, the board recognizes the courageous work of journalists and media workers covering the war in Gaza. Under horrific conditions, an extraordinary number of journalists have died in the effort to tell the stories of Palestinians and others in Gaza. This war has also claimed the lives of poets and writers among the casualties. As the Pulitzer Prizes honor categories of journalism, arts, and letters, we mark the loss of invaluable records of the human experience.\n\nThe board also announced Letters, Drama and Music awards Monday, including for Fiction, Drama, History, Biography, Memoir or Autobiography, Poetry, General Nonfiction and Music.\n\nMore from Poynter on the 2024 Pulitzer Prizes:\n\nLookout Santa Cruz, digital site with a backstory, wins Pulitzer for breaking news\n\nSmall newsrooms won big in the 2024 Pulitzers\n\nThe Invisible Institute won two Pulitzers this year.
