        "text": "The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's College of Journalism and Mass Communications is proud to announce that three alumni have won Pulitzer Prizes. Angel Jennings, Lauryn Higgins and Kelly Ann Scott have each been recognized for their outstanding work in journalism.\n\nAngel Jennings, a 2008 graduate, won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting as part of the team at the Los Angeles Times. Her contribution to the article \"L.A.’s Black-Latino alliance has always been fragile. Can it survive racist recordings?\" shed light on the intricate relationships between Latino and Black politicians in Los Angeles and how those relationships influence policy decisions. Jennings is an assistant managing editor for culture and talent at the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHiggins, a 2018 graduate, was part of the team at The New York Times that won the Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting for their investigative reporting on war crimes in Ukraine. Their article, \"What Hundreds of Photos of Weapons Reveal About Russia’s Brtual War Strategy,\" exposed the role of arms dealers and corrupt officials in fueling the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the resulting civilian casualties. Higgins is a stringer for the New York Times and a lecturer at the UNL College of Journalism and Mass Communications.\n\nScott, a 1998 graduate and the editor-in-chief and vice president of content at AL.com, won the Pulitzer Prize in Local reporting as part of the team at AL.com in Birmingham. She and her colleagues were recognized for their investigative reporting on Alabama's corrupt political culture and its impact on the state's citizens.\n\n\"We are incredibly proud of our alumni and their achievements. Angel Jennings, Lauryn Higgins and Kelly Ann Scott exemplify our college's rigorous and impactful journalism education,” said Shari Veil, dean of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications. “Their Pulitzer Prize wins serve as a testament to the power of investigative reporting and journalists' critical role in our society. We are honored to have them as part of our community of talented and passionate journalists.\""
