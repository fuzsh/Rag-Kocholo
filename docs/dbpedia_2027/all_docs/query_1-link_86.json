        "text": "What you missed from the week that was. This wire service feature will catch you up on major news events from the previous week each Sunday in the Star-News.\n\nA deadly week for U.S. in Iraq\n\nIn a week that marked the one-year anniversary of the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime, a violent insurgency continued in Iraq, taking the lives of at least 49 U.S. troops. It was the deadliest week for the coalition since Mr. Hussein’s ouster.\n\nIraqi insurgents said they had taken six more hostages – two Americans and four Italians – a day after militants showed footage of three Japanese aid workers whom they threatened to burn unless their government withdrew its troops, which are noncombat.\n\nBy most accounts, the Iraqi dead numbered in the hundreds. In Fallujah, residents took advantage of a lull in the fighting to bury dozens of their dead in makeshift graves in the city’s soccer stadium.\n\nEarly Saturday, Marine officials announced that they would increase troop strength around the city from 2,500 to 3,750.\n\nRice provides 9-11 testimony\n\nCondoleezza Rice, President Bush’s national security adviser, testified Thursday that Mr. Bush was warned a month before the Sept. 11 terror attacks that the FBI had detected “suspicious activity” that suggested terrorists were planning a domestic hijacking. She said he was also told that the bureau was conducting 70 investigations of possible al-Qaeda terrorist cells operating within American borders.\n\nIn her long-awaited sworn testimony before the independent commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, Dr. Rice acknowledged that the special intelligence briefing that had been requested by Mr. Bush and presented to him on Aug. 6, 2001, at his Texas ranch had carried an ominous title: “ ‘Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States.”’\n\nUnder often harsh questioning from Democratic members of the panel, Dr. Rice dismissed the importance of the still-classified August 6, 2001, report that had been prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency, describing it in her testimony as “historical information based on old reporting – there was no new threat information.”\n\nThere has been dispute within the administration over the accuracy of the intelligence in the report, and FBI officials have said that it appears to overstate the scope and significance of their counterterrorism efforts before Sept. 11.\n\nSome of the details in the report have been acknowledged previously by the White House, including its reference to possible hijackings. But Dr. Rice suggested in her testimony on Thursday that the warnings were more explicit than previously known and that the FBI was actively investigating the possibility of a terrorist strike within the United States.\n\n“The FBI was pursuing these al-Qaeda cells,” she said. “I believe in the Aug. 6 memorandum it says there were 70 full-field investigations under way of these cells. And so there was no recommendation that we do something about this. The FBI was pursuing it.”\n\nShe also confirmed that the intelligence report contained the following passage: “The FBI indicates patterns of suspicious activity in the United States consistent with preparations for hijacking.”\n\nDr. Rice was one of two high-profile witnesses appearing before the commission on Thursday, but the only one to testify in public. Former President Bill Clinton was interviewed in the afternoon and told the panel that since the attacks he has been asking himself repeatedly what his administration could have done to prevent the tragedy, members of the commission said afterward.\n\nIn a statement released after the three-hour session, the commission described Mr. Clinton as “forthcoming and responsive” and thanked him for “the excellent cooperation that he and his associates have given to us.”\n\nDr. Rice offered a spirited, unapologetic defense of the Bush administration’s efforts against terrorism before Sept. 11, insisting that Mr. Bush had been aware of threats from Mr. bin Laden’s terrorist network throughout 2001 and had done all he could to prevent attacks.\n\nPulitzer Prizes are awarded\n\nThe Los Angeles Times on Monday won five Pulitzer Prizes, the most for any newspaper this year, in categories ranging from breaking news to feature photography, and Washington Post foreign correspondent Anthony Shadid won a Pulitzer for international reporting for his coverage of the Iraq war and its uncertain aftermath.\n\nAnne Applebaum, a Washington Post editorial writer, won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction for her book The Gulag: A History. It describes the horrors of the gulag system in the former Soviet Union.\n\nThe Toledo Blade won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting for its series on atrocities committed by Tiger Force, an elite U.S. Army platoon during the Vietnam War. Michael D. Sallah, Mitch Weiss and Joe Mahr spent nine months on the story.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal won two awards: Kevin Helliker and Thomas M. Burton took the explanatory reporting award for an examination of aneurysms, a medical condition that kills thousands of people each year. Reporter Daniel Golden won the beat reporting award for his articles detailing the college admission preferences given to the children of alumni and wealthy donors. The New York Times, which owns the Star-News, won the prestigious Public Service Award for a series examining the problem of workplace safety in many corners of the nation.\n\nThe $10,000 prizes, which are administered by Columbia University, included seven awards for the arts. Writer Edward P. Jones of Arlington, Va., won for his novel The Known World. Playwright Doug Wright won the drama award for I Am My Own Wife.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times staff, collectively, won two awards. It took the Pulitzer in national reporting for its examination of the often hardball tactics that Wal-Mart used in becoming the world’s largest company. And it received a Pulitzer for breaking news for its coverage of the wildfires in Southern California last year.\n\nBoston archdiocese settles abuse claims\n\nFour men who have alleged they were molested by the Rev. Paul Shanley, a central figure in the clergy abuse scandal that erupted here two years ago, announced on Monday that they had agreed to settle their civil case against Boston’s Catholic archdiocese.\n\nThe amount of the settlement was not disclosed, but a lawyer for the victims – Gregory Ford, Paul Busa and two others whose names have not been released – said that at least one would receive the largest settlement payment ever awarded in an abuse lawsuit in Massachusetts.\n\nMr. Ford, 26, has said Mr. Shanley raped him repeatedly over several years, beginning when he was 6 years old.\n\nRev. Shanley, 72, who is awaiting trial since he was released on $300,000 bail last December has denied the charges.\n\nPoor countries to get low-cost AIDS drugs\n\nA year-old deal that offers AIDS drugs at a steep discount to 16 countries has been expanded to all the world’s poor nations, a key step toward making treatment available to millions of vulnerable patients.\n\nBroadening the program to more than 100 countries could dramatically increase the number of AIDS patients being treated and offers hope that the World Health Organization might achieve its goal of getting 3 million poor people on antiretroviral therapy by 2005, advocates said.\n\nThe groups that negotiated the agreement – the World Bank, the Global Fund, UNICEF and the Clinton Foundation – combine for the first time some of the largest funding agencies with those that have the best public health expertise, including WHO.\n\nMissing, however, was one prominent funder: the U.S. government, which has its own plan to help AIDS patients in poor countries. The $15 billion U.S. plan seeks to buy medicines involving multiple combinations of pills from Western pharmaceutical companies that hold patents on the drugs, while Monday’s deal will rely on fixed-dose medicines made in India and South Africa.\n\nDespite the agreement, the participants said, the “3 by 5” target set by WHO faces daunting challenges, mostly because of a lack of public health infrastructure to deliver the medicines in the poorest countries.\n\nBird flu fears prompt slaughter\n\nCanadian officials Monday ordered the extermination of as many as 19 million birds in British Columbia – including commercial chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and pigeons – in an attempt to stop the rapid spread of avian flu, which has infected 18 farms and sickened at least two poultry workers.\n\nPoultry producers in British Columbia, who recommended the slaughter of domesticated fowl to the federal government, said the disease had devastated their industry. Agriculture Minister Bob Speller identified a “hot zone” for avian influenza, a six-mile area around a farm in Abbotsford, B.C., in the province’s Fraser Valley, where the virus was detected in February."
