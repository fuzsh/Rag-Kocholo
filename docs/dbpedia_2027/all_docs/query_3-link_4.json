        "text": "The staff of The Wall Street Journal has won the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for its remarkable Capital Assets series, which revealed how thousands of senior executive-branch employees owned stock in companies they or their agency directly oversaw. The success of this extensive, expansive project is due in large part to the cross-collaborative efforts of the investigative team and the D.C. bureau, with assistance from the data and visual departments.\n\nYaroslav Trofimov and James Marson were also recognized as Pulitzer finalists in International Reporting for their coverage from Ukraine."
