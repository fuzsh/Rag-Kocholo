        "text": "News & Analysis\n\nThe ‘Moonshot’ Newsroom: An Insider’s Account of the Meteoric Rise and Fall of BuzzFeed News Investigations\n\nBuzzFeed News investigative correspondent Tom Warren reflects on the rise and fall of their award-winning investigations team.\n\nMethodology Reporting Tools & Tips\n\nMegha Rajagopalan: What I’ve Learned About Investigative Journalism\n\nMegha Rajagopalan has reported from over 23 countries in Asia and the Middle East, on stories ranging from the North Korean nuclear crisis to the peace process in Afghanistan. Her team’s investigation into prison camps in Xinjiang, China won a Pulitzer Prize. In this podcast, she discusses how she got into investigative journalism and gives her tips for speaking to vulnerable sources.\n\nMethodology News & Analysis\n\nHow the NYT’s Pulitzer-Winning Series Exposed Civilian Deaths in the Air War on ISIS\n\nTo get a behind-the-scenes look at The New York Times’ Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into the civilian death toll of US airstrikes, GIJN interviewed two key members of the reporting team: Christoph Koettl, a member of the Times’ visual Investigations team, and the series’ lead reporter, Azmat Khan.\n\nHow They Did It News & Analysis\n\nHow They Did It: Covering One of the World’s Most Dangerous Border Crossings\n\nEvery year thousands of migrants cross one of the most dangerous borders in the world: the Darién Gap, a magnificent but deadly rainforest that connects Colombia and Panama. GIJN spoke to a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, and one of her teammates, who trekked through the jungle to investigate what happens en route.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nAggressive Reporting, Fierce Writing, and FOI Requests: How a Small Town Editor Won a Pulitzer\n\nWhen Jeff Gerritt first started asking questions about deaths in Texas jails, he was told “it’s not news for someone to die in county jail.” But his reporting and the Op Ed pieces that resulted from it led to a Pulitzer Prize, a rare win for a scrappy thrice-weekly paper in an era where the journalism industry is seeing increasing cutbacks and layoffs.\n\nCase Studies\n\nYemen’s Dirty War: A Q&A with Pulitzer Winner Maggie Michael\n\nYemen has been embroiled in civil war for decades. But its current conflict has left 100,000 dead, with hundreds of thousands more displaced. While the war has received limited coverage by most international and mainstream media outlets, during 2018 and 2019 a team of Associated Press journalists spent months investigating Yemen’s Dirty War. Maggie Michael, Nariman El-Mofty, and Maad al-Zekri won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting. GIJN’s Majdolin Hasan spoke with Michael about how they did it.\n\nReporting Tools & Tips\n\nLaw as Source: How Investigative Journalists Can Superpower Their Reporting\n\nThe legal system constantly produces information on the behavior of powerful people and entities. Based on his latest research, law expert Roy Shapira has unpacked for GIJN how investigative reporters can use the full potential of legal sources for better reporting.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nJoris Luyendijk at #EIJC18: Investigative Journalism in the Post-Truth World\n\nJoris Luyendijk’s keynote speech at the European Investigative Journalism Conference posed an uncomfortable question for investigative journalists. Are we, in our pursuit of exposing wrongdoing, unwittingly putting ourselves at risk of becoming pawns or useful idiots for demagogues, protest parties and populists like Trump?\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nA Bumper Crop of Award-Winning Investigations\n\n‘Tis the season of media awards with lots of great investigative journalists — and great investigative stories — getting honored for their muckraking. We’ve picked some notable winners and finalists from the European Press Prizes, the Pulitzers, and the IRE Awards. Big congratulations to the winners and finalists, who have showcased grit and determination in exposing injustices and corruption across the globe. Despite all the challenges we face, muckraking has never been in better hands.\n\nNews & Analysis\n\nGIJN Members in the News\n\nIt’s been a busy first quarter of 2017 for GIJN members — from picking up Pulitzer Prizes to launching crowdfunding campaigns. There have also been new projects and new collaborations forged. Here are some noteworthy splashes made by GIJN members around the world."
