        "text": "JOE KAHN:\n\nGood afternoon. It is. And it’s good to see so many of you here, in person on a Monday, no less. You can only imagine what it would be like if the Pulitzers were announced on a Wednesday. But this is a good crowd, and we have some good news.\n\nI’m pleased to share with you that The New York Times has won three Pulitzer Prizes, and we have also been named as a finalist in six other categories.\n\nA team of reporters, photographers and video producers has won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for exposing the horrors Hamas inflicted on Israel on Oct. 7 and the devastating toll of Israel’s assault on Gaza, and for its deeply reported, exclusive investigations that revealed historic intelligence failures and deadly miscalculations.\n\nHannah Dreier has won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for “Alone and Exploited,” her six-part series exposing the scope of child migrant labor across the U.S. in factories, slaughterhouses and construction sites.\n\nKatie Engelhart has won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for “The Mother Who Changed,” her heart-rending tale of one family’s battle as it confronted its mother’s slip into dementia and what should happen to her wishes.\n\nDave Philipps is a finalist for National Reporting for his reporting that revealed that many soldiers have likely sustained debilitating brain injuries from being exposed to the blasts of their own weapons. Pat Lyons was his editor.\n\nJulie Turkewitz and Federico Rios are finalists for International Reporting for their reporting and photography series that depicts the tragedies, triumphs and corruption that permeate the huge surge of human migration through the Darien Gap. Greg Winter, Lauren Katzenberg and Diego Ribadeneira were Julie’s editors. Craig Allen was Federico’s editor.\n\nNanna Heitmann is a finalist for Feature Photography for her sober, unerring depiction of Russia’s loss, nationalist exaltation, division, delusion, pride and mourning that accompanied reporting by Roger Cohen and Valerie Hopkins. Gaia Tripoli, Mona Boshnaq and Adam Dean were Nanna’s editors.\n\nHannah Reyes Morales is a finalist in Feature Photography for her photographs capturing Africa’s epochal change into a continent dominated by youth in “Old World, Young Africa,” written by Declan Walsh. Gaia Tripoli and Mikko Takkunen were Hannah’s editors.\n\nKeri Blakinger is a finalist for Feature Writing for her story on how the game Dungeons & Dragons became a lifeline for a group of inmates in a Texas Prison. The piece was published in partnership with the Marshall Project. Raha Naddaf and Jessica Lustig were the editors.\n\nAnd a series of articles exposing decades of wrongdoing in the Mississippi sheriff’s department is a finalist for Local Reporting. The series, written by Ilyssa Daly, Jerry Mitchell, Brian Howey and Nate Rosenfield, was published in partnership with Mississippi Today, with support from Stanford University’s Big Local News and the Pulitzer Center. It was edited by Chris Davis and published as part of the first year of our Local Investigations Fellowship led by Dean Baquet.\n\nThis recognition is a testament to the extraordinary work this newsroom has produced over the last year. For every person whose name I mentioned, there are dozens of colleagues who contributed to the success and impact of this journalism, from every part of the newsroom. That has been true as long as the paper has been publishing, but it has become even more true as our journalism exists in more formats than ever before, whether it’s print, digital, audio, photo, video, graphics, on-platform, off-platform, live blogs, takeaways, what we knows, investigations or swipers. So thank you and congratulations to the teamwork involved in all of this.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that every one of these winners and finalists showcases a drive for original, revelatory reporting that underpins so much of what we produce, from the biggest storylines in the news to feature writing as well as classic investigations. The recognition that we’ve gotten for this work is really due to the daily, weekly, monthly push to figure out the most ambitious thing we can do on the most important stories we’re covering. I attribute much of that to the newsroom Dean handed over to this leadership team and to the ongoing stewardship of Matt Purdy, Jim Yardley, Jake Silverstein at the magazine and so many others who inject that enterprising spirit into everything we do.\n\nAnd it should not and will not go without saying that the reason we can all continue to deliver this kind of work owes in no small measure to the family and the company that have committed themselves absolutely to the mission of great journalism, often against the tide, always with pride: For that we should all thank AG Sulzberger and the entire Ochs-Sulzberger family.\n\nAnd to the team of product and business colleagues who are better at what they do – way better, it turns out – than anyone else in the industry. Which allows us to be better as well. Thank you, Meredith and your team.\n\nI’m going to turn it over to Marc and Carolyn, who are going to share the other ways your work over the last year has been recognized.\n\nMARC LACEY:\n\nThank you, Joe.\n\nI am in awe of the journalism you’ve produced this past year. Truly in awe.\n\nYou’ve done it from Ukraine and Russia, where you won two Overseas Press Club awards. That’s the 19th consecutive year that you all have taken home at least one OPC honor.\n\nYou’ve done it from the Darien Gap, where Julie Turkewitz and Federico Rios took home the James Foley Medill Medal for Courage in Journalism, in addition to being a Pulitzer finalist, as Joe mentioned.\n\nYou won four Human Rights Press Awards, for a photo series “A Year Under the Taliban,” and for coverage of Chinese surveillance.\n\nThe Society of News Design honored you with 250 print and digital awards. Yes, you heard that right. Two hundred fifty. And listen to this: The Times was one of two publications named the World’s Best Designed Newspaper.\n\nYou won six SABEW Best in Business Awards. And Dean Murphy – Where are you Dean? You’re here somewhere. Dean won a President’s Award for his tireless contributions to the organization and business journalism ethics. Congratulations Dean.\n\nOur coverage of book bans across the United States, a multimedia feature out of Fire Island and a look at legislation threatening gay life in Russia were honored by NLGJA, The Association of LGBTQ+ Journalists.\n\nAnd over to you, Carolyn.\n\nCAROLYN RYAN:\n\nThanks, Marc. The awards you’ve highlighted are really inspiring. But there’s more…\n\nThe National Association of Black Journalists, in its salute to excellence, recognized Emmanuel Morgan for his feature story on N.F.L. players with dreadlocks, and Troy Closson was named the Michael J. Feeney Emerging Journalist of the Year.\n\nThe Magazine had an impressive showing from ASME, the American Society of Magazine Editors. Among them, Susan Dominus was recognized for her blockbuster story about menopause. And work from the Magazine won two awards for design, photography and illustration: one for Best Print Design, and one for Best News and Entertainment Story.\n\nOur visual journalists won 60 awards from Pictures of the Year and Best of Photojournalism for excellence in video, multimedia, photojournalism, video and visual editing.\n\nIn Pictures of the Year, Tyler Hicks won first place in the General News photo category, and “Ghosts on the Glacier” won first place for online project of the year.\n\nAnd just to give a little shout out to the editors, The New York Times was named the Top Picture Editing Team of the Year and the always great Heather Casey was named Picture Editor of the year in the national category.\n\nThe Times video and graphics department also won several top awards in visual presentation in both, News and Culture categories\n\nAnd here in New York City. Where’s Metro? We won seven Silurians Press Club Medallions thanks to our local coverage, including the Silurians’ highest honor, for Dan Barry and Karen Zraick’s investigation into a troubled construction site in the South Bronx. We also won in categories that display the breadth of our local coverage: Eliza Shapiro, Brian M. Rosenthal and Jonah Markowitz for Public Service; Nicholas Fandos for Breaking News; Alex Traub for Arts and Culture Reporting; Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Otterman for Health and Science and Anne Barnard for Environmental Reporting.\n\nAnd I just wanted to take a minute, since we’re all here together in the newsroom, to acknowledge some people we’d lost over the past year, starting with Carter Love.\n\nCarter Love as a Photo editor at T Magazine. Carter joined T in 2013, and produced an impressive body of work, from fashion shoots to travel articles, and had deep family ties to the Times.\n\nBill Connoll was an editor at the Times for more than three decades, and with Al Siegal he co-authored a major revision of the Times stylebook in 1999. He wanted the Times to sound less stodgy and more inclusive and he was known for his deep love of the semicolon.\n\nAnd of course Joe Lelyveld, who was Executive editor, copy boy, foreign correspondent, Pulitzer Prize winner, and a beloved mentor to so many of the people in this room.\n\nThank you.\n\nJOE:\n\nThe war in Israel and Gaza began while the International desk and many others all across the newsroom were immersed in coverage of another war in Ukraine. And without missing a beat, or pulling back from the European war, you began covering the spiraling Middle East conflict with the same unflinching and tireless commitment. Whether it was the Hamas invasion of Israel or the resulting bombardment that destroyed Gaza and took so many lives, our correspondents, photographers and videographers lived through this war as well as covering it.\n\nThis war has been more divisive than any other story that I’ve experienced at The Times for, both inside and outside of our newsroom. We have had difficult conversations about how best to cover a conflict that offers no neutral vantage point and no natural middle ground. Our journalists have been attacked for their work. The organization as a whole has become a lightning rod for people’s anger and anxiety. It has also been a heartfelt story for many of the people covering it: Some are Muslim, others Jewish. Some speak Arabic, others Hebrew. Some have relatives who have served in the Israeli military and know people killed or captured on Oct. 7. Others were born and raised in Gaza, with relatives killed and scattered by the bombardment. This one is personal for so many of us.\n\nThose were the challenges. But our response has been to channel that energy into bringing the best journalistic talent to every aspect of covering this war, from investigative work on the causes and failures that led to the conflict, to immersive reporting on the human toll that only our best photo, video and graphics journalists can provide.\n\nAnd if you can’t entirely avoid the noise on X, or in our lobby, take a moment to listen also to the juries of our peers. They don’t usually speak with one voice. But this time they did. The Polk, the Overseas Press Club, the Robert Capa Gold Medal Award for best photographic reporting, and the Best of Photojournalism award, among others. We swept the big ones.\n\nSo to Phil Pan, Greg Winter, Adrienne Carter, Josh Keller and the international desk; Meaghan Looram, Gaia Tripoli and the photo desk; Solana Pine, Mark Scheffler and our video department; Julie Bloom and the Live team; Archie Tse and the graphics team; Elisabeth Bumiller and the Washington Bureau; Paula Szuchman, Ben Calhoun and The Daily team; and everyone else in the newsroom who has been involved in this coverage, thank you.\n\nNow I’m going to invite Phil Pan to talk about the award.\n\n(2024 International Reporting Pulitzer Remarks)\n\nJOE:\n\nHannah Dreier\n\nWe talk quite a bit about our commitment to investigative reporting and the impact our journalism has. No Times series had more impact last year, from government investigations and crackdowns to business reforms than Hannah Dreier’s investigation into the exploitation of child migrant workers.\n\nWhen Hannah joined us in 2022, she made clear that she wanted to focus on character-driven investigative journalism. Investigative reporting with a heart. And we should all be thrilled that she delivered on that promise.\n\nThe visuals in this series were crucial in conveying its findings. Hannah worked with a large and talented team of visual journalists to bring these stories alive. The goal was to not just show how common this exploitation was, but also give our audience a real sense of the danger of the work.\n\nAnd a core part of this series was the data, which Eli Murray analyzed with Hannah to identify trends and to create a striking graphical visualization of where migrant children are living and often working in the country. And we made that data public as part of our commitment to exposing these realities.\n\nThis was a memorable partnership between Hannah and Kirsten Danis, her editor and one of our most devoted champions of investigative work. It’s also a tribute to her editors at the magazine, Ilena Silverman and Jessica Lustig.\n\nHannah’s work was another slam dunk. A total of eight major awards, including the elusive Goldsmith Prize. And she was a finalist for four others.\n\nAnd just before I introduce Kirsten Danis. I don’t know where Hannah is, but I think we also have, do we have a surprise guest here in Sylvie? So Hannah is technically on maternity leave at the moment, and the cause of that… Sylvie.. may be here to witness the prize. There we go.\n\nKirsten Danis.\n\n(2024 Investigative Reporting Pulitzer Remarks)\n\nJOE:\n\nKatie Engelhart. When Katie began reporting on an Iowa widow in her 80s who falls in love with a man her two daughters think is taking advantage of her illness and wealth, she thought her story would focus on elder abuse. But as she continued, she realized it was more about how we should understand and deal with a person with dementia. Katie wove together many conflicting points of view, a rorschach test of a narrative, with care and nuance and navigated readers through ethical and legal complexities in a clear and compelling way.\n\nHer story is the result of what happens when you follow the reporting. It’s also an example of the rich and complex human narratives that are a hallmark of our magazine. And it’s the fifth year in a row when Jake’s magazine’s work has been recognized by the Pulitzers.\n\nSo now, Jake, I’ll turn it over to you to introduce Katie.\n\n(2024 Feature Writing Pulitzer Remarks)\n\nJOE:\n\nSo we’re going to offer a toast to all of you. But before we do that, I did want to mention that the work that goes into all of these prize submissions begins every year, like two months ago. Going through the work that may be the most outstanding. Championing it through the process and making year end deadlines. That work is handled year after year by Glenn Kramon and Mariel Wamsley. Thank you very much.\n\nSteven McElroy and Adam Kepler are also involved in so many of the details, including elements of this gathering. Thank you for what you do.\n\nAnd our extensive internal comms team. You can see there is equipment splayed out here that makes this a seamless operation for people both here in the room and those who are attending virtually. So thank you too. And now to all of you. Congratulations."
