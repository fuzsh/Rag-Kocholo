        "text": "See also Wikipedia's article about \"Pulitzer Prize\".\n\nThe Pulitzer Prizes are given out every April to writers and journalists by the Graduate School of Journalismâ€Ž. They are named for Joseph Pulitzer, the J-School's founding donor, and were first awarded in 1917. The proper pronunciation of the name Pulitzer is \"Pull it, sir,\" according to administrators of the prize.\n\nOften, Columbia will acclaim alums for having received them, although they're given out by the university itself. Specifically, the Pulitzer Board, which decides the winners, consists of a number of longtime editors and professors, and, ceremonially, the University President.\n\nClearly, they don't give out an award for ethics.\n\nColumbia alumni winners\n\nNotable Columbia alumni who have won the prize include:\n\nInternational Reporting\n\n1973: Max Frankel CC'52, New York Times editor\n\nInvestigative Reporting\n\n1988: Dean Baquet CC'78, while at the Chicago Tribune\n\n2005: Nigel Jaquiss J'97, Willamette Week reporter\n\nCrticism\n\n1996: Robert Campbell J'?, Boston Globe architecture critic\n\n1997: Tim Page CC'79, Washington Post music critic\n\nBiography\n\n1924: Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin CC 1883\n\n2008: John Matteson PhD?, English prof at John Jay College\n\n2010: T.J.
