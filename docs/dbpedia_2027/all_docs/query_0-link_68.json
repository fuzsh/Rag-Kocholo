        "text": "American Literature\n\nThis division includes works devoted primarily to the literatures—in whatever language—of the United States.\n\nResearchers should also consult sections Q: American Literature/Regional Literature and Q: American Literature/Ethnic and Minority Literatures for other general reference works.\n\nBrogan, Martha L. A Kaleidoscope of Digital American Literature. Washington: Council on Lib. and Information Sources, Digital Lib. Federation, 2005. 176 pp. PS51.B76 025.06′81. <http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub132>.\n\nAn evaluative survey of electronic resources—databases, digital archives, gateways, Web sites, and pedagogical tools—for the study of American literature. Using extensive interviews with experts in the field, Brogan illustrates the potential, pitfalls, and lacunae in digital resources. The wealth of information and astute observations have led those working with other literatures to wish for a similar guide. Although dated, it is still useful and provides a history of early-twentieth-century digital humanities literary projects and tools.\n\nGohdes, Clarence, and Sanford E. Marovitz. Bibliographical Guide to the Study of the Literature of the U. S. A. 5th ed., rev. and enl. Durham: Duke UP, 1984. 256 pp. Z1225.G6 [PS88] 016.81.\n\nA selective, interdisciplinary guide to reference works, histories, critical studies, and discussions of research methods (published through early 1983) important to the study of American literature and its historical background. Entries are organized in 35 divisions: general reference works, philosophy and methodology of literary and historical study, technical procedures in literary and historical research, definitions of literary and related terms, preparation of manuscripts for publication, national bibliographies, periodical indexes, American studies or civilization (including popular culture), general works on American history, specialized studies of American history, biography, periodicals, newspapers, book trade and publishing, history of ideas, psychology, philosophy (including transcendentalism), religion, women’s studies, general bibliographies of American literature, histories of American literature, poetry, drama (including theater and film), fiction, criticism, humor and other special genres (including children’s literature), seventeenth- and eighteenth-century literature, twentieth-century literature, themes and topics, regionalism, minorities, relations with other countries, American language, folklore, and comparative and general literature. The generally brief descriptive annotations frequently cite related works. An appendix lists the principal biographies of 135 authors. Two indexes: subjects; names. Many divisions would benefit from more refined classification or organization; some annotations have not been revised to reflect changes in scope or organization of serial publications or revised editions; and a few outdated works or superseded editions should be excised. Especially valuable for its interdisciplinary scope, this onetime standard guide to reference works and scholarship essential to research in American literature is now in need of wholesale revision and updating.

United States History: A Multicultural, Interdisciplinary Guide to Information Sources. 2nd ed. Westport: Libs. Unlimited, 2003. 661 pp. Z1236.P45 [E178] 016.973.\n\nA guide to reference sources (through 2002) on American history and culture to c. 2002. The 1,250 entries are listed alphabetically by title in six classified divisions: general works; politics and government; economic history; diplomatic history and foreign affairs; military history; and social, cultural, and intellectual history (with sections for genealogy, ethnic and gender issues, education, theater, and popular culture). Indexed by authors and titles. The evaluative annotations are quite full and frequently cite related works.\n\nBecause the second edition of United States History emphasizes social history, a useful complement is Francis Paul Prucha, Handbook for Research in American History: A Guide to Bibliographies and Other Reference Works, 2nd ed. (Lincoln: U of Nebraska P, 1994; 214 pp.), which is organized by kind of reference work (with coverage extending through c. 1993). Works are described in chapters on electronic resources; library catalogs and guides; general bibliographies of American history; catalogs of books; book review indexes; guides to periodical literature; guides to manuscripts; guides to newspapers; dissertations and theses; biographical sources; oral history materials; printed documents of the federal government; the National Archives; state and local materials; legal sources; atlases, maps, and geographic guides; encyclopedias, handbooks, and dictionaries; statistics; and picture sources. Unfortunately, the second edition drops the coverage of specific topics such as political history, social history, ethnic groups, women, blacks, American Indians, religion, regional material, and travel accounts. Works are described in narrative fashion—but too rarely evaluated—a practice that makes scanning difficult; coverage of electronic resources is inadequate; and there are more errors and lapses in judgment than one would like in an introductory guide. Indexed by persons, titles, and subjects. The original edition of the Handbook was once the best guide to reference works on American history and included much of importance to literary scholarship; unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the new edition.\n\nSears, Jean L., and Marilyn K. Moody. Using Government Information Sources, Electronic and Print. 3rd ed. Phoenix: Oryx, 2001. 536 pp. Z1223.Z7 S4 [J83] 015.73′053.\n\nA guide to searching United States government publications. Along with describing how to use the basic indexes, databases, and numerous Web sites, Sears and Moody explain the Superintendent of Documents Classification system and outline research strategies. Of particular interest to literary researchers are the sections on copyright, genealogy, and the National Archives. Indexed by subjects and titles. This work is the best introduction for those needing to search government publications. Prucha, Handbook for Research in American History (Q3185a), also has a useful chapter on locating printed documents of the federal government.\n\nFor a representative list of GPO publications on the humanities, see Donna L. Burton, “Government Document Resources for the Humanities: A Representative Bibliography,” Bulletin of Bibliography 49.2 (1992): 93–100.\n\nUseful lists of histories and surveys appear in Gohdes and Marovitz, Bibliographical Guide to the Study of the Literature of the U. S. A., pp. 95–101 (entry Q3180); Kolb, Field Guide to the Study of American Literature, pp. 25–87 (Q3180a); and Leary, American Literature: A Study and Research Guide, pp. 11–27 (Q3180a). For a detailed account and assessment of major histories from 1829 through 1948, see Vanderbilt, American Literature and the Academy (Q3209); for a comparison of Columbia Literary History of the United States (Q3195), Literary History of the United States (Q3200), and Cambridge History of American Literature (Q3205a), see Hans-Joachim Lang, “From the Old Cambridge History of American Literature to the New Columbia Literary History of the United States,” Reconstructing American Literary and Historical Studies, ed. Günter H. Lenz, Hartmut Keil, and Sabine Bröck-Sallah (Frankfurt: Campus; New York: St. Martin’s, 1990) 110–27.\n\nThe announcements of Columbia Literary History of the United States (Q3195) and Cambridge History of American Literature (Q3205) elicited considerable discussion of canon and approach. See, for example, the following articles in American Literature: Annette Kolodny, “The Integrity of Memory: Creating a New Literary History of the United States,” 57.2 (1985): 291–307; William C. Spengemann, “American Things / Literary Things: The Problem of American Literary History,” 57.3 (1985): 456–81; Emory Elliott, “New Literary History: Past and Present,” 57.4 (1985): 611–21; Sacvan Bercovitch, “America as Canon and Context: Literary History in a Time of Dissensus,” 58.1 (1986): 99–107.\n\nColumbia Literary History of the United States (CLHUS). Emory Elliott, gen. ed. New York: Columbia UP, 1988. 1,263 pp. PS92.C64 810′.9.\n\nA collaborative history of literature in English and other languages from twelfth-century painted cave narratives to the 1980s. Organized by traditional periods (the beginnings to 1810, 1810 to 1885, 1885 to 1910, 1910 to 1945, 1945 to the present), each section begins with a discussion of cultural and intellectual contexts and includes essays on genres, movements, major writers, regions, groups, or historical developments. Rather than attempt a consensus or an integrated narrative, the chapters (each by a distinguished scholar) employ a variety of critical approaches and reflect the diversity of the country’s literary heritage by treating ethnic, minority, regional, and Native American literatures and works by women as well as established writers, and popular as well as elite literature. Since many writers are discussed in several chapters, users must be certain to consult the index of subjects, persons, and titles. Admirably fulfilling the editor’s criteria for a good literary history (“that it have a good index, readable type, sensible chapter divisions, and interesting and informative essays, and that it be inexpensive, durable, and not too heavy”), this is a worthy, much-needed successor to Literary History of the United States (Q3200). Unfortunately, it includes no bibliography volume, and the essays lack documentation or a list of suggested readings. For an outline of the project, see Emory Elliott, “New Literary History: Past and Present,” American Literature 57.4 (1985): 611–21.\n\nWhile the Columbia Literary History’s critical reception has been deservedly favorable, it has been criticized for its handling of regional, especially western, literature by James H. Maguire, “The Canon and the ‘Diminished Thing,’” American Literature 60.4 (1988): 643–52. Review: Larzer Ziff, American Quarterly 42.1 (1990): 102–07.\n\nA New Literary History of America, ed. Greil Marcus and Werner Sollors (Cambridge: Belknap–Harvard UP, 2009; 1,095 pp.; Harvard UP Reference Lib.) is more a cultural history (“a reexamination of the American experience as seen through a literary glass”) than a literary one. The separately authored essays, which are arranged chronologically from 1507 to 4 November 2008, cover literary authors and works (e.g., Bradstreet, Last of the Mohicans, Emerson, Moby-Dick, Dickinson, and Frost) as well as a host of other topics (e.g., John Foster’s woodcut of Richard Mather, Charles Peale’s exhibition of mastodon bones, the siege of the Alamo, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” Charlie Chaplin, Louis Brandeis’s opinion in Whitney v. California, country music, Pete Rozelle as NFL Commissioner, Linda Lovelace, and the election of Barack Obama as the forty-fourth president). With one exception, essays conclude with a list of suggested readings. Indexed by persons, titles of movies, and some subjects. Although New Literary History numbers a host of major scholars among its contributors, it is ultimately a pastiche of mostly unconnected essays, several of which are tangential to literary history. Reviews: Mark Bauerlein and Priscilla Wald, Chronicle of Higher Education 6 Nov. 2009: B13–B18; Gregory Jay, Modern Language Quarterly 72.4 (2011): 537–42 .\n\nLiterary History of the United States: History (LHUS). Ed. Robert E. Spiller et al. 4th ed. New York: Macmillan; London: Collier, 1974. 1,556 pp. PS88.L522 810′.9.\n\nA collaborative history by leading scholars and critics of the literature of the United States through the early 1970s (but emphasizing the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth centuries) and accompanied by a separate Bibliography volume (Q3300). Organized more or less chronologically, the 11 sections include chapters on cultural and historical background, genres, major authors, regions, and movements. Except for new chapters on Emily Dickinson and literature since World War II, the fourth edition essentially preserves the text of the first (1948). The History and Bibliography are complementary volumes and must be used together (the highly selective bibliography at the end of the History is meant for the “general” reader). Indexed by persons and some subjects.\n\nCriticized for its unevenness in scale and quality, the formulaic nature of many chapters, and emphasis on history at the expense of criticism, but recognized for many years as the indispensable literary history of the United States, LHUS exerted a major influence on scholarship for many years after its publication and served as a godsend for two generations of doctoral candidates studying for preliminary examinations. Although superseded by Columbia Literary History of the United States (Q3195), it remains a major document in the historiography of American literary history. For the inception, organization, composition, and editing of LHUS, see Robert E. Spiller, “History of a History: A Study in Cooperative Scholarship,” PMLA 89.3 (1974): 602–16, and especially Vanderbilt, American Literature and the Academy (Q3209), which also examines the academic politics behind the work, traces its critical reception, and offers a detailed assessment (pp. 413–60, 499–531, passim).

The overall organization is chronological, the approach historical and contextual rather than biographical and canonical or “totalizing or encyclopedic” with lengthy sections by major scholars (e.g., Emory Elliott on Puritan literature, Wendy Steiner on postmodern fiction, Frank Lentricchia on modern poetry, and Gerald Graff on modern criticism) who incorporate minority, popular, Native American, and ethnic literature in treating genres, themes, representative authors, and the literary marketplace. For a discussion of the broad principles underlying the History, see Sacvan Bercovitch, “America as Canon and Context: Literary History in a Time of Dissensus,” American Literature 58.1 (1986): 99–107 and “The Problem of Ideology in American Literary History,” Critical Inquiry 12.4 (1986): 631–53 (subsequently revised in The Rites of Assent: Transformations in the Symbolic Construction of America [New York: Routledge, 1993] 353–76).\n\nEach volume concludes with a chronology and a virtually useless list of “especially influential” books; unfortunately, the essays lack notes, and there is no bibliography volume planned. Indexed by persons, subjects, and titles of anonymous works (the online version omits the indexes). Like so many recent literary histories, the Cambridge History of American Literature eschews continuity in favor of polyphony, pluralism, and—inevitably—imbalance. Yet the quality of the contributors ensures that it will assume an influential—perhaps canonical—place among histories of American literatures. Reviews: (vol. 1) Mitchell Breitweiser, Modern Language Quarterly 56.2 (1995): 197–206; Philip F. Gura, New England Quarterly 68.1 (1995): 118–38; William S. Spengemann, Early American Literature 29.3 (1993): 276–94; Leonard Tennenhouse, Modern Language Quarterly 56.2 (1995): 207–20; Larzer Ziff, Modern Language Quarterly 56.2 (1995): 189–96; (vol. 2) Freddie Baveystock, English 45.182 (1996): 157–63.\n\nThe New Cambridge History replaces the outdated Cambridge History of American Literature (CHAL), ed. William Peterfield Trent et al., 4 vols. (New York: Putnam’s; Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1917–21; online as The Cambridge History of English and American Literature [1]). For a detailed account of the genesis, editing, publication, and reception—as well as an assessment—of CHAL, see Vanderbilt, American Literature and the Academy (Q3209), pp. 3–28, 153–83, 221–36, passim.\n\nVanderbilt, Kermit. American Literature and the Academy: The Roots, Growth, and Maturity of a Profession. Philadelphia: U of Pennsylvania P, 1986. 609 pp. PS62.V28 8109.791273.\n\nA history of the origins and development of the study of American literature in the United States from 1829 through 1948. Organized in three periods (1829–1921, 1921–39, 1939–48), chapters examine in detail the professional lives, publications, and other contributions of major scholars; the genesis, production, critical reception, and importance of major literary histories (especially Cambridge History of American Literature [Q3205a] and Literary History of the United States [Q3200]), scholarly works, and journals (particularly American Literature and PMLA); the introduction of American literature into secondary and higher education; the development of professional organizations (especially the American Literature Group of the MLA); and the academic politics that shaped the profession. An appendix lists the leaders of the American Literature Group from 1921 through 1948. Drawing extensively on unpublished materials, Vanderbilt offers a fascinating, critical (but not always impartial) account of the evolution of the academic study of American literature in the United States. Organizers of a major cooperative scholarly venture will find the accounts of CHAL and LHUS both instructive and sobering. Readers who are English literature specialists will wish for a similar history of their profession.\n\nHistory of Southern Literature (Q3615).\n\nLiterary History of the American West (Q3660).\n\nRuoff and Ward, Redefining American Literary History (Q3695).\n\nHart, James D. The Oxford Companion to American Literature. 6th ed. with revisions and additions by Phillip W. Leininger. New York: Oxford UP, 1995. 779 pp. PS21.H3 810.9′003. Online through Oxford Reference (I530).\n\nA wide-ranging encyclopedia, with more than 5,000 entries on authors and other persons, works, literary terms, characters, movements and groups, awards, organizations, periodicals, historical and cultural events, foreign writers, and a host of other topics related to American literature. The bulk of the entries are for authors (recording basic career information) and plot summaries of elite as well as popular works. Concludes with a chronology of literary and social history, 1578–1994. Entries for individuals in the fourth through sixth editions are indexed in Biography and Genealogy Master Index (J565). Breadth, accuracy, judicious selection, and wealth of detail have made the Oxford Companion the essential source of quick reference for beginning student through accomplished scholar.\n\nA good supplement because of its inclusion of numerous minor writers is W. J. Burke and Will D. Howe, American Authors and Books: 1640 to the Present Day, 3rd rev. ed., rev. Irving Weiss and Anne Weiss (New York: Crown, 1972; 719 pp.). Besides writers of all kinds, it has entries for works, literary characters, periodicals, newspapers, publishers, literary terms, associations, book collectors, libraries, places, and literature-related subjects. (Entrants are indexed in Biography and Genealogy Master Index [J565].) The first edition—American Authors and Books, 1640–1940 (New York: Gramercy, 1943; 858 pp.)—remains useful for the numerous entries omitted in later editions.\n\nHarperCollins Reader’s Encyclopedia of American Literature, ed. George Perkins, Barbara Perkins, and Phillip Leininger, 2nd ed. (New York: Harper, 2002; 1,126 pp.) and Encyclopedia of American Literature, ed. Steven R. Serafin (New York: Continuum, 1999; 1,305 pp.; online through Credo Reference [2]) offer somewhat more lengthy entries on writers, works, genres, groups, movements, and other topics than is typical in literary encyclopedias. The latter, with some 1,300 entries, is neither “a comprehensive survey” nor “the most extensive single-volume treatment of its subject available,” as its editor claims. The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature, ed. Jay Parini, 4 vols. (New York: Oxford UP, 2004; online through Oxford Reference [I530]), offers even lengthier entries, but its more than 350 authors, works, movements, institutions, ethnic literatures, and literary forms are obviously chosen and written about with the targeted student or general reader in mind.\n\nEncyclopedia of American Studies. Ed. Miles Orvell. Johns Hopkins University. Johns Hopkins UP, 2013. 11 Sept. 2013. <http://eas-ref.press.jhu.edu>. Updated quarterly.\n\nEncyclopedia of American Studies. Ed. George T. Kurian, Miles Orvell, Johnnella E. Butler, and Jay Mechling. 5 vols. New York: Grolier, 2001. E169.1.E625 973′.03.\n\nAn encyclopedia for the student of the cultures of the United States. Ranging across folk, vernacular, elite, regional, sectarian, and mass cultures, the entries (which range from 500 to 5,000 words and which are, for the most part, written by established scholars) use an interdisciplinary approach to a topic and its relation to American culture in encompassing such areas as communication, economics, ethnicity, the arts, gender, national identity, the environment, religion, and technology—in short, virtually any area of interest to the discipline of American studies. The online version, which expands and updates the print version but does not reproduce its illustrations, can be browsed by individual entries or by broad subject areas and their subheadings. Keyword searches can be limited to full text, title, contributors, or bibliographies. Entries can be formatted for printing, or citations to entries can be saved (in MLA or Chicago style) for e-mailing. Although the database is updated quarterly, there is currently no provision for identifying new or updated entries.\n\nBecause of the broad scope of the majority of entries, readers of the print version should begin with the subject index in vol. 4 (e.g., while Amish, Civilian Conservation Corps, and Works Progress Administration lack individual entries, they are discussed under broader ones). Sporting readable discussions and aptly chosen illustrations in the print version, Encyclopedia of American Studies is a browser’s delight and a source of authoritative overviews of aspects of American culture.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to Women’s Writing in the United States. Ed. Cathy N. Davidson and Linda Wagner-Martin. New York: Oxford UP, 1995. 1,021 pp. PS147.094 810.9′9287′03. Online through Oxford Reference (I530).\n\nA dictionary of United States women writers, literary forms (including fiction, poetry, and drama as well as such forms as travel writing, recipe books, and spiritual narratives), literary periods, regions, themes, ethnic literatures, concepts and issues associated with feminism and women writers, cultural and historical issues, and publishing. The 771 signed entries (by an impressive array of contributors) range from brief pieces to extensive essays; they usually conclude with a selective bibliography (though these are not always as current as one should expect) and, frequently, with a note on the location of the subject’s papers. A chronology of social history, everyday life, and women’s writing and a selective bibliography end the volume. Indexed by persons and subjects; entrants are also indexed in Biography and Genealogy Master Index (J565). The judicious selectivity, extensive coverage and quality of entries, and efficient cross-referencing and indexing give Oxford Companion to Women’s Writing pride of place among the dictionaries of women writers in the United States.\n\nEhrlich, Eugene, and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford UP, 1982. 464 pp. PS141.E74 917.3′04.\n\nAn illustrated dictionary and gazetteer to 1,586 cities, towns, and villages associated with more than 1,500 writers from colonial times to the present. The towns are organized alphabetically within region, then state; the entry for each locality describes its associations with writers or its use as setting and locates buildings, graves, and other sites of literary interest. Indexed by states and towns at the front, by authors at the back. Although the descriptions are not always based on firsthand investigation, some important sites are omitted, and the volume is too unwieldy to carry on a literary tour, this book is the most current and comprehensive guide to places in the United States that are associated with an author or literary work.

Annals of American Literature, 1602–1983. New York: Oxford UP, 1986. 342 pp. PS94.L83 810.2′02.\n\nA chronology of important and representative literary works. The main column cites author, date of birth, title, and genre for each work. The secondary column lists historical and cultural events, the founding of serial publications, births and deaths of authors, and major foreign publications. (Beginning in 1783, this column is in two parts: American and foreign.) Although the arts are slighted in the secondary column, breadth and judicious selection make Annals of American Literature the best source for placing a work in its literary and historical context. It supersedes the treatment of American literature in Annals of English Literature (M1345).\n\nThe Chronology of American Literature: America’s Literary Achievements from the Colonial Era to Modern Times, ed. Daniel S. Burt (Boston: Houghton, 2004; 805 pp.; online through Credo Reference [3]), is more current (with coverage extending through 1999) and offers three- to four-sentence summaries of or commentaries on the importance of works, but the two-column layout (with works grouped by genre, type, or subject—e.g., drama and theater, poetry, nonfiction, literary criticism and scholarship, essays and philosophy, sermons and religious writing, and publications and events—and lists of births and deaths, popular books or bestsellers, and awards and prizes [including the “Noble Prize”] scattered at intervals throughout the text) and the lack of information on historical and social events make it impossible to contextualize a work (the principal purpose for which one consults a work such as this). Dates of birth and death appear only the first time an author is listed. The indexes of authors and titles exclude entries in the lists noted above unless a work also appears in the chronology proper.\n\nWomen writers and their social and historical contexts are more fully documented in Cynthia J. Davis and Kathryn West, Women Writers in the United States: A Timeline of Literary, Cultural, and Social History (New York: Oxford UP, 1996; 488 pp.).\n\nAlthough purporting to be an evaluative history of the bibliographical control of American belles lettres, Vito Joseph Brenni, The Bibliographic Control of American Literature, 1920–1975 (Metuchen: Scarecrow, 1979; 210 pp.), is too incomplete, poorly organized, inaccurately descriptive, uncritically evaluative, badly written, and inadequately indexed to be of much use.\n\nNilon, Charles H. Bibliography of Bibliographies in American Literature.

Entries are classified in four divisions: bibliography, authors (organized by century, then alphabetically), genres (including literary history and criticism), and ancillary subjects (including various forms, types, and topics such as children’s literature, dissertations, humor, regionalism, and travels). Occasional brief annotations comment on scope or publishing information. Indexed by titles and persons. Poor design makes scanning entries difficult. Nilon must be used with caution, since there are numerous omissions and inconsistencies in organization and since many works were not examined by the compiler. A major desideratum is an up-to-date, thorough bibliography of bibliographies of American literature.

Comp. and ed. J. Albert Robbins et al. 2nd ed. Athens: U of Georgia P, 1977. 387 pp. Z6620.U5 M6 [PS88] 016.81.\n\nA finding list of manuscripts—including journals, diaries, correspondence, galley and page proofs, documents, audio and video recordings, books with marginalia, and memorabilia—held in about 600 institutions in the United States. Among the approximately 2,800 Americans are all the major authors, selected minor ones, and several quasi-literary writers such as editors, publishers, theatrical performers and producers, literary critics and scholars, and a few public figures also known (sometimes remotely) as writers. Following each author, holdings are listed alphabetically by institutional symbol, with manuscripts identified only by type and item count. (Symbols for libraries and types of manuscripts are identified on pp. xxvii–liii.) A few institutional holdings are keyed to a list (on pp. 367–77) of calendars, inventories, checklists, and other finding aids. Concludes with two appendixes (pseudonyms and alternative names; authors for whom no holdings were reported [both should have been integrated into the main list of authors]) and a bibliography of catalogs and guides, including ones listing American manuscripts held abroad. The introduction is refreshingly frank about the limitations of the checklist, with the Notes on Coverage (pp. xxii–xxvi) listing institutions whose holdings are not covered or are incompletely reported. Although the dense pages of symbols and numbers are initially forbidding, researchers soon appreciate how much drudgery this checklist can save them. Even so, much work is left for users: they must write or visit institutions that have no published or online finding aids to determine their exact holdings, and they must consult the works listed in section F: Guides to Manuscripts and Archives to locate additional American manuscripts.

Wilmington: Scholarly Resources, 1977. 704 pp. Z1237.C89 [E195] 016.973.\n\nAn index to manuscript material written between 1763 and 1815 and described in catalogs of booksellers, autograph dealers, and auction houses in the United States. American Manuscripts covers selected dealers’ catalogs through 1970 but auction catalogs only before 1895, when publication of American Book Prices Current (U5415) began. Organized by date of manuscript, entries identify the catalog and note what kind of description it supplies (e.g., a summary, transcription, or reproduction). Dealers’ catalogs are keyed to a list in the back; auction catalogs are cited by the number used in McKay, American Book Auction Catalogues (U5400). Indexed by names. Although the bulk of the manuscripts are historical, Cripe and Campbell does index a considerable number of items of literary interest. Coverage of dealers’ catalogs is not comprehensive and the decision to omit auction catalogs after 1895 is unfortunate, since American Book Prices Current is far from thorough; nevertheless, American Manuscripts is an important work that will save researchers a few of the hours that must be spent in tracking down and poring through these scarce catalogs. Scholars need many more such indexes to manuscripts listed in catalogs.\n\nRaimo, John W., ed. A Guide to Manuscripts Relating to America in Great Britain and Ireland. [Rev. ed.] Westport: Meckler for British Assn. for Amer.

Raimo excludes the Public Record Office, British Library, Oxford and Cambridge libraries, and London Archives, since all have separate guides (identified in the introduction). Organized alphabetically by country, then county, city, and owner, the descriptions of collections identify groups of papers or individual manuscripts and cite transcriptions, catalogs, and other finding aids. The descriptions vary in detail, but most are helpfully precise. Locations are not cited for collections identified through the National Register of Archives (F285a) to encourage scholars to consult the finding aids held there. Indexed by subjects, persons, and places. Users must remember that this work is not comprehensive and that inclusion of a collection does not mean it is accessible to researchers. Although the bulk of the papers are historical or political, Raimo locates a significant number of literary manuscripts and thus is an important preliminary source for tracking down items in British collections.\n\nWomen’s History Sources: A Guide to Archives and Manuscript Collections in the United States.

Organized alphabetically by state, city, repository, and then collection title, entries record types of documents, inclusive dates, size, information on access, repository, existence of finding aids, contents, and published guides. Based on printed descriptions, responses to questionnaires, or on-site inspections, the descriptions vary considerably in sophistication, specificity, and accuracy. Indexed in vol. 2 by persons (including all forms of a woman’s name), subjects, occupations, and places. Although many libraries were unable to provide a thorough description of their holdings, Women’s History Sources is the essential guide to a wealth of little-known material, a decent portion of which is of literary interest.

Golden: North American–Fulcrum, 1995. 325 pp. Z1255.B55 016.81.\n\nA bibliography of works by 281 authors (from the Federal period to those who died before 1931) “who, in their own time at least, were known and read” and who primarily published belles lettres. Limited to separate publications (including books, broadsides, anthologies, and ephemera) and emphasizing initial appearances, BAL excludes altogether “periodical and newspaper publications, . . . unrevised reprints . . ., translations into other languages, [and] volumes containing isolated correspondence.” First American editions (along with variant issues and states) and English-language foreign editions preceding the first American one receive a full description; briefer descriptions are accorded volumes containing the first printing of a prose work (excluding letters) or poem, textually significant reprints or revised editions, nonbelletristic works, and edited texts. Authors are listed alphabetically, with works normally organized by date of publication in three parts: first or revised editions of books wholly or substantially by an author and books by others containing the first book publication of a work; reprints of an author’s own books; and books by others containing material by an author reprinted from earlier books, followed by a selection of bibliographies, biographies, and -ana. Some authors, because of the variety or complexity of their output, require a different organization (outlined in a headnote). A full entry includes title page, imprint, pagination, type of paper, size of leaf, collation, description of binding (including variants and notes on inserted ads, endpapers, binder’s and fly leaves), publication notes (citing copyright deposit date when possible and early advertisements), locations of copies examined, and miscellaneous notes, especially dealing with publishing history. These parts are repeated as necessary within an entry for each state or issue. The entry numbers have become the standard references for identifying an edition, state, or issue. Indexed by initials, pseudonyms, and anonyms in each volume. The Selective Index covers separately published works in three indexes: titles (with separate list of main titles and series titles); dates; publishers (organized by city). Entrants in vols. 1–8 are indexed in Biography and Genealogy Master Index (J565).\n\nUsers must study carefully the prefatory explanation of scope, limitations, organization, terminology, and parts of an entry (especially descriptive conventions); consult the headnote to an author for information on special limitations or organization; and remember that BAL does not list everything written by an author and is not a census of copies.\n\nThe online version allows users to browse the contents or search by a combination of keyword, title, imprint, author, location of copy, date of publication, and BAL number. Searches can be restricted to principal works, reprints and contributions, or references and -ana. Citations can be marked for e-mailing, printing, or downloading; full records can be printed or saved by screen capture one at a time. The CD-ROM version is obsolete since the search interface must be installed from 3.5-inch disks.\n\nAdditions and corrections once regularly appeared in the notes section of Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America; published additions and corrections through 1969 are listed in vol. 1, pp. 163–64, in Tanselle, Guide to the Study of United States Imprints (U5290). On the form for reporting additions and corrections, see G. Thomas Tanselle, “A Proposal for Recording Additions to Bibliographies,” Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 62.2 (1968): 227–36; “Additions to Bibliographies: With Notes on Procedure for BAL,” 73.1 (1979): 123–25. The BAL working papers and files, which contain much fuller descriptions and notes, additions, and corrections, can be consulted in the Manuscript Department, Houghton Library. Separately published main works are listed in the Epitome, but it does not incorporate additions or corrections to the original nine volumes.\n\nAlthough not comprehensive (especially in listing reprints), inconsistent in treating some kinds of works (such as foreign editions and reprints), and emphasizing nineteenth-century authors, BAL remains—for writers not the subject of a more recent, separately published descriptive bibliography—an indispensable source for identifying and locating first editions and appearances as well as important revised editions, for obtaining details of publishing and textual history, and for dating publication. For a history of the work, see W. H. Bond, “Jacob Blanck and BAL,” Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 86.2 (1992): 129–45. For the uses of BAL by those who are not primarily bibliographers, see Joseph R. McElrath, Jr., “From the Bibliography of American Literature to ‘The Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography’: Our Progressive Tradition,” Literary Research 14.1-4 (1989): 5–12; and Lawrence Buell, “The Bibliographical Conscience,” Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 86.2 (1992): 191–98. For the importance of BAL to British and American book-trade history, book collecting, and critical editing, see Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 86.2 (1992), a special issue that prints papers from a 1992 conference on BAL.\n\nThe meticulous examination of copies in public as well as private collections, extensive research in copyright records and publishers’ archives, and a remarkable degree of accuracy make BAL one of the monumental bibliographies of the twentieth century. Reviews: (vol. 1) John D. Gordan, Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 50.2 (1956): 201–04; James D. Hart, American Literature 28.3 (1956): 378–81; (vol. 7) Joel Myerson, Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 78.1 (1984): 45–56 (an important evaluation of the general strengths and shortcomings of BAL); (vols. 8–9) Richard Layman, Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 87.2 (1993): 259–63.\n\nMuch less satisfactory is Matthew J. Bruccoli et al., eds., First Printings of American Authors: Contributions toward Descriptive Checklists, 5 vols. (Detroit: Gale, 1977–87), an ambitious but flawed, inadequately descriptive record of the first American and English printings of separate publications by some 336 collectible authors from the seventeenth century through the 1970s. Given the paucity of information and inconsistencies in its presentation, First Printings is only occasionally useful for those few authors not in BAL or the subject of an author bibliography. For a detailed critique of the work, see William Matheson, “American Literary Bibliography—FPAA Style,” Review 1 (1979): 173–81.\n\nLiterary Writings in America: A Bibliography. 8 vols. Millwood: KTO, 1977. Z1225.L8 [PS88] 016.81.\n\nA reproduction of the card file prepared as a Works Progress Administration project whose goal was to compile a list of creative works and reviews published by Americans between 1850 and 1940. No record exists, however, of what or how many sources were actually examined. The approximately 250,000 cards are organized by author, then alphabetically by title within sections for bibliographies, collected works, separately published works, periodical publications, biographical sources, and critical studies (including reviews) about the author. Reviews are listed under both the reviewer and the author of the book reviewed. Each card usually records author, title, publication information (omitting publishers of books), and genre or type of work. Far from complete, haphazard in its coverage (especially of books), inconsistent in format, including numerous errors, and largely unedited, Literary Writings is only occasionally useful for identifying periodical contributions (especially of minor authors) that are not indexed elsewhere.

Annual. <http://als.dukejournals.org>. PS3.A47 810.\n\nA selective, evaluative survey of important studies, editions, biographies, and reference works. Currently, the volumes are divided into 21 chapters, each by an established scholar: Emerson, Thoreau, Fuller, and transcendentalism (Fuller was added in 1994); Hawthorne; Melville; Whitman and Dickinson (the latter was added in 1967); Mark Twain; James; Wharton and Cather (since 1997); Pound and Eliot (since 1974); Faulkner; Fitzgerald and Hemingway; literature to 1800; early-nineteenth-century literature; late-nineteenth-century literature (before 1994 a single chapter covered 1800–99); fiction, 1900 to 1930s; fiction, 1930s to 1960s; fiction, 1960s to the present; poetry, 1900 to 1940s; poetry, 1940s to the present; drama; foreign scholarship (since 1973, with separate essays on various countries); and general reference works (since 1977). Some earlier volumes include chapters on folklore (1965–74), Poe (1973–96), black literature (1977–88), and themes, topics, and criticism (1966–2009). The scope of some chapters has changed over the years, and the organization varies with the subject. Two indexes: scholars; subjects.\n\nJudicious selectivity, currency, and frank, authoritative evaluations (usually much fuller and more critical than in typical surveys of research) make ALS an indispensable guide to the year’s important scholarship and an essential source for keeping abreast of the increasing number of publications, especially in areas outside one’s immediate fields of interest. Together, the volumes offer an incomparable source for studying trends in American literary scholarship and an important complement to MLAIB (G335) and ABELL (G340), especially for the superior coverage of books.\n\nSince vol. 35 (for 1954), Year’s Work in English Studies (G330) includes American literature; however, ALS offers much fuller, more authoritative coverage.\n\nDuke, Maurice, Jackson R.

Each of the 14 chapters, which treat individuals or groups of authors, devotes sections to bibliographies, editions, manuscripts and letters (noting locations as well as scholarship), biographies, and criticism (with the last variously subdivided). Indexed by persons. The individual essays vary in selectivity and suggest topics for further research. The volume as a whole, however, would benefit from a statement of scope and policies governing the selection of scholarship and writers.\n\nHarbert, Earl N., and Robert A. Rees, eds.

Adams, Bryant, Cooper, Crane, Dickinson, Edwards, Franklin, Holmes, Howells, Irving, Longfellow, Lowell, Norris, Taylor, and Whittier. The original edition (1971; 442 pp.) included two additional essays, on southern literature. The surveys vary in selectivity, coverage of foreign scholarship and dissertations, currency (generally citing publications through 1980, with some as late as 1983), and organization. All have sections for bibliography, editions, manuscripts and letters, biographical studies, and criticism and offer suggestions for further research. The Dickinson essay treats recent studies separately; others incorporate new scholarship in the commentary. Unfortunately, citations do not provide full bibliographical information.

Listed alphabetically by scholar, entries are accompanied by full descriptive annotations, a few of which point out shortcomings in folklore methodology. (Most theses are not annotated.) Six indexes: literary authors; folklore genres; general theoretical studies (a single list with no headings); regional and ethnic studies (with headings only for African American and general regional and ethnic studies); humor (a single list with no headings); dialect, themes, and characters (again, with no headings). Although selective, Folklore and Literature gathers and clearly annotates studies that are not readily identifiable in the standard serial bibliographies and indexes in section G and that are frequently omitted from folklore bibliographies. Unfortunately, the utterly inadequate subject indexing means that users in search of studies of other than specific literary authors must skim all entries.\n\nLeary, Lewis.

Leary and John Auchard. 1968–1975. 1979. 745 pp. Z1225.L49 016.81.\n\nA bibliography of periodical articles, significant reviews, and review articles compiled from “Articles on American Literature Appearing in Current Periodicals” (Q3285a), MLAIB (G335), other bibliographies, and some journals not covered by the preceding. The 1900–50 compilation is limited primarily to English-language studies; the later volumes admit more foreign language articles but are also more selective. Entries are listed alphabetically in divisions for individual authors; almanacs, annuals, and gift books (1900–50 only); American literature, aims and methods; serial bibliographies; other bibliographies; biography (in the 1968–75 edition, the four preceding divisions became subdivisions—along with ethnic groups—under American literature); fiction; foreign influences and estimates; frontier; humor; Indian literature (in 1968–75, a classified section under American literature); language and style (added in 1950–67); libraries and reading; criticism; literary history; literary trends and attitudes (added in 1950–67); Negro literature (in 1968–75, a classified section under American literature); newspapers and periodicals; philosophy and philosophical trends; poetry; printing, publishing, and bookselling; prose (1900–50 only); regionalism; religion; science; social and political topics; societies; theater; and women (added in 1968–75). Since each volume includes additions and corrections to the preceding one(s), all three must be used together. There are numerous errors and inconsistencies (especially in recording dates and essential issue numbers), and articles treating more than one author or topic do not always receive multiple entries. (Thaddeo K. Babiiha discusses these problems in “The Faulkner Section in Leary’s Articles on American Literature, 1968–1975,” Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 75.1 [1981]: 93–98, but his generalizations are not completely accurate.) Although access would be enhanced by a more refined and detailed classification system, the volumes are a time-saving compilation. Because of their limitations, however, they must be supplemented by American Literary Scholarship (Q3265) and the serial bibliographies and indexes in section G. Review: (1950–67) J.

PS88.L522 810′.9.\n\nA series of selective, usually evaluative bibliographical essays organized in four extensively classified divisions: general resources and reference works, general literature (with subdivisions for periods, background studies, American language, folk literature, Indian lore and antiquities, and popular literature), movements and influences, and 239 individual authors (covering primary works, editions, biographies, criticism, bibliographies, and public collections of manuscripts). Throughout, the emphasis is on guiding readers to the best editions and studies; in addition, many essays point out topics needing study. The supplements are keyed to the original volume, and the Bibliography must be used in conjunction with the History (Q3200), even though the organization frequently differs. Indexed by authors, titles, and some subjects. Confusingly organized, with numerous errors, badly dated, and largely superseded by author, subject, and period bibliographies, LHUS is now principally useful as a guide to older scholarship.

A retrospective volume (designated vol. 0) covers 1954–63 (1972), and a Supplement (2 vols., 1980) adds entries to vols. 1–10.

Howard covers a limited number of institutions (whether completely is unclear) and apparently only theses devoted to an identifiable author. Entries are organized alphabetically under literary authors, with cross-references for studies of multiple authors. Two indexes: subjects (inadequate); thesis authors. Although marred by a completely inadequate explanation of scope and coverage, Theses in American Literature will save some hunting through elusive institutional lists. Theses on southern writers are more fully covered in Emerson and Michael, Southern Literary Culture (Q3630). A companion volume is devoted to Theses in English Literature (M1395).\n\nWoodress, James. Dissertations in American Literature, 1891–1966. Rev. and enl.

The approximately 4,700 entries, most of which are taken from standard national dissertation bibliographies or other published lists, are organized alphabetically by author in 34 divisions: individual authors; almanacs, gift books, and annuals; American Revolution; Civil War; criticism; drama; economic studies; education and scholarship; fiction; fine arts; folklore; foreign relationships; humor and satire; Indians; language; libraries and reading; literary history; literary nationalism; lyceum; Negro literature; nonfictional prose; periodicals and journalism; philosophy and intellectual history; poetry; politics and government; printing, publishing, and censorship; psychology and literature; Puritanism; regionalism; religion; science and technology; transcendentalism; travel; and writers and writing. Those for genres, foreign relationships, language, literary history, periodicals and journalism, and regionalism are further classified. Each division or section concludes with cross-references to related dissertations. An entry cites author, title, institution, department (if other than English), and year and indicates when a dissertation has been published. Indexed by dissertation writers. Although not comprehensive and citing dissertations never completed, this is a time-saving compilation from standard bibliographies (especially because of the inclusion of studies accepted by departments other than English). It must be supplemented, however, by works listed in section H: Guides to Dissertations and Theses.\n\nSec.

Orr, Jr. Supplement, 1956–1965. 1976. 526 pp. Z1215.U53 016.9173.\n\nA selective, albeit extensive, annotated bibliography of books published through 1965 that are important to the understanding of the United States. The approximately 9,400 entries—most accompanied by extensive descriptive annotations that typically cite related works—are classified in 32 chapters covering all aspects of history; culture; the humanities; the arts; and social, natural, and physical sciences. The best approach to the contents is through the extensive index of persons, titles, and subjects. Although dated, this study remains the fullest general guide to works essential for investigating life and thought before 1965 in the United States.

Z1236.F77 016.9173′03.\n\nA guide to important primary and secondary works published to 30 June 1970 on the political, social, constitutional, economic, cultural, and diplomatic history of the United States. The books and articles, selected on the basis of “potential usefulness,” are variously organized in divisions for research methods and materials (with sections on reference works, printed public documents, and unpublished primary sources), biographies and personal records (with sections on travels and descriptions and on biographies), comprehensive and area histories (with a section on regional, state, and local histories), and numerous subjects. The first division consists of a narrative interspersed with lists of works; the other divisions are made up of classified lists. Two indexes: authors (with titles following each author); subjects. Once a standard resource, Harvard Guide to American History is now useful primarily as a guide to studies published before mid-1970. Review: Justus D. Doenecke, History Teacher 8.2 (1975): 317–21.\n\nSalzman, Jack, ed. American Studies: An Annotated Bibliography. 3 vols. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1986. 1984–1988. 1990. 1,085 pp. Z1361.C6 A436 [E169.1] 016.973.\n\nAn annotated bibliography of English-language books and collections of essays through 1988 on the culture of the United States. Salzman excludes journal articles, theoretical and methodological studies, and reference works, as well as most studies of single authors and, in 1984–1988, books published outside the United States. In the three-volume compilation, the 7,634 entries are listed alphabetically by author in 11 variously classified divisions: anthropology and folklore (including sections on minorities, ethnic groups, and linguistics); art and architecture; history (with sections on women, ethnicity, black history, and Native Americans); literature (with sections on general surveys, historical periods, and themes); music; political science; popular culture (with sections on general studies, literature, various genres and types of popular fiction, comics, entertainment, film, media, and material culture); psychology; religion; science, technology, and medicine; and sociology. Introducing each division are a brief overview of important reference works (including some published as late as 1986) and, in too few instances, a discussion of criteria determining scope and selection. All but a few annotations are full and accurate descriptions of content. Three indexes in vol. 3: authors; titles; subjects.\n\nThe supplement for 1984–88 separates anthropology and folklore, adds a division for autobiographies and memoirs, omits science, lacks the introductory overviews of reference sources, offers a brief statement of general editorial policy but an inadequate explanation of the scope of individual divisions, and inexplicably omits several entries that appeared in the continuation of the original bibliography in Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies 10–11 (1987). Two indexes: scholars; titles (with numbers referring to pages rather than entries). The lack of a subject index is inexcusable, especially since so many of the books (each of which is listed in only one section) cover several topics. The volumes for journal articles and books published outside the United States never appeared. Although divisions vary considerably in quality and authoritativeness (with many lacking a clear focus and effective organization), the work offers the most extensive general guide to books through 1988 on several aspects of American culture.

Murphey, gen. ed., American Studies: An Annotated Bibliography of Works on the Civilization of the United States, 4 vols. (Washington: US Information Agency, 1982), which lists articles in several divisions but which is not widely available in the United States. Basler, Mugridge, and McCrum, Guide to the Study of the United States of America (Q3325), remains useful for its breadth and inclusion of many earlier books. The same cannot be said for David W.

Millwood: KTO, 1904–78.\n\nA bibliography of scholarship on all aspects of American history. Until the volumes for 1962–73, the work annotated books, articles, and dissertations, but subsequent volumes are unannotated and limited to journal articles and dissertations (with the majority of the former taken from Recently Published Articles [Washington: Amer. Historical Assn., 1976–90], which originally appeared in various forms in each issue of American Historical Review 1–80.3 [1895–1975]). The volumes for 1904–05 and 1941–47 were never published. In the volumes for 1962–1985/86, entries are listed by scholar in three classified divisions: periods (including a section for bibliographies), regions, and subjects (including sections for literature, theater, and popular culture). Later volumes have an additional division for general works (with the bibliography section relocated to here) and a section for language in the subjects division. Several works receive multiple listings. Indexed by authors. Earlier volumes are variously organized, with the later ones having a tripartite division: the historical professions; national history (with literature, theater, and folklore sections in the cultural history subdivision); and regional, state, and local history. Indexed by names, places, and subjects (although not all volumes have subject indexing); cumulative index, 1902–40: Index to the Writings on American History, 1902–1940 (Washington: Amer. Historical Assn., 1956; 1,115 pp.). Although the post-1961 volumes would benefit from a more refined classification system in the first two divisions as well as subject indexing, this work includes literary studies from periodicals not covered by the standard bibliographies and indexes in section G.

An online version is now available at http://www.daredictionary.com/.\n\nA dictionary of more than 60,000 words and phrases of folk usage or whose form or meaning is confined to a region or regions of the United States or to a social group. Includes Black English, Gullah, Hawaiʻian pidgin, and the language of children’s games, but excludes artificial forms, criminal argot, trade jargon, and restricted occupational vocabularies. Information is drawn from 1,002 lengthy DARE questionnaires, other oral sources, and written works, with the heaviest reliance on the last. A typical entry consists of headword, part of speech, pronunciation, variant spellings, etymology for words not treated in standard dictionaries, geographic distribution, usage labels (including frequency, currency, type of user, and manner of use), cross-references, definition, and illustrative quotations from printed and oral sources. Some entries are accompanied by maps that illustrate regional distribution. The admirably clear introduction in vol. 1 outlines the history of the dictionary; explains the editorial policy, maps, and regional labels; discusses language changes especially common in American folk speech; provides a guide to pronunciation; and prints the questionnaire and data about the informants. Vol. 6 includes a series of maps illustrating social and geographic distribution, a summary of data from the questionnaires, the DARE questionnaire, and an index by region, usage, and etymology. For explanations of the regional and social labels, see Luanne von Schneidemesser, “Regional Labels in DARE,” Dictionaries 18 (1997): 166–77, and George H.

Dialect Soc., 1999; 82 pp.; Pub. of the Amer. Dialect Soc. 82); a combined index for vols. 1–5 is available on the DARE Web site (as are copies of DARE Newsletter). Justifiably praised by reviewers for its substantial scholarship, DARE is a major contribution to dialect studies, sociolinguistics, and areal linguistics in the United States; an essential source for the explication of regional and folk terms in American literature; and a delight to browse.

PE2835.C72 427.9.\n\nA dictionary of words originating in the United States, having greater currency in that nation than elsewhere, or “denoting something which has a real connection with the development of the country and the history of its people.” Slang and dialect terms are limited to early or prominent examples. Although the cutoff date for new words is the end of the nineteenth century, illustrative quotations extend to c. 1925. A typical entry consists of headword, definitions arranged by part of speech, illustrative dated quotations from printed sources for each meaning, combined forms, and, occasionally, pronunciation and etymology. Vol. 4 concludes with a bibliography of sources. Although far from complete, this pioneering work remains an essential source for the history of American English and the explication of American literary works. It must be complemented by Dictionary of Americanisms (Q3360), which is more current and accurate, and Dictionary of American Regional English (Q3350). Supplemented by Joseph A.

PE2835.D5 427.9.\n\nA dictionary of words originating in the United States, other words with a particular American meaning, and foreign terms adopted in American English through c. 1950. A typical entry consists of headword, pronunciation and etymology for words originating in the United States and foreign terms, definitions organized by part of speech, dated illustrative quotations from printed sources for each meaning, combined forms, and occasionally a line drawing. Vol. 2 concludes with a bibliography of sources. Some additions, corrections, and antedatings are indexed in Wall, Words and Phrases Index (U6025). More restrictive than other dictionaries in defining “Americanism” (and unfortunately vague in delineating criteria governing inclusion of certain kinds of words), this work corrects several attributions of Americanisms in Dictionary of American English (Q3355), Oxford English Dictionary (M1410), and English Dialect Dictionary (M1415). Although DA is generally more accurate in recording Americanisms than the preceding, these dictionaries are complementary and, along with Dictionary of American Regional English (Q3350) and updates in The Barnhart Dictionary Companion (Q3365a), essential sources for the historical study of American English and explication of American literary works.

The approximately 450,000 words blend entries from the second edition with new words and meanings, but unlike its predecessor the third edition omits proper names that are not generic, terms obsolete before 1775, and “comparatively useless or obscure words.” A typical main entry includes selected variant spellings; pronunciation, with variants used by educated speakers; part of speech; inflectional forms; a note on capitalization practices; etymology; status label; subject label; definitions, in historical order; illustrative quotations largely from twentieth-century sources; usage notes; cross-references; synonyms; and combined forms. Those consulting the third edition for more than a quick definition must study the detailed prefatory explanation of parts of a main entry. The preliminary matter also includes a section on forms of address.\n\nSome later printings list additions before the main alphabet.

[New ed.] Oxford: Oxford UP, 1997. 357 pp.\n\nWebster’s Third has received a decidedly mixed reception, with the popular press generally condemning the work but linguists and lexicographers considerably more positive toward many of its innovations (especially definition style) and departures from the venerable second edition. Features that have drawn the most criticism include the typographical design; the lowercasing of all proper names (except one sense of God) used as headwords, with some confusing notes on capitalization practices; unnecessary citations; deletion of obsolete words; flaws in etymologies; omission of usage labels (the major criticism of those who mistakenly think that a dictionary should arbitrate usage); a confusing system for recording pronunciation; and definitions that are frequently too abridged.\n\nHowever one judges its lexicographical practices, Webster’s Third is an essential, if flawed, source for the study of the vocabulary of its time (especially in the United States). For the explication of American literary works, it must be used with the unsuperseded second edition, Webster’s New International Dictionary of the English Language (Webster’s Second), ed.

Supplement I updates chapters through the relationship with British English; Supplement II, from pronunciation through slang. Non-English dialects are briefly discussed in an appendix to the fourth edition. Two indexes in each volume: words and phrases; persons, subjects, and titles. Stylistically entertaining but hardly impartial, full of errors, weak in organization, and emphasizing description and accumulation of examples rather than analysis, American Language has had a mixed reception. (For the origins, evolution, and reception of the work, see Raymond Nelson, “Babylonian Frolics: H. L. Mencken and The American Language,” American Literary History 11.4 [1999]: 668–98.) It remains the fullest account of American English, even if one disagrees with Mencken’s argument for its status as a language. Reviews: (supplements) Raven I. McDavid, Jr., Language 23.1 (1947): 68–73; 25.1 (1949): 69–77.\n\nAmerican National Biography Online (ANB). Amer. Council of Learned Socs.–Oxford UP, 2000–10. 3 Jan. 2013. <http://www.anb.org>. Updated quarterly. CD-ROM.\n\nAmerican National Biography (ANB). Ed. John A. Garraty and Mark C. Carnes. 24 vols. New York: Oxford UP, 1999. Supplement 1. Ed. Paul Betz and Carnes. 2002. 926 pp. Supplement 2. Ed. Carnes. 2005. 835 pp. CT213.A68 920.073.\n\nA biographical dictionary of more than 17,400 individuals who died before 1996 and whose achievement, fame, or notoriety occurred while living in what is now the United States or who “directly influenced the course of American history.” Entries, which range from 750 to 7,500 words, chronicle the subject’s life and career; most conclude with a note on the location of the individual’s papers and a selected bibliography. Four indexes: biographees; contributors (with a list of contributions); state or country of birth; occupation or realm of renown. Supplement 2 ends with a cumulative, updated index of occupations or realms of renown classified under 17 topical areas. Biographees are also indexed in Biography and Genealogy Master Index (J565). The supplements include individuals who died after 1996 (admitting “a few people of admittedly ephemeral significance”) as well as notable persons overlooked in the main volumes.\n\nThe online version is updated quarterly with new biographies, illustrations, internal and external hyperlinks, and revisions to existing entries and bibliographies; unfortunately, the Web site does not identify revised articles. (A 6 July 2006 e-mail communication from Carnes suggests that revisions will be limited to factual matters.) Quick Search allows for a keyword search of full text. In Advanced Search, users can search by a combination of full-text keyword, name, realm of renown, occupation, birth date, death date, United States state of birth, country of birth outside the United States, and contributor; searches can be restricted to the text of an article or to a bibliography, to articles with illustrations or online resources, and by gender and update. Articles can be printed or e-mailed. An impressive editorial achievement that numbers a legion of major scholars among the contributors, American National Biography is a fully worthy successor to Dictionary of American Biography (Q3380) and will remain the country’s standard national biography for the foreseeable future.

The 19,173 entries encompass the eminent and the notorious, although the scope is less catholic than that of its model, the Dictionary of National Biography (M1425a). Written by established authorities, the sketches range from 500 to 16,500 words in the original dictionary, but are limited to 5,000 words after the fourth supplement; combine factual information and interpretation based on extensive original research; and conclude with a short list of sources, which frequently locates unpublished materials. With Supplement Five, much of the extensive family and other personal data are recorded only on forms stored in the DAB archives in the Library of Congress. Errata to the original 20 volumes are printed in vol. 1, pp. xxii–xxxvi, of the 1964 reprint, which also makes some corrections within entries. The Comprehensive Index indexes the corrected reprint and the supplements by biographees, contributors, birthplaces, schools and colleges, occupations, and topics. The history of the work is outlined in vol. 1, pp. vii–xvi, of the 1964 reprint. Although there are errors and notable omissions (especially of women, who account for only 625 of the 13,633 entries in the original 20 volumes) and although the American National Biography Online (Q3378) supersedes many entries, the DAB remains useful for its historical perspective and for the biographies of individuals not included in the ANB.

Schlesinger, American Historical Review 35.1 (1929): 119–26; 35.3 (1930): 624–25; 36.2 (1931): 402–05; 37.2 (1932): 353–56; 38.2 (1933): 336–38; 39.2 (1934): 337–38; 40.2 (1935): 343–47; 41.2 (1936): 344–46; 41.4 (1936): 761–63; 42.4 (1937): 769–73.\n\nThe following are important, if much less trustworthy, sources for information on persons excluded from DAB or ANB:\n\nAppleton’s Cyclopædia of American Biography. Ed. James Grant Wilson and John Fiske. 6 vols. and supplement. New York: Appleton, 1887–1900. The Cyclopedia of American Biography: Supplementary Edition. Ed. James E. Homans, L. E. Dearborn, and Herbert M. Linen. Vols. 7–10. New York: Press Assn., 1918–26. Because of numerous fictitious biographies and fabricated publications, the original six volumes must be used with caution; see Margaret Castle Schindler, “Fictitious Biography,” American Historical Review 42.4 (1937): 680–90, and John Blythe Dobson, “The Spurious Articles in Appleton’s Cyclopædia of American Biography—Some New Discoveries and Considerations,” Biography 16.4 (1993): 388–408, for accounts of these deliberate falsifications.\n\nThe National Cyclopedia of American Biography. 76 vols. Clifton: White, 1898–1984. Includes a considerable number of persons not in the DAB. Because of the nonalphabetic organization, the cumulative Index (1984; 576 pp.) is essential for locating entries.\n\nThe DAB, its supplements, Appleton’s Cyclopædia, and National Cyclopedia are indexed in Biography and Genealogy "
