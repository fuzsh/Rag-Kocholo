Green Award for Star Reporter of the Year while working at the Houston Chronicle. Since graduating college in 2012, journalism has taken her to five different states, where she's covered a nuclear research facility, the Missouri Legislature, the mishandling of sexual assault reports at colleges and universities and even NASA. Her reporting throughout the years has put two people in prison, resulted in federal investigations at higher education institutions and overhauled broken policies at the state and local level. She loves falling down information rabbit holes, playing in spreadsheets and listening to Gilmore Girls on repeat at work. When she's off the clock, you can usually find her playing with her dogs, Waffle and Moby, curled up on the couch with a good book or on her yoga mat.",

        "text": "Her son’s killer was found guilty. Now she wants the Harris County jail held accountable.\n\nDallas Garcia plans to do everything in her power to prevent another mom from losing her son or daughter to a Texas jail.\n\nUncounted: Harris County Jail didn’t report inmate deaths. Did state law require it?\n\nSix inmates suffered medical emergencies at the Harris County Jail and later died. Should their deaths have been reported under Texas law?\n\nHere are the six Harris County Jail inmates whose deaths were not reported to the state\n\nTexas law requires the disclosure of “custodial deaths” in jails. But confusion over what counts as “in custody” means some deaths go unreported.\n\nHarris County sheriff: Man, 62, dies after medical emergency in jail\n\nSheriff’s officials said Raymond Cooper died following a medical emergency while in custody, the 12th death reported at the jail this year.\n\nThis Harris County program serves the most vulnerable. But it won’t bail them out of jail.\n\nThe county-funded guardianship program is designed to help those with severe mental health cases in Houston, but its policies keep the inmates incarcerated.\n\n10 people have died in Harris County Jail in 2023. Five were identified as mentally ill\n\nThe Houston Landing found that half of the 10 people who have died in Harris County Jail this year previously had been identified as mentally ill by law enforcement, court or jail personnel.\n\nNew law could reveal why Texans with mental illnesses are languishing in jail\n\nA new law signed by Gov. Greg Abbott could reveal why the system is failing nearly 2,500 people in need of access to state-funded psychiatric care.\n\nNearly 200 people with mental illnesses died in Texas jails. The death toll is getting worse.\n\nDespite efforts to divert people from state jails into mental health treatment, our investigation shows the death toll of inmates with documented symptoms has exponentially grown since 2012.\n\nSearch our data: Inmates with mental illnesses who died in Texas jails over the past decade\n\nThe Houston Landing examined thousands of public records to determine how many people with mental illnesses died from unnatural causes in the custody of county and municipal jails across Texas over the last decade."
