        "text": "TOM PUTNAM: Good evening. I’m Tom Putnam, director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. And on behalf of Tom McNaught, executive director of the Kennedy Library Foundation, and all of my Library and Foundation colleagues, I thank you for coming.\n\nLet me begin by acknowledging the generous underwriters of the Kennedy Library Forums, including lead sponsor Bank of America, Boston Capital, the Boston Foundation, the Lowell Institute, Raytheon, and our media partners, WBUR, and assuming there's no conflict of interest here, the Boston Globe. [laughter] And we thank the Globe’s publisher Chris Mayer, who is here with us this evening for that ongoing support.\n\nWe are here tonight to mark the awarding of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Criticism to Sebastian Smee, for his vivid and exuberant writing about art. [applause] Often bringing great works of life, works to life with love and appreciation. Much of the work of this Library and the men and women we honor here depends on a vibrant free press. And this city is fortunate to have such a venerable and renowned daily newspaper. My mornings are often lightened when I come down to our kitchen and see one of my children having breakfast while reading the Boston Globe. The tradition lives on.\n\nSo, in learning of Sebastian Smee’s award this spring, we proposed crafting a panel featuring him and other past Pulitzer Prize-winning Globe journalists, including—and I will quote from their original award citations, although I will quote Charles Savage first, and he is en route in flight, and he’ll be here in just a few minutes. Charles Savage, his national reporting in 2007 revealed how President Bush often used signing statements to assert his controversial right to bypass provisions of new laws.\n\nWalter Robinson, for the Globe’s courageous comprehensive coverage of sexual abuse by priests in 2003, an effort that pierced secrecy, stirred local, national and international reaction, and produced changes in the Roman Catholic Church. Ellen Goodman, who won the Pulitzer in 1980 for distinguished commentary. A reporter for ten years, before ever writing a column, the joke at the time was that her editor, Tom Winship, made Ellen a columnist in an effort to get her opinions out of the newsroom. [laughter]\n\nAnd Tom Oliphant, who earned his Pulitzer in 1975, as part of the Globe’s massive and balanced coverage of the Boston school desegregation crisis. One of our favorite moderators, Tom often reminds us, through his amazing recall of arcane, historical and political facts, that an Oliphant never forgets. [laughter]\n\nAnd, just as a group of talented musicians cannot truly become an orchestra without a conductor, our daily paper comes to us through the orchestration of the Globe’s editor, Marty Barron, who we’ve asked to share a few words to launch this evening’s discussion. Before joining the Globe a decade ago, Mr. Barron held top editing positions at the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and the Miami Herald. Under his leadership the Globe has won five Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nLet me conclude with an excerpt from a recent review of the Museum of Fine Arts written by Sebastian Smee. “After returning to the Art of the Americas Wing a few months after its historic opening, the experience made me freshly alive to how much about the whole project succeeds— not just passively, but quite brilliantly. There is so much subtlety in the hang, so many surprising connections that speak volumes, and so much variety in the styles of display. The ambition of the whole undertaking alone is thrilling.”\n\nAnd the same might be said for the audacity of all those who publish one of our country’s finest daily newspapers, with stories that enlighten our minds and connect us to others, a noble endeavor that often succeeds brilliantly in helping us to be freshly alive to the world around us. Please join me now in welcoming Marty Barron and our distinguished panel of Pulitzer Prize winners to the Kennedy Library.\n\n[applause]\n\nMARTY BARRON: Thank you all for coming. And thank you Tom and the Kennedy Library for hosting a program that champions journalism of the highest ambition and standards. You know, ever since the first Pulitzer Prizes were awarded in 1917, they have been a call to excellence for journalists. The journalists on the podium, the panelists and our distinguished moderator, Tom Oliphant, all of them treasured colleagues of mine, have answered that call by every measure.\n\nLet me just say a few quick words about these extraordinary panelists and Pulitzer winners. First Ellen Goodman. Upon her retirement in 2010 from regular writing on the Globe’s op-ed page, her colleague, James Carroll, penned a much deserved testimonial. “Ellen had become,” he wrote, “one of those who transformed the question of gender inequality into the second geat civil rights movement.”\n\nAnd he continued, “The pace of life, intimate relationships, sexuality removed from reproduction, workplace transformations, how we die, environmental degradation, men and women at war, matrimonial rights, and rights in marriage, with ancient assumptions undercut, this indispensable columnist regularly offered a model of moral reasoning while always making clear how these are not ‘women issues’ but belong to us all.” We certainly miss Ellen at the Globe. And I know that many of our readers do as well.\n\n[applause]\n\nNext I’ll mention Charlie Savage, who I guess will be here any minute. Hope so. You know, Charlie is now at a pretty good newspaper, the New York Times. [laughter] But I’ll wager that he’ll always be remembered for his work, his path breaking work at the Boston Globe. Charlie won for his stories, as Tom mentioned, on how George W. Bush’s expanded use of signing statements allowed the president to disregard laws that had been passed by Congress.\n\nAnd after Charlie won the Pulitzer Prize, many noted that he and the Globe were typically a lonely voice drawing attention to an aggressive, unprecedented and possibly extra-Constitutional expansion of the presidential power. At the time, I remarked publicly that Charlie won because he covers what the White House does, not just what it says. We can certainly use more of that among the press corps in Washington. And we can all be glad that Charlie is still there doing it.\n\n[applause]\n\nSebastian Smee. At the Globe, we’re of course delighted that Sebastian traveled across an ocean, and then a continent, all the way from Australia, to join us two-plus years ago. I can tell you that he gets a ton of fan mail—and readers, not just prize judges, adore his work. A few years ago, before joining us, Sebastian wrote an essay about what constituted good criticism. “Good criticism,” he wrote in expressing an ideal, “should be risky, challenging, candid, and vulnerable. It should be urbane one moment, gauchely heartfelt the next. It should kick against can't where it sees it, and cherish and applaud not only art, but the impulse to make art. For that impulse, which comes out of life as it is lived, is the real mystery and the source of everything that makes it wonderful.” Sebastian lives up to that ideal. And it’s exactly why his work has such popular appeal.\n\n[applause]\n\nHi Charlie. I just said really nice things about you. I hope you heard them all. [laughter] I’ll show you my text afterwards. [laughter]\n\nFinally, Walter Robinson. The investigation that Robby led into a decades-long cover-up of sexual abuse by priests within the Catholic Church has emerged as one of the biggest stories of our time. Robby is deeply respected for his skill and his integrity and for his iron determination to hold powerful institutions and individuals accountable.\n\nThis certainly gets noticed in the circles of the mighty. But most gratifying is what we hear from entirely different corners of society. Now on my desk I keep a two-page letter. This is a letter that Robby received on the fifth anniversary of the first Spotlight team story on the Church. It was written by an abused victim, someone who went on to become an advocate for victims. And it begins:\n\n“Dear Walter. For several years, I've thought about writing this letter. Virtually every time I think about it, I tear up. Today I've resolved to finish it regardless.” And it continues. “Here is a long-overdue, painfully inadequate, but deeply heartfelt thank you, Walter, to you, your Spotlight team colleagues, and the rest of the deserving Globe staff, for easing my personal pain, along with the still-unimaginable pain of so many of my peers. I believe that our horrific collective childhood trauma and adult suffering has not been in vain. Your work has made this belief a reality.”\n\nAt the Globe we take pride in our Pulitzer Prizes, of course. But we also know this: The best of journalism brings rewards greater than any prize. Thank you all for coming.\n\n[applause]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: So here we go. And this is a real challenge not to let this degenerate into a situation where you got a bunch of young and old journalists telling war stories like we were in a saloon late at night. And it will be a challenge, and I will need your help to pull it off. You know, in case you hadn’t noticed, every once in a while we in the newspaper rackets grew up and made colossal, horrid mistakes. But also, every so often, we get it right. And all too often, the study of this racket focuses on the pathology, the mistakes.\n\nWe’re going to try to talk a little bit about how things go right--and occasionally very, very right, using as our framework some awards that were first formed in the will of one of the great 19th century press barons, Joseph Pulitzer, who, like most of his colleagues, was both a great visionary and a true scoundrel. [laughter] His legacy included the New York World, now gone, and the St. Louis Post Dispatch still very much with us.\n\nBut it also included a bequest to honor the best in journalism, in perpetuity. And Pulitzer had this sense—When he died, his will made provision, believe it or not, for just four journalism awards. But it contained language to permit the board – at Columbia, it turns out – to expand or contract the list as time passed, depending on what they saw in the business that needed recognition or didn’t need so much anymore.\n\nAnd, sure enough, as happens in almost any system, it didn’t contract, it grew. In fact, you could almost say, like a cancer, it metastasized. Today, there are 21 journalism Pulitzer Prizes. And for those who sometimes criticize the Pulitzer system for diluting excellence instead of saluting it, you could almost say that everything is honored today except spelling. [laughter] But this is a little different, because we’re not talking about dilution here.\n\nAnd down the road and across Morrissey Boulevard, Pulitzer Prizes have been a kind of punctuation mark for the evolution of the Boston Globe into excellence and status in the country and in the world. It all started in 1965, the year the late Tom Winship took control of the editorial side of the paper. When Senator Edward Kennedy made one of his many mistakes in public life, putting forward the name of a hack friend of his father’s, Francis X. Morrissey, for a federal judgeship here.\n\nAnd it was one of those stories that started slow. “What is this guy doing, getting nominated for a judgeship? What are his qualifications?” Before anyone knew it, Tom had assembled a team of people to examine Morrissey’s background. And, despite considerable political pressure, kept going until the name was withdrawn. And the following year, the Pulitzer Committee awarded the Globe the first Pulitzer Prize of Tom’s era. There would be, I think, 14 before he retired.\n\nSadly, he died in 2002.\n\nBut since then, out of the prizes, have almost defined the Globe’s emergence, pretty damned well, actually. And, with your forbearance, I’m going to talk to each of my distinguished colleagues a little bit about their work, try to encourage them to talk some among themselves, and then, in about 40 minutes, there are two microphones—one there and one there—and I will encourage you to line up at them, to ask your own questions of us. Keeping in mind just one thing: We’re all writers, not editors. One person here represents the Globe. The rest of us used to. But none of us speaks for it. But we do encourage your questions and hope—\n\nSo with that, I thought I’d do seniority, if that’s okay, and turn to my good buddy Ellen Goodman. I remember vividly, Ellen, in 1980, when the announcement was made about your work in 1979 because what you were trying to do hadn’t been really done before, not in column writing in general, and certainly not on the op-ed pages of a major newspaper. And I wish you could tell us a little bit about how the idea for this column took shape in your head, and what it was like to try to get it established in a place like the Globe in the mid-1970s.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Well I suppose the idea for the column took root in the times, as well as in the Globe, by me—“times” small “t.” And in the Times, there was—I had begun covering the women’s movement. And one of the slogans of the women’s movement was, “The personal is political.” Now this was before Anthony Weiner took it to a new extreme. [laughter] But, at that time, the notion, “The personal is political” meant that changing diapers could be a statement about political life, how breast cancer was treated in the medical bill, how all of these allegedly—childcare was both personal and political.\n\nAnd the idea that the personal was political infused my thinking about how to write. I was determined that I would write across the fences that divided both journalism, men and women, and the way we thought about our culture. So that, up until those times, for the most time, you had Erma Bombeck writing humor, and you had David Brodie, even then, writing in politics. But you had a strict division between the personal and the political.\n\nAnd this was not a reflection of how we lived. And it was not a reflection of the way my own thinking was evolving in tune with the time. So I determined to write about the personal and the political, about politics in the traditional sense, but also private life and the way these two intersected. And so, when I first began writing for the Globe, I was writing on the Living page, which was frankly more open to this idea than the op-ed page.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: We’ll get to that in a second, because the openness of that page has a great deal to do with the foundation that this kid built on, right?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Sure. Absolutely, yeah. And then, as time went on, and I think at a certain time in history, a Pulitzer never would have been awarded to someone who wrote about childcare, or someone who wrote about our personal relationships, or how men and women interacted, or social change. And, as time went on, both with the Pulitzer imprimatur, but also with beginning to syndicate, and then finding the column on the op-ed page, that changed.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Just to put this in a historical context, when we started at the Globe, was the department still called Women?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Yes. When I started at the Globe, and I was hired for the Women’s section, which we used to call “Back There,” even though I had previously worked—I had previously worked in the newsroom at the Detroit Free Press. But I was hired for the Globe “Back There,” and, by the way, took the job immediately because I was pregnant. So, whatever job they were offering, I was taking.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Right.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: They didn’t know I was pregnant, which always made me nervous about the Globe’s doctor. But—[laughter]—So—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: You weren’t the only one. [laughter] ELLEN GOODMAN: No, story for another day. Right. So— TOM OLIPHANT: But it was the Women’s page.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: It was the Women’s page.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And did the column start—I don’t know who held the contest to name this section 40 years ago. But Living became the—And that’s where the column started, right?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Yeah, it did.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And moving it to the op-ed page was your idea? Tom’s idea?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Well actually, it started appearing on the op-ed page of the Washington Post.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: That’s what did it. Meg Greenfield—\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: --And prior to Meg.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And Phil Jaelan(?).\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Phil Jaelan actually put it there, so that the Globe, it was kind of a, “Hmm, what’s wrong with this picture?” [laughter] And we moved it to the op-ed page in the Globe.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: A final—You know, one of the purposes—and I’m going to talk to Sebastian about this in a few minutes, because his work is so unusual—One of the purposes of a Pulitzer Prize, when it really works, is that it encourages a good trend right at the moment it’s first forming. And I was wondering if, looking back, Ellen, the acknowledgement of your work spurred more of this in America? What’s your assessment of the impact of all of this on people’s effort to introduce the personal to pages that used to be political?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Yeah, it’s very hard to—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: —still—\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: —take out what the Pulitzer meant versus what just being syndicated meant versus what was happening in the culture at the time. I think it’s almost impossible to pull one of those strings out.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Indeed. Now it’s almost a cliché in newspapering, but almost every great story has a great story behind it. And the pal of mine over here hasn’t always had the opportunity to tell the back story to what happened with the Catholic Church. Do you begin with a court case that had some sealed documents? It didn’t just happen. The evolution of a story like this, in some ways, is as fascinating as the story itself. Tell us a little bit about how this started, Robby.\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: I’ll try to remember. [laughter]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: We all take Ginkgo now every five minutes. [laughter]\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: First of all, thank you all for abandoning your beach chairs early this afternoon to be here on this lovely, lovely summer evening. [laughter] I’d have to start by saying that good journalism is never possible without good editors and gutsy publishers. And I have had, in a very long career at the Globe, a great good fortune to work for great editors and great publishers.\n\nAnd this particular endeavor, which started in 2001, started because of Marty Barron. And Marty won't tell you that. But not a story would have been written nor conceived had he not, on his very first day as Globe editor, wandered in and—pardon me for saying “wandered in”—[laughter] But strode purposely into a news meeting. [laughter] (Got myself out of trouble on that one!) And, referring to a column Eileen McNamara had just written about a certain one priest, John Geoghan, Marty said, “Why are the documents in that court case sealed? We have to get at them.”\n\nAnd that fresh set of eyes inside of a head with a fertile mind is what started this. By the end of that day, if my memory serves me—or certainly within a day, the Globe’s lawyer was looking into how the Globe could go into court and ask for those records of one priest. And that day, I was in Marty’s office in the afternoon, as the editor of the Spotlight team, and we were accustomed to going after crooked politicians and no-show public employees and all that. And I’m in his office, and he said, “I’d like the Spotlight Team to look into the case of Father Geoghan and find out everything you can.”\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Was this a criminal case?\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: No, it was a civil case with over 80 plaintiffs. And the public knew almost nothing about what the Church knew, because all the documents were secret. So the court case where we, in effect, took on the Archdiocese in a courtroom, began. But the investigation began at the same moment. And I have to tell you, I was—was a little frightened to death, because I had a new editor who would have control over at least my Christmas bonus. [laughter] And I said, “I don’t know anything.” I mean, I went to—I went to high school next door at BC High. I had a Catholic upbringing. But I knew nothing about the Catholic Church. And the idea of investigating it was something that I took a while to get my hands around.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Considering too, Robby, the fact that the Church had had—that they were always right in the building when there was any kind of an issue.\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: That is—That is true. I mean, to say that within Boston the Church was treated with great deference by everybody, and, as we found out, by police and prosecutors as well when some of these issues surfaced quietly in prior years. But, after some time of trying to find out—and I want to say about a week—about Father Geoghan, we hadn’t made much progress. But we had found out something else. And I remember going back to Marty and saying, “We’re still working on Geoghan. But, what we have found out is that Geoghan is the tip of the iceberg, that there are apparently some large number of other priests who have done the same thing. And the church has covered up this activity for decades.”\n\nAnd, at the time, I thought—and we thought, in the Spotlight team, perhaps there were a dozen or 15 priests involved. And that was the end of July. By January, when we started to publish initially about Father Geoghan, we already knew that there were likely 100 or more priests, just in the Boston Catholic Archdiocese, who had abused children. And, in almost every case—and this was the story—the Bishops and the Cardinals who were responsible for the welfare and the safety of all of these children had actively concealed the crimes and, in many cases, facilitated them. And that’s how the story started.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Tell me one other thing, because at least Ellen and I know something about the past relationships with the Church around here. Did you have any personal experiences with the kind of pressure the Archdiocese was deservedly famous for bringing to bear in that building down the road?\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: No. Never. I had—I don’t think I had ever written much, if anything, about the Church. I mean, I covered politics for years, and we all know the Church never got involved in—[laughter]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Never—No—At least not around here. [laughter]\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: You know, one of the wonderful things about the Globe is that, for reporters, if there is ever any pressure brought to bear on the publisher or even on the editor, nothing would have been said to me. Period.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: It was a tradition. It’s true now, I gather. It was certainly true in my day. It’s a very important thing—a well-run newspaper, a newspaper with character shields its people from this, even while it’s going on. It is going on. It’s just that a good publisher and a good editor doesn’t let him—I want to ask you one other thing, Robby. By the way, the award that the Globe got for this incredible bit of work is the award for public service. And it’s one of three that go all the way back to Pulitzer’s original will.\n\nAnd it is the only award that goes to a newspaper or an institution as opposed to an individual. The only others that have survived from the beginning of all this are cartooning, interestingly enough, and editorial writing. Everything else has come in recent years. The award, for example, that Ellen got, I think dates from 1970. Too late for, say, Walter Lippmann or Joe Alsop or people like that, who wrote then. The first Pulitzer Prize went, if my memory serves, went to Mark Lischilds(?) of the St. Louis Post Dispatch, very political, very Washington. And, in ten years, everything had changed.\n\nIn Charlie’s case, again, this all dates from the ‘60s and the ‘50s, recognized—dividing reporting up among international, national, and local. And same thing with you. It’s very recent. But in Robby’s case, if you read the newspaper stories, Robby, about Pulitzer Prizes, usually the lead each year is the institution that has won the public service award, more often than not.\n\nSometimes it’s a big institution like us. Often, it’s a tiny one that has shown enormous courage in the face of pressure.\n\nBut, so the recognition that came to you and to the Globe, more importantly, was based on the willingness to stand up to institutional wrongdoing. And what’s it like a decade later? You look. You see this thing. It’s in the Vatican now. There’s a case developing in Philadelphia that smells every bit as putrid as Boston did. It’s all over Europe. There's been just a heartbreaking series of stories in Ireland. Do you ever have that journalist feel, like, “What’s the point to what I do? It just never stops.”\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: Well, you know, I think in this case—Well, when you talk about the recognition the Globe—We had a team of reporters, I think everybody knows, which started with four and grew to eight when the story literally exploded in early 2002. And I think that first year alone we published 800 or more articles on this issue. I’d have to say it is, at times, discouraging to read about the fact that this story continues.\n\nBut it’s also heartening, because the world literally now pays attention to this issue. People in countries where one would not have expected this—Latin America, I’m thinking—are now raising questions about what their bishops and their priests have done. And I hope—I mean, I think this is certainly true in the United States—I hope that in all of these countries where this story is getting out in one way or another—that children are, in the end, safer. And to me, that’s the heartening—even when we read, as we have recently, that somehow the Archdiocese in Philadelphia didn’t get the message and still had 37 priests in active ministry who had credible accusations.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Right. The suspicion being, of course, that Philadelphia is anything but unique.\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: That’s correct.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Indeed. Now, if this was institutional, Charlie, in your case it’s personal. [laughter] It’s you. But that’s not entirely so. I don’t know how many documents Robby had to look at in ’01, ’02 and ’03.\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: We have a store room at The Globe that is literally—[cough] of documents.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: But I mean, I remember when Winship got me to steal the third batch of Pentagon papers, and it was only like this. And sitting in rooms—I mean, of all the things journalists do, reading this stuff is probably the least enjoyable and the most important thing we do. But tell how this started, Charlie. I love back stories. You didn’t wake up one morning and have thoughts about signing statements?\n\n[laughter]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: I suspect.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: No. I had heard of them, although there was this little foreshadowing—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: We all had—\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: -- not about Bush, but about the Reagan years, just before this happened, when Sam Alito is being confirmed to the Supreme Court. And his memos were being opened up, and we were all sorting through them at the National Archives down in Washington. And there was a memo about how the Reagan legal team was thinking that this tool – signing statements – was an underutilized tool of executive power. And it could be used to help the president get the last word on how to interpret ambiguous statutes. It could be used to force congress to do what the president wanted when legislation was in the mix, by using the signing statement as a threat. And it could be used to control this thing—this term that started popping up in the mid ‘80s for the first time, the “Unitary Executive.”\n\nAnd so, we had come across that memo, those of us hunting through Sam Alito. And it was like, “What? Signing statements? What is that, anyway?” But separately, I had been—you know, at the time for the Globe and still now—even for the Times, I was specializing in particular on 9/11 legal policy issues—Guantanamo, torture, these sorts of things, where I spent most of my time thinking about.\n\nAnd so, I had spent 2005 following the debate in Congress, among other things, between Senator John McCain and the Bush administration, essentially, as an inter-nascent republican debate about torture. It had come out, when Alberto Gonzales was up to become the Attorney General, that the Bush administration had secretly decided that the treaty against torture did not apply overseas. There's sort of a twisted legal interpretation.\n\nThis outraged McCain who, of course, had been tortured in Vietnam. And he spent that year trying to push through Congress legislation that would close this loophole by making clear that torture is outlawed no matter where in the world the US government is operating, not just on US soil. And the Bush administration hated that law, in particular—or that proposition. Dick Cheney was going to Congress to personally lobby behind closed doors not to pass that law. Or, if they did pass it, to make an exception for CIA interrogations.\n\nBut, in the end, McCain got a vote on the floor of the Senate, and it passed overwhelmingly. I think only nine Senators voted against it so overwhelmingly that it would have—if Bush had tried to veto it, as he threatened to do, it would have been overridden. And so, Bush called McCain into his office and called the cameras in as well, and had this big sort of handshake, and “you won and I lost. And maybe this okay.” And that was the story.\n\nAnd so, we all wrote that story up and went home, thinking that the story that I had been following for a year was over. Except that it turned out not to be over, because a few days later, the bill finally gets signed by Bush. This was on December 30th, I think. It was the Friday before New Year’s Eve. So Washington is shut down. Everyone is out of town. And around eight p.m. that night, the White House sends out an email with its press releases, as it always does. And it just mentions that there's also a signing statement on this bill.\n\nAnd so, I came to work after New Year’s Eve weekend and was looking at this thing, and looking at what some law professors were saying about it. And called up the White House to ask them what it meant, because it was spoken in very dense language. It talked about the Unitary Executive Theory again, and Commander in Chief power, and construing the statute consistent with.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Can you just take a detour and define this theory that has actually been around for more than 20 years, but has been advocated with more strength, particularly on the right in recent years?\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Well, so the Unitary Executive Theory began in the Reagan administration as the idea that the president controls the entire Executive Branch. You don’t have a subordinate official who gets to make his own decisions. If the EPA director thinks that the mercury level should be “x” but the president thinks it should be “y,” the president wins. And that’s okay, because the president is the one who controls the Executive Branch.\n\nThis, in the Bush administration, changed and evolved. It was fused with the notion that the president controls, as Commander in Chief, inherent unwritten powers to protect national security as he sees fit. And the idea became the president has to do whatever is necessary to protect national security. And that means that his derivative officials also are under his umbrella as the Unitary Executive. And so, Congress cannot bind the hands of the president or anyone else in the Executive Branch if the president is telling them what to do.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And that even if it does, technically, the Executives—\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: —well that’s just words on the page. It’s not really a law. And so, this theory was being invoked in this signing statement, which was an instruction to the military and the CIA that, notwithstanding this new statute, the president, as Commander in Chief, controlled interrogations.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And what was left of the purpose of the statute when the signing statement was read by you that weekend?\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Well, so, I mean, essentially—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Did it shred the law?\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: It reserved the right to shred the law, you’re right. And so, it was not clear whether this was going to be acted upon or not, or what it all meant. But what it definitely meant was the president consider himself still free to order any kind of interrogation he wanted. And so, I wrote that story, and that got a very big response. And that was interesting. But then I sort of went on with my life. I was writing all kinds of different stories.\n\nAnd, about three months later, there was a similar incident in which a multi-year debate over reauthorizing the Patriot Act had reached a climax, a Senate filibuster against the law had been broken with an agreement that there would be new oversight protections added to the law, more reporting to Congress about how these powers were being used, and under what circumstances, to make sure they weren’t being abused. And, once again, Bush signed it in a very elaborate signing ceremony. And the story that came out of that in most of the media was, you know,\n\nPatriot Act is over. Bush has agreed to this deal. It’s over. Except, once again, late night—a signing statement saying, “I don’t have to obey any of the stuff I agreed to, to get this passed.” [simultaneous conversation]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Were these signing statements included in the material that was given to the press and the public at the time? Or did they slip in?\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: No. The typical—[simultaneous conversation] was you would have the ceremony in the morning. The reporters would be there. The press conferences. The statements. Everyone would write their story. They would go home to their kids. And eight or nine p.m., if they happened to check their email, there would be this press release that would sort of say, in very obtuse, obscure terminology, something that had to be deciphered to be understood, which was, “This law does not mean what you think it means.”\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: How did you come to realize that this was not an extraordinary act by the administration or the White House, but that it was common?\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Well, so in the same way that Marty had a central role in the beginning of the Church scandal, Peter Canellos, who was my editor as the Washington Bureau chief at the time, now the editorial page editor at the Globe, said, after the Patriot Act story, “Both of these stories have been remarkable and different and got a big response. Why don’t you not do your ordinary, you know, incremental stuff about whatever is happening on Guantanamo for a while. Just don’t write any stories. Go off and read and decipher every signing statement Bush has\n\nissued, dating back to his first day in office. And get a sense of the aggregate mass and the specifics of what statutes he was saying were not binding on the presidency.”\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: At that point, how many were there?\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: At that point he had issued about 150 signing statement. But, because each signing statement challenged multiple different things in these sort of omnibus bills, he had challenged more than 750 statutes. By the end of his presidency, he had challenged 1,100 or so statutes, which was more than double all previous presidents in history combined. And so, this wasn’t a new thing, but it had ratcheted up to an enormous intense level. And the reason was because Bush was using these legal theories like I discussed earlier, which were very novel and aggressive. And, if these theories were true, all kinds of stuff that had traditionally been understood to be normal law-making was, in fact, invalid.\n\nAnd so, it took me about a month to process that and produce what became the sort of centerpiece, let’s just march through all these laws.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Now did you get a sense of who the invisible hand was guiding both the philosophy and the application of it? [laughter] Somehow, many of us would doubt that the president himself was deeply involved in this heavily intellectual exercise. [laughter]\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Yes. [laughter] In fact, my subsequent reporting showed that a lot of this—the driving force behind this was Dick Cheney’s chief council, David Addington, eventually his chief of staff after Scooter Libby was expelled. And that Addington had developed these particularly aggressive views about the scope and limits or lack of limits on executive power, dating back to sort of the Iran Contra scandal, and had been with Cheney through that period. And there was sort of—you could see elements of it showing up when Cheney was Secretary of Defense and Addington was at his side.\n\nI think Cheney didn’t really share these philosophical approaches to executive power. I think Cheney had a very instrumentalist approach. He thought the president needed to be vigorous and assertive, especially in foreign policy and national security issues. And so, legal theories that made that possible were attractive to him, but he wasn’t a constitutional theorist. Addington had thought deeply about these things and had developed these theories. And it was Addington who—they fed up a system, in fact, where legislation that was going to be routed to the president’s desk to be signed normally would go through the White House Council’s office. It also was going through the office of the vice president for flagging this, this, this and this and this and this and this.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And Charlie, you’ve at least touched on the extreme importance of having an editor or a bureau chief or somebody in authority who can either give you the time or the resources to give something that you’ve spotted. And then it breaks. And forgetting prizes for a second, what’s your assessment a few years later about impact? Is Obama more on guard about this sort of thing? Or is the same fundamental assertion of presidential power still lurking there, regardless of how diligent people in the press are about following it now?\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Well, I mean, it’s an interesting question that I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the last two years and writing about.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: That’s why I asked it.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Yes. [laughter] And it depends on sort of how you define what the problem was. Was the problem signing statements per se? That was the American Bar\n\nAssociation’s conclusion. The president shouldn’t be able to do this. You either sign it and you obey it or you veto it. That’s it. You don’t sign it and then say that this part and this part are invalid.\n\nOther people took the view that that is too formalist and too rigid. And government doesn’t really work that way. It’s okay to have signing statements. But the problem with Bush was that he was using them as a vehicle to advance these radical theories that were false. But, if you used them with modest theories, that everyone agreed were basically mainstream views of how the Constitution works, it would be all right.\n\nObama’s camp, including Obama and the lawyers he surrounded himself, took the latter view, which was also the Clinton administration’s view. And so, Obama criticized Bush for signing statements and sometimes, on the stump as a candidate. But his audience believed that he would never use them at all. And he’s, to his grief now, because he gets beat up every time he issues a signing statement, even if it’s totally innocuous—and sometimes they're not so innocuous. We haven’t seen anything like the Unitary Executive Theory Commander in Chief override power, which is the core of what was controversial about Bush.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: So in other words, it goes on. And the most important lasting impact of what you’ve done is that we’re now five million times more aware that it’s going on. And so, there is a kind of check on the activity that didn’t exist before because those late in the evening statements tended not to get reported at all.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: I think so. I think the device and the theories and the institution of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel which writes these sort of secret memorandums about what’s legal or not—and this is where the famous torture memos came out of—are forever changed by the last administration and the coverage of it. This administration is under the microscope in a way that the Clinton administration was not because of what came before. And I don’t see that changing.\n\nAnd now, as Obama deals with a congress which is increasingly hostile to him—he lost the House. It’s very likely he’ll lose the Senate, even if he gets reelected in the next cycle. I think that the temptation towards unilateral assertions of power is going to be ever greater for him. And we may be seeing that right now in Libya. We probably saw that a few months ago with his decision not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act any longer. And it may just be the beginning of a plunge into something that, for the first two years, because of the Bush experience, he was very reluctant to go.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: But a topic in the news that essentially didn’t exist exists today because of the work that you did.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Well, that’s way overstated. [laughter] I mean, a lot of people—the torture memos, the terrorist—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: I don’t think so—\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: You know, the warrantless wiretapping program, the secret CIA prisons, there was an entire constellation of national security policies put in place after 9/11 that turned out, when they surfaced, to rely on very aggressive theories about what a president could do.\n\nAnd all of this came together in sort of a wave.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: The bit in the oath of office about taking care that the laws be faithfully executed now has a little asterisk in it that we’re all aware of.\n\nDo you wish you were involved in this grubby—[laughter]—world? Or are you happy out there on cloud nine?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: It’s such a (inaudible) to listen to these stories. I don’t know about you guys, but it is amazing. And, you know, I think that the thing that comes out is just the sheer presence of mind that you guys have to have when these things are in the making, you know. They're incredibly complex.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: What I wanted to ask you is, while Ellen was talking a bit ago about this little germ that started to take root in her mind about a different way of thinking about things, didn’t sound a little familiar to you. Because, I mean, I’m an outsider who just reads you. I never read a syllable about art in my life in newspapers. I mean, I’d read an occasional book in college to impress a girl or something. But—[simultaneous conversation] But I didn’t know bupkis.\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, I notice that somebody is writing about it in a really different way. And the first word that comes to mind when I think about what you do, Sebastian, is accessibility, all right. Where does this come from? Is it in the air in Australia? [laughter]\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Well, it’s funny you mention Australia. I mean, I grew up there. And, you know, you can’t grow up there and be interested in art without being aware of some pretty towering writers on art. And I think probably the first person that comes to mind is someone you’ll all be familiar with, who’s Robert Hughes, I mean. And so, I don’t see it—You know, if my work is accessible, that’s great. I want it to be. I don’t see it as being that unusual in that sense.\n\nYou know, there's a great tradition of art writers who are incredibly accessible. And yeah, Robert Hughes had a huge influence on me and on many other writers, not just writers about art in Australia. And I think it’s that sort of—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Talk a little bit more about what the influence is, so people can understand better about what you're trying to do when you write. I mean, by the way, I don’t know when this happened in newspapers. But, technically speaking, you are the—what is it—visual arts critic?\n\nWhere did that term come from? [laughter]\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Well, I don’t know. [simultaneous conversation]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: It sounds almost technological.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: It does, yeah. Well, I’ll tell you what. I think a lot of people get confused between arts—you know the arts, which is theatre and music and film and everything else—and art. So, if you say, “I’m an art critic,” my experience anyway is a lot of people will just say, “All right. So, do you review theatre shows and so on?” And I say, “No, no, it’s just visual art.” So, maybe that’s why.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Right. Because one of your honored colleagues, the great Mark Feeney, in a sense when he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for criticism, the reference was to work that cut all the way across, including performing as well as visual.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Yeah, Mark’s terrific. He’s amazing, and writes so well, not only about photography, but film and books as well. I mean, he can write about almost anything, with enormous aplomb.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: But tell us some more about how you formed the ideas in your mind about how to discuss art. And then, tell a little bit about how you brought it to the bosses so you could get it published regularly.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Well, you know, I started out not necessarily intending to write about art. I think the first piece I had published in a magazine in Australia was on film, on Quentin Tarantino. You know, I think Pulp Fiction had just come out. And I was excited and wrote some pretentious piece about violence and style or something. [laughter] Which had no doubt been written in similar ways by lots of other people.\n\nBut I did study art history. I loved it, almost in spite of the institution where I learned it, Sydney University, which had a very sort of theory-based and philosophy-based kind of introduction to art. And I used to just hang out in the library and opened these wonderful art books. And I loved the idea that you could sort of study by looking at pictures instead of reading, you know, dense tracts. [laughter]\n\nSo, you know, there were these writers around. Not just Robert Hughes, but, you know, a colleague of mine called John McDonald, who was the chief critic at the Sydney Morning Herald at the time. And he kind of got me a job at the Herald. You know, I think I loved—What\n\nI love about art criticism is that there is a great tradition of critics who are not only engaged in visual art but in the wider culture. You know, you go back to Diderot and Baudelaire, and then forward to the many great US sort of poet critics, like John Ashbury and even Peter\n\nSchjeldahl today who writes in the New Yorker is a poet as well.\n\nAnd then, you know, people who have their eye on the culture at large, like John Berger, like Kenneth Clark, you know, these are people who are sort of known for—And Simon Schama, you know, they're known for specializing in art but for also having this much broader sort of range.\n\nAnd I definitely don’t have that. But, what I love—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Want to bet?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: No, I don’t—I don’t. But I do love the fact that if you are an art critic, you find yourself one day writing about, you know, ancient Assyrian reliefs, and then the next day about, you know, video art that was made last week. And it’s dizzying. It’s kind of challenging at times. But it’s wonderful to sort of have the sense of the larger culture.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Let me mention one thing in particular that Sebastian does that is another reason that me, as a hack guy from Washington, can't help but read. Is you go to the exhibition places and write about things in permanent collections. And, you know, not the exhibit that’s opening next month here, or review of another one in New York, or a gallery opening, or an auction or something like that. But some painting that’s been sitting somewhere, probably a great one, for a long time. And you have a chance to see it again. Where did you get that idea?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Well, you know, one of the reasons I wanted to move to this part of the world is that it is so rich in great museum collections. It has, you know, museums that put on great shows all the time. But it also has these incredible collections. Obviously—I don’t think many people here realize it. And one of the things they don’t realize is that, out of the six biggest museums in terms of size and scope of collection in the US, two of them are in this city, Harvard and the MFA.\n\nAnd then you have this amazing array of great college museums with extraordinary collections, collections that would—you know, even though—I don’t want to sort of talk down Australia, it’s got some wonderful museums. But there are college collections here that would embarrass almost every public collection in Australia. And so, for me to come to this part of the world and get to know these collections was hugely attractive.\n\nThe other thing is, you know, there is an issue as well which is that, in recent years, especially with the economic crisis, but also post-9/11, the cost of insuring works of art, sending them all around the world for traveling exhibitions, has risen enormously, by a huge factor. And so, it is very difficult, increasingly difficult for shows—for museums to bring in the kind of massive retrospectives of, you know, great impressionist painters, or whoever—sorts of what used to be called blockbuster exhibitions that got so many people talking in the press.\n\nSo, one of the responses to this has been for museums to emphasize their permanent collections. And I kind of think that that’s a really great thing, in many ways.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: But I mean, like, did some museum guy come to you and say, “How come you don’t”—I mean, we’ve had this damn Rembrandt sitting here for 100 years. And nobody’s written—[laughter]—\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: I was not approached by a museum.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: I mean, it seems like such an obvious idea, but nobody does it.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Right. Well, you know, it’s just amazing thing. These incredible works of art that have been accumulated over centuries—a century and often more—they're just sitting around.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: So you tried it one day?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: We take them for granted.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: So you tried it one day.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Tried—[simultaneous conversation]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Yeah. What was the first one you took batting practice on?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: There was a work at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, a wonderful museum out in the Berkshires. But, you know, I had actually suggested it to my editors a while before they agreed to it.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Really? What was the reluctance?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: I don’t know. I don’t know. [laughter] Maybe they were just busy, and understandably. And that’s totally fine.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: We could all relate to that, right?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Yeah. But, you know, perhaps the idea of sort of making it a really regular thing—I think editors, understandably, are reluctant to commit themselves to those sorts of things. You need to see how it’s going to work out.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Yeah. Now you’ve heard some stories of remarkable commitment.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Yeah.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: There are also stories of remarkable non-commitment. And there is nothing more familiar to everybody on this stage than the poor slob trying to convince an editor\n\nto please let him or her do something that’s a little off the beaten track. Persistence or your example of how to do it really worked? How did you get it established?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Look. It was just a question of coming back on a better day. [laughter] About 12 months later.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: We know that.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Yeah. Well I have to say, you know, I’ve had enormous support from my editors, both my direct editor Scott Heller and now Rebecca Striker. And from Marty and from the whole hierarchy at the Globe. I really haven’t—You know, that’s one of the things that I have to say I’ve worked for a whole bunch of newspapers. I’ve worked for the Sydney Morning Herald. I lived for four years in London. I wrote for every one of the broadsheets there—the Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, The F.T., The Times. You know, I’m not saying I wrote a lot for all these places. The Telegraph –[laughter] But I contributed on a freelance basis to all of those publications. And then I went back to Australia to The Australian where I was the art critic. The standards at the Globe and the editorial support that I get have beat all of those places.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Have you had a chance—I mean it’s only been a little while. And this is certainly as big a splash as I have seen in a while for someone who just got here. But do you realize the shoulders that you stand on in that little department of yours?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Of course.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: I think Ellen’s column first being there. But just in the last—\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: It’s more interesting, too, to think about how many newspapers now have a full-time arts critic.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Right.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Maybe 30?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: It’s getting less, absolutely. Yeah, fewer.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Maximum?\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: It’s just like the public schools. The music and the art has suffered greatly.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Yeah. And so, one of the things that, you know, I’m just so grateful for is that, you know, a newspaper like The Globe has space for all these incredibly important things, you know. And it makes what I do often feel really paltry listening to these stories, is just amazing. But I love that there is a space for what I do, and for what my colleagues do, you know. I mean, I joined the most amazing team. Mark Feeney had just won a Pulitzer just as I arrived from Australia. And you’ve got Matthew Gilbert. You’ve got Sarah Rodman. You’ve got the film critics Wesley and Ty. I mean, it’s amazing.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Ellen and I are of a certain age. And, you know, we met—[laughter] I drink Geritol. [laughter]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Anybody who wants to go to a microphone to ask questions just please start.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: The year that—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: ...(inaudible) is 2001, right?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Yeah. And there was a TV critic—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Bill Henry.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Bill Henry.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Rest his soul.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: The late Bill Henry won the year that I won.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Winship four on that day.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: But a television critic to win a Pulitzer was extremely unusual, at that point.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And it led to it happening three times. But it started at the Globe.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: But one of the interesting questions about art criticism is not just how few art critics there are in the country, which is true. But the audience, and that you do not have an automatic audience. It’s not like the sports page. Even though everybody is here and not watching the Bruins—[laughter] you know. Or are the Bruins tomorrow night?\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Tomorrow night. [laughter]\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: [simultaneous conversation] I apologize. They would have been. But, you know, you have to build an audience as well as respond to one. It’s not automatically there.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: That’s true, up to a point, yeah. But I do think people underestimate how great the thirst for engagement with art out there is. I mean, you look at the numbers of people who go to the MFA and to the Gardner and the ICA.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Or who try to paint themselves.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: And who try to paint themselves. I mean, you know, it’s actually pretty incredible. [simultaneous conversation]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Have you had a sense in—what’s it been, a month and a half? The confetti is still on you a little bit. [laughter] Have you had a sense that the foundation under which you work has had some concrete poured into it because of this? Can you feel the opportunity that this confers?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Look. You know, I can honestly say I have. I mean, I got an email from Amy Macdonald inviting me here tonight. And I wasn’t sure what on earth to talk about because I was told it would be about life post-Pulitzer. And I said, “My life is uncannily like my life before.” [laughter] But obviously, it’s been enormously boosting and cheering. And, you know, nothing big has happened.\n\nI got a letter from the Prime Minister of Australia, which I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: That’s pretty good. [simultaneous conversation]\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: --disappointment that I haven’t got one from the president yet. [laughter]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: I don’t know what Ellen thinks. I think, over time, it’s not that it fades, it’s just that perspective arrives. I mean, the only thing I have left the night of the announcement of the Gold Medal for the coverage of busing, Winship had decreed there could be no celebration at the paper because the town was a wreck. It had been an emotionally wrenching year of 14 hour days just repeated over and over again. So there would be no celebration.\n\nBut we end up at the Harvard Club about midnight, drunk as rats. [laughter] And he gave me a Lily Pulitzer bow tie. [laughter] And it’s all I got. [laughter]\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: I think that there is one thing that all of us got from winning the Pulitzer. And that is that we know the first line of our Obit. [laughter]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Let me ask you something. As a Geritol drinker, sometimes I find a phrase used so much I'm not sure it has the—I mean, I wish—I don’t know, maybe somebody will say I wrote about the Brooklyn Dodgers once or something. Does the phrase still make you tingle a little bit?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: I would agree with Sebastian that I think, if you win a Pulitzer, perhaps for writing a play, and that play contains the fine print with it all the way through, and it’s done, and so yeah. But, if you're writing for a newspaper, it’s like, “Oh my God. Do I have to get up tomorrow morning and write a Pulitzer Prize winning poem? [laughter] You know. [simultaneous conversation]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Do you feel that already? Do you feel that yet? The so-called “What have you done for me lately?” [laughter]\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: I had the good fortune that I had already taken a book leave, and sort of already moving into another project.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Good timing. Very good timing. Good for you.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: That I could throw myself into. But I remember, I’ve talked to several winners. And there is a sense of just you're kind of wrecked for some time afterwards. And you have to sort of get your life back to normalcy.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Well, you’ll be all right.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: No, no—\n\n[laughter]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And last one, Robby, it’s an ongoing story. It’s an absolute horror show.\n\nIt’s kind of like us in busing. You can't—There's nothing to rejoice in. There's some feeling, you know, that maybe you did some good and all the rest. But how do you really feel? [laughter] As they say on local television.\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: Well, you know, I think for us, he reason we got into this business is because we thought that journalism matters. That good journalism matters a lot. And that investigative reporting, which is what I do, can make a difference. And I think, in the case certainly of the extraordinary Globe effort, the church, it turned out everything that we had thought of turned out to be true. That, in fact, reporting, shining a bright light into dark corners can really make a difference for people’s lives. And that’s why we do what we do.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: I still think so. [applause] Thank you very much for your patience.\n\nQ: Tom, could you give us a back story on your Pulitzer?\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Well, that again is institutional. And again, paraphrase Robby a little bit, we stand on the shoulders of great people. When Arthur Garrity made his decision that the Boston school system was guilty as hell of operating a dual school system, Tom Winship and two Taylors recognized that the most horrendous thing imaginable was just four months away. And so, Winship got us all ready, the entire institution, for what would be, in the first year, nine months of 14 hour days, seven days a week.\n\nHis philosophy in setting this thing up was that we were going to hold up a giant mirror in front of the city and force it to look at itself. And there would be ugly things, maybe a couple of good things, but mostly really ugly things to look at for a long time. And that public officials were likely to be, at best, on the sidelines, at worst, part of the problem.\n\nThe hardest thing in this story was keeping the effort going night after night, day after day. And, at the same time, Winship was a horrid slave driver. Had me working with two reporters to do a behind-the-scenes reconstruction of the first year of busing that would ultimately run 100,000 words at the same time we were running the coverage of it. So, when it was all over, we checked into a rest home—[laughter]—and I have been there ever since. Yes, ma’am.\n\nQ: I just think the whole program has been terrific. And congratulations. I actually had quite a few comments as a practicing Catholic. Thank you to Mr. Robinson. But I’d really like to get together with all of you in that saloon and discuss your war stories. [laughter] But I think because right now—I’d like to talk to you all—but I think the most vital question tonight was what Mr.\n\nSavage was saying. And I know about the signing statements, but I did not follow it in detail. And I wondered, first of all, as a non-lover of Bush—I’ll say that right now—I’m sure most of the people here feel the same way. But I just want to say, it seems like he was even worse than Nixon, whom I remember well. And, as a danger to the Constitution and the safety of the country. And I just wondered, have you thought about writing a book about the signing statements? Because it’s very suspenseful. [laughter]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Funny you should ask.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Yes. It’s currently ranked about 600,000 on Amazon. But you can buy a copy. It’s called Takeover. It’s not just about signing statements. It has a chapter about signing statements. It’s about the growth of executive power generally after Watergate, and then its acceleration under the last administration.\n\nQ: Well, I have a book discussion.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: And the publisher is Little Brown.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And you can get it on Amazon, right?\n\nQ: Thank you very much.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Yes, sir. Thank you very much for being patient.\n\nQ: Well, first of all, it’s an absolute honor to be here. I grew up reading the Globe. And Ellen, your columns were just must-read. And, when my wife moved here from Kansas, we both sort of saw the Boston Globe as so instrumental to our political and social understanding of both local and national news. Ellen, I wanted to ask you, regard to your columns, were there particular things that would stand out to you, that you sort of say, “Oh gee, this would be worth writing about.”\n\nAnd then, I think the secondary part of the question would be, what were you hoping to be able to sort of show people in regard to the writing that you were doing? Was there particular things that you wanted to sort of get across, in particular? I know that you mentioned earlier about the personal and political. But was there other underlying issues that you wanted to really expose with your daily--?\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Well I suppose, if you had to put a subject line over my column, what I was writing about, what I had written about during my life, I would call it values. And so, when stories came across—came from the news—and, generally speaking, as a columnist, you get stuff that’s in the news, it was the stories that had some values, not some question. What does it mean? How do we explain it? How do we think about this in terms of the culture that we live in and the values that we hold dear? And, can you wrest some meaning from what is happening?\n\nSo I would try to pick those. And I would try to get to the heart of it, often tipping my hat to people who agreed and tipping my hat to people who disagreed along the way. And figure out a puzzle. What is it, in this story, that we need to understand and unravel? So that would be at the heart of it, for the most part.\n\nAnd the subjects that I picked, the things that interested me personally, had to do with the culture that we live in, loosely defined, and particularly the women’s movement defined in its largest term, which is the movement of men and women from one life pattern to many. So those would be—And I wrote a lot about ethics. But again, generally speaking, it would be the search for understanding and questioning what value was stuck in the heart of this story.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Let me back up your premise with two short little stories about Ellen. First of all, I remember something—Well, I remember something our mutual mentor, Winship, said about her. That Tom always believed that the real lasting legacy of the 1960s was not political. That it was personal. That the most important thing that changed during that decade were the nature of people’s relationships to each other, particularly ones that had previously been hierarchical: kids learning how to talk back to their parents better, husbands and wives being at least in a somewhat different situation. And that Ellen’s work embodied this lasting cultural legacy.\n\nIt was put much more succinctly by a very dear friend of Ellen’s—and of mine, named Frank Mankowitz(?), who is married to a very close friend of Ellen’s, Patricia O’Brien, whom Robby remembers very well from national politics. And Frank once said—he had been Bob Kennedy’s press secretary, among other things—that the 1970s, in op-ed world, belonged primarily to the Washington scene, the Nixon wars, Vietnam, and stuff like that.\n\nThe ‘80s belonged to her, because that personal quote—\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: I don’t want to take that—[simultaneous conversation]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: He said it. He said it.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: --Ronald Reagan, please.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Far more than to Reagan. And what the Pulitzer committee was trying to encourage, and it’s still, I think, an effort, Ellen, is to get more of that. You know, I would rather have five more Ellens and five less of me for just the sake of the national dialogue, probably some more papers, too. Yes, sir.\n\nQ: Hi. My name is Drew Horn. I’m from Weymouth. And I have a question about journalism for all five of you. And the question comes from a concern of mine. And that is that it’s been my observation that the country has been unable to come to consensus about where it wants to go or what it wants to be. When I was growing up and became an adult, it was the 1950s. And there were three networks, ABC, NBC, CBS. And there were about five major national newspapers.\n\nAnd everybody got their information from those sources. And they all had pretty much the same information.\n\nAnd today, with the diffusion of information coming from every place, from the internet, from the air waves, from cable, from here and there, it seems as though we have such a diffusion and such a separation between people as a result of people not having the same information. They listen to echo chambers about what they think, instead of listening to each other.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Okay, I’m going to exercise moderator’s prerogative, and give this one to our new arrival. [laughter] And I’m going to alter your question just a little bit, so that I can get you to talk about this American cultural media informational scene that you find yourself in the middle of, and that is now turned around and put a big halo over your head. [laughter]\n\nQ: My question is, do you have any recommendations how we can fix the problem?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Well, maybe fewer Australians. [laughter] [simultaneous conversation] Yeah, I'm thinking of one in particular, by the name of Rupert Murdoch. [laughter] But I shouldn’t say that because he’s my former employer. He was the owner of The Australian, which was the newspaper in Australia that I worked for.\n\nAnyway, the echo chamber. So it’s a very good point, good question. I suppose that many people could make the counter-argument, though, which is that the diffusion of sources of media is a great thing for our democracy. So I know what you're talking about exactly, though. The echo chamber phenomenon, we can all see it. People are just speaking to those who have the same opinions as they do already. And you get this fragmenting and splintering of the body politic.\n\nYou know, I can't say anything profound about it. I do think that despite the sort of economic problems it brings to newspapers, that there is so much that is great about the diffusion of media sources. I think all of us as journalists use these proliferating sources every day. So it would be a bit rich to be hypocritical of them.\n\nBut I think one of the great things about newspapers is that they still have the ability to bring together all of these opposing and often sort of incredibly kind of self-involved voices. You know, you can go to a newspaper, a great newspaper that has some sense of values and of objectivity and so on, like the Boston Globe, and get a whole bunch of different voices. And, you know, I think that is actually going to be one of the great strengths of newspapers as they go forward.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Thank you. Sir.\n\nQ: This will be honor to have opportunity to question Mr. Walter Robinson. Just once you faced, you know, the very strong opposition—I mean the religion opposition of the Catholic Church, are you afraid of them? You know, if I’m going back to China and doing the story of ... (inaudible) you know, the partner that become the CEO or that kind of story, if I also face the very strong opposition, the religion opposition, what’s your advice for me?\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: If I understand your question, how do you do this?\n\nQ: While you're doing the story, you know, you're facing the very strong Catholic religion opposition of the Catholic Church. Are you afraid? What made you go forward with the story?\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: I think what animates all of us every day is to dig out the truth. And even if it’s a religion that you or I—and I was raised in, if the truth hurts, so be it. But the public has a right to know what the institutions that it reveres are doing. And I think we have an obligation to hold them accountable. And I think that’s our primary obligation.\n\nQ: So, doing the investigation, it’s very difficult to get the truth, or how you find the truth for the Catholic Church? I mean, the Catholic Church going on for seven(?) years, you know.\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: In our particular case, we talked to hundreds and hundreds of people. And sometimes they were very difficult conversations. But hundreds of people who had been victims of priests, just in this Archdiocese, called us and wanted to tell us their stories. And that, plus our success, obviously, in getting a judge to agree that the public had a right to the document, helped us get this story out.\n\nQ: Thank you very much. Sir.\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: Thank you.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Thanks for waiting. As brief as possible so we can squeeze in as many as possible.\n\nQ: Absolutely. So both the profession and the business of journalism have changed as a result of technological advances in the last few years pretty dramatically. How do you see that continuing to change over the next few years? And what are your hopes, as journalists, in terms of what you hope the outcome will be five to 10 years down the road, in terms of the—[simultaneous conversation]\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Okay, Savage, you're the future. [laughter]\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: People high above me in the business side of the New York Times, of course, have launched the pay metered model. And some other papers as well. I think the Globe, too, now. When I go to the Globe, it keeps telling me I have to subscribe. And I’m like, “What?” [laughter] “Don’t I get alumni rights?” And so, I’m hoping that this sort of hybrid approach, where people sort of get sucked in with 20 articles a month or something, works when everything until now has not worked. And so, fingers crossed. Other than that, you know, I’m an ink-stained wretch, not a business guy. So I don’t know. I just hope.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: But you have to live with it.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Well, sure.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Ellen, what’s your impression of all this? I’m fascinated to know how you view—\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Well I’m interested, because, of course, we represent, here, an award that is only given to print.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Yes. They now have—they have expanded the definition, now, so that online material—right Marty? Yeah. Online material may be considered—whatever.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Okay, online material. But, I will be interested if the next major investigative piece gets awarded to, say, WikiLeaks or something, you know. How do we—You know, how does the profession adjust to that when the news is coming in in hand-held video cameras from Egypt, and while America is cutting back foreign bureaus? And how much is citizen journalism just this chaotic, unedited, unvetted source of information, how do we contain and direct and prove it? It’s a little bit like going to the internet when you have a medical problem. And, if you Google, you know, “meniscus tear” to fix something in your family—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: [simultaneous conversation]\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: ---you can get total junk, or you can get something that is useful. And so, I think one of the big problems is going to be figuring out ways for both people and for journalism as an institution, to contain, edit and vet this huge in-rush of information from the source.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: It was behind the earlier question, too, and the gentlemen—you know, “Where do I go?” Sir.\n\nQ: I have a related question about investigative journalism, in particular. Investigative journalism is relatively modern as we know it now. So I’m wondering, as the media changes, and as more media is going to, the personal much more accessible news, will there still be investigative journalism and these long drawn out investigations as we know it?\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: You know, one of the reasons that the Pulitzer Prizes were aimed at this kind of work, starting in various forms about 40 years ago, was to encourage it. Robby, how many joints have teams? Let’s use that as a criterion. Five? Six?\n\nWALTER ROBINSON: Formal, separate teams of the Post, the Globe, the Wall Street Journal, the LA Times, Seattle—But many papers don’t invest the resources because it’s expensive. The Globe, in my view, the Globe’s dedication to this kind of reporting is unflinching because the editor and the publisher believe in it, and because here in Boston we recognize that this is what our readers want.\n\nAnd let me give you one example. I don’t know if there was a verdict today in the trial of Sal DiMasi. But one thing I will tell you—I don’t know if you know this—he would never have been indicted or come to the attention of federal prosecutors had it not been for reporting by the Boston Globe, which dug out—[applause] And for, just to make one personal point, having been doing this since the 1970s, every time someone says to me, “You're the liberal/Democratic Globe. That’s what you represent,” what I say is, “The Globe very often in this state is the opposition party and has held those in power accountable.”\n\nSo the importance of that kind of reporting, whether it’s done by a team like the spotlight team, which has been in place for 40 years, or the half dozen reporters who do it in the newsroom full- time, or the State House Bureau, which dug out a lot of the Sal DiMasi stuff, it’s what we do. It’s why we publish every day. It’s what’s important to readers. Because, you know, we sometimes can't trust the institutions that govern us to do things right.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: Well I knew models too, Tom, you should mention. Robby has a new model of his own, partnering with his students at Northeastern. Then there is the new model---\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Northwestern is.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: --The new model of Pro Publica, and the Center for Investigative Reporting, where newspapers are taking the work that is done by, you know, supported non- profit investigative reportings.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: There was a unit at Northwestern that specialized in capital cases.\n\nELLEN GOODMAN: That’s right, there is.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And so, there’ll probably be—right Charlie?—all kinds of new forms over the next decade. Have you had any experience so far with experimental or new different ways of probing behind headlines? But still, you're in Washington.\n\nCHARLIE SAVAGE: Yeah. I’m trying—I mean certainly, I’m an avid—You were saying, “Look, we all make use of this proliferating online media” So it would be hypocritical to criticize it unduly. I mean, I’m an avid consumer of specialized blogs, in particular law professor blogs are an enormous help to me in sort of surveying the world and trying to make sense of it. That would be one great example.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: It would. Let’s take—I hate this part of the job. And I'm going to say, if you can be brief, we’ll do two. Okay? [laughter]\n\nQ: Mr. Smee, would you, in the wake of the problems with Deborah Jowitt the Village Voice— she’s been accused of not criticizing dance, but rather illuminating it—would you comment on the term “critic” when it comes to art?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: [simultaneous conversation] But I don’t know the details really well. But I’ll be brief myself, in my answer. I mean, I think it is a very important part of the job. Readers are expecting an opinion from us, you know, if we’re critics. And if you are too afraid to offer that opinion, then you're not really doing your job. It’s not necessarily the most important part of the job, or the most—I mean, it’s not the most interesting part of the job. But I do think a lot of critics make the mistake of sitting on the fence and not offering an opinion.\n\nSo, you know, I think a lot of people think well they need to be the village explainer, you know, the educator of the public. And I think that’s an enormous mistake, because, you know, first of all, especially in a town like Boston, there’s always going to be a whole bunch of people out there who know more than you do about the subject.\n\nAnd also, you know, it makes the writing less interesting. You know, that can be a big part of what you do. But you really do need to have an opinion. And so, you know, it’s one part of the— well, there are other parts of the paper, too. But it’s not the final word on anything, but it’s a great way to start a debate, by having an opinion.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: And to you, right behind you. Thanks for being so patient.\n\nQ: Oh, right. Thanks. Sorry. I’ll try to be brief. This might be also more for Sebastian. I’m sure you all sort of follow the British press occasionally. And you might be aware that they have been issuing super injunctions against the press. I mean, these are the judges, that is. I mean essentially gagging the press because of this new privacy article that is in the European Convention of Human Rights.\n\nSo, for instance, The Daily Mail is often being gagged. You know, they cannot publish a story, mostly about a celebrity, right. So I’m wondering what you think about that. And again, with the British press, because a lot of them are attracting more American viewers on their websites, and The Daily Mail has just increased their presence in New York, do you think this is going to increase—rather decrease the credibility and accuracy of the press in general, you know, less fact-checking as we’re known for, and a lot of others aren’t?\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: I’m wondering why you directed the question at me. [laughter]\n\nQ: Only because you worked—\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Because I was in London?\n\nQ: Yes, yes.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Why, of course, right. [laughter]\n\nQ: But no, it could be for any of you. [simultaneous conversation]\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Look, it’s a good question. I really don’t feel I can speak to it with any authority at all. I mean obviously the papers in the UK are a very special beast, those tabloids.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: Also a very different legal background—\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Yeah, exactly—\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: --and legal tradition.\n\nSEBASTIAN SMEE: Maybe that’s what you're asking about, how that plays out.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: In this country, one of the most unfortunate trends, as far as I’m concerned—and I’m essentially an anarchist on the question—has been a tendency to respect and obey injunctions. I was raised to look for ways to disobey them. [laughter] And hopefully that’ll return.\n\nThe thought I want to leave you with is, who knows why people read newspapers. I don’t think it’s just for an investigation or a Bruins score or a signing statement or to understand relationships or to understand fields of human expression. It’s all the above and more. But, for all the bad that we do, there really is a flip side. And I hope you’ve gotten a little sense of it this evening. And I leave you with a great thought from my favorite philosopher, Mick Jagger.\n\n[laughter] He said, “It’s only rock and roll. But I like it.” Thank you very much. [Applause]"
