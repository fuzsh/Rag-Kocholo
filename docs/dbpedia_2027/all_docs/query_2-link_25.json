        "text": "The New York Times won two Pulitzer Prizes on Monday for its reporting on Africa and for an investigative series on loopholes that allow the wealthiest Americans and corporations to avoid paying taxes. In a sign of the changing media landscape, two primarily online news outlets, The Huffington Post and Politico, won their first Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nAlso notable this year was the absence of prizes in two categories. The Pulitzer Prize Board at Columbia University in New York, which administers the awards, did not name a winner in the editorial writing category. More notably, the judges declined to name a winner for the highly coveted prize for fiction. The last time no winner was named for fiction was in 1977.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer, which like many regional newspapers has struggled lately with a decline in print advertising revenue and changes in ownership, won the award for public service, among the most prestigious in journalism. The Inquirer’s winning series focused on the pervasive, child-against-child violence in Philadelphia’s schools.\n\n“After all this newsroom has gone through in the last three or four years,” said The Inquirer’s editor, Stan Wischnowski. “Bankruptcy, being owned by hedge fund managers, the downsizing, so much that our staff had no control over. This is an absolute crowning achievement to their dedication and commitment to excellence.”"
