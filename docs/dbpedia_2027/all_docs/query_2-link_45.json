        "text": "Asheville Watchdog has been named a finalist in a national journalism contest for Selling Asheville, its 2023 four-part series examining the growth and impact of the city’s tourism industry.\n\nThe Institute for Nonprofit News (INN) recently named Selling Asheville one of eight finalists for the Insight Award for Explanatory Journalism. The winner will be announced Sept. 18 at a ceremony in Atlanta.\n\nSally Kestin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter, conceived the series and wrote or co-wrote three of its four installments. Investigative reporter Andrew R. Jones, reporter and columnist John Boyle and photographer Starr Sariego also teamed up on the project, which ran for four consecutive weeks in October and November.\n\nInstallments explained how tourism became a $3 billion behemoth that transformed the city’s economy following the 1983 implementation of an occupancy tax in Buncombe County; how the Buncombe County Tourism Development Authority spends occupancy tax proceeds on influencers, $250 shirts, and costly dinners as part of its self-perpetuating marketing machine; how that marketing has contributed to the growth in transplants and housing costs; and why local leaders have called for a reduction in the TDA’s marketing budget.\n\nAfter Selling Asheville’s conclusion, The Watchdog hosted a free public forum to discuss the series.\n\nINN represents more than 450 independent, nonprofit news organizations dedicated to public service. The Watchdog competed in the Small Division.\n\nThe contest drew 626 entries, the largest-ever pool. A panel of 75 judges from news organizations across the country selected the finalists.\n\nThis is the third year in a row The Watchdog has been recognized in this national contest. Equity Erased won INN’s Best Investigative Journalism Award in 2022 and its 12-part Down Town series was named a finalist for the same award in 2023.\n\nAsheville Watchdog is a nonprofit news team producing stories that matter to Asheville and Buncombe County.
