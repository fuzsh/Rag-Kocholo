        "text": "“When I was young, my father took lots of photographs and home movies. He set up studio lights on special occasions to take our family portrait. All of the pictures went into numerous photo albums — I know that my father had an influence on me.”\n\nCarolyn Cole won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize in feature photography “for her cohesive, behind-the-scenes look at the effects of civil war in Liberia” and her “special attention to innocent citizens caught in the conflict.” She said her parents gave her a camera for her high school graduation and she took it on a summer trip to Europe.\n\n“When I got home, I pored over my pictures and the details of their faces. I also loved to look at National Geographic and other travel magazines. Having grown up in suburbia, those magazines were an introduction to a larger world that I wanted to experience.”\n\nWhat is the most important thing you learned studying at UT?\n\n“I learned that to be good at something takes time and patience. I had several exceptional teachers. One of them was photojournalist Larry Price, who would spend hours in the field and then many more in the darkroom perfecting his prints. He taught me that to be a good photojournalist, you have to be fully dedicated.”\n\nWhat was it like entering an active war zone in Liberia?\n\n“I had never been to Africa, nor photographed street fighting before going to cover the civil conflict in Liberia in 2003. I got to Monrovia 10 days before the fighting reached the city, so I had time to familiarize myself with the town and people. Once the rebels reached Monrovia and the fighting and shelling increased, I joined with fellow photographers so that I would feel safer going to the front line. I always try to take precautions, like wearing a helmet and flak jacket, but there is always risk involved. It is my belief in the power and purpose of photojournalism that keeps me going in those situations.”\n\nWhen documenting an environment of suffering, how do you balance being both a person and a photographer?\n\n“I have always had a strong sense of purpose as a photojournalist. It is my job to witness and document what is happening. I channel all of my energy into making pictures that accurately represent the tragedy and suffering I am seeing. I want those who see the photographs to not only be informed, but also moved emotionally.\n\n“If I encounter a situation where someone needs help, and there is no one else able, then I will do what I can to assist that person. Sometimes it can be giving someone a ride to the hospital, or helping to buy a bit of food for a hungry family.”\n\nWhat was it like to win your second Pulitzer Prize?\n\n“I had been working as a photojournalist nearly 20 years before I won the Pulitzer Prize for feature photography in 2004. I try to make pictures that are powerful enough to be remembered, and by winning the Pulitzer, it is a guarantee that the photographs will be a part of the historical record.”\n\nWhat advice would you offer the next generation of journalists?\n\n“I worked at four small newspapers before joining the Los Angeles Times. I am glad I had that opportunity before going off to cover the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Liberia and so many other countries. Without those early assignments covering local and national news on deadline, I would not have had the experience necessary to successfully cover international news stories.”\n\nHow do you feel to have your accomplishments honored at UT?\n\n“I am very proud to be a UT graduate and to be honored in this way. UT started me on a journey that has taken me further than I ever imagined.”"
