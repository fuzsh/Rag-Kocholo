Khan is writing a book for Random House investigating America's air wars.\n\nHer investigations for the Times Magazine, the PBS series FRONTLINE, and BuzzFeed's Investigations team have prompted widespread policy impact from Washington to Kabul and won more than a dozen awards. They include the Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting, the National Magazine Award for Public Interest Journalism; the National Magazine Award for Reporting; the Polk Award for Military Reporting; the Overseas Press Club’s Ed Cunningham Award for Magazine Reporting and the Roy Rowan Award for Investigative Reporting; the Hillman Prize for Magazine Journalism; the John Seigenthaler Courage In Journalism Award; the Deadline Club Award for Independent Digital Reporting; the Deadline Club Award for Magazine Investigative Reporting; the SAJA Daniel Pearl Award for Outstanding Reporting on South Asia; and other honors.\n\nHer multi-part series in the New York Times, \"The Civilian Casualty Files,\" was awarded the 2022 Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting. The project was the culmination of more than five years of Khan’s reporting, including ground investigation at the sites of more than 100 civilian casualty incidents in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, more than 1,300 formerly secret military records she obtained in a legal battle with the Pentagon, and scores of interviews with military and local sources.\n\nKhan serves on the Board of Directors of the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, as First Vice-President of the Overseas Press Club’s Board of Governors, and on the Board of Directors of the Freedom of Press Foundation. She is an International Security Program Fellow at New America, where she was previously a Future of War Fellow.
