Before that, he worked for two years in Washington with the Boston Globe, where he covered diplomacy and the State Department. Since September 11, he has traveled to Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, the Persian Gulf, Europe, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Israel and the Palestinian territories. Prior to working for the Globe, he was news editor of the Los Angeles bureau of The Associated Press. Shadid worked as a Middle East correspondent for the AP in Cairo from 1995 to 1999, reporting and writing from most countries in the region.

Shadid, an American of Lebanese descent, speaks and reads Arabic, offering him insights not available to most Western journalists working in the Middle East.
