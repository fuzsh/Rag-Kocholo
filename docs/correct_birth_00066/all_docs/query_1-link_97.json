        "text": "More than half a century after her heyday, the enigma of “Madame”, as she was universally known following her marriage to China’s Nationalist wartime leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, continues to fascinate. Like a piece of Chinese jade that shifts its colour according to the light, Madame Chiang could by turns be entrancingly beautiful and disappointingly crude.\n\nSuch was the power of her allure that when she met Franklin D Roosevelt in the White House in October 1942, the president of the United States took the precaution of placing a card table between him and his guest to avoid being “vamped” (his word) by the woman then being described by Life magazine as China’s “Martha Washington”. The State Department security staff knew better, giving the “Dragon Lady”, as she was also known, the ironic code name “Snow White”.\n\nFeted in public as China’s “avenging angel”, a woman whose oratory reduced members of the US Congress to tears as she solicited support for her countrymen who suffered during the Japanese invasion, in private Madame Chiang was a “tart and brittle woman” who in fits of pique dumped waste-paper baskets on her servants’ heads.\n\nEven at the White House she ran the staff ragged. Too grand to use a telephone or call-bell, she summoned help with a sharp clap-clap of the hands, “as if they were Chinese coolies”. By the time she departed, FDR sourly observed that “the Chinese have lots of problems, and not the least of them is their prima donna”.\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1898, Soong Mei-ling (meaning “beautiful mood”) was the third daughter of Charlie Soong, a Methodist missionary who gave up his mission to become one of China’s most powerful businessmen. Educated at the reputed Wellesley College in America, Mei-ling was “part society belle, part would-be reformer” born into a world of immense privilege. Her elder sister Ching-ling married Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Chinese nation, her brother TV Soong was Chiang’s finance minister. In that sense, her marriage to Chiang Kai-shek in December 1927 was a dynastic arrangement that laid the foundations of her husband’s rise to power.\n\nWith her American education and perfect command of English – the Generalissimo spoke hardly a word – Mei-ling was in a unique position, acting as her husband’s translator and ambassador. When China was crying out for US aid to fight the Japanese and Mao Tse-tung’s Communists, it was Mei-ling who wrote passionate articles in The New York Times, made stirring radio broadcasts and embarked on fund-raising tours of America.\n\nYet given the obvious strength of the material at her disposal, Hannah Pakula’s Life of Madame Chiang is disappointing. This baggy monster of a biography too often loses sight of its subject. For entire chapters Madame Chiang is left in the wings as Pakula digresses on the tortuous history of revolutionary China. In attempting to show that Madame Chiang “changed the history of the 20th century”, she makes the mistake of retelling far too much of the history which has been better told elsewhere. The result is an account that desperately lacks narrative drive.\n\nThe best biograpers bring the reader into almost personal contact with their subject. But by attempting to frame Madame Chiang in the sweep of history, Pakula makes it impossible for herself to create the illusion of intimacy. There are moments when the story takes off, but only when Pakula leaves the bewilderingly large cast of warlords, generals and assorted courtiers behind to focus on the woman Hemingway called “the Empress of China”.\n\nMei Ling was then, and remains now, a mesmerising, contradictory character: “as coy and kittenish as a college co-ed, or as commanding and petty as a dormitory house mother,” according to the American journalist Theodore White. It is a pity, therefore, that despite the wealth of research and material on display here, this over-ambitious biography fails to capture that awkward spirit.\n\nThe Last Empress: Madame Chiang Kai-shek and\n\nthe Birth of\n\nModern China\n\nby Hannah Pakula\n\n848pp, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, £27.50"
