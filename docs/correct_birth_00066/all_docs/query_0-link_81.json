        "text": "BEDFORD — They’re from half-a-world apart, but Shawna Girgis and Ge Sumei shared huge smiles Tuesday.\n\nGirgis, the mayor of Bedford, and Ge Sumei, consultant of the municipal people’s government in Fenghua, China, signed a formal Friendship City agreement linking the two cities. About three dozen people, many of them city or county officials, were on hand to applaud the signing in the rotunda of the Lawrence County Courthouse.\n\nOne of those people was Gene McCracken, executive director of the Lawrence County Economic Growth Council. He said the significance of the day goes deeper than an exchange of documents, gifts and compliments. The delegation included people who can help form economic, cultural and educational ties with the Chinese.\n\n“This group will actually meet us in March when we go back to China,” he said. “We’re not just friendship cities. We’re developing friendships among people.”\n\nThat seemed clear from the exchange between Girgis and Ge Sumei during Tuesday’s formal ceremony. Each highlighted the strengths of their cities and surrounding regions. And each said they looked toward brighter futures.\n\nTuesday’s ceremony makes official an informal agreement that dates to June 2012. At that time, when a delegation from Bedford was visiting China, representatives of the two cities signed a memorandum of understanding to become friendship cities.\n\nThe one-page document signed Tuesday notes the two cities wish to “enhance mutual understanding and friendship” and “develop mutually beneficial cooperation.”\n\n“Both parties shall carry out, in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefits, exchanges and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, science, technology, tourism, education, personnel training in order to promote common prosperity and development,” it reads.\n\nSpeaking through a translator, Sumei called the brief statement “an important milestone in the history of both cities.”\n\n“Let’s have more exchanges and more collaborations,” she said.\n\nGirgis expressed similar sentiments.\n\n“The hearts of the people here in Bedford and all over the county are open to you, because you are our friends,” she said.\n\nKeepsakes\n\nAs a part of the ceremony, the two leaders exchanged gifts.\n\nSumei presented Girgis with a porcelain plate adorned with an image of Xikou Township. The area is famous as the birthplace of Chiang Kai-shek, who was the first president of Taiwan, and the home of the Laughing Buddha statue.\n\nGirgis presented Sumei with a large photograph of the Miss Indiana statue on the west side of the Lawrence County Courthouse lawn. The mayor said the statue is carved from Indiana limestone, which “means it is solid, dependable and timeless.”\n\nGirgis added that the two had spoken the night before about the challenges of being women in leadership roles. With that in mind, she presented Sumei with a medal from the Lawrence County Community Foundation’s “Walk with Excellence” program that honors local women.\n\nTrip around town\n\nThe representatives from Fenghua arrived in Indiana Monday and were greeted with a welcome dinner before spending the night at the Indiana University Memorial Union.\n\nThey arrived in Bedford Tuesday morning and were served a breakfast prepared by Bedford restaurant owner Sara Wong. Then they toured Stalker Elementary School and Bedford Machine & Tool before heading to the courthouse for the ceremony.\n\nAfter a lunch served at the Lawrence County Museum of History, the group visited the Twelve Months of Christmas and toured Geo-Flo before heading to Indianapolis International Airport and the flight home.\n\nRepresentatives\n\nJoining Girgis at the signing ceremony table Tuesday were McCracken, city council member Byron Buker, Lawrence County Commissioner Bill Spreen and Bedford Area Chamber of Commerce President Jamie Medlock.\n\nIn addition to Sumei, the Fenghua delegation included Situ Xiaofei, deputy director of the Fenghua Municipal People’s Government Office; Wu Shenglian, director of the Fenghua Shangtian Subdistrict Office; Li Changsheng, deputy director of the Fenghua Xikou Subdistrict Office; and Yu Feng, deputy director of the Fenghua Jinping Subdistrict Office.\n\nSeveral others have been involved in the Friendship City effort. Bedford’s paperwork for the event lists members of the local Foreign Investment Committee as well as community representatives.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE\n\n-- Girgis.\n\n-- McCracken.\n\n-- Medlock.\n\n-- Larry Ingraham, consultant on Asian markets, Ingraham & Associates.\n\n-- Mike Kern, committee chairman and vice president of Gaylor Inc.\n\n-- Gary Pruett, mayor of Mitchell.\n\nCOMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES\n\n-- Yea-Fen Chen, director of the Indiana University Chinese Flagship Center.\n\n-- Gary Conner, superintendent of the North Lawrence Community Schools.\n\n-- Dr. Kamal Girgis, doctor of internal medicine at Indiana University Health Bedford Hospital (and husband of the mayor).\n\n-- Marla Jones, Bedford’s business and community development director.\n\n-- Macy Nikirk, an intern with the Bedford Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\n-- Lei Wang, interpreter, from the educational leadership and policy studies program at IU."
