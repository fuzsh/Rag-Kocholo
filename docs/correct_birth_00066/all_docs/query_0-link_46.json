        "text": "While Chiang organized the academy - getting up a 5 in the morning, making up his own room, drilling students, inspecting equipment and planning - his agents were sneaking off to the north, organizing peasants and workers for the great day of insurrection. By July of 1926 the revolutionists were ready. Chiang gave the signal to the troops he had assembled. As they marched north, the ground seemed to heave in welcome to them. Moving swiftly, Chiang cut down one war lord after another. In three months his armies had occupied Hankow. Five months later they were in Nanking. By the middle of 1028 North China had been entirely conquered.\n\nBut Chiang was not yet through with war. In 1929 began a second series of civil wars which Chiang undertook to establish the authority of his government. Two campaigns in 1929, two more in 1930, brought further victories. Gradually war lords learned that the \"Central Government\" meant to govern. Chiang ruled with an iron hand. When his autocratic conduct of the government and arrest of political opponents brought cries of \"dictator\" from every part of the country, Chiang simply resigned again and returned with Madame Chiang to his native village. It was the Japanese who underlined how ill China could spare Chiang on this occasion. They had seized Manchuria in the fall of 1931, three months before Chiang was forced out of the Government. As the conflict spread, Shanghai erupted in the first Shanghai war of 1932. The Chinese realized that only Chiang Kai-shek could supply the necessary leadership during crisis. They made haste to call him back.\n\nThe years from 1931 to 1937 were, for Chiang, mostly years of preparation and domestic progress. He pushed his anti-Communist campaigns but he knew that the civil wars were only preliminaries and that eventually, in the main event, he would have to fight Japan. As Chiang's Central Government grew in strength the currency system throughout the country was unified, railroads were pushed through, the Army modernized and a stable basis of commerce and industry laid down. By the spring of 1937, Chiang had made of China one nation for the first time in a generation.\n\nThe Japanese could not wait to see China become powerful - and so, in July 1937, they struck. Chiang's armies could not match the mechanized Japanese. Slowly he retreated, trading space for time. A year and a half after the war's outbreak he had finally reached a stable line - and that line he has held almost changeless for the past three and a half years. From his rocky, uncomfortable mountain capital Chungking, Chiang today looks out on 2,800 miles of battle front, guarded by three million and more soldiers and the war goes on.\n\nLean and shaven-pated, Chiang is, by Chinese standards, a handsome man. He stands always as if there were a ramrod of steel in his back. When seated, rarely talking, frequently stroking his smooth chin with a nervous gesture. Chiang has a terrific temper. In anger, his naturally high-pitched voice shoots up till it is almost falsetto and the blunt harsh words come rumbling out, sparing no one. In such fury he has been known to demote the highest-placed generals without a second thought.\n\nChiang's favorite form of assent is the single one-word grunt, \"hao\" (good) or \"ko ye\" (can do).\n\nTwo important Americans in China talk with Chiang at a Chungking tea. Colonel Claire L. Chennault (left) is head of the American Volunteer Group which has covered itself with glory in the fighting over Burma. Owen Lattimore (center) was hand-picked by President Roosevelt, at Chiang's request, to be the Generalissimo's economic advisor.\n\nWith such a grunt he may set in motion half a million men. Chiang rarely composes the smoothly eloquent declarations that appear over his name. They are the products, usually, of his old secretary Ch'en Pu-lei, a former journalist who joined Chiang's staff many years ago. Chiang's widely published diary of the Sian kidnapping consists of Chiang's original, curt, staccato jottings, polished up to a bright gloss for popular consumption.\n\nChiang declaims his speeches in a high falsetto that is quickly absorbed and lost in great mass meetings. He finishes his speeches with an abrupt gesture, a flat sweeping motion of the hand, a short bark, \"wan le\" (finished). In off-the-record conversations with his ministers, he is pithy, picturesque or profound but his public pronouncements rarely reveal his personality. His niggardly, grudging use of the spoken word is the despair of visiting journalists who may be granted an audience of ten or 15 minutes with the great man. They usually spend two or three minutes outlining long involved questions to which Chiang listens in quiet patience. When the question is over and translated Chiang usually murmurs softly, \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"very difficult.\"\n\nChiang is Generalissimo of the Armed Forces, Chairman of the National Military Council, Chairman of the Supreme National Defense Council, President of the Executive Yuan (Premier), Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Political Council, Chairman of the Joint Board of the four Government banks, Director-General of the Kuomintang, President of the National New Life Movement, Director General of the San Min Chu I Youth Corps, Principal of the Central Military Academy, of the Central Political Institute and the Central Aviation Academy - in addition to his United Nations job as Supreme Commander. His favorite job is the Army. Most distasteful to him is probably the premiership. He appeared at meetings of the cabinet, it is said, only four times in the first 18 months after he assumed the post. Chinese usually refer to Chiang as \"Wei Yuan Chang\" - a title meaning \"The Committee Head\" (National Military Council). When his old comrades, the buccaneering, colorful, roistering crew of old soldiers who have fought with and against Chiang for the past 20 years, speak of him they say simply \"lao chiang\" - \"old chiang\" - with a reminiscent affection.\n\nChiang today is an ascetic - he neither smokes, drinks, plays cards nor gambles. The turbulence of his youth, the gay parties and long nights in Suchow for which he was famous, are over. He is rather humorless - which is odd in a nation noted for its highly developed sense of humor. Chiang's only personal relaxation now is picnicking. He likes long walks in the country with Madame Chiang and a few personal friends. While the children of many lesser Government ministers are safe in America or in soft jobs, Chiang's own children - two sons - are working hard in unimportant posts far from their father. His younger, Ching-kuo, is a lieutenant at the northern front. The elder, Wei-kuo, is a prefectural superintendent in South Central China.\n\nChiang lives in a ten-room house in a Chungking suburb, surrounded by a 40-ft. stone wall, whose driveway is guarded by two fully armed soldiers. Within the compound, the grounds are most carefully patrolled by plain clothesmen and uniformed guards. Chiang rises at 5 in the morning, does Chinese physical exercises in his own room, prays in silence. At 7 he eats a light meal of fruit, toast, coffee. Madame and the Generalissimo used to have specially selected foods (including Sunkist oranges, Knox's gelatin, apples), flown up to them from Hong Kong. After breakfast he reads reports, petitions, mail sifted to him through the army, the Party and the civilian Government, marking the documents with one simple Chinese character in blue ink \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nHe and Madame Chiang usually lunch alone, except on Fridays. On Fridays, Chiang has about 20 important people in to discuss problems of state. After lunch he has a short rest, then more reports and conferences. In the afternoons he is likely to drive downtown, in one of his enormous American-built limousines, to the National Military Council for a conference. On such drives Chiang is preceded and followed by cars of bodyguards dressed in gray or black. Chiang's bodyguard, organized by Germans and highly efficient, is with him constantly. Chiang has lived in constant danger of death since the first assassination attempt against him in 1914. Many attempts have been made to kill him since, but during the war years in Chungking all such incidents have been immediately shushed. Chiang's personal courage is unquestioned. During air raids he is the constant worry of his subordinates who urge him to shelter long before he himself is ready to go. Occasionally, after the alarm is sounded, he will decide to sit the air raid out across the river in his mountain cottage. With all the streets deathly still, Chiang will race through the empty, dusty roads in his limousine, shoot across the swiftly swirling Yangtze in his private launch and then unhurriedly stroll into the waiting car on the other side.\n\nThe Chiangs dine at 7:30, usually in private, although there may be entertainment for important visiting foreigners or generals later in the evening. When Chiang spreads himself on a banquet, the food is superlative, but normally the table is quite simple for a Chungking official. After dinner Chiang reads, wearing simple rimless reading glasses. He has a fondness for history and almost never reads fiction. Before going to bed he writes in his diary - briefly, simply. The last thing he does before turning in is to plug a phone call through to the National Military Council asking for the latest reports from the front. These being all right, he goes to sleep.\n\nChiang has aged greatly during the war. His mustache has begun to show flicks of gray. His back was injured during the Sian kidnapping and he has never fully recovered since. He used to suffer badly from toothaches, but is now quite satisfied with his new false teeth made by a Canadian dentist at the mission-supported West China Union University School of Dentistry. Chiang is always immaculately dressed. He usually appears on public occasions in a simple khaki uniform, trussed in a Sam Browne belt. For pictures he sometimes appears in his epaulets. At other times he likes to wear simple Sun Yat-sen suits - a popular pajama-like garment, buttoning high at the neck. At home, he often wears his long Chinese gown and a dark jacket over it.\n\nChiang's chief joy and delight in life is his wife, Mei-ling, whose career and accomplishments are probably better known to most U.S. newsreaders than her husband's. Chiang first met Mei-ling Soong in Canton during the early days of the revolution. As the outstanding military figure of the Nationalists, Chiang had as associates such leaders as Sun Yat-sen and H. H. Kung, both of them married to Soong sisters, daughters of the celebrated Bible salesman Charles Soong. Promptly, and conveniently, the handsome young general and the beautiful daughter of what was to become the most distinguished family in the nation fell genuinely in love. Chiang was already married to an old fashioned Chinese girl from whom he had separated. His divorce, courtship and conversion to Methodist Christianity took place over a period of eight years."
