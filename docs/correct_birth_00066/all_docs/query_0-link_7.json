Located in a fertile plain area 17 miles (27 km) southwest of Ningbo, Fenghua is an agricultural trade centre (e.g., rice and wheat) and specializes in orchard crops, especially peaches and plums. The former Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi) was born in Fenghua in 1887. Xikouzhen, his birthplace, and the nearby Xuedou Hill, Tingxia Lake, and the surrounding area have become tourist attractions. Administratively, the town of Fenghua was changed to a county-level city in 1988. Pop. (2000) 208,806."
