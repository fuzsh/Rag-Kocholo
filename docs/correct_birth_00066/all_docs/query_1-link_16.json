        "text": "“Seek truth from facts.” -Chinese Proverb\n\nImagine losing the most populous country on earth. That wouldn’t look good on a resume. This was the fate of Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader of China from 1927-1949, who lost the Chinese Civil to Mao Zedong’s communists. History doesn’t treat losers kindly and today Chiang is often regarded with less favor than Mao, who killed more people than Hitler or Stalin.\n\nMyths and Historical Context:\n\nHowever, many negative perceptions of Chiang Kai-shek have been exposed as myths, thanks to decades of scholarship via books like The Generalissimo by Jay Taylor, Forgotten Ally by Rana Mitter, and China at War by Hans van de Ven.\n\nRather than being corrupt Chiang ate and drank simply, lived a Spartan lifestyle, and constantly criticized unscrupulous subordinates. Often dismissed as incompetent Chiang made great strides towards modernizing China during the Nanking Decade, scored diplomatic triumphs that put China back among the great powers, paved the road to Chinese unity, and kept China together during 8 years of fighting Japan in World War 2. Accused of prioritizing the fight against the Chinese Communists (the CCP), rather than Japan during the war, it was the other way. Mao let Chiang’s forces do the lion-share of fighting, and dying, while the CCP laid low and built up strength for the postwar showdown with Chiang’s Nationalist regime (the KMT).\n\nChastised by America for supposedly doing little with the Lend-Lease it provided him, in reality China received a tiny amount of it compared to Britain and Russia. Meanwhile, American promises to China were watered down, or broken from Pearl Harbor to Yalta, where America undermined Chinese interests in Manchuria to get Stalin to attack Japan. Westerners from General Joseph Stilwell, Margaret Tuchman, fellow travellers, and useful idiots, have tried discrediting Chiang’s reputation for decades with much success. By contrast inconvenient truths like America giving Japan more weapons and resources than to China in the first half of World War 2, or the arrogant attitude of American officials, including President Roosevelt, towards China are mostly forgotten.\n\nPerhaps best known as “the man who lost China,” Chiang’s critics often suggest he had countless advantages he bungled to lose China, and then fled to Taiwan to live out the rest of his life in ignominy. A more objective analysis suggests Chiang Kai-shek had too many enemies to fight, and too many problems to tackle. Chinese warlords always challenged his authority, and Japan attacked his regime often, then tried conquering China outright. Mao’s communist ideology (utopian in theory, dystopian in practice) undermined Chiang’s relatively benign form of enlightened authoritarianism, and offered a misguided alternate path for China’s future.\n\nOther nations weren’t more accommodating. To say Stalin’s policy towards China was cynical would be an understatement. Russia backed the KMT in the early 1920s, switched support to the CCP in the Nanking Decade, then gave weapons to Chiang Kai-shek in the first half of World War 2 to keep Japan distracted. Then it cut off this support in early 1941, after signing a non-aggression pact with Japan, and hedged its bets after World War 2 by signing a peace treaty with Chiang and also providing support for the CCP!\n\nAs noted above America’s hypocrisy towards Chiang was obvious. It only started providing a good flow of weapons and material to the KMT after World War 2, and soon stopped it in the last phase of the Chinese Civil War, abandoning its ally as it later did in Vietnam and Afghanistan. It remains unclear if America won’t also abandon Ukraine.\n\n***\n\nBesides this, Chiang Kai-shek ruled China only nominally after coming to power in 1927. Despite theoretical unity the warlords and communists controlled much of the country. China’s infrastructure, industry, and economy were backwards, often nonexistent, compared to the Western powers and Japan. Formal education, modern technology, even a sense of nationalism, was often limited to major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan and Guangzhou. The countryside, as today, was relatively poor and neglected. This gave Mao his decisive opening by cultivating Chinese peasants, 90% of the population, as the vanguards of the revolution.\n\nChina’s military forces were divided between warlords, the CCP, and Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists and were generally poorly trained, equipped, and led. The old Chinese proverb “don’t waste good iron for nails or good men for soldiers” appears idealistic, even cute. But it wasn’t an effective mindset to counter Japan’s hawkish generals, or militarized society, that led to the Rape of Nanking, 14 million Chinese deaths, and 100,000,000 refugees in China between 1937-1945.\n\nBesides World War 2 Chiang had to deal with other conflicts during his rule on the mainland. His Northern Expedition to unite China has been described as the largest military campaign between both World Wars. There was the first (1927-1936) and second (1946-1949) parts of the Chinese Civil War. Chiang had to fight warlords constantly, including the Central Plains War that saw more than 250,000 casualties. There was also the brief Sino-Soviet War in 1929 over the control of railways in Manchuria.\n\nJapan was a constant nuisance for China even before World War 2 broke out after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937. During the prior decade there were many incidents between China and Japan. S.C.M. Paine has noted the habit of Japanese ultranationalists to label skirmishes, battles, full blown wars, and even war crimes as incidents.\n\nThis isn’t surprising as Japan often manipulates its imperial history, instead of facing an honest reckoning. For Japanese ultranationalists the rule of thumb could be when it doubt deny, and if you can’t deny, minimize. Who else would call the Second Sino-Japanese War the China Incident, or the Rape of Nanking the Nanking Incident?\n\nThus, there was the Jinan Incident in 1928, the Mukden Incident of 1931, the Shanghai Incident in 1932, Japan’s Great Wall Campaign of 1933, and Japanese support of Chinese proxies fighting against KMT rule, including an inner Mongolian leader with the unique name of Demchugdongrub. Whatever can be said about Chinese history for this period you can’t call it uneventful!\n\nFaced with these countless enemies and domestic issues, it isn’t so surprising Chiang Kai-shek failed to tackle many of them, but that his regime accomplished anything at all. Unsurprisingly, in such circumstances Chiang constantly sought to guarantee the weak foundations of his rule. Political survival is the first priority of any national leader (especially non-democratic ones). Whatever Chiang Kai-shek’s flaws he mastered this by striking quickly and decisively against internal threats, playing enemies (even subordinates) off each other, and relying upon an intelligence chief so vile he was nicknamed China’s Himmler. Even his worst American critic, Joseph Stilwell, admitted Chiang was “the most astute politician of the twentieth century. He must be or he wouldn’t be alive.”\n\nCareer:\n\nAs for leadership qualities Chiang Kai-shek’s toolbox was mixed. He was usually calm during a crisis, great at analyzing geopolitical developments, was a model of discipline and frugality, and as Jay Taylor noted, knew “how best to play a weak hand.” Given the disadvantages listed above he must have had many weak hands indeed. On the other hand, his leadership suffered from a tendency to micromanage, the willingness to take on too many roles (over 80 during wartime), and often promoting officials based on loyalty over merit. Perhaps worse, his inability, or unwillingness, to clamp down on widespread corruption, and not focusing on Chinese social and economic issues, undermined his legitimacy to rule China according to the Mandate of Heaven.\n\nChiang Kai-shek’s rise to power was no less colorful than his reign. Apparently he was a cantankerous, difficult child who relished war games and ordered his classmates around. Being the son of a salt merchant with some financial means, he received the traditional Confucius education. He studied for a while at a Chinese military academy, then lived in Japan for a few years; learning Japanese and serving in the army.\n\nDisgusted by the decadent Qing Dynasty during his youth he became a revolutionary and participated in many of Sun Yat-sen’s (the spiritual father of modern Chinese unity) revolutionary coups. Heeding the historical cliche “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” he would accumulate, or drop, allies when needed. The long list includes revolutionaries, Shanghai gangsters, Russian, German and American advisors, temporary alliances with the CCP, Stalin, Chinese warlords and landlords, etc. If anyone needed an extensive rolodex in the early half of the 20th Century it would’ve been Chiang.\n\nSun Yat-sen might be seen as China’s spiritual leader, and Mao as the founder of modern China, but Chiang Kai-shek was the one who got the ball running. Sun Yat-sen was a charismatic visionary but he was a poor statesman, let alone politician. He spent much of his time playing chess, planning railroads, and making ill-advised alliances with unscrupulous warlords, who usually outwitted him. Mao was less honorable than Sun Yat-sen, and beat Chiang to win mainland China, but he was a relatively minor character until after World War 2. Meanwhile, by 1945 Chiang had already done the lion-share of the work to unify and modernize China, and put it back among the great powers.\n\nIt was Chiang Kai-shek who launched the Northern Expedition that unified China (nominally at least) in 1926, and presided over the Nanking Decade, which saw unprecedented modernizing efforts and economic, industrial, and infrastructure growth in the country. He renegotiated customs duties and unfavourable agreements with the western powers, and quashed the unequal treaties imposed by the West. He also scored diplomatic victories for China like making it one of the four major allies in World War 2, and gaining it a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. He consistently outfought, and eroded, the influence of self-interested Chinese warlords, and steered China through the bloody, tragic, but successful war against Japan.\n\nHowever, despite all of this he miscalculated his odds against Mao after 1945, lost the Chinese Civil War, and fled to Taiwan in 1949. The worst part was that over a decade earlier Chiang Kai-shek was on the verge of annihilating the CCP, while it licked its wounds from the Long March (1934-1935) in Yan’an in the remote Shaanxi province. Chiang only had to launch one last big effort against the CCP to crush it, or chase it across the border into the Soviet Union.\n\nInstead, during the Xi’an Incident in 1936 he was kidnapped by some of his generals, including the playboy, opium-smoking Zhang Xueliang, who wanted Chiang to fight Japan instead of fellow Chinese. Understandably this was a popular sentiment in China, especially for the urban population, but it was naive given China’s weak military position versus Japan. As S.C.M. Paine sardonically remarked in The Wars for Asia “China’s idealistic and privileged students got the war they demanded, fought by China’s legions of underprivileged peasant youth.”\n\nIn reality, Chiang Kai-shek was pursuing his policy of internal pacification before external resistance by undermining Chinese warlords, and especially the CCP, to achieve Chinese unity before confronting Japan later. From a strategic and military point of view Chiang was 100% correct. However, Chinese domestic opinion, and continuous Japanese aggression, made this priority politically difficult. During the Nanking Decade he slowly built up his military with foreign (usually German) aid for what he assumed would be a showdown with Japan after the CCP was crushed. But the Xi’an Incident and outrage by Chinese students forced him to fight Japan in 1937, despite his German advisors stressing he needed at least 2 more years to improve his army.\n\nThe idea Chiang Kai-shek could have confronted Japan’s military with any prospect of success is discredited by a serious study of military history of the period. China had more territory and manpower than Japan but these were its only advantages. Japan was unified and had a strong economic and industrial base that supported strong armed forces. It also had a mostly skilled and educated populace to support its war effort. China had little of these at the time.\n\nJapan’s naval and air forces completely outclassed China’s small equivalents, while its ground forces were supplied with far more, and usually better, tanks, artillery, machine guns, and small arms. Japanese divisions had more troops, support services, firepower, and its soldiers were aggressive, motivated and better trained than the Chinese. Despite Chiang’s efforts at unity and building armed forces, a big portion of Chinese forces in 1937 were warlord and CCP troops who were seldomly reliable, or loyal. Japan was also not above using chemical weapons, sanctioned by the supposedly powerless Emperor Hirohito.\n\nEven Chiang Kai-shek’s best forces were not a one to one match for Japanese soldiers, and after years of lost battles it was calculated China needed a numerical superiority of six to one against Japanese forces to guarantee success in any fight. Japan’s leaders estimated a Japanese regiment could take on a good Chinese division, and a Japanese battalion could handle a standard one. Depending upon the forces they faced, it’s thought Japanese divisions had 3-12 times the firepower vs. Chinese ones.\n\nThe historical record shows how often the Chinese were successful when fighting Japan. During the Jinan Incident in 1928 the Japanese inflicted 6000 Chinese casualties while suffering 200. In the initial fighting in Mukden in September 1931, which led to the annexation of Manchuria, Japan killed 500 Chinese while losing two soldiers. Chinese forces likewise took disproportionate casualties at Shanghai in 1932 and during the Great Wall Campaign in 1933.\n\nEven four years of relative peace between China and Japan (1933-1937), and Chiang Kai-shek’s efforts to improve his military, didn’t even the odds for World War 2. In most battles larger Chinese forces were routed with disproportionate casualties, including 4-1 losses at Shanghai in 1937, to potentially 20-1 during Japan’s Ichigo offensive in 1944. Chinese forces, with much bravely and despite many disadvantages, managed battlefield triumphs like Taierzhuang in 1938, the first three Battles of Changsha, and the Alamo-like defence of Hengyang in 1944, but the general trend was Japanese victories.\n\nThe idea Chiang Kai-shek should have focused on Japan, rather than the CCP, during the Nanking Decade, has been advocated by countless historians, but it’s been exposed as naive and unrealistic based on harsh military realities. In The Art of War Sun Tzu suggests “he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.” Chiang knew it was not the right time to fight Japan, but Zhang Xueliang and China’s idealistic students didn’t.\n\nHowever, Zhang and the students got their way, and Chiang Kai-shek was forced to ally with the CCP to confront Japan in 1937. The results were eight years of destruction, rape, famine, flood, and Japan seizing China’s main cities, railways, and coastal areas. War brought 14 million Chinese deaths, 100 million refugees, the destruction of Chiang’s modernization efforts, the weakening of his regime, and the resurgence of a strong CCP by 1945.\n\nThis helped Mao’s victory in 1949, which left Chiang with the crying trophy of Taiwan (at least he didn’t have to flee to Disappointment Island in the South Pacific). Ultimately, Chiang was correct believing Japan, despite its strength and ruthlessness, could never overrun China; but that the CCP, with its appealing ideology and discipline, could. To paraphrase Chiang, Japan had been a disease of the skin, but the communists were the disease that killed his regime’s heart.\n\n***\n\nMany accounts of Chiang Kai-shek’s life end with his humiliating retreat to Taiwan, but ironically it was there he cemented his legacy. To be fair there were excesses like the February 28 Incident of 1947, the crushing of an anti-KMT uprising that saw at least 20,000 Taiwanese deaths. Chiang also never instituted democracy, martial law persisted during his reign, and while the White Terror death toll may have been vastly lower (in numbers and proportion) than Mao’s atrocities on the mainland, it’s still an unforgivable blemish on his record.\n\nHowever, without the many enemies he had on the mainland, and enjoying better conditions on Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek had more peace, flexibility, and opportunities for state building than his chaotic tenure in China. He finally eliminated the widespread corruption in the KMT, enacted land reform, and supported industrial and economic growth, making Taiwan into one of the richest countries in the region. While he never supported democracy, his son began the process which lead to Taiwan becoming one of the most prosperous liberal democracies in Asia. Despite this, and modern scholarship highlighting Chiang’s accomplishments, his reputation has suffered in Taiwan during the past decades. Ironically, it has improved drastically in the West and even China!\n\nLooking at Taiwan and China during the mid-1970s, when Chiang Kai-shek and Mao died, Chiang’s Taiwan model for China appeared better than Mao’s dystopia on the mainland. Mao might have won the Chinese Civil War, fought America to a standstill in the Korean War, improved Chinese infrastructure and health care, and gave China nukes. But regarding economics, industry, freedom, culture, and relative oppression, Mao’s China experiment failed versus Chiang’s imperfect Taiwanese equivalent.\n\nThis is Mao Zedong’s legacy: Countless Chinese murdered during land reform and the Anti-Rightist Campaign. Tens of millions of Chinese who starved to death during the Great Leap Forward. The Cultural Revolution that saw society tear itself apart, traditional Chinese culture purged on the mainland, and the stagnation of China’s economy. This delayed China’s, up until recently, stupendous economic takeoff, for decades.\n\nSuch historical realities represent the 30% of things Mao did wrong, according to Deng Xiaoping, who said Mao was “70 percent right and 30 percent wrong.” By contrast Chiang’s relatively peaceful, prosperous, and increasingly positive rule in Taiwan appears superior indeed.\n\nTaiwan was in a good position to continue its successes after Chiang Kai-shek died, while Deng Xiaoping had to overturn many of Mao’s policies to put China on a more positive path to stability and economic development (ironically by copying Taiwan’s model). This suggests that in terms of ideology, governance and overall results, Chiang’s Confucius, modern vision for Taiwan provides a superior model to Mao’s communist dead end. China’s economy may still surpass America’s, but with its cynical blend of political communism and rapacious capitalism, along with its demographic, environmental and social ills, China will more likely become grey before it becomes rich. Rather than control the world China will more likely decline like Soviet Russia, and Japan before it (both of whom were assumed to one day eclipse America’s dominant position).\n\nAs Robert D. Kaplan once remarked:\n\nHistory is a battle of ideas. Confucianism has triumphed over communism. Democracy and enlightened authoritarianism has triumphed over totalitarianism. And Chiang’s humanity, however imperfect, will triumph in Chinese minds over Mao’s epic cruelty.\n\nPersonality and Relationships:\n\nThat said Chiang Kai-shek was not always noble, let alone a particularly pleasant man. As Simon Whistler, the host of Biographics, noted “while it’s tempting to hold him up as a saint compared to Chairman Mao, being less of a colossal dick than Mao Zedong is kind of a low bar to clear.” What was Chiang’s character like? Or what about his relationships and how he saw other peoples and nations? Unsurprisingly, these varied as much as his successes and failures.\n\nIn his youth he drank heavily, visited brothels, and was a womanizer. He settled down as he aged and enjoyed no vices, and indulged in few luxuries. Although dedicating himself to Confucianism he also converted to Christianity, which he apparently took very seriously. Indeed, he read the bible often, was fond of sermonizing his troops and officials, and compared himself to Jesus Christ in his diary multiple times.\n\nDespite this he could be ruthless when he deemed it necessary, like his decision to breach the Yellow River dykes in June 1938 to stem the Japanese advance, which drowned at least 400,000 Chinese civilians. He also ordered Changsha to be burned rather than fall to Japan, which was not only tragic as it killed 30,000 people, but pointless as the Japanese stopped short of the city. While not as vindictive as the average dictator, he was not above cruelty, like the brutal murder of a warlord (along with most of his family) who kidnapped him in 1936, or the massacre of communist members in Shanghai in 1927.\n\nWhile he was usually calm during a crisis there were times, according to Brian Crozier, where he succumbed to rage, yelled uncontrollably, pounded tables, or threw teacups at bearers of bad news. He once had a projectionist beaten simply because the poor fellow showed a film he took offense to. Perhaps more justly he once assaulted an officer he met who was leading conscripts who were bound to each other by rope.\n\nHe was also prone to sobbing, like when he was chastised in 1926 for putting Guangzhou under Martial Law, and when General Joseph Stilwell humiliated him (with the connivance of President Roosevelt), while trying to coerce Chiang to put all Chinese forces under Stilwell’s command in 1944! That he was usually quiet, courteous, rigid, and controlled during most circumstances doesn’t explain how quickly his emotions could change. His supporters could call him complicated while detractors could suggest he was emotionally unstable.\n\nIt should be stressed despite his authoritarianism and flaws he was no fascist. Whatever Chiang Kai-shek was he didn’t advocate racial hierarchy, glorifying war, or a cult of personality. That he had a tiny following of Chinese fascists and admired Germany’s disciplined society and military was one thing. But there’s no evidence he espoused the kind of expansionist, violent, and revisionist agenda Nazi Germany advocated. According to his biographer, Jay Taylor, Chiang never praised Hitler, or noted the Führer’s achievements in his diary (unlike many historical characters who later denied admiring Hitler).\n\nHowever, Chiang Kai-shek wasn’t above stereotypes or prejudices. Despite his time in Japan, serving in its army and admiring its orderly society, he had unkind words for the Japanese. This included calling them dwarf pirates and listing ways to kill them in his diary at one point. For Chiang the British were politically astute, but cynical, and the Americans the exact opposite. Given Britain’s imperial history Chiang’s diary has plenty of slurs against it like “how can we emancipate mankind if we cannot annihilate the English?” After initially being snubbed by the British after offering troops to defend Burma, Chiang angrily replied: “Resisting the Japanese is not like suppressing colonial rebellions” and “for this kind of job, you British are incompetent, and you should learn from the Chinese how to fight against the Japanese.”\n\n***\n\nChiang Kai-shek had interesting personal relationships as well.\n\nHe had 3-4 wives depending upon the source. His first marriage was arranged when he was 14, he mostly hated her, and it’s rumored Chiang beat her. Yet he remained married for many years, even bearing a child with her out of loyalty to his mother, who threatened to kill herself if he divorced. Chiang dumped her eventually and married a much younger girl (he was nearly 35, she was 15). This appears reprehensible but such age gaps weren’t uncommon at the time. However, infecting her with syphilis (Chiang likely having caught it from a prostitutes years before) on their honeymoon was reprehensible to say the least! Despite this, she was loyal and loving, only to be dumped later in favor of his final wife, Soong Mei-ling (often referred to as Madame Chiang Kai-shek).\n\nSoong Mei-ling was in many ways the polar opposite of Chiang. If he dressed simply and lived Spartanly, she was flashy and enjoyed luxury. Chiang appeared cold, aloof, even unworldly, while she was gregarious, friendly and cultured. Having been educated in America and speaking excellent english, she provided him with good insights about the West, and she was a charming ambassador, and competent translator. Additionally, she belonged to one of the most powerful, influential families in China. While they were in love there was no doubt a cynical calculation in his decision to expend his previous wife, and marry Soong Mei-ling to gain more status.\n\nMuch like Princess Diana she became a world celebrity and engaged in many charitable causes, such as opening orphanages and visiting hospitals during World War 2. Also like Princess Diana she could be a prima donna and often succumbed to depression. Unlike Princess Diana she didn’t have numerous affairs and was loyal to her husband. When Chiang was kidnapped at Xi’an in 1936 she voluntarily joined him in captivity. She also stood by him throughout the war against Japan, the Chinese Civil War, and even after losing mainland China. Not every husband would be so lucky!\n\nChiang Kai-shek had two sons: Chiang Ching-kuo from his first marriage, and an adopted son named Chiang Wei-kuo. Perhaps highlighting Nationalist China’s constant switching of allies the former was sent to the Soviet Union to study, while the latter went to Nazi Germany and temporarily served in its army. Stuck in the Soviet Union when Chiang betrayed the CCP (who planned to betray him first), Chiang Ching-Kuo disowned his father and they weren’t reunited until Stalin brokered the Second United Front between the KMT and CCP a decade later.\n\nAlthough Chiang initially favored his adopted, more attractive, son it was Chiang Ching-kuo who consolidated power in Taiwan after Chiang Kai-shek died, and led the nation until his death in 1988. Although a dictator like his father he did institute more freedoms and liberalization of society, and gave more opportunities to the native Taiwan population, who had been neglected in favour of the mainland Chinese who had fled to the island in 1949. These actions put Taiwan on track to becoming the strong liberal democracy it remains today.\n\nPerhaps Chiang Kai-shek’s most challenging relationship wasn’t within his family but with an outsider: General Joseph Stilwell, the main American liaison to China after Pearl Harbor. While Mao Zedong is seen as Chiang Kai-shek’s arch nemesis, Stilwell was unquestionably his most obnoxious and annoying antagonist. Having the ear of General Marshall in Washington, control of American Lend-Lease for China, and given America’s policy was to keep China in the fight to bog down Japan’s army with the least amount of material support possible, meant Stilwell had leverage over Chiang, his titular superior. This, along with Stilwell’s notoriously difficult personality (hence his nickname Vinegar Joe), made it inevitable his relationship with Chiang would be a tumultuous one.\n\nLike Chiang Kai-shek’s complicated position in China, which needed considerable political and diplomatic skill to deal with the countless factions involved, Stilwell was given a sensitive role in the allied war effort in World War 2. The China-Burma-India Theater Stilwell was dropped into required considerable patience, understanding and diplomacy given the differing interests and visions that China, America and Britain had in mind regarding the war effort, and the future of Asia. This doesn’t even count the Japanese, who they were supposed to be fighting!\n\nUnfortunately, Joseph Stilwell was singularly incompetent to manage such a role as a crucial liaison between the Americans, British and Chinese for the war against Japan. Hans van de Ven in China at War provides a damning quote regarding Stilwell in this respect:\n\nIt did not help that General Stilwell was a difficult man. With the exception of General Marshall, he held everybody in contempt, not just Chiang Kai-shek (‘the Peanut’) or the Nationalist commander-in-chief He Yingqin (‘graced by no distinction in combat command’), but also, on the British side, General Archibald Wavell (‘a tired, depressed man pretty well beaten down’); General Alexander (‘astonished to find ME - mere me, a goddam American - in command of Chinese troops. Extrawdinery! Looked me over as if I had just crawled from under a rock’); and Mountbatten (one of the ‘Kandy Kids’, that is, someone enjoying life at the splendorous headquarters of South East Asia Command at Kandy on Sir Lanka). His fellow Americans fared no better. Stilwell could not stand General Chennault, of course, but he had as little regard for his successor, General Wedemeyer: ‘Good God - to be ousted in favour of Wedemeyer - that would be a disgrace.’\n\nHe even referred to the wheelchair-bound President Franklin Roosevelt as rubber legs.\n\nStilwell had laudable qualities like having remarkable physical endurance for his age, not hesitating to speak truth to power, and believed in his mission. But his difficult personality meant he was all but impossible to work with, and unable to take criticism. Meanwhile, his inability to understand the complexities of the political and social conditions in China dictated his relationship with Chiang Kai-shek would be untenable.\n\nThus, Stilwell’s command of Chinese troops in Burma in 1942 ended in disaster, while his refusal to provide Chiang’s forces with support hurt China’s war effort in 1944, when Japan launched its biggest offensive of the war. When Stilwell was asked to send vital supplies to the brave defenders of Henyang, who held out more than 40 days against overwhelming odds, Stilwell put his pride over Chinese lives. He declined and merely said “let them stew.” Finally, Stilwell’s arrogant embarrassment of Chiang, who was about to give him control of ALL Chinese forces in the same year, arguably began the distrust and bad blood that plagues Sino-American relations to this day.\n\nIt’s tempting to suggest Stilwell was a gung-ho, old fashioned soldier willing to attack the Japanese head on, yet history confirms him going AWOL during the Burma campaign in 1942, abandoning the Chinese forces Chiang Kai-shek had readily provided him. Despite rejecting Chiang’s suggestion to adopt a defensive posture, and his advice regarding the skill of Japanese forces, Stilwell pushed through an attack, it went badly, the allies were routed, and Stilwell ran away and abandoned his troops.\n\nHad he been leading American forces he would have faced a court-martial. If he was a Chinese commander he would have faced a firing squad. Instead he turned going AWOL into the celebrated March out of Burma and wooed the American press with his simple, tough-talking language that hid the reality of his incompetence.\n\nUltimately, Stilwell was fired but he found many open ears to attack Chiang’s Kai-shek’s regime, and until the last decade his version of events has been favored in books, schools, and the media. On the other hand, Chiang had some champions including the China Lobby in America and Time Magazine, which had enough sympathy to put him on the cover 10 times (even naming him and his wife man and woman of the year in 1937).\n\nUnique among great historical characters Chiang Kai-shek had plenty of introspection and self-awareness. Despite being Machiavellian, sometimes ruthless, and composed in public, his diary betrays a more self-critical side. Perhaps this was a product of his combined Confucius-Christian worldview that stressed self-improvement and admitting one’s sins, or maybe he was human enough to realize his many flaws.\n\nEither way you wouldn’t see historical leaders like Winston Churchill, who once said “I am prepared to meet my maker. Whether my maker is prepared for the ordeal of meeting me is another matter,” denigrate themselves as harshly as Chiang. Hitler wouldn’t have included “I should have listened more to Guderian and Manstein” in his last will and testament.\n\nBy contrast as Andrew J. Nathan noted:\n\nChiang exceeded his critics in beating up on himself. In his diary, which he kept from 1918 until he was incapacitated by a heart attack in 1972, he berated himself as “ruthless and tyrannical; irritable; conceited; stubborn; wicked; … extravagant; jealous; stingy; lascivious; arrogant; full of sorrow and indignation.” The key to his character was patient revenge—the ability to “endure great humiliation” and prevail. Of course, striking that posture before the world was a sure way to look like a loser.\n\nWhat If?:\n\nCould Chiang Kai-shek have consolidated his rule on the mainland and avoid being banished to Taiwan? Like most questions regarding alternate history it’s more fun debating this than being able to provide a satisfactory answer. It’s easy, with hindsight, to point out Chiang’s many mistakes and bad policies, but not so easy to suggest what he should have done otherwise. Given the many enemies, strained relations with other nations, and countless domestic problems Chiang faced, it’s hard to find ideal solutions to many of these issues.\n\nFor instance, attacking the CCP usually left him open to aggression by Chinese warlord and Japan, and vice versa. Focusing more on domestic issues like land reform, or challenging imperial interests in China, could have won over more Chinese but also alienate landlords, the western powers, and Japan. Serious attempts to reform the KMT would have made it better equipped to solve issues in the long-term, but risked internal conflict while his regime struggled to survive day by day against multiple enemies.\n\nDuring his reign on the mainland Chiang Kai-shek was like a man juggling too many balls (the Japanese, Chinese Warlords, CCP, America and Russia) in a violent windstorm (the many domestic ills facing China) while drunk (his own personal flaws). In this regard Chiang could be compared to a functioning alcoholic, who does better than expected in difficult circumstances, but whom we all know will fall flat on his face eventually.\n\nThat said, what could Chiang Kai-shek have theoretically done to prevent the fall of his regime on the mainland?\n\nHe failed to win over China’s peasants, partly due to relying on landlords as part of his power base, but mostly due to Mao’s superior ability at winning over and mobilizing the rural population. Perhaps better policies, and more efforts, could have helped in this area, but it was always going to be playing catch up with the CCP. Likewise, the corruption and misdeeds of his regime, which became worse after the Northern Expedition, and especially World War 2, did Chiang no favors. His personal honesty, and occasional chewing out of venal subordinates, did little to alleviate this.\n\nChiang was usually too focused on crushing the communists and other enemies, and assumed he could put off a severe overhaul of his regime until they were dealt with. In the end this compromised his regime from within, along with its chances against the CCP, and while he recognized this after fleeing to Taiwan, it was too late to save the mainland.\n\nHe also could have picked better officials and subordinates at many points, and refrain from micromanaging those who were competent. A better understanding of how media worked in democracies like America could have given Chiang Kai-shek a chance against Stilwell and western critics, who usually won the battle of the narrative. Although China during his reign was remarkably open, with much of the media critical of his regime, it never had real power to topple Chiang, or significantly change his policies. As such, his attitude towards public opinion mimicked Frederick the Great’s who once said, “the people say what they like and then I do what I like.”\n\n***\n\nRegarding major historical decisions there are two that could have proven decisive had Chiang Kai-shek chosen differently. After the Xi’an Incident he could have ignored the agreement to ally with the CCP, and launched an offensive in early 1937 to crush them. This would have displeased Russia, but given Stalin’s main priority of having China distract Japan from attacking Russia, and his consistently cynical policies towards China, it’s likely he would have supported China against Japan when war broke out in July 1937 anyway. But at this point Chiang decided not to exploit his best chance of eliminating the CCP, and this would doom his regime more than a decade later.\n\nThe second decision happened after World War 2, when Chiang Kai-shek decided to fight the CCP for the control of Manchuria (North East China). This was a rich region, in industry and resources, developed by Japan, and mostly untouched by the war. On paper it looked easy given Chiang’s superiority in soldiers, population, territory, and American aid. In reality his regime was broke, largely corrupt, and his army poorly motivated versus Mao’s forces. Realistically, Chiang could have held onto most of South and Central China, maybe even much of the North, but Manchuria was a region too far.\n\nThe CCP was established in Manchuria, and neighboring communist regimes in Russia and North Korea provided support for Mao’s forces. The sheer size of the region (as big as Western Europe), and its distance from Chiang’s power base in central China, suggests it was too ambitious for him to take and hold it.\n\nChiang Kai-shek’s American advisors were against it due to valid military and logistical reasons, and Chiang knew the risks, but he went ahead hoping his larger, better equipped army, could defeat the CCP and win the Civil War. Instead Manchuria became a death trap for his forces that became bogged down in the cities, at the end of tenuous lines of communication, and surrounded by Mao’s forces in the countryside. Chiang’s army won many battles in Manchuria but the CCP cut off its garrisons, and defeated them one by one. By the time the communists overran Manchuria Chiang’s best forces had been crushed, his regime discredited at home and abroad, and the rest of China would fall to Mao relatively easy.\n\nThus, fighting Mao over Manchuria was folly as Chiang could have held onto most of China, given the CCP’s relative weakness outside of the region. This would have given a rich, significant part of China to Mao, but like the situation with North and South Korea, and West and East Germany, Chiang’s part of China would have been geopolitically stronger in the long term. Had he stabilized his rule, and continued to get decent American aid, Chiang’s China would have outperformed Mao’s Manchurian rump state, that would have stagnated into irrelevance, as other communist regimes did. While much of this is speculation, it was more probable than winning a complete victory over the CCP after 1945.\n\nThe Jury is Out:\n\nThe question remains: Was Chiang Kai-shek a visionary leader who was overwhelmed by insurmountable odds, or to quote Rana Mitter, a “politically gifted but tragically flawed” dictator who couldn’t rise above survival mode and his shortcomings? The truth is a combination of both. Chiang’s vision regarding governance and society currently holds more currency in East Asia than the discredited ideals of Mao Zedong (outside of North Korea’s dystopia and Xi Jinping’s one-man rule in China).\n\nChiang Kai-shek’s accomplishments in China and Taiwan were not inconsequential and were impressive given the circumstances he faced. There’s no denying the bad luck, many enemies, and countess obstacles he faced.\n\nAs Paul H. Tai and Tai-chun Kuo noted: “Ruling China and Taiwan for nearly half of a century, from 1928-1975, in an era of unprecedented international and domestic upheavals, the man must have possessed a level of administrative-military competence to meet the exigencies of his days and must have substantial achievements to warrant the support of his millions of followers.”\n\nHowever, Chiang Kai-shek often put his loftier goals on hold, inevitably concentrated on the day to day survival of his regime, and muddled through one crisis after the other. Likewise, only Chiang, not his enemies or historical circumstances, can be held responsible for personal failings like micromanaging, tolerating widespread corruption, neglecting social and economic issues in China, and gambling in risky situations hoping a lucky break, or outside force, would see him through.\n\nSuch gambles paid off in the Northern Expedition, his scuffles with Chinese warlords, the first part of the Civil War with the CCP, and even the war with Japan. But everything came crashing down when he fought Mao over Manchuria. No Deus ex machina like American intervention, or Stalin restraining Mao, turned the tide in the last part of the Chinese Civil War.\n\nChiang’s reputation might be undergoing an overdue rehabilitation, and caricatures about him are easily exposed, but losing mainland China will always count against him. History rarely glorifies losers. It champions leaders who lost like Hannibal Barca, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Erwin Rommel, but not Chiang Kai-shek. Apparently losing China puts him in another category.\n\nWhatever one’s opinion on Chiang Kai-shek what can’t be denied is his historical significance. As Simon Whistler, after some very harsh words, said regarding Chiang’s legacy:\n\nWhat Chiang Kai-shek was though was significant. As the general who ended the warlord era, oversaw the Nanking decade, steered China through a Japanese invasion, and a civil war, then founded modern Taiwan, Chiang has an outsized impact on Eastern Asian history. Perhaps more so than anyone else.\n\nChiang’s Kai-shek’s critical role was also recognized throughout his career, even by rivals and enemies. It wasn’t Sun Yat-sen who launched the Northern Expedition, Wang Jingwei (Chiang’s KMT rival) who managed the Nanking Decade, or Mao Zedong who led the fight against Japan, or overturned the unequal treaties with western powers.\n\nTo prove a point Chiang Kai-shek occasionally resigned to show he was irreplaceable. When his enemies in the KMT tried outmaneuvering him in the Northern Expedition, and after the Mukden Incident, Chiang stepped down and watched others fail to govern, patiently waiting to be called upon. Stalin, who usually schemed against Chiang with the CCP, realized he was the only person who could lead China in a war against Japan; a reality Chinese warlords and Mao Zedong swallowed with bitterness. The Americans and British concluded the same despite reservations they had about him. Chiang realized these realities and in one of his less humble moments said “wherever I go is the Government itself. I am the State.”\n\nPerhaps it’s fair to end with some words by Chiang Kai-shek himself: “If when I die, I am still a dictator I will certainly go down into the oblivion of all dictators. If, on the other hand, I succeed in establishing a stable base for a democratic government, I will be remembered forever in every home in China.”\n\nChiang Kai-shek did die a dictator and his democratic credentials were dubious to say the least, but his efforts established the conditions that allowed Taiwan to become a prosperous, liberal democracy.\n\nAs China turns more oppressive and belligerent under Xi Jinping, and will become grey before it becomes rich; and given its model, a barren mix of political communism and rapacious capitalism, will prove unable to win over most of the globe compared to the imperfect, but adaptive system of liberal democracy; the CCP’s vision will eventually be consigned to the ash heap of history.\n\nWhatever the last word on Chiang Kai-shek will be, there’s every indication his model for China (based on Taiwan) will prevail in the end. That’s a bet Chiang would have taken.\n\nBibliography:\n\nBiographics, “Chiang Kai-shek: The General who Created Modern China,” YouTube Video, 25:15, November 6, 2020, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fu8YCCA0UTI\n\nBix, Herbert P.
