        "text": "Chiang Kai-shek's Former Residences at Fenghua consists of the Fenggao House, the Yutai Salt Shop and the Western-style House. Situated on the Middle Street, Xikou, Fenghua City\n\nThe Fenggao House was the birthplace of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Jing-guo. The structure of the house is typical traditional Chinese style with an antechamber, a back chamber, two wings and four verandas. In the front courtyard there are three gardens, connected with each other by moon-shaped gates. The east and the west wing-rooms were respectively the living rooms of Ms. Song and Mao Fumei (Mr. Chiang's first wife). The independent little house to the west of the west wing used to be the residence of Chiang' mother.\n\nAt the entrance to the Danqiang Lane on the Mid-street of Xikou, is the site where The Yutai Salt Shop was originally situated. The Shop was the property of Mr. Chiang's father and grandfather's as well as his birthplace. The Shop is a stone building. On the horizontal board were inscribed two Chinese characters \"qing lu\" (Quiet Cottage), and on the cornerstone at the front are the words: \"the original site of the Yutai Salt Shop, written by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek.\"\n\nThe Western-style House, a two-storey building, was built in 1930. Standing at the foot of the Wushan Mountain and facing the Shanxi River, the House is in the quiet and beautiful environment. Mr. Chiang Jing-guo lived here after his return from Soviet Union in 1937. In the house there is a stone tablet on which are four Chinese characters \"yi xue xi xue\" (blood for blood) written by Mr. Chiang Jing-guo, which show his bitter hatred for the Japanese enemies and his will to avenge his mother's death.ã\n\nThe Chiang Kai-shek's Former Residences at Fenghua is a national key unit for cultural relics preservation of the State Council of China."
