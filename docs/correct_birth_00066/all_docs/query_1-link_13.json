        "text": "Despite the restrictions of martial law, which lasted throughout Chiang’s reign, supporters note the period of economic prosperity Taiwan enjoyed under Chiang’s rule, rivalling other strong Asian economic powerhouses such as Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore. Taiwan also received generous amounts of aid from the United States and also initiated Land Reform without the struggle meetings and bloodshed instigated by the Communists on the mainland. In 1975, 26 years after his arrival in Taiwan, Chiang passed away at the age of 87.\n\nMuch like Mao Zedong, the historical legacy of Chiang Kai-shek continues to elicit a multitude of conflicting opinions and substantial controversy. For certain biographers, Chiang has been dubbed as the ‘man who lost China’ whereas others refer to him by his military title of ‘generalissimo.’ Jonathan Fenby aptly summarises many historical assessments of Chiang (2004:428) : ‘Either he was a faithful friend of the West who had been undone by Communist cunning, Western irresolution and treachery in the State Department; or he was a reactionary, cruel, incompetent dictator who was no better than the warlords, who betrayed the true interests of his nation by failing to stand up to the Japanese in time, and who perverted the sacred teachings of Sun Yat-sen.’ Fenby brings together these diametrically opposed perspectives. He believes Chiang’s failures hinged upon a lack of administrative and economic competence compounded by dubious military strategy. Further to this, Fenby notes Chiang was not meritocratic in his appointment of staff but favoured loyalty to the extent that he would turn a blind eye to corruption.\n\nHowever, Fenby redeems Chiang to a certain extent by noting that he managed to establish institutions that now comprise the bedrock of a modern state. Indeed, Chiang was the first to unite China as a nation after the fall of Qing. Moreover, Fenby states that Chiang engaged with many countries on the international stage, abolishing many foreign concessions. Although censorship existed, many cultural works critical of his own government were tolerated, sowing the seeds of democratic society, although this would never be fully realised under Chiang's rule. Fenby draws an interesting conclusion which hints that China simply wasn’t ready for Chiang, viewing his time in power as a ‘precursor to the post-Mao era’ where a certain amount of criticism was tolerated along with economic progress, modernisation and openness to the outside world. Fenby believes Chiang was hampered by ‘missed opportunities under a regime and a ruler who lacked the resources and strength to carry their mission to a conclusion’ (Fenby 2004:432:433). Ultimately, the rapport between external circumstances and one’s own liability are difficult entities to balance in assessing the case of Chiang. However, it is clear that his vision for a modern China was cut short by the designs of Japanese imperialism.\n\nIn Jay Taylor’s (2011) The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-Shek and the Struggle for Modern China, a resoundingly positive account of Chiang is presented. One of Taylor’s most astute contributions is his re-assessment of Chiang’s role in the Second Sino-Japanese war. Although Chiang delayed military engagement with the Japanese during the Nanjing decade, it was Nationalist and not Communist forces that were predominantly sacrificed in the midst of the conflict itself. Taylor affirms that by January 1940, the Chinese army suffered 1.3 million casualties with only 3% of this total belonging to Communist Party troops (2011: 169). Notwithstanding, Taylor attributes Chiang’s defeat in the Civil War to poor military strategy and ‘vast and incomprehensible optimism’ (2011: 364) whilst critiquing corruption within the Nationalist Party. Taylor condemns Chiang most of all for ‘the killings he ordered or permitted in 1947 in Taiwan and the extensive executions during the first few years after arrival on the island’ which aimed at suppressing Communism and cementing his dictatorial rule. Taylor concludes however that In Taiwan ‘Chiang had his chance at nation-building, and in terms of social and economic indices he laid the groundwork for Taiwan’s leap into modernity’ whilst asserting, like Fenby, that modern China has been shaped more by Chiang than by Mao, the Maoist notion of ‘class struggle’ now replaced with teaching traditional culture and Confucius.\n\nConversely, there are historians who have labelled Chiang a fascist and brutal dictator. Lloyd Eastman (1974:67) argued that Chiang’s ‘New Life Movement’ , a programme of social reform including curbing drinking, gambling smoking and even spitting, constituted a veiled attempt to ‘implant the fascist spirit amongst the Chinese people’ due to its association with the Blue Shirt Society who were modelled on principles of Italian fascist groups. Eastman notes that the idea of the ‘preservation of the nation’ and the ‘national interest’ (1972:3) were the Blue Shirt’s primary goals. Eastman cites one of Chiang’s secret speeches to the Blue Shirt Society, whose members had pledged allegiance to Chiang as a dictator where he commented: ‘fascism is a stimulant for a declining stagnant society.’ Eastman also notes a key principle of the Blue Shirts was a lack of individualism and the willingness to sacrifice oneself for the collective nation.\n\nIn this vein, Frederick Wakeman has dubbed Chiang a ‘Confucian fascist.’ Wakeman notes that whilst Chiang’s form of fascism was not the same as the scourge prevalent in Europe, he nevertheless supported a movement which combined ‘popular anti-foreignism and ethnic revivalism that characterised many modern movements in China, including the Red Guards.’ (1997:432) In short, Wakeman is suggesting that Chiang’s New Life Movement could have been a precursor to the Cultural Revolution. Wakeman also notes the secret nature of this society rather than the mass movements fascism incited in Germany and Italy. Indeed, the blue shirts were never openly characterised as fascist. In a European context, Fascism intended to indoctrinate the masses whilst perhaps Chiang simply wished to strengthen his grip on power and cement national unity after warlordism."
