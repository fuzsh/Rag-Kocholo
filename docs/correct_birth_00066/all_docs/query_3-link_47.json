        "meta_description": "By Hannah Pakula <p>In 1937 Life magazine claimed that Madame Chiang Kai-shek was &#8220;probably the most powerful woman in the world.&#8221; As the wife of the man who led China during the crucial years of World War II and the Chinese Civil War, she was certainly one of the most important women of the 20th century. Had it not been for her personal charm and her ability to bridge cultures, it is possible that China would not have joined the ranks of the great powers as early or as smoothly as it did. It was Madame Chiang who put an appealing face first on her nation, which was in danger of being overrun, and later on an anti-communist crusade which, according to some historians, succeeded all too well.</p><p>Early Life</p><p>Madame Chiang was born Soong May-ling in March 1897, the third daughter and fourth child of Charles Soong and Ni Kwei-tseng. The day on the lunar calendar corresponds to March 5, but since she celebrated on dates varying from March 6 to March 20, it is hard to specify the exact day. She was born in Shanghai into one of the very few Chinese families that believed in the education of women. Both of her older sisters attended college in the United States, and May-ling followed them at the age of 10, first to Macon, Ga., then on her own to WellesleyCollege in Massachusetts.</p><p>Becoming Madame Chiang Kai-shek</p><p>After graduating at the age of 20, she returned to Shanghai, where she added a traditional Chinese education in rote learning to her Western studies, thereby acquiring familiarity with the cultures of both East and West. Her determination to do something significant with her life was helped by <a href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50C16FD3F54177A93C0A91789D95F438285F9\">her marriage at the age of 30 to Chiang Kai-shek</a>. From Chiang&#8217;s point of view their union gave him ready access to money and prestige, as the Soongs were considered one of the most important families in the country.</p><p>May-ling started her career in public life by <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1937.html\">helping Chiang</a>, a military man who had set out to overcome the warlords currently running China, by locating food and medicine for his soldiers. Once he had managed to unite his people under a single authority &#8211; or as much as this was possible in such a huge and diverse country &#8211; Madame helped him establish a new capital at Nanking. When their new nation was forcibly plunged into war, she became his adviser on foreign affairs, his translator and his window into the Western world, which he did not understand.</p> <p>The Voice of China</p><p>During the previous century the Western powers &#8211; Britain, France and the United States primarily &#8211; had established so-called treaty ports, Chinese cities on the sea run according to their own laws, which they used for industrial ventures, importing opium and exporting tea, fine silks and china to the West. The initial warlike incursions in the 20th century, however, came from Japan, whose military men had determined to take over their neighbor&#8217;s vast lands and natural resources. By the time Japan joined Hitler&#8217;s Germany and Mussolini&#8217;s Italy in the war against the Allies, Madame Chiang had become the major voice of China, crying out to the United States for help in the fight. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which drew the U.S. into World War II, illustrated the urgency of her message, which had previously fallen on deaf ears.</p><p>Pearl Harbor was followed by Lend-Lease, President Roosevelt&#8217;s solution to the problem of supporting his allies with munitions and money, and in 1942 Madame Chiang flew to the United States to make sure that China received its share. Her initial appearance in Washington captured the nation&#8217;s imagination and substantial amounts of its treasure. Only the second woman to address the U.S. Congress, she was too smart to beg for money or armaments, but &#8211; slight, beautifully built and dramatically gowned - she allowed the big, brave gentlemen who ran the country to contribute to her rightful cause. According to the official book of her visit, &#8220;a veritable storm of cheering and handclapping&#8221; followed her address to the House of Representatives, and one congressman even admitted that Madame Chiang &#8220;had me on the verge of bursting into tears.&#8221; It was a brilliant performance, followed by a series of similar speeches delivered before enthralled audiences in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p><p>Madame Chiang&#8217;s personal conduct, however, did not always have the same effect as her public appearances. As a guest in the White House, she upset the Roosevelts and their staff by clapping her hands twice loudly to summon the servants &#8211; a carry-over from calling the servants in Shanghai. Eleanor Roosevelt explained the problem by noting that their guest could &#8220;talk beautifully about democracy, but she does not know how to live democracy.&#8221; The president, who had been warned about her charm, made sure to keep her at a safe distance in meetings. Upset with the autocratic way she dealt with the press, he tried to get her to go home before her actions ruined his plans to continue to support the Chinese in the ongoing war.</p><p>The Cairo Summit</p><p>After eight months in the states, Madame Chiang returned to China, and she accompanied her husband in November of 1943 to Cairo for his first summit meeting with Roosevelt and Churchill. Madame insisted on being present at all meetings attended by Chiang in order to translate what he said -- a situation which, according to Churchill&#8217;s principal military adviser, left the English &#8220;wondering whether we were dealing with Chiang or with Madame.&#8221; But Madame Chiang was worried about her husband&#8217;s lack of modern education and the limitations of his mind. She wore a typical Chinese dress slit up the sides to these meetings, and when he was speaking, she is said to have constantly crossed and recrossed her shapely legs in an attempt to divert the diplomats&#8217; attention from his pathetic performances.</p><p>While the Chiangs were in Egypt, there were two attempts on the part of the Chinese at home to unseat him, both of which failed. Moreover, the American general who had accompanied them to the summit, Joseph Stillwell, returned with an order from on high to develop an assassination plan (never carried out) in case the allies needed to get Chiang out of the picture.</p><p>Civil War and Exile</p><p>Shortly after the end of World War II, China entered into a civil war between Chiang&#8217;s party, the Kuomintang, and the Communists. It was won by the Communists, primarily because the Chinese were disgusted with the rampant corruption of the government in power. The war ended with Chiang&#8217;s exile in December 1949 to the island of Taiwan, where Madame joined him.</p><p>The next quarter of a century was a quiet time in the Chiang household, punctuated by Madame&#8217;s trips back to the United States in search of help for a congenital skin disease and an opportunity to piggyback the return of Chiang&#8217;s republican army to the mainland onto the American forces involved in the Korean and Vietnamese Wars. But none of the American presidents following Roosevelt &#8211; particularly Truman, who disliked the Chiangs intensely - was willing to support Taiwan in such a venture. Chiang died in 1975, and his instructions for eventual burial on the mainland remain unfulfilled.</p><p>Meanwhile, Madame attended to her good works &#8211; primarily orphanages and support for Taiwanese soldiers &#8211; and applied herself to painting, a talent she had discovered in her later life. After her husband&#8217;s death, she made her home in New York, returning occasionally to Taiwan, where she tried unsuccessfully to steer island politics to the right. She herself <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/24/world/madame-chiang-105-chinese-leader-s-widow-dies.html\">died in 2003 </a>at the age of 106.</p>",
