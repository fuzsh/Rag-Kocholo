        "text": "The Celebration of Joe Prather’s life was held on May 10. 2024 at the Calvary Episcopal Church, followed by a luncheon at The Beacon Hill Club, both in Summit, NJ.\n\nBack row: Jim Wickenden, George Brakeley, Ken Lomas, Jim Blair, Jon Hlafter, Joe McGinity\n\nFront row: Lorraine Menna, Ev Prather, Carol Wojie\n\nOthers in attendance: Frank Novak, Lee Blyler, Ted & Carol Newlin, Bob Pickens, Martha Wickenden, Pat Hlafter, Maureen McGinity, Sue Blair, and Tamara Brakeley.\n\nAlso, Mike & Gerri Horn attended the church service.\n\nBrakeley's Remarks\n\nThe University has an event every February called Alumni Day, and there’s a huge luncheon for maybe 1,500 people at which an award called the Madison Prize is given to some outstanding undergraduate degree holder. About four years ago the awardee was Meloddy Hodson, class of 1991, who has had a remarkable history in the business world. In her thank-you remarks she said that her new husband had attended his first Princeton reunion a few years earlier, after which he said to her, “This isn’t a college – it’s a cult”, which, of course, got a big laugh. But, she went on, “Let me remind you my husband is George Lucas, who created Star Wars, and thinks we are a cult!”. Indeed, we are a cult, and the cult is reinforced by the individual cults of the 83 living Princeton classes, including our own. It’s one of the phenomena of being a Princeton alumnus.\n\nAnother phenomenon is how, if you set one foot on the campus freshman year, you are an alumnus, ever and for always, even if you don’t graduate. Which was Joe’s case – he left early to get married, but his commitment to our University and our class never wavered.\n\nIn my capacity as class secretary and Len Berton’s as our webmaster, you might say we two are the voice of the class, but, as I wrote in Joe’s PAW memorial, “Joe was the heart and soul of our class\", serving in so many ways for virtually his entire adult life.\n\nOver the years he served as our president, two different terms as vice president, and Reunions chairman. When I was president of the class he was my reunion chairman, and when he was the president, I was his class secretary. Sort of a tag team thing.\n\nIn all these years he missed only three reunions – the 1st, 4th and 5th. Since then, a perfect record, plus every class event and mini-reunion. He was always there.\n\nHe organized any number of class dinners on Friday evenings of our off-year reunions, as well as receptions for families of deceased classmates after the Service of Remembrance on Alumni Day. And for the last ten years or so, he and Ev attended the memorial service of every classmate in the region.\n\nHe had the vision to create the Class of 1961 Foundation, was its first Board president, and launched our participation in Teach for America. The Foundation also created our Caring Committee, which looks after classmates in need and sponsors colloquia on topics relevant to the fact that we are in our eighties.\n\nAnd he represented the class in innumerable other ways, working with the Alumni Office and other University offices on class business. He was our “go-to” guy for just about everything. And he served the University over and above our class. He was Chairman of the Alumni Council’s Committee on Reunions for several years. And he was Grand Marshal of the P-rade for seven years. Who will ever forget him in his wonderful DaVinci hat!\n\nMy fondest memory of Joe will be his appearance. Yesterday my wife observed, “Joe had SWAG.” In his Bernardsville News obituary, his son Tony wrote of his “stylish attire and neat appearance.” He was always dressed to the nines – the perfectly knotted tie, never a single hair out of place, always dapper and totally unruffled, even in hot weather.\n\nAnd then there’s the legacy Joe has left us in the presence of Evvie, who was at his elbow on every occasion, and, in recent years, represented him so well when he had such difficulties communicating. We are so lucky that she is staying on as our Reunion Chair and as a Director of the Foundation, and will long remain a part of the life of the class. Not for nothing was she made an Honorary Member of the Class of 1961 some years ago!\n\n- Lead Singing of Old Nassau\n\n- Lead a locomotive cheer for Joe\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA mournful Taps was rendered by Ken Lomas."
