        "text": "RETIRED\n\nJoin Date: Jul 1999\n\nLocation: BOULDER Colorado\n\nPosts: 39,417\n\nGirls Aloud singer Sarah Harding passed away early Sunday morning after losing her battle with breast cancer. She was just 39 years old.\n\nHarding’s mom, Marie, shared the sad news of her death on Instagram.\n\n\"It’s with deep heartbreak that today I’m sharing the news that my beautiful daughter Sarah has sadly passed away,\" Marie wrote to over 360,000 of Harding’s fans on Instagram. \"Many of you will know of Sarah’s battle with cancer and that she fought so strongly from her diagnosis until her last day. She slipped away peacefully this morning.\"\n\n\"It meant the world to Sarah and it gave her great strength and comfort to know she was loved,\" Marie continued. \"I know she won’t want to be remembered for her fight against this terrible disease — she was a bright shining star and I hope that’s how she can be remembered instead.\"\n\nHarding released a memoir titled \"Hear Me Out\" four months before passing. In the book the singer revealed that there was one symptom of her breast cancer that she completely dismissed — pain.\n\n\"At first I thought it was just a cyst. I’d been playing my guitar a lot, and I thought the strap had probably irritated an area around my breast,\" she wrote, adding that the pain got increasingly worse over time.\n\n\"It got so bad that I couldn’t sleep in a bed anymore. I slept on the sofa, popping painkillers like they were Smarties,\" Harding revealed. \"I really overdid it, but the pain was overwhelming.

He was 72 years old.\n\nHis passing was both confirmed by current Black Oak Arkansas member Sammy Seauphine and Reynolds daughter Amber Lee.\n\n\"Its with a heavy heart we are [informing] all of you Rickie Lee Reynolds has passed away this morning. We ask right now to give us all privacy while we remember a brother,\" Seauphine wrote.\n\nAccording a statements posted to Facebook by Lee, Reynolds was suffering from kidney failure and cardiac arrest, complications due to hospitalization from COVID-19.\n\nThis morning he suffered another cardiac arrest, which they were unable to resuscitate him from. We are all heartbroken by this massive loss, and the whole world feels colder and more empty without his presence among us,\" Lee wrote. \"All of my love goes out to those who feel this overwhelming loss right now, just as I do. Please take heart in knowing he loves all of us, as much as we love him. And he felt that love every day in the center of his big ole heart. He will continue to feel that love, forever. Just as we will never forget the love he bestowed upon us.\"\n\nReynolds originally founded the band in 1963, then named \"The Knowbody Else\" with vocalist Ronnie Smith, guitarists Stanley Knight and Harvey Jett, bassist Pat Daugherty and drummer Wayne Evans. After some time, the band agreed Smith would better serve as the bands stage production manager and had mutual friend James \"Jim Dandy\" Mangrum enter as their frontman.\n\nThe group changed their name to their hometown after signing to Atco Records in 1970.\n\nBlack Oak Arkansas channeled a sound influenced by their experiences with psychedelia, Eastern spiritualism and their Southern Baptist upbringing blending the genres of country, blues, rock and gospel. The Southern rock band achieved commercial success in the 70s with three gold-certified albums. They are best known for singles \"Up,\" \"Gigolo\" and \"When Electricity Came To Arkansas.\"\n\n__________________\n\n1983/3.6, backdate to long hood\n\n2012 ML350 3.0 Turbo Diesel\n\nRETIRED\n\nJoin Date: Jul 1999\n\nLocation: BOULDER Colorado\n\nPosts: 39,417\n\nJean-Pierre Adams, an ex-footballer who fell into a coma in 1982 following a botched knee operation, has died at the age of 73, his former clubs Nimes Olympique, Paris Saint-Germain and Nice said.\n\nAdams, an imposing central defender, started his career in Fontainebleu, where he helped the local side win its amateur championship, before moving to Nimes to sign for the city's then first division side.\n\nWithin two years, not only had Nimes finished runners-up but Adams was playing for France -- one of the first Black players to do so.\n\nWith the national team, Adams formed a central defensive partnership known as the \"Garde Noire\" -- \"Black Guard\" -- alongside Marius Trésor.\n\n\"We learned this morning of the passing of Jean-Pierre Adams,\" Nimes wrote on Twitter. \"He had worn the colors of Nimes Olympique 84 times and with Marius Trésor made up 'the black guard' of the French team.\n\n\"The club offers its most sincere condolences to his loved ones and his family.\"\n\nAdams, who was born in Senegal, went on to play for nine consecutive seasons in France's top division, also representing Nice and Paris Saint-Germain while amassing 22 caps for the French national team.\n\n\"Nice was heartbroken to learn of the passing of Jean-Pierre Adams, who fell into a coma on March 17, 1982,\" Nice wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"The former defender wore the colors of the Gym 145 times from 1973 to 1977. OGC Nice stands with the pain of his relatives who have looked after him for 39 years.\"\n\nNice says a tribute will be paid to Adams at their home match against Monaco on September 19.\n\nOn Wednesday March 17, 1982, Adams went into hospital for a routine operation on a damaged tendon in his knee. When the date came around, the hospital staff were on strike.\n\n\"The female anesthetist was looking after eight patients, one after the other, like an assembly line,\" his wife Bernadette, who cared for Adams at their home throughout his coma, told CNN back in 2016.\n\n\"Jean-Pierre was supervised by a trainee, who was repeating a year, who later admitted in court: 'I was not up to the task I was entrusted with.'\n\n\"Given it was not a vital operation, that the hospital was on strike, they were missing doctors and this woman was looking after eight patients, in two different rooms, someone should have called me to say they were going to delay the operation.\"\n\nThey never did -- and between the anesthetist and trainee, numerous errors were made.\n\nAdams was badly intubated, with one tube blocking the pathway to his lungs rather than ventilating them, meaning he was starved of oxygen whereupon he suffered a cardiac arrest.\n\n\"PSG has lost, this Monday 6 September, one of its glorious elders,\" PSG wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"Defender of the Red and Blue and the French team, Jean-Pierre Adams wore the Parisian colors from 1977 to 1979. The Club offers its condolences to his family and loved ones.\"\n\n__________________\n\n1983/3.6, backdate to long hood\n\n2012 ML350 3.0 Turbo Diesel\n\nRETIRED\n\nJoin Date: Jul 1999\n\nLocation: BOULDER Colorado\n\nPosts: 39,417\n\nArt Metrano, a stand-up comedian best known for playing callous police captain Ernie Mauser in the second and third \"Police Academy\" films, has passed away. He was 84.\n\nThe Brooklyn-born funnyman died of natural causes at his Aventura, Florida home on Wednesday, his son told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nIn addition to his roles in the 1985 and 1986 installments of the comedic cop series, Metrano also appeared in the 1982 \"Happy Days\" spinoff \"Joanie Loves Chachi\" and guest-starred on \"All in the Family,\" \"Bewitched,\" \"Starsky and Hutch\" and \"Mod Squad,\" among other TV shows.\n\nA Bensonhurst native, Metrano began his career studying acting with Stella Adler and John Cassavetes and doing stand-up in the Catskills, according to THR. His big break came when a producer for \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" invited him onto the show in 1970 after seeing his mock magic act \"The Amazing Metrano\" on a late-night California variety show.\n\nActor Art Metrano passed away at the age of 64. He died from natural causes.\n\nCarson was so delighted by Metranos performance on his show that he fell out of his chair with laughter and began opening doors for the curly-haired Brooklynite.\n\n\"He really loved it and became a big fan of mine,\" Metrano said in a 2015 interview. \"All of a sudden I was doing all these shows. It was just amazing.\"\n\nThen, at the height of his success in 1989, while working on the roof of his Los Angeles home, he fell off a ladder and fractured three vertebrae, rendering him a quadriplegic.\n\n\"He was at the peak of his career when that happened, and then it just stopped,\" his son told THR. \"But he managed to enjoy life and overcome adversity.\"\n\nHe eventually even turned his trauma into a one-man play called \"Metranos Accidental Comedy,\" which he performed from a motorized wheelchair.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, four children and both grand- and great-grandchildren.\n\n\"Art would want all of his friends and family to continue to smile when they think of him and to laugh and continue on celebrating life,\" his family said.\n\n__________________\n\n1983/3.6, backdate to long hood\n\n2012 ML350 3.0 Turbo Diesel"
