        "text": "announcement AACC’s Jerry Goldsmith retires AACC is extremely proud of this Annual Meeting and <strong>Clinical</strong> Lab Expo, and Jerry Goldsmith paved the way <strong>for</strong> its success. For 17 years, he has been a primary <strong>for</strong>ce behind the growth of this event, working with both the Annual Meeting Organizing Committees and Scherago International. Although he officially retired in April, Goldsmith is here this week, not only chairing a symposium, but also saying farewell to his many friends and colleagues. Goldsmith was no stranger to the AACC Annual Meeting when he joined the association in 1991. He attended his first AACC meeting in 1970 in Buffalo, N.Y. Back then, the meeting was a summertime gathering of scientists who worked in clinical labs and a handful of diagnostic manufacturers. Today, much to Goldsmith’s credit, this annual event attracts nearly 20,000 people and close to 700 exhibitors. Over his career, Goldsmith was active in many facets of the diagnostics industry. He spent the early part of his career at Dow Corning, where, among other things, he was involved with the LARC, the first automated differential cell counter. A founding member of the Biomedical Marketing <strong>Association</strong>, now DxMA, Goldsmith built relationships that benefitted the entire IVD industry. In recognition of his contributions, the association created the Jerry Goldsmith Award <strong>for</strong> Excellence, which is presented annually to an individual in IVD marketing. Under Goldsmith’s leadership, AACC created a special program <strong>for</strong> financial analysts during the Annual meeting, enhanced international business <strong>for</strong> exhibitors through the International Buyers Program of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and expanded international participation in the Annual Meeting and Expo. He also championed many initiatives within AACC that help expand the reach of the clinical lab, most notably in the areas of molecular diagnostics, pharmacogenomics, and personalized medicine. “I first met Jerry in 1990 at HIMA, where he worked in public affairs <strong>for</strong> the medical technology industry,” noted Richard Flaherty, AACC Executive Vice President. “When I came to AACC, I interviewed others, but it was hard to beat Jerry’s unique knowledge and experience. More importantly, it was hard to beat his infectious enthusiasm <strong>for</strong> the science and the laboratory field.” Goldsmith plans to remain active in the field of laboratory medicine, doing consulting work. He and his wife, Sharon, travel extensively and hope to spend more time at their Delaware and Maine homes. T h e W e D n e s D ay Co n v e n T i o n Da i Ly <strong>Clinical</strong> <strong>Laboratory</strong> <strong>News</strong> CPOCT Division Launches Certificate Program Courses Aim to Provide Useful Skills By DeBorah Levenson Given the dramatic increase in near patient testing, the role of the POC specialist in ensuring quality management of testing outside the laboratory is increasingly critical to patient care. But too often, POC coordinators assume their responsibilities without <strong>for</strong>mal training, contact with others doing similar jobs, and the respect of their peers outside of the lab. A new certificate program—to be announced at tomorrow’s POC Forum—aims to change that situation. Beginning this fall, the AACC’s Critical and Point of Care Testing Division will offer a comprehensive curriculum composed of eight online courses—complete with reading assignments and quizzes—taught by accomplished and respected faculty. While POC coordinators may take single courses <strong>for</strong> continuing education credit, the full certificate requires successful completion of all eight courses and passage of a comprehensive exam after they have been completed, according to Marcy Anderson, MS, MT, ASCP, who along with Barbara Goldsmith, PhD, is chairing the certificate program. Anderson is Senior <strong>Clinical</strong> Specialist at Medical Automation Systems in Charlottesville, Va. Goldsmith is AACC President Elect and Vice President of <strong>Laboratory</strong> Services at Caritas Christi Health Care, and Director of <strong>Laboratory</strong> Services at EXCELL <strong>Clinical</strong> Laboratories/St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Boston. See poc certificate, continued on page 8 AACC Collection Preserves History of Lab Instruments Devices Show How Technology Has Shaped Blood Analysis By PhiL KiBaK Today’s clinical labs are home to an array of highly developed analyzers capable of per<strong>for</strong>ming thousands of tests per day. A trip through this year’s <strong>Clinical</strong> Lab Expo, the largest exposition in the world <strong>for</strong> clinical laboratory products, reveals just how advanced these analytical instruments have become. While the lab instruments of the past were not sophisticated by today’s standards, they were advanced <strong>for</strong> their time and represent a history of innovation that AACC is preserving in its national headquarters here in Washington, D.C. Over the past few years, AACC has added some very special historic lab instruments to its collection. Those who have had a chance to see these treasures often find themselves reminiscing about what labs were like back in the days when tests were often quite involved and results couldn’t be produced in minutes. Remembering the Past “As the quote goes, those who do not remember the past are bound to repeat it,” remarked Amadeo Pesce, PhD, Professor Emeritus at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Chair of AACC’s History of <strong>Clinical</strong> Chemistry Division. “A sense of history is one thing that alerts us to errors that have been made in the past. These older devices help us to understand the great strides we’ve made as a profession and how we have contributed to the delivery of better and more rapid patient care.” He cited the Technicon Autoanalyzer, on loan to the AACC collection from the Astoria-Pacific Museum. Invented in 1957 by Leonard Skeggs, PhD, and commercialized by Jack Whitehead’s Technicon Corporation, it See aacc Museum, continued on page 47 The auThoriTaTive source <strong>for</strong> The clinical laboraTorian july 30, 2008 special ediTion www.aacc.org in This issue 3 6 8 8 16 20 46 46 Plenary Speakers: Bloom, Jorde AACC 2008 Slate of Candidates NACB Honors New Academy Fellows Free Flyers Promote Quality in POCT AACC Divisions Awards 2008 New Product Review International and SYCL Travel Grant Winners ABCC New Diplomates"
