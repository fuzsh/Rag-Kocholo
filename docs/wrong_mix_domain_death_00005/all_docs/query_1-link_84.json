        "text": "On Fridays, we feature five food finds selected by local chefs and personalities. Below is a list of all of the finds to date.\n\nTravis Burgess\n\nTravis Burgess of Crush Pad, Luce, Bizou, and The Space. Burgess’s picks:\n\n1) English Muffins from Cou Cou Rachou. “This is actually the best thing in Charlottesville. So light and fluffy, perfectly buttery and acidic. I stop by weekly to pick these up for the restaurants. The highlight of my week is seeing how many of these I can eat in the car during the three minute drive back to work. Cou Cou is the perfect vibe. Step in and you quickly forget you are on Preston Ave. A slice of Paris right here in Charlottesville with the friendliest staff in town. Pro tip: grab a 6 pack to go, freeze what you don’t eat instantly, and wake up on a weekend morning and make your significant other the best and easiest breakfast egg sandwich in town.”\n\n2) Cabeza Quesadilla from Tacos Gomez. “Worked my way through the Tacos Gomez menu before realizing this. Quesadillas are the move here. And I get it that cabeza can be a little intimidating for us gringos, but these beef cheek quesadillas are incredible. Still can’t figure out what kind of cheese they use but you’ll get some iconic cheese pulls and the meat is so tender. Red sauce is a little too spicy for me. Extra green sauce always. Tortillas are made fresh right there. It is no wonder that the parking lot always has a line in it.”\n\n3) Kouign Amann at Crush Pad Wines “V needs a shoutout here. A true culinary genius – like actually a genius – and the best mentor, godfather, and friend I could ask for. His kouign amann is the best thing he makes. It disappeared after Covid but rumor has it it is on the dessert menu at Crush Pad. Flaky, buttery, caramel croissant dough perfection. But be aware, it is dangerous. Took an extra home last week to surprise the wife and bake off at home. I ended up eating 80% of it. Apparently it’s just like they make in Brittany, but I wouldn’t know because I am still waiting on him to go on our boys’ trip to Brittany.”\n\n4) Porchetta Sandwich from Petite Mariebette. “The other porchetta sandwich in this town. This one deserves some love too. They mix it up every year (currently, Porchella), and it is typically only on the menu for a few months, so get it while you can. It’s the best sandwich they make. Fresh ciabatta soaks up all the porchetta drippings, so much melty gruyere holding the broccoli rabe and everything all together. Just the right amount of pickled veg. The kind of sandwich you finish and immediately crave another. Treat yourself and splurge on a caramel latte while you are at it.”\n\n5) Double Bacon Cheeseburger at the Riverside Lunch bar by myself without my wife. “I can’t be the only one with this routine. But apparently some consider Riverside not to be light and healthy, so we can’t eat there. This one is a real treat for me. Some Sundays when she double books yoga classes around lunch time, I’ll sneak up the street. Double bacon cheeseburger, lettuce, grilled onion, mayo, a side of fries and a cola. Sitting at the bar, NASCAR on one TV, NFL on the other. If you see me there alone at the bar don’t worry. I’m in my happy place.”\n\nSusan Jackiewicz\n\nJackiewicz’s picks:\n\n1) Baguettes from Albemarle Baking Company. “The importance of bread in our life together is right up there with oxygen and dogs, and the baguettes from Gerry Newman at ABC were essential elements of our Friday night ‘dinners.’ Often, not just on Fridays, we would stop at Feast!, pick up cheese, salami, pate and some Crose from King Family Vineyards, and have a simple ‘country picnic’ in the living room, or make the trip to King Family here in Crozet.”\n\n2) Cheeseburger at Jack Brown’s. “In March 2023, Susan, a lover of cooking shows and competitions, decided we needed to have our own Charlottesville competition, and she chose the cheeseburger. In the past we’ve done ‘tour de baguette’ while we were in France, ‘tour de Gelato’ in Italy, and even a ‘tour de cannoli’ when we lived in Boston, but here it was with the cheeseburger. Before Susan passed, we ate fourteen different burgers and judged them on ten different categories. We each ate the same exact burger combo each time, to be fair. Although we didn’t manage to get to every place on our list, Jack Brown’s was by far the best burger we had in town, and sitting there at the bar will be a great memory for me.”\n\n3) Lobster Roll at the bar at Public Fish & Oyster. “We are New Englanders through and through, and when we found out that Public had lobster rolls at the bar during happy hour, we were sold. With John, another New Englander, behind the bar, and always ready with a Kir Royale for Susan, we were happy campers. Just don’t try and convince us there is any other way to eat a lobster roll other than the way they do in Maine.”\n\n4) Polpettine Al Forno at Lampo. “It goes without saying that Lampo is one of the best places in town for just about anything they have on the menu. But the combination of beef and pork meatballs is out of this world. You get six meatballs per order, but one order was never enough for the two of us, and we would often order an extra one to-go, because they were that good.”\n\n5) Farm to Batteau with James River Batteau and Two Fire Table. “This is the outlier on the list because not many people have experienced this yet, but 2024 is going to be the year that this experience blows up, I assure you. Last October, just two months before Susan passed, we had the good fortune to spend an evening on the James River and eat the delicious food prepared by Sarah Rennie of Two Fire Table. Cooked over an open fire, as you float on a Batteau, the locally sourced sausages and fish were amazing, and the atmosphere as the sun set put the experience over the top.”\n\nRachel Gendreau\n\nRachel Gendreau, of Crush Pad, Luce, and Bizou. Gendreau’s picks:\n\n1) Skip Burger at Blue Moon Diner. “Somehow both tragically hip yet endlessly welcoming, everything about the Blue Moon vibe is immaculate, and Laura is truly the coolest. I’ve been coming religiously for the Skip Burger since I was in college, a slightly runny egg, perfectly medium rare patty, crisp LTO, bacon, melty cheddar, side of fries (dipped in mayo, because I’m a monster), and invariably accompanied by a bottle of the house bubbles to share. THE breakfast burger to cure anything that ails ya.”\n\n2) Boat Noodles at Thai Cuisine & Noodle House. “Thai Cuisine is my go-to Thai spot for sure, and while Jay and his crew always deliver exceptional pho and curries, I’m a Boat Noodle girl for life. Something about that dark, rich broth and the chew of the noodles, tons of cilantro and scallions, bulked up with an extra portion of Gai Lai. Oh baby.”\n\n3) Celery Salad at Birdhouse. “I am lucky to live in a killer food neighborhood, and having this gem within walking distance is a beautiful and dangerous thing. Liz’s expertly curated low-intervention wine list is a major draw, as is the achingly perfect chicken and sides the kitchen turns out, but nothing has my heart quite like the celery salad – a light, refreshing, texturally perfect foil to all of the schmaltzy goodness on the table.”\n\n4) French Onion Croissant at Cou Cou Rachou. “Another neighborhood delight, and one with which I share a name. My daughters and I allow ourselves carte blanche and always leave much poorer, but with a box full of sweet and savory masterpieces. We are fond of the quiche-lets, the caneles, the sourdough, the giant cookies, and whatever mousse is in the fridge upon arrival, but the French Onion Croissant rocks our world every single time. Get two, trust us.”\n\n5) Lobster Roll and Oysters at Public Fish & Oyster. “Nobody does happy hour quite like Public – snag a couple of early barstools, and let John make you a pristine Negroni. Order a dozen dealer’s choice bivalves, always expertly shucked, and work your way through them while waiting for a generously portioned lobster roll (Maine-style or bust, fight me). Add a glass of sharp, saline Muscadet, and you’ll probably hear me purring from West Main Street.”\n\nLora Henderson Smith\n\nLora Henderson Smith, reader. Smith’s picks:\n\n1) Hibachi Combination Chicken and Shrimp from Kabuto. “Bonus points for the super reasonably priced lunch special.”\n\n2) Kao Pad Ka Pow with Chicken from Monsoon Siam. “It’s not on their menu any more, but occasionally they’ll still make it. I can always get it at Pineapples.”\n\n3) Shrimp Casserole Platter from Sultan Kebab. “My husband first introduced me to this dish. Our household loves it.”\n\n4) Hands On Breakfast with Chicken from Guajiros. “The cilantro aioli is to die for. I think this is currently my favorite meal in Charlottesville.”\n\n5) “Burfday Muun Rox” Cake Tin from Caked Up Cville. “Because, just one cupcake isn’t enough, but a dozen is too much for my family of 3. The cake tins are perfect.”\n\nLisa Richey\n\nEx-wife of the late Wilson Richey. Richey’s picks:\n\n1) Gulf Coast Salad as a Wrap from Revolutionary Soup (owned by Will Richey). “Look, I want to eat healthy, but eating a salad with a plastic fork is a bummer. The combo of shrimp, hard-boiled eggs and avocado makes this my healthy go-to lunch, and putting it all in a wrap makes it easier to eat at my desk. And yes, I do frequently order the Lisa Quesadilla. I’m a sucker for anything with goat cheese.”\n\n2) Fried Chicken and Collards at The Whiskey Jar (owned by WIll Richey). “Sure, I love the BBQ Nachos, and The Jar Salad, but if I’m craving something from The Jar, it’s fried chicken with the honey jalapeno dipping sauce. The collards remind me of how we used to eat when we lived on the farm, but now I don’t have to actually harvest anything which somehow makes this recipe taste even better. I also adore the Creamed Spinach and Sweet Potato Dumplings. I also think The Jar is the best place for a business lunch with out-of-towners – you can get French or fusion in most cities, but the client who seems shocked at how small CHO is definitely needs the full Southern experience, sweet tea encouraged. (And yes, I am from NJ.)”\n\n3) Dealer’s Choice at The Alley Light (founded and formerly owned by Will Richey). “I think this place has the best ambience of any restaurant in town. Robin and Chris continue to make The Alley Light shine, so much so that it’s hard to pick just one dish. However, I always start with the Anchovy Toast, as it is the perfect way to set your palate for everything that’s to come. Then I order whatever carpaccio is on the specials board, followed by something braised. Micah and team make magic at the bar. Their attention to detail, down to the glassware, is evident and joyful. I usually request some sort of high ball with a gin base, and I love how the bar incorporates local fruits and herbs.”\n\n4) Wine List at Cafe Frank (owned by Will Richey). “The great irony that Will’s first sit-down restaurant (The Jar) sells basically no wine wasn’t lost on us. Cafe Frank is the bistro I always assumed he’d want to run. It’s a great spot to go for happy hour and order an assortment of snacks while splitting a bottle of wine with that friend you’ve been meaning to make plans with for months. Also, the Mushroom Fritters go perfectly with a bottle of Burgundy.”\n\n5) Classic Burger at Högwaller Brewing (owned by Will Richey). “I live right down the street from Högwaller, which may buy my future cardiologist a beach house someday. But until then, my idea of a perfect weekend day is a sauna at Rivanna River Company, followed by a Classic Burger and a Rives Street Lager. It’s just a burger, sure, but it’s the platonic form of a burger. And I love a beer that is both delicious but also low enough ABV that I don’t need to take a nap later. Mark makes awesome beer, and it has been a blast checking out the new taps each Thursday and chitchatting with folks around the firepit.”\n\n“Wait, Other People Are Crazy Enough to Own Restaurants?!”\n\n1) Banh Mi at Vu Noodles. “This may be the official sandwich of Apex Clean Energy employees. This is the only tofu I have ever craved and I probably eat this once a week.”\n\n2) Clam Pizza at Lampo. “If I had a bat signal, it would be checking Instagram to see if this pizza is on special. When I was little, my grandfather made me linguine with clams for any special occasion, so you could say this flavor profile is my Ratatouille moment. Tavola’s linguini con vongole also makes me feel like I’m back home.”\n\n3) Omakase at Ten. “Let the chef choose the fish, and feel like you’ve been transported out of Charlottesville to a city large enough to have a subway. Don’t sleep on the seaweed salad. I’m also a fan of the harami miso.”\n\n4) Lobster Roll (Connecticut Style) at Public Fish & Oyster. “My oldest friend in town and I frequent this happy hour, splitting a lobster roll and a dozen oysters. She gets a Negroni and I go with a Negroni Sbagliato. The french fries that come with the lobster roll are ideal with the oysters, especially if you get a side of horseradish.”\n\n5) Shaved Salad at Oakhart Social. “Few salads are craveable. This one clears that hurdle easily, and it’s usually the reason I end up at Oakhart. Also, their tuna crudo is fantastic.”\n\nSylvia Chong\n\nSylvia Chong, co-chair of VeryAsian VA. Chong’s picks:\n\n1) Isan Sausages with Sticky Rice and Isan-style Papaya Salad at Chimm. “I was first drawn to Chimm by its amazing menu of soup noodles, which is one of my favorite categories of food. I love their Pho and the Boat Noodles. But after a trip to Madison, Wisconsin, I was introduced to Hmong and Lao cuisine, which shares some overlap with Northern Thai / Isan flavors and ingredients. The Isan sausages at Chimm are very dense and slightly sour from fermented rice, and they go really well with the freshness of the Isan-style green papaya salad, which has an extra kick of heat and a salty-umami flavor from fermented fish sauce. If you’ve never tried green papaya salad, it’s more like zucchini ribbons than the sweet pink flesh of ripe papayas. Sometimes these dishes aren’t available—I think they run out of the green payaya periodically—so I really stuff myself with them while they’re around.”\n\n2) Tuna Poke and Watercress Salad at Mochiko. “The box meals at Mochiko remind me of the plate lunches I had when I visited Honolulu with a friend who grew up there, especially the Mochiko chicken and katsu chicken, and these are among my childrens’ favorite meals. But the poke at Mochiko is what draws me back there, as the flavors are so much more intense than what you find at the typical poke-bowl restaurants that are popular now. Hawaiian-style poke is made out of raw tuna and flavored with soy and sesame oil, which again gives you a great umami kick. It goes great with a side of their watercress salad, a slightly spicy bitter green which is also heavy on the sesame. It’s a classic Japanese American flavor profile with a Hawaiian influence.”\n\n3) Lumpia and Carioca at Manila Street. “I was so happy to see the Manila Street chefs open a storefront at Dairy Market so we didn’t have to chase them down at the farmers’ market or in their food truck to eat Filipino food in town. The lumpia, which is a meat-forward fried roll, are done to crispy perfection at Manila Street, and their small size makes them easy to munch on while waiting for our main meal of barbecue pork belly or chicken adobo with pancit fried noodles. Although they don’t always have dessert for sale, I get the carioca every time I see it. A lot of Asians have a chewy tooth rather than a sweet tooth—by which I mean we really prize toothsome textures like boba pearls, Japanese mochi, chicken gizzards, beef tendons, and sticky, glutinous rice desserts. My Taiwanese relatives would call this texture “Q”. The carioca is a dense sticky rice-based fried pastry with a subtle coconut flavor, and it comes in a set of three to share with your friends. Dense but delicious.”\n\n4) Pan-Fried Steamed Pork Belly and Dry-Fried Eggplant at Peter Chang’s. “I’ve seen a lot of lovely Chinese restaurants come and go since 2004—a few on the Corner whose names elude me, and the first iteration of Café 88 that used to serve the only bubble tea in town. Peter Chang’s arrival in Charlottesville was rightly heralded, and its take on Sichuan cuisine filled a particularly cool niche. The pan-fried steamed pork belly is fairly decadent as main dishes go, with a lightly-breaded slice of fatty pork dressed in a spicy-numb spice mix – the Sichuan peppercorn “mala” flavoring. That same flavoring accompanies the dry-fried eggplant, a surprisingly light dish if you’re used to eggplant parmesean or saucy-heavy Chinese eggplant dishes. They’re like the best French fries you’ve ever had, if you like your fries spicy and tongue-numbing.”\n\n5) Firnee at Afghan Kabob. “Afghan cuisine sits at the crossroads of South Asian and Middle Eastern food cultures, and I’m always excited when my UVA colleagues order catering from Afghan Kabob. Their various kabobs and rice make for a highly satisfying meal, but my weakness is their firnee, a pudding-like dessert flavored with cardamom, rose water, and pistachios. It reminds me of Indian kheer, a rice pudding with a similar flavor profile, or the cardamom gelato at Splendora’s, but feels much more decadent and creamy. I remember one conference at UVA where I simply filled up a coffee cup to the brim with Afghan Kabob’s firnee and snacked on it for the rest of the afternoon.”\n\nMark Benusa\n\nMark Benusa, co-founder of Fine Creek Brewing Company. Benusa’s picks:\n\n1) 80 Shilling Scottish Ale at Decipher Brewing. “The last couple of times I’ve gotten together for beers with my ‘dad’ friends, we’ve met at Decipher Brewing. The guys at Decipher are hands down brewing some of the best beers in town. The 80 Shilling Scottish Ale is incredible. The perfect combination of malty and drinkable. Decipher has plenty of great options on tap, so it’s saying something that I went back for pint #2 of this delicious brew. Especially for someone who is constantly trying new beers.”\n\n2) Cinnamon Roll from T’s Sweetz at IX Art Park. “With such a mild winter, my family and I have been lucky to make it out to the IX Market on several Saturday mornings this season. A few weeks ago, we bought our 5-year-old twin boys a cinnamon roll from T’s Sweetz. This thing was not only colossal but delicious. The kids loved it. The best part was, it was so large, their scavenger dad got to polish off the bit they couldn’t finish.”\n\n3) Chiles Toreados y Cebollitas at Al Carbón. “Al Carbón is one of our go-to family take out spots. It’s one of those rare finds that easily pleases the whole family. One of our favorite sides they have are the Chiles Toreados y Cebollitas. The dish consists of whole chiles and green onions grilled to be crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Salty and sweet, this dish is a palate-pleasing addition to what is always a tasty meal. Now that we’ve found out they deliver, we plan on ordering a lot more often.”\n\n4) Burger and Beer at Mount Ida Reserve. “With a new baby at home, date nights with my wife are unfortunately few and far between. However, we’ve discovered the next best thing which has proven to be easier to achieve: the lunch date! On Valentine’s Day last month, we wanted to do something different and get out of town. We decided to head south down to Mount Ida Reserve Tasting Room & Taphouse. We each got a different burger and beer to try: classic smash for my wife and feisty bull for me, paired with a Festbier and Marzen. Both burgers and beers were phenomenal. And the views were just as good. Taking in the long view of the mountains with a satisfying burger and beer, we felt like we really got to escape, even though we still had a two-month old on our laps.”\n\n5) Crispy Fish with Green Onion at Taste of China. “Chinese, and Szechuan specifically, is one of our favorite take out options on those occasions when we’re looking for some heat. While we do frequent Peter Chang’s, we were turned on to another great option farther north: Taste of China. Don’t let the basic name fool you, these folks have some complex and unique dishes. One we love is their Crispy Fish with Green Onion. Salty filets of crispy fried fish are tossed with chili powder and cumin and topped with cilantro. Once you’ve tasted these perfectly fried bites, I guarantee you’ll crave them like we do.”\n\nMonique Moshier\n\nMonique Moshier of The Happy Cook. Moshier’s picks:\n\n1) English Muffins from Cou Cou Rachou. “I love just about everything from Cou Cou Rachou (particularly the Parisian vibe), but my regular indulgence is the English Muffins. Their English Muffins elevate everything you pair them with. I love pairing them with homemade jam or my favorite use is making an egg sandwich from my backyard chicken eggs and aged white cheddar.”\n\n2) Bison Hanger Steak from Mockingbird. “Melissa Close-Hart is such an amazing chef, and I love so much about her new restaurant in Belmont. The Bison Steak is delicious. I love that option on the menu as I feel like I don’t see Bison on the menu often around Charlottesville. You get the satisfaction from steak but with more complex flavor, and Mockingbird does a great job on this dish complementing the Bison with accompanying sides.”\n\n3) Corner Bowl on Greens from Poke Sushi Bowl. “I feel so spoiled by having Poke Sushi Bowl across the street from The Happy Cook. They have so many good options but my regular indulgence for lunch is the Corner Bowl on Greens. This bowl features salmon, mango, eel and avocado over mixed greens so it hits my sushi favorites but feels healthier over greens with all the same satisfaction.”\n\n4) Floral Funfetti Cake from Cake Bloom. “Cake Bloom is such a fun spot. Normally you can’t have that fancy wedding cake without the big event, but with Cake Bloom you can pop in anytime for a slice. This is a favorite spot of mine to get together with friends and enjoy a glass of champagne. The Floral Funfetti is both beautiful to look at and fun for the taste buds. The flower petals that run through the cake add to both the aesthetic of the cake as well as being well balanced in the flavor.”\n\n5) Old Fashioned from The Mill Room. “I was never much into whiskey until the last few years but now it is my go-to liquor for cocktails. There is nothing more quintessential in the realm of whiskey than a well done Old Fashioned, and Mill Room does it right. I love that they use a large ice cube, a good quality cherry, nice slice of orange peel, and even the glass and ambiance add to the experience.”\n\nAnn Dunn\n\nAnn Dunn of Formula Complete Fitness. Dunn’s picks:\n\n1) Gentle Green from The Juice Laundry. “This juice has ruined any other cold-pressed juice for me. Other juices do not stack up. It is the perfect balance of health and flavor, with a unique combination of kale, spinach, cucumber, grapefruit, and apple juices. It is light and refreshing. When paired with a protein, it is a great start to the day. Plus, I feel like I’m #winning when I get in my greens before 8 am.”\n\n2) Breakfast Bowl at Guajiros. “When beans and rice are a staple in my diet, I feel really good. This dish is a special treat though. I love gallo pinto (Nicaraguan rice and beans), and the pico and cilantro aioli add a tasty touch. The bowl comes with plantains or queso frito (fried cheese) too. I’m from Wisconsin, so I usually choose the latter. Pro tip: don’t miss out on the cafe con leche, the most decadent way to get your coffee fix.”\n\n3) Blue Slate from Greenwood Grocery. “If I am spending the day at one of our amazing local wineries, I love picking up sandwiches and snacks from Greenwood Grocery. The Blue Slate is a classic turkey, havarti, lettuce, and tomato sandwich served on country bread with a perfectly crispy crust. This simple sandwich has a welcomed, unique twist with an ancho lime mayo spread, making it a perfect pairing for the wine and views of the Blue Ridge.”\n\n4) Kale Caesar Salad and Bolo Pasta from Luce. “This Caesar salad, made with kale, shaved brussels, and tomato confit, is one of the best salads I’ve ever tasted. The Bolo is on point, especially if you order it at Crush Pad. There, the staff can share their wine wisdom and offer a perfect wine pairing.”\n\n5) Fries & Flip at Tavern & Grocery/Lost Saint. “If I had to pick a guilty pleasure, it would be of the potato and salt variety. So naturally, the hand-cut fries at Tavern are the best $8 I’ve ever spent. Thin and crispy, they come with homemade spicy ketchup and garlic aioli. Drooling. Make sure you save room for a Flip at the Lost Saint, a speakeasy beneath Tavern & Grocery. I’m not much for cocktails, but the PB&J Flip is peanut buttery, milkshakey goodness. A really fun way to cap off an evening.”\n\nSarah Trundle\n\nSarah Trundle, reader. Trundle’s picks:\n\n1) Grn Street Single Veggie Burger from GRN BRGR. “I pop in to Dairy Market to grab one of these for lunch as often as I can. The burger patty itself is amazing, but the toppings are what keep me coming back. The bun is soft and simple and perfectly sized (i.e. non-mammoth), and it comes with ched’dar, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles (the latter being a must-have for a burger in my mind), and the final piece de resistance, their “street sauce” – some kind of condiment amalgam perfection. The whole thing is just synergistic burger magic.”\n\n2) Birthday Cakes from Chandler’s Bakery. “Granted I have a thing for layer cakes with buttercream frosting, but Chandler’s makes by far the best. Every reason to celebrate calls for a Chandler’s cake, perfectly moist, creamy, sweet without being too-sickly-sweet, and beautifully decorated. Shout out to their radio bars as well; like gourmet hostess ding dongs but a million times better. Plus it just smells so good in there, and the assortment of goodies behind their old school glass bakery case delivers a huge blast of nostalgia.”\n\n3) Charred Carrots at Oakhart Social. “I’m always happy to order whatever the group wants when I find myself at Oakhart Social — it’s ALL good — but this item is a non-negotiable must-have for me. The natural sweetness of the carrots, the slightly smoky flavor, the creamy sauce, the little crunch of the nuts. This is one I’d prefer not to share with the table.”\n\n4) Käsekrainer at Kardinal Hall. “Had to look up the spelling on that one! I don’t know much about sausages other than that I like them, but this one is other-sausage-worldly, and I’ve never tasted anything like it. Kind of savory, kind of sweet, kind of very delicious. Just get it. It comes on a roll but you can order it on top of one of their salads, which is what I do. Ser Guht.”\n\n5) Farmers Bread with Meze Trio at Smyrna. “Really this is mostly about the bread. Order extra. And more extra. It’s lightly toasted/grilled, and just chewy, crusty, perfection that will transport you directly to the Mediterranean. The trio of dips – yogurt goat cheese/ hummus/ and charred eggplant – are amazing as well but they are really just a vehicle for bread. And even more bread. Best I’ve had locally.”\n\nJahnavi Wraight\n\nJahnavi Wraight of La Vie en Rose. Wraight’s picks:\n\n1) Vietnamese Bún at Chimm. “I could eat this every day, and actually do eat it every week. I wouldn’t be surprised if they recognized my name. It is delicious, can be made vegan, and is a wonderful fresh component to every takeout order.”\n\n2) “Eriste” Pasta and Rom & Kola at Smyrna. “This new restaurant is amazing, so it was hard to choose, but this pasta dish is beautifully simple and satisfying, with asparagus and a poached egg to finish. The rom & kola is something I wouldn’t usually order but the housemade cola syrup is so good and gives a cherry cola taste without being too sweet.”\n\n3) Summer Squash Pizza from Oakhart Social. “Duh, gotta shout out my husband and fave restaurant in town. But this pizza for real is truly something special, and will only be on the menu for another week or so. The combination of Appalachian cheeses, thinly sliced zucchini and squash with sunflower gremolata creates this beautifully dynamic flavor combination. Chef’s kiss.”\n\n4) Ranch from Dr. Ho’s Humble Pie. “No need to explain. If you haven’t had it just go try it. They even sell it in massive jars, for nasty people like me who want to put ranch, especially this ranch, on everything. I’ll add a nod to the blue cheese as well from Dr. Ho’s as well because #buffalobills.”\n\n5) Tres Leche Popsicle from La Flor Michoacana. “This little shop is amazing. I can’t speak to the food because I’m always so focused on the popsicles. It is a hidden treasure and I love trying a different one every time.”\n\nTasha Durrett\n\nTasha Durrett, founder of Black Women Who Wine. Durrett’s picks:\n\n1) Caipirinha at South and Central. “This is my favorite drink in the entire city. A caipirinha is such a simple drink, but it’s hard to find a good one in Charlottesville. The one at South and Central is amazing and really the only drink I get there.”\n\n2) Grilled Pineapple at Passiflora. “Let’s be clear. I love Passiflora. But the grilled pineapple is one of my favorite things I’ve ever eaten. I add the garlic citrus jackfruit. and it’s a perfect dish. I’ve tried to copycat it at home and it’s never quite the same.”\n\n3) Pancit at Manila Street. “One of the things I miss most about living in Northern Virginia is Filipino food. Manila cures that longing. The pancit is comparable to any I’ve had, and the staff is always great here. Grab some after work and pair with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc or Vidal Blanc. Add on some lumpia and it’s even better.”\n\n4) Country Ham Croissant at The Blue Ridge Pig. “I’m from Nelson County and I couldn’t be featured here without including my favorite item from The Blue Ridge Pig. Country ham was a staple of every Christmas celebration growing up. It’s expensive and salty, so you don’t want to have too much of a good thing, but when you do have it, it’s amazing. The sandwich is served with dill sauce, which adds to its overall uniqueness.”\n\n5) Fried Chicken Steamed Buns, Spicy Garlic Sauce, House Pickles at Bang!. “Bang! has been nothing if not consistent since I first started going here back when I turned 21. It continues to have some of the best cocktails and small plates in the city. These buns are an homage to the menu of the earlier 2000s and give me a nostalgic feel. I’m happy Bang! is still around. It’s a gem.”\n\nDanielle Stein\n\nDanielle Stein of CBS19. Stein’s picks:\n\n1) Key Lime Martini at Bang!. “There is no question that Bang! is my favorite restaurant in Charlottesville since the first week I came here. I love their rotating menu of small Asian-fusion tapas, and try to pick new things each time. While I do that, there is always one constant: the key lime martini. It’s the perfect balance of sweet and a little tart and a graham cracker crumb rim. Always fits perfect with any dish I order.”\n\n2) Lamb Carpaccio at The Alley Light. “I dream about the lamb carpaccio at Alley Light. The most beautiful and intimate space features some of the more unique things I’ve ever tried. I’ve had other carpaccios like tuna and beef, but the flavor of the paper-thin lamb is so special and is such a star. So good on their bread with the aioli and arugula.”\n\n3) Ka Pow Crispy Pork Belly at Monsoon Siam. “Anything with the words ‘spicy’ and ‘garlic’ in the description is going to call my name, and then with crispy pork belly? Game over. The sauce flavors and the spicy peppers make this dish great, and it packs some heat! Shout out to the Hell Fried Rice too.\n\n4) Provoleta at South and Central. “It’s a skillet of hot, melty cheese that’s crispy and golden on top and makes for the ultimate cheese pull when you scoop it onto bread or with your insane steaks. Enough said. They have lunch special with the provoleta melted onto a steak as well for the best of both worlds. Beautiful space, and always check their steak special (if they have the bison ribeye, GET IT).\n\n5) Cacio e Pepe Pizza at Luce. “Luce has changed me for the better. I love their pasta, but their pizza is just something else. You get all the joy of cacio e pepe pasta, but on a white pizza. This, quite literal, hole in the wall off the downtown mall makes for the perfect carryout meal, and I loved their tented live music summer series in the parking lot next door.”\n\nAllan LeHew\n\nAllen LeHew of Duck’s Cottage Coffee & Books. LeHew’s picks:\n\n1) Seasonal Fruit Brioche at Albemarle Baking Company. “This delicate, light and fluffy brioche, filled with pastry cream and seasonal fruit, is perfect with your morning coffee, as an afternoon snack, or even for dessert.”\n\n2) Jambon Beurre at Belle. “Belle’s take on this classic French sandwich is so simple yet so delicious. The house baked bread, using flour from Woodson’s Mill, is perfection. Finish your meal with one of Belle’s cinnamon rolls or chocolate chip cookies.”\n\n3) Pig Mac at Little Star. “#11 on Simon’s 29 Sandwich list. A breaded pork cutlet with all the fixings to make it a Mac. Served on a brioche sesame seed roll. One of those thing I eat and days later think about and crave another.”\n\n4) Quenelles de Brochet at Café Frank. “My wife Judy and I try to dine at Café Frank whenever we are in town. Nothing disappoints, but the standout so far has been the Quenelles. The pike dumpling practically melts in your mouth and the rich velouté is the perfect accompaniment.”\n\n5) Ethiopian Qabballe Pourover at Mudhouse. “I’m partial to the fruit forward Ethiopian coffees and the pourover method really brings the fruit out. Leave the cream and sugar out, and enjoy the subtle nuances and mouthfeel of the coffee. You can’t go wrong with any of the single origin coffees Mudhouse has to offer.”\n\nCasandra Rodriguez\n\nCasandra Rodriguez of Vegan Comforts Soul Food. Rodriguez’s picks:\n\n1) Pho and Crispy Rolls at Vu Noodles. “I get the crispy rolls just so I can dip them in the pho, and both together are so comforting, savory, and refreshingly delicious. I literally go here once or twice a week. Highly recommend.”\n\n2) Portobello Philly at Firefly. “When I’m craving a Philly cheesesteak and don’t feel like cooking this is my go-to spot for it. It is so yummy.”\n\n3) Creole Beans Platter at Pearl Island. “Wooo chile, this whole meal is the perfect combo. The creole beans are perfectly seasoned and the tostones with the sauce are to die for. Don’t get me started on the rice with the garlic kale. So so good.”\n\n4) Won Ton Nachos at Botanical. “Ryan got me hooked on these nachos. They are so delicious. The cashew cheese sauce could pass for real cheese, first of all, and the toppings were so fresh and had the perfect crisp light touch. Def will be back for more.”\n\n5) General Tso’s Cauliflower and Coconut Rice at Bang!. “Bring back the chickpea roll things, haha, no but seriously. My favorite dish from here right now is the General Tso’s cauliflower and the coconut rice. So comforting and filling.”\n\nRyan Becklund\n\nRyan Becklund of Botanical. Becklund’s picks:\n\n1) Any Vegan Croissant from Bowerbird Bakeshop. “I can’t believe that vegan croissants exist in Charlottesville and on top of that, these ones are perfect. Flaky, buttery, and delicious. You would never know they are vegan.”\n\n2) Vegan Tater Tachos from Firefly. “Firefly has an awesome vegan menu overall, but these are my favorite on the list. Who doesn’t love a good tacho, especially with some rich cashew cheese?\n\n3) Chili from The Juice Laundry. “This chili is a showstopper. It is vegan, but it could stand the test against any traditionally made chili. Definitely get it with the jalapeño cashew cream.”\n\n4) Sweet Potato Tempura Roll from Now & Zen. “There are tons of veggie sushi rolls on the menu and all are great, but this is my go-to roll. I could eat it everyday.”\n\n5) Marinara D.O.C. from Lampo. “A pizza without cheese is the only way I eat pizza. Without the cheese, the sauce and bread are the stars and that is exactly the case on this comforting, satisfying pie.”\n\nJaclyn Shaffer\n\nJaclyn Shaffer of Jaclyn’s Cookies. Shaffer’s picks:\n\n1) Basan Paitan from Basan. “Hands down the most delicious bowl of ramen that I’ve eaten. I’ve spent a lot of time stalking this food truck the past couple of years, and I can’t wait to see what Basan and Mama Bird do with their new space at Umma’s.”\n\n2) Kao Soi Chicken from Chimm. “If you haven’t tried Chimm yet, you need to visit. I love this curry so much because it’s the perfect combo of spicy broth, rich dark meat chicken and crispy fried wontons.”\n\n3) Financier from MarieBette. “Everything from MarieBette is fantastic, but the buttery, crunchy outside and sweet, tender inside of their financier makes it my favorite.”\n\n4) Funghi from Lampo. “I don’t even like mushrooms that much, but this pizza is the bomb. I always try to branch out when I visit, but I find myself coming back to this pizza every time. The earthy mushrooms with cream sauce and cheese, cooked in a woodfired oven is pizza perfection.”\n\n5) Banana Bread from Green House Coffee. “I have to shout out my local Crozet coffee shop. Every time I’m there I can’t help ordering their addictive banana bread with an iced coffee.”\n\nDani Landi\n\nDani Landi of Kaas and Cure Board Co.. Landi’s picks:\n\n1) The Hodgepodge from Public Fish & Oyster. “When my husband and I get a kid-free date night, we love to make reservations at Public Fish & Oyster. Last time we ate there I ordered a refreshing French 75 cocktail with The Hodgepodge. It includes all my favorite seafood. Virginia clams, mussels, oysters, shrimp, tomato, haricot verts, rice, lobster “Nantua” sauce. My husband is allergic to shrimp, so we never cook it at home. When I see shrimp on a menu, I order it.”\n\n2) Filet Mignon with Chimichurri Sauce from South and Central. “It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite from South and Central in the Dairy Market. Every single time I have dined there my meal has been amazing. I love how the platillos (small plates) change often. They had these amazing tacos on the small plate menu once, and I secretly hope they are back on the menu every time we go. If you are reading this South and Central, please bring back those tacos.”\n\n3) The Savory Custom from Iron Paffles & Coffee. “What’s better than a Paffle? Being able to customize your own. I am allergic to eggs, so it’s not often that I get to indulge in anything sweet and savory. Their puff pastry waffle sandwiches are available in vegan (egg free) and gluten free. I go all out, when I order. The more toppings the better. If you aren’t already following them on Instagram, you need to. Trust me.”\n\n4) The Cowboy from Jack Brown’s. “One of my favorite places to go after attending a concert downtown is Jack Brown’s. My go-to order is always an IPA Dry-Hopped cider from Bold Rock and The Cowboy. The Cowboy is a Burger topped with BBQ sauce, Applewood Smoked Bacon and American cheese with a side of sweet potato fries.”\n\n5) Grilled Pork Steak and Charred Carrots from Oakhart Social. “Dining at Oakhart Social is meant to be a shared experience, but I find it so hard to share. One time I went with a big group of friends, and we ordered almost every dish on the menu. I always end my meal there with a delicious after dinner drink.”\n\nLiz Broyles\n\nLiz Broyles, co-owner of Birdhouse. Broyles’ picks:\n\n1) English Muffin from Cou Cou Rachou. “Best English muffin I’ve ever had. If you haven’t checked out Rachel De Jong’s baked goods yet, you gotta do it.”\n\n2) Falafel Bowl from Otto. “This bowl is a treat. Falafel sits on top of roasted beets, white bean salad, red cabbage salad, suma c onions, Coban salad, fried eggplant and greens.\n\n3) Bricolage from Patois Cider. “These amazing ciders made by Patrick Collins are really special, crafted with intention and care at each stage. Patrick scouts for apple trees in the mountains and harvests these ol’ timey varieties with the help of his partner Danielle LeCompte. Ciders are made without modification or added yeasts and are unrefined and unfiltered. Delicious.”\n\n4) Marinara D.O.C. Pizza from Lampo. “San Marzano tomato, garlic, wild oregano, sea salt, olive oil. Nuff said.”\n\n5) Cauliflower Sous Shu from Pearl Island. “The food at Pearl Island is full of flavor, healthy and fresh. Make sure you get an extra side of Pikliz.”\n\nMegan Adams\n\nMegan Adams, locak baker. Adams’ picks:\n\n1) Spicy Honey Garlic Karaage from Basan. “This is everything you could ever want in a chicken nugget. Basan marinates, double fries, and sauces to perfection these sweet-salty-spicy nuggets. They can be eaten any time of day, even for breakfast.”\n\n2) Kabocha Squash Brioche Tart with Cream Cheese from Baker No Bakery. “Chris had this brioche on her menu more than once, and that just felt like Christmas all October long. The pastry was soft, yet sturdy enough to hold the weight of a squash purée and cream cheese filling. I had no idea what I had signed up for but once I knew I had to go back for seconds and thirds.”\n\n3) Tofu Caramelized Onions Noodles from Vu Noodles. “This dish is my go-to almost every time I’m having a bad day. I grab my bag, sit in my car, whip out the chopsticks and go to town on that box of noodles. And every time, without fail, I find myself happier with every bite. The ginger soy sauce just drenches the noodles and tofu and makes for the best pick-me-up meal.”\n\n4) Za’atar Croissant from Bowerbird Bakeshop. “I fervently believe there is not a single sandwich condiment that cannot be put on this croissant. Veggies, pork belly and American cheese, egg and kimchi. Shoot, you could even do up a fancy avocado toast on this baby because it can literally handle anything. 10/10.”\n\n5) Smash Burger from Basan. “I’m sorry to admit that in the 12 years of food service work I’ve clocked, I hadn’t had a smash burger until . . . THIS YEAR. Oh man was I missing out. These smash burgers are a special menu item only brought out during pop ups, so if you know . . . you know. I had built my own with egg, Mama Bird’s Napa Kimchi, avocado, comeback sauce, onion, and American chees, but I could have eaten it entirely plain and still had a 420/10 experience. The crust on the burger from being smashed and so quickly seared is unlike any burger your dad can pull off of his grill. Sorry Dad.”\n\nJen Pease\n\nJen Pease, reader. Pease’s picks:\n\n1) Miso Chocolate Chip Cookie from Cou Cou Rachou. “My platonic ideal of a cookie: the perfect balance of crispy/chewy and salty/sweet. We are so lucky to live in a town with several amazing bakeries, and Cou Cou Rachou is a fabulous addition. (My kids also wanted me to mention their favorite treats: the Prezzant and the Stuffed Chocolate Shortbread, both from MarieBette.)”\n\n2) Migas Taco from Brazos. “I first tried migas tacos while visiting Austin a few years ago, and I was thrilled to find them on the menu at Brazos. Egg, veggies, cheese, and tortilla chips? On a taco? Yes, please. Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.”\n\n3) Raspberry Triangle from Atlas Coffee. “Atlas is the epitome of the neighborhood coffee shop: the type of place where you always see familiar faces and the baristas start your order when you walk in the door. A latte and a raspberry triangle is my favorite way to start a workday.”\n\n4) Beets from Oakhart Social. “My husband and I frequently have a hard time deciding which of the many great veggie dishes to order at Oakhart, but this one always makes the cut.”\n\n5) Seabass Normandy from Café Frank. “One of the best dishes I have eaten this year. We love the atmosphere at Café Frank – another great addition to the Charlottesville dining scene.”\n\nCharlie Xavier\n\nCharlie Xavier, of Patch Brewery. Xavier’s picks:\n\n1) Al Pastor Taco at Tacos Gomez. “I am a lover of Mexican Food, and when we discovered Tacos Gomez food truck, I was hooked. We try to grab dinner or lunch to go. The green sauce is the best.”\n\n2) Smoked Turkey on an Everything with Lettuce, Tomatoes, Munster Cheese, Bean Sprouts, Avocado and Mayo from Bodo’s. “Love me some Bodo’s. When I am out between play dates with the boys, Bodo’s is a must.”\n\n3) Any Taco from Brazos Tacos. “As mentioned before, I love Mexican food. When I am at the IX with the kids or as family, we will always grab some tacos at Brazos Tacos. I love the Tex-Mex influence.”\n\n4) Chicken Cemita from Al Carbon. “I really enjoy the chicken at Al Carbon, and the cemita with the roasted chicken is just incredible. I really enjoy the fresh Oaxacan cheese, and the fresh bread. I discovered Al Carbon when next door they had Chew Chew Town – our oldest son used to love that place.”\n\n5) Princess Cake from Albemarle Baking Company. “It is no secret that I love sweets, but the princess cake is the one that I must have on my birthday. My husband André already knows what cake I always want for my birthday. I can’t even explain why I like it so much. It is just the best cake in the world.”\n\nChris Martin\n\nChris Martin of Baker No Bakery Martin’s picks:\n\n1) Café con Leche at Guajiros Miami Eatery. “The perfect balance of espresso, sweetness, espuma, and milk. And enough caffeine to fuel me for eternity. I drink this iced every single day I can.”\n\n2) Taiyakis from Basan. “Basan is delightful because of their specials, and I’m personally obsessed with their taiyakis. There is typically always a red bean flavor, but there was a banana cream flavor that lingers with me to this day.”\n\n3) Baleadas at El Ciruelo. “This restaurant has amazing flour tortillas, and they shine in any and all of the baleadas. My Honduran coworker introduced me to these and I can’t get enough.”\n\n4) Ddukbokki at Kuma Sushi Noodles & Bar. “Their ddukbokki is perfectly spicy, with chewy rice cakes that I adore. Also the iced honey plum tea is *chefs kiss*.”\n\n5) Biko from Manila Street. “I love sticky rice, and Manila Street’s traditional Filipino dessert called biko in the Dairy Market is so good. The chewiness of the rice, just sweet enough, and toasted coconut are super yum.”\n\nChase Davidson\n\nChase Davidson, son. Davidson’s picks:\n\n1) Lumpia from Little Manila and Manila Street. “I’ve been eating these for a long time. When I was younger, I used to look forward to Saturdays because we would always go to the market and Little Manila would have a tent set up there. It’s one of my favorite foods, and it goes perfectly with the sauce.”\n\n2) Marinara D.O.C. from Lampo. “It’s been a tradition for a while that every year on my birthday, I get this pizza from Lampo. I don’t typically like really cheesy pizzas, so this one is perfect for me. Another tradition we had was every Friday in the pandemic my dad would go out and get this pizza for me.”\n\n3) Pan Tomate at Little Star. “I could consume a lot of these.”\n\n4) Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream at La Flor Michoacana. “My dad introduced this place to me. My sister wanted to go to Chap’s but I wanted to try this place, and I’m glad I did because it is some of the best ice cream that I have ever had.”\n\n5) Mini Corn Dogs at Riverside Lunch. “Anytime I travel for a swim meet, my dad tries to find places close to the pool with mini corn dog nuggets because I enjoy them so much. I have gone to many places but none are better than the ones that Riverside has.”\n\nKate Douglass\n\nKate Douglass, UVa swimmer and Olympic Bronze Medalist. Douglass’s picks:\n\n1) Stumble Down Mac N’ Cheese and Buffalo Chicken Sandwich from The Virginian. “I can never choose between these two, so I usually get both. But they have the Mac N’ Cheese in an appetizer and meal size which is great.”\n\n2) Pepperoni Pizza from Dino’s Wood Fired Pizza in Dairy Market. “My new favorite pizza place in Charlottesville. Also has amazing mozzarella sticks.”\n\n3) Bacon Egg and Cheese on a Croissant from MarieBette Café and Bakery. “I love a good bacon, egg and cheese, but on a buttery croissant? Makes it ten times better.”\n\n4) Chocolate Milkshake from The Nook. “A great breakfast spot on the Downtown Mall with amazing milkshakes. A chocolate milkshake at 9 am has never tasted so good.”\n\n5) Bacon Egg and Cheese on a Biscuit from Ace Biscuit & Barbecue. “I’m a big fan of breakfast spots . . . and biscuits . . . and this is one of my new favorites. The only thing that could possibly top a bacon egg and cheese on a croissant is one on a biscuit.\n\nElizabeth Pelly\n\nElizabeth Pelly, Co-owner and Creative Director of Merrie Mill Farm & Vineyard. Pelly’s picks:\n\n1) Everything Baguette from MarieBette Café & Bakery. “This baguette is literally everything to me. Crunchy and flavorful on the outside, soft and light in the inside. I rarely make it out to the car without having a bite or home without eating half of it. It is even great the day after, if there is any left, toasted with a thin layer of cream cheese and avocado.”\n\n2) Carciofo at Tavola (fried artichokes with whipped goat cheese and garlic aioli). “The ‘last supper’ my husband and I had before my second daughter was born was at Tavola. It was the only time I have eaten in the restaurant. We had a lovely dinner and then during COVID – while we have not been out much – we ordered take-away for our seventh wedding anniversary dinner. It can be risky ordering anything ‘fritti’ to take away but the artichoke was absolutely perfect and the goat cheese dipping sauce is divine.”\n\n3) House Dressing from Take It Away. “Does a condiment count in this exercise? Doesn’t matter because I don’t care. First discovered in my university years, it is too good not to mention. A delightful mix of tangy and creamy, this is the perfect companion to a deli sandwich, and I have been known to dip plain bread in the house dressing as a snack.”\n\n4) Princess Cake from Albemarle Baking Company. “I have only had two birthdays in our new home in Keswick, but the princess cake has featured at both. This cake is heaven. Who wouldn’t love marzipan with light fluffy white cake and decadent whipped cream filling? It is perfect for any special occasion, or actually I might have to order one now.”\n\n5) Fried Chicken from Michie Tavern. “For the soft launch of our tasting room at Merrie Mill, we had tons of friends and neighbors come visit. A pretty big contingency stayed for dinner up at our house. I ordered fried chicken from Michie Tavern and everyone, including me, was blown away. If I had a dime for every time someone told me ‘this is the best fried chicken I have ever had,’ I would be buying a lot more fried chicken.”\n\nRachel De Jong\n\nRachel De Jong of Cou Cou Rachou. De Jong’s picks:\n\n1) Huaraches from La Sabrosita in Waynesboro. “I know, it’s outside Charlottesville proper, but it’s my partner and I’s favorite day off lunch. It’s such a fun escape and the food is always wonderful.”\n\n2) Patois Cider from Market Street Wine. “This is a double duty answer. I went to pastry school in Paris and, on a baker/student budget, crepes and cider were without a doubt one of my most frequent meals. Patrick’s cider is the best I’ve had this side of the Atlantic and I’m very excited about what he is creating and cultivating in the area – Virginia apples need this kind of love. Market Street Wine is definitely my happy place. Siân and Thad are wonderful humans who are also doing tremendous things for their industry and community, and I am very thankful to have a place I can go where I know the recommendations and knowledge of the product will be impeccable.”\n\n3) Thai Tea Gelato and Honey, Goat Cheese, and Fig Gelato from Splendora’s. “PK is making such fun, wonderful, interesting things and I am so happy that we can still get her gelato in town. She’s one of the many reasons I’m delighted to be back in the Charlottesville food community.”\n\n4) Korean Cabbage Kimchi from Sussex Farm. “In my fridge always. My favorite day-off breakfast and anytime addition to brighten up a meal.”\n\n5) Hot and Numbing Shredded Tofu Skins from Peter Chang. “Ordered this so much throughout the quarantine takeout era. One of my go-to standbys, and I would eat it every day if that were a reasonable thing to do.”\n\nFernando Dizon\n\nFernando Dizo of Manila Street. Dizon’s picks:\n\n1) Apple Galette from Bee Conscious Baking Company. “Patrick and Alexis just opened their new spot in Dairy Market and we couldn’t be happier for them. Also for our tummies because now we can get their goodies everyday. The Apple Galette is my favorite. Caramelized apples inside a perfectly crispy crust. Everything they make is delicious. Our boys love their cinnamon sugar donuts.”\n\n2) Special Waffle at Milli Coffee Roasters. “This is our go -to spot for breakfast on Sundays. A Belgian waffle topped with brie, Granny Smith apple and honey. The waffle is always crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. I really need to know how they make their batter.”\n\n3) Gambas al’ Parilla at Mas. “This is our go-to date night spot. Sitting on the patio with a pitcher of sangria and some delicious tapas is our happy place. The grilled shrimp are a must. Served grilled shell on sprinkled with sea salt on a bed of aioli.”\n\n4) Complete dinner for Two at Afghan Kabob Palace. “Over the last year we’ve ordered a lot of takeout. Afghan Kabob has always done a fantastic job. The food quality and the service is always consistent. The complete dinner for two is so much food you’ll have leftovers for lunch the next day. It comes with salad, two appetizers, two entrees and two kinds of dessert as well as a choice of coffee or tea. My favorite of the entrees is the Qabuli Palow- tender lamb with raisins and carrots on a bed of brown rice.”\n\n5) Loose Goose Martini at Zocalo. “After trying all those good eats you can wash it all down with a Loose Goose at Zocalo, another favorite spot in C’ville. Hands down my favorite cocktail anywhere. I always order it with a jalapeño to add a little kick. Sipping on one of these at the bar or on the patio at Zocalo is a must try in C’ville.”\n\nClaudia Cruz\n\nClaudia Cruz of Dulce De Leche. Cruz’s picks:\n\n1) La Familia Chicken from Al Carbon. “It is very nice to choose for the whole family. We usually order La Familia size chicken after having a long day from work. It reminds us of our rotisserie chicken from back home, Peru.”\n\n2) East Coast from Burger Bach. “When looking for a place for a good burger there is no doubt there are multiple places in Charlottesville, but my favorite burger is located here. The flavors of this sweet and salty burger are out of the world. Not to mention with my favorite cheese, brie, mixed with my favorite fruit, blueberries. Say no more, I will be there in a blink of an eye if possible.”\n\n3) Shrimp Tacos from Guadalajara Mexican Restaurant (UVa location). “I’m kind of embarrassed to say but I don’t venture out with tacos, I only order shrimp tacos in every Mexican restaurant. Therefore, the shrimp tacos from this restaurant are absolutely amazing, with fresh cabbage and crème cilantro lime sauce. Delish.”\n\n4) Shrimp Tempura Sushi from Snowfox Sushi (Inside Kroger, Barracks Road). “It’s a little-known secret but the sushi in Kroger is actually made by franchise owners of Snowfox Sushi. This means that the sushi chefs are free to get creative and bring their knowledge when it comes to making the best sushi possible. One of our best friends owns this location and is one of the best sushi chefs we have ever met.”\n\n5) BLT on Everything from Bodo’s. “Nothing like a good bagel with hot coffee to start your day. We enjoy this Charlottesville staple very much. No matter how long the line is, it is worth the wait.”\n\nAlyce Johnson\n\nAlyce Johnson of Sweet Jane’s KitchenJohnson’s picks:\n\n1) Bee Bomb at Tonic. “Tonic is my favorite place to grab a drink. They strike the perfect balance between an upscale and a relaxed atmosphere. I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve tried there but I really love their Bee Bomb. It is perfectly tangy and not too sweet.”\n\n2) Spicy Honey Garlic Karage from Basan. “My go-to snack when I’m working the market at IX park. When I recommend someone try these they’ll often roll their eyes and say something like ‘Chicken nuggets? Really?’. But they are always blown away, this dish is so tasty.”\n\n3) Salted Caramel Apple Galette from Bee Conscious Baking Company. “Flaky, sweet, and perfect with a cup of coffee. Bee Conscious used to be our neighbor at the farmer’s market (which was dangerous), and I loved grabbing a galette before they sold out for the morning. Now we visit them at their new shop in the Dairy Market.”\n\n4) Smoked Salmon Spread from Cold Country Salmon. “Another farmer’s market favorite of mine. Our family loves to bring a picnic when we go hiking and we’ll often have this spread with crackers or bagels. It’s also great as a snack or an appetizer.”\n\n5) Milkshakes from Moo Thru. “We love visiting the Dairy Market because it’s so family friendly and an easy way to grab lunch that everyone is happy with. We like taking our meal across the street to Washington Park so the kids can play. We especially love the milkshakes from Moo Thru. Not to brag, but we consider ourselves milkshakes connoisseurs and these are some of the best around.”\n\nLauren Strachan\n\nLauren Strachan, proprietor of Harvest Moon Lodge and Retreat. Strachan’s picks:\n\n1) Tinga de Pollo Tacos at La Michoacana. “I love tacos. Being in the travel and tourism business, I have spent quite a lot of time in Mexico eating authentic tacos and Mexican food. La Michoacana’s tacos and all of their food are as authentic and good as they get. With everything scratch made from the tortillas to the salsa, the tinga de pollo tacos are simply perfect. I also love how unassuming this taqueria is. No frills, great food.”\n\n2) Porchetta Panuozzo at Lampo. “I lived in New York City for 15 years. I have eaten my share of amazing Italian food and incredible pizza. This Charlottesville spot rivals them all. It was very hard to choose a favorite here because everything is great but my weakness is the porchetta sandwich. It’s created with their house-made porchetta, garlic aioli, broccoli rabe, calabrian chili, fior di latte and provolone. I mean, it doesn’t really get much better than this.”\n\n3) Roasted Scallops at C&O. “I can’t get enough of the vibe inside this restaurant. When I want a more upscale meal, I go here. The appetizer dish of roasted scallops with whipped cauliflower and a golden raisin caper butter sauce is literally making me salivate as I write this. Also, I love nothing more than a drink at a cozy bar in just the right ambiance. Have a drink at the downstairs bar- you won’t regret it, unless you have one too many!”\n\n4) Bocadillo at Mas. “My husband is half Spanish so we love going out for tapas. Bocadillo is freshly shaved jamon serrano on a sandwich with garlic aioli and manchego cheese. Let me just tell you, it is divine. The gambas is grilled shrimp in the shell with garlic aioli and is also incredible. Mas is the best place to have drinks and enjoy the evening as your tapas come out one or two at a time. The sangria and the margaritas are excellent.”\n\n5) Ednam at The Market. “On our way to Harvest Moon Lodge and Retreat, our entire family loves stopping here at the Mill Creek location just off 64. The Ednam is made with maple turkey, bacon, havarti, avocado, lettuce, tomato and an herb mayonnaise on French bread. A Charlottesville staple, these sandwiches are made with quality ingredients and are delicious. Nuff said.”\n\nTodd DeSorbo\n\nTodd DeSorbo, head coach UVa Swimming & Diving. DeSorbo’s picks:\n\n1) Burger with Bacon at Wayside Takeout & Catering. “This has become our staff’s go-to pre-Championship lucky lunch. The Monday prior to every ACC or NCAA Championship (including two weeks ago before our women won the National Title), we head to Wayside for a burger. If I had to pick a favorite food of mine, it’s for sure a burger, and Wayside does them right. Not to mention convenient to our place of work, the AFC pool.”\n\n2) Piggie Smalls at Fry’s Spring Station. “If you’re sensing a theme in locations, it’s likely because when I first moved to Charlottesville I lived just behind Scott Stadium, and pretty much went from the house to the pool, and didn’t know much other than that there were several great food joints within walking distance. This turned out to be a family favorite and a staff favorite. We often have gathered here with all our swimming and diving staff and families to hang out. The pizza is phenomenal and the casual atmosphere is right up my alley.”\n\n3) Black Coffee at Atlas Coffee. “Sorry to be sticking with the theme again here, but this was my go-to Thursday morning treat. It’s always been a goal of mine to be able to walk into a coffee shop (or bar) and be ‘regular’ enough that the barista knows what drink you want. I only went a few weeks in a row and they knew exactly what I wanted. I finally made it! Great coffee, great spot.”\n\n4) Mother’s Day Roll at Tokyo Rose. “My family and I have eaten more sushi since the pandemic hit than probably in the previous five years. Likely because my 12 year-old son has decided he loves spicy tuna rolls, and Tokyo Rose’s are the best. Personally I love the Mother’s Day Roll. We haven’t been inside the restaurant in a year, but the takeout/delivery is just as good as dining in.”\n\n5) Kimchi Pork Wrap at Beer Run. “This restaurant was introduced to us by the myth ‘The Charlottesville 29.’ This is a go-to for our family and friends. From family night out to champagne celebrations when our staff won our first ACC Title three years ago, Beer Run has been a staple in our eat out rotation. Great beer selection (almost too good), great food, and great casual environment. If you can’t tell, I like casual.”\n\nBrittany Miller\n\nBrittany Miller of Cakes by Rachel and Shenandoah Imagery. Miller’s picks:\n\n1) Vegan “Crab” Cake Sandwich at Firefly. “You can’t tell it’s not real crab. And this is coming from someone who orders crab cakes whenever I see them on a menu. I would recommend Firefly to any vegetarian or vegan looking for delicious eats.”\n\n2) Southern Fried Chicken at South Street Brewery. “A huge piece of perfectly seasoned chicken is complemented by pillows of mashed potatoes and gravy. It’s comfort food at its finest. Better than Grandma’s.”\n\n3) Chocolate Sour Cream Cake from Cakes by Rachel. “Everyone who’s had Rachel’s baked goods can attest to them being the best in the area, but Rachel’s chocolate cake reigns supreme, and I’m not historically a huge fan of chocolate cake. Pro tip: order yours with the chocolate buttercream. Absolute heaven. Everyone wishes they were her official cake taster, but that’s actually part of my job. I’m very lucky to work there.”\n\n4) Sigara Börek at Sultan Kebab. “Hot phyllo rolls filled with Turkish white cheese and parsley should tell you all you need to know. They’re like mozzarella sticks, but better. Having shot their whole menu, I can certify that the owners are really great people who are passionate about their food and you can tell. Every bite amazes.”\n\n5) Chicken Paffle from Iron Paffles. “What exactly is a paffle? I’m not really sure. I just know those paffle sandwiches taste really freaking good. I recommend the chicken with the macaroni and cheese and sriracha. The chicken is tender and the paffles are perfectly flaky. Mac and cheese just rounds it out to make it a perfect sandwich. I can’t wait to go back.”\n\nMary Bridget Kane\n\nMary Bridget Kane, reader. Kane’s picks:\n\n1) Ham Biscuits from JM Stock Provisions. “Absolute perfection and my favorite way to start a weekend morning. Also everyone who works there is just fantastic.”\n\n2) Wessex from Greenwood Gourmet Grocery. “One of my favorite things about the Charlottesville area is that there are at least a half dozen truly fantastic sandwich places. After years of taste tests and an extensive Google Doc ranking system, I’ve concluded that Greenwood Grocery tops the list. It’s tough to choose just one from their menu but I keep coming back to the Wessex.”\n\n3) Turkey and Swiss on Sourdough from Take it Away. “Couldn’t pick just one Cville sandwich. My go to is turkey and Swiss on their homemade sourdough with arugula, pickles, roasted tomatoes and of course extra house dressing.”\n\n4) Shaved Salad at Oakhart Social. “Perfect combination of sweet, savory, crunchy. I think it’s the dates that make it.”\n\n5) Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup from C&O. “Best served with a dirty martini and some late night gossip. Makes me feel like I’ve traveled back in time.”\n\nDebbie Ward-McKeon\n\nDebbie Ward-McKeon, reader. Ward-McKeon’s picks:\n\n1) Grilled Local Pork with Spatzle, Kale from Petit Pois. “Local pork straight from Autumn Olive Farms. Follow Petit Pois online to see daily menus. If you see coq au vin, head over for lunch, dinner, or take out. Check out Land by Hand. I ordered the Chef’s Share for my kitchen. So many choices.”\n\n2) Chiles Toreados y Cebollitas from Al Carbon. “It’s an art to elevate the vegetables. A side dish of whole spicy jalapeños grilled with fat white onion bulbs still attached to their green tops. Take home two orders. They are just as delicious the next day. You know about the Al Carbon chicken. I order enough dark meat for two days.”\n\n3) Peasant Beef & Pork Bolognese from Orzo Kitchen & Wine Bar. “Start with a Negroni made with Bombay gin, Dolin sweet vermouth, Campari, and an orange twist. Followed by angus beef & Duroc pork, pomodoro, chili flakes, and cream swirled into a Bolognese married to rigatoni. Finish with olive oil and rosemary cake with lemon curd and whipped cream. Select table side or curbside service. Sign up for Orzo emails which include the new Passport Menu.”\n\n4) Melanzane Alla Parmigiana from Tavola. “I like Tavola’s courses served family style. Order takeout online and serve it up at home.\n\nAntipasti misti for 2: a selection of artisanal cheeses and cured meats, olives, grilled artichokes and pickled sweet peppers.\n\nPaste: Pappardelle Bolognese, a tender house made pasta, with a local beef and pork Bolognese sauce topped with grana padano.\n\nEntrata: Melanzane alla parmigiana, layering of breaded eggplant, San Marzano tomatoes, ricotta, fresh mozzarella, and basil.”\n\n5) Apple Brioche with Pastry Cream from Albemarle Baking Company. “Apple brioche is always first on my pastry takeout list. Currant scones, baked currant doughnuts, and cinnamon buns follow the brioche. Throw in an oatmeal raisin cookie which is unlike any oatmeal cookie I have ever eaten. Pack it all up and take it home.”\n\nHeather Broach\n\nHeather Broach, reader. Broach’s picks:\n\n1) Cantarito con Tequila from Little Star. “A little bit spicy, a little bit sour, a little bit sweet. This marg hits all the taste buds. Perfect for any time of the year.”\n\n2) Flautas from Al Carbon. “These chicken filled fried rolled tacos are topped with cotija cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. These are my absolute favorites and I order them every time.”\n\n3) Rainbow Bowl with Noodles from Poke Sushi Bowl. “I’ve been to Hawaii and lived in Southern California for 15 years. When I first tried this place I was floored by the authenticity of the flavors, the quality of the food, and the speed of the service. I always order the Rainbow bowl with noodles and add as many toppings as possible.”\n\n4) Chicken Salad on an Everything from Bodo’s. “My absolute favorite thing to order is an everything bagel with chicken salad. It’s simple, yet so comforting. I’ve been ordering this since high school and every year I returned to visit my family, and continue to do so now that I’ve moved back.”\n\n5) El Jefe from Roots. “I was first introduced to Roots through a colleague. Delicious bowls that are filling and very nutritious. I will typically order the El Jefe. It’s the perfect blend of flavors that I like and it keeps me full all day long.\n\nChristina Fessler\n\nChristina Fessler, reader. Fessler’s picks:\n\n1) Brisket from Ace Biscuit & Barbecue. “This was one of the first dishes I had after first moving into Charlottesville. The brisket was very juicy and full of flavor and the different sauces that Ace Biscuit & Barbecue had to offer further accentuated the rich spices and love that went into this dish.”\n\n2) Chicken Nachos from El Puerto. “So simple but yet so satisfying. This dish has the right amount of queso to make anyone happy. This place is truly a hidden gem.”\n\n3) Shrimp and Grits from Ivy Inn. “My only gripe about this dish is that there is not an unlimited supply of it on hand. The shrimp is always cooked perfectly, and the grits have the right amount of butter and cheesy goodness that you crave in your grits. I always want seconds after this and never do I want to share.”\n\n4) The Balboa (AKA “The Italian Philly”) from Basil. “This is a dish that you need to share. Do not sleep on Basil’s sandwiches. Not only is the portion size fit for two grown adults, it is a heck of a value! But beware this sandwich can get messy.”\n\n5) Fried Green Tomato BLT from Croby’s. “Not only is the food good at Croby’s, so are the people. The staff here genuinely love their job and it shows in their food. The fried green tomato BLT is something I crave on the daily. It comes with not one tomato, but two. Did I also mention the very generous bacon portions?”\n\nKelleigh Hughes\n\nKelleigh Hughes, reader. Hughes’ picks:\n\n1) Bacon, Egg, and Cheese from MarieBette. “This is the best of both worlds. You can get it on a croissant or their famous prezzant which means you get to have your breakfast sandwich AND pastry. Can’t forget to grab a cup of coffee with it.”\n\n2) Coliflor from Conmole. “I wasn’t sure what exactly to expect with this cauliflower dish but I am so glad I tried it. The green mole sauce with egg and cauliflower, mmm.”\n\n3) 40 Mile Philly from Three Notch’d Craft Kitchen & Brewery. “I love a good Philly cheesesteak. This one never disappoints especially with all the beer cheese on it. To be able to pick up dinner and great beer from the same spot, definitely a win.”\n\n4) Shrimp Scampi with Risotto from Vivace. “It was hard to pick just one dish from here, especially not a pasta one, but the risotto is to die for. Paired with the seared shrimp and asparagus, I can normally get 2 meals out of this.”\n\n5) Fat and Sassy from Dr. Ho’s Humble Pie. “Cheesy, garlicky, deliciousness. Don’t forget to add a jar of their homemade ranch to go.”\n\nTiffany Nguyen\n\nTiffany Nguyen, reader. Nguyen’s picks:\n\n1) Porchetta from Lampo. “Really, we love almost everything on the Lampo menu – Olives! Negroni! Hellboy! Oh my! However, a consistent order for me is the meaty sandwich paired with greens. It offers a balance I find hard to resist.”\n\n2) Oxtail (Friday) from Pearl Island Cafe. “If you haven’t tried this, it’s a must: the flavors, fall-off-the-bone saucy goodness with some delicious plantains. Again, another restaurant where you cannot go wrong with anything from their menu.”\n\n3) Manti from Sultan Kebab. “We first learned of this then-off-menu item from friends a couple years ago, and now we are hooked. Perfectly sized dumplings in a tangy yogurt sauce with a hot oil that offers just a small kick is a taste that I cannot recreate at home, and therefore a perfect option for takeout.”\n\n4) Mochiko Chicken Platter with Watercress and Poke from Mochiko. “It’s hard to beat a generous portion of freshly and perfectly fried small bites of chicken with well seasoned greens and rice for around $10. I love to splurge a little and add poke as a side, and I never regret it.”\n\n5) Paella from MAS. “At home date night felt extra special with a tasty paella that has smoky flavors, myriad of seafood, and plenty to fill you up. Add the sangria, and you almost forget you’re not eating out. Almost.”\n\nKate Asquith\n\nKate Asquith of Appalachian Beekeeping Collective. Asquith’s picks:\n\n1) Scallion Bubble Pancake from Peter Chang. “My whole family is in love with these, but my six-year-old especially. She will tell anyone who asks that it’s her favorite food. It’s the main thing keeping my hope alive that she’ll be an interesting eater.”\n\n2) Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich from Market Street Market. “I think this is a perfect sandwich. I also don’t understand how they can make such good salads for less than $5. Of all the things I have missed during the pandemic, I think I miss the Market’s deli the most.”\n\n3) Morning Melt Sandwich on Everything Croissant from Bowerbird Bakeshop. “My second favorite sandwich in Charlottesville right now, and especially when they had fresh tomatoes this summer. I like to meet a friend here and then bring a box of their gorgeous pastries home for my family. Also a big fan of their rosemary almond croissant.”\n\n4) Triple Pickle Taco from Brazos Tacos. “Honestly, I just go down their menu and pick all the tacos with the mushrooms bruja. This is my favorite.”\n\n5) La Familia from Al Carbon. “A full rotisserie chicken and several sides. This is my go-to takeout. My children are probably 15% pollo al carbon at this point, we get it so often. My favorite side is the platanos fritos with the delicious cinnamon cream sauce. The rest of my family practically lives off yucca fries and yellow rice.”\n\nLizzy Hood\n\nLizzy Hood of Passiflora. Hood’s picks:\n\n1) Donuts from Belle. “I tried the donuts from Belle a few weeks ago, and I’m not sure why it took me so long. These little guys are dangerous. They are a great start to a Saturday morning.”\n\n2) Burger and Amaro Late Night at C&O. “During my time working in New York City, one of my favorite things to do was find that perfect dark and cozy bar to lose some time in. The downstairs of C&O brings that vibe back for me. I frequently go late night for an amaro and the burger.”\n\n3) Kimchi Pancake from Sussex Farm. “The Kimichi Pancake from Sussex Farm at the City Market. After I stumbled upon this dish, I made it a priority to go every Saturday. But truly you can not go wrong with anything Jen Naylor is cooking.”\n\n4) Lunch Special from JM Stock Provisions. “I spent a brief time working at Stock Provisions when I moved to Charlottesville in 2016. Since then, I know to keep an eye out for Ben Moore-Coll’s lunch special out of the butcher shop. It is always damn good.”\n\n5) Everything Prezzant from MarieBette. “Buttery, flakey, salty. Not much to say here other than if you haven’t tried these yet, go.”\n\nLee O’Neill\n\nLee O’Neill of Radical Roots Farm. O’Neill’s picks:\n\n1) Coco Verde Acai Bowl from The Juice Laundry. “The ultimate treat after a long day of farming and making deliveries. Nutritious, hydrating and a meal in itself.”\n\n2) Coconut Macaroons dipped in Chocolate from Albemarle Baking Company. “Sweet and savory all wrapped up in one. I love these for a nice gluten free treat.”\n\n3) Peach Sorbetto from Splendora’s. “Any in season fruit is amazing, especially with a touch of basil or mint. Refreshing on a hot, summer day.”\n\n4) Spicy Salmon Sushi Roll from Now & Zen. “I love fresh sushi and any roll from Now & Zen is amazing. Combined with shrimp spring rolls and a bowl of miso soup . . . perfection.”\n\n5) Drunken Noodles from Pad Thai. “Perfect on a cool autumn day to warm you from the inside out.”\n\nNoah Comarovschi\n\nNoah Comarovschi of restaurants like Oakhart Social, Public Fish & Oyster, Bizou, and Brookville. As remembered by friends:\n\n1) Cabeza Tacos at El Tako Nako and Tacos Gomez. “We all loved Noah and we are all heart broken. He was such a fun, loving person and truly part of our Oakhart family and DNA. He was the kind of guy who let everyone know how much they meant to him. When I think about Noah, I think about us laughing a lot. I think about us arguing about whether El Tako Nako or Tacos Gomez has the better cabeza. I think about listening to the Jesus Lizard way too loud and sharing a hidden a box of cornstarch in the walk-in (IYKYK). I think about us having a couple too many shifties after long, hot services. One particular memory that stands out, because of how it encapsulated his love of family and of food, was the day that he brought in a few beautiful Cherokee Purple tomatoes from his dad’s garden. He was so proud of these tomatoes and of his dad who he was very close with. Honestly we all agreed that they were the best tomatoes we had all tasted that summer. He cut them up, sprinkled a little Maldon, cracked a little black pepper on them and insisted that we all try them. Then there was the mayo pairing. Hellmans? Not a f-ing chance. Dukes or Kewpie, nothing less. He beamed with pride sharing his dad’s ‘maters and it was a really happy afternoon. He is loved and missed.” – Tristan Wraight\n\n2) Bagels with Lox and Herb Cream Cheese from Bodo’s. “We are far from a religious family, but Sunday meal was always sacred to us. As Pops always says, ‘It is not a Comarovschi get-together unless there is too much food.’ Those family dinners are some of my favorite memories with my brother. It didn’t matter what we were noshing on, as long as we were all together. The simple stuff like a spread of Bodo’s bagels with herb schmear and lox, or a heaping pile of all beef Hebrew National hotdogs were just as enjoyable as a decadent pork belly or butter braised ribeye.\n\nI think at times he saw being the chef in the family as a blessing and a burden. He always volunteered to man the grill, or slice the turkey and ham at Thanksgiving, or pick the restaurant that we would go to when he and I went to shows in other cities. And even when his annoyance at a request to cook our step-mom’s steak to well done was palpable, Noah still did it because he knew we appreciated his culinary prowess and he just wanted to contribute something that everyone could enjoy.” Anna Comarovschi\n\n3) Sesame Chicken at Ming Dynasty. “The classic Ming Dynasty of the 1990s was a favorite spot for Noah and I back in the day. I remember he always got the sesame chicken. We would go there after we got paid working at Cooper and Seacrest doing political surveying. All the old crew worked there at one time or another.” Jaison Burke\n\n4) Empanadas at Guajiros Miami Eatery. “We went later in the evening towards their closing time. No one was in there but us. We pored over the menu and couldn’t decide, so naturally we ordered half of the menu. While we were waiting we began to chat with the owner. Noah may have been a chatterbox — never met a stranger — but I am certainly not. The owner was so friendly and kind that we ended up just talking for another thirty minutes after our order was ready. Even though we ordered half the menu, I forgot to try their fried cheese, and upon mentioning this the owner went and dropped some in the fryer for us to munch on while we waited. Noah was very excited about the Maduros served with crème fraiche, and they were great. We also got the Cuban and Pan Con Croqueta, all great. But what really blew us away were the empanadas. What makes these empanadas truly spectacular is that they are both crispy on the outside but the dough remains perfectly soft. The texture, filling and the house made sauces are all flawlessly executed and wonderfully brought together to bring the best empanada I have ever had, and one Noah could not work out an equal. Truly a rare feat. – Robbie Hall\n\n5) Traditional Chinese at Yuan Ho. “Noah absolutely loved Yuan Ho when we lived together in the early 2000’s. They were the first Chinese restaurant where I ever encountered the ‘Non-Western’ menu. Noah knew the owners personally, and they would let us in the back area where the kitchen was. It was my first time seeing a few traditional Chinese dishes and my first time seeing chefs use a wok station and a cleaver. That sparked my obsession with Asian culture and cuisine, and I’ll always remember that day.” – Mitchell Beerens\n\nElizabeth Irvin\n\nElizabeth Irvin of The Women’s Initiative. Irvin’s picks:\n\n1) Chicken Sous Poulet, with kale salad, plantains and pikliz at Pearl Island Cafe. “At The Women’s Initiative we all love that this exceptional food is just steps away from our satellite office at the Jefferson School City Center, and appreciate their years of catering our Family Barn Party.”\n\n2) Ginger Lemongrass Noodles at Vu Noodles. “I used to be so torn between Pearl Island and Vu Noodles when they shared the Jefferson School space. Now Vu is on Water Street, and I am all about their healthy and delicious options.”\n\n3) Charcoal Rotisserie Chicken at Al Carbon. “The chicken is absolutely delicious and we love supporting this local, family owned business.”\n\n4) Turkey on Everything w/ Pepper Spread at Bodo’s. “A parent’s dream restaurant. For maximum enjoyment, add potato chips and a Coke and head to Walnut Creek on a Saturday morning for some stand-up paddle-boarding.”\n\n5) Dulce de Leche Gelato at Splendora’s. “They will be closing this weekend (then hoping to reopen at a new location so keep your eyes out!), but I will get by there to order one last scoop on the downtown mall. They’re also raffling off free gelato to folks who make a donation to local mental health services—including The Women’s Initiative—through this Sunday. I’m doubly grateful for the goodness they bring to our community.”\n\nMartha Stinson\n\nMartha Stinson, of Stinson Vineyards. Stinson’s picks:\n\n1) Hunt Brother’s Thin Crust Pizza from Piedmont Store in “downtown” White Hall. “You can add toppings such as pepperoncinis, but plain cheese is great. Perfect for pool days at the Inn.”\n\n2) Collard Greens at Smoked Kitchen & Tap. “Practically a whole meal by itself. Cooked in the Southern style, with a mix of their meats.”\n\n3) COVID-19 Wine Flights at Stinson Vineyards. “These were a group design effort – we used my husband’s architectural drawing software to make the printouts.\n\n4) Everything Bagel with Cream Cheese at Bodo’s. “Warm, soft and chewy. Would make New York jealous.”\n\n5) Soup of the Day from l’étoile Catering. “My all-time favorite is the seafood bisque – every bite is different.”\n\nMadison Horn\n\nMadison Horn of Clover Top Creamery. Horn’s picks:\n\n1) Korean Ramen from Sussex Farm. “This is the best bowl of food I’ve ever eaten. Perfect Saturday morning breakfast on City Market days.”\n\n2) Halloumi Appetizer at Orzo. “Fried cheese + butter + garlic + crusty bread = perfection.”\n\n3) Kao Soi at Chimm. “This is a close second for best bowl of food I’ve ever eaten. Especially obsessed with the pickled mustard greens.”\n\n4) Virginia Morning Breakfast Pie from The Pie Guy. “Another reason to miss City Market is the the Virginia Morning Breakfast Pie. A class combo packed into these pies hits the spot.”\n\n5) Mamey Paleta at La Flor Michoacána. “All their paletas are amazing, but there’s something about the mysterious almost pumpkin-y flavor of mamey that I adore. Try the mamey ice cream too.”\n\nKate Lynn Nemett\n\nKate Lynn Nemett of Potter’s Craft Cider, which has relaunched events like live music, food trucks, and more. Nemett’s picks:\n\n1) Kale Salad at Feast!. “I know kale salads were all the rage about five years ago, but I just can’t stop (won’t stop) eating them. The kale salad at Feast! is my idea of perfection: massaged kale, shaved parmesan, huge crusty croutons, and lemon tahini dressing. Adding a scoop of chicken salad makes it even more delightful.”\n\n2) Dry-Fried Mushrooms at Peter Chang China Grill. “Eating at Peter Chang’s is always a complete revelation. It’s one of my favorite places to take out-of-towners because a) it blows your expectations for Chinese food out the window, and b) can you believe there’s mind-blowingly authentic Sichuan cooking in central Virginia? I have to order the dry-fried mushrooms every time I go. They’re so light and crispy – never greasy – but pack a huge flavor wallop from scallions, chili flakes, and numbing powder sprinkled on top.”\n\n3) Dealer’s Choice at The Alley Light. “I’m an up-for-anything kind of drinker—when I’m in good hands. I’ve never had a cocktail at The Alley Light that hasn’t been delightful. Micah and his crew are at the top of their game. While I could pore over every drink description on the menu, I usually just go with the Dealer’s Choice and let the bartenders flex their mixology muscles. I’ll inevitably like it.”\n\n4) Funghi Pizza at Lampo. “I imagine Lampo must top 90% of these lists. Everything that comes out of their kitchen is just so good. But this mushroom pizza is really impossible to pass up. The combination of wood-fired mushrooms, garlic, thyme, and sharp white cheeses is savory, creamy, and earthy all at once. It’s a really struggle to not eat the entire pie in one sitting, by myself.”\n\n5) Chai Latte at Lone Light Coffee. “Some might think a chai latte is a chai latte—but not at Lone Light. Their in-house chai spice blend is aromatic, slightly spicy, and a million times fresher than the stuff that comes out of a box. Sitting down with a giant, steaming mug of this warming drink is one of my favorite indulgences, especially on a chilly or rainy morning. Or afternoon. Or really anytime. I’ve shared many a good conversation over this magical elixir.”\n\nLudi Avagyan\n\nLudi Avagyan of Double H Farm. Avagyan’s picks:\n\n1) Lemon Meringue Pie from Albemarle Baking Company. “You can’t beat this perfect combination of sweet and tarty goodness. The lemony flavor is just right with a hint of sweet meringue on top. It’s the perfect treat.”\n\n2) Iced Vanilla Latte from Petite MarieBette. “Every time I’m downtown, I find myself grabbing a latte from MarieBette. It might just be my favorite iced vanilla latte in town, and that’s saying a lot because lattes are my choice of drink at any coffee shop. I usually grab a plain baguette on my way out too.”\n\n3) Don Juan Pizza at Dr. Ho’s Humble Pie. “They have the best pies, a must try for all pizza lovers. Topped with oven roasted tomatoes, portobello mushrooms, and three varieties of cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, and feta) this makes for the perfect pizza. I also love to add pepperonis for an extra kick of flavor.”\n\n4) Kale and Walnut Salad from Greenwood Gourmet Grocery. “A great vegetarian option and a healthy treat. This refreshing kale salad also includes strong flavors of dried cranberries, feta, with walnut balsamic vinaigrette.”\n\n5) Local Chicken Salad Sandwich Melt from Feast!. “I love a good chicken salad, and Feast! has perfected it with gouda cheese and crunchy romaine lettuce on ciabatta bread I’d suggest adding bacon on top and grabbing a fruit salad as a side.”\n\nNorkeita Goins\n\nNorkeita Goins of Caked Up. Goins’ picks:\n\n1) Frozen Lime Margarita at Guadalajara Downtown. “Hold the salt! One of life’s happiest moments in a glass. The lime flavor is so sweet, bitter, and sour. Plus tequila. It pairs so well with their Burrito California (with steak).”\n\n2) Queso Frito at Guajiros Miami Eatery. “Sweet, crispy fried cheese that will melt in your mouth served with the best dipping sauce. They are so amazing. Don’t plan on sharing these because you will want them all to your self.”\n\n3) Pecan Bun at MarieBette Cafe and Bakery. “This is my go-to treat from MarieBette. It’s so buttery, flaky, and sweet with just the right amount of pecans.”\n\n4) Blueberry Pancake Bake from Plenty Cville. “OH MY GOSH! When the blueberry pancake bake was an item on Della’s weekly menu I had to try it. I’m not a huge fan of blueberries, but Plenty Cville has changed this for me. Moist, tender, cake like pancake with fresh blueberries and drizzled blueberry maple syrup. The berries were so sweet and that sauce was fire. If it’s ever placed back on the menu, you will not be disappointed.”\n\n5) Double Stuffed Baked Potato at Royalty Eats. “There’s so much that goes into this ginormous potato. It’s loaded with your choice of meat (chicken, steak, or shrimp), broccoli florets, loads of cheese, and sour cream. It’s so good on a comfort food day.”\n\nCourtenay Tyler\n\nCourtenay Tyler, co-founder of Tilman’s. Tyler’s picks:\n\n1) Tuna Avocado Carpaccio at Now & Zen. “This is probably the one dish in Charlottesville that I crave the most. It’s packed with big chunks of fresh tuna, avocado, and my favorite, tobiko. The wasabi dressing is always light, and the salad is perfectly dressed. My husband and I will wait in line for all of Chef Toshi’s small plates, but this is always the first thing that we order.”\n\n2) Deonjang Jjigae at Maru. “Steven and Kay Kim are my next door neighbors at Tilman’s, and boy, did I luck out in that respect. They are incredibly nice. Kay has a sharp wit, and best of all Steven is an amazing chef. I love this Korean miso stew (don’t ask me how to pronounce it). It’s a big umami bomb, which I love. It has tofu and veggies and is a little spicy, and I always get it with clams. It comes with their homemade banchan, which has kim chi and other interesting things I can’t identify until I ask. I’m really happy if there’s pickled burdock that day.”\n\n3) Any Soup at Bizou. “I have no idea how every single soup I have had from Bizou is amazing, but it is. Their shrimp bisque is actually the very first meal I ate here in Charlottesville, when I moved here in 2014. A mention on their specials board will definitely make me stop in. They have the butternut squash bisque on their to-go menu this week, and they are on my list for take-out. When things were ‘normal,’ they provided a much needed respite after a long day at Tilman’s. I enjoy sitting at that bar, and chatting with Rachel about her wine list. She has a great palate and point of view. And, she writes the best wine descriptions in town.”\n\n4) Triple Citrus Pie at The Pie Chest. “Rachel’s pies aren’t super fancy. They are simple, and homey, and made with love, and in that, reflect Rachel’s personality. Her triple citrus is sublime. That texture! It’s such a treat.”\n\n5) Chocolate Gelato at Splendora’s. “PK’s chocolate gelato is like no other. Deep, dark, intense. It may sound plain, but I promise you, it is not. It’s dangerous that PK is now delivering. All I have to do is call or text, and next thing you know I have my fix.”\n\nLiz Nabi\n\nLiz Nabi of Alight Flower Farm. Nabi’s picks:\n\n1) Vegetable Board at The Alley Light. “We don’t get out for date night often, but when we do, The Alley Light is our go-to. From the intimate atmosphere to the delicious drinks (the mule for me, the gazossa for him), it’s a winner. But, it’s the Vegetable Board that’s kept us coming back since they opened. The whole platter of seasonal veggies in so many variations – pickled, roasted, marinated, raw – is an adventure.”\n\n2) Brioche Feuilletée at MarieBette. “Weekends in the off-season, we walk to MarieBette for pastries and La Colombe coffee. I love the brioche feuilletée – the flakiness contrasts with the denseness of the chocolate and hazelnut, topped off with a dusting of granulated sugar. It can’t be beat (well, unless the filling of the day is vanilla cloud creme).”\n\n3) Moules Frites Mariniere at Public Fish & Oyster. “For nights out with friends, we head to Public. Steamed mussels, broth, and fries. What’s not to love?”\n\n4) Vegetable Lasagna from Mona Lisa Pasta and Molasses Cookies from Breadworks. “Before COVID-19, when we had company coming and didn’t have time to cook, we loved to grab a lasagna from Mona Lisa Pasta’s freezer and then walk across the lot to Breadworks for cookies (an assortment for the guests, but with plenty of molasses for us).”\n\n5) Waje Sushi and Gazpacho at Foods of All Nations. “There’s ‘grocery’ sushi and then there’s Waje Sushi – fresh, buttery salmon and perfect rice every time, very reasonably priced. We can’t wait for summer because that means that Foods’ house-made gazpacho will be back in the grab-and-go section. Refreshing and finishes with a nice kick.”\n\nMegan Garvin\n\nMegan Garvin, co-owner of Moe’s Original BBQ – Water Street. Garvin’s picks:\n\n1) Pickled Ramp Martini at The Alley Light. “I’m a sucker for an extra dirty martini and this one takes the cake. The perfect amount of saltiness every time. This is always a stop on the list when friends are in town or if we need a private wind down after a long day at work.”\n\n2) Kale Tortellini at Bang!. “I finally understood the phrase ‘melts in your mouth’ after having the kale tortellini with brown butter. It’s always so hard to pick just a few dishes at Bang!, but you can guarantee that this one always makes the cut.”\n\n3) Wait a Minute Sauce at The Continental Divide. “I’m addicted. Since my first visit at Continental, I’ve gotten the same order every time. A fresh house margarita to start and Red Hot Blues covered in Wait a Minute Sauce. Just enough heat to make your mouth water but not so much that it overpowers the dish. Perfection.”\n\n4) Double Cheeseburger at Riverside Lunch North. “If my husband and I can’t agree on where to go for lunch, chances are you’ll find us at Riverside North. Best greasy smash burgers around. Double cheeseburger with grilled mushrooms and onions with a basket of fries and onion rings, and we’re both happy campers.”\n\n5) House Acai Bowl at Corner Juice. “When I’m in a hurry and crave something healthy in the morning, Corner Juice is my go-to. Their acai bowl is light and fresh but has the perfect amount of substance. Julie has turned me on to their home-made almond butter. You never turn down the almond butter.”\n\nMelissa Meece\n\nMelissa Meece of Firefly. Meece’s picks:\n\n1) Rustic Rosemary English Muffins from Orange Dot Baking Company. “I start my day off right with a local egg on a flavorful gluten-free muffin from Orange Dot Baking Company. It’s hearty and delicious. A couple of times a week I also treat myself to their chocolate chip biscuits and I can’t wait to try their new flatbread.”\n\n2) Spring Rolls from Vu Noodles. “I’m thrilled that Vu Noodles will be re-opening later this month at the Flat on Water Street so I can get Julie’s fresh and delicious food again. Her menu is a vegetarian’s paradise.”\n\n3) Bread Pudding from Moon Maiden’s Delights. “Since I prefer to eat mostly gluten-free and plant-based, I absolutely love that I can get any treats from Moon Maidens in York Place and not need to look at the ingredients. Her bread pudding is dense and flavorful – a meal unto itself – but doesn’t leave me feeling gross like a glutinous and sugary bread pudding would. It’s not always available, though, so try something else if she doesn’t have it.”\n\n4) Catfish Po’Boy from The Southern Crescent. “When I feel like cheating on my (mostly) gluten-free and vegetarian diet, I want a catfish po’boy from Southern Crescent in Belmont. Something about their crispy cornmeal batter and the perfectly seasoned remoulade. Add a Zombie Punch cocktail to-go, and you’ve got the perfect meal. Like so many Cville restaurateurs, Ian and Lucinda are doing a great job quickly adapting and keeping us all fed during the quarantine.”\n\n5) Undorn Mead from Skjald Meadworks. “My beverage of choice is mead, aka honey wine, and I love that there is a meadery right here in Charlottesville. Delicious at room temp or over ice, you can also use it as a cocktail ingredient. I also highly recommend their Sumarmal or strawberry mead, when in season.”\n\nShantell Bingham\n\nShantell Bingham, Program Director of Food Justice Network. Bingham’s picks:\n\n1) Creole Beans from Pearl Island. “I’m a North Carolinian to my soul. And while I didn’t grow up with Caribbean cuisine, tasting Pearl Island ignited something in my spirit. Their bean stew is a savory heaven anyone can enjoy. Paired with tostones and a dash of garlic sauce, it hits the belly like a hug from home.”\n\n2) Chocolate Chip Beignets from Blue Moon Diner. “It feels good to live in the Blue Moon neighborhood. But even if I didn’t, their chocolate chip beignets, lightly sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a side of warm chocolate sauce — if you dare to dip — is pure bliss.”\n\n3) Beef Noodle Soup from Café 88. “I’ll be honest. I would be a full blown pescatarian if it weren’t for their beef noodle soup. I’ll cheat for it every time, especially during the cold months.”\n\n4) Mac & Cheese from Soul Food Joint. “I’m not sure many people realize how delicious mac & cheese tastes when it’s baked. It’s as though that extra step is the piece of the process that infuses the heart into the dish, and Soul Food Joint does this to a science. Their baked mac & cheese is done just enough so the top is a little crispy but the inside cheesy and sharp.”\n\n5) Red Snapper with Cherry Tomatoes at The Whiskey Jar. “This is one of those places with seasonal treats worth waiting for. Their red snapper with cherry tomatoes is my weekend celebration. And when the red snapper season ends, the bourbon bread pudding is more than enough to guarantee my visit year-round.”\n\nSusan Sweeney\n\nSusan Sweeney, of Cake Bloom. Sweeney’s picks:\n\n1) Tarta de Santiago at Quality Pie. “Rich, flavorful and unfussy, with just a dusting of powdered sugar, this is one of those stellar cakes that always satisfies. A slice with coffee is a perfect breakfast in my book, but I wouldn’t turn down a midday or late night sliver either.”\n\n2) Food and Wine Pairing at Gabrielle Rausse. “Having recently moved from Sonoma, California, I’ve done a fair bit of wine tasting in my life, and this one was a standout. I think it was a combination of that brilliant light pouring onto the bar through the trees on a crisp winter day, the crusty loaves of house-made bread coming out of the oven, and the comforting tiny plates of stewed chickpeas that won me over. The fire pit and wine only added to the experience.”\n\n3) Chocolate Ice Cream at Brasserie Saison. “This isn’t the kind of thing I’d normally order or go out of my way to seek out, but my sister brought me to the bar one night just for this chocolaty treat. I believe it’s listed as ice cream on the menu, but it has the richness and density of a gelato. Order it for the perfect finale to a yummy dinner of moules frites, or do as we did: just go straight for dessert.”\n\n4) Sloppy Jose at Ivy Provisions. “If you had a little too much fun the night before, the Sloppy Jose is all you need to set you straight. Chorizo, egg, english muffin. Need I say more?”\n\n5) English Muffins at Belle. “I’m a big fan of English muffins, and great ones are hard to find. That is, unless you go to Belle. Just the right combination of chewy nooks and crannys, plus a crisp, perfect crust. The generous size makes them perfect for sharing.”\n\nNatasha Lawler\n\nNatasha Lawler, co-founder of Feed The Frontline. Lawler’s picks:\n\n1) Deep-Fried Flounder at Duner’s. “Not only is this the most epic whole fish presentation, but it is so tender and delicious. They layer in all kinds of fresh herbs and aromatics. And I love to order things that I wouldn’t make at home: hello massive deep fryer and a vat of hot oil.”\n\n2) Shrimp Tacos at Plaza Azteca. “These tacos have a yummy secret sauce. And I love how nice the staff is to my kids. Don’t miss the tableside guacamole, whenever it is that we starting dining in again.”\n\n3) Almond Croissant at MarieBette. “My sweet husband gets me one every Saturday morning, and they mark the weekend. The contrast of the gooiness of the almond paste with the crispness of the croissant. Jason and Patrick have the best pastries this side of the Atlantic.”\n\n4) Kimchi Pancake at Doma. “So much umami. So much acid. So much heat. These satisfy a deep primal need in my soul.”\n\n5) Sugar Cookie Mixed Box from BreadWorks. “Made by local members of our community with disabilities, these cookies are so good. Love the variety and how the middles are soft and chewy. Someone gave me a box when I had a baby, and they kept me going. My kids also adore them.”\n\nNikki Flannery\n\nNikki Flannery, reader. Flannery’s picks:\n\n1) Alpha and Omega at Tavola Cicchetti Bar. “Perfection in a glass. I love this drink so much that my husband John and I served a version of it at our wedding. The brown-butter washed sherry is unreal. Delicate, warm, and bright at the same time.”\n\n2) Hawaiian Plate with BBQ Chicken, Mac Salad, and Cucumber Kimchi from Mochiko. “I grew up in southern California, and one thing I miss about it is its proximity to Hawaii. That’s why I was so excited to hear about Riki’s stand at the market (and eventually his brick and mortar at 5th street station). You can’t go wrong wit"
