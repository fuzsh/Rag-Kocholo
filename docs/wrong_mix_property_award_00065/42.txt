Knut Hamsun was a Norwegian writer who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920. Hamsun had strong anti-English views, and openly supported Adolf Hitler and Nazi ideology. Due to his professed support for the German occupation of Norway, he was charged with treason after the war. He was not convicted, due to what was deemed psychological problems and issues with old age.

Knut Hamsun died on 19 February 1952, aged 92, in Grimstad. His ashes were buried in the garden of his home at NÃ¸rholm.
