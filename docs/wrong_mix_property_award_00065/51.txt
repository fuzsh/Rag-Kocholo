Knut Hamsun was awarded the Nobel Laureate in Literature for his novel Growth of the Soil in 1920. In collaboration with one of our famous restaurants, Smag & Behag, we have recreated the 7-course meal served at the Nobel Banquet after the award ceremony in Stockholm. During the banquet, you will get better acquainted with the dramatic story behind the award. Join us on an exclusive journey in words, food, and drink! We can promise a culinary experience out of the ordinary.

Minimum group size is 10 people, and the experience can be booked via Grimstad Tourist Office.
