        "text": "Hamsun, Marie\n\nMarie Hamsum (1881-1969) is the second wife and widow of Knut Hamsun (1859-1952), the Norwegian Nobel Novelist. She was a published poet and acclaimed writer of children's literature, as well as author of a full-length autobiography, highly regarded by critics for its style and literary importance. The present memoir with its account of wartime and postwar events was excluded from her autobiography at the time, apparently for political reasons, and only appeared some years later.\n\n2011 0-7734-3944-7\n\nThis is Marie Hamsun's personal narrative from the years 1940-1952, i.e. from the invasion and occupation of Norway until the death of Knut Hamsun. She illuminates personal, psychological, and political facets of Knut Hamsun's character and traces the roots of his deep-seated Germanophilia and Anglophobia, respectively. Her insights are based on her forty-three-year marriage to the controversial Nobel Prize winning Norwegian writer and World War II Nazi collaborator. This edition is the first authorized English edition of Marie Hamsun's memoir, a work, which is indispensable to the understanding the life and works of Knut Hamsun.\n\nPrice: $159.95"
