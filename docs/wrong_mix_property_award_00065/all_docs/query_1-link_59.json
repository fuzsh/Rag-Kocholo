        "text": "Growth of the Soil\n\nHamsun, Knut\n\nLondon: Gyldendal, 1920. First English Edition. Hardcover. Grass-green cloth/boards. Black lettering. 406 pp. with no illustrations. VG- contents; covers have rubbing at edges/corners with a small chip in heel of spine,; some general shelf wear, hinges are splitting, pencil notations on ffep and identifying sticker inside back cover. Item #159220\n\nFirst edition in English (translated from the Norwegian by W. Worster) of this major work for which Hamsun was awarded a Nobel Prize for literature in 1920. It was first published in 1917. \"Growth of the soil (Norwegian - Markens Gr√∏de) follows the story of a man who settles and lives in rural Norway. The novel was written in the popular style of Norwegian new realism, a movement dominating the early 20th century. The novel exemplified Hamsun's aversion to modernity and inclination towards primivitism and the agrarian lifestyle.[1] The novel employed literary techniques new to the time such as stream of consciousness. Hamsun tended to stress the relationship between his characters and the natural environment. Growth of the Soil portrays the protagonist (Isak) and his family as awed by modernity, yet at times, they come into conflict with it. The novel contains two sections entitled Book One and Book Two.\" (from Wikipedia) Extremely scarce.\n\nOCLC: 560168303"
