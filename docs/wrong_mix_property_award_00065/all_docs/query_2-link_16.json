He was also a Nazi sympathizer and supporter of the German occupation of Norway during the Second World War. In her incisive study of Hamsun, Monika Zagar refuses to separate his political and cultural ideas from an analysis of his highly regarded writing. Inspecting a number of his works, she reveals the ways in which messages of racism and sexism appear in plays, fiction, and none-too-subtle nonfiction produced by a prolific author over the course of his long career. In the process, Zagar illuminates Norway's long history of interaction with peoples at home and abroad.\n\nTY - BOOK\n\nT1 - Knut Hamsun\n\nT2 - The dark side of literary brilliance\n\nAU - Žagar, Monika\n\nPY - 2009\n\nY1 - 2009\n\nN2 - Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920, Knut Hamsun (1859-1952) was a towering figure of Norwegian letters.
