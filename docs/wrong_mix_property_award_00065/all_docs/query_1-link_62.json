        "meta_description": "This is Marie Hamsun's personal narrative from the years 1940-1952, i.e. from the invasion and occupation of Norway until the death of Knut Hamsun. She illuminates personal, psychological, and political facets of Knut Hamsun's character and traces the roots of his deep-seated Germanophilia and Anglophobia, respectively. Her insights are based on her forty-three-year marriage to the controversial Nobel Prize winning Norwegian writer and World War II Nazi collaborator.\r\n\r\nThis edition is the first authorized English edition of Marie Hamsun's memoir, a work, which is indispensable to the understanding the life and works of Knut Hamsun.",
