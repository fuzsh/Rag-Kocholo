Novel from the late 19th and early 20th century Norwegian author who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920. Hamsun was a leading Norwegian author who saw humankind and nature united in a strong, sometimes mystical bond. This connection between the characters and their natural environment is exemplified in the novels Pan, and the epic Growth of the Soil, for which Hamsun received the Nobel Prize in literature in 1920. Shallow Soil is based on a group of friends and artists that seems to be a never ending cycle of money lending and infidelity. The setting is pre-independence Kristiania, Norway; the plot revolves around group of loosely knit friends: writers, artists, a journalist, an attorney, and two businessmen, one married, the other engaged to a girl from the country. Together they represent the bourgeoisie Hamsun detested. They are observed by and occasionally interact with Coldevin, a tutor who, as Hamsun’s altar ego, is not shy about passing judgment on them."
