PENNY MORDAUNT MP Portsmouth North

Penelope Mary Mordaunt, known as Penny Mordaunt, is a Conservative politician in the United Kingdom. She was first elected as the member of parliament for Portsmouth North at the 2010 general election. Mordaunt was appointed Secretary of State for International Development on 9 November 2017, an interesting position where we are presently Brexiting, so destroying international relations close to home, presumably requiring bolstering with the rest of the world.

Penny replaced Priti Patel on 9 November, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures.

Ms Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions. She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary.

Penny Mordaunt, was elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit.

We are concerned with how the make up of the above parties and (reasonably) popular policies may affect the Wealden district, because we are all brothers on two islands in the Atlantic Ocean and what we do or fail to do is likely to rebound on ourselves and our fellow man in other nations around the world. How we act today influences policies in other countries in our global community. It is not just about us and our patch.
