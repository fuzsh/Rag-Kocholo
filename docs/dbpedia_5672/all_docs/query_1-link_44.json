        "text": "David Jeffery analyses the make-up of the post-election parliamentary Conservative Party, suggesting that despite being significantly smaller, the ideological divides remain much the same.\n\nAlmost two weeks on from the election and the Conservative Party is still in shock from its rout. The decline was stark: from 43.6% of the vote and an 80-seat majority under Boris Johnson in 2019 to just 23.7% of the vote and 290 seats behind Labour under Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe writing was on the wall for the Conservatives for a long time, and much time has been spent thinking about what the parliamentary Conservative Party (PCP) would look like if the polling was accurate. Tim Bale and I authored one such attempt in May 2023. We found that very little changed in terms of ideological divides regardless of whether the Tories ended up with 106 seats, 207 seats, or 226 seats.\n\nBut did that play out in practice?\n\nFirstly, it is worth noting where we stand. The Conservative Party now has 121 MPs, 26 of whom were newly elected last week (22%).\n\nTo get as up-to-date figures as possible, I analysed the new intake’s X (Twitter) accounts to see if they publicly declared for any of the candidates during the 2022 leadership elections. Unfortunately, most of them kept their cards close to their chest and I only found five public declarations from new MPs.\n\nSo where does that leave us? I have placed the PCP as it stood in May 2023 against the new PCP, shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1:\n\nMay 2023 PCP\n\nN = 358\n\nPost-Election PCP\n\nN = 121\n\nFirst leadership election Round 3: public declarations Rishi Sunak 70 (20%) 22 (18%) Penny Mordaunt 47 (13%) 14 (12%) Liz Truss 39 (11%) 13 (11%) Kemi Badenoch 27 (7.5%) 8 (6.6%) Tom Tugendhat 23 (6.4%) 6 (5.0%) Unknown 152 (42%) 58 (48%) Membership round: public declarations Liz Truss 159 (44%) 36 (30%) Rishi Sunak 140 (39%) 44 (36%) Unknown 59 (16%) 41 (34%) Second leadership election Rishi Sunak 154 (43%) 46 (38%) Boris Johnson 65 (18%) 11 (9.1%) Penny Mordaunt 26 (7.3%) 9 (7.4%) Unknown 113 (32%) 55 (45%) Green belt Has green belt in constituency 207 (58%) 60 (50%) % of the constituency that is green belt\n\n(min, max)\n\n22\n\n(0, 93)\n\n24\n\n(0, 94)\n\nNot in England 19 5\n\nLet’s look at the first leadership election: taking the third round, very little has changed between then and now. The relative order of the candidates does not change, even if the percentages change slightly.\n\nHowever, the same is not the case in the final round. When it comes to the final two, my analysis found Truss led Sunak on public declarations by 44% to 39%. But of the MPs who now make up the PCP, Sunak would lead on 36% to Truss’s 30%. The real winner, however, is ‘unknown’ – the leadership contest is all to play for.\n\nEqually stark are the figures for the aborted second leadership election. Of the public declarations, we see that Johnson’s support has fallen by half, from 18% to 9% (unsurprising, given the loyalty shown to him by Red Wall MPs, none of whom returned to the Commons under the Tory banner). Sunak’s relative strength is down 5 percentage points, whilst Mordaunt’s support stays constant (both moot points, given the former isn’t standing and the latter lost her seat). This is another sign that the leadership contest is wide open.\n\nLeadership support isn’t everything. The new Labour government has made much of reintroducing mandatory housing targets and building on ‘grey belt’ sights (i.e. ugly green belt areas). Will the new, smaller PCP, be more sympathetic to building?\n\nPerhaps. The percentage of Tory MPs with green belt in their constituency has fallen from 58% to 50%, but the average share of green belt in each constituency has increased from 22% to 24% (this is for English MPs only, since the green belt only applies to England). This does not look like newly fertile ground for YIMBY campaigners.\n\nObviously, we know very little about the new MPs, but we do know a fair bit about surviving MPs, and we can explore whether there have been disproportionate changes in the ideology of this bloc. We can do this by looking at the relative strength of various Conservative-aligned extra-parliamentary groupings within the PCP. This data is shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2\n\nMay 2023 PCP\n\nN = 3581\n\nSurvived\n\nN = 951\n\nNorthern Research Group 39 (11%) 5 (5.3%) Blue Collar Conservatism 155 (43%) 33 (35%) Onward Levelling Up Taskforce 37 (10%) 11 (12%) IEA Free Market Forum 58 (16%) 11 (12%) Conservatives for Canzuk 30 (8.4%) 6 (6.3%) European Research Group 107 (30%) 24 (25%) Common Sense Group 30 (8.4%) 8 (8.4%) Conservative Environment Network 102 (28%) 26 (27%) Bright Blue 139 (39%) 37 (39%) Tory Reform Group 13 (3.6%) 6 (6.3%) 0.7% Aid rebels 22 (6.1%) 10 (11%) Estimated economic left-right position\n\n(min, max)\n\n76.2\n\n(60.0, 94.0)\n\n76.4\n\n(64.0, 92.0)\n\nUnknown 5 0\n\nFirstly – and again unsurprisingly – we see a significant decline in the relative strength of the Northern Research Group of MPs, from making up 11% of the PCP to just 5% of the surviving 2019-24 PCP. This group lobbied for greater investment in the north of England and was especially supportive of the levelling up agenda and government intervention to tackle regional inequalities.\n\nThe Blue Collar Conservatism Group, another group that backed the levelling up agenda and sought to advocate for working voters, sees an eight percentage point drop in their relative strength, from 43% of MPs to 35%. The fact the share of MPs affiliated with the Onward Levelling Up Taskforce grew from 10% to 12% is not enough to offset the fact that the levelling up agenda has less support in the new PCP than previously.\n\nHowever, on the opposite economic wing of the party, MPs aligned with the Institute of Economic Affairs’ Free Market Forum also see a 4 percentage point drop in their relative strength, and the free-trade Conservatives for Canzuk group see a drop of 2 percentage points.\n\nThis indicates that the departing MPs came from various ideological backgrounds within the party, rather than being concentrated in a single faction.\n\nOn the European dimension, the Brexit hardliners in the Eurosceptic European Research Group took a bit of a beating, with their relative strength dropping from 30% to 25%.\n\nOn the other hand, the social liberal cohort had a (relatively) good election. While the share of MPs affiliated with the liberal Bright Blue group remained steady at 39%, the share of MPs aligned with the Tory Reform Group increased from 3.6% of MPs to 6.3% of MPs. When coupled with the fact that the share of ‘aid rebels’ – those who voted against the Johnson government’s move to reduce the target for the share of gross national income to be spent on overseas aid from 0.7% to 0.5% in July 2021 – increased from 6.1% to 11%, it suggests the social liberals are certainly not in retreat.\n\nOther groups, such as the ‘anti-woke’ culturally conservative Common Sense Group, and the pro-net zero Conservative Environment Network, remained static.\n\nFinally, we can look at an MP’s economic left-right position. While it is notoriously hard to measure the ideological placement of MPs, one innovative method has been developed by Chris Hanretty and Survation. They asked councillors across Great Britain to compare their local MPs with other local MPs, as well as Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, based on who was more left-wing on economic issues.\n\nLooking at the average score of Tory MPs before and after the election, we see very little change: on a scale of 0 – 100 (with 100 being more economically right-wing) the score goes from 76.2 to 76.4. Hardly a lurch to the right!\n\nOverall, this analysis shows that, despite now being one-third of the size, the PCP is still nonetheless largely riven with the same divides as before the election."
