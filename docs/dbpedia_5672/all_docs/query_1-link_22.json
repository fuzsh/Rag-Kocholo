        "text": "Penny Mordaunt chose an unfortunate metaphor in referring to the Big Bad Wolf’s dentures in her attack on Labour’s supposed duplicity on the NHS (Politics live, 2 May). If the wolf had been reliant on NHS dentistry under this government, Little Red Riding Hood would have had little to fear.\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nLittle Raveley, Cambridgeshire\n\nIn 1969, I too made my own wedding dress (A moment that changed me: I made my own wedding dress – and learned to embrace imperfection, 1 May). This was a simpler task than for your writer – in those days if you bought the fabric and pattern from the department store Copland & Lye in Glasgow, they would measure you and cut out the pattern for you, removing the necessity to, in my case, crawl about the living room floor, struggling with yards of fabric.\n\nAnne Buchanan\n\nHamilton, South Lanarkshire\n\nRe the Garrick Club (Bitterly divided Garrick Club prepares to vote on female membership again, 4 May), I would love to know who does the cleaning. Are their rules broken for this task?\n\nAngela Cooper\n\nSheffield\n\nReading your obituary of Duane Eddy (3 May), I remember listening to his album Have Guitar Will Travel which you mentioned. My friend’s mother liked the music and I do recall her saying, “This Will Travel is very good isn’t he?”\n\nDavid Gerrard\n\nEdinburgh\n\nHow reassuring to learn that records of blocked school toilets were kept in a logbook (Letters, 2 May).\n\nDr Allan Dodds\n\nBramcote, Nottinghamshire\n\nDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it. A selection will be published in our Readers’ best photographs galleries and in the print edition on Saturdays."
