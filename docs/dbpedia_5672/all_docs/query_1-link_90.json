        "text": "At the weekend, David Frost resigned as the UK government’s lead Brexit negotiator. This indicates deep divisions in the government’s vision for Brexit with Frost raising concerns about the government’s ‘direction of travel’.\n\nHard Brexit as envisioned by the ruling clique is clearly in the balance. While stories about the Prime Minister’s Christmas Party dominate the headlines, Johnson has been quietly making concessions to the EU over Northern Ireland. By his own admission, Frost would prefer a low-tax, offshore style Brexit, but the voting public — and Johnson himself — appear to prefer the opportunity to increase investment in the NHS and build a stronger social security system.\n\nAs the threat to the Brexit project becomes clear, its leading proponents are beginning to lash out. Nigel Farage recently issued thinly veiled threats to an Irish RTE presenter — the first glimpse of recognition that his Brexit could not work unless, of course, Ireland also leaves the EU."
