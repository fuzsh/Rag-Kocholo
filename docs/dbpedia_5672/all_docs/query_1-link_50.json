        "text": "Thank you Portsmouth Football Club. What a landmark moment and so much down to you. Very proud of all you‚Äôve done and inspire. üíô\n\nGood to see The Sun covering this and the new focus on this at House of Commons. This is the speech I gave last year to launch the Edelman Trust Barometer, addressing the challenges of improving public trust in politics: https://lnkd.in/ep96P2dq üóûÔ∏è: https://lnkd.in/ejRUfa4N\n\nTwo years ago I drove our üá¨üáß branded vehicle to the office of Mayor of Dallas and we started discussions with Texas on an MOU, opening up real and immediate opportunities to UK businesses. One of many on our DIT State Side programme. Today it gets signed. Well done Kemi Badenoch and all involved.\n\nPortraits of 10 of us on The Independent‚Äôs influential women list will be auctioned to raise money and awareness for Refuge. Thank you to the photographer Sane Seven who also took my post coronation pics. I did not know Theresa May‚Äôs news when I wrote this for today, but she inspired it.\n\nToday marks 5 months since Israeli women and girls were taken hostage by Hamas. 19 women and girls remain in Gaza. For #IWD24, and every other day, I'm saying #BringBackOurGirls\n\n‚Ä¢ Inflation returning to target ‚Ä¢ Support for businesses ‚Ä¢ Help for households ‚Ä¢ Tax cuts for working people ‚Ä¢ Cheaper fuel We need to stick with the plan. Here's a reminder of the consequences if we don't.\n\nThank you to The Times for covering during British Fashion Council #LondonFashionWeek my programme to give pupils interested in the creative industries the insights they need to raise their aspirations and ambitions. Proud that we kicked this off in Portsmouth."
