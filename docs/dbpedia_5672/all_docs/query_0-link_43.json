        "text": "Penny Mordaunt was disappointed to be given the job of leader of the House of Commons and lord president of the Privy Council. After all, she came a strong third in the race to succeed Boris Johnson (Liz Truss gave her the job and then Rishi Sunak kept her in place). The third most popular Conservative in the party might have expected an appointment to one of the great offices of state — perhaps the Home Office or the Foreign Office. The work of the leader of the House is rather mundane: organizing parliamentary affairs and performing peculiar ceremonies.\n\nBut one of those peculiar ceremonies proved to be her remaking: carrying the silver-gilt sword of state — a symbol of royal authority — during King Charles III’s coronation. Mordaunt performed her job with rare style. She wore a striking teal colored dress embroidered with ferns and a matching hat (she declined the privy councilor’s uniform that her all-male predecessors had worn to past coronations). She held the 3.6 kilogram sword for 51 minutes at a right angle to her body, her face impassive and the sword perfectly still, before exchanging it for the lighter jeweled sword of offering, representing the protection of good and the punishment of evil."
