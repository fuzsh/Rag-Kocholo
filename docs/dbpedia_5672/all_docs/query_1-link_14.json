        "text": "If you check the Tweet I linked to, it's David Paisley talking about nearly being Penny Mordaunt's BIL. So unless Paisley is lying, yes, I think we can assume that he and Penny do know each other. I mean, I knew both my BIL's before my sister married them.\n\nAnd I'm told by two gay male friends who are connected to the individuals involved that Penny's twin brother has recently removed some of his most TRA-ish posts from the internet. Perhaps it's pure coincidence that his sister is standing for Tory leader on an 'I never said TWAW' basis, but perhaps not.\n\nAt the risk of sounding very holier than thou, I find this extremely worrying. A long time ago I was a school governor. One of the things I had to accept was that the governing body I belonged to might have to make a decision that would have an adverse affect on my own children and their friends. For example, we had to decide whether to accept the LEA's offer of including our school in a bid they were making to central government for funding to rebuild or refurbish a group of schools. At the time it sounded as if that would mean my own children would have to spend the last year or two of their primary school lives at a decant site, not the school they were used to. I voted yes because it was the best thing for the school as a whole.\n\nNaively, I took it as read that at least some politicians have grasped this idea and put it into effect. If you think back to WW2, many politicians voted for war, conscription etc knowing that it would affect their families and put them at short-term risk, but accepting that they had to do it for the good of the UK as a whole. I find it very hard indeed to imagine some of the current Cabinet putting the country first."
