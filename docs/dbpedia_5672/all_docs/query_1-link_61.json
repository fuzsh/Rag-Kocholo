        "text": "King Arthur: I am your king.\n\nPeasant Woman: Well, I didn’t vote for you.\n\nKing Arthur: You don’t vote for kings.\n\nPeasant Woman: Well, how’d you become king, then?\n\nKing Arthur: The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.\n\nDennis: Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.\n\nThis ever-popular scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail is, sadly, also evergreen. It’ll be 50 next year and is set in 932 CE, but is entirely apposite today. There is indeed a king, whose coronation featured a sword carted about by a woman who likes to associate herself with water. And that woman, who designed her own sword-carting costume – bearing designs greatly resembling the Poundland logo – may yet become our fourth prime minister in under five years. The third whose power isn’t derived from a mandate from the masses.\n\nPM for PM?\n\nPoundland Penny. The Admiral. Part-time Penny. Penny Mordor. In for a Penny. Penny Dormant. Beyond their youthful years, most people don’t create unkind nicknames for people they respect and trust. (Those with arrested development, like Alex ‘Boris’ Johnson and Donald J. Trump, are proof of this, not exceptions). Her star keeps rising, yet also dimming. There’s a gap between what she wants to be and how she’s seen, among both the government and the electorate.\n\nMordaunt ran in the 2022 Conservative Party leadership contest against Liz Truss, among 8 of 11 hopefuls to have the support of enough MPs to stand. She hurled her hat into the ring on social media with a somewhat bizarre video featuring clips of British paralympian Jonnie Peacock – who hadn’t consented and asked to be removed – and incarcerated murderer Oscar Pistorius. Interesting branding.\n\nMany took delight in pointing out that Mordaunt had formerly been in PR. She nonetheless made it to the final three before being eliminated and backing the disastrous Truss. When Truss resigned just weeks later, Mordaunt hoped to try again, but failed to recruit the necessary 100 MPs. Rishi Sunak became party leader and thus PM by default, without a ballot of MPs, party members, or unknown foreign elements.\n\nIt’s now reported that Mordaunt is being mooted to replace Sunak in an effort to improve Tory prospects before a general election. Polling predictions see them suffering an unprecedented wipeout, left with as few as 24 seats under Sunak’s craven, populist, sleaze-soaked premiership. But is Mordaunt really The One to save their sinking ship, their naval Neo? Can she stand up, and fight?\n\nBranding Penny Mordaunt\n\nMordaunt is said to have had a challenging upbringing. She was 15 when her mother died of breast cancer, and her father was diagnosed with cancer the following year. She supported herself by working as a magician’s assistant before university. She’s said to have become interested in politics while spending a gap year in Romanian hospitals and orphanages.\n\nMordaunt’s rise in her party shows her to be ‘popular’ yet never popular enough. Her moniker ‘Penny Dormant’ was awarded within the Department of International Trade, said to reflect her poor grasp of detail, and that she did little aside from manoeuvres in the direction of Downing Street. She was a mainstay of the Brexit-driving publicly-funded European Research Group (ERG) of MPs and peers, a ‘party-within-a-party’, yet has never publicly been anointed their, well, sword-carrier.\n\nThe Telegraph and others in the press and her own party have painted her as “socially liberal”; that is, ‘liberal for a Tory’. She herself leans heavily on ties to the Navy, and is combative at the Commons despatch box to the point of rudeness. She apparently associates herself with Lady Penelope of Thunderbirds fame: glamour with a glint of menace, like a sexier Thatcher. But that Penelope is, well, a retro polyester and fibreglass puppet, in a British production but American show. Interesting branding.\n\nWhatever others may think of her, sinister nanny Penelope Mary Mordaunt does scare me. I think she thinks she could be PM, and I think she could be, too. Named after a warship, I believe she’d make Thatcher look like a principled genius. I’ve been playing a guessing game about how old she was when she first realised her initials were PM, regarded this Earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew her plans against us.\n\nOn the record\n\nThe Romanian orphans thing is just gaslighting. According to They Work For You, Mordaunt has:\n\nGenerally voted against: spending public money to create jobs for long-term unemployed young people; a banker’s bonus tax; and measures to prevent climate change.\n\nAlmost always voted for: making local councils responsible for helping those in financial need afford council tax while reducing the amount spent on such support; reducing housing benefit for social tenants with ‘excess’ bedrooms (‘bedroom tax’); reductions in spending on welfare benefits; and reduced corporation tax rates.\n\nConsistently voted against: paying higher benefits over longer periods for those unable to work due to illness or disability, and raising welfare benefits at least in line with prices.\n\nAlmost always voted against: annual tax on the value of expensive homes (the ‘mansion tax’); restrictions on fees charged to tenants by letting agents; increasing tax on income over £150,000; and slowing the rise in rail fares.\n\nConsistently voted for mass surveillance of and retention of information about people’s communications and activities.\n\nDespite working to save for university herself, including factory work, consistently voted for university tuition fees, and raising England’s undergraduate cap to £9,000 a year.\n\nConsistently votes for gay rights, perhaps because her twin is gay. Many Conservatives have a more progressive voting record on gay rights when it affects them personally.\n\nHas difficult teens. First in her family to go to university. Moved by those struggling in a post-dictatorship country. Of Irish ancestry. Then says ‘pull yourself up by your bootstraps’ and does little to help the most vulnerable. Okay, fair play, she is actually quite Thatchery. Mordaunt is, after all, the one who rebranded food banks as ‘pantries’. When you’ve made voters so straitened that Waitrose shoppers use food banks, what else to do?\n\n‘Liberal for a Tory’\n\nLet’s dispense with the myth that Penny Mordaunt is ‘socially liberal’, centrist-for-a-Conservative, once and for all. Her voting record says all you need to know. Her backing Truss then sitting behind Sunak in the Commons – trying to have it both ways by making pained faces when he speaks – and delusions about Brexit speak to her judgement. Then look at what she says herself, and how. Mordaunt is profoundly undemocratic.\n\nMordaunt wrote this for publication and has left it up despite her name being floated for leadership of everyone in the country. (So we can discard the myth that she’s a PR expert while we’re at it). Some of those she speaks about so contemptuously – and let’s face it, it’s the gaslighting subspecies called projection on her part – are her own constituents.\n\nWe have, at least on paper, a system of representative democracy. MPs are supposed to represent everyone in their constituency, not just those who voted for them. In using such language, Mordaunt makes clear that our ‘system’ is neither representative nor democratic, and that she’s fine with that.\n\nContempt and disdain are Mordaunt’s most notable characteristics for me. She sometimes tries to mask them, but out they slip. Some might find it alluring. The combination of Veronica Lake hair and being talked down to by a stern nanny may well appeal to those who would turn to a ‘strongman’ in our current economic circumstances. (If I sound contemptuous myself, know that it’s my frustrated exhaustion at the continuing failure of our species to learn the ample, painful lessons of history).\n\nGrave reservations\n\nContrary to the screenshot above, Mordaunt said the previous year: “the nation will be served best if we bring people together”. Looking at what she says and does, over time, there are disturbing inconsistencies. I could link to articles with examples but the most detailed also contain transphobia. Suffice it to say, on the subject of gender identity – which contributed to branding Mordaunt ‘liberal’ – she seems not to have the courage of her ‘convictions’.\n\nNor does Mordaunt have anything like the naval experience claimed. Her record in that regard is “a process of confabulation not altogether consonant either with the claimed record of service, or with the associated experience and values, which this politician has forcefully invoked in support of her ambition to become prime minister.” That she almost always wears navy is just branding.\n\nShe wrote an odd, bad book in 2021, with a foreword by Bill Gates. It lengthily and firmly condemns political exploitation of ‘culture wars’. I know, right? She told iNews: “I’ve never received a memo, as a minister, telling me to get into fights. I don’t think that that is what the government is focused on, and certainly this minister is not.” Yet she’s just defended Michelle Donelan’s attacks on academics, and the racist, sexist, violent remarks by Tory donor – and massive government contract recipient – Frank Hester.\n\nIt’s telling that none of the ministers for whom Mordaunt worked have backed her in previous contests. This marks the only occasion on which I’ll ever quote David Frost. She was his deputy when he was chief Brexit negotiator, and he said: “On the basis of what I saw I would have grave reservations about [her becoming PM]. It became such a problem that after six months I had to ask the Prime Minister to move her on.”\n\nMaking a Splash!\n\nBut I fear Mordaunt’s even more dangerous than that: she seems to want the UK to adopt the worst traits of the American clean slate libertarian late vulture capitalism I touched on for Byline Times. And has actively worked towards it. So far her deregulatory Brexit has been as successful and respected as her 2014 appearance on diving reality show Splash!, in which she competed floppily against Gemma Collins off The Only Way is Essex.\n\nAs mentioned, Mordaunt started her career as a public relations professional. This included working in the US in 2000 and 2004 as Head of Foreign Press for the George W Bush presidential campaign. She helped set up an Anglo-American website,’virtualconservatives’. As UK Trade Policy minister, she popped over regularly. Since Trump disappointed Brexiters by losing despite cheating and attempting a violent coup, the post-Brexit safety net of a US-UK trade deal hasn’t materialised. But Mordaunt didn’t give up trying to present magic tricks – she negotiated ‘trade deals’ (mere MoUs) state by state.\n\nIt seemed so desperate. But then the seemingly hijacked US Supreme Court issued a decision reverting to an extremist ‘states’ rights’ position which will enable ‘red’ states to topple hard-won civil rights and deregulate for the benefit of corporations (which, following another decision termed ‘Citizens United’, are viewed legally as persons). SCOTUS also decided to limit the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to regulate carbon emissions from power plants.\n\nWith the UK out of the EU, with the US splintering despite a Democratic win, disaster capitalists with US right wing connections at state level could mint it. And who will suffer? Why poorer people, their working conditions, and their living environments, of course. Think Erin Brockovich. (Or Dark Waters, 2019, which I highly recommend).\n\nFreeports\n\nIn a December 2021 speech Mordaunt made in Atlanta, Georgia, she compared Britain’s Brexit to America’s fight for independence from … Britain. She said: “We will work to tackle the systematic use of market-distorting practices, such as harmful state subsidies and more other pernicious government interventions which damage competition.”\n\nTell me if you want this slash-and-burn ideologue running the country. You’ll be working a dangerous sub-minimum wage contractless freeport job faster than you can say “laissez-faire economics”. Pernicious, indeed.\n\nWhat is a ‘freeport’? Here’s a primer by the Bylines Network. Brexiters said the EU prevented us from having them. This isn’t true, though in 2019 the European Parliament called for them to be scrapped across the EU after a report on tax evasion and money laundering said freeports are “a safe and widely disregarded storage space, where trade can be conducted untaxed and ownership can be concealed.”\n\nThe lack of scrutiny means high-value items like drugs and stolen art can be stored free of the usual checks, controls, and taxation. The UK had some while an EU member, but they were closed by 2012 because they were rubbish.\n\nFreeports can also be called SEZs, and can have workers with reduced pay, conditions, and rights, including foreign workers from such countries as India, which has many SEZs. Several are owned by Conservative donor and BoJo-lifestyle-supporter Lord Bamford of JCB, one being Johnson’s first business port of call when he went to India in April 2022. Four belong to Infosys.\n\nPure class\n\nNow, who has connections to Infosys? It’s on the tip of my tongue. In 2016, in a “Centre for Policy Studies report, The Free Ports Opportunity, Richmond MP Rishi Sunak argues Britain’s membership of the EU has held back growth and that the creation of ‘free ports’ would be a huge opportunity for trade.”\n\nThe people behind freeports are the people behind austerity and Brexit. What does that tell you?\n\nI could also write about that time Penny Mordaunt said “cock” in Parliament five times and “lay” or “laid” six times, on a dare. So respectful of the seat of our democracy.\n\nOr I could dive into the time she lied to Andrew Marr and was slammed for it by David Cameron, after divisive and dishonest Vote Leave posters were produced claiming ‘Turkey (population 76million) is joining the EU’. She doubled down on this lie not all that long ago.\n\nI could get into the weeds about the time that Penny Mordaunt, as Disabilities Minister, oversaw a cruel and costly error. The Department of Work and Pensions rewrote the law without consulting its own Social Security Advisory Committee, so that 164,000 people wouldn’t get higher disability benefits, to avoid complying with two tribunal rulings and spending £3.7bn.\n\nOr I could review Mordaunt’s vapid-yet-chilling book. But I’ll let Foreign Affairs have the pleasure: “When Mordaunt extols the success of former US President Donald Trump’s electoral appeal to middle America, hints at crafting a version of his agenda for the United Kingdom, and speaks of “empowering the silent majority,” she offers a glimpse of an ominous possible future for the Conservative Party.”\n\nLoadsamoney Mordaunt\n\nThe Bristol Port Company is co-owned by Terence Mordaunt and David Ord, who reportedly donated over £640,000 to the Conservative Party since 2001. Terence Mordaunt was the 13th-largest donor to the Leave campaign, and gave £10,000 four times up to 2023 to In for a Penny through his company First Corporate Consultants Ltd. Terence is Chairman of primo climate change denial lobbyists the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Crime Minister [typo stays] Johnson recommended the Bristol Port for freeport status, but it didn’t happen.\n\nAre the two Mordaunts related? According to this Mordaunt genealogy site, and the hours I spent there and will never get back, if they are, it’s only distantly. Does it honestly matter? The only current Conservative ties that seem to bind are the rubber bands around bundles of filthy lucre. Someday their descendants must become family in any event, as they’ll be the only ones left sitting atop the pile of ashes and bones that was Earth, counting their pointless money.\n\nPenny Mordaunt thinks ‘lefty woke remoaners’ hold Brexit Britain back by not closing their eyes and wishing hard enough, as if the ailing economy is Tinkerbell. It’s easy to laugh at her contemptuous taunts and magical thinking. But then, we laughed at Trump, didn’t we?\n\nStand up. And fight\n\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found that 14.4mn people are living in poverty, including 8.1mn working-age adults, 4.2mn children, and 2.1mn pensioners. Poverty levels are 50% higher now than in the 1970s. There have been a record number of suicides at job centres and benefit offices. The Institute of Health Equity at University College London finds economic and social inequalities are leading to poorer people dying early from cancer, heart problems, and other diseases. Social mobility is collapsing. As many as 1 in every 63 people were killed by austerity by 2019.\n\nWhile surely holding such knowledge, pantry-opener Penny Mordaunt posts on TwiX that ‘the plan is working’ and everything’s just super. Even if the country will stand for a fourth PM in under five years – one whose mandate from the masses would be barely detectable under the most powerful electron microscope – will it really be this gaslighter? Is this disdainful, sword-toting Thatcher fan really the best the Conservative Party can offer this country, with its people, local authorities, and public services on their knees? With the impacts of climate change roaring in even faster than predicted?\n\nSadly, probably, yes. Surely it’s time, then, that we stand up and fight? For our right. To vote. Face the real will of the people, Rishi Sunak. Call a general election now. No more time and money spaffed on party bun fights instead of the governance we pay you for. We deserve, and desperately need, so much better."
