        "text": "Penny Mordaunt has been accused of “not standing up for women”, in the latest attack from the Right of the Conservative Party.\n\nIn a departing swipe at her leadership rival, Suella Braverman, who was knocked out of the contest on Thursday after losing five of her backers, criticised Ms Mordaunt’s time in government.\n\nShe repeated allegations that the then-paymaster general resisted the inclusion of the words “mother” and “woman” in a Bill designed to ensure that Ms Braverman, and future ministers, did not have to either resign as a Cabinet minister or return to work straight after giving birth.\n\nThe Attorney General has previously said this made her pregnancy “needlessly” stressful.\n\n“I do have to say that Hansard and the record shows that Penny Mordaunt as the Bill minister, the minister responsible for passing that legislation, did oppose and did resist the inclusion of the word woman and the word mother and did only concede after unsustainable pressure from the House of Lords,” she told Sky.\n\n“I was quite disappointed by the way in which it was handled and the responsible minister I’m afraid didn’t stand up for women and didn’t actually reflect the views of a lot of our party on wanting women to be authentically represented on the face of the Bill and in legislation.”\n\nMs Mordaunt’s allies have previously denied this, arguing that she was paymaster general at the time and had no authority or responsibility for the wording of the Bill.\n\nMs Braverman later told the BBC that Ms Mordaunt took a “different view to me when it comes to gender ideology and the position of trans [people].\n\n“For example, I think she said a trans woman is a woman, I disagree with that,” she added.\n\nThe trade minister, who on Thursday came second in the leadership ballot of MPs with 83 votes, gained the most new backers of any candidate, picking up 16 votes to move within 20 of the front-runner Rishi Sunak.\n\nMs Braverman’s comments, coming after she won only 27 votes in the ballot, came as a strong message to her backers not to fall behind Ms Mordaunt, a fellow Brexiteer.\n\n“Ultimately I was the only authentic Brexiteer, the party has turned me down, I’m going to have to find someone who comes close to what my policy platform was,” Ms Braverman said.\n\nThis is the latest in a string of public intervention from Right-wing rivals to Ms Mordaunt’s campaign, which has seen several MPs questioning her record as a minister.\n\nSimon Clarke, a top backer of Liz Truss, took aim at both Rishi Sunak and Ms Mordaunt, telling Sky: “It is telling, I think, where current members of the Government are placing their support.\n\n“That is reflected in a number of very senior ministers’ decisions about who to support in this race – they are not backing Ms Mordaunt.”\n\n‘The incoming fire starts’\n\nIt comes following a high-profile intervention from her former boss Lord Frost who said that he was surprised that she was in the leadership race and “did not master the necessary detail” in the Brexit negotiations.\n\n“From the basis of what I saw, I would have grave reservations,” he told TalkTV.\n\nMs Mordaunt’s campaign said that she has “nothing but respect for Lord Frost” and that she “will always fight for Brexit and always has”.\n\nDavid Davis responded to the flack that his candidate was taking from her rivals by calling it “black ops” that start as soon as a challenger gets ahead.\n\n“My comment when I saw it earlier was it’s absolutely clockwork – you get to the point that somebody gets ahead and looks to be the real challenger, and then the black op starts, the incoming fire starts,” he told Sky.\n\nLiz Truss was asked on Thursday whether she would distance herself or intervene following the attacks against her rivals, such as interventions from Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\nThe Times reported on Thursday that one backer of Liz Truss thought that Ms Mordaunt shouldn’t be appointed MP because she would need “stabilisers”.\n\nMs Truss said at her leadership launch that she was putting forward a “positive” campaign for the country."
