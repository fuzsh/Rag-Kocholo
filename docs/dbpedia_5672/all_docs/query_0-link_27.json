        "text": "Purpose: To compare 3 capsulotomy centration methods.\n\nSetting: Private clinic, Zlin, Czech Republic.\n\nDesign: Prospective, consecutive case series.\n\nMethods: 180 eyes undergoing cataract surgery had anterior capsule staining with microfiltered 0.4% trypan blue solution before selective laser capsulotomy. The first 60 eyes (Group 1) had mydriatic dilated pupil centered capsulotomies. The next 60 eyes (Group 2) were centered on the trypan blue central landmark (TCL). The final 60 capsulotomies (Group 3) were centered on the patient fixated coaxial Purkinje reflex (CPR). Measurements between key anatomical landmarks and the TCL, CPR capsulotomies, and implanted intraocular lens (IOL) center were made.\n\nResults: The TCL, observed in >94% of eyes in the study, coincided with the CPR with a displacement of <0.1 ± 0.1 mm. Group 1 capsulotomies were noticeably decentered on the IOLs by 0.3 ± 0.2 mm. The Group 2 symmetrical IOL relationship was maintained with a decentration of 0.15 ± 0.1 mm. Group 3 had a similar decentration with the IOLs with 0.15 ± 0.1 mm. Verification with IOLMaster 700 data and CALLISTO Eye System showed that the CPR and the TCL were coincident with the measured visual axis."
