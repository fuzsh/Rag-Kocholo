        "text": "Thank you for joining us for the UK general election results. Our coverage has moved here.\n\nThe UK has a new political reality. Here's what you need to know\n\nBritain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has started to name his cabinet, including appointing Rachel Reeves as the country’s first ever female Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister.\n\nEarlier, the Labour leader made his first speech as prime minister, promising to steer the UK toward “calmer waters” during his time in office.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nLabour Party wins big: The center-left Labour won the election by a landslide, securing the biggest majority in its history. Party leader Starmer celebrated the victory in front of supporters at the Tate Modern art gallery in London. “Change begins now. It feels good, I have to be honest,” he said.\n\nHandover of power complete: Sunak formally tendered his resignation to King Charles, before Starmer had his audience with the monarch, who asked him to form a government. Starmer then traveled to Downing Street to address the nation before he and his wife, Victoria, entered Number 10 for the first time.\n\nStarmer promises change: In his first speech as prime minister, Starmer pledged to steer the UK toward “calmer waters” after 14 often turbulent years of Conservative rule. “You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change, to restore service and respect to politics, end the era of noisy performance, tread more lightly on your lives, and unite our country,” Starmer said.\n\nCabinet appointments: Starmer has announced a number of cabinet appointments, with Angela Rayner named deputy prime minister as well as Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, while Rachel Reeves is the first ever female finance minister in British history.\n\nSunak to step down: The outgoing prime minister said that he will leave his post as leader of the Conservative party in an address to the British public outside Downing Street. “I have heard your anger, your disappointment, and I take responsibility for this loss,” Sunak said after delivering the party’s worst-ever defeat.\n\nProminent Conservatives lose their seats: The Tories have had a tough night, suffering the biggest defeat since the party was formed. Among the top brass Conservatives losing their seats: the former (albeit short-lived) Prime Minister Liz Truss, House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt, Defense Secretary Grant Shapps and Justice Secretary Alex Chalk.\n\nReform UK makes breakthrough: An insurgent rightwing populist party led by the Nigel Farage secured four seats, with Farage himself getting into the parliament for the first time – after running seven times in the past.\n\nLiberal Democrats reborn: The Liberal Democrats were on course to secure their best result ever – and will return as Britain’s third-biggest party in Westminster. They unseated several high-profile Conservatives.\n\nGreens quadruple their seats: The Green Party won four spots in the Parliament, gaining three more seats compared to the last election in 2019.\n\nSNP wipeout: The Scottish National Party has suffered big losses in Scotland, likely putting the question of an independent Scotland to rest for now. Labour took a host of seats from the party.\n\nLow turnout: Turnout is on track to be the lowest for more than 20 years. Of the seats declared by early Friday morning, turnout is hovering just below 60% – down from 67.3% at the last election in 2019.\n\nWho is Rachel Reeves, the first woman to take the helm of Britain’s economy?\n\nRachel Reeves has been appointed by Keir Starmer as the UK’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister, becoming the first woman to hold the role.\n\nThe daughter of teachers, Reeves studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University before taking a graduate job at the Bank of England, initially tasked with analyzing how Japan attempted to emerge from its period of stagnation in the 1990s.\n\nBritain’s economy today faces a similar challenge. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Britain’s economic growth has mostly flatlined. The last time the average Briton went so long without a real-terms pay rise, Queen Victoria had not been born.\n\nLabour made kickstarting economic growth a key mission. In a recent lecture, Reeves diagnosed the root of Britain’s economic ills.\n\nReeves said the years of political instability that followed was a product of the economic harm wrought by austerity. She called the failure to invest when the government could borrow cheaply “an act of historic negligence.”\n\nAlthough Labour has been criticized for not making bolder tax-and-spend commitments – leading some to argue there is little difference between their plans for the economy and the Tories’ – Starmer’s government will face far more constraints than the Conservative government in 2010. After the surge in borrowing costs, Britain is much more fiscally constrained now than it was then.\n\nStill, within these limits, Reeves has made a series of quietly radical promises. She calls her agenda “securonomics” – a homage to “Bidenomics” – an attempt to build secure supply chains to avoid future inflationary shocks.\n\nTo this end, Labour has also pledged to create two new economic institutions: a National Wealth Fund, aiming to rebuild Britain’s industrial strength and encourage private investment, and Great British Energy, a mission to create a publicly-owned clean energy company by 2030.\n\nWhat is clear is that Labour is not promising overnight fixes to Britain’s malaise. Starmer and Reeves say they hope to embark on “a decade of national renewal.”\n\nStarmer names more senior cabinet positions\n\nNew British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has appointed three more senior ministers to his cabinet.\n\nDavid Lammy has been appointed foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper is the home secretary and John Healey is the defense secretary.\n\nStarmer appoints first female finance minister in UK history\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has appointed Rachel Reeves as UK chancellor, making her the first woman to take charge of the Treasury.\n\nReeves said it was the “honor of her life” to be appointed as UK finance minister.\n\nReeves, a former Bank of England economist, said it was a “historic responsibility” to be appointed to the position and addressed other women and girls, saying there should be “no limits on your ambitions.”\n\nThere will also be a record number of female lawmakers in the new House of Commons when it returns, continuing a trend towards increasing female representation in parliament over the last few elections.\n\nMore than 260 female lawmakers have been elected to parliament. The previous record set was 220 in 2019.\n\nStarmer starts to name his cabinet, with Angela Rayner appointed deputy prime minister\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer has appointed Angela Rayner as deputy prime minister, his office announced in a post on X Friday.\n\nRayner will also serve as Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.\n\nSeveral senior Labour MPs have been seen entering Downing Street, where Starmer will name his cabinet.\n\nReform UK’s Nigel Farage heckled and called racist at chaotic press conference\n\nNigel Farage from the right-wing start-up Reform UK party was subjected to a barrage of heckling from protesters at a press conference that he called to celebrate his party’s election success.\n\nFarage, known for his leadership in the UK’s Brexit campaign and his close ties with former President Donald Trump, won his first seat in parliament in Thursday’s vote, along with at least three others from the Reform party.\n\nAs he tried to address journalists and supporters, several hecklers shouted abuse, including one that said he was racist.\n\nFarage and his party have vowed to freeze illegal migration and “stop the boats,” in reference to migrants who arrive in the country by sea, usually across the English Channel.\n\nFarage shouted, “Boring, boring, boring,” to drown out hecklers’ remarks as his supporters cheered and security officials ejected the protesters from the room.\n\nHe took a jibe at newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying that, although Labour won by a landslide in terms of seats in parliament, the popular vote showed the party’s win was not a resounding victory.\n\nDespite the Labour landslide, Starmer’s party only increased its vote share by a few percentage points from its dismal 2019 showing.\n\nHow the return of Farage created a nightmare for the Tories\n\nAfter Britain left the European Union in 2020 – a cause he had championed for three decades – Nigel Farage retreated from frontline politics. When his fledgling Brexit party renamed itself as Reform UK, he slunk into the role of party chairman – still a political force, but a dormant one.\n\nJust weeks ago, it looked set to stay that way. Farage initially said he would not stand in this election, and that he would instead “help with the grassroots campaign” in the US, presumably to try to reelect former President Donald Trump.\n\nThis came as a relief to the Conservatives, who had long feared losing their more right-wing voters to Reform. But, lacking a recognizable leader, Reform looked set to be a disparate protest vote, failing to pose a real electoral challenge to the Tories.\n\nThen, everything changed. Farage said at the start of June that he was set to make an “emergency announcement,” striking fear into Conservative HQ.\n\nHe went on to win the seat comfortably, finally being elected Parliament after seven unsuccessful attempts.\n\nFarage’s return injected energy into the Reform campaign and skewed the electoral arithmetic. While Reform won just four seats, it secured millions of votes, potentially costing the Conservative dozens of constituencies by splitting the vote on the right.\n\nIn the past, the Conservative Party has seen off the Faragist threat by adopting his policies. The much-diminished party now faces a similar choice: Does it try to bury Reform, or bed it?\n\nMeet Victoria Starmer, wife of new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\n\nThe British public has elected a new government, and with that a new family will be moving into 10 Downing Street.\n\nUnlike some other countries, such as the United States, when a new British prime minister comes to power, the transition into both the new role and home happens almost immediately.\n\nThat means, not only will Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, be settling into his home down the road from the Houses of Parliament, but so will his wife, Victoria, and their two teenage children.\n\nStarmer’s wife, whom he usually refers to as Vic, kept a relatively low profile during the election campaign, but she was at his side on Friday as he arrived at Downing Street for the first time as prime minister.\n\nSo, who is Victoria Starmer, and what do we know about the new occupants of 10 Downing Street?\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAt the scene: Keir Starmer's first speech as PM\n\nLittle more than an hour separated Keir Starmer’s speech from Rishi Sunak’s, but the mood outside Downing Street could not have been more dramatically different.\n\nA crowd of Labour staffers and their family members gathered a few steps from the Number 10 door while Starmer was at Buckingham Palace, some holding Union Jack umbrellas, others waving flags.\n\nAt one point a member of staff handed out Scottish and Welsh flags, after an election that saw Labour overturn a deficit to the Scottish National Party north of the border. The “One Nation” optics drew a clear parallel to Tony Blair’s Labour victory.\n\nEven Larry the cat, Downing Street’s beloved demouser-in-chief, broke out of his midday nap on the pavement and limbered up for his new housemate, doing a few laps of the street before slipping back inside.\n\nThe helicopter circling overhead and the increasingly enthused cheers from the amassed crowd signalled Starmer’s arrival, and the ever-serious politician appeared relaxed, the burden of campaigning lifted, as he took his time greeting them on arrival.\n\nHis speech was statesmanlike if not exactly soaring, the energy dipping slightly as he reached for well-worn phrases already used in countless campaign speeches.\n\nThere was no new, surprising side to Starmer that emerged - perhaps none ever will. But Starmer ended on a powerful note, promising his government’s “urgent work” will “begin today.”\n\nIt’s not an exaggeration: Starmer has decisions to make about his Cabinet, and while his majority is almost historic, he must face a public eager to see results after a fragile coalition of voters saw him into Downing Street.\n\nBut those are conversations for another day. Friday belongs to Keir Starmer, Britain’s new, uniquely powerful prime minister.\n\nStarmer pledges to heal the \"weariness in the heart\" of Britain\n\nKeir Starmer said the country voted “decisively for change, and a return of politics to public service.”\n\n“When the gap between the sacrifices made by people and the service they receive from politicians grows this big, it leads to a weariness in the heart of a nation, a draining away of the hope, the spirit, the belief in a better future, that we need to move forward together,” Starmer said.\n\nThis wound, Starmer said, “can only be healed by action, not words.”\n\nHe said he intends to start work right away “with the simple acknowledgement that public service is a privilege and that this government should treat every single person in this country with respect.”\n\nStarmer praises predecessor Sunak in first speech\n\nNew UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised his predecessor Rishi Sunak in his first speech as prime minister.\n\nAfter confirming he’d accepted an invitation to form a government following a landslide win, Labour leader Starmer recognized the “extra effort” Sunak made in becoming the country’s first Asian prime minister.\n\n“And we also recognize the dedication and hard work he brought to his leadership,” added Starmer.\n\nWhat is the King’s role in the election?\n\nYou may have noticed King Charles III hasn’t been out and about quite as much over the last six weeks. It’s not for the reason you think.\n\nSoon after Rishi Sunak called for a general election, Buckingham Palace announced the family would postpone engagements “which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign,” since the royals must stay neutral and above politics.\n\nThe King has spent the past few days in Scotland for “Holyrood Week,” an annual celebration in the royal calendar recognizing Scottish culture and community.\n\nHowever, he was needed back in London on Friday to invite the leader of the party that won the most seats in the House of Commons to Buckingham Palace.\n\nDuring Kier Starmer’s audience with Charles, he will become become prime minister and be invited to form a government in His Majesty’s name.\n\nSunak lacked vision and experience, says leading PM biographer\n\nAntony Seldon has written biographies of Britain’s last eight consecutive prime ministers, but the recent churn of leaders has left him “a bit jaded.”\n\nBoris Johnson, who won the last general election in 2019, was “so awful.” Liz Truss was “just hopeless – but very destructive and fascinating.”\n\nHow did Sunak stack up against his predecessors? Seldon sees two clear flaws with his brief premiership: lack of vision, and inexperience.\n\nPainting with a broad brush, Seldon describes Johnson, with his focus on infrastructure, as “Rooseveltian;” Truss, with her penchant for libertarian economics, as “Reaganite;” and Sunak, a fan of tight money, as “kind of Hooverite.”\n\nBut he struggles to ascribe a broader strategy to Sunak. As a result, his signature policies – putting some chess boards in parks, encouraging young people to study math to 18, banning smoking – have felt “pretty micro.”\n\nRather than implementing major policies of his own, Sunak canceled ones already underway: a high-speed train between London and other major cities, and rolling back Britain’s pledges to tackle climate change.\n\nAnd, entering 10 Downing Street just seven years after becoming a Member of Parliament, Sunak “was never blooded, never had to reflect on the whole range of what a government does, the opposition does.”\n\nStarmer arrives at Buckingham Palace for audience with the King\n\nKeir Starmer has arrived at Buckingham Palace with his wife, Victoria, where they were welcomed into the King’s door for an audience with Charles III.\n\nAfter the process known as “the kissing of hands,” Starmer will be invited to form a government in His Majesty’s name.\n\nWhen he leaves the palace, Starmer will have become the 58th prime minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nGreen Party quadruples number of seats in strong showing\n\nThe Green Party won four seats in parliament, three more than at the last election in 2019, receiving 6.8% of the popular vote.\n\nWhile the party stood candidates in a record number of constituencies in this election, its official goal was to win four seats and it succeeded in all four.\n\nThe Greens won comfortably in Brighton Pavilion, their long-time and, until now, only stronghold, and managed to take two seats away from the Conservatives in the rural constituencies of North Herefordshire and Waveney Valley.\n\nThe Greens also won in Bristol Central, where party co-leader Carla Denyer ran against Labour candidate Thangam Debbonaire, who was first elected an MP in 2015 and was expected to become Culture Secretary in the new Labour government.\n\nDenyer thanked voters in a post on X.\n\n“As this city’s first Green MP, I promise to be a strong, independent voice for Bristol’s values, pushing the govt to be bolder on the issues that matter,” she wrote.\n\nAt the scene: Sunak's final speech as British prime minister\n\nRishi Sunak fired the starting gun on his six-week downfall in the rain. His premiership ended on Friday morning, in a drizzle.\n\nThere were plenty of umbrellas unfurled among the media masses opposite Downing Street’s famous black door — an instrument infamously ignored by the outgoing prime minister when he called the election at the end of May.\n\nBut at least the worst of the rain had cleared, averting the prospect of Sunak’s speech being hurriedly moved inside.\n\nIn the windows above Downing Street, as Sunak said his final goodbyes inside, the lights were on and the silhouettes of staff members flashed by, occasionally fiddling with the blinds.\n\nFor Sunak and for most of his political appointees, this will be their final moments inside the famous building. The handover in power in British politics is infamously sudden.\n\nThen he emerged, with his wife a few paces behind as he took to the podium. It was a cleaner speech than six weeks ago. He sounded humbled and apologetic.\n\nBut a protestor could clearly be heard shouting “Tories Out!” as Sunak delivered his final words, Sunak tapping his left foot hurriedly as he did so.\n\nWith a touch of poetic humor, the clouds did at last part over Sunak’s head as he neared the end of his speech. After a miserable, gray morning, the sky noticeably brightened over Downing Street seconds after Sunak’s departure.\n\n“I have heard your anger,” Sunak says in contrite farewell speech\n\nMore now on Rishi Sunak’s farewell speech from Downing Street.\n\nThe outgoing PM said he had heard the “anger” of British voters, who delivered his Conservative Party its worst-ever defeat, and apologized to the candidates who had lost their seats.\n\nSunak announced he will step down as party leader in the near future. Reflecting on his 21-month premiership, Sunak said he had “returned stability to our economy” and rebuilt Britain’s relations with its allies.\n\nHe singled out a major deal he struck to normalize relations between the UK and European Union in the wake of Brexit - a policy he championed - as another of his achievements.\n\nSunak wished Labour leader Keir Starmer success when he becomes prime minister later Friday.\n\nFinally, Sunak – the first British Asian prime minister – reflected on his background.\n\nPerhaps in a nod toward the surge in support for the hard-right Reform UK party, Sunak said: “We must hold true to that idea of who we are – that vision of kindness, decency and tolerance that has always been the British way.”\n\nNationalist Sinn Féin party becomes largest Northern Irish party in Westminster parliament\n\nSinn Féin has become largest Northern Irish party in the Westminster parliament after a historic showing in the UK general election.\n\nNorthern Irish politicians can choose to either run for a seat in the Westminster parliament or for a seat in the devolved legislature, the Northern Ireland Assembly, referred to as Stormont.\n\nThe Assembly passes laws regarding policy areas such as health, education and policing whilst the Westminster parliament presides over issues which have not been devolved including foreign policy and defense.\n\nThe nationalist Sinn Féin party, which advocates for reuniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in the south, succeeded in winning seven out of the 18 available seats in the Westminster parliament.\n\nAfter a sweeping victory in Assembly elections held in 2022, Sinn Féin now has the largest number of seats for a Northern Ireland party in both Westminster and Stormont.\n\nSinn Féin MPs do not take up their seats in the Westminster parliament as part of the party’s refusal to recognize British sovereignty over Northern Ireland.\n\nThe party’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill hailed their success in a social media post on Friday, thanking voters for “endorsing Sinn Féin candidates who will work hard for you every day and lead positive change for everyone.”\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the leading Unionist party which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, won five seats in total, losing some long-held seats in stronghold areas.\n\nThe UK’s transfer of power is an exercise of ruthless efficiency\n\nSomewhere in London, a removal van will soon start trundling towards Westminster. Desks will be cleared, photographs will be taken down, closets will be emptied. By this evening, 10 Downing Street will have a new resident.\n\nIn other countries, the gap between an election to the formation of a new government can take months. In the United Kingdom, power is transferred with ruthless efficiency.\n\nIn the coming hours, Sunak is expected to give a resignation speech; Starmer is expected to give a victory one; both are expected to visit Buckingham Palace.\n\nBy the afternoon, the conversation will have shifted to the makeup of Starmer’s government. We’ll be bringing you the latest until then.\n\nHere is how one third of votes got Labour two thirds of seats in the Parliament\n\nThe Labour Party has won an overwhelming majority in the UK Parliament, securing close to two thirds of the seats in the UK Parliament.\n\nHere is the curious thing though: in terms of the vote share, only about one third of voters cast their votes for Labour in the election yesterday.\n\nThis discrepancy is due to the British electoral system, based on the “first past the post” principle.\n\nThe country is divided into 650 constituencies, each holding their own contest to pick one member of parliament. Whoever wins the largest number of votes in their constituency becomes the MP – they don’t need to secure the majority in order to be elected. In fact, most MPs don’t.\n\nThis means that the number of seats a party wins doesn’t necessary reflect its overall popularity across the country, something that has historically disadvantaged the smaller parties.\n\nReform, the insurgent rightwing populist party led by Nigel Farage, secured 14% of the votes in this election, but came first in only four constituencies. That means they will take up four seats in the parliament – less than 1%. The Greens, who got some 7% of all votes also secured four seats.\n\nThere have been campaigns to change the electoral systems over the years, but none succeeded – possibly because the parties making the decision are the ones who could lose the most from a shift to a different system.\n\nThe \"fun\" campaign that delivered a \"record-breaking\" night for the Lib Dems\n\nAs leader of the party that won just 11 seats at the last general election, Ed Davey has had to scrap for attention. With British media duly dominated by Labour and the Conservatives – joined this time by the nascent Reform UK party – the centrist Liberal Democrats faced a problem: How to get eyeballs on their campaign?\n\nDavey, it turned out, found an ingenious solution: Be a bit of a clown.\n\nOver the past six weeks, Davey has bungee-jumped, rollercoaster-ed, kayaked, wheelbarrowed, frisbee-ed, slip-and-slid, paddle-boarded and hula-hooped his way across the country, on the promise to take voters’ concerns – but not himself – seriously.\n\nMany British voters might have been hard-pressed to name the leader of the Lib Dems before this campaign. Now, millions will be familiar with him. Amid Sunak’s gaffes and Starmer’s unflinching earnestness, Davey has cut the figure of a fun uncle, winning him widespread affection.\n\nThe campaign has not, however, been without more somber moments. In a moving campaign video, Davey told the story of how he looks after his 16-year-old son, John, who was born with severe learning and physical disabilities and requires round-the-clock care.\n\nThe Lib Dems made social care a key part of their manifesto – and have been rewarded with 70 seats, which Davey hailed as the party’s “best results in a century.”\n\nSunak to address British public before tendering resignation to King Charles\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has arrived in London to begin the process of formally standing down and allowing election winner Keir Starmer to form a government.\n\nA plane reported to be carrying Sunak landed at the RAF Northolt airbase in west London shortly after 7 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), according to video carried by British broadcasters.\n\nSunak then traveled to the Conservative party headquarters in London where he is expected to address party members and staff.\n\nHe is expected to make a statement at Downing Street at approximately 10.30 a.m. local time (5.30 a.m. ET), before travelling to Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation to King Charles, according to a provisional timeline of events released by the Prime Minister’s office.\n\nLabour Party leader Keir Starmer will then have an audience with the King, who will officially ask him to form a government.\n\nStarmer will then travel to Downing Street and address the nation as new Prime Minister at around 12.20 p.m. local time (7.20 a.m. ET).\n\nPro-Palestinian independent candidates upset Labour in three constituencies\n\nWhile it undoubtedly has been a good night for Labour, its stance on the war in Gaza has cost the party votes.\n\nPro-Palestinian independent candidates have managed to upset Labour in three constituencies the party won in 2019: Blackburn, Leicester South and Islington North.\n\nAdnan Hussain, who promised to make sure that opposition to “the injustice being inflicted against the people of Gaza be heard,” won in Blackburn, a constituency which had previously voted Labour in every election since it was created in 1955.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour’s Shadow Paymaster General Jonathan Ashworth, who had been Leicester South’s MP since 2011, was unseated by the independent candidate Shockat Adam, who won 35.2% compared to Ashworth’s 32.9%.\n\n“As a genocide is being committed in Gaza, according to all human rights observers, many have expressed feeling betrayed and ignored on this matter,” Adam said in his campaign to win the Leicester South constituency.\n\nFormer left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was expelled from the party in a spat over antisemitism, won the Islington North constituency as an independent. His win gives him the opportunity to challenge the current Labour leader (and next PM) Keir Starmer in parliament, who has sought to remold Labour from the Corbyn era.\n\nHowever, Labour has gained the Rochdale constituency from the pro-Palestine politician George Galloway.\n\nGalloway dramatically won the constituency in a by-election earlier this year, in which he accused the “political class” of having “failed Rochdale, failed Britain and failed Gaza.”\n\nLiz Truss loses her seat, an epic collapse for the short-lived former prime minister\n\nBritain’s former Prime Minister Liz Truss has suffered another unprecedented humiliation, losing her seat and being dumped from parliament less than two years after she led the country.\n\nTruss was prime minister for just six weeks, by some distance the shortest stint in British history. Her premiership collapsed after a shambolic financial plan spooked markets and investors and caused the value of the pound to plummet.\n\nShe refused to speak after her defeat, leaving the stage with her fellow candidates instead, attempting to retain a steely look on her face.\n\nTruss lost by 630 votes. She picked up 11,217 votes, to Labour’s 11,847.\n\nHer defeat is one of the most staggering moments in the long history of British elections. It trumps the famous moment in 1997 when Defence Secretary Michael Portillo lost his seat; even among the worst-case forecasts for the Conservatives, few imagined that Truss could be defeated in her once ultra-safe Tory safe.\n\nRishi Sunak had sought to distance the Conservatives from Truss’s tenure, but she nonetheless represented the party in the seat she has held since 2010.\n\nShe now becomes the face of the Conservatives’ collapse, on an unprecedented night that saw the ruling party thoroughly rejected by the electorate.\n\nConservative Party loses all its MPs in Wales\n\nThe Conservative Party has lost all 14 of its members of parliament in Wales, as Welsh Secretary David TC Davies lost his seat to Labour.\n\nDavies finished second in his constituency of Monmouthshire, with 34.8% of the vote, compared to Labour candidate Catherine Fookes’ 41.3%.\n\nThree other former Welsh secretaries lost their seats: Alun Cairns lost to Labour in Vale of Glamorgan, Stephen Crabb lost to Labour in Mid and South Pembrokeshire, and Simon Hart lost to Plaid Cymru in Caerfyrddin.\n\n\"Change begins now,\" Keir Starmer tells victory rally in London\n\nThe soon-to-be new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has addressed cheering supporters at a Labour Party victory rally in central London, and pledged “national renewal” following 14 years of Conservative rule.\n\n“You campaigned for it, you fought for it, you voted for it and now it has arrived. Change begins now,” Starmer told Labour staff. “It feels good, I have to be honest … This is what it is for. A changed Labour party, ready to serve our country.”\n\nHowever, Starmer cautioned that having “a mandate like this comes with a great responsibility.”\n\nSpeaking a few moments after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak conceded defeat in the general election, Starmer said, “Our task is nothing less than renewing the ideas that hold this country together. National renewal. If you work hard, if you play by the rules, this country should give you a fair chance to get on… We have to restore that.”\n\nHe continued: “We have to return politics to public service, show that politics can be a force for good. Make no mistake, that is the great test for politics in this era. The fight for trust is the battle that defines our age.”\n\nLabour has officially won the election\n\nLabour has won 326 seats, the crucial number that secures them a parliamentary majority and ensures Keir Starmer will become prime minister in the coming hours.\n\nMinutes earlier, outgoing PM and Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak conceded defeat, telling people at the count in his seat: “I am sorry.”\n\n“The Labour Party has won this general election,” Sunak said, adding that he had called Starmer to congratulate him and concede the election.\n\nThe milestone marks the end of one era and the start of another; the Conservatives have ruled Britain for 14 years, but Labour has ousted them from power for the first time since 1997.\n\nFive years ago, when the Tories won a thumping majority, this moment would have seemed unthinkable. But Starmer has turned his party around while the Conservatives collapsed, slumping from scandal to scandal and changing their leader twice since that vote.\n\nThere are still many more seats to declare, and Labour is on course for a huge majority that will make Starmer a powerful prime minister. He will travel to Buckingham Palace on Friday to formally take control of the country.\n\nRishi Sunak concedes defeat, saying \"Labour has won this election\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has conceded defeat in the general election, telling people at the count in his seat: “I am sorry.”\n\n“The Labour Party has won this general election,” Sunak said, adding that he has called Keir Starmer to congratulate him and concede the election.\n\nJust 20 voters decided a crucial seat\n\nThe Conservatives have held a key seat by the narrowest of margins: just 20 people ensured that party’s chairman Richard Holden won Basildon and Billericay.\n\nA recount was ordered in the constituency, which went right down to wire: if just 11 votes that were initially counted for the Conservatives had in fact been for Labour, the seat would have turned red.\n\nThis constituency has been an extremely secure stronghold for the Conservatives; so safe that Holden moved himself from a northeastern seat to contest this one, against the opposition of local Tories.\n\nBut the Conservatives’ collapse and Labour’s surge turned it into a stunningly close battleground. The final tally put Holden on 12,905 votes; Labour’s Alex Harrison on 12,885 votes and Reform UK’s Stephen Conlay on 11,354 votes.\n\nRight-wing populist Nigel Farage becomes MP for the first time after winning in Clacton\n\nNigel Farage, the right-wing populist leader of the Reform UK party, has become an MP at the eighth attempt, winning a seat in the heavily pro-Brexit town of Clacton.\n\nFarage’s Reform UK party has attacked the Conservatives on their failure to bring down rates of legal and illegal migration, and their message won over a considerable number of socially conservative former Tory voters.\n\nThe veteran Euroskeptic played a leading role in bringing about Britain’s departure from the European Union, and has remained a divisive and disruptive figure in the country’s politics since.\n\nBut he has never been elected to parliament, losing seven elections since 1994 before this victory. He won Clacton on a massive swing towards Reform, picking up 21,225 votes to the Conservatives’ 12,820.\n\n“It’s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the centre right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that’s exactly what I’m going to do,” Farage said after winning the seat.\n\nHe pledged to “challenge the general election properly in 2029,” and promised to turn his rhetoric towards Labour as they seem set to enter government.\n\nHis presence during the election campaign upended the Tories’ efforts to win back socially conservative, pro-Brexit voters. Now, he’ll likely be a prominent outside voice as the Conservatives decide on their next direction as the new opposition party.\n\nCNN visited Clacton in the run-up to the election, to take the temperature of voters and assess how Farage’s anti-immigration message was received.\n\nTwo Cabinet ministers lose seconds apart\n\nTwo Conservative Cabinet ministers have lost their seats just seconds apart, as the scale of the Tories’ misery increases on a devastating election night.\n\nDefence Secretary Grant Shapps lost his seat to Labour in Welwyn Hatfield, the most high-profile defeat of the night so far.\n\nShapps has held a number of Cabinet positions under different prime ministers, including energy security and net zero secretary, business, energy and industrial strategy secretary and home secretary. He was elected to parliament in 2005.\n\nHe lost his seat to Labour’s Andrew Lewin, who won by 3,799 votes. It’s quite the fall from grace after he secured his seat back in 2019 with a majority of almost 11,000 votes.\n\nHe had been one of a number of prominent Tory candidates expected to lose their seat after the exit poll released.\n\nAlmost at the same time, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk lost his seat to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe twin defeats painted the perfect picture of a miserable night for the Conservatives, who have been carved up by Labour and the Lib Dems across the country.\n\nAnd it could get worse – more Cabinet ministers are at risk, including the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt – in what could be an unprecedented evening.\n\nWhat the UK front pages are looking like\n\nWe’re starting to get a glimpse of the Friday morning front pages which are obviously being dominated by the results of the exit poll, which foreshadows a Labour landslide and an undeniably poor showing from the Conservatives.\n\nThe Sun has opted to emphasize Labour’s win with the electoral map and a front page emblazoned with “Britain sees red.”\n\nTabloid paper the Daily Mirror has a full page shot of the Labour leader and his wife as they cast their vote on Thursday, with the headline: “KEIR WE GO.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Daily Express has gone with “CRUSHING BLOW TO TORY PARTY IN ELECTION WIPEOUT” with a photo of Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak and his wife.\n\nKeir Starmer says \"it is time for us to deliver\" after winning seat\n\nKer Starmer, who seems likely to be Britain’s next prime minister, said the country is “ready for change” after winning his seat in north London.\n\n“Tonight, people here and around the country have spoken. They are ready for change,” Starmer said at the count.\n\nStarmer was beaming as he arrived at the count, posing for selfies and taking his time to work his way through supporters and activists.\n\nOn stage, he was joined by a number of novelty candidates – including one dressed as Elmo – a unique feature of British democracy.\n\n“I promise this: Whether you voted for me or not, I will serve every person in this constituency,” Starmer said.\n\nLeft-wing populist George Galloway loses his seat to Labour\n\nLabour has narrowly defeated the left-wing populist George Galloway in a key race in Rochdale, easing concerns within the party that its stance on Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza had damaged its reputation among Muslim voters.\n\nGalloway won this seat months ago in a by-election, running on a heavily pro-Palestinian platform in the northwestern English town, which has a large Muslim population.\n\nBut Labour has returned to power in the constituency, beating Galloway by 33% to 29%.\n\nLabour was initially strongly supportive of Israel’s war against Hamas, but it has become increasingly critical of its conduct in Gaza and now supports a ceasefire, along with the return of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nIts early response nonetheless hit its support among Muslim voters during May’s local elections, a trend that has worried many in the party.\n\nPopulist Reform UK party wins its first seat of the night\n\nReform UK’s Lee Anderson has won election in Ashfield, giving the right-wing populist group its first victory of the night.\n\nAnderson was formerly the deputy chair of the Conservative Party, but he defected to Reform in January, criticizing Rishi Sunak’s record on controlling migration.\n\nHe called Ashfield the “capital of common sense,” telling people at his count: “This wonderful place which I call my home is going to have a massive say in how this country is shaped in the future. I want my country back and Ashfield can play their part in that.”\n\nWinning this seat was a key target for the right-wing party, and it will hope to add a second soon, when results are announced in Clacton, where the party’s leader Nigel Farage is standing.\n\nReform were projected to win 13 seats in the exit poll. But the party earlier failed to pick up two seats in which the exit poll had projected them winners, suggesting it may fall short of that eye-catching overall predicted figure.\n\n“Reports of my demise had been greatly exaggerated,” Labour’s Dan Jarvis joked, after winning Barnsley North despite the exit poll projecting he would lose it to Reform.\n\nHow Labour's \"ming vase\" campaign steered it to victory\n\nThe Labour Party had a very good problem at the start when the election was called: How do you run a campaign that absolutely everyone expects you to win?\n\nKeir Starmer’s party had enjoyed a double-digit lead in opinion polls for the entirety of Rishi Sunak’s premiership, which began in October 2022, and was guaranteed to win the election as long as it didn’t rock the boat during the six-week campaign.\n\nLabour appealed to an electorate tired of the Tories’ chaotic period in government with a single-word slogan: “Change.” But Starmer simultaneously followed a path that some party strategists took to calling a “ming vase” approach, metaphorically looking after a precious and delicate lead in opinion polls. The party repeated its key themes, avoided the temptation to unveil any major policy announcements, and pledged time after time that the party would keep a tight lid on public finances.\n\nThe party’s manifesto was modest, pledging to revive Britain’s flagging public services without a large injection of cash. That has raised eyebrows by independent watchdogs, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which said their public spending offer was “tiny, going on trivial.”\n\nBut that was a calculation Labour has stuck to, as they sought to gain a reputation as a sensible, moderate party that can appeal to former Tory voters.\n\nStarmer avoided gaffes, and didn’t interrupt his opponent Rishi Sunak when he was making mistakes of his own.\n\nAnd he became an increasingly difficult rival for the Conservatives to land successful attacks against. Sunak strived to convince voters that Starmer would increase taxes, make Britain less safe, and that he didn’t have the stamina for the job of prime minister — but none of these charges appear to have stuck.\n\nLabour’s projected victory is a personal triumph for Keir Starmer that once seemed impossible\n\nThe Labour Party’s projected victory marks a historic moment in modern British political history and a huge personal triumph for Keir Starmer, the Labour leader who is set to become the country’s next prime minister.\n\nThe UK broadcasters’ exit poll suggests Labour will have a parliamentary majority of 170, returning the party to office for the first time since it lost the 2010 election to the Conservatives, who have been in power ever since.\n\nStarmer’s victory is all the more remarkable considering the journey that Labour has been on since the last general election in 2019. Then, the party suffered its worst loss in a generation under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, who stood on a hard-left platform.\n\nA path back to credibility and even being competitive in a general election looked potentially a decade off, as the Conservatives emerged triumphant from the carnage of Brexit under the charismatic – but chaotic – leadership of Boris Johnson.\n\nJohnson not only defeated his political rivals, but completely upended the norms of British politics. Under his leadership, his party won seats in traditional working-class Labour areas once deemed out of reach to Conservatives. For a year at least, he seemed untouchable.\n\nIt was in this context that Starmer took control of a broken Labour Party on April 4, 2020. On that day, David Lammy, one of his Labour colleagues, took him to one side and warned Starmer: “Set yourself a 10-year cycle. You might just lose the next election, and then you can go again.”\n\nAccording to Lammy, Starmer smiled and said “No, I can do this in five.”\n\nRead more here\n\nLabour will work with Trump if he becomes US president, UK's shadow foreign secretary says\n\nA Labour government would work with Donald Trump if he is voted back in as US president, the UK’s shadow foreign secretary has said. Labour is projected to win 410 seats in the British election and take a massive parliamentary majority of 170 seats, according to the exit poll.\n\nWhen asked if Labour would work with Trump, David Lammy told ITV his party would work “with whomever the American people decide should be incumbent at the White House.”\n\nHe noted that both the UK and US are “democratic countries,” highlighting that the two countries work successfully together in areas such as intelligence and armed forces.\n\n\"The British people have chosen change:\" Labour politicians react with delight to exit poll\n\nSenior Labour politicians have praised Keir Starmer for taking his party to the “cusp of power” following its projected success in the exit poll.\n\nLabour’s shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said he was “delighted” by the exit poll, which he called “remarkable.”\n\n“I’ve seen many exit polls over the years. They don’t tend to look like these ones, and if we have won this general election, that is historic for the Labour Party,” he told the BBC.\n\nIn the first victory speech of the night, Labour shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson, who won Houghton and Sunderland South, said the British people have “chosen the leadership of Keir Starmer.”\n\n“Tonight the British people have spoken and if the exit poll this evening is again a guide to results across our country – as it so often is – then after 14 years the British people have chosen change,” she said.\n\nLabour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said Starmer had demonstrated “a sense of conviction and confidence.”\n\n“It’s been difficult, there have been some wobbly moments… In my wildest dreams, four and a half years ago, did I think we’d be here? No,” he told the BBC. He added that the Labour Party under the leadership of Starmer has been taken to “the cusp of power.”\n\nAs Europe turns right, why is a center-left party projected to win by a landslide in the UK?\n\nThe United Kingdom’s decision to hand the center-left Labour Party a parliamentary majority, according to the exit poll, comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge.\n\nLast month’s European elections saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. The results caused such chaos that French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election in his own country, the first round of which the far-right National Rally won last week.\n\nA government comprised of far-right figures was formed in the Netherlands this week. Italy is led by the most right-wing leader since the rule of fascist wartime leader Benito Mussolini. These electoral victories and the prospect of populist right-wingers in power is no longer a surprise in European countries.\n\nThere are many reasons for this rise in populism, often unique to individual countries. But broadly speaking, a number of European countries are suffering from sluggish economies, high immigration and higher energy prices, due in part to the drive for carbon net zero. The European Union is often blamed for national woes by populist politicians and breathes oxygen into an increasingly Euroskeptic national discourse.\n\nSo why is Britain, the only country where Euroskepticism led to a referendum on EU membership, projected to buck this trend?\n\nDespite the expected seat count, the British right is far from dead. The Conservative Party, despite its undeniably disappointing night, is set to outperform the expectations of a number of opinion polls during the campaign, some of which had it down to double digits in parliament.\n\nAnother party that is set to exceed polling expectations is the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by long-term scourge of the Conservatives, Nigel Farage, who is perhaps best known these days for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump. Before this, he was credited with making Brexit possible after decades of campaigning against the UK’s membership of the EU.\n\nFarage’s political success to date has all come without him holding a parliamentary seat. Now he is not only projected to have a seat himself, but also 12 colleagues to hurl grenades at Labour leader Keir Starmer. While this may seem small fry compared to Starmer’s anticipated three-figure majority, Farage will no doubt influence the debate on the future direction of the Conservative Party, possibly dragging it further to the right.\n\nIt is possible that Farage’s splitting of the right has actually helped Starmer increase his majority in parliament. An odd quirk of British politics is that the percentage of votes a party gets doesn’t necessarily translate to seats. And with Reform performing well in many of the seats that Labour will ultimately win, the hard-right will not only be impossible to ignore in this parliament, but it could easily see its influence grow further.\n\nBritain suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries. If Starmer falters as prime minister, there is every chance that the popular right could continue to capture the public’s imagination, as it has elsewhere in Europe.\n\nA disastrous Conservative campaign puts the party on the brink of a worst-ever defeat\n\nThe sight was pitiful – and could easily have been avoided. When Rishi Sunak called the snap vote outside 10 Downing Street, he was drowned out – first by the pouring rain, then by the sound of the D:Ream song “Things Can Only Get Better,” the anthem of Labour’s 1997 election landslide, blaring from a nearby boombox.\n\nThings did not get better for the Conservatives. The campaign went from bad to worse, ending in what is projected to be a heavy defeat. Trying to make smalltalk at a Welsh brewery at an early campaign event, Sunak asked punters if they were excited for the soccer, only to be reminded that Wales had not qualified for the ongoing European Championship. In another campaign stop at the Northern Ireland shipyard that built the Titanic, Sunak, seemingly unaware of the irony, was asked if he, too, was captaining a sinking ship.\n\nBut those gaffes look minor when compared to Sunak’s disastrous decision to leave the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings early to give a routine TV interview that would not air until the following week. The Tories’ patriotic heartlands were outraged: The prime minister left veterans on the beaches. Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform UK party, was delighted: Here was an opportunity to snatch more votes from dyspeptic Tories.\n\nMeanwhile, one last sleaze scandal had been brewing. It was revealed that two Conservative candidates and its director of campaigning were under investigation by the gambling watchdog for allegedly placing bets on the date of the general election.\n\n“Gamble-gate,” as it became known, summed up what for many voters may be their lasting impression of the outgoing Conservative government: A prime minister too weak to control many of his party, and a party more interested in its own fortunes than those of the country.\n\nThe UK's exit poll is usually very accurate\n\nA reminder: the UK’s election exit poll is usually a very accurate barometer of how many seats each party has won.\n\nBut, as politicians are reminding broadcasters, it is just a poll.\n\nThe exit poll was conducted Thursday at polling stations across the country, collecting a huge sample from across the UK of how people voted. It is then modelled by a panel of experts, and closely guarded from the public and the media.\n\nIn 2019, the exit poll predicted the Conservatives would win 368 seats, just three more than they did when the final results were in. Two years earlier, it missed the Tories’ seat total by three, this time in the opposite direction.\n\n“A massacre:” Senior Tories react to exit poll results\n\nSenior Conservative politicians have responded with shock to the Labour Party’s projected landslide win in Britain’s general election.\n\nRuth Davidson, the former leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, told Sky News: “There is no dressing it up, this is a massacre.”\n\nFormer Conservative Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, who is forecast to lose his seat, told Sky News that he is “used to what defeat looks like and I’m prepared for it.” But he said he hoped his political life would continue. “I’ll be leaving parliament to spend more time on politics,” he quipped.\n\nSteve Baker, who was Rishi Sunak’s Minister of State for Northern Ireland, told the BBC that “it’s a pretty devastating night for the Conservative Party.” Baker is also projected to lose his seat.\n\nBaker said that he’s got a “great deal of respect for Rishi Sunak.” He later added: “I think he will do what he believes is in the national interest.”\n\nShortly before polls closed at 10 p.m., Sunak thanked voters on X. He said: “To the hundreds of Conservative candidates, thousands of volunteers and millions of voters: Thank you for your hard work, thank you for your support, and thank you for your vote.”\n\nHow each party has fared in the exit poll\n\nLabour is projected to win 410 seats, and a massive majority of 170 seats. This would fall just short of the party’s best-ever result, in 1997, when Tony Blair’s Labour won 418 seats, a majority of 179. The result is in line with what pollsters had projected for Labour, which has enjoyed a huge lead in public opinion for years and had held onto that advantage throughout the campaign.\n\nFor the Conservatives, the result is calamitous. The party, which has earned a reputation over the decades as a ruthless election winner, is projected to win just suffer its worst result since its modern iteration was formed in the 1830s. It is an overwhelming rejection of a ruling party by the British electorate, which has dumped the party from government.\n\nThe centrist Liberal Democrats will be pleased with their result, which puts them on course to return as the UK’s third-largest party. The group has suffered since it joined the Tories in a coalition government between 2010 and 2015, but voters have seemingly forgiven them for that stint.\n\nThe Scottish National Party, a pro-independence group that has dominated politics in Scotland for a generation, will be devastated with the forecast. It signals that the Labour Party has regained its historic strength in Scotland and represents a setback for the Scottish independence movement.\n\nAnd Reform UK, the right-wing populist group led by Nigel Farage, has been forecast to win more seats that most pollsters expected. Farage has hammered the Conservatives on their failure to bring down legal and illegal migration, and had been expected to win the seat where he was standing in Clacton, east of London.\n\nKeir Starmer thanks voters and campaigners, as exit poll puts him on the cusp of power\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer has thanked campaigners and voters, but he hasn’t commented yet on the results of the exit poll that forecast him a huge majority.\n\nAngela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the exit poll numbers were “encouraging.”\n\n“Keir Starmer has done a tremendous job of transforming the Labour Party and putting forward a program for government that I’m hopeful that people have got behind,” she told BBC immediately after the poll numbers dropped.\n\nRayner said it would “be an absolute honor and a privilege to be reelected,” but added, “I’m not counting my chickens until we’ve got those results coming in.”\n\nWhat election day has looked like across Britain\n\nVoters up and down Britain have been putting their cross in their ballot papers, as church halls, schools and sports centers turn into polling stations for the day.\n\nAnd plenty of Brits brought their four-legged companions along for the experience.\n\nBroadcasters can’t report much about the election while polls are open – but there’s no rules preventing us from showing you as many democratic dogs as possible.\n\nThere’s less than an hour until we can bring you some real news – that’s when the exit poll will drop and we’ll get a sense of how the day has gone for all the parties.\n\nWhy can’t we report anything about the election yet?\n\nThere is a limit to how much we can tell you about Britain’s election – at least until polls close in an hour or so.\n\nThat’s because the country has strict rules on reporting while people are still voting. They apply to all broadcasters licensed in the United Kingdom, including CNN, forbidding them from reporting on campaign issues, opinion polls, political statements and candidates until the polling stations shut in the evening.\n\nThe restrictions are far stronger than in many countries, such as the United States, where candidates continue campaigning on election day as they try to drive as many voters to the polls as possible.\n\nThe UK’s Office of Communications (Ofcom) enforces the regulations, which are designed to ensure political coverage is impartial and to prevent the media from influencing voters as ballots are being cast.\n\nIt means that on election day, you won’t hear journalists or pundits speculating about politics on Britain’s TV and radio airwaves, or on digital sites.\n\nBut that all changes at 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET), the moment polls close.\n\nHow does the UK’s general election work?\n\nBritain has a first-past-the-post voting system – the make-up of its next parliament won’t be decided by vote share, but by how many seats each party wins.\n\nPeople have been casting ballots in each of the country’s 650 constituencies, selecting the member of parliament (MP) to represent the area.\n\nThe leader of the party that wins a majority of those constituencies becomes prime minister, and can form a government. That means 326 is the magic number for an overall majority.\n\nIf no party reaches that mark, the largest party could seek to lead as a minority government, or it could enter a coalition with other groups to get it over the line."
