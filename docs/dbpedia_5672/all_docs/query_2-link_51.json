        "text": "PENNY MORDAUNT MP Portsmouth North\n\nPenelope Mary Mordaunt, known as Penny Mordaunt, is a Conservative politician in the United Kingdom. She was first elected as the member of parliament for Portsmouth North at the 2010 general election. Mordaunt was appointed Secretary of State for International Development on 9 November 2017, an interesting position where we are presently Brexiting, so destroying international relations close to home, presumably requiring bolstering with the rest of the world.\n\nPenny replaced Priti Patel on 9 November, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures.\n\nMs Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions. She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary.\n\nPenny Mordaunt, was elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit.\n\nCONSERVATIVE MPS 2017-2018\n\nCONSERVATIVE CLIMATE - Michael Gove has been summoned to Brussels because of his party's failure to meet air pollution targets despite warnings about which the Prime Minister was aware of.\n\nUK POLITICS\n\nThe United Kingdom has many political parties, some of which are represented in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Below are links to the websites of the political parties that were represented in the House of Commons after the 2015 General Election:\n\nCONSERVATIVE PARTY\n\nCO-OPERATIVE PARTY\n\nDEMOCRAT UNIONIST PARTY\n\nGREEN PARTY\n\nLABOUR PARTY\n\nLIBERAL DEMOCRATS\n\nPLAID CYMRU\n\nSCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY\n\nSINN FEIN\n\nSOCIAL DEMOCRATIC AND LABOUR PARTY\n\nUK INDEPENDENCE PARTY\n\nULSTER UNIONIST PARTY\n\nConservative Party\n\nCo-operative Party\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party\n\nGreen Party\n\nLabour Party\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nPlaid Cymru\n\nScottish National Party\n\nSinn FÃ©in\n\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party\n\nUK Independence Party\n\nUlster Unionist Party\n\nWe are concerned with how the make up of the above parties and (reasonably) popular policies may affect the Wealden district, because we are all brothers on two islands in the Atlantic Ocean and what we do or fail to do is likely to rebound on ourselves and our fellow man in other nations around the world. How we act today influences policies in other countries in our global community. It is not just about us and our patch.\n\nDISTRICT & BOROUGH COUNCILS\n\nEast Sussex has five District and Borough Councils, each with a border on the coast. From west to east they are:\n\nEastbourne Borough Council\n\nHastings Borough Council\n\nLewes District Council\n\nRother District Council\n\nWealden District Council\n\nThere is also East Sussex County Council as the provider of services to the 5 East Sussex districts."
