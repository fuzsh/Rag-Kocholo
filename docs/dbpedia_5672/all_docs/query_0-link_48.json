        "text": "The Conservative Party suffered a crushing defeat in last week’s election, losing grip on power after 14 years in government.\n\nThe party lost over 244 seats across the country to a parties across the political spectrum, with seats being handed over to Labour, Reform, Liberal Democrats and even the Green Party in places.\n\nPrior to the vote on July 4, a raft of Tory MP’s including Michael Gove and Nadhim Zahawi made it clear they would not be running again - perhaps pre-empting their fate in the face of dire opinion polls.\n\nFor those who did decide they had a chance of re-election, the outcome was decidedly bleak with 175 incumbent MPs being shown the exit door by their constituents.\n\nA record-breaking 11 cabinet ministers lost their seats as Rishi Sunak’s government faced a general election bloodbath. Mr Sunak apologised to the country and his party as he resigned as leader of the Conservatives.\n\nJohnny Mercer, Grant Shapps, Gillian Keegan, Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt were among the Tory big beasts that fell.\n\nOthers who had been under threat, including chancellor Jeremy Hunt, business secretary Kemi Badenoch and home secretary James Cleverly, clung on despite challenges in their seats.\n\nFormer minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, who lost his own North East Somerset seat to Labour, blamed the defeat on “failing to deliver on Conservative core principles”.\n\nWhile prominent cabinet members and a former prime minister lost their seats, their colleagues also faced defeat in historic numbers.\n\nOne hundred and seventy-five MPs lost their seats in the wipeout – more than the 121 seats the Tories clung on to in total.\n\nAdam Holloway (Gravesham)\n\nAlexander Stafford (Rother Valley)\n\nAlex Chalk (Cheltenham)\n\nAlun Cairns (Vale of Glamorgan)\n\nAmanda Milling
