        "text": "A former Cabinet minister who now holds a junior job at the Department for International Trade, Mordaunt may well think she is destined for bigger things. There are whispers she has begun putting together a team of MPs to run her leadership bid should a vacancy arise. Her combination of Brexiteer credentials and socially liberal views is seen by allies as an election-winning formula and has led to comparisons with the London mayor-era Boris Johnson. Mordaunt polls remarkably well with grassroots party members given her relatively low profile during the past few years, but she will have to compete with big hitters like Tom Tugendhat and Jeremy Hunt for the left-wing Tory vote.\n\nJob: International trade minister\n\nYear elected: 2010"
