        "text": "By Joseph Gellman\n\nIn just under two years, Keir Starmer will be hoping to end what will have been 14 years of Conservative rule and form the first Labour government since the days of Gordon Brown. Standing in his way will be a Conservative Prime Minister whose identity we do not yet know. Following on from Boris Johnson’s resignation, we have been left with a field of numerous potential replacements, each of which represents both threats and opportunities for Labour to be anxious about or ready to take advantage of. The candidate they should fear most is Penny Mordaunt.\n\nUnlike many of the other big names of the Conservative Party, Mordaunt is from a fairly humble background. She attended a state school and was the primary caregiver of her younger brother after her mother passed away from breast cancer when she was just 15. To get through sixth form, Mordaunt had to work as a magician’s assistant to raise the necessary funds, and she became the first member of her family to attend university. Before attending university, she spent her gap year working in hospitals and orphanages in Romania. In a world where politicians are being perceived as increasingly out of touch, Mordaunt’s struggles and hard work in early life could be seen to make her more relatable to the electorate. For Starmer and the Labour Party, an alternative leader, such as Rishi Sunak, would be preferable, due to them being from better-off backgrounds and thus easier to accuse of being out of touch and not truly understanding the struggles of the average worker.\n\nWhilst Mordaunt may not be a significant household name, it would be unfair for Labour to accuse her of not having the experience to be Prime Minister. Having served in Theresa May’s Cabinet in multiple positions, she has also taken up various junior ministerial offices and has now been a Member of Parliament for over a decade. She has far more experience than David Cameron when he took over as leader of the Conservative Party in 2005, who only spent a matter of months in Michael Howard’s Shadow Cabinet before replacing him. With the party considering candidates with even less experience, such as Kemi Badenoch, potential supporters of Mordaunt should be at ease with the career she has led so far.\n\nIf the Conservative Party wants to sustain their majority in 2024, it will need to find a way to keep the former Labour heartlands in the North, whilst appealing to more liberal seats in the South under threat from the Liberal Democrats, as well as Labour. Most candidates may appeal to one demographic but not the other, risking a chunk of the majority being lost; if losses are significant enough it could be overturned completely, leading to the formation of a Labour government. Understandably, Starmer would hope for a leader who would ensure such an outcome; Mordaunt does not fit this bill though.\n\nIn terms of appealing to the Northern seats gained in 2019, Mordaunt was a supporter of the campaign to leave the European Union in 2016. Some of the other front runners, such as Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, and Tom Tugendhat, supported the ‘Remain’ campaign and would be far less trusted in the constituencies that supported the decision to leave. With Brexit remaining a relevant issue, a Conservative leader that can display consistent support for leaving the European Union would be able to appeal better to those who voted Conservative for the first time in 2019. With Starmer only very recently committing to a “hard” Brexit, Mordaunt would have a massive advantage over him, especially when his policy as Shadow Brexit Secretary advocated for a second referendum of sorts (a policy which many believe contributed to Labour’s massive losses in 2019).\n\nHowever, Mordaunt’s appeal is not limited to those of a more socially conservative ilk. In fact, she is arguably the most socially liberal candidate standing. A strong supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, Mordaunt has stood up for the rights of the transgender community in Parliament, asserting that transgender men are men, and transgender women are women. This sets her apart from other candidates who have tried to avoid the topic entirely or have simply been outwardly transphobic. Suella Braverman, for example, launched her campaign with a variety of statements on which she stood for, the final of which was heavily transphobic. Less moderate candidates like her would not receive much support from the more liberal seats currently held by the Conservative Party, something that both Labour and the Liberal Democrats would benefit from.\n\nFinally, Mordaunt’s political career so far has been one that has avoided major controversy. The current frontrunner, according to both the bookies and MP nominations, is Rishi Sunak. As I am sure everyone will recall, Sunak was very recently fined for breaking lockdown rules, something which contributed to the fall of Johnson. If he became Prime Minister, Starmer would have a field day at the next election, exposing Sunak as being a dishonest man who broke the rules that the government he served in put in place. Mordaunt does not have these same skeletons in her closet and would therefore not suffer the same electoral trouble that Sunak would surely run into.\n\nOut of the many Conservative politicians currently fighting to be the next Prime Minister, it is clear that Keir Starmer should fear Penny Mordaunt the most. She has many years of experience in both Parliament and Government. Further to this, Mordaunt is perhaps the only Conservative candidate who can appeal to both socially conservative and socially liberal voters. Finally, she has one of the very rare political assets of being free of any major scandal. If the Conservative Party want to maintain power after the 2024 election, it is her that they should elect. If Keir Starmer ever wishes to become Prime Minister, he will be heavily hoping that anyone but her becomes Boris Johnson’s replacement.\n\nImage: Number 10 via Flickr"
