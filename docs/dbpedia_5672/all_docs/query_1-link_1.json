Any information you can provide about your family members, past or present, would be very welcome. Please forward to henry@mordaunt.me.uk.\n\nThis page was last amended in July, 2024\n\nIt is more than likely that descendents and family of the Baronet Mordaunts are already well aware of their family tree. Much of the following has been taken from \"The Baronetage of England\" by William Betham, published by William Miller in 1801, (isn't 'Google Books' wonderful?), supplemented from other sources including \"Massingham Parva, Past and Present\" by Ronald Fisher McLeod, published by Waterow in 1882, and modern publications such as Burke's Peerage and Debrett's, available in any central public reference library in the United Kingdom\n\nSir L'Estrange Mordaunt (abt. 1572 - 1628?), whose ancestry is described on the previous webpages, purchased the baronetcy in 1611.\n\nL'Estrange,\n\npainted on wood,\n\nJanuary 1612. The idea of creating and selling baronetcies was a bright idea by King James I (James VI of Scotland) to get round his limited tax raising powers. The cost was £1,095 (equivalent to about £150,000 in 2022) over three years. Until then L'Estrange had pursued a military career, first serving in Flanders against Spain where he met, courted and married 1. Margaret (? - 1606), the daughter of Peter de Charles, a Flemish gentleman from Antwerp. She was presumably the Margaret Mordant (sic) for whom an Act of naturalization was passed on Parliament in 1604. In 1598 he served in the Earl of Essex's ill-fated expedition to Ireland, and in 1600/1601 served in Ireland under Mountjoy. Would he there have met his mysterious kinsman, Nicholas Mordaunt? In 1602 he succeeded to his grandfather's estates. L'Estrange married 2. Frances Sotherton (? - 1621), a widow, daughter of Sir Robert Cheek of Debnam. Frances was buried in St. John's, Maddermarket, central Norwich, now under the care of the Redundant Churches Fund. L'Estrange was buried with his first wife in Little Massingham church\n\nI am very grateful to Sylvie Nicholls, who made contact through the Guest Book and forwarded to me a scan of the painting in the possession of a friend.\n\nSir Robert Mordaunt 2nd Bart. (abt. or before 1590 - 1638), who married Amy Southerton, presuably related to his step-mother. According to 'Massingham Parva, Past and Present' they had a total of seven children five of whom were born and baptized at Little Massingham.\n\nRobert Mordaunt . (? - ?) died in infancy, or so says one source. I am not certain he necessarily was the firstborn. There was another son Robert (of Hesperton) who did grow to manhood, see below.\n\nSir Charles Mordaunt 3rd Bart. (abt. 1615 - 10th July 1648) married Catherine, daughter of Sir Lionel Tollemache. According to 'Massingham Parva, Past and Present' she was the widow of Drake William Playters by whom she had six children. Then, with Charles her second husband she had a further seven children but I am not at all certain as to their order of the birth. I do not know how she could fit all that in the time available! After her second widowhood, she married Sir Charles Lee of Billeslee in Warwickshire.\n\nSiding with the King in the Civil War, he was inside King's Lynn during its three-week seige by parliamentarian forces, August/September 1643. A clause of the treaty of capitulation allowed \"gentlemen strangers in the town to have liberty to depart, with every man a horse, sword and pistols\" and with a guarantee for the safety of their estates. Charles consequently was released and retired to Little Massingham. However, later accused of complicity with an intended Royalist rising, the Little Massingham estates were sequestered and he retired to London with his family. On his death his body was carried to Little Massingham for burial.\n\nSir Charles Mordaunt 4th Bart. (1638 - 24th April 1664) was baptised at Fakenham Magna, Suffolk, on 11th November 1638. He married Elizabeth Johnson (abt 1645 - ?) of St Gregory,London, at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf on 18th December 1663, but he died without issue. His widow, still only 24 years old, married Francis Godolphin, of Colston, Wiltshire at St. Botolph's, Aldersgate, London, 26th August, 1669. Was she The Lady Elizabeth Mordaunt buried in St. Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London, on 6th October, 1687? On her second marriage she may not have wanted to have given up her title of \"Lady\"\n\nCatherine (Kate) Mordaunt (1640 - 1705) was baptised at Fakenham Magna, Suffolk, on 7th May 1640. She died unmarried and was, apparently, the last Mordaunt to be interred in the church at Little Massingham\n\nTollemarche Mordaunt (1642 - 1644) was baptised at Fakenham Magna, Suffolk, on 6th January 1642 (1643 in new calender?). He was a boy in case you are curious!\n\nHenry Mordaunt was baptised in late 1643 and died three days later\n\nSir John Mordaunt 5th Bart (1643 - 6th September 1721) was baptised in late 1643. He married 1st Anne Risley (abt. 1661 - before 1695) on 13th June 1678, by curious coincidence at the local church of his distant cousins, \"the Mordaunts of the Hill\" at Caldecote, Northill. I wonder if he invited them all as guests. Curiously, the transcription of his licence application gave his age as \"about 21\" when he was clearly about 35 years old; perhaps this is an error for \"above 21.\" His bride's age was given as 17 years, permission \"by her mother's consent.\"\n\nPenelope Mordaunt who died young. In 1701 her father's uncle, Robert, wrote commiserating on the death of his daughter. Perhaps this was the young Penelope. The letter is in Warwickshire County Archives.\n\nPerhaps saddened by its associations, John seems to have quitted Massingham and to have retired to Walton in Warwickshire. Although the Massingham estates were not sold until 1807, from this time on Walton Hall became the main seat of the family. Into his 50s, he married 2nd Penelope (abt. 1673 - ?), daughter of Sir George Warburton, nearly 30 years his junior, at St. James, Westminster, on 8th June 1695.\n\nAn account of his life is given in the History of Parliament Online website.\n\nSir Charles Mordaunt 6th Bart. (1698 - 1778). A biography of his parliamentary career is printed in the History of Parliament Online website. He married 1st. Dorothy Conyers (? - 1726) at St. Mary's, Walthamstowe, Essex, on 1st December 1720, by whom he had two daughters\n\nPenelope Mordaunt, who died unmarried\n\nDorothy Mordaunt (? - after 1801) who died unmarried\n\nHe married 2nd. Sophia Woodhouse (? - April 1738) at St. Mary's, Marylebone, London, on 7th July 1730. Their children may not be listed in birth order.\n\nSophia Mordaunt who died unmarried.\n\nSir John Mordaunt 7th Bart (14th May 1734 - 1806) was christened on 1st June 1734 in Westminster. He married Elizabeth Prowse. A brief account of his career as Member of Parliament for Warwickshire is given in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790-1820, ed. R. Thorne, 1986.\n\nElizabeth Mordaunt (12th July 1769 - 1856?) was baptised at St. James, Westminster, on 16th November 1769. I presume she was the Elizabeth Mordaunt, age given as 86, who was living at 11, Montague Square and whose burial was recorded in St. Marylebone, 17th January, 1856\n\nSir Charles Mordaunt 8th Bart. (15th January 1771 - 1823) was baptised at Westminster on 2nd February 1771. He married Marianne Holbech (1777 - 1842) in Farnborough, Hampshire, on 31st January, 1807.\n\nA deeply personal account of his young life and marriage was given in \"The Mordaunts - An Eighteenth Century Family, Elizabeth Hamilton, pub. Heinemannn, 1965, based on his and Marianne's letters and diaries. A more formal account of his public life is given in the History of Parliament Online website. I am very grateful to Kelly McDonald, conducting her own research, who kindly wrote to me with touching references of Marianne from the diaries of the Rev. Richard Seymour, rector of Kinwarton.\n\nAs a widow, Marianne appeared in the first national census of 1841, living at Avonhurst, an estate just east of Stratford-upon-Avon, which she leased at her own expense. Others there were her daughter Emma and Mary Erskine, presumably a niece, the daughter of her sister-in-law, Mary, (see below), together with seven servants. The house and estate no longer exist. In her Will she left the house and estate to her daughter, Emma, books from her library to her son, John, and minor but equal bequests to her Holbech siblings and her servants.\n\nSir John Mordaunt 9th Bart. (24th August, 1808 - 27th September, 1845). The Devon Family History website records the burial of a Susan Mordaunt, presumably a baby or infant, in Shobrooke, near Crediton in Devon, who had died 5th February, 1830, the daughter of Sir John Morduant (sic) and Countess St Germans. Assuming this was not a bogus claim, this fits very well with the characters of this Sir John, 9th Bart, and the dowager Countess of St Germans, Harriet Elliot (née Pole-Carew), widow of the 1st Earl of St Germans, a village in the east of Cornwall. She was just short of her 40th birthday and had had no children from her marriage. Sir John would have been 21 years old! The sad death of the child probably saved them a lot of social embarrasment.\n\nSir John was recorded in Eaton Place, Westminster in the 1841 census.\n\nBy then he had married Carolyne Sophia Murray (20th July, 1814 - 28th March, 1913), born on the Isle of Man while her father was Bishop of Sodor and Man (He was a son of the Duke of Athol and later became Bishop of Rochester). At the 1851 census, Carolyne was already a widow and her son was the 10th baronet. After the early death of her husband, Carolyne married Gustavus Thomas Smith (1800? - 1875) and bore him two daughters. However, it seems that being Mrs Smith did not suit this granddaughter of an Earl and she continued to be called Lady Mordaunt until her death. I have not found them in an 1861 census but it was as Caroline Mordaunt that she was listed in the 1871 census. She was widowed again by the 1881 census when she was living in Eaton Square, Knightsbridge. She had moved to Warwick Square for the 1891 census, and hadn't been so insistent in her title being recorded. Living with her was her grandson Eustace. In the 1901 census she was listed as Dowager Lady Mordaunt. In the 1911 census, she was listed with her grandson, Harry, the future 12th baronet. Her servants are reminiscent of the TV series, Downton Abbey with a 64 year-old butler, a 70 year-old housekeeper, a 70 year-old lady's maid and a 59 year-old housemaid.\n\nCarolyne Sophia, Lady Mordaunt, the young bride, circa 1830s\n\nKindly sent to me in June 2021 by a correspondent, Jim Symington, who had recently acquired it. He also kindly provided additional information for the site.\n\nSir Charles Mordaunt 10th Bart. (1836 - 1897). He was caught by the 1851 census as a 14 year old pupil at Eton. Curiously, in the 1861 census, he is listed with his brothers John and Osbert staying in Walton Village in the house of his steward, together with his butler, cook and housemaid. Perhaps he was having to rough it while Walton Hall was being redecorated. He married 1st. Harriet Sarah Moncrieffe (1848 - 1906), the daughter of a Scottish baronet in Perth on 6th December 1866. During the celebrated divorce case her, or her family's, defence was that she was insane. She was recorded in the 1871 census at what an article in Wikipedia refers to as an asylum. It was quite a small and select one. After the final decision in the divorce case in 1875 she seems to disappear from the public record until her death in 1906. She was buried in Brompton cemetery.\n\nViolet Caroline Mordaunt (1869 - 1928). Some Internet sources offer a variety of alternative natural fathers and, although he apparently made comfortable provision for her maintenance, Sir Charles apparently took no direct interest in her. I have not found her mentioned in the 1871 census but in the 1881 census she was listed, aged 12 years, with a solicitor, Charles M. Hole, and his family in Tiverton, Devon. What, if any, relationship they were to her I have not found out. She married Thomas Henry Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath (1862 - 1946) in 1890. Neither her mother nor father were at the wedding. The Marquesses of Bath seem to go in for unconventional brides.\n\nAlice Kathleen Violet Thynne (1891 - 1977)\n\nEmma Margery Thynne (1893 - ?)\n\nJohn Alexander Thynne (1895 - 1916).\n\nMary Beatrice Thynne (1903 - 1974)\n\nHenry Frederick Thynne (1905 - 1992) 6th Marquess of Bath\n\nCharles married 2nd. parson's daughter, Mary Louise Cholmondeley (abt. 1852 - 1947) on 24th April, 1878. One source I followed stated she was 16 years-old at the time of her marriage. I am grateful to a correspondent, Chris Cowell, for pointing out the wealth of alternative sources giving her year of birth as around 1851/52. Anyway, the new family were esconced in Walton Hall for the 1881 census. At the 1891 census their youngest daughter, Winifred, was one month old and the older children had been dispatched off to Llandudno. By the 1901 census Mary was a widow at Walton Hall with her six children. She was at home with her Baronet son, Osmond, at the 1921 census.\n\nAdela Mordaunt (1879 - ?) She and her younger siblings were all recorded in the 1891 census boarding in Llandudno, along with supporting nurses and servants. Perhaps they were sent away during their mother's latest confinement. At home in 1901, she was a visitor at the Perry household near Kenilworth at the 1911 census.\n\nIrene Mordaunt (abt. 1881 - 1969). She married Sir Robert Caradoc Hamilton, bart, in 1907. Curiously, her father bequeathed the family's principal seat and estate, Walton Hall, to her eldest son, Richard.\n\nLillian Mordaunt (1882 - ?). She married Mildmay Francis Hall in 1904.\n\nSir Osbert L'Estrange Mordaunt 11th Bart. (1884 - 1934). Curiously, he did not inherit the family's principal seat and estate of Walton Hall along with the title. His father bequeathed it to his sister Irene's eldest son, Sir Richard Hamilton. So, after being in the family for over 400 years and being the family's principal home for 250 years, it was lost to the name Mordaunt. Briefly owned by famous drag artist, Danny La Rue, it is now a hotel. I am not sure which is the greater ignomy.\n\nCicely Mordaunt (1889 - ?)\n\nWinifred Mordaunt (1891 - ?) sees to have been having a seaside holiday in Folkeston at the 1921 census. She married John Geare in 1923. Was she the Miss W Mordaunt who serve in WW1 as a driver in the First Aid Yeomanry Nursing Motor Ambulance Convoy?\n\nJacqueline Geare (1924 - 1997)\n\nGillian Geare (b. 1925)\n\nCarolyne Sophia, Lady Mordaunt,\n\nthe older widow\n\nSir Charles\n\nMordaunt, 10th Bart.\n\nHarriet Sarah,\n\nLady Mordaunt\n\nJohn Murray\n\nMordaunt\n\nMiss Mordaunt\n\n(Mary Augusta?)\n\nPhotographs generously provided by a correspondent, Paul Frecker, from his personal collection\n\nJohn Murray Mordaunt (1837 - 1923), educated at Eton and Oxford, married Elizabeth Evelyn Cotes (27th January 1845 - 1914) of Woodcote in 1866. He was the first of the Mordaunts to play \"first class\" cricket - two matches for the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club).\n\nAmong any other of his activities, in 1876, in partnership with Thomas Oswald, he briefly went into shipbuilding and in a relatively brief time the company built a number of ships of note which can be researched by typing Oswald Mordaunt & Company into any Internet search engine. (Wikipedia, for some reason, calls him John Henry Mordaunt). It was presumably this activity that took him and his family to Bitterne, near Southampton, to live before the 1881 census and then to Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, in time for the 1891 census. He had given it all up by the 1901 census when he was recorded as an insurance broker living in Ecclestone Square, Victoria, not far from son Gerald, with Mabel, Eustace and Gertude still at home. He was not at home the night of the 1911 census but lodging or boarding in Usk, in what was then Monmouthshire. The name was deleted from the page and he was given his own page, for some reason. He was home for the 1921 census.\n\nSketch made in 1858 on a journey on the Nile, courtesy of John Bowen who kindly contacted my Guestbook. John's mother was housekeeper to Sir Henry Mordaunt, 12th Bart. from about 1915\n\nThe undertakers's bill for Evelyn's funeral includes details for cashmere frilling and cashmere robe, outer case of panelled French polished etc., hearse and pair of horses also bearers removing to Newport Station, carriage of the body to Paddington, including attendance, all for £20 18s., no small sum (with thanks to John Bowen)\n\nSir Henry John Mordaunt, 12th Bart. (1867 - 1939) died unmarried. He had been born at 12 Grosvenor Street, London, according to the 1901 census, At 3 years-old, he had been left with his grandparents Cotes in Shropshire, with his sister Mabel and brother Eustace at the time of the 1871 census. At the 1881 census he was at Eton, aged 13 years. He became an inspector for the Board of Education and was perhaps on official duty when caught at the 1901 census staying in some comfort in Goodrich, Herefordshire. At the 1911 census he was staying with his grandmother, Caroline Sophia in Warwick Square, working as an education officer for the Grosvenor Hospital. He was at home with his father at the 1921 census. He was another of the cricketing Mordaunts\n\nPicures left: Henry John Mordaunt as a young man in a team photo captioned, \"Atheneum v. 1. 2. Cambridge 1887,\" and as an older man with his housekeeper, Mrs Bowen. I am grateful to Mrs Bowen's son, John, who kindly contacted my Guestbook and provided much interesting information and these photographs.\n\nMabel Louisa Mordaunt (1869 - 1958 ) was first listed in a census in 1871 , staying with her maternal grandparents. She had been baptised on 4th April, 1869 . She married Rupert Palmer Colomb in 1904.\n\nEustace Charles Mordaunt (1870 - 1938) was first listed in a census in 1871 , staying with his maternal grandparents. In the 1881 census he was boarding at a small prep school near Lymington, on the Hampshire coast. In the 1891 census he was working as a clerk on the Stock Exchange and living with his grandmother in Warwick Square. He married Cicely Marian Tubb (? - 1974) of Bicester in 1906. I have not found him in the 1901 census but he and his new family were recorded in Montague Square in the 1911 census by which time he had advanced to being a dealer in stocks and shares. He was another of the cricketing Mordaunts\n\nSir Nigel John Mordaunt, 13th Bart (1907 - 1979) married Anne Tritton in the Westminster district in 1938\n\nRichard Nigel Mordaunt, 14th Bart (b. 1940), having moved to Australia, perhaps wisely eschews use of his title. Since 1965 he has been a film-maker, a story teller of our times, producing successful films first in the UK and then in Australia. He married 1. Myriam Atchia and they have two children\n\nMichele A. Mordaunt (b. 1965), Her husband is Christopher and they have three children, Rhian, Liam and Tia.\n\nA son (b. 1966)\n\nRichard married 2. Diana Barbara (who has a daughter, Saskia), in 1975 and they emigrated to Australia in 1979. I am grateful to Richard for writing to me, correcting errors and adding information.

During WWII he was with the RAF and was shot-down over Germany. He was held as a POW at Stalag Luft III, the location of the escape fictionalised into the film The Great Escape. Fortunately, he was still waiting in line to go into the escape tunnel when the guards found the exit outside the wire. As you know, most POWs who escaped were executed by the SS.\n\nMr.Mordaunt was a great teacher and held an MA (Oxon). The school was Nelson College in Nelson, NZ.\n\nGertrude Catherine Mordaunt (abt. 1875 - ?). She was still living with her parents in the 1901 census and 1911 census but married (later Lt. Gen.) Leonard Thales Pease (later C.B.) later in 1911.\n\nMary Augusta Mordaunt (1839 - 1924). She was baptized in Alton chapel 0n 13th August, 1839. She was listed in the 1871 census with her mother and stepfather in Alderminster, Worcestershire. She married the Rev. Humphrey Farren Hall, Rector of Pylle (? - 1910) in 1879\n\nOsbert Mordaunt (1842 - 1923). Like many younger sons he took holy orders and by the 1871 census was vicar of St. Michael's, Handsworth, Staffs. By the 1881 census he had become Rector of Hampton Lucy in Warwickshire, probably a living in the gift of his elder brother, but at the census was back in Handsworth perhaps staying with a former parishioner, Henry Pattison and his family. He was listed back in his parish at the 1911 census and in the 1901 census. Like his elder brother John, he played some \"first class\" cricket and it was through that, possibly, that he met his wife Jessie Louisa Snow (? - 1933) from Bibury, Glos, whom he married in Hampton Lucy on 14th October, 1879. A book of \"8 Instructions and 3 sermons\" was published in 1882.\n\nHe achieved world wide celebrity as the owner of the \"parson's public house\", his death being reported even as far away as the Ogden Standard Advertiser, Utah, (far right column)\n\nMore entertaining was the reason for his resignation. Disgusted with the loose morals of the country set, he stopped a communion service rather than be faced with the embarrassment of refusing communion to local gentry whom he knew to be adulturous. Read all about it in, of all places, The San Antonio Light.\n\nDespite this report, he was still at Hampton Lucy at the 1911 census.\n\nCaroline C. Mordaunt (1881 - 1918). She married Roderick Pryor in Hampton Lucy on 11th September 1906\n\nBridget Mordaunt (1883 - 1958). She was living at home for the 1911 census, listed almost as an afterthought after the five family servants. In the 1921 census she was a visiter at a house with a 21 year-old lady with her own servant. I have not been able to find a family link.\n\nDavid Osbert Mordaunt (1892 - 1894). He was baptized by his father in Hampton Lucy on 24th July 1892.\n\nAlice Mordaunt (1844 - ?). She married the Rev. Hon. Walter Berkeley Portman (1836 - 1903) in 1864.\n\nAlan Berkeley Portman (1872 - 1953)\n\nLionel Portman (1873 / 1940)\n\nFrancis John Portman (1878 - 1905)\n\nLionel Portman (1873 / 1940)\n\nHenry Mordaunt (1845 - 1853)\n\nMary Mordaunt (? -1851), who was christened at Wellesbourne, Warwickshire, on 3rd November 1811. Her marriage to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 11th Bart., was recorded at Wellesbourne, Warwickshire on 14th April, 1841.\n\nEmma Mordaunt (b. abt. 1813 from the 1871 census), who was christened at Wellesbourne, Warwickshire, on 3rd January 1813. From Jane Austen and the like, we all have an image of young ladies being taught to play the piano and being expected to entertain the family and guests. I am grateful to a correspondent, Penelope Cave, who not only wrote to correct an error on this page, but to tell me of a volume of piano arrangements of Haydn symphonies inscribed with the name of Emma Mordaunt she had come across while doing research in the library of Tatton Park (home of the Egerton family, Earls of Ellesmere, though what they had to do with the Mordaunts I am not sure). As the one unnmarried daughter at her mother's death she was the main beneficiary of her mother's Will, inheriting the lease of the house and estate of Avonhurst, near Stratford-upon-Avon, where her mother lived after her son's marriage. Several family trees on the Public Member Trees page of www.ancestry.co.uk note that she married William Shairp, a major in the Royal Marines and that they had five sons who all served in the forces and a daughter. However, I have found no documentary corroboration for this and it was as Emma Mordaunt that she was listed in the 1871 census (it omits to give her marital staus), living on her own comfortably with four servants in Christchurch, then Hampshire and now Dorset.\n\nSophia Mordaunt (17th December 1771 - 1846?) was baptised at Westminster on 6th January 1772. I presume she was the Sophia Mordaunt, age given as 74, who was living at 4, Upper Wimpole Street and whose burial was recorded in St. Marylebone, 28th February 1846\n\nMary Mordaunt (24th February 1773 - 17th July 1821) was baptised at St. James, Westminster, on 10th March 1773. Her marriage, performed by her brother, John, to John Erskine was recorded at Wellesbourne, Warwickshire on 6th November, 1802. He was to become Comptroller of Army Accounts.\n\nJohn Mordaunt (4th June 1774 - 1806) was baptised at Westminster on 25th June 1774. Like his uncle and many another younger son of a titled family of the time, he took Holy Orders and was Rector of Wickham, Buckinghamshire. He performed the wedding ceremony for his sister, Mary.\n\nCatherine Mordaunt (? - 7th May 1852). She married Rev. Francis Mills of Pillerton, Rector of Barford,on 26th October 1811\n\nCharlotte Mordaunt (23rd December 1777 - May 1848) was baptised at St. James, Westminster, on 15th January 1778. Her marriage to Richard Hippisley was recorded at Wellesbourne, Warwickshire on 15th April 1800.\n\nSusanna Mordaunt (15th December 1779 - 5th February 1830) was baptised at Westminster on 5th January 1780. Her marriage to William Eliot, 2nd Earl of St. Germans (his 4th marriage), was recorded at Wellesbourne, Warwickshire on 30th August, 1814.\n\nCharles Mordaunt (26th February 1736 - January 1820). He was baptised at St. Anne, Soho, on 25th March, 1736. He took Holy Orders and was granted the living of both St Andrew's, Ryburgh Magna, and All Saints, Ryburgh Parva, in 1760 and then of Little Massingham. He married Charlotte Musgrave (1752 - 1816), daughter of Sir Philip Musgrave, Bart. at St. Mary's, Marylebone, London, on 24th May 1774. They retired to Sunbury on Thames and were both buried there at the church of St. Mary, Charlotte on 28th October, 1816, and Charles on 29th January, 1820. They had at least two children, in which order I do not know:\n\nCharlotte Mordaunt. I had not found her in any source until I was contacted by David Barry Gee in early 2012 who had found this site doing research into his own family. I am very grateful to him for contacting me. She did not marry and, after the deaths of her parents apparently went to live with an aunt, her mother's sister, and after her aunt's death she moved to her aunt's granddaughter, Matilda Charlotte Houston, a writer and diarist who penned an affectionate portrait of her.\n\nCharles Mordaunt was apparently the last Mordaunt born and baptised at Massingham. From him descend the Mordaunts of Somerset.\n\nCharlotte Mordaunt née Musgrave by or after Sir Joshua Reynolds, National Portrait Gallery\n\nMary Mordaunt who died unmarried\n\nDiana Mordaunt (1st November 1701 - ?) was christened in Westminster on 19th November 1701. I have not seen her mentioned in any other source so perhaps she did not survive long.\n\nPenelope (Pen) Mordaunt who married a Joseph Heme, Esq.\n\nCatherine Mordaunt who married Dr. Dobson, Warden of Winchester College.\n\nJohn Mordaunt\n\nIn 1715, magistrates judged that Sir John Mordaunt, baronet, was the father of a bastard child, John, born on 17th December 1714, to a single woman, Mary Stanton. The baby died shortly after. Sir John was ordered to pay the costs (£5.18s.) arising to the parish of St James, Clerkenwell for the sum expended on necessary support and relief of Mary Stanton in her lying in and for the cost of christening and burial of the child and other incidental charges\n\nElizabeth Mordaunt (1646 - ?) was baptised at Fakenham Magna, Suffolk, on 18th December 1646. She, apparently, died unmarried\n\nAmy Mordaunt (abt. 1650/53 - ?) seems to have died young\n\nRobert Mordaunt \"of Hesperton\" in Warwickshire, married Elizabeth Rouse, like his grandmother, from Utrecht\n\nElizabeth Mordaunt who married Robert Throckmorton of Hasely in Warwickshire.\n\nJohn Lewis Mordaunt (? - 1724) who married a widow, Anna Maria Terril (? - 1689?), daughter of Thomas Harrington of Boothby (Lincolnshire?) on 8th July 1686 at St. Luke, Chelsea.\n\nJohn Mordaunt seems to have died young\n\nElizabeth Mordaunt seems to have died young\n\nThe Will of Sir John Mordaunt, Bart., written in 1714, would, if none of his own family survived, have left all the family estates to John Lewis. John Lewis's own Will dated 1719/20 makes no mention of his sister, any children of his sister, his wife or any children of his own. He made bequests to his cousins Anne and Katherine Mordaunt, presumably the daughters of his uncle William (below), a cousin Elizabeth Swain, widow, whom I have not identified and, after bequests to his landlady, Anne Browne, and her family in St Anne's Parish, Holborn, left the rest of his estate to Charles Mordaunt, son of Sir John, Bart.\n\nJohn Lewis was buried at St George the Martyr, Queen Square, Middlesex, on 16th June, 1724, arranged on his behalf by his landlady, the \"Widow Brown.\"\n\nWilliam Mordaunt (abt 1631? - 1707) married Anne Butler of Scovis Town (var. Scovistown, Scavington, Scovaston and Scoveston), Pembrokshire, on 22nd July 1656 at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. In 1661 they were enjoying the Butler estate of Hilton in Pembrokeshire before moving to the main Butler residence, Scoveston. Among anything else, he achieved office in Wales in the \"Court of the Marches of Wales\" and as \"officer of receiving answers, replications, rejoiners etc.\" whatever they may have been; perhaps they were the same appointment (Calender of State Papers Domestic, Charles II, December 1662).\n\nHe seems to have invested in an estate of 607 acres in Pennsylvania which his children later disposed of:\n\n\"John Evans of Denbigh, in the Co. of Denbigh, Great Britain, Esqr. to Thomas James, recites transfers from William Penn, October 24 and 25, 1681, to William Mordent (alias Mordaunt) of Lansterwell in the county of Pembroke, Esq., for 500 acres of land in Pennsylvania, and deed from Thomas and Osmond Mordent, sons of the said William, dated February 29, 1711, unto the afore-said John Evans (under the name of John Evans late of Pensilvania but now of London, Esqr) and the said John Evans did grant said land to John Moore, March 5, 17  .\" (Philadelphia Deeds, Liber F, No. 3, folio 243.)\n\nAnd from the website of the Great Valley House of Valley Forge Bed and Breakfast website:\n\nWilliam Penn received the royal charter for Pennsylvania from Charles II, in 1681. William Penn granted land to John ap John, the chief disciple of Quakerism in Wales. This tract of land was part of the original Welsh Tract that covered most of what is known today as the Main Line of Philadelphia.\n\nWilliam Penn deeded to William Mordaunt, on 10/24/1681, a tract of 607 acres in Philadelphia, William Mordaunt later died leaving as heir Thomas Mordaunt.\n\nDuring the period of time from 1681 to the 1700s there were many squatters and informal leases in the area. The original construction of the Great Valley House began prior to 1700 by undocumented tenants. This conclusion is based on the architectural feature of the stone sink built as part of the stone wall in the Old Kitchen. Sinks of this nature were typical of Welsh construction prior to the advent of the Dry Sink in the late 1600's\n\nThomas Mordaunt and Osmond Mordaunt by deed dated 1/28/1711 conveyed the land to John Evans. John Evans, by deed dated 3/5/1716 in Philadelphia, conveyed the property to John Moore.\n\nOn quite a different issue, British History Online has an extract from the Calender of State Papers Domestic: William and Mary, for 18th April, 1689, from Scovestown:\n\nWilliam Mordaunt to the Earl of Shrewsbury. In obedience to your instructions, I have committed two Irish papists, common soldiers, named Richard Brown and John Park. I have also secured one Alexander Fitzgerald, son of David Fitzgerald of Limerick, a papist but who does not own to have been a soldier, having received orders for securing Irish mariners and soldiers, but Mr. Fitzgerald being neither, I have confined him in my own house. I desire to know what to do with him. [S.P. Dom. Will & Mary 1, No. 27.]\n\nWilliam's children were sensitive to their reliance on the goodwill of their wealthy cousin the baronet and so wrote regular letters, which may be found in Warwickshire County Archives, wishing him good health and recounting their exploits.\n\nCole Mordaunt (? - 1708). Cole is quite an unusual name in the Mordaunt family and so I make the assumption for the moment that all references to a Cole in this period are to this son.\n\nA Cole Mordaunt is listed among those taking their oath of allegiance to William and Mary, in 1696 in Easingwold, Yorkshire and later to Queen Anne on 14th July 1702 at Hemsley in Yorkshire, where he received £80 a year as an officer for surveying and inspecting the Duties on Houses and on Marriages.\n\nHe is later found at sea, in the War of the Spanish Succession. His distant relation, Charles, 3rd Earl of Peterborough, had distinguished himself with the capture of Barcelona and Valencia. Charles had quit Barcelona and it soon came under seige. Cole, and his younger brother Butler, were among the forces that relieved the siege of Barcelona in May 1706.\n\nI have not found any record of him marrying. His Will, written in 1708, after referring to him inheriting his father's \"estate in Wales,\" leaves everything to his brothers and sisters. At the time, he was a captain in Colonel Lillingston's Regiment at Batchelor Thorne, Devon. It is an interesting coincidence that in the same vicinity of Devon there was already a Mordaunt family commonly using the names of the brothers, Osmond, Thomas and Cole. (See \"The Mordaunt family in the rest of Britain\" page)\n\nThomas Mordaunt (? - after 1723?) had joined the Navy several years earlier, while his elder brother was still collecting taxes in York but, according to his letters, seemed never to leave port or English coastal waters, and he left in 1701, ostensibly because of the illness of his father, William (who recovered to live another 6 years). A history of Hilton Court in Pembrokeshire, no longer on the Internet, stated in passing that Thomas was the sole surviving son in 1723.\n\nButler Mordaunt (? - 1721). This brother too joined the navy and was on ship by 1699. In February 1706 he was a midshipman on HMS Royal Ann in Portsmouth harbour and in May the same year was taking part in the relief of Barcelona, meeting up with his brother Cole. In September he was present at the capture of Mallorca.\n\nHe married Elisabeth Clinton at St. Benet, Pauls Wharf, London, on 1st December, 1715. His Will, dated 1716 and apparently unaltered by his death in 1721 left all his estate, however much that was, to his wife, Elizabeth, with no mention of any children or surviving brothers/sisters or any children of theirs.\n\nOsmond Mordaunt (? - before 1723?). Osmond was sent to Rugby School and registered 23rd, June 1697, according to the school register. It does not say how long he stayed. Osmond did not go to sea but to London instead. He too dutifully wrote letters to his wealthy cousin and told him about the weather in London. The correspondence can be seen in Warwickshire County Archives.\n\nMary Mordaunt\n\n, the daughter of a William and Anne Mordaunt was baptised on 26th March, 1661, at St.George, Mayfair (ancestry.co.uk - England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538 - 1975) . She is the only one I have been able to date, but which order the daughters came I do not know. I have not found her mentioned in any other source.\n\nAnne Mordaunt. She was to receive £40 from her brother Cole's will dated 1706\n\nKatherine Mordaunt is a sister mentioned in the will of Cole Mordaunt, dated 1706, when he left her the residue of his chattels after the bequest to Anne, including his linen sheets, table cloths, towels, plate and gold watch. Such household items frequently occur in wills if this period and were clearly considered of greater value than we think of these days. Virtually the only records on ancestry.co.uk for William's family in Pembrokeshire are, regretably, from the burials at Steynton church, which would have been the parish church for Scoveston Manor. A total of seven burials, six presumably children, are listed with the father named as William. The entries do not give ages but the dates of burial do give a bracket as to when William and Anne's children were born. So, in order of entry in the parish record:\n\nAmy Mordaunt was buried 13th June, 1663.\n\n(illegible) Mordaunt was buried 28th January, 1664.\n\n(illegible) Mordaunt was buried 7th January, 1668.\n\nWilliam Mordaunt was buried 17th April, 1668.\n\nRowland Mordaunt was buried 25th Mach, 1671.\n\nJohn Mordaunt was buried 3rd August, 1676.\n\nRobert(?) Mordaunt is described as an adult. He was buried 30th December(?), 1702\n\nAmy Mordaunt (1621? - ?) married Sir Giles Estcourt (? - 1688), 1st Bart. of Newton\n\nAnne Mordaunt (1623? - July 1655) married Christopher(?) Pickering\n\nHenry Mordaunt (of Congham in Norfolk), second son of L'Estrange, the first baronet. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 12th November, 1614, and called to the Bar 23rd November, 1621. He married Barbara Calthorp (? - Christmas Day 1690) of Cockthorp, Norfolk. She was buried in the church of St Andrew, Congham.\n\nL'Estrange Mordaunt (abt. 1628 - 1691) who married Barbara Catelyn (abt. 1642 - 1729) of Kirby-Cane in Norfolk. Both were buried in Congham church\n\nHenry Mordaunt (abt. 1682 - ?) of Congham in Norfolk. He was admitted to St. John's College, Cambridge, 18th May, 1699, aged 17 years. His date of birth and status could match the Henry Mordaunt, living in Salisbury Court near Fleet Street, listed on the Mordaunts of London webpage under \"Unplaced Mordaunts\"\n\nBarbara Mordaunt (abt 1677 - 1714), who married Captain John Brown of Scarning in Norfolk and is buried in Scarning church.\n\nJane Mordaunt married Sir James Reynolds of Bumpstede, Essex at Little Massingham in June 1620\n\nAnne Mordaunt (1596 - 16th October 1631) married Thomas Cleere (1580 - 1621) of Pontney, Norfolk at Bumpsted Helion, Essex, on 28th November 1620. She is buried in Grimston, Norfolk, curiously not with her husband. (With thanks to a Bradley family webpage for additional information)\n\nAs yet, unplaced Mordaunts\n\nCharles Mordaunt, of the Middle Temple, by his 1681 Will, left money to brothers John Mordaunt, undergoing an apprenticeship at the time, Henry Mordaunt and a married sister whose name I cannot, with confidence, decipher. One of the beneficiaries and one of the executors was Sir John Mordaunt Bart., although what the family connection was I have no idea.\n\nSir(?) or even Lord, Philip Mordaunt, aged about 27 years-old, shot himself in the head, so many believed. This was clearly a well known event in its time, being refered to by Voltaire (enter Philip Mordaunt in the Search), 1733, Oliver Goldsmith, pre-1776, Immanuel Kant , who in his Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View (1798) mentions a \"Lord Mordaunt\" of whom it was said in Paris that he hanged (sic?) himself out of boredom: \"The luxurious person has experimented with pleasures of every kind,and no pleasure is new to him any longer; just as people in Paris said of Lord Mordaunt: \"The English hang themselves in order to while their time away,\" a 1822 publication The Youth's Instructor and Guardian\" and a 1835 medical textbook on diseases of the mind written in Pennsylvania.\n\nDescribed by Voltaire as a cousin-german (today we would say first cousin) to Charles, the 3rd Earl of Peterborough, this places him in time anywhere from 1670 - 1740 but Earl Charles did not have any male Mordaunt cousins. I have been unable to place him in any family tree.\n\nIn this post-President Trump era, I can look upon Sir Philip as \"fake news\" and, like modern fake news, it seems it went the 18th century equivalent of \"viral.\" I do really hope, one day, to discover the origin of the story.\n\nI am grateful to Dr. Anne Delouis, associate professor at the University of Orleans, who kindly wrote with additional information on two of the above references to Sir Philip Mordaunt in February 2021, which I have been able to add.\n\nOsmond Mordaunt and his wife Barbara informed on the beneficiaries of a bequest as recorded on 2nd November 1743 and were able to take half of the money for themselves:\n\n\"A petition read from Osmond Mordaunt and Barbara, his wife, informing of two legacies, left to a frier and a nun, viz.: to Merry and Penelope Simpson, children of Frances Simpson, of St. Andrews, Holborn, which they look upon as superstitious bequests and forfeited, one moiety to the Crown, the other to the informer. Referred to the Attorney General.\" ( From: 'Treasury Books and Papers: November 1743', Calendar of Treasury Books and Papers, Volume 5: 1742-1745 (1903), pp. 326-333. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk)\n\nCharlotte Mordaunt (abt. 1771 - ?) and\n\nSohia Mordaunt (abt. 1776 - ?) were resident/staying in Bryanstone Square, Marylebone at the 1841 census. Their apparent wealth, with seven servants, suggests they were the sisters of the 8th Baronet above but I cannot say with certainty from Internet material alone.\n\nCharlotte Mordaunt (abt. 1776 - ?) was resident/staying at Warwick Terrace, Clarendon Crescent, Leamington Priors, (now Royal Leamington Spa) at the 1841 census. She may have been a member of this family or she may not have been.\n\nJump to: Top of Page"
