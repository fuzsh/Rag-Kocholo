        "text": "Ms Mordaunt had been hoping supporters of the ex-prime minister would come over to her campaign to help keep Mr Sunak out of Downing Street.\n\nInstead the withdrawal of the ex-prime minister from the race on Sunday night prompted a steady flow of his allies to her rival’s camp.\n\nJames Duddridge, a former parliamentary private secretary to Mr Johnson and one of the leading lights of his bid to return to No 10, backed Mr Sunak.\n\n'Get the economy back on track'\n\n“We must unite the parliamentary party and get the economy back on track. Rishi is best placed to do this,” he said.\n\nNadhim Zahawi, the Cabinet Office minister, announced he was switching moments after the former prime minister pulled out.\n\nJames Cleverly, the Foreign Secretary and another key Johnson loyalist, revealed on Monday morning that he was now backing Mr Sunak.\n\n“We face great challenges at home and abroad. I said we needed experience at the top of Government and I stand by that,” he said.\n\n“The candidate with the most experience is clearly Rishi Sunak. He can count on my full support as our PM and I will be voting for him.”\n\n'All to play for'\n\nSenior backbenchers Shailesh Vara and David Morris also switched as the former chancellor’s campaign raced to 160 declared backers.\n\nIn contrast, Ms Mordaunt, whose bid for No 10 made a slow start, had still only attracted 26 MPs who are openly supporting her.\n\nHer allies insisted that she will hit the 100 mark required to make the ballot by 2pm on Monday, when nominations for the race close.\n\nDamian Collins, one of her supporters, said “a lot of people” had “instantly” privately switched their allegiance from Mr Johnson to her.\n\n“So I think it is all to play for today in terms of whether Penny can get the 100 votes she needs to make sure there is a members ballot,” he told Times Radio.\n\nAndrea Leadsom, a former Cabinet minister and key cog in Ms Mordaunt’s campaign, said she also believed her candidate would make the cut.\n\nAsked if the Commons Leader has the numbers, Ms Leadsom told Sky News: \"I am absolutely confident, yes, and I will be getting an update on that very soon.\"\n\n'Praying we choose wisely'\n\nJeremy Hunt, one of the biggest names to have held back on declaring his support, also rowed in behind Mr Sunak on Sunday night.\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, the Chancellor said: \"Acting in the national interest, even when unpopular, is why people support the Conservatives and the only way for us to earn back the trust we have squandered in recent months.\n\n\"With Rishi Sunak, we have someone who, in our best traditions, will turn the page on what went wrong, take decisions in the national interest and rebuild the extraordinary potential of our economy.\n\n\"Voters of all parties knows this perfectly well. They are hoping and praying we choose wisely. We must not let them down.\"\n\nSimon Clarke, the Levelling Up Secretary, became the latest Cabinet minister who had backed Mr Johnson's campaign to break for Mr Sunak on Monday morning.\n\n\"Today the Conservatives need to unite. Really extremely serious events are unfolding and our country needs leadership,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"Rishi Sunak is the right person to assume the immense responsibility of being Prime Minister and he will have my full support.\""
