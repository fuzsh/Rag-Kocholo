She was the Head of Youth for the party under John Major and went on to become the Tory Head of Broadcasting under William Hague.\n\nMs Mordaunt first ran for parliament in her hometown of Portsmouth in 2005 but lost to Labour’s Sarah McCarthy-Fry.\n\nShe stood again in 2010 and won the seat of Portsmouth North with a majority of more than 7,000 votes.\n\nShe achieved ministerial rank under David Cameron in 2014 and 2016 and was appointed as Minister of State for Disabled People, Work and Health when Theresa May took power in 2016.\n\nIn 2019, she became the first female Secretary of State for Defence – but was demoted under Boris Johnson’s leadership.\n\nIn 2020, she became the Paymaster General, and in 2021 was instead appointed as Minister of State at the Department for International Trade.\n\nShe was one of the candidates during the Conservative leadership race back in summer 2022 but was eliminated in the fifth round.\n\nFollowing Liz Truss’s victory on September 6, Ms Mordaunt was appointed as Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council.\n\nShe kept her positions following Ms Truss’s brief time as PM once Rishi Sunak took the reins.\n\nWhat does the Leader of the House of Commons do?\n\nThe Leader of the House of Commons is a cabinet member within the ruling party in UK government.\n\nTheir main role is to organise government business within the House of Commons.\n\nMs Mordaunt is responsible for organising debates and discussion of bills, while also providing time for backbench business to be discussed.\n\nShe must plan and supervise the government’s legislative programme, chair the cabinet committee on parliamentary business and legislation, and preparing weekly schedules for Commons business.\n\nWho are Penny Mordaunt’s parents?\n\nHer father, John Mordaunt, was a former paratrooper, while her mother, Jennifer, was a special needs teacher at several Purbrook schools.\n\nThrough her mother, Ms Mordaunt is related to Philip Snowden, who was the first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nActress Dame Angela Lansbury is her grandmother’s cousin, meaning she is also distantly related to former Labour Party leader George Lansbury.\n\nJohn, born at Hilsea Barracks, served in the Parachute Regiment. He went on to train as a teacher and later became a youth worker for Hampshire County Council. Ms Mordaunt has said she was named after HMS Penelope.\n\nHer mother died of cancer when she was 15-years-old, and her father was diagnosed with cancer the following year (from which he recovered), leaving Mordaunt as her youngest sibling’s primary caregiver.\n\nIs Penny Mordaunt married?\n\nMs Mordaunt is protective of her private life and it’s not known if she’s currently in a relationship with anyone.\n\nShe had been married to Paul Murray, who she met while reading philosophy at the University of Reading in 1990, as a mature student.\n\nThey married in 1999 but divorced a year later.\n\nAfter this she was in a long-term relationship with classical singer Ian Lyon, with whom she reportedly bred Burmese cats.\n\nHowever the pair split up in 2016, and they didn’t have any children.\n\nWhy was Penny Mordaunt at the coronation?\n\nAs Lord President of the Privy Council, Ms Mordaunt presided over the Accession Ceremony of King Charles III following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nShe’s heavily involved in royal proceedings due to her Privy Council role, and carried the 17th century Sword of State into Westminster Abbey as part of the coronation procession.\n\nShe was also involved in the presentation of the regalia during the investiture and crowning ceremony, where the Jewelled Sword of Offering was blessed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and presented to King Charles by her.\n\nMs Mordaunt is the first woman to serve as Lord President of the Privy Council and was therefore the first woman to perform this duty at a coronation.\n\nWhat time is her debate with Angela Rayner?\n\nThe debate between Penny Mordaunt, Angela Rayner, and representatives from the five other major parties will take place on Friday, June 7 from 7.30pm.\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram\n\nShare your views in the comments below\n\nMORE : Who is Angela Rayner?
