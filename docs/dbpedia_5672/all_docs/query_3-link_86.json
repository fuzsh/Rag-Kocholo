        "text": "Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt has narrowly lost in her Portsmouth North constituency.\n\nTraditionally a bellwether seat, Labour's Amanda Martin has won with 14,495 votes to Ms Mordaunt's 13,715 - an 18% swing.\n\nMs Mordaunt has served as Lord President of the Council since 2022 and as MP for Portsmouth North since 2010.\n\nShe told Ms Martin: \"You are now working for the the best employer ever - the people of Portsmouth are wonderful, hard-working, big-hearted and anything that I ever achieved was made possible by them.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I thank them for the opportunities they have given me.\n\n\"I will never stop caring for these people or this place.\n\n\"In all things I have been guided by them - their common sense, their determination, their hopes, their pride in our city and our nation.\"\n\nWhen the result was announced at Portsmouth Guildhall, there were audible gasps of shock.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Solent, she said: \"I never take any election for granted and we worked our socks off and we've worked our socks off for 14 years, and sometimes the tide is against you. \"\n\nShe wished Ms Martin \"well\" and added she would \"do everything we can to support her\".\n\nIn 2022 both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak asked Ms Mordaunt to serve as Leader of the Commons and Lord President of the Council.\n\nIn this role, she oversaw both the Accession Council following the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the coronation of King Charles III.\n\nThe Tory minister won praise for her stamina, carrying the 17th Century Sword of State and Jewelled Sword of Offering for more than an hour during King's Coronation.\n\nMs Mordaunt is also well remembered for her appearance on reality television programme Splash!, which she said was \"out of her comfort zone\".\n\nShe held roles under Conservative leaders Sir John Major and William Hague, and also worked for George W Bush's presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004.\n\nUnder the coalition government of David Cameron, she served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Decentralisation from 2014 to 2015.\n\nAfter the 2015 general election, she became the first woman to serve as defence secretary.\n\nShe was also the first woman to hold the role of Minister for the Armed Forces that year.\n\nIn 2016 she was named Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, and in 2017 she became the Secretary of State for International Development.\n\nThe 51-year-old has been a Royal Navy reservist since 2009, completed officer training in 2013, and gained honorary commission in 2019.\n\nShe now holds the honorary rank of captain.\n\nThe daughter of a paratrooper and a special needs teacher, Ms Mordaunt has lived in her home city of Portsmouth since the age of two.\n\nShe was educated at Oaklands RC Comprehensive School and was the first member of her family to go to university.\n\nBefore studying philosophy at Reading University, she worked as a magician's assistant for a member of the Portsmouth and District Magic Circle, Will Ayling, author of The Art of Illusion and Oriental Conjuring and Magic."
