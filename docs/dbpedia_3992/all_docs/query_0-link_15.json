In 1933 when he was 11, the family moved to London to escape the growing Nazi threat. He attended Dartington School and then Bryanston before going to the Central School of Art.\n\nHe went on to the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing before becoming a merchant seaman.\n\nLucian Freud was one of the most outstanding artists of his generation"
