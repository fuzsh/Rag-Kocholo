        "text": "It was the end of an era in the art world when Lucian Freud died aged 88 on the 22nd of July. Freud was art’s greatest living painter, he made such an impression on me that I was incredibly sad when he died, even though I never met him. I remember reading about where he hung out in a magazine and wishing I had the courage to go to the Wolseley and ‘bump’ into him.\n\nHe worked obsessively at his studio in London’s Holland Park and fathered many children. He hung out with Kate Moss and when he died, his regular table at the Wolseley was draped in a black cloth. He borrowed money from Jacob Rothschild on the condition that he would never ask again and never pay it back, he also got in trouble with the Krays after racking up gambling debts, and got into a fight when he was in his 80’s.\n\nA memorial service has been set. Freud’s lawyer Diana Rawstron said his funeral would be held in private but a public memorial service would be held at another date.\n\nShe told The Daily Telegraph: ‘The funeral will be private and for the family only. There will be a memorial service at a date to be announced.’\n\nHe was the grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud\n\nFreud’s become incredibly expensive and his Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, that sold in 2008 for $33.6 million – a record for a living artist. The women in the Picture, Sue Tilley, said she cried when she heard he had died.\n\n‘He certainly is considered one of the most important painters of the 20th and 21st centuries,’ added Brett Gorvy, deputy chairman of the postwar art department at Christie’s auction house in New York."
