        "text": "Renowned artist Lucian Freud has died at his home in London.\n\nThe 88-year-old’s solicitor Diana Rawstron confirmed last night he passed away on July 20 and one of his art dealers said his death was caused by illness.\n\nThe son of an architect and grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, Mr Freud was born in Berlin in 1922 and came to Britain when he was ten-years-old.\n\nA realist painter, he studied at the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing in Hadleigh during the 1930s and during his long, illustruous and prolific career he had many famous subjects including Queen Elizabeth II and Kate Moss.\n\nHis daughter Esther Freud - who has written several books including Hideous Kinky – owns a home in the Blyth estuary and was featured on the IP-Art programme of events this year.\n\nShe also appeared at the UEA Literary Festival in May 2010.\n\nNicholas Serota, director of the Tate art gallery, said: “His early paintings redefined British art and his later works stand comparison with the great figurative painters of any period.”\n\nFor more on Lucian Freud’s life pick up the Evening Star tomorrow."
