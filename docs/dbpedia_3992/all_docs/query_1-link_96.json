So here's my kick off choice:\n\nLook at the discussion here To me Lucien's wosk is grotesque in a sympathetic way. It's the antidote to seeing excesses in the opposite direction where faces are electronically optimized and skin smoothed to perfection.

I have always had a scorn for 'la belle peinture' and 'la delicatesse des touches'. I know my idea of portraiture came from dissatisfaction with portraits that resembled people. I would wish my portraits to be of the people, not like them. Not having a look of the sitter, being them. I didn't want to get just a likeness like a mimic, but to portray them, like an actor. As far as I am concerned the paint is the person. I want it to work for me just as flesh does' (Freud, quoted in L. Gowing, Lucian Freud, London, 1982, pp. 190-91).\n\nI feel similar in the sense that photography seems to have fallen for the image - the likeness.\n\nthe unfinished images - the surface - breaking the smooth sheen of paint - using texture to recall in ones mind the feeling of skin - this guy could paint/draw/think.\n\nlucien freud - reflection1\n\nâ€‹"
