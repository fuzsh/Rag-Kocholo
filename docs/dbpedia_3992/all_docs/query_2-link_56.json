        "text": "(JTA) — Lucian Freud, one of Britain’s most noted artists, has died at the age of 88.\n\nFreud, who was a grandson of Sigmund Freud, the pioneering figure of psychoanalysis, died at his London home on Wednesday.\n\nBorn in Berlin in 1922, the future artist fled with his family to England at the age of 10 after Hitler took power in 1933.\n\nA figurative painter, he was famed for his portraits and paintings of nudes.\n\n\"The vitality of (Freud’s) nudes, the intensity of the still life paintings and the presence of his portraits of family and friends guarantee Lucian Freud a unique place in the pantheon of late 20th Century art,\" said Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate Gallery in London. \"His early paintings redefined British art and his later works stand comparison with the great figurative painters of any period.\""
