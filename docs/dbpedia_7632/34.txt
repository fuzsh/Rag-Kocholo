The song “Down Under” was written by Colin Hay and Ron Strykert; it was performed by Men At Work and included on their album “Business as Usual” (1981). It was later released as a single (1982), which became a #1 hit. The popularity of the song was increased with the release of a music video (1983).[1]

The song was very popular, and it became somewhat of an Australian anthem. Although the embedded message may not be obvious, Colin Hay has said that the lyrics and music video included a warning that Australia’s identity was being threatened by over-development and Americanisation.[2]

In a TV interview, Hay said “It wasn’t meant to be particularly a song about waving the flag. It was a lot more of a statement about over-development and the desecration of the country and the loss of spirit for short-term gains and all that kind of stuff. That’s really what the song was about. There was all this kind of symbolism in it, like at the end [of the music video] there was this road-case, which was supposed to symbolise a coffin, which was again supposed to symbolise the death of the country, the death of Australia, because there was something about the end of innocence, or the end of naivety, or something or other, and all of a sudden we’re in the world of real-estate developers and unscrupulous multinationals who are going to, in a sense, destroy the spirit of the country. But it is ultimately a song about celebration though, because it is celebrating this place, because there’s a lot to celebrate about this country, because it truly is an awesome place.”[3]

An early version of “Down Under” had been released in 1980 as a B side to the single “Keypunch Operator”, with the music including what seems to be a Reggae influence. However, the 1980 version was nowhere near as catchy as the 1981 record (although a subjective assessment, it is borne out by the popularity of the version that became a worldwide hit).[4]

In 2009, some 28 years after “Down Under” was released, Larrikin Music sued for copyright infringement, for Men At Work using a background flute riff which was said to be derived from “Kookaburra”, the well-known children’s song written in 1932 by Marion Sinclair (who died in 1988). Although founded by Warren Fahey in 1974, Larrikin Music had been sold to Music Sales Australia in 1988 (and therefore Fahey was not the person who initiated the court action). The judge found in favour of Larrikin Music in this notorious case, awarding to them 5% of all past and present royalties of the “Down Under” song. It should be noted that Larrikin Records (sold by Warren Fahey to Festival Records in 1995) and The Larrikins (a bush band, including Fahey) are not connected to Larrikin Music (sold by Fahey to Music Sales Australia in 1988), even though the three entities share the Larrikin name. In February 2015 Larrikin Music changed its name to Happy As Larry Music.[5]

“Down Under” has been covered by various bands and musicians, and is still popular to this day.
