The song 'Down Under' by Men At Work is an iconic anthem that captures the essence of Australian identity and pride. Released in 1981, it became a global hit, resonating with audiences for its catchy tune and quirky lyrics that celebrate Australian culture. The song is filled with slang and references that might be cryptic to those unfamiliar with the land 'down under,' but for Australians, it's a playful nod to their homeland.

The lyrics tell the story of an Australian traveler encountering various people and experiences while abroad. The phrase 'fried-out Kombi' refers to a broken-down Volkswagen van, a common vehicle for road-tripping hippies. The 'hippie trail' mentioned is a colloquial term for the overland journey taken by members of the hippie subculture from Europe to South Asia in the 1960s and 1970s. The 'head full of zombie' could be interpreted as being in a daze or under the influence, adding to the song's whimsical nature. The encounters with the strange lady, the man in Brussels, and the man in Bombay each highlight different aspects of the traveler's Australian identity, as seen through the eyes of others.

The chorus is particularly evocative, with the question 'Do you come from a land down under?' serving as a recurring motif. The song uses vivid imagery, such as 'women glow and men plunder,' to create a sense of the Australian landscape and character. The thunder mentioned in the chorus could be a metaphor for the looming dangers or challenges one faces while traveling or living in Australia. The advice to 'run, you better take cover' suggests a need for caution and resilience, qualities often associated with the Australian spirit. Overall, 'Down Under' is a celebration of Australian culture, a humorous take on national stereotypes, and a reminder of the unique place Australia holds in the world.
