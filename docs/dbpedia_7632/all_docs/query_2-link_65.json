(oh yeah yeah)\n\nWhere women glow and men plunder?\n\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\n\nYou better run, you better take cover\n\nLiving in a land down under\n\nWhere women glow and men plunder\n\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\n\nYou better run, you better take cover\n\nLiving in a land down under\n\nWhere women glow and men plunder\n\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\n\nYou better run, you better take cover\n\nLiving in a land down under\n\nWhere women glow and men plunder\n\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\n\nYou better run, you better take cover\n\nLiving in a land down under\n\nWhere women glow and men plunder\n\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?"
