        "text": "Down Under\n\nTraveling in a fried-out combie\n\nOn a hippie trail, head full of zombie\n\nI met a strange lady, she made me nervous\n\nShe took me in and gave me breakfast\n\nAnd she said,\n\n\"Do you come from a land down under?\n\nWhere women glow and men plunder?\n\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\n\nYou better run, you better take cover.\"\n\nBuying bread from a man in Brussels\n\nHe was six foot four and full of muscles\n\nI said, \"Do you speak-a my language?\"\n\nHe just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich\n\nAnd he said,\n\n\"I come from a land down under\n\nWhere beer does flow and men chunder\n\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\n\nYou better run, you better take cover.\"\n\nLying in a den in Bombay\n\nWith a slack jaw, and not much to say\n\nI said to the man, \"Are you trying to tempt me\n\nBecause I come from the land of plenty?\"\n\nAnd he said,\n\n\"Oh! Do you come from a land down under? (oh yeah yeah)\n\nWhere women glow and men plunder?\n\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\n\nYou better run, you better take cover.\"\n\nAs has been said this is a paean to Oz (Australia) written from the perspective of an expatriate. Words you may not be familiar with are 'combie' - a combination of vehicle and home, usually an old VW Caravanette; 'vegemite' - the Oz version of Marmite (a yeast extract spread); 'chunder' - chuck, technicolour yawn, liquid laugh, hurl, to play the whale, to cry Ruth, the big spit, laugh at the ground, to yodel, to expel a jet of partially digested nutrient.\n\nFirstly, a minor correction. The 'Combie' isn't 'Combie' but 'Kombi' and is short for Kombinationskraftwagen, which is the type of Volkwagen camper van that many Australians would buy on the cheap and drive across the Hippie Trail.\n\nOther factets that people may be interested in:\n\nThe Hippie Trail referred to was the well trodden route that ran from Northern Europe, through Istanbul, Tehran, Kabul, and down to Delhi, Kathmandu, and, ultimately on to Bangkok.\n\nWhere women glow supposedly refers to the sweat that Australian women suffer from due to the heat in Australia.\n\nMen plundering is a reference to men in Australia plundering the natural resources of the country.\n\nThe term chunder does indeed mean throw-up (puke, etc), but it's also referring to the Australian male tendency to drink to excess, especially when abroad. The song was really a dig at Australians abroad who, in the writer's view, often misbehaved as they wandered the planet, thinking that everyone adored them, when in fact they were often being ridiculous.\n\nThe song was inspired by a Barry Humphries character called Barry McKenzie, nephew to another of Humphries' characters Dame Edna Everage. In that sense it is meant to be satirical, I believe."
