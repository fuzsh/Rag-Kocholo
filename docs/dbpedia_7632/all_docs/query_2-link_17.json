Never really liked \"Down Under\" all that much. It's good, but not great.\n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that both of these songs were #1 songs back to back, so you can add this to the Funny Chart Coincidences if someone hasn't.\n\nkcdawg13\n\n7x Platinum Member\n\nYou Are Now Listening to 103.5 Dawn FM\n\nJoined: May 2016\n\nPosts: 7,391\n\nMy Charts\n\nPost by kcdawg13 on\n\nDown Under, but Africa is very close.\n\nGod this was a hard choice."
