        "text": "This week's featured artist is Downunder, who has been playing energetic rock music in SL for over six years. Come get amped up at one of his shows soon!\n\nHis music can be found on SoundCloud.\n\nQ: When/how did you hear about Second Life?\n\nA: Well it was by accident really. I was on a program for a while called IMVU, where I could dj only. A friend on there that recommended Second Life to me, as he said you can perform there, so I joined up. At first I didn't like it, avatars weren't so good, so I went back to IMVU for another year or two. Then, I finally went back to Second Life and stayed. I was lucky to find an awesome manager, Pam Astonia, who has been with me for many years, and of course the amazing Downettes. They get to experience what it's like to be onstage and they all do an amazing job.\n\nQ: How did music come into your life, and what instruments do you play?\n\nA: My love for music began at an early age, always listening to the radio for new bands, but unfortunately I played professional sports so that took priority. It was only when I retired from sports that I joined bands and started playing all over Australia. Iâ€™ve tried to play the guitar but was hopeless, so singing is what I concentrated on.\n\nQ: How would you describe your style, and how has it evolved over the years?\n\nA: My style is all over the place, I like to consider myself an entertainer as well as a singer. I love having the crowd involved, I feed off that energy and at most shows I have too much energy and perform for many hours. I think my record is a five hour show. I think most SL performers evolve together for all new genres that come around.\n\nQ: What are some of the albums/tracks that have helped get you through the last year?\n\nA: Bands like Matchbox 20, Neil diamond, Foo fighters, and Inxs to name a few that I draw my inspiration from and have helped me get through a personally terrible year for myself.\n\nQ: What was your favourite inworld performance?\n\nA: Other than the numerous charity events, the show that always sticks in my mind was a memorial for a past manager of mine, Annie, who unfortunately passed away. It was a very hard show to do as she was loved by a lot of people, and I still dedicate her favourite song to her to this day, bless her.\n\nQ: What is the most meaningful aspect of the SL music community to you?\n\nA: Well, the talent. So many amazing performers in Second Life right in your lounge room, every genre, anything you like. Now that is amazing.\n\nThank you, Downunder! If you or someone you know would like to submit content for Music Mondays, please fill out this form.\n\nHave an amazing week, everybody!"
