        "text": "1.\n\nRiding In The Saddle 01:25\n\n[Spoken, with a sung section] I started performing songs in 1956, publicly, but I started writing songs a little bit before that. Don’t remember a lot of the songs but eh one of the songs I wrote was a cowboy haha cowboy song, ah-ha. Back in the days when we used to play cowboys and indians. And eh hand, hand me that guitar Charles. It's a twelve string, em, looks like an eleven string. OK, I used to sing this on the ukulele but I don’t have a ukulele anymore so I’ll sing it t', yeah. This is from 1955 or 54 and a half Ri... Oh it had a use of [Clicks tongue] had eh the horsebeats eh, for percuss' Riding in the saddle While going ‘cross the plain Moving on whenever I can But stopping when it rains The only one to talk to is my good old trusty horse [Laughs] Well, well that’s about the speed of it. My sisters and I used to sing 'em these songs when company would come over, and eh we’d sing Country Church Country People, and you know I did harmonies. And eh we’d sing eh Hard Luck And Bad News Blues, which was about me getting beat up all the time and I, I eh fantasised this song as though I were a, really in a, a down and out position instead of just a little kid getting beat up all the time. Hard Luck Bad News Blues, from about 1958 or 59\n\n2.\n\nI've been having some hard times All my life I hope things change pretty soon Hard luck and bad news Has followed me from town to town All my life my luck's been down I'm getting so weary I don't have one friend Folks turn their backs when I'm around And where I walk the grass turns brown No one will come near me Hard luck and bad news Hard luck and bad news If you were in my shoes you'd die My life's been lonely I've never heard a kindly word Ugly names is all I've heard And mean is how they treat me Nobody trusts me They blame me for the fires in town Claim that hell is where I'm bound And pray that God will speed me Hard luck and bad news Hard luck and bad news If you were in my shoes you'd die Woo Life's not worth living My sorrow's more than I can say Tomorrow's just another day I hate to see the sun rise Yet maybe someday I'll find a man to call a friend I'll be his friend until the end In loneliness my heart cry Hard luck and bad news Hard luck and bad news If you were in my shoes you'd die [x2]\n\n3.\n\nCountry Church, Country People 04:41\n\n​Last Sunday there was preaching We all went out to hear The little church was crowded The rich and poor were there It was a splendid sermon The singing full and free Country church, country people With their eyes upon the Lord Built a church with a steeple As a place to hear his word You can live and die in the same small town But the Lord spreads his love all around The choir was dressed in glory (Ooh ooh ooh ooh) Their voices dressed in love (Ooh ooh ooh) The music told the story (Ooh ooh ooh ooh) Of God who sent his son (Ooh ooh ooh) How Jesus came from heaven (Ah ah ah ah) To set the sinner free (Ah ah ah ah ah) Amazing grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once was lost But now I'm found Was blind but now I see The choir was finished singing And the congregation stood While the spirit touched and filled them (Ooh ooh ooh ooh) With power, love and good (Ooh ooh ooh) From God who reigns in heaven (Ah ah ah ah) Always watching every man (Ah ah ah ah ah) And guiding all his children With his kind protecting hand Oh Country church, country people With their eyes upon the Lord Built a church with a steeple As a place to hear his word You can live and die in the same small town But the Lord spreads his love all around But the Lord spreads his love all around (Ah ah ah ah)\n\n4.\n\nRiding High 02:16\n\nHigh, riding high On a trip in a ship through the sky I keep looking through the cloud Everything seems fine Everything I'll ever want is mine Riding high Riding high On a trip in a ship through the sky I keep reaching through the mist Melting fire with snow Watching changes in the world below Bap ba ba ba bap ba ba ba bap ba bap ba Ba ba ba bap ba ba ba bap ba ba ba bap bap I keep looking through the cloud Everything seems fine Everything I'll ever want is mine High, riding high [x4]\n\n5.\n\n​As I wander through this city In a nameless town I walk Now I've got this empty feeling Names on sidewalks scribed in chalk But powdered people cannot talk Can this be a city's tombstone Broken neon signs that say Happy days are here forever I think I'm in a play So let me think about today What will become of me now that I'm here When will the crowd give a cheer Have you got the time of day It doesn't bother me The time I've got could fill a day In one eternity It seems so strange it doesn't change There's no one here but me I wouldn't like to take a chance In real reality So long ago the city roared It filled me inside out Today I find an empty peace I shatter with my shout Look into windows where people have been No one expected to win Climbing stairs to reach the ending Of a life that's been a sham Why should I be left to wander City won't you take this man No one left to lend a hand Everything happens when nothing's the same Somebody tell me my name Somebody tell me my name [x8]​​​\n\n6.\n\nSoul On Fire 03:43\n\nWhen I was a young boy In a all black neighbourhood Well it was rough and tumble in a concrete jungle Hard to do the things you should But I walked straight and narrow Hmm I kept looking high Because Jesus, he set my soul on fire An' when I was a young man Temptation was all around You know when darkness finds you, it slips up behind you And tries to knock you to the ground But I just kept on walking Hmm hmm hmm I was so inspired Because Jesus, hmm he set my soul on fire And then a light from above shone down on my face And lifted me up to a heavenly place I heard the singing of angels on a distant shore And Jesus healed me And brought me back to life once more [Scatting] Now I am a grown man With a vision locked inside my heart And I speak to men of life and sin And the need to be set apart And I can run like a lion And I do not tire Because Jesus He set my soul on fire Soul on fire I'm burning with love for God Soul, soul on fire [x2] Soul on fire [x9] Ooh Mmm Nimba Ooh ah Jesus set my soul on fire\n\n7.\n\nRighteous Rocker 04:05\n\n​One two three [Spoken] You can be a righteous rocker or a holy roller You can be 'most anything You can be a child of the slum or a skid row bum Or you could be a corporate king You could be a wealthy man from Texas Or a witch with heavy hexes But without love you ain't nothing without love Without love you ain't nothing without love You can be a brilliant surgeon or a sweet young virgin Or a harlot out to sell You can learn to play the blues or be Howard Hughes Or the Scarlet Pimpernel You could be a French provincial midwife Or go from door to door with a death knife But without love you ain't nothing without love Without love you ain't nothing without love Without love you ain't nothing You ain't nothing without love Without love you ain't nothing without love Break Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ah ah Wo wo oh You could be a woman feeler or a baby stealer You could drink your life away You could be a holy prophet get a blessing off it You could fast for fifty days Oh you could shake hands with the devil Or give your life to God on the level But without love you ain't nothing You ain't nothing without love Without love you ain't nothing without love Without love you ain't nothing You ain't nothing (You ain't nothing without love) Without love you ain't nothing without love You could be a righteous rocker (Without love you ain't nothing without love) Alright You could be a holy roller (Without love you ain't nothing without love) Ra-ah ra-ah rah, without love You ain't nothing without love (Without love you ain't nothing without love) You ain't nothing, you ain't nothing (Without love you ain't nothing without love) Without love I do believe that without love (Without love you ain't nothing you ain't nothing without love) Nothing really matters (Without love you ain't nothing without love) Without love It don't matter who you are, who you know, where you go Without love you're nothing (Without love you ain't nothing without love) You are nothing, you are nothing You are nothing without (Without love you ain't nothing without love) Love (Without love you ain't nothing you ain't nothing without love) (Without love you ain't nothing without love) Aah aah (Without love you ain't nothing without love) (Without love you ain't nothing)\n\n8.\n\nShot Down 01:59\n\nI've been shot down, talked about Some people scandalize my name But here I am, talking 'bout Jesus just the same I been knocked down, kicked around But like a moth drawn to the flame Here I am, talking 'bout Jesus just the same Wo oh oh oh I been rebuked for the things I've said For the songs I've written and the life I've led They say they don't understand me but I'm not surprised Because you can't see nothing when you close your eyes They say I'm sinful and backslidden That I have left to follow fame But here I am, talking 'bout Jesus just the same Wo oh oh oh Go Jonny Yeah you wanna talk about my life, hey listen to me You got your facts all backwards, one two three And spreading rumors and gossip is a real bad game The only name to spread is Jesus name I've been shot down, kicked around But like a moth drawn to the flame Here I am, talking 'bout Jesus brother Here I am, talking 'bout Jesus sister Here I am, talking 'bout Jesus just the same ​Wo oh oh oh​\n\n9.\n\nWatch What You're Doing

legs sticking up Papa broke his glasses when he fell down drunk Tried to drown the kitty cat, turned out to be a skunk You gotta watch what you're doing Didn't you know Yeah you gotta watch where you're going Didn't you know Little Joe Billy went fishing for trout Played hooky from school 'til the cops found out Didn't have a father, was an only child His mama never beat him so he grew up wild You gotta watch what you're doing Yeah I knew a girl, sweet as could be But she fell for a man like a chain sawed tree She listened to his lies, was fooled by his charms Now she's sitting with a baby in her arms You gotta watch what you're doing Didn't you know You gotta watch what you're doing You oughta know that You gotta watch out Watch out Well everything's fine till things get bad Then you

oughta know where you're going Do you know Some folks smile, they seem alright Then you later find out it was an angel of light Try to love everybody but don't be blind 'Cause some kind of people try to mess your mind You gotta watch who you know yeah Some folks say that the good Lord's dead That he doesn't exist 'cept inside your head I wonder how many gonna be surprised When they look straight up and see him coming through the skies You gotta watch what you're doing Don't you know 'Cause he does yeah You know he watches what you're doing Yes he does You better know where you're going (Ooh

know what's right, I know what's wrong I don't confuse it All I'm really trying to say is Why should the devil have all the good music This ain't wrong is what I say Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues away Ahrarararararabababababa All I'm really trying to say is Why should the devil Why should the devil Why should the devil Why should the devil have anything\n\n12.\n\nMore Precious Than

falling from on high While a dark red cloud fills up the sky I don’t want our love to end this way What about the songs we haven’t sung What about the things we haven’t done What’s the matter with this world today Well if the bombs fall, baby I love you If they end it all, baby I love you Through it all, I want you to know I love you You and I are still so very young And with love the best is yet to come God has let me choose you, I don’t wanna lose you Who can say tomorrow will find its way Who can say the sun will shine today Baby I adore you, that’s why I’m living for you But if the bombs fall, baby I love you If they end it all, baby I love you Through it all, I want you to know I love you And through the years and all the long hard miles We’ll shed some tears but we will share the smiles A-don’t cry, I want you to know I love you If the bombs fall, baby I love you (Ooh ooh ooh ooh) If they end it all, baby I love you (Ooh ooh ooh ooh) If the bombs fall, this world of ours (baby I love you) been here a long long time (If they end it all) The stars above (baby I love you) I love to watch them shine (If the bombs fall) I need your love (baby I love you) to lead this life of mine (If they end it all) Ah wo-oh oh oh oh oh (Baby I love you) If the bombs fall, baby I love you If they end it all, baby I love you If the bombs fall, baby I love you If they end it all, baby I love you\n\n14.\n\nTrinity 01:40"
