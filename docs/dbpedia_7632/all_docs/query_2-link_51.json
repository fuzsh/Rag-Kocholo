Where women glow and men plunder? Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover Buying bread from a man in Brussels He was six-foot-four and full of muscles I said, \"do you speak-a my language?\" He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich And he said I come from a land down under Where beer does flow and men chunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover, yeah Lyin' in a den in Bombay With a slack jaw, and not much to say I said to the man, \"are you trying to tempt me Because I come from the land of plenty?\" And he said Do you come from a land down under? (oh yeah yeah) Where women glow and men plunder? Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover Living in a land down under Where women glow and men plunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover Living in a land down under Where women glow and men plunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover Living in a land down under Where women glow and men plunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover Living in a land down under Where women glow and men plunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\n\nBecome A Better Singer In Only 30 Days, With Easy Video Lessons!\n\n1 fan\n\nSheet Music PDF Playlist\n\nWritten by: Colin James Hay, Ronald Graham Strykert\n\nLyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC\n\nLyrics Licensed & Provided by LyricFind"
