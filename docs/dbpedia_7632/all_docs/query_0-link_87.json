        "text": "She was not looking for fame, but a 20-year-old Brisbane singer may have just found it, after signing a deal with a music company to use her cover of the Aussie classic Down Under.\n\nA year ago in her bedroom, university student Sabrina Schultz reworked the song, which was originally by the band Men at Work.\n\nMs Schultz, who lives at home with her mum and dad, posted her haunting version of the song on YouTube for friends and family to view, then forgot all about it.\n\n\"I have posted four videos up there,\" she said.\n\n\"I am not a big YouTube star — I'm not always posting.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, Ms Schultz received an email from a music company asking to buy the rights to use her cover as the theme for Wolf Creek season two, a spin-off series from the movies, which screens on an online-streaming service.\n\n\"I was on the phone to my mum,\" she said.\n\n\"Because I was on the train, I couldn't scream with excitement. I was going: 'can you please research this person because we have to know if this is real'.\"\n\nFour days later, she had a deal — not bad for a young woman who just sings for fun.\n\nDave Ruby Howe, the music director at JJJ Unearthed, said the bedroom was the new stage for musicians, a platform for emerging musicians to share their work.\n\nHe said major music labels regularly scoured the web looking for new talent.\n\n\"It's totally liberating,\" he said.\n\n\"The internet is connecting so many people, and so many people are interested in finding something new and something they've never heard before.\"\n\nBut even he reckons for a girl who was not trying to get noticed, Ms Schultz got seriously lucky.\n\n\"That does sound like catching lightning in a bottle, but it can happen — all it takes is for one really good song or a good voice or a good arrangement to connect with people,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that's probably an appeal to the big record labels to find these artists when they're really, really new.\n\n\"If they've already got an audience baked in and that's responding to them, then that's just capitalising on that — I think that's really attractive to a record label.\"\n\nColin Hay had to approve song version\n\nYet surprisingly, Ms Schultz's song only had about 1,000 views on YouTube when it was noticed.\n\nThe music company found her cover because it was specifically looking for a fresh version of Down Under.\n\nBut first, Colin Hay from Men at Work had to approve her version of the famous song.\n\nNow Ms Schultz has to get the song ready for sale on iTunes to coincide with the television show but she was not talking fame and fortune just yet.\n\n\"I'm a uni student, nearly finished — I am really realistic about it if it doesn't work out,\" she said."
