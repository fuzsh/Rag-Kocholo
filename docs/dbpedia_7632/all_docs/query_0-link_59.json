        "text": "FRIED-OUT= very very hot, esp. because of the sun (it feels like a frying-pan on the fire)\n\nCOMBIE= bigger than a van but smaller than a mini-bus. It can seat 6 to 10 people or so. Not in fashion anymore, but very common in hippie times.\n\nHIPPIE= (also HIPPY) someone who has chosen to live a different sort of life based on peace and love and has rejected conventional ideas about things such as dress and social values, usually wearing long hair and smoking pot (marihuana). The hippie movement was most popular during the 1960’s.\n\nZOMBIE= a living dead (fictional monsters or nullified people by voodoo techniques in Haiti). But the expression \"HEAD FULL OF ZOMBIE\" is because he’s been smoking pot (marihuana) so he feels totally dull and like a zombie (not a normal expression).\n\nGLOW= shine (because they’re beautiful/elegant)\n\nPLUNDER= to steal property from someone by using force and often causing damage (to rob)\n\nTHUNDER= the loud sound a lightening produces during an electrical storm. The thunder is referring to the sound of the storms rolling over the hills, heralding the coming of a storm.\n\nYOU BETTER RUN= you should run / if I were you, I would run. The \"grammatically correct\" sentence would be \"you had better\" or \"you’d better\", but in conversational English the auxiliary \"had\" is usually dropped out so, in practice, BETTER plays the role of an auxiliary verb meaning \"Should\".\n\nTAKE COVER= get shelter, go somewhere where you are protected. \"Cover\" is pronounced /kʌvə*/\n\nBRUSSELS= the capital of the EU (European Union) and Belgium\n\nHE WAS SIX FOOT FOUR= he was six foot and four inches tall (when giving a person’s height, FOOT has no plural). 1 foot (ft.) = 12 inches (in.) / 1 foot = 0.3048 metres, 1 inch = 2.54 cms.\n\n6.40 ft = 1.95 mts\n\nFULL OF MUSCLE= really built-up\n\nSPEAK-A= The syllable –A is just a SCHWA producing an extra syllable which comes great for the rhythm of the song, but means nothing.\n\nVEGEMITE SANDWICH= Vegemite is a dark brown savoury food paste made from yeast extract, used mainly as a spread on sandwiches, toast and cracker biscuits, as well as a filling of pastries like Cheesymite scroll, in Australia and New Zealand. It is similar to British and New Zealand Marmite. Vegemite is popular with many Australians and New Zealanders, who commonly consider it a national food and a cultural icon. It can be found in shops around the world, particularly where there are large populations of Australian expatriates. When the tall man gave him a vegemite sandwich he was proving that he is also from Australia.\n\nBEER DOES FLOW= The verb DO in an affirmative sentence is just emphasizing the main verb. The beer flows means there’s a lot of beer to drink (the same as \"rivers flow\")\n\nCHUNDER- to be sick (BrE), to vomit (an old-fashioned word still in use in Australia). It originates from old seafaring days when sailors would get seasick and stick their head out of the porthole in their cabin. As they did this they would shout \"Watch Under!\" to warn people in lower cabins of the forthcoming puke. Over the years this has evolved in Chunder. In this song, men chunder because they drink too much beer.\n\nLYIN'= lying\n\nDEN= in this case it means \"an opium den\", a place in some Asian countries where you could smoke opium. Bombay is a city in India.\n\nSomething which is SLACK is loose, not firmly attached to its position. JAW is the movable lower part of your mouth. So A SLACK JAW refers to the fact that he was high on drugs and his mouth was half open just the way all of your body is relaxed and loose after smoking opium.\n\nARE YOU TRYING TO TEMPT ME?= since he is in an opium den, the other man is probably offering him more opium (tempting him with more drug)\n\nTHE LAND OF PLENTY= The country of abundance. If you say that there is plenty of something, you mean that there is a lot of that thing so you have enough and even more than what you need (= more than enough / a real lot). If I say \"I’ve got plenty of wine\" I mean I’ve got more wine than what I need, so I can share.\n\nFADE OUT= if a sound or an image fades out, it gets weaker and weaker till it finally disappears."
