        "text": "The non-official Australia anthem yet a sort of its kind, \"Down Under\" conquered hearts and minds and an enjoyable portion of fans to the great band Men at Work with this graceful, humored and fun clip which presents a foreign experiencing a primal contact with the down under culture of Australia. Positively, their greatest hit ever even though \"Overkill\", \"Who Can it be Now?\" and \"No Sign of Yesterday\" are some of their greatest musical moments and a lot better than this song.\n\nA rarity in terms of clips, this one truly follows the song's lyrics with its telling of a man who meets all sorts of characters and situations while travelling to the land down under (Australia) as pointed in the lyrics - like the strange lady, the big muscled guy in Brussels and so on - and it's all presented in amusing, hilarious forms, like the way we use to know Men at Work, as a fun and energic group. It's all colorful, vivid and fun to watch.\n\nIt's a nice video though not hilarious and critical as \"It's a Mistake\" was but it's always a great treat to watch them. 9/10."
