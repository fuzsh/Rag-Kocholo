        "text": "Hello there! This week our blog features an infectious pop tune, Down Under. We will first discuss the original version by Men At Work. Next, we will review a cover by Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band, and finally a cover by Pennywise.\n\nMen At Work and Down Under:\n\nMen At Work was an Australian quintet. They were formed in 1979 in Melbourne by a pair of guitarists, Colin Hay and Ron Strykert. Hay and Strykert produced the group Men At Work by adding bassist John Rees, drummer Jerry Speiser, and Greg Ham on keyboards and flute.\n\nMen At Work released their first record in 1980. It consisted of the song Keypunch Operator on the “A” side, and Down Under as the “B” side. Although the band developed an enthusiastic following in Melbourne, they were unable to score a recording deal, so their first song was self-financed and did not make a splash.\n\nIn late 1981, Men At Work secured a contract with the Australian division of CBS Records. They released an album, Business As Usual, that shot up to #1 on both the Australian and New Zealand charts. But for a while CBS Records refused to release the album or singles in the U.S.\n\nHowever, CBS finally relented and released Business As Usual in the U.S. Down Under was the second single from that album.\n\nThe song Down Under describes the adventures of a young Australian with people from various cultures. He connects with each of them when they discover his homeland.\n\nTraveling in a fried-out Kombi\n\nOn a hippie trail, head full of Zombie\n\nI met a strange lady, she made me nervous\n\nShe took me in and gave me breakfast\n\nAnd she said\n\n[CHORUS] Do you come from a land down under?\n\nWhere women glow and men plunder?\n\nCan’t you hear, can’t you hear the thunder?\n\nYou better run, you better take cover.\n\nBuying bread from a man in Brussels\n\nHe was six-foot-four and full of muscles\n\nI said, “do you speak-a my language?”\n\nHe just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich\n\nAnd he said\n\nI come from a land down under\n\nWhere beer does flow and men chunder\n\nCan’t you hear, can’t you hear the thunder?\n\nYou better run, you better take cover, yeah\n\nSo here is Men At Work and their music video for Down Under.\n\nAs you can see, this is an extremely catchy tune with a clever arrangement. Apparently the song changed significantly since its first release in 1980. In particular, a bouncy jazz-inspired flute solo by Greg Ham was added, together with some rather sophisticated drumming.\n\nThe song contains a fair amount of Australian slang, which we will translate for the untutored reader. First, a “Kombi” is slang for the Volkswagen Type 2 combination van, and a “fried-out Kombi” would be a particularly grubby van. The “hippie trail” refers to a\n\nsubcultural tourist route popular in 1960s and 70s which stretched from Western Europe to South-East Asia.\n\n“Head full of Zombie” means that the singer is high on a particular strain of marijuana. One cannabis Web site describes Zombie as likely to induce a “peaceful weed coma.” “Chunder” is Australian slang for ‘vomit,’ a common occurrence for the hard-drinking Aussies.\n\n‘Vegemite’ deserves its own special mention. Vegemite is made from yeast extract; initially it was made from leftover brewer’s yeast from Australian breweries. The original yeast extract was the British product Marmite, which was popular in Australia. However, in World War I it became difficult to obtain Marmite in Oz, so Cyril Callister was assigned the task of developing a substitute for Marmite.\n\nCallister used food waste discarded by the Carlton Brewery Company. He added salt, celery and onion extracts, and came up with Vegemite. It turns out that Vegemite is a terrific source of B vitamins, containing B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), and B9 (folate). The product is sometimes fortified with B6 and B12, to make it a “vitamin B bomb.”\n\nWhen I was a grad student in England, I actually developed a fondness for Marmite, so it was natural for me to take to Vegemite when I visited Australia. The product has a potent “umami” flavor, much like a concentrated beef bouillon. Below is a photo of a jar of Vegemite, with the dark brown substance smeared on a couple of muffins.\n\nMy one complaint about Vegemite is that both the Brits and the Aussies gave me grief about the American fondness for peanut butter, despite their affection for this smelly, dark substance. And the Aussies really like their Vegemite – 90% of Australian households have it on hand.\n\nNow, back to Men At Work and Down Under. At the beginning of 1983, the song made it to #1 on both the US and UK singles playlists. In addition, the album containing the song spent 15 weeks at #1 on the U.S. Billboard albums chart. And Men At Work won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1983.\n\nThe tune has since become an Australian anthem – in 1983, the crew of the yacht Australia II adopted the song in their successful bid to win the America’s Cup sailing race, and in 2000 the song was played in the closing ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Sydney.\n\nDespite the song’s upbeat, bouncy arrangement, Colin Hay claims that this is actually a protest song. If so, it has to be one of the more subtle protest songs ever. However, if you watch the music video, when they are out on sand dunes the lads are interrupted by a man who plants a “SOLD” sign on their tablecloth.\n\nThe end of the tune features a coffin being carried over the sand. Hay asserts that these images represent the desecration of the environment from overdevelopment. Finally, he claims that the line “Can’t you hear the thunder, you better run, you better take cover” makes the point that the Australian ecology and lifestyle are threatened. So now you know.\n\nHere is Men At Work in a live performance of Down Under.\n\nThis took place at a concert in Dortmund, Germany in 1983. As you can see, the audience is extremely enthusiastic about the tune. And Men At Work produce a very competent live version of their smash hit.\n\nThe song Down Under was involved in a complicated plagiarism lawsuit. In 2009, Men At Work were sued by Larrikin Music, who claimed that the flute solo in Down Under was similar to the tune of Kookaburra, one of Australia’s most popular folk tunes (Larrikin owned the rights to that song, which was written in 1932).\n\nNow, I have listened to both Kookaburra and Down Under, and in my opinion there is only a slight similarity between the song and the flute solo. In addition, Larrikin filed its suit 28 years after Down Under was released; furthermore, many people would claim that after 77 years as a traditional song, Kookaburra should be in the public domain.\n\nNevertheless, the judge in the case ruled that the flute solo in Down Under had copied “a substantial part of Kookaburra.” Larrikin Music requested that Men At Work pay them 40-60% of royalties from that song from the previous six years (note that the flute solo represents only a small fraction of the song, and has nothing to do with the overall melody!). The judge ruled that Men At Work pay Larrikin 5% of the royalties from the song, beginning in 2002 and continuing forever. The band subsequently lost their appeal of the case.\n\nGreg Ham, the musician who composed and played the flute solo on the piece, was devastated by the result. He believed that his reputation had been irreparably damaged, and that he would ever afterwards be known as a plagiarist. In 2012, Ham died of a heart attack at age 58.\n\nMen At Work produced three albums before they broke up and disbanded in 1986. Their first two albums were blockbusters, but the third album unveiled a very different musical style and was a commercial flop.\n\nSince that time, some members of the band re-united for a tour or two; later Colin Hay re-formed Men At Work where he was the only original member. Since their break-up, the members of Men At Work pursued their own projects; and for the past few years Colin Hay has been a member of Ringo Starr’s All-Starr band.\n\nWe loved the song Down Under. We never saw Men At Work in concert, although we did see a solo performance by Colin Hay where he unveiled a quite different arrangement of his most popular tune. We wish the surviving members of Men At Work all the best.\n\nRingo Starr & His All-Starr Band and Down Under:\n\nAfter the breakup of the Beatles, each member of the band had to figure out what to do next. For a while, Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr) embarked on a solo career.\n\nRingo played drums in John Lennon’s Plastic Ono Band, and had an extended collaboration with George Harrison. Three of Ringo’s biggest solo hits (Photograph, It Don’t Come Easy, and Back Off Boogaloo) were co-written by Starr and Harrison. Despite his limited singing ability, Ringo’s solo career was relatively successful. In fact, in 2015 Ringo Starr was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for his work as a solo artist.\n\nAn important event occurred in late 1988 when Ringo and his wife, Barbara Bach, went into alcohol rehab at a clinic in Tucson. Energized by his new sobriety, Ringo went back to touring.\n\nWorking with producer David Fishof, Ringo formed a group called Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band. The idea was to create a supergroup consisting of the best musicians on their respective instruments, and to go out on tour with Ringo.\n\nThe All-Starr Band setlist would include roughly a dozen of Ringo’s songs from his time with the Beatles or during his solo career. In addition, each band member would perform two or three of their most famous tunes.\n\nThe membership of the All-Starr band changes each time. Since 1989, Ringo has toured with 14 different All-Starr bands.\n\nThe first edition of the All-Starr band, in 1989, included Joe Walsh (of the Eagles) and Nils Lofgren (E Street Band) on guitar, Jim Keltner and Levon Helm (The Band) on drums, Dr. John and Billy Preston on keyboards, Rick Danko (The Band) on bass, and Clarence Clemons (E Street Band) on saxophone.\n\nOur upcoming video is from the 2003 version (the 8th) of the All-Starr Band. In addition to Ringo and Colin Hay, the band included Paul Carrack (of Mike & the Mechanics and several other bands) on keyboards and guitar, John Waite of The Babys on bass, Sheila E on drums, and Mark Rivera on every other instrument.\n\nSo here is Colin Hay with the Ringo Starr All-Starr Band in a live performance of Down Under.\n\nI enjoy this immensely. The song includes the essential flute solos (here with some additional jazzy touches from Mark Rivera). The amazing Ringo contributes his terrific drumming – nothing flashy, just technically perfect. He is joined here by Sheila E, who throws in some of the more esoteric drum licks.\n\nYou can see why Ringo Starr’s All-Starr band is so popular. Ringo seems to have essentially no ego, so he is perfectly happy to give his band-mates the opportunity to showcase their biggest hits. In addition, he never fails to meld a group of extraordinary individuals into a tight and impressive musical ensemble.\n\nWishing ‘success’ for Ringo Starr seems superfluous. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor (Sir Richard Starkey, MBE) by Queen Elizabeth in 2018. As we have mentioned, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, once as a Beatle and the second time for his solo career. And by the way, Ringo is the richest drummer in the world, with a net worth estimated at $350 million. Not bad for a person whose childhood upbringing was “a Dickensian chronicle of misfortune,” and who received no more than a 5th-grade education because of a number of serious health issues.\n\nWe wish Ringo all happiness. He invariably finishes his concerts with his signature tune, A Little Help From My Friends, from the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album. Now that Ringo is sober, he no longer includes the line “I get high with a little help from my friends.” Good for him. By all accounts, a great guy and a fabulous musician.\n\nPennywise and Down Under:\n\nThe band Pennywise is a punk rock quartet that was formed in 1988. The members were from Hermosa Beach, CA. They consisted of lead vocalist Jim Lindberg, guitarist Fletcher Dragge, bassist Jason Thirsk and drummer Byron McMacklin. Three of their four members had been students at Mira Costa High School. They adopted the name of the evil clown in the Stephen King horror novel It.\n\nInitially, the band found little commercial success. However, over time the California punk-rock scene burgeoned with groups such as Green Day, Blink-182 and Rancid. At that time, Pennywise became more successful.\n\nDuring their career, Pennywise have released 12 studio albums and one live album. They have sold 3 million records, which is quite successful for a punk-rock band. Their lineup has also been remarkably stable.\n\nIn 1996, Pennywise bassist Jason Thirsk died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He had dealt for some time with alcohol addiction; after apparently achieving sobriety, he relapsed and then shot himself. Thirsk was replaced in Pennywise by bassist Randy Bradbury.\n\nThe band’s cover of Down Under by Men At Work was included on the group’s fourth album in 1999. That song was released as a single, but only in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nHere is Pennywise in a live performance of Down Under.\n\nThis is a song from the Pennywise 25th anniversary tour, here at a stop in Adelaide, Australia in April, 2013. This is your standard testosterone-fueled head-banger’s music. The drummer whacks on his instruments non-stop. The guitar and bass thrash away at warp speed, while lead singer Jim Lindberg does not sing so much as he shouts the lyrics.\n\nI must admit I don’t get the appeal. I see little musical ability or creativity on display here. On the other hand, I acknowledge that a band has to have a faithful following to continue for 30 years. So somebody likes this stuff, and certainly the Adelaide audience in the music video appear to be having a good time.\n\nThe band released their latest album, Never Gonna Die, in April 2018. Their record label Epitaph Records claims that the group’s music is designed to\n\ninspire radical change, personal empowerment, relentless hijinks, and reckless fast times.\n\nI had never thought of punk-rock music providing “personal empowerment,” but I suppose that it does give a sense of empowerment to its fans. So, power on, Pennywise.\n\nSource Material:"
