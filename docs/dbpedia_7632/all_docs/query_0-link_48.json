And I'm filling it with things Like furniture I find on the street And all the special things I'd like to eat Pictures of people that I'd like to meet I'll meet them when I'm orbiting the world... ...And it's so pretty... ...And so lonely... My lovely love affairs Are all scheduled ‘round the TV guide And my sex life has all been plagiarised In an attempt to meet a harsh deadline... I'd like to rent-a-wife Then rent a husband to keep her for life The three of us, we could be so happy (Them with each other, me with company) I'll see them off on a flight around the world... ...And it's so pretty... ...And so lonely... ...And at my funeral they will say \"Tom, he was such a nice guy, He went too early, but he went in style.\" They'll play my music and then they will cry They'll have a little wake They'll drink bad wine and they'll eat lemon cake And my mother's little heart will break And she'll say: \"Wait! There must be some mistake - he can't be dead Take me instead!!!\" Oh, but I'm not dead They tell me I'm not dead They say that I'm not dead And I won't die for some time... I'm in my little house Just writing little songs to pass the time Which (incidentally) is precisely nine So don't you worry, I'm completely fine I'm fine I am just so fucking fine\n\n7.\n\nNew Zealand 04:38\n\n8.\n\nOn An Unknown Beach 05:44\n\nI'm a pale intruder on an unknown beach My back to the water My feet in the sand Finding no recognition as each sign of life Invades the precision of this ageing land An abandoned flipper in a world of stone There's a man on the shoreline with a white parakeet Trying to make his bird go home With increasing continuity, endless space Gazes 'round the periphery not disheartened Wearing its most inexpressible face My instinct is double as the waves roll by But my vision is halved In the foam in the green as The insects talk to the blazing sky Wax in the ear Stitch in the side Wolves are feast for the blind Under and over The why and the wherefore Easy to sit back with time Driving discussions like cranes through the car park Setting them all in a line All interceding Not yet receding Misleading doubts In the mind I'm a pale intruder on an unknown beach My back to the water My feet in the sand Needing no recognition as each sign of life Invades the precision of this ageing land\n\n9.\n\nWe're Happy Little Vegemites 01:23\n\n10.\n\nDoctor Oz 04:51\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\nThe Ship Song 06:07"
