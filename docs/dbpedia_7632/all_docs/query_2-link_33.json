Boss pedals, Fender guitars and amps. That chorus sound is typical Dimension D IMO. I don't hear a ton of reverb on the studio version of the track either. But I put a touch on there for you if you want to play around with it. Keep it bright; I like a plate for the 80s chorus tunes.\n\nSo: comp -> drive (for a little hair of the dog) -> Twin Reverb -> Twin Reverb IR -> Dimension D -> Reverb\n\nFor the AMP block, when I'm dialing in 80s Twin sounds, I start with the \"Evil Twin\" settings: 6, 6, 6 on Bass, Middle and Treble. And then adjust Bright and Presence from there. Maybe a little input gain, but I usually leave it at 5. A Boss pedal to put a little hair on it. So good.\n\nHere's a patch: http://axechange.fractalaudio.com/detail.php?preset=3982\n\nClip incoming...but it plays super nice with the studio track here on my machine.\n\nEdit: CLLLLLLIIIIIIIIIPPPPP!\n\nMan, I love 80s pop guitar.\n\nIan, that sounds really good. I have a similar approach for the \"glassy cleans\". Recently got some compliments on the clean I setup but dont use any compression. I think that is missing, I dont have an XL but I would be curious to see how you set things up with the compression block. Can this be ported to a Mark1 platform?\n\nHuge thanks, Ian! Much appreciated. Looking forward to see how it sounds with my guitar (not a strat, a Tom Anderson with humbuckers all around) and how it sits in the mix. Regardless, your clip sounds much much better than all my feeble attempts to date. Thanks again!\n\nIan, that sounds really good. I have a similar approach for the \"glassy cleans\".

No amp.\n\nTry a CAB block with a null IR and the preamp turned on.\n\nI can take a swing at this weekend.\n\nYeah, there's something a little different going on but not sure what it was. It has a very tasteful solo - I think I need to revisit some of their recordings\n\nIn Land down under, during verses, the guitar tone is clean but punchy, with quite a bit of reverb but not washed out, maybe some chorus but I'm not sure, and there's maybe even a touch of compression...\n\nHaving said all that, I can't dial in that tone at all on my Axe FX II XL (surely not that it can't nail it, just that I don't have the necessary tweaking skills).\n\nHelp a brother out, please?\n\nYes there is a boss chorus on that song. Amp settings for land down under single coil and humbuckers. Clean amp set the gain around 12 oâ€™clock. Get a hall reverb. Then for humbuckers the amp settings are mids at 3.5 bass at 4.4 and treble at 6. Single coils amp settings are bass mids and treb at 6. Hope this helps.\n\nThat main guitar on It's A Mistake sounds direct to the board to me. No amp.\n\nTry a CAB block with a null IR and the preamp turned on.\n\nI can take a swing at this weekend.\n\nIt sounds very trebly. Maybe the treble turned to like 6 or 7. Could be di or a Vox amp. The solo sound sounds like tele middle position going through a chorus and an overdrive pedal."
