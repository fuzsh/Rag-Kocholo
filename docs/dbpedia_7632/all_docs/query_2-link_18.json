        "text": "I've got a question or two for any Australians in the forum about a part of my fanfic. What is the Australian opinion on the Men at Work song 'Down Under'? I recalled a wikipedia entry on the song saying it's become a popular and patriotic song in Australia.\n\nHowever I've heard the same said of Waltzing Matilda.\n\nThe reason I'm asking is I've got an interesting scene for my fanfic 'Dark Realm'. It's a lighter moment where Tom Paris, ever the 20th Century History afficianado argues with Henry Kano (an Original Character of mine who is Australian) that Down Under was the quizzential song in the expression of Australian pride where Henry argues that Waltzing Matilda has that status exclusively saying, \"Hey, Waltzing Matilda nearly became our national anthem.\"\n\nCan anyone offer an opinion or two on the subject?\n\n(IRL I'm not Australian, but my Star Trek: Voyager - Dark Realm character, Henry Kano is. Henry got his last name, Kano, off of Trevor Goddard's presentation of the Mortal Kombat villain.)\n\nBoth songs very much to the pride of this country, but Walting Matilda is very much like a second anthem to us, as often the crowd will sing it at sporting events.\n\nThat's why I'm gonna have my character argue Waltzing Matilda is the \"quintessential\" Australian song. I goofed when typing the first post, I apologize.\n\nThe compelling arguement for Waltzing Matilda, is like you said, at sporting events, the song is sung by the whole crowd. I remember how the 2003 Australia/New Zealand Rugby game went, right after the All Blacks Haka came the stirring rendition of Waltzing Matilda."
