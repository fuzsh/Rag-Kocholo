        "text": "#1 Edited By Everyones_A_Critic\n\nEveryone's favorite song is \"Down Under\" by Men at Work. You know this, I know this, it's a fact of life. And why shouldn't it be? Coming off of the classic album Business as Usual, it is a timeless testament to the will and spirit of the Australian people. OR IS IT?! The other day I got really stoned and decided that I would take this song on Jesse Ventura style and get to the bottom of this, to find the hidden meaning behind the greatest song of all time.\n\nLyrics will be italicized, while my expert analysis will be in normal type:\n\nTraveling in a fried-out combi\n\nOur heroes are traveling in a beat up shitbox of a car, the best their stoner lifestyle can afford them.\n\nOn a hippie trail head full of zombie\n\nZombie, of course, is a codeword for Marijuana. Our heroes have smoked their last bowl-pack of the bag, and are running dangerously low on grass. Thus they embark on a journey down the\n\n\"Hippie Trail\" in an effort to score more bud. Pay attention here, as the procuring of Marijuana will be a recurring theme in this complex and tragically misinterpreted tale.\n\nI met a strange lady, she made me nervous\n\nThe boys come upon a woman who may have just what they're looking for, however given that female dealers are a bit of an oddity in the '80's, they are justly suspicious of her intentions, thus \"nervous\"\n\nShe took me in and gave me breakfast\n\nTired of the boys' irritating cynicism, the woman just wants to make her sale and get on with her life. Frustrated, she takes them to her home to show them she isn't bullshitting and she actually has some pretty dank stuff.\n\nAnd she said: Do you come from a land down under?\n\nShe can obviously tell that our heroes are not from her home turf. They stick out like suburban white kids in the heart of the ghetto, and she knows this. She inquires as to where they are from as she assembles their order of narcotics.\n\nWhere women glow, and men plunder?\n\n\"Look guys, you best get your product and get out of here, you don't belong here. Motherfuckers get robbed here and the women even glow.\"\n\nCan't you hear can't you hear that thunder?\n\n\"OH SHIT! DRIVE BY! GET DOWN!\" The woman and our heroes throw themselves to the floor as a hail of gunfire erupts onto the dealer's home. Thankfully, no one is hurt in the fray.\n\nYou better run, you better take cover!\n\nUnable to complete the illegal transaction, the woman rushes our heroes out of her home before the hit squad can come back and finish the job. Understandably jarred and still without any good weed to calm them down, the men press on in search of the sticky icky.\n\nBuying bread from a man in Brussells\n\nOur heroes stop by a shady looking bread vendor in order to get some food and rethink their approach on getting some drugs.\n\nHe was six foot four, and full of muscle\n\nHe's a big fucker. Very intimidating and yet somehow feminine (I'll get to this later)\n\nI said do you speak-a my language?\n\nIt is here where one of our heroes drops the bomb and asks: \"Hey man, you got anything for me?\" a vague way of asking if the man is in possession of the ganj.\n\nHe just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich\n\nThe man is a homosexual prostitute. In a bizarre yet tragic turn of events, our heroes are each ass-raped despite crying out about the blatant misunderstanding the two parties have shared.\n\nAnd he said: I come from a land down under\n\n\"Sorry boys, but where I come from that kind of talk means you take it up the ass, which I conveniently also do.\"\n\nWhere beer does flow, and men chunder\n\n\"You get a few beers deep and all the holes start looking the same, you know what I mean? It's not a big deal.\"\n\nCan't you hear can't you hear that thunder?\n\nThe stampeding horde of fellow gigolos is heard in the distance, the boys must leave quickly if they hope to see another day with their assholes intact.\n\nBetter run, better take cover\n\nPretty self explanatory here.\n\nLyin' in a den in Bombay\n\nBurnt out, ass-raped, and nearly killed in a drive-by, our heroes sit in a den in Bombay mulling over the crazy day they've had and the fact that they're still out of weed.\n\nWith a slack jaw, and not much to say\n\nDepressed, the group begins to think they've failed completely. That they've been raped and nearly killed for nothing but a futile attempt to buy drugs.\n\nI said to the man are you trying to tempt me?\n\nSuddenly, a man enters the den. He claims to have what they seek, for a price. Understandably so, our heroes ask him if this price includes ass-rape or drive-by shootings....\n\nBecause I come from the land of plenty?\n\n...Because of their seemingly privileged background?\n\nAnd he said: do you come from a land down under?\n\n\"For the millionth time man, no, we aren't from here. We're just a few kids trying to score some weed and maybe write the greatest song of all time in the process. Is that too much to ask?\"\n\nWhere women glow, and men plunder?\n\n\"If we've learned one thing in this fucked up adventure, it's that your women are seductresses and your men are nothing but rapists and thieves.\"\n\nCan't you hear can't you hear that thunder?\n\nThe man, disgraced by our hero's crude portrayal of his homeland, reveals the pistol in his waistband. \"You see this punk?\"\n\nYou better run, you better take cover\n\nGET THE FUCK DOWN HE'S GOT A GUN!!!\n\nThe song ends here, with our narrator and his cohort's fates left hanging in the balance. Did they get shot and die? Did they escape and eventually find weed? I certainly hope the latter is true, but in Australia, dear reader, anything is possible. Much like the ending of Inception, the geniuses that crafted this musical masterwork have let the fate to the listener's discretion. So what say you of Giant Bomb? What happened to Colin Hay and his intrepid bandmates after the psychopath pulled the gun in the den? There are no wrong answers here."
