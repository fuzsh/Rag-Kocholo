        "text": "When the Australian band Men at Work sang the lyric \"Do you come from a land down under? Where women glow and men plunder?\" it is unlikely they expected said plundering would haunt them.\n\nThe federal court in Sydney ruled today that the group's best-known track Down Under plagiarised a campfire song about the penchant of a native bird, the kookaburra, for eating gum drops and counting monkeys, written more than 70 years ago by the late Marion Sinclair, a teacher and girl guide leader.\n\nMen at Work's 1983 hit – which tells the story of an Australian backpacker's trip around the world – reached number 1 in the Australian, UK and US charts in the 1980s and was played at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nThe court ordered that compensation should be paid by Men at Work's songwriters Colin Hay and Ron Strykert, and by the band's record companies Sony BMG Music Entertainment and EMI Songs Australia, to Larrikin Music, the company which owns the rights to Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree.\n\n\"I have come to the view that the flute riff in Down Under … replicates in material form a substantial part of Ms Sinclair's work,\" the federal court justice Peter Jacobson said.\n\nThe parties will reconvene in court on 25 February to work out an agreement.\n\nLarrikin Music's lawyer, Adam Simpson, said outside court the company may seek up to 60% of the royalties earned by Down Under, an amount that could total millions.\n\nKookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree was penned by Sinclair in 1932.\n\nShe reportedly introduced it at a world scouting jamboree in Victoria in 1934, and it quickly spread among guiding associations.\n\nMen at Work lead singer Hay told ABC News that the flautist Greg Ham used two bars from Kookaburra, but said the flute bits were added to Down Under after it was composed.\n\n\"When it was written, there was no Men At Work,\" he said. \"There was no flute in the band at all and so when you talk about Down Under, that's what Down Under is to me. I'll go to my grave knowing Down Under is an original piece of work.\n\n\"When I wrote that with Ron, we took nothing from anybody and it was a musical accident that happened.\"\n\nSounds familiar …\n\nGeorge Harrison's My Sweet Lord and The Chiffons' He's So Fine\n\nHarrison was found guilty of \"unconscious\" plagiarism but in a legal twist ended up owning the Chiffons' song.\n\nMadonna's Frozen and Salvatore ­Acquaviva's Ma Vie Fout L'camp\n\nLittle-known Belgian songwriter Acquaviva's claim that Madonna's number borrowed his melody was upheld .\n\nBeyoncé Knowles's Halo and Kelly Clarkson's Already Gone\n\nBoth worked with producer Ryan Tedder, both unwittingly released songs with similar drumbeat and piano melody."
