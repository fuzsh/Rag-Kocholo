        "text": "Colloquial term usually referring to Australia and New Zealand\n\nThis article is about the geographical colloquialism. For other uses, see Down Under (disambiguation) and Land Down Under (disambiguation).\n\nFor the song by Men at Work, see Down Under (song).\n\nThe term Down Under is a colloquialism differently construed to refer to Australia and New Zealand, or the Pacific island countries collectively.[1][2] The term originally referred solely to Australia and gradually expanded in scope. It comes from the fact that Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere, “below” almost all other countries on the usual arrangement of a map or globe which places cardinal north at the top.[1][3]\n\nThe term has been in use since the late 19th century,[4] and the persistence of the media use of the term has led to its wide acceptance and usage, especially in reference to Australia. The Men at Work song “Down Under” became a patriotic rallying song for Australians. The Russian-Australian boxing champion Kostya Tszyu was nicknamed “The Thunder from Down Under”, as is Australian snooker player Neil Robertson. When the then Miss Australia Jennifer Hawkins was crowned as Miss Universe 2004 in Quito, Ecuador, she was called by the same nickname by host Billy Bush.[5]\n\nAccording to American film critic Roger Ebert's tongue-in-cheek Glossary of Movie Terms, the Down Under Rule:\n\nNo film set in Australia is allowed to use the word Australia in its title where “Down Under” is an acceptable alternative. For example, we don't get The Rescuers in Australia or Quigley in Australia.\n\nThe Tour Down Under is a cycling race in and around Adelaide, South Australia, and since 2009 has been the inaugural event of the UCI World Tour Ranking calendar, which culminates in the Giro di Lombardia.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
