        "text": "Ah, the crazy world of corporate-owned copyright.\n\nFull Story\n\nSYDNEY (AP) - A judge ordered Australian band Men at Work on Tuesday to hand over a portion of the royalties from their 1980s hit \"Down Under,\" after previously ruling its distinctive flute riff was copied from a children's campfire song.\n\nBut the penalty - 5 percent of the song's royalties - was far less than the 60 percent sought by publishing company Larrikin Music, which holds the copyright for the song \"Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree.\"\n\n\"Kookaburra\" was written more than 70 years ago by Australian teacher Marion Sinclair for a Girl Guides competition, and the song about the native Australian bird has been a favorite around campfires from New Zealand to Canada.\n\nSinclair died in 1988, but Larrikin filed a copyright lawsuit last year. In February, Federal Court Justice Peter Jacobson ruled Men at Work had copied their song's signature flute melody from \"Kookaburra.\"\n\nIs the judge tone-deaf? This is a very disturbing settlement, in that it could influence so many future decisions. I'm sorry, but while Down Under does share many of the same notes in the run as Kookaburra, the cadence is so dissimilar that in no way is it the same song.\n\nWhat do Australian song writers have to do to keep something original? Make a whole new set of notes? 'This one is in the key of S...\"\n\nJustin\n\nYes to all the above. No reasonable person would assume Down Under was in any way related to that old children's song. It seems, however, that reason and common sense does not apply in the courts. The judge only awarded 5%, but some may see that as an incentive to sue. If all composers have to prove they weren't influenced by music they heard in their youth, we're in real trouble!\n\nI'd assume it was related, because it was a deliberate quote from the song as a statement of being Australian. I don't see how anyone could honestly deny that.\n\nWhether that itself means that there was a violation is a different question (I see a difference between \"copy\" and \"quote\"), but it doesn't sound like that was the point the courts were getting at.\n\nI can't hear anything in there that would make it plagerizm.\n\nThen again.... Led Zeppelin released \"Fool in the Rain\" in 1979. A song about someone supposed to meet someone on the corner, but being on the wrong corner.\n\nGenesis released \"Misunderstanding\" in 1980. A song about someone supposed to meet someone on the corner, but being on the wrong corner WITH THE SAME PATTERN OF NOTES..... and no one seemed to notice.\n\nThat's crazy. Half the songs I hear on the radio remind me of some other song from the past, either through direct musical quotes or just by copying the general vibe of a cool older song. That's not stealing, it's just the music biz. Unless it's a totally brazen ripoff of some work, there has to be some leeway.\n\nThe song is called \"Down Under\" - they were just trying to make it sound Australian, so they put that little quote of the Kookaburra song in there. Of course it was deliberate, but they weren't stealing. They should have paid them 1% at most for the priviledge, no more.\n\nGiven that the royalties are only 5% of sales since 2002 due to statute of limitations, it's probably not really all that much money. It was a very popular song, but that was long before 2002. I wonder what the actual dollar amount will be. More than I would like to pay, sure, but in the big picture maybe not so much. Reading between the lines, I suspect the judge may have felt compelled to make an award, but really had more sympathy for Men at Work.\n\nWhat do Australian song writers have to do to keep something original? Make a whole new set of notes? 'This one is in the key of S...\"\n\nI know a singer who can sing in the key of S\n\nWhat a stupid ruling, but what else can you expect from a copyright lawsuit?\n\nIt is a relief to hear that the penalty is going to be set so low after all, but in my opinion even 5% is too much.\n\nColin Hay, the songwriter in Men At Work, said that he wrote the song during a soundcheck for one of their early gigs, and that the band played it that night. The flautist who performs on the record, and who improvised that little riff and decided to make it a permanent part of the song, did not join the band until two years later, by which time it was an established part of their live set. I accept that the riff is probably an unconscious quote, but 5% for something like that does seem quite harsh.\n\nI rip off the odd couples theme song on a semi regular basis I cant help it it just leaps forth from my hands if my mind goes blank...... I never made any money from it so guess I am safe from lawsuit .\n\nIs it legal to steal a song if you do it all backwards and change the words?"
