        "text": "Description\n\nAerosmith, live from Memorial Drive Park, Adelaide, Australia on 29th September 1990.\n\nHot on the heels of its multi-platinum selling album, Permanent Vacation (1987), Aerosmith was on top form, and for the first time, drug free, when the band released Pump in September 1989. Often referred to as the \"Bad Boys from Boston\", Aerosmith formed in 1971 with Steven Tyler on vocals, Joe Perry on guitar, Joey Kramer on drums, Tom Hamilton on bass, and Brad Whitford on guitar. Tyler and Perry - known as the \"Toxic Twins\" due to their enthusiastic drug use on and off stage - took on the songwriting duties and would later be rewarded with entry into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013. It is not hard to understand why, with four global hits featured on Pump alone, including Grammy Award-winning song, 'Janie's Got A Gun'.\n\nThe gig featured here was part of the tour to promote Pump, and took place on 29 September 1990 at Memorial Drive Park, Adelaide, Australia. This was the first Aerosmith tour to hit Australia. The concert was broadcast live by the Triple M radio network. Featured here are several tracks from Pump, including 'Monkey On My Back', 'Janie's Got A Gun', and 'Love In An Elevator'. Also included are tracks from Permanent Vacation (title track, 'Permanent Vacation', 'Rag Doll', and 'Dude Looks Like A Lady'),' Draw the Line' (the title track to the 1977 album), and 'Walk This Way'. The latter song was originally recorded for the album, Toys In The Attic (1975) but was covered by Run-D.M.C in 1986 with Aerosmith, spawning a huge international hit and bringing Aerosmith to a new audience."
