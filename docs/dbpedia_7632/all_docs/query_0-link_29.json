        "text": "Down Under, partly filmed at Lake Mackenzie on Fraser Island, features Coli Hay as an Australian traveller circling the globe, proud of his nationality and about his interactions with people he meets on his travels who are interested in his home country. The flute part in the song is based around the tune of \"Kookaburra\", a well-known Australian children's rhyme. The video also features several litre-size cans of what appear to be Foster's Lager, a beer native to Australia.\n\nIt was parodied in The Treble's \"No Secrets (There For You)\" video."
