        "text": "I was looking forward to a four-city Australia tour with Madlib and J.Rocc last October. Iâd never been, and the opportunity to get paid to DJ â and to visit the countryâs four main cities alongside record-collecting pals â seemed like the perfect way to spend a week. Of course, there would be the requisite exercise in the restrained hedonism of good food and good drink. And Iâd thoroughly schooled myself beforehand: knowing that one of the new worldâs finest old-world style wines hailed from South Australia â Penfolds Grange, a Rhone-styled wine made primarily from Australiaâs favorite grape, shiraz â I was looking forward to exploring off-the-beaten-path Aussie wines, and I figured that at least Madlib would be up for the challenge. So we allowed our wine rider â possibly the most complex two pages in a five-page document â to be altered to focus on the local juice.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I found J.Rocc â not the most easily impressed by the wines found backstage on a Madlib Medicine Tour stop â enjoying a glass or two. And imagine my chagrin to find that both he and Madlib, my stalwart digging partner, laughed me away when I told them of my plans to spend my off-hours finding the great records that I was sure Australia would offer. It started shortly after we landed, during a bleary-eyed brunch at a smart-looking downtown Brisbane cafÃ© which, naturally, served a better flat-white than even a Los Angeles coffee snob like myself could get at home. Ayers Rock! Galapagos Duck! The Don Burrows Christmas album with the âJingle Bellsâ break! Oh yeah, Egon, youâre in for a great time. Good luck. Have fun. Weâll be asleep at the hotel. Wake us up for dinner if you find something good.\n\nSure, Iâd been raised, like any child of the turntabling age in the â80s, on Men at Work. But Iâd been fortunate enough to erase that memory with the likes of Aussie jazzer John Sangster and his universally approachable canon. And there I stood, in Australia, knowing there were some damn good records just waiting to be found, so cracked-out tired from a 12-and-a-half-hour flight cramped in economy â Madlibâs pal at Virgin America was polite enough to upgrade he and J.Rocc, but I was left behind (note to self: remember that flight the next time homey asks for a last-minute guestlist hook up) â that all I could think of was the simple soul-rock of Jeff St. John. With his flat rendition of Sly and the Family Stoneâs âSing a Simple Songâ repeating in my head, I almost retired to the hotel for a nap myself.\n\nBut Iâm glad I didnât. And in the moment, I was glad to be able to cajole Madlib and J.Rocc into taking a walk to Egg Records in Brisbaneâs West End, if only because they got to hear the killer prog-rock of Spectrumâs Milesago. Lenny Webber, manning the store at the time, was kind enough to play the best cuts from the album in their entirety alongside the garage psychedelia of Processionâs self-titled album. That proved my point: fellas, there are some great records here, just begging to be rediscovered.\n\nLenny reminded me that DJ Sheep lived nearby. Sheep! Bevan? My dude with all of those rare Russian records that Iâd swapped for on Santa Monica Boulevard five years back? A quick phone call later and there I was, standing on the corner of Boundary and Vulture Streets, looking out for the wiry digging expert and anticipating some old-fashioned Aussie schooling. Not more than five minutes later I stepped into Sheepâs car, explaining that Madlib and J.Rocc had decided to skip the proceedings in favor of some shut eye but that I, feeling as perishable as a stack of ripened bananas, was ready to buy. He whisked me to his lab in a quaint Queenslander house â Bulletproof Crates was the name, he later told me â and the adventure began.\n\nBlackfeather - âMangoâs Theme Pt. 2â\n\n(Infinity, circa 1970)\n\nAs advertised, Sheep had plenty of records in the lab, but precious few were for sale. And it had been a while since weâd seen each other, so he pulled out a series of breaks and beats that might have touched the right nerve in 2009 but were removed from my current wants in 2012. He hit the nail on the head when he showed me the Kuni Kawachi and Flower Travelling Band album â a grail Iâd passed up in well-priced if vg-minus condition in the Shinjuku Disc Union in 2008. While that disc wasnât for sale, my reaction to it made him pull out the awesome hard rock of Jimmy and Hiroâs Strawberry Path, which did have a price on it. High, sure, but it broke the ice. That led to him pulling out a record by Sydneyâs Blackfeather â not because, like Jimmy and Hiroâs release, it was killer hard rock â but because it had a similar break. Luckily for the two of us, even through my sleepless haze, âMangoâs Theme Pt. 2â knocked my socks off with its opening drum, bass and string-section volley. I knew we were on convergent paths.\n\nTerry Britten âBargain Dayâ\n\n(Columbia Australia, circa 1969)\n\nI purposefully booked an extra day in Melbourne with digging in mind. After making sure Madlib and J.Rocc got to their crack-of-dawn flight back home on a foggy Monday morning, I pored over the local recommendations that DJ Sheep had given me and focused on a series of stores that I wanted to hit. Melbourneâs stores have great, colorful names. Vicious Sloth and Licorice Pie were both calling, but Slothâs Glen Terry â whose wares came highly recommended by Los Angelesâ arbiter of fine records, Geoffrey Weiss, who had just bought a collection of insanely obscure Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysian oddities from him â was out of town. So Licorice Pie it was. I was content knowing that owner Dave Reitman was already pulling a series of records for me to consider.\n\nAmidst a well-stocked store brimming-over with finds from a recent trip to Japan, â70s European jazz and, of course, a variety of the great Aussie music that I was after, Terry Brittenâs solitary 45 stood out. âBargain Dayâ is one hell of a thing, a banging platter of heavy beats that manages the difficult feat of making a song about the âcoming of the lordâ sound less like preachy Xian mumblings and more like the skull smashing exercise in the pain sinners will feel lest they take advantage of the big manâs âbargain dayâ and make recompense. But even if you ignore the message in Brittenâs phased vocals, the music itself is compelling: equal parts progressive pop and heavy, psych-influenced freakbeat.\n\nRob Thomsett âBaiameâ\n\n(Kubernete, 1975)\n\nIâll be honest and admit that Iâd never heard of this record before seeing its incredible â even from a fair distance â textured, fragile, minimalist sleeve over Daveâs shoulder at Licorice Pie. The price tag, backed by a couple more zeros than I would have preferred to see, demanded I ask for a listen and, when a lo-fi drum break set the pace for a spacey Mellotron lead on the first track, I was hooked.\n\nDave explained the genesis of this oddity, originally released in 1975 in an edition of one hundred or so copies on the Kubernete label from Canberra. It seemed too good to be true: a record that mixed the best of progressive rock, fusion jazz and mid-â70s psychedelia, recorded in a series of overdubs on a two-track reel-to-reel by a jazz guitarist equally enthralled with The Rolling Stones, The Meters and Jethro Tull. That would be the Rob Thomsett who, in an interview from 2011, recalled he was into âreally heavy progâ in the early â70s but soon âstarted crossing over into Bitches Brewâ-inspired jazz before he discovered the Aboriginal creation myth yaraandoo and decided to set the talesâ themes to music.\n\nAnd here sat the artifact, priced at a few more dollars more than I would have liked to pay, but within reach, and oh-so tantalizing. I heard something that reminded me of Marc Moulinâs Sam Suffy on one track, something that begged comparison to Portuguese progressive ensemble Quarteto 1111 on another. I just had to have it, and Iâm glad I made the sacrifice: this is a singular record which could have only been made in a sprawling continent like Australia, by an open-minded pioneer not scared of asking big, unanswerable â and almost certain to be unheard â questions via his progressive music."
