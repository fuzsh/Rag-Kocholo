With more than 2,900 universities and colleges worldwide granting credit to students who have earned passing marks on the AP exams, OA students are positioned to have an academic edge when they start their college careers.\n\nIn the 2022-23 school year, 68% of seniors and 82% of juniors enrolled in at least one AP course. These students' dedication and hard work resulted in exceptional scores in a range of subjects, showcasing the school's commitment to academic excellence and advanced learning.\n\nSpecifically, both AP art courses offered at Oldenburg Academy—AP 2-D Art and Design and AP Drawing—saw 100% of students earn a passing score. AP Spanish also achieved a 100% pass rate compared to the national rate of 84%. The two AP English courses, AP Literature and Composition and AP Language and Composition, exceeded state and national pass rates with 88% and 70% of students achieving a 3 or higher compared to 77% and 56% at the national level. The science department claimed an 88% pass rate in both AP Environmental Science and AP Biology, significantly higher than the national averages of 53% and 64%.
