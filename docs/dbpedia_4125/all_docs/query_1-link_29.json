The effort will be in conjunction with Empty Bowls, an internationally recognized grassroots movement run by artists around the world to care for and feed the hungry in their communities.\n\nOA art teacher Theresa Murphy is extremely grateful for the donation since it will be used by students in ceramics for years to come.\n\n“We look forward to working on fundraising activities with ceramic pieces created by next year’s students to benefit local charities in the Batesville area,” Murphy said.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Jason Walke has been honored with the Great Plains Communications 2024 Outstanding Teacher Award.\n\nThis award is in recognition of Mr. Walke’s dedication to providing students with real-world experiences and collaborative learning opportunities.\n\nHis commitment to collaboration is visible in many ways. The student media program gets regular advice from local media personalities, senior internship focuses on a wider variety of careers, and the business class competes in multiple state-wide competitions.\n\n“I appreciate and am humbled by the recognition. My focus as a teacher is to provide reality-based applications within my classroom and to help my students grow in the soft skills they need to be successful their future careers. It was an honor to be selected for this award,” said Walke.\n\n(Oldenburg Academy press release)"
