        "text": "(Oldenburg, IN) – Oldenburg Academy’s English and Social Studies Academic Teams earned third place at the academic state tournament held at Purdue University this month.\n\nMr. Justin Hartman, coach of the OA Academic Team, celebrated the team’s achievement: “The determination of our team certainly paid off. All year, students have been studying and preparing for this competition and it is so gratifying to have earned such a distinction.”\n\nAmong the standout students were sophomores Adam Dennis, Maddie Ryan, Bridgette Ehrhard, and senior Ellie Ryan, who made up the Social Studies Team, with Ellie Ryan serving as the captain. Additionally, the English Team, led by senior Lily Dennis, included sophomores Laura Dennis, Eleanor Eaglin, Sophia Hohenstein, and freshman Lydia Ehrhard.\n\nSenior Lily Dennis reflected on her experience: “We were determined to come back stronger after missing the cutoff in 2023. This year, our hard work paid off as we not only made it to the finals, but also proudly secured third place.”\n\nSenior Ellie Ryan echoed these sentiments, saying “It was so rewarding so see our efforts come to fruition.”\n\nIn recognition of their performance, Oldenburg Academy was also recently designated as one of the top 10 Indiana Academic Super Bowl teams for 2024. This recognition is based on the cumulative score of the five subject rounds at area competitions. It is the second consecutive year that OA has received this honor.\n\nPrincipal Angela Parmer congratulated the students and Mr. Hartman, stating, “The success of our Academic Team reflects the strength of academics here at OA. We are delighted by these\n\naccomplishments and look forward to next year’s competitions.”\n\n(Oldenburg Academy press release)"
