        "text": "Our beautiful and historic campus is a place like no other. It is a place where students feel supported and encouraged to go beyond what is expected. A place that challenges students to be critical thinkers, diligent learners, and effective communicators. A place where students are inspired to be intentional discerners, global ambassadors, and community supporters. A place where students are prepared for the next step in their journey...wherever that might lead them.\n\nWe are here to help you and your family every step of the way.\n\nAny 8th grade student interested in learning more about Oldenburg Academy is invited to come for a 'shadow day' visit on a Twister Tuesday during the school year. Visiting students will be partnered with an OA student who will serve as their host during their visit to campus. Visiting students will attend classes, meet teachers and students, and see first-hand how they can Go Beyond at OA!.\n\nVisiting students will begin their visit in the main lobby at 8:30 AM and will conclude at 1:30 PM. Lunch will be provided in the Twister Cafe.\n\nCall the Admissions Office at 812-934-4440 ext. 250 to schedule your visit for one of the following days.\n\nAugust 20th & 27th\n\nSeptember 3rd, 10th, 17th, & 24th\n\nOctober 1st, 15th, 22nd, & 29th\n\nNovember 5th, 12th, 19th, & 26th\n\nDecember 10th & 17th\n\nWednesday Walk-Through\n\nWhen | August 21; September 4 & 18; October 2 & 30; November 13\n\nTime | 8:30 - 10:30 AM\n\nWhere | Main Academic Building\n\nParents of 7th and 8th grade students are invited to spend a morning at Oldenburg Academy. During the Wednesday Walk-Through, parents will hear a brief presentation from a member of our Administrative team, take a tour of the school while it is in session, and ask any questions about the high school experience at OA.\n\nWe will meet at the entrance to the Main Academic Building promptly at 9:00 AM with a 45 minute presentation followed by a 45 minute tour of the school. The morning will conclude at approximately 10:30 AM.\n\nParking will be available along the circle drive in front of the school as well as at the Feldhaus.\n\nTo reserve your spot for one of our upcoming Wednesday Walk-Throughs, please click HERE to be redirected to a page with a button to make your reservation.\n\nAll of us at OA believe that we are indeed the best choice for what matters most – your children. We believe we have the perfect recipe for success: a rigorous and diversified curriculum, an extraordinary faculty and staff, this amazing collegiate style campus, and multi-faceted co-curricular, athletic and fine arts programs. Plus – and most importantly – we offer this premier educational experience in a vibrant, faith-filled environment where your sons and daughters become equipped with the values and beliefs so essential in this complex and often confusing world.\n\nOur mission and vision statement focuses and frames all that we do at OA. You will notice that at its core are our Franciscan sponsorship values: prayer, care of creation, dignity of the individual, justice/peace, and reconciliation/conversion. We choose one of these values to focus on every year and integrate into our classes and school culture.\n\nThe outward movement of these values generates the key attributes of our mission statement that direct who we want our graduates to become – a sort of “grad at grad” statement: men and women who are exemplars of Academic Excellence, Social Responsibility, Leadership, Personal and Spiritual Growth. Under each of these you see some specific descriptions of what that actually means in day-to-day life. (effective communicator, a global ambassador, a critical thinker, etc.)\n\nBut this infographic can be a bit overwhelming at first glance. We like to chunk it into 3 themes: FAITH, FUTURE, and FAMILY that we believe will help you answer the question “Why I will choose to send my son or daughter to OA”.\n\nHere is a high-level overview, a trailer of sorts, for each theme.\n\nWednesday Morning Prayer: ALL are welcome to join us in the old gym (or in front of school if weather permits) each Wednesday morning from 7:45-7:55 am. This is in addition to new daily opportunity to pray the Liturgy of the Hours in the ICA oratory each morning. Let's pray, OA!\n\nAdvent Confessions:\n\nstudents will have the opportunity to go to confession during religion class.\n\nAdvent Prayer services:\n\nAll-school Advent prayer service is held during REACH each Monday of Advent.\n\nOn December 8 is the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception and our namesake “Feast Day” commemorating the date that the Sisters Chapel was first opened in 1890 but also the recognition that the Academy has always been consecrated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and blessed under her protection and guidance.\n\nAs a school community we will commemorate this special day together by celebrating Mass at 2:00 at Holy Family. Freshmen will receive a “miraculous medal” during Mass as well. This has been a tradition for all students new to the Academy for several years.\n\nArchdiocesan Senior Mass:\n\nThe Senior Class traveled to Brownsburg to St. Malachy to celebrate Mass with their Senior Classmates from throughout the Archdiocese. Archbishop Thompson celebrated the Mass and shared about how life is full of 'Mountain' and 'Valley' moments. Senior year is one of those \"Mountain Moments\". It is a big deal. Archbishop Thompson also told the Seniors that they are the leaders of all schools. More than anything any school leader or teacher could do, the senior class sets the climate of the school.\n\nInformation about 2 future opportunities for our students to grow in their faith:\n\nIndy March for Life\n\nSummer High School Youth Conference:\n\nIf your son or daughter is your oldest child, you may already be shaking your head at how quickly you got to this moment – choosing a high school for your baby! Those of you with older children are nodding your heads saying – hold on to your hats – it only speeds up from here!\n\nOA is dedicated to offering our students a rigorous, diverse, and dynamic college preparatory curriculum. Even though you may be uncertain at this moment whether a 2 or 4-year college is your child’s next step after high school, we can assure you that the content and skills developed and reinforced here are essential for future success whatever the next step in their journeys.\n\nSpecific strengths we bring to the table for this are\n\nSmall class size\n\nPersonal attention and mentoring\n\nA 4-year College to Career readiness program\n\nGifted, engaged, qualified teachers"
