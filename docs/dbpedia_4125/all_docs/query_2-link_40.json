        "text": "As part of OA’s commitment to deepening our students’ experience and understanding of Franciscan charism and values, several Seniors are selected each year to join students from Roger Bacon High School in Cincinnati on the Assisi Scholars pilgrimage, a pilgrimage to Rome and Assisi led by the Franciscan Pilgrimage Program. This transformative opportunity has enriched the spiritual journey of many students and faculty chaperones as they walk and pray in the footsteps of St. Francis and St. Clare.\n\nOA has partnered with this bridge-building organization from Guatemala for several years. In order to participate in the Faces Program, Guatemalan students apply to be Cultural Ambassadors of their country. They go through a preparation process during the year and also prepare cultural projects to share with their host family and school.\n\nOA students then become a Host Family for one of these students for 8 weeks, usually October through December. During the summer, OA students then have the potential to visit Guatemala for a language or cultural immersion experience of their own. The program has led to wonderful friendships and has provided our students and guests with valuable cultural experiences.\n\nOldenburg Academy has partnered with The Cambridge Network for their international program. Cambridge Network is a \"Boston-based educational consulting firm committed to increasing international participation in American education, broadening its diversity, and strengthening the ability of institutions to educate students of different backgrounds and foster meaningful cultural exchanges.\"\n\nThe Cambridge Network’s international student program prepares students for life abroad prior to arriving at the school and continues to provide international students with on-going support throughout the school year. International students coming from China, Korea, and Vietnam must work with The Cambridge Network to apply to Oldenburg Academy.\n\nBecome a Host Family:\n\nExpand the horizons of your family by hosting an international student. Living with a student from another culture provides the opportunity to come to know and share diverse experiences that will enrich your family's life forever."
