        "text": "As a non-public school, Oldenburg Academy relies primarily on tuition to cover the cost of a quality, Catholic secondary education, but tuition is responsible for supporting only 70% of our operating budget. The remaining funds must be generated through the industrious efforts of our Advancement staff and the generosity of donors and benefactors.\n\nWe are grateful for the support we receive from so many individuals, businesses and organizations. Special events such as our annual Dinner Auction (formerly Reverse Raffle) and the annual Cash Raffle are mainstays of this support. The popular “Lucky Buck” raffle in the fall provides students an opportunity to pitch in. OASIS is tenacious and creative in their efforts to raise funds for OA’s athletic programs and the profits from our Twice Blessed retail store have generated funds for student tuition assistance since 2006. However, our most important fund raising vehicle is the Academy Fund, our annual outreach to alumni, parents, friends, and community members.\n\nWe are also the grateful beneficiary of named scholarships, bequests, and memorial gifts. Teachers and administrators seek grants from regional community foundations and businesses. It would be impossible to quantify the donation of volunteer hours without which none of these activities could occur.\n\nWe hope you too are inspired by this ‘grace in giving’ and find it a source of pride for the entire OA community. God bless you for all YOU have given. Your support is essential for OA to continue our mission of academic excellence, social responsibility, leadership and personal growth for our students who will excel in our ever-changing world.\n\nThank you for partnering with us. We are so very grateful.\n\nTuition allows us to do what we are asked to do – educate our students. OA’s Annual Campaign for Giving titled the Academy Fund, allows us to do what we aspire to do – continue to enhance the educational experience by providing resources to more fully integrate best practices and innovative opportunities identified through our continuous improvement model. Also, you have the opportunity to identify specific programs that you are passionate about supporting and direct your gift to those areas.\n\nOldenburg Academy has never been in a stronger position to provide the highest quality, faith-based secondary education to our students. Our society has never been more in need of our graduates: women and men of exceptional character, exemplary skills, and dedicated service. Your gift to the Academy Fund will enable us to continue this tradition that has been a hallmark of excellence and a source of inspiration for generations. Please make the decision today to partner with us. The need is great and no gift is too small."
