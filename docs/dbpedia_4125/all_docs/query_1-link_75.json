        "text": "Welcome to the Oldenburg Academy School Counseling Department.\n\nAs the Director of the School Counseling office at Oldenburg Academy, I am committed to helping students reach their full scholastic and personal potential. The small size of Oldenburg Academy gives me the unique opportunity to get to know each student individually and to provide the appropriate services such as scheduling academic planning, standardized testing, college application guidance, and scholarship services. The services offered by the school counseling department are many and diverse, but my foremost endeavor is to be available for students and parents.\n\nContact me with questions, concerns, or to simply keep in touch.\n\nIt has long been established that the education of the whole child is essential for schools to properly fulfill their mission. This includes addressing students’ academic, social emotional, and physical health needs. Evidenced based practices have been shown to be highly effective when a multi-tiered support system is implemented. Oldenburg Academy employs a professional, experienced team to support our students through this multi-tiered approach. In addition to the Director of School Counseling, members of this team include:\n\nLearning Services Support\n\nSchool Nurse\n\nLearning Services Support\n\nAs a college preparatory school, OA’s mission calls us to provide a variety for support services that enable each student to reach their maximum academic potential. Accommodation plans (CSP’s, 504’s, etc.) provide support that allows students with disabilities to achieve the same instructional goals as all students. These plans do not change the expectations but instead offer the resources, structure, and guidance needed for success. Some students require a designated SRT time each day for these services to be provided. A highly qualified professional facilitates this class period as well as monitoring each student’s growth and collaborating with the other professionals for the student’s annual accommodation plan review.\n\nSchool Nurse\n\nSchool nurses play an important role in the health of students and can provide them with daily and emergency health care support during the school day. This can help students avoid unnecessary absences and reach their full academic potential. Our school nurse supports student success by providing health care through assessment, intervention, and follow-up for all students when at OA. This includes managing health records and any at school medications, administering required state health testing, managing our school’s response to larger health issues such as COVID-19 protocols, and communicating with parents, teachers and administrators to provide a unified and cohesive support system. OA’s nurse is on campus most mornings with her office located across from the student lounge.\n\n2. Apply\n\nApply to the school(s) of your choice through the school’s website or via the Common Application. Once you have submitted your application electronically, complete a transcript request through www.parchment.com, a Secondary School Report, and a letter of recommendation if needed.\n\nIf you need letters of recommendation, you may request those from teachers, coaches, counselors, or other community members of your choice by completing a Teacher Recommendation Questionnaire. Remember to give recommenders at least two week’s notice in order to complete a thorough letter of recommendation. Letters of recommendation should be submitted to the Guidance Office so that all application materials are submitted together."
