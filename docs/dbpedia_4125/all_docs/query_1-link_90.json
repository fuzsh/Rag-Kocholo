        "text": "30 years ago\n\nAugust 5, 1994\n\nA wildfire in the area of the gypsum cliffs just east of the Beaver Creek Resort entrance, and southwest of the Eagle-Vail subdivision, burned for about five hours overnight, the Vail Trail reported.\n\n“On arrival, firefighters observed flames in excess of 10 feet high burning near lodgepole pine,” the Trail reported. “The area of the fire was inaccessible to vehicles, so firefighters responded on foot along a trail to the area. Due to darkness rapidly approaching, the use of a helicopter for transporting firefighters was ruled out.”\n\nFirefighters arrived to find one and a half acres of sage and serviceberry vegetation burning on private property, the Trail reported. The fire was contained at about 1:15 a.m. the next morning.\n\n“Juveniles at the scene admitted to starting the fire while playing with a model rocket,” the Trail reported.\n\nAvon fire chief Charlie Moore said luck was on the side of firefighters, who were fortunate to not have any wind at the time the fire started.\n\n“It could have easily spread to the tall timber and burned along the south ridge next to the Eagle-Vail subdivision,” said Avon Fire Chief Charlie Moore. “Had that been the case, this would have been a very severe fire.”\n\n40 years ago\n\nAugust 10, 1984\n\nSculptor Claes Oldenburg withdrew his proposal to create a 60-foot tall sculpture of a fishing pole in Vail, the Vail Trail reported.\n\n“In a letter written by Oldenburg’s attorney July 24, New York lawyer Stanford Schewel said the ‘proper climate for a major work ‘does not exist in Vail at this time,'” the Trail reported.\n\nThe pole was to be attached by a fishing line-cable to a tin can the size of a 50-gallon drum in Gore Creek, and was “resented by some who felt Oldenburg was poking fun at the resort,” the Trail reported.\n\nThe sculpture would have been located on Vail Associates’ land. Vail Associates President Harry Frampton issued a statement saying while the company was not the leading advocate of the sculpture, it felt “from a corporate standpoint and from a community standpoint, having an artist of his stature would be in the best overall interests of the community.”\n\n“We understood why certain people in town opposed it, and certainly there was the position that a lot of people were concerned about the environmental issue,” Frampton said. “I also understand why Mr. Oldenburg withdrew. He has a lot of opportunities to place sculptures around the country, and we pushed him past his hassle point. And we hope this will not discourage future artists from considering Vail.”\n\n50 years ago\n\nAugust 9, 1974\n\nAn informal agreement was reached by the Vail Town Council to rename Vorlaufer Park in memory of Roger Staub, a former Olympian and one of Vail’s first ski school directors.\n\n“On his 38th birthday, June 30, 1974. Staub was killed when his hang-glider fell from a height of over 600 ft. in Verbier, Switzerland, his mother country,” the Vail Trail reported. “Appropriately enough, Staub once lived in the Vorlaufer Condominiums in Vail Village. The park which will soon carry his name is adjacent to the Vorlaufer Building.”\n\n145 years ago\n\nJuly 25, 1879\n\nRed Cliff was named after the quartzite cliffs, stained dark red by the hematite iron present in the rock surrounding the town.\n\nWant the news to come to you?

Until July 25, 1879, the settlement was either nameless or known as Battle Mountain. On that day, the inhabitants officially christened the town Red Cliff.”"
