        "text": "Nothing happens in and of itself. As an independent private Catholic high school, Oldenburg Academy is certainly no exception to this tried and true axiom; we often rely on the generosity of others (their time, their talent, their treasure) to maintain and live up to our reputation as one of the most distinguished schools in the state. Many of our resources are graciously donated by citizens and students that span far beyond our walls and normal operating hours. Their personal gifts of service truly hold a boundless value and are greatly appreciated by the OA community.\n\nFor those of you who are not close to the campus and are unable to volunteer your time, one of the greatest ways that you can give is your gift of prayers. We ask that you remember the Academy in your daily conversations with God asking for wisdom, direction and blessings for each of the students, their families, our faculty and staff.\n\nTop 20 Twister To-Do List\n\nSo many times people think they can’t give or donate to OA if they aren’t contributing a monetary donation. We beg to differ! We are blessed everyday with gifts of time and talent that make a difference here at the Academy. Below is the Top 20 Twister To-Do List. How many can you check off?"
