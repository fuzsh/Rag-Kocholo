        "text": "Oldenburg Academy wants every student to have the opportunity to attend our school, and we also recognize the additional financial challenges that families accept in choosing a private school education.\n\nThrough its tuition assistance program, grants, and scholarships given by private donors, Oldenburg Academy supplements a portion of the total financial need for many students. Over 82% of our students utilize our affordability options and receive financial assistance, scholarships, and/or discounts.\n\nMonthly Tuition Payments\n\nParents who choose the monthly payment plan for student tuition must set this up through FACTS Management Company. You may set up automatic payments with your credit card, checking account, or savings account. Parents who used this service the previous school year will be automatically re-enrolled.\n\nCreate a new FACTS tuition payment account for the next school year.\n\nTo be considered for tuition assistance parents must complete a Tuition Assistance Application. An independent company, FACTS Grant & Aid Assessment, processes the application and makes a recommendation of family need to Oldenburg Academy. Apply online at FACTS.\n\nApplications must be submitted no later than March 1. Tuition assistance awards will be made in April.\n\nIndiana Choice Scholarship Program\n\nThe Choice Scholarship (voucher) Program was established in 2011 to provide every Indiana student access to the school that best meets their learning needs. The Choice Scholarship provides qualified students financial aid to help pay tuition at a non-public school of their choice.\n\nIf the student or a sibling currently have an SGO or a state voucher, or are enrolled in a public school, and the student’s family meets the income guidelines, the student may be eligible for a state voucher. For more information go to the Indiana Choice Scholarship website.\n\nEstimated voucher amounts range from $5,900 to $6,300 based on the public school districts in our area.\n\nHow to qualify for a Choice Scholarship:\n\nStep 1: Be a resident of Indiana\n\nStep 2: Meet Family Income Requirements | Eligibility is based on the adjusted gross income of all members of the household. If a family’s adjusted gross income falls at or below the income level listed for their household size, their student would qualify for the Choice Scholarship Program.\n\nTo apply for a Choice Scholarship from Oldenburg Academy:\n\nComplete the Choice Scholarship Application form by clicking the ‘Apply Now!’ button below.\n\nSubmit a copy of the first 2 pages of your most recent tax return to the finance (gkuntz@oldenburgacademy.org) or front office (sgigrich@oldenburgacademy.org.\n\nCurrent Student Scholarship Opportunites\n\nA variety of scholarships are available for current Oldenburg Academy students to continue their OA education. Some awards are needs-based; some are based upon service, leadership or a specific skill or interest. Scholarship applications, criteria, and due dates are available online and through the Guidance Office.\n\nNote: Most of these scholarship applications have not been updated for the 2024-2025 school year yet. Students will be notified when the scholarship applications have been updated and are available to apply.\n\nMulti-Student Grant\n\nA $500 tuition discount may be available for each child of families with more than one child attending Oldenburg Academy during the same school year. There are income guidelines to qualify that are based upon the submission of a copy of your Federal Income Tax Form 1040. If you would like to be considered for this discount, please contact Geraldine Kuntz in the Finance Office. If a student is eligible for a voucher or SGO, he/she will automatically be granted the discount."
