(Feb. 19, 2024) “Oldenburg Academy has announced the success of its recent fundraising efforts during Catholic Schools Week. The OA community collected funds to contribute to the construction of 52 single-dwelling homes in the village of Cucuyagua, Honduras… “It is always delightful to witness the spirit of giving within our OA community as we endeavor to be Christ to others,” Gregg said. “As St. Francis reminded us, ‘It is in giving that we receive.’ We are blessed to be part of this Honduras project, which is in coalition with St. Mary’s and Food for the Poor.”\n\nTo read the full article, click here.\n\nHelp Avert a Humanitarian Crisis\n\nHaiti Needs Urgent Assistance\n\nIn recent days, a surge of violence in Haiti has forced at least 360,000 people out of their homes. Food For The Poor’s distribution centers need more resources to serve the 4 million people who are now facing acute food insecurity. Help us restock and ship more containers to respond to the immediate crisis and prepare the recovery efforts to help internally displaced families return home.\n\nTake Action Now"
