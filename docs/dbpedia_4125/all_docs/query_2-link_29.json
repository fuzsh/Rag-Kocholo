        "text": "2024-2025 Student Handbook\n\nThe Oldenburg Academy Student Handbook outlines your responsibilities as a member of the Oldenburg Academy community. As students, we expect you to be your best. Our campus ministry motto is “Be Christ to others, and let others be Christ to you.” This is your responsibility throughout your time at Oldenburg Academy.\n\nThis student handbook provides guidance that will help you achieve academic success, spiritual growth and personal responsibility. Understanding the Mission Statement, Guiding Principles, academic structure, service program, dress code, and conduct codes are critical in achieving excellence as a student.\n\nIndiana College Core\n\nDo you want to get a head start on college? The Indiana College Core allows high school students to earn 30 general education credits that can be transferred as a block to any public college or university in Indiana, as well as some private institutions. In other words, students who earn the College Core in high school may already be finished with their first year of college at a fraction of the cost. To learn more about the Indiana College Core and put together your plan, use My College Core (mycollegecore.org) and work closely with your school counselor.\n\nWhat is FAFSA?\n\nThe Free Application For Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the most important document for determining if you’re eligible for financial aid — money to help you pay for education and training beyond high school. The easiest way to file the FAFSA is online at FAFSA.gov.\n\nAfter you file your FAFSA, your college will be able to tell you which scholarships and grants you could receive as well as how much money you can borrow in federal loans. To find out more about the FAFSA, including what kinds of state financial aid is available, check out Learn More Indiana’s FAFSA guide for Hoosiers.\n\nContact Learn More Indiana and get connected with specialists who can answer your questions.\n\n3. Post-Secondary Ready Competencies\n\nStudents must complete one of the following:\n\n• Honors Diploma: Fulfill all requirements of either the Academic or Technical Honors diploma;\n\n• ACT: College-ready benchmarks;\n\n• SAT: College-ready benchmarks;\n\n• ASVAB: Earn at least a minimum AFQT score to qualify for placement into one of the branches of the US military and commit to enlist\n\n• State- and Industry-recognized Credential or Certification;\n\n• Federally-recognized Apprenticeship;\n\n• Career-Technical Education Concentrator4: Must earn a C average in at least two non-duplicative advanced courses (courses beyond an introductory course) within a particular program or program of study;\n\n• AP/IB/Dual Credit/Cambridge International courses5 or CLEP Exams: Must earn a C average or higher in at least three courses;\n\n• Locally created pathway that meets the framework from and earns the approval of the State Board of Education"
