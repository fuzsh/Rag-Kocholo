        "text": "Movie history is full of monsters—and I don’t mean the bloodthirsty Franken-gorgons of our genre fantasies, though the monsters in question are also, in their own way, fantasies.\n\nThey’re the people we’ve deemed monsters, also known as freaks, geeks, outsiders, others. Among them: the titular trouble-makers of Tod Browning’s classic 1932 movie Freaks, who were played by real-life carnival performers, some with real disabilities. Or even the “munchkins” of Munchkinland, who were beloved and remembered for their work on The Wizard of Oz yet plagued, in their everyday lives, by the era’s Draconian treatments for dwarfism, and by rumors that there’d been on-set orgies and the like. Tucked beneath the surface of the public’s fawning adoration for the Lollipop Guild was the sense that these people were inherently different, somewhat like animals—that they were “the most deformed, unpleasant bunch of adults imaginable,” as the historian Hugh Fordin once put it.\n\nChained for Life—the second feature written and directed by Aaron Schimberg, which is currently playing in New York and Los Angeles and expanding around the country—is a playful, darkly funny counterpoint to this painful history, in ways smarter and more fluid than at first seem possible. It is, on its face, that somewhat dreaded thing: a movie about movies. But in this case the movie in question is a fussy European director’s first English-language film, a beautified piece of exploitation with a gracelessly stupid plot about a blind woman and the facially disfigured man she falls in love with: Beauty and the Beast by way of wartime mystery.\n\nAn easy project to make fun of, in other words, particularly from the distance afforded by Chained for Life, which has fun with the fictional movie’s heavy German accents and vain actors. That the director onscreen (played by Charlie Korsmo) goes by Herr Director is no small incident. But even this feels, at first, like a joke about his self-seriousness, rather than like the portentously suggestive bit of context that it is. Chained for Life dwells on, even laps up, the bad dialogue and awkward horror of it all—those moments when the disfigured “beast” of a movie such as Herr Director's dramatically emerges from the shadows. And when the blind lover testifies to being able to see the disfigured man’s inner beauty, the moment sings with hilarious irony.\n\nAnd we are encouraged to laugh—particularly at ourselves. These are lines you’ve no doubt heard before, scenes you’ve no doubt seen—willingly watched! And paid for. Which is precisely what allows Schimberg to poke fun at our expectations. Chained for Life focuses on the actress Mabel (Jess Weixler), who’s playing the blind woman in Herr Director’s movie despite, as you might have guessed, not being blind. Funny, though, how the lies and cinematic fictions of a movie stack up. Sure, Mabel isn’t blind—but then neither is she blonde, like her character, nor German. You can imagine a conversation in which someone equates these things as similarly injurious or, more likely, not injurious at all—and in fact, early on, thinking she’s being sympathetic, Mabel practically does the same. It’s all acting, right?\n\nThat’s a much harder question to answer if a blind person is the one doing the asking—which is exactly what it feels like to be in the hands of Schimberg, who was born with a bilateral cleft lip and palate, and who’s said that disfigurement has been a part of every script he’s written to date, because “to not write about it feels more unnatural than grappling with it.” Grappling, in this case, is what Mabel seems to be doing over the course of the film, almost as if she’s hearing and seeing herself for the first time—hearing her own inconsistencies of logic as she realizes that playing a blind woman doesn’t quite count as “representation” for the blind, for example, and reacting to this realization internally, in real time after floating that dubious idea aloud.\n\nGrappling is also what happens when Schimberg throws the movie off its axis with a literal bus-load of freaks: conjoined sisters, a woman covered in burns, a bearded lady, all of them shipped to Herr Director's movie set at the same time, like a circus caravan, and all of them there to get propped up in his film as the real gremlins, the touches of authenticity that make Mabel's heroine’s plight feel both believable and exceptional. Chief among them is Rosenthal (Adam Pearson), whose face is severely disfigured, and who plays Mabel’s romantic interest—the ostensible beast to her beauty.\n\nAlready, though, Schimberg is poised to trouble our assumptions—assumptions drawn, no doubt, from a history of watching movies not unlike the one Herr Director is making. Rosenthal plays a man whose disfigurement has rendered him hopeless, but Rosenthal himself is chipper, cheeky, self-aware. The conversations he has with Mabel about acting, among other things, are more than merely humanizing. They’re boldly funny, disarmingly intelligent studies of liberal goodwill—moments that expose the presumptions about beauty that the rest of us, ever eager to pity a wretch, take for granted.\n\nIn one stunning scene, Mabel offers to give Rosenthal acting lessons—he’s struggling to memorize his lines—and the moment morphs into close-ups on Mabel’s face, then Rosenthal’s, as Mabel demonstrates how to perform emotions. She relies on her primary instrument: her face. And in the jagged, critical moments in which we alternate between looking at his face and then back hers, the movie explodes with questions—more questions, problems, and ideas than you can possibly keep track of, which arise organically and crowd your mind. Questions about the visual language of movies, and close-ups, and what it means to see Mabel and Rosenthal’s faces on similar visual planes, confronting us as equals; questions about why we so rarely see disfigurement in the daylight, up close, as we do here. Questions about beauty and acting, movie romances, and the oddly pointed choices filmmakers make when showing us who we are—if they show people like us at all.\n\nIt’s impossible to watch what happens in Chained for Life from then on without these questions clinging to your mind and coloring everything else you see, making you wonder, even, whether the people onscreen are considering the same, and if so, what are they going to do about it? I love the way Schimberg nimbly maneuvers this ideological thicket of his own making, dredging up the quiet perversities of his audience. He hits us with the things many of us are too polite to ask aloud, our unspoken curiosities about the sex lives of men like Rosenthal, for example, whose disfigurement would, so far as many of us know—because we’re too afraid to ask—seem to be an impediment in a relatively vain society. And might there be something to the fact that Herr Director’s movie about German doctors has cast a man named Rosenthal to be its freak of the hour?\n\nThe superb Weixler—whose breakout was in the 2007 movie Teeth, about a girl with a mythical vagina dentata, and whose presence can’t help but feel like an incredibly apt bit of joke casting, accordingly—more than avails herself to the double duties of actor and “actor,” playing two roles onscreen that continually merge into each other. And Pearson is her match. The actor is best known for his role as one of alien Scarlett Johansson’s victims in Under the Skin, a sequence which, not unlike Schimberg’s film, teeters along and teases out the complications of empathy.\n\nPearson was born with neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder characterized by tumors that form along the body’s nerve tissue. An unexpected but moving consequence of watching Chained for Life, however, is that this suddenly feels like a strange thing to point out about an actor—an uneasy mix of journalistic fact, like noting someone’s race or gender, and implicit disclaimer: sorry about the face. It’s the problem Schimberg seems to have in mind when he opens his film with a provocatively apt quote from the late critic Pauline Kael, who in her famously positive review of Bonnie and Clyde wrote: “Actors and actresses are usually more beautiful than ordinary people. And why not? . . . Why should we be deprived of the pleasure of beauty?” Then the real kicker: “It is a supreme asset for actors and actresses to be beautiful; it gives them greater range and greater possibilities for expressiveness.”\n\nChained for Life rebukes this idea, but not before playing with it, satirizing it, tossing it to and fro and making us really sit back and consider the full extent of its stunning implications. The movie’s lack of apology for the disfigured people at its center is noble, doubly so for being so genuine and rare. But Schimberg is too smart for the movie’s politics to be simply a matter of nobility. Chained for Life’s genius is in its playfulness, and in Schimberg’s vision, lucid but disorienting, insistent that there be no boundary between the movie we’re watching and the movie—movies?—his characters are making. Which means there’s no distance between us and the material—minimizing the excuses not to see it for what it is, or, for that matter, the people therein for who they are.\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— Our cover story: Lupita Nyong’o on Us, Black Panther, and much more\n\n— Five appalling stories from the set of The Wizard of Oz\n\n— Hugh Grant’s very English comeback\n\n— How’s Joker?
