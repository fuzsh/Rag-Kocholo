        "text": "Girls in physics. Boys in English. Some A-Level subjects seem to be perennially less popular with one gender than the other.[1]\n\nIn this post, we’ll use data from JCQ to take a look at the gender balance across all A-Level subjects this year. We’ll go on to explore how it’s changed over the last five years, focusing on subjects preferred by both male and female students.\n\nThe most popular A-Level subjects\n\nIt’s not exactly news that the most popular subjects for male students are very different to the most popular subjects for female students. But it does still surprise me to see just how different they are.\n\nSTEM subjects feature very strongly on the list for male students. While biology, maths and chemistry are popular with female students too, physics and computer science are much less so. The arts – notably English literature and art & design – are much more popular with female students than male, as are psychology and sociology. Male students are far more likely to opt for economics if selecting a social science.\n\nGender balance in 2021\n\nThe chart below shows the gender balance in all A-Level subjects this year.[2] Bear in mind that more female than male students sit A-Levels. In 2021, the overall cohort of A-Level students was 55% female. This is indicated on the chart below as a dotted line.\n\nMedia / film / TV studies, history and chemistry were all nearly exactly the same as the overall A-Level cohort in terms of gender balance, at 56%, 56% and 54% female respectively.\n\nArts subjects, English and the social sciences (excluding economics) were all disproportionately female. A-Levels in performing / expressive arts were the least diverse in terms of gender; 94% of students were female, although this is a subject with a very small number of entries overall – just 1,152 in 2021.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, the subjects preferred by male students tended to be those in STEM (and economics). The most disproportionately male subject, by quite some distance, was computer science at 85% male.\n\nIt’s worth noting that not all STEM subjects were disproportionately male. Biology leant the other way, with 64% female students, and chemistry was almost exactly the same as the overall population of A-Level students at 54% female.\n\nHas gender balance improved?\n\nGenerally speaking, the subjects that were disproportionately male or female five years ago remain so now. But while there have been no dramatic reversals, there have been some smaller changes.\n\nThe chart below can be used to explore how gender balance has changed over the last five years in every A-Level subject.[3]\n\nChanges in disproportionately male subjects\n\nThe biggest change is in design and technology. This is a subject in which entries have been in long term decline – down from 10,657 in 2017 to 8,343 this year – but female students were more likely to turn away from the subject than male students. In 2017, 39% of D&T students were female; this year, it was just 30%.\n\nComputer science has seen a shift in the opposite direction. While it still has a very high proportion of male students, it is lower now than in 2017. The proportion of female students has increased from just 9% in 2017 to 15% this year.\n\nOf the other subjects with a very high proportion of male students, physics and further maths have seen small increases in the proportion of female students since 2017 – from 21 to 23% in physics and from 27 to 29% in further maths – while economics has remained steady at 31%.\n\nChemistry was somewhat gender imbalanced in 2017, with 51% female students compared to 55% of the overall A-Level population. The proportion of female students has crept up every year since then and is now virtually the same as that of the overall A-Level cohort (54% compared to 55%).\n\nChanges in disproportionately female subjects\n\nThere were no shifts in these subjects as large as those seen for design and technology and computer science.\n\nHowever, the proportion of female students amongst those taking A-Levels in performing / expressive arts and English literature has increased since 2017, from 91 to 94% in performing / expressive arts and 75 to 77% in English literature. Both of these subjects have also seen a fall in entries over the same period.\n\nArt and design has become slightly less disproportionately female over the last five years, falling from 76% female in 2017 to 74% this year. Psychology and sociology have both seen increased entries from both male and female students since 2017, but particularly from males, with the proportion of female students falling from 75 to 74% in psychology and 77 to 76% in sociology.\n\nFinally, a brief mention of languages. Apart from ‘other modern languages’ – in which the proportion of female students has fallen slightly from 58% in 2017 to 57% this year – all A-Levels in languages have seen increases in their proportion of female students over the last five years. Spanish, for example, has increased from 66 to 70% female.\n\nIn summary\n\nGender differences in A-Level subject choice are not going away.\n\nMany subjects are chosen much more often by one gender than the other. While some – notably computer science and chemistry – have become more gender balanced over the last five years, others have become less so.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are some promising indications for gender balance in STEM subjects. Although some subjects still have a very low percentage of girls, it does seem to be slowly increasing.\n\nBut perhaps there’s more to be done in subjects such as English, design and technology and modern foreign languages."
