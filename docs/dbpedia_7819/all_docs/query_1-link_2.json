        "text": "Yue-Qing Yang\n\nYue-Qing Yang is a Chinese Canadian filmmaker dedicated to uncovering and telling the stories of Chinese women. Not one to go over familiar ground, Ms. Yang has accomplished, and continues to do, pioneering work. Her recently completed NU SHU – A HIDDEN LANGUAGE OF WOMEN IN CHINA gives a compelling account of a little known and now nearly extinct system of writing invented and used exclusively by women.\n\nA graduate of the University of Alberta in Canada with a masters degree in Science, Yue-Qing was formerly a university instructor in China where she made her first documentary, THE CHINESE FOREST FROG. The film was broadcast on China’s Central TV Station and won the Hennong Honour Award in 1989. In 2004, FOOTBINDING – THE THREE INCH GOLDEN LOTUS, a documentary that she directed, wrote, and produced, was released. She currently works on future film projects in Vancouver, Canada. (09/09)"
