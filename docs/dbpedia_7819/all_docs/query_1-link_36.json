        "meta_description": "A list of 250 films compiled on Letterboxd, including City of God (2002), Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019), The Ascent (1977), Werckmeister Harmonies (2000) and Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975). About this list: Ranked by average user rating. The list was extracted thanks to here and here. This was not possible without the curation of these megalists. It will be updated monthly. An official list progress project on all-time stats pages for Pro and Patron users. See all films that have entered and read Ella Kemp's deep-dive into the list here! Expanded from a top 100 to a top 250 on September 26th, 2022, on the list's 3-year anniversary. ~~ ELIGIBILITY RULES: • This list counts female co-directors, even if uncredited. The developers are considering a design change so that they can be credited on the main page instead of just the crew tab. • Includes cis, transgender and female-identifying directors. Trans women are women, no examples necessary. • Films must be feature-length (45+ minutes), with a theatrical and/or festival release. • Documentaries of any kind, short films, theater/stage, TV movies, TV series or miniseries, and episodes are excluded. • There is a 1,000 minimum ratings threshold. –– NOTABLE INCLUSIONS: • The #1 on the list, City of God was co-directed by Kátia Lund. However, Lund was snubbed for the Academy Award while only Fernando Meirelles was nominated due to their rules about director teams. Meirelles and Lund worked together closely, directing the short Golden Gate in 2001 together as a test run for City of God. They then collaborated on the City of Men TV series adapted from City of God where she directed four episodes. • Werckmeister Harmonies and The Turin Horse were co-directed by Béla Tarr's wife and editor Ágnes Hranitzky. The credit developed because of the extent Hranitzky had to be on set to assist Tarr with the timings of his long takes in order to match other shots. She edited all his films since 1981 but the credit only began in 2000. I am not mistaking Béla to be a woman. • Slumdog Millionaire is co-directed by Loveleen Tandan. While she did not receive an Oscar nomination, she does get a title card right after Danny Boyle. Please feel free to let me know any other movies I've missed. Warning: If you did not get this far in the description and you leave a thoughtless comment such as \"Bela Tarr is a man\" then it will be removed. You can ask \"Who is the credited female director on The Turin Horse?\" but we ask you do not phrase your question the other way. –– STATS: Top Decade: 2010s (76 films) Top Decade, 20th Century only: 1990s (31 films) Top Year: 2023 (20 films, by premiere year) Top Year, 20th Century only: 1999 (6 films, by premiere year) Newest Film: The Substance (2024) Oldest Film: The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) Longest Film: Out 1 (743 mins) Shortest Film: The Final Exit of the Disciples of Ascensia (45 mins) Oscar Nominations: 106 (between 39 films) Oscar Wins: 31 (between 13 films) Best Picture Winners: 3 out of 4 (includes Slumdog Millionaire, co-directed by Loveleen Tantan; The Hurt Locker misses the list) Best Picture Nominees: 13 out of 22 (Children of a Lesser God, The Prince of Tides, An Education, The Hurt Locker, The Kids Are All Right, Winter’s Bone, Zero Dark Thirty, Promising Young Woman & The Power of the Dog miss the list) Oscar Nominees for Best Director: 7 out of 9 (Emerald Fennell, Kathryn Bigelow, and Jane Campion's Oscar win miss the list) Animated Films: 27 Directorial Debuts: 114 Non-English Language Films: 154 Films With Male Director Credits: 40 (Jean-Marie Straub shares seven credits with Danièle Huillet, Béla Tarr shares two credits with Ágnes Hranitzky, and Hugh Welchman shares two credits with DK Welchman.)
