        "text": "A lot of reviews say this is bad, but I didn't think so. Before watching, I had no knowledge of the story, just that it was a period piece. I'm glad for that, because it surprised me. It did start out as a love story, and just when I was settled to watching another period romance (I don't like romance), it suddenly became something different.\n\nI admit, the story was a bit rushed. I don't know the original book, but maybe a two-part treatment would have been better. The beginning does start off at a good pace, but then suddenly everything seems to happen in a short space of time.\n\nI have seen it compared to ITV's other period piece, Downton Abbey, but the comparison is completely wrong. While both have beautiful pictures, excellent costumes, and happen when women still wore long skirts, the similarities stop there. This is a TV movie, that is a long series. This is somewhat Gothic in feel, and centers around one woman, that has the character list that could be the length of one of my old school headmistresses' speeches (she was known for speaking for hours).\n\nI thought the acting was done superbly. The main character, Emily, is played by Lydia Wilson, and she shows the required amount of gentle intelligence and slight naivet√© that is required for the story. The other characters are sufficiently creepy, helped along by the equally creepy music.\n\nI am going to read the book, and I'm sure the movie will wet other people's appetites as well. Partly because it feels like there should be more of the story."
