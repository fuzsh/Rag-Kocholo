        "text": "1008. We look at why you have to use \"the\" before some nouns and not others, and then we dive into the science behind why rhymes stick in our memory and how they can even influence our beliefs.\n\n1007. Why do Adele and Susan Boyle sound American when they sing? We have answers. Plus, with all the talk about \"weird\" lately, we think it's time to examine the old \"I before E except after C\" rule that has so many exceptions it's hardly a rule at all â until you add W for \"weird.\"\n\n1006. We look at why the pronoun \"I\" seems to take plural verbs, and then we talk about a grammar topic that's in the news: how to make names that end in S (like Harris and Biles) possessive.\n\n1005. You asked, so I have a brief history of English from invading Germanic tribes to the Modern English era. We talk about Vikings, the Norman Conquest, the Black Death, the Tyndale Bible, the printing press, and more.\n\n1004. This week, Karen Yin, author of \"The Conscious Style Guide,\" discusses the concept of conscious language and its importance in promoting equity and respect. We explore the differences between conscious language and political correctness, the evolution of the singular \"they,\" and how to navigate language change. Karen also shares insights on addressing language mishaps, the importance of context in language use, and how to approach controversial terms and phrases.\n\n1003. This week, we look at zero â what a weird number! It has two plurals, sometimes you use the word and sometimes you use the numeral, and it gave rise to a bunch of idioms in the World War II era. Then we turn our attention to email. Generational differences can lead to misunderstandings. We explain why and how to avoid them."
