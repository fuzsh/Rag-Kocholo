        "text": "AFR 155 Introduction to Black Women’s Studies (4 Credits)\n\nThis course examines historical, critical and theoretical perspectives on the development of Black feminist theory/praxis. The course draws from the 19th century to the present, but focuses on the contemporary Black feminist intellectual tradition that achieved notoriety in the 1970s and initiated a global debate on Western and global feminisms. Central to our exploration is the analysis of the intersectional relationship between theory and practice, and of race, to gender and class. We conclude the course with the exploration of various expressions of contemporary Black feminist thought around the globe as a way of broadening our knowledge of feminist theory. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nAFR 201 Colloquium: Methods of Inquiry in Africana Studies (4 Credits)\n\nDesigned to introduce students to the methods of inquiry used for research in Africana Studies. Through intensive study of a single topic (past examples: Toni Morrison's Beloved, the American South, The Black Seventies) students will consider the formation of the field, engage canonical texts, attend lectures and learn from scholars whose work is based in a variety of disciplines. Focus will be on the challenges and opportunities made possible by doing multi- and interdisciplinary research: how and why scholars ask and approach research questions and have conversations with each other. Students may explore and develop their own research project. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nAFR 202bq Colloquium: Topics in Africana Studies-Black Queer Diaspora (4 Credits)\n\nThis interdisciplinary course explores over two decades of work produced by and about Black Queer Diasporic communities throughout the circum-Atlantic world. While providing an introduction to various artists and intellectuals of the Black Queer Diaspora, this course examines the viability of Black Queer Diaspora world-making praxis as a form of theorizing. We will interrogate the transnational and transcultural mobility of specific Black Queer Diasporic forms of peacemaking, erotic knowledge productions, as well as the concept of “aesthetics” more broadly. Our aim is to use the prism of Blackness/Queerness/Diaspora to highlight the dynamic relationship between Black Diaspora Studies and Queer Studies. {A}{H}{S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nAFR 212 Family Matters: Representations, Policy and the Black Family (4 Credits)\n\nIn this course we examine contemporary African American families from both a sociocultural and socioeconomic perspective. We explore the issues facing African American families as a consequence of the intersecting of race, class and gender categories of America. The aim of this course is to broaden the student’s knowledge of the internal dynamics and diversity of African American family life and to foster a greater understanding of the internal strengths as well as the vulnerabilities of the many varieties of African American families. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nAFR 249 Black Women Writers (4 Credits)\n\nHow does gender matter in a black context? That is the question this course asks and attempts to answer through an examination of works by such authors as Harriet Jacobs, Frances Harper, Nella Larsen, Zora Hurston, Toni Morrison, Ntozake Shange and Alice Walker. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nAFR 360/ ENG 323 Seminar: Toni Morrison (4 Credits)\n\nOffered as AFR 360 and ENG 323. This seminar focuses on Toni Morrison’s literary production. In reading her novels, essays, lectures and interviews, we pay particular attention to three things: her interest in the epic anxieties of American identities; her interest in form, language, and theory; and her study of love. Enrollment limited to 12. Juniors and seniors only. Instructor permission required. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nAFR 366rs Seminar: Contemporary Topics in Africana Studies-Race, Sex & Tourism (4 Credits)\n\nTourism is often lauded as the key to economic development for many countries. However, scholarly work has shown that historical relationships to imperialism and colonialism impact how people and places experience tourism. This course introduces students to debates, methods and conceptual frameworks in the study of race, sex and tourism. Through a review of scholarly texts, tourism paraphernalia, films and travelogues, the course examines the social, political and ethical considerations inherent in multiple forms of tourism including eco-tourism, wellness or health, sun-sand-sea, heritage, dark and voluntourism in locales ranging from the Caribbean and the Americas to Africa and Europe. Enrollment limited to 12. Juniors and Seniors only. Instructor permission required. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nAFS 222 Colloquium: Fanta Faces and Coca Cola Bodies: Popular Culture, Gender and Sexuality in Africa (4 Credits)\n\nThis course uses popular culture as a tool to analyze gender and sexuality issues in Africa. It discusses relevant issues in gender and sexuality across the continent, using selected African songs and movies, which feature these issues as centralized themes. It also examines the lived experiences of African actors, musicians and artistes, both historical and modern, as a means of discussing social norms on gender and sexuality and their subversion. Enrollment limited to 18. (E) {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nAMS 201 Introduction to American Studies (4 Credits)\n\nThis course provides an introduction to American Studies through the interdisciplinary study of American history, life and culture. Students develop critical tools for analyzing cultural texts (including literature, visual arts, music, fashion, advertising, social media, buildings, objects and bodies) in relation to political, social, economic and environmental contexts. The course examines the influence of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and transnationality on conceptions of citizenship, and struggles over what it means to be an “American,” and how this has shaped the distribution of power, resources and wellbeing in the United States. {H}{L}\n\nSpring\n\nAMS 240 Colloquium: Introduction to Disability Studies (4 Credits)\n\nThis course serves as an introductory exploration of the field of disability studies. It asks: how do we define disability? Who is disabled? And what resources do we need to properly study disability? Together, students investigate: trends in disability activism, histories of medicine and science, conceptions of normal embodiment, the utility of terms like \"crippled\" or \"disabled\"and the representation of disability in culture. Enrollment limited to 20. {H}{S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nAMS 245 Feminist & Indigenous Science (4 Credits)\n\nIn this course, we will consider such questions as: What do we know and how do we know it? What knowledges count as science? How is knowledge culturally situated? How has science been central to colonialism and capitalism and what would it mean to decolonize science(s)? Is feminist science possible? We will look at key sites and situations in media and popular culture, in science writing, in sociological accounts of science, in creation stories and traditional knowledges in which knowledge around the categories of race, gender, sex, sexuality, sovereignty, and dis/ability are produced, contested and made meaningful. {H}{S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nANT 215 Ethnographic Mapping: Place, Body and Landscape (4 Credits)\n\nThis course considers theories and practices of reinterpreting landscape through the lenses of indigeneity, transnational feminism and decoloniality. Through a broad range of theoretical and creative works, students explore alternative ways of knowing and relating to places—thinking across space and time, built structures and material absences, borders, embodiment and networks of relations. Discussions engage several ethnographic case studies across the Americas that closely examine the intersections of place, body and landscape. Students apply critical spatial practices by designing a digital project using textual, sonic and visual modes to remap a selected site based on ethnographic research. Enrollment limited to 30. (E) {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nANT 238 Anthropology of the Body (4 Credits)\n\nAnthropology vitally understands bodies as socially meaningful, and as sites for the inculcation of ethical and political identities through processes of embodiment, which break down divides between body as natural and body as socially constituted. This course engages these anthropological understandings to read how bodies are invoked, disciplined and reshaped in prisons and classrooms, market economies and multicultural democracies, religious and ethical movements, and the performance of gender and sexuality, disease and disability. Through these accounts of the body as an object of social analysis and as a vehicle for politics, students learn fundamental social theoretical and anthropological tenets about the embodiment of power, contemporary politics as forms of \"biopolitics\" and the deconstruction of the normative body. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Alternate Years\n\nANT 250 The Anthropology of Reproduction (4 Credits)\n\nThis course uses anthropological approaches and theories to understand reproduction as a social, cultural and biological process. Drawing on cross-cultural studies of pregnancy and childbirth, new reproductive technologies, infertility and family planning, the course examines how society and culture shape biological experiences of reproduction. We also explore how anthropological studies and theories of reproduction intersect with larger questions about nature and culture, kinship and citizenship among others. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nANT 257 Urban Anthropology (4 Credits)\n\nThis course considers the city as both a setting for anthropological research and as an ethnographic object of study in itself. We aim to think critically about the theoretical and methodological possibilities, challenges and limitations that are posed by urban anthropology. We consider concepts and themes such as urbanization and migration; urban space and mobility; gender, race and ethnicity; technology and virtual space; markets and economies; citizenship and belonging; and production and consumption. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Alternate Years\n\nANT 267 Contemporary South Asia (4 Credits)\n\nThis course introduces students to the culture, politics and everyday life of South Asia. Topics covered include religion, community, nation, caste, gender and development, as well as some of the key conceptual problems in the study of South Asia, such as the colonial construction of social scientific knowledge, and debates over tradition and modernity. In this way, we address both the varieties in lived experience in the subcontinent and the key scholarly, popular and political debates that have constituted the terms through which we understand South Asian culture. Along with ethnographies, we study and discuss novels, historical analysis, primary historical texts and popular (Bollywood) and documentary film. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Annually\n\nANT 347iw Seminar: Topics in Anthropology-How We Inhabit the World (4 Credits)\n\nMaking a place of one’s own entails occupying and consuming what the place consists of. Human inhabitation of the planet can be seen as simultaneously productive and destructive, of both the inhabited space and its inhabitants. Drawing on concepts commonly considered “economic”; i.e. production, consumption, exchange, and property the following questions will be explored in this course: i) Does anthropological research confirm the universality of these concepts in human communities across history and geography as assumed by political and economic philosophers? ii) In what ways are the experiences, and hence understandings of, production, consumption, exchange, and property being transformed by the processes termed “neoliberalism”? How are these changes shaping the ways in which older and newer dispossessed groups may or may not inhabit the world? Readings for the course will include philosophical and anthropological texts. Enrollment limited to 12. Juniors and seniors only. Instructor permission required. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nANT 352eu Seminar: Topics in Anthropology-Eugenics at Smith College (4 Credits)\n\nThis course is a research seminar based on the history of the eugenics movement and other forms of racial pseudo-science in the United States. After completing some general readings on the history of American eugenics, students will develop individual research projects based on the rise, decline and lingering impacts of the movement. The focus in developing these projects will be on materials stored in the Smith College Archives, which range from the papers of Harris Hawthorne Wilder, Morris Steggerda and other faculty who were involved in eugenics research to ephemeral materials that document the participation of Smith students in this research from the 1910s to the late 1930s. Enrollment limited to 12. Juniors and seniors only. Instructor permission required. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nARH 278 Race and Gender in the History of Photography (4 Credits)\n\nThis course introduces the history of photography, emphasizing the ways photographs represent, mediate, construct and communicate histories of race, gender, sex, sexuality, intimacy and desire. The class studies a variety of photographic images, from the daguerreotype to digital media, from fine arts photography to vernacular images. Students consider objects that have forged connections among loved ones, substantiated memories or served as evidence, considering critical questions about photography’s relationship to identity, affect, knowledge production and power. The course focuses on race and gender, and also attends closely to photography’s relationship to identity broadly speaking, including class, ability and religion. {A}{H}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nCCX 245/ SWG 245 Colloquium: Collective Organizing (4 Credits)\n\nOffered as SWG 245 and CCX 245. This course introduces students to key concepts, debates and provocations that animate the world of community, labor and electoral organizing for social change. To better understand these movements’ visions, students develop an analysis of global and national inequalities, exploitation and oppression. The course explores a range of organizing skills to build an awareness of power dynamics and learn activists’ tools to bring people together towards common goals. A central aspect of this course is practicing community-based learning and research methods in dialogue with community-based activist partners. Enrollment limited to 18. {H}{S}\n\nFall\n\nCLS 233 Gender and Sexuality in Greco-Roman Culture (4 Credits)\n\nThe construction of gender, sexuality, and erotic experience is one of the major sites of difference between Greco-Roman culture and our own. What constituted a proper man and a proper woman in these ancient societies? Which sexual practices and objects of desire were socially sanctioned and which considered deviant? What ancient modes of thinking about these issues have persisted into the modern world? Attention to the status of women; the role of social class; the ways in which genre and convention shaped representation; the relationship between representation and reality. {H}{L}\n\nFall, Spring, Alternate Years\n\nEAL 235 Class, Gender and Material Culture in Late Imperial China (4 Credits)\n\nThis class examines the continuum between subject and object in Chinese fiction, drama, and poetry from the 16th through the 18th centuries, discussing how individuals participate as agents and objects of circulation; how objects structure identity and articulate relationships; the body as object; and the materiality of writing, illustration, and the stage. We analyze historical constructions of class and gender and reflect on how individuals constructed social identities vis-à-vis objects and consumption. All readings in English translation. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nEAL 239/ WLT 239 Intimacy in Contemporary Chinese Women’s Fiction (4 Credits)\n\nOffered as EAL 239 and WLT 239. How do stories about love, romance and desire (including extramarital affairs, serial relationships and love between women) challenge our assumptions about identity? How do pursuits, successes and failures of intimacy lead to personal and social change? An exploration of major themes through close readings of contemporary fiction by women from China, Taiwan and Chinese diasporas. Readings are in English translation and no background in China or Chinese is required. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nEAL 242 Modern Japanese Literature (4 Credits)\n\nA survey of Japanese literature from the late 19th century to the present. Over the last century and a half, Japan has undergone tremendous change: rapid industrialization, imperial and colonial expansion, occupation following its defeat in the Pacific War, and emergence as a global economic power. The literature of modern Japan reflects the complex aesthetic, cultural and political effects of such changes. Through our discussions of these texts, we also address theoretical questions about such concepts as identity, gender, race, sexuality, nation, class, colonialism, modernism and translation. All readings are in English translation. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nEAL 244 Japanese Women’s Writing (4 Credits)\n\nThis course focuses on the writings of Japanese women from the 10th century until the present. We examine the foundations of Japan’s literary tradition represented by such early works as Murasaki Shikibu’s Tale of Genji and Sei Shonagon’s Pillow Book. We then move to the late 19th century to consider the first modern examples of Japanese women’s writing. How does the existence of a \"feminine literary tradition\" in pre-modern Japan influence the writing of women during the modern period? How do these texts reflect, resist and reconfigure conventional representations of gender? We explore the possibilities and limits of the articulation of feminine and feminist subjectivities, as well as investigate the production of such categories as \"race,\" class and sexuality in relation to gender and to each other. Taught in English, with no knowledge of Japanese required. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nEAL 245 Writing, Japan and Otherness (4 Credits)\n\nAn exploration of representations of \"otherness\" in Japanese literature and film from the mid-19th century until the present. How was (and is) Japan’s identity as a modern nation configured through representations of other nations and cultures? How are categories of race, gender, nationality, class and sexuality used in the construction of difference? This course pays special attention to the role of \"otherness\" in the development of national and individual identities. In conjunction with these investigations, we also address the varied ways in which Japan is represented as \"other\" by writers from China, England, France, Korea and the United States. How do these images of and by Japan converse with each other? All readings are in English translation.\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nEAL 261 Gender and Sexuality in Late Imperial Chinese Literature (4 Credits)\n\nThis class will examine Chinese literary traditions in various different genres such as fiction, poetry and drama from the 16th through the 18th centuries from perspectives of gender and sexuality. Through the class, you will learn to examine Chinese literary tradition from the perspective of gender, discussing the gendering of new modes of expression in de/constructing men and women as social categories over the long course of Chinese literary history. We will pay special attention to how women were represented in classical literature, primarily poetry and fiction, both through their own writing and in the writing of men. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nEAL 273 Colloquium: Women and Narration in Modern Korea (4 Credits)\n\nThis class explores modern Korean history from women's perspectives. It charts the historical and cultural transformation in modern Korea since the 1920s by coupling key terms of modern history with specific female figures: (1) Colonial modernity with modern girls in the 1920s and 30s; (2) colonization and cold-war regime with \"comfort women\" and \"western princesses\" from the 1940s to the 1960s; (3) industrial development under the authoritarian regime in the 1970s with factory girls; and (4) democratization and multiculturalism with rising feminists in the new millennium. {H}{L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nECO 201 Gender and Economics (4 Credits)\n\nThis course uses economic analysis to explore how gender differences can lead to differences in economic outcomes in households and the labor market. Questions to be covered include: How does the family function as an economic unit? How do individuals allocate time between the labor market and the household? How have changes in family structure affected women's employment, and vice-versa? What are possible explanations for gender differences in labor force participation, occupational choice, and earnings? What is the role of government in addressing gender issues in the home and the workplace? How successful are government policies that primarily affect women? Prerequisites: ECO 150. {S}\n\nFall, Spring, Alternate Years\n\nENG 218 Colloquium: Monstrous Mothers (4 Credits)\n\nThis course explores the monstrosity of motherhood - the fear, disgust, alienation and confusion of both being a mother and having one. The class discusses literary and cinematic representations of mothers as absent, distant, cruel, ambivalent, irresponsible and deviant, and considers ways motherhood is thought of both as a self-sacrifice and as a necessity. Students also seek new models of care, love and attachment that are dependent neither on the sacrifice of one’s self nor on biological reproduction and that recast mothering as potentially revolutionary. Not open to first years. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nENG 219 Poetry, Gender, and Sexuality, and the Limits of Privacy (4 Credits)\n\nThis course focuses on the legacy of confessional poetry written by women and queer, trans and nonbinary writers in the US. Frequently misread as self-indulgent, the poets under our purview use radical self-disclosure to trouble the social and legal treatment of gender and sexuality as “private” concerns unworthy of political engagement. In so doing, they resist the universalized heteronormativity of the mainstream confessional tradition and contemporary poetry writ large. Poets studied include Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Paul Monette, Essex Hemphill, Claudia Rankine, Cameron Awkward-Rich, and Danez Smith. Enrollment limited to 30. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nENG 223 Contemporary American Gothic Literature (4 Credits)\n\nThis course traces the emergence of a 21st-century gothic tradition in American writing through texts including novels, films and television shows. We analyze the shifting definitions and cultural work of the Gothic in contemporary American literature in the context of political and cultural events and movements and their relation to such concerns as race, gender, class, sexuality and disability. From the New Mexican desert to the rural south, from New York City, San Francisco and the suburbs of Atlanta to cyberspace, these literary encounters explore an expanse of physical, psychological, intellectual and imagined territory. {A}{L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nENG 241 The Empire Writes Back: Postcolonial Literature (4 Credits)\n\nIntroduction to Anglophone fiction, poetry, drama and memoir from Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia in the aftermath of the British empire. Concerns include the cultural and political work of literature in response to histories of colonial and racial dominance; writers' ambivalence towards English linguistic, literary and cultural legacies; ways literature can (re)construct national identities and histories and address dominant notions of race, class, gender and sexuality; women writers' distinctiveness and modes of contesting patriarchal and colonial ideologies; and global diasporas, migration, globalization and U.S. imperialism. Readings include Achebe, Adichie, Aidoo, Dangarembga, Walcott, Cliff, Rushdie, Ghosh, Lahiri, Hamid and others. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nENG 243 The Victorian Novel (4 Credits)\n\nAn exploration of the worlds of the Victorian novel, from the city to the country, from the vast reaches of empire to the minute intricacies of the drawing room. Attention to a variety of critical perspectives, with emphasis on issues of narrative form, authorial voice,and the representation of race, class, gender and disability. Novelists will include Brontë,Collins, Dickens, Eliot and Kipling. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nENG 273 Colloquium: Bloomsbury and Sexuality (4 Credits)\n\nMembers of the Bloomsbury movement led non-normative (what many now call queer) lives. The complexity and openness of their relationships characterized not only the lives but also the major works of fiction, art, design, and critical writings its members produced. \"Sex permeated our conversation,\" Woolf recalls, and in Bloomsbury and Sexuality we’ll explore the far-reaching consequences of this ostensible removal of discursive, social, and sexual inhibition in the spheres of literature, art, and social sciences. The course will draw from the art of Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, the writings of E. M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, Radclyffe Hall, Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes and others, along with contemporary queer theory. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nENG 275 Witches, Witchcraft and Witch Hunts (4 Credits)\n\nThis course has two central ambitions. First, it introduces themes of magic and witchcraft in (mostly) American literature and film. We work together to figure out how the figure of the witch functions in stories, novels and movies, what witches and witchcraft mean or how they participate in the texts’ ways of making meaning. At the same time, we try to figure out how witches and witchcraft function as loci or displacements of social anxiety--about power, science, gender, class, race and politics. Since the identification of witches and the fear of witchcraft often lead to witch panics, we finally examine the historical and cultural phenomenon of the witch hunt, including both the persecution of persons literally marked as witches and the analogous persecution of persons (Communists, sexual outsiders, etc.) figuratively \"hunted\" as witches have been. Open to students at all levels, regardless of major. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nENG 278 Asian American Women Writers (4 Credits)\n\nThe body of literature written by Asian American women over the past 100 years or so has been recognized as forming a coherent tradition even as it grows and expands to include newcomers and divergent voices under its umbrella. What conditions enabled its emergence? How have the qualities and concerns of this tradition been defined? What makes a text--fiction, poetry, memoir, mixed-genre--central or marginal to the tradition and how do emergent writers take this tradition in new directions? writers to be studied may include Maxine Hong Kingston, Sui Sin Far, Cathy Song, Joy Kogawa, Jessica Hagedorn, Monique Truong, Jhumpa Lahiri, Ruth Ozeki, and more. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Variable\n\nENG 303qa Seminar: Topics in American Literature-Feminist and Queer Asian American Writing (4 Credits)\n\nWhat does it mean to be queer, feminist or Asian American at the turn of this century?

What is the role of the Asian American literary imagination in the face of war, im/migration, trans- and homophobia, labor exploitation and U.S. militarism? This course will explore these foundational questions through a sustained analysis of feminist and queer Asian American literature: novels, poetry, life-writing and film. Through a mix of scholarly and literary texts, students will examine a range of topics at the intersection of Asian American and gender and sexuality studies: identity and (self) representation, the vestiges of war, diaspora and migration, family and kinship, the hyper- and de-sexualization of Asian Americans, labor, globalization and racial capitalism.

The class examines the question of whether \"banlieue\" authors can escape various pressures: to become native informants; to write realistic rather than fantastical novels; to leave the “ghetto”; to denounce the sometimes difficult traditions, religions, neighborhoods and family members that have challenged but also molded them. Often seen as spaces of regression and decay, the \"banlieues\" nevertheless produce vibrant cultural expressions that beg the question: Is the \"banlieue\" a mere suburb of French cultural life or more like one of its centers?

Helen plays a cameo role, while Clytemnestra is regularly invoked as a negative example. Together these women define a spectrum of female roles and possibilities: the faithful wife, the bride-to-be, the temptress, the adulteress, the murderer. The course begins with a careful reading of the Odyssey, then studies the afterlife of its female characters in the Western literary tradition.

Using the WPA interviews—part of the New Deal Federal Writers Project of the 1930s—this course looks at the historical memory of former slaves by reading and listening to their own words. How did 70- through 90-year-old former slaves remember their childhoods and young adulthoods during slavery? And how do scholars make sense of these interviews given they were conducted when Jim Crow segregation was at its pinnacle? The course examines the WPA interviews as historical sources by studying scholarship that relies heavily on them. Most importantly, students explore debates that swirl around the interviews and challenge their validity on multiple fronts, even as they remain the richest sources of African American oral history regarding slavery.

As #MeToo and other movements challenge cultures of oppression, how do such struggles relate to the ecological, capitalist, and humanitarian crises that threaten life as we know it? Learning from feminisms, this course questions persistent structural binaries: mind/body, human/animal, man/woman, culture/nature. Drawing on literature, philosophy and journalism, we examine how social constructions of gender, class, race, and disability coalesce with material bodies, spaces, and conditions to form habits of subjectivity and patterns of life. {L}\n\nFall, Spring, Alternate Years\n\nWRT 118lg Colloquium: Topics in Writing-Language and Gender (4 Credits)\n\nHow people speak – the words they choose, the way they structure their sentences, the pitch of their voices, even their gender while speaking – is constantly judged by those around them. Examining the interaction of gender and language leads to questions, such as how does gender shape the way people use language, how does gender affect others’ perceptions of speech (both written and verbal), what variation occurs across cultures with regards to gender and language? This course uses the topic of language and gender to expand upon and improve rhetorical and writing skills. Enrollment limited to 15. WI\n\nFall, Spring, Variable"
