        "text": "Growing up I always loved films. Trips to the video store on a Friday night were filled with excitement. As a young girl, I looked to the girls and women in movies to show me the way to my future. While watching Girls Just Want to Have Fun, I wanted to skip school to be in a dance competition like Sarah Jessica Parker, get a muscled boyfriend in a dance vest and be as cool as Helen Hunt’s character, who was the definition of a rebel. Watching Top Gun, I believed that kissing in silhouette was definitely the sexiest option, and when watching Pretty Woman, I believed that fairy tales came true. I grew up believing that love affairs should be my focus and thinking, unconsciously perhaps, that I needed a man to save me from myself somehow.\n\nAbout four years ago, I began dating a screenwriter and filmmaker, and I started going to the cinema all the time. I watched anything and everything, often seeing as many as four movies a week. It was during this time that I began to realize that I felt unidentified in movies. As a young girl when I was still learning about the world, I allowed myself to absorb films, like all other teachings, almost without question. Yet as an adult I realized that very few stories offered a 3-D picture of myself or other women. I would leave the cinema with an uncomfortable feeling of not being good enough. If I didn’t fit the Hollywood mold of a beautiful woman, whose role has been to support a leading man and say very little, then somehow I was being told that I was doing my femininity all wrong. Strong, determined, intelligent women like myself and those around me were few and far between on the movie screen.\n\nMy boyfriend, knowing so much about film, would tell me all about the screenwriters, directors, and producers of films, and I realized that I was always hearing male names. I began to dig deeper, discovering that women have received only 19 percent of nonacting Oscar nominations, and only one woman has ever won the Academy Award for Best Director in all of its 88 ceremonies to date. As a writer myself, I am keenly aware of the favor given to male writers and of the dismissal of women’s stories under the banner of chick lit, and it appeared I was seeing the same in the film industry.\n\nIn what started out as an attempt to support female directors and writers, I made a commitment to spend three months watching films written or directed by women, or films with a woman in the lead role. When I started this experiment, I imagined that the result would be nothing but frustration. I imagined that I would not be able to join my partner at the cinema and that I would feel bitter about women’s role in cinema. However, the result was something far different. When leaving the few films that I could see, I felt identified, inspired, and fulfilled, a feeling that far outweighed any frustration about the films I was missing out on. I watched successful female businesswomen achieve their goals despite the odds, female police officers run task forces, couples having deep discussions on equal footing about the meaning of life and love, as well as women being brilliantly funny and carefree. I felt inspired to write, inspired to grow, inspired to try new and different things. I could find a small space to feel hopeful in the film world once again.\n\nWhen the Oscars rolled around, I was unable to see most of the nominated films, which once again highlighted the lack of merit given to women’s stories by the industry. This year’s awards have seen a slight improvement with Best Picture nominations for Arrival, with Amy Adams playing a linguistics professor hired to communicate with aliens; Hidden Figures, the story of three female African-American mathematical geniuses working for NASA in the 1960s; and La La Land, in which Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling at least share the lead role. However, there is still no female director nominated for the Best Director or Best Original Screenplay, despite a number of films centered on the lives of women. This problem is not simply an Academy issue; in fact, according to a recent Celluloid Ceiling report, in 2016 \"women comprised 17 percent of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films.\" Of these same 250 films, women wrote only 13 percent. What does it mean for society when men are telling the majority of women’s stories? I believe that men can write women and women can write men, but it is troubling when the numbers are so skewed in one direction.\n\nOn a hopeful note, however, a number of initiatives are being put in place to give women access to an industry that shuts them out and statistics are finally beginning to show that movies with strong females leads are attracting moviegoers. If my experience is anything to go by, it is not just important but wholly necessary that women’s voices play a greater role in Hollywood, to inspire women toward much more than the supporting role both on- and offscreen."
