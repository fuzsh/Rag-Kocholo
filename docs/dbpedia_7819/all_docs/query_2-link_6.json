        "text": "I am making a bold statement right off the bat in this review by saying wholeheartedly: “Heathers” was the best production that I have seen at the Academy Playhouse. They nailed it.\n\nOf course as a child of the ‘80s and a die-hard fan of the original “Heathers” dark, cult-classic movie starring Winona Ryder and Christian Slater, I was excited to see the Cape Cod debut of this Off Broadway hit. But to be honest, I feared that adding the musical element to the iconic story would come off as corny or cringe-worthy. I could not have been more wrong!\n\nAccompanying me to the sold-out opening night last week was my daughter, my two nieces, and my sister, who is also a major fan of the movie. In fact, she and I spent much of the early ‘90s memorizing all of the legendary monologues and one-liners from the cult classic: “What’s your damage, Heather?” “Greetings and salutations,” “Corn Nuts!” “I got paid in puke,” “dear diary,” and so many more. Seriously, ask me to recite the Remington Party scene where Heather Chandler and Veronica face off and I happily will!\n\n“Heathers” is set in the suburbs of Ohio in 1989. The story follows Veronica Sawyer and her three friends, all named Heather. Together they make up the most popular, feared and powerful clique in school. When Veronica and her new rebellious boyfriend, JD, accidentally poison one of the Heathers, what follows is a wild and tumultuous series of staged suicides, murders and survival of the scrunchied fittest at their fictional Westerburg High School.\n\nTheatergoers should be aware that the musical, like the movie, comes with a few noteworthy disclaimers — it isn't suitable for young children, as there are major themes of suicide, sex, bullying, homophobia, guns and murder. As such, I was happy to see a page detailing local crisis resources in the Playbill.\n\n“Heathers” features more than 20 original studio recorded songs, several of which currently have TikTok fame at the moment. Playing the dangerous duo in love, Veronica (she wears blue) and JD, are Virginia Ohlson and Oli Keuhne. Fun fact — they also both appeared in last summer’s smash hit at APA, “American Idiot.” Each have stellar voices. Ohlson’s grit and alluring presence on stage was a fantastic match with Keuhne’s bad-boy, sly demeanor. The “Heathers” are played by the scene-stealing, can’t-take-your-eyes-off-of Haley Spiewakowski (Heather Chandler in red), adorably energetic firecracker Melanie Singer (Heather McNamara in yellow) and fiercely bold Emma Taylor (Heather Duke in green).\n\nBonehead jocks Kurt and Ram, who eventually meet their untimely deadly fate, are played by Seamus Sartin and Kasey Young. One of the most memorable songs of the night, “My Dead Gay Son,” was comically performed by Ram and Kurt’s fathers, played by Fred Carpenter and Andrew Haber. Taylor Read plays the sweet lonely role of Martha “Dumptruck” Dunnstock, a tortured teen girl at the heart of the Heathers’ bullying. Kimberly Matthews, most recently seen in APA’s “The Sound of Music,” played multiple roles in this show but notably belted out the joyful and upbeat tune “Shine a Light.” Rounding out this talented cast are Jace Carpenter, Kayla Jorgensen, Raven Berry, Gwen Calderbank, Max Calderbank, Samantha Park, Jacob Rabold, Dan Rabold and Julia Randall.\n\nDirector Karen Hepinstall, music director Chris Morris and the entire cast and crew of this show truly outdid themselves. It is bold. It is edgy. And it will really make you appreciate all of the work that pours into local community theater. The attitudes and angst among the actors were spot-on, the character portrayals were next-level, and the singing was phenomenal. You’ll be up cheering for all of the Heathers by the show’s end.\n\nThis ‘80s girl will guarantee you don’t have to know the movie “Heathers” by heart or at all to love the musical. Better motor and get your tickets now — this one is sure to sell out fast."
