        "text": "It appears to have been a bit of a slow week on Netflix, with the most-watched title racking up just 12.8 million views. That was Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie, ranking atop the English films list.\n\nOn the TV side of things, A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder made its debut with 7.4M views, which was good enough to send the YA mystery series to No. 1 on the English TV chart.\n\nCobra Kai Season 6A seems to be losing steam, cutting its viewership by more than half this week, with just 4.1M views. Still, that put it in second place. Meanwhile, Simone Biles Rising had a good week, rising to No. 3 with 3.8M views, which is up just slightly from the week prior, likely aided by her stellar performance at the Paris Olympics.\n\nElsewhere in TV, Dirty Pop: The Boy Band Scam took fourth with 3.5M views (down from second last week, losing about 2M views), while Season 6 of Too Hot To Handle moved down to No. 6 with 2.7M views.\n\nNetflix’s latest standup special, Joe Rogan: Burn the Boats, managed No. 7 with 2.5M views after its Saturday night debut. That’s a strong showing for the comedy special, which will likely rake in a larger audience this upcoming week, since only about 24 hours of viewership were accounted for during this measurement window.\n\nRELATED: ‘Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie’ Cast Guide: Who Voices Who?\n\nBack to film, Find Me Falling dropped to No. 5 this week, down from the top spot the week prior, drawing just 5.6M views. Thats about a third of the audience it had in the previous interval. Kids animation appeared to be the strongest winner this week with three spots in the English film Top 10 — Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie at #2 (7M views), Trolls Band Together at #4 (5.9M views), and The Bad Guys at #8 (4.2M views).\n\nUnder Paris is still going strong on the non-English film list, claiming seventh place with 1.7M views. It has already made its way onto Netflix’s most popular list with more than 95M views since it debuted, but it has about a month left in its 91-day premiere window, meaning it could very well surpass Troll to be the streamer’s most-watched non-English language film of all time.\n\nAlso, the eighth and final season of teen crime drama Elite moved into the top spot on the Non-English TV List, clocking 3.9M views."
