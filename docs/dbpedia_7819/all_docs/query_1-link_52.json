        "text": "Berlinale World Cinema Fund\n\nThe World Cinema Fund works to develop and support cinema in regions with a weak film infrastructure, while fostering cultural diversity in German cinemas. The Fund provides support for feature films and feature-length documentaries by filmmakers in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, and the Caucasus, as well as Mongolia, Pakistan and Sri-Lanka. Plus – only for WCF Europe – Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine. Projects should deal with the cultural identity of their regions and should contribute to the development of the local film industry. Priority is given to projects that tell strong stories, that are creatively and visually innovative, and that have the potential to enjoy international success—as well as being of cultural and political relevance. Production funding of up to 60.000 euros, post-production funding of up to 40.000 euros and distribution funding of up to 10,000 euros is available.\n\nDoc Society Climate Story Fund\n\nThe Climate Story Fund prioritizes climate stories centering on the most affected, the unengaged, and the underrepresented and puts them at the center of the story. The Fund also prioritizes storytellers working in and from those communities, sharing narratives that resonate deeply with new and unengaged audiences and bringing them into critical conversations around climate justice.\n\nCatapult Film Fund\n\nCatapult Film Fund provides development funding to help story-driven and cinematic documentary films get off the ground. Catapult Film Fund provides development funding to documentary filmmakers who have a compelling story to tell, have secured access to their story, and are ready to shoot and edit a piece for production fundraising purposes. Our mission is to enable filmmakers to develop their films to the next level at a moment where funding is hard to find.\n\nCalifornia Humanities\n\nThey are an independent nonprofit organization and a partner of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Since 1975, they have been promoting the humanities as relevant, meaningful ways to understand the human condition and connect us to each other in order to help strengthen California. They produce, fund, create, and support humanities-based projects and programs, eye-opening cultural experiences and meaningful conversations. During the past 40 years, California Humanities has awarded over $29 million in grants across the state, reaching every Congressional district.\n\nCanada Council for the Arts\n\nIn 2017-18, over 2,300 Canadian artists and almost 1,900 arts organizations received Canada Council grants. We will amplify the quality, scale and sharing of art through digital technology, which is changing the way we relate to the arts and culture, and how we connect with each other and the world. Artists and arts organizations need to be able to thrive in this radically changing environment. Increased financial support will help them take advantage of technology to create new artistic visions and experiences.\n\nCreative Work Fund\n\nCreative Work Fund projects feature one or more artists collaborating with 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations. The Fund encourages the artists and organizations to “come together” for the sake of this collaboration. It can be a visual art project in any form, but it must feature a lead artist with a strong track record as a traditional artist or a visual artist.\n\nExperimental Television Finishing Funds\n\nETC’s mission is to encourage the creation of work using new electronic media technologies, to encourage an informed appreciation of media art, and to help honor our independently created moving-image heritage by initiating projects and participating in partnerships which address the needs for research, education and preservation, and place independent works within a larger cultural context.\n\nThe Film Fund\n\nThe Film Fund serves as an alternative to film industry funding platforms such as screenwriting contests, time-intensive grant applications, and crowdfunding campaigns found on websites such as Kickstarter. You could even use The Film Fund in conjunction with crowdfunding. We want to see films happen, and we’re here to make it easier for them to come to life.\n\nFleishhacker Foundation\n\nThe Fleishhacker Foundation makes grants to film projects within its Small Arts Grants Program. We are more interested in supporting an artist’s vision than educational documentaries. Applications are only accepted for the post production phase of the project based on rough cut. Most grants are in the range of $2,000 – $5,000. It is preferred that a Bay Area arts organization serve as the fiscal sponsor.\n\nFrameline\n\nFrameline’s mission is to change the world through the power of queer cinema. As a media arts nonprofit, Frameline’s integrated programs connect filmmakers and audiences in San Francisco and around the globe. Frameline provides critical funding for emerging LGBTQ+ filmmakers, reaches hundreds of thousands with a collection of over 250 films distributed worldwide, inspires thousands of students in schools across the nation with free films and curricula through Youth in Motion, and creates an international stage for the world’s best LGBTQ+ film through the San Francisco International LGBTQ+ Film Festival and additional year-round screenings and cinematic events.\n\nFrom the Heart Productions\n\nNow entering its fourth decade, the Roy W. Dean Film Grants fund independent feature films, documentaries, web series, and short films with budgets of $500,000 or less that are unique and make a contribution to society that, without its help, might otherwise never get made.\n\nFork Films\n\nInvests in and creates media that make an important social contribution, with a particular emphasis on material that has been overlooked, people who tend to be underestimated, and stories that have been left out of the mainstream historical record.\n\nThe Future of Film is Female\n\n“The Future of Film is Female” project provides financial and promotional support to women filmmakers who are in pre/post-production of a short film. As part of the larger conversation happening in the film community about the lack of female filmmakers, this project has been initiated for positive change. Because providing financial assistance is the first step to increasing the representation of women’s voices in the industry, this project awards individual grants from $500 – $1000 (quantity dependent on sales) on a quarterly basis. All proceeds from “The Future of Film is Female” project go to female filmmakers with a short film in any stage of production. We have also partnered with the Museum of Modern Art to screen an ongoing, seasonal film series.\n\nInside Out’s RE:Focus Fund\n\nEstablished in 2018, Inside Out’s RE:Focus Fund aims to address industry inequities through providing direct financial support to women, non-binary, and / or trans filmmakers telling LGBTQ stories.\n\nEstablished through a lead gift from Martha McCain, the fund has distributed more than $50,000 in festival travel grants and professional development programs for filmmakers since its creation.\n\nIn 2019 Inside Out has extended the impact of the RE:Focus Fund by launching the Post-Production Grants to support the post-production of short and feature films.\n\nContact: Jenna Dufton / [email protected]\n\nITVS\n\nAccepts proposals on an ongoing basis for documentary projects that fall outside of the standing initiatives (DDF, LINCS, Open Call). For development funding, activities may include travel, research, script development, preliminary production for fundraising/work-in-progress reels, or other early-phase activities. For production funding, all production and post-production activities are eligible. Commissioned Funding is not a grant; applicants receive funding in the form of a development agreement or production agreement that assigns ITVS certain important rights over the project during the term of the contract.\n\nJerome Foundation\n\nThere are no deadlines for New York City residents to apply.

We seek projects that will have positive and tangible effects on specific and vital issues. The overarching goal of our granting program is to help ensure that important stories are both told and heard.\n\nMovieMaker Production Services\n\nMovieMaker is a magazine and website focused on the art and craft of making movies. Our Production Services program has helped hundreds of productions get deals, make connections, publicize their films, and save tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nFor an accepted film, a producer invests at least $10K into the program. MovieMaker Production Services then doubles the value of that investment for almost anything that’s needed to get the movie to market — editing, visual effects, DCP, color correction, publicity, you name it. Your $10K gets you $20K in services, $15K gets you $30K, $25K gets you $50K. Once your film is complete, MMPS will help promote the film through MovieMaker Magazine, MovieMaker.com, and our social channels.\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts\n\nThe NEA is the independent federal agency whose funding and support gives Americans the opportunity to participate in the arts, exercise their imaginations, and develop their creative capacities.

Sarah, whose feature film Mary Jane’s Not A Virgin Anymore screened at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, died in 2004 after a battle with cancer. Sarah led a DIY (“Do It Yourself”) movement in the 1990s, promoting and distributing her own work with her producer and mom, Ruth Ellen Jacobson, speaking at festivals and events everywhere, and writing about film for a number of publications. A tireless, at times even shameless, promoter of her own work, Sarah was also a passionate advocate for the films of fellow filmmakers. The Free History Project, Sarah’s family and a number of her friends have contributed money in order to give out a small annual grant to one or more female, transgender, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming filmmakers whose work embodies some of the things that Sarah stood for: a fierce DIY approach to filmmaking, a radical social critique, and a thoroughly underground sensibility.\n\nUniversity Film & Video Association\n\nApplicants must be a student (undergraduate/graduate) at the time the application is made.
