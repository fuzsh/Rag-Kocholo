        "text": "The MSt in Film Aesthetics is a degree in the humanities run by the Humanities Division.\n\nThe course concentrates on film from the point of view of aesthetics, including:\n\nthe detailed study of film style and form, and the articulation of it in writing - for example, narrative structure, use of camera, colour, performance, sound, music, editing and composition;\n\nmatters of philosophical aesthetics, and their particular application to film; and\n\nclassic and contemporary film theory and philosophy as they relate to film aesthetics.\n\nMany master's programmes concentrate on historical, cultural, geographical, or political approaches to film and may only contain an aesthetic component. This programme is dedicated to the specialist study of film form, and film as an art form. Applicants should note that historical, cultural, geographical, and political approaches to film study may feature in courses and in written work, but they are not prioritised in the teaching and assessment of the degree.\n\nThe course runs from late September to June, from a week before the first term to the end of the last term.\n\nA week before term officially begins, you will attend a practical film workshop for one week. Although the degree itself is not practical, this week acts as an introduction to film techniques and allows the group to work with each other before the degree begins. This part of the course is not assessed.\n\nIn the first two terms the course is taught by seminar only, although there will be individual meetings with tutors to discuss essay preparation and feedback. There will be two seminars per week and they will vary in length depending on the module.\n\nThe first term of the course will look at the analysis of film style and film form, train techniques of film analysis and look at key concepts in film form, film criticism, film theory and philosophy.\n\nThe second term consists of four short segments, each covering a particular aesthetic topic. Each segment is compulsory and there are no optional components. This part of the course provides you with the opportunity to engage with four different areas of specialisation.\n\nThe courses for the second term change from year to year but may include:\n\naesthetics of Italian cinema\n\nart and film\n\ncontemporary Chinese film\n\nscreening cities\n\nthe film-philosophy of Stanley Cavell\n\nIn the third term the course is taught by individual supervision focussing on the dissertation.\n\nYou will be expected to read quite extensively for seminars and supervisions, and also view films.\n\nAcademics who teach on the course change from year to year, but include:\n\nProfessor Andrew Klevan (Convenor)\n\nDr Reidar Due (Convenor)\n\nProfessor Nikolaj Lubecker\n\nProfessor Guido Bonsaver\n\nProfessor Margaret Hillenbrand\n\nProfessor Stephen Mullhall\n\nDr Rey Conquer\n\nDr Janina Schupp\n\nDr Alexandra Grieve\n\nSupervision\n\nStudents can expect three one hour supervisions with their dissertation supervisor in Trinity Term. The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Steering Committee for the MSt in Film Aesthetics, in consultation with faculties in the Humanities Division and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Humanities Division.\n\nAssessment\n\nAssessment is by three essays and a dissertation. The dissertation, written in the final term, provides an opportunity to work with a tutor in your chosen area of specialisation.\n\nGraduate destinations\n\nThe analytical skills taught in the course are applicable in a wide range of jobs concerned with film and visual media, for example film programming, film reviewing, film production, design and teaching. The course is especially suitable as a foundation for further scholarly research into film.\n\nChanges to this course and your supervision\n\nThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made in circumstances of a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.\n\nWhere possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.\n\nFor further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\n\nResources\n\nOpportunities for exchange are provided by the interdisciplinary communities fostered within individual colleges, which also offer you dedicated support by means of personal advisors. The Oxford Centre for Research in the Humanities (TORCH) offers a stimulating range of interdisciplinary activities.\n\nThe Oxford environment provides a unique opportunity to develop intellectual curiosity whilst remaining focused on one’s own work without becoming blinkered - an integral part of a successful graduate career.\n\nThe two main Bodleian Libraries Film Studies collections of books, journals and films are at the Taylor Institution Library and the English Faculty Library, with additional film studies books and periodical accommodated in the main Bodleian and its off-site book storage facility. The film collections are predominantly DVDs: currently the collection stands at approximately 8,000 films. All the DVDs from the major labels are acquired - Master's of Cinema, Criterion, Second Run, Artificial Eye. The Taylor Library hosts a viewing room for watching films, accommodating around six viewers and equipped with a flat screen television and Blu-ray player. There is also now a small designated area where film students can gather, sit and read the latest journals.\n\nBefore you apply\n\nOur guide to getting started provides general advice on how to prepare for and start your application.
