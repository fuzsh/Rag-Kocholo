        "text": "If you want to go up against someone with a wild but adventurous side there is always Vixen. Vixen is one of my top favorite characters from the DC universe overall and I think she deserves her own movie. Why? Well in regards to the African American society, she will be another black inspiration just like Black Panther. She has the looks and the brains and is someone who doesn't back down from a fight using her connections with the animals of her world. Vixen will be the first African female character to have her own movie based on the DC comics if this ever came to pass. Here is some background information...\n\nVixen is a fictional character that was created by Gerry Conway and Bob Oksner. She made her first debut appearance in Action Comic #521 which was published by DC comics. She is a superheroine in possession of the Tantu Totem, which allows her to harness the spirit of animals. Vixen can conjure the power and abilities of any animal past or present. She was intended to be the first African female superhero to star in her own series but the first issue was canceled in the DC Implosion in 1978 and was never to be released. Since her debut in Action Comics, she appeared in various incarnations of the Justice League and Suicide Squad.\n\nCharacter Bio: In West Africa on the ancient land of Ghana, the warrior Tantu asked Anansi the Spider to create a totem that would give all of the powers of the animal kingdom, only if someone uses the power to protect the innocent. Tantu used the totem in order to become Africa's first legendary hero. The totem was later passed on to Tantu's descendants until it reached the McCabes. Born and raised in a small village in the fictional nation of Zambesi, M'Changa province, Mari Jiwe McCabe heard of the legend \"Tantu Totem\" from her mother. Later on, her mother was killed by poachers and was then raised by her father Reverend Richard Jiwe, the village priest. Her father was also killed by his half-brother (Mari's uncle) General Maksai. Maksai wanted the totem in which Jiwe had possessed. Mari moved to America where she established her new identity as Mari McCabe and worked as a model in New York City. She used her wealth to travel the world. On arriving back in Africa, she took back the totem from her uncle, using the powers to become Vixen."
