        "text": "Louisa May Alcott probably didn't expect to start a media empire when she wrote Little Women. Since the novel was first published in 1868, the classic coming-of-age story about the four March sisters in Civil War-era Concord, MA has been adapted countless times.\n\nSome adaptations are lost forever, like a 1917 British silent film, three TV movies in the '40s, and a six-part BBC mini-series made in 1950 (the ones made in 1958, 1970, and 2017 remain). According to The New Yorker, between 1935 and 1950, there were 48 radio dramatizations of Little Women. Many musical adaptations remain legendary, but impossible to watch, like the 1955 London musical A Girl Call Jo, the 1964 off-Broadway musical Jo, or CBS's 1958 TV musical starring 's Florence Henderson as Meg March.\n\nBut fear not, Little Women fans: There are plenty of adaptations that haven't disappeared. Within the past two years alone, Little Women has been adapted for the screen three times. The latest—and most groundbreaking—version was written and directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird). More than any other version before it, Gerwig's film leans into the discussion of money and economic independence that's woven into the subtext of Alcott's novel.\n\nThat said, 2019's Little Women is not the first to make bold choices. Let's take a tour through Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy in all their possible variations.\n\nIn the history of feature films, Little Women was adapted early—and often. A now-lost version came out in the U.K. in 1917. Another premiered in the U.S. in 1918. Directed by Harley Knoles, Little Women was shot in Alcott's native Concord, MA, just like Gerwig's recent version.\n\nAdvertisements for the American film spoke to Little Women's ability to connect with women audiences: \"If you don't please the women, young and old, you don't prosper. Right? Louisa M. Alcott's novel, Little Women, is the story that has been read by more women than any other book ever published...it has been tested and has made good, as a book, as a play, and now as a moving picture.\"\n\nYou could say that watching George Cukor's 1933 Little Women is a lot like watching a star be born. Katharine Hepburn's performance as Jo, serious and yet somehow bursting with joie de vivre, solidified her as a movie star. Like Jo, Hepburn would also become an icon for independent women. Little Women was only Hepburn's fourth movie credit, though she'd go on to win the first of her four Oscars (for Morning Glory) the following year, in 1934.\n\nIn addition to putting Hepburn on the map, the first \"talkie\" version of Little Women was a critical and box office hit. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards in the categories for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, and won the latter.\n\nThough Hepburn fits the part perfectly, the rest of the movie's casting may seem odd to our present-day perspective. Everyone was so old. Amy, supposed to be 12, was played by a 23-year-old Joan Bennett, secretly pregnant at the time. Douglas Montgomery's Laurie certainly lacked boyishness, too.\n\nLittle Women is like the literary version of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in that it's an excuse for the biggest Hollywood talent to assemble for one project. The line-up for the 1949 movie is astonishing.\n\nOver a decade before screaming into the shower in Psycho, Janet Leigh played Meg in Little Women. Elizabeth Taylor—the legend herself—played Amy, the youngest sister. Margaret O'Brien, who rose to fame as a child actress in the '40s, played the ailing Beth. Later on in her career, June Allyson would be known for playing loyal wives—but in Little Women, she was Jo March: Brash, bold, and reluctant to marry. Unfortunately, the New York Times review said Allyson couldn't \"hold a bayberry candle to the Jo of Katharine Hepburn\" 15 years prior.\n\nThe 1949 version was a callback to the acclaimed 1933 movie, using the same script and music. But there was one major difference: The movie was in color."
