        "text": "Period dramas on Netflix are like our on-screen versions of comfort eating – they give us that warm, cosy feeling inside, perfect as a little escape from the current status quo. And who doesn't want a good dose of comfort at all times? We're hankering for days gone by, and period dramas are the perfect way to bask in the golden age.\n\nMaybe it's the corsets? The crowns? The ballgowns? Or even the strapping suitors in black-tie?! Whatever the reason, sometimes a dose of high society drama is exactly what we need for a bit of escapism.\n\nOf course, the period piece we've all been hooked on since 2020 is Bridgerton, set in Regency London with all its gossip, secrets and affairs (oh my!). But if, like us, you've already binge-watched the first two seasons, the best thing to check out is Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, hands down!\n\nAnd Bridgerton's much-awaited third season, with Nicola Coughlan at the forefront, is coming very soon.\n\nBut if you're craving another historical story before then, don't worry – there are plenty of perfect period dramas on Netflix.\n\nFirstly, there is the movie Elisa and Marcela, which is a must-watch story about forbidden love. Then there's The Wonder, which has Florence Pugh in it – you know it's going to be good! Maybe you want something a little, ahem… steamy? Then catch Lady Chatterley’s Lover, because Emma Corrin will have temperatures soaring. Then there's the absolute classic Little Women, which brought the tale of the March sisters' journey to womanhood to the big screen by Florence, Emma Watson, Eliza Scanlen and Saoirse Ronan.\n\nThe latter also stuck to her period roots by starring alongside Kate Winslet in the 2020 film Ammonite, a drama about forbidden love. Who remembers Mr Darcy and his white shirt stuck to his drenched body in Pride and Prejudice? Oh my.\n\nPlus, we can't forget the dramatised lives of the royal family in The Crown. There's also broody, topless Ross Poldark saving his Cornish miners above the roaring, rugged Cornish coast in Poldark. It's not all romance and misty moors, though. For something darker, try Alias Grace. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Margaret Atwood and based on real events, it tells the story of a psychiatrist in 19th century Canada who must decide whether murderer Grace Marks should be pardoned due to insanity. This is gripping stuff.\n\nSo, to step back in time, check out our 27 best period dramas on Netflix – both films and television shows – that are perfect for a spot of nostalgia."
