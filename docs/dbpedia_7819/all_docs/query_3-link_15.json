        "text": "Part I\n\nOn either side the river lie\n\nLong fields of barley and of rye,\n\nThat clothe the wold and meet the sky;\n\nAnd thro' the field the road runs by\n\nTo many-tower'd Camelot;\n\nThe yellow-leaved waterlily\n\nThe green-sheathed daffodilly\n\nTremble in the water chilly\n\nRound about Shalott.\n\nWillows whiten, aspens shiver.\n\nThe sunbeam showers break and quiver\n\nIn the stream that runneth ever\n\nBy the island in the river\n\nFlowing down to Camelot.\n\nFour gray walls, and four gray towers\n\nOverlook a space of flowers,\n\nAnd the silent isle imbowers\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nUnderneath the bearded barley,\n\nThe reaper, reaping late and early,\n\nHears her ever chanting cheerly,\n\nLike an angel, singing clearly,\n\nO'er the stream of Camelot.\n\nPiling the sheaves in furrows airy,\n\nBeneath the moon, the reaper weary\n\nListening whispers, ' 'Tis the fairy,\n\nLady of Shalott.'\n\nThe little isle is all inrail'd\n\nWith a rose-fence, and overtrail'd\n\nWith roses: by the marge unhail'd\n\nThe shallop flitteth silken sail'd,\n\nSkimming down to Camelot.\n\nA pearl garland winds her head:\n\nShe leaneth on a velvet bed,\n\nFull royally apparelled,\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nPart II\n\nNo time hath she to sport and play:\n\nA charmed web she weaves alway.\n\nA curse is on her, if she stay\n\nHer weaving, either night or day,\n\nTo look down to Camelot.\n\nShe knows not what the curse may be;\n\nTherefore she weaveth steadily,\n\nTherefore no other care hath she,\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nShe lives with little joy or fear.\n\nOver the water, running near,\n\nThe sheepbell tinkles in her ear.\n\nBefore her hangs a mirror clear,\n\nReflecting tower'd Camelot.\n\nAnd as the mazy web she whirls,\n\nShe sees the surly village churls,\n\nAnd the red cloaks of market girls\n\nPass onward from Shalott.\n\nSometimes a troop of damsels glad,\n\nAn abbot on an ambling pad,\n\nSometimes a curly shepherd lad,\n\nOr long-hair'd page in crimson clad,\n\nGoes by to tower'd Camelot:\n\nAnd sometimes thro' the mirror blue\n\nThe knights come riding two and two:\n\nShe hath no loyal knight and true,\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nBut in her web she still delights\n\nTo weave the mirror's magic sights,\n\nFor often thro' the silent nights\n\nA funeral, with plumes and lights\n\nAnd music, came from Camelot:\n\nOr when the moon was overhead\n\nCame two young lovers lately wed;\n\n'I am half sick of shadows,' said\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nPart III\n\nA bow-shot from her bower-eaves,\n\nHe rode between the barley-sheaves,\n\nThe sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,\n\nAnd flam'd upon the brazen greaves\n\nOf bold Sir Lancelot.\n\nA red-cross knight for ever kneel'd\n\nTo a lady in his shield,\n\nThat sparkled on the yellow field,\n\nBeside remote Shalott.\n\nThe gemmy bridle glitter'd free,\n\nLike to some branch of stars we see\n\nHung in the golden Galaxy.\n\nThe bridle bells rang merrily\n\nAs he rode down from Camelot:\n\nAnd from his blazon'd baldric slung\n\nA mighty silver bugle hung,\n\nAnd as he rode his armour rung,\n\nBeside remote Shalott.\n\nAll in the blue unclouded weather\n\nThick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather,\n\nThe helmet and the helmet-feather\n\nBurn'd like one burning flame together,\n\nAs he rode down from Camelot.\n\nAs often thro' the purple night,\n\nBelow the starry clusters bright,\n\nSome bearded meteor, trailing light,\n\nMoves over green Shalott.\n\nHis broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;\n\nOn burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;\n\nFrom underneath his helmet flow'd\n\nHis coal-black curls as on he rode,\n\nAs he rode down from Camelot.\n\nFrom the bank and from the river\n\nHe flash'd into the crystal mirror,\n\n'Tirra lirra, tirra lirra:'\n\nSang Sir Lancelot.\n\nShe left the web, she left the loom\n\nShe made three paces thro' the room\n\nShe saw the water-flower bloom,\n\nShe saw the helmet and the plume,\n\nShe look'd down to Camelot.\n\nOut flew the web and floated wide;\n\nThe mirror crack'd from side to side;\n\n'The curse is come upon me,' cried\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nPart IV\n\nIn the stormy east-wind straining,\n\nThe pale yellow woods were waning,\n\nThe broad stream in his banks complaining,\n\nHeavily the low sky raining\n\nOver tower'd Camelot;\n\nOutside the isle a shallow boat\n\nBeneath a willow lay afloat,\n\nBelow the carven stern she wrote,\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nA cloudwhite crown of pearl she dight,\n\nAll raimented in snowy white\n\nThat loosely flew (her zone in sight\n\nClasp'd with one blinding diamond bright)\n\nHer wide eyes fix'd on Camelot,\n\nThough the squally east-wind keenly\n\nBlew, with folded arms serenely\n\nBy the water stood the queenly\n\nLady of Shalott.\n\nWith a steady stony glance—\n\nLike some bold seer in a trance,\n\nBeholding all his own mischance,\n\nMute, with a glassy countenance—\n\nShe look'd down to Camelot.\n\nIt was the closing of the day:\n\nShe loos'd the chain, and down she lay;\n\nThe broad stream bore her far away,\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nAs when to sailors while they roam,\n\nBy creeks and outfalls far from home,\n\nRising and dropping with the foam,\n\nFrom dying swans wild warblings come,\n\nBlown shoreward; so to Camelot\n\nStill as the boathead wound along\n\nThe willowy hills and fields among,\n\nThey heard her chanting her deathsong,\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nA longdrawn carol, mournful, holy,\n\nShe chanted loudly, chanted lowly,\n\nTill her eyes were darken'd wholly,\n\nAnd her smooth face sharpen'd slowly,\n\nTurn'd to tower'd Camelot:\n\nFor ere she reach'd upon the tide\n\nThe first house by the water-side,\n\nSinging in her song she died,\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nUnder tower and balcony,\n\nBy garden wall and gallery,\n\nA pale, pale corpse she floated by,\n\nDeadcold, between the houses high,\n\nDead into tower'd Camelot.\n\nKnight and burgher, lord and dame,\n\nTo the planked wharfage came:\n\nBelow the stern they read her name,\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\nThey cross'd themselves, their stars they blest,\n\nKnight, minstrel, abbot, squire, and guest.\n\nThere lay a parchment on her breast,\n\nThat puzzled more than all the rest,\n\nThe wellfed wits at Camelot.\n\n'The web was woven curiously,\n\nThe charm is broken utterly,\n\nDraw near and fear not,—this is I,\n\nThe Lady of Shalott.'\n\nNotes:\n\nPublic Domain.\n\nLord Tennyson, Alfred, Works. London: Macmillan, 1891.\n\nSource: Works (Macmillan, 1891)"
