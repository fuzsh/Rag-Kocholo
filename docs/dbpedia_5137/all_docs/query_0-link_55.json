        "text": "Catfish Hunter, the Hall of Fame right-hander who helped pitch the Oakland A's and the Yankees to six pennants in the 1970's, hurled a perfect game and was part of an economic revolution in sports, died yesterday at his home at Hertford, N.C. He was 53.\n\nHe had been struggling for the last year with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the progressive and ultimately fatal neurological condition also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He had also been hospitalized after falling and hitting his head on concrete steps outside his home Aug. 8. He was sent home Saturday.\n\nHunter was a premier pitcher of his era, a 6-foot, 190-pounder who did not have overpowering speed but possessed outstanding control, an assortment of superb pitches and a winner's poise.\n\nHe won 224 games in 15 major league seasons from 1965 to 1979 and won at least 21 games over five consecutive seasons, from 1971 to 1974 with Oakland and in 1975 with the Yankees. He won the Cy Young Award as the American League's top pitcher in 1974 and was an eight-time All-Star. In compiling a record of 224-166, he had an outstanding career earned run average of 3.26."
