        "text": "Shortstop Derek Jeter staked New York to an early lead with a two-run homer to center off Kent Mercker in the first frame.\n\nJeter spurred another rally in the seventh inning against Derek Lowe. The Yankee shortstop reached on an error by third baseman John Valentin and advanced to second base. Paul O’Neill singled to right, setting up runners at the corners and chasing Lowe from the game. Bernie Williams coaxed a walk against Rheal Cormier to load the bases. The ensuing batter Chilli Davis reached on an error by second baseman Jose Offerman, enabling Jeter to score."
