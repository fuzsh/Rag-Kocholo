        "text": "WORDS By Justin Rodriguez PHOTOS BY GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe major-league pennant races are past the point of heating up. They're scorching.\n\nBaseball fans know this is when it really gets good, but even casual observers feel the energy around them and figure out it's time to pay attention to baseball.\n\nHistorically, baseball hasn't failed to deliver fascinating storylines, and as the final week begins, a spectacular stage is set.\n\n\"This is what everyone plays for,\" says Minnesota Twins star closer Joe Nathan, formerly of Circleville, who helped the Twins to the playoffs in 2004 and 2006 and San Francisco in 2003. \"It's like the last month of the season is the playoffs. It's exciting to see all these pennant races. I think it's the best time of the year for sports fans with the playoffs coming up and football season.\"\n\nThe Boys of Summer hope to play deep into the fall, and they get a whole extra bandwagon of fans along for the ride.\n\nOf course, most fans around here will be fixed on the Yankees and Mets.\n\n\"Considering all the stories, it's been fascinating,\" says ESPN \"Baseball Tonight\" analyst Tim Kurkjian. \"I've never seen a pennant race this close, this late, since they started the wild card.\"\n\nThis could end up being one of the best stretch runs in baseball history.\n\nHere is a look at some other great ones with plenty of Yankee and Met moments.\n\nBye, bye Boston\n\nBucky \"Bleepin'\" Dent. The so-called Boston Massacre. Ah, 1978, what a year for the Yankees.\n\nBut it didn't start so great. The Yankees trailed Boston by 14 games in the American League East in July. A four-game sweep of Boston on Sept. 10 at Fenway Park tied the Red Sox atop the standings.\n\nThe Yankees won a one-game playoff for the division on Oct. 2 on BBD's three-run homer over the Green Monster and went on to win the World Series.\n\nGive him the ball in a big game and Al Leiter usually was, well, \"Leits Out.\"\n\nHe didn't disappoint back in 1999 when the Mets needed him to punch their ticket into the playoffs.\n\nLeiter tossed a two-hitter to lead the Mets to a 5-0 win over the Cincinnati Reds in a one-game playoff for the National League wild card at Cinergy Field.\n\nIt was classic Leiter. He handcuffed Reds' hitters with a nasty cut fastball and threw 135 pitches — 77 for strikes. Cincinnati did not advance a runner to second base until the ninth inning.\n\nThe win put the Mets in the postseason for the first time in 11 seasons. They lost to Atlanta in the National League Championship Series.\n\nGeorge Steinbrenner wasn't happy — surprise, surprise — as the Yankees got off to one of their worst starts since the late 1980s.\n\nBut this was 2005. There were no Steve Balbonis, Wayne Tollesons and Mel Halls.\n\nInstead, Derek Jeter and the crew rebounded from an 11-19 start to go 95-67, finishing in a tie for the A.L. East with Boston. The Yankees won the division on a tiebreaker.\n\nBut Steinbrenner wasn't happy for long. The Yankees lost to the Angels in the A.L. Divisional Series.\n\nThey were the mediocre Mets, underdogs, a joke.\n\nAt the start of the 1969 season, that is.\n\nBy the end, the Amazins had put together one of the most unbelievable runs in baseball history.\n\nThe bumbling Mets started the year 21-23 and stood 10 games behind the first-place Chicago Cubs in August. But the Amazins won 38 of their last 49 games, putting up their first-ever winning season, while taking the division.\n\nThe Mets beat Atlanta in the N.L. Championship. For the final \"Miracle,\" they defeated another heavy favorite, Baltimore, in the World Series.\n\nThis collapse was far from Amazin'. In 1998, the Mets lost their last five games of the season.\n\nAs it turns out, just one win by the Mets would have forced a three-way wild-card tie with San Francisco and the Cubs. The Mets lost two games to Montreal at Shea Stadium and three at Atlanta.\n\nTwo years later, the Mets reached the World Series.\n\nOur local guy, Joe Nathan, and the Minnesota Twins seemed destined for disaster last season.\n\nThe Twins opened the season 25-33, but then the hatchet came down. Minnesota jettisoned unproductive veterans like Tony Batista and Kyle Lohse, replacing them with kids from Triple-A Rochester. The Twins went 9-1 after the moves and never slowed down.\n\nMinnesota clinched its fourth A.L. Central title in five years, overtaking Detroit on the last day of the season. It marked the first time in major-league history that a team clinched on the last day of the season after never having held sole possession of first place.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 1993 and it wasn't enough to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThat's because Atlanta came back from a 10-game deficit to win the N.L. West by a single game. Still, San Francisco could have forced a one-game playoff for the division with a win against rival Los Angeles on the last day of the season. The Dodgers dropped the Giants 12-1.\n\nMajor League Baseball adapted the wild-card format after the '93 season, leaving many baseball purists referring to San Francisco vs. Atlanta as the \"last pure pennant race.\"\n\nIt's no wonder fans in Philadelphia are so cynical.\n\nLeave it to the Phillies to blow a six-game lead in the National League with just 12 games to play.\n\nThat's what they did in 1964.\n\nPhiladelphia lost 10 games in a row, including a three-game set to St. Louis, which would win the pennant by one game.\n\nThe signature moment in Seattle's history came in 1995: Edgar Martinez doubles off Jack McDowell into the left-field corner.\n\nMartinez's rope plates Joey Cora and Ken Griffey Jr. scores all the way from first base in the 11th inning with the A.L. Divisional Series-winning run. Seattle 6, Yankees 5.\n\nBut the Mariners' magic started way back in August of that season. Seattle trailed the Angels by 13 games in the A.L. West, but the Mariners won 25 of their last 36 games, defeating the Angels in a one-game playoff for the division.\n\nThe battle for New York\n\nBobby Thomson's \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" concluded the New York Giants' comeback in 1951.\n\nThe Giants trailed their hated rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, by 13½ games in mid-August. But the Giants won 37 of their last 44 games to force a three-game playoff for the National League title. Thomson's shot in the ninth inning off Ralph Branca won Game 3.\n\nBack in 1948, the Yankees and Red Sox trailed first-place Cleveland by one game in the A.L heading into the final two games of the year.\n\nBoston swept the Yanks at Fenway and forced a playoff for the title with Cleveland, which split with Detroit. The Indians beat the Red Sox 8-3 in a one-game playoff at Fenway.\n\nHeading into September, Boston led the A.L., but three teams — Detroit, Minnesota and the Chicago White Sox — were within 2½ games in 1967.\n\nFor the entire month, the teams traded positions, from first to fourth. Boston eventually won the championship and lost to St. Louis in the World Series."
