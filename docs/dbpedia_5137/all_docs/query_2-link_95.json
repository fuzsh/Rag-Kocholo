        "text": "By all accounts, pitcher Dan Naulty had limited impact on the New York Yankees in 1999. Acquired in a trade with the Minnesota Twins after the 1998 season, Naulty made 33 regular-season relief appearances and compiled a 4.38 ERA. He didn’t take the mound at all in the 1999 World Series, when the Yankees swept the Atlanta Braves for their second straight championship. But in the hours after the series-clinching Game 4 victory, Naulty stared down his demons.\n\nNBC Sports’ Peter King wrote Monday about his Podcast of the Week: “Crushed,” by Joan Niesen for Religion of Sports and PRX. According to King, Naulty is one of the main voices in the third episode. Naulty had stopped using steroids by the time he arrived in New York, but his drug use left some pretty deep scars. Here’s what Naulty had to say about the night the Yankees won the 1999 Fall Classic.\n\nNaulty: About 7 o’clock in the morning, we get back in the limousine to go home. I told the limousine driver to please stop so I could get in the front seat with him. I just started talking to him about life, and is there more to life than this? We just won the World Series, and the streets aren’t paved gold, and I’m not riding on a cloud. I feel just as miserable now as I did before. And so we got to the George Washington Bridge and I told him to stop. You take them home, and I’m gonna jump. I said I’m done.\n\nAccording to King, Niesen explains why Naulty didn’t take the leap: “Traffic saved him. It was rush hour. The driver couldn’t have stopped if he wanted to.”\n\nNaulty: I was just crashing and burning. If the World Series and all the money and the New York Yankees isn’t going to fix my life, then nothing is gonna fix my life . . . Baseball was my god. It drove every decision I made. You do anything at all costs to experience your dream. Of course, I wasn’t experiencing my dream. I was experiencing hell.\n\nThe Yankees traded Naulty to the Los Angeles Dodgers after the 1999 postseason, but the right-hander never again stepped on a big-league mound. In four MLB seasons, he made 130 relief appearances and had a 4.54 ERA. According to King, Naulty now is a minister in Michigan.\n\nGet Yankees text messages: Cut through the clutter of social media and text during games with beat writers and columnists.
