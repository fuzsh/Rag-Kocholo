        "text": "The Pitcher Edition of the Stash List highlights the 10 best pitching prospects likely to make an impact during the 2024 season.\n\nProspects are often thought of as only holding value in dynasty formats. However, knowing which prospects hold value for the current season can help set you apart in redraft leagues. Several have a 2024 ETA and getting ahead of the curve on rostering these prospects is a key part of roster management. Last year we saw more pitching prospects make their debut than ever before and there is no reason we should expect to see anything change in 2024. Keep reading to find out the top ten pitchers you should stash in your redraft leagues.\n\nGround Rules\n\nThe Stash List is for your redraft leagues and does not consider impact beyond 2024.\n\nOnly current minor league players who are expected to make an impact this season are included.\n\nUpside, proximity, health, and opportunity are all weighed for each player.\n\nThe focus is on 12-team leagues with standard categories.\n\nRankings and rostership percentages will be updated weekly.\n\nStats will be updated weekly for all players through Thursday’s games.\n\nThe Stash List\n\nGraduates/Call-Ups\n\nMax Meyer finally got the call back to Miami after spending over three months toiling in Triple-A, then went out and served up three homers to the Braves on Thursday. The 25-year-old did have seven strikeouts and one walk in five innings but saw his ERA rise to 3.81 for the Marlins. Meyer has a home start against the Reds up next, so it’s a much better matchup to use him in if you held him out for the start at Atlanta.\n\nJoey Cantillo got a tough assignment for his MLB debut on Sunday, giving up three runs in 3.1 innings with three walks at Philadelphia. It doesn’t get much easier for the Indians left-hander in his second start – at home against the Orioles – before heading back on the road to face the Twins on Friday. Cantillo is best left on the bench in deep leagues until he shows that he can handle himself for when the matchups get easier.\n\nDodgers right-hander Bobby Miller doesn’t qualify for this list since he is no longer a prospect, but it’s worth noting that the 25-year-old can be stashed in any league where he got cut after the Dodgers sent him down to Triple-A on July 10. Miller tossed five scoreless innings in his first start for Oklahoma City on July 20 but turned in a stinker in his next start – six runs (five earned) with three walks in 3.2 innings. Miller still has time to get things turned around and could be an option to rejoin the Dodgers rotation down the stretch.\n\nTop 10 Pitching Prospects to Stash\n\n1. Jackson Jobe, RHP, Detroit Tigers\n\nPrevious Ranking: 1\n\n2024 MiLB (AA) stat line: 42.1 IP | 1.91 ERA | 30.6 K% | 14.5 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (A+) stat line: 9 IP | 2.00 ERA | 24.2 K% | 6.1 BB%\n\nJackson Jobe proved that he’s human in his last start on Thursday, allowing four walks and three runs in four innings for Double-A Erie. The 22-year-old posted a 0.83 ERA in July over four starts but has now issued nine free passes over his past two starts. had four hitless outings over his 12 starts this season. Considering that Jobe gave up just six walks in 64 innings last year, it’s a little worrisome that he has 27 in 51.1 frames this season.\n\nFor those stashing Jobe, it would be nice to see the Tigers bump him up to Triple-A so that we can dream of the No. 1 pitching prospect to reach the majors in mid-August. It’s beginning to look more likely that the Tigers slow roll their future ace and leave him in Double-A to build up his innings by pitching for Erie in the Eastern League playoffs. That could leave Jobe with just a start or two for Detroit at the tail end of the season. There’s Paul Skenes-type upside here, so Jobe is still worth stashing as a possible difference-maker down the stretch.\n\n2. Hayden Birdsong, RHP, San Francisco Giants\n\nPrevious Ranking: N/R\n\n2024 MLB Stat line: 30.1 IP | 2.97 ERA | 30.2 K% | 11.9 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (AAA) Stat line: 9 IP | 5.00 ERA | 33.4 K% | 14.3 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (AA) Stat line: 48.1 IP | 2.05 ERA | 30.7 K% | 10.1 BB%\n\nThe Giants cleared room in the rotation for Hayden Birdsong at the trade deadline by dealing Alex Cobb to the Guardians. The 22-year-old right-hander had been sent down to Triple-A after a 12-strikeout gem at Coors Field on July 21, then returned as the 27th man for a doubleheader with five scoreless innings against the Rockies last Saturday.\n\nNow the 6-foot-4, 215-pounder is expected to come back to the Giants for a start at Washington on Tuesday. Birdsong has carried a strikeout rate of at least 30% across three levels this season and will have the pitcher’s haven of Oracle Park to call home over the final two months. Birdsong may not have the fanfare of a Skenes or a Jobe, but he could produce at similar levels to what Jared Jones did for the Pirates over the first two months.\n\n3. Jacob Misiorowski, RHP, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nPrevious Ranking: 4\n\n2024 MiLB (AA) Stat line: 79.2 IP | 3.50 ERA | 30.3 K% | 14.4 BB%\n\nJacob Misiorowski tossed 3.2 scoreless innings on Sunday coming off his worst start of the season in his previous outing. It was enough to earn the 6-foot-7 flamethrower a promotion to Triple-A Nashville. The 22-year-old held opponents to a .121 batting average in July, but he’s back to battling control problems in his past two starts (nine walks in seven innings).\n\nIf Misiorowski can get back on track in Nashville as he had over a seven-start stretch (10 walks in 33.1 innings) before his last two outings, he could be up in Milwaukee for the pennant race. If he can crank out a couple of six-inning starts while limiting the free passes, Misiorowski could jump into the Brewers rotation, otherwise, the fallback is that he joins the Milwaukee bullpen in September.\n\n4. Bubba Chandler, RHP, Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nPrevious Ranking: 5\n\n2024 MiLB (AA) Stat line: 80.1 IP | 3.70 ERA | 29.9 K% | 8.4 BB%\n\nBubba Chandler had been slowing down after a scintillating stretch before the All-Star break, but the 21-year-old bounced back with seven dominant innings on Friday in Double-A. The 6-foot-2, 200-pounder held Richmond to three hits and one run with seven strikeouts and no walks.\n\nChandler is at 80.1 innings this season after 111 frames last year, so there could be about 50 innings left in his arm this season. With the Pirates just a few games out of the NL Wild Card race, they could turn to Chandler to give the rotation a boost after not adding a starter at the trade deadline.\n\n5. Brandon Sproat, RHP, New York Mets\n\nPrevious Ranking: 8\n\n2024 MiLB (AA) Stat line: 62.1 IP | 2.45 ERA | 35.6 K% | 5.3 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (A+) Stat line: 25.1 IP | 1.07 ERA | 32.4 K% | 15.7 BB%\n\nBrandon Sproat dazzled with 13 strikeouts in five scoreless innings on Friday for Double-A Binghamton, allowing just two hits and no walks. The 23-year-old had slowed down in July with a 4.60 ERA over three starts (albeit with 21 strikeouts in 15.2 innings), but came out in August with all guns blazing.\n\nThe Mets added Paul Blackburn to the rotation at the trade deadline, but their rotation is lacking someone with ace-type stuff like Sproat has. The 6-foot-3, 215-pounder hits triple-digits with his fastball, but control was supposed to be his bugaboo as just a second-round pick last year. Having issued just 15 walks in 62.1 innings in Double-A, Sproat looks dialled in and could be a big-time weapon down the stretch if the Mets choose to deploy him.\n\n6. Zebby Matthews, RHP, Minnesota Twins\n\nPrevious Ranking: 3\n\n2024 MiLB (AAA) stat line: 14 IP | 7.07 ERA | 29.4 K% | 0.0 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (AA) stat line: 55.1 IP | 1.95 ERA | 30.1 K% | 2.9 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (A+) stat line: 22.2 IP | 1.59 ERA | 33.3 K% | 0.0 BB%\n\nZebby Matthews is getting tested in Triple-A after ripping through High-A and Double-A with sub-2.00 ERAs. The 24-year-old control artist has an 18-0 K-BB in 14 innings for St. Paul, but he’s been touched for 22 hits, three homers and 11 runs over three starts. The 6-foot-5, 225-pounder has compiled an amazing 109-6 K-BB in 92 innings across three levels this season.\n\nIf Matthews can get his ERA and WHIP to start matching up with his peripherals over his next few starts in Triple-A, he could be an option to join the Twins if David Festa struggles at the back of the rotation or if an injury occurs. It’s a crapshoot whether Matthews can reach Minnesota in time to help fantasy managers, but he could be a WHIP weapon with a good chance for wins on a contender down the stretch.\n\n7. Chayce McDermott, RHP, Baltimore Orioles\n\nPrevious Ranking: 6\n\n2024 MLB Stat line: 4 IP | 6.75 ERA | 16.7 K% | 11.1 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (AAA) Stat line: 97 IP | 3.90 ERA | 32.7 K% | 13.4 BB%\n\nChayce McDermott racked up 10 strikeouts in six innings for Triple-A Norfolk on Wednesday in his first outing after a spot start for the Orioles on July 24. The 25-year-old leads Triple-A with 139 strikeouts but also has the third-most walks with 57.\n\nThe Orioles fortified their rotation at the deadline by acquiring Zach Eflin and Trevor Rogers. But Rogers got knocked around in his first start for Baltimore and Dean Kremer has been struggling some at the back of the rotation. With a chance to get starts down the stretch for a World Series contender, McDermott is still worth stashing where you have room.\n\n8. AJ Smith-Shawver, RHP, Atlanta Braves\n\nPrevious Ranking: N/R\n\n2024 MLB Stat line: 4.1 IP | 0.00 ERA | 22.2 K% | 11.1 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (AAA) Stat line: 42.1 IP | 5.53 ERA | 27 K% | 12.4 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (A+) Stat line: 2 IP | 4.50 ERA | 57.1 K% | 0.0 BB%\n\nAJ Smith-Shawver strained his left oblique in his first start of the season with the Braves on May 23, so he’s been ineligible for this list while he was on the IL. But he was activated from the IL and optioned to Triple-A Gwinnett, so he is back to being a stash candidate. The 21-year-old right-hander ramped up to 84 pitches in his last outing and struck out seven in four innings, but he gave up three solo homers.\n\nThe Braves are patching it together in their injury-ravaged rotation with 28-year-old rookie Grant Holmes making his first career start on Monday. The door is open for AJSS to get starts for the Braves as they try to chase down the Phillies in the NL East in the final two months.\n\n9. Caden Dana, RHP, Los Angeles Angels\n\nPrevious Ranking: N/R\n\n2024 MiLB (AA) Stat line: 111.1 IP | 2.91 ERA | 27.7 K% | 7.5 BB%\n\nCaden Dana is on fire in Double-A, where the Angels have never been shy to reach down to bring prospects up to the majors. The 20-year-old right-hander has a 34-3 K-BB with a 2.33 ERA in 27 innings over his past four starts for the Rocket City Trash Pandas. The 6-foot-4, 215-pounder bears an uncanny resemblance to Noah Syndergaard with his flowing blonde locks, although he doesn’t have the same 100-mph velocity that Thor had before Tommy John surgery sapped his stuff.\n\nDana is up to 111.1 innings after reaching just 68.1 last season, so we may be coming up on a shutdown for the Angels’ top pitching prospect. But he’s coming off seven scoreless innings on the heels of a complete game, so it doesn’t look like the Angels are slowing him down just yet. It could be worth a quick stash to see if the Angels bring him up to L.A. to finish off whatever his innings cap is in the majors.\n\n10. Will Warren, RHP, New York Yankees\n\nPrevious Ranking: N/R\n\n2024 MLB Stat line: 5.1 IP | 6.75 ERA | 26.1 K% | 8.7 BB%\n\n2024 MiLB (AAA) Stat line: 95.2 IP | 6.11 ERA | 27.1 % | 8.2 BB%\n\nIt’s easy to look at Will Warren’s 6.11 ERA in Triple-A and think there must not be much here. And when he got a spot start for the Yankees on Tuesday, he allowed four runs in 5.1 innings. But the 25-year-old had been hot in July, posting a 2.91 ERA with 30-6 K-BB in 21.2 innings for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The 6-foot-2, 175-pounder put up a 3.61 ERA with 110 strikeouts in 99.2 innings last year in Triple-A, so he’s about fully cooked.\n\nHaving pitched 129 innings last year and sitting at 95.2 this season, he could have 50-60 innings left in his right arm if needed. The Yankees failed to acquire any starting pitching at the deadline, so Warren could step into the rotation if Nestor Cortes continues to struggle or if there are any injuries.\n\nOn The Bubble"
