        "text": "The New York Yankees have been recognized for their championships and superstars over the past 100 years. Babe Ruth hit booming home runs and set eternal records and Mickey Mantle dashed across the outfield, dazzling the world with his effortless ability.\n\nWhat can sometimes go unnoticed are the pitchers in pinstripes. Unlike the Atlanta Braves, who built their current legacy on Hall-of-Fame pitching, the Yankees have done it with their bats. Without their pitching, however, the Bombers would have significantly fewer championships.\n\nThe question is, who is the best of all time?\n\nWell, here they are, the 25 greatest pitchers the Yankees have ever had, ordered from back to front.\n\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s were the doldrums of the Yankees’ history, when consistently bad teams made annual appearances near the bottom of the standings. In the middle of this disaster was Fritz Peterson, a left-handed starter who pitched nine seasons for the Yankees from 1966-74 (he only played three games for them in 1974).\n\nThough his record was only 109-106, Peterson managed to only have two losing seasons while in New York, and never had an ERA over 4.00. Peterson retired shortly after leaving the Yankees, and it would have been interesting to see how effective he would have been on the more successful teams that followed him.\n\nWhen baseball historians hear the year 1927, their first thought might be the Yankees and one of the best teams of all time. The team was led by Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, who hit a combined 107 home runs.\n\nWhat might be hidden behind this firepower is starter Waite Hoyt, who put together one of the better careers in pinstripes.\n\nHoyt went 157-98 with the Yankees, winning three World Series (1923, '27, '28). His most known role might have been as the best pitcher on that 1927 team, leading the staff to a title. His win total is ninth on the team’s all-time list, and being in the top 10 in any Yankees statistic is superb.\n\nMaybe considered the best Yankee pitcher to never win a World Series, Mike Mussina came one year after their 2000 championship and retired one year before their 2009 ring.\n\nTheir lack of World Series titles was far from his responsibility.\n\nIn those eight seasons, Mussina compiled a 123-72 record and a 3.88 ERA, and was most likely the best pitcher on the team in that time period (2001-08).\n\n\"The Moose\" was oh-so-close to many milestones. He was one out away from a perfect game in 2001, one win away from a World Series title in that same year and was one win away from a 20-win season twice.\n\nThankfully for Mussina, he reached 20 wins in his final season, which was arguably his best. He finished his career with 270 wins and only 153 losses. If he is not elected to the Hall of Fame, he will have the best winning percentage of any pitcher who is not in Cooperstown.\n\nThere are many revolutionary moments in sports. Sparky Lyle was definitely part of one, turning the reliever into an asset that could be called upon out of desire, not necessity.\n\nLyle appeared in at least 50 games in almost every season for the Yankees (he was on the team from 1972-78, but appeared in 49 games in ’75).\n\nLyle ended up going 57-40 with a 2.14 ERA in 420 appearances, helping the team win two World Series titles in 1977-78. He was part of the Bronx Zoo, but was a calming presence in the middle and end of games for the team for many years.\n\nIf we could look ten years into the future, C.C. Sabathia would probably be near the top of this list. In just three seasons with the team Sabathia has accomplished so much, throwing his way to a 59-28 record and winning one title.\n\nAssuming he will continue a similar pace for years to come, it is hard to not put Sabathia higher on the Yankees’ all time leader board. If he plays for 10 more seasons with the team, the big lefty will more-than-likely eclipse 300 wins with the Yankees, making him one of the team’s greatest pitchers ever.\n\nHis name may now be tarnished and his legacy broken, but Roger Clemens will still go down as one of the greatest pitchers to ever play the game.\n\nOn the way to his 354-184 career record, “The Rocket” spent five-plus seasons with the Yankees (1999-2003, '07), getting 83 of those wins and only 42 losses.\n\nHe helped the team to two titles in 1999 and 2000, and nearly a third in 2003. That season also marked his 300th win, and his alleged retirement after a glorious career. He did, however, return to baseball for three seasons with the Houston Astros.\n\nIn 2007, Clemens came back to the Yankees in grand fashion mid-way through the year. The savior was nothing special, and was linked shortly after to many allegations of steroid use, of which he is still a part.\n\nRegardless of his poor image today, he was still a tremendous pitcher for the Yankees during their most recent dynasty.\n\nIf Allie Reynolds can say he was a part of five straight World Series championships, so can right-hander Vic Raschi, and he might have been even better.\n\nShadowed behind Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Phil Rizzuto and Joe DiMaggio, Raschi put together one of the more impressive careers in Yankees history.\n\nHe pitched eight seasons with the Yankees (1946-53), with a 120-50 record and a 3.58 ERA, never charting a losing season for the team.\n\nHis rookie year, 1946, and 1948 were the only two seasons in which Raschi didn’t win the World Series. And, as mentioned before, the righty was part of the five-peat from 1949-53. During that time he went 90-40, including three 21-win seasons in a row from ’49-’51, an extremely impressive tally.\n\nEver wondered why crowds clap with two strikes on a batter? The answer would be because of Ron Guidry.\n\nAs he compiled strikeout after strikeout one game, the crowd grew anxious for the next one and began cheering him on. He didn’t disappoint, finishing with 18, an all-time Yankees record for one game.\n\nNamed “Louisiana Lightning,” Guidry spent his entire career with the Yankees. He went 170-92 with a 3.29 ERA from 1975-88, leading the team to two championships in ’77 and ’78. Many of his seasons were great, but none compare to his 1978 season, in which he went an incredible 25-3 with an almost-invisible 1.88 ERA.\n\nThe lefty’s mix of a strong fastball and one of the best sliders ever made him a devastating pitcher. Though he didn’t make the Hall of Fame, he was promptly honored in Yankee Stadium’s Monument Park with a plaque and a retired number.\n\nHe may have won four rings as a coach in the 1990s with the Yankees, but Mel Stottlemyre was a great pitcher decades before that.\n\nHe was one of the youngest pitchers to ever start a Game 7 of the World Series (1964). It was the closest he got to a championship, losing to legendary hurler Bob Gibson in St. Louis.\n\nStottlemyre was part of some of the worst Yankees’ teams ever, but still managed to assemble a great career.\n\nThe righty finished his 11-season career with a 164-139 record, including three 20-win seasons (’65, ’68, ’69). He is high on many all-time pitching charts for the Bombers, including seventh in wins, tenth in ERA, fourth in starts and third in innings pitched.\n\nHe is one of the better pitchers to never win a ring for the team, but that doesn’t diminish his great career.\n\nIt took until the 21st century for Red Ruffing’s number to be retired by the Yankees, and that was frankly 50 years too long. Charles Ruffing was undoubtedly the best pitcher in the team’s first five decades, leading the team to six titles during his career with the Bombers (1931-'46).\n\nRuffing is second all-time in wins at 231, third in starts, fifth in appearances and second in innings pitched. The shoo-in Hall-of-Famer was a tremendous talent for New York for many seasons, which makes it hard to not give Ruffing the bronze one the all-time list.\n\nSimply put, Edward Charles “Whitey” Ford was the best starter the Yankees ever had, and one of the best pitchers to ever live. His numbers speak for themselves. During his career, which lasted from 1950-'66 (excluding the ’51 and ’52 seasons), Ford was consistently the best pitcher in the world.\n\nExcepting his rookie season and final year, Ford won at least 10 games each season. His highest ERA was 3.24 in 1965, one of only four seasons in which he rose above 3.00. Ford lost 10 or more games only twice (1959, '65), and had as many 20-win seasons.\n\n“The Chairman of the Board” won six titles with the team, and it would have been eight if he were on the team in 1951-52.\n\nHis 10-8, 2.71 ERA postseason career is impressive, but more impressive still because it was only in World Series games. Ford had a career worthy of any all-time award, and a second-place rank on this list.\n\nIt is tough to limit Mariano Rivera to the best pitcher in Yankees history because he might be the best pitcher in all of baseball history.\n\nGranted, he does not have the most wins or innings, and never had the best stuff, but Rivera changed the game like no other player before him. Like Michael Jordan in basketball, he made teams adjust to him, forcing them to find a player of a similar caliber to compete with him.\n\nBehind Rivera's humble nature and big smile is in fact the Yankees’ greatest pitcher ever.\n\nHe holds records for both the team and the sport, some of which may never be broken. His 603 saves are the most all-time in the major leagues, and nearly 400 more than Dave Righetti, who ranks second in that category for the Yankees.\n\nHis career 2.21 ERA is by far the team’s best number ever, as are his 1,042 appearances, more than double Righetti’s 522 in second place.\n\nWhat makes Rivera even more legendary is his postseason career. He is 8-1, which is very good, but is pedestrian compared to his other statistics. His 42 career postseason saves are easily the most ever, and his 0.70 ERA is the lowest ever.\n\nUnlike most every other pitcher on this list, Rivera is still going. He posted 44 saves in 2011 with a 1.91 ERA at 41 years old. When he retires, he will be considered the best player ever to play his position, something only he can say in baseball history.\n\nWay to go, Mo."
