        "text": "After Hideki Irabu spun a gem to win the series against the Detroit Tigers at home on the first day of July, the Yankees saw another American League opponent come to town in the form of the Baltimore Orioles. While the ‘99 Orioles weren’t nearly as strong a team as the O’s of the present day (or the edition that nearly won the pennant just two years prior), there were still a few key players to keep an eye on, and the Yankees made sure to do that in the opener of a four-game set.\n\nJuly 2: Yankees 2, Orioles 1 (box score)\n\nRecord: 48-29 (1st, 3.0 GA)\n\nWith the Yankees starting David Cone on the mound at home against a team already 13 games under .500, there was the potential for a gem from the get-go. And the fans in attendance in the Bronx were treated to one — even though Coney’s next start at the original Yankee Stadium turned out to be much more memorable.\n\nNeither of the teams was able to break through in the first two innings. The second inning did see the Orioles leave three men on against Cone after a bases-loaded, two-out jam that he managed to escape. Meanwhile the Yankees stranded two runners against righty Jason Johnson, with both teams having their baserunners reach via a single and a walk (the Orioles’ third baserunner reached on an error).\n\nBut while Cone blanked the O’s in the top of the third, Johnson couldn’t keep the Yankees down in the home half.\n\nThe top of the order began the third with Chuck Knoblauch grounding out to shortstop, but Derek Jeter quickly followed by shooting a line drive into center field for a single. Paul O’Neill grounded out, pushing Jeter into scoring position. That gave Bernie Williams the perfect opportunity to capitalize, and he did. With two outs and Jeter running on contact, Williams swatted a single to short left field to score the Yankee shortstop.\n\nWith Tino Martinez up to bat and still two outs in the inning, Williams stole second base. He was off and moving again on a line-drive single to center by Tino, plating Bernie to double the lead. Chili Davis grounded out to first base to end the inning, but the Yankees carried a 2-0 lead and would try to hold on for the rest of the game.\n\nDespite allowing a hit or two every inning for the rest of the outing, Cone pitched into the top of the sixth inning, where he ended up giving up a lone run following a Jeff Conine double to left field and a Cal Ripken Jr. single to center field that brought Conine across home. Cone finished the sixth inning without any other damage, ending his day with a quality start.\n\nRamiro Mendoza entered in relief of Cone in the top of the seventh and face the minimum. He would also face two batters in the top of the eighth inning before being pulled for Mike Stanton, who earned one swinging strikeout. That was all before Mariano Rivera came in to finish the job.\n\nThe Orioles’ starter, Johnson, not only continued to pitch into the sixth inning, but after a perfect frame, he also trotted out to the mound for the seventh and faced the minimum batters before being exchanged for a bullpen arm. In the bottom of the eighth, Rocky Coppinger entered the ballgame, allowed a walk, forced a fly ball to left field, and then walked another batter before being removed from the game for Jesse Orosco, who forced a double play.\n\nRivera lived up to the hype in the top of the ninth inning. He came in to face batters nine, one, and two in the Orioles’ order. Eleven pitches later, it was all over, accomplished by the Sandman without a sweat. Charles Johnson went down swinging, Brady Anderson rolled over on a grounder to second, and Mike Bordick flew out to end the game, pushing the Yankees to a 2-1 victory over their AL East foe."
