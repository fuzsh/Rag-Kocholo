        "text": "The Yankees did their part -now it’s up to the Mets.\n\nThe Bombers finished off the Red Sox 6-1 in Boston last night to seize their 36th American League pennant and earn a shot at a repeat World Series championship.\n\nThat leaves New York’s baseball straphangers cheering for the Mets to beat the Braves and bring the first subway series to the Big Apple in more than four decades.\n\n“Hallelujah!” said Kyle Faget, 25, a Yankee fan who was in the stands on a chilly night at Fenway Park in Boston.\n\n“I’d like to see them play the Mets [in the World Series]. That would be fun for New York!”\n\nSean McLellan, 18, from New Jersey, said, “The Yankees are going to another World Series, baby!”\n\nCatia Eusebio, 18, from Westchester, said, “I’ve been screaming all night!\n\n“We’re looking for our 25th World Series banner! I would love to see a subway series. Then no one could touch New York.”\n\nThe Yanks won the league championship series over the Red Sox four games to one.\n\nThey jumped out to an early lead with a Derek Jeter two-run homer in the first inning – and with masterful Cuban righty Orlando “El Duque” Hernandez on the mound the pinstripers never looked back.\n\nA day after irate Boston fans pelted the Yanks on the field with bottles and debris, a statement was made over the stadium loudspeaker urging fans to behave.\n\nFenway was flooded with cops, who lined up in front of the stands between innings.\n\nThe World Series starts on Saturday at the home field of the National League pennant winner – either the Mets or the Braves.\n\nThe Mets, trailing 3-2 in the National League playoffs, face a do-or-die game in Atlanta tonight.\n\nAfter a pair of Amazin’ wins at Shea Stadium, the Mets need two more victories on the road to bring about the first subway series since 1956 – when the Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nBig Apple fans are frantic to see their fantasies become reality.\n\n“I feel great!” said Fenway Yankee rooter Chris Bigliardieri, 32, from Connecticut – who’s praying for an all-New York World Series.\n\n“I hate the Mets and I want to beat them.”\n\nMeanwhile in Manhattan at the ESPN Zone sports bar in Times Square, Yank fans were in a frenzy.\n\n“We’re halfway to a subway series!” said Alex Robson, 30, a Manhattan equities trader.\n\n“It makes the city so much more fun. I’m just really psyched,” Robson said.\n\n“The bats are on fire. Yankees number one!”\n\nMichael Tolani, 21, a Queens student, said, “Watching today’s game I know there’s going to be a subway series.\n\n“It’s meant to be. We wouldn’t come so close if it wasn’t meant to be,” Tolani said.\n\n“It’s time to provide the Mets with the same support we’ve given the Yankees.\n\n“If you hate them or you love them, it’s all about New York, not team allegiances. It’s about the city.”\n\nBrooklynite Mike Caccioppoli, 28, who works for a radio station, was also subway series dreaming.\n\n“I always find myself rooting against the Mets but not this year,” Caccioppoli said.\n\n“Now I’m pulling for them. Now that the Yankees are headed to the Series I can sit back and relax and root for the Mets over the next couple of games.\n\n“But if the Mets make it, it’s war. After that I go back to hating them,” he said."
