        "text": "The Toyota NHRA U.S. Nationals is filled with history, and there’s no denying the 1990s were loaded with an incredible number of legacy-making events. From first-time wins to final Indy wins, to a run of dominance to incredibly heart-warming stories, this decade of the Big Go had it all.\n\nThis year, the world’s biggest drag race turns 70, as the 70th annual Toyota NHRA U.S. Nationals takes place Aug. 28-Sept. 2 at Lucas Oil Indianapolis Raceway Park. To get to this historical moment, the magic of the Big Go and winning on the sport’s grandest stage grew throughout each decade, and the 1990s were no different.\n\nNearly every year in the 1990s had something significant, but the decade clearly belonged to Pro Stock’s “Professor,” Warren Johnson. He first won Indy in 1984 but didn’t taste victory again at the race until 1992. From there, though, he was nearly unbeatable, winning for four straight years to cement his legacy as one of the greatest drivers and minds in NHRA history. He finished off the decade with a thriller, defeating his former crew chief, Greg Anderson, who was about to unleash his own historical run.\n\nThat year, though, belonged to Johnson, as the teacher defeated the student in the final round in 1999, Johnson’s sixth and final Indy victory. Almost magically, Anderson’s 100th career win came 23 years later in Indy, and it was also his seventh at the Big Go, breaking a longtime tie with his former boss.\n\nAs Johnson was cementing his iconic status, John Force was building his as the 1990s opened. His five U.S. Nationals victories are tied with Ed McCulloch for the most in Funny Car history, and McCulloch’s final Funny Car win in Indy came in 1990. Force’s first came in 1993, finally cashing in by defeating Kenji Okazaki, who was the first Japanese driver to reach an NHRA final, in the championship round. He added two more Indy wins that decade – 1996 and 1998 – as Force was well on his way to becoming the biggest name in the sport.\n\nAfter the tragic passing of Blaine Johnson during a crash at the 1996 event, there were a pair of heart-warming stories the next two years featuring Blaine’s brother, crew chief Alan Johnson. He tuned Jim Head to the Top Fuel winner’s circle in 1997, making Head one of just a handful of drivers to win in both nitro cars. The next year, Johnson tuned Gary Scelzi to his lone nitro win at the Big Go.\n\nEarlier in the decade, Connie Kalitta finally picked up his long-awaited Indy win at 56 years old, defeating 58-year-old Eddie Hill in the 1994 Top Fuel final round. Funny Car’s Cruz Pedregon enjoyed a remarkable four-year run early in his career in Indy as well, winning three times from 1992-1995, including back-to-back years in ’94 and ’95. In 1992, it was a McDonald’s double-up, as Pedregon won in Funny Car, while McCulloch won in Top Fuel, giving the legend his sixth – and final – Indy triumph as a driver.\n\nOther highlights included Joe Amato’s last Indy win in 1990 (Top Fuel), Kenny Bernstein’s 1991 Top Fuel victory (to give him the Indy nitro double), a pair of Cory McClenathan Top Fuel wins, Pat Austin’s 1993 Top Fuel win, which came two years after he was runner-up to Bernstein after winning the event’s Top Alcohol Funny Car title a few minutes earlier, and Larry Dixon winning in 1995 in his stellar rookie season. Dave Schultz also claimed four wins in Pro Stock Motorcycle in the 1990s, including three straight from 1992-1994.\n\nThe look at the 2000s comes next, as Anderson came into his own, while Tony Schumacher’s amazing Indy run started in 2000. He currently has an NHRA-record 10 U.S. Nationals victories, with the bulk of that success coming during his unforgettable 2000s run of success.\n\nThis year, the 70th annual Toyota NHRA U.S. Nationals promises to be one of the biggest in the illustrious history of the Big Go. It features the final Mission #2Fast2Tasty NHRA Challenge of the year and the Pep Boys NHRA Funny Car All-Star Callout, as well as the special Sox & Martin Hemi Challenge presented by the McCandless Collection and the Rooftec Comp Cash Clash, along with racing in the NHRA Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series, Congruity NHRA Pro Mod Drag Racing Series presented by LearnEV+, Flexjet NHRA Factory Stock Showdown, and Holley NHRA EFI Factory X, plus:\n\nA special 70th anniversary NHRA U.S. Nationals pennant for the first 8,000 fans in attendance for eliminations on Monday, Sept. 2\n\nFree parking for all fans and children 12-under admitted free\n\nAn unforgettable Top Eliminator Club experience, including NHRA driver appearances, food and drink, TEC gift bag, starting-line seats, and much more\n\nThe biggest field in drag racing; last year, more than 900 cars competed in Indy\n\nAll the greats have forged their legacies through their Indy success, and it’s a list that also includes current stars like Schumacher, Force, Antron Brown, Ron Capps, Anderson, Erica Enders, Doug Kalitta, and Matt Hagan.\n\nLast year, Brown (Top Fuel), Capps (Funny Car), Matt Hartford (Pro Stock), and Matt Smith (Pro Stock Motorcycle) all won, with Brown, Capps, and Smith winning in Indy for the second straight year. This year’s race will again be broadcast on FOX and FS1, including eliminations on FOX at 2 p.m. ET on Monday, Sept. 2.\n\nKalitta currently leads the Top Fuel ranks, while Austin Prock’s debut season in Funny Car has been a huge success as he leads the way. Dallas Glenn is the Pro Stock points leader, while Gaige Herrera has six wins to his credit in Pro Stock Motorcycle. Other stars to watch include Top Fuel’s Justin Ashley, Brittany Force, Shawn Langdon, and racing legend Tony Stewart, who will make his Indy Top Fuel debut, Funny Car’s Bob Tasca III and J.R. Todd, Pro Stock’s Aaron Stanfield and Troy Coughlin Jr., and Pro Stock Motorcycle’s Chase Van Sant and Jianna Evaristo.\n\nNHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series qualifying will feature one round at 6:45 p.m. ET on Friday, Aug. 30, two rounds at noon and 2:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, Aug. 31, and the final two rounds of qualifying on Sunday, Sept. 1 at noon and 3 p.m. Final eliminations are scheduled for 10 a.m. ET on Monday, Sept 2.\n\nThe first round of the Pep Boys Funny Car All-Star Callout takes place at 1:05 p.m. ET on Sunday, Sept. 1, with the semifinals at 2:40 p.m. and the final round at 4:30 p.m. A special broadcast of the Callout takes place on FOX at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday."
