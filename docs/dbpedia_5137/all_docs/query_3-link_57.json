        "text": "MVP\n\nOVR: 18\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2008\n\n2010 in OBA\n\nMelbournes Australasia League dynasty showed no signs of slowing down with a 113-49 record, leading in both runs scored (823) and fewest allowed (558). Their closest competitor was Auckland at 89-73, 24 games back. The 113 wins for the Mets was the second-most in AL history, one game behind their 2008 effort. They also set a new AL record for walks drawn at 541. Melbournes defense was also excellent with four Gold Glove winners (SS, LF, CF, RF).\n\nThis was Melbournes eighth consecutive pennant. Only two other franchises in all of pro baseball history had won their subleague title eight years in a row. Kano of West Africa Baseball (1997-2005) and Ahmedabad of South Asia Baseball (1994-2002) both had nine year streaks.\n\nInterestingly enough, third place Canberra (85-77) had both the MVP and Pitcher of the Year in the Australasia League. They both led the Centurions to their first winning season since joining OBA in the 2006 expansion. Canberra was only three years removed from an all-time worst 44-118 in 2007.\n\nRepeating as MVP was RF Merlin Megson. The 24-year old Englishman led in hits (203), home runs (50), total bases (416), average (.340), slugging (.697), OPS (1.076), wRC+ (198), and WAR (8.3). Megsons 120 RBI fell two short of a Triple Crown season. Canberra signed him to an eight-year, $36,780,000 extension prior to the 2010 season.\n\nLucas Jimenez was Pitcher of the Year in his third year for the Centurions. The 25-year old Spaniard led in ERA (2.59), innings (323), complete games (15), FIP- (66), and WAR (10.3). Jimenez had a 21-14 record, 370 strikeouts, and 147 ERA+. Sadly, this was his final full season as numerous major injuries would plague him in the next few seasons.\n\nGuadalcanal ended a 32-year Pacific League title drought, dominating the field at 113-49. The Green Jackets set an OBA record offensively with a team .499 slugging percentage, which still remains the all-time top mark. They had 856 runs scored, the third-highest in PL history. It was Guadalcanals sixth pennant (1961, 1964, 1966, 1968, 1977, 2010), but they hadnt been a legit contender in decades.\n\nTahiti was a distant second at 99-63, followed by defending PL champ Guam at 97-65. Port Moresby was fourth at 89-73 and posted the second most hits in PL history with 1583. Even with the hits, they were still third in runs scored in the league.\n\nPacific League MVP went to third-year Port Moresby left fielder Suliano Nadruku. The 25-year old Fijian lefty led in hits (224), average (.367), OBP (.402), OPS (1.035), wRC+ (184), and WAR (9.5). He added 34 home runs, 37 doubles, and 102 RBI. He beat out Honolulus Max Dhong for the award despite Dhongs 66 home runs and 127 RBI. That fell three short of Vavao Brighouses nice single-season record of 69.\n\nFijis Akira Brady won Pitcher of the Year in his third season. This fully introduced the left-handed New Zealander to the big stage and started an all-time great run of dominance. The 23-year old lefty led in ERA (2.74), strikeouts (444), quality starts (30), and WAR (11.9). Brady also had a 22-10 record over 329 innings with a 137 ERA+\n\nWith both teams at 113-49, the 51st Oceania Championship set a finals record for most wins combined between the participants. Melbournes historic dynasty continued as they defeated Guadalcanal 4-2. The Mets earned back-to-back OBA rings and got their sixth in seven years. 1B Isaac Endo repeated as finals MVP as the 25-year old from Guam had 11 hits, 4 runs, 3 doubles, 4 home runs, and 11 RBI in the series.\n\nYou could argue the 2010 squad as Melbournes best of the dynasty, as the only team that won more games (114-48 in 2008) lost in the finals. Six championships in seven years puts the Mets in very rare territory in world baseball history, joining CABAs Mexico City (1967-73), WABs Kano (1997-2003), SABs Ahmedabad (nine titles from 1986-96), and AABs Kinshasa (1997-2003).\n\nAlthough Melbourne had two more finals berths in the run still to come, this was their final overall title and the peak. It certainly stands firm as the best-ever Australian dynasty. Only Honolulus seven titles from 1982-1990 competes in terms of terms of the best-ever sustained run of OBA greatness. It was fitting that this Mets group would be the first OBA representative in the Baseball Grand Championship.\n\nOther notes: Timors pitching staff allowed 800 runs, the second worst in PL history. The Tapirs offense was no better, setting a PL all-time worst with 1713 team strikeouts. Christchurchs Liam Scullion became only the fifth OBA slugger to post a four home run game, doing it against Melbourne on June 1. CF Ashton Hughes became an eight-time Gold Glove winner. LF Samson Gould and CF Tory Clayton both won their seventh Gold Glove.\n\nTimothy Manglona joined Tarzan Rao as the only OBA pitchers with 5500+ strikeouts. Manglona finished the season at 5604, 46 shy of Raos all-time mark of 5650. However, he suffered a torn UCL in September, putting his future in doubt. Manglona would only pitch 20.1 innings in all of 2011 at age 37, but managed to come back for just enough in 2012 to earn the strikeout king crown.\n\nMVP\n\nOVR: 18\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2008\n\n2010 in EPB\n\nDefending Eurasian Professional Baseball champion Moscow finished first in the European League standings at 103-59. This extended the Mules playoff streak to six seasons and was their eighth berth in the last decade. However, it was only their second time in that run finishing first in the standings despite having three pennants. Moscow had 458 stolen bases as a team, which set a new EL record.\n\nKazan claimed the wild card spot with a 99-63 record in second place, ending a five-year playoff drought. Minsk took third at 94-68, which prevented a third consecutive playoff berth. Samara was fourth at 85-77, which was the first-ever winning season for the Steelers since joining EPB in 2000s emergency expansion.\n\nEuropean League MVP went to Kazan RF Evgeny Kiselev. The fourth-year righty from Moscow led in hits (201), total bases (360), triple slash (.344/.400/.615), OPS (1.015), wRC+ (197), and WAR (9.0). Kiselev also had 39 home runs and 114 RBI.\n\nPitcher of the Year was Moscows Josh Lipford, who had a bizarre career. An American from Boston, he toiled away in the minors mostly with 136 total MLB innings. He joined the Mules in 2008, but only saw 84 forgettable innings in his first two years. In 2010, Lipford led the EL in wins (20-6), ERA (1.80), and quality starts (26). He added 235 strikeouts over 250.2 innings, a 183 ERA+, and 6.2 WAR.\n\nLipfords 6.2 WAR would make up more than half of his career 8.7 WAR. He would post 71.2 middling innings for Moscow in 2011, then find himself out of the game shortly thereafter. Lipford was one of the more unlikely one hit wonder major award winners in baseball history.\n\nOmsk ended its seven year playoff drought and had the best record in all of EPB at 110-52. The Otters hadnt earned first place in the standings since 1999. Omsk led the Asian League in both runs scored (690) and fewest allowed (478).\n\nYekaterinburgs playoff streak grew to eight years as the Yaks took the wild card at 101-61. This was their 11th playoff berth in 12 seasons. Defending Asian League champ Krasnoyarsk was a very distant third place at 88-74.\n\nThe Cossacks still saw veteran 3B Boxuan Long won his fourth Asian League MVP. The Chinese 35-year old led in RBI (111), total bases (315), slugging (.553), OPS (.913), wRC+ (168), and WAR (8.3). Long also had 36 home runs with a .298 batting average, earning his 12th and final Silver Slugger. Long played the following two seasons with unremarkable results in MLB before ending with one final EPB season. His 2010 effort made him only the ninth EPB position player to cross 100 career WAR.\n\nPitcher of the Year was third-year Omsk righty Marko Leschov. The 25-year old Russian earned the honor with a 2.35 ERA over 253 innings, 207 strikeouts, a 13-13 record, 140+, and 5.0 WAR. By WAR, Leschov was the weakest POTY winner in Asian League history at that point.\n\nMoscow won 4-2 over Kazan in the European League Championship Series, giving the Mules repeat pennants and their fifth in six years. Moscow joined Minsk (2000-04) and Yekaterinburg (2003-08) as the only EPB teams to win five subleague titles in a six year stretch. The Mules earned an eighth EL title (1967, 74, 75, 05, 06, 07, 09, 10).\n\nIn the Asian League Championship Series, Omsk ousted Yekaterinburg 4-2. This was the Otters first title since 2002 and their fifth overall, having also won in 1987, 1985, and 1966. It would be their first-ever championship meeting against Moscow.\n\nDespite four prior chances, Omsk had never won it all. The 56th EPB Championship changed that with the Otters denying Moscows repeat and winning 4-1. Omsk became the 18th franchise to earn the EPB title. 1B Gaspar Osvath was finals MVP with the 28-year old Hungarian getting 13 hits, 9 runs, 3 home runs, and 10 RBI in 11 playoff starts. Osvath had also joined the small group with a four home run game in the regular season, doing it against Vladivostok in August.\n\nOther notes: Voronezhs Vladyslav Chychykov obliterated the previous EPB single-season stolen base record of 117 by swiping 141 bags. As of 2037, no one else has reached the old record. Roman Izosimov became the 15th slugger to 500 career home runs. Notably, he was the first to cross that mark since 1996.\n\nOF Wendelin Piotkowski won his eighth Gold Glove. It was his first playing center field with the previous seven coming in left. OF Jov Sakharov won his ninth Silver Slugger and his third in center field. His first six came in right.\n\nMVP\n\nOVR: 18\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2008\n\n2010 in EBF\n\nAfter missing out on the playoffs by one game in 2009, Brussels had the top record for the entire EBF Elite in 2010. The Beavers were the Northern Conferences #1 seed at 112-50, rolling to the Northwest Division title. It was their first division title since 1991. Last years #1 seed Dublin was still strong, taking the other bye at 102-60. The Dinos won a third consecutive British Isles Division and their fifth in six years, although they didnt have any playoff success to show for it.\n\nBirmingham was second in the division at 95-67, which earned the first wild card. The Bees broke a playoff drought back to 1997. Paris took the second wild card at 93-69, while Belfast and Glasgow were both four back at 89-73. The Poodles ended a three-year playoff drought. Notably the Brewers had their best season since 1972, although their playoff drought still grew to 49 years. Defending conference champ Luxembourg, winners of 100 games in 2009, fell short at 86-76.\n\nCologne won the North Central Division at 93-69 for their second division title in three years. Kyivs postseason streak ended at six seasons, as the Kings were second at 87-75. That guaranteed the first Northern Conference Championship without Kyiv since 2004. Oslo repeated as Baltic Sea Division champ at 87-75 and were the only team in the division above .500.\n\nAt the bottom of the division was Berlin at 61-101, who suffered the fate of relegation. London (63-99), Kharkiv (64-98), Stockholm (65-97), and Manchester (65-97) all narrowly avoided their own relegation by avoiding the 100 loss threshold. The Killer Bees drop was stunning considering their dynasty a decade earlier, posting their worst season since 1966. The Crushers had a rough go too, having earned a wild card at 90 wins the prior season.\n\nOslos Harvey Coyle repeated as Northern Conference MVP and broke EBFs single-season WAR record by any player. The previous high was a two-way season by Edgar Miranda with 15.5 in 1986. The high just as a position player was Danijel Cindrics 15.4 in 1953. In 2010, Coyle posted a 15.68 WAR.\n\nAt the plate, the 23-year old Englishman led in hits (210), total bases (437), OBP (.424), slugging (.761), OPS (1.185), and wRC+ (230). The switch-hitting shortstop also had 55 home runs, 128 RBI, and a .366 average. Coyle won his third Gold Glove with a 27.2 zone rating and 1.115 EFF. This would just be the start for a guy who would be considered by many as the greatest player in baseball history.\n\nDublins Roman Vakulenko won Pitcher of the Year. The Ukrainian righty had never pitched a full season previously due to injuries, but finally managed in 2010 at age 24. Vakulenko led in strikeouts (359), K/BB (9.7), complete games (15), FIP- (49), and WAR (9.8) while also winning a Gold Glove. He had a 2.33 ERA over 240 innings, 21-3 record, and 155 ERA. Although Vakulenko pitched for another decade, he never had another full season due to multiple torn labrums and back issues.\n\nBirmingham swept Oslo and Cologne won 2-0 over Paris in the first round. Neither stood up to the top seeds, although the Bees did force a 3-2 effort from Brussels. Dublin swept the Copperheads, giving the Dinos their first Northern Conference Championship appearance since their 1995 pennant. The Beavers hadnt made it that far since 1991.\n\nBrussels had home field advantage and was the favorite, but Dublin prevailed easily with a 4-1 win. This was the fifth conference title for the Irish capital, joining their 1961, 1967, 1968, and 1995 efforts. A team from the British Isles Division hadnt won the pennant since Glasgow in 2001.\n\nThe Southern Conferences best two records came out of an intense fight for the Southwest Division. After missing the playoffs narrowly the prior two seasons, 2007 European champ Barcelona took the top seed at 100-62. They were only one game better than reigning EBF champ Marseille at 99-63. Lisbon (86-76), Madrid (85-77), and Seville (84-78) each missed the cut, which prevented three straight playoff berths for the Stingrays.\n\nThe next best two records were both in the South Central Division. Zurich won at 97-65 to earn the #2 seed and bye, ending a three-year playoff drought. Munich finished three behind at 94-68 and earned the second wild card by eight games. The Mavericks continued the longest active playoff streak in EBF, growing it to a decade.\n\nAthens won the East Central Division at 93-69, earning a third straight division title. Vienna was their closest foe at 86-76 with Zagreb at 85-77. In a lousy Southeast Division, Thessaloniki and Bucharest tied for first at 81-81, while Skopje was two back at 79-83. In a one-game tiebreaker, the Tritons prevailed. Thessaloniki was the first franchise that started in the Second League to earn a playoff spot in the Elite tier.\n\nNo team lost 100+ games in the Southern Conference, meaning the worst record was the team to be demoted. That ended up being Tirana at 63-99, falling one game behind Sofia (64-98) and five from Yerevan (68-94). The Trojans had averaged 68.8 wins per year in the prior decade, but had narrowly escaped relegation until now.\n\nMarseille RF Jean-Luc Tapie won his third Southern Conference MVP in four years. The 25-year old Frenchman led in OBP (.451), slugging (.705), OPS (1.156), wRC+ (211), and WAR (10.4). Tapie added 44 home runs, 118 runs, 113 RBI and a .368 average. The Musketeers finally hammered out a long-term extension in August 2011 for Tapie worth $88,300,000 over eight seasons.\n\nMunichs Lucio de Jesus repeated as Pitcher of the Year. The 35-year old Mexican lefty was in his fifth European season and led again in ERA (2.21). He also led with 25 quality starts while adding a 17-6 record over 248.2 innings, 257 strikeouts, a 173 ERA+, and 8.0 WAR.\n\nMarseille swept Thessaloniki and Munich swept Athens in the first round of the playoffs. Zurich survived 3-2 in round two against the Mavericks, while Barcelona rolled to a 3-0 sweep of the defending champ Musketeers. This was the Bengals first Southern Conference Championship appearance since their 2006 and 2007 repeat pennants. The Mountaineers hadnt made it that far since 2000.\n\nZurich took the series 4-2 over Barcelona, ending a 16-year pennant drought for the Mountaineers. It was the ninth conference title for the Swiss squad despite the drought, tying them with Madrid for the most Southern Conference crowns.\n\nIn the 61st European Championship, Dublin downed Zurich 4-2 to become three-time EBF champs, joining their 1962 and 1967 triumphs. The Mountaineers moved to 2-7 all-time in their finals appearances. The 42 year gap between titles for Dublin was the second-longest such gap in EBF history, behind Copenhagens 53 years from their inaugural 1950 win to the 2004 title\n\nOther notes: Although he only played five games, Colognes Ufuk Turan set a playoff record for batting average and on-base percentage, both at .6364. The rate stat is for anyone with 20 plate appearances. Carsten Dal became the seventh member of the 3000 hit club. Two-way player Atanas Kalkanov won his 11th Silver Slugger (his 10th as a pitcher).\n\nPromotion/Relegation: Berlin and Tirana were relegated and Second League conference champs Prague and Helsinki both reclaimed spots among the Elite. The Barons went to the E2L Western Conference and the Trojans to the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Honkers filled Berlins spot in the Baltic Sea Division. The Pilots were placed into the East Central Division, while that divisions reigning champ Athens was shifted into the Southeast Division to fill Tiranas void.\n\nMVP\n\nOVR: 18\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2008\n\n2010 in BSA\n\nFor the third consecutive season, Guayaquil was the Bolivar Leagues top seed and a 100+ win team. The Golds finished 101-61 for a third straight Colombia-Ecuador Division title. Quito was their closest foe 88-74, ultimately falling three games short of the second wild card spot. Both wild cards came out of the Peru-Bolivia Division.\n\nTwo-time defending BL champ Santa Cruz won that division at 99-63, extending their playoff and division title streak to five seasons. Arequipa was second at 95-67 and Callao was 91-71 to take the wild cards. The Arrows earned their second-ever playoff berth (2003) while the Cats nabbed a third straight wild card. Lima was 88-74 for back-to-back seasons, but saw their playoff drought extended to six years.\n\nIn the Venezuela Division, Barquisimeto took first at 94-68. This gave the Black Cats three straight playoff appearances and their second division title in that stretch. Last years division champ Valencia was four back at 90-72, falling one game short of Callao for the second wild card. Maracaibo was also in the mix, but fell short at 87-75.\n\nGuayaquils Rodrigo Aguilar repeated as Bolivar League MVP in his third season as a starter. The 25-year old Ecuadoran 1B broke his own single-season RBI record of 170 from the prior year, bringing in 173. This stands as the Beisbol Sudamerica record still as of 2037. Aguilar also led the league in home runs (68), total bases (456), and slugging (.714). He added a 177 wRC+, 132 runs, and 8.9 WAR. The Golds eventually committed long-term to Aguilar with an eight-year, $64,100,000 extension signed in August 2012.\n\nBarquisimetos Sebastian Marquez repeated as Pitcher of the Year in his fourth season. The 24-year old Venezuelan righty led in ERA (2.31), quality starts (25), and shutouts (4). Marquez had a 21-6 record over 253 innings, 255 strikeouts, 173 ERA+, 64 FIP-, and 8.4 WAR.\n\nBarquisimeto swept Callao 2-0 in the first round and took top seed Guayaquil to the limit in the Divisional Series. The Golds survived in five games to advance for back-to-back Bolivar League Championship Series berths. Santa Cruz outlasted Arequipa 3-2, giving the Crawfish a chance at a three-peat. Santa Cruz pulled it off in the rematch with Guayaquil in a seven game war. The Crawfish were the first to win three consecutive BL titles since Valencias five-in-a-row in the 1970s.\n\nThe Southern Cone League was a competitive one with only seven wins separating the top seed from the #5 seed. Fortaleza took the top spot for the third successive season by winning the North Division at 98-64. Recife was second at 94-68, getting the first wild card and the #2 seed due to BSA not giving division champs guaranteed higher seeds than wild cards.\n\nAsuncion took the South Central Division at 93-69, extending their playoff and division title streak to five seasons. The Archers now have 12 playoff berths in 14 years. Cordoba was second at 90-72 and Santiago was third at 88-74. Sao Paulo won the Southeast Division at 92-70, ending a 13-year playoff drought. Montevideo was a close second at 90-72.\n\nThe Venom and Chanticleers tied for the second wild card, while the Saints were two games back and reigning Copa Sudamerica champ Salvador was three away at 87-75. Cordoba won the tiebreaker game over Montevideo to end a 24-year playoff drought. The Storms playoff streak ended at four seasons. Rio de Janeiros playoff streak snapped at seven years with the Redbirds finishing 83-79.\n\nFortaleza 2B Antonio Arceo repeated as Southern Cone League MVP. The 25-year old Bolivian led in RBI (124), total bases (409), and slugging (.661). Arceo added 50 home runs, 115 runs, a .342 average, 186 wRC+, and 9.4 WAR.\n\nAlthough Arceo was MVP, perhaps the most statistically significant player was Mendozas Francisco Magellan. The 29-year old Brazilian right fielder set a new world record with a .420 batting average, a mark still not matched as of 2037 anywhere. Magellan also led in OBP (.460), OPS (1.083), and wRC+ (203), but wasnt an MVP finalist due to lacking home run power and playing for a middling Mutants squad. Still, a .420 average over 564 at-bats is a remarkable achievement. Only Samuel Salazars .405 in 1988 was above .400 in BSA prior.\n\nPitcher of the Year was Cordobas Rodrigo Ghirardi, making an impressive comeback from a torn rotator cuff suffered in September 2008. The 26-year old Argentinian led in ERA at 2.13 with 4.8 WAR over 198.2 innings, a 17-5 record, 202 strikeouts, and 171 ERA+. That was the second-lowest WAR total ever by a BSA POTY winner, in part due to his small inning count. Injuries and arm damage prevented Ghiradi from ever topping 200 innings in a season.\n\nSao Paulo beat Cordoba 2-0 in the first round and gave top seed Fortaleza a valiant effort. The Foxes survived 3-2 in the Divisional Series, while Recife rolled to a sweep of Asuncion. Despite being the top seed three years running, this was Fortalezas first Southern Cone Championship appearance since their 2005 pennant. The Retrievers earned repeat berths and this time prevailed, upsetting the Foxes 4-2. It was the fourth league title for Recife (1984, 1995, 1996, 2010).\n\nThe 80th Copa Sudamerica saw Santa Cruz victorious 4-2 over Recife, earning their second cup in three years. Just like in their 2008 victory, 3B Timmy Andre was finals MVP for the Crawfish. The 31-year old French Guianese third baseman had 18 playoff starts with 19 hits, 11 runs, 2 doubles, 5 home runs, and 15 RBI.\n\nOther notes: In their second season post-expansion, Barranquilla finished 47-115; tying the Bolivar Leagues all-time worst record. Vicente Sainz became the eighth member of the 3000 hits club. He played two more seasons and finished with 3293, which ranks eighth as of 2037. Sainz also became the 11th to reach 1500 runs scored.\n\nEli Lee became the 22nd to reach 1500 RBI. Jose Antonio Saenz won his ninth consecutive Gold Glove at second base. Two-way player Oliver Ichimiya won his seventh Silver Slugger as a pitcher.\n\nMVP\n\nOVR: 18\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2008\n\n2010 in EAB\n\nOnly one of the four playoff teams from 2009 in the Japan League made it back in 2010. The biggest shocker was reigning East Asian Baseball champ Nagoya, dropping from their impressive 117-45 mark to a mere 84-78. That was not enough to win the Central Division, which went to Kyoto at 86-76. The Kamikaze were the weakest division winner, ending a two-year playoff drought.\n\nThe top seed went to Kawasaki in the Capital Division at 102-60, ending a six-year drought for the Killer Whales. That ended Tokyos four-year streak winning the Capital Division, as the Tides fell to 79-83. Kumamoto also ended an 11-year playoff drought by winning a tight West Division at 90-72. The Monsters were three games ahead of defending division champ Fukuoka and seven better than Hiroshima.\n\nThe lone returning playoff team was Niigata, who cruised in a weak North Division at 89-73. The Green Dragons earned a fifth division title in a row and their ninth in ten years. Theyre only the third team in Japan League history to earn nine playoff appearances in a ten year stretch, joining Hiroshima (1999-2008) and Sapporo (1979-1988).\n\nJapan League MVP went to Kumamoto left fielder Sang-Jun Gang. In his eighth season with the Monsters, the 28-year old lefty led in runs (117), total bases (382), average (.349), slugging (.673), OPS (1.079), and wRC+ (221). Gang added 41 home runs, 11 RBI, 31 doubles, 15 triples, and 8.6 WAR.\n\nPitcher of the Year was Kawasakis Takeo Kobayashi. It was the breakout season for the 25-year old righty, who led in wins at 19-6. Kobayashi had a 2.11 ERA over 247.2 innings, 251 strikeouts, 156 ERA+, and 6.0 WAR.\n\nAlso of note, Fukuokas Heihachiro Okasawa joined Oki Tanaka as EABs only five-time Reliever of the Year winners. Okasawa won his consecutively and soon left for MLB at age 27 on a three-year, $28,000,000 deal with Philadelphia. He was a beast in six seasons for Fukuoka with 218 saves, a 1.26 ERA over 491 innings, 926 strikeouts, a 270 ERA+, and 33.5 WAR.\n\nKyoto stunned top seed Kawasaki with a first round sweep, while Kumamoto outlasted Niigata 3-2. The Kamikaze earned a second Japan League Championship Series appearance in four years. For the Monsters, their only prior JLCS was a defeat in 1988. Kyoto cruised to a 4-1 win over Kumamoto to end a 32-year title drought. The Kamikaze were now four-time champs, having won three from 1974-1977.\n\nThe top of the Korea League divisions saw intense battles with the top seed separated by three games from the #4 seed. Yongin very narrowly took the top overall seed, winning the South Division at 101-61. The Gold Sox were back in the playoffs after seeing their playoff streak ended at four in 2009. Yongin also set a new EAB record with 518 stolen bases as a team, blowing by the old high of 479 by Gwangju in 1992. This remains EABs all-time top mark.\n\nBoth Gwangju and Busan finished one game behind Yongin in the regular season at 100-62, while Daegu was competitive at 93-69. The Grays won the tiebreaker game for the first wild card, while the defending KL champ Blue Jays took the second spot. Gwangjus playoff streak grew to three seasons.\n\nMeanwhile, the North Division had a tie for first at 97-65 between Suwon and Seoul. Only the winner of the tiebreaker game would advance, as they both were two games short of the second wild card. The Snappers prevailed to earn repeat playoff berths.\n\nSuwons A-Min Bae won his third Korea League MVP in four seasons. The 25-year old left fielder led in home runs (57), hits (214), runs (136), total bases (442), triple slash (.378/.436/.781), OPS (1.217), wRC+ (220), and WAR (12.4). His 127 RBI fell one shy of a Triple Crown season.\n\nYongins Chang-Hyun Pak was Pitcher of the Year, leading in wins at 24-9. The 26-year old righty had a 2.50 ERA over 241 innings, 265 strikeouts, 148 ERA+, and 7.6 WAR. Also notable was Busans Geon-Min Lee winning a third straight Reliever of the Year.\n\nTop seed Yongin rolled to a 3-0 sweep of defending champ Busan, while Gwangju ousted Suwon 3-1. The Gold Sox earned a third Korea League Championship Series appearance in six years, while the Grays hadnt gotten that far since their 1993 pennant. Yongin handled their divisional foe 4-1 for their second pennant in four years. The Gold Sox won their ninth league title (1970, 84, 85, 94, 95, 97, 01, 07, 10).\n\nThe 90th East Asian Championship had Kyoto defeat Yongin 4-2, giving the Kamikaze their third EAB title (1974, 1976, 2010). Fifth-year CF Taiji Shoji was the finals MVP making 14 playoff starts with 29 hits, 16 runs, 3 doubles, 5 triples, 1 home run, 12 RBI, and 14 stolen bases. He tied EABs playoff record for steals.\n\nOther notes: Gwangjus Sawamura Umemoto threw two no-hitters in 2010, both against Changwon. The first on April 24 had 11 strikeouts and 1 walk, while the second had 10 Ks and no walks on September 21. He joined Ha-Ram Lee (1991) as the only EAB pitchers with multiple no-nos in the same season.\n\nRF Soo-Geun Yim won his ninth Silver Slugger. It was his third in right field, while he had one at first base and five as a designated hitter. 2B Yoo Sen won his eighth consecutive Silver Slugger.\n\nMVP\n\nOVR: 18\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2008\n\nCABA 100 Years Team\n\nThe 2010 season marked 100 years for the Central American Baseball Association. There had been tremendous growth for the game across Mexico and the Caribbean over a century. In honor of the incredible history of CABAs first 100 years, an esteemed panel constructed the CABA Centennial Team. It wasnt easy to determine a 25-man roster of the best of the best, but that group was announced in 2010 and is listed below.\n\nMexicans were the largest nationality with nine roster spots. It was a diverse group overall with three players from Puerto Rico, two apiece from the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Guatemala; and one from Panama, Nicaragua, Aruba, Colombia, Honduras, Venezuela, and the United States.\n\nStarting Lineup\n\nCatcher  Mar Pavia  Tijuana Toros  1913-1925  1x MVP, 12x Silver Slugger, 4x Gold Glove, 12x All-Star, 4x CABA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 1835 games, 1576 starts, 1620 hits, 824 runs, 222 doubles, 337 home runs, 853 RBI, 542 walks, .258/.326/.462, 164 wRC+, 91.0 WAR\n\nFirst Base  Prometheo Nitro Garcia  Guadalajara Hellhounds  1943-1962  8x MVP, 14x Silver Slugger, 17x All-Star, 2890 games, 2781 starts, 3871 hits, 1850 runs, 535 doubles, 753 home runs, 2042 RBI, 754 walks, .350/.395/.615, 203 wRC+, 166.8 WAR\n\nSecond Base  Luis Miranda  Monterrey Matadors  1951-1967  11x Silver Slugger, 15x All-Star, 2x CABA Champion, 1x LCS MVP, 2459 games, 2248 starts, 2469 hits, 1310 runs, 347 doubles, 144 triples, 367 home runs, 1164 RBI, 584 walks, 867 stolen bases, .286/.337/.487, 144 wRC+, 109.6 WAR\n\nThird Base  Adrian Tovar  Trinidad Trail Blazers  1982-2004  1x MVP, 10x Silver Slugger, 14x All-Star, 1x CABA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 1x LCS MVP, 3338 games, 3221 starts, 3723 hits, 1871 runs, 675 doubles, 90 triples, 718 home runs, 2024 RBI, 720 walks, .293/.336/.530 slash, 143 wRC+, 140.8 WAR.\n\nShortstop  Emmanuel Punk Zavala  Leon Lions  1934-1952  2x MVP, 16x Silver Slugger, 16x All-Star, 2x CABA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 1x LCS MVP, 2951 games, 2706 starts, 3044 hits, 1454 runs, 386 doubles, 166 triples, 497 home runs, 1486 RBI, 532 walks, 804 stolen bases, .279/.314/.482, 146 wRC+, 134.1 WAR\n\nLeft Field  Vicente Gutierrez  Tijuana Toros  1954-1972  5x MVP, 10x Silver Slugger, 12x All-Star, 2592 games, 2355 starts, 2726 hits, 1606 runs, 301 doubles, 734 home runs, 1754 RBI, 1286 walks, .309/.396/.600, 193 wRC+, 129.0 WAR\n\nCenter Field  Wesley Four Eyes Dubar  Guatemala Ghosts  1962-1981  9x MVP, 7x Silver Slugger, 1x Gold Glove, 13x All-Star, 1x CABA Champion, 1x LCS MVP, 3066 games, 2923 starts, 3362 hits, 2028 runs, 398 doubles, 330 triples, 695 home runs, 2104 RBI, 1070 walks, 661 stolen bases, .296/.359/.572, 151 wRC+, 147.9 WAR.\n\nRight Field  Kiko Bad Company Velazquez  Mexico City Aztecs  1927-1942  10x MVP, 14x Silver Slugger, 13x All-Star, 1x Rookie of the Year, 2x CABA Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 2077 games, 1939 starts, 2714 hits, 1552 runs, 347 doubles, 160 triples, 583 home runs, 1502 RBI, 593 walks, 808 stolen bases, .349/.401/.660, 220 wRC+, 147.3 WAR\n\nDesignated Hitter (3B/1B)  Donald Amazing Gonzalez  Chihuahua Warriors  1998-2010  5x MVP, 9x Silver Slugger, 11x All-Star, 2038 games, 1910 starts, 2607 hits, 1459 runs, 375 doubles, 102 triples, 586 home runs, 1491 RBI, 683 walks, 172 stolen bases, .347/.405/.659, 203 wRC+, 120.0 WAR\n\nBench\n\nOutfield  Emmanuel Lopez  Mexico City Aztecs  1951-1968  6x MVP, 11x Silver Slugger, 1x Rookie of the Year, 16x All-Star, 1x CABA Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 1x LCS MVP, 2732 games, 2584 starts, 3314 hits, 1665 runs, 482 doubles, 190 triples, 473 home runs, 1611 RBI, 840 walks, 908 stolen bases, .321/.373/.542, 164 wRC+, 135.6 WAR\n\nOutfield  Hugh Boerboom  Santo Domingo Dolphins  1986-2006  3x MVP, 3x Gold Glove, 8x Silver Slugger, 8x All-Star, 1x CABA Champion, 1x LCS MVP, 3023 games, 2888 starts, 3083 hits, 1808 runs, 259 doubles, 130 triples, 866 home runs, 2008 RBI, 676 walks, 751 stolen bases, .274/.313/.550, 134 wRC+, 96.5 WAR\n\nCatcher  Chip Perez  Juarez Jesters  1929-1947  11x Silver Slugger, 5x Gold Glove, 16x All-Star, 2280 games, 1985 starts, 2220 hits, 1048 runs, 476 doubles, 319 home runs, 1102 RBI, .319 walks, 279/.332/.475, 145 wRC+, 93.9 WAR\n\nFirst Base -

The Explosion have now made the playoffs 16 times in the last 18 years. Leon was a distant second in the division at 96-66, but this was the MLs second best record. The wild card for the Lions ended a 17-year playoff drought.\n\nThe North Division had an intense battle with Hermosillo and Torreon tying for first at 91-71, while Monterrey was 90-72 and Chihuahua was 87-74. The Hyenas won the tiebreaker game to take the division, while the Tomahawks got the second wild card. Hermosillo extended its playoff streak to five seasons and Torreon earned its sixth berth of the decade. The reigning champion Matadors missed the playoffs by a game. The biggest drop was Mexicali, who went from a wild card the prior year to a lousy 66-96.\n\nEcatepec first baseman Casimiro Salceda repeated as Mexican League MVP and repeated as a Triple Crown winner. The 34-year old righty led in home runs (57), RBI (158), runs (145), hits (236), doubles (49), total bases (464), triple slash (.381/.430/.750), OPS (1.179), wRC+ (233), and WAR (11.7). His 145 runs was the third most in a single-season and only six short of the CABA record.\n\nLeons Papu Rodriquez won Pitcher of the Year. The 28-year old Argentine lefty led in strikeouts (339), innings (264), FIP- (69), and WAR (7.8). Rodriquez added a 2.83 ERA, 129 ERA+, and 19-8 record. This helped get Rodriquez paid, as he signed a mammoth six-year, $77,600,000 extension the following summer.\n\nThe division champs won the first round playoff matchups with a 3-0 sweep for Ecatepec over Torreon and a 3-1 Hermosillo win over Leon. The Explosion earned their fourth consecutive Mexican League Championship Series appearance and their 15th since 1993, although they had lost their last four appearances. The Hyenas secured a third MLCS in five years. Ecatepec ended their losing streak, taking the series 4-2 over Hermosillo. The Explosion grabbed their first pennant since the 1999-2004 six-peat and won their 14th Mexican League title overall.\n\nNicaragua repeated as the Caribbean Leagues top seed and earned a third consecutive playoff berth, winning the Island Division at 104-58. Close behind for the #1 seed was Haiti atop the Island Division at 102-60. The Herons extended their impressive playoff streak to 14 seasons.\n\nSanto Domingo was seven back of Haiti at 95-67, giving the Dolphins back-to-back wild cards. Guatemala at 92-70 grabbed the second spot for their first playoff appearance since 1993. The next closest foe was Honduras at 86-76. Defending CABA Champion Havana fell off hard, going from 103-59 in 2009 to a mediocre 76-86 in 2010.\n\nAlthough Costa Rica was near .500, their LF Marvin Orellana won Caribbean League MVP. The 28-year old Salvadoran led in hits (210), homers (51), total bases (425), average (.362), slugging (.733), OPS (1.141), wRC+ (201), and WAR (9.8). Orellana had 133 RBI, falling five shy of a Triple Crown. This was his final year with the Rays, as he signed a huge seven-year, $84,700,000 free agency deal with Monterrey. Orellana never reached such elite levels again, in part due to injury issues.\n\nMontell Donald joined Nicaragua in March 2010 in a trade with Guayana for prospects. The 27-year old Curacaoan delivered as Pitcher of the Year, leading in ERA (1.57), WHIP (0.86), K/BB (11.9). quality starts (23), FIP- (52), and WAR (9.2). Donald added a 19-4 record over 234.2 innings with 262 strikeouts and a 250 ERA+. Shortly after the trade, the Navigators gave him a five-year, $49,500,000 extension as the ace of the future.\n\nBoth division champs beat their division rival wild card with Nicaragua sweeping Guatemala and Haiti dropping Santo Domingo 3-1. The Navigators earned a third straight Caribbean League Championship Series appearance, while the Herons grabbed their seventh in a decade. Although the road underdog, Haiti rolled Nicaragua 4-1 for their sixth pennant since 2000. The Herons became nine time Caribbean champs.\n\nThe 100th Central American Baseball Association Championship rekindled a great rivalry from a decade prior. Ecatepec and Haiti battled in three straight finals from 2000-02 with the first going to the Explosion and the latter two to the Herons. Ecatepec evened the all-time series by taking the 2010 edition 4-1.\n\nThird-year left fielder Vinny Gonzalez won finals MVP. In 13 playoff starts, the 26-year old Mexican had 16 hits, 14 runs, 2 doubles, 7 home runs, and 18 RBI. The 18 RBI was one short of the CABA playoff record. This was Ecatepecs first title since 2004, putting them at 8-6 all-time in the CABA Championship. The eight rings tied Monterrey for the second-most of any CABA team, although theyre still behind Mexico Citys ten.\n\nOther notes: CABAs 32nd perfect game was thrown on September 10 by Hermosillos Ramon Ibarra, who struck out seven against Monterrey.\n\nDario Becker became the tenth pitcher to 250 career wins. He pitched one more year and ended with 270, which ranks seventh as of 2037. Luis Fernandez became the 25th to reach 1500 RBI. LF Ozzie Collard won his eighth Gold Glove.\n\nFive-time MVP Donald Gonzalez reached 2500 career hits at age 31 and won his ninth Silver Slugger. At that point, the Puerto Rican 3B/1B had 2607 hits, 1459 runs, 586 home runs, 1491 RBI, and 120.0 WAR. Many thought he could make a run at the top spot on the leaderboards, but this was his final CABA season. Gonzalez became the richest player in the game after signing a five-year, $90,000,000 deal with MLBs St. Louis."
