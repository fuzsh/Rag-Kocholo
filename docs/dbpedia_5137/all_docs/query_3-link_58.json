The bulk of materials in this series originated from the university's Athletics Department. Many items relate to SCU's Division I team sports. The series also includes a limited number of artifacts and memorabilia related to sporting events sponsored by other departments within the university.\n\nThe types of materials in this series include objects that testify to Santa Clara's participation in tournaments at the state and national level such as ribbons, plaques, and pins. The series includes fan memorabilia such as pennants, a noisemaker and various clothing patches with the SCU logo and Bronco mascot. In addition to artifacts, the series includes ephemera such as field passes, tickets, ribbons, postcards and schedule cards.\n\nThe series contains items related to Santa Clara's football team, the Broncos, which existed from 1896-1992. The team played in three major bowl games: the Sugar Bowl (1937, 1938) and the Orange Bowl (1950). Of note are footballs used during the championship games and other commemorative material."
