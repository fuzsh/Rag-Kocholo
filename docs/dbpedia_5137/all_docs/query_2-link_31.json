        "text": "The steroid era tarnishes the modern Yankee dynasty.\n\nThe New York Yankees are 26-time World Series champs. They won the fall classic in 1923, 1927, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1943, 1947, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1977, 1978, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000.\n\nBut four of those championships came in the steroid era. The Mitchell Report was released on 12/13/07 and named the following current and former Yankee players as likely users of steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). The numbers in parenthesis indicate the years the players were on a World Series winning Yankees team.\n\nRicky Bones (1996)\n\nKevin Brown\n\nJose Canseco (2000)\n\nRoger Clemens (2000)\n\nBobby Estalella\n\nJason Giambi\n\nJason Grimsley (2000)\n\nGlenallen Hill (2000)\n\nDarren Holmes (1998)\n\nDavid Justice (2000)\n\nChuck Knoblauch (1998, 1999, 2000)\n\nJosias Manzanillo\n\nHal Morris\n\nDaniel Naulty (1999)\n\nDenny Neagle (2000)\n\nAndy Pettitte (1996, 1998, 1999, 2000)\n\nGary Sheffield\n\nMike Stanton (1998, 1999, 2000)\n\nRandy Velarde\n\nRon Villone\n\nRondell White\n\nTodd Williams\n\nSo it would seem to me that these four World Series victories are tainted:\n\n1996 – NY Yankees 4, Atlanta 2\n\n1998 – NY Yankees 4, San Diego 0\n\n1999 – NY Yankees 4, Atlanta 0\n\n2000 – NY Yankees 4, NY Mets 1\n\nI’m guessing that the Braves, Padres, and Mets would like a recount. Just based on the above list, 2000 seems like the most juiced World Series in history.\n\nFrom now on, let’s just refer to The New York Yankees as 26-time* World Series champs."
