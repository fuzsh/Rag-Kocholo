        "text": "Regular season record: 94-68\n\nPostseason elimination: Game 7 of the World Series\n\nIn brief: After overcoming a 3-2 NLCS deficit against the Pirates to win Games 6 and 7 on the road, the Braves met the Twins for perhaps the greatest World Series of all time: seven games, five one-run games, three extra inning affairs and a World Series record four walkoff wins. The Twins capped it off with a thrilling 1-0 win in Game 7, boosted by 10 shutout innings from Jack Morris. It was as evenly matched a series as has ever been played.\n\nThe Braves lost because … there were too many missed opportunities.\n\nThe details: After walkoff wins in Games 3 and 4 and a 14-5 pounding of the Twins in Game 5, the Braves were up 3-2 in the series and looked to be in total control and on their way to a title. But they never led in Game 6, which ended in the 11th inning with Kirby Puckett’s walkoff homer, and they never scored in Game 7. That’s not to say there weren’t chances in both games. The Braves’ hitters bettered the Twins in runs, hits, average, on-base percentage, extra-base hits, slugging and OPS across the seven games, while Atlanta pitchers led the series in ERA, WHIP and strikeouts. But the Braves also led the series in men left on base. And in Games 6 and 7, they were a combined 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position.\n\nThe critical moment: The eighth inning of Game 7 decided the series for the Braves. Even if you ignore that Lonnie Smith should’ve scored on Terry Pendleton’s double in the left-center gap, the Braves still had runners at second and third with nobody out and the heart of their order coming up in a scoreless game. But the next batter, Ron Gant, hit a weak nubber to first base with the infield in and the runners had to hold. After an intentional walk to David Justice to load the bases, Sid Bream bounced into a 3-6-3 double play to end the inning. The game remained scoreless until the Twins won in the 10th.\n\nVerdict: Yes, the Braves should’ve won the 1991 World Series. Had they scored in the eighth inning, and assuming (granted, a big assumption) the bottom of the eighth and ninth still play out the same, the Braves win the game 1-0 in nine innings to take the championship.\n\nRegular season record: 98-64\n\nPostseason elimination: Game 6 of the World Series\n\nIn brief: The Braves started the World Series on an incredible high after winning Game 7 of the NLCS against the Pirates in dramatic — and historic — walkoff fashion. They carried that enthusiasm into Game 1 against the Blue Jays, earning a 3-1 home win behind Tom Glavine’s complete game four-hitter and Damon Berryhill’s three-run homer in the sixth off Jack Morris. The Braves kept rolling for most of Game 2 behind John Smoltz before the Blue Jays rallied to win 5-4. The Jays took control of the series back in Toronto, though a Braves win in Game 5 staved off elimination and sent the series back to Atlanta for Game 6, which the Blue Jays won in extra innings to give baseball its first champion outside the United States.\n\nThe Braves lost because … there were, again, too many missed opportunities.\n\nThe details: All four of the Braves’ losses in the series were by one run and the Braves were 13 for 54 (.240) with runners in scoring position across the six games. The Jays were actually worse in that regard (10 for 46; .217) but got timely hits when they needed them. In the deciding Game 6, the Braves were just 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position and left 10 men on base — including the winning run on third in the bottom of the ninth and the tying run on third in the bottom of the 11th. The Braves also held leads in the eighth inning or later in Games 2 and 3 but went on to lose both.\n\nThe critical moment: The series turned in the ninth inning of Game 2. The Braves led 4-3 and were on the verge of going up 2-0 in the series. Closer Jeff Reardon came on to close it out. After getting Pat Borders to fly out to start the inning, Reardon walked Derek Bell. No biggie, except Reardon’s next pitch caught too much of the plate and pinch-hitter Ed Sprague hit it into the left field seats for a go-ahead two-run homer that sucked the air right out of Fulton County Stadium and gave the Jays new life.\n\nVerdict: Yes, the Braves should’ve won the 1992 World Series. It’s a tough call, because the Blue Jays played very well, but if Reardon converts the save in Game 2, it’s a reasonable bet that they at least come back to Atlanta for Game 6 up 3-2 in the series. If it went to Game 7, Glavine was waiting. And in a winner-take-all situation, John Smoltz would’ve been available in relief. Those signs point to a Braves series win.\n\nRegular season record: 104-58\n\nPostseason elimination: Game 6 of the NLCS\n\nIn brief: In baseball’s last true pennant race, the Braves edged out the Giants to win the NL West on the last day of the season, capping an incredible surge that saw Atlanta come from 10 games back on July 22 to win the division. The Braves then took on the Phillies in the NLCS and, after dropping Game 1 in extra innings, pummeled the Phillies 14-3 in Game 2 and 9-4 back home in Game 3 to take a 2-1 series lead. But Philadelphia rallied to win three straight and capture the pennant.\n\nThe Braves lost because … they stopped hitting with runners on base.\n\nThe details: After Game 3 in Atlanta, the Braves had outscored the Phillies 26-11 in the series and, with John Smoltz on the mound in Game 4, looked poised to take a commanding 3-1 series lead. But the flow of runs the Braves enjoyed in Games 2 and 3 evaporated in Game 4. They took an early 1-0 that day but wouldn’t score again despite 10 hits against Danny Jackson and Mitch Williams. They went 1 for 15 with runners in scoring position and lost the game 2-1. The situation was similar in Game 5. The Braves struggled to mount any kind of threat against Phillies starter Curt Schilling. But with Schilling out of the game and the Braves down 3-0 in the ninth, they rallied to tie and had the winning run at third with one out. Alas, they couldn’t push it across and lost 4-3 in the 10th on a Lenny Dykstra homer off Mark Wohlers.\n\nThe critical moment: Take your pick. Any of the missed scoring chances in Game 4 could’ve turned the series and put the Braves up 3-1. Likewise, most any line drive, hard-hit grounder or fly ball would’ve scored the winning run in the ninth inning of Game 5 and might have been a series changer.\n\nVerdict: We can’t say they should’ve won the World Series in 1993, but it sure seems like they should’ve been there. The Phillies were more than formidable (97 wins and the NL’s best offense), but the Braves’ lineup was plenty potent, and it’s almost baffling that it would struggle to score so badly in two home playoff games, especially after the drubbing it gave the Phillies in Games 2 and 3. The Braves were likely just a couple of hits shy of playing in their third straight Fall Classic. But give the Phillies credit for shutting them down.\n\nRegular season record: 96-66\n\nPostseason elimination: Game 6 of the World Series\n\nIn brief: The Braves recovered from a 3-1 deficit in the NLCS to pummel the Cardinals by a combined score of 32-1 over the final three games of the series. They continued the barrage when they won Games 1 and 2 of the World Series against the Yankees by a combined score of 16-1. Make sure you understand: They won five straight postseason games by a combined score of 48-2. They looked unstoppable, a couple of steps from back-to-back championships and establishing themselves as a legitimate dynasty.\n\nThe Braves lost because … they collapsed.\n\nThe details: The Braves came home for Game 3 up 2-0 in the series and in total control, or so it seemed. Though they returned to earth in a 5-2 loss to David Cone, they were still in a good position heading into Game 4. They appeared to seize control once more when they jumped out to a 6-0 lead and carried it into the sixth inning — 12 outs from a 3-1 lead in the series and John Smoltz ready for a potential clincher in Game 5. But the Yankees had cut the lead to 6-3 as play began in the eighth inning, and that's when Atlanta's pitching and defense faltered big time and the series took a huge turn in the Yankees’ favor. The Game 4 loss not just evened the series but seemed to take all life from the Braves. Game 5 was another crushing loss, 1-0 on an unearned run (and 0 for 7 with RISP), sending the series back to New York for Game 6, which the Yankees won to capture the title.\n\nThe critical moment: Jim Leyritz’s home run off Mark Wohlers in the eighth inning of Game 4 turned the series — and birthed a Yankees dynasty. Until that point, the Braves still had the advantage. After the homer, even though they weren’t technically out of the game or the series, the Braves couldn’t recover. It was as big a turning point as any in the history of the World Series.\n\nHonorary critical moment: Just before Leyritz’s homer, Braves shortstop Rafael Belliard botched what looked to be a certain double play that would’ve resulted in a runner at third with two outs when Leyritz came to bat — and meant his homer would’ve only been a two run shot, with the Braves still leading 6-5 at the end of the inning. Instead, the Braves only got a force out a second, putting two men on base for Leyritz to drive in with his game-tying homer.\n\nVerdict: Yes, without question, the Braves should’ve won the 1996 World Series. Despite the Yankees’ comeback, it’s hard to argue that the Braves didn’t collapse and give this series away. Blowing a 6-0 lead at home? That’s awful in July, let alone in the World Series. For Braves fans, and for the players who went through it, this is the series that stings the most.\n\nRegular season record: 101-61\n\nPostseason elimination: Game 6 of the NLCS\n\nIn brief: The Braves and the wild-card Marlins seemed evenly matched as they split the first four games. Each team took turns getting subpar outings from vaunted starting pitchers: Greg Maddux and John Smoltz got roughed up for the Braves, as did Alex Fernandez and Al Leiter for the Marlins (though Fernandez left Game 2 in the third inning with an elbow injury). The teams also took turns being hot and cold on offense, with the Marlins winning Games 1 and 3, and the Braves taking Games 2 and 4. Game 5 in Florida was the turning point, when Marlins rookie Livan Hernandez dominated the Braves on three hits while striking out 15 in a complete-game win that put his team up 3-2 in the series. The Marlins took Game 6 in Atlanta to win the pennant — the first of what would be many opposing-team celebrations at Turner Field.\n\nBut the Braves lost because … of uneven starting pitching — and umpire Eric Gregg.\n\nThe details: First, the pitching: The Marlins jumped on Braves ace Maddux for three runs in the first inning of Game 1 and added two more in the third inning to take a 5-1 lead en route to a 5-3 win. It was a similar story for John Smoltz in Game 3 with the series tied 1-1, as he gave up five runs in six innings in a 5-2 Marlins win. Tom Glavine had a similar rough outing in the Game 6 clincher, giving up seven runs in 5 2/3 innings. But it was Game 5 that turned the series, and that’s where umpire Eric Gregg comes in. Hernandez notched 15 strikeouts in large part because Gregg’s strike zone was, well, a large part of the playing field. Time after time, Braves hitters would look back in disbelief as Gregg rang up strike after strike on pitches well outside the zone. Here, do this: Go to YouTube and type in “Eric Gregg,” then hit the space bar. The first suggested search is “Eric Gregg strike zone.” The second one is “Eric Gregg Livan Hernandez.” So, yeah. Gregg was as much a part of the outcome as anyone on the field that day.\n\nThe critical moment: Game 5 shifted the series into the Marlins’ control and Gregg’s liberal zone helped keep the Braves off the bases. This is important because it was a one-run game. The Marlins won 2-1, so any base runner would’ve constituted a rally for the Braves. Related: Four Braves hitters struck with 3-2 counts on called third strikes, including Fred McGriff to end the game. Maddux benefited from the poor calls, too, but not to the extent Hernandez did. Indians fans would say it was payback for some liberal strike calls in Tom Glavine’s one-hit clincher in the 1995 World Series. Joe Brinkman was the home plate umpire in that game, but his name doesn’t produce any suggestions in the YouTube search field.\n\nVerdict: This series could’ve gone either way. Both teams performed fairly equally. Without Gregg’s strike zone, the Braves probably would’ve had a better chance to win Game 5, but it certainly wouldn’t have been a lock. And even if they had, there’s no guarantee they would’ve won Game 6 the way Kevin Brown was pitching. And in a Game 7, well, who knows how that would’ve gone. The Marlins were more or less an even match for the Braves, at least in the postseason, and they happened to win. So it’s not really fair to call this a missed opportunity for the Braves.\n\nRegular season record: 106-56\n\nPostseason elimination: Game 6 of the NLCS\n\nIn brief: The Braves rode the greatest of their great ‘90s pitching rotations and a powerful offense to an NL-best 106 wins and their seventh straight division title. Their starting rotation was so good during the regular season that the “worst” pitcher, Denny Neagle, went 16-11 with a 3.55 ERA. On the offensive side, the Braves had four players with 30 or more homers and three with 100 or more RBIs. They were a force, statistically the best Braves team ever. They easily swept the Cubs in the NLCS, outscoring them 15-4, and went to the NLCS to face the 98-win Padres, who jumped out to a 3-0 series lead before eventually winning in six games.\n\nThe Braves lost because … they didn’t find their bats until it was too late.\n\nThe details: The Braves scattered eight hits in Game 1 (0 for 7 with runners in scoring position) and pushed across two runs in a 3-2, 10-inning loss. Then, Kevin Brown shut them down in Game 2 on just three hits. In Game 3, they left 12 men on base and lost 4-1 to fall behind 3-0 in the series. The Padres had a 3-2 lead in Game 4 and were nine outs from a sweep when the Braves’ offense finally woke up in a six-run seventh, highlighted by Andres Galarraga’s grand slam that secured an 8-3 win to avoid the sweep. A similar story unfolded in Game 5, when the Braves again staved off elimination with a late rally — this time a five-run eighth thanks to Michael Tucker’s three-run homer and some sloppy Padres defense. The Padres staged a rally in the ninth, scoring two on a Greg Myers homer, which led to a most unusual sight: Bobby Cox brought Greg Maddux in from the bullpen to get three outs and record the save. But any momentum the Braves gained in Games 4 and 5 was lost immediately in Game 6, as Sterling Hitchcock shut them out on two hits as the Padres won the pennant with a 5-0 win.\n\nThe critical moment: There wasn’t one. Even with their offensive showings in Games 4 and 5, the Braves were out hit, out scored and out pitched by the Padres.\n\nVerdict: Despite having the best record in the National League and being the clear favorites on paper, the Braves played too flat in this series to make the assertion that they should’ve won. After Game 1, they were never really in the series. Despite being the first team to force a Game 6 after trailing a series 3-0, the Braves’ wins in Games 4 and 5 did nothing to wrest control from the Padres, as evidenced by the Braves’ no-show offense in Game 6. So while the series isn’t one the Braves let get away, it’s still hard to believe 106 wins didn’t lead to more success in the postseason.\n\nRegular season record: 103-59\n\nPostseason elimination: Game 4 of the World Series\n\nIn brief: Like the Padres did to them the year before, the Braves jumped out to a 3-0 series lead in the NLCS before their opponent came roaring back to force a Game 6. That was the Mets, who went from looking dead after Game 3 to a legitimate threat to become the first team to overcome a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-seven series after a dramatic Game 5 win that’s best known for Robin Ventura’s walkoff “grand slam single.” After a back-and-forth — and nerve wracking for both sides — Game 6, the Braves finally won the pennant in the 11th inning when Kenny Rogers walked Andrus Jones with the bases loaded. The Braves then faced the Yankees in the World Series in a rematch of 1996. But it was nothing like 1996. The Braves were little match for the Yankees and were swept in four games.\n\nThe Braves lost because … the Yankees were a superior team.\n\nThe details: The Yankees in 1999 were at their peak hate-generating selves: No matter the situation, no matter the score, everyone knew deep down that they were probably going to win. Because that’s what the Yankees did. They won. All the time. Especially in the postseason. It was quite annoying for fans of other teams. But that’s just how things played out in the World Series against the Braves. Even when the Braves had leads, the baseball world — and probably the Yankees, too — knew it was just a matter of time before Derek Jeter & Co. showed up, kicked the door in and stole Braves fans’ happiness. So, there’s no reason to get bogged down in the details of how that played out in 1999. Just know that it did play out.\n\nThe critical moment: There wasn’t one. The Yankees did what most observers expected them to do — beat the Braves easily. As alluded to earlier, the Braves did hold a 1-0 lead in Game 1 until the eighth inning and led 5-1 at one point in Game 3. But in each instance, once the Yankees hit their groove in the game, it was over. Even though Game 3 went 10 innings, once the Yankees tied it in the eighth, the outcome was obvious. Chad Curtis' walkoff homer was just a formality.\n\nVerdict: No, the Braves should not have won the 1999 World Series. Despite being a rematch from three years earlier, the versions of the two teams were too different. The Braves, though better in 1999 than in 1996, were not better in the way the Yankees were better. The Yankees were an other-worldly kind of better, despite having the lesser regular season record. Both rosters had plenty of special pieces, but the Yankees had the better team.\n\nIt’s interesting to wonder, though, how the Braves’ 1999 season would’ve played out had they returned the same players as in 1998. Though the majority of the roster remained intact, the Braves were without their top run producer from 1998, Andres Galarraga, who was diagnosed with cancer before the season. They also lost their 34-homer, 106-RBI All-Star catcher, Javy Lopez, when he tore his ACL at midseason. They went the entire season without their 30-save closer, Kerry Ligtenberg, who was recovering from Tommy John surgery.\n\nBut others helped fill the void: Free agent Brian Jordan offset the loss of Galarraga with 115 RBIs, Chipper Jones had an MVP season and John Rocker saved 38 games in Ligtenberg’s place. So not much was lost, at least not enough to significantly change the outcome of the World Series. Overall, the 1999 Braves probably overachieved a bit, as their Pythagorean win-loss record was 98-64."
