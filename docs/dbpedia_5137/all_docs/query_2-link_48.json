        "text": "The Rangers were greeted “With Arms Wide Open” at the White House, along with a classical version of Creed’s “Higher” as they walked into the East Room on Thursday.\n\nThe 2023 World Series champs were in the nation’s capital to celebrate the accomplishment when they were welcomed by the 1999 hit song by Creed, which took on a special meaning during Texas’ playoff run last season.\n\nThe band’s music became a bit of a rallying cry after pitcher Andrew Heaney said that the team had started playing Creed’s music before games in the second half of the season.\n\nThe comment went viral during the playoffs, and the rock band gained a cultural relevance it hadn’t seen in a number of years.\n\nThe Rangers won the franchise’s first World Series title after knocking off the Diamondbacks in five games last fall, and inside their clubhouse, the Rangers celebrated by singing along to one of Creed’s songs capping a playoff run that saw the rock band make personal appearances at Globe Life Stadium.\n\nSo it shouldn’t have come as a surprise to anyone that a version of one of Creed’s songs was played as the Rangers filed into the East Room for the ceremony with President Joe Biden.\n\nThe president even mentioned Creed and its influence on the team in his remarks on Thursday.\n\nBiden mentioned the belief the organization had that it would be able to win a title as he referenced the band.\n\n“You never, never gave up. You kept the faith, and like your favorite band Creed, you took each other higher and higher. You really did,” Biden said.\n\nThe stop at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue came in between the end of their series with the Astros and before the start of a three-game series in Boston with the Red Sox.\n\nAs part of the trip to the White House, the Rangers gifted Biden a customized jersey with his name on the back as well as a pair of black cowboy boots."
