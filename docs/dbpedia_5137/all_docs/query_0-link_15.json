        "text": "NEW YORK — Though the Yankees, as an organization, will be watching a ninth straight World Series at home – well, they have connections.\n\nHere’s a lineup worth of links, a collection of Dodgers-Red Sox ties to the Yankees:\n\n1. Manny Machado\n\nDodgers shortstop Manny Machado is four wins away from being part of his first world championship team – which would be the first by Los Angeles since 1988.\n\nYankees fans will be wondering if his next address will be in the Bronx, while watching how he performs on MLB’s ultimate stage.\n\n2. Nathan Eovaldi\n\nBoston’s Nathan Eovaldi went 23-11 as a Yankee starter over two seasons (2015-16), before requiring a second Tommy John surgery.\n\nAcquired from the Rays in July, Eovaldi pitched well against the Yanks down the stretch – culminating in his strong seven innings to win AL Division Series Game 3.\n\nWaiting for answers: Five questions for New York Yankees to address as organizational meetings begin\n\n3. Cody Bellinger\n\nLast year’s NL Rookie of the Year and the MVP of last week’s NL Championship Series, Dodgers lefty-hitting outfielder Cody Bellinger is the son of a world champion.\n\nClay Bellinger served as a utility man on the 1999 and 2000 World Series winning Yankees and the 2001 pennant-winning club. Dad played in six World Series games and was 0-for-2 at the plate.\n\n4. Steve Pearce\n\nIn 2012, Steve Pearce was signed, sold, re-purchased and lost on waivers by the Yankees – all within six months. He played a total of 12 games in pinstripes, hitting one home run.\n\nNow, he’s the Red Sox’ right-handed, power-hitting first baseman, and his scoop of a tough throw ended the Yanks’ ninth-inning comeback and sealed the ALDS Game 4 clincher.\n\n5. Eduardo Nunez\n\nSigned at age 17 by the Yankees, Eduardo Nunez showed promise with a slashing line drive swing but struggled defensively, never finding a position in four Bronx seasons.\n\nBut he’s made it to postseason the last three seasons, with the 2016 Giants and the last two with Boston.\n\nYes, it was his throw from third base that Pearce saved, sending Boston to the ALCS.\n\nThe rotation: Brian Cashman says Yankees rotation is 'a focus point' for 2019 as internal meetings begin\n\n6. Dave Roberts\n\nDodgers skipper Dave Roberts returns to Fenway Park, where he stole his way into history in 2004.\n\nAs a Red Sox, Roberts’ ninth-inning steal of second base allowed him to score the tying run in the ninth inning of ALCS Game 4 against the Yankees (on a Bill Mueller single), setting in motion MLB’s greatest postseason series comeback.\n\nDown 0-3 in games, well, you know the rest. And Boston’s 86-year world championship drought was soon ended.\n\n7. Yasmani Grandal\n\nIf there’s an NL parallel to Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez, it’s Dodgers receiver Yasmani Grandal.\n\nHe’s averaged 24 homers per season over the past three years, but issues with passed balls – three in NLCS starts – have impacted his playing time, with the Dodgers turning to the more defensively-minded Austin Barnes.\n\n8. Charley Steiner\n\nDodgers’ radio play-by-play broadcaster Charley Steiner was in the Yankees’ booth for three seasons, as John Sterling’s last partner before Suzyn Waldman’s arrival in 2005.\n\nSteiner had the call when Aaron Boone’s 11th-inning homer in ALCS Game 7 won the 2003 pennant for the Yankees over Boston.\n\nRoom for improvement: How the New York Yankees can get better this offseason\n\n9. The field\n\nDodgers lefty Rich Hill, also a former Red Sox, made 14 relief appearances for the 2014 Yankees. Ex-Yankees catcher Bob Geren is L.A.’s bench coach and Dodgers third base coach Chris Woodward interviewed last year for the Yankees’ managerial vacancy.\n\nYankees 2012 postseason hero Raul Ibanez is a Dodgers special assistant, while Rivalry stalwarts and all-time Yankee nemesis Pedro Martinez and David Ortiz serve as Red Sox special assistants.\n\nMore NY Yankees news\n\nOn the mend: Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius undergoes Tommy John surgery\n\nHindsight: Yankees manager Aaron Boone: I should have taken Luis Severino out of Game 3 sooner'"
