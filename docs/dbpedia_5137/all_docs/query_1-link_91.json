        "text": "Fifty years after his major league debut with his homestate Detroit Tigers, the late Vern Ruhle is fondly remembered by family and friends as a kind person who never forgot the Coleman community where he grew up.\n\nRon Ruhle, his big brother by 11 months, remembers the whole Ruhle family going to see Vern pitch against the Boston Red Sox at Tiger Stadium on Sept.29, 1974. He pitched a complete game and earned the win in a 7-4 victory.\n\nVern's major league debut had come on Sept. 9 when he threw 5 1/3 shutout innings in relief for the Tigers in a game at the Cleveland Indians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n\"Vern was just a very sincere person, happy to be part of baseball at the highest level and very thankful for it,\" Ron said of his brother, who died of cancer in 2007. \"He obviously got a calling to God a little earlier than we had hoped.\"\n\nA 1969 graduate from Coleman High School, Vern was drafted by the Tigers in the 17th round of the 1972 draft and pitched for Detroit from 1974-77, for the Houston Astros from 1978-84, and for the Indians (1985) and the Los Angeles Angels (1986).\n\nHe won 67 games in his 13-year big league career and later spent nine seasons as a pitching coach with the Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds.\n\nRon said Vern won 20 games in 1974 between the minor leagues and major leagues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nVern grew up on a farm as the second oldest of seven children of Robert and Vivian Ruhle, and Ron recalls that their mother was Vern's \"biggest cheerleader.\"\n\n\"He was pretty good about sending my mother newspaper clippings that came out of the results of a game (that he pitched),\" Ron said.\n\nVern even signed his first contract with the Tigers at his parents' dining room table in Coleman.\n\n\"You can just imagine how much excitement that brought to the family,\" Ron said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nVern was interviewed several times by the late former Daily News Sports Editor Don Winger, who, like Vern, was an Olivet College graduate.\n\nRon also noted that Vern and the late Hall of Fame Tigers radio voice Ernie Harwell shared the birthday of Jan. 25.\n\n\"He became very good friends with Ernie Harwell. Every time my brother pitched, Ernie always said something extra special (about him),\" Ron said.\n\nAnother of Vern's siblings, Jane Ruhle, remembers that Vern was roommates with fellow Tigers pitcher Mark \"The Bird\" Fidrych, who captured fans' imagination with his antics on the mound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nOf course, the city of Coleman wanted to celebrate and honor Vern for getting to the big leagues.\n\n\"Not long after he made the major leagues, the city of Coleman presented the key to the city to him,\" Jane said. \"They decided to give him a police escort (into town), but Vern took a different route into town (and missed the escort).\"\n\nThe attention didn't go to his head, Jane said. And his positive attitude helped him succeed.\n\n\"Vern was very humble and very oriented toward his hometown community. A lot of his attributes he always (credited) to his hometown and being raised on a farm,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n\"If you had a chance to talk to him, he always talked about the positive events of a day,\" Jane continued. \"That kind of mental conditioning just led him into a positive career.\"\n\nVern Ruhle and the excitement of his baseball career are also remembered by George Misner, who became a counselor at Coleman High School in Vern's senior year there and spent 37 years working at the school.\n\n\"Vern was a terrific guy. He stayed that way after he made the major leagues. He was very honest, very caring about others, very polite. He was the best,\" Misner said.\n\nMisner used the word \"hero\" to describe Vern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n\"There was a sign on US-10 that said, 'Coleman, home of Vern Ruhle,'\" Misner said. \"Not many small towns produced a major league pitcher. One day in North Bradley, he came out to the old school and he signed autographs like all day long. He was just a hero.\"\n\nMore than 20 years after debuting with the Tigers, Vern, at that point the Astros' pitching coach, was still keeping in touch with Misner and left a ticket for him at an Astros-Cubs game at Wrigley Field in Chicago. They met up after the game.\n\n\"I don’t think there's anyone who met him who did not like him,\" Misner said. \"He's definitely missed.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad"
