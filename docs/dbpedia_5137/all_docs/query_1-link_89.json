        "text": "I thought in light of this being the 25th anniversary of the modern three division/wild card format I'd bring this back up...what are some other great pennant races (remember real ones from 1993 on back, no wild cards, win division/pennant or go home) in MLB history?\n\nAs for that fake one-game playoff eh, sorry \"wild card game\", I think that is among the stupidest things ever (especially when it comes the year after we get among the greatest wild card races ever in both leagues at the same time; at least in both cases it was wild card or go home, right?)...though I concede it does make winning the divisions more important AND as Bob Costas suggested in his Fair Ball book, the team in each league with the best record DOES get home field in the LDS (no not the church) and LCS.\n\nI checked this book out at my local library a few times and now that it's available for virtual checkout at archive.org (happy 25th anniversary!) I thought I'd show the rest of you:\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/sportingnewssele0000reid_u2m5\n\nI guess that was my original inspiration for this topic in the first place. Are we really approaching the 30th anniversary of the last true pennant race (1993 NL West)?\n\n1967 American League. You are welcome. Tigers/ Red Sox/ Twins down to the last day. No divisions. Do or die. I was six that year and listened to as many games as I could under my blankets after bedtime with my red transistor hand held radio. I was so hooked\n\nWith six weeks left 4 teams tied for first\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/1967-American-League-Pennant-Race/dp/1476672962\n\nFinal standings\n\nm\n\nIn 1962, I listened to Giants on the radio like only a third grader can who's addicted to beesa- ball. Russ Hodges ( who called the 51 shot heard round the world) and Lon Simmons was his co-announcer. I grew up with them. When you listen to the Thompson shot or Mays catch against Cleveland it's Hodges voice. As good as any announcers that lived. Except maybe John Miller for the Giants. Listen to Miller doing an impression of a Japanese Vin Scully on YouTube before it gets 'woked'. ROFL."
