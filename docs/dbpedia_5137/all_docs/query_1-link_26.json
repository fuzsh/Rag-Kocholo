        "text": "Since the World Series debuted in 1903, only five current teams have failed to win baseball’s biggest prize.\n\nThat list grew shorter in 2023 when the Texas Rangers won their first Fall Classic in their 62nd year of existence, avenging painful World Series defeats in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThat leaves only five clubs that are still searching for their first World Series trophy heading into the 2024 season. Several of them have promising futures odds, but others will likely need to wait at least one more year.\n\nBetting on a First-Time MLB Winner\n\nEntering the 2024 season, DraftKings Sportsbook offered a prop bet on whether one of those five teams without a World Series title would break through. The wager had bettors answering “yes” or “no” on whether there would be a first-time World Series winner in 2024.\n\nMLB First-Time WS Winner\n\nYes: +900\n\nNo: -1400\n\nYou might be wondering what the sports betting odds mean.\n\nFor those new to baseball betting, a bettor who put $100 on the “yes” wager would profit $900 if one of those five teams wins it all. When considering a wager like this, remember that betting “yes” is like a futures bet where you get several chances to win. A bettor who took the “no” side has to risk $1,400 to profit $100.\n\nNow, let’s look at the teams who have never won the World Series.\n\nMLB Teams With No World Series\n\nColorado Rockies\n\nThe Colorado Rockies entered MLB as an expansion franchise in 1993. Considering that, the team found quick success by grabbing three third-place finishes and a second-place finish in four of their first five seasons. That second-place finish included an NLDS appearance that saw the Rockies fall to the Atlanta Braves in four games but earned Don Baylor Manager of the Year honors.\n\nA dry stretch followed, with the Rockies not making the playoffs again until 2007. The team won 14 of their final 15 games to rally down the stretch for a second-place finish in the NL West, snagging a playoff appearance.\n\nThe Rockies then proved to be a juggernaut, knocking off the Phillies 3-0 in the NLDS. They followed up with another sweep in four games of the Diamondbacks for the team’s first and only pennant. The improbable run earned them the nickname “Rocktober,” with players like Matt Holliday and Todd Helton leading the way.\n\nHowever, the fun ended in the World Series after getting swept by the Boston Red Sox. The club has made only three playoff appearances since, with a lone postseason win in the 2018 Wild Card.\n\nMilwaukee Brewers\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers may have caused many fans to tip back a few beers after qualifying for the postseason only twice in the club’s first 30 years. The team debuted in 1969 and finally saw an ALDS appearance in 1981 after a strike cut short about one-third of the league’s games that year.\n\nMilwaukee took advantage and scraped together the team’s second-best finish since the franchise entered the league. The Brewers lost to the Yankees in five, but returning to the postseason a year later proved that ‘81 wasn’t a fluke.\n\nThe team again won the AL East, with Robin Yount, Paul Molitor and Cecil Cooper showing some power from the plate. The 1982 season proved the best in Brewers history, with the team advancing to the World Series but falling in Game 7 to the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nFrom 1983 to 2007, the franchise missed the playoffs but finally returned in 2008, only to lose to the Phillies in the NLDS. Another NLCS appearance followed in 2011, with four straight playoff appearances from 2018-21 and another appearance in 2023. None of those have matched that miracle season of 1982, however.\n\nSan Diego Padres\n\nAfter debuting in 1969, the San Diego Padres struggled before making the club’s first postseason appearance in 1984. That playoff drought came despite possessing two Cy Young winners, Randy Jones and Gaylord Perry, and 1976 Rookie of the Year winner Butch Metzger.\n\nThat 1984 season proved magical for Padres fans, beating the Cubs 3-2 in the ALDS but falling to the Detroit Tigers in five games in the World Series. The Padres saw more success in the mid-’90s with a pair of division titles.\n\nThe second of those division titles, in 1996, saw the Padres advance to the World Series thanks to great seasons by players like Tony Gwynn, Greg Vaughn, Ken Caminiti, Andy Ashby and Kevin Brown. But the season ended with a sweep by the Yankees.\n\nAnother drought ensued for the franchise from 1999 to 2019, with only two postseason appearances, both losses. Some recent years have been better, with the Padres finishing runner-up in 2020 and 2022 in the NL West and advancing to the NLDS and NLCS before missing the playoffs again in 2023.\n\nSeattle Mariners\n\nSince the Seattle Mariners debuted in 1977, they have struggled and are the only franchise on this list without a World Series appearance. Despite legends like Ken Griffey Jr., Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez and Ichiro Suzuki suiting up for Seattle, winning seasons have been rare.\n\nThe Mariners’ first playoff appearance came in 1995 with an AL West title. After dispatching the Yankees in five games in the ALDS, the run ended against Cleveland in the ALCS. Randy Johnson earned the Cy Young award, and Lou Pinella was voted Manager of the Year.\n\nThe Mariners were back in the postseason two years later but fell in the ALDS to the Orioles despite Griffey earning MVP honors. After solid seasons in 2000 and 2001, the Mariners fell in the ALCS to the Yankees in both years. Some solace? The Yanks won the Series in 2000.\n\nThe team then suffered a 21-year postseason drought before returning in 2022, finishing second in the AL West before getting swept by the division leader Astros, who went on to win the World Series. Seattle finished one game short of the postseason in 2023 and still waits on its first World Series appearance.\n\nTampa Bay Rays\n\nDespite numerous top-notch seasons since the franchise’s debut in 1998, the Rays are yet to bag the ultimate prize in baseball. It seems the team makes a playoff run every few years but falls short.\n\nThe latest came in the shortened Covid-19 bubble season in 2020, when the Rays played the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. The team lost in six games after finishing first in the AL East for the third year since 2010.\n\nThe Rays looked every bit of an expansion franchise for the team’s first decade in existence. The club never found a winning season and finished no higher than fourth in any of those seasons. But 2008 brought a dream season, with the Rays winning the AL East and advancing to the World Series. The team lost to the Phillies in five games, but Evan Longoria earned Rookie of the Year, and Joe Madden took Manager of the Year."
