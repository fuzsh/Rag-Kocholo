        "text": "[Congressional Record (Bound Edition), Volume 145 (1999), Part 21] [Senate] [Pages 29942-29943] [From the U.S. Government Publishing Office, www.gpo.gov] PEDRO MARTINEZ WINS 1999 AMERICAN LEAGUE CY YOUNG AWARD Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us in Massachusetts know that Pedro [[Page 29943]] Martinez, the great pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, is the class of the American League. Yesterday, the Baseball Writers' Association of America confirmed that judgment by unanimously selecting Pedro Martinez as the winner of the Cy Young Award for the American League for 1999. Pedro's record this year was brilliant. His 23 victories, his earned run average of 2.07, and his 313 strikeouts led the league in all three of those categories, and his dramatic victory over the New York Yankees in the third game of the American League Championship Series last month was the crowning achievement in his extraordinary season. All of us in Boston are proud of the Red Sox and proud of Pedro Martinez. I congratulate him on this well-deserved recognition, and I ask unanimous consent that a ``Red Sox News Flash'' about the award be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Red Sox News Flash, Nov. 16, 1999 This afternoon Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez was selected the 1999 American League Cy Young award winner by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. The voting was unanimous, with Pedro finishing with 140 points, including all 28 first place votes. Martinez led the American League in seven major pitching categories, including wins (23), ERA (2.07) and strikeouts (313), becoming the first Red Sox pitcher to lead the AL in those three categories since Cy Young in 1901. Martinez' 2.07 ERA was more than a run less than New York's David Cone, who ranked 2nd in ERA at 3.44. The right-hander also became the third pitcher to win the award in both leagues, joining Randy Johnson (1995 in AL & 1999 in NL) and Gaylord Perry (1972 in AL & 1978 in NL). He also becomes the fifth pitcher to win the award with two different clubs. Pedro's 313 strikeouts in 1999 set a new Red Sox single season record. Martinez became the first American League pitcher with 300 or more strikeouts in a season since Randy Johnson in 1993 with Seattle (308) and he is one of 14 different pitchers to have struck out 300 or more batters in a season. He is the second pitcher in Major League History to achieve 300 or more strikeouts in both leagues (Randy Johnson is the other). Pedro is only the 9th player in Major League History to strike out 300 or more batters in a season more than once: joining Nolan Ryan (6x), Sandy Koufax (3x), Randy Johnson (3x, including '99), Sam McDowell (2x), Curt Schilling (2x), Walter Johnson (2x) and J.R. Richard (2x). The Dominican Republic native tossed his 2nd career 1 hitter on September 10th at New York and set a career high with 17 strikeouts (tying the Major League season-high in 1999). Martinez became the first Red Sox pitcher to win 20 games since Roger Clemens in 1990 (21-6) and the first Sox pitcher other than Clemens since Dennis Eckersley in 1978. He also set a team record by striking out 10 or more batters 19 times in a season. He became the first right-handed pitcher to record 15 or more strikeouts 6 times in a season since Nolan Ryan in 1974. Pedro struck out the side 18 times in his 213.1 IP and has struck out 10 or more batters 54 times in his career, 27 times as a Red Sox. Pedro Martinez becomes the third Red Sox pitcher to win the Cy Young award, joining Roger Clemens (1986, 1987 & 1991) and Jim Lonborg (1967). He is only the fifth AL Cy Young Award winner to be selected unanimously since 1967, when the award was first presented to a pitcher in both the American League and National League.
