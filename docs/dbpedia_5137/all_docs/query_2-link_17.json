        "text": "Description\n\nAs baseball prepared to close its books on the twentieth century, it seemed fitting that the team who had dominated most of it was returning for their thirty-sixth Fall Classic. Following one-hundred fourteen regular season wins and eleven post season victories (the most by any team in one-hundred twenty-three years of Major League baseball) as well as a four game sweep in the Series, the perennial champion New York Yankees were back and ready to cement their title as Team of the Century. Manager Joe Torre was ready for another sweep as his Yankees won the American League Division Series over the Texas Rangers (3-0) and the Championship Series (4-1) over Boston Red Sox. The Bronx Bombers had scored a whopping nine-hundred runs and answered the critics who felt that the record-setting '98 season had been a fluke. The Atlanta Braves had risen as a dominant force in the National League over the last decade and were returning for their ninth Series (winning titles in three different cities). Despite some heavy-hitters and the Cy Young winning combo of Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux, the Braves were no match for the Yankees juggernaut. Behind their own Cy Young winning combo of Roger Clemens and David Cone, the Yankess pitched and slugged their way to a series sweep of the Braves. Offered here is a salesman's sample version of the championship trophy produced by Balfour in commemoration of the Yankees 1999 World Championship. Standing a full 25 in. tall, these full-sized trophies were produced in far less quantities than the miniature replica versions more often seen in the marketplace. Near mint condition overall."
