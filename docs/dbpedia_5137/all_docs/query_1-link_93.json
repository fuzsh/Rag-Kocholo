It simply feels like my home away from home.\n\nHarmony Buchanan\n\nClass of 2024\n\nPsychology\n\nAs a transfer student, meeting new people was intimidating at first. Everyone I've met so far has been incredibly supportive. Transferring to SUNY Fredonia has been an enriching experience that's helped me grow academically, professionally, and socially. I've quickly built new meaningful connections that will last well beyond my time at Fredonia.\n\nHunter Burczyk\n\nClass of 2024\n\nBiology\n\nMy favorite spot is the cozy café area in the RAC center, with those plush chairs facing huge windows. There's something so uplifting about soaking in the daylight and natural views. The staff is always so welcoming, and the variety is amazing -- whether I'm craving a bacon, egg and cheese wrap or just a blueberry bagel. I never leave disappointed.\n\nCaitlyn Hampe\n\nClass of 2027\n\nEarly Childhood/Childhood Education\n\nIt’s like a home away from home. It’s a safe environment to learn, hang out with friends, get work done, and prepare for my future.\n\nEthan J Thompson\n\nClass of 2025\n\nMusic Education\n\nFredonia's campus is so welcoming that it's easy to get involved. Last semester, I attended my first activities night and joined the Fredonia Women's Rugby team - one of the best decisions I've ever made. I found my community, my family, right here at Fredonia.\n\nMorgan Brown\n\nClass of 2027\n\nMusic Education\n\nI've met a lot of people in clubs and organizations whom I wouldn't know otherwise. It's really cool to meet people who are so encouraging for you to try new things. You never know what opportunities you might bump into or who you might connect with.\n\nRebekah Gerace\n\nClass of 2027\n\nPhotography"
