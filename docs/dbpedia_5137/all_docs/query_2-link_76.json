        "text": "The Yankees have apparently become so futile that their fans grasp at any positive development to root for. They found one in the seventh inning of a lopsided game yesterday when Derek Jeter beat the ball into the ground along the third-base line and raced to first base for a single.\n\nThe crowd of 45,824 at Yankee Stadium, which had watched another inept effort by the home team, cheered lustily. Jeter, who had made outs his first three times at bat, was on base for the 35th consecutive game, all of the games the Yankees have played this season. No other major league player has reached base in every one of his team's games.\n\nBut neither sidelights nor consolation prizes win games, and the Yankees tumbled to the Chicago White Sox, 12-4, for their fifth consecutive loss. Jeter's 60-foot single actually ignited the most promising inning the Yankees have had in the past four games, but later in the inning Tino Martinez, who had just cracked a two-run double, ended it prematurely by being thrown out at the plate on Chili Davis's single to center field.\n\nThe Yankees' four runs were double the number they had scored in their previous three games combined, but they mattered little because the White Sox battered Ramiro Mendoza for seven runs in the first two innings, six of them in the second."
