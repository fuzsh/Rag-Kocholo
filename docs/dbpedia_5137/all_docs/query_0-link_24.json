        "text": "The World Series is the ultimate culmination of every Major League Baseball season. It's played between the playoff finalist from the American League and National League, and has taken place every year since 1903.\n\nHouston Astros or Baltimore Orioles: who runs the AL & are the Yankees World Series contenders?\n\nOver the years, several teams have become MLB champions by winning multiple World Series titles. The New York Yankees hold the record with 27 championships, while the St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 and the Boston Red Sox have won nine. Other teams like the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Oakland Athletics have also made their mark with many championships.\n\nThroughout World Series history, there have been many unforgettable moments, like Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run in 1960 that led the Pittsburgh Pirates to victory.
