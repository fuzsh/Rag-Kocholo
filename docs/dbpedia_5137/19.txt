The 2000 New York Yankees were gearing up for another title run. The franchise had won World Series titles in both 1998 and 1999, marking them just the second team since the Big Red Machine of 1975-76 to win consecutive World Series titles. Now they were aiming to be the first team since the Oakland A’s of 1972-74 to win three in a row

Baseball fans in the Bronx experienced a lot of frustration in a short historical period that started in 1983. The Yankees were never bad—indeed, the typical high expectations that come with Pinstripes were in place every spring. But through most of the 1980s, the Yanks were just good enough to tease and then come up […]

The 1984 New York Yankees were a team going through some big transitions. After the renaissance era of 1976-81—a period where the proud franchise won five AL East titles, four American League pennants and two World Series titles—the Yankees were slipping behind other contenders in their rigorous division. And a difficult offseason would make ’84 […]

The 1983 New York Yankees were in an unusual position. They were coming off a losing season. After the great Renaissance Era of 1976-81 when the Yanks won four American League pennants and a pair of World Series titles, they suffered through their first sub-.500 season since 1967.

The New York Yankees were riding high in the late 1970s, even amidst a circus. They won an American League pennant in 1976. In 1977, the Yanks took the next step and won it all. They went back-to-back in 1978, and did it all with flair, plenty of internal drama and two different managers, Billy […]

It’s hard to imagine the New York Yankees playing anything but winning baseball. But from 1989-92, they were a sub-.500 team all four years, the completion of a gradual descent from relevance that took place throughout the 1980s. Under second-year manager Buck Showalter, the 1993 New York Yankees got back on the winning side of […]

Dent’s home run has earned him the nickname “Bucky (expletive) Dent” in New England, but there was more drama packed in these final three innings then there were in the first six.

The 1986 New York Yankees continued a pattern of close-but-not-quite. After the glory years of 1976-81 when they won two World Series and four American League pennants, the Yankees spent the early and middle part of the decade with high expectations, mostly winning teams, but no playoff appearances.

Billy Martin made one of his many famous returns to the 1985 New York Yankees, trying to rediscover the organization’s disappearing championship mojo. Billy led the Yanks on an up-and-down ride through the 1985 season and nearly caught the Toronto Blue Jays, but came up a bit short in the end.

There was a renaissance in New York Yankees history that started in the mid-to-late 1970s. The proud franchise had last reached the World Series in 1964 and after the team was sold to CBS, a period of irrelevance and bad teams followed. Yankee Stadium itself underwent renovations and the team had to share Shea Stadium with the Mets while the work was being completed. 1976 was the year the renaissance arrived and it continued until 1981.

The revival of the proud franchise that started in 1976 and produced two World Series titles (1977 and 1978), was about to disappear for more than a decade. But 1981, in the midst of a year marred by a players’ strike, the Yankees made one more run to an American League pennant.

The A’s won three straight pennants from 1972-74, taking the World Series each time. The Yankees won three straight pennants from 1976-78 and grabbed two Series titles. But the teams’ paths had never crisscrossed in October. That changed when they met in the 1981 ALCS.

An interesting subplot was that Oakland’s revival was under the leadership of manager Billy Martin, who had also restored to the Yankees to prominence five years earlier.
