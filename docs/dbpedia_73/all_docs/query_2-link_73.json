        "text": "Climate Summary for July 2024\n\nClimate Summary for July 2024:Wednesday, July 31 brought some strong thunderstorms across the state, delivering some widespread heavy rains. Some were record-setting. A few examples:\n\n4.10 inches at Theilman\n\n3.27 inches at Owatonna\n\n3.11 inches at Wells\n\n2.82 inches at Austin\n\n2.60 inches at Faribault\n\n2.04 inches at Albert Lea\n\n2.03 inches at Lamberton\n\nSince these heavy rains occurred in the evening and overnight, many of these amounts will be logged for August 1st rather than for July 31st.\n\nFrom a temperature standpoint the average monthly temperature was very close to normal in most areas of Minnesota, expect the far north where it was 2° to 3°F above normal. All areas of the state reported fewer than nomal 90°F days. Extremes ranged from 94°F at Brainerd on July 27th to 36°F at Kabetogama on July 2nd.\n\nEven though there were few 90°F days, the National Weather Service had to issue Heat Advisories on several days during the month, because of dew points in the 70s F. These dewpoints of 70°F occurred on July 13, 14, 15, 26, 27, 28, 29,30, and 31. In fact on July 26th and July 31st some climate stations reported dew points of 80°F or greater. These 80°F dew points combined with temperatures in the upper 80s F to low 90s F produced some unusually high Heat Index values in western and southern Minnesota. Some examples:\n\nJuly 26, Fergus Falls (Otter Tail County) Heat Index 112°F\n\nJuly 26, Madison (Lac Qui Parle County) Heat Index 114°F\n\nJuly 31, St James (Watonwan County) Heat Index 105°F\n\nJuly 31, Tracy (Lyon County) Heat Index 105°F\n\nFrom a rainfall perspective, most areas of the state reported a wetter than normal month of July, except for north-central and northeastern counties, which were drier than normal. Areas of northeaster Minnesota received only about half of normal July rainfall.\n\nWithin the statewide climate network, over 30 stations reported July rainfall totals of 6 inches or greater. At least 31 new daily rainfall records were reported from the network of climate stations, including many amounts over 2 inches.\n\nWith the additions of this July rainfall the state remains on a pace to record its wettest year in history (since 1895 when statewide records started), as the average precipitation for the year across the state is just under 22 inches. Over 50 official climate stations have reported greater than 30 inches of precipitation so far this year, and Wells (Faribault County) has reported over 40 inches (40.07 inches), just in the first 7 months of the year.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri: Canada’s CBC reported this week that the glaciers in Jasper and other parts of Alberta are melting at an alarming rate, partially enhanced by the deposition of ash and soot from wildfires which allows the ice to absorb more solar radiation. Researchers say melting glaciers in Western Canada could disrupt the flow of glacier-fed rivers, impacting water supply and hydroelectric power generation in the region.\n\nThis week’s AGU-EOS Bulletin features an article about the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires. It is based on some research published in journal Nature, Ecology, and Evolution. Based on 21 years of satellite data, the past six years have been the most extreme years for wildfires globally, with worsening occurrences mostly in boreal and temperature conifer biomes\n\nMPR listener question: We have been Morning Edition listeners for years and recall you and Cathy talking many times about the coldest places in the state of Minnesota (Embarrass, Tower, and Brimson among other places). But we are wondering, what are most commonly the warmest places in the state?\n\nAnswer:\n\nGood question. More often than not, the warmest temperatures for the day are from southwestern or west-central counties, including places like Browns Valley, Milan, Montevideo, Canby, Granite Falls, and Madison. Many of these places more commonly report temperatures of 100°F in the summer than other locations in the state.\n\nSometimes in the winter season the warmest temperatures are reported from southern locations like Fairmont, Luverne, Caledonia, or Winona where there is little or no snow cover. Believe it or not in some years with little snow cover, temperatures have reached 70°F in parts of Minnesota in all months but January. It came close on January 24 of 1981 when in the absence of snow cover Montevideo reached 69°F!\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for August 2nd: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 83 degrees F (plus or minus 7 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 65 degrees F (plus or minus 6 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for August 2nd:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 99 degrees F in 1988; lowest daily maximum temperature of 59 degrees F in 1915; lowest daily minimum temperature of 46 degrees F in 1971; highest daily minimum temperature of 80 degrees F in 1955, and record precipitation of 2.69 inches in 2006. No snowfall has occurred on this date.\n\nAverage dew point for August 2nd is 60°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 79°F in 1955 and the minimum dew point on this date is 39 degrees F in 1927.\n\nAll-time state records for August 2nd: The state record high temperature for this date is 106 degrees F at Beardsley (Big Stone County) in 1958. The state record low temperature for this date is 28 degrees F at Tower (St Louis County) in 1977. The state record precipitation for this date is 7.03 inches at Agassiz Wildlife Refuge (Marshall County) in 1964. There has been no snowfall on this date.\n\nPast Weather:\n\nAugust 1st of 1953 brought strong thunderstorms to central Minnesota where 3-5 inches of rain fell in a matter of hours, flooding farm fields and closing many roads. It was the beginning of a very wet month of August when some climate stations reported 7 to 11 inches of rainfall for the month.\n\nHigh pressure and clear skies brought cool morning low temperatures to northern Minnesota on August 2nd of 1977. Many climate stations reported record low temperatures in the 30s F. At Tower (St Louis County) it dipped to just 28°F.\n\nBy far the warmest August 2nd in history was in 1988 when climate stations in 23 Minnesota counties reported afternoon temperatures of 100°F or greater. The nighttime low temperature at Stillwater was a very uncomfortable 81°F.\n\nOutlook:\n\nWarmer than normal over the weekend with a chance for showers and thunderstorms late in the day on Saturday. Better chance for showers on Sunday and into Monday. Showers and thunderstorms will be more widespread and longer lasting on Monday, as a cooler air mass moves in. Temperatures will cool to below normal values for Monday through Thursday next week, with slight chances for showers each day.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nWetness Continues in July\n\nWetness Continues in July:Many climate observers have reported heavy rains again this month, especially in west-central and southeastern Minnesota. Areas in Wabasha and Winona Counties have reported over 6 inches of rain so far this month, and in the west Montevideo and Alexandria have reported over 5.5 inches of rain so far. Within the statewide climate station network there have been at least 28 new daily record rainfalls set so far this month.\n\nIn this context, I thought it would be good to compare some year-to-date precipitation amounts with our climate history.\n\nThe wettest year-to-date statewide average precipitation (Jan 1-Jul 23) was in 1993 with a value of 21.20 inches. Here are the top 5 historically:\n\n1993 21.20”\n\n1897 20.61”\n\n1999 20.48”\n\n1953 20.46”\n\n2014 20.31”\n\nThe value for the statewide average precipitation in 2024 so far is a new record 21.22 inches. This is a remarkable high number considering that we started the year with January and February delivering below normal precipitation averages across the state, and March bringing only near normal values of total precipitation. It is the abundant precipitation of April, May, June, and July so far that has produced this record clip of wetness. Over 35 DNR-State Climatology Office observers have reported over 30 inches of precipitation this year. At this level, it is a given that many climate stations in the state will likely end up with over 50 inches of precipitation for the year 2024, a number that is equivalent to the average annual amount in Athens, GA. Some heavy rains across the state during the remainder of the year could push some locations toward the statewide annual precipitation record of 60.21 inches at Harmony (Fillmore County) in 2018.\n\nA few striking examples of surplus precipitation from the state climate network may help illustrate this point:\n\nWells (Faribault County) 36.96” of year-to-date precipitation, normal annual is 34.51”\n\nFaribault (Rice County) 34.68” of year-to-date precipitation, normal annual is 35.45”\n\nMankato (Blue Earth County) 32.51” of year-to-date-precipitation, normal annual is 36.40”\n\nThese large amounts of precipitation are due to both heavy individual daily rainfalls, but also the frequency of days that have brought rain, which is up to 20 percent more than the historical average frequency.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the rest of the year brings.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri: There is an interesting article posted this week on the Weather Underground web site that documents the maximum 24-hr rainfall recorded in each state historically. It is noteworthy to see that both Texas and Hawaii have reported record-daily rainfall values over 40 inches. Among the states around the Great Likes the highest recorded daily rainfall values are 16.9 inches in Illinois and 15.1 inches in Minnesota. In the drier western states the values are lower, with a maximum daily value of just 5.1 inches in Utah.\n\nThe BBC Weather Center reports this week on analysis by the U.K. Met Office that shows the frequency of “hot days” (above 86°F) is increasing across most of the country. In addition the frequency of heavy rainfall is also on the increase for many areas, with a number of record-setting rainfalls in recent years.\n\nA new study in the journal Science Advances documents the importance of Saharan Dust in the rainfall produced by hurricanes over the Atlantic and Gulf States in the southeastern USA. Depending on the density of the dust plumes as they migrate across the Atlantic Ocean, they may have the effect of either enhancing rainfall from tropical storms, or in some cases suppressing the formation of tropical storms. The authors suggest that further study of the detailed effects of these dust plumes may help hurricane forecasting.\n\nMPR listener question: With all the surplus rainfall and flooding this year, we were wondering if there is any place in Minnesota that is recording below normal precipitation for 2024?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI checked the climate network reports carefully making sure there were not missing data and the driest areas of the state this year on in parts of the Red River Valley and north-central counties. But most of these are still close to normal precipitation for the year, or even a little bit wetter than normal. For example, Ada in the Red River Valley (Norman County) reports 15.35 inches of precipitation so far in 2024 and their normal amount by this time is 15.29 inches. In contrast, many climate stations are reporting total precipitation so far that is 5 to 10 inches above normal, and some are in the range of 12 to 15 inches above normal.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for July 26th: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 83 degrees F (plus or minus 7 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 65 degrees F (plus or minus 6 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for July 26th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 100 degrees F in 1955; lowest daily maximum temperature of 68 degrees F in 1972; lowest daily minimum temperature of 45 degrees F in 1962; highest daily minimum temperature of 76 degrees F in 1931, and record precipitation of 2.44 inches in 1990. No snowfall has occurred on this date.\n\nAverage dew point for July 26th is 60°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 77°F in 2003; and the minimum dew point on this date is 37 degrees F in 1974.\n\nAll-time state records for July 26th: The state record high temperature for this date is 107 degrees F at Beardsley (Big Stone County) in 1931. The state record low temperature for this date is 27 degrees F at Tower (St Louis County) in 1980 and at Kelliher (Beltrami County) in 2001. The state record precipitation for this date is 6.52 inches at St Peter (Nicollet County) in 2020. There has been no snowfall on this date.\n\nPast Weather: By far the warmest July 26 in state history was in 1931 when 32 Minnesota counties reported an afternoon temperature of 100°F or greater. In western Minnesota, the overnight low temperature in Wheaton and Alexandria never fell below 80°F.\n\nHeavy thunderstorms brought 2 to 4 inches of rain to southwestern Minnesota on July 26 of 1968. Many farm fields were flooded and drainage ditches were running a capacity.\n\nJuly 26 in 1080 brought frosts to portions of north-central and northeastern Minnesota. The temperature fell to just 27°F at Tower in St Louis County.\n\nOutlook:\n\nWarm and humid over the weekend with a chance for showers and thunderstorms in northern Minnesota, but mostly dry in the south. Increasing clouds on Sunday with a chance for showers or thunderstorms by evening in most areas, perhaps carrying over into Monday in southern counties. All of next week will bring warmer than normal temperatures with chances for widely scattered thunderstorms.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nMinnesota WeatherTalk to return on July 26\n\nThanks for being a reader!\n\nANR\n\nWet and Cool July Pattern About to Change\n\nWet and Cool July Pattern About to Change:\n\nJuly continues to be somewhat cooler than normal (1°F to 3°F below normal) and certainly wetter than normal so far, especially in west-central and southeastern counties. Many climate observers have already reported over 2.5 inches of rain so far. Portions of Olmsted, Freeborn, and Winona Counties have reported over 4 inches of rain. Within the state climate reporting network over a dozen new daily rainfall amounts have been reported mostly from spotty thunderstorms. Some examples:\n\n2.36 inches at Baudette (Lake of the Woods County) on July 1st\n\n2.15 inches at Waskish (Beltrami County) on July 2nd\n\n2.20 inches at Bruno (Pine County) on July 5th\n\n1.90 inches at Zumbrota (Goodhue County) on July 5th\n\n1.70 inches at Litchfield (Meeker County) on July 5th\n\n1.60 inches at Lamberton (Redwood County) on July 10th\n\n2.10 inches at Milaca (Mille Lacs County) on July 10th\n\nWith the addition of a wet start to July there are over a dozen climate stations that now report over 30 inches of precipitation for the year so far. Wells in Faribault County reports almost 34 inches of precipitation this year which is 98 percent of their annual normal (34.51 inches). Unbelievable!\n\nAccording to the NOAA Climate Prediction Center Outlook models starting this weekend and running through the rest of July, the weather pattern for Minnesota will become warmer than normal and drier than normal. Not expected to be record-setting in this pattern shift, but nevertheless a significant shift in moisture.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri:\n\nAccording to the NOAA National Weather Service in Houston, Texas web site, Hurricane Beryl brought a great deal of damage to coastal and eastern regions of the state. Many climate stations reported rainfalls ranging from 6 to 14 inches, causing widespread flash flooding. Wind gusts ranged from 50 mph to 97 mph and there were a few tornadoes as well. Certainly Beryl was one of the most damaging hurricanes historically for so early in the season, knocking out power to millions of residents.\n\nAccording to the BBC the state of Assam in northeastern Indian experience torrential rains and widespread flooding earlier this week. The flooding was some of the worst in years. Thousands of villages were submerged and many roads and bridges damaged. At the Kaziranga Naational Park, over a 130 animals were killed by the flooding, including six very rare one-horned rhinos.\n\nMPR listener question:\n\nIn the past we have heard you remark that 2019 was the wettest year in Minnesota state history when the average yearly precipitation across the state was over 35 inches. We are wondering if this year (2024) is on a pace to surpass 2019?\n\nAnswer:\n\nGood question. So far this year the statewide average precipitation since January 1st is a little over 20.28 inches. At the same point in time (July 11) in 2019 the statewide average precipitation was 17.25 inches. So, indeed precipitation across the state this year is running in greater surplus than it was in 2019, the statewide wettest year.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for July 12th:\n\nThe average MSP high temperature for this date is 84 degrees F (plus or minus 7 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 66 degrees F (plus or minus 7 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for July 12th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 106 degrees F in 1936; lowest daily maximum temperature of 67 degrees F in 1926; lowest daily minimum temperature of 48 degrees F in 1941; highest daily minimum temperature of 83 degrees F in 1936, and record precipitation of 2.93 inches in 1912. No snowfall has occurred on this date.\n\nAverage dew point for July 12th is 61°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 80°F in 1995; and the minimum dew point on this date is 39 degrees F in 1926.\n\nAll-time state records for July 12th:\n\nThe state record high temperature for this date is 111 degrees F at Canby (Yellow Medicine County) in 1936. The state record low temperature for this date is 27 degrees F at Tower (St Louis County) in 1975. The state record precipitation for this date is 5.45 inches at Buffalo (Wright County) in 1961. There has been no snowfall on this date.\n\nWords of the Week: Tipple Cloud\n\nThis term is occasionally used to refer to a cloud which dumps excessive amounts of rain as\n\nit passes over an elevated spot in a landscape, such as a hill or mountain. It is taken from mining\n\nterminology. Coal mines and other mines often had tipples constructed near their entrances\n\nwhere the ore and mining waste from carts could be dumped and sorted.\n\nPast Weather:\n\nThe worst Heat Wave historically occurred in July of 1936, and on the 12th nearly every spot in Minnesota reported an afternoon temperature of 100°F or greater. The coldest spot in the state was 98°F at Two Harbors. It was 106°F as far north as Littlefork (Koochiching County), and the overnight low never dropped below 81°F in Itasca State Park.\n\nOne of the worst Heat Waves in the modern record occurred over July 12-14, 1995. Dew point spiked into the mid 70s to low 80s F across Minnesota, producing Heat Index Values from 105°F to 117°F over the three days. In central Minnesota there were reports of hundreds of thousands of turkeys killed by the heat. In the city of Chicago, hundreds of citizens died during this Heat Wave.\n\nJuly 12-13, 1995 also brought strong thunderstorms and a derecho (straight line wind storm) to many parts of northern Minnesota. Many areas reported wind gusts of 70 mph to 100 mph. Especially hard hit was Itasca State Park where many ancient trees were uprooted or broken off by the high winds. The park had to be closed for a time. Many climate stations reported 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain.\n\nOutlook:\n\nWarm and humid over the weekend and into Monday with a chance for widely scattered showers and thunderstorms both Saturday night and Sunday night. Showers may be more likely in northern areas of the state. Many places will see temperatures reach 90°F or greater in the afternoon. Dew points will also rise into the 70s F Sunday and Monday producing more uncomfortable conditions and keeping nights warm. Some areas may see a Heat Index rise to close to 100°F. A cool front will bring in more moderate temperatures by Tuesday of next week.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nPrecipitation for the first half of 2024\n\nPrecipitation for the first half of 2024:The first few days of July have started cooler and wetter than normal. The wetness signature carries on a 3-month long trend.\n\nAfter starting the year with three drier than normal months (Jan-Mar), Minnesota reported a record-setting wet April through June with unsurpassed surplus of precipitation. Over 120 climate stations have already reported over 25 inches of precipitation through the first half of the year. Communities in Rice, Faribault, and Wabasha Counties have reported over 30 inches of precipitation so far. At least 60 communities are reporting 2024 precipitation amounts that are from 6 to 12 inches above normal.\n\nAs we look around the state the annual normal precipitation varies from around 24 inches in northwestern counties to as high as 37 inches in southeastern counties. Many climate stations already report between 70 to 90 percent of normal annual precipitation, and the year is only half concluded! Even if precipitation is close to normal for the remainder of the year, places like Faribault (Rice County), Waseca (Waseca County), Winnebago (Faribault County), Windom (Cottonwood County), Elgin (Wabasha County), and Albert Lea (Freeborn County) could end up the year with over 50 inches of precipitation, remarkable totals especially following three dry years. These abrupt and dramatic shifts in the annual and seasonal climate signature for our region (dry to wet for example) are symptomatic of climate change in the mid latitudes.\n\nPerhaps one of the all-time rapid turn arounds in our precipitation climate signature occurred from 1976 to 1977. Some examples from those years: Morris (Stevens County) reported just 8.32 inches of precipitation in 1976, then 34.07 inches in 1977; Waseca (Waseca County) reported just 17.43 inches of precipitation in 1976, then 40.98 inches in 1977.\n\nMost of the NOAA seasonal climate outlook models favor that the balance of 2024 will be drier than normal for our area of the country. I am not sure that I fully believe that, but we’ll see.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri: The BBC Weather Center web site features a good description of the terrible damage done to Jamaica this week by Hurricane Beryl, the strongest Atlantic hurricane for so early in the season (Category 4 with winds up to 130 mph). Wind and flooding damages were reported to be widespread.\n\nA study in Geophysical Research Letters reveals that painting roofs with white paint or covering them with highly reflective materials can have more impact on reducing the urban heat island effect in cities, rather than using green roof technology (vegetation coverings). This study was specifically focused on London.\n\nMPR listener question: Here in Wells, MN (Faribault County) we have had over 31 inches of rainfall for the first six months of 2024. Is that a record?\n\nAnswer: Yes, according to the climate history of Wells, you have recorded the wettest ever first six months of the year. I might add that the statewide record for the wettest ever first six months is held by Caledonia (Houston County) where they reported 40.42 inches from January to June in 2013.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for July 5th: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 83 degrees F (plus or minus 7 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 65 degrees F (plus or minus 6 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for July 5th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 100 degrees F in 1982; lowest daily maximum temperature of 66 degrees F in 1905; lowest daily minimum temperature of 45 degrees F in 1972; highest daily minimum temperature of 79 degrees F in 2012, and record precipitation of 1.62 inches in 1962. No snowfall has occurred on this date.\n\nAverage dew point for July 5th is 59°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 77°F in 1949; and the minimum dew point on this date is 40 degrees F in 1972.\n\nAll-time state records for July 5th: The state record high temperature for this date is 108 degrees F at Pipestone (Pipestone County) in 1936. The state record low temperature for this date is 27 degrees F at Embarrass (St Louis County) in 2001. The state record precipitation for this date is 6.25 inches at Albert Lea (Freeborn County) in 1943. There has been no snowfall on this date.\n\nPast Weather: Slow-moving thunderstorms brought heavy rains, 4-6 inches, to many parts of southern Minnesota on July 5 of 1978. The Zumbro River flooded over its banks in Rochester causing some damage to downtown areas.\n\nThe hottest July 5th was probably in 1988 when over 20 climate stations reported an afternoon high temperature of 100°F or greater. Even overnight lows remained in the mid to upper 70s F.\n\nA cold, frosty morning greeted Minnesota campers on July 5 of 2001 when morning lows reached the freezing mark in Koochiching, St Louis, Morrison, and Beltrami Counties up north. Both Tower and Embarrass reported just 27°F, but warmed up to 70°F by mid afternoon.\n\nOutlook:\n\nGenerally cooler than normal temperatures for Saturday and early next week with daily chances for scattered showers and thunderstorms. Drier weather pattern by Wednesday as temperatures warm back up closer to normal.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nPreliminary June Climate Summary\n\nPreliminary June Climate Summary:\n\nFrom a temperature standpoint, June did not generate many anomalies in Minnesota. Average monthly temperature will be close to normal for most climate stations in the state. Extremes across the state ranged from 94°F at several locations on the 12th and again on the 24th, to just 29°F at Brimson (St Louis County on the morning of the 10th.\n\nThe real historical signature of this June climate will be the frequency and abundance of rainfall, which led to widespread flooding. Most climate stations reported rainfall on half of the days of the month, and some reported rainfall on up to 20 days. Total amounts of rainfall were well above normal for the month, and in many cases twice normal. Those geographic areas receiving the most surplus rainfall included northeastern counties, and all southern counties, especially those in south-central Minnesota. Within the statewide National Weather Service observer network over 70 new daily rainfall records were set, including 5.32 inches at Wolf Ridge (Lake County) on June 19th which was a new statewide record for the date.\n\nThe statewide average rainfall for June was over 6.25 inches, marking the 9th wettest June in state history (note this ranking may change with the addition of Friday and Saturdays rainfall). Dozens of climate stations reported their wettest June in history. Some examples:\n\nSherburn (Martin County) 12.36 inches\n\nWells (Faribault County) 13.20 inches\n\nSt James (Watonwan County) 12.61 inches\n\nWindom (Cottonwood County) 13.70 inches\n\nFaribault (Rice County) 16.63 inches\n\n(Note: these numbers are likely to get higher before June 30th)\n\nAcross south-central counties in Minnesota the average June rainfall was close to a foot, marking the wettest June in history for those counties. A vast majority of rivers and streams were running at very high levels of volume, and many were above flood stage this week. The Mississippi River at La Crosse, WI set a new stage (flow volume) record for the month of June.\n\nWettest April-June in State History:\n\nThe widespread flooding was not entirely due to June rainfall. Soils became saturated in many areas of the state due to the persistent surplus rains in April and May as well, meaning that the June rainfall amounts generated a higher than normal amount of runoff. For the 91-day period (April-June) many climate stations reported half to two-thirds of the days brought at least a trace of rainfall, and there were many days that brought over one inch. The statewide average rainfall for the three months was over 15.30 inches breaking the previous state record of 15.28 inches back in 2014. Many climate stations reported over 20 inches of rainfall for this period. Some record-setting examples:\n\nWinnebago (Faribault County) 25.56 inches\n\nSherburn (Martin County) 25.07 inches\n\nWindom (Cottonwood County) 25.41 inches\n\nBrownton (McLeod County) 23.02 inches\n\nFaribault (Rice County) 23.02 inches\n\nWaseca (Waseca County) 23.70 inches\n\nWorthington (Nobles County) 25.31 inches\n\n(Note: these numbers are likely to get higher before June 30th)\n\nProlonged drier than normal conditions would be welcome in many areas of the state as we enter the month of July.\n\nJuly 4th climatology\n\nFor the Twin Cities area rain has occurred on this holiday 77 times since 1871 (about 50 percent of the time), the highest frequency of precipitation for all major holidays of the year. The longest streak of rainy Independence Days was eight consecutive years from 1900 to 1907, with July 4th, 1900 being the wettest ever as 2.27 inches of rain fell from a thunderstorm. The holiday was rainfree for six consecutive years from 1939 to 1944 and again from 1952 to 1957. It has rained on the most recent two July 4ths (2022 and 2023)..\n\nIn terms of temperature, the average high temperature for the date is 83°F and the average low 65° F. The average dew point is 59 F, but has been as high as 79 F (in 1999). The Heat Index (derived from temperature and humidity or dew point) has been uncomfortably high on the 4th of July a number of times. There have been seven July4th holidays when the Heat Indexvalue exceeded 100 F, most recently 2012 when it hit 108 degrees F. The worst case was a Heat Index of 110 F in 1949. This was the cause of 12 heat related fatalities that year. The coldest daytime temperature on July 4th was just 58 degrees F in 1967.\n\nThe outlook for this July 4th looks like temperatures from 75 to 80°F with a chance for showers and thunderstorms and moderate southwest winds.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri:\n\nThe BBC reported this week that temperature conditions for the balance of the summer may be above normal inside the Arctic Circle as a result of the abundant wildfires going in the high latitudes, especially in Russia. More than 160 wildfires have been reported in Arctic Russia so far this summer. “Scientists are concerned that smoke from the flames will hinder the ability of the Arctic ice to reflect solar radiation - which would mean both the land and sea absorb more heat.”\n\nA recent study published in Nature Geoscience reveals that climate models underestimate the meltwater volume from the ice shelves of Antarctica. The researchers analyzed data from the Landsat 8 satellite over the period 2013 to 2021 during the Southern Hemisphere summers when meltwater occupies the surface of these ice shelves and changes the albedo (reflection) from the surface. “we found that adjusting the surface albedo in a regional climate model to account for the lower albedo of surface meltwater resulted in 2.8 times greater snowmelt across five representative ice shelves.” This may lead to significant underestimates of ice shelf melting and ice shelf stability.\n\nMPR listener question:\n\nWith all the relatively heavy rain that we’ve had in Minnesota in the last few weeks… are there models for the Mississippi River watershed that would predict or project the water levels along the Mississippi down to the Gulf of Mexico? How often are the run? And what are they predicting in the next few months?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe NOAA North-Central River Forecast Center in Chanhassen, Minnesota is one of the offices with this responsibility. They do point-specific forecasts twice daily (12 hourly) of stage or volume flow for many of the major rivers in our region, including the Mississippi River. These forecasts take advantage of the daily climate reports (rainfall) from all the relevant watersheds as well as Quantified Precipitation Forecasts out to 7 days. Some of the points along the Mississippi River for which the forecasts apply are Hastings, Red Wing, Lake City, Wabasha, and Minnesota City. They also include points further downstream as well. Beyond 7 days into the future precipitation outlook models help determine categorical flow forecasts. The outlook models for July, August, and September favor drier than normal conditions along the Mississippi River basin generally.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for June 28th:\n\nThe average MSP high temperature for this date is 82 degrees F (plus or minus 8 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 64 degrees F (plus or minus 7 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for June 28th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 102 degrees F in 1931; lowest daily maximum temperature of 64 degrees F in 1923; lowest daily minimum temperature of 47 degrees F in 1924; highest daily minimum temperature of 82 degrees F in 1931, and record precipitation of 2.33 inches in 1920. No snowfall has occurred on this date.\n\nAverage dew point for June 28th is 59°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 77°F in 1996; and the minimum dew point on this date is 33 degrees F in 1925.\n\nAll-time state records for June 28th:\n\nThe state record high temperature for this date is 107 degrees F at Browns Valley (Traverse County) in 1988. The state record low temperature for this date is 25 degrees F at Brimson (St Louis County) in 1992. The state record precipitation for this date is 6.25 inches at West Union (Todd County) in 1941. There has been no snowfall on this date.\n\nPast Weather:\n\n1931 brought the hottest June 28th in state history when 30 Minnesota counties reported afternoon high temperatures of 100°F or greater. At some locations the nighttime low temperature never dipped below 80°F.\n\nStrong thunderstorms brought 2 to 5 inches of rain to many southern and western Minnesota communities on June 28 of 1959. Such thunderstorms were common during that growing season of 1959.\n\nCampers in northern Minnesota awoke to a chilly morning on June 28 of 1983. Many areas reported temperatures in the 30s F, and there were frosts Lake, Carleton, and St Louis Counties. Daytime high temperatures along the north shore of Lake Superior remained in the 50s F..\n\nOutlook:\n\nSunny and breezy on Saturday with cooler than normal temperatures. Cool morning to start Sunday, with less wind, but with increasing cloudiness later in the day and a chance for showers. Good chance for widespread showers and thunderstorms on Monday and Tuesday with a warming trend to near normal temperatures. Chances for showers continue on Wednesday and Thursday with near normal temperatures.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nFrequent and Heavy Rains Continue in June\n\nFrequent and Heavy Rains Continue in June:This week was dominated again by widespread rainfall, and in some cases record-setting rains that produced minor to moderate flood warnings for portions of the Cottonwood River, Crow River, Minnesota River, and Mississippi River, as well as streams and creeks in northeastern Minnesota, including the Vermilion River near Crane Lake.\n\nMany observers have reported rainfall on 14-15 of the first 20 days this month. Dozens of new daily record rainfall amounts have been recorded so far this month within the state climate observation network. Many NOAA climate observers reported record-setting rainfalls on June 18-19. The heavy thunderstorms were associated with dew points in the 70s F, the highest of the year so far. Some of these rainfall amounts were close to all-time daily rainfall records for June, including:\n\nBrimson 5.18 inches\n\nTower 4.60 inches\n\nCook 5.10 inches\n\nTettegouche State Park 5.02 inches\n\nEmbarrass 4.33 inches\n\nWolf Ridge 5.32 inches\n\nOrr 3.42 inches\n\nThe 5.32 inches measured at Wolf Ridge in Lake County on June 19 will likely be a new all-time statewide record within the NOAA network for Minnesota. Other observers who are part of the State Climatology Office networks reported from 5 to 7 inches of rainfall. A more complete analysis of the thunderstorms from June 18-19 can be found at the Minnesota State Climatology Office web site.\n\nWith this week’s rainfall totals many climate stations (over 270) now report over 6 inches of rainfall for the month so far. Many climate stations have reported over 7 inches of rainfall for the month so far, and some are nearing record monthly totals. A few examples:\n\nCook (St Louis County) 7.65 inches ranks as wettest June in history\n\nBrownton (McLeod County) 10.37 inches ranks as 2nd wettest June in history\n\nEmbarrass (St Louis County) 7.84 inches ranks as 2nd wettest June in history\n\nFaribault (Rice County) 10.38 inches ranks as 4th wettest June in history\n\nForest Lake (Washington County) 8.40 inches ranks as 7th wettest June in history\n\nOverall, on a statewide basis this June ranks among the wettest 20 historically with a statewide average well over 5 inches and we still have 9 days left in the month. It will clearly be our third consecutive month with above normal rainfall for most places in the state.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri: Summer solstice June 20th brought over 15 hours of daylight to just over 16 hours of daylight to many parts of Minnesota this week. A primer on the summer solstice can be found at the BBC Weather Center for those who might want to teach their children more about it and how it varies with latitude.\n\nThe Weather Underground web site summarizes the Heat Wave affecting portions of the Midwest, Atlantic, and Northeastern states this week. It is expected to continue into the weekend. Record-setting temperatures have already occurred in Caribou, ME (98deg F), Boston, MA (98 deg. F), and Hartford, CT (97 deg. F). Peak Heat Index readings this weekend in Philadelphia are expected to range between 100 to 105 degrees F.\n\nScience Daily web site reports from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst that scientists have recently found that non-native species are expanding their ranges many orders of magnitude faster than native ones, in large part due to inadvertent human help. Many native species cannot expand their range of adaptability fast enough to keep up with climate change.\n\nMPR listener question:\n\nHere in McLeod County the rain gauge on my farm has recorded over 11 inches of rainfall so far this\n\nJune. I was wondering what is the most ever June rainfall reported for the state?\n\nAnswer: The most June rainfall for McLeod County was in 2014 when 12.29 inches fell near Brownton. That same month near Belle Plaine (Scott County) they reported a statewide June record of 17.30 inches of rainfall. June of 2014 was the only month in state history when the average statewide rainfall was over 8 inches.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for June 21st: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 81 degrees F (plus or minus 8 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 62 degrees F (plus or minus 7 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for June 21st:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 95 degrees F in 1910; lowest daily maximum temperature of 59 degrees F in 1906; lowest daily minimum temperature of 39 degrees F in 1992; highest daily minimum temperature of 74 degrees F in 1943, and record precipitation of 2.95 inches in 2002. No snowfall has occurred on this date.\n\nAverage dew point for June 21st is 56°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 75°F in 1986; and the minimum dew point on this date is 26 degrees F in 1992.\n\nAll-time state records for June 21st: The state record high temperature for this date is 107 degrees F at Browns Valley (Traverse County) in 1988. The state record low temperature for this date is 25 degrees F at Brimson (St Louis County) in 1992. The state record precipitation for this date is 6.25 inches at West Union (Todd County) in 1941. There has been no snowfall on this date.\n\nPast Weather:\n\nThe hottest June 21st in state history was in 1988, when most climate observers reported an afternoon high temperature of 90F. Observers in 22 southern and western counties reported a maximum temperature of 100 degrees F or greater. It was only 73 degrees F at Grand Marais harbor that day.\n\nJune 21st of 1992 is long remembered by many Minnesota farmers for the widespread frost and damage to corn and soybean crops. It is the only instance historically of such a widespread frost on the longest day of the year (Summer Solstice). Morning low temperatures in northern counties ranged from the mid to upper 20s F, but even southern agricultural counties saw frost, including Wabasha, Otter Tail, Sherburne, Fillmore, and Goodhue Counties. The year 1992 produced the coldest growing season of the 20th Century for Minnesota and parts of the Midwest and Canada and this was partially attributable to the eruption of Mt Pinatubo over in the Philippines in 1991.\n\nIn the late afternoon and evening of Friday, June 21 and the early morning hours of Saturday, June 22 in 2013 a powerful complex of thunderstorms marched across the southern one-half of Minnesota, producing damaging winds, hail, and flooding rains. Large hail and high winds (over 60 mph) inflicted some damage in some parts of southern and western Minnesota. Many observers reported from 2 to 5 inches of rainfall, with 5.60 inches at Morris. Several crop fields were ponded by the excess rain for a day to two.\n\nOutlook: Shower activity will continue across most of the state on Saturday, and even into Sunday up north. Sunnier skies will dominate by late Sunday and Monday. Dry weather should prevail through Wednesday of next week with temperatures slightly warmer than normal. Increasing chances for showers and thunderstorms by Thursday and Friday.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nWarm and Wet Weather Pattern to Dominate June\n\nWarm and Wet Weather Pattern to Dominate June:Warm and wet continue to be the climate trends through the first two weeks of June. Though there have been June frosts in portions of St Louis, Itasca, and Cook Counties in the north, most areas of the state are reporting average temperatures this month that range from 1°F to 3°F above normal. This week, climate observers in Redwood, Hubbard, Traverse, Chippewa, Big Stone, Lyon and Clay Counties reported afternoon high temperatures of 90°F or greater. Sabin and Marshall reported 94°F on Wednesday. There are indications from the forecast models that many locations may see more days in the 90s F next week.\n\nAnother round of thunderstorms, some severe, passed across the state on June 12th. This time there were 23 reports of strong winds, with some gusts over 60 mph, and over 80 reports of large hail, especially in central and northern counties. There were many reports of two inch diameter hail, and in Cass County even a report of 2.5 inch diameter hail. These storms were relatively fast moving and deposited between a quarter of an inch to an inch of rainfall in many places. Further, the National Weather Service in Duluth deployed a survey team to examine damages from the storms and they determined that tornadic damage occurred in portions of Carleton, Crow Wing, and Aitkin Counties.\n\nSome climate stations reported over an inch of rainfall this week. The thunderstorm rains this month, though of relatively short duration have certainly compiled some impressive rainfall totals for the first half of the month. Many climate stations are already reporting 3 to 4 inches of rainfall for the month of June and we are not yet half way through the month. A few places in Goodhue, Rice, Faribault, Todd, and Stearns Counties have reported over 5 inches of rain this month.\n\nThe Climate Prediction Center models suggest that the balance of the month will see a prevalent pattern of warmer and wetter than normal weather across Minnesota. In this context, it is justified to expect a much wetter than normal June statewide, breaking the drier than normal trend of the last three Junes. In addition, continued abundant rainfalls may make this June fall among the wettest 10 in history, where the statewide average rainfall exceeded 6 inches.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri: A recent article in the journal Science describes a new cooling textile material that can be used for better comfort and safety in urban heat islands. The material can keep the body several degrees cooler than other materials used today. This designed fabric could also be used for safer and more efficient storage and transportation of food items.\n\nThe Weather Underground reported that persistent heavy rains have flooded many parts of southern Florida since Tuesday. Many observers have reported 12 to 19 inches of rainfall, with widespread street flooding. Some airports were closed for a time, and a state of emergency was declared in some cities such as Miami, Ft Lauderdale, and Naples. Craig Edwards, former Chief Meteorologist in the Twin Cities, now living in Ft Myers, FL reported nearly a foot of rainfall so far this week. Normal June total rainfall is about 9 to 9.5 inches in that area.\n\nThere is an interesting video at the BBC Weather Center this week featuring meteorologist Carol Kirkwood sharing the stories about 75 years of broadcasting the weather on the BBC. She includes the story of Barbara Edwards the first woman meteorologist to present on the BBC back in 1974. She also describes advances in technologies used to present the weather. It is both entertaining and educational.\n\nMPR listener question: What is the average duration of rainfall from a thunderstorm over any particular spot on the landscape?\n\nAnswer: Good question. I never thought much about this one. Studies from the Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma suggest that the average duration of rainfall from a thunderstorm is from 1 to 2 hours. There is a latitude effect as well. Thunderstorms at lower latitudes, subtropical or tropical in nature tend to form into larger cells, both vertically and horizontally. Therefore, they have greater longevity before they disperse. Thunderstorm cells at higher latitudes tend to be smaller in size and move faster across the landscape, so that they tend to run their course more rapidly. Certainly, the ones over central and northern Minnesota earlier this week were relatively fast moving, bringing most of the rain in 1 or 2 hours.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for June 14th: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 79 degrees F (plus or minus 9 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 60 degrees F (plus or minus 7 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for June 14th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 98 degrees F in 1987; lowest daily maximum temperature of 60 degrees F in 19171; lowest daily minimum temperature of 44 degrees F in 1927; highest daily minimum temperature of 73 degrees F in 1893, and record precipitation of 2.48 inches in 1924. No snowfall has occurred on this date.\n\nAverage dew point for June 14th is 56°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 74°F in 1981; and the minimum dew point on this date is 33 degrees F in 1961.\n\nAll-time state records for June 14th: The state record high temperature for this date is 105 degrees F at Montevideo (Lac Qui Parle County) in 1979. The state record low temperature for this date is 22 degrees F at Isabella (Lake County) in 2000. The state record precipitation for this date is 5.46 inches at Red Wing (Goodhue County) in 2012. There has been no snowfall on this date.\n\nPast Weather: On June 14 of 1927 frost was reported in 9 northern Minnesota counties, with temperatures as low as 27°F at Littlefork. The afternoon high temperature at Two Harbors that day only reached 50°F.\n\nAn early summer Heat Wave brought record-setting daily high temperatures to much of Minnesota on June 14 of 1979. Much of the state saw afternoon highs from the upper 80s F to upper 90s F, while observers in 19 counties measured temperatures of 100°F or greater.\n\nOn the afternoon of June 14 in 1981 a tornado sped across the Twin Cities heading northeast. It was on the ground for 15 miles, causing damage near Lake Harriet, Edina, and Roseville. Many homes were damage, and also buildings around the Har-Mar Mall. At the time the tornado was rated F-3 (winds of 158-206 mph) and caused 1 death and 83 injuries.\n\nTorrential rains fell over portions of Goodhue, Rice, and Dakota Counties on June 14 of 2012. Many observers measured from 5 to 8 inches of rainfall, with 8.83 inches measured at Cannon Falls. The Little Cannon River near Cannon Falls rose twelve feet in about ten hours and set a new record crest.\n\nOutlook: Cloudy skies with moderate temperatures on Saturday and a chance for showers and thunderstorms. Partly cloudy with a warming trend on Sunday as temperatures climb to several degrees above normal and a chance for thunderstorms late in the day. Continued warm with chances for thunderstorms over much of next week with some moderation in temperature.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nA Very Wet Start to June\n\nA Very Wet Start to June:June of 2024 has begun warmer than normal, but also much wetter than normal. A number of climate stations have reported measurable rainfall on each of the first 6 days of the month, and at least 20 climate observers have reported 4 or more inches of rainfall so far. This weather pattern follows a wetter than normal April and May which was the 4th wettest in state history. As a result, many soils are saturated, and according to USDA reports over 90 percent of the soils have adequate to surplus soil moisture stored. Some farmers have had to replant crops in some cases where fields have washed out.\n\nThunderstorms brought 10 record-setting daily rainfalls to long-term climate stations in Minnesota on June 3rd. Some of these included:\n\n2.22 inches at Artichoke Lake (Big Stone County)\n\n2.88 inches to Theilman (Wabasha County)\n\n2.57 inches to Delano (Wright County)\n\n1.80 inches to Brainerd (Crow Wing County)\n\nWith all the surplus rainfall over the past two months, the Drought Monitor shows that only 2 percent of the Minnesota landscape is drier than normal. The excessive rainfall has also caused the National Weather Service to issue flood warnings this week (for minor flooding) along portions of the Crow Wing River, the Minnesota River, and the Red River.\n\nOutlooks through the third week of June continue to favor warmer than normal temperatures with above normal rainfall. So June may be the 3rd consecutive wetter than normal month for the state.\n\nChange in broadcast time on MPR: For those listeners to Minnesota Public Radio’s Morning Edition program on Fridays, there is a change in the broadcast time for my weekly chats with host Cathy Wurzer. Formerly our chats were broadcast live each Friday, from 6:54am to 6:59 am. But, starting on Friday, June 7th, our weekly weather/climate chats will be broadcast at 6:47am. I hope listener will adjust to this time change. Should you miss the live broadcast, you can often find the audio recording at the MPR Morning Edition web site.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri: According to the United Kingdom Meteorological Office, the United Kingdom recorded its warmest ever month of May. The largest positive temperature departures were in northern sections, especially Scotland. The overall warmth was especially influenced by higher than normal nighttime temperatures. It was also the warmest meteorological spring (March-May) in history.\n\nThe Weather Underground features an article this week describing the use of ice immersion therapy to treat heatstroke victims in the Phoenix, AZ area, which is part of the dessert southwest that has been under an Excessive Heat Warning by the National Weather Service this week. Many communities have reported daily high temperatures from 106°F to 115°F. This therapy has great promise for treating victims of heat.\n\nA recent article from the AGU describes research that shows climate change will provoke more air quality alerts due to ground level ozone pollution. One of their findings is that “climate change is projected to increase the magnitude and frequency of high O3 concentrations across much of the country, increasing average 1-year O3 by close to 2 ppb at mid-century and end of century relative to the historical simulation.”\n\nMPR listener question: We are wondering how often in the Twin Cities we have started the month of June with five consecutive days of rainfall? Is this quite rare?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn 154 years of climate record keeping this has happened just 15 times including this year. The last time was in 2010. Of the 14 previous occasions of June starting with 5 consecutive rainy days, 9 of those ended up with above normal rainfall for the month.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for June 7th: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 77 degrees F (plus or minus 9 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 58 degrees F (plus or minus 8 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for June 7th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 103 degrees F in 2011; lowest daily maximum temperature of 55 degrees F in 1901; lowest daily minimum temperature of 35 degrees F in 1998; highest daily minimum temperature of 78 degrees F in 2011, and record precipitation of 2.91 inches in 1984. No snowfall has occurred on this date.\n\nAverage dew point for June 7th is 54°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 72°F in 1914; and the minimum dew point on this date is 30 degrees F in 1938.\n\nAll-time state records for June 7th: The state record high temperature for this date is 106 degrees F at Pipestone (Pipestone County) in 1933. The state record low temperature for this date is 19 degrees F at Pokegama Dam (Itasca County) in 1889. The state record precipitation for this date is 4.92 inches at Maple Plain (Hennepin County) in 1888. The state snowfall record is 4.6 inches at Virginia (St Louis County) in 1946.\n\nPast Weather: Many Minnesota residents awoke to a frosty morning on June 7 of 1897. Frost occurred as far south as Dakota and Goodhue Counties. Northern areas of the state reported morning low temperatures in the mid to upper 20s F. Frost damage was reported on many crops. The daily high temperature only reached 50°F at Milaca.\n\nStrong thunderstorms brought 2 to 4 inches of rainfall to many parts of the state on June 7 of 1941. Crookston (Polk County) reported nearly 5 inches of rain, which flood out some fields of emerged crops. Many areas of the state reported 7-8 inches of rainfall that June.\n\nScorching heat prevailed across Minnesota on the afternoon of June 7 in 2011. Over 30 climate stations reported a temperature of 100°F or greater, Most other areas of the state saw temperatures in the 90s F, but the afternoon high at Beaver Bay only reached 59°F due to the cooling powers of Lake Superior.\n\nOutlook: A slight chance for showers early on Saturday, then sunny and breezy through the weekend with near seasonal temperatures. Near seasonal temperatures will continue through Tuesday, with small chances for showers late Monday and into Tuesday. A significant warming trend will begin on Wednesday and continue towards the end of next week, bringing above normal temperatures to Minnesota.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nPreliminary Climate Summary for May\n\nPreliminary Climate Summary for May:\n\nMost observers reported an average monthly temperature that was 1°F to 3°F above normal. There were a few northern Minnesota communities that reported slightly cooler than normal average temperature for May. Extremes ranged from 92°F at Granite Falls on the 17th and at Marshall on the 18th to just 22°F at White Rock Dam in Traverse County on May 5th.\n\nMay brought above normal rainfall to most areas of the state. In fact many observers reported twice the normal rainfall for the month, and over 190 climate stations reported over 6 inches of rain for the month. A dozen climate stations reported over 8 inches of rain for the month. Thunderstorms brought record-setting daily rainfall amounts over May 21-22 to 54 climate stations during the month. Some of these included:\n\n3.78 inches at Milan on the 21st\n\n2.85 inches at Wolf Ridge ELC on the 22nd\n\n2.73 inches at Red Wing Dam on the 22nd\n\n2.71 inches at Rosemount on the 22nd\n\n2.33 inches at MSP on the 21st\n\n2.26 inches at Artichoke Lake on the 21st\n\nOverall, the state average rainfall for May was well over 5 inches (about 5.37 inches), making this the 7th wettest May in history on a statewide basis. When combined with the wet month of April this year the April-May two month total of nearly 8.9 inches as a statewide average marks the 4th wettest in history back to 1895. As a result of this two-month wet period there4 is only 2 percent of the Minnesota landscape left in Moderate Drought according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nIt continued to be a windy spring season in May with most climate stations reporting wind gusts of 30 mph or greater on a third to a half of all days in May. Some days brought wind gusts as high as 50 mph.\n\nChange in broadcast time on MPR:\n\nFor those listeners to Minnesota Public Radio’s Morning Edition program on Fridays, there is going to be a broadcast time change for my weekly chats with host Cathy Wurzer. Formerly our chats were broadcast live each Friday, from 6:54am to 6:59 am. But, starting on Friday, June 7th, our weekly weather/climate chats will be broadcast at 6:47am. I hope listener will adjust to this time change. Should you miss the live broadcast, you can often find the audio recording at the MPR Morning Edition web site.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri:\n\nThere is an excellent article by Dr. Heidi Roop, Executive Director of the Minnesota Climate Adaptation Partnership, in the Star Tribune newspaper dated the 30th of May. She describes the new online tool called MN CliMAT which can be used to assess climate conditions and risk associated with continued climate change in Minnesota. It provides enough detail to examine changing climate characteristics down to a 2.5 mile scale.\n\nThe Weather Underground reported on the severe storms in Texas this week that knocked out power to over 1 million residential customers, many living in areas that saw afternoon temperatures reach the 90s F. Overall Texas has endured a warm month of May with some areas see multiple 100°F days, and afternoon highs from 110°F to 115°F in 5 counties.\n\nSpeaking of heat, the BBC reported on the Heat Wave this week in India were 37 cities reported record-setting high temperatures ranging from 113°F to 126°F. Medical facilities were burdened with heavy patient loads, most suffering from heat-related symptoms such as dehydration.\n\nMPR listener question:\n\nAfter this very wet month, we were wondering when was the wettest month of May in Minnesota and what were some of the amounts?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe year 1938 brought the wettest month of May, and it is the only time that the statewide average rainfall exceeded 6 inches (6.03 inches to be exact). Some of the higher and record-setting rainfall amounts that month included over 10 inches at Red Wing and Gull Lake, over 9 inches at Hastings and Red Wing, and over 8 inches at a number of other climate stations. Both 1938 and 1939 brought enough surplus precipitation to help the state start recovering from the terrible droughts of the early and mid 1930s.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for May 31st:\n\nThe average MSP high temperature for this date is 74 degrees F (plus or minus 9 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 55 degrees F (plus or minus 8 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for May 31st:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 106 degrees F in 1934; lowest daily maximum temperature of 55 degrees F in 1962; lowest daily minimum temperature of 33 degrees F in 1889; highest daily minimum temperature of 75 degrees F in 1934, and record precipitation of 2.39 inches in 1965. No snowfall has occurred on this date.\n\nAverage dew point for May 31st is 50°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 73°F in 1991; and the minimum dew point on this date is 27 degrees F in 2009.\n\nAll-time state records for May 31st:\n\nThe state record high temperature for this date is 112 degrees F at Maple Plain (Hennepin County) in 1934. The state record low temperature for this date is 19 degrees F at Pokegama Dam (Itasca County) in 1889. The state record precipitation for this date is 4.92 inches at Maple Plain (Hennepin County) in 1888. The state snowfall record is 4.6 inches at Virginia (St Louis County) in 1946.\n\nPast Weather:\n\nWidespread hard freezes and frosts were reported around the state on the morning of May 31 in 1897. Temperatures in the 20s F were widespread, with readings as low as 23°F in Wabasha County. Emerged crops were damaged and had to be replanted.\n\nScorching heat prevailed on May 31 of 1934 as 55 counties reported temperatures of 100°F or greater, the all-time hottest day in the month of May. Even the nighttime sleeping temperatures were hot as Redwood Falls, Montevideo and Milan never saw the temperature drop below 80°F overnight.\n\nOn May 31, 1946 the Cloquet Forestry Station reported snow flurries with temperatures in the 30s F. Many northeastern Minnesota climate stations reported from 1 to 4 inches of snowfall, with 4.6 inches at Virginia.\n\nOutlook:\n\nMostly sunny to start the weekend, then increasing cloudiness on Sunday with chances for showers and thunderstorms. Chances for rain continue into early Monday, with warmer temperatures. Mostly dry on Tuesday but increasing clouds later in the day with a chance for showers and thunderstorms. Temperatures will track close to normal next week, with daily changes for showers and thunderstorms through Thursday.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nMay Wetness Continues\n\nMay Wetness Continues:\n\nWidespread strong thunderstorms brought significant rains to much of the state this week on May 20 and 21, especially southern and northeastern Minnesota counties. Many climate observers reported from 1.25 inches to 2.50 inches from these storms, and a few places reported over 3 inches. With these storms, there were two tornadoes reported (near Fairmont and Winona), 34 reports of damaging winds (over 60 mph), and thankfully no large hail reports. Several long-term climate stations reported record-setting daily amounts of rain, including:\n\nDuluth 1.42 inches\n\nBrainerd 1.71 inches\n\nHibbing 1.76 inches\n\nTower 2.20 inches\n\nTwo Harbors 2.12 inches\n\nMilan 3.78 inches\n\nArtichoke Lake 2.26 inches\n\nRed Wing 2.32 inches\n\nHastings 2.12 inches\n\nZumbrota 1.86 inches\n\nFurther details on the storms of May 20 and 21 may be found on the Minnesota State Climatology Office web site.\n\nAverage total rainfall for the month across the state is about 4 inches already but varies widely. For example, for example in northwestern Minnesota counties (Red River Valley area) the average rainfall for the month is 2.90 inches, but in south-central Minnesota it is over 5.50 inches. Forecasts for the balance of the month suggest that we will see at least 3 or 4 more rainy days, which could push our statewide average rainfall for May to close to 5 inches. There have been only 12 years in history where May has brought a statewide average rainfall of 5 inches or greater (1896, 1902, 1905, 1908, 1938, 1944, 1959, 1962, 2004, 2012, 2015, and 2022). So, this May could end up being exceptionally wet with respect to our long-term climate history.\n\nThe above normal rainfall this month has certainly replenished stored soil moisture values around the state. According to USDA Crop Condition reports earlier this week both topsoil and subsoil moisture conditions around the state are rated to be 85 percent to 95 percent adequate or surplus, a level not seen since 2019. At the University of Minnesota Southwestern Research and Outreach Center in Lamberton (Redwood County), store soil moisture in the top 5 feet is estimated to be close to 9 inches.\n\nDrought has all but vanished from the Minnesota landscape with less than 9 percent of the state designated to be in Moderate Drought, primarily as a carry-over from last year. According to the NOAA Climate Prediction Center a wetter than normal weather pattern is expected to prevail across Minnesota through the first full week of June.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri: Thanks to transition to a La Nina episode expected to happen in the equatorial Pacific Ocean this summer, as well as warmer than normal sea surface temperature in the Atlantic Ocean, NOAA scientists are expecting a busy Atlantic Hurricane Season this year. NOAA says that “, 8 to 13 tropical storms are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 4 to 7 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher). Forecasters have a 70% confidence in these ranges.”\n\nThe Weather Underground features a detailed story about the tornado that devastated Greenfield, IA this week, leaving 5 dead and 35 injured. It was upgraded to an EF04 storm (winds 175-185 mph) after a survey by National Weather Service personnel. One photo shows nothing but debris left from a building, except for the ATM machine.\n\nThis week’s AGU EOS Bulletin features an article about the escalating economic impacts of climate change. This study was published in the journal Nature. Researchers assessed the economic impacts of various climate extremes and found that worldwide income may fall as much as 19 percent by 2049, with wide geographic disparities in impacts.\n\nMPR listener question: With the multi-year drought all but over in Minnesota due to this wet spring, I wondered how often has drought persisted for more than two growing seasons in a row across parts of Minnesota, and with the changing climate oscillating between excessively wet and excessively dry are long, multi-year spells of drought likely to become very exceptional?\n\nAnswer: Good question. From the study of drought persistence in Minnesota, it appears that the longest sequences of year-by-year drought occurred during these periods:\n\n1921-1923\n\n1929-1934\n\n1936-1939\n\n1987-1989\n\n2020-2023\n\nWide swings in precipitation patters from excessively dry to excessively wet have allowed for relatively rapid drought recovery in the past. This was the case with the 1910, 1976, 2003, 2006, and 2012 drought years which were followed by wetter than normal years and rapid recovery. The droughts of the early 1920s, the 1930s, and the late 1980s, have taken multiple years to recover from (in terms of soil moisture recharge, lake levels and volume flows in our rivers). Our most recent drought which began in 2020 has persisted in parts of the state for four years, but this exceptionally wet spring has certainly all be alleviated it. This pattern of wide swings in moisture conditions may be indicative of our climate future.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for May 24th: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 72 degrees F (plus or minus 9 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 53 degrees F (plus or minus 7 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for May 24th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 95 degrees F in 2010; lowest daily maximum temperature of 49 degrees F in 1893; lowest daily minimum temperature of 32 degrees F in 1925; highest daily minimum temperature of 72 degrees F in 2010, and record precipitation of 1.27 inches in 1937. There was a record snowfall of 0.1 inches in 1925.\n\nAverage dew point for May 24th is 48°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 71°F in 1989; and the minimum dew point on this date is 20 degrees F in 1934.\n\nAll-time state records for May 24th: The state record high temperature for this date is 98 degrees F at Beardsley (Big Stone\n\nCounty) in 1928. The state record low temperature for this date is 18 degrees F at Mora (Kanabec County) in 1988. The state record precipitation for this date is 4.91 inches at St Francis (Anoka County) in 2012. The state snowfall record is 1.7 inches at Northfield (Dakota County) in 1893.\n\nPast Weather: Frosts were common across much of central and northern Minnesota on the morning of May 24 in 1917. Frosts were reported as far south as Windom and Rochester, with morning lows in the 20s F across many northern counties. Newly emerged crops suffered from frost damage in some areas.\n\nStrong thunderstorms brought heavy rains to western and central Minnesota on May 24 of 1939. Many observers reported 2 to 4 inches of rain. In portions of Todd County township roads were washed out by flash flooding.\n\nMay 24 of 2010 was arguably the warmest in state history. Over 40 climate stations reported afternoon high temperatures of 90°F or greater. Overnight low temperatures remained in the 70s F in many places.\n\nOutlook:\n\nMemorial weekend will start out sunny and dry in most places, then increasing clouds by Saturday night with chance for showers and thunderstorms on Sunday. Continued chance for showers on Monday, but then mostly dry and sunny for Tuesday and Wednesday. A chance for showers returns by Thursday.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nMay Climate Update\n\nMay Climate Update:Minnesota farmers took advantage of the recent preponderance of dry days and rapidly advanced their planting progress. Over two-thirds of the state corn crop and over a third of the state soybean crops have been planted. Soil moisture recharge has been very good this spring around most of the state, with over 80 percent of the state reporting adequate to surplus stored soil moisture conditions (according to USDA Crop Condition reports). Rains this week of over half an inch were beneficial to parts of western and southern Minnesota fields. Over an inch and a half of rain fell in portions of Clay, Nobles, and Houston Counties. Dew points also hit seasonal high points this week reaching the mid to upper 50s F prior to the rains on May 15th. With near seasonal or above normal temperatures prevailing, crops are readily germinating and emerging in only a few days.\n\nMother’s Day (last Sunday brought the warmest temperatures since April 13th when it was 90°F at Granite Falls and in the 80s F at many other places. Many areas of the state reported afternoon highs in the 80s F for Mother’s Day, with 88°F at MSP. Temperatures for the balance of the month are expected to run a bit cooler than normal, but no expected frosts are in the forecasts. Also, rainfall may be more frequent for the balance of the month. This will perhaps produce above normal rainfall for the second month in a row.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri:\n\nEarlier this week I had the privilege of handing out the 10th Annual Climate Adaptation Leadership Awards from the Minnesota Climate Adaptation Partnership Program. It was an absolute honor for me to recognize these outstanding leaders for their efforts to make Minnesotans more resilient to climate change. In the five award categories the winters were:\n\nClimate Justice Leadership-the Community Action Center of Northfield, MN\n\nCollaborative Climate Adaptation-Truterra and the MN Dept of Agriculture Climate Smart Farms Program\n\nIndividual Climate Adaptation Leadership- Syd Bauer of Morris, MN\n\nOrganizational Climate Adaptation Leadershp-Frogtown Green in St Paul\n\nCreative Climate Communications Leadership-Ben Weaver\n\nMore details about the accomplishments of these award winters can be found at the MCAP web site.\n\nThis week’s AGU-EOS Bulletin features an article out a pilot study in New York that used a set of low-cost flood sensors to collect data on flood events at a local scale. This detailed data proved to be of great value to various stakeholders, including city agencies, community members, and researchers. Perhaps these sensors will be deployed in other urban environments that are prone to periodic flash flooding.\n\nThe BBC reported this week on a comprehensive tree ring study that showed last summer was the warmest in 2000 years for the Northern Hemisphere, following a upward trend evident in recent decades. This new study suggests this means that the world may have actually warmed around a quarter of a degree more than typically reported.\n\nMPR listener question: We have heard you talk in the past about comfortable weather conditions and how infrequent they are. From the standpoint of average temperature and humidity when are the most comfortable times of the year in Minnesota?\n\nAnswer:\n\nNot sure that I can objectively answer this question. But if we accept that 70°F is generally comfortable for outside activity, and that 50° is generally a comfortable nighttime low, the long-term averages for the Twin Cities suggest that May 15-19 are ideal, and that September 22-26 are equally ideal as average maximum and minimum temperatures correspond to these values. I might further add that average dew points are in the mid-40s F as well which adds to the comfort. Of course, in Minnesota there is such wide variation around the daily averages, that the actual average value hardly ever occurs. Such is the case for today (May 17) where the average maximum temperature is 70°F and the average minimum temperature is 50°F. In the past 150 years of Twin Cities climate records, these values have only been measure on May 17th just 7 times, so less than 5 percent of the time has average actually occurred.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for May 17th: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 70 degrees F (plus or minus 10 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 50 degrees F (plus or minus 8 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for May 17th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 93 degrees F in 1987; lowest daily maximum temperature of 46 degrees F in 1890; lowest daily minimum temperature of 31 degrees F in 1915; highest daily minimum temperature of 69 degrees F in 1911, and record precipitation of 2.47 inches in 2020. There was a trace of snow in 1890.\n\nAverage dew point for May 17th is 45°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 69°F in 1996; and the minimum dew point on this date is 17 degrees F in 2009.\n\nAll-time state records for May 17th: The state record high temperature for this date is 100 degrees F at New Ulm (Brown\n\nCounty) in 1934. The state record low temperature for this date is 14 degrees F at St Vincent (Kittson County) in 1888. The state record precipitation for this date is 4.43 inches at Blue Earth (Faribault County) in 2000. The state snowfall record is 12.0 inches at Saint Cloud (Stearns County) in 1890.\n\nPast Weather: Measurable snowfalls occurred on May 17 of 1890 across many central and northern Minnesota communities as temperatures hovered in the 30s and 40s F. Traces of snow were recorded in the Twin Cities. Thirty-six hours later, it was sunny and temperatures rebounded to the 60s F.\n\nThe hottest May 17 was in 1934 when over 40 climate stations reported maximum temperatures of 90°F or greater. In Chaska, after a morning low of 45°F the afternoon high warmed to 96°F.\n\nVery cold temperatures prevailed over central and northern Minnesota on May 17 of 1983. Many areas reported morning low temperatures in the 20s F. Afternoon high temperatures were only in the 40s F along the north shore of Lake Superior.\n\nOutlook:\n\nWarm, sunny, and breezy in the south over the weekend, with increasing clouds on Sunday and a chance for showers into Monday. Up north there will be scattered showers and thunderstorms over the weekend with breezy conditions. A good chance for showers on Monday and Tuesday, with perhaps some thunderstorms, then consistent, but smaller chances for showers the remainder of next week, with temperatures trending a bit cooler than normal from the prevalent cloudiness.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nMay Starts Wet\n\nMay Starts Wet: Most climate stations have reported numerous days with rain already this month. Well over 100 observers have reported over 2 inches so far this month, while observers in 8 counties (mainly SE MN) have reported over 3 inches. Rainfall totals in portions of Freeborn and Wabasha Counties already are close to the average values for the month of May (over 4 inches). Daily rainfalls of an inch or more fell in some places over the first dew days of the month, as well as on May 7th. Some long-term climate stations even reported daily record rainfalls, such as Hallock in Kittson County (still in the grip of Severe Drought) where they reported 1.02 inches of rain on May 3rd. Thanks to widespread significant rains in late April and early May, the area of Minnesota designated to be in Moderate to Extreme Drought has shrunk to just 11 percent, down over 30 percent from earlier in the spring..\n\nTemperatures so far this month are moderate, averaging about 1°F to 2°F above normal around the state. So far, a number of climate stations have reported 70°F days, but just one reading of 80°F or higher this month, coming from Theilman in Wabasha County where they reported 83°F on May 8th. Conversely, there have been morning frosts reported from 8 northern Minnesota counties.\n\nWinds continue to be stronger than normal, but not as extreme as April was. Many days have brought wind gusts over 30 mph, and on May 6th a number of locations reported wind gusts of 40 mph or greater, including:\n\n48 mph at Morris\n\n46 mph at Worthington\n\n45 mph at Detroit Lakes\n\n44 mph at Montevideo, Tracy, and Ortonville\n\n43 mph at Brainerd\n\nThe forecasts continue to favor some windy conditions through mid-month with warmer than normal temperatures and more frequent chances for showers.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri:\n\nOn the Weather Underground web site this week, Jonathan Erdman posted an interesting article about the strongest tornadoes that have occurred in the southern and southeastern states this spring. He points out that one of the EF-4 tornadoes was on the ground for 27 miles. He also mentions that Minnesota has reported 27 EF-4 or stronger tornadoes since 1950 compared with 66 in Oklahoma.\n\nThe BBC Weather Center reported on the devastating rains that flooded many portions of Rio uGrande Do Sul in Brazil last weekend. Some observers reported 12 inches to 19 inches of rainfall leading up to the flooding which hit the city of Porto Alegre and displaced thousands of residents, as well as closing the airport. Yet more rainfall was expected this week.\n\nMPR listener question: We have heard you and Cathy Wurzer talk about the strong winds this spring, with over 50 mph wind gusts. It made us wonder about what is the strongest non-tornadic, straight-line wind ever measured in Minnesota?\n\nAnswer: The official data for wind come from historical anemometer measurements. For Minnesota, the fastest measured straight-line wind gust occurred early in the morning (3am) on September 1 of 2011 at Donaldson in Kittson County (northern Red River Valley) as a squall line associated with a massive thunderstorm complex moved across the countryside. The wind gust was 121 mph. There was widespread damage across the rural landscape to houses, barns, and grain bins, but no loss of life.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for May 10th: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 67 degrees F (plus or minus 10 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 48 degrees F (plus or minus 8 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for May 10th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 90 degrees F in 1987; lowest daily maximum temperature of 43 degrees F in 1902; lowest daily minimum temperature of 28 degrees F in 1907; highest daily minimum temperature of 68 degrees F in 1922, and record precipitation of 1.40 inches in 1986. There was a trace of snow in 1966.\n\nAverage dew point for May 10th is 40°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 70°F in 2011; and the minimum dew point on this date is 14 degrees F in 1981.\n\nAll-time state records for May 10th: The state record high temperature for this date is 97 degrees F at Beardsley (Big Stone County) in 1928. The state record low temperature for this date is 11 degrees F at Pine River Dam (Crow Wing County) in 1905 and at Roseau (Roseau County) in 1981. The state record precipitation for this date is 4.27 inches at Wheaton (Traverse County) in 1920. The state snowfall record is 6.0 inches at Pigeon River (Cook County) in 1927.\n\nPast Weather: May 10 of 1902 saw a fast-moving snowstorm drop several inches of snow across the northern third of the state. In the Duluth area over 5 inches fell, while in Collegeville (Stearns County) they reported 3 inches. The snow was short-lived as the next day temperatures warmed into the upper 40s and low 50s F.\n\nOn May 10 of 1979 just as farmers were gearing up to plant corn and soybeans, a series of thunderstorms dropped 1.5 to 3.0 inches of rainfall across southwestern and central Minnesota agricultural counties. These storms brought a halt to field work and farmers had to wait nearly another week to resume planting.\n\nA very cold morning prevailed across Minnesota on May 10 of 1981. Everywhere in the state reported frost, except for Winona where they had a temperature of 34°F. Many northern Minnesota communities reported temperatures in the teens It was as cold as 24°F at Lamberton and Pipestone.\n\nMay 10 of 1987 brought mid-summer heat to Minnesota. Climate observers in 45 counties reported afternoon high temperatures of 90°F or greater. Despite starting the morning at 42°F, Crookston warmed to 92°F by mid afternoon.\n\nOutlook:\n\nGenerally sunny and warm on Saturday, with increasing clouds by evening in the north and a chance for showers. Increasing clouds statewide on Sunday, with a chance for showers by evening. Continued warmer than normal next week and breezy, but with chances for showers and thunderstorms, especially mid-week.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nClimate Summary for April\n\nClimate Summary for April:\n\nThe month of April was modestly warmer than normal and much wetter than normal. Temperature-wise, most climate stations reported an average monthly temperature that was 2°F to 4°F above normal and April was the 9th consecutive month with above normal monthly temperatures across the state. Extremes for the month ranged from 90°F at Granite Falls (Yellow Medicine County) on the 13th to just 5°F at Baudette (Lake of the Woods County) and Tower (St Louis County) on April 1st. Minnesota reported the coldest temperature in the 48 contiguous states just twice during the month.\n\nPrecipitation (almost entirely rainfall) was above normal at nearly all locations in the state, with about a third of the days bringing measurable rainfall. A large area of the state reported 3 to 5 inches of rainfall during the month, in many cases twice the normal amount. Parts of Stearns, Lac Qui Parle, Kandiyohi, and Wright Counties reported over 6 inches. Within the statewide climate observation network there were 78 record daily rainfalls reported during the month. Some of these included:\n\n2.64 inches at Zumbrota on the 12th\n\n2/23 inches at Redwood Falls on the 16th\n\n2.04 inches at Litchfield on the 17th\n\n2/02 inches at St Peter on the 17th\n\nSnowfall was nonexistent to scarce, with some observers reporting from 1 to 3 inches.\n\nThe surplus rainfall in April helped to shrink the area of drought across the state during April. About 35 percent of the state landscape remains in Moderate to Severe Drought, concentrated in the north-central and northwestern sections of the state.\n\nWind was a major characteristic of the April climate again this year. Many climate stations reported wind gusts of 30 mph or greater on over half of the days, with peak gusts over 50 mph in many locations. The number of days with wind gusts of 30 mph or greater, a sampling:\n\nMSP 27 days\n\nRochester 25 days\n\nMankato 23 days\n\nDuluth, Brainerd, and Redwood Falls 20 days\n\nSaint Cloud and Windom 19 days\n\nThe last three Aprils have arguably been the windiest in history.\n\nMay has started wet this week, with many climate stations already reporting 1-2 inches of rainfall. In fact, more frequent rainfalls are expected over the first half of May.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri:\n\nThe Weather Underground web site reported extensively on the 130 tornadoes that occurred last week, mostly in the central and southern plains states. A number of EF-3 tornadoes (136-165 mph wind gusts) caused extensive damage, especially in Nebraska and Oklahoma.\n\nA recent study published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics presents evidence that suggest EPA estimates of methane emissions from landfills and other sources is significantly too low. The scientists used satellite data and atmospheric models to track measured methane emissions and found their values to be much higher. This is concerning, as methane is an extremely powerful greenhouse gas.\n\nMPR listener question:\n\nWe received over 6.5 inches of rainfall during April here just outside Madison in Lac Qui Parle County, along the headwaters of the Minnesota River. We wondered if that was a record amount for April, thought you could tell us?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIndeed, you had a very wet April, close to three times normal rainfall. In your Lac Qui Parle County climate history, only two Aprils were wetter than this one, 2001 (6.75”) and 1896 (7.33”. The wet month should be good for your county corn and soybean farmers yields in 2024.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for May 3rd:\n\nThe average MSP high temperature for this date is 64 degrees F (plus or minus 12 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 45 degrees F (plus or minus 9 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for May 3rd:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 93 degrees F in 1949; lowest daily maximum temperature of 35 degrees F in 1954; lowest daily minimum temperature of 18 degrees F in 1967; highest daily minimum temperature of 65 degrees F in 1959, and record precipitation of 1.72 inches in 1912. There was a record 0.5 inches of snowfall in 2013.\n\nAverage dew point for May 3rd is 39°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 66°F in 1949; and the minimum dew point on this date is 12 degrees F in 2005.\n\nAll-time state records for May 3rd:\n\nThe state record high temperature for this date is 97 degrees F at Bird Island (Renville County) in 1949. The state record low temperature for this date is 6 degrees F at Crookston (Polk County) in 1967. The state record precipitation for this date is 4.00 inches at Albert Lea (Freeborn County) in 1902. The state snowfall record is 12.0 inches at Leonard (Clearwater County) in 1954.\n\nPast Weather:\n\nRecord-setting high temperatures prevailed across much of Minnesota on May 3 of 1949. Most areas of the state reported temperatures of 80°F or higher, with over 50 climate stations reporting 90°F or greater. Redwood Falls reported a record warm low temperature as well of 72°F.\n\nOver May 2-3 of 1954 a late season winter-like storm brought a mixture of rain, sleet, and snow to Minnesota. Many climate observers reported from 3 to 9 inches of snowfall, and in portions of Koochiching, St Louis, and Clearwater Counties a foot of new snow was reported.\n\nThere were widespread frost/freezing warning issued for May 3 of 1967. Most areas of the state reported morning lows in the teens and twenties. Observers in four counties reported morning low temperatures in the single digits, while Hallock (Kittson County) in the Red River Valley reported an afternoon high temperature of only 25°F.\n\nOutlook:\n\nA bit warmer than normal on Saturday with a chance for rain showers mostly in the first half of the day. Sunny and warmer on Sunday. Monday through Thursday of next week will be warmer than normal but with daily chances for showers and thunderstorms. Drier and cooler towards the end of next week.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nBrief April Update\n\nBrief April Update:With cooler than normal temperatures earlier this week, some areas of the state reported measurable snowfalls, the first time this month. Portions of Beltrami, Koochiching, Kittson, Becker, and Itasca Counties reported 1-2 inches of snowfall. It was short-lived as temperatures warmed up towards the end of the week.\n\nMore moisture is expected over the weekend and next week to close out the month of April, so I will not provide a climate summary for the month until next Friday. It appears that the month will be wetter than normal for most areas of the state, helping to alleviate the drought situation, which should continue to improve. Of further note it looks like the first two weeks of May will be warmer and wetter than normal over much of the state. Good news for farmers who got their fields planted this week.\n\nWinds have continued to be strong this month, with a remarkable number of days bringing wind gusts of 30 mph or greater. The Twin Cities have seen 22 such days so far this month.\n\nA Look Back at Unexpected Extremes of Weather and Climate in Minnesota since 1978: Recently I participated along with MCAP Director Dr. Heidi Roop in a Virtual Update on Climate Change Evidence in Minnesota and our response to it. This was hosted by Congresswoman Betty McCollum, If you are interested in viewing this conversation you can find it online at youtube.\n\nAmong topics discussed, I was asked to remark on the most remarkable climate observations that I have witnessed in my nearly 50 years of work in meteorology and climatology. I shared a small number of these observations but would like to offer an expanded list here. This list includes both weather observations and climate episodes that I never thought I would witness in Minnesota:\n\n- Two flash floods in Rochester in 1978 provoked by 6 inches thunderstorm rainfall (Jul, Sep)\n\n- A 100°F reading at Ada, MN on April 21, 1980, along with zero precipitation for the month\n\n- 10 inches of rain in six hours in the Twin Cities on July 23, 1987\n\n- 44 days of 90 F temperatures or greater in the summer of 1988 for the Twin Cities\n\n- coldest summer of the 20th Century in 1992, due to Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991\n\n- frost on the summer solstice in 1992\n\n- -60°F at Tower on February 2, 1996\n\n- Itasca State Park devastated by a derecho in July of 1995\n\n- 14 declared blizzard in the snow season of 1996-1997\n\n- 16 mi wide Red River near East Grand Forks in April of 1997 due to spring snowmelt flooding\n\n- BWCA devastated by derecho in July of 1999\n\n- 15.10 inches of rain in 24 hr at Hokah, MN on August 19, 2007\n\n- 48 tornadoes in one day across Minnesota on June 17, 2010 (113 for the year)\n\n- low pressure of 28.21 inches at Bigfork on October 26, 2010, 27 ft waves on Lake Superior\n\n- an 84°F dewpoint and Heat Index of 130°F at Moorhead on July 19, 2011\n\n- 121 mph straight line wind at Donaldson, MN, September 1, 2011\n\n- simultaneous declarations of drought and flood disasters in 12 MN counties in summer of 2012\n\n- 55.6 inches of snow at Island Lake near Duluth for April of 2013\n\n- 17.2 inches of snow at Dodge Center, May 1-2, 2013\n\n- simultaneous tornado and blizzard warmings for SW MN on March 31, 2014\n\n- 60.21 inches of precipitation at Harmony for the year 2018\n\n- statewide average precipitation over 35 inches in 2019 (wettest year ever)\n\n- over 25 Air Quality Alerts for Minnesota in 2023\n\n- over a billion dollars in damages from hail on August 11, 2023\n\n- Heat Index Values of 120°F to 122°F in the Twin Cities area on August 22, 2023\n\n- the warmest and wettest December in state history in 2023\n\n- mildest winter in state history in 2023-2024\n\nRest assured that there were more surprises than listed here, but there is not room enough for all of them in this short blog. Perhaps you too recall some total weather and climate surprises in your own Minnesota experience. With climate change we will undoubtedly continue to be surprised by our weather and climate extremes.\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri: In this week’s AGU-EOS Bulletin there is an article about scientists collaborating to study the implications of climate change and warming of deep soil temperatures, which have huge impact on the microorganisms that inhabit the soil environment. This article reminds me that Dr. John Baker and Dr. Donald Baker of the University of Minnesota Department of Soil, Water, and Climate were some of the first researchers to publish a study of long-term ground heat flux and heat storage back in 2002 in the journal Climatic Change.\n\nEarlier this week the BBC reported that the southeastern China province of Guangdong was inundated with 100-year rainfalls that swelled rivers to all-time flood crests. Over 1 million residents lost power, and approximately 110,000 had to be evacuated from threatened homes.\n\nA recent article from researchers at Imperial College in London reveals that for large corporations the simple goal of reducing emissions of GHG to help meet the Paris Agreement is an insufficient effort. More corporate attention to innovation and market regulation strategies would enhance efforts to meet the Paris Agreement. The article can be found in Science.\n\nMPR listener question: We are long-time listeners to MPR and know that you have spoken about the windy month of April each of the last three years by mentioning the number of days with wind gusts of 30 mph or greater, usually for the Twin Cities. Can you give us some context? What are the average number of days with gust of 30 mph or greater in April.\n\nAnswer: Good question. For the first 20 years of this century, the average number of days in April with wind gusts of 30 mph or greater has been 12 days. More recently in 2022 it was 24 days, in 2023 it was 26 days, and so far this April it is 22 days. This is a steep increase and I hope my colleagues in atmospheric science might be able to figure out an explanation for it.\n\nTwin Cities Almanac for April 26th: The average MSP high temperature for this date is 62 degrees F (plus or minus 11 degrees F standard deviation), while the average low is 42 degrees F (plus or minus 8 degrees F standard deviation).\n\nMSP Local Records for April 26th:\n\nMSP records for this date: highest daily maximum temperature of 85 degrees F in 1970; lowest daily maximum temperature of 32 degrees F in 1950; lowest daily minimum temperature of 26 degrees F in 1950; highest daily minimum temperature of 60 degrees F in 1990, and record precipitation of 1.46 inches in 2011. There was a record 3.0 inches of snowfall in 1893.\n\nAverage dew point for April 26th is 36°F; the maximum dew point on this date is 62°F in 1957; and the minimum dew point on this date is 6 degrees F in 1988.\n\nAll-time state records for April 26th: The state record high temperature for this date is 94 degrees F at Marshall (Lyon County) in 1962. The state record low temperature for this date is 8 degrees F at Embarrass (St Louis County) in 2002. The state record precipitation for this date is 6.90 inches at Morris (Stevens County) in 1954. The state snowfall record is 16.0 inches at Pelican Rapids (Otter Tail County) in 2008.\n\nPast Weather: A late season snowstorm brought record-setting snows to much of central and northern Minnesota on April 26 of 1893. Many observers reported from 3 to 10 inches, while a few places measured over a foot of snow. Crops that had been planted were under snow for two days.\n\nThe warmest April 26 in state history was in 1962 when most places saw an afternoon temperature of 80°F or higher. Eleven counties reported high temperature of 90°F or greater. After a morning low of 43°F the temperature rose to 90°F by afternoon at Campbell (Wilkin County).\n\nRecord-setting morning low temperatures prevailed across Minnesota on April 26 of 2002. Most observers reported temperatures in the teens and twenties. In portions of St Louis County and the Red River Valley temperatures were in the single digits. Gunflint Lake reported an afternoon high temperature of only 29°F.\n\nOutlook:\n\nCloudy and breezy over the weekend and into next week, with rain. There will be daily chances for showers and thunderstorms. Temperatures will generally remain above normal. Significant rainfall may accumulation for a number of sections of the state to end the month of April on an emphatic wet note. Warm and wet pattern will continue into early May.\n\nMark Seeley\n\nNear record warmth, followed by widespread, welcome rains\n\nNear record warmth, followed by widespread, welcome rains:\n\nLast weekend was by far the best weather of the year so far, with warm temperatures, bright, sunny skies, and comfortable humidity. Temperatures rose above forecasted highs on Saturday (April 13), and though a few degrees cooler on Sunday, temperatures remained quite comfortable for outdoor activities. A few long-term climate stations reported new record daily high temperatures over the weekend. Some of these included:\n\n89°F at Canby (Yellow Medicine County)\n\n88°F at Milan (Chippewa County)\n\n87°F at Winnebago (Faribault County)\n\n85°F at Litchfield (Meeker County)\n\n83°F at Wheaton (Traverse County)\n\n76°F at Cass Lake (Cass County)\n\nFollowing the warm weekend, a large area of low pressure brought showers and thunderstorms to most of the state over Tuesday and Wednesday, providing good, soaking rains to many areas that needed it. Rainfall amounts in the north were generally less than an inch, but many observers in central and southern Minnesota reported rainfall between 1 and 2 inches. Some long-term climate stations even reported new daily record rainfall amounts. Some examples:\n\nRedwood Falls (Redwood County) 2.23 inches\n\nSt Peter (Nicollet County) 2.02 inches\n\nKimball (Stearns County) and Artichoke Lake (Big Stone County) 1.80 inches\n\nMilan (Chippewa County) 1.68 inches\n\nSpring Valley (Fillmore County) 1.66 inches\n\nLong Prairie (Todd County) 1.62 inches\n\nWaseca (Waseca County) 1.44 inches\n\nLa Crescent Dam (Winona County) 1.42 inches\n\nMSP (Hennepin County) 1,.33 inches\n\nMorris (Stevens County) 1,32 inches\n\nThough not evident in the current Drought Map for Minnesota that still shows 44 percent of the state in Moderate to Severe Drought (because of cut-off dates used in the analysis) the significant rains of April 16-17 will undoubtedly help mitigate the drought situation and assist soil moisture replenishment before farmers begin spring planting. Speaking of planting, it appears that temperatures will rebound after this weekend to above normal levels for the remainder of the month, but there will also be more frequent chances for rain as well. So farmers will have to work in their crop seeding between rainy periods.\n\nWinds continued to blow with above normal intensity over the past week. Many climate stations have reported over 10 days so far this month with wind gusts over 30 mph, and some days with 40 mph and 50 mph gusts. Some examples:\n\nMSP 15 days\n\nSt James (Brown County) 15 days\n\nRochester (Olmsted County) 13 days\n\nWindom (Cottonwood County) 13 days\n\nRedwood Falls (Redwood County) 12 days\n\nMankato (Blue Earth County) 11 days\n\nWeekly Weather Potpourri:\n\nThe BBC reported this week that northern portions of the United Arab Emirates, including the Dubai International Airport were inundated on Wednesday (April 17) by record-setting rains. Some areas reported over 9 inches of rain, causing widespread flash flooding. The Dubai Airport reported 290 flight cancellations and over 400 flight delays. Average total rainfall in Dubai is only about 0.30 inches, while average annual rainfall is 3.81 inches.\n\nA recent article in the journal Nature documents estimates of the economic impact of continued climate change impacts through the year 2050 based on trends of the most recent 40 years. The authors conclude that “even if CO2 emissions were to be drastically cut down starting today, the world economy is already committed to an income reduction of 19 % until 2050 due to climate change.” The potential loss to the global economy far outweighs the cost of mitigating climate change now.\n\nIn this week’s AGU-EOS Bulletin there is an article about the National Interagency Fire Center outlook for the coming wildfire season in the USA. Because of a dry winter and lack of snow cover, the spring wildfire season in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin is expected to be busy. The authors mention that fire managers have already responded to 165 fires in Minnesota, and 342 wildfires have already burned in Wisconsin.\n\nMPR listener question:\n\nIt appears that the 2023-2024 snow season is behind us. We wondered was there any place in Minnesota that got near normal s"
