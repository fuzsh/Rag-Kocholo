        "text": "Browerville Solar Power Information & Peak Sun Hours\n\nSolar Green Energy Summary for Browerville, Minnesota\n\nLattitude: 46.0807\n\nSunlight\n\nFixed Tilt Sunlight Hours: 4.4 hours per day\n\n1-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 5.6 hours per day\n\n2-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 6 hours per day\n\nThe amount of hours from sunrise to sunset is equal to the total sunlight hours in a 24 hour period. Similarly, peak sun hours are the amount of total sunlight hours in a 24 hour period that are strong enough to provide power from being captured by a solar panel. Not every hour of sunlight delivers the same amount of energy resources. The sunlight at sunrise does not provide as many resources as the amount of sunlight mid-day. Thus, looking at the average peak sunlight hours for Browerville is valuable for calculating your solar needs.\n\nThe equator has a latitude of zero while Browerville has a latitude of 46.1. Any city located on the equator will receive the most sunlight throughout the year because the sunlight arrives at a perpendicular 90 degree angle to the earth at the equator. The further you are from the equator the more your daily sunlight hours can vary.\n\nThroughout the day the sun obviously moves throughout the Browerville sky. The suns position in the sky also changes throughout the year with the seasons. A fixed solar panel does not accommodate for these changes. However, a 1-axis panel rotates and follows the sun’s path during the day. A 2-axis panel both follows the sun’s daily path as well as the seasonal differences\n\nClimate in your geographical region is a major factor that will influence average peak sun hours per year. If you live in a region that does not have a lot of completely sunny days, then cloud coverage will greatly influence solar insolation on any given day. Mountains and trees may also contribute to lower solar insolation if they block the sun from your panels at any given point of the day.\n\nWe can use previous years of data to estimate the amount of peak sun hours in Browerville. A fixed tilt mount for example will receive 4.4 average hours per day. For more efficiency for your system in Browerville you could use a 1-axis tracking mount and increase your daily peak sun average to 5.6 hours, or even further with a 2-axis panel to get an average of 6 hours.\n\nSolar Businesses in Browerville, Minnesota\n\nBe the first to hear about the latest green energy news, technology and offers.\n\n[mc4wp_form id=\"2942\"]\n\nBy providing your email you consent to receiving occasional promotional emails & newsletters.\n\nNo Spam.
