        "text": "Rode from Houston to Fountain on Saturday 8/3/2024 as part of a one way ride that started in Houston Mn and ended at Niagara Cave, so I combo'd the Root River State Trail w/ the Harmony-Preston State Trail and a little open road riding at the end to total just over 70 miles.\n\nI love that from Houston to Fountain to Preston, this route was tree covered for like 80% of the time I'd estimate. That was really nice. I had a very low humidity day for my ride, but it was a 0 cloud day, so the sun would cook you. But you are very much isolated from it here.\n\nI was dropped off at Houston, Mn trailhead at 8am. The first part of the trail out of Houston, has a bit of packed dirt and sand in areas on top of the asphalt, through Rushford. Other than that, this trail is pristine up to Fountain. You just have to watch out for the occasional rough bridge transition and that's about it, hardly any holes or cracks or anything. (few bumps and cracks from the split down to Preston, a very small section) I only saw 3 people Houston through Rushford over those many miles. Then hundreds of ppl on the trail from Rushford to past Lanesboro, but it never ever felt crowded at all. Just a consistent 10-25ppl per mile. Then, Probably only a dozen or so ppl both directions from the split to Fountain and back to the split (very sparse over those 6 miles up and 6 miles back). One tree down in that segment to Fountain, but no big deal, just dismount and carry over.\n\nMy first stop was in Lanesboro (Rushford was closed when I passed it just after 9am), and the restrooms there right off the trail are air conditioned and super nice, with many bike racks and water fountain, and shade. Second stop in Fountain, after a fairly slow 6 mile climb up to Fountain. Restroom there and water fountain as well. Coasted back down towards Preston and stopped there. Also, nice restroom and water bottle filling station inside. Benches w/ shade.\n\nHighly recommend from Rushford on to Fountain. Skip the Rushford to Houston section if you don't want to get your bike dirty/dusty. :)\n\nRode from Preston to Harmony on Saturday 8/3/2024 as part of a one way ride that started in Houston Mn and ended at Niagara Cave, so I was a bit tired already having ridden 50 miles that morning, when starting this trail around 1pm. I enjoyed it, but it is starting show wear and tear w/ a significant amount of larger cracks. I did have a little extra weight in my bags of my trekking bike w/ water and spare tires and tools, so the cracks maybe worse than if you are lighter. I have 700x35 tires. And I was a little worried about busting up my back wheel w/ how big some of the cracks were. (hard to see some of them coming). I did dismount and walk up a part of the single longest and steepest climbs. (good excuse to take a water break).\n\nKeep in mind Harmony is 400' higher elevation than Preston, so Preston to Harmony is going to be significantly more uphill.\n\nAfter a mile or two out of Preston, I only saw one other couple riding e-bikes. So not another soul for 10 miles. (this was on a mild 80 degree low humidity Saturday afternoon in middle of summer). Also, T-Mobile service had a gap for me between the two towns. And while in that cell service gap, you are locked in on the trail, w/ no road intersect/exit for like 3.5 miles.\n\nFor me, once is enough on this trail.... I would go do it again if it was repaved or repaired. Mountain bike tires or fat tires would be much more enjoyable."
