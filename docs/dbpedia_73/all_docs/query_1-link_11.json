        "text": "Dodge Center, MN\n\nDodge Center, a Minnesota Star City, was founded in 1869 by early settlers who had faith and determination to sustain in the years ahead. The arrival of the Winona and St. Peter Railroad in 1866 established the site for the “village.” Its location was the geographic center of Dodge County so it was named Dodge Center. With the railroad depot completed, surrounding land was homesteaded, and homes were built in the village establishing more stores and businesses to meet the needs of early pioneers. Settling a new community required fortitude and confidence in knowing the city would succeed. Dodge Center has a rich heritage and great quality of life.\n\nWe are proud of our city and its growth and expect to continue seeing good things happen for us as we continue “Stepping Toward the Future.”\n\nCity of Dodge Center\n\n35 E Main St\n\nDodge Center, Minnesota 55927\n\n(507) 374-2575\n\nVisit Us Online"
