        "text": "The Green Shack is located in Dodge Center, MN. It is locally owned and family operated by Brittany and Zach Wilcox. Our vision for our farm and business, The Green Shack, was simple. We wanted to educate and inspire our community. We know there is a strong desire from the public to be more hands on and creative with their free time, and to learn more about what they can do to help their local environment. We offer a wide variety of classes, both educational and hands on, to help people achieve these goals.\n\nSome of the items we produce from our farm that we offer for sale are eggs, honey, and various plants. We strongly encourage people to visit and tour our farm. We incorporate organic and all-natural practices into our business, so people can see how we carry these practices out when we care for our plants and animals. We are very conscious of the land and our animals and we don’t like to have any products or by-products go to waste. So, we incorporate animal products like goats’ milk and beeswax into some of the other items we offer for sale or for use in our creating classes.\n\nBrittany loves to talk plants and plant care. She has a degree in horticulture. We know that while many people enjoy gardening, they are also a little intimidated by it. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn about plant care and grow their own food or just beautiful flowers if they choose to do so. To encourage our community to do that, we offer plant and garden care classes, as well as make ‘n’ take parties because we want every gardener to have a successful and abundant garden!\n\nOur farm also has a woodshop, kiln, and blacksmithing forge. While we welcome the public to use this space for classes and creation, we encourage you to contact us to set up an appointment. From there, we can brainstorm and create projects that you are interested in completing yourself, but don’t have the space or resources available to you at your own home. We are here for you to help you get these projects done!\n\nWe are excited to educate our community through farm tours, products we sell, parties we host and classes we offer. Please contact us for more information. We look forward to working with you!"
