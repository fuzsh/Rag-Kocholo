For other uses, see Fort Dodge (disambiguation).\n\nTown in Iowa, United States\n\nFort Dodge is a city in and the county seat of Webster County, Iowa, United States,[2] along the Des Moines River. The population was 24,871 in the 2020 census, a decrease from 25,136 in 2000.[3] Fort Dodge is a major commercial center for North Central and Northwest Iowa. It is located on U.S. Routes 20 and 169.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFort Dodge traces its beginnings to 1850 when E Company of the 6th Infantry were sent from Fort Snelling to erect and garrison a fort at the junction of the Des Moines River and Lizard Creek. It was originally named Fort Clarke but was renamed Fort Dodge because there was another fort with the same name in Texas. It was named after Henry Dodge, a governor of Wisconsin Territory (which had included Iowa until Iowa became a state in 1846).[4][5] The fort was abandoned by the Army in 1853.\n\nThe next year William Willams, a civilian storekeeper in Fort Dodge, purchased the land and buildings of the old fort.[citation needed] The town of Fort Dodge was founded in 1869. In 1872 the long and continuing history of gypsum production in Iowa started when George Ringland, Webb Vincent, and Stillman T. Meservey formed the Fort Dodge Plaster Mills to mine, grind, and prepare gypsum for commercial use.[citation needed] The Company constructed the first gypsum mill west of the Mississippi River, at the head of what is now known as Gypsum Creek.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2018, Kris Patrick, Executive Director of Fort Dodge Main Street, stated that Fort Dodge is locally referred to as \"Little Chicago\" because architects modeled downtown buildings to resemble Chicago in the mid-1900s.[6]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nFort Dodge is located at (42.506803, −94.180271),[7] on the Des Moines River.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 16.31 square miles (42.24 km2), of which 16.05 square miles (41.57 km2) is land and 0.26 square miles (0.67 km2) is water.[8]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nFort Dodge has a Humid continental climate with cold winters and hot humid summers.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1860672—18703,095360.6%18803,58615.9%18904,87135.8%190012,162149.7%191015,54327.8%192019,34724.5%193021,89513.2%194022,9044.6%195025,1159.7%196028,39913.1%197031,26310.1%198029,423−5.9%199025,894−12.0%200025,136−2.9%201025,2060.3%202024,871−1.3%\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census[12] of 2010, there were 25,206 people, 10,275 households, and 5,850 families residing in the city.

Drywall was patented by a Fort Dodge resident, and the gypsum used to create the Cardiff Giant hoax of the late 19th century was mined at Fort Dodge. Currently National Gypsum Company, Georgia Pacific Corporation, Celotex Corporation (now CertainTeed corporation) and the United States Gypsum Company operate gypsum facilities in and around Fort Dodge.[citation needed]\n\nFort Dodge is the home of Fort Dodge Animal Health (a division of Boehringer Ingelheim),[14] a major producer of pharmaceuticals and vaccines for veterinarian use. The company's headquarters were moved from Fort Dodge to Overland Park, Kansas in 1995. Two of the company's three United States manufacturing plants are located in Fort Dodge.[citation needed]\n\nAt least three major national trucking companies (primarily flatbed carriers serving the drywall industry) are based in Fort Dodge. The city also serves as a retail center for North-Central Iowa.[citation needed]\n\nFor most of the 20th century, meatpacking was a major industry in Fort Dodge. The last two large meatpacking plants (owned by Iowa Beef Processors and Hormel) closed during the 1980s, when such companies moved their facilities closer to beef production in western states such as the Dakotas. One of the laboratories of Fort Dodge Animal Health was built on the site of a former Hormel processing plant.[citation needed]\n\nThe Fort Dodge Correctional Facility, a 1,250-bed medium-security state prison, opened in 1998.[15]\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Fort Museum and Frontier Village is located on the southwest edge of Fort Dodge. It is a full-scale recreation of a military outpost on the prairie from the 19th century. It also features a reconstructed village from the same time period. Additionally, The Fort Museum has a replica of the Cardiff Giant, an archaeological hoax sculpted from gypsum mined at Fort Dodge. A \"Frontier Days\" event is held annually on the Fort Museum grounds. It features a parade, beauty pageant, historical reenactments, a buckskinner camp, and live entertainment. 2014 marked the 40th year of the event. Not all portrayals of early history at the Fort Museum are historically accurate and the facility is intended to be more of a tourist attraction as opposed to an actual museum.\n\nThe Blanden Memorial Art Museum, the first public museum of art in the state of Iowa, is located in the historic Oak Hill district of Fort Dodge. The Blanden opened June 5, 1932. The permanent collection on display includes European and American artists prints, sculptures and paintings. The museum also offers art classes for children and adults.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nFort Dodge maintains several music organizations, including a civic choral society, a city-funded municipal band, regional symphony orchestra, a Christian choral union, and a men's barbershop chorus. In 1896, the famous composer Edvard Grieg composed a piece entitled \"Impromptu to Grieg Men's Chorus in Fort Dodge, Iowa.\"\n\nShellabration is an annual rock concert held in late July/early August at the Oleson Park Music Pavilion, featuring nationally touring rock groups. Previous performing bands include Styx, Foreigner, REO Speedwagon, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.[16]\n\nThe Lizard Creek Blues Society sponsors an annual blues festival, \"Blues Under the Trees\", every summer, drawing blues musicians from all over the United States.[17]\n\nFort Dodge has most recently been named the \"Live Music Capital of Iowa.\" It is home to various live music venues hosting a variety of local aspiring artists and bands.[18]\n\nFort Dodge Choir Boosters (affiliated with Fort Dodge Senior High School) hosts the annual \"Fort Dodge Choral Festival\", which features high school and college choirs from around the upper Midwest under the direction of a nationally recognized conductor/composer.[19][20]\n\nFort Dodge Senior High School serves as a host location for the Iowa State Marching Band Festival, State Solo & Small Ensemble Festival, and regional high school jazz band competitions.\n\nTheater\n\n[edit]\n\nTheater and musical theater are historically popular arts activities in Fort Dodge, with the community maintaining three independent theater organizations. Hawkeye Community Theatre puts on six full-length productions a year of varied genre. Comedia Musica Players is a civic musical theater troupe that produces an annual musical each fall. Stage Door Productions provides theater training and performance opportunities for middle school, high school, and college-aged students during the summer. It produces one small-cast (10 or fewer) play per year.\n\nThe two local high schools and the community college produce a student-cast musical each Spring. The Fort Dodge Senior High School musical is the longest-running high school musical theater tradition in the United States, first produced in 1927.[21][22]\n\nHistorical structures\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst United Methodist Church\n\nAbandoned Ferris wheel, now located in Eagle Grove, Iowa\n\nAbandoned Rosedale Dairy, once manufacturer of Eskimo Pies\n\nDowntown Ghost sign\n\nParks and recreation\n\n[edit]\n\nOleson Park has woods and hiking trails.
