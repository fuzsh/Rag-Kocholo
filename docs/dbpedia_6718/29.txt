A crowd, thought to number more than 1,000 people, flocked to Regents Park Road to see Father Christmas, a host of musicians performing, and - unusually - Batman sporting his very own Primrose Hill bag on Sunday.

Stalls did a roaring trade as children rode on the flashing fairground rides and the festival reached its climax as DJ Mr Grimshaw, who fronts the Radio 1 Breakfast Show, turned on the Christmas lights.

He was joined by actress and singer Collette Cooper and Mercy Magic Cutler, whose socialite mum Fran Cutler is a good friend of Kate Moss’ and Mercy was a bridesmaid at the supermodel’s wedding to Jamie Hince in 2011.

Jo Barnett, of the Primrose Hill Business Association, organisers of the festival, said: “There was a great atmosphere, everyone came out, the stall holders did quite well, and the food was gorgeous as always. We were very pleased.”

She revealed the association had spoken to Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden about switching on the lights, but unfortunately she was unable to be in London on Sunday so well known-local Mr Grimshaw stepped in.

This year’s musical line-up included the Primrose Hill Community Choir, the BIG Sing London Voice choir, young people from 360 Arts performing arts school and The Fifth Element actor Charlie Creed-Miles and his Latin band the Bossanova Boys.

Collette, who organised the entertainment and also performed, said: “The music is a massive part of the day, all the entertainment, and I think everybody loved it.

“Lots of friends were here, it was a very community based thing and everybody is local, that’s what’s lovely about the fair.

“Everyone knows everyone and it’s quite normal. Everyone knows the lady who works in the tea shop and the butchers. We’re a very strong community.”
