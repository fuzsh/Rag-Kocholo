I live in Somerset now with my husband, Paul, and various animals. We moved here in 2006. It’s in the middle of nowhere, which is lovely. We live in a pretty grade II listed farmhouse. I like to live in a house that feels like it puts its arms around you.\n\nWhere did you grow up?\n\nWe moved around quite a lot when I was a child because my mother went where the work was, really. She was a single parent at the time. I was born in Taunton, spent my early years in Brightlingsea and then came back"
