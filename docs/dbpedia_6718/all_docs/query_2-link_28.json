She is actively involved in a carefully selected group of environmental charities; is a fellow of the WWF, a trustee of Tusk Trust, an ambassador for the Marine Conservation Society, World Horse Welfare, and recently the RSPB — amongst others. She has become a CIWF Compassion Visionary.\n\nIn early 2022 Deborah co-hosted the first series of The Big Green Money Show with Felicity Hannah, looking at company impact on the planet as well as how sustainability can be viewed as an opportunity or an inconvenience.\n\nIn July 2023 her book Why Money Matters was published; it’s described as an accessible guide to the world of money for 6- to 9-year-olds, and became an instant best seller."
