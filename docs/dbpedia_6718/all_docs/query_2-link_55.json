        "text": "Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden has paid an emotional tribute to her former Strictly Come Dancing partner Robin Windsor.\n\nWindsor, who died aged 44 earlier this week, competed with Meaden in the 2013 series of the BBC One dancing show.\n\nIn a tribute post on Instagram and X, Meaden described the news of Windsor's death as \"devastating\".\n\nShe said she was \"thinking of his family, friends and loved ones [who] will be aching at the loss\".\n\n\"Robin was a good man,\" she continued. \"He was kind and incredibly generous, supporting so many charities, helping so many people and giving so much of himself wherever he went.\n\n\"He lit up a room with his fun and energy and certainly his sparkle… he was never happier than when he was covered in crystals!\n\nMeaden remembered him as \"talented, clever (a great partner for a quiz), and fun\".\n\nWindsor and Meaden were the fourth couple to be eliminated in the 2013 series of Strictly and also took part in the show's live UK tour the following year.\n\nMeaden recalled: \"He taught my mother to dance for her 80th birthday party and they whirled around the dance floor at her party… he knew how to make people feel good.\n\n\"He was also complex and human and open about the struggles of life after the limelight. I was lucky to have known you Robin, it's hard to know you are gone.\"\n\nDuring his time on Strictly Come Dancing, Windsor was also paired with Patsy Kensit and Anita Dobson, both of whom were eliminated eighth, and Lisa Riley, who made it to the semi-final.\n\nThe year after Windsor partnered with Meaden, he was forced to pull out of the dancing series due to a back injury.\n\nBut although he was not partnered with a celebrity, he did return to the show part way through the 2014 series and appeared in group dances with the other professionals.\n\nHe also continued to appear in the Strictly Christmas specials until 2015, when he competed with Alison Hammond.\n\nAfter his death was announced, a huge number of Strictly stars past and present paid tribute to Windsor, including hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, judges Darcey Bussell, Craig Revel Horwood and Shirley Ballas, and pro dancers Oti Mabuse and Dianne Buswell."
