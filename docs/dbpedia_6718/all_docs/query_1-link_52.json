        "text": "(image)\n\nHi David (do friends call you Dave?), I obviously don’t know you but this seems like the kind of thing you wouldn’t be comfortable with at all and frankly, neither am I. My naturally rosy – albeit​ usually covered up with a good few layers of foundation and concealer – cheeks have flushed a deep shade of crimson so I’m going to stop addressing you personally and write the rest of this as a regular blog post if that’s OK?\n\nAs I write this, I’m lying in bed: Star Wars pyjamas on, hair in a bun on top of my head. I haven’t been washed nor dressed in two days. (It maybe three, I’ve lost count). I’m not nursing the mother of all hangovers nor been struck down with a terrible bout of food poisoning. I almost wish I had but, no. I have anxiety. There isn’t really another word or phrase I can use to dress it up or water it down. It’s anxiety. And it’s horrible. There’s plenty of other words and phrases I can use there: scary, awful, maddening, frightening and bloody shit are just some that spring to mind immediately. But yes, I have it and I wish with all my might I didn’t.\n\nLet me take you back just a bit.\n\n*this would be the part of the musical with the lights change, some dry ice is blown across the stage and an innocent looking Maria Von Trapp style character emerges from the wings*\n\nI’ve always – since I was little – been a bit of a worrier and fretted over things that probably, in hindsight, need not have been fretted over. But then -I want to say recently but tbh it’s probably been a lot longer if I’m altogether truthful – the worries grew arms and legs, became fiercely independent, dyed its hair black, got piercings and tattoos and started going by the name of The Fear. The Fear is awful. It’s not my friend at all and if I had the power to I would block its (no assigned gender) number, unfollow on Instagram and delete from Facebook without any inclination to have a cheeky stalk. But I can’t. The Fear has shackled itself onto me like Lord Voldemort to Professor Quirrell except I don’t get a snazzy turban as part of the deal which is annoying because it means I have no physical symptoms to show people when I say “it hurts and I feel really frightened” which leads people to think you’re a bit insane.\n\nWhich is ridiculous. You need only search the term ‘anxiety’ and there are literally thousands of blogs out there from people sharing their experiences with The Fear yet it’s still treated as a taboo.\n\nBut, I digress.\n\nI’m lucky in some ways because I can go days – even weeks if I’m really lucky – without having an ‘episode’ as my mum calls it. These wonderful, blissful times usually occur when I’m busy because my mind is occupied meaning it can’t possibly stop and open the door to The Fear. Over Christmas I was working two jobs and, yes I was exhausted, but I barely suffered at all. It truly was the most wonderful time of the year. Just now, however, right in this moment in time as we speak, I am going through the worst bout of the blasted thing I can recall.\n\nWhen it’s bad, it’s really bloody awful. Like, truly terrifying. When people are going through times of strife, they say that they wouldn’t wish it on their worst enemy and I’ve always scoffed and thought “I could SO wish that on someone” but I wouldn’t wish this on any living soul.\n\nAt its worst, I can’t be alone in the house because I’m so frightened (of nothing and everything at the same time) which is really bloody handy and means I need to phone my mum & dad, who are out looking to buy a new bed, to turn the car around because I need my mum to come and sit with me.\n\nLast week, I managed to prise myself out of bed to put a Gregg’s sausage roll in the oven but couldn’t bring myself to turn the oven on. The Fear was too great and my mind was racing with “what if you faint (which I am fairly certain is about to happen ANY second) and the oven is left on and catches fire and you’re by yourself, on the floor and-and-and-”\n\nThere’s also the lovely sensation of feeling like someone has their hand over your throat, stopping you from breathing and meaning you need to concentrate really hard just to swallow a sip of water.\n\nAll fun and games, eh?\n\nWhen I’m in the midst of an ‘episode’ I need to find things to keep my mind occupied. The ‘concentrate on your breathing’ approach doesn’t work for me at all because the more I think about my breathing, the more I am convinced I’m going to run out and start gasping for air so I need to find other activities for myself. A huge help is colouring in which is good because a) I’m concentrating so hard on staying in the lines I can forget about my little problem and b) I get a pretty picture by the end.\n\nAnother great help I have discovered, is watching back to back episodes of popular light entertainment comedy panel show, Would I Lie To You on YouTube. I can sit for literally hours at a time in front of my laptop for the pure and simple reason that it makes me laugh.\n\n(If, for some bizarre reason, you’ve been living under a rock and have never seen WILTY let me pause for a second to explain it: it’s a BBC panel show hosted by Rob Brydon where guests join team captains David Mitchell & Lee Mack to tell stories and everyone needs to guess if it’s the truth or a lie.)\n\nIt doesn’t really matter who the guests are because David, Rob & Lee (or The Trio as I like to call them) are consistently quick witted and always make me feel just that tiny bit better.\n\nI’m the kind of person who, after watching a film or TV show, will look up every actor/performer on Wikipedia so, naturally, I was doing a bit of swotting up on The Trio when j got to David Mitchell and I read about how he met his wife (poker player, Only Connect host Victoria Coren) at a celeb bash and was instantly smitten but she wasn’t interested and he was besotted with her for years before they finally got together and now they’re married and have a baby and the whole story just made me so HAPPY. It’s like a proper little love story and my heart just felt so full when I googled their wedding day and, my god, they were GLOWING.\n\nI mean, I even have a photo from said wedding saved on my phone because they just look SO HAPPY that it cheers me up ever so slightly. (Obviously this is a secret which will stay between us until this story is picked up by a screenwriter who makes it into a film.)\n\nSo, thank you David Mitchell (and Rob Brydon & Lee Mack) for being funny enough to make me feel just a tad lighter when everything else is bleak and horrible; for being a seemingly nice person – I won’t get too personal since I don’t know you and, for all I know, could be a total monster in real life but you seem lovely and for the lovely wedding photos I got off the Daily Mail website.\n\nHope you and the family are well!\n\nHeather x\n\nIt’s been 13 years since Girls Aloud beat One True Voice (rip) to the elusive Christmas number 1 with the absolute BANGER Sound Of The Underground and cemented their place as Best British Girl Band Of Our Time (Little Mix may or may not be on their way to stealing that crown).\n\nThe Girls released a whopping 23 singles, the majority of which were v impressive pop songs – which, more importantly, shaped my pubescence and inspired my style choices more than I care to mention. Obvs, I must pay tribute to the songs and the band accordingly on this joyous anniversary so here’s a run down of my personal faves from their back catalogue.\n\nThe Promise (2008)\n\nThe lyrics of this song make absolutely no sense; I still don’t understand Sarah Harding’s “walking primrose” verse at all but it’s undeniably one of the greatest pop songs of our time. A good pop song doesn’t require meaningful lyrics where there are floor length glittering gowns to be steamed and 60’s beehives to be coiffured. The Promise won Girls Aloud their first and only Brit award (thus far) but was their fifth win of Popjustice’s £20 Music Prize (far more credible imo).\n\nLife Got Cold (2003)\n\nNo one except me and my BFF seem to remember this song. If normal bands have the second album syndrome then reality stars have the third single syndrome where the debut single after the winner’s song is so hyped up that the third then gets lost and forgotten about (justice for Alexandra Burke’s Broken Heels). LGC is overlooked so much that it doesn’t even feature on the band’s greatest hits album. Nor is their cover of East 17’s Stay Another Day which was released as a double A side with Sound Of The Underground. A shambles, whoever compiled that album. A shambles.\n\nLove Machine (2004)\n\nYOUGOTTAHANGABOUTANDLIMBOFORASLONGASITAKE\n\nSound Of The Underground (2002)\n\n2002 was an exciting year for reality TV; Will beat Gareth in the Pop Idol final, Jade Goody got her ‘kebab’ out on national TV and charmed the nation and Pete Waterman & Louis Walsh went head-to-head (with Geri Horner nee Halliwell in the middle) with One True Voice & Girls Aloud. I remember Girls Aloud’s marketing campaign for the race to Christmas number 1 vividly because as a 10 year old I thought the play on words “Buy Girls. Bye Boys.” was very clever. Again, the lyrics make no sense but so what?\n\nCan’t Speak French (2007)\n\nIs this how Cheryl got her new husband?\n\nNo Good Advice (2003)\n\nI was so obsessed with this song when it came out I looked up the lyrics online then wrote them down in my diary. Also, the video came out around the same time as my mum got with the times and got cable TV and I would sit watching The Box for hours waiting to see the silver suits again. I didn’t try and recreate Cheryl’s using tinfoil.\n\nBiology (2005)\n\nThe intro to Biology hits you in the face then Nadine starts singing about her ‘durty brain’ and it stays on a high from there. There was a nifty dance move during the chorus involving using your arms as a clock which I still pull out from time to time. The video also massively influenced my teenage love with statement belts and wearing them over everything.\n\nLong Hot Summer (2005)\n\nA vastly underrated track, imo. This is another that has cruelly been omitted from the greatest hits compilation but it’s a cracking song. I love videos that feature a band doing ‘normal’ jobs like when the girls ran a salon in the video for The Show. Long Hot Summer follows suit and sees the girls go all Phil Mitchell on us working as mechanics.\n\nSee The Day (2005)\n\nThe band’s second effort at a Christmassy song since Sound of the Underground/Stay Another Day back in 2002. A perfectly crafted pop ballad cover version of Dee C Lee’s song from 1985, See The Day only reached number 9 in the charts. A travesty as far as I’m concerned.\n\nJump (2003)\n\nThis was Girls Aloud’s first cover of a single if you don’t count Stay Another Day. A brilliant electro-pop version of The Pointer Sisters hit was sure to be popular but being featured on the soundtrack to Greatest Christmas Film And Best Richard Curtis Movie Since Four Weddings And A Funeral, Love Actually thrust it even further into the mainstream. Rather fittingly, 2003/4 saw a resurgence of 80s fashion on the high street so the neon heels and ra-ra skirts favoured in the video and promo performances meant the girls could have been mistaken for an 80s tribute act at any given moment. Not a bad thing.\n\nSince Liberty X went on to be 10x more successful than Hear’Say and – albeit briefly – Gareth Gates was head and shoulders above Will Young in the fanatic stakes, it’s been a tradition in reality TV contests that it does artists better to not win. Winning comes with it a curse and the pressure to do amazingly well right away and to keep up that level of success whereas coming second or even third means an artist is free to take some time out to find their ‘sound’ and shop around for the right record label as opposed to being attached to one like winners are.\n\nAlthough it would be easy to do so, it would be unfair to narrow this down to only X Factor contestants as it would cut out the talent from the salad days of reality TV which shaped my pre-pubescent years so this list dates all the way back to the days of pop yore when we all thought Nigel was totes nasty and Simon Cowell was but an anonymous notch on Sinitta’s bedpost.\n\nIt took me helluva long time to narrow this down to only 10 songs. I could have gone on and made a whole compilation album in the style of Now Music so instead I’ve curated a playlist including these 10 songs and some other crackers which – sad as it is- didn’t quite make the cut.\n\nNo need to thank me.\n\nIf There’s Any Justice – Lemar\n\nYou’d be forgiven for forgetting Lemar came from a talent show but he came third in the first (of only two) series of BBC’s answer to Pop Idol, Fame Academy. He was beaten by David Sneddon of Stop Living The Lie fame and Sinead Quinn who came in second with the more deserving winner, I Can’t Break Down.\n\nLemar has had a whole load of brilliant singles and I very nearly went with the depressing but beautiful Someone Should Tell You (it’s in the playlist) but, in the end, I opted for this because the “just because he’s wrapped around your finger” line is so good and I’m a sucker for anyone who calls you “my girl”. Lemar, you smoothie, you.\n\nColourblind – Darius\n\nOnce upon a time, a ponytailed man named Darius treated the nation to the most excruciating rendition of Britney’s Baby One More Time which saw him quickly removed from the Popstars process. He bounced back and auditioned for Pop Idol the next year, coming third and releasing this corker of a song in summer 2002. He had some other OKish numbers but nothing lived up to Colourblind. If anyone’s curious as to what Darius is up to now he’s appearing opposite Sheridan Smith in Funny Girl in London’s Menier Chocolate Factory. How very swish.\n\nBest Song Ever – One Direction\n\nHow could a list of this sort be compiled without Harry & co? They came in third place during 2010’s X Factor – which was won by Matt Cardle who is probably the worst X Factor winner ever apart from Leon Jackson – and have gone on to become the biggest band in the world ever of all time. They’ve just released their fifth studio album and are currently on hiatus but whether they come back together as a group or not they have left us some truly amazing pop gems to enjoy. Best Song Ever is my personal fave because it’s just SO cheery and I love that they went to the trouble name the girl in the song (Georgia Rose) and give her a back story (her daddy was a dentist). Plus it has probably one of the best videos and dance routines of all time.\n\nJust A Little – Liberty X\n\nOriginally named Liberty, they lost out on winning a place in Hear’Say but showed Nasty Nigel Lithgoe who the real losers were by providing us with one of the most iconic songs of the 21st century. They even made black PVC catsuits look fashionable. The best moment is when Kelly comes in growling ‘you’re so innocent’ after Jessica’s smooth opening vocals. A proper modern day classic.\n\nDance With Me Tonight – Olly Murs\n\nOlly might not be the greatest TV presenter but by god he’s a good popstar. He was robbed of the title of X Factor winner 2009 by Little Joe McElderry but has gone on to become one of the show’s biggest successes. His career highlight in my personal opinion was his fly on the wall documentary for ITV2, Olly: Life On Murs. That title alone is award worthy. His debut single Don’t Let Me Go went straight in at number 1 and almost every single release since as been just as good (if we forget the flop that was Heart On My Sleeve). Dance With Me is a good, old fashioned pop song which appeals to both prepubescent girls and old ladies alike. I still think this should have been his first single as it opens with the line “my name is Olly, nice to meet you” which is on a par with Do It Like A Dude’s “stomp, stomp, I’ve arrived” as far as opening lines go.\n\n.\n\nAnyone Of Us (Stupid Mistake) – Gareth Gates\n\nIt’s only when I got older and re-listened to this song I realised how glaringly obvious it was that it was about Jordan. At the time, in all my innocence, I just knew it as an excellent song from my future husband and father of my children. This is arguably Gareth’s finest pop moment and a far worthier winner for 2002’s Record of the Year than Unchained Melody which took the coveted – and now sadly defunct – title.\n\nHold On Me – Phixx\n\nPhixx were the guys who didn’t make it into One True Voice who were the rivals to Girls Aloud in Popstars: The Rivals. Got that? I know that was a lot to take in.\n\nIf forgive you for not having heard or forgetting about this song but I assure you it is an excellent pop record. If this song was anything to go by, these guys had the potential to be big but they only released one other song after this – a cover of Duran Duran’s Wild Boys – before disappearing from the charts.\n\nMikey from the band sparked my sexual awakening before I was old enough to even know what a sexual awakening was.\n\nNothing’s Real But Love – Rebecca Ferguson\n\nOh, she was classy was Rebecca. Graham Norton has even said she’s the most talented artist to emerge from one of these shows so high praise indeed for Fergy. I was gutted when she lost out to Cardle but her debut single was a solid gold effort and was much more her style than Duffy’s Distant Dreamer which would have been her winner’s single.\n\nCome Back – Jessica Garlick\n\nPoor Jessica was only the second person to be eliminated from the very first Pop Idol when her rendition of Shakin’ Stevens’ Merry Christmas Everyone failed to charm the public. She redeemed herself when she was chosen to represent the UK in 2002’s Eurovision Song Contest with this belter of a ballad. It didn’t exactly set the charts alight and only peaked at 13 but it’s a beautiful little number that, more important than chart success, got us to joint third place in Eurovision! The closest we’ve come to being that high on the leader board since was Jade Ewen & Andrew Lloyd Webber’s effort in 2009 when we reached fifth place.\n\nSax – Fleur East\n\nFleur is undeniably the greatest popstar to come out of all reality TV talent shows ever. Sax is such a great single that I’m still not even a little bit sick of hearing it on the Asda Christmas advert. It’s been said by some important journo types and people on the Twitter that it sounds remarkably like Uptown Funk but let’s face it, that song was so outrageously brilliant that is it doing anyone any harm if Fleur chose to be influenced by it slightly? I mean it did give her a Moment on last year’s X Factor and in my humble opinion Sax’s “get loose, get right” section is well better than UF’s “uptown funk you up”.\n\nIt’s that time of year again (how fast has this year gone btw?!) when you can’t turn on a radio station or music channel without hearing the jingle bells of a Christmas tune. Some are still moaning and saying it’s far too early to have Christmas music playing but to them I say “bah, humbug” although I am the kind of person who happily listens to Slade in June so I don’t know if I should be trusted.\n\nSome of you will be pleased to know there are no X Factor winners’ singles in this list however I do have beef with anyone who doesn’t think Alexandra Burke’s Halleujah was an incredible cover of quite a boring song. Soz.\n\n(The Official Charts company have lovingly listed the top 10 best selling Christmas songs in the UK ever which is where I got all this info. I don’t have time to look up those figures myself. I have telly to watch.)\n\nWhen a Child is Born – Johnny Mathis (1976)\n\nLet’s be honest, it’s not the most exciting Christmas song, is it? I mean, yes it’s nice and it’s about Jesus and that which is what Christmas is all about but it doesn’t make you want to drink mulled wine then have a fight with an uncle across the Christmas table while someone is dipping uneaten brussels into cranberry sauce does it?\n\nTurkey or Tinsel? Turkey. It does get some points for the spoken section though. It’s a fact universally acknowledged that a spoken section makes a song so much better.\n\nThe Millennium Prayer – Cliff Richard (1999)\n\nSinging the Lord’s Prayer to the tune of Auld Lang Syne is a move which only Cliff could get away with. Everyone thought this was such a bad idea that his own record company, EMI refused to release it and it was instead released under independent label, Papillon Records.\n\nTurkey or Tinsel: Turkey. I know it was released as a charity record but that doesn’t stop it being god awful.\n\nFun Fact: A pre-Hear’Say/I’m A Celeb/Mumpreneur (what?) Myleene Klass sang backing vocals on this track.\n\nFairytale of New York – The Pogues feat. Kirsty MacColl\n\nHands down, the most depressing Christmas song of all time but EVERYONE’s favourite. It was kept off the number one spot in 1987 by the Pet Shop Boys cover of Always On My Mind which isn’t a bad song to play second fiddle to if we’re being honest. Rather naively, Lovely Ronan Keating recorded a version of this with Irish singer Máire Brennan which has appeared on more Worst Cover Versions Of All Time lists than the original has topped Best Christmas Songs Of All Time lists. He committed an unforgivable crime by changing “you cheap, lousy faggot” to “you’re cheap and you’re haggard”. Just no.\n\nTurkey or Tinsel: Alcohol drenched Tinsel. Ronan’s version is obviously a turkey and should be burned in the oven accordingly.\n\nWhite Christmas – Bing Crosby (1942)\n\nI’ll be honest, my opinion on this song is probably marred by the amount of times we were made to sing/listen to it at Christmas concerts in school but it bores me to TEARS. It’s also tainted by the rumours that, despite having the most chirpy sounding name in history, Bing wasn’t a very nice man. Soz to bring down the mood and that.\n\nTurkey or Tinsel: Turkey. Obvs the vocals are flawless but as Bing’s Christmas releases go, Little Drummer Boy feat. David Bowie is so much better. Bizarre but better.\n\nDo They Know It’s Christmas – Band Aid 20\n\nThe second best of the four Band Aids Sir Bob and the criminally overlooked Midge Ure have treated us too. (Band Aid 30 only just beats Band Aid II in my opinion, mainly because of Harry Styles.)\n\nIt’s funny to watch this now and realise just how irrelevant a good chunk of the artists are today. Dido, Ms Dynamite (Tee Hee) and second generation Sugababes made me the person I am today.\n\nMy favourite titbit about this version is that Justin Hawkins from The Darkness orginally recorded St Bono’s infamous line but Bono was outraged and insisted he re-record the line himself.\n\nTurkey or Tinsel: Tinsel. Purely for nostalgic value and Dizzee Rascal’s exemplary rapping skillz; “spare a thought this Yuletide for the deprived”\n\nMary’s Boy Child – Harry Belafonte (1957)\n\nI know it’s v ignorant of me but I had actually never heard this version of the song until now. I’ll be honest, it didn’t excite me in the way that Boney M did. It was missing the glitz and glamour and Jamaican influences. This is the kind of version you’d listen to whilst paying old, distant relatives a visit to drop off some gift vouchers in a card.\n\nTurkey or Tinsel: Turkey. I get that it’s, like, a classic but it’s just not as fabulous as Boney M’s rendition.\n\nMerry Xmas Everybody – Slade (1973)\n\nGod, I LOVE this song. I can’t be friends with anybody who dislikes it. Or Noddy Holder for that matter. He just seems such a nice man. The song sums up everything that’s amazing about the festive period from hanging up your stocking to your granny up dancing.\n\nSlade went head to head with Wizzard’s equally Yule-fuelled I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday which, shockingly, only reached number 4 in the charts. Altogether now, IT’S CHRISTMAAAAAAAAAS.\n\nTurkey or Tinsel: *chokes self on Tinsel*\n\nLast Christmas – Wham! (1984)\n\nLast Christmas is peak George Michael which is a strange sentiment from someone who wasn’t even born. I have obvs done extensive research on the matter though and feel I am fully able to air my opinion. His hair is so beautifully bouffant and the whispered “Merry Christmas” is the best moment of pop music history bar none. Of course, we can’t forget Andrew Ridgeley who wore that brooch beautifully in the video. I want George & Andrew to reunite as much as I want Grant to come back to Eastenders which, if you follow me on twitter, you’ll know is A LOT. Last Christmas holds the accolade for being the biggest selling Christmas single to not reach number 1. It was beaten by Band Aid which George did feature beautifully in so I guess it was a win-win for him. Soz Andrew.\n\nTurkey or Tinsel: Tinsel. Even if you’re name is Scrooge and you hate this song, you can’t fail to be charmed by the cover of the single.\n\nFun Fact: The girl in the video is Kathy Hill who, according to my mum, was a quite well known model at the time. According to Wikipedia, “the video also marks the last filmed appearance of a cleanshaven Michael, as he sported a beard (which he has had since then) in the video for “Everything She Wants”. So, there’s that.\n\nMary’s Boy Child – Boney M (1978)\n\nI won’t lie to you, I am shocked by how high up on the list this is. I mean, it’s a cracking song and those white cloaks are nothing short of fabulous but the second biggest selling Christmas single in the UK of all time? I’ve clearly been v ignorant to Boney M’s success. It annoys me that many edits of this song leave out the “Oh, my Lord” part which is hands down the best part of the song and is up there with the aforementioned whispered “Merry Christmas” in Great Pop Music Moments.\n\nTurkey or Tinsel: Tinsel. Elegant, silver tinsel obvs.\n\nDo They Know It’s Christmas – Band Aid (1984)\n\nThe second biggest selling single OF ALL TIME second only to Elton John’s Candle In The Wind. Sir Bob was inspired to do something about the famine in Africa after being shocked at the footage he saw on the news so roped in Midge Ure to write a song and called upon all of his famous friends – who apparently all happen to be white men – to do him a turn and, lo Band Aid was born. There have been four versions of the song to date but the original will ALWAYS be the best. Say what you like about Bono (and I have) but his line is the best moment by a mile.\n\nTurkey or Tinsel: Tinsel. But obvs I won’t be buying any and will instead be giving my money to charidee.\n\nFun fact: Paul Young’s opening lines were originally written for David Bowie who was ill and couldn’t show up but did record the chorus from LA.\n\nThere have been a grand total of 155 X Factor finalists (including this series) which has resulted in a LOT of performances. Some good, some bad, some downright awful and a few of them completely amazing. While the terrible performances can be memorable *tries to erase image of Stevi Ritchie covered in honey and feathers from mind* the really, truly brilliant performances are the rare jewels of the show that make you remember why you give in every year and give Cowell your attention.\n\nBefore we kick off proceedings I want to stress that these are in my opinion, obvs. I haven’t conducted any kind of official survey to feedback results from but I have watched every series of The X Factor so probably have as much credibility as a profesh music journo. Or at least showbiz reporter at large, Alison Hammond from This Morning (hi Eamon).\n\nLittle Mix – Don’t Let Go\n\nLittle Mix are not only arguably one of the best acts to come out of the X Factor (obvs only ‘one of’ because One Direction are the best) but my personal faves. I even liked them when they were first put together by the judges and called themselves Rythmix (remember that?) but it was this performance of En Vogue’s 90’s classic that made me properly sit up and pay attention along with Gary Barlow and the rest of the country (this was when the rest of the country actually watched the show unlike now). Their vocals are faultless and the simplistic choreography is just enough. My fave moment is the hands on hips pose the start before they walk towards their mics and SLAY us all. Now Disgraced Tulisa has every right to wear that smug smirk and dance with pride.\n\nNB: The best thing that has happened to Little Mix since winning the show is getting a new stylist. Poor Jesy had to put up with wearing leggings and a shirt week in, week out which done nothing to flatter her.\n\nFleur East – Uptown Funk\n\nX Factor judges love talking about ‘a moment’ when a performance is so exceptionally brilliant it puts the act in question at the top of the pyramid and has bookies up and down the country scrambling to adjust their odds. Mark Ronson hadn’t even released Uptown Funk when Fleur brought the house down with it on last year’s show. Her performance was so incredible her version went straight to number 1 on iTunes and Ronson was forced to release the song 5 weeks earlier than planned. Simon Cowell rated it as one of the top 3 performances in X Factor history and tbh I’m not going to argue with him. In fact, Fleur is probably the best bonafide popstar the show has produced.\n\nMarcus Collins – Lately\n\nMy favourite X Factor performances are the ones where there isn’t a whole lot of production value. Don’t get me wrong, I bloody LOVE a big song and dance number a la Fleur but since its inception the show has been needlessly mocked for being, well basically, a lot of tripe featuring vulnerable contestants with little to no talent so when a legit flawless singer comes along I’m all HA! SEE?! to the naysayers. Marcus was/is quite the all rounder; he could do the big production numbers and even sang Hey Ya on top of a plane in Wembley during the final but the simplicity of his version of Stevie Wonder’s Lately gave me actual goosebumps. You know when you hear an incredible note and the hairs on the back of your neck literally stand the attention? That. When I watched this performance back when I was compiling this list I even got a wee bit emosh. I mean it was probs PMT but still.\n\nFun fact: Marcus is now in Kinky Boots in the West End alongside Matt Henry who was a finalist in the second series of The Voice UK #whenworldscollide\n\nSame Difference – All I Want For Christmas\n\nRemember what I just said about simplicity? Lolz.\n\nSame Difference got a lot of (Caroline) flak during their time on the X Factor and tbh some of it was completely valid. The brother & sister act were full on cheese. Their performances were camp and colourful but do you know what? They were FUN. If you’re going to do a Christmas song then you may as well crank the festivities up to 100 otherwise, what’s the point?\n\nThis performance of Mariah’s Crimbo classic has all the ingredients of a family friendly panto packed into a mere 2 and a half minutes; there’s flying, massive Christmas trees, Santa suits, glitter…there’s even a bunch of children dressed as elves FFS. I defy you to watch this and not grin from ear to ear like a child on Christmas Day.\n\nAlexandra Burke & Beyonce – Listen\n\nFrom about halfway through the series it had pretty much been decided that Alexandra was going to win. She was basically a much more fun version of previous winner, Leona Lewis who didn’t do much except stand there and warble. Alexandra danced and looked like she was actually enjoying herself. To cement Alexandra’s win, the X Factor tradition of getting to sing with a proper famous artist was taken to a whole other level when Simon Cowell spent the majority of the show’s budget on Beyoncé. So much so that Louis Walsh had to draft in Westlife & Boyzone to sing with the other two finalists for probably nothing more than a cup of tea and the bus fare home. It was totes worth it though because this is probably the greatest moment in the show’s history. It’s so good that I can forgive Alexandra’s stint as Kelly Rowland’s stand-in back in 2011 when she hit out with “ok dot com” and pretty much done a Joss-Stone-at-the-2007-Brits and ruined her career. Jokes, Burko, you’re well good in The Bodyguard *salsa lady emoji* #singitgurl\n\nDear Mr Cowell,\n\nI do hope you and the family are doing well and little Eric is happy and healthy. I noticed a few weeks back you were asking for some recommendations on children’s films to watch with him. My personal suggestion is Shrek as it’s fun for all the family.\n\nI am writing to you today on a professional basis. I really want to be an X factor judge. Before you try and doc me off, you should know that I don’t want to be like Dermot and start off on the Xtra Factor and work my way up. I want to do a Nick Grimshaw and go straight into playing with the big boys despite having no previous qualifications or knowledge on music. Oh, I am wicked. That Simon (can I call you Simon?) was an example of my witty personality. A trait which I believe is very important in your line of work.\n\nThis year’s X Factor has hardly set the Saturdays alight as you had hoped and you must feel a bit silly about your Peter Andre on Strictly jibe after he came top of the leaderboard. His cha cha cha was exquisite for week one, did you see it?\n\nAnyway, I digress.\n\nYou see, Si (am I getting too personal now?), I have been an avid watcher of TV talent shows since Popstars gave birth to Hear’Say and I am fully convinced I know what it takes to find the next big thing. I am also a heavy drinker so think I would fit in well if you were to bring Sharon back which I think most of the British public would agree is a good idea. Please accept this blog as my official, written application to the role stated above.To prove to you how dedicated I am about this role I have outlined some rules I would bring in if I am successful in my application.\n\nBan any and all sob stories. If you’re not good enough to get through on your talent, don’t think I’ll take pity on you because your hamster died or your great uncle once removed died and left a half written application form in your name in his will.\n\nNo children running on stage when mummy gets through to the next round.\n\nIf a contestant served in the armed forces they should not feel the need to wear their uniform to audition. I worked in a call centre. You won’t see me sitting behind the desk with my headset. Contestants should also not feel the need to bring their previous job up at every given opportunity.\n\nThe following songs will not be allowed during any part of the process:\n\nany obvious Whitney songs such as I Will Always Love You (unless it’s the Dolly version) and I Have Nothing.\n\nAll Mariah Songs\n\nAny Leona Lewis number\n\nHallelujah\n\nFallin’ (this song hasn’t been relevant since 2002, please move on)\n\nShould this rule not be adhered to, as judges we should be able to forcibly eject contestants.\n\nIf you get a ‘no’ and refuse to take rejection with dignity the audience will be armed with rotten fruit to throw.\n\nContestants who have previously had record deals will not be permitted to audition. They had their chance and weren’t good enough to make it then.\n\nNone of this strange putting-solo-acts-in-groups-during-boot-camp. I am on the contestant’s side and want them to do well. If they auditioned as a solo act they shall stay as a solo act throughout their time on the show.\n\nAll judges will be served alcoholic beverages throughout the process with double servings for the lives to deal with nerves.\n\nIf I am successful in gaining employment can I also request that Dermot O’Leary be reinstated as host. I do like Caroline and Olly but Dermot is Dermot.\n\nIf you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you regarding my application.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHeather Hardcastle"
