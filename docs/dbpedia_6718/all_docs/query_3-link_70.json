        "text": "The competition launches as data, analysed by the Academy, shows a trend for sustainable home inventions is gripping the UK, as Brits take sustainability and tackling the cost-of-living-crisis into their own hands.\n\nThe number of TikTok videos in the UK with the hashtag “#sustainableliving” have increased by 190% in the last year, coinciding with a boom in influencers promoting inventions which make everyday life more sustainable.1 This includes social media sensation James Stewart, a sustainable living content creator who has seen his follower count grow to over 17,000 in the six months he’s been on the video-sharing platform.2 Sustainable inventions he has promoted include Bee Bricks, which provide bees with safe spaces in urban environments, and have become part of building regulations in Brighton, and a Liquid Tree which fights air pollution using water and micro algae.\n\nWith 40% of TikTok’s UK audience coming from the Gen Z age group, young people are leading the charge and trying to make a difference to society.3 But Brits of all ages are embracing this resourceful attitude, with a fifth (20%) of people in the UK saying that individuals have more responsibility for supporting sustainable initiatives than corporations or international organisations.4\n\nSeeing the nation embrace its inventive side, with 44% millennials (increasing to 51% for Gen Z) now describing themselves as creative individuals, will be welcome news to the UK’s engineering community, amidst concerns around the perception of engineering preventing young people from considering a career in the profession. While engineering will play a pivotal role in achieving the UK’s net-zero goals, the country does not currently have enough engineers to meet this demand.\n\nThat’s why this National Engineering Day (Wednesday 1 November 2023), the Royal Academy of Engineering will announce the winner of its “Everyday Engineering” competition, with a public vote on social media deciding the best invention. The lucky winner will have the opportunity to meet Deborah Meaden and get her advice on their idea, as well as an award from the Royal Academy of Engineering and a mentoring session from its Enterprise Hub. The Enterprise Hub supports talented entrepreneurs to transform breakthrough engineering innovations into disruptive, scalable businesses by connecting talent with expert-led training and mentoring from the unique, prestigious network of Academy Fellows, which includes some of the UK’s most successful entrepreneurs and business leaders.\n\nSuccessful entrepreneur and Dragons’ Den Investor, Deborah Meaden, said: “Sustainable inventions and the businesses that come out of them will be the key to meeting the UK’s net zero goals and tackling climate change. These inventions would not be possible without the engineers who create them. From a revolutionary new type of car battery made in a shed to a home-compostable alternative to plastic film created in a kitchen, I passionately believe everyone has the capability to think like an engineer and create something that positively impacts both people and planet.\n\n“It’s fantastic to be part of a competition that embraces these values, and I can’t wait to see the ideas people come up with. Whether you have a plan to improve an existing product or have a unique idea that could be the answer to solving the most pressing environmental issues facing our society today through engineering, I urge you to enter.”\n\nDr Hayaatun Sillem CBE, CEO of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: “We’re delighted to have Deborah Meaden involved with National Engineering Day. Her passion and dedication to sustainability are an inspiration to entrepreneurs across the UK, and we hope her commitment to innovation will help stimulate a new generation of creators.\n\n“I look forward to seeing the nation’s ideas for sustainable inventions and to discovering everyday engineers across the country. Ideas to create a more sustainable everyday can come from anyone, and this competition is a fantastic way to celebrate the varying skillsets that our industry requires.\n\n“The UK urgently needs more engineers if we are to meet our shared societal challenges, including climate change. We hope that through National Engineering Day we can raise awareness of the vital role engineers play in addressing this and encourage more people across the nation to consider this rewarding career path.”\n\nFind out more about National Engineering Day here and the “Everyday Engineering” competition here.\n\nNotes for editors\n\nAbout the Everyday Engineering competition\n\nEntry requirements can be found at www.raeng.org.uk/ned-competitionThe Royal Academy of Engineering is looking for the ideas and innovations (which exist as either a sketch, prototype or model) that could make our daily lives more sustainable. A sustainable innovation is something that’s making our daily lives function in a less wasteful way – that’s wasteful in terms of energy, finances, resources. It’s something that is designed to make our lives and our impact on the planet better without negatively impacting on people or the planet. This could be a living chandelier light which purifies the air indoors, or a biodegradable ice-cooler box or edible tableware – planet-improving innovations created by everyday engineers like you or me. Other examples of sustainable innovations that have gone from home-spun idea to commercial innovation are: Swytch Bike, the London-based company that’s turning drivers into cyclists by converting bikes into eBikes. The Swytch eBike conversion kit turns a regular bicycle into an electric bicycle. Converting existing bicycles into electric ones is more energy efficient than building an electric bike from scratch. By converting bikes into eBikes Swytch aims to contribute to a more sustainable transport system and in converting drivers into cyclists be part of the bigger picture of combatting climate change. MarinaTex is a home-compostable alternative to plastic that is made from fish processing waste and was created by product designer, Lucy Hughes in her kitchen. From bags to single use packaging, MarinaTex has a variety of applications. The transparent film is well suited for packaging and will biodegrade in a soil environment within six weeks. The organic formula does not leach harmful chemicals and can be consumed, causing no harm to wildlife or humans.On National Engineering Day, the public will be asked to vote for their favourite idea or innovation from three finalists. The public will be asked to vote on Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) via a poll, and on Facebook by liking the appropriate post. The vote will open from 00:01 on 1 November 2023 and the winner will be announced later that day.
