        "text": "What Did You Miss?\n\nPeter Jones was left dumbfounded by a Dragons' Den investment in the latest episode on BBC One.\n\nTaking to the pitching floor were Mike and Ben of Kerbo Charge, a fledgling business that fitted underground charging cables for electric car drivers right outside their property. With the government set to kill the manufacturing of petrol and diesel vehicles in 2035, longtime dragon Deborah Meaden spotted an opportunity.\n\nPutting it mildly, her co-star Jones was less convinced when Meaden agreed to invest Â£50,000 for a 6% share in the company.\n\nWhat, how and why?\n\n\"I'm flabbergasted,\" smiled Jones in the aftermath. \"You offered on an underground cable track. Honestly, I don't know what to say...\"\n\nBefore the deal was struck, Jones had made no secret of his disinterest in the business - while Meaden was keen to find out more. \"It's quite fixed in its location, obviously,\" stated Jones in his appraisal.\n\n\"If this is required and you've got a street full of electric cars, you'd need this all the way down the street. We could end up having street fights over who's charging their cars. I think that's a major, major flaw in this and I just don't see the bigger opportunity here.\"\n\nStepping in, former Weststar Holidays director Meaden commented: \"So I couldn't agree less with Peter, because I think you've got a ready group of people who are desperate to solve this problem, to help their revenue.\n\n\"Local authorities have an impending massive problem that is going to cost them a fortune unless they find themselves a very cost-effective way of dealing with this driving issue. And there is a lot of cash around for solving these problems. This is solving an issue and you have very little competition. What I can bring is contacts beyond what I'm sure you hoped for, so I'm gonna make you an offer guys...\"\n\nHer offer did meet Mike and Ben's investment request, but for a larger stake in the business.\n\n\"Guys, I'm beyond shocked,\" revealed Jones, whose turn it was to either join them or drop out.\n\n\"Frankly, nothing surprises me in here but I just find this incredible that we're even having a conversation about something that is averagely innovative; a tube underground with a self-sealing clip on the top that's gonna hide a cable across a pathway.\"\n\nHe claimed that Kerbo Charge still had \"so far to go\" and that Meaden's interest was \"mad\".\n\nDragon's Den airs Thursdays at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nRead more:\n\nDragons' Den's Emma Grede rescues entrepreneur from Deborah Meaden's interrogation\n\n'The hardest part of being on Dragons' Den was arguing with Peter Jones'\n\nDragons' Den history made as all five dragons invest in lowest valued business"
