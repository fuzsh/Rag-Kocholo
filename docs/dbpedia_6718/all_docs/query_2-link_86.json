The businesswoman was reacting to being a feature of the show on Friday night.\n\nDeborah wrote: “Watching @C4Gogglebox to find out Deborah’s done one is mildly disturbing.” It comes after the show's cast had a discussion about her during one segment.\n\nFan favourite Mica said: “Do you know that I just love Deborah Meaden? I just love her!” only for her partner Marcus to reply: “F’real? She reminds you of yourself innit. Feisty and miserable.\" And Mica told him: \"Ain’t nothing wrong with that combo, y’know.\"\n\nREAD MOREVicky Pattison breaks down over prioritising 'attention' over 'respect'\n\nDeborah is one of five Dragons used by the show this series. Her co stars incude Touker Souleyman, Peter Jones, Steven Bartlett and Sara Davies. In the replies, fans rushed to comment on Gogglebox's discussion about her.\n\nCathryn wrote to one critic: \"It's just a bit of fun. Something that makes people laugh. Kindness and laughter is what the world needs more of. Yeah there's time to watch real world events live but honestly give it a go. Might make you smile.\"\n\n\"I’m not sure why Dragon’s are always put off when their prospective business partner just tries to negotiate a better deal,\" Lester replied. And Liz said: \"They were a bit harsh!\"\n\nDeborah told her: \"I don't mind.\" The Dragons Den star added: \"They have been lovely too.\" And fan Blowpops said: \"You’re watching Goggkebox whilst I’m watching Dragon’s Den. Did I just slip into some parallel universe or what?\"\n\nREAD MORELegal smoking age in UK could change under plan to make nation smoke-free\n\nWATCHI stayed at 'world's most revolting hotel' - and felt like I was in horror movie"
