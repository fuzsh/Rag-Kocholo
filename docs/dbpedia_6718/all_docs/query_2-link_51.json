        "text": "In an exciting new partnership for 2024 –NESCAFÉ B2B by Nestlé Professional – has given small and medium businesses, a unique opportunity to win bespoke insight and advice from serial entrepreneur and business guru Deborah Meaden.\n\nOpen to SMEs, across all industries, the new business programme, by NESCAFÉ, Let’s Partner up for Good, has seen seven lucky businesses win a seat at the table to discuss their business challenges relating to their sustainability journey, workplace wellbeing and business growth with Deborah Meaden and NESCAFÉ® B2B business experts.\n\nThe winners had the opportunity to ask them face-to-face advice at a live filming studio with audience in Soho, London. The business advice from the live event will be shared with SME community in a series of 3 short films and written collaterals.\n\nWe know that there are common themes and challenges amongst entrepreneurs. By working with real businesses, we’ve been able to understand some of those challenges first-hand and offer thoughts, tools and advice that we hope will benefit the winners and through the campaign, reach the wider SME community. If as a NESCAFÉ team, we can support and make a positive impact, this means the world to us.\n\n– Katya Simmons, Managing Director, NESCAFÉ by Nestlé Professional\n\nAiring from September 2024 onwards at Nestlé Professional’s website and YouTube channel – business owners are encouraged to sign-up on the website now to receive updates and announcements on the film live dates.\n\nThis is a fantastic initiative that I’m delighted to be a part of. Running a business can often be overwhelming and at times, even a little lonely. There’s a lot to think about, from operating responsibly through to prioritising wellbeing for employees, all whilst focusing on growth targets and moving the business forward. Helping businesses develop and grow, based on my own experiences, is something I love to do. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for each of the winners.\n\n– Deborah Meaden\n\nNESCAFÉ, Let’s Partner up for Good Winners\n\nPatrick Ellis – Sawn to be Wild ​Sawn To Be Wild Ltd\n\nKatie Harrison – Picture News Teaching Resources for Assemblies\n\nKym Morris – Legionella & Fire Safe Services​ Legionella Services & Passive Fire Services Company\n\nDr Haris Mazhar – Cintillate ​ Cintillate\n\nJack Bussey – JJB Construction​ JJB Corporation UK Ltd\n\nJamie Smith – InScout Network InScout Network\n\nSimon Poole – Splash Projects splashprojects.com\n\nIt was an incredible honour to be selected as one of the seven winners by Nestlé Professional to spend a day with their experts and Dragon’s Den’s Deborah Meaden. The advice we received was invaluable, and we were thrilled to get feedback not only from Deborah but also from Nescafé’s sustainability expert, Robin Sundaram, who congratulated LFS on our significant efforts in business sustainability. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Nestlé Professional in the future.\n\n– Kym Morris, Legionella Fire Safe Services (One of the seven winners)"
