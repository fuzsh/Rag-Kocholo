        "text": "Now, many folk may have a lot to say about that.\n\nI will merely observe that one of the delicious pleasures of TV viewing has gone.\n\nTV used to be watched in homes, on sofas, communally.\n\nThis meant shows such as Antiques Roadshow were watched in a slightly different way in every household.\n\nIn ours, Antiques Roadshow was watched solely to see those smug types who thought they owned Ming vases discovering they owned vintage Argos.\n\nIn my friend’s nicer-natured home they tried to guess the date.\n\nAs for Dragons’ Den (Sunday, BBC2), some families tried to guess the stake, the percentage and the end result.\n\nSome just enjoyed the glaring.\n\nIt was the same across the schedules.\n\nI’m aware, therefore, that not everyone will have watched the last in the current series of Dragons’ Den for the same reasons as me.\n\nI’ll wager I’m not alone though in finding most of this show irrelevant.\n\nA friend of mine used to refer to that other crowd-pleaser, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, as Who Wants To Win A New Conservatory?\n\nShe had realised early on that most contestants won themselves 32 grand and went home and that this, over time, was quite dull.\n\nThe same has always been true of Dragons’ Den, where backers and pleaders simply shunt numbers about to music.\n\nWill you give me 80 grand for a five per cent stake in my revolutionary biscuit tin concept?\n\nNo I’ll give you 50 for 20.\n\nAlthough the money kind of exists, the business barons might as well be talking about tickets to the Moon.\n\nEven if it all really happens later, we don’t see it, and what we don’t see isn’t there.\n\nThe only pleasure in a Dragons’ Den episode lies in seeing a halfbaked idea torn to shreds.\n\nWell, that’s what I’ve always thought... until last night’s finale.\n\nOn came a studious-looking chap with a scrappy beard and glasses in a stained lab coat who proceeded to fire puffs of dry-ice smoke at the Dragons.\n\nWe waited for them to consume him in fire.\n\nNot a bit of it.\n\nInstead they pleaded for a tiny stake in this young man’s brilliant, wacky science-education concept like puppies after a choc drop.\n\nIt was a true delight.\n\nThe Dragons stopped harrumphing and grumping for the cameras.\n\nThe young genius beamed with shy delight and a point was proved.\n\nGood things really can happen.\n\nEven on TV.\n\nCountry Strife: Abz On The Farm (Sunday, BBC2) is a reminder of the same thing.\n\nMostly.\n\nEnfield-born rapper Abz and his partner Vicky are a lovely pair, putting what seems like a challenging past behind them in pursuit of a much simpler rural existence.\n\nThey are not the first to discover that caring for other lives is a way of fixing and strengthening your own.\n\nI wish that was enough to make a TV programme fly.\n\nOf course it isn’t, which is why Abz is forced to stare in childlike wonder at pieces of fruit he’s allegedly never seen before (in Enfield, trust me, you can buy every tuber and berry on the planet).\n\nThe set-piece where he smashed up his guitar for kindling was a step too far.\n\nThey might be after the Good Life but don’t make this a sitcom."
