        "text": "Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden has been announced as the opening keynote speaker at this year's electrifying Fully Charged LIVE UK South.\n\nThe highly successful entrepreneur and fellow of the WWF is a well-known supporter of sustainable businesses, environmental charities and initiatives.\n\nOrganisers also unveiled plans for the show's first-ever Zero Carbon Kitchen, with entertaining and educational live cooking demonstrations headlined by plant-based specialists, BOSH!\n\nDescribed as a 'festival of electrification' and sponsored by ElectriX, the popular home energy and electric vehicle show returns to Farnborough International for the fifth time this spring and promises to be bigger and better than ever.\n\nThis year's event includes an array of visitor attractions, kids' activities, dozens of 'live sessions', and an exhibition of hundreds of companies, with electric vehicles of all shapes and sizes and a huge selection of home-energy options too.\n\nIt's all inspired by the hit YouTube channel founded and hosted by Robert Llewellyn (Red Dwarf, Scrapheap Challenge) which attracts a consistent global audience of more than four million viewers per month.\n\nRobert said: \"The growth of Fully Charged LIVE in the UK and overseas is a source of constant surprise.\n\n\"The flagship show in Farnborough is set to be much bigger again, and I am incredibly excited that Deborah Meaden, as well as our presenters and many other high-profile friends of Fully Charged, are going to join us on stage.\n\n\"Above all though it is really rewarding to see our audience in person.\"\n\nZero Carbon Kitchen\n\nNew for 2023, the Zero Carbon Kitchen is an entertaining and educational live demo area where leading experts can cook plant-based recipes with all-electric appliances, powered by an EV with vehicle-to-load capability.\n\nLive cookery demonstrations and tastings will take place on all three days and the world’s best-known plant-based specialists BOSH! will be the headline chefs.\n\nBOSH! launched in 2016 with the mission of putting more plants on plates. Since then, the founders, Henry Firth and Ian Theasby have become the best-selling plant-based authors in the world, with 2.5 billion views on YouTube.\n\nAs well as a daily cooking demonstration, Henry and Ian will be signing BOSH! books and will join Robert for an 'Electric Fireside Chat' on Sunday, April 30.\n\nAlso joining the cooking demonstration line-up will be plant-based chef, nutrition coach and recipe developer Lisa Marley who has a monthly column in Vegan Food & Living magazine and is a guest expert every Sunday on BBC Radio.\n\nSpeaker sessions\n\nMore than 30 speaker sessions will be held across two theatres, featuring presenters from the Fully Charged SHOW, expert panellists and special guests - with more to be announced soon.\n\nThese live sessions will look at topics such as 'Are Electric Car Conversions the next big business?', 'Energy & EV myth busting!', and the favourite 'Electric Fireside Chat', hosted by Robert Llewellyn, where he talks with big names from the clean-energy industry as well as a few familiar faces.\n\nIndependent advice\n\nThe Home Energy Advice Team (HEAT), powered by OVO, will be on hand throughout the show to offer advice on ways to improve your property to reduce your impact on the planet.\n\nWhether it's simple changes like turning down the thermostat or changing the showerhead or bigger projects, they will be on hand with independent advice.\n\nThey will discuss the latest in insulation, energy efficiency, smart thermostats, thermal storage, air-source heat pumps, ground-source heat pumps and the newest zero-emission heating technologies.\n\nKids' Zone\n\nWith free entry for little ones, parents will be able to bring the little ones for a fun-packed day of activities.\n\nFrom a sustainable Lego city to learning circus skills, it promises to be an educating, entertaining and great-value family day out.\n\nTest drives\n\nBut as ever, at the heart of it, all the cars will be the stars.\n\nFully Charged LIVE offers the most complete line-up of electric cars that can be seen anywhere in the world and thousands of test drives each day.\n\nCompanies such as Polestar, Hyundai, BYD, Genesis and others will be providing their top models for you to drive, as well as electric motorcycles supplied by A E Bikes and Fonz that will be available for you to try too.\n\nThere will be plenty of incredible cars to see, along with a look to the future, with a focus on new electric cars due out soon and concepts and prototypes which may be the future of transport.\n\nVisitors will also have the chance to ask questions about running electric cars and talk about all of the charging options both at home and away from home.\n\nThere will also be a host of electric skateboards, scooters, bikes and trikes, mopeds and motorbikes to view, along with commercial vehicles such as buses, coaches and trucks.\n\nFind out more?"
