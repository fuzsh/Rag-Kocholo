No stranger to glamorous dresses, she went on to set up a fashion franchise in Italy.\n\nDragons' Den has enabled her to invest in all manner of businesses, from a wool manufacturer to a company producing baby products, an online antique valuation service and a recipe website. So far she has invested in has made 35 investments in the Den worth over 2million.\n\nDeborah may be a self-confessed hard and tough business woman, but she is also an animal lover, an ambassador for WWF, and patron and advisor to the Tusk Trust..
