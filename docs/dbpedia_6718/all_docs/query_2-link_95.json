        "text": "Deborah Meaden, who stars on the BBC’s Dragons’ Den, revealed that years on from taking part in Strictly Come Dancing she suffers pain in the balls of her feet. Speaking to Closer Magazine she said: “I still have permanent pain in the balls of my feet, which is a constant reminder that I did the show. It started after I spent ten hours a day waltzing and I put too much pressure on them. Everybody is injured in some way (on the show) but now I need to have steroid injections in my feet to keep them supple.”\n\nDeborah admitted she should have the steroid injections every six weeks, but revealed she leaves her feet until they hurt too much before seeing her specialist.\n\nBut despite her constant pain, Deborah also revealed how much she enjoyed the experience of Strictly and hasn’t given up hitting the dance floor.\n\nShe reportedly dances for two hours a week to keep fit.\n\nPain in the ball of the foot\n\nThis type of pain is known as metatarsalgia and is often caused by exercising too much or wearing shoes that are too tight.\n\nSome people’s foot shape can also put extra pressure on the ball of the foot.\n\nBut there’s not always a clear cut cause for pain in this area of the foot, and you should see your GP to discuss treatment options.\n\nYou should definitely see a GP if the pain is severe or stoping you doing normal activities, or if the pain gets worse or keeps coming back.\n\nIt’s also advised you see a doctor if the pain doesn’t improve after treating it at home for two weeks, if you have any tingling or loss of sensation in your foot, or if you have diabetes - as foot problems can signal something more serious.\n\nSteroid injections are used to treat a range of conditions, including joint pain, arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nYour doctor will recommend whether or not you should have steroid injections.\n\nAnother star who suffered a foot injury is EastEnders' Tamzin Outhwaite."
