        "text": "Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden found herself on the receiving end of Peter Jones' scathing comments after she made a confession about her morning routine. A couple who were looking for investment in their Cave Man educational company presented their pitch to the Dragons in costume and barefoot.\n\nNoticing their lack of footwear Deborah made a confession. \"Do you know every morning when I'm at home I get up in the morning and I walk barefoot around the garden just to keep in touch with the earth,\" she admitted.\n\n\"It’s the first thing I do come rain, shine and snow,\" she continued as fellow Dragon Peter Jones looked at her incredulously. \"That’s really weird,\" he interjected.\n\nHowever, Deborah was having none of it and shot back: \"It’s not at all weird. We do not touch the world and the least I can do is connect with the earth at least once a day.\"\n\nDespite Deborah's passion for her practice, viewers seemed to be siding with Peter. Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, they aired their feelings.\n\n@StuartYoung001 commented: \"Walk round the garden barefooted, not at this time of year. #DragonsDen.\"\n\n@OliReading opined: \"#DragonsDen anecdotes of Deborah's feet.\"\n\n@ashjpitt seemed confused writing: \"Why does Deborah Meaden walk barefoot round her garden in the morning, may I ask? #DragonsDen.\"\n\nA user with the handle @I_am_KenBarlow had a cheeky investment idea of his own asking: \"#DragonsDen Hey @DeborahMeaden Would you like to invest in my invention for washing dog s*** off your bare feet?\"\n\nMeanwhile, @StVitusDance raged: \"I really can't bear hypocrite eco loon Deborah Meaden #DragonsDen.\"\n\nThe husband and wife team had explained to the Dragons: \"We are the Stone Age company, and we deliver Stone Age education and workshops to primary school children.\"\n\nThe company aims to deliver stone age education and experiences to children around the country, and they were hoing to garner investment for it.\n\nHowever, despite loving their passion for the proect, none of the Dragons felt it was worth investing in and they left with nothing.\n\nDragon's Den is on BBC One on Thursday nights at 8pm."
