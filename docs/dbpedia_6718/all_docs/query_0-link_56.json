        "text": "easyJet, ‘This is your captain speaking’\n\nPrimary school children enact gender stereotypes when imitating certain job roles, a new study has found. In an experiment conducted by easyJet and agency Taylor Herring, a group of seven-year-old children were asked to act out various occupations, with both girls and boys donning moustaches, choosing male names, and putting on a deep voice, when playing the roles of a mechanic, a builder and an airline pilot. At the end of the video, the children are introduced to a real-life female easyJet pilot. The experiment was commissioned by easyJet ahead of the launch of its 2024 Pilot Training Programme, with the aim of tackling gender stereotypes and inspiring more women to consider a career in aviation.\n\nHellmann’s, ‘No space for food waste’\n\nAround the world, one-third of all food for human consumption is wasted. This behaviour is now being replicated in video games too, where gamers are incentivised to drop food when they run out of inventory space, as it is the lowest value item.​ To address this, Hellmann’s and agency Edelman are looking to clear the galaxy of food waste, partnering with three Twitch creators to help reduce digital food waste and calling on all gamers to join the mission. The goal is to collect 1,000 kilos of intergalactic food through a ‘collect-a-thon’, bringing the gaming community together and showing a global Gen-Z audience that food is a valuable item. Meanwhile, the brand will donate the equivalent of 50,000 real-world meals to charity FareShare UK.\n\nEE, ‘The stage is yours’\n\nAhead of the EE BAFTA Film Awards, EE launched a campaign aiming to demonstrate the value of the arts in helping to develop key life skills, as research revealed that 11-16-year-olds who take part in the arts are more than twice as likely to feel confident in everyday life skills as those who don’t. The campaign included a series of online workshops and a free interactive festival of learning in London during February half term. ‘EE Learn Live’, hosted by TV presenter Stacey Dooley, featured sessions from the likes of England’s men’s football manager Gareth Southgate, Sidemen’s Tobi Brown, Top Boy lead actor Ashley Walters, and British business leader Deborah Meaden. EE also launched a TikTok competition, encouraging 13 to 17-year-olds to act out a scene for the chance to secure a role in ‘NAZ’, the biopic of boxing legend Prince Naseem Hamed.\n\nAperol, ‘Life view’\n\nAperol showcases the untold stories of the people of Venice in its latest campaign, aided by Google technology. The brand has created a platform on Google Maps Street View, which invites viewers to travel on previously uncaptured waterways using brand new 360⁰ footage. Consumers can explore Venice for themselves through the interactive map.\n\nAdobe reimagines UK landmarks as motorsport circuits\n\nAhead of the F1 season kicking off in March, Adobe has partnered with artist Rich McCor, AKA Paperboyo, to imagine what circuits would look like in famous locations across the UK and Ireland, including Primrose Hill in London and Library of Birmingham. To offer locals a preview of how this could look, Rich used Adobe Firefly’s Generative Fill tool, integrating famous race tracks into celebrated landmarks. Ketchum is behind the campaign.\n\nAlton Towers, ‘Back with a vengeance…are you ready?’\n\nThe giant, blazing eye of Alton Towers’ Nemesis creature casts a glow at one of the UK’s most notorious alien hotspots, as the Resort reveals the official launch date for Nemesis Reborn. In a campaign by Smoking Gun, drone footage and images captured at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire show the appearance of the floating seven-metre-wide eye, to coincide with roller coaster Nemesis making its return following an extensive transformation.\n\nGreatest Hits Radio and Ambassador Cruise Line, ‘Greatest Hits Radio Escape’\n\nGreatest Hits Radio has partnered with Ambassador Cruise Line to launch a one-off themed cruise to Amsterdam and Hamburg.

Tickets are on sale now and audiences can also win their way on board by listening to Ken’s show on Greatest Hits Radio.\n\n1664 Blanc x Selfridges, ‘Explorations in blue’\n\nTo mark the launch of the beer 1664 Blanc in the UK, the brand has opened a London Fashion Week activation at Selfridges.

Londoners can taste the offering while reading a limited-edition Blanc newspaper, 'Le Journal Bleu', detailing news from LFW and exclusive interviews with British Fashion Council NEWGEN designers. Creative communications agency Full Fat was behind the work.\n\nAlpro breakfast tasting menu\n\nAlpro has teamed up with Michelin-trained chef and TikTok sensation, Poppy O’Toole, to host a five-course breakfast at a one-off London event. The campaign looks to inspire consumers to be more adventurous and add simple taste twists, as almost a quarter (23 per cent) of breakfast eaters say they are much better at exploring options and trying new things for their evening meal. The event, hosted in partnership with Ketchum, has a menu consisting of breakfast inventions, from a warm almond and banana waffle, to crispy curried hash browns.\n\nUncommon, ‘The dirty protest’\n\nA new global initiative from Uncommon, with partners Clean Ocean (Rent Hav), Ocean Sewage Alliance and Renasys, revolves around a petition against sh*t in our oceans, signed with sh*t from our oceans. It is based on the insight that every year billions of litres of untreated sewage are dumped straight into the ocean, but politicians have chosen to ignore the problem. For the first time, sewage pollution is being taken to a place where those in power can’t ignore it – their desks. 'The dirty protest’ is an online petition that can be signed, with names then printed using a specially-designed ink made from real sewage. The petition is set to be delivered to the responsible politicians across the globe.\n\nRise.365, ‘Changing narratives’\n\nM&C Saatchi has joined with London youth organisation Rise.365 for an out-of-home campaign, addressing the bias that many young black men experience daily when people jump to conclusions based on damaging preconceived narratives. The work depicts these negative views as a series of book covers. Each cover features a young Rise.365 volunteer, paired with a title based upon real judgement they have unfortunately experienced.\n\nF1 Academy and Charlotte Tilbury\n\nF1 Academy has partnered with beauty brand Charlotte Tilbury in a campaign that aims to empower, inspire confidence, and encourage young women to chase their dreams. The brand looks to showcase F1 Academy’s current drivers, shining a light on their achievements and showing its audience the opportunities available to women in motorsport – both on and off track. Charlotte Tilbury has designed one of the designated F1 Academy partner liveries for the 2024 season. French driver Lola Lovinfosse will take to the wheel of the Charlotte Tilbury car.\n\nTHINK!, ‘UnXpected FM’\n\nA new digital audio ad starring BBC and Netflix stars is being launched for THINK!, the government’s road safety campaign, to encourage young drivers to watch their speed.

It showcases how vital all reports from the public are and how your information, whether you are a victim or witness, could be the final piece of the puzzle which helps police catch a serial offender.\n\nPinterest, ‘P is for performance’\n\nPinterest has launched an international campaign to promote its products for advertisers looking to convert users into buyers. Featuring mini-movies, the platform said the work demonstrates how ads on Pinterest don’t just raise awareness about brands but also drive results. The creative features two over-the-top heroines dodging dangers while discussing how modern advertisers crave a performance-based ad platform.\n\nOn your side, ‘A better fortune’\n\nThis Lunar New Year, On Your Side, the support service dedicated to East and Southeast Asians who have experienced racism or hate, highlighted the kinds of hostile behaviour those communities experience. The campaign was based on the insight that East and Southeast Asian communities have shaped UK culture, including Asian food being the UK’s number one takeaway of choice. However, these communities continue to endure hate crime. Fortune cookies illustrate how people should stand against hate as once one is opened, a message reads: \"You won’t tolerate hate\" and \"You won’t just stand by.\"\n\nSky Sports, ‘New balls please’\n\nSky promotes its new dedicated tennis channel with some 3D out-of-home executions. One outdoor activation is located in London's Vinegar Yard and shows a tennis ball fence and a 3D tennis ball stuck in the fence. This was inspired by the memory of playing tennis as a child where balls would get stuck in the fence. For the second activation, a 3D tennis ball tube was located at Pump Station, Westfield London. It showed a 3D ball bursting out of it to spotlight how tennis has arrived on Sky Sports.\n\nThe Mayor's Fund for London, 'Out of reach'\n\nThis short film by untold studios shines a light on the cost-of-living crisis and how it is affecting young people's access to food. The film follows a young woman trying to live her life while navigating soaring domestic bills, to the point where her usual groceries seem out of reach. Like a bad dream, each time she returns to the grocery shop, her items cling to the shelves and run away from her. Spoken-word poetry, performed by Rakaya Fetuga, accompanies the visuals.\n\nThe Tumeric Co., ‘We’re now on screen’\n\nHealth brand The Turmeric Co. has launched its first TV ad campaign, with support from Channel 4 and LloydBank’s ‘Black in Business’ initiative.

The light-hearted creative also features the brand’s founder and chief executive Thomas ‘Hal’ Robson-Kanu.\n\nThe Gatsby Charitable Foundation, ‘T-team’\n\nThe Gatsby Charitable Foundation has announced that dancer Oti Mabuse and farmer/TV presenter Adam Henson are the latest stars to join its ‘T-team’ line-up.

Led by a group of famous faces linked to industries with associated T-level subjects, the T-team believe that the qualification will revolutionise the job market, creating new opportunities and career pathways for young people. The T-team launch was developed and executed by Kindred as part of a wider, integrated campaign to raise awareness of T-levels.\n\nNHS, ‘The place to go’\n\nThe NHS aims to raise awareness of its extended offering that enables pharmacists to supply prescription-only medicines when clinically appropriate to free up millions of GP appointments. A film by M&C Saatchi shows people visiting their local pharmacy to help them deal with various ailments. However, when they arrive, the usual pharmacy signage has been changed to reflect its visitors' inner worlds.

The campaign by The & Partnership, which is part of the brand's 'Tomorrow begins today' series, begins with athlete Asha Philip preparing for a run as she sets \"tomorrow\" as the destination on her watch. As Philip runs past people, she inspires them to join her and they also sing along to the song playing over the film.\n\n‘Right to rehab’\n\nThe agency Pablo aims to capture people's first words and steps post-hospitalisation to stress the importance of rehabilitation. The agency worked with intensive care rehab nurse Kate Tantam to create the campaign and documented a series of \"patient firsts\" at rehab centres, hospitals and intensive care units in Plymouth to stress the importance of rehab. Billboards capture people’s first steps and a radio ad features someone’s first words since suffering their illnesses and injuries. The campaign spotlights how rehab services are not available for many people in their area and calls for more access to these services regardless of people’s postcodes.\n\nFlorida Grapefruit, ‘A taste of Florida sunshine’\n\nFlorida Grapefruit season is upon us, adding a touch of sunshine to the wet and windy British winter. To celebrate, Florida Grapefruit aims to brighten the day of commuters as it unveils a grapefruit tree in King’s Cross.\n\nMagnum, ‘Find your summer’\n\nMagnum is on a mission to encourage people to opt for ice cream during the winter months.
