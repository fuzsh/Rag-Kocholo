        "text": "Deborah Meaden is a force to be reckoned with, as anyone who has watched her grill budding entrepreneurs on BBC2’s Dragon’s Den will know.\n\nBut perhaps less well known is her childhood, which she spent in Essex with her ‘aunt’ and ‘uncle’, a couple Deborah thinks her mother paid to look after her and her sister for several years.\n\nBut Deborah has fond memories of her early years in Essex with her surrogate family.\n\nRead more: Celeb and TV news from Essex\n\nSpeaking on food writer Grace Dent’s podcast Comfort Eating, Deborah said: “I remember it with amazing fondness, you know.”\n\nAuntie Angela and Uncle Derek lived in Brightlingsea with their own four children, but Deborah emphasised that she and her sister Gail “never felt that we weren’t her children”.\n\nUncle Derek was a fisherman, tall at six foot two or three, and with a shock of white hair, while Auntie Angela was nearly a foot shorter, with dark curly ringlets.\n\nDeborah said: “I think she sparked a lot of the things I love today”, including gardening, which has become a lifelong passion for the businesswoman.\n\n“When I think about why I love gardens, well she gave us a little patch of the garden then we planted it up and we learned about all the flowers and all that.\n\n“I still remember the flower names today.”\n\nUncle Derek would take all of the children winkling on the beach, where they would extract periwinkles from their shells.\n\nThey would then all fight over who got to sit on Uncle Derek’s shoulders.\n\nDeborah and Gail moved in to live with Derek and Angela when Deborah was around three or four, and stayed until Deborah was sent to boarding school in Salisbury aged seven.\n\nDeborah realised that during those three or four years in Brightlingsea, she barely saw her mum Sonia, who was working very long hours at Butlins in Clacton.\n\nSonia had divorced Deborah and Gail’s father when the girls were both very young, and spent several years struggling to make ends meet.\n\nDeborah told Grace: “She was working until 10 or 11 oclock at night, so she didn’t want to come and see us, upset us and then go away again.”\n\nBut Deborah says she learned some valuable lessons from her mother.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, she said: “The overriding thing I learned from my mother was self-resilience.\n\n“She had a pretty tough time but showed no self-pity whatsoever. She still has no time for it.\n\n“We grew up understanding that if you want a good life, you have to make it for yourself. That's it.\n\n“Don't expect anything from anybody, work hard, put your head down, be good at what you do and good stuff will happen.”\n\nSo it’s no wonder that the 62-year-old has become such a successful businesswoman over the years.\n\nLaunching her first business aged 19, Deborah then joined the family business, before moving to Weststar Holidays in 1992.\n\nIn 1999 she led a management buyout and acquired the majority shareholding - eight years later when she sold the company, her stake was valued at around £19 million.\n\nShe joined Dragon’s Den in its third series in 2006, and continues to invest in entrepreneurs through each series.\n\n“It lights me up”, Deborah tells Grace, “business lights me up.”"
