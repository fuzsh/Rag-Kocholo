        "text": "Since the age of 19, Deborah Meaden has been a successful businesswoman, and one man has been by her side the whole time as she has constructed a vast empire.\n\nSomerset-born Deborah, 62, is one of the most recognisable faces behind Dragon's Den, but she is not actually an original dragon because she joined at the start of series three.\n\nShortly after leaving college at 19, Deborah rocketed to success as she launched a glass and ceramics business, selling to stores including Harvey Nicholls, but unfortunately her hard work crumbled after just 18 months, according to The Mirror.\n\nRead more: A Place in the Sun's Craig Rowe reveals his favourite Bristol locations\n\nDetermined Deborah took this downfall on the chin, and took over a franchise for Italian clothing company, Stefanel, before joining the family business, Weststar Holidays.\n\nHow did they meet?\n\nBack in the summer of 1985, when the future dragon was 26 years old, she met her future husband, Paul Farmer, who was completing summer work at the business during his university break.\n\nDeborah, who eventually became Managing Director of the company, had a good relationship with Paul, but the pair split due to the fact that she did not want children. The couple parted ways, but things took a turn for the better when Deborah returned from a trip to Venezuela.\n\nWhen she returned to London, the pair rekindled their romance and ended up marrying in 1993.\n\nDeborah and Paul do not have any children together, but they do have many pets to share their renovated 10-bedroom Somerset home with, including cats, chickens, horses and sheep.\n\nAccording to Deborah, husband Paul is in charge of “domestic chores” at home and is a “fantastic cook”.\n\n“I hate cleaning so as a student I used to work in a bar at night in order to pay someone to clean my flat,” she said in an interview with the Telegraph in 2011, cheekily adding: “I’ve never told anyone that.\n\n\"I still don’t do any domestic chores; my husband Paul is in charge. It sounds terrible, doesn’t it?”\n\nA romantic gesture goes a long way\n\nDeborah appeared in Strictly Come Dancing in 2013, and has recently revealed the amazing romantic gesture Paul executed whilst she was on the show.\n\nSpeaking on The Graham Norton Show last year, the businesswoman said: \"When I was doing Strictly, Paul could see how much I loved dancing. I loved doing Strictly.\n\n“He secretly took dancing lessons. I’d been so mean to him for 30 years, so horrible to him, and then he goes and does that.\n\n“As a result of that he grew to love dancing, we both love dancing, we went off to Buenos Aires to learn Argentine Tango and now we both dance for four hours a week.\n\n“It’s a lovely thing because we all have busy lives. Just being face to face with your partner for four hours of your week.”\n\nHow much are they worth?\n\nAccording to Spear's magazine, Deborah's net worth is around £40million, while Paul is estimated to be worth around half of that figure.\n\nIn 1999, Deborah acquired the major shareholding in a management buyout, later selling the company for £33m whilst retaining a 23% stake which she then sold in 2007 when Weststar was bought for £83m.\n\nThe couple used that money to buy their 10-bedroom mansion in Somerset, where Deborah was born, which they have renovated using period accurate materials.\n\nThe two storey building was built in stages between 1565 and 1765, when it was bequeathed to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham by Sir William Pynsent, 2nd Baronet, who did not want the house to go to Lord North.\n\nThe Grade II listed building also includes four bathrooms, many reception rooms and offices, a huge kitchen and living room.\n\nSpeaking at the time they bought the property, Deborah said: \"We have done it up in an ethical way, restoring whatever we can using traditional materials.\n\n\"That has cost us at least twice as much as it needed to. I always say, we were lucky to find our home, and it was lucky to find us.\n\n\"I do not know anybody in their right mind who would have spent the money on it we have – far more than we will ever get back.\"\n\nDragon's Den returns to our screens on Thursday, February 3, at 9pm."
