        "text": "Dragons’ Den returns to screens on Thursday, January 4 and one of its stars, Deborah Meaden, has teased what’s to come in a post on Instagram. The 64-year-old businesswoman also says she was “way out of my comfort zone” after appearing on Taskmaster’s New Year special, which you can read more about here.\n\nSharing a photo of herself alongside her other Dragons - Steven Bartlett, Peter Jones, Touker Suleyman and Sara Davies - Deborah captioned the photo: “After a short interlude way out of my comfort zone #taskmaster I am back with fellow Dragons in the Den. New series starts Thursday 8pm @peterjonescbe @toukersuleyman @saradaviescc @steven.”\n\nAfter posting the photo several people commented saying they were excited for the new series, which is the 21st. The series first debuted in January, 2005, and has been a huge success.\n\nREAD MORE: BBC Winterwatch's Iolo Williams says he had no heart attack warning signs as he shares health update\n\nREAD MORE: Stacey Solomon fans rush to defend her after ‘rude’ reaction to her holiday photo\n\nOne person commented: “I'm so excited for Season 21, Debbie.” A second echoed: “We’ll be watching! It’s our favourite programme on television.”\n\nA third wrote: “Deborah you are my fav dragon! You're like an aunt i've never met! Looking forward to this.” And a fourth shared: “Can't wait to watch this new series. I love it.”\n\nDeborah previously ran a multimillion-pound family holiday business, Weystar Holidays, before completing a management buyout. She has appeared on Dragons’ Den since its third series.\n\nThe TV star, who has also featured on Strictly Come Dancing, met her husband, Paul Farmer, in the summer of 1985 while he worked at Weststar during his university break. They separated but after she took a trip to Venezuela, she returned to London and they married in 1993.\n\nThe couple have no children and live in a period property near Langport in Somerset with numerous animals. Deborah bought the property in 2006 after selling her holiday business for £33 million - read more about that here. Since then, the house has undergone extensive renovations using period accurate materials."
