        "text": "Dragon’s Den investor and host of The Big Green Money show, Deborah Meaden, is to host Fully Charged LIVE UK South at Farnborough International Exhibition & Conference Centre.\n\nTaking place from 28-30 April, the event will for the first time open with ‘electric fireside chats’ between Fully Charged founder Robert Llewellyn and well-known thought-leaders in sustainability.\n\nFully Charged LIVE was born out of a YouTube channel founded by actor, author and presenter Llewellyn. The event is one of the fastest evolving exhibitions in the world with six shows planned for 2023 including Australia, Canada, Europe, the UK and the US.\n\nFully Charged LIVE North UK debuts at the Yorkshire Event Centre on 19-21 May and will have its own programme of content with many of the same attractions.\n\nLlewellyn said: “The growth of Fully Charged LIVE in the UK and overseas is a source of constant surprise. The flagship show in Farnborough is set to be much bigger again, and I am incredibly excited that Deborah Meaden, as well as our presenters and many other high profile friends of Fully Charged are going to join us on stage. Above all though it is really rewarding to see our audience in person, and now with the Farnborough and Harrogate shows, we can see more than ever before.”\n\nNew for 2023, ‘Zero Carbon Kitchen’ is an educational live demo area where experts can cook plant-based recipes with all-electric appliances, powered by an EV with vehicle-to-load capability.\n\nLive cookery demonstrations and tastings will take place on all three days of each show and plant-based specialists BOSH! will be the headline chefs.\n\nJoining the cooking demonstration line-up will be plant-based chef, nutrition coach and recipe developer Lisa Marley who has a monthly column in Vegan Food and Living magazine and is a guest expert every Sunday on BBC Radio.\n\nDan Caesar, CEO of the Fully Charged SHOW said: “The exciting introduction of Zero Carbon Kitchen is in response to enormous demand from our audience in flexitarianism, vegetarianism and veganism as a part of a more sustainable lifestyle. Alongside our investment in other visitor attractions and big-name participants, Zero Carbon Kitchen further underscores our commitment to be the best show in the energy, transport and sustainability sectors worldwide.”\n\nFurther ‘electric fireside chat’ guests are to be announced in due course."
