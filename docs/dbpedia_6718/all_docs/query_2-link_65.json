        "text": "Our best work happens when we're fuelled by passion, and our worst when we feel forced and micro-managed. Managers who invest in their employees' personal growth create not just a happy team but a committed and productive one. • This is the key to building your brand from the inside out. • This is how you make employees look forward to each day. • This is how you help them find meaning in their roles. It’s simple – treat people like individuals, not just resources, and watch the passion and energy flow. Give it a go.\n\nDear Business Leaders, Stop merely asking your employees \"How are you?\" when it comes to their mental health. Instead, focus on taking meaningful actions to improve their well-being and experience at work. Here's how: 1. Look for opportunities to reduce stress and make day-to-day tasks more manageable for your team 2. Equip employees with the necessary tools and resources to ensure they feel happy and fulfilled in their roles 3. Cultivate a supportive environment that motivates employees to bring their best selves to work The true measure of a business lies not just in financial metrics, but in how it treats its people. Sincerely, Tej\n\nIt may at times feel like you’ve come to the end of the road. Like you’ve got no gas left in the tank. That you can’t see where to go from here. I assure you, there’s always a way. Look back at the things you’ve achieved and the hurdles you’ve jumped. You’ve come this far... Let that serve as motivation for your future.\n\nThe best time to take action is today. You can’t change the past, and you can’t guarantee that conditions will be the same tomorrow. If you are ready today, it’s time to take the leap. Excellent visualisation from Jeff Kortenbosch\n\nYour comfort zone is comfortable because it’s static, familiar and safe. It’s something we all need from time to time, but ZERO progress will happen from within that zone. To move forward, you need to step outside. Image credit: Visualsbymelodie on Instagram\n\nProgress is almost never linear. When you’re in the depths of it, it can be easy to feel like you’re going nowhere – but with each step, you’re learning. You’re growing. Every single setback is the setup for a comeback, and every twist in the road teaches something new. This image from Liz Fosslien is a great example of how sometimes, all it takes is a little perspective to see your journey in an entirely different light. You’ve got this!\n\n10 Ways to Support a Friend's Small Business: 1. Like their content on social media 2. Share their posts with your network 3. Write a positive review 4. Attend their events 5.
