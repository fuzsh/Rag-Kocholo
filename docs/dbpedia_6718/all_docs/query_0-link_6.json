        "text": "Deborah Meaden, the terrifying Queen Komodo of the Dragons’ Den, is smiling and twinkling (yes, really, get over it) at me from the plump depths of an extravagantly upholstered boutique hotel armchair.\n\nWe are chatting about her fondness for cats and dogs, the menagerie of poultry and retired racehorses at her model farm in Somerset and how, before her home-reared Gloucester Old Spots were repackaged as Sunday lunch, she visited a number of slaughter houses, before carefully selecting the right one, rather as you or I might choose a nursing home for our ageing mothers.\n\nIt’s all about the detail with blonde multi-millionaire Meaden, 52, who is prettier and more feminine than she appears on screen. Although she’s not given to public displays of emotion, she will own up to a certain sentimentality when it comes to pets, if not people. Livestock must be treated with respect and kindness, especially at the end, “because they are completely dependent on us”.\n\nThe same might be said of the vulnerable entrepreneurs who dare to enter The Den – entirely at the mercy of the Dragons’ goodwill to finance their cardboard beach furniture empire. Some have been known to shed a tear. “We don’t make people cry,” she says, firmly. “If they cry it’s for their own reasons, nothing to do with us.”\n\nSo when she snarls “You’re wasting my time, I’m Out,” and gives quaking Heath Robinsons one of her blank-eyed Death Star looks after a good old mauling, that’s just play-fighting, is it? “I don’t think we’ve ever eaten any of the entrepreneurs.” She pauses a beat. “Yet.”\n\nReally, Deborah, I find myself shrieking, you aren’t anything like as scary in real life as you are on the telly! “That’s because you’re not asking me for a quarter of a million pounds,” she responds, swift and lethal as a double dip. “If you were, I’d be in Business Mode, which is altogether different because serious amounts of money require serious thought. Go on, ask me for £250,000.”\n\nAnd so I do, making a valiant stab at Business Mode, shot through with potentially suicidal mateyness. Well, Deborah, my brainwave, Deborah, is, um, shoes that convert from heels to flatties? Which, Deborah, means women will uh, no longer have to haul extra pairs of ballet pumps about in their handbags. So, can I have some of your money please?\n\n“That’s a brilliant idea!” she says, opening her handbag to reveal – yes! – caramel-coloured designer loafers for moments when a girl just has to abandon her Bentley-to-boardroom footwear and run for the bus.\n\nAnd so we head to the bar to toast the launch of my fabulous Feels (flattie-heels, get it?) with dry martinis and a life-changing cheque.\n\nExcept we don’t. Back in the real world, she whips off one vertiginous Louboutin, runs her hands over its sleek architectural lines and says: “Unfortunately it’s impossible – these shoes aren’t just flats with heels, they are constructed entirely differently.”\n\nAs, indeed, are successful entrepreneurs. By Ed Miliband’s crowd-pleasing, if hazy definition of “good businesses” as those with the “right values” that create jobs, invest in companies and train their staff, Meaden ought to be in the clear. Over six series of Dragons’ Den, she has invested £1.6 million in 26 enterprises. But sometimes it’s not easy being one of the good guys, if her recent damning observations about Britain’s feckless, workshy youth are anything to go by.\n\nLast year she invested in Fox Brothers, a luxury woollen cloth manufacturer, based near her Somerset home. In an attempt to bring fresh blood into its “fantastic, but ageing” workforce, she advertised for teenage apprentices. The silence was deafening. “Young people just don’t think manual labour is cool,” she says with exasperation. “They want to chase wealth and celebrity and have no idea of the satisfaction and pride that comes with creating something, like a beautiful length of cloth that ends up being made into a Savile Row suit.”\n\nThe blame, she says, lies with an education system too geared towards academia, where there are no opportunities for young people to discover they excel with their hands. “Young people lack confidence and that comes across as being workshy. They have no idea how to seize or even identify an opportunity.”\n\nThat situation is exacerbated by the loss of Britain’s manufacturing base. “We’ve made ourselves very vulnerable,” she says. “I’m not saying we should manufacture everything – leave the red plastic buttons to China – but the rest of the world recognises that Handmade in Britain is a mark of quality, even if we don’t.”\n\nOn Dragons’ Den she has put money into waste management and recycling companies, internet ventures and Steri-Spray, a shower head that prevents legionnaires’ disease which is being trialled by the NHS and will, she predicts, go global.\n\nFar from being piqued by the arrival of a new Dragon, trucking millionaire Hilary Devey (she of the Dynasty shoulder pads), who has replaced James Caan for the ninth series of the BBC Two ratings-winner, she says it has re-energised the show – and she’s not the type to dissemble. She loves the programme, the format, the chance to sink – sorry, get – her teeth into fresh mea- challenges – and is generally having a blast.\n\nOff-screen, Meaden has invested in everything from ceramics to the UK’s first Stefanel Italian fashion franchise, her family’s amusement arcade business (she bought her parents out in 1999) and a holiday park.\n\nShe showed commercial nous from an early age; when she was seven she set up a flower stall – in a neighbour’s drive, as she realised the location was better. By 11 she was grafting away at summer jobs to buy a pony and pay for its livery, and at 16 she left school in Essex to study business at Brighton Technical College. “I hate cleaning so as a student I used to work in a bar at night in order to pay someone to clean my flat. I’ve never told anyone that. I still don’t do any domestic chores; my husband Paul is in charge. It sounds terrible, doesn’t it?”\n\nNo, Deborah, it sounds like A Dream Come True. While she busies herself in London in the week, staying in their Primrose Hill pied-à-terre and eating out every night, Paul househusbands. They have been together since the mid-80s and married 18 years ago. Children would have been lovely, but never happened. Instead, they provide board and lodgings for four-legged waifs and strays; when a job lot of abandoned micropigs came their way a fortnight ago, Meaden ordered her secretary to clear her diary and spent the day rehoming them.\n\n“We kept two, but last Saturday one gave birth to nine piglets, so we’ll have to start all over again,” she beams. “I am a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde figure; in London I’m in smart clothes, I’m competitive and utterly focused. As soon as I arrive in Somerset, I have a bath to wash all that away, dress in jodhpurs and sloppy jumpers and visit the animals.”\n\nHers may be the perfect work-life balance, but it’s hard not to plead with her to put down the piglets, pop into a skirt suit and hive off another half-day to put the country bang to rights, perhaps by sorting out the 50 per cent tax debacle. “No entrepreneur likes the idea of giving half the money they earn to the Government, but emotionally most people are against the change. It simply doesn’t feel right that the very wealthy don’t have to pay what they can afford,” she says, more cautious than I would have expected.\n\n“We need facts that prove the 50 per cent rate is having an impact on the economy, in which case we should, of course, change it. The decision has to be a fact-based one rather than political, to get people on side.”\n\nBy her own admission, her unilateralist style is unsuited to politics (although maybe Enlightened Despotism?), which is a shame, as we could do with a few more solution-led, move-on, move-on sort of characters at the national helm.\n\nMeanwhile Meaden continues to look forward and happily points out that she isn’t “the regretting sort”. Well, watch this space, because once I call up that nice Theo Paphitis and tell him about my revolutionary Fabulous Feels, she might just discover that, actually, she is."
