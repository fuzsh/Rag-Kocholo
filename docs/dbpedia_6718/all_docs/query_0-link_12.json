After that, she set up one of the first franchises in Britain of Italian group Stefanel.\n\nIn 1999, with several successful businesses in the leisure and retail sector under her belt, she became managing director of her family's holiday park business, Weststar Holidays, though she recently sold it for more than Â£80m.\n\nMeaden, 47, lives with her husband Paul in Somerset."
