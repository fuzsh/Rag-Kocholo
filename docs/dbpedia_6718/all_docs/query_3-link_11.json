        "text": "Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden has voiced her disapproval of the proposed 700-plot allotment site in Somerset Now police have halted work on the project.\n\nThe businesswoman, who lives in Somerset, took to social media to express her concerns after visiting the Roots site in Abbots Leigh, where a large field at the gateway to Leigh Woods is being transformed into an extensive allotment area.\n\nIn her statement, she said: \"Britain is severely Nature depleted and we should all be worried because if nature fails, so do we. We have lost 97 per cent of our meadows over the last 100 years, and the creatures that depend on them are at huge risk.\"\n\nRead More - 'Hundreds' fall ill with stomach bug in West Country town outbreak\n\nRead More - £120,000 a year private school rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted\n\nShe further added: \"This makes every meadow, however small hugely important and we can't go on destroying them little by little. Whilst the provision of allotments is a great idea it needs to be in appropriate areas, enhancing, not depleting the local nature.\"\n\nThe contentious development has been under scrutiny for nearly two years, with North Somerset Council giving the green light for the transformation of the field last year. However, this week saw Avon and Somerset Police issue a stop order on the work at the 25-acre site.\n\nConfirming their intervention, the police stated: \"Following reports nesting skylarks were being disturbed, officers from our rural crime and neighbourhood policing teams visited land in Abbots Leigh.\", reports Bristol Live.\n\n\"They were joined by an independent ecologist who, while conducting a survey, found evidence of nesting skylarks. Destruction or the damaging of these nests would be contrary to Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. A notice to stop works was issued on Monday, 13 May, requiring construction to stop in a section of the site until 31 August.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the group Save Abbots Leigh Green Belt said: \"The meadow is a haven for wildlife, including rare bats, butterflies and nesting skylarks. It's enjoyed by countless walkers using the popular Monarch's Way footpath.\"\n\n\"Locals were quick to alert the company about the endangered bats recorded in the area, badger setts on the hedge line, and skylarks that nest in the meadow every year. Roots chose to ignore the ecological concerns raised by the locals and ploughed on regardless.\"\n\n\"The only consistent response from Roots, was to mount a social media campaign to paint the village residents as 'NIMBYs' telling their followers that they are being targeted by a \"hate group\", a reference to a community Facebook page which posted regular images and videos of the threatened meadow and skylarks.\"\n\nRoots had previously stated: \"We have already started work which will increase biodiversity in linear habitats by as much as 100%. This includes planting fruit trees and native woodlands, reinstating more than 400 metres of natural hedges and further plans to establish ponds, create insect habitats and increase species diversity in wildflower areas. We want to create more than allotment spaces; we are calling for a growing revolution in the UK and want to provide people with the means to access it.\""
