        "text": "If you're a Hollywood movie star or a staple of British television, then there are times when getting away from it is a great idea.\n\nWhat better place to do this than in the rural beauty of Somerset and it seems to be catching on among the ranks of celebrities.\n\nWe taken a look at some of the best known people with a base in the county. Maybe you'll see them at your local shop next time you pop out for a pint of milk.\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nHollywood action movie star may have found the pace of his films quite pacy, which is why the star of Face/Off and Con Air probably wanted a quiet, relaxing surround for his home.\n\nWhile he might spend a lot of time in the United States, he apparently has a country retreat near Baltonsborough.\n\nHermione Norris\n\nCold Feet star Hermione Norris is often seen out and about around Yeovil and apparently lives in Odcombe, a village not far from the town.\n\nDeborah Meaden\n\nDragons' Den star Deborah Meaden has celebrated more than 10 years on the show, which has seen her put her money where her mouth is with a number of business investments.\n\nIn her down time, she can be found at her home on the Somerset Levels, near Langport.\n\nSean Bean\n\nOne of the original Game of Thrones stars, Sean Bean has taken to life in the West Country so much that earlier this year, he married Ashley Moore at Axnoller Farm near Beaminster. It is thought he recently bought a home near Wincanton.\n\nPeter Andre\n\nReality TV star Peter Andre cemented his Somerset links when he married Taunton doctor, Emily MacDonagh. The couple and their family have a house a few miles outside the county town, which is why the pop star is occasionally spotted shopping in Taunton.\n\nVal Stones\n\nThe Great British Bake Off elevated Somerton's Val Stones to national treasure status, as viewers of the baking show took her to their hearts.\n\nShe's still making cakes but is currently walking the Great Wall of China in aid of NSPCC.\n\nLynne Franks\n\nThe inspiration for Jennifer Saunders' characters in Absolutely Fabulous, Lynne Franks is a new addition to Somerset, after she took over the former Red Lion in Wincanton, for her new business venture.\n\nKevin McCloud\n\nThe presenter of Channel 4's Grand Designs has succumbed to the charms of Bruton, which has become the place in Somerset to find a celebrity resident.\n\nThe British designer has a few abodes across the UK, with his newest home in the Peak District costing a cool million.\n\nRhys Ifan\n\nAnother to have apparently fallen for all that Bruton has to offer, the Notting Hill film star has got his own little piece of Somerset to return to when he fancies a break from making movies.\n\nMartin Roberts\n\nThe Homes Under the Hammer star has lived in a village just outside Bath for the past 19 years. He had a resurgence in the public eye after making a memorable trip to the Australian jungle for ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\n\nValerie Singleton\n\nJust over the border, former Blue Peter presenter Valerie Singleton has been a resident of Corton Denham, near Sherborne, for many years. She was awarded an OBE for services to children's television in 1994."
