What help is all this to anyone starting a business?\n\n“Well,” says Deborah Meaden, refusing to be riled, “it shows there are things you should know — like what your turnover is.”\n\nOh, please. With the show now in its 10th series, you would think entrants might have worked that out. Meaden, 53, who has starred since 2006 as Grumpy Dragon"
