        "text": "The Dragons don't actually live in the Den - they have families to go home to once the pitches have stopped.\n\nFrom dashing husbands to stunning wives, the business tycoons have loved ones to share their immense wealth with when they leave the office.\n\nHowever, the course of true love hasn't always run smoothly for most of the Dragons and they have endured massive breakups.\n\nOne of them lost his home, his car and his marriage when his business started to crumble, while another was forced to pay out a staggering £345 million amid a messy divorce.\n\nBut some have stayed with their childhood sweethearts and been happily married for many years.\n\nHere is a look at the Dragons' love lives.\n\nPeter Jones\n\nThe only original Dragon remaining in the Den is Peter Jones.\n\nThe mammoth business tycoon, who was just 16-years-old when he set up his first business, has an estimated net worth of £500million.\n\nWhen he joined the show way back in 2005, the Jessops money-maker was married to his first wife Caroline, who he married at the age of 21.\n\nThe couple had two kids together, Annabel and William, but they divorced in 2008 in messy circumstances.\n\nPeter lost almost everything when one of his clients went bust, including his house, car and marriage - then had to move back in with his parents.\n\nBut Peter rebuilt his business empire before meeting current partner Tara Capp, who is a successful interior designer in her own right.\n\nThe long-term couple are not married but have three teenage daughters, Natalie, Isabella and Tallulah.\n\nPeter helped Tara co-found her own lifestyle e-commerce company, Truly, which sells affordable products from home decor to baby wear.\n\nBack in 2018, Peter was reportedly furious when close friend Holly Willoughby backtracked on their huge £11million deal to launch Tara’s business.\n\nThe two families have been friends for more than 10 years, but Holly’s last-minute decision was seemingly a major blow to Peter and Tara.\n\nIn a shock turn of events the This Morning presenter blew off the money-making deal to focus on her ITV and Marks and Spencer contracts worth up to £1.5 million.\n\nDeborah Meaden\n\nDeborah Meaden has been terrifying investors since the third series - but there’s one man who always puts a smile on her face.\n\nThe successful entrepreneur, 62, launched a glass and ceramics business straight out of college at the age of 19.\n\nUndeterred by its failure, Deborah took on a franchise for Italian clothing company Stefanel before joining the family business, Weststar Holidays.\n\nWhile she was in her early 20s back in the summer of 1985, Deborah met her future husband Paul.\n\nHe was actually working at Weststar during his university break.\n\nSadly the couple split up due to the fact she didn’t want to start a family, but things changed when Deborah returned from a trip to Venezuela.\n\nWhen she came back to London they got back together and got married in 1993.\n\nDeborah and Paul do not have any children but they do have many pets in their 10-bed Somerset home.\n\nThey own six horses, five sheep, six ducks, three geese, 10 chickens, three pigs, three dogs and two cats.\n\nAt home, Paul is in charge of “domestic chores” and is a “fantastic cook”.\n\n“I hate cleaning so as a student I used to work in a bar at night in order to pay someone to clean my flat. I’ve never told anyone that,” she said in an interview with the Telegraph in 2011.\n\n\"I still don’t do any domestic chores; my husband Paul is in charge. It sounds terrible, doesn’t it?”\n\nDuncan Bannatyne\n\nScottish business sensation Duncan Bannatyne started off with an ice-cream van before building up his famous chain of health clubs,\n\nOne of the original Dragons, Duncan announced he was leaving his chair in 2014 after 12 series due to other business commitments.\n\nDuncan has been married three times and has six children from his first two.\n\nHe wed first wife Gail Brodie in 1983, who he shares daughter Hollie, Abigail, Jennifer and Eve with, but they divorced in 1994.\n\nThen he tied the knot with Joanne McCue in 2006, mother of his kids Emily and Thomas, but their marriage ended six years later.\n\nDuncan said he received a text from Joanne while filming the ninth series of Dragons Den stating she had field for divorce in the High Court.\n\n“So when I stood in that car park, with my fellow Dragons’ Den judge Peter Jones, shaking with disbelief at Joanne’s text message, I knew it was going to be expensive,” he told the Daily Mail in 2013.\n\nHe admitted he regretted not signing a pre-nup as the divorce cost him £345million but he was truly in love.\n\nHis eldest daughter also has two kids, Ava and Austin, making Duncan a granddad.\n\nNow the 71-year-old is married to Nigora Whitehorn, who is 31 years younger than the former Dragon.\n\nDuncan fell madly in love with her the first time they met when he visited the Harley Street dental surgery she was working in.\n\nHe proposed after two years together and they married in Portugal the following year.\n\nNigora has stated that age doesn’t matter to her and that Duncan actually has more energy.\n\nSpeaking to OK! in January 2020, the couple revealed they are open to starting their own family together.\n\nDuncan explained: \"I don’t think it’s going to happen. We tried, but I don’t think we are going to have children.\n\n“We’re not trying to prevent it happening, so if it did, great, but I don’t think it is going to.”\n\nNigora added: \"If it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen, but we are not doing anything about it, like IVF, and we are not going to stress about it.”\n\nTej Lalvani\n\nFirst walking into the Den for series 15, Tej Lalvani has already invested nearly £2million.\n\nThe Vitabiotics CEO, who has grown his scientist father’s business into the largest vitamin company in the UK, celebrated his 10th wedding anniversary this year.\n\nThe 46-year-old ’Prince of Vitamins’ tied the knot with wife Tara Ruby in a Sikh ceremony in London in August 2011.\n\nThe rich businessman splashed out the cash on a lavish pre-wedding reception and sit-down dinner at the Natural History Museum.\n\nFor their honeymoon, the newlyweds flew around the world for week-long stays in Malaysia, Japan and the Maldives.\n\nThe couple, who don’t have any children together, are also business partners and run a successful London-based property investment company together.\n\nWhile Tej has a stunning wife, he also comes from a good looking family himself, as is mother is a former Miss India and a Miss World runner-up.\n\nSara Davies\n\nThe newest Dragon in the Den, Sara Davies became the youngest ever when she joined in 2019 at the age of just 35.\n\nBefore founding her crafting company from her bedroom at university, Sara found love with her childhood sweetheart.\n\nShe has been married to husband Simon since 2007 and they have two children together named Oliver and Charlie.\n\nShe actually credits Simon with helping co-found her thriving company, Crafter’s Companion, which now turns over £34million a year.\n\nThe couple, who live in Teeside, don’t always agree on how to raise their kids.\n\n\"My husband Simon wants to give the kids the things we could not have - but I want them to have the experiences we did have,” she said on Loose Women.\n\nWhile her children will have to work for their pocket money, they receive more than she did because of their impressive negotiating skills.\n\n“My six-year-old son will help out at the shop, which my sister owns, and she’ll have him doing the same thing that I was back then,” she told The Mirror.\n\n\"With a bit of inflation he will get a couple of quid. My boys can negotiate much better than I can.”\n\nTouker Suleyman\n\nTouker Suleyman brought his 40 years' retail and manufacturing experience into the Den back in 2015.\n\nThe Cyprus-born Londoner has supplied clothes to some of the biggest names of the British high street.\n\nNot much is known about the fashion business mogul’s persona life as he is a very private man.\n\nThe 67-year-old is not married but does have two daughters, Tashia and Taya.\n\nHe regularly posts snaps of his girls on Instagram - who are all grown up now and aged 22 and 18."
