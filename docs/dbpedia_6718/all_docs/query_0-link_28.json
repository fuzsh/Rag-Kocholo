        "text": "Deborah Meaden discusses 'democratic' second Brexit vote\n\nThe businesswoman, who supports Remaining in the European Union, claimed a no deal Brexit would be “catastrophic” before claiming “very few people” voted for the “mess” Britain is in in its negotiations.\n\nSpeaking on ITV’s Loose Women, Ms Meaden said: “I respect democracy and I value a democracy beyond anything. So I actually started out saying ‘actually it was a vote and we voted to Leave so that’s it’.”\n\nBut she added: “This time has gone on and we’ve moved from sort of forecast to fact.\n\n“We are now staring at what could possibly be a no deal, which would be catastrophic.”\n\nWe are now staring at what could possibly be a no deal, which would be catastrophic\n\nDeborah Meaden\n\nWhen asked if she wants a second Brexit referendum, Ms Meaden said: “Not necessarily a referendum. I think we have all got referendum fatigue.\n\n“But I do think that there are very few people who have voted for the confusion and mess that we are in at the moment.\n\n“Therefore, I think that it is democratic to offer a chance to understand once we know what Leave actually means.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Brexit-supporting minister Chris Grayling admitted he would be willing to maintain alignment with EU rules to avoid disruption to British manufacturing as he said the Government is \"re-doubling\" efforts to avoid a no deal Brexit.\n\nChris Grayling: Nobody wants a no deal Brexit\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nMr Grayling, who campaigned to Leave during the 2016 referendum, argued a compromise could ensure Britain secures a \"sensible relationship\" with the European Union in the future.\n\nSpeaking to the Today programme, the Brexiteer minister said: \"I didn’t campaign to leave the EU in order to have a different specification of motorcar in France and in the UK and so I can accept having alignment on the technical specifications of manufactured goods, if that is the price we need to pay in order to have a sensible relationship in the future.\n\n\"None of us wants no-deal, none of us are working towards that. I think it would be damaging for both this country and the European Union.\"\n\nMr Grayling also outlined his support for the latest Brexit blueprint put forward by Theresa May as it would \"offer us a way to reach an agreement with the European Union.\""
