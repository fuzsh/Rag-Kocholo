Her dismissive catchphrase on the programme is “You’re wasting my time”, accompanied by a fish-eyed stare. Crushed, the hapless inventors of cardboard beach furniture and pet-burial kits slink off, aware that there is no greater crime.\n\nSo when I arrive to find that Meaden has been twidding her fingers for an hour already, I am reduced to a gibbering wreck. Fortunately, the mistake is her secretary’s rather than mine. “She’s wonderful,” Meaden says, leaping to her defence, “but she’s got four children and they’re just about to go on holiday.” Clearly there is more to Meaden than the twodimensional Cruella De Vil on screen.\n\nWe meet in the Roundhouse, Camden"
