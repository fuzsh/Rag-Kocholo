        "text": "In an exciting new partnership for 2024 – NESCAFÉ® B2B by Nestlé Professional – has given small and medium businesses, a unique opportunity to win bespoke insight and advice from serial entrepreneur and business guru Deborah Meaden.\n\nOpen to SMEs, across all industries, the new business programme, by NESCAFÉ, Let’s Partner up for Good, has seen seven lucky businesses win a seat at the table to discuss their business challenges relating to their sustainability journey, workplace wellbeing and business growth with Deborah Meaden and NESCAFÉ® B2B business experts.\n\nThe winners had the opportunity to ask them face-to-face advice at a live filming studio with audience in Soho, London. The business advice from the live event will be shared with SME community in a series of 3 short films and written collaterals.\n\nKatya Simmons, managing director at NESCAFÉ by Nestlé Professional said: “We know that there are common themes and challenges amongst entrepreneurs. By working with real businesses, we’ve been able to understand some of those challenges first-hand and offer thoughts, tools and advice that we hope will benefit the winners and through the campaign, reach the wider SME community. If as a NESCAFÉ team, we can support and make a positive impact, this means the world to us.”\n\nAiring from September 2024 onwards at Nestlé Professional’s website and YouTube channel – business owners are encouraged to sign-up on the website now to receive updates and announcements on the film live dates."
