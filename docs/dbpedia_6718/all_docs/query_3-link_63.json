        "text": "A total of 1 whole person asked me what I gained from at the JWE so I decided to tell everyone😁 (Shoutout to Ben Brachfeld for making this post possible😉) Before you can think about scaling your business you need to take it from a REACTIVE state to a PROACTIVE state. Mind blowing stuff. A while back I was talking to a fellow owner who was struggling with taking their business to the next level. She was investing so much into growth but wasn’t seeing any results. In fact the efforts seemed to be having the opposite effect! It was frustrating and perplexing to watch so much time, effort and money go eighth down the drain. I didn’t really know what to make of it. Until Talia Mashiach, an incredibly accomplished business women with whom I had the honor of learning from, shared this nugget and it put everything into perspective. You can’t grow if you’re still catching up with yourself. Many times you just need to be honest with yourself about how wide the gap is between what you want and what you need. You might just find that right now is actually time to stabilize and not add more in to the mess. It was a great lesson to learn and I can’t express enough how much I appreciated gaining that clarity! —————— Hi, I’m Hindy Raichik:) I’m the COO of Motif Studio where we specialize in custom brands and websites for the discerning client. If you’re ready to scale your business then get on our roster for July by connecting with us through our website!\n\nWe are back to our #WomenOwnedWednesday! This week, we’re featuring Titi Adebiyi - T’ary Style Boutique. @t.arystyles Tell us about your business. T’Ary Style Boutique is an online fashion store; we sell classy, quality, unique and timeless clothes at affordable prices. We offer same-day pick up and delivery for DFW residents and we also ship across the states. What is one thing you've learned as a woman-owned business? I’ve learned, as a woman-owned business, the importance of building a strong and supportive community. As an online boutique owner in an industry where competition is fierce and challenges can be numerous, I have discovered and benefited greatly from the incredible power of connecting with other women entrepreneurs, customers and like-minded individuals. This sense of community has provided me with valuable insights, mentorship, and motivation to keep pushing forward. What is one tip you'd give to a woman looking to start her business today? One valuable tip I’d offer to a woman looking to start her business today is to have unwavering self-belief. Trust in yourself, your abilities, your ideas, and your dreams. Self-confidence will empower you to overcome obstacles, seek opportunities and persist in pursuing your dreams. You got this, sis!!! How do you support other women-owned businesses? I am a big advocate for “women supporting women.” I have benefited immensely from my support community and I have also been supporting other women-owned businesses by: 1. Patronizing women-owned businesses and services. 2. Recommending and referring them whenever the opportunity arises. 3. Following and engaging with their posts on social media. #WomenOwned #TXWomenOwned #InspirationalWoman #CelebratingWomenOwned #WomenSupportingWomen #BusinessBuildingStrategy\n\n🎃 Horror stories from my early entrepreneur days 👻 ----- 💻 The time I spent weeks preparing for my first free masterclass, my laptop charger and battery died meaning I didn’t get to invite attendees to work with me. 👻 The week 3 women ghosted me on discovery calls. 🚀 When NASA requested pricing for my corporate group workshop and told me I was too expensive (their annual budget for that year was $24 billion). 🎥 The time I created a 6 part course containing 20 videos and interactive PDF workbook and zero people bought it. 😬 When I started my business and didn’t know how to do sales conversations, I followed an “expert’s” sales script that used pressure tactics when a client said no - I hated myself more every single day 🤮 Meeting countless creeps in the DMs who’ve confused LinkedIn for Tinder. 😟 When my only remaining client couldn’t complete a coaching package which she had an extended payment plan for, meaning I suddenly had £0 coming in that month. 🙇🏻♀️ The first time I did a live in person talk and was confronted by an audience member who told me that one of my anecdotes was deeply offensive to her. ----- If someone had told me all of these things would happen BEFORE I started a business, I probably would have happily stayed in my cushy, well-paid, full time engineering role. But then I wouldn’t have experienced: 🔥 The freedom that comes from not having to answer to someone else. 🔥 The personal growth that comes from being so exposed and vulnerable when I started my business. 🔥 The fun and creativity to achieve my goals in whatever way I wish to do it. 🔥 The constant ability to morph and change what I do to suit my interests at the time. 🔥 Meeting all the incredible female founders who have helped me through these tough times. ----- And if you want to be a part of the most supportive, inspiring group of women who really understand the ups and downs you go through as a mother as well as a business owner, we welcome you with open arms.

On Monday we held another BUY WOMEN BUILT Power Hour for our community, hosted by the Rockstar that is Joanna Jensen, founder of Childs Farm Ltd!✨ As the number of incredible female founders joining our community grows we have been wondering at BWB HQ how to keep the intimate and personal connections between founders the same. Well...the answer (for now) was actually something much simpler than I had realised. After a motivating conversation with Claire Perry-Louise last week who offered me some great advice on community building, I realised the answer was sitting right in-front of us !! breakout rooms !! At the end of the session we tried something new, Joanna set a prompt for the group for the group \"What is the ONE thing you must COMMIT to stop doing to take my business forward\" and we split the group up to meet each other and discuss. Everyone left with huge smiles and richer connections and as a result this will become a constant practise going forward. The only feedback was...we want longer in them!!! ⭐️ #BuyWomenBuilt #FemaleEntrepreneurs #CommunityBuilding\n\nLooking for a supportive women's networking group?

I love women that build other women up. 🫶 Running and building a business is hard work. Unless you've got your own business it's hard to comprehend the pressures. 🔸️Cash flow 🔸️Staffing 🔸️Price rises 🔸️Growth & opportunities 🔸️Customer satisfaction & buying trends. We always have a good chat, she's been offered an exciting opportunity grow and typically is questioning if it's the right thing to do. I am always a cup half full and see all the possibilities. With a pinch of caution thrown in. Her comment made me a embarrassed and proud in equal measures. 🙈😊 I know first hand how isolating it can be making big decisions about your business on your own, so I will always lend an ear. So it got me thinking... who do you find inspirational and why? There are a couple for me 👇 Lisa Haggar - always on hand for great advice. Charlotte Carter - for always championing my crazy ideas Craig Brookes - for kicking my ass with your no BS I could do with following a few more inspirational people.
