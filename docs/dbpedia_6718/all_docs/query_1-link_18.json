        "text": "1\n\nJuly-August stuff,\n\n1981\n\n(For my sister, if I ever\n\nturn out to have one.)\n\nUntil the thing happened with Marcus, I was glad, sometimes very glad, that Del was my mother. Sure, she was a little Out There in some ways, but she was fun. And I always knew she loved me. I know it now. I mean, I had classmates with Regular Mothers and I could see I was having a better time with Del. Which is why I’m sorry about the terrible thing I did. Which is why I’m in bed with this dwarf.\n\nI think part of what makes Del and me close is the Body Thing. Even though she’s 39 and I’m 14, we have the same body. Big tits. Big asses. Little waists. Del says it gets to be fun when you’re older, but for a young person it’s mostly a drag. Teenage guys are jerks anyway, and they say really dumb things to girls who have majorly conspicuous fronts and backs. I did want guys to like me, but I didn’t want it to be about pretending to bump into me in the hall at school just so they could feel my stuff.\n\nSo I decided I’d only consider older guys. Not Del’s age or anything. Mid- to late-twenties guys. I decided this last year, when I was 13. I was too shy to do anything about it, though, and didn’t know what to do about it anyway. Until Del taught me the Bend Over Thing.\n\nIt happened a few months ago, at this grown-up party. There was this cute guy there. So I did what I always do. Wedged myself into a corner and watched him across the room, thinking as hard as I could, See me! See me and think ‘I must know this person.’ Del caught me doing this. What’s wrong, Rosie? she asked. I said nothing was wrong. Del knew better. She pressed it. So I told her I wanted to meet that guy over there and didn’t know how. She said the guy was a twit and too old for me anyway, but that getting his attention in a positive way would be easy as kiss your hand. Then she took a pencil out of her pocket and handed it to me. Now, you take this and walk over to where he is. Then, you turn your back on the fella, drop the pencil and bend over to pick it up. I said I didn’t see what good picking up a stupid pencil would do. Del smiled. Just do it. I promise you it’ll work a treat. I’ll explain it to you later. So I did. Walked across the room, keeping my eyes down because I felt like a jerk. I could feel Del watching me and I hoped to hell my ankle wouldn’t turn in, which sometimes happens when I’m nervous. I got to the coffee table in front of where the guy was talking to his friends. Boy, is this ever dumb! I thought, but I did it the way Del said. Turned around. Dropped the pencil. Bent over to pick it up. Amazing! When I straightened up, the guy was standing right next to me, chatting away! So were two other guys!\n\nLater, at our place, when we were having hot milk and cinnamon, Del said the Bend Over Thing was primal, that the original cavepeople courted that way. That four-legged animals still do. That it would always work.\n\nI haven’t used it again yet. But I know it’s there for me. A special secret power. Del knows lots of stuff like that. Stuff that Regular Mothers don’t know. Or don’t share.\n\nI don’t know who my father was. That’s not a tacky thing about Del. Del knows, but she won’t talk about it because she thinks he was a shit. A thoroughgoing shit, she says (Del is English). He’s never shown any interest in meeting me (Del says he knew where we were for the first four years of my life), so I guess that’s true. I mean, do I need to know a guy who isn’t even curious about his own kid? Why break your heart, right?\n\nOnly thing is, if I have a father, even the most hopeless father ever, that means I could have a sister. Or a brother. And that person could be really super and great to know. So I keep my eyes open for a girl who looks like me (staring at boys is too much hassle. They always think you want some sex thing. If it’s a brother I’ve got, he’ll have to do the looking, because girls are more used to ignoring being stared at). My sister might not even look all that much like me. She might just have a me-ish feeling, which I would, of course, recognize immediately. So far, no luck. But I thought I’d start this journal so that, if we do find each other, I can give it to her and we won’t have to take forever catching up, and can go out and do stuff together. If she doesn’t have a journal, I will listen to her stuff for absolutely as long as she wants. Being an artist’s model, I can sit still for long periods of time.\n\nMy name is Roanne. It was ROSE Anne, but I took the s and the e out when I was 10 and have no intention of putting them back in! I look older than 14 because of the Body Thing. I’m not a virgin. When I told Del about the first time (rock-band roadie. Great face, great hair, great hands. A drunk. A disaster!), she said, based on my description, that I haven’t come yet, so I’m still half a virgin. Del says coming is one of the absolutely BEST things that can happen to a person, so, naturally, I’m looking forward to it.\n\nDel also said that I now needed some form of birth control, and that we could see her doctor, together, when we got back to Kitsilano, before school started.\n\nI still feel mad at Del sometimes, but I miss her. Fucking Del. Fucking Marcus. Fucking gay dwarf. No, that’s not fair. He’s being really nice, and has this wonderful smell. It’s just that when things are scary it feels good to say fuck a lot. Don’t know why. Just does.\n\nW e’d been in Oregon for two months. On the coast, in a neat little house in the woods. The town’s called Yachats, an Indian word. Pronounced YaHOTS. I was born in England, but have lived in Canada since age four. We came down from Vancouver when Del had a sculpture show in a Yachats gallery. The show sold well and Del was offered a job teaching summertime Adult Extension sculpture classes at a college not far away, in Eugene. I got to make some money too, being her model, which I’ve done, on and off, since I was little.\n\nIt was there, in Eugene, where I met Marcus. I had finished modelling for Del’s 2-to-4-o’clock class. She still had her 6-to-8 once-a-week night class to do (with a male model), so I decided to go into town and pick up the white sweater I was paying off. I love white things, even though they get dirty fast. The best colour of all, I think, is like the skin in enoir paintings. It’s real hard to find. Deco peach, Del says it is. Art stuff, instant-home stuff, bend-over stuff and 60s English music and clothes are Del’s strongest areas of knowledge.\n\nSo, I was on my way to the Fashion Plate (which Del spells p-l-a-i-t. It’s a Del joke; in London slang plait is going down on a guy, and Del thinks Fashion Plate clothes suck) when I saw this guy. Truly, the best-looking guy I had ever seen. I mean personally seen, as opposed to film, telly, poster or album cover. For a start, he was HUGE! Not fat huge. Tall huge. Six-something. And he had this great hair. It’s hard to describe Marcus’s hair colour. It was red, brown, gold—and the whole thing went crazy with beautifulness when the sunlight hit it. And he had this really sexy lower lip. And hands. Big hands.\n\nAs far back as I can remember I’ve had this thing about guys with big hands. When I was little, 6 or 7, I’d see a big-handed guy and suddenly all at once I’d love that person so much! Then, when I was about 9, I would look and think, Please pick me up! Lift me up! I like leaving the ground. Del does too. It’s inherited. Sometimes, I’d dream I was being held in the palm of his open hand and he’d take me around town. Not any town I’ve actually ever lived in. A fantasy beach town with this incredible carousel right on the beach. Beautiful carved lacquer-shiny painted horses going round and round. Me watching, sitting in the palm of this huge, beautiful hand. And the hand never closes on me or drops me. I think it’s going to, but it doesn’t.\n\nAt about that time, when the dreams first started happening, I won this drawing contest at school (to make the illustration for a poster about how reading was good). When the man from the library gave me the prize, he said, Let’s give the little girl a great big hand. That made me think of my dream and I got these stupid giggles. People looked at me like they thought I was weird, which I know some of them thought anyway. There was no way I could explain, so I just giggled until the giggle died.\n\nAnyway, this guy in Eugene had hands that were so big and so amazingly beautiful that I loved them all at once and completely and could hardly breathe. He was looking at me. (It’s possible I looked weird. If I looked on the outside like I felt on the inside, I’m SURE I looked weird!) He laughed. It wasn’t a mean making-fun-of-a-person laugh, but I was embarrassed and took off running for the Fashion Plate.\n\nThe night, no surprise, I had the Hand Dream again. Only this time, ditto no surprise, the big hand belonged to the guy from Eugene.\n\nUsually, when I would see somebody I thought was hot, I’d tell Del about it, and she’d tease me and say semi-gross things, and we’d both laugh. This time, though, I didn’t say anything. I didn’t feel like being teased about it. I think because the hands were in it so much. The hands thing was just so MAJOR for me that I’d never told ANYONE about it. Not even Del. I think people need to keep some stuff. Not tell it.\n\nThe following Tuesday I was modelling. I modelled nude but it was OK. Most of the people in Del’s classes were really trying to make some kind of art. There was one guy with a sort of pervo way of looking at people. Del told me he was just a little walleyed. Besides, they all knew I was Del’s daughter. While I was holding the pose, I kept thinking about the Eugene guy’s hands. Stop fidgeting, Rosie, Del said.\n\nAfter modelling, while I was waiting for Del to finish her night class and drive us home, I looked around town for Mr. Big Hands, but he wasn’t anywhere.\n\nHe was somewhere the following week. I wasn’t even looking. Things like that are like that. If you want to find someone, it’s better if you don’t look. I think there’s a sort of mystical phantom committee whose whole job is to keep people from getting what they want, and if you don’t let on, they get bored with watching you and go off to deny other people stuff and your Wanted Thing slips past them.\n\nAnyway, I was in this croissant place having an apple juice (apple is my favourite juice. Orange churns my guts up. Del’s too. Inherited) and drawing. I’m not an artist-artist professionally. I’m a cartoonist. Like Searle and R. Crumb and D.D.A. I’ve had cartoons printed in school papers, and once in a real newspaper. In Salmon Arm when I was 11. When Del was with Stavro.\n\nSo there I was, in the croissant place, drawing this cartoon of a starfish regenerating, when in came the big hands guy. He sat down at the table next to mine, smiled this terrific smile and said, Hi. I was so glad, this great huge gladness, that I said, actually said, Yay. It was so right out there in the road we both laughed.\n\nThat was Marcus. He said he was 29 so I said I was 16. I knew that 14 sometimes made older guys nervous but 16 was usually OK. We were both lying. Him down, me up, but I didn’t know that then.\n\nIt was really easy talking with him. He was working at the college too. Teaching Adult Extension short-story writing. Same as the thing Del was doing with drawing. He came from Seattle and had written a book of short stories. He walked me over to the BookNook so I could see it. Bought me a copy. I didn’t tell him not to (I think people who say You shouldn’t have! when they’re really happy about being given something are dishonest jerks). He signed, To Roanne, who has just begun to regenerate—from Marcus Willoughby, who is still doing so as best he can. He wrote that because of my starfish cartoon, which he said he really liked. So I gave it to him. He asked me to sign it. I’m usually good with words, because of having an English mum, and reading a lot, but all I could think of to write was, Glad you like this, from Roanne Chappell. Pathetic, eh? Then he had to go teach his night class. I said Bye and that it was nice to meet him. Then I stuck his book inside my denim jacket and went back to the croissant place to wait for Del. She was already there, parked at the curb. I could see that the two young guys at the table by the window were impressed. It wasn’t about Del. It was about the Morgan.\n\nBeing an artist means sometimes being majorly broke. Del and I both know how to make do with whatever. When I was little and there was nothing to eat but bologna (which I hated), Del would point at the slimy pink slices pooching up in the pan and say, Look, Rosie! Chinese hats! It didn’t make the pink slime taste any better but at least she was trying to make it interesting. Last year, she told me she hated bologna too. It had just been at a good stealing location in Mac’s Milk.\n\nThe Morgan was Del’s extravagance. Even when we were broke, she took really good care of it, telling people it was a classic, that it had a wooden frame and ran like a thoroughbred. It’s dark green and shaped like a Labrador retriever’s head. Being a sportscar, it only has two proper seats. With all the paintings and sculptures Del has to haul around, she really needs something like a station wagon, but she loves the Morgan like family, so she just goes back and forth with stuff a lot.\n\nDel was in this really terrific mood. I could tell because she was singing old Brit rock stuff, and when we got to the coast road she did some four-wheel drifts. That’s a crazy steering thing you can do in sportscars on winding roads. It feels like the car’s going to lose it, but there’s a technique to it. Del learned it from this racing car driver she went out with for a while when I was five. He was Italian, with a really low voice and a pretty name. Corrado. When I was little I was scared of four-wheel drifts. I’m used to them now.\n\nSo there was Del, singing Guhn, guhn, gilly guhn guh-uhn, walk on gilded splin . . . TAHS and driving all over the road while I felt the sea wind in my face and Marcus’s book inside my jacket against my body. It was a happy car.\n\nThat night, in my bed, I read one of Marcus’s stories. I’ve always loved to read. Since I was three. Del taught me because I pestered her all the time. I wanted to be on the inside of the secret of the black squiggles. I think when you move around a lot and don’t relate really well with kids your own age, books can be an important alternative to suicide. I’m usually more optimistic about my life now. Books helped with that by showing me possible ways out when my wherever and whatever weren’t as terrific as they could be. I still read a lot, but now it’s mostly just because I like to.\n\nI started one Marcus-story, about a divorcing couple who were fighting over books and records. I couldn’t get into it. Then I found Ursa Major. The woman in the story is on a camping trip with her boring husband. She sees a large, beautiful bear. She leaves food out for him. The next day, she finds a bright blue bead where the food had been. She knows it’s crazy, but she’s certain that the bear left the bead. She strings it on a shoelace and wears it around her neck, telling her husband she found it in the woods. After a week, she has seven bright blue beads on her necklace. At night, while her husband is sleeping, she leaves their tent and walks to the food and beads place. The bear is there. The woman, Alice, feels there’s a sense, an echo of a man’s face within the bear face, an echo of a man’s body within the bear body. The bear kneels in front of her. She drops to her knees facing him/it, smiling. Alice saw the arrow glinting in the night sky, lit by the moon. It described a wide arc. As she cried out, the arrow found its mark. The bear’s mouth opened in surprise, making no sound. His great Kodiak body pitched sideways and fell with a thud to the ground. Once again, as he had deliberately and by accident for ten years, her husband had stepped between Alice and something interesting. I really liked that one. I understood it PERSONALLY. For a while I’d been feeling that something interesting was trying to happen to me, and that someone, or something, was in the road between me and it.\n\nI loved the words described a wide arc. I wanted to make a cartoon of that, but was too sleepy. I dreamt I was held in the bear’s paw. Inside the paw was a man’s hand. It was, of course, Marcus’s.\n\nThe next day, in the teachers’ room, while Del was changing into her smock, I looked up Marcus’s schedule on the bulletin board. He had a 2:30 to 4:30. I decided that after I finished modelling in Del’s 2-to-4 class, I would casually walk by in front of his room. Say hello and see what he said back.\n\nAt four, I toreassed out of Del’s class and ran upstairs to the women’s loo on Marcus’s floor. Hair up or hair down? Down was sexier but Del was always saying I had a gorgeous neck and clavicles that I obscured with too much hair. Marcus was closer to Del’s age than mine, so I decided to go for a high ponytail. Did lips, did eyes, and hauled my heartbreaker clavicles down the hall. Timing, perfecto! Marcus’s class was breaking up and people were coming through the door. Then Marcus came out. He was talking to a woman. She looked low end of older. About 25, 26. Blondish. Fattish. He didn’t see me. Hi, I said brilliantly. They both looked at me. Oh, hello, Roanne, he said, sounding like what a beige wall would sound like if a beige wall could talk. The woman was looking at me with that Oh, really? face female persons sometimes use to make other female persons feel stupid and wrong. It worked great. I said something truly babbloid about having to model for my mother’s class, then ran off down the hall. Behind me, I heard them laugh. I was sure it was something about me. Probably about my body. You’re in no position to do body jokes, Miss Lard-ass Bleacho Bloato! I wanted to say, but I got a grip on it. Back on the second floor, all flushed, I turned on the water fountain, stuck my hand in it and wet my face. Damn, I thought, I don’t know how to do this stuff! What was I supposed to do, turn around and bend over?\n\nHello, you. It was Marcus. I was still mad at him for laughing at me the day before, with the fat blonde. It had been my plan to cut him dead the next time I saw him.\n\nHi!! I said. Then I remembered my plan and went back to my cartoon of a fat blonde being penetrated rectally by a schoolbus.\n\nMay I sit down?\n\nIf you like.\n\nI was pleased with that. Cool, but not rude.\n\nMarcus, however, didn’t seem to notice. He sat down, smiling his terrific smile. I want to use some lapidary, different colored stones, as part of a writing exercise for tomorrow’s class. There’s a shop, Clyde’s Rock House, out on the coast road. Would you like to take a ride out there with me?\n\n1) I’m too busy. 2) Sorry, I’m meeting somebody. 3) Fuck you. I couldn’t decide which one to use. OK, I said.\n\nI knew Clyde’s. Knew Clyde. Nice old guy. Skinny. Missing his two bottom front teeth. He’d owned the Shell station next to the rock shop. Sold the station to his nephew Buzz and opened the Rock House because he loved rocks. Clyde had a big black dog, mostly Lab, named Geronimo. Geronimo really liked me, and Clyde let me take him for runs on the beach. I had bought some stones from Clyde too. His prices were lots better than in Vancouver. Even with the money difference between American and Canadian.\n\nI told Marcus all this as we drove along the coast road. It was a gray day and a little cold, so Marcus gave me his jacket to wear. It was green corduroy and smelled like him. It felt like I was wearing Marcus. Like I was the man echo inside the bear.\n\nMarcus drove a Jeep. I liked it. Funky-elegant. Like Marcus. He was wearing a green-and-gray checked flannel shirt and old black jeans. Button fly. He looked incredibly hot. I felt like screaming Yippieshit! I told him I’d read Ursa Major, and that I thought it was quite good.\n\nHe smiled, but kept his eyes on the road. Did you? I’m glad. He squeezed my knee for a quick minute. I thought I was going to explode.\n\nClyde was happy to see me (which made me look important in front of Marcus), but nowhere near as happy as Geronimo, who jumped all over me and licked my face. Marcus looked through the boxes of stones. He bought amethysts, carnelian, lapis, malachite and, I think, topaz. Geronimo was galumphing back and forth. He wanted a beach run. I asked Marcus if he’d mind.\n\nNot at all, he said. I’d enjoy a beach run myself.\n\nThere was about a minute of drizzle, then bam!, it was pissing with rain. Geronimo didn’t mind. He was already soaking wet from running in and out of the sea. Marcus and I ran for cover under the pier.\n\nI’d love to say it was this incredibly perfect experience. Two Bodies Moving as One and all that. But it wasn’t. Not even a little bit. What it was was:\n\nA boulderette in the sand grinding into the left cheek of my bum.\n\nRain coming through the boards of the pier into my eyes (which I closed). And my nose (which I could not close).\n\nSand in pretty much everything I had that could get sand in it.\n\nAs for two bodies moving as one, forget it! My fault. I kept trying to go up when Marcus went down. But, what with the rock and the sand and the rain in my nose, I would lose the rhythm. When I moved down as Marcus moved up, he’d fall out and one of us, sometimes both of us, would have to put him back in. I was very wet inside and it made his thing slippery and sticky and it took forever to put it back. Marcus asked me to say his name over and over, and to say fuck me, so I said Marcus, Marcus, fuck me, fuck me. Or, Marcus, fuck me, Marcus, fuck me. Then he came, saying, \"Yes, baby, yes! \" I didn’t come. While he was coming and yessing, I said, I love you. I said it very softly so he wouldn’t feel obligated to love me back.\n\nWhen Marcus pulled out I found out why I was so wet. His thing was covered with blood! Perfect, Roanne! Absolutely fucking brilliant! I felt like the scummiest, grossest person anybody could possibly be with. I started to cry and couldn’t stop. I kept sobbing these huge gulpy sobs and saying, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Marcus was very sweet, sweeter than I would’ve been if somebody bled all over ME! He sat up and held me. He rocked me in his arms and petted my hair. He kept saying, It’s OK, baby, it’s OK. Geronimo was trying to lick between my legs.\n\nIt had gotten dark while we were under the pier, so we put just our shirts on and sat in the shallow water to wash ourselves off. Then we finished dressing and walked Geronimo back to Clyde’s.\n\nDriving me home, Marcus asked, How do you feel? I said I was OK. He held my hand and played with my fingers. I asked if he wanted to go for a pizza. He said he couldn’t. That he had a meeting with a writing student. That he’d see me at the college.\n\nAfter you’re with someone for the first time, it’s really, really important that they ask you out again. With someone sexually, I mean. Not that I would’ve blamed Marcus if he didn’t want more actual sex with me. I wasn’t very good at it. And I bled on him. But after a first time, a woman or girl or whatever feels really open. It’s like you give yourself over, give up a lot of the control you have over who you are, over how it is with you. With the roadie, I knew when we were doing it that he was only in town for the one night. And he was a rock ’n’ roll person. Marcus was going to be in Eugene all summer. And he wrote books, which isn’t occupationally as flaky. So I needed to have him at least ask if I wanted to have lunch or"
