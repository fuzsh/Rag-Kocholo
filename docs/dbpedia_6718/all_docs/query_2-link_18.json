        "text": "Entrepreneur Deborah Meaden is best known to many as one of the longest-running investors on BBC's Dragons' Den.\n\nHowever, many will be surprised to release that the business tycoon grew up in none other than the county of Essex.\n\nThe star grew up by the seaside, enjoying the coast with her mother and sister.\n\nRead More: Gemma Collins: Age, net worth, ex-relationships, and glittering portfolio in reality TV\n\nDeborah and her husband Paul don't have children of their own but enjoy a happy life with their numerous animals.\n\nThroughout the years, she has lived in homes all across the country.\n\nSurprising to many, the star grew up in her family home in Brightlingsea, Essex, whilst her mother worked in Butlin's in Clacton.\n\nDeborah told Great British Life: \"‘I must have been three or four, and my sister started school in Frinton when she was five. I have wonderful memories of my time in Essex.\n\n\"I still have some lovely photos of myself and my sister on the beach. It was a magical time. I have wonderful memories of my time in Essex. I still have some lovely photos of myself and my sister on the beach. It was magical.\"\n\nIn 2013, she even starred as a contestant on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing with professional partner Robin Windsor.\n\nFollowing the show's appearance and her elimination, Deborah has previously spoken out about how she has been left in 'permanent pain' from the show.\n\nAt the time, the star told Closer Magazine: “I still have permanent pain in the balls of my feet, which is a constant reminder that I did the show.\n\nIt started after I spent 10 hours a day waltzing and I put too much pressure on them.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, Deborah has a whopping fortune, according to Spear's Magazine, the businesswoman has a net worth of approximately £40 million.\n\nThis is thanks to her success as a businesswoman and her long-running role on Dragon's Den.\n\nThe entrepreneur is estimated to have invested around £3.3m on the BBC show.\n\nAs of 2021, the 63-year-old had invested in a total of 63 businesses.\n\nThe Dragons' Den star has been starring on the BBC series since 2006, making a 16 year impression to viewers.\n\nShe originally joined the third series of the show and continues to work alongside Peter Jones, the longest running Dragon, to this day."
