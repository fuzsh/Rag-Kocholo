But who has been good, and who has been bad?\n\nDC\n\nCharlie Brooker’s 2016 Wipe\n\nCharlie Brooker returns for his annual review of the year and this year he’s picked 2016. Which seems appropriate.\n\nCharlie says: \"If you told me at the start of the year that by October half our cultural icons would be dead, we’d have voted to leave the EU, and Donald Trump would be hovering near the White House… oh and the Bake Off wouldn’t even be on BBC One anymore? I’d have been digging a bunker.\"\n\nAttempting to make sense of the year’s news, TV and online phenomena, Charlie will be aided and abetted in this hour long special by guest contributors including the ever insightful Philomena Cunk…\n\nEndemol Shine\n\nCunk On Christmas\n\n…Who is also back as the penetrating commentator, with a one-off comedy special tackling all this Christmas, written by Charlie Brooker.\n\nFresh from her in-depth investigation into the life of Shakespeare, Philomena is now on a festive mission to track down the true meaning of Christmas, and find out exactly what it is he wants.

With an unintentional order for multiple prams, she soon discovers just how quickly internet shopping can go wrong.\n\nBeth’s got company at home in the shape of Ian and Jaz who are staying while they wait to pick up keys for their new flat and footie fans Colin and Eric are getting excited about their trip to watch Scotland play in Latvia.\n\nEric is persuaded to wear one of Colin’s old kilts for the trip but ends up red-faced when he reveals more to the Tartan Army than he’d ever intended.\n\nEpisode six\n\nBeth is organising the perfect baby shower for mum-to-be Sophie in this final episode of comedy series Two Doors Down.\n\nJaz is sporting a corker of a black eye after a run-in with a packing box, much to the amusement of the neighbours. His day doesn’t improve any when he’s on the receiving end of a wind-up from Colin who’s teasing the boys about them moving in to a less than salubrious area.\n\nCathy, meanwhile, is worried about being too close to the action if Sophie goes into labour.
