        "text": "DEBORAH Meaden rose to fame for being one of the Dragons on Dragon's Den as well as being an entrpreneur.\n\nShe's become known for being fiery and soon became a fan favourite but who is she?\n\nWho is Deborah Meaden, how old is she and what is her background?\n\nDeborah Meaden is a businesswoman and star of Dragons' Den.\n\nShe was born on February 11, 1959 in Somerset, Deborah grew up in Essex before moving back to the West Country.\n\nShe first got a taste for business when leading paid pony rides along the beach in Minehead at the age of just eight.\n\nShe then left school when she was 16 and studied at Brighton Technical College, before setting up a glass and ceramics export agency while living in Italy.\n\nThat venture was unsuccessful so she returned to the UK and bought a textile franchise.\n\nHaving sold that she went into the retail and leisure industries and even operated Prize Bingo in Minehead.\n\nThrough the 90s she owned Weststar Holidays and once that had been sold, acquired Fox Brothers, a textile mill, in 2009.\n\nIn 2011 she launched The Merchant Fox, a website selling luxury British-made goods.\n\nWhat is her net worth?\n\nDeborah's net worth is estimated to be roughly £40 million.\n\nShe ran a multimillion-pound family holiday business, before completing a management buyout.\n\nSince joining the panel of Dragons' Den, the magnetic Meaden has invested more than £2 million in 33 ventures - according to her website.\n\nWhen did Deborah Meaden join Dragons' Den?\n\nDeborah took over from Rachel Elnaugh on the third series of Dragons' Den back in 2003.\n\nAt the time she was the only female dragon, alongside Duncan Bannatyne, Richard Farleigh, Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis.\n\nDeborah took part in the 2013 series of Strictly, partnered with Robin Windsor.\n\nShe lasted five weeks, with Abbey Clancy eventually going on to win the series.\n\nWho is Deborah Meaden's husband Paul?\n\nDeborah married long-term boyfriend Paul in 1993 and they live in Somerset.\n\nPaul and Deborah met when he was working at Weststar during his university break in 1985.\n\nThey separated briefly due to the fact she didn't want a family but after she took a trip to Venezuela, she returned to London and they tied the knot.\n\nIn an interview with the Telegraph in 2011 Deborah revealed that she doesn't do any housework because Paul is in charge of the \"domestic chores.\"\n\nIn 2009 Deborah released book Common Sense Rules, using a ghostwriter.\n\nWhat is Dragon's Den?\n\nBudding entrepreneurs get three minutes to pitch their business ideas to five multi millionaires who are willing to invest their own cash to kick-start the businesses.\n\nThe entrepreneurs don't always have to answer, but of course, what they choose not to address could very well affect the outcome.\n\nA Dragon who, having heard the pitch, does not wish to invest, must declare themselves \"out\", implying that they leave the discussion.\n\nWhen is Dragon's Den on TV and how can I watch it?\n\nDragon's Den returns to BBC One on Thursday, January 4, at 8pm.\n\nThe new series will see new episodes air weekly at the same time.\n\nIf you miss any upcoming episodes, just head over to BBC iPlayer, where they will be available to watch there."
