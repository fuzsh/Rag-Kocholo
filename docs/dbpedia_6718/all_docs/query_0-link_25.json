        "text": "They graduated from the University of Life and went on to accumulate massive wealth.\n\nAn alternative Rich List published today shows that missing out on traditional prestige qualifications is no barrier to extraordinary success.\n\nThe list features entrepreneurs such as John Caudwell, John Frieda, Gordon Ramsay, Deborah Meaden of Dragons' Den fame, and Dame Vivienne Westwood, who all served time as apprentices or took vocational training.\n\nAll 100 on the list have a personal fortune of at least £7m, and compare well with contemporaries from academia.\n\nThe wealthiest, diamond magnate Laurence Graff, with a fortune of £2bn, ranks 31st in a national wealth list published earlier this year.\n\nSecond-placed Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB, comes 34th in the Sunday Times Rich List. The vast majority of the millionaires in the sixth annual Vocational Rich List, published by City & Guilds, are entirely self-made.\n\nOnly four have inherited wealth, and they are credited with turning family businesses into much larger enterprises.\n\nThey are also praised for staving off the effects of the current economic squeeze with a hands-on approach to their businesses.\n\nMore than half of those in the top 25 have maintained or expanded their fortunes in the past year, while the list's four billionaires have increased their collective wealth by £1.2bn.\n\nBob Coates, managing director of the vocational awards body, said: 'It's encouraging to see that many of the entrepreneurs who started their careers with a work- related qualification continue to flourish.\n\n'It's important to remember that the vast majority of the millionaires who feature in the Vocational Rich List survived tough trading conditions in the recessions of the eighties and nineties.\n\n'Their success to date shows that there's a lot to be learned from on-the-job training that shaped their approach to doing business. The journeys these vocational entrepreneurs have taken highlight that different routes and learning styles can offer just as good an opportunity in life and can be equally rewarding.'\n\nTo make the list, compiled by money expert Philip Beresford, candidates have to have an apprenticeship or vocational qualification, even if they are no longer working in the same field.\n\nCity & Guilds studied the list for character traits and noted that a considerable number showed true grit by overcoming major business failures. These include Paul Davidson, who declared bankruptcy in 2004 but has since built a fortune of £40mn through the pipe repair company Fluid Leader.\n\nEighty per cent of the top 25 millionaires are still working in the fields in which they started. But they enjoy the sort of wealth that takes time - the average age in the top 25 is 61. Even within the top 100, there are only three aged under 40.\n\nAnd while the top 100 includes a smattering of household names - including Sir Alex Ferguson, Alan Titchmarsh, Alan Shearer, Rolf Harris and Stella McCartney - celebrity does not guarantee a personal fortune. Many of the top ten are fairly obscure.\n\nTHE CARAVAN QUEEN\n\nWORTH: £40m\n\nMost famous for her role as a panellist on the BBC show Dragons' Den, Deborah Meaden is the highest-ranked woman on the Vocational Rich List with a personal fortune of £40m.\n\nRaised in Wiltshire, she left Trowbridge High School aged 16 to read business studies at Brighton Technical College.\n\nAt 19 she launched her own venture, importing glass and ceramics from Italy, and in the early 1980s set up the first Stefanel franchise - an Italian footwear and clothing company - in the UK.\n\nIn 1988 she began to look for other ventures to move into and set about building up her parents' caravan park, named Weststar, on the Lizard peninsular. In 20 years she helped the Exeter-based business flourish. The park now contains caravan holiday homes, lodges, bungalows and 1,000 camping pitches.\n\nPower-dressing Meaden, 49, who has a formidable, no-nonsense approach on the BBC2 show, became chief executive after leading a management buy-out in 1999. She sold the business for a reported £33m six years later.\n\nShe lives with her husband, Paul, and several dogs, cats, chickens and horses, in Somerset. The couple have no children and also own property in the fashionable Primrose Hill area of North London.\n\nShe insists that her off-screen persona is much softer than she appears on television. 'Nobody is like the person I am on TV,' she said. 'Surely, only Cruella de Vil, or the wicked witch from Snow White.'\n\n• Archives: The slow starters who made millions (July 2007)\n\nTHE BOAT BUILDER\n\nWORTH: £130m\n\nBy his own admission Robert Braithwaite was academically hopeless, but his love of water and everything nautical from a young age propelled him into becoming one of the country's most successful boat builders.\n\nHe left school at 14 with no qualifications and moved from Otley Moor, in Yorkshire, to the Hampshire coast when his parents became proprietors of a village store near Christchurch.\n\nThey had already encouraged Braithwaite's love of watercraft by buying him a portable 'pack-a-boat', but decided to indulge him further by helping him into a small marine business in Christchurch harbour.\n\nHe spent a few years servicing outboard engines and did an engineering course before completing a six-month apprenticeship at OMC in Belgium - one of the world's leading marine engine suppliers.\n\nOn his return Braithwaite borrowed £5,000 and built his first boat - a 17-footer - and the Sunseeker brand was born.\n\nThe name is now synonymous with luxury boats of the rich and famous and at the 2007 London Boat Show, Braithwaite unveiled his biggest and most expensive power boat - a £37m three deck boat which will cost £10m.\n\nFormula One racing boss, Eddie Jordan, has already signed up to buy one.\n\nBraithwaite, 60, has a personal fortune of £130m.\n\nTHE PLUMBER\n\nWORTH: £14m\n\nImpressed by his local plumber's car - a Ford Zephyr - Charlie Mullins was drawn into the trade early.\n\nAs a boy, he used to take time off school to work for the plumber and landed an apprenticeship after leaving school at 15 with no qualifications.\n\nFrom a working-class North London background, Mullins, now 55, dreamed of working for the affluent residents of Kensington and Chelsea.\n\nAt 20, he struck out on his own, working mainly in those areas.\n\nRealising that to flourish he had to match the standards of the residents, he formed Pimlico Plumbers two years later. The firm's success is founded on providing a high-quality service in a field which has its share of less scrupulous tradesmen.\n\nMullins, who is married to Lynda and is now more likely to wear a £3,000 Savile Row suit than overalls, enforces a policy of no earrings, tattoos, dirty vans or 'builders' bums' - and charges more than most.\n\nNearly 30 years after he founded the firm with little more than a bag of tools and hire purchase van, he employs 121 staff - including apprentices, of course.\n\nHis business is valued at £10m.\n\nTHE JEWELLER\n\nWORTH: £2bn\n\nThe son of immigrants, Laurence Graff, 70, tops the Vocational Rich List with a personal wealth of £2bn built on an international diamond business.\n\nHe spent his first seven years in a single room in Whitechapel, East London, shared with his Jewish Orthodox parents. His father was a tailor who designed and cut suits.\n\nAt 13, Graff left school and took on a Hatton Garden apprenticeship in diamonds. He began buying and selling stones in 1957 and opened Hatton Garden's first retail jeweller five years later aged 24.\n\nBy the mid-sixties his workshop was regarded as a haunt for the mega-rich. His most notable clients include the Sultan and Queen of Brunei and Donald Trump. Last year the business, Graff Diamonds International, made a profit of £60m.\n\nGraff, who is married with children, is notoriously reclusive and rarely gives interviews. He splits his time between five luxurious homes in England, France, Switzerland and New York. He owns a private jet, Mediterranean yacht and a vineyard in Stellenbosch, South Africa.\n\nDespite his years, he is currently overseeing the opening of a diamond industrial zone in Botswana where local craftsmen are being trained to cut and polish stones.\n\nMr Graff said: 'There is no doubt that if you have a passion for something it translates into everything in your life - both work and pleasure.'"
