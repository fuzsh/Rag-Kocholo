        "text": "FEBE celebrates the greatest entrepreneurs in Britain, and we are delighted to launch the 2024 Growth 100 – our annual list and awards that shines a light on the finest and fastest-growing privately owned businesses in the country, where the founder or founders are still involved. This is the beating heart of our club that inspires, motivates and supports the very best entrepreneurs and their companies.\n\nThe essence of FEBE is entrepreneurs supporting entrepreneurs. We exist to inspire and champion our country’s best ‘dare-to-doers’. We know how important it is to celebrate our country’s founders and their businesses, and the Growth 100 does just that.\n\nThere are 4.2m private companies in the UK. Just 1% or 45,000 of these are considered to be ‘high growth’. But who are the 100 fastest growing?\n\nFEBE is delighted to present the 100 fastest growing, founder-led, privately owned businesses in the UK. All listed companies are profitable and are turning over between £3m-£200m.\n\nOur Watch List features companies that are achieving amazing things and are truly worthy of celebration. They do not yet meet all of the Growth 100 criteria, for example, they may not be in profit, they may not be hitting £3m sales, or their growth rates may just have fallen short of the G100 but, they are on a mission, making great things happen and we are excited to share their stories.\n\nDid you miss the chance of featuring in the G100 or the Watch List this year? If you’d like to put yourselves forward for our 2025 list, please send us all your details using the form below. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nOur awards night in September, for founders only, will bring together the entrepreneurs behind the 100 fastest growing companies in the UK. A night designed to feel as far away from a traditional corporate award ceremony as possible, we bring to you an unforgettable night at a legendary venue.\n\nA night most definitely not to be missed…\n\nFEBE’s Hall of Fame includes all the companies that have previously featured in either the G100 or the Watch List and have now smashed past our £200m ceiling. We’re so proud to have these companies in the FEBE gang and absolutely delighted that we had to chance to celebrate these incredible founders and their businesses. Onwards and upwards…\n\nData collection: Sources used include: Companies House, Beauhurst (a primary data supplier), news articles and other public sources. Some companies were self-nominated, some were nominated by their advisers, and others were identified through FEBE’s own research. Where accounts are not available at Companies House, FEBE has used financial data directly provided by the companies – this applies to half of the entrants on this year’s league table. The ranking does not claim to be complete, as most small companies file abbreviated accounts and choose not to make their sales figures public.\n\nDisclaimer: The inclusion of any company within the league table, or within any of FEBE’s publications, articles or other content, is not an endorsement or recommendation whatsoever by FEBE or any of its partners or sponsors; nor is it an indication that they one of the best-run companies in the UK. The league table is based on historical data and is not an indicator of present or future performance. FEBE reserves the right to make exceptions to the qualification criteria in its absolute discretion.\n\nWe are interested in talking to companies that share the FEBE philosophy and would like to partner with us. If you’d like to understand more about our partnership opportunities and become part of the beating heart that inspires, motivates and supports Britain’s best entrepreneurs, contact us at hello@febe.com."
