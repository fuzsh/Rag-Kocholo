        "text": "As one of Britain’s most high-profile businesswomen, Deborah Meaden’s talent for spotting an opportunity and making money from it has turned her into a household name, as well as a multi-millionaire. Yet while she could easily afford to indulge in all the trappings of fame and fortune, the Dragons’ Den star prefers to live an altogether simpler existence.\n\nRather than splashing out on private jets, a fleet of fast cars or a wardrobe full of designer clothes, Deborah says her only extravagance is the farmhouse she and her husband Paul Farmer have lovingly and ethically renovated, and where they live with a menagerie of cats, dogs, horses, pigs, geese, exbattery hens and a flock of rescue sheep."
