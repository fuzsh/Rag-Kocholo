In Sindelfingen, no major modifications were to be made to the existing building. The challenge for RENK: to adapt the new test rigs exactly to the existing framework conditions. In this way, no new foundation had to be built in Sindelfingen, which saved the use of 200 tons of concrete, for example. Another challenge: the conversion must not interfere with ongoing development operations at the test facility. After all, an automotive company knows no standstill - especially not in the development department.

RENK subsidiary RTS is controlling all the disciplines involved. This ensures a smooth meshing of subsystems such as room air technology, acoustically optimized blow duct, roller test stand, acoustic lining, electric charging facility, fire protection and other technical building equipment. "In this way, the client saves the effort of having to build up his own capacities, does not have to build up additional expertise and is supplied with a turnkey result," emphasizes Jens Schneider. In other cases, the Augsburg specialists also design the associated building and its networking with other areas of the customer. In such a case, RENK not only takes over the planning of the plant including the building. In addition, various specialist departments work out the test stand itself with the customer, because the testing installations are individually tailored systems and not equipment from a catalog.
