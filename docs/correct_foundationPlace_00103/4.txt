founded in 1915 by Daimler-Motorengesellschaft, the Sindelfingen plant is now the largest production plant of Mercedes-Benz AG. Since its foundation, it has grown to cover an area of more than 2 kmÂ². The E-Class and S-Class, the GLC and the electric S-Class EQS are produced here.

At the Sindelfingen plant, our department plays an essential role in the process chain when building cars and acts as an interface between batch production in the press shop and flow production in the body shop to ensure a smooth production process. This includes not only the optimization of supply and disposal processes, but also the scheduling and control of press and body-in-white parts

One of the pivotal points is the automatic high-bay warehouse and the press part conveyor system with its driverless transport vehicles for the automatic supply of the body shop and the loading center.
