The roof structure, designed like a spoked wheel and consisting of a curved wooden suspension structure, floats above an elliptically shaped concrete exhibition building and rises above it. In the centre of the construction is a circular steel ring through which daylight enters the exhibition space.\n\nSculpture Hall Neuss\n\nat a glance\n\nFloating spoked wheel\n\nas roof supporting structure\n\nThe roof structure of the sculpture hall in Neuss was designed according to the construction principle of a spoked wheel. In the process, glulam girders were attached to a steel tension ring on the inner part of the wheel and to a compression ring on the outer part, which was designed as a steel spar box girder. To ensure safe roof drainage, a high point was erected on the pull ring.\n\nBuilding project Sculpture Hall Neuss, Berger Weg 16, 41472 Neuss/Holzheim Construction Glulam girder Construction time August 2014-March 2016 Volume of the wooden components 70 m³ Stored CO2 in the construction 53.13 tCO2 Avoided CO2 in the construction 63.76 tCO2 Regrowth speed in german forests 2 minutes Building owner Thomas Schütte Stiftung, D-Düsseldorf Architectural design Thomas Schütte General contractor Heinrich Heinemann, RKW Architektur + Städtebau, D-Düsseldorf, www.rkw.plus Structural engineering Dr.-Ing.

Originally, a concrete construction was considered, but the formwork proved to be too expensive. For this reason, a curved wooden suspension structure was chosen as the roof support structure instead, which was not only more cost-efficient, but also created a unique aesthetic as well as a warm atmosphere.\n\nDownloads\n\nfor reference\n\nHolz-Zentralblatt: From imaginary model to enclosed art space\n\nJune 2018 • Marc Wilhelm Lennartz\n\nDownload (German article)\n\nFurther\n\ntopics\n\nIndividual glulam\n\nWith our glulam, individual constructions can be built, because we produce the components in almost any shape and size – entirely according to your wishes.
