        "text": "The following contains a (sometimes commented) glossary of terms related to lean manufacturing or production management with a brief definition. The list includes a lot of Japanese terms, although almost all of them can also easily be explained using English terms, which are also given. This list is ever expanding but never complete, as the tendency to invent new terms or buzzwords outstrips the ability of any lexicographer. While a lot of the 469 terms below are useful, many of them seem to have been invented solely to sell more products and services to industry using fancy buzzwords. To make things easier for you I have marked which terms are (in my opinion) more or less relevant:\n\nA full bullet indicates a more relevant term. Those will help you in your daily Lean related work.\n\nA circle bullet indicates a less relevant term. Those are less useful to me but can be used to bedazzle others with fancy language or to avoid being bedazzled by others.\n\nPlease let me know if you think there are any terms missing.\n\n# – A – B – C – D – E – F – G – H – I – J – K – L – M – N – O – P – Q – R – S – T – U – V – W – X – Y – Z\n\n#\n\n3 K (Kiken, Kitsui, Kitanai): Refers to unpleasant working conditions kiken (危険, dangerous), kitsui (きつい, difficult), and kitanai (汚い, dirty).\n\n3 M (Muda, Mura, Muri): Short for the words Muda (waste), Mura (unevenness), and Muri (overburden). Very rarely there is also a 4M and a 5M with Muchi (無知) for ignorance and Mushi (無視) for ignoring (yes, I know they are almost the same). However, I think you are perfectly fine with sticking to the original 3M.\n\n3 P (Production Preparation Process): Product design process developed initially at Volkswagen focusing in manufacturability. One of its key features is the use of models or prototypes for assembly tests. Sometimes it also stands for “People Preparation Process”. See also Cardboard Engineering and DFMA. See also my series of posts on Cardboard Engineering.\n\n3 R (Three “reals”): Referring to Reality, Real Place (or more correctly actual spot), Real Thing, or Genjitsu, Gemba, and Genbutsu in Japanese. These Japanese words all start with the Kanji 現. Sometimes one of these 3R is swapped with Genchi for the real place or Genchi Genbutsu for going and seeing the real place. See also my post on Visit the Shop Floor or Your People Will Fool You! – Genchi Genbutsu.\n\n4 M (man, machine, material, method): Common structure for potential causes for Problem Solving methods, for example as the bones of the Fish Bone Diagram. This is often expanded into 8M, including additionally management, milieu, measurement, and money. Other versions exist including product/service, price, place, promotion, people/personnel, process, physical evidence; or surroundings, suppliers, systems, skills, safety.\n\n4 P (philosophy, process, people and partners, problem solving): Lean thinking modell often attributed to Toyota, although I am not sure if it really is from Toyota, or a western interpretation of the Toyota approach. It seems to be little used. Often visualized as a triangle with problem solving at the top.\n\n5 C: Not so common English translation of 5 S, where the S’es are translated into 1) Clear Out & Classify; 2) Configure; 3) Clean & Check; 4) Conformity and 5) Custom & Practice. Otherwise, everything else is the same. See 5 S for more.\n\n5 G: Uncommon western extension of the 3 R (three reals) Genjitsu (現実, Reality), Gemba (現場, actual spot, scene of the crime, shop floor), and Genbutsu (現物, actual article or object) by adding genri (原理 for principle; theory; fundamental truth) and gensoku (原則 for principle; general rule). Notice how the last two start with different kanji characters?\n\n5 S: Workplace organization based on Seiri (整理, organize); Seiton (整頓 orderliness); Seiso (清掃, cleaning); Seiketsu (清潔 immaculate); and Shitsuke (躾 discipline); in English often translated as sort, systematic arrangement, shine, standardize, sustain or variations thereof. Toyota uses only 4S (the last one “Shitsuke” is a later addition and somewhat redundant). I have seen up to 8 different “S” in use, but more does not mean better here. In English also sometimes translated into 5 C. If it is overused the workers may translate 5S as “Some Stupid Supervisor Said So“. See also my posts How 5S Works and How to Make 5S Stick.\n\n5 Why: Japanese Problem Solving approach of asking “why” five times to determine the source of the problem. See also 5W1H. See also my post All About 5 Why.\n\n5W1H (When, Where, Who. What, Why, How): Series of questions sometimes used in Problem Solving to understand the breadth of a situation. Sometimes also without the “how” part, in which case it may be called the 5 Why’s. Including the “how” it is sometimes confusingly also called 6W. Similar but for a different purpose than the 5 Why in Japan.\n\n6 σ (Six Sigma): Originally a quality-based approach to manufacturing, requiring six standard deviations (actually 4.5 standard deviations) between the mean and the tolerance limits to ensure quality. Has by now expanded to include all of lean manufacturing and is hence often called Lean Six Sigma. Six Sigma is well known for its lean training organization awarding green belts and Black Belts, although a black belt does not automatically mean that the person has experience in lean. See also my post on Six Sigma.\n\n7 Management and Planning Tools: Seven Management and Planning Tools (also known as New Seven Tools or TQC2) promoted by JUSE. These tools are: Affinity Diagram, Interrelationship Digraph, Tree Diagram, Prioritization Matrix, Matrix Diagram, PDPC, and Activity Network Diagram.\n\n7 Types of Waste: Traditionally, waste (Muda) is grouped into seven types. The seven types of waste commonly used in lean are (in the original sequence of Ohno starting with the worst) overproduction, waiting (of operators), unnecessary transport, over-processing, inventory, movement (of operators), and defects and rework. Many more types of waste have been added in the western world, most prominently wasted human creativity – although I am a fan of the original seven types from Toyota. See Tim Wood for an easy to remember mnemonic, although the sequence is not in the original priority. See also Mottainai and DOWNTIME. See also my post The Seven Types of Waste (Muda).\n\n8 D (Eight Disciplines Problem Solving): Method developed at Ford in 1987 for Problem Solving based on eight disciplines, although a ninth discipline (Number 0) has later been added. The disciplines in order are: (0) Plan; (1) Use a team; (2) Describe the problem; (3) Develop interim containment plan; (4) Determine, and verify root causes; (5) Verify if permanent corrections for problem will resolve problem for the customer; (6) Define and implement corrective actions; (7) Prevent recurrence; (8) Congratulate Your team. Sometimes also called Problem Solving Process (PSP). See also PDCA. See also my overview of PDCA variants at The Many Flavors of the PDCA.\n\n8 R: List of aspects that have to be right in supply chain management or purchasing. The exact content of the list varies, as there are also examples with 5R. Usually it includes the right quality, right quantity, right material type, right place, right time, right source, right price, right type of transport, right contract. The first five of these are usually the 5R, pick any of the nine in the list for the other 8R, as not everybody agrees on what is right.\n\n8 Step Problem Solving: Problem Solving approach often attributed to Toyota. The steps are 1) Clarify the Problem; 2) Breakdown the Problem; 3) Set the Target; 4) Analyze the Root Cause; 5) Develop Countermeasures; 6) Implement Countermeasures; 7) Monitor Results and Process; and 8) Standardize and Share Success. Please note that there is also a Six Step Problem Solving by Toyota. See also 8 D.\n\n14 Management Principles of The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles of The Toyota Way were published by Liker, Jeffrey as an attempt to summarize the Toyota Production System into 14 principles. Examples are 1: Base your decision on long-term philosophy rather than short-term goals; 3: Use pull to avoid overproduction; 4: Level the workload; 7: Use visual controls; 11: Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers; 12: go and see for yourself; 14: Become a learning organization. While believe it is impossible to capture the Toyota production system in a few bullets, I do think he got the significant key points and do like the overview. Not to be confused with the 14 Points for Total Quality Management by W. Edwards Deming.\n\n14 Points for Total Quality Management: List of 14 key points developed by W. Edwards Deming to help managers with transforming and improving their business. Examples would be (1) Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service; (6) Institute training on the job; or (10) Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Not to be confused with the 14 Management Principles of The Toyota Way by Liker, Jeffrey.\n\nA\n\nA3: Structured Problem Solving sheet named after the paper format DIN A3, which is small enough to carry around yet large enough to fit all the data. Ideally done by hand, but in the western world mostly done through computer files. Sometimes also called A3 report. See also my series of posts starting with The A3 Report – Part 1: Basics.\n\nAAR (After Action Review): Structured review originally developed by the US army to understand what happened, why it happened, and how it can be done better. It is done usually shortly after the completion of a mission. These AAR can be done informally in small groups, or with a more formal framework. The latter, of course, consumes more time. See also YWT, KPT, Four Line Diary, and PDCA.\n\nA-B Control: Type of process control, where multiple sequential machines are synchronized. If the subsequent machine B stops, machine A stops, too, even if there would be still space in the buffer in between. Similarly, if the first machine A stops, machine B also stops, even if there are still parts in the buffer in between. The goal is to reduce overproduction even more than with a normal FIFO in between. Sometimes also called AB control or Full Work control.\n\nABC Analysis: Sequential ordering of product variants by quantity or value sold. The goal is to distinguish high volume parts from low volume parts. 80% of the units or sales are represented by only around 20% of the part types (the “A” parts). The next 15% of the units or sales are the “B” parts, and the last 5% with low sales of many different part types are the “C” parts. See also the XYZ Analysis, and the ABC XYZ Analysis.\n\nABC Warehouse: Warehouse management approach based on the ABC Analysis, where the most commonly needed A parts are stored close to the entrance of the warehouse, whereas the least commonly used C parts are stored furthest away.\n\nABC XYZ Analysis: Combination of the ABC Analysis and the XYZ Analysis, where every part number is categorized in 9 categories, from AX for frequently and in large quantities ordered part types to CZ for infrequent and little-ordered part types.\n\nActive Period Method: Method to find the Bottleneck in a simulation or data-rich environment. The momentary bottleneck is the process with the longest duration between interruptions by waiting (waiting for parts from an upstream process, waiting for a downstream process). Please be aware that the statuses of the machines need to be known at all times for this method to work. Hence, the method is well suited for simulations, but less suited for reals hop floors. For real shop floors, I recommend the Bottleneck Walk. Disclaimer: Both methods developed by me. See also my posts Mathematically Accurate Bottleneck Detection 1 – The Average Active Period Method and Mathematically Accurate Bottleneck Detection 2 – The Active Period Method.\n\nAdaptable Manufacturing System: Adaptable manufacturing supposedly considers unforeseen future events during factory planning. See also Flexible, Agile, Reconfigurable, Robust, and Holonic manufacturing systems. See also my post Facing Change in Modern Manufacturing Systems.\n\nAffinity Diagram: Developed by Jiro Kawakita (川喜田 二郎) and hence also known as KJ Method (for Kawakita Jiro). Sort of a Brainstorming method that groups ideas. One of the 7 Management and Planning Tools by JUSE.\n\nAgile: Philosophy initially for software development, somewhat similar or competing with Lean. It started as a counter-movement to a heavily regulated and inflexible software development approach that was (suggested to be) used before. Hence the name Agile as a counter-movement to the inflexible and rigid system before. Not to be confused with the Agile Manufacturing System. At its core is the Agile Manifest, which resulted in a number of principles like “customer focus”, “trust”, or “communication”. One popular tool is for example Scrum. Similar to (good implementations of) Lean there is a focus on practical solutions over rigid methods, a focus on working with people, and a focus on value for the customer. One difference is that Lean uses more standardization, which is useful if you want to make many identical physical products, whereas Agile doesn’t really have work standards and focuses on flexibly getting results, which is well suited for software development, where every software is different and rigid standards would not really help. Another difference is that Lean focuses on the production and Agile on the product. Agile would be more for the development of a product, Lean more for the manufacturing of it.\n\nAgile Manifest: Core philosophy of Agile. It is refreshingly brief, hence listed here in full: We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value: 1) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools; 2) Working software over comprehensive documentation; 3) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation; and 4) Responding to change over following a plan. That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.\n\nAgile Manufacturing System: Agile manufacturing aims for a quick response to changes. See also Flexible, Reconfigurable, Robust, Adaptable, and Holonic manufacturing systems. See also my post Facing Change in Modern Manufacturing Systems.\n\nAmerican System of Manufacturing: Set of manufacturing methods that evolved in the 19th century America, first in the Springfield and Harpers Ferry Armories. It includes mechanization and the use of interchangeable parts. Also known as the American System. It is an improvement of the English system of manufacturing, and the precursor of Fordism.\n\nAmoeba Management: Management method created by Kazuo Inamori, founder of Kyocera, former Japan Airlines CEO, and famous Japanese manager. The Company is organized into small groups of 5 to 50 people, the Amoebas. These amoebas have to create profit. If they are successful and grow, they split up. If they are not successful, they are eventually swallowed by other amoebas. The idea is to better align small groups with the company objectives and to improve their contribution to the company’s success. The name originates in biology, where Amoeba are single-celled organisms that split in two if they grow too big.\n\nAndon (行灯, paper lantern): Signboard in manufacturing that shows the current state of the operations including for example parts produced target and current, process breakdowns, etc. Sometimes also called andon board. Often in combination with Andon Line. See also my posts All About Andon and How to Use an Andon – and How Not To.\n\nAndon Line: Line, button, or switch that is pressed to indicate problems with a process. Can be more than one line for minor or serious problems. Sometimes also called Andon Cord. Often in combination with Andon.\n\nAPQP (Advanced Product Quality Planning): Product design method originating from the US automotive industry with the goal to design products that satisfy the customer.\n\nAQL (Acceptable Quality Level or formerly Acceptable Quality Limit): Concept of a quality level that is not good but acceptable. Not quite conform with the Idea in lean that you should not accept defects. See also RQL for the Rejectable Quality Level.\n\nArubeki Sugata (在るべき姿 or あるべき姿 combination of two words for ideal; desirable; the way something should be; target; goal; and figure, form, shape, appearance, state, condition): Japanese phrase for how it/we should be /want to be. A company needs to be clear about where it wants to go before it can achieve its goals. In English often translated as True North or target state.\n\nAssembly Cell: Cell is used in many different and often overlapping contexts in manufacturing (e.g. machining cell, Cellular manufacturing, etc.). An Assembly cell is a short assembly line with few operators (10 or less), often in a U-Line, where the workers are multifunctional and are moving between the stations as needed. The speed is determined by the workers, not an external conveyor or similar.\n\nAssembly Line: Flow Shop for assembly of parts. Not invented but revolutionized by Henry Ford and his Model T. Two common variants are the Moving Assembly Line and the Pulse Line with constant or interval movement.\n\nAto Kotei (後固定 for after coming down [although I am not 100% sure on the Kanji]): Term commonly used at Toyota for the downstream process in the worklof, which may be a machine, an office, or even the customer. The goal is to not inconvienience the downstream entity with bad quality or delays.\n\nAutonomation: See Jidoka.\n\nB\n\nBa (場, place; spot; space): Concept from Seven Eleven to gain knowledge about their business at a certain time and space to generate and share this knowledge. The word Ba is the same as in GemBA, and hence closely related to Genchi Genbutsu.\n\nBaka Yoke (馬鹿ヨケ, idiot proofing): Creating products and processes that cannot be done incorrectly. Rephrased by Shigeo Shingo in the politically more correct mistake proofing poka yoke.\n\nBaton Touch: Most common way to organize a U-Line. Each operator handles a number of tasks in the line. The processes are handled in the direction of the workflow, and the worker always handles the same set of processes (which may include a switch to the “other side” of the U). See also Bucket Brigade and Rabbit Chase. See also my post The Baton Touch Flow Line!\n\nBlack Belt: Originally from belts in martial arts, where black represents proficiency in the selected martial art. With respect to lean a type of degree awarded through 6 σ, also intended to represent proficiency, although there are also many degree mills. There are also other colors like yellow and green belts below, and master black belts on top. See also my post on Six Sigma.\n\nBlame Game: In many companies a deeply ingrained habit. After encountering a problem the first priority is to look for someone to blame. It doesn’t matter if the person is truly to blame or not, important for the career is that there is “someone else” to blame for. This blame game often takes priority over actual Problem Solving.\n\nBOM (Bill of Materials): Complete list of materials including part type and quantity that are needed to produce a part or product. The combination of multiple BOM’s makes a tree structure.\n\nBOSCARD (Background, Objectives, Scope, Constraints, Assumptions, Risks and Deliverables): Strategic planning tool that originated in consulting in the 1980’s, describing the items to consider for a new project. See Quad of Aims and SIPOC Diagram for a similar tool.\n\nBottleneck: Process in the system that limits the total quantity or the capacity passing through the system. In manufacturing, this is usually a process, but sometimes also a supplier or even the customer (that does not buy enough of your products). Due to fluctuations like breakdowns etc. most bottlenecks in manufacturing are shifting bottlenecks, i.e. they change over time, sometimes even rapidly. Hence, I distinguish between a momentary bottleneck and a long-term bottleneck. The momentary bottleneck is the process that right now limits the capacity, the long-term bottlenecks are the processes that influence the bottleneck overall more than others. There may be more than one bottleneck in the long term, and even more than one in the short term. Most industry bottleneck detection methods are flawed as they do not consider shifting bottlenecks. For shop floor bottleneck detection I recommend the Bottleneck Walk developed by me, for simulation-based bottleneck detection I recommend the Active Period Method, also developed by me. See also my posts on About Shifting Bottlenecks and Common Bottleneck Detection Methods that do NOT work! See also my series on Bottleneck Management.\n\nBottleneck Walk: Method to find the momentary Bottleneck by observation of processes and inventories and deducing the direction of the bottleneck based on these observations. Very shop floor friendly, since it requires no math and no time taking. Disclaimer: Method was developed by me. See also my posts on The Bottleneck Walk – Practical Bottleneck Detection Part 1 and The Bottleneck Walk – Practical Bottleneck Detection Part 2.\n\nBowling Chart: A type of tracking sheet sometimes used in project management or for ramping up of a new system. For each of one or more KPI, there are two rows: the actual value for a selected time (monthly, weekly, daily), and the target value. This is often used for ramp-ups, and hence the target is not constant. For example, if your goal for a new production line is 100 pieces per hour in 5 months, your monthly target may be 0; 10; 30; 70; 90; and finally 100 pieces per hour for each month. If the actual value is better than the target, it is marked in green, otherwise in red. Yellow can be used for a close miss.\n\nBPMN (Business Process Model and Notation): System for a graphical representation of business processes. Rectangles represent activities, diamonds are decisions and branches, and circles are events. Can represent all kinds of business processes, but may be suboptimal to VSM for manufacturing processes. See Swim Lane Diagram for an alternative or variation thereof.\n\nBrainstorming: Idea generation process developed by Alex F. Osborn and Charles Hutchison Clark. Basically, a group of people brings up ideas on how to solve a problem, which then are grouped and sorted. One of the most popular creativity techniques, although in my view there are often better methods. See also my post on How to Do Brainstormings.\n\nBrownfield: General phrase for an already existing production system or factory that is updated or modified. These changes are usually subject to the constraints of the already existing building or machines, like an unsuitable layout, pillars in unpractical places, too narrow doors or driveways, etc. Often, it is nicely phrased that buildings or facilities that are no longer well suited to the needs of the system inside are “historically grown”. Opposite of Greenfield.\n\nBubble Diagram: Diagram showing only the material flow using bubbles for parts connected with lines. Unlike VSM this is not showing the information flow and hence allows more detail on the material flow. See also my post on Bubble Diagrams.\n\nBucket Brigade: Sometimes also known as “bump-back” or “bouncing line”. Elegant self-organizing method to solve the problem of uneven workloads on a production line. Every worker walks with his part along the line until he meets the next worker or the end of the line. Then the worker walks back until he meets the preceding worker (or the beginning of the line) and takes over the part. The cycle repeats. A worker with little workload will handle more processes, a worker with lots of workload fewer. If there is a problem the other workers can keep working until all of them arrive at the problem spot and can help. Requires (among other things) short cycle times, and hence is often used in pick-and-place or commissioning of materials. See also See also Rabbit Chase and Baton Touch. See also my posts The Lean Bucket Brigade – Part 1: Overview and The Lean Bucket Brigade – Part 2: Details and Caveats.\n\nBuffer: Used to decouple fluctuations or unevenness (Mura). Usually means a type of inventory or buffer stock, but could also be a capacity buffer. See also my post The Three Fundamental Ways to Decouple Fluctuations.\n\nBuilt-in-Quality (品質の作り込み; hinshitsu no tsukurikomi; for 品質, hinshitsu, material quality and 作り込み, tsukurikomi, manufacturing.): Designing and manufacturing products in high quality. Producing good parts in the first place rather than checking for defective parts afterward. No defective products are passed to the next station. See also Jikotei Kanketsu, Poka Yoke, and Baka Yoke.\n\nBullwhip Effect: Effect of small fluctuations in demand magnifying along the value chain and generating losses through increasingly larger demand swings. Can be avoided through Pull. Also known as demand amplification, or the Forrester effect after its first publication by Jay Forrester.\n\nBurabura Shain (ぶらぶら: Burabura: strolling, aimlessly, roaming, wandering; 社員: Shain: Company Employee): Concept from Seven Eleven where an employee is wandering around in the store interacting with customers to learn more about the customer’s needs, the store’s performance, and generally about the business. Part of the concept of Ba.\n\nC\n\nC/O (Change Over, also sometimes abbreviated CO, or called Set Up): Change of the machine setting from one product to another product. See also Change Over Time for how to measure it, and SMED for improving it.\n\nCAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management): Certification offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI) with a particular focus on project management.\n\nCardboard Engineering: Creating a mock-up of a new workplace or line from cardboard. Works best for workplaces or lines that include manual work. The workers rearrange and change the cardboard layout to fit the future line to their needs. This is also good for team building. Only useful if there is no existing line yet. Sometimes also called 3 P. See also my series of posts on Cardboard Engineering.\n\nCargo Cult Science: Term coined by Richard Feynman for approaches that look scientific, but in reality has nothing to do with science but merely copy what other people do without understanding. There is usually little chance of success. Named after the cargo cult in Melanesia, where during World War II the Stone Age technology islanders built straw mock airplanes, straw airports, and straw radios in the hope that real airplanes land and deliver goods as they did for the American soldiers. Common but usually doomed to fail approach in Lean Manufacturing. See also Lean Religion.\n\nCCPM (Critical Chain Project Management): Method for managing the Bottleneck in project management. Developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt (1947 – 2011).\n\nCellular manufacturing: Workplace design based on the similarity between part types, where all operations for a product family are in close proximity (the cell), greatly improving material and information flow. Machines are grouped based on the family of similar part types, and the manufacturing system is divided into cells of similar part types. See also Assembly Cell.\n\nChaku-Chaku (ちゃくちゃくライン, 着々ライン, “arriving”, but also after the sound of the process): Type of production where an operator loads the machines and starts the process before moving to the next machine(s). The machine works independently and ejects the part afterward before the worker loops back to the machine. A variant of Multi-Machine-Handling. See also my post The Chaku Chaku Line.\n\nChalk Circle: Also called “circle exercise” or “standing in the circle”. Exercise and teaching method famous with Taiichi Ohno. At a location of interest, a circle is drawn on the ground using chalk. A person (engineer, lean trainee, etc.) is put in there, with the instruction to watch. Every now and then the coach stops by and asks what the person has seen. This exercise usually takes a few hours before the coach is satisfied with what the person has seen. See also Kizuki. See also my post Taiichi Ohno’s Chalk Circle.\n\nChange Agent: Person in charge of driving a lean transformation (Kaizen). Often suboptimal Western concept, since one person – often with little management power – can rarely change an organization. Often an outside expert in lean. At Toyota, Kaizen is part of their culture; hence they usually do not have a dedicated change agent.\n\nChange Over Time: Time for changing a process or system from producing one product to another product. Sometimes also called Set Up Time. This is defined as the time between the completion of the last good part in full speed of the previous product till the completion of the first good part in full speed of the next product. Ideally the time is zero to allow One Piece Flow. See also SMED for optimizing the change over time.\n\nCOBACABANA (Control of Balance by Card Based Navigation): An approach to manage a job-shop workload of custom orders using paper cards. So far only theoretical, as I know of no implementation. Feels a bit too complex for my taste. However, I like the paper-based idea. See also my post Production Control with COBACABANA.\n\nContinuous Flow: Closely related and overlapping with One Piece Flow. The idea is to produce one item at a time and move it to the next process right after completion.\n\nCONWIP (Constant Work in Progress): A type of production control similar to Kanban, but without a fixed part number assigned to the card. See also my series of posts starting with Basics of CONWIP Systems.\n\nCritical Path (CP): also known as “Critical Path Method” (CPM). Identifies the sequence of steps that are critical to the overall Lead Time. Originated with TOC. Usually ignores fluctuations and uncertainty.\n\nCustomer Takt: Takt Time of the customer, calculated by dividing the total work time during a period by the number of parts requested by the customer (prediction or historical data). See also System Takt.\n\nCycle Time: Fastest repeatable time of a process (not the average time for a process). This cycle time does not include any losses. Can be determined for example by taking the 10th or 25th percentile of a set of measurements, although this is not clearly defined. If losses are included the resulting time is a Takt Time. See also my posts How to Measure Cycle Times – Part 1, How to Measure Cycle Times – Part 2, and Cycle Times for Manual Processes.\n\nD\n\nDandorigae (段取り替え or だんどりがえ, sometimes shortened to だんがえ): Flexible set up change of a machine to produce parts in lot size one as needed. For example, an Injection molding machine may change the tool (die) after every part depending on what part is needed next. Toyota and Denso are using this already on some of their assembly lines, e.g. for molding of car bumpers.\n\nDantotsu (mashed-together word from Danzen 断然 for firmly, absolutely, definitely, extremely; and the English word Top using Japanese pronunciation.): An internal program at Denso to become the best of the best. Trying to never be in the second place whatever you do. This is especially applied to Lean. Please note that Dantotsu is a Denso-internal word and not part of the western lean vocabulary.\n\nDashboard: Also known as cockpit. Summarizing all relevant KPI of a process or system on one page. May contain different charts. Often used by middle and higher management to get a view of the current state on the shop floor. Has the risk of incorrect or manipulated data. Genchi Genbutsu is needed to verify if the data is correct.\n\nDBR (Drum-Buffer-Rope): Scheduling and production planning approach based on TOC. Developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt (1947 – 2011). See also my post on DBR.\n\nDDMRP (Demand Driven MRP): Supposedly a method combining MRP and pull systems, although it seems to be mainly a software package. Promoted with claims that seem to be too good to be true to me, although I have not yet tried it myself. Even though they claim it is pull, it looks to me like it is just a fancier version of push.\n\nDelivery Performance: Delivery performance aims to measure the reliability of satisfying customer orders both by the quantity and timewise, i.e. on time in full (OTIF) or in full on time. It is usually given as a percentage of e.g. 93% of the deliveries were delivered in full and on time. Disagreement exists in industry if a too early delivery is counted as good or not, which tolerances are allowed around the scheduled delivery date, and if the scheduled delivery date is the first date requested by the customer or the date agreed on between customer and supplier based on the supplier’s capabilities. Overall, it is a frequently fudged number.\n\nDeming, W. Edwards (October 14, 1900 – December 20, 1993): Quality management expert. Very influential in teaching quality control to the Japanese after World War II and hence influencing the Toyota Production System. Better known but in my view less influential than Joseph M. Juran. The famous Japanese quality award “Deming prize” awarded by JUSE is named after him.\n\nDesign Freeze (DF): Time during the product development process at which the design of the product is no longer changed, and the focus is on creating a manufacturing system for the product. Changing the design afterwards causes significant additional work for the manufacturing preparations. While most companies use design freezes during development, design changes after the design freeze are unfortunately still common.\n\nDFMA (Design for Manufacturing and Assembly): Development approach where the manufacturing and assembly problems are already taken into consideration when designing the part. Sometimes also only for assembly (DFA) or manufacturing/manufacturability (DFM). See also my series of posts starting with Design for Manufacturing and Assembly Basics!\n\nDFSS (Design for Six Sigma): Tool of 6 σ to design a product in a way to ensure good quality. See also DFMA.\n\nDigital Twin: Expression used in Industry 4.0 for the representation of a real world system in cyber space, in particular in manufacturing. Sometimes also called a digital shadow.\n\nDiseconomies of scale: Opposite of Economies of Scale, where costs go up as companies become bigger. This is usually due to the effort of keeping all employees and processes aligned and informed, and also the increase of inter-organizational politics, where career building is more important than the company’s success. The more employees a company has, the more difficult it will be to keep everybody informed and motivated. Larger corporations have whole departments that seem to be mostly busy with themselves or even creating more work for others, e.g. the department that is in charge of the company color and logo.\n\nDMADV (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify): Variant of DMAIC focused more on the development of new products or processes. Also originated from the 6 σ set of methods.\n\nDMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control): Improvement cycle similar to PDCA, but more focus on analyzing the available data. Originated from the 6 σ set of methods. See also DMADV. See also my overview of PDCA variants at The Many Flavors of the PDCA.\n\nDOE (Design of Experiments): Design of experiments to maximize the understanding of the system with the minimum number of experiments needed using statistical tools. Very similar and overlapping with Taguchi method by Genichi Taguchi.\n\nDOWNTIME (Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Not Utilizing talent, Transportation, Inventory excess, Motion waste, Excess Production): Besides the obvious meaning of an idle process, it is also an abbreviation of the 7 Types of Waste (Muda) including the popular 8th type of “not utilizing talent” (more commonly known as “wasted creativity”).\n\nDPM (Defects per Million): A measurement of defect rates as the number of defects per million parts. Pretty much synonymous with PPM.\n\nDQC (Delivery, Quality, Cost): Variant of QCD, where the sequence is changed to emphasize the priority of delivery performance. Promoted by lean consultant Hitoshi Takeda.\n\nE\n\nEarliest Due Date (EDD): Measure based on the due date used to prioritize work. The job with the earliest due date takes priority. See also Operation Due Date.\n\nEconomies of Scale: Cost benefits from increasing the size of an operation (production, service, etc.). The constant fixed costs are distributed across more products sold and hence become smaller on a per-product basis. May also include more market power when bargaining with suppliers or customers. Opposite of Diseconomies of scale, which may outweigh the economies of scale for very large companies.\n\nECR (Engineering Change Request): Also Engineering Change Order ECO or Engineering Change Instruction ECI. Request or order to implement an engineering change to a product to improve the product (reduce cost, fix a problem, or generally improve). A large number of ECR can create havoc with a manufacturing system.\n\nECRS (eliminate, combine, rearrange, simplify): Framework within TWI to optimize and improve processes. Was (one of) the inputs for the Toyota QDC method, which was renamed by Shigeo Shingo into SMED.\n\nEFQM Excellence Model (European Foundation for Quality Management Excellence Model): European non-profit organization with the aim to improve quality management that developed a framework for quality management and general Operational Excellence. It uses a whole set of different models including eight core values that a company should have (Adding value for customer, creating sustainable future, and so on … all true but very fuzzy and in my view not of much use for a practical approach), nine different criteria (leadership, people, strategies, … again rather fuzzy) and a PDCA variant called RADAR for Results, Approaches, Deployment, and Assess and Refine. So far I am not impressed, but there are lots of training and an EFQM Excellence Award.\n\nEngineer to Order (ETO): General term for items that are designed only for a specific customer order. See also Make to Order, Make to Stock, Purchase to Order, and Purchase to Stock.\n\nEnglish System of Manufacturing: First approach to Mass Production during the industrial revolution in England. Significant use of mechanization, but without interchangeable parts. Often still extensively based on the skills of the machine operators. Made obsolete by the American system of manufacturing.\n\nEOQ (Economic order quantity): A mathematical approach to minimize total inventory holding costs and ordering costs. Theoretically perfect, but in practice hampered by uncertainty, fluctuations, and rapid change of customer demands or process capacity. In lean manufacturing, Pull is often considered a better alternative.\n\nEPEI (Every Part Every Interval): A structured approach to produce all (high runner) parts every interval. The interval can be a fixed time period (e.g. all high runners have to be produced once per week), or a flexible period based on demand. Common is that all (high runner) parts have exactly one production run before the cycle starts again. Less common exotic parts are not produced every interval. The idea is to move production towards smaller lot sizes (the interval should be as short as feasible) and to create leveling (Heijunka). See also the Fixed Repeating Schedule for an almost identical approach. This approach requires a stable production system to work.\n\nERP (Enterprise resource planning): Business management software to track all data related to business, including production, development, marketing, shipping, etc. This is a further development of MRP. Major companies/Software tools are SAP and Oracle.\n\nF\n\nFACTUAL (Focus, Approach, Converge, Test, Understand, Apply, Leverage): Problem-solving approach of the Shainin System, somewhat similar to the much better known PDCA. See also my overview of PDCA variants at The Many Flavors of the PDCA.\n\nFake Lean: Activities that look like Lean, but lack understanding and commitment, and are often done primarily to please higher-ups with activities while not having the knowledge, time, or resources to actually do real improvement. See also Lean Religion.\n\nFayolism: (Outdated) management theory by Henri Fayol (1841–1925), a contemporary of Frederick Winslow Taylor. In the spirit of the time, the theory is geared very much towards command and control, lacking nowadays important aspects like employee development, employee empowerment, or an idea suggestion system.\n\nFBS (Final Build Sequence): At Toyota the sequence of the cars to be built in the next week. This is a fixed short-term version of the TBS. Based on the FBS, a FRS is generated.\n\nFIFO (First In First Out): A type of material flow with a defined upper limit and a FIFO principle used for Pull systems. Sometimes also called First Come First Served FCFS. Opposite of the much less common LIFO. See also my posts on FIFO as well as Delivery Sequences: FIFO, LIFO, and Others..\n\nFirst Time Through (FTT, also first time yield FTY, First Time Right FTR, or First Time Through Yield): Percentage of products that are produced correctly without defects or rework. It is calculated by dividing the number of good products by the total number of products produced. Anything that needs any kind of fixing or repairs after completion is not counted towards this percentage. The opposite would be the defect rate, although the defect rate can be calculated both before rework and after rework.\n\nFISH (First In Still Here): Informal and sarcastic abbreviation for inventory that is sitting around for an excessively long time, maybe due to obsolescence or simply bad inventory management. Is based on the proper abbreviations FIFO and LIFO.\n\nFish Bone Diagram: Also known as Cause and Effect diagram or Ishikawa Diagram. Tool to determine the possible root causes of an effect. Usually, it is drawn with the effect under consideration on one side (the head of the fish), a horizontal line going out from the effect (the spine), and different lines going out from the spine (the bones). The bones represent different possible causes. These can be based on a standard set, e.g. man, machine, material, method; or can be customized. See 4 M for this and other possible standard sets. Each “bone” is discussed in the group and possible causes are added to the individual bones. For example, when looking for the cause of quality problems, one bone machine could have comments like “insufficient maintenance”, “broken tool”, etc. See also my post on Fishbone Diagrams and Mind Maps.\n\nFixed Repeating Schedule: Production program pattern that is repeated unchangingly for a number of iterations before the pattern is adapted to changing demands. Part of Heijunka. Closely related and sometimes synonymous with Every Part Every Interval (EPEI or EPEx). See also my posts Theory of Every Part Every Interval (EPEI) Leveling, Also Known as Heijunka and The Folly of EPEI Leveling in Practice.\n\nFlexible Manpower Line: General term for a production line where the capacity can be adjusted by adding or removing workers. A gender neutral term would be “flexible staffing line”. See also Shoujinka. See also my series of posts starting with Flexible Manpower Lines 1 – Introduction!\n\nFlexible Manufacturing System (FMS): A flexible manufacturing system aims to produce different products on the same system. See also Agile, Reconfigurable, Robust, Adaptable, and Holonic manufacturing systems. See also my post Facing Change in Modern Manufacturing Systems.\n\nFlow Shop: General name for a type of manufacturing where the production processes are arranged primarily in a sequence that is needed for the production of the parts. Well suited for Low Mix High Volume and easier to organize and improve than its opposite Job Shop. See also Project Shop. Sometimes also called flow production or process sequence layout. See also my post Organize Your Production Sequence – 3: Flow Shop.\n\nFMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis): Method to estimate the probability, severity, detection likelihood and impact of problems with products in order to focus on the most serious problems first.\n\nFocused Factory: Manufacturing plant (or section thereof) that is focused on a narrow range of products or services. By focusing on a limited number of tasks, the performance for these tasks can be improved easier. Concept developed by Wickham Skinner around 1970.\n\nFordism: Type of Mass Production established by Henry Ford, in particular for his Model T. Focus is on relentless optimization for Mass Production of one good (e.g. the Ford Model T). Its weakness is its inflexibility.\n\nForming Storming Norming Performing: Phases of group development first used by Bruce Tuckman 1965 (1938-2016). Seems to be valid for many group developments. Forming is the creating of the group, with the members being quite independently. Storming is the creation and exchange of opinions on the goals and approach. This may include clashes within the group. In Norming these clashes are resolved and the group learns how to work together. Finally performing is then a group that works together towards a common goal. Not all groups reach the performing stage.\n\nFour Line Diary (4行日記 yon gyo nikki: four line diary): Similar to YWT, this is a sort of diary entry developed by Yoshihiro Kobayashi to learn and improve every day. It includes 4 main points: 1) Facts: What happened. 2) Discovery: What insights did we get from the facts, what did we notice? 3) Lessons Learned: What did we learn from the insights and facts; and 4) Declaration: What do I want to do in the future. See also YWT, KPT, PDCA, and AAR.\n\nFRS (Final Requirement Sheet): List of required parts to produce according to the FBS.\n\nG\n\nGantt Chart: Bar chart to visualize a project schedule. Named after Henry Gantt, a protégé of Frederick Winslow Taylor, but also independently and earlier developed in Poland by Karol Adamiecki. Also known slightly modified and expanded as PERT or Activity Network Diagram.\n\nGemba (現場, actual spot, scene of the crime, shop floor): The actual place where the action occurs, usually in contrast to paper presentations and number data. In manufacturing, this usually refers to the shop floor. Sometimes also written as Genba. See also Gemba Walk. While the word is somewhat similar to Genchi, Gemba is more an actual location whereas Genchi is closer in meaning to locally.\n\nGemba Walk: Western term for visiting Gemba. Usually refers to a visit to the shop floor to see the actual situation rather than an Excel sheet or PowerPoint slide claiming to be the actual situation.\n\nGenbutsu (現物, actual article or object): Philosophy to see the actual items, rather than have data and presentations about it. Sometimes also written as Gembutsu.\n\nGenchi (現地, actual place, actual location, local, on-site, locally): Part of Genchi Genbutsu for the actual place. Sometimes also part of the 3 R.\n\nGenchi Genbutsu (現地: actual place; 現物: actual article or object): Toyota philosophy to go and see the actual place where the events happen and the actual items/goods/machines. Sometimes also written as Genchi Gembutsu. Based on the words Genchi for the actual place and Genbutsu for the actual article. See also my post on Visit the Shop Floor or Your People Will Fool You! – Genchi Genbutsu.\n\nGenjitsu (現実, Reality): Referring to the real or actual situation. Toyota philosophy to go and see the actual facts and conditions.\n\nGenka Teigen (原価 低減 for cost or price and decrease; reduction; fall; depreciation; mitigation): Literally translates as cost cutting, but may be more cost management. The term “cost cutting” in the west has a very negative connotation for ruthlessness, but at Toyota this is more a way to reduce cost through Just in Time, Jidoka , and other lean tools.\n\nGoldratt, Eliyahu Moshe (March 31, 1947 – June 11, 2011): Israeli business management guru, famous for Drum Buffer Rope, Critical Chain Project Management and Theory of Constraints. Some consider him to be a genius; others are more skeptical about his achievements. Regardless of which, he had the ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms.\n\nGood Thinking, Good Products (よい品よい考, yoi shina, yoi kangae): Well-known Toyota company slogan introduced by Eiji Toyoda to promote the Toyota Creative Ideas and Suggestions System (TCISS). In a philosophical sense represents the Toyota Production System.\n\nGozinto Graph (Cacography of “goes into”): Sort of a bubble diagram to show which parts go into which sub-components, components, and eventually final products. The graph includes quantities and therefore gives an overview of what is needed for which products. See also Gozinto Matrix.\n\nGozinto Matrix (Cacography of “goes into”): Matrix with a row for each part and a column for each final product. Used to determine which parts (purchased or produced) are most relevant for the production system. This was created by the mathematician Andrew Vazsonyi, who credited as the source a fictitious Italian mathematician Zepartzat Gozinto, which means nothing else than “The Part that Goes Into“. See also Gozinto Matrix.\n\nGreenfield: General phrase for a new production system or factory, where everything is designed from scratch. Gives more freedom and possibilities to suit the buildings and facilities to its exact purpose, since often quite literally at the beginning there is only a green field on which a new factory is constructed. The higher flexibility usually comes with a higher initial cost compared to the opposite Brownfield.\n\nH\n\nHanedashi (はね出し, to jump; to leap; to spring up): Automatic unloading of items. See also Chaku-Chaku.\n\nHansei (反省, reflection): Sequence of self-reflection, taking responsibility, and committing to improvement.\n\nHarada Method: Method to enhance employee development. Actively promoted and containing some useful ideas in self-management, but high buzzword value. Named after Takashi Harada (原田 隆史), a former middle school track and field coach in Osaka. Includes 33 questions for self-reliance, a 64 field chart, and other diagrams.\n\nHawthorne Effect: Effect of a system improving merely because it is observed. Often generates the appearance of improvement, but will revert to its former performance soon after the project is over. Also known as the observer effect. Named after its first study at the Hawthorne Works in Illinois.\n\nHeijunka (平準化, leveling, harmonization): Leveling or production smoothing, with the goal to minimize fluctuations. Different methods can be used to smoothen production. See for example Fixed Repeating Schedule. See also my posts on Leveling.\n\nHeijunka Box: Box in which Kanban cards are put to visualize the leveling (Heijunka) pattern. Disconnected managers believe they are running a lean plant if these boxes are on the shop floor.\n\nHeinrich Accident Triangle: Also known as Heinrich Principle, Heinrich Pyramid or Heinrich Law, established by US safety pioneer Herbert William Heinrich (1886-1962). It shows how serious accidents with major injuries, minor accidents, and near misses (“almost” accidents) are related. Statistically, for 300 near misses, there are 29 minor accidents, for which there is one serious accident. Hence, to reduce serious accidents you have to work on reducing minor accidents and near misses.\n\nHidden Factory: Two overlapping meanings. (1) Processes that are not part of the standard or officially sanctioned, but done anyway by the operators to make the system work or their life easier (e.g. keeping a hidden stock of parts that are often short in supply, which makes the life of the operator easier, but in this case the overall situation worse). (2) Friction and losses in the Value Stream that create cost but cannot be clearly measured or attributed to any cause. Often simply defined as “overhead”.\n\nHigh Mix Low Volume (HMLV): Production program with many different variants in small quantities. Opposite of Low Mix High Volume.\n\nHIPPO’s (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion): Usually what everybody agrees to at the end of a meeting (In case you’re wondering – Yes, that is sarcastic, but unfortunately all too often true).\n\nHitozukuri (人作り, making people): Philosophy of developing people. Rather than education, this approach considers the lifelong education, training, and coaching of people as part of any excellent workplace. See also Monozukuri and less commonly Kotozukuri. See also Takumi.\n\nHolonic Manufacturing System: Autonomous and self-reliant manufacturing system. Initially used in 1990 for systems that can adapt to new products, research now talks about self-adjusting systems. See also Flexible, Agile, Reconfigurable, Robust, and Adaptable manufacturing systems. See also my post Facing Change in Modern Manufacturing Systems.\n\nHoshin Kanri (方針管理, policy management): Policy deployment, or how to set consistent targets throughout the hierarchy levels of an enterprise. Sometimes also called strategy deployment. In contrast, see Nichijou Kanri for daily management. See also my series of posts starting with Hoshin Kanri – Part 1: The To-Do List.\n\nHourensou (ほうれんそう or 報連相. Abbreviation of houkoku: ほうこく or 報告, to report, to inform; renraku: れんらく or 連絡, to contact, to message; and soudan: そうだん or 相談, consultation, discussion. It is also the Japanese word ほうれんそう, which means Spinach.): Mnemonic in Japan for an approach to smooth communication. The three words stand for a report by a subordinate, which should include all relevant information. Next, all stakeholders are informed about the current status. The third word refers to discuss with others on the next steps, decisions, and actions. The idea is to do it frequently. The method does not originate from Toyota but from a financial firm around 1982. The opinion on this is divided. Some believe the frequent communication will improve business processes, others believe that this has a too high demand for the work time of both employees and managers. See also Yokoten and Nemawashi.\n\nHyōjun Sagyō (標準 Hyōjun: Standard, Level, Norm; 作業 Sagyō: work; operation; manufacturing): Japanese Term for a Work Standard. The kanji shown here are used by Toyota, but other companies as for example Nissan use slightly different kanji.\n\nI\n\nIceberg Model: Also called Iceberg Culture, or simply pictured as an iceberg. The idea is that the visible problems or statements only make up a small part of the entire set of problems and that there are many more problems, issues, feelings, and other things hidden beneath. The analogy is an iceberg, where only 10% is visible above the water, but 90% are invisible below the water.\n\nIchi Nin Ku (一人工 for one person worker): Japanese philosophy or concept that the work should match the capacity of the worker. A worker should get as much work as he can do in a day, not more, not less.\n\nImprovement KPI (Improvement Key Performance Indicator): KPI to measure improvement of projects. Can be based on Monitoring KPI. Seems to be redundant with just plain old “KPI”. This expression is rarely used. Difference between Monitoring KPI and Improvement KPI often ill-defined and confused. In my view using just KPI is good enough for most cases.\n\nIndustry 4.0: German government program to promote new developments related to computers in industry. Exact content is a bit fuzzy but includes especially the internet of things and cyber-physical systems. A major buzzword in Germany since 2013, but often with little to show for. See also my posts A Critical Look at Industry 4.0 and Industry 4.0 – What Works, What Doesn’t.\n\nInformation Flow: Flow of the information through the Value Stream. One of the key points to optimize in Lean Manufacturing, for example, to achieve the goal of Pull production. Often combined with Material Flow. Note that the material flow can also overlap with the information flow, as for example in a FIFO the material is also the information on what to produce next.\n\nInterrelationship Digraph (ID): Variant of cause and effect diagrams. One of the 7 Management and Planning Tools by JUSE.\n\nIshikawa Diagram: Named after Kaoru Ishikawa (石川馨), but pretty much the same as a Fish Bone Diagram. Most such diagrams have 4, 6, or 8 standard “bones”. See 4 M for details.\n\nISO 18404: Standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to certify organizations and individuals in 6 σ and/or Lean. In my view like similar ISO norms (e.g. ISO 9001 for quality) it seems to be mostly a money making thing by selling certificates without really changing the quality of the underlying Lean or Six Sigma. Luckily, so far this is not (yet) accepted by the Lean community, and hopefully never will be. See also my post Lean Standard ISO 18404 – A Questionable Idea ….\n\nItem Specific Dunnage: Dunnage, in general, is inexpensive filler material for packaging. Item-specific dunnage is cut to fit exactly one type of part. This could be blisters (similar to the plastic trays for pralines where each praline has an indent fitting this praline) or cut out foam to match the shape of the parts. With this item specific dunnage, it is easy to get exactly the right number of parts in a box. Hence it is also a way for Visual Management.\n\nJ\n\nJI (Job Instructions): TWI component focusing on how to train inexperienced workers faster. See also my post on JI: Training within Industry – Job Instructions.\n\nJi Kotei Kanketsu (自工程完結 with ji for self; kotei for process, operation; and kanketsu for conclusion, completion. Often abbreviated as JKK.): Japanese term often translated as build quality with ownershipo. The idea is to have the operator not only work a process, but take ownership, in particular but not only for quality. This requires him to have the training, rights and tools to do so. Does the worker understand the implications of his work on others? Can he change the standard? This is closely related to Built-in-Quality.\n\nJi Koutei Kanketsu (Abbreviated as JKK; 自工程完結 for self; process or operation; and conclusion or completion): Concept at Toyota that gives every worker its own responsibility for their work, both in quality and efficiency. It may also be seen as an approach to take pride in their work.\n\nJidoka (自働化, Autonomation): (Semi-) intelligent machines or processes that stop by itself if a problem occurs. It is a Japanese play on words on automation, which sounds identical, but has slightly different kanji, 自動化, where for automation the middle kanji has an additional radical indicating people. See also my posts What Exactly Is Jidoka?, The Philosophy and Practicality of Jidoka, and Examples of Jidoka.\n\nJikigataken (じきがたけん): Word used by Denso (Toyota Group) since 1974 for concurrent engineering or simultaneous engineering.\n\nJinbou (じんぼうor 人望 for popularity): One of the aspects of Toyota for the evaluation of its managers is Jinbou or trust, also often translated as “personal magnetism”. This represents the level of trust subordinates have in their manager, and how much trust a manager is able to win from its subordinates. By its nature, this aspect is hard to quantify. This aspect contributes 10% to the overall manager evaluation. See Toyota Manager Evaluation for more.\n\nJinzai Katsuyou (人材 or じんざい for human resources or personnel; and 活用 or かつよう for practical use): Ability not only utilize but also develop the available human resources. The goal is to make the best out of its employees. One of the five aspects of the Toyota Manager Evaluation.\n\nJishuken (自主権, autonomy): Management driven improvement activities. Managers identify the areas of improvement.\n\nJM (Job Methods): TWI component focusing on how to evaluate work and how to suggest improvements. See also my post on JM: Training within Industry – Job Methods.\n\nJob Enrichment: Approach to motivate employees by giving them higher-level responsibilities in order to increase satisfaction and to reduce the feeling of being an unimportant cog in the machine driven by other forces. Originally developed by American psychologist Frederick Herzberg around 1968.\n\nJob Shop: General name for a type of manufacturing where the production processes are not arranged in a sequence that is needed for the production of the parts. Instead, they are often arranged by their primary function (e.g. a welding department, a milling department, the lathe department …). Usually found with High Mix Low Volume and more difficult to organize and improve than its opposite Flow Shop. Sometimes also called process village layout. See also Project Shop. See also my post Organize Your Production Sequence – 2: Job Shop and my series of posts Why Are Job Shops Always Such a Chaotic Mess? and How to Convert a Job Shop into a Flow Shop !\n\nJR (Job Relation): TWI component teaching supervisors on how to deal with workers fair, respectfully and effectively. See also my post on JR: Training within Industry – Job Relations.\n\nJundate (順建て jundate: Picking parts; short for 順序建てjunsho date: order, sequence, procedure, and commitment): Japanese term at Toyota for the way of setting up parts for assembly. Usually involves Kitting. See also SPS.\n\nJuran, Joseph M. (December 24, 1904 – February 28, 2008): Quality management expert. Very influential in teaching quality control to the Japanese after World War II and hence influencing the Toyota Production System. While less known than W. Edwards Deming, in my view Juran was more influential. See also my post 115 Years after the Birth of Joseph Juran!\n\nJUSE (Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers): Japanese group for the advancement of science and technology, founded after World War II. Awards the famous Deming prize.\n\nJust in Sequence (JIS): Delivery of products in the exact sequence they are needed. In automotive sometimes also called In Line Vehicle Sequence (ILVS). See also my post series on Just in Sequence Part as well as an example post on Just in Time at Hyundai Mobis in Korea.\n\nJust in Time (JIT): Delivery of goods exactly at the time when they are needed, in the quantity they are needed, and in good quality. In proper English grammar this would be just on time, but in Lean just in time is used. See also my series of posts starting with What Is “Just in Time”?.\n\nK\n\nKadai Souzouryoku (課題 or かだい for subject; theme; issue; matter; and 創造 or そうぞうりょく for creative power; creativity.): Ability to identify core problems. One of the five aspects of the Toyota Manager Evaluation.\n\nKaiaku (改悪, changing for the worse): Making things worse despite best intentions to improve. Unfortunately all too common with lean manufacturing in the west.\n\nKaidai Suikou (課題 or かだい for subject; theme; issue; matter; and 遂行 or すいこう for accomplishment; execution;): Ability to carry out tasks and see them through to the end. One of the five aspects of the Toyota Manager Evaluation.\n\nKaikaku (改革, reform): Fundamental and radical changes. See also Kakushin. Part of Kaizen.\n\nKaizen (改善, Continuous improvement): Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement. Sometimes also abbreviated as CPI for continuous process improvement. See also my post What Is Kaizen?!\n\nKaizen Blitz: Two meanings: 1) Short and fast improvement (Kaizen) activities to solve easy-to-solve problems. Introduced by the AME (association for manufacturing excellence) in 1994. Most often found in the 6 σ brand of lean. Sometimes, this is also called a “5-day Kaizen”, based on Japanese experts visiting the US for a one-week trip. While there are some problems in Lean that can be solved quickly, most require more time for analysis, implementation, and especially confirmation that it works. Hence, a Kaizen Blitz or Kaizen Event may work, but most of the time would be insufficient to solve a problem. 2) Marker on a Value Stream Map to indicate an improvement idea.\n\nKaizen Event: Generally any type of event or activity aimed towards improvement (Kaizen) of the situation. Also called Kaizen workshop. Usually applied to events related to Lean. The term was coined by the AME (Association for Manufacturing Excellence) in the 90’s.\n\nKaizen Group: Small team focusing on improvement (Kaizen).\n\nKakushin (革新, reform or innovation): Indicates larger and more radical changes. Often translated as revolutionary changes, but in my view, this would be Kaikaku. Generally part of the improvement process, or Kaizen.\n\nKamishibai (紙芝居, paper drama): Originally Buddhist paper theater performance for children. At Toyota tool for visual management, where cards with audit or problem-related information are on a board. If a card has been turned over, then it is completed. Not turned over cards indicate that the problem has not been solved (yet) or the audit has not yet been performed. Sometimes used together with T-Cards. Sometimes misspelled as Kamishabi.\n\nKanban (看板, signboard): Initially describing the signs above Japanese shops, but with respect to lean nowadays better known as the information in a pull system, usually as kanban cards. Often works with Supermarkets and FIFO lanes. Sometimes further detailed Production Kanban, Transport Kanban, or (less frequently) Triangle Kanban. See also my posts on Anatomy of the Toyota Kanban and Kanban Card Design, as well as many more in my List of Posts.\n\nKansei Engineering (感性工学, kansei kougaku, sensitive or emotional engineering): Product development process with particular attention to the emotions, needs, and feelings of the customer.\n\nKarakuri Kaizen (usually written as からくり, but sometimes also as 絡繰り or 絡繰 (Karakuri) for gimmick, mechanism, machinery, contrivance or device; and 改善 (Kaizen) for Continuous improvement): Using creative but inexpensive mechanisms to transport material without the use of human muscle (but may be initiated by a human movement). The key here is not the use of mechanics, but rather an ingenious technical trick or gizmo. Usually uses little or no electronics. A mere gravity slide would be too simple for Karakuri Kaizen, whereas a full-blown automated system with sensors and actuators would be too complex. In Japan outside of lean the word Karakuri is better known as Karakuri ningyō for (usually historic) mechanical doll. See also my post series starting with Introduction to Karakuri Kaizen.\n\nKaroshi (過労死, Death from overwork): (Mostly) Japanese phenomena of death from overwork, sort of an extreme form of burn out.\n\nKata (型, pattern, form): Originally a choreographed movement in martial arts to teach students behavioral reflexes. In lean an approach coined by the book of the same name by Mike Rother, sometimes also called “Improvement Kata”. The four steps are 1) Understand the challenge/define the long-term target; 2) Understand current condition; 3) Define the short-term target; and 4) move towards the short-term target. This approach should be used for every problem; its repeated usage is the equivalent of the martial arts Kata. A set of questions have been developed to reinforce this approach. The method is loosely based on TWI. See also Shuhari. See also my post Toyota Kata.\n\nKatashiki (型式: Katashiki: Vehicle type or model): General model or type, often used with automobiles. For example, Toyota has an alphanumeric code called Katashiki that details exactly what model and options make up the vehicle. See also the Katashiki Card.\n\nKatashiki Card (型式: Katashiki: Vehicle type or model): Print out at Toyota showing the different options and settings for a specific vehicle. The Katashiki card may indicate if it is a two-door or four-door vehicle, if it has a sunroof, the type of entertainment system, the color, etc. Based on the Katashiki.\n\nKeiretsu (系列, grouping of enterprises): Japanese industry groups of different legally independent companies that are closely connected through both mutual shareholding and business relation. Originated from Zaibatsu, but rather than a controlling family at the top has mutual relationships. There are “horizontal keiretsu” that are financially connected, usually involving a major bank; and vertical keiretsu that link different companies along the Supply Chain (but not to be confused with Kyoryokukai). These systems are rare outside of Japan. Keiretsu reduce the risk of hostile takeovers and limits the influence of stock market fluctuations.\n\nKingman’s formula (sometimes also Kingman’s approximation or – less accurate – equation): Formula to estimate the mean waiting time (or Throughput) of a single process based on the mean and variance of the Cycle Time and arrival time as well as the utilization. Very handy if you need to estimate the waiting times e.g. in a hospital or for a call center. The system has to be steady state, but there are no limitations on the type of distribution for arrival or cycle time. Please be aware that the output is only an approximation, not an exact result. Developed by John Kingman in 1961. See also my posts on The Kingman Formula – Variation, Utilization, and Lead Time and See also my post on A Small Dice Game for the Kingman Formula.\n\nKitting: Providing material to the assembly line in kits. The kitting is the actual process of picking different parts in a larger supermarket (often near the assembly line) in order to provide a set of needed parts to the assembly line. Often used if there are many different part types and space around the assembly line is an issue. See also SPS.\n\nKizuki (気付き, Awareness, Realization): Japanese term for the ability to notice. Based on a verb Kitsuku (気づく, to notice, to recognize, to realize). See also Chalk Circle.\n\nKotozukuri (事作り, making stories): Term used at Nissan to represent “brand storytelling”, with the goal of entering into a dialogue with the customer. Little used outside of Nissan. See also Monozukuri and Hitozukuri.\n\nKPI (Key Performance Indicator): A measurement of performance to understand the overall performance of the system. Abbreviation less commonly also used as “Key Process Improvement” focusing on the most important processes only, or even “Key Process Improvement Indicators”. See also KPR, KPI Tree, Monitoring KPI, and Improvement KPI. Furthermore, see OKR for a slightly different approach. See also my posts on KPI.\n\nKPI Tree (Key Performance Indicator Tree): Hierarchical structure of KPI, where lower level KPI are aggregated into higher level KPI.\n\nKPR (Key performance Resource): Little used term referring to the most significant resources (man, machine, material) needed to achieve KPI.\n\nKPT (Keep, Problem, Try): Approach to summarize learnings at the end of a session/project/day: Keep are the good things that happened and that you want to keep. Problems are issues that are not yet resolved but have to be addressed, and Try are ideas and approaches to resolve these problems. It is longer than a YWT, and can easily take 30 minutes. It is often done in writing on a flipchart or whiteboard. See also YWT, Four Line Diary, PDCA, and AAR.\n\nKyoryokukai (協力会, Suppliers Association): Japanese term for supplier association, where the suppliers of a major customer (often an automotive firm) work closely together to improve Material Flow, Information Flow, quality, and many other aspects of production. They also coordinate improvements activities. They originated with Toyota in the 1930’s. An important difference to western suppliers is that the major customer is not in charge of the group. Instead, these groups are organized by the suppliers. This requires the major customer to give more control to the suppliers. It is claimed that Kyoryokukai outperforms traditional western supply chains.\n\nKYT (Abbreviation for 危険 kiken: Danker, Hazard; 予知 yochi: prediction; 訓練 kunren: training): Standard approach in Japan to find and resolve potentially dangerous OHSA issues. While there are different approaches, 4 steps seem to be popular: 1) Understand the current situation: Point out potential health and safety issues; 2) Understand the causes of the danger.; 3) Plan countermeasure; 4) Set targets and goals.\n\nL\n\nLAMDA (Look, Ask, Model, Discuss, Act): Sort of a PDCA with a particular focus on product development. See also my overview of PDCA variants at The Many Flavors of the PDCA.\n\nLead Time: Total time a part is in the system, also the time a part needs to pass from the beginning to the end. Significant as this is usually also the minimum time needed to produce a product for the customer. Usually, the average value is used. Can be calculated using Little’s Law. Confusingly it is sometimes also called trougput time (which I don’t like much due to confusion with Throughput); or “flow time”. See also my series of post on Reducing Lead Time !\n\nLeader Standard Work: Aims to improve leadership behavior to foster a culture of Kaizen. Also known as or similar to kaizen for management, lean management, or lean leadership. In my view, the Toyota Production System is not excellent because of its methods but because of the excellent management at Toyota. See also Kata.\n\nLeader Standard Work (LSW): Attempt to extend the Standard Work framework to management, trying to give leadership also a clear set of standards on how to behave and what to do. It contains some valuable ideas (e.g. regular shop floor meeting attendance), but in other parts it is very fuzzy and unclear. I find it a bit buzzwordy. See also my post Standards Part 9: Leader Standard Work.\n\nLean: More general term than Lean Manufacturing, which originates in the Toyota Production System. Also applies outside of manufacturing, e.g. lean banking, lean office, lean government, lean military, lean service, lean accounting, lean logistics, lean management, lean product development, lean startup, lean maritime, or any other type of industry or sector that you can think of with the word “Lean” added.\n\nLean 2.0: Part of the general trend to rejuvenate a buzzword (in this case Lean) by simply adding another “version” number to it (Internet 2.0, industry 4.0, web 2.0, …). While lean has been around for decades, it is still in my view the best approach to organize and improve manufacturing and related systems. Lean 2.0 also has no real changes except for a vague promise to fix everything that is wrong in lean (See for example Lean Religion), or simply promise to be better without going into detail on how it actually will be better. In my view, this term is not needed and luckily seems to be little used by real practitioners.\n\nLean consumption: Opposite of Lean Manufacturing or lean production. Sort of Lean for retailing or service providers. Tries to provide the customer exactly what he wants, when he wants it, where he wants it, in good quality, and without wasting the resources of the customer. Possibly a buzzword.\n\nLean Enterprise: Attempt at a re-branding of lean with the goal to provide lean not only in manufacturing but for the entire enterprise. See also Lean Religion.\n\nLean Manufacturing: Both generic term for and based on the Toyota Production System (TPS). Usually used synonymous with Lean Production, although lean manufacturing is more common. The term was coined by John Krafcik. Sometimes also called lean production, and also often abbreviated to Lean. See also Lean Religion.\n\nLean Production: Same as Lean Manufacturing, which is more common.\n\nLean Religion: Implementation of the methods of the Toyota Production System (lean manufacturing) without understanding the causes or reasons. Usually leads to waste due to lots of improvement effort with little results; or even worsening the situation. An example would be management requiring the use of Kanban; hence the shop floor calls every piece of paper Kanban without any resemblance to a Pull system. In effect Lean is treated like a religion, you don’t need to know the details, as long as you do whatever the guru says you will be fine. See also Cargo Cult Science and\n\nFake Lean.\n\nLIFO (Last in, First Out): Opposite of FIFO. This is a type of material flow with a defined upper limit. The sequence, however, is last in first out, i.e. the last part that arrived is the first one that is removed. This approach is rarely used since it has a high risk of parts staying in the system for a long time. Usually only used if storage conditions force this system. I.e. if parts are stacked, the last part stacked on the top is also the first part removed, since it would be difficult to remove the part at the bottom of the stack. Another example: A pile of material (coal, stones, etc.) is both filled and emptied from the top. Hence the material at the very bottom was the first to be added but will be the last to be removed. See also my post Delivery Sequences: FIFO, LIFO, and Others.\n\nLights out Factory: Vision of a factory that is so highly automated that there are normally no workers present at all. Hence, you can turn off the light and the factory keeps on working. Japanese Robot maker FANUC runs lights out factories for up to 30 days at a time, turning off not only the light but also the heating and air conditioning.\n\nLiker, Jeffrey: Jeffrey K. Liker is a Professor of Industrial and Operations Engineering at the University of Michigan and a well-known expert on the Toyota Production System. Among others, he published the 14 Management Principles of The Toyota Way.\n\nLine Balancing: Process of evenly distributing the work across the stations on the line with the goal that every process/worker has approximately the same cycle time. Overall speed (the System Takt) should match the Customer Takt. The difference to the target Cycle Time is the OEE. See also Yamazumi-chart if you prefer a fancy Japanese name. The chart is also sometimes called an “Operator Balance Chart” (OBC), or “Operator Loading Diagram”.\n\nLittle’s Law: Relation between the WIP, the Lead Time, and the average time between parts. The lead time is the WIP multiplied by the average time between parts. Named after John Little, and also used in many instances of probability theory outside of manufacturing. Valid over a wide range of assumptions, and not influenced by the arrival process distribution, the service distribution, or the service order. The most relevant limitation is that the system has to be steady state and should not change over time. See also my post A Eulogy for Little’s Law for more details.\n\nLow Mix High Volume (LMHV): Production program with few product variants which are produced in high volume. Opposite of High Mix Low Volume.\n\nM\n\nMake to Order (MTO): General term of products that are produced only for a specific customer order. Often for High Mix Low Volume production. Often produced in a Job Shop, but Flow Shop production is also sometimes possible. Opposite of Make to Stock. Since you do not have finished goods stock, you cannot decouple fluctuation through finished goods stock, hence the customer usually has to wait until the product is completed, hence decoupling through time. See also Purchase to Order, Engineer to Order, and Purchase to Stock. Depending on the process it may also be called Assemble to Order (ATO) or Fabricate to Order (FTO).\n\nMake to Stock (MTS): General term of products that are produced for an inventory rather than a customer order, and the customer satisfies his demand by taking a part out of the inventory. Possible only for products where a customer demand for this product can be expected, mostly Low Mix High Volume production. Usually produced in a Flow Shop. Opposite of Make to Order. The Advantage of MTS products is that you can decouple fluctuations through your inventory (your stock). See also Purchase to Order, Engineer to Order and Purchase to Stock.\n\nMass Customization: The vision to create individually customized products at mass production cost and prices. I.e. to get a fancy bespoke suit for the price of a mass-produced warehouse suit. Usually still requires large quantities to have some efficiencies of scale. See also my post Strategies for Mass Customization.\n\nMass Production: Production of a large number of identical parts. Through the large quantity, it is possible to benefit from the Economies of Scale. Started in the late 19th century in the USA, for example with matches, cigarettes, and canned food. Often uses an Assembly Line.\n\nMaterial Flow: Flow of the material through the Value Stream. One of the key points to optimize in Lean Manufacturing, for example, to achieve the goal of One Piece Flow. Often combined with Information Flow.\n\nMatrix Diagram: Matrix that shows the relationship between items. Not to be confused with the Prioritization Matrix. One of the 7 Management and Planning Tools by JUSE.\n\nMBO (Management by Objectives): Leadership by giving numerical targets to the subordinates, giving the subordinates the means to achieve this target, and then let the subordinate work to achieve the target results. A method developed by management guru Peter Drucker. See also SMART.\n\nMBWA (Management by Walking Around): Leadership approach that involves walking around through the supervised area for random checks and suggestions.\n\nMCE (Manufacturing Cycle Efficiency): Ratio of the Value Add time to the total Lead Time (although some sources on MCE confuse Lead Time with Throughput). It is the percentage of the time of the lead time that a part is really worked on. Loosely related to the OEE.\n\nM-CONWIP (Multiple Constant Work In Progress): Rarely used variant of the CONWIP, which also has different definitions. For some, it is a producti specific CONWIP card … which is the same as a Kanban. For others, these are conwip cards for specific sequences in job shops. Not recommended.\n\nMendomi (面倒見 or めんどうみ, noun for taking care of someone): Japanese expression where the workers are treated like a family. The company takes care of their workers and does not fire them. In turn, the company expects a lot of loyalty and commitment.\n\nMES (Manufacturing Execution System): Generic name for a set of software to track the material flow in a production system, although it is also used in different contexts related to manufacturing. Somewhat related to MOM, although the abbreviation MES is older than MOM.\n\nMieruka (見える化 or みえるか for visualization or making it visible. Consists of 見える or mieru for being able to see and 化 or ka for the action of making something): Term at Toyota for Visual Management. The idea is to make the process or system easier to understand and observe.\n\nMIFA (Material and Information Flow Analysis): Toyota method for a structured diagram showing the current or future state of the Material Flow and Information Flow of the Value Stream, often on the shop floor. This was the original basis for the VSM and VSD, but with slightly different icons. The method is also much less prominent at Toyota compared to the Western World, where VSM and VSD are often almost considered mandatory for any Lean Manufacturing projects. At Toyota, it is also sometimes called MIFD.\n\nMIFD (Material and Information Flow Diagrams): Another name for MIFA.\n\nMikara Unpan (Probably ミカラ運搬 or 身空運搬. 身: mi: Main part, meat, body; 空: kara: emptiness, vacuum, blank; 運搬: unpan: transport, carriage): Loaded-empty container exchange system (or packaging in general). Also sometimes abbreviated mikara (実空). In contrast to Minomi. Rarely used outside of Japan.\n\nMilk Run: Material provider that delivers material to different stations in sequence and has a fixed schedule similar to a bus timetable. See also my series of posts Introduction to Milk Runs, Milk Run Basics, Calculating the Material for Your Milk Run, Milk Run Layout, Frequently Asked Questions for Milk Runs, and External Milk Runs.\n\nMind Map: Diagram to visualize information. The core theme is usually drawn in the middle, with different branches extending, splitting, and connecting again to visualize the connections in between. In my view sometimes quite a useful tool to grasp a problem with many complex interactions. See also my post on Fishbone Diagrams and Mind Maps.\n\nMinna Shuyaku (みんな主役 for all; everyone; everybody and leading part; leading): Common phrase at Toyota management that everybody is a leader. There are no unimportant people or employees. You are in charge of your own work.\n\nMinomi (みのみ or ミノミfor minomi; or also possibly 身: mi: Main part, meat, body; のみ: nomi: only, nothing but): Approach to deliver material to the point of consumption (e.g. an assembly line) without any packaging or containers. The delivery could be e.g. through a dedicated mobile rack (minomi cart) or hanging from hooks. This approach reduces handling of packaging material. See also Mikara. Rarely used outside of Japan.\n\nMizusumashi (水澄まし or水すまし, water strider, sometimes also 人間水澄まし[ningenmizusumashi] for human water strider. Both often incorrectly translated to water spider.): Person in charge of supplying materials to a set of processes in random order. In English also often called Point of Use provider or POU. Different from a milk run, the point of use provider does not have a fixed schedule and route but provides material for a small area (e.g. one process or a short line) on an as-needed basis. The area covered must be small enough so that the point of use provider can still track all needs, respond quickly, and keep everything in sight. See also my posts on Introduction to Point-of-Use Providers (or Mizusumashi), Point-of-Use Provider Calculations, and Point-of-Use Provider Routing.\n\nMOM (Manufacturing Operations Management System): Generic name for a set of software to manage production. Depending on who you ask it is a subset of, same as, or different from a MES.\n\nMonitoring KPI (Monitoring Key Performance Indicator): A KPI that is measured on the lowest level of the hierarchy and can be observed, measured, or counted directly. The expression is rarely used. Difference between monitoring KPI and Improvement KPI often ill-defined and confused. In my view using just KPI is good enough for most cases.\n\nMonozukuri (物作り, or more often ものづくり, making things by hand, craftsmanship): Spirit and mindset in producing the best products that you are able to and to constantly strive to become better at it. A fundamental part of Japanese values and ethics. See also Hitozukuri and less commonly Kotozukuri. See also Takumi. See also my post Monozukuri – Japanese Work Ethics.\n\nMonument: Two possible (and related) uses: A monument could be a machine that is too big to be moved, and hence the material flow and organization has to work around this monument. It is sort of a rigid constraint for layout or production planning. It can also be a project that for some reasons cannot be changed. Cancelling this project may damage the reputation or career of an important player, and hence the project is pushed forward even if it no longer makes economic sense.\n\nMOST (Maynard Operation Sequence Technique): Predetermined Motion Time System common in Asia. Compared to MTM common in Europe and America, MOST handles recurring steps better, whereas MTM often overestimates the time. Both measure times in TMU. See also TVAL for a related system used at Toyota to measure fatigue.\n\nMottainai (もったいない or 勿体無い for wasteful): Common Japanese expression also used in Lean as a sort of regret concerning waste. A good English translation would be “What a waste!”. See also Muda.\n\nMoving Assembly Line: Type of Assembly Line that is constantly moving while the processes are running. Often also called a continuously moving assembly line. Suited for shorter cycle times, otherwise, a Pulse Line may be better. See also my post Pacing of Flow Lines 2 – Continuously Moving Line.\n\nMQB (“Modularer Querbaukasten”, German for Modular Transversal Toolkit): Platform strategy at Volkswagen with the goal to reduce the number of part types for many of its cars. See also TNGA.\n\nMRP (Material requirements planning): Production planning and scheduling software to keep track of the mass of data in manufacturing. A later version that tracks all manufacturing data was called Manufacturing resource planning. Since it has the same abbreviation MRP it is also called MRP II. The term is still used but superseded by ERP, although many use these terms as synonyms.\n\nMTBF (Meantime Between Failures): The average time between the breakdowns of a process until the process is repaired again. However, there are different definitions, and sometimes it is defined as the average time between breakdowns including repair time (MTTR), which would actually make more sense based on the abbreviation MTBF. In this case, a different abbreviation MTTF is used for the time between breakdown and repair. Usually, the underlying statistical distributed is right-tailed, meaning that you will have a lot of short times between failures and a few very long times. See also MTBF and MTTR.\n\nMTM (Methods-Time Measurement): Popular Predetermined Motion Time System developed around 1940 and published 1948 in a book with the same title by Maynard, Stegemerten, and Schwab. There are nowadays different flavors, e.g. the original MTM 1, MTM 2, MTM 3, and MTM-UAS. It measures times not in seconds, but in TMU. See MOST for a system common in Asia that evaluates recurring tasks better, and TVAL for the Toyota system that is particularly good at including the effect of fatigue.\n\nMTTF (Mean Time To Failure): The average time after a process is repaired until the process breaks down again. Used if MTBF is defined as the time between failures. See also MTBF and MTTR.\n\nMTTR (Mean Time to Repair): The average time after a breakdown of a process until the process is up and running again. Usually, the underlying statistical distributed is right-tailed, meaning that you will have a lot of short repair times and a few very long times. See also MTTF and MTTR.\n\nMuda (無駄, waste): A key concept of the Toyota Production System, with the goal to reduce waste, usually categorized into 7 Types of Waste. One of the 3 M. It is often further separated in necessary or unavoidable waste, and unnecessary or avoidable waste. The first should be reduced, the second eliminated. See also Waste Walk and Mottainai. See also my post The Seven Types of Waste (Muda).\n\nMulti Machine Handling: System where one operator handles more than one machine. Ideally, the operator loads and sometimes also unloads parts and starts the machine. While the machine processes the parts, the operator proceeds to the next machine. After handling two or more machines, the operator comes back to the first machine to repeat the cycle. It is important that if possible the machines wait for the operator, not the other way round. For a variant with loading only see Chaku-Chaku. It is usually a Low Mix High Volume type of production. While somewhat similar, working at different machines in a Job Shop does not include a cycle, as the next machine or process may be different depending on the required products in a High Mix Low Volume production.\n\nMura (斑, unevenness): A key concept of the Toyota Production System, with the goal to reduce unevenness or fluctuations in material flow, information flow, or any other activities or items, and increase leveling (heijunka). One of the 3 M. Often done through Buffer. See also my posts Muda, Mura, Muri: The Three Evils of Manufacturing and The Three Fundamental Ways to Decouple Fluctuations.\n\nMuri (無理, unreasonable, overdoing): A key concept of the Toyota Production System, with the goal to prevent unreasonable demands on the workers, machines, or material. One of the 3 M. See also my post Muda, Mura, Muri: The Three Evils of Manufacturing as well as my series starting with Why Are Fluctuations So Bad?.\n\nN\n\nNagara Fixture (乍ら or ながら for while, during, as.): Fixture for a Moving Assembly Line, in particular in automotive, that carries parts or tools. This fixture moves along with the assembly line while the worker is working. When the task is completed the nagara fixture moves against the direction of the assembly line to the next part (automobile). These nagara fixtures are often either trolleys that are pulled along the assembly line (often nicknamed pirate ships), or tool racks hanging from above the line (often nicknamed space-ships). See also Nagara-Switch.\n\nNagara-Switch (乍らスイッチ or ながらスイッチ, literally “While-Switch”): Flexible rod switch designed for swiping rather than pressing to allow faster actuation. Can be used easily and quickly while walking past the switch without stopping. See also Nagara Fixture. A further improvement is a machine that starts automatically of the door is closed or a light curtain is no longer sensing a hand. Process must be safe both for the worker and the product in case of accidental start. The Nagara switch is described in my post on The Chaku Chaku Line.\n\nNagare (流れ, meaning flow of people, things, fluids or gasses): Philosophy of smooth production flow, ideally One Piece Flow.\n\nNemawashi (根回し, making arrangements): An informal process of getting support from coworkers and others before starting a project in order to increase the chances of success. See also Tatakidai, Yokoten and Ringi.\n\nNichijou Kanri (日常: ordinary, regular, everyday, usual; 管理: control, management): Daily management. Sometimes also spelled Nichijo Kanri. In contrast, see Hoshin Kanri for longer-term policy deployment.\n\nNomikai (飲み会 or のみかい for drinking party or get-together): A common event in Japan where the employees of a company group meet after work to drink together. This helps bond the group, but also takes away even more personal time from the workers, reducing their work-life balance. May involve larger quantities of alcohol. More common in large cities like Tokyo, where the employees go home using public transport, less common in smaller towns where the employees have to drive home. Also seems to be more common with office workers, less common with shop floor workers.\n\nNUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.): Joint venture between GM and Toyota 1984 – 2010 in Freemont, California. Known for its spectacular success in introducing the Toyota Production System in the Western World.\n\nO\n\nOAE (Overall (production) Asset Efficiency): Rarely used variant of the OEE, but renames the “Equipment” in OEE to the more general Asset.\n\nObeya (大部屋, big room): Space assigned to a project team where all members work together, not only for meetings. Over time the room usually fills with data and charts on the wall. A western term would be “war room”. See also my post Visual Management during World War II – A Visit to the Lascaris War Rooms in Malta.\n\nObjectives and Key Results (OKR): Structured approach to target setting. I like that it also involves the front line workers, but it feels like they are falling short on the C&A of the PDCA.\n\nOEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness or Overall Equipment Efficiency.): Measures a sort of Utilization of a process or a system, and also allows the analysis of the different losses. The OEE is the ratio of the number of good parts produced to the theoretical maximum number of parts, which is identical to the ratio of the Cycle Time to the average time between parts. The OEE cannot exceed 100% unless it is manipulated (as it frequently is). The remaining percentage between the OEE and 100% are usually called the losses and can be further divided into availability losses (machine stopped), speed losses (machine slower than target speed), and quality losses (bad parts). There are many variants and flavors of the OEE, including MCE, OFE, OLE, OTE, OAE, and – not a joke! – PEE. See also my series of posts starting with What is OEE? – Definition of OEE, and my articles tagged as OEE.\n\nOFE (Overall Factory Efficiency; also Overall (semiconductor) Fab Effectiveness): Rarely used variant of the OEE with the goal to represent not only one process but the relationship of the processes of an entire factory. I personally think it is difficult to combine multiple processes meaningful into an overall “factory” metric, and this is probably why these luckily never has caught on. See also OLE and OTE for near-identical system-wide variants of the OEE.\n\nOGSM (Objectives, Goals, Strategies and Measures): A framework for strategic planning. First appeared at Procter & Gamble, but claims a Japanese origin. The (sometimes oversold) method is basic: The objectives are the big picture of what you want to achieve. From these you develop specific goals. For the implementation of the goals you need a strategy, and then measures to actually implement it. For me as a lean guy I am sorely missing the Check and Act from the PDCA to make sure you actually achieved your goals …\n\nOHSA (Occupational Health and Safety): Abbreviation often used for the large issue of workplace safety, with the goal to reduce accidents and injuries. The World Health Organization WHO defines this as follows: Occupational health deals with all aspects of health and safety in the workplace and has a strong focus on primary prevention of hazards. See also KYT.\n\nOKR (Objectives and Key Results): Variant of KPI with a stronger focus on objectives rather than only results. Objectives are defined for the team/employees as part of a management by objectives (MBO) approach. First used at Intel. In my view primarily a change in semantics compared to KPI’s to nudge the user more towards useful metrics.\n\nOLE (Overall Line Efficiency): Rarely used variant of the OEE with the goal to represent not only one process but the relationship of the processes of an entire factory. I personally think it is difficult to combine multiple processes meaningful into an overall “factory” metric, and this is probably why these luckily never has caught on. See also OFE and OTE for near-identical system-wide variants of the OEE.\n\nOMCD (Operations Management Consulting Division): An internal consulting group of Toyota, helping to develop, promote, and spread the Toyota Production System both within the Toyota group and with its suppliers. They are seen as the disciples of Taiichi Ohno and guardians of the Toyota Production System.\n\nOne Piece Flow: Production in its ideal state according to lean. The lot size is one, there is little or no Change Over Time, and sometimes also defined as no inventory whatsoever between the processes. Parts move to the next process immedeately after processing. Please note that these definitions are not used consistently within the lean community. Closely related and sometimes used similarly to Continuous Flow or single piece flow. The original Japanese term is Ikko-Nagashi (一個流し), literally translated as one piece draining or pouring. One Piece Flow is commonly misunderstood as continuously moving of parts. However, the parts may as well pause and wait. The focus is more on small lot sizes and small inventories. See also my post on Toyota’s and Denso’s Relentless Quest for Lot Size One for some good examples.\n\nOne Up One Down: Production management approach where workers are responsible for a certain area of a line, although with overlaps. This is similar to the Bucket Brigade. See also my post One Up One Down – Approach to Manage Manual Production Lines!\n\nOn-the-job training (OTJ or OJT, both abbreviations are in use): Training of new workers directly on the job, i.e. learning while doing. On its own often not optimal, should be enhanced with off the job training. But both are needed to train an employee.\n\nOODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act): Approach to strategic decision making in the US military. (Very) loosely related to the PDCA. See also my overview of PDCA variants at The Many Flavors of the PDCA.\n\nOPDCA (Observe, Plan, Do, Check, Act): Variant of the well-known PDCA with an additional “O” for “Observe”. See also my overview of PDCA variants at The Many Flavors of the PDCA.\n\nOPE (Overall People/Process Effectiveness): Measures a sort of Utilization identical to OEE, except that it is not for processes but for people. It was initially named Overall People Effectiveness, but this ruffled some feathers with workers and unions. He"
