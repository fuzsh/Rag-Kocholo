        "text": "Galerie Eva Presenhuber is proud to announce the representation of Vienna-based artist Liesl Raff. Liesl Raff's sculptures explore the nuances of physical and social interactions through a profound appreciation of diverse materials and persistent experimentation. Her work features a semiotics of materials that begins where words fail. Recently, she has used natural rubber to showcase its adaptable and shape-shifting properties. Standing near or within Raff's pieces, you experience a transition into a warm, cozy, and calm state, feeling a sense of dependability and safety. Her sculptures integrate seamlessly with their surroundings, promoting contact and interaction.\n\nFind out more about the artist here.\n\nJosh Smith is a multi-talented artist: he is not just a painter. Since the pandemic, he has appeared on Instagram as an ambassador for the art world. He also hosts a regular series on YouTube called \"Studio News\". During the broadcasts, he sometimes talks about his artistic creative process - in some editions, he simply remains silent. Now Smith is presenting a series of 16 new canvases with his first eponymous exhibition in Vienna.\n\nRead on PARNASS\n\nLouisa Gagliardi captivates collectors with her unique paintings that explore the tension between online and real-life existence. Her works feature slick, serene yet uneasy scenes with avatars that evoke a sense of ennui. Using a laborious digital process, she prints sketches on glossy PVC surfaces, creating a surreal, sci-fi allure. Gagliardi's background in graphic design influences her industrial technique, and her works reflect themes of hyperconnectivity and isolation. Influenced by artists like Fernand Léger, her art combines reflections and trompe l'oeil effects, aiming to immerse viewers in otherworldly, dream-like realms.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\n\"The plants in Shara Hughes’s mind-bending paintings export the viewer far from reality. The American artist’s forms seem to be plundered from the depths of her imagination. Towering trees are depicted in spidery strokes of yellow, green and orange (Wits End (2024)), or with vibrant, fluffy blue dots embellishing their branches (What Nerve (2024)). Her works are often so loaded with energetic marks and organic forms that the background and foreground converge, leading to a rich tangle of dynamic visual material.\"\n\nRead the full article on Artnet\n\nPremiering in Zurich this week at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Tobias Pils: Happy Days marks the seventh solo show the artist has had with the gallery and presents a new body of work that highlights his signature style. On view June 7–July 20, 2024, the exhibition is comprised of two large-scale triptychs, a suite of eight paintings, and a bronze sculpture.\n\nRead the article here\n\n\"Doug Aitken is an American artist known for installations that span a wide spectrum of media and genres; they may include video, print media, photography, sculpture, sound, and performance. Aitken wants to make the traditional definition of art more accessible to a much more comprehensive and connecting meaning. The viewer is invited to move through his large-scale works, either by walking around huge screens, stepping on a train, or even swimming through mirrored sculptures – to name but a few of his immersive projects.\"\n\nRead the interview here.\n\nFresh out of the shower from Vienna, Josh Smith introduces his solo exhibition Studio News (24 May–20 July 2024). Fish, palm trees, and the Grim Reaper ('I mean that was a really bad one') have all graced the New Yorker's gestural and colour-rich canvases over his 20-year career. This time, it's bats: 'They're like birds, just way cooler.'\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nNick Byrne from King Kong Magazine interviewed Torbjørn Rødland, whose photographic works are a moveable feast for the eyes. The subject matter is caught in the moment, but starts to alter in the imagination. Changing and warping, sneakily shapeshifting, his photographs give the illusion of reality, when in fact the realism of the images are just a shudder away from the surreal.\n\nRead the interview here.\n\nUgo Rondinone grew up as a secondo in central Switzerland. As a gay man, he saw his life limited by the Aids crisis. But he became a world artist. NZZ conducted a big interview with the artist about his life, in which he said: \"My self-confidence is like a fairy tale. One day you see yourself as a gilded carriage, the next you realize you're just a pumpkin after all\"\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nUgo Rondinone has created a screen print of The Sun and a series of 27 of his Mountain sculptures exclusively for the NZZ. Reminiscent of geological formations, these are crafted from stacked stone chunks, arranged in pairs to create abstract compositions. Originating with a monumental installation in Nevada in 2016, Rondinone's mountains have found homes in public spaces globally, as well as smaller interiors. Each stone in the series is painted in a vibrant Day-Glo color, adding to the visual impact of the pieces.\n\nFind out more here.\n\n\"Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Zurich, presents the eighth solo exhibition of the artist: bass+ (re)modification, on display until 18 May. In a large white room, a black horizontal line runs across three walls. Dotted above and below, we see a series of rectangular, monochrome MDF panels. These vary in size and palette – on one end we witness a vibrant neon green, on the other, a quiet, slim blue. There’s a sense of coolness and play at hand, invoked by geometric shapes that are constantly in conversation with each other. We feel an energy bounce off each board, reflecting and reverberating across the gallery in a way that suggests lyricality. You’d be forgiven for thinking that these panels represent bars of sound, as if to emulate a musical software application.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nOcula spoke to Louisa Gagliardi about her unconventional painting methods and her upcoming show at Galerie Eva Presenhuber x Taxa, Seoul. Her work often explores feelings of awkwardness and alienation, earning her the nickname Digital Dali. Oculat states: \"Gagliardi is one of very few artists who has found representation at a leading gallery for her digital paintings, which she augments with ink and nail polish.\"\n\nRead the full interview on Ocula.\n\nBrooklyn-based Austin Eddy’s paintings call on the viewer to create their own stories out of the ones he proposes. He might use autobiographical events and abstract them to birds, but never imposes his own interpretation. His birds are more form than animal: they are stand-ins for the very human desire for personal freedom, framed by its equally strong wish for stability and structure. As his work toes the line between figurative and abstract, it recalls the cubist forms of the 20th century, while being firmly anchored in Austin’s present.\n\nRead the full interview on Collectors Agenda\n\n\"The title of Steven Shearer’s exhibition “Sleep, Death’s Own Brother” reverberates from the almost seven-meter-wide wall piece Sleep II, 2015, a collage of hundreds of small photos depicting slumbering individuals. Some seem to be peacefully resting, while others appear lifeless, resembling corpses. This lurking presence of death pervades the entire exhibition, evident in thirty-seven small drawings and thirteen prominent paintings like The Sickly Fauve, 2014, which shows a pale androgynous figure whose dark under-eye circles suggest they haven’t seen sunlight for weeks.\"\n\nRead the full article on Artforum\n\nMadeleine Pollard from Elephant Magazine reported on Sofia Mitsola's recent gallery show: \"When it came to her latest body of work, Villa Venus: An Organised Dream, which recently showed at Zurich’s Galerie Eva Presenhuber, her focus expanded from the bodies themselves to their surroundings. “I’d been concentrating on my characters for some years, so then I was trying to imagine a place to put them. Where do they sprout from? Where do they live?” she explains. “In 2022, I was on the Greek island of Paros in the Cyclades and it got me thinking about fantastical places. I wanted to create an island of my own.”\"\n\nRead the full article on Elephant.\n\nChloe Stead reviewed Steven Shearer's exhibition at the George Economou Collection, Athens: \"I’ve never had insomnia, but Steven Shearer’s paintings are a good indication of what it must feel like. Red-eyed, his protagonists stare pleadingly out at the viewer or hide from their gaze under veils of lank hair, shoulders hunched, cigarette in mouth. Rendered with luminous blue-, yellow- and green-tinged skin, these men – visually coded as artist and musician types through their personal style and twilight activities – are clearly in need of some quality shut-eye.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nJerry Saltz reviewed Tschabalala Self's exhibition Bodega Run at the Swiss Institute in New York: \"Were the dusty bodegas of old superior to the anonymous, flattened spaces where many of us now buy our food? Yes and no. Self’s pop-up show was a milestone in a project that testifies that, especially in this city, there’s no such thing as a love that’s uncomplicated.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nAmong those familiar with Eva Presenhuber's work is Zurich-based artist and curator Mitchell Anderson, who founded the project space Plymouth Rock in 2014 to 'show artists who weren't getting the attention they deserved' in Zurich. In this conversation, Anderson shares his thoughts on the significance of hosting such an exhibition now, the relationship between art and melancholy, and the Swiss city's ever-evolving art scene.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nAesthetica Magazine reviewed Doug Aitken's show at SCHAUWERK: \"It’s a piece that informs a wider exhibition rooted in behaviour and fragmentation. The artist offers up a contemporary portrait of a restless, globalised world — driven by constant information, progress and technology. It speaks to other interdisciplinary installations, such as Julianknxx’s In ReMemory of Flight at The Barbican Centre, London, or John Akomfrah’s Arcadia at The Box, that use media and film as a means of documentation and observation. Overwhelmingly, Aitken tells us to pay attention to our rapidly changing environment. He asks us to look around and come into contact with the world around us, to resist being dictated by an algorithm. He notes, “When we look at art, perhaps we’re looking for a return to the real.'\"\n\nRead the full piece here.\n\n\"Jean-Marie Appriou’s exhibition unfolds as a poetic journey into a sculptor’s mind, where words take shape, and sculptures emerge as the written pages of a journal. Like the characters of a play, the figures present in the gallery unfold one by one, weaving the plot of a story unique to every viewer, projecting the contemplative realm of Appriou’s sculptural universe into the limitless multitude of simultaneous existence.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\n\"The idea of the Phillips Collection’s “One-on-One” series is to pair a contemporary artist’s work with that of an artist from the museum’s holdings. Thus the current duet of Swiss-born New York artist Ugo Rondinone and Louis Michel Eilshemius (1864-1941), a New Jersey native whose mother was Swiss. But this time, there’s a twist: Rondinone owns a lot more Eilshemius paintings than the Phillips does.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nPeter Fischli David Weiss, Douglas Gordon, Ugo Rondinone, Doug Aitken, Tschabalala Self and Franz West were selected among this year’s Kunstkompass Top 100 contemporary artists rankings in Capital Magazin! Rondinone additionally ranked 72th in the top 100 of Monopol Magazin. The artists are selected based on a thorough assessment of their recent activities, including participation in major international biennales, institutional exhibitions, public art installations, awards, and reviews in prestigious journals. Fischli Weiss (30th), Gordon (40th), Rondinone (52nd), and Aitken (96th) ranked among the top 100 in the overall ranking. Self ranked 43rd among the top 100 with the highest increase in points (Stars of Tomorrow). West ranked 9th among the top 20 influential posthumous artists (Olymp).\n\nFind out more on Capital Magazin\n\nHanno Hauenstein from Artnet visited Adam Pendleton in his New York studio: \"Asked whether it would be fair to say that he is currently moving away from words and more towards abstraction, he said: “A little bit, but it is much more ‘both-and’ instead of ‘either-or.’” His answer not only explains an art practice, but it might also be useful to keep in one’s mind amid the political debates swirling in recent weeks. While he might be reluctant to admit it, the artist’s engagement with politics excels beyond the canvas or his studio.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\n\"Presented in Vienna by Galerie Eva Presenhuber, “Jean-Marie Appriou: Gemini” is the artist’s third exhibition with the gallery and is thematically focused on the celestial twins. The concepts of Gemini, twins, dualities, and dichotomies have long been present in the history of art, but here Appriou looks at ideas around these concepts and forms a new, unique parallel, that of poetry and sculpture.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\n\"For Jean-Marie Appriou and Andrew Lord, sculpture provides a means to explore the material essence of life and, imbued within it, history, personal experiences, myths, and memories. At Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Vienna, two concurrent solo presentations of Jean-Marie Appriou's bronze and casted glass sculptures in Gemini and Andrew Lord's intimate, entangled forms in a sculpture of my left hand and five embraces (9 November–22 December 2023) act as containers to these threads.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\n\"According to the vaguely trustworthy website we all use, Lars von Trier’s apocalyptic film Melancholia (2011) was inspired by a depressive episode he had. Apparently, a therapist told him “Depressive people tend to act more calmly than others under heavy pressure because they already expect bad things to happen.” However the current group show at Galerie Eva Presenhuber has nothing to do with this but rather Albrecht Dürer’s engraving Melencolia 1 (1514), which was the initial reference to the exhibition of the first major group show curated by the gallerist in 1988 at Galerie Grita Insam...\"\n\nRead the full newsletter here.\n\nMatthieu Jacquet reviewed the photograph Barbershop Scene by Torbjørn Rødland, on view at Consortium Museum, Dijon: \"Rødland once compared his photographs to tarot cards, representations that are laden with symbols and multiple possible interpretations, none of which can be categorical, verified, or rationalized. The strength of works like Barbershop Scene is that Rødland can turn multiple potential readings into a psychological funhouse mirror, one that is both bewildering and captivating, causing viewers to constantly question their own assumptions.\"\n\nRead the full essay here.\n\n\"Eva Presenhuber opens a group show in Zurich this week, giving equal prominence to the artists she represents and those she describes as having “different positions”, who are mostly lesser-known. The latter include Stanislava Kovalcikova, a Czech artist whose work Presenhuber discovered at Vienna’s Belvedere Museum last year, and Aleksandra Waliszewska, an artist with great success in her home country of Poland but less well known elsewhere. They join gallery stalwarts, including Ugo Rondinone, Franz West and Steven Shearer, in a show of about 80 works by about 26 artists (November 11 to February 24). The title of the exhibition is Melencolia, although Presenhuber says that the art is more “works that are all reflective and thoughtful”. This, she says, is relevant for some of today’s artists under the age of 40 who can get “abused by high prices at auction, when they need more time and energy to think about what they are making. I have a distinct preference for slow burners,” she says.\"\n\nRead on Financial Times\n\n\"As the work rouses and relieves this anxiety of gazing, Sleep, Death’s Own Brother sets forth a vision of rebellion that often turns on itself, its enactment of the anti-hero dandy exerting pressure on the parameters and possibilities of portrait-making. It is also a fascinating study of how an artist can entice the viewer into a poetic scenography of cat and mouse, where existential dread looms and strategies of release do not always ease the pain.\"\n\nRead the full article on Spike Art Magazine.\n\nHeinz Schütz interviewed Matthew Angelo Harrison for KUNSTFORUM International, stating: \"The encapsulation of traditional African sculptures plays a central role in Matthew Angelo Harrison's work. Transparent, futuristic-looking plastic boxes preserve what has been encapsulated. With their purist minimalist aesthetics, they act like \"coolers\" that contain and dim down the once cultic-magical and highly expressive in a modernist way. What began as an exploration of Harrison's African-American roots points beyond and becomes a commentary on the present.\"\n\nRead the full article on KUNSTFORUM International\n\nSam Falls was in conversation with Paul Laster from Ocula about his exhibition at Galerie Eva Presenhuber in Zurich. About his unique technique of imprinting by means of natural elements, Falls says: \"The idea of removing my hand has always been important to me . . . With the patina changing, you see time passing—you see nature's take on the work.\"\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nKatinka Fischer from Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung concludes about Doug Aitken's new show at SCHAUWERK Sindelfingen: \"Even in the spacious Sindelfingen exhibition space, the volume of his works only allows for a limited selection of ten items, which nevertheless provide a representative overview of his work over the past 15 years. The fact that the architecture makes it possible (and that this possibility has been used) to assemble several exhibits in one room demonstrates to the eyes and ears that Aitken's heterogeneous works are more connected than would have been clear from a separate presentation. The fact that images, light and sound effects are superimposed on one another is conducive to the effect of art. One moves through them and feels as if one is in a landscape.\"\n\nRead the full article on FAZ\n\nJulia Moritz reviewed Tschabalala Self's exhibition Spaces and Places, which was on view at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Waldmannstrasse, Zurich, from June 10 through July 22, 2023: \"Her paintings and sculpture are expansive, figurative and ornamental. The colours glow. And Self's diverse application of self-dyed and found fabrics onto canvas is well on its way to becoming a trademark. So far so bold. But what place emerges in the interstices of self-representation and ascription to others in the Self's latest works?\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nRonald Berg at Kunstforum concludes about Martin Boyce recent gallery exhibitions: \"Perhaps Martin Boyce's 'fall from grace' into the applied metier is a symptom of the fact that the patterns of autonomy and freedom of purpose are no longer strictly valid today. However, this would then at the same time formulate a condemnation of modernity as such - including its Enlightenment premises of individual freedom and responsibility. Modernity: 'Failed or unfinished?' could thus be the central question of Martin Boyce's work.\"\n\nRead on Kunstforum\n\nFollowing a studio visit, Shara Hughes told Vogue US: “I can’t live without painting. It’s how I live and breathe. I’m not threatened by other artists if they’re making landscapes, because I’m, well, I’m doing mine. I’m very serious about getting the works into the right places, where more people can see them, so that I can have a place in art history that’s meaningful.”\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nMitchell Anderson from Frieze Magazine reviewed HOWL by Doug Aitken: \"Far from the often-didactic and predestined narrative of a documentary, Aitken’s judgment-free and non-politicized witnessing softly opens itself to many of the optimisms and resignations of desolate, small town American life – from the people who continue to make a living off the land to the children who have to avoid ‘druggies’ on their way home from school to those who dream of leaving. It’s an affecting work, not least because it centres on a rural segment of the population not traditionally depicted or discussed – past cheap caricatures – in contemporary art and life.\"\n\nRead the full artice here.\n\n\"HOWL makes no explicit reference to Allen Ginsberg’s celebrated 1956 poem of the same name. Other than a distant echo of lines such as ‘Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone!’ But that’s not to say that Aitken doesn’t indulge in a little (concrete) poetry of his own\" writes Mark Rappolt in his review of the exhibition HOWL by Doug Aitken.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nKate Brown at artnet wrote about Doug Aitken's HOWL: \"In their arid dust-bowl of a town, huge pump jacks dot the horizon, pulsing in and out of a bone dry desert landscape to extract oil, which seems to be the main source of income of the town and also its raison d’etre. The new video, called HOWL, premiered in his solo exhibition at Eva Presenhuber, Zurich last month (it is on view through July 22), and it juxtaposes these rhythmic, unforgiving fracking machines against the voices from the people who coexist among them.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nDoug Aitken’s latest work, HOWL, is a 15-minute, five-channel film about an unnamed town in the American West. It’s filled with epic aerial shots of oil wells and daily life in the town, along with short excerpts from interviews with some of its residents. Those interviews take on an eerie meaning as their words echo and reverberate. It is on view at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Zurich, Maag Areal through July 22, 2023.\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nAt this year's Art Basel, we are pleased to present Ugo Rondinone’s sculpture humanskysix (2022), which is revealed to have been cast from the body of Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer. The sculpture will be on view at our booth P5 in Hall 2.1. The Basel-born Federer collaborated with fellow Swiss Ugo Rondinone on his ambitious installation human clouds, which is the third part of the trilogy burn shine fly – an exhibition celebrating life and its seasons, rhythms, and natural elements.\n\nWatch the documentary Portrait of a Champion here.\n\nMister Neutral: Martin Herbert investigates what lies behind the constructed guise of the amateur, the craftsman, the style-less dabbler, the cross maker, defining Jean-Frédéric Schnyder as a man of quietly huge ambitions who planned, up front, to outrun all of us while embracing a world full of difference and contradiction, of beauty and banality and brutality, leaving a trail of clues in his wake.\n\nOn Schnyderian Art: Originally published in 1990 in the pages of Parkett, this essay by Patrick Frey is an ode to the greatness of Jean-Frédéric Schnyder and his art—a mixture of trueness to life and a profoundly skeptical intelligence.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nGalerie Eva Presenhuber is proud to announce the representation of London-based Greek artist Sofia Mitsola, alongside Pilar Corrias, London. Mitsola works primarily with painting to examine the female body. By looking at figures in ancient Egyptian and Greek sculpture, Japanese animation, and pornography, she composes her own mythological characters and places them in geometrical, stage-like compositions. These are painted in vibrant colors and are layered with washes and impasto. Her paintings often feature bare, larger-than-life characters who address the viewer with their direct gaze and invite them to look back. Through this act, Mitsola forms dynamic relationships between the painting and the viewer to establish new hierarchies and play with ideas of voyeurism, power, and control.\n\nLouisiana Channel met Hughes in her New York-studio to talk about drawing inspiration from other painters, and why she feels that a good painting is about “going to the edge and not giving away all the answers.”\n\nWatch the video here.\n\n“How could I make a painting about one flower that has multiple layers to it?” says American artist Shara Hughes about her painting POP, why the genre of still life was a thing of the past and needed to be updated.\n\nWatch the video here.\n\nLiam Gillick’s intervention in the permanent collection of Berlin’s Museum of the Ancient Near East, titled Filtered Time, opened to the public in April 2023. Using light, color, shape, projection, sound, and almost no text, his intervention comes at a time when the Pergamon Museum, in which this collection is housed, is projected to close at the end of 2023. Gillick agreed to realize his project amidst difficult debates about how to deal with these buildings and the fraught colonial histories they house, about which he spoke to Jörg Heiser.\n\nRead the full conversation between Liam Gillick and Jörg Heiser here.\n\nFollowing the opening of ‘The Close of the Day,’ Chase Hall joins Document to discuss the American South, code switching, and how his biracial experience is far from monolithic. He says: “As we get closer to the future, and we talk about equity, and we talk about rights, it’s important for me to navigate in a way that’s honest to myself—even in that core, even in that genetic humility.”\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nYuki Higashino reviewed the exhibition Leaving the New World by the US-American artist John Dilg, which was on view at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Vienna, from January 14 to February 18, 2023. He says: \"Dilg is highly skilled, and his painterly erudition is unmistakable. He gives shape to an idea of a place that might have but did not come into being.\"\n\nRead the whole review here.\n\nListen to Dior Talks podcast series, themed around the seventh edition of Dior Lady Art and hosted by Paris-based journalist Katya Foremanas, where artist Shara Hughes shares her vision for the Lady Dior bag. Evocative of escape, the two creations establish an outsider’s perspective peering into another universe. The scenic painting serves as portals as a parallel to the bag itself being an object that stores mysteries inside. With sleek paintings and textural embossments, the bags fulfill this enchanting concept.\n\nListen to the Podcast here\n\nArtflyer recently published a major article and interview with the artist Jean-Marie Appriou. In the interview, Appriou says, “What interests me is to go beyond this imaginary surface that the mirage, or the world, is. This Alice in Wonderland or William Blake trick of the passage. The door to another state. When we are in front of a work of art, we don’t know what happens, it is indescribable, but we pass through a door to a state of superior consciousness.”\n\nRead more on Artflyer\n\nArtist Louisa Gagliardi recently spoke to Louisa Elderton about her large-scale painting for the 2022 edition of Art Basel Unlimited. Gagliardi describes the work in reference to an atmosphere of “opening random doors and observing whatever scenes hide behind them. That’s what I want the work to feel like. Sometimes you open a door to an empty room that has a peaceful stillness, but it’s still eerie because of the potential for activation...”\n\nRead on Flash Art\n\nEva Presenhuber discusses her return to her home country of Austria and why she has decided to open a gallery in Vienna after years of operating out of Zurich and New York.
