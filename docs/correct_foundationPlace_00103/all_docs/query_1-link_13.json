        "text": "“Flugfeld” (air field) is a new residential and commercial district belonging to the cities Böblingen and Sindelfingen. The artificial lake “Langer See” divides it into two areas. The desired pedestrian and cycle bridge provides not only a functional transport connection, but it also creates a symbolic link.\n\nThe design of the load-bearing structure comprises an asymmetric cable-stayed bridge with a harp-shaped array of cables. A special feature is the design of the pylon: both pylon legs are curved, in plan as well as in lateral view. They merge at the tip of the pylon where the cable stays are fixed. The curvature of the pylons is of benefit, as it reduces bending stress. The pylon is constructed of trapezoidal steel box girders. Thanks to the judicious design of the cross-section geometry, the double-curved pylons can be manufactured of flat sheet metal.\n\nThe bridge’s superstructure comprises a composite construction of a tub-shaped steel section filled with reinforced concrete, and covered with a slip resistant synthetic layer. These steel sections were installed in three segments. The superstructure is monolithically connected to the bridge abutment on the pylon bank to the south; on the north bank it features a longitudinal expansion bearing.\n\nThe slender load bearing structure of the cable-stayed bridge allows an almost unobstructed view across the entire length of the lake. This asymmetric bridge design places emphasis on the south bank and adds thus a striking, but at the same time light counter weight to the densely built area on the north shore."
