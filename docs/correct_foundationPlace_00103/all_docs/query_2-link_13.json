        "text": "Society is becoming increasingly digitalised – our actions and interactions are recorded and generate flows of data that together describe where we are and what we are doing, what we are using, buying, and selling. Our material world is also increasingly digitalised, with products in the real world linked to digital twins, online databases and leaving digital footprints.\n\nWaste prevention and reuse are critical components of the transition to a circular economy. Minimising waste generation not only means that there is less waste to manage, but it also means that fewer materials are flowing into and out of the economy in a linear fashion, reducing pressures from material extraction, processing, manufacturing and associated transport. Measuring waste prevention and reuse is, however, not easily achieved using existing waste and material flow statistics. There are too many variables that influence waste generation to be able to draw a causal line from policy initiatives aiming to minimise waste, to actual changes in waste generation.\n\nIn the absence of official data and statistics that can comprehensively inform on waste prevention and reuse, there is a hope that the data flowing around our digital society can be harnessed to generate policy-relevant indicators. This project is a first step in that process. It maps the EU reporting demands for waste prevention and reuse and the methods currently employed in the Nordic countries to measure waste prevention and reuse. It then investigates the methods used in other European countries before developing a suite of case studies of novel methods for measuring waste prevention and reuse. Based on all these findings, the project elaborates where the greatest potentials lie for improving the monitoring of waste prevention and reuse, and presents a roadmap for improving the monitoring of waste prevention in the Nordic countries.\n\nWaste prevention is a critical component of the waste hierarchy. Minimising waste generation not only means that there is less waste to manage, but it also indicates that fewer materials are flowing though the economy in a linear fashion, and as such is a key component of a circular economy. Measuring waste prevention is not easily achieved using existing waste generation and material flow statistics – there are many variables that influence waste generation, many of which have nothing to do with waste prevention policy or initiatives.\n\nSociety is becoming increasingly digitalised – our actions and interactions are recorded and generate flows of data that together describe where we are, what we are doing and what we are using, buying, and selling. Our material world is also increasingly digitalised, with products in the real world linked to digital twins, online databases and digital footprints.\n\nIn the absence of official data and statistics that can comprehensively inform on waste prevention and reuse, there is a hope that the data flowing around our digital society can be harnessed to generate policy-relevant indicators. This requires identification of relevant data streams, negotiating access to this data, analysing and combining data in novel and innovative ways and interpreting the results to inform on the multitude components of waste prevention and reuse.\n\nThe first step in this study was to examine methods currently employed by the relevant authorities in the Nordic countries to monitor waste prevention and reuse. A next step was to develop informative case studies of novel approaches used in the Nordic countries and elsewhere, and consider the potential now and in the future for monitoring waste prevention and reuse by tapping into society’s digital shadow. Finally, a roadmap was developed detailing the key steps toward harnessing this data and how the Nordic countries can best cooperate in this task.\n\nThe study was commissioned by the Nordic Council of Ministers.\n\nUltimately, outcomes are the key factor in any change – achieving the aim of waste prevention. As such, waste prevention should logically be measured by monitoring whether the amount of waste reduces. However, a reduction of waste can be caused byLakhan, C. (2017). Factors influencing waste generation, and guidance for how to measure waste reduction – An empirical approach. York University, Canada. Draft:\n\nSystemic change (changes in product structure – external to waste management system),\n\nEndemic characteristics (changes in demography, economy, economic structure etc.) and\n\nAttributional factors (efforts aimed at reducing waste generation).\n\nAs waste prevention is closely linked to consumption patterns, it is extremely difficult to isolate the effect of specific waste prevention measures. Likewise, changes in waste volumes inform only about the waste that has been generated, not the waste that has not been generated, nor the reasons for that waste not being generatedWilts, H. et al (2019). Research study on holistic indicators for waste prevention. Nonetheless, a variety of methods have been employed to generate indicators for reuse and waste prevention. Waste prevention monitoring approaches can be categorised as followsWatson, D. et al. (2013). European Topic Centre for Sustainable Consumption and Production: Proposals for targets and indicators for waste prevention in four waste streams. Nordic Council of Ministers.:\n\nInput-based: Indicators based on changes in consumption of goods or resources leading to the waste stream over time. This can be based on market size, expenditure per capita, etc.\n\nOutput-based: Indicators based on the amount of waste generated (economy wide or within specific waste streams or within specific sectors).\n\nInput-versus-output: These indicators combine the above two measures calculating waste generation per unit input, as a measure of material efficiency. Typically given in physical quantities.\n\nDecoupling: These indicators combine waste generation data (for a waste stream, sector or economy-wide) with activity data – typically economic output data.\n\nImpacts: Indicators illustrate reduction of environmental impacts of generated waste – not due to changing waste management practices but through changing product design/consumption etc.\n\nHazardous content: These indicators measure changes in the hazardous contents of products which end as waste, or in the changing hazardous content of waste.\n\nResponse indicators: These indicators measure political actions taken to deliver waste prevention, including investments in eco-design research, economic instruments, level of integration of waste prevention into sectoral policies etc. (policies, measuring efforts), and\n\nOther: This is a ‘catch all’ category that typically includes qualitative indicators of reuse and waste prevention activity. For example, the number of reuse shops, repair services etc.\n\nMost indicators currently used to measure reuse and waste prevention focus on the waste component (i-iv above) and response-type indicators (vii). in terms of Theory of Change, the waste indicators are a proxy for suitable outcome indicators, while the response indicators are input indicators. Success in waste prevention in the material-based indicators (i-iv) is typically measured as deviation from a baseline year, or against prior projections of waste generationTakeshi, M. et al. (2017). Monitoring environmental burden reduction from household waste prevention [in Koyoto]. Waste Management 71 (2018) 2–9. These indicators are also universally compiled from existing data streams.\n\nLooking specifically at household waste prevention, several techniques can be used to generate supplementary dataSharp, V et al. (2010). Methods to monitor and evaluate household waste prevention. Waste Management & Research 2010: 28: 269–280, including self-weighing, monitoring or reporting; use of collection-round data (from waste collection); use of control and pilot groups; attitude and behaviour surveys; participation surveys; participation monitoring; compositional analysis; conversion factors, estimates and modelling. The techniques often rely on scaling up data collected on a small sample of participants. Using hybrid approaches – combining two or more techniques, can help make this process more robust – for example using control groups to verify survey results. All of these approaches require significant and dedicated effort, and typically generate one-off data sets.\n\nWhile many waste prevention campaigns are broad in scope, they can also address specific product groups. This type of targeted waste prevention initiatives can be supported, and its success monitored by indicators on the targeted product groupWilts, H. et al (2019). Research study on holistic indicators for waste prevention. Product groups with a significant resource footprint and environment impact, and for which potentials for improving waste prevention exist (e.g., through increasing market share of reuse, repair, product as a service models) are particularly relevant. Wilts et. al. (2019) point to the following product groups as being highly relevant to develop waste prevention indicators for:​\n\n6.1 Publicly driven experience from European countries\n\nA European assessment of waste prevention indicators from 2017 identified a few upstream indicators of waste prevention, none of which are enabled by digitalisationEEA (2017). Waste prevention in Europe. Most active indicators on waste prevention focus on waste volumes per capita or per unit GDPWilts, H. et al (2019). Research study on holistic indicators for waste prevention.\n\nThe upstream waste prevention indicators in use by national authorities are most often linked to reuse, and often for specific product groups (for example, textiles or EEE), or are input-based (e.g., number and revenue of reuse organisations). For example, Flanders monitors reused products (kg) and has a target to collect and resell locally, 5 kg of reusable goods/capita every year. New targets for 2022 are currently being negotiatedEEA (2017). Waste prevention in Europe\n\nOECD’s inventory of circular economy indicatorsOECD (2021). The OECD Inventory of Circular Economy Indicators shows how few official indicators for waste prevention and reuse are used by public authorities. The relevant indicators in the inventory include:\n\nReduced emissions through GPP (Portugal, 2017), yet only relevant if GPP includes waste prevention criteria.\n\nShare of GPP contracts that include environmental/circular elements above EU thresholds (Navarra, 2019; Paris, 2017), yet only relevant if GPP includes waste prevention criteria.\n\nPurchases of products that are reusable or include recycled material (Galician, 2019)\n\nCO2 emissions avoided as a consequence of recovery and reuse of materials (Paris, 2017)\n\nObjects repaired at repair cafés (Paris 2017).\n\nAgain, there is no sign that these indicators rely on any form of automatically generated digital dataOECD (2021). The OECD Inventory of Circular Economy Indicators. In fact, it seems most likely that these indicators require manual data generation or exploit existing official data.\n\nIndicators relevant for the measurement of waste prevention can also be found in the French monitoring framework “10 Key Indicators for Monitoring Circular Economy”French Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Marine Affairs (2017). 10 Key Indicators for Monitoring the Circular Economy. Indicators relevant to waste prevention include waste generation quantities, resource productivity, eco-label certificates given, car sharing frequency rates (survey) and household spending on maintenance and repair (survey). Again, none of these indicators can be categorised as digital.\n\nIn Spain, the circular economy strategy is to be monitored by 20 indicators, of which two are related to waste prevention; material productivityPACE (2021) Circular Indicators for Governments, and volume of reused waterOECD (2021). Assessing and unlocking the circular economy in Valladolid, Spain.. There are no signs that any of the monitoring in the Spanish strategy is performed through digital methods.\n\nA German meta-study examined the current state of methods and tools for monitoring the transition to a circular economy. The initiative provides a monitoring framework that details both the desired and available indicators for monitoring the circular economy, including waste prevention and reuse. The set builds on the full resource cycle and includes some indicators related to waste preventionAcatech (2021). Making Circular Economy count – What you can’t measure, you can’t manage. The relevant indicators identified are:\n\nRethink: Number of new revenue models (Potting & Janemaaijer,2018)\n\nReduce: Value-based resource efficiency indicator (Di Maio & Rem, 2017)\n\nRepair: Household spending on product repair and maintenance (Magnier et al., 2017)\n\nRemanufacture: Share of remanufacturing businesses in the manufacturing economy (EEA, 2016)\n\nData for the suggested German Waste Prevention indicators is not digitally collected.\n\nThe Netherlands has taken some interesting initiatives to monitor waste prevention through the following indicatorsPBL (2019) Circular economy: What we want to know and can measure:\n\nNumber of companies communicating on circular economy activities\n\nWaste production per unit of material use\n\nMaterial productivity\n\nAdded value of second-hand shops\n\nHousehold expenditure on repair\n\nNumber of shared cars\n\nThe first of these is currently supported by data collected using a web-scraper. This searches for the words ‘circular economy’ in the webpages of Dutch companiesPBL (2021) Integrale Circulaire Economie Rapportage 2021. This is, in principle, a wholly automated digital process, although it does require significant initial setup. The indicator measures all circular economy strategies, not only waste prevention, and even if tailored specifically to waste prevention, would only informs on the communication of waste prevention and not on the quality of the initiative or the quantity of materials reused or waste avoided. This example is elaborated in Case 7.\n\nWhile there is broad interest in exploring the possibilities for monitoring reuse and waste prevention by exploiting digital technologies and the digitisation of the society and the economy, very few publicly driven digital monitoring efforts have been undertaken to date.\n\nFifteen cases studies have been prepared that demonstrate how novel data streams can be captured to inform on progress in waste prevention. Of the 15, seven emerged from public sector projects, while eight are based on private sector initiatives or draw on data held by companies.\n\nIn only one of the seven cases from the public sector has the public authority actively taken the initiative to generate the data stream: the Dutch government has initiated a web-scrape of companies communicating on circular economy including waste prevention (Case 7). In the other six public authority cases, the data streams have arisen via legislation and/or digitalisation of activities. Legislation has been the driver in Case 3, where a Swedish tax break on repair generates a novel data stream about the volume of professional repair; in Case 4, the regulation for SMEs to report on their residual waste side streams generate knowledge about reuse of materials; and in Case 5, the requirement to inform on the content of Substances of Very High Concern produces data on hazardous content which is also a waste prevention issue. Case 1, 2 and 6 shows how digitalisation of activities - digital maps and sharing platforms - enable monitoring of these activities.\n\nDigitalisation of activities has also been a key enabler among the cases derived from the private sector. This is seen especially in Case 9 addressing the online second-hand market, Case 10 concerning reuse activities and Case 13 on intensifying the use of buildings. The implementation of digital management systems for stock management in retail (Case 15 on monitoring food waste) provides a wealth of useful data, while procurement records provide the basis for Case 12. Another driver is the digitalisation of product information by attaching a digital barcode (Case 8) and via blockchain (Case 14). Lastly, the aim of documenting and tracking the circularity performance can be a driver of collecting data (Case 14 on Circulytics).\n\n10.1 Organisation\n\nPrioritisation of monitoring waste prevention. In the Nordic countries, monitoring of waste prevention requires new data to be collected and/or exploited. Digitalisation can ease the burden of data collection but requires that resources are allocated. Therefore, allocating necessary resources is a precondition for piloting and implementing digital monitoring of waste prevention. This can be tied to the aim of monitoring all aspects of the circular economy and not just waste prevention. The framing of any monitoring efforts should reflect local political priorities but be systematically approached to cover key aspect of the circular economy. It could be useful to build a circular economy or waste prevention monitoring working group between the relevant authorities in the Nordic countries. The Nordic Working Group for Circular Economy is a good starting point, although it would also be useful to include experts in digitalisation – potentially from ministries and agencies that typically do not participate in CE coordination work at the Nordic level.\n\nBuild data capacities in public authorities. Digital monitoring of waste prevention will require that public authorities understand how to collect, integrate, and analyse data from novel and disparate sources. Data experts can already be found within waste monitoring and within the area of digitalisation. It is crucial to ensure that those responsible of digital monitoring of waste prevention have the proper capacities or can otherwise draw on these competencies from supporting agencies. It is essential that knowledge and expertise of digitalisation already present in public authorities be exploited to the full. This will require a large degree of cross-ministry and cross-agency collaboration. Where necessary, in-house competencies can be supplemented with the procurement of technical expert services as needed.\n\nDivide responsibilities of digital monitoring of waste prevention. Multiple work streams will need to be coordinated to successfully monitor waste prevention and reuse. The conceptual framework must be developed and updated, indicators defined and the supporting data must be identified, collected, integrated and analysed. In Denmark, the Circular Data Bank draws upon expertise from both the users of the data (the Association of Municipalities and the Danish EPA), but also those with insights into data management (the Digital Agency and the Environmental Data Portal). Coordinating this work across the Nordic region could help streamline this process and support mutual learning.\n\nPlan for data storage and integration. A monitoring framework for waste prevention will need a support system that stores and integrates data sources, and ideally also enables data analysis. A pre-screening of available systems or integration with existing systems – such as waste data systems – should be part of the initial planning.\n\n10.2 Identify and pilot data\n\nExploit public data. An initial screening of current and future public data streams that inform waste prevention should be made. Such data will often be linked to implemented policies that support waste prevention. A sharing platform of various products has been exemplified in Finland (Case 1 where the average distance and time to nearest reuse bring sites has been used as an indicator or Case 2 where the use of sharing items have been applied as an indicator). An alternative possibility is presented by reporting obligations such as those concerning information on the product content of substances of very high concern (see e.g. Case 5).\n\nProduct data is of key relevance for monitoring waste prevention. In a globalised world, where products and their components may cross several national borders, there is need for broad alignment in the content and format of product data. Standing alone, the Nordic countries will find it difficult to impose and enforce digital product data; especially in global markets such as EEE, where little production takes place in the Nordic countries. Common and aligned standards for product data – such as the EU digital product passport - will have a greater impact, and the Nordic countries should focus on EU collaboration to push this agenda.\n\nSeek cooperation with private data holders. The data generated in today’s digital economy is often confidential and/or business critical. Accessing this data requires cooperation with the data holder. This could be in the form of voluntary industry initiatives such as the second-hand effectSchibsted (2021). The second-hand effect​ or the reuse indexDBA (2020). Genbrugsindekset. However, where the company is the sole developer of the indicator, it can be difficult for public authorities to rely on this data to provide time series. Companies can also be incentivised to share data through certification, training or other assistance (see e.g. Case 14 – Circulytics). Public authorities can also play an important role in driving the development of data standards for products and services supporting transparency and openness, as well as supporting compliance with regulation such as GDPR.\n\nPrivate companies own a vast quantity of data, and many have deep insights into monitoring of consumption trends – particularly those that have a significant share of their market. Public authorities can cooperate directly with these companies, or the relevant business associations and sector representatives to test models for data sharing and for developing useful indicators.\n\nA first step could be to facilitate a broad circular monitoring partnership that brings together civil society and business actors to identify relevant data sharing collaborations. Such partnership could also identify incentives for data sharing. The EU requirement for quantitative and qualitative monitoring of reuse could be a natural starting point e.g. inviting second-hand platforms, some of which already report the amount of reuse taking place through their platforms, but also flea market managers, and physical second-hand shops. Case 9 on the impact of reuse shows how the average weight of product categories can be estimated and used to calculate environmental footprints.\n\nExploit B2G data sharing. In continuation and expansion of the cooperation with business encouraged above, B2G data sharing – a more systematic and structured transfer of data from businesses to authorities – may be explored. To implement a B2G data sharing, supportive framework condition needs to be in place. These include contractual agreement and anonymisation through aggregation of data and the removal of commercial sensitive data. B2G data sharing should aim to generate societal value, must be transparent, respect commercial sensitive data, and handled securely and without misuse. The administrative costs of collecting and sharing data could also be compensated. B2G sharing must be mutually beneficially and in some cases could take place under procurement processes or be a condition of procured services. As very few experiences with B2G data sharing exist, B2G data sharing on reuse could thus be a pilot that can inform future B2G data sharing. If this is the case, experiences, pitfalls and recommendations should be systematically collected throughout the process.\n\nConsider further data collection. Public authorities can take steps to collect data or procure a data service, in particular within open-sourced infrastructure data, communication and transactions data. Such data collection should be aligned with political priorities as pointed out under the first step of this roadmap. The Netherlands has, for example, taken steps to monitor how businesses communicate on the circular economy as a proxy for companies involved in the circular transition. The data was collected through a web-scraper, scraping from company webpages (see Case 7).\n\nProduct data is expected to be implemented with digital product passports through EU regulation, but transactional data could also be an interesting entry point. Data on public procurement tenders and invoices could help monitor circular public procurement as indicated in Case 12, or the possibilities of exploiting e-commerce data could inform on (circular) consumer behaviour.\n\nSimilarly, future publicly-funded research and development projects supporting waste prevention and reuse should include data standardisation, transparency, and collection as a standard component. This could even be a common component of all publicly-funded R&D projects that generate data.\n\nCoordinate pilot indicators and data streams between the Nordic countries. Pilot indicators based on identified data streams should be established to provide an understanding of data quality, ease of implementation and usefulness of the indicator. Pilots should pay attention to any implementation barriers and opportunities. This is a key area where responsible authorities in the Nordic countries should cooperate. Rather than duplicating efforts, it will be more efficient to coordinate trials and pilots across countries. This will be aided by ensuring that there is also coordination earlier in the process, so that the Nordic countries are broadly aligned on the framework for measuring waste prevention and reuse. In Finland, the Circwaste project created a playground for testing and trying out various data streams. It is important to create a room for pilots where mistakes can take places and learning can occur.\n\nNational policy on waste prevention\n\nThe Swedish national policy on waste prevention is outlined in the National Waste Management Plan and Waste Prevention Program 2018–2023 ‘Att göra mer med mindre’Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (2020). Att göra mer med mindre – Nationell avfallsplan och avfallsförebyggande program 2018–2023., which is an integrated strategy for the management of waste in Sweden. The National Plan was revised in 2020 to reflect the new requirements by the revised EU waste packageEC (2021a). Waste Law. and the constitutional amendments made for their implementation. The revised EU waste package came into force in July 2018 and its implementation meant that a number of changes were needed in Swedish laws and ordinances. The relevant constitutional amendments entered into force on 1 August 2020. In the revised EU waste package, the obligation for Member States to take waste prevention measures has been strengthened, inter alia, by the extensions in Article 9(1) of the Waste Framework DirectiveEC (2018a). Directive (EU) 2018/851 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2008/98/EC on waste.. The waste prevention programs shall include a description of the contributions to waste prevention from the instruments and measures set out in the revised Annex with examples of waste prevention measures (Article 29(2) and Annex IV of the Waste Directive). Within the waste prevention program, a special program for the prevention of food waste must also be adopted. Here, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency assumes that the Action Plan for Reduced Food Waste in 2030, ‘Fler gör mer’National Food Administration, the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (2018). Fler gör mer – Handlingsplan för minskat matsvinn 2030., which was decided in 2018 by the National Food Administration, the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency can be adopted as a special program. According to Article 9(3) of the Waste Framework Directive, Member States shall monitor and assess waste prevention measures through appropriate qualitative or quantitative indicators and targets. Article 29(1) also requires that waste prevention objectives be set out in the waste prevention program.\n\nIn the same year, in July 2020, the government presented the National Strategy for Circular EconomyThe Swedish Government (2020). Cirkulär ekonomi - strategi för omställningen i Sverige, which points out the direction for the work that needs to be done to switch to circular production, consumption and business models, as well as non-toxic and circular material cycles. Waste prevention is integral part of the circular economy and as such the National Strategy for Circular Economy plays a critical role in the direction the Swedish consumption and production develops in relation to resource use and waste. A circular economy is a tool for reducing society's use of resources and the environmental impact that results from this. The strategy identifies four focus areas where efforts are necessary:​\n\nFinland - National Factsheet on measuring waste prevention and reuse\n\nNational policy on waste prevention\n\nFinland has prepared a strategic programmeFinnish Ministry of the Environment and Ministry of Employment and the Economy (2021). Government resolution on the strategic programme for circular economy. to promote circular economy. The aim is to transform the economy into one that is based on the principles of circular economy by 2035. The transition into a circular economy also helps achieve the Government's carbon neutrality target by 2035. The Finnish Government adopted the resolution on promoting a circular economy on 8 April 2021.\n\nThe strategic programme to promote circular economy defines objectives for the use of natural resources. It lists the objectives and indicators, specifies the measures to be taken and allocates the resources needed to promote circular economy and achieve a systemic change.\n\nThe vision of the Circular Economy Programme is “Finland in 2035: Our economic success is founded on a carbon-neutral circular economy society”:\n\nsustainable products and services are mainstream of the economy and the sharing economy is part of our everyday lives;\n\nour choices are future-proof and they strengthen our fair welfare society;\n\nmore for less: the use of natural resources is sustainable and materials remain in circulation longer and more safely;\n\nthe breakthrough of a circular economy has been achieved through innovations, digital solutions, smart regulation, and responsible investors, businesses and consumers;\n\nMaking this vision reality requires sustainable and efficient use of natural resources. This will be guided by the following steps and objectives:\n\nThe consumption of non-renewable natural resources will decrease and the sustainable use of renewable natural resources may increase to the extent that the total consumption of primary raw materials in Finland in 2035 will not exceed what it was in 2015. Natural resources used to manufacture products for export are not covered by the objective*.\n\nThe productivity of resources will double by 2035 from what it was in 2015.\n\nThe circular material use rate (CMU, share of recycled material of all material use) will double by 2035.\n\n*The objective takes into account Finland’s total consumption that includes the imported products needed to run our everyday lives and infrastructure and the consumption of domestic raw materials. Finland’s total consumption includes raw material consumption in countries where the products are manufactured minus the raw materials used to manufacture Finnish products for export. The total consumption is shown by the Raw Material Consumption (RMC) indicator calculated by using the ENVIMAT tool developed by the University of Oulu and Finnish Environment Institute.\n\nThe indicators require further development. At this stage, the following indicators are selected to support the monitoring of the Programme:\n\nDomestic material consumption DMC (Eurostat)\n\nMaterial input required for domestic end-use material-specifically RMC (Statistics Finland and Finnish Environment Institute)\n\nResource profitability (GDP/RMC)\n\nCircular material use rate CMU (Statistics Finland)\n\nTurnover of circular economy sectors and number of enterprises (Statistics Finland)\n\nEco-innovations (Eurostat)\n\nInnovative public procurements (Eurostat)\n\nMunicipal, packaging and construction waste and recycling rate\n\nCircular Economy Barometer: A survey and interview-based study for companies and consumers on attitudes and operating models that support the circular economy (commissioned survey for example, every four years)\n\nFinland also has a National Waste PlanFinnish Ministry of the Environment (2018). From Recycling to a Circular Economy – National Waste Plan to 2023., which was last updated in 2018.\n\nThe waste plan defines a comprehensive list of indicators (see below) to monitor the development of waste generation and waste management, but most of the indicators describe waste amounts and treatment of waste – not directly the actions taken to achieve lower amounts of waste (e.g. types of economic activity, efficiency of raw material usage etc). None of the indicators utilizes digitalization as such.\n\nThe indicators currently in use include:\n\nRelevance\n\nIn a circular economy, products are used more intensively. That is why product-service systems are promoted, and shared use can be a part of this vision. Unarguably, the sharing economy can fundamentally reduce the amount of consumer goods in circulation. However, we cannot say that a circular economy is solely aiming for an increase in the use of sharing schemes. Sharing services also cause (greenhouse gas and other) emissions, and more importantly, rebound effects might appear. Car sharing might replace public transportation, for example, or in other ways increase the number of car passenger kilometres.\n\nTo properly measure how sharing systems contribute to the goals of the circular economy, one would measure how many private cars have been replaced by a subscription of a car sharing company. In reality, researchers rely on a set of proxies. For example, the increase in memberships of a car-sharing company can indicate that the demand for sharing systems has increased. However, these proxies come with uncertainties. The increase in membership could also be influenced by population growth, for example.\n\nThis means that the BCS statistics and similar data, where available, are a useful and reliable source of information for the monitoring of cities with carsharing, user numbers and vehicle fleets. However, caution is advised when it comes to interpreting the data, as could be shown for the case of user numbers.\n\nAbout this publication\n\nMeasuring waste prevention and reuse: digital opportunities\n\nUsing the digitalisation of society to inform policy\n\nDavid McKinnon, Nina Lander Svendsen, Bjørn Bauer, John Baxter, Leonidas Milios, Pauliina Saari\n\nISBN 978-92-893-7349-4 (PDF)\n\nISBN 978-92-893-7350-0 (ONLINE)\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.6027/temanord2022-536\n\nTemaNord 2022:536\n\nISSN 0908-6692\n\n© Nordic Council of Ministers 2022\n\nCover photo: Cultura Creative / Johnér\n\nPublished: 15/6/2022\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis publication was funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers.
