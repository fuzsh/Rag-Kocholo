        "text": "Im freien Fall\n\nI read a book about Lost Places that my dad had laying around and in there were these pages about a abandoned ski jump in the forest of Sindelfingen in the German federal state of Baden-Württemberg!\n\n(Translation of the text: jump/takeoff/dismount: Did you know there existed a ski jumping hill in the Sindelfingen forest? Still today you can see the jump-off base that protrudes from the forestfloor like a nondescript concrete block\n\nStands. At first glance I thought this wooden structure was a stairway for the ski jump. But it was probably a visitor stand from where you could watch the jumpers.)\n\nBut then I thought, huh, there have to be some records about this jump. I mean if some Lost Places dude knew about this thing, the internet knows for sure and look what I found:\n\nCool pictures, in my opinion :) And on the website I found these pictures there also was a text about the history of the hill but because I didn’t want to dump a whole text on you, here have a few facts about the hill:\n\nIt was a K40 hill and it was called Winterhaldenschanze\n\nThe hill was built in 1964 and was completely natural\n\nIn 1971 grandstands and a jury tower were built according to the plans of the Oberstdorfer architect Heini Klopfer (Yes the Heini Klopfer, the one they named the ski flying hill “Heini-Klopfer-Flugschanze” after)\n\nThe “Sindelfingen cup” took place there from 1980 to 1985 in snowy winters.\n\nSince then the hill has been torn down because of the increasing lack of snow and in 1988 vandals burnt down the wooden jury tower\n\nIf you want to you can read more about the history of the ski jump here (The whole website is in German but just google translate it if you don’t know German):"
