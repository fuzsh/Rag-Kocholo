        "text": "+++ Deliveries of fully-electric BMW vehicles grow by +34.1% in the first half of the year +++ Sales of BMW brand up +2.3% globally +++ Worldwide deliveries by the BMW Group totaled 1,213,359 units +++ Sales growth in Europe and North America +++\n\nMunich. With 179,557 fully electric vehicles delivered, the BMW brand achieved a +34.1% increase in BEV sales in the first half of 2024 compared to the previous year. Overall, the BMW brand grew by +2.3% compared to the previous year's period with 1,096,486 units sold in the first half of the year. The brand thereby outperformed its traditional competitors and managed to significantly gain market share in Europe. In total, the BMW Group delivered 1,213,359 vehicles of the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands in the first half of the year.\n\n“In the first six months of the year, we saw double-digit growth of our fully-electric vehicles and models from the upper premium segment,” said Jochen Goller, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales. “Despite a challenging market environment, we increased sales for the BMW brand in the first half of the year, thanks to our attractive product portfolio. The strong commitment of our BMW Group employees and our robust global retail network have made a significant contribution in this regard,” said Jochen Goller.\n\n+++ Statement Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG +++ 104th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 15th May 2024 +++ Livestream from BMW Welt in Munich +++\n\nStrong today – Strong tomorrow.\n\nOur BMW way into the future\n\nDear Shareholders!\n\nA warm welcome from BMW Welt in Munich. A lot of people talk about the transformation of mobility and the automotive industry – how one will replace the other. At BMW, we do things a little differently. We call it: continuous progress.\n\nBecoming a little bit better every day – that is what we aspire to. And what I, myself, am measured against. Never being satisfied with the status quo brings us closer to our ambitious goals. Step by step. Or, more fittingly, when talking about cars: mile by mile. That may sound very grounded and methodical, but it certainly yields highly effective results.\n\n+++ Consistent strategic implementation: Dynamic BEV ramp-up aligned with profitability, as planned +++ BEV ramp-up continued as planned: 28% growth to around 83,000 BEVs in Q1 +++ BMW brand sales increased by 2.5% +++ Deliveries of models in the upper price segment rise by over 20% +++ Group EBT margin above target of >10% in Q1 +++ EBIT margin within the target range of 8-10% for nine consecutive quarters +++ Outlook for 2024 confirmed +++ Zipse: “Past nine quarters show continuity and reliability.” +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group continues its successful course in 2024: parallel to its dynamic BEV ramp-up, the company achieved its margin targets. In the first three months of the year, the company delivered around 83,000 all-electric vehicles from its BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands and increased BEV sales by around 28 percent. The BMW brand overall increased its sales by 2.5%. At the same time, the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment of 8.8 percent was within the target range of 8-10 percent, according to the full-year guidance. At 11.4 percent, the EBT margin at Group level was above the strategic target of >10 percent.\n\nAfter the challenges of the corona pandemic and semiconductor availability, the company has consistently delivered quarter by quarter within its 8-10% strategic EBIT corridor since Q1 2022. This has been achieved in parallel to its rapid ramp-up of electric mobility: Over the past two years, the BMW Group delivered more than 1.1 million electrified vehicles to customers. More than 60 percent of these were purely electric BEV models. The BEV share continues to rise steadily, as planned.\n\n+++ BMW Group sales climb to 594,671 units in first quarter +++ Growth drivers: fully-electric vehicles and models from high-end premium segment +++ BMW brand: Global sales up +2.5%; deliveries of fully-electric vehicles increase by +40.6% +++ Higher BEV sales in all major regions of the world +++ Jochen Goller: “Delivery of one-millionth fully-electric vehicle confirms the attractiveness of our product portfolio.” +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group will continue its consistent ramp up of electromobility in 2024 with attractive product offerings, despite a volatile market environment. The company delivered a total of 82,700 fully-electric BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide in the first three months of the year. This represents year-on-year BEV growth of over 27.9% for the BMW Group. The increase in sales of fully-electric vehicles benefitted from a balanced performance across all major regions of the world.\n\n“The BMW Group is continuing on its BEV growth path. With the delivery of its one-millionth fully-electric vehicle since the market launch of the BMW i3*, we have reached an important milestone that confirms the attractiveness of our product portfolio,” said Jochen Goller, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales. Alongside fully-electric models, vehicles with highly-efficient combustion engines and plug-in hybrid technology remain important components of BMW Group’s drive train portfolio. “By providing a choice of drive train technologies and thanks to our high level of flexibility, the BMW Group is well-positioned to meet changing customer requirements. This strategy is now proving particularly effective in a dynamic market environment,” continued Jochen Goller.\n\n+++ Automotive EBIT significantly higher in 2023 +++ EBIT margin of 8-10% forecast for 2024 +++ Capital expenditure to peak in 2024, as planned +++ NEUE KLASSE in the starting blocks: Testing already underway +++ BMW Vision Neue Klasse X highlights broad spectrum: NEUE KLASSE offers customers wide choice of models +++ Over two million electrified vehicles already on roads +++ Dynamic growth continues: More than 15 BEV models from all brands available in 2024 +++ EU CO₂ fleet emissions over 20% below limit in 2023 +++ Plant Munich switching to BEV-only production from 2027 +++ Zipse: “Reliable partner for customers, investors and stakeholders” +++\n\nMunich. Strong products, strong demand, strong results: Following a successful 2023, in which the Automotive Segment reported its highest-ever operating result, the BMW Group aims to continue on its profitable growth course in the current financial year. Fully-electric vehicles (BEVs) and models from the upper premium segment should remain the main growth drivers again in 2024 – including the BMW 7 Series models, the BMW X7 and the Rolls-Royce model family, with the fully-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre*.\n\nIn both segments, the BMW Group expects to see significant double-digit growth in the current financial year. In addition, the BMW 5 Series models, including the BMW i5*, which will also be available for the first time as a fully-electric Touring model this year, plus vehicles from BMW M GmbH, will contribute as well.\n\n+++ Zipse: “Implementing strategy consistently and successfully” +++ Group EBT margin of 11.0% for the full year +++ Automotive EBIT margin at 9.8% in 2023 +++ Percentage of BEV deliveries of 15% in 2023, as forecast +++ EU fleet CO2 emissions at 102.1 g/km (WLTP) ‒ well below 128.5 g/km limit +++ Dividend of € 6.00 per share of common stock proposed +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group achieved its business objectives for financial year 2023, as forecasted. Despite strong competition and volatile conditions, the company successfully maintained its profitable growth and defended its leading position in the global premium segment: A total of 2,554,183 premium vehicles were delivered to customers in the year to the end of December (2022: 2,399,632 units / +6.4%) ‒ including 717,620 units in the fourth quarter (Q4 2022: 651,794 units / +10.1%). Deliveries for the full year had a solid increase, resulting in a market share of 3.3%.\n\nHigh demand for its products was the driver for the BMW Group’s continuing strong financial performance: The Group EBT margin came in at 11.0% (2022: 16.5%; Q4: 8.6%; Q4 2022: 8.2%), above the strategic target of 10%. The EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment of 9.8% (2022: 8.6%; Q4: 8.5%; Q4 2022: 8.5%) was within the forecast target range of 9.0-10.5%.\n\n+++ BMW Group sales reach new all-time high of 2,555,341 units in 2023 (+6.5%) +++ BMW Group BEV sales at 15%, with growth across all sales regions worldwide +++ BMW brand once again tops global premium segment in 2023; electric models see significant growth (+92.2%) +++ Rolls-Royce and Motorrad brands also report new highs +++ Jochen Goller: “Record sales for 2023 show desirability of our strong brands. Customers worldwide value our highly attractive product offering – across all drive technologies.” +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group delivered a total of 2,555,341 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers last year (+6.5%) – a new all-time sales high for the company. The BMW, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad brands also reported new record highs in 2023. In the fourth quarter, BMW Group sales climbed to 718,778 units, up +10.3% on the previous year.\n\n“Thanks to close co-operation with our retail partners and driven by the strong performance of our associates, the BMW Group was able to achieve a new all-time sales high for 2023. Customers around the world appreciate our strong brands BMW, MINI, Motorrad and Rolls-Royce and in particular the choice of different drive technologies across the entire BMW Group product range“, said Jochen Goller, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales. “With our new, highly attractive and technologically outstanding vehicles, we were able to ramp up electromobility even more dynamically in 2023 and achieve the goal of 15% of total sales from fully-electric vehicles”, Goller continued.\n\n+++ Zipse: “Right on track to meet our goals for the year” +++ Group EBT margin of 10.6% in Q3 and 11.9% in YTD September +++ Automotive EBIT margin of 9.8% in Q3 and 10.3% in YTD September +++ Free cash flow of € 5.8 billion in Automotive Segment in YTD September +++ Percentage of BEV deliveries increases to 15.1% in Q3 +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group is maintaining its course for profitable growth in a volatile business environment. The company once again reaffirmed its leading position in the global premium segment, with a solid increase in sales to 621,699 premium automobiles in the third quarter and 1,836,563 units over the nine-month-period (Q3 2022: 587,744 units/+5.8%; 2022: 1,747,838 units/+5.1%).\n\nThe BMW Group combined this growth with a strong financial performance: The EBT margin for the first nine months came in at 11.9% (2022: 19.6%; Q3: 10.6%; Q3 2022: 11.0%), with an EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment of 10.3% (2022: 8.7%; Q3: 9.8%; Q3 2022: 8.9%). Excluding depreciation for BBA assets from the purchase price allocation, the EBIT margin was 10.8% in the third quarter (Q3/2022: 10.1%) and 11.4% (Sept YTD/2022: 11.7%) after nine months.\n\n+++ BMW Group third-quarter sales up +5.8% +++ BEV deliveries climb +79.6% in Q3 +++ Deliveries of fully-electric BMW vehicles double once again (+100.3%) +++ BMW brand remains number one in global premium segment, builds on strong competitive position +++ Pieter Nota: “Overall, we are on track to meet our growth targets for 2023. Our sales of fully-electric vehicles significantly outperformed the total BEV market in the first nine months – clearly underlining the appeal of our products.” +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group sold 93,931 fully-electric BMW and MINI vehicles in the third quarter – an increase of +79.6% compared to the same period of last year. The BMW brand once again doubled its third-quarter deliveries of fully-electric vehicles from the same period of last year (+100.3%). The company was thus able to translate customer interest in its fully-electric products into dynamic growth.\n\n“The sales success of the third quarter shows that our customers appreciate our wide range of attractive products across all drive technologies. Our fully-electric products, in particular, are benefiting from high demand worldwide – as seen in our BEV sales, which significantly outperformed the total BEV market in the first nine months,” said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales. “Overall, we are on track to meet our growth targets for 2023,” Nota continued.\n\n+++ Reithofer: “BMW Group has strengthened its competitive leadership position under Oliver Zipse” +++ Jochen Goller succeeds Pieter Nota as Board Member for Customer, Brands, Sales +++ Supervisory Board thanks Nota for great commitment and important impulses +++\n\nMunich. The Supervisory Board of BMW AG has today extended the contract of Oliver Zipse as Chairman of the Board of Management until 2026. Zipse has been a member of the Board of Management since 2015 and Chairman of the Board since August 2019. During his term of office, the BMW Group significantly expanded its range of electric vehicles and today offers fully electric models in almost all of its core segments. In addition, development began on the Neue Klasse as the next model generation, with production starting in 2025.\n\nNorbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of BMW AG, said: “Oliver Zipse has very successfully steered the company in recent years through an extremely volatile environment. In a phase of global crises and profound transformation, the BMW Group has not only achieved reliably robust results under his leadership, but has also sustainably strengthened its leading position in global competition. With the Neue Klasse, the BMW Group is well on track to further expand this position.”\n\n+++ Higher sales target and automotive EBIT margin for 2023 +++ Group EBT margin comes in at 12.6% for HY1 +++ Automotive EBIT margin at 10.6% after six months +++ Free cash flow of € 3.1 billion in Automotive Segment in YTD June +++ Deliveries of fully-electric BMW vehicles up 133% +++ Zipse: “Economic success during the transformation” +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group delivered a strong financial and operating performance in a difficult environment in the first half of 2023. In the first six months, the premium automotive manufacturer achieved a Group EBT margin of 12.6% and an EBIT margin of 10.6% in the Automotive Segment. In the second quarter, the Group EBT margin came in at 11.3% (Q2 2022: 11.3%). In the Automotive Segment, the EBIT margin increased to 9.2% (Q2 2022: 8.2%).\n\nAs previously reported in an ad hoc announcement, the company is now planning for solid growth in deliveries for the full year 2023 (previously slight growth). Growth drivers should be highly priced models as well as fully electric vehicles. BEV models are set to account for 15% of total vehicle sales. The EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment is now projected to be within the range of 9-10.5% (previously 8-10%).\n\nMunich. The BMW Group updated its full-year outlook for 2023 today. Given the solid operational performance in the first half of 2023, the company expects positive momentum in the business during the second half of the year. This is built on the ongoing strength of the order bank and an expected improvement in the availability of its premium vehicles.\n\nThe BMW Group made the following changes to their guidance on financial indicators:\n\nAutomotive segment deliveries to customers is expected to see solid growth over the prior-year level (previously: slight growth).\n\nIn the Automotive segment, the EBIT margin for full year 2023 is anticipated to be within the corridor of 9% to 10.5% (previously: 8% to 10%)\n\nIn the Automotive segment, Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) is expected to be between 18% and 22% (previously: 15% to 20%)\n\nThe Financial Services segment Return on Equity (RoE) is expected to be between 16% and 19% (previously: 14% to 17%).\n\nAdditionally, free cash flow in the Automotive segment is now anticipated to be above €6 billion for the full year 2023, taking into account higher investments in the transformation to electromobility as well as increased inventories to ensure the necessary supply of vehicles to the markets.\n\n+++ BMW Group posts significant second-quarter sales growth (+11.3%) +++ Deliveries of fully-electric BMW vehicles more than doubled again: BMW Group +117.5%; brand BMW +150.7% +++ BMW brand continues to be No. 1 in worldwide premium segment +++ Sales increase across all key regions +++ Pieter Nota: “We have the right products on the market. The BMW Group will continue its successful electromobility ramp-up in the second half of the year.” +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group delivered a total of 88,289 fully-electric BMW and MINI vehicles to customers in the second quarter of 2023 – and once again succeeded in more than doubling its BEV sales from the same period of last year (+117.5%). All major regions saw significant sales growth for fully-electric models – underlining the wide appeal of these models to customers worldwide.\n\n“Strong sales development in general and especially for our fully-electric vehicles, shows that we have the right products on the market at the right time. The BMW Group will continue its successful ramp-up of electromobility at a high pace in the second half of the year,” said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. “We are winning over customers worldwide with our young and attractive product line-up. Due to our diverse offering – ranging from highly efficient combustion engines to fully electric models – we are addressing the wide variety of customer needs around the globe in an ideal way,” Nota added.\n\n+++ 5 years plus two one-year extension options +++ Syndication process underlines sustainable corporate profile of BMW Group +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group has signed a €8.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with a tenor of five years and two one-year extension options.\n\nA total of 43 international and regional banks from Europe, America and Asia have taken part in the transaction. With BNP Paribas, Citi and Deutsche Bank as coordinating bookrunners, the BMW Group has replaced the existing RCF of €8.0 billion signed in 2017.\n\nFor the first time, the BMW Group has consistently presented its strategic focus on sustainability within the syndication process: First, it handed a newly developed, comprehensive sustainability factsheet over to the banks involved to provide transparent information on its progress and goals. In a second step, the BMW Group issued questionnaires to the lenders, aiming at reflecting the outside-in perspectives of its sustainability performance, providing impetus for the continuous further development of sustainability communications.\n\n+++ NEUE KLASSE to be released in 2025, local production in Shenyang for China from 2026 +++ BBA to invest RMB 10 billion in construction of assembly plant for sixth-generation high-voltage batteries in China +++ Global production network for high-voltage batteries based on “local for local” principle +++\n\nShenyang. To mark the 20th anniversary of the BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BBA) joint venture, Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production, today announced local production of the NEUE KLASSE in China. Following the market launch in 2025, models of the next vehicle generation will also be produced from 2026 onwards by BBA in Shenyang. The high-voltage batteries required for this will likewise be manufactured locally. The virtual ground-breaking for a new assembly site for high-voltage batteries also took place as part of the anniversary celebrations. BBA is investing RMB 10 billion in the new location, which will produce battery cells for the next, sixth generation of high-voltage batteries from 2026 onwards. The “Sixth-Generation Battery Project” will play a key role in production of vehicles for the NEUE KLASSE and create around 2,000 new jobs in the region.\n\n“From a small assembly facility with a limited number of units, our plants in Shenyang have developed into our largest production location worldwide. Today, 20 years after our joint venture’s initial start of production, I am delighted to announce local production of the NEUE KLASSE in China,” declared Milan Nedeljković in Shenyang. “Integration of the NEUE KLASSE into our production in China goes hand in hand with construction of a high-voltage battery assembly for the next, sixth generation of batteries and will make a significant contribution to further electrification of our lineup and, therefore, to our success as a company.”\n\n+++ Speech Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG +++ General Annual Meeting +++ Munich, 11 May 2023, 10.00 a.m. CEST +++\n\nWe move body, heart and mind. The BMW Group – your company,\n\nDear Shareholders! Today is one of the days of the year that I particularly look forward to.

You are invested in a company with ambitious goals. Thanks to our focus and determination, you can rely on us to realise our plans – in the short, medium and long term, year in, year out. That is what you expect from us – and we deliver!\n\n+++ Zipse: “Our compelling products inspire customers all over the world” +++ Group EBT margin at 13.9% +++ Automotive EBIT margin climbs to 12.1% +++ Free cash flow of around € 2 billion in Auto Segment +++ Sales of BMW BEVs up 112% +++ 2023 Guidance confirmed in continuing volatility +++\n\nMunich. With its fresh and attractive portfolio and a strong product mix, the BMW Group continued on its successful course in the first quarter of 2023. The company’s strong operating performance was confirmed by its margins: The Group EBT margin for the three-month period came in at 13.9%, while the EBIT margin for the Automotive Segment increased to 12.1%. The BMW Group’s operating financial strength is also reflected in the free cash flow of € 1,981 million in the Automotive Segment.\n\nWith its popular premium vehicles, the BMW Group benefited from positive development in many automotive markets and from continued stable pricing for both new and used cars. Sales momentum came from the electrified product line-up as well as models of higher classes, which are among the youngest in the market. Sales of BMW BEV models more than doubled to 55,979 deliveries (2022: 26,362 units/+112.3%).\n\n+++ Repurchased shares to be largely cancelled, reducing share capital accordingly +++\n\nMunich. Today, the Board of Management of the Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG) approved a further share buy-back programme in a volume of up to 2 billion EUR (total purchase price excluding ancillary acquisition costs), which is scheduled to start upon conclusion of the first buy-back programme. The latter was started in July 2022 and is expected to be completed in mid-2023. The authorization to repurchase up to 10% of the share capital within five years was granted by the Annual General Meeting of BMW AG in May 2022.\n\nThis second repurchase programme is also applicable to both common and preferred shares. The volume attributed to preferred shares is limited to a maximum of EUR 350 million. The second programme will be concluded no later than December 31, 2025.\n\nIts primary objective is to redeem the repurchased shares and to reduce share capital correspondingly. In addition, it may also be used to transfer shares to employees of BMW AG or a group company within the framework of an employee share program.\n\n+++ Pieter Nota: “BMW Group on track for slight sales growth in the full year 2023. Main growth drivers will be fully-electric vehicles and models from the high-end premium segment” +++ BMW Group sells 588,138 units worldwide in Q1 (-1.5%) +++ BMW Group: First-quarter BEV sales climb +83.2% to 64,647 units +++ BMW brand: Sales of fully-electric vehicles more than double to 55,979 units (+112.3%) +++ US market up +11.4%, with 89,750 BMW and MINI deliveries +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group posted significant growth in its global sales of fully-electric vehicles (+83.2%) in the first quarter of 2023. Overall, the BMW Group delivered a total of 64,647 fully-electric BMW and MINI vehicles to customers in the first three months of the year. The BMW brand was able to more than double its sales of fully-electric vehicles in the first quarter, with 55,979 units delivered to customers (+112.3%).\n\n“Our strong product lineup continues to inspire our customers worldwide. Our fully-electric vehicles, in particular, are benefiting from high demand around the globe. We were therefore able to maintain the dynamic pace of our electromobility ramp-up in the first quarter,” said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales. “The BMW Group is on track for slight sales growth in the full year 2023. The main growth drivers in 2023 will be fully-electric vehicles and models from the high-end premium segment – like the new BMW i7*, the new BMW 7 Series, the BMW XM* and the updated BMW X7,” Nota continued.\n\n+++ Zipse: “Proven strengths, future-oriented technologies and NEUE KLASSE as a recipe for success” +++ EBIT margin for 2023 expected within 8-10% range +++ High demand: 15% BEV share in 2023 +++ Dynamic BEV growth in coming years +++ Double-digit growth in high-end segment in 2023 +++ Further decrease in CO₂ emissions planned for 2023 +++ Concrete outlook for NEUE KLASSE – plants, models +++ More details on NEUE KLASSE at IAA Mobility +++\n\nMunich. With the prospect of profitable growth in a persistently challenging business environment, combined with a very dynamic increase in sales of electric vehicles, the BMW Group is looking ahead to financial year 2023, with tailwinds from last year's success — based on highly attractive and technologically outstanding products. The company is taking this momentum into the home straight as it prepares for the launch of its next product generation, the NEUE KLASSE, in two years. The proven strengths of the present and the focus on future-oriented technologies will lay the foundation for the success of this future product generation.\n\nThe main growth drivers in 2023 will be fully-electric (BEV) vehicles and models from the high-end premium segment — such as the new BMW 7 Series, the updated BMW X7 and the Rolls-Royce model family. In this upper segment, the BMW Group expects growth in the mid-double-digit percentage range for the current financial year, with BEV models even likely to grow in the high double-digit percentage range. Overall, the BMW Group expects its deliveries to customers worldwide to increase slightly in the Automotive Segment in 2023.\n\n+++ Nicolas Peter to retire in May +++\n\nMunich. The Supervisory Board of BMW AG appointed Walter Mertl (49) as the new Board of Management member responsible for Finance during its meeting today. He takes over from Nicolas Peter (60), who will retire after the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023.\n\n“The BMW Group has been very fortunate to have such a strategic CFO with Nicolas Peter,” said Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of BMW AG. “Over the past, highly volatile years, the company profited from his profound expertise and exceptionally sound judgement. Nicolas Peter deserves our utmost thanks for his three decades of successful management shaped by his vision and entrepreneurial spirit: He has displayed tremendous leadership qualities while playing an instrumental role in shaping the development of the BMW Group, using his extensive knowledge of the company and its operating environment. His efforts secured the company’s excellent reputation in the capital markets and with the broader public. The company owes Nicolas Peter a debt of gratitude for major advances in its transformation – while, at the same time, remaining focused on its long-term profitability.”\n\n+++ High Group EBT: € 23.5 billion – EBT margin: 16.5% +++ Automotive EBIT: € 10.6 billion – EBIT margin on target at 8.6% (excluding effects of BBA full consolidation: 11.2%) +++ Strong free cash flow (automotive): € 11.1 billion +++ CO2 emissions of EU new vehicle fleet at 105.0 g/km (WLTP) – well below applicable emission target (127.5 g/km) +++ Dividend of € 8.50 per share of common stock proposed +++ Zipse: “We achieved solid performance under volatile conditions” +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group met its targets for 2022, as forecasted, and thus delivered a strong operating performance in a difficult business environment. The premium manufacturer significantly increased Group EBT (€ 23,509 million/ +46.4%) and net profit (€ 18,582 million/ +49.1%) from the previous year. This positive development can be attributed to improved pricing and positive product-mix effects, as well as the full consolidation of the Chinese joint venture, BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BBA). The latter also made a large cash contribution (€ 5,011 million) on 11 February 2022 to a significantly higher free cash flow of € 11,071 million in the Automotive Segment.\n\nRising sales of fully-electric models, which were up 107.7% in 2022, accounted for 9% of deliveries in 2022 and helped further lower the CO2 emissions value of the new vehicle fleet in the EU. Based on preliminary calculations, this figure came in at 105.0 grams of CO2 per km (WLTP). This represents a decrease of (-)9.4% – significantly outperforming the value for the previous year and the applicable emissions target by 22.5 g/km (prev. yr.: 115.9 g/km). The BMW Group is forging ahead with electrification of its product lineup and aims to raise the share of fully-electric vehicles in its total deliveries to 15% this year.\n\n+++ Germany’s first certified Fair Pay Leader +++\n\nMunich. BMW AG is the first company in Germany to be awarded top-level certification from the Fair Pay Innovation Lab (FPI). The document reaffirms the fact that the company’s remuneration structures are fair, with no significant difference between the overall remuneration packages of women and men. Based in Berlin, the FPI is a globally recognised certification organisation for fair pay. The award of the Universal Fair Pay Check, under the patronage of the German Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Hubertus Heil, was announced by the FPI today, 7 March, on international Equal Pay Day.\n\n“This is an accolade we are particularly proud of because it proves that our remuneration structures work. For us, fair salaries are a given and an integral part of our corporate culture, which is based on transparency, appreciation and respect. The BMW Group believes in performance and reward in fair working conditions and an environment that offers career opportunities for all our talented staff,” said Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Real Estate, and Labour Director.\n\n+++ Export Value From South Carolina Plant Totals Nearly $9.6 Billion +++ 416,301 Sports Activity Vehicles and Coupes Produced in the U.S. Last Year +++ Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles Total More Than 16% of Production +++ Milan Nedeljković, Board Member for Production: “I am proud of the Spartanburg plant's continued performance” +++\n\nSpartanburg, S.C. For the ninth consecutive year, BMW Manufacturing led the nation in automotive exports by value, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The South Carolina plant exported 227,029 BMW Sports Activity Vehicles and Coupes during 2022 with an export value of nearly $9.6 billion.

More than 17,000 BMWs were exported via rail.\n\nDuring 2022, Germany became the top export market from BMW Manufacturing (15.5% of export volume), followed by China (13.5%), South Korea (12.8%), Canada (7.5%), and Great Britain (5.6%).\n\n“Free trade and open markets enable growth and prosperity. BMW and South Carolina are a good example of this,” said Milan Nedeljković, BMW AG Board Member for Production. \"I am proud of the Spartanburg plant's continued performance, which contributes to the success of the BMW Group.\"\n\n+++ Rio Tinto’s aluminium production relies on local hydroelectric power +++ Innovative electrolysis method eliminates all process-related CO2 emissions +++ Potential use of up to 50 percent secondary material +++ Set to supply US vehicle production at Plant Spartanburg +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group is continuing its efforts to systematically reduce CO2 emissions in the supply chain. A particular focus is on CO2-intensive materials like aluminium, steel and plastics. The BMW Group therefore intends to source aluminium with significantly reduced CO2 emissions from Rio Tinto’s hydro-powered operations in Canada starting in 2024 and has signed a memorandum of understanding to this effect. Compared to conventionally manufactured aluminium, this approach can save around 70 percent of CO2 emissions. The planned supply volumes will be used exclusively in vehicle production at BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in the US state of South Carolina, in body components like the bonnet, for instance.\n\n“We have clear goals for lowering CO2 emissions in the supply chain. By using innovative materials, we can reduce our vehicles’ carbon footprint – even before handing them over to customers. The agreement to supply low-carbon aluminium is based on several pillars: in addition to hydroelectric power and a high percentage of secondary material, we also want to lead the automotive industry by ramping up our use of aluminium with no direct CO2 emissions from the smelting process,” explains Joachim Post, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network.\n\n+++ Investment of € 800 million in Mexican production site for integration of fully-electric models of NEUE KLASSE and construction of local high-voltage battery assembly +++ Around 1,000 new jobs for Plant San Luis Potosí +++ Head of Production Nedeljković: “We are systematically gearing our production network towards electromobility” +++\n\nSan Luis Potosí, Mexico. The BMW Group is accelerating its ramp-up of e-mobility and poised to gain even more momentum with its next vehicle generation, the NEUE KLASSE. The share of 50 percent of the company's worldwide sales of fully electric vehicles could be reached earlier than 2030.

The plant in San Luis Potosí, Mexico will produce fully-electric models for the NEUE KLASSE in the future and is setting up its own high-voltage battery assembly for this purpose.\n\n“We are systematically gearing our production network towards electromobility. In Mexico, we are investing 800 million euros in our plant and creating around 1,000 new jobs,” explained Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production, in San Luis Potosí at an event attended by Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Governor of San Luis Potosí Ricardo Gallardo Cardona.\n\n+++ Based on preliminary internal calculations, EU fleet-wide emissions came in at 105 grams CO2 per kilometre (WLTP) for 2022 +++ Year-on-year reduction of more than nine percent expected +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group continued to systematically reduce its emissions and, based on preliminary internal calculations, lowered its EU fleet-wide CO2 emissions by more than nine percent from 2021 to 2022.\n\nWith emissions of 105 grams per kilometre, according to WLTP (2021: 115.9 grams per kilometre), based on preliminary calculations for 2022, the company once again outperformed the fleet target limit set by the European Union EU27+2 (EU, Norway, Iceland) of 127 grams per kilometre by 22 grams.\n\nIn addition to further increases in vehicle efficiency, the reduction in emissions can largely be attributed to successful implementation of the company’s electrification strategy. The BMW Group sold a total of more than 215,000 fully-electric vehicles worldwide in 2022 – an increase of almost 108 percent, compared to the previous year. Fully-electric vehicles accounted for nearly nine percent of total sales last year. The goal is to increase this figure to 15 percent in 2023. The BMW Group also aims for more than 50 percent of its sales volumes to come from fully-electric vehicles no later than 2030.\n\n+++ Start of the next phase of joint research and development +++ BMW Group intends to adopt Solid Power’s cell pilot production lines at its own Cell Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) +++ Working towards the long term goal: ASSB technology for series production +++\n\nMunich. Under an expanded Joint Development Agreement, BMW Group and Solid Power have added a research and development license as a basis for their common next steps. This license enables BMW to establish an ASSB prototype line in its Cell Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) in Parsdorf near Munich.\n\nThe broadened relationship provides significant benefits to both companies, including conducting complementary cell development and manufacturing activities at both Solid Power and the BMW Group to further advance all-solid-state cell design and manufacturing know-how.\n\n“BMW remains committed to the pursuit of all-solid-state batteries, a technology which we believe has significant potential for the future,” said Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management BMW AG, Development. “We look forward to working even more closely with Solid Power and adding the capability to produce solid-state cells based on Solid Power’s designs at our own pilot facility. We expect this agreement to accelerate the installation of our solid-state prototype line and our companies’ mutual goal of commercializing this promising cell technology.”\n\n+++ BMW Group sold 2,399,636 units (-4.8%) +++ BMW brand maintained No. 1 position in global premium segment +++ Sales of fully-electric vehicles more than doubled to 215,755 units (+107.7%) +++ Sales up +10.6% in fourth quarter of 2022 +++ MINI Electric* is best-selling MINI model variant +++ Pieter Nota: “Next milestone for 2023: 15% of total sales from fully-electric vehicles” +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group significantly accelerated its ramp-up of electromobility once more in 2022. As previously announced, the BMW Group was able to more than double its BEV sales from 2021 (+107.7%) with a total of 215,755 fully-electric BMW and MINI vehicles delivered to customers. A major milestone was reached when the BMW Group handed over its 500,000th fully-electric vehicle to its new owner towards the end of last year.\n\n“Our strong product line-up is the best response to a challenging environment – and enabled us to more than double our sales of fully-electric vehicles again in 2022,” said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales. “We are confident we can build on this success in 2023, as we continue to see particularly high order intake for our fully-electric models,” Nota added.\n\nThe BMW Group delivered a total of 2,399,636 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide in 2022 (-4.8%); a year in which all industries faced headwinds from supply bottlenecks, China’s pandemic lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. The main impact was felt in the first six months of the year, with deliveries down compared to the previous year. Sales increasingly picked up in the second half of 2022. In the fourth quarter, the BMW Group reported significant sales growth of +10.6%, with 651,798 vehicles delivered to customers.\n\n+++ Manufacture of small-series BMW iX5 Hydrogen at the Research and Innovation Centre’s pilot plant in Munich +++ Test fleet will go into service worldwide from spring 2023 +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group is commencing production of its BMW iX5 Hydrogen model.

The first ever Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) featuring hydrogen fuel cell technology has already completed an intensive programme of testing under demanding conditions during the development phase and will now be used as a technology demonstrator for locally carbon-free mobility in selected regions from spring 2023.\n\n“Hydrogen is a versatile energy source that has a key role to play as we progress towards climate neutrality,” says Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Development. “We are certain that hydrogen is set to gain significantly in importance for individual mobility and therefore consider a mixture of battery and fuel cell electric drive systems to be a sensible approach in the long term. Fuel cells don’t require any critical raw materials such as cobalt, lithium or nickel either, so by investing in this type of drive system we are also strengthening the geopolitical resilience of the BMW Group. Our BMW iX5 Hydrogen test fleet will allow us to gain new and valuable insights, enabling us to present customers with an attractive product range once the hydrogen economy becomes a widespread reality.”\n\nThe BMW iX5 Hydrogen is being built in the BMW Group’s pilot plant at its Research and Innovation Centre in Munich. This is the interface between development and production where every new model from one of the company’s brands is made for the first time. Around 900 people work there in the body shop, assembly, model engineering, concept vehicle construction and additive manufacturing. They each work on up to six vehicle projects simultaneously and are tasked with ensuring that both the product and the manufacturing process are ready for series production. In the case of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen, specialists in hydrogen technology, vehicle development and initial assembly of new models have been working closely together to integrate the cutting-edge drive and energy storage technology.\n\n+++ Investment in US startup Jetti Resources +++ More efficient and resource-conserving raw material extraction +++ 40% CO2-reduction through utilization of mine waste +++\n\nMunich / Mountain View (USA). Through its venture capital fund BMW I Ventures, the BMW Group has taken a stake in US (Colorado) based company, Jetti Resources. The goal is to foster responsible and resource-conserving copper extraction to address rising demand in a more sustainable way. Founded in 2014, Jetti Resources has developed a pioneering process for copper extraction that utilizes previously unused ore from existing copper mines.\n\n“By investing in Jetti, we are supporting technological progress in the field of copper extraction, with a focus on responsible and resource-conserving methods,” says Wolfgang Obermaier, Head of Indirect Goods and Services, Raw Materials, Production Partners of the BMW Group. “This new process has the potential to improve the environmental footprint and integrity of our supply chain, even with growing demand for resources like copper,” Obermaier adds.\n\nAs copper is a vital raw material to produce electric drivetrains in EVs, demand is forecasted to grow substantially in the coming years. As early as 2030, at least half of BMW Group's global sales will consist of fully electric vehicles.\n\n+++ In addition to vehicle production, BMW Group builds high-voltage battery assembly at Plant Debrecen +++ More than 500 additional jobs to be created by 2025 +++ Production of NEUE KLASSE starts here +++\n\nDebrecen, Hungary. The BMW Group is building a high-voltage battery assembly for the vehicles of the NEUE KLASSE at its site in Hungary. The battery assembly will be located on the site of the Debrecen vehicle plant, which started construction about six months ago. The company will create more than 500 additional jobs and invest over two billion euros in the construction and launch of the entire plant by the end of 2025.\n\nMilan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Production, said: “In Debrecen, we are building the most advanced plant in the world. With our iFACTORY, we are setting new industry standards for vehicle production. Our investments underline our systematic approach to implementing e-mobility.”\n\nThe new announcements were also welcomed by the Hungarian government. Péter Szijjártó, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, said: “The BMW Group plant in Debrecen is a symbol of the successful Hungarian economic policy of the past twelve years. The plant combines environmental protection and competitiveness, and that is much more than we have originally planned.”\n\n+++ Innovative event concept for award ceremony at BMW Welt in Munich +++ Sixth BMW Group Supplier Innovation Award presented +++ Purchasing head Post: “Award recognises innovation and cooperative partnership with our suppliers – especially in challenging times” +++\n\nMunich. Innovations form the basis for the economic success and future competitiveness of the BMW Group. Suppliers’ ability to innovate plays an important part in this, making a vital contribution by driving developments forward and enabling the use of outstanding technologies in BMW Group vehicles. In recognition of this, the company presented its BMW Group Supplier Innovation Award to suppliers who have made an extraordinary contribution to innovations for the sixth time this year.\n\n“Innovations are key to the success of our transformation towards electromobility, digitalisation and sustainability. Our award ceremony recognises innovation and cooperative partnership with our suppliers – especially in challenging times,” said Joachim Post, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network at the ceremony held at BMW Welt in Munich.\n\nThe coveted award was presented in a total of six categories: drive train and e-mobility, sustainability, digitalisation, customer experience, newcomer of the year and exceptional team performance.\n\n“The future will increasingly be decided by innovations and technologies,” said Post over the course of the evening, which he hosted together with his digital co-moderator, Aumovis. He continued: “You must have the courage to tackle a challenge – even if it seems to be unattainable and others don’t give the idea much chance of success.”\n\n+++ New supply agreements in US and China +++ Lower CO2 emissions for over one third of global steel purchasing volume +++ Focus on innovative technologies, renewable energies and circular economy +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group is systematically pursuing its climate goals for the supplier network and significantly reducing the carbon footprint of its steel sourcing. Following initial contracts with European suppliers, the BMW Group has now concluded further agreements for the supply of CO2-reduced steel in the US and China.\n\n“Steel is one of the main sources of CO2 emissions in our supply chain. That is why we are comprehensively reorganising our steel portfolio – so we can supply our global production network with over on third of CO2-reduced steel from 2026. This will reduce the carbon footprint of our supply chain by 900,000 tonnes per year, while at the same time driving the transformation of the steel industry,” said Joachim Post, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network.\n\nIn the medium term, the BMW Group will increase CO2 savings through agreements with additional steel suppliers and thus consistently drive forward the decarbonization of its supplier network. Around 20 percent of supply chain CO2 emissions for a mid-sized fully-electric vehicle are attributable to steel – which comes in third, after battery cells and aluminium. With its versatile properties, steel is nevertheless one of the key materials for automotive manufacturing and will be no less important for future vehicle concepts and generations.\n\n+++ As promised: Fully-electric models from all German plants +++ Short distances: high-voltage battery for BMW iX1* also from Regensburg +++ Over 3,300 employees work in BMW Group’s electric component production +++\n\nRegensburg. Today’s start of production for the fully-electric BMW iX1* in Regensburg illustrates the pace with which the BMW Group is ramping up electromobility. As announced almost two years ago, all German plants can now produce electric cars. The smallest model among the BMW Sports Activity Vehicles will boost the volume of electric vehicles. Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production, already announced the next milestone at the start of production: “We are delivering the goods. By 2024, at least one in three BMWs coming out of our Bavarian plants will be an electric car.” Further proof, then, that the BMW Group is systematically implementing its electrification strategy, relying on speed and short distances. The high-voltage battery in the BMW iX1* also comes from Regensburg.\n\nBavarian Minister of Transport Christian Bernreiter: “Bavaria is Germany’s number-one state for cars and has a long tradition of building vehicles. However, that success doesn’t just lie in the achievements of the past, but also in research, development and innovation. The BMW iX1* and its high-voltage battery underline that BMW can master the future. That this fully-electric car will come off the production line in Regensburg also represents a strong commitment to Bavaria as a car-building location.”\n\n+++ World premiere of ///M Mixed Reality at Web Summit 2022 in Lisbon +++ Revolutionary use of Mixed Reality technologies brings real cars onto virtual racetracks +++\n\nMunich/Lisbon.

In an uneven economic environment, the BMW Group once again delivered a strong operating performance in the third quarter. Its solid financial key figures are evidence of the company’s economic success in the face of rising raw material and energy costs.\n\n“Compelling products are the best answer to a challenging environment. They give us stability in the present and create growth prospects for the future. We are systematically investing, for this reason, in the technology clusters of the NEUE KLASSE. We firmly believe that these highly innovative products will take our offering to the next level,” said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, on Thursday. “Our solid third-quarter results underline that flexibility creates resilience. Especially under volatile conditions, our globally balanced footprint and technology-open approach are proving to be a key success factor. That is why, after nine months, we are on track to meet our targets for the year. The market success of our fully-electric models, in particular, means we can look forward to the coming months with confidence.”\n\nThe significant growth in sales of fully-electric and electrified vehicles is also reflected in the decrease in CO2 emissions in the EU new vehicle fleet: The BMW Group could well outperform its previous target and, based on current data, reduce its EU fleet emissions by 5-10% year-on-year. A slight reduction (up to -4.9%) had previously been planned.\n\n+++ Complete process chain for high-voltage battery production in Leipzig +++ Five cell coating lines, an additional module line and two high-voltage battery lines by 2024 +++ Production of e-components for forthcoming fully electric MINI Countryman made in Leipzig +++\n\nLeipzig.

The foundation stone has been laid for the BMW Group’s new plant in Debrecen, Hungary. The new facility comes after an investment of more than €1 billion and will launch series production of the fully electric Neue Klasse in 2025. “Plant Debrecen will set new standards in highly innovative vehicle manufacturing,” said BMW AG Board Member for Production Milan Nedeljković at the foundation stone-laying ceremony. “This plant is state-of-the-art in terms of flexibility, sustainability and digitalisation in the entire automotive industry.”\n\nThe BMW Group consistently pursues a strategy of profitable growth. “The new plant in Hungary will play a key role in the transformation to electric mobility for both the BMW Group and its production network,” said Nedeljković at the ceremony. “It’s another important building block in our capacity and will support our long-term volume growth.” By building up further capacities in Europe, the company is strengthening the balance of production volumes between the American, Chinese and European markets.\n\n+++ Closed-loop material cycle for nickel, lithium and cobalt +++ Raw materials to be used in production of new battery cells +++ CO2 emissions around 70% lower than from primary materials +++\n\nMunich/Shenyang. The BMW Group is stepping up its commitment to achieving climate neutrality and massively expanding its use of secondary material in closed recycling loops. For the first time in China, the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture (BBA) has established a closed loop for reuse of the raw materials nickel, lithium and cobalt from high-voltage batteries that are no longer suitable for use in electric vehicles. The batteries come from fully and partially-electric development vehicles, test systems and production rejects and, in the future, also from end-of-life vehicles. In this way, the company is laying the foundation for a pioneering material cycle, which is becoming increasingly important as e-mobility ramps up. To realise this, BBA is working with a local recycler that dismantles retired batteries and uses innovative technology to recover a high percentage of the raw materials nickel, lithium and cobalt from the battery cells. The raw materials obtained in this way are then used in production of new battery cells for the BMW Group. The closed-loop material cycle conserves resources and, at the same time, reduces CO2 emissions by 70%, compared to using newly extracted primary material.\n\nJochen Goller, head of BMW Group Region China: “In light of the growing scarcity of finite resources and rising commodity prices, it is especially important to push forward with the circular economy, increase the percentage of reusable materials and reduce our dependence on raw materials. The BMW Group will expand its recycling concept in China in the future – which will not only contribute to environmental protection, but also effectively support China’s transition to a low-CO2 economy.”\n\n+++ Approvals granted for commissioning of production in Parsdorf +++ Near-standard production of samples for next-generation battery cells +++ Start of production in late 2022 +++\n\nMunich/Parsdorf. The BMW Group will open its Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CCMC) in the autumn. With the immission control approval procedure now completed, the necessary conditions are in place for commissioning of near-standard production of lithium-ion battery cells at the competence centre in Parsdorf, outside of Munich. In an area spanning around 15,000 square metres, the BMW Group will demonstrate industrial feasibility of future generations of high-performance battery cells. The pilot line at the competence centre will make it possible to analyse and fully understand cell value creation processes. This will enable future suppliers to produce cells to the BMW Group’s own specifications and thereby further optimise battery cell production with regard to quality, output and costs. The company is currently ruling out the option of establishing its own large-scale battery cell production.\n\nMarkus Fallböhmer, head of Production Engines, E-Drives at the BMW Group: “The Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre in Parsdorf is the next logical step towards penetrating all aspects of the battery cell value chain. Following successful implementation of the Battery Cell Competence Centre (BCCC), we are now focusing on the production processes. We are validating the manufacturability of lithium-ion battery cells for large-scale standard production, with regard to quality, efficiency and costs.”\n\nInnovative corrosion protection and matt paint without fossil resources lower CO2 emissions by 40 percent\n\nMunich. The BMW Group is using innovative technologies in its efforts to improve sustainability and taking advantage of new options to conserve resources and reduce emissions from painting bodywork. The BMW Group is the first automotive manufacturer worldwide to use matt paints made from biomass instead of crude oil at its European plants. In addition to this, BMW Group Plants Leipzig and Rosslyn (South Africa) are also using sustainably-produced corrosion protection. Renewable raw materials such as bio-waste or waste from sewage treatment plants serve as the starting material for the paints. The CO2 savings determined in a TÜV-certified process amount to over 15,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions between now and 2030.\n\n“By reducing our use of fossil raw materials, we can conserve natural resources and lower CO2 emissions at the same time. To achieve this, we are increasingly relying on sustainability innovations in our supplier network,” says Joachim Post, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network. “Innovative paints based on renewable raw materials are an important step in this direction.”\n\n+++ Zipse: “Strength and resilience of BMW Group particularly evident in challenging environment” +++ Group EBT rises to € 12.2 billion +++ Free cash flow of € 4.8 billion in auto segment +++ BEV sales increased by almost 150% +++ Guidance confirmed despite high volatility +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group further strengthened its competitive position as well as its profitability in the first quarter of 2022, thanks to sustained high demand for its premium vehicles.\n\nThe company’s quarterly financial statements also include positive effects from the full consolidation of the Chinese joint venture, BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd (BBA), as previously announced.\n\nEven without these effects, margins of BMW Group were strong – a proof point of its financial strength in a volatile economic and geopolitical environment. The Group's earnings return before taxes (EBT margin) was 39.3% in the first quarter (2021: 14.0%). Without the revaluation of the existing stake and consolidation effects arising from BBA’s full consolidation, the Group's return on sales achieved 18.4%.\n\nThe automotive segment showed a similarly strong performance in the first three months: The EBIT margin in the Automotive segment was 8.9% (2021: 9.8%) and thus at the upper end of the target range for 2022.

The BMW Group has acquired a stake in its partner Kinexon. The two companies have been working together for several years in order to advance the comprehensive digitalisation of the BMW Group production network. The premium carmaker announced on Tuesday that it has now acquired a minority stake in the innovative, Munich-based software company through its own venture capital company, BMW i Ventures.\n\nIn order to improve steering of highly complex processes in automotive manufacturing, the integrated IPS-i software platform was developed in collaboration with Kinexon. This platform can record a wide variety of position data (RFID, UWB, RTLS, GPS) and transfer it into its digital twin. On this virtual basis, the software recognizes, observes and automates a broad variety of manufacturing and logistics processes with utmost precision.\n\nThus, the innovative platform makes light work of keeping a digital overview of highly complex processes. In car manufacturing, some ten thousands of components have to be available at exactly the right place on the production line, right beside the tools that will be used – and all of them just in time. The new, state-of-the-art operating system orchestrates the second-by-second application accordingly.\n\nKinexon’s high-precision real-time locating systems are also designed for use in competitive sports and applied by numerous sport clubs of FiFA and NBA which record the movement data of athletes and their equipment through wearables. This allows the position data, tactics, movement patterns and performance of top sportspeople and entire teams to be analysed and targeted measures introduced to improve them.\n\n“Automotive production at the BMW Group is a lot like top-flight sport in that it’s about high-performance processes. The real-time locating platform IPS-i forms the backbone for fully digitalising our production. It’s an innovative operating system that makes our highly complex manufacturing processes transparent and raises efficiency in production even further. We are now intensifying our well-established, long-standing partnership with Kinexon by acquiring a stake in them,” said Milan Nedeljković, Board Member for Production at BMW AG. “Together, we want to set new standards in digital production steering.”\n\nThe IPS-i platform has been in use at the BMW Group since 2017 and operates in ten plants around the world. It forms the basis of numerous digitalisation projects, allowing the BMW Group – a pioneer in digital process optimisation and automation – to develop innovative production where efficiency and quality come first.\n\nThe IPS-i platform also allows logistics processes to be controlled and will be rolled out in further plants in the future. In 2021 its holistic location-based service architecture was nominated for the German Innovation Award.\n\nThe BMW Group and Kinexon GmbH have agreed not to disclose any acquisition details.\n\n+++ Transition to green power for aluminium electrolysis and wheel production +++ CO2 savings of up to 500,000 tonnes per year +++ Pioneering achievement: First MINI model with aluminium wheels made out of 70-percent secondary raw material from 2023 +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group is stepping up its activities in the field of sustainability and will use cast aluminium wheels produced with 100-percent green power for its BMW and MINI brands from 2024 onwards. For the BMW Group, this is another step towards its goal of creating the most sustainable supply chain in the automotive industry. The transition applies, in particular, to the energy-intensive electrolysis used in producing aluminium and to the wheel-casting process. To this end, corresponding agreements have been reached with all BMW Group wheel suppliers.\n\nUp until now, wheels have accounted for about five percent of supply chain CO2 emissions. Transitioning to more sustainable production that relies on green power will reduce these emissions by more than half. The BMW Group procures about 10 million light-alloy wheels per year; 95 percent of these are made from cast aluminium.\n\nCO2 savings of up to 500,000 tonnes per year\n\nThrough independent audits, the BMW Group can ensure conscious and sustainable use of aluminium by its contracted producers, saving up to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. “Green power is one of the biggest levers for reducing CO2 emissions in our supply chain. We have already signed more than 400 contracts with our suppliers, including suppliers of wheels and aluminium, requiring them to use green power,” says Joachim Post, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network.\n\nAluminium has good recycling properties, making it easier to melt down old wheels as part of the circular economy. This eliminates the need for energy-intensive electrolysis to produce the primary raw material. At the same time, the secondary raw material must also meet the BMW Group’s premium requirements for quality, design, safety and mechanical properties.\n\n+++ BMW Group sells total of 596,907 units in Q1 +++ US market up 3.7% with 80,590 BMW and MINI vehicles sold +++ First-quarter BEV sales climb 149 percent +++ Pieter Nota: “Our focus is on ramping up electromobility. We are fully on track to meet our ambitious growth targets for fully-electric vehicles in 2022” +++ Company sets course for future European sales model +++\n\nMunich. The BMW Group more than doubled sales of fully-electric BMW and MINI vehicles worldwide in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period last year (+149.2%). In the first three months of the year, the company sold a total of 596,907 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles. With its broad portfolio of drivetrains with state-of-the-art technology having a positive climate impact, the BMW Group was able to cater to the different mobility needs of its customers worldwide. Com­pared with the same period of last year, which was the strongest first quarter in the company’s history, sales showed a moderate decrease (-6.2%). After a strong start to the year, in a highly volatile environ­ment, the combined effects of the geopo­litical situation in Eastern Europe and the Covid lockdowns in China overshadowed business develop­ment as the quarter progressed. Nevertheless, the company absorbed these impacts well overall.\n\n“Our clear focus is on ramping up electromobility. In the first quarter, we stepped up the rapid pace of growth from 2021 even further and are fully on track to meet our ambitious growth targets for fully-electric vehicles in 2022,” said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales. “The demand for our emotional and innovative products with a wide range of drivetrains covering all customer needs, remains high worldwide. Thanks to this strong product line-up and our high level of flexibility and operational excellence, we expect sales for the full year 2022 to be on a par with last year, despite the challenging global environment,” Nota continued.\n\n+++ The BMW Group acquires a stake in Bcomp, a Swiss company that manufactures sustainable reinforcement solutions. Collaborative partnership in motorsport moves to the next level, joint R&D work for series vehicles gets underway +++\n\nMunich/Mountain View (California). The BMW Group is deepening its involvement in the field of sustainable, resource-efficient manufacturing of vehicle components made from natural materials. BMW i Ventures, the premium carmaker’s venture capital firm, is now investing in Swiss cleantech company Bcomp, the leading manufacturer of high-performance composites made from natural fibres. At the same time, the two companies are also strengthening their partnership on the motorsport side, with Bcomp now an official BMW M Motorsport partner with the new BMW M4 GT4 racing car. Plus, BMW Group Research and Bcomp are also setting up a development collaboration with the aim of using a higher proportion of renewable raw materials for components in future vehicle models.\n\nBcomp’s cutting-edge reinforcement solutions were first deployed by BMW M Motorsport in Formula E in 2019. The flax cooling shaft on the BMW iFE.20 made it the first BMW racing car with parts constructed from renewable plant fibres. Meanwhile, the Bcomp-developed powerRibs™ and ampliTex™ reinforcement solutions made from natural composite materials have been used in DTM touring cars from BMW M Motorsport to substitute selected carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components. Such advances underline BMW M Motorsport’s vital role as a technology lab for the BMW Group, which is now set to continue with the collaboration on the BMW M4 GT4. Taking the findings and experience gained on the track as a basis, these new material technologies will also find their way into BMW M models and BMW M Performance Parts. “Product sustainability is increasing in importance in the world of motorsport too,” says Franciscus van Meel, Chairman of the Board of Management at BMW M GmbH. “So we are delighted to have Bcomp on board as an official BMW M Motorsport partner for the BMW M4 GT4 project.”\n\n+++ Outlook: Bold technological transformation and business success will continue to go hand in hand in 2022 +++ E-mobility ramp-up: 15 BEV models in production +++ Electromobility: Neue Klasse will speed up market penetration – BEV share of 50 percent could be reached earlier +++ Neue Klasse brings technological advances in next-generation battery cells, automated driving, circularity and digitalisation +++ Lean, green, digital: Neue Klasse ushers in production of the future +++ Strong free cash flow for Automotive Segment in 2022 +++ Share repurchase authorisation proposed +++ Zipse: “2021 provides evidence of successful transformation” +++\n\nMunich.
