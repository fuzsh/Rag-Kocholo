        "text": "For their second instalment of ReCollect! at the Kunsthaus Zürich, Oslo based artists Matias Faldbakken and Ida Ekblad have hung one of their favourite works from the collection, Francis Picabia’s Cure-dents (Toothpicks, c. 1924), opposite four painted bronze sculptures by Ekblad. Faldbakken has then ‘measured’ the distance between Picabia and Ekblad using a VHS-copy of the 1983 splatter film1 Stage Fright. The second installation is on view in the Chipperfield building of the Kunsthaus.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nJohn Giorno's Dial-A-Poem and Wall Paintings are on view at Art Busan as part of the Connect program which allows space for curated exhibitions that are not part of a commercial gallery.

Loosie portrays a Black woman in a Harlem park, smoking a single cigarette (\"loosie\"), reflecting on bodegas' cultural significance in Black and Latino communities. Meanwhile, Patience depicts a Black woman blending into her domestic setting, exploring themes of home and gendered labor. Both artworks encapsulate Self's exploration of community pillars like bodegas and the psychological dimensions of domesticity, respectively, showcasing her distinctive style and thematic depth in capturing Black female experiences.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nIt's snowing, the sun is setting, a storm is brewing – Ugo Rondinone's expansive exhibition cry me a river at Kunstmuseum Luzern invites viewers to immerse themselves in both his art and the elements. At the heart of the artist's work is the overwhelming beauty of the landscape and the power of nature. Rondinone, who lives in New York, grew up in Brunnen on Lake Lucerne and is now returning to his home country to present a major retrospective.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nAround the Way features multi-material paintings and sculptures by Tschabalala Self, whose works will together form colourful spatial displays in EMMA’s concrete-dominated exhibition space. Self’s art often deals with the intersections of race and gender. The artist draws from her personal experiences as a Black American woman. She depicts bodies that are both exalted and objectified in Western imagery and art history. Through repetition, deconstruction and distortion of this imagery, she creates a new kind of narrative about the Black body.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nMuseum SAN presents BURN TO SHINE, a solo exhibition of works by Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone. With over forty works of sculpture, painting, installation, and film featured in the museum’s three main galleries, as well as the Nam June Paik Hall and the outdoor stone garden, BURN TO SHINE offers the most comprehensive presentation of the artist’s oeuvre in Korea to date. In contrast to the broad spectrum of medium and visual language that individual works employ, however, the exhibition, as a whole, gravitates toward themes that remain at the core of Rondinone’ s artistic practice spanning over three decades – the cycle of life, and relationship to nature that fundamentally define our human condition and experience.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nTo inaugurate the second chapter of their involvement in the ReCollect! series, co-curator Laura Vuille talks to Matias Faldbakken and Ida Ekblad about their individual practices, artistic intentions and experiences in working collaboratively. For ReCollect!, the two have been working together for the first time, creating joint installations where they interpret selected works from the Kunsthaus Collection through their own hands-on approach.\n\nBook here.\n\nTschabalala Self’s work has been selected for the 2026 Fourth Plinth commission. The Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square is one of the most important art commissions worldwide, putting new work by internationally renowned artists into the heart of London. Self’s sculpture, titled Lady in Blue, pays homage to a contemporary woman, who could be one of many Londoners walking through Trafalgar Square. Made of bronze, she will reference the square’s existing monuments, but will be patinated with Lapis Lazuli, a refined blue pigment in use since antiquity.\n\nFind out more about the Fourth Plinth Commission here.\n\nApropos Hodler - Current Perspectives on an Icon, a new exhibition at the Kunsthaus Zürich, offers a deep dive into the enduring legacy of Hodler's art, examining its contemporary relevance through four key themes: landscapes, corporeality, belonging, and enigma/transcendence. Among the artworks, Ugo Rondinone's mesmerizing glass horses, forged from fire into cast glass, represent the earth through the animal's physicality. They are named after the oceans and captivate viewers with their fusion of themes surrounding natural elements, exploration, and romance.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nThe Schirn Kunsthalle presents THE CULTURE, an exhibition commemorating the 50th anniversary of Hip Hop. Originating in the Bronx during the 1970s, Hip Hop emerged as a powerful platform for cultural expression and critique.

This clay-based work humorously explores human history through hand-modeled sculptures, accompanied by the film The Least Resistance (1981).

In the Auditorium, the experimental film The Way Things Go (1987) is screened.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nThe Spotlight series includes a new or never-before-exhibited artwork paired with a commissioned piece of writing, creating focused and thoughtful conversations between the visual arts and authors, critics, poets, scholars, and beyond.

In the Warehouse, sculptures are presented in unconventional ways, questioning notions of storage and memory. This comprehensive showcase, spanning from 1992 to the present, offers a rare opportunity to contemplate the artistic essence and sculptural language of one of the UK’s foremost artists.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nPhiladelphia Art Alliance at UArts is proud to present(re)FOCUS, including works by Karen Kilimnik and others. It is an important multi-generational group exhibit that features varied works that probe the human condition through singular images and handmade processes. No one style is represented here, but rather a panoply, with feminist and world political allusions, art historical references, wry appropriation, DIY bricolage, and craft sensibilities in a range of media.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nCC Strombeek presents the first institutional exhibition of Swiss artist Louisa Gagliardi. Her practice mainly revolves around alienation, and dislocation as essential features of our current, global existence. Gagliardi’s strongly pronounced, figurative paintings form not only technically, but also visually a complex game denoting delirium or delusion. For this show, the artist will conceive a new series of paintings and sculptures within a maze-like scenography. Deep Breaths builds upon her ongoing interest in the liminal space. In our highly technological and hyper connected world the borders between reality and fiction are becoming more and more blurry. We get tricked into thinking that our flesh self and virtual self might become one.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nWyatt Kahn presents a new solo exhibition titled Fantasmas at Museo Anahuacalli Mexico City from February 6 through May 19, 2024.

With more than thirty works in total and spanning thirteen years of Kahn’s career, the exhibition is his largest and most diverse to date, including works in bronze, lead, canvas, and stuffed animals and some of his first unprimed multi-panel works from 2011.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nEight large-scale wooden 'Light Rings‘ by Oscar Tuazon are on view at Wadi Hanifa in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as part of the city-wide light festival The Bright Side of the Desert Moon through December 16, 2023. Tuazon creates an immersive spatial intervention where the public is invited to walk around and through the work within the natural environment of Wadi Hanifa. Responding to the colonnade of palm trees on the site, Tuazon has positioned wood rings in the space between trees, which frame the artworks and create a series of illuminated portals along the stone pathway. Amidst the urban space of Riyadh, Light Rings takes ecology as its main source of inspiration, incorporating illumination, geometry, and harmony with its surroundings to form a vessel of time, light, and space.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nGalerie Eva Presenhuber and Pilar Corrias are pleased to present Bodega Run, a 235-page anthology inspired by Tschabalala Self's series reflecting New York City's bodegas. Published by Gregory R. Miller & Co. and edited by Sasha Bonét, it explores the cultural significance of these community-owned spaces. The anthology combines Self's vibrant visuals with nine newly commissioned texts by diverse authors that explore the complex consumer and merchant dynamics of New York's metropolitan culture and the bodega's potential as a radical site of resistance from racial, gender, and diasporic perspectives. To mark its release, the Swiss Institute in New York will host a book launch on January 11, 2024, displaying Self's new Bodega Run works. From January 11 to 13, 2024, the Swiss Institute will transform into a conceptualized bodega, showcasing Self's new artworks, including paintings, sculptures, and wall-mounted reliefs, accompanied by a neon sign installation.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nThe exhibition Candida Höfer: Epic Gaze is a curatorial selection chosen from the body of work developed by Candida Höfer over the last 20 years. It features a variety of pieces organised in six major themes: ‘Passages’, ‘Theatres’, ‘Museums’, ‘Libraries’, ‘Worldview’ and ‘Unseen Works’.

They have been inspired by Dulle Griet (also known as Mad Meg) by Pieter Bruegel, the portraits by Cornelis De Vos and Alessandro Allori, still-lifes by Antwerp masters like Daniël Seghers, works by Jacob Jordaens, Joachim Patinir and Gerard de Lairesse, etc. The applied arts so richly represented in the museum collection also receive a contemporary response. The exhibibition includes a painting by Tobias Pils.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nOne-on-One: Ugo Rondinone / Louis Eilshemius juxtaposes paintings by Louis Michel Eilshemius (1864–1941) alongside works Ugo Rondinone. Rondinone has long been collecting paintings by American poet and painter Eilshemius, who is known for his expressive and lyrical depictions of landscapes, nature, and nudes. The presentation will feature paintings by Eilshemius drawn from both the Phillips’s collection and Rondinone’s expansive personal collection of the artist’s work. In dialogue with Eilshemius, large-scale forest landscapes by Rondinone will be on view. Redolent of 17th-century Dutch woodcuts, the scenes are based on sketches by Rondinone made in 1989 during walks in the woods surrounding Vienna.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nUgo Rondinone presents work created specifically for Galerija Kula, featuring a lightning bolt as the motif, a bifurcated composition anchored in the gallery floor, entirely covered with sand. This creates an environment that includes visual, haptic, and auditory elements in the field of experience. The momentary appearance of a lightning bolt, typically observed in the distance, is brought closer to the visitor by means of a bronze body visually accentuated with yellow colour. Rondinone’s static lightning bolt, placed amidst friable material, actually becomes a mental polygon where, on one hand, creation and destruction unite in opposition, and on the other, it prompts and recalls various belief systems in which lightning appears as a symbol of divinity, from Greek mythology to Catholicism or Hinduism\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nThe exhibition Hoi Köln gathers a subjective overview of those who continue to paint under changed conditions. It is a cross-generational gathering. Some of those shown have been committed to painting for decades and experienced some surges in the medium. They also painted when it was infamous, and continue to paint today, when so many are doing so, without the need for legitimizing discourse. But this exhibition also includes many younger ones, raised in the digitalized world, who choose analog painting despite the technological possibilities. The show presents works by Peter Fischli David Weiss and Jean-Frédéric Schnyder. Peter Fischli will be in conversation with curator Valérie Knoll on Friday, October 20, 7-8 pm.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nSince 1797, the Chalcographie du Louvre has preserved and printed thousands of engravings with different generations of artists. Most recently, Jean-Marie Appriou was commissioned by the musée du Louvre, to produce an etching for the Chalcographie du Louvre collection. It is presented at the Centre Vivant Denon during Paris+ par Art Basel 2023 on October 19, 6 pm. At the Grand Palais Éphémère, the RMN booth will be exhibiting Appriou's etching as well as carefully selected works, curated by the artist himself. In September, an accompanying interview by Franck Gautherot with Jean-Marie was published in the magazine Grande Galerie, le journal du Louvre.\n\nFind out more about the project here.\n\nOrganised within the framework of the international celebrations marking the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) and curated by Eric Troncy, The Echo of Picasso relates Picasso’s oeuvre to that of contemporary artists who, in one way or another, have made or are making its echo resound. The exhibition includes work by Tobias Pils and Franz West.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nValentin Carron will be in conversation with Oliver Zybok on the occasion of his current solo exhibition Haus und Kropf at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Vienna. The talk takes place at the Skulpturinstitut of the University of Applied Arts in Vienna on Tuesday, October 10, 2023, at 6 pm, as part of the Artist Lecture Series Vienna and will be held in French, German, and English. Oliver Zybok is a German art historian and curator. He is deputy director and head of collections at the Kunstmuseum Bonn, Bonn, DE.\n\nFind more information about Artist Lecture Series Vienna here.\n\nThe solo exhibition Oh My God You Guys by Torbjørn Rødland highlights Rødland’s photographs in which two contradictory characters are featured. The artist often employs this type of “disruptive casting” to emphasize the oddness in the photographed scenes. The \"scenario\" created by the curator for this exhibition – titled Oh My God You Guys as agreed with the artist – takes the viewers on a journey from the dawn to the dusk of life, exploring sophisticated and troubled human relationships. The show is on view at Consortium Museum, Dijon, from October 27, 2023, through March 31, 2024.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nThe exhibition The Love of Art Comes First. Art & Project at the Kröller-Müller Museum highlights the significance and history of Art & Project based on more than a hundred works from the collection by artists such as Andrew Lord. Art & Project (Amsterdam 1968-1989, Slootdorp 1990-1998) was one of the pioneering galleries of contemporary art in the Netherlands and far beyond. Its founders Geert van Beijeren (1933-2005) and Adriaan van Ravesteijn (1938-2015) presented a programme featuring national and international artists, which was initially closely associated with the rise of conceptual art, but later broadened its focus with an emphasis on sculpture and painting.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nAt the anniversary exhibition of VFO at Kunsthalle Zürich, a daybed sculpture titled 'Business and Pleasure' by Louisa Gagliardi is on view. The Swiss artist said in an interview in March 2023 about these pieces exhibited at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Maag Areal: \"The sculptures evolve out of the tenor of the domestic environment you see in some of my paintings. […] I placed my daybed on a plexiglass pedestal to give it the status of a sculpture. Like the paintings, I wanted to maintain a certain distance between the object one sees and the viewer’s ability to interact with it. I did not want anyone to sit on them, but nevertheless tempted the viewer to consider that possibility. And so I made them a height that would invite that.\"\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nFrom September 2023, the SCHAUWERK shows a major solo exhibition by Doug Aitken. The sculptures and video installations include Migration from 2008 and his more recent work Wilderness. For the latter, which consists of several screens arranged in a circle, Aitken filmed the beach near his house in Los Angeles during the Covid-19 pandemic as people went about their everyday lives. Scored with a soundtrack generated by AI, the film is based on a rhythm of landscape shots alternating with images of people on the beach, showing a cycle from sunrise to nightfall.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nHorizons is a monumental aluminum sculpture started by Jean-Marie Appriou in 2022 and was first exhibited at Art Basel Unlimited 2023. Horizons is a a large-scale aluminum boat carrying two ‘austronauts.’ According to the artist, these two characters, their eyes fixed on the distance, are ‘exo-humans’ in search of an advanced humanity. 'Horizons' also echoes two historical paintings which he references in his work as a sculptor: 'La barque de Dante' by Eugène Delacroix (1822) and 'Die Toteninsel' by Arnold Böcklin (1880). The boat, and more broadly the theme of navigation, are central to Appriou’s work, imbued with the idea of passage and elevated consciousness.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nRecently, Tschabalala Self has developed an interest for sculpture, theatre and fashion. Central to the exhibition at Cultuurcentrum Strombeek is the work Sounding Board, an experimental video installation showing a recording of Self's first live performance that premiered in 2021 at the Performa Biennial in New York. The title of the exhibition, Feed Me, Kiss Me, Need Me, is taken from the accompanying script. Self is particularly interested in the dual nature of the private environment as an emotionally and socially charged locus. \"The house has two realities,\" she states. \"A desired reality — a place of comfort, inwardness and true self-expression.\" \"In reality, it is a place full of expectations, where people are required to assume roles.\"\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nThe 5th edition of the Chicago Architecture Biennial titled This is a Rehearsal with sculptures by Ugo Rondinone, Tschabalala Self and Jean-Marie Appriou is curated by the interdisciplinary arts collective Floating Museum and takes an expansive view of design as an iterative rehearsal process to explore architecture, cities, and the different social, ecological, economic and political forces that shape them.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nThis group exhibition highlights how the repertoire of circus forms continues to explore current social issues on both micro and macro levels, question political structures, expose stigmatization and illuminate the human-animal relationship. In his piece If There Were Anywhere But Desert. Saturday (2011), Ugo Rondinone skillfully captures the poignant essence of clowns, evoking a sense of melancholy that resonates with viewers. The suspended shoes embody the fragility and transience of human emotions, a theme that has permeated the circus throughout its long history, not only in its moments of joy and celebration, but also in its more sombre and melancholy aspects.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nThis major solo exhibition spans the past five years Adam Pendleton’s work, with a marked emphasis on abstract composition. Encompassing all of the museum’s special exhibition galleries, To Divide By includes new paintings, drawings and ceramics, as well as two recent film portraits. For Pendleton, abstraction is a means of representation, a logic, and a space for theoretical and visual experimentation. “By working in and through abstraction,” noted Meredith Malone, curator at the Kemper Art Museum, who organized To Divide By in collaboration with the artist, “Pendleton calls for a more capacious, chaotic and fluid space, one capable of producing radically new expectations and outcomes, not only for himself but also for the viewer.”\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nOscar Tuazon and curator Lynn Kost will give an artist talk during Castell Art Weekend at Hotel Castell in Zuoz. Lynn Kost said \"Oscar Tuazon, (*1975 in Seattle) creates platforms with his sculptures on which other things are supposed to happen besides the viewing of art. Based on his interest in do-it-yourself architecture, he creates objects that open up interior spaces to the public. These can be entered and are linked to art historical references and socially acute themes such as resource consumption or sustainability. Just as the artist does not complete the structures into functional architecture in order to create space for the audience's imagination, the content references are only offers for discussion, because the common exchange comes before everything else.“\n\nFind out more about the event here.\n\nFor the exhibition series ReCollect!, Matias Faldbakken and Ida Ekblad are working together for the first time, creating a joint installation where they interpret selected works from the Kunsthaus Collection, as seen through their own hands-on activity. Their gestures will open up new viewpoints on the holdings, with an emphasis on pulling women’s positions to the front.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nThe second presentation of “A Lover’s Discourse” features a new painting by New York–based artist Chase Hall exhibited alongside Jackson Pollock’s Untitled (1951). Hall’s new work Field Painting (2022–23) was completed as he researched examples of post-war abstraction in local private collections in Aspen. The direct juxtaposition of Field Painting with Pollock’s Untitled work on paper initiates a critical reading of the semiotics and cultural value attached to the drip-paint technique across histories of abstraction, improvisation, mark-making, and politics of labor.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nAs guest curator of Sculpture Milwaukee, Ugo Rondinone presents the group show Nature Doesn't Know About Us, which includes works by John Giorno and Oscar Tuazon among others: \"There is a world alongside ours—boundless, unhurried, interconnected, resourceful, lavishly inventive, and we are only temporarily in it. Nature Doesn’t Know About Us celebrates the disparate elements of the Earth, while exploring the human connection to nature. The exhibition brings together the works of eighteen artists who combine skeptical clarity and at times humor-tinged desire to locate the intersection of spiritual and physical presence in our daily life. The natural world serves as a doorway into a highly rarefied metaphysical realm where the sea of consciousness surges against the tangible world. A world where all is in flux as distinctions between self and soul, body and spirit, past and present, mortification and bliss, confinement and escape all blur and waver.\"\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nTogether with Bergen Kunsthall and Kunst Museum Winterthur, Kunsthalle Bielefeld presents a trio of exhibitions that approach Oscar Tuazon’s work in different ways. The three individual projects form an overarching unity and thus provide a multifaceted overview of Tuazon’s artistic oeuvre. The Kunsthalle will show a cross-section of Tuazon’s work from the last ten years to the present day and thematically address questions about artistic and social existential needs: What is absolutely necessary, indispensable and systemically relevant? What are our essential needs?\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nA brand-new project called “The Wing” occupies the first floor of the Consortium Museum. This space is usually reserved for temporary exhibitions of the collection. The Consortium Museum's directors have given this \"wing\" of the structure to two artists, Tobias Pils (b. 1971, Austria) and Joe Bradley (b. 1975, USA), who have strong ties to the art center and have previously exhibited there. The \"Paysage\" exhibition was the result of these two painters becoming curators. It pulls together pieces from their own collections by artists whose discreet careers have been characterized as \"folkart,\" \"outsider,\" and other vague terms. Hans Kruckenhauser, an Austrian painter who lived from 1940 until 2017, is the subject of Tobias Pils's current project. Joe Bradley has given prominence to the prosperous landscapes painted by Alyne Harris (1943, USA) from her rural home in Florida.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nThe third International Biennial of Saint-Paul de Vence has chosen to draw its inspiration from the universe and symbolism of birds. The title of the exhibition recalls that the poet Jacques Prévert was a resident of the village and a \"considerable\" passer-by. His words, \"Au hasard des oiseaux\", invite us to discover, feel and meet twenty works by twelve artists, among which Jean-Marie Appriou, who are messengers reminding us, more than ever, that it is profitable for man to live with the light and beauty of the flight of birds. The artist take over public spaces in the village of Saint-Paul de Vence, each developing, in their own way, a unique relationship with birds.\n\nSee more installation views here.\n\nOver the past ten years, Kahn has examined the spatial relationship between painting and sculpture to construct a visual vocabulary of representational and abstract forms that integrate formal concerns with materials from everyday life. His new works are playful narrative compositions with oversized figurative icons taken from domestic life. The deep, rusted red tone of the sculptures is a result of the natural weathering process of Cor-Ten steel, contrasting with the lush green foliage the LongHouse garden. The series was previously on view at City Hall Park, New York. In June 2023, two sculptures are shown at Art Basel Parcours 2023.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nCelebrating the Museum’s 125th anniversary, this landmark exhibition honors the East End’s rich artistic legacy and brings greater attention to major artists practicing here today. Forty-one artists have selected works from the collection to be shown along with their own. Rondinone's contribution, the alphabet of my mothers and fathers, is made of twenty-six panels arranged as a grid on all four walls of the gallery. Each panel holds a set of preindustrial farming and kitchen tools collected by the artist in the past three years from different farms and garage sales on Long Island.\n\nLearn more about the exhibition.\n\nFor his group of works Sunrise. East, Rondinone assigned a head with characteristic, highly reduced facial features to represent each calendar month. Larger than life and cast in shiny silver aluminium, the massive sculptural heads are reduced to their facial expressions: With mouths agape, they gaze from small eyes, from friendly and naïve to sceptical, from surprised to eerie. They trigger the most diverse associations, evoking ritual masks and ghosts, as well as the visual language of comics, emoticons, and memes. Visitors to the Städel Garden are invited to come face-to-face with all twelve creatures – and thus every month of the year – and experience the various joys, adversities, and emotions of an entire year in fast forward.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nA work by Joe Bradley is included in the group show A Leisurely Stroll - The Tenth Anniversary of The Long Museum at Long Museum, Shanghai. The theme of this exhibition is \"A Leisurely Stroll\", which points to two concepts that I want to talk about: one is \"time and history\", and the other is a \"way of seeing\". The show is curated by Wang Wei.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nThis year's Biennale Weiertal revolves around \"common ground\": it is about social and ecological justice, and how closely they are linked. This becomes clear with regard to the current global exploitation of people and nature, to the distribution of resources on the planet that is supposed to be our \"common ground\". With 17 artistic contributions, among which Sam Falls, the garden in the Weiertal becomes a place of reflection and perhaps even the nucleus of social utopias that are carried from here into the world.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nStorm King Art Center presents the sun and the moon, twin sculptures, which are both over sixteen feet tall, and are formed with delicate circles fashioned from cast-bronze tree branches, one silver-leafed and the other gilded. Installed parallel to one another, the sun and the moon are aligned along an east-west axis, like portals or apertures with views of Schunnemunk and Storm King Mountains.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nLiam Gillick’s intervention in the permanent collection of Berlin’s Museum of the Ancient Near East, titled Filtered Time, opened to the public in April 2023. Using light, color, shape, projection, sound, and almost no text, his intervention comes at a time when the Pergamon Museum, in which this collection is housed, is projected to close at the end of 2023. Gillick agreed to realize his project amidst difficult debates about how to deal with these buildings and the fraught colonial histories they house, about which he spoke to Jörg Heiser.\n\nRead the full conversation between Liam Gillick and Jörg Heiser here.\n\nWorks by Karen Kilimnik and Verne Dawson are included in Beautiful, Vivid, Self-contained, a group exhibition at the Hill Art Foundation curated by artist and writer David Salle. The exhibition brings together paintings and sculptures by artists working across different eras, mediums, and geographies to explore the nature of affinity between works of art. The show is on view in Chelsea from April 21 to July 21, 2023.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\n\"[...] These paintings are time. They take it and give it away. They move toward the viewer and away with him. They transform themselves in him for it is he who shifts them into a subjective shade of time and recreates them. And yet they continue to exist, indeed by simply existing they are the most basic form of dialogue. A dialogue that never demands affirmation nor negation, but decision - even if without compassion, for this picture in this moment, that is, in time!

This program is presented in conjunction with the forthcoming release of Aitken’s immersive monograph Mirage, co-published by JRP|Editions and ZOLO PRESS, in collaboration with LUMA for Elevation 1049. This publication will also be presented on June 10 at Galerie Eva Presenhuber at the openign of Aitken's new exhibition HOWL.\n\nClick here to RSVP.\n\nTitled after a line from Hesiod’s eighth-century BC epic poem Theogony (“Harmful Night, veiled in dusky fog, carries in her arms Sleep, Death’s own brother”), this new exhibition by Steven Shearer revolves around this uneasy proximity (“brotherhood”) between death and sleep, a recurring trope in Shearer’s art. Built around the George Economou Collection’s substantial holdings of Steven Shearer’s work in painting and printed matter, Sleep, Death’s Own Brother proposes an in-depth look at the oeuvre of this Vancouver-based artist from the transgressive thematic perspective of the lifeless body, which is sometimes truly, sometimes only seemingly dead.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nThe Bündner Kunstmuseum is dedicating Dieter Roth an exhibition that by means of representative work groups gives a rare overview of his copious printmaking. The exhibition curated by Dr. Dirk Dobke and Dr. Ina Jessen for the Deichtorhallen Hamburg will be presented in an adapted form and brings together material and print works from all creative periods in the most comprehensive Dieter-Roth-exhibition in a good 20 years.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nAfter their collaboration in burn to shine (2020), Ugo Rondinone and the French-Morrocan choreographer Fouad Boussouf join forces again in the world premier of VÏA. This new ballet piece with a decor by Rondinone takes the spectators on a trip across the rhythms of urban hip-hop, the splendor of Arabian folklore, and the extravaganza of Nouveau Cirque, ultimately leading dance back to its origin in the material soil. The presentation takes place at the Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève from April 19 to 23, 2023.\n\nFind out more about the project here.\n\nChase Hall was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera in New York to produce a large-scale artwork banner for its opera house on the occasion of the piece Champion (April 10 - May 13, 2023).

Dial-A-Poem was first presented at MoMA in the 1970 exhibition Information, organized by Kynaston McShine. Galvanized by social movements, including opposition to the Vietnam War, Giorno incorporated numerous works by radical poets and political activists. This exhibition features notes and documentation that illustrate how he originally arranged the poems, as well as phones containing 200 randomized poems selected by the artist in 2012 from his archive of thousands.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nIn the exhibition Valentin Carron & Jacques Chessex, the Tichy Ocean Foundation presents two of the most well-known French-speaking Swiss artists. Central to this exhibition is Valentin Carron’s larger-than-life sculpture Man and Child. It was conceived especially for the Tichy Ocean foundation exhibition and is placed, as per the artist’s wish, with more than fifty Chessex’s collages (1934-2009), meant as a sculptural haven of peace for the rather existential paper-works.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nHuman Is juxtaposes historical with newly produced artworks. The exhibition paints a polyphonic picture of the mutual penetration of body and technology: it addresses the often violent interdependence of humans on their technological surroundings and opposes any promises of salvation through trans-humanistic progress. Simultaneously, it opens up spaces of possibility in which dual-istic taxonomies can be overcome in favor of a networked and interdependent existence. With a contribution by Matthew Angelo Harrison.\n\nFind our more about the exhibition here.\n\nSince its emergence in the Bronx in the 1970s, hip hop has grown into a global phenomenon, driving innovations in music, fashion, technology, and visual and performing arts. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the birth of hip hop, The Culture: Hip Hop and Contemporary Art in the 21st Century captures the extraordinary influence hip hop has had on contemporary society through more than 90 works of art and fashion by some of today’s most important and celebrated artists, among them Adam Pendleton and Tschabalala Self.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition.\n\nThe exhibition Ein Ruheloses Universum by the artist duo Peter Fischli David Weiss shows the two works Surrli (1989) and the original Rat and Bear costumes (2004). The two animal figures appear in Peter Fischli David Weiss' work in various roles, for example as protagonists in the film The Least Resistance (1980-81) or as \"authors\" of the artist book Order and Cleanliness (1981) – two works which are also part of the exhibition at the Bechtler Stiftung.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nIn April 2023, Ugo Rondinone, curator of the exhibition when the sun goes down and the moon comes up, and the choreographer Fouad Boussouf work together on VÏA at the Grand Théâtre de Genève, a new piece for the Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève. In March, as an appetizer, Fouad Boussouf imagines for the Ballet a way to inhabit the exhibition. The result of two weeks of intense work in the “rhythmic spaces” imagined by Rondinone on the ground floor of the Museum of Art and History, Corps (im)mobiles invites us to discover the exhibition in a different way.\n\nFind out more about the project and purchase tickets here.\n\nThe exhibition ON STAGE explores the various theatrical and stage-related forms of expression in art since the 1960s, when a neo-avant-garde critical of tradition began focusing on performative and actionist art forms that endowed artists with a stage-like presence, often in front of an audience. The Viennese Actionism with its provocative and time-critical theatricality is just as much a part of this as the Vienna Group, whose literary cabaret stands firmly in the tradition of Dadaist theater, or the Fluxus-Movement with its media crossovers. The exhibition shows 150 works and work series, among them a painting by Tobias Pils, most of which are culled from the holdings of the mumok collection.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition.\n\nAs the signs that we need to rethink the polarity between nature and culture are multiplying, the exhibition “Nature Humaine – Humaine Nature” invites us to explore the complex relationship between humanity and nature. Although the fourteen artists seem to share the desire to foreground the urgent issues we face and to rethink our behaviours, they engage with different realms. Their works, including sculptures, drawings and videos, capture apparently bucolic elements or evoke the disastrous effects of humanity’s domination over the rest of the living world.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nHighlighting an interest in the history, technology, form and aesthetics, function or symbolism of flying objects, the exhibition centers around planes, airships, collections around the Balloonmania, wind tunnel models, collections of the Museum of Air and Space and archival images to pay tribute to the essential history of this building in aerostation and atraumatic.

The resulting exhibition consists of imaginatively calibrated vignettes of paintings and fashion, which celebrate glamour, beauty, fantasy, and the occult through the eyes of two singular yet overlapping perceptions. The title references the mid-century high society women who Truman Capote dubbed the “Swans”.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nIn a historical first, the Vorderasiatisches Museum and the Hamburger Bahnhof – Nationalgalerie der Gegenwart join forces on a trans-historical, site-specific presentation by British artist Liam Gillick throughout the halls of the Pergamonmuseum.

For most, the expansiveness and freedom of the American West is inextricably tied to the Stetsoned archetype. Forgoing the forefathers, Self’s Pioneer is a monument built in homage to the collective foremothers of contemporary America — the largely unidentified Native and African American women whose bodies and labour allowed for American expansionism and growth. It stands as a visual representation of their birthright and place within the American landscape.\n\nExplore the viewing room here.\n\nChase Hall interrogates the realities of race in America through innovative figurative painting techniques and iconography that engage the past and the present. Using coffee grounds as pigment on raw cotton canvases, Hall varies the levels of coarseness and fineness of the bean to achieve a range of tonal values, metaphorically articulating a non-monolithic Black experience and evoking his biracial hybridity. The artist’s first solo museum exhibition brings together new paintings and an impressive installation featuring a century-old, self-playing Wurlitzer organ ensconced in a brick room, evoking the museum’s historic structure — and the breath and memory of those who created it.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nGerwald Rockenschaub's exhibition reappropriation (allure/construct) is on view at Schlossmuseum Linz from March 31 to July 2, 2023. The artist is one of the most internationally renowned representatives of contemporary Austrian art. Since his artistic beginnings in the Neo Geo movement of the 1980s, he has developed a stringent oeuvre characterized by radical reduction and precision. His works reveal borrowings from constructivist-concrete traditions as well as an interest in the abstraction of form, which plays an essential role in the creation of pictograms and similar pictorial signs.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nmumok presents New York artist Adam Pendleton’s first comprehensive solo exhibition in Europe. Pendleton’s painting is a continuous index in which gestures are recorded, transposed, and overwritten. Since 2008 he has articulated much of his work through the idea of Black Dada, an ever-evolving inquiry into the relationship between Blackness, abstraction, and the avant-garde. In his paintings, drawings, and other works, a visual philosophy of incomplete postulates emerges, flattening the distinctions between legibility and abstraction, past and present, familiar and strange. Curated by Marianne Dobner.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nOn the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Pinakothek der Moderne, the Modern Art Collection presents itself anew on 3,600 square meters of exhibition space with around 350 works by more than 150 artists.

The exhibition presents two installative settings featuring Kilimnik's works Swan Lake (1992) and Kitri and friends at the garden folly (2004). Flanking these are paintings from different years that depict a “forest clearing as stage” theme but which also engage intrinsically with presence and absence. With these and other works, the exhibition highlights Kilimnik’s artistic ability to continually renegotiate the conditions of established narratives within and beyond her time.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nTschabalala Self's solo exhibition Inside Out at Kunstmuseum St.Gallen is on view from February 25 to June 18, 2023. The artist is deeply engaged with the medium of painting. She paints with various pigments, materials, textiles and threads. Her unique technique includes found, acquired, and hand-­dyed fabrics. With these she creates figures that depict avatars rather than individuals. The artist draws from her personal experiences as a Black American woman. In this context she stages bodies that are often exalted and excluded within her imagined environments.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nKunstmuseum Winterthur is presenting a retrospective of the American artist Oscar Tuazon, covering the years from 2000 to the present. For the exhibition in Winterthur, the artist is realizing an expansive wooden structure that is a sculpture, model house, meeting place and event forum all in one. By going beyond the limits of the room, it creates a new, incomparably more informal space for encounter and art.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nBergen Kunsthall presents a large-scale exhi­bition with new works by the American artist Oscar Tuazon.

His multimedia work possesses a distinct style defined by the principle of distillation to a few but essential elements, structures, and color contrasts.\n\nLearn more on Belvedere 21\n\nJean-Frédéric Schnyder's solo exhibition, officially on view until February 5, 2023 at Vienna Secession, shows a cross-section of the artist's painting from almost forty years (1983–2021). In his typical manner, the 102 paintings of various formats (all: oil on canvas) are hung evenly spaced and, increasing in size from front to back and then decreasing again, form a horizontal line. The ever-changing live image of the outdoor space, which the glass door on the front wall reveals, is part of the concept.\n\nLearn more on Secession, Vienna\n\nIn the newest video with Public Art Fund, artist Wyatt Kahn and curator Daniel S. Palmer discuss Kahn’s first public art exhibition, Life in the Abstract. Together, they delve into the inspiration drawn from Kahn’s daily life, connections to his broader practice, and how the sculptures reflect the democratizing spirit of public art. On Wednesday, December 7, there will be an Artist Talk with Wyatt Kahn, where he will address his multidimensional practice encompassing painting, drawing, and sculpture, focusing on Life in the Abstract.\n\nWatch on Public Art Fund\n\nThe strong, vivid hues shining in this collection appear as the shades of the rainbow.
