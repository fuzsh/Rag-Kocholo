        "text": "\"This was the most efficient solution for the project,â says the contractorâs engineer, and adds âWhereas beam formwork would have been used in other similar cases, NOEtop frame formwork with integrated bracing resulted in more flexibility of use and cost savings. Not the least important factor in making the complete project a success was the good advice from NOE-Schaltechnik, SÃ¼ssen.â\n\n\"The NOEtop frame formworkâs integrated bracing was a great advantage. This made inclining the front face formwork at such a steep angle no problem. Furthermore, the large amount of reinforcement did not always allow the tie rods to be placed in the specified positions; they often had to be displaced slightly. Again, the integrated bracing allowed us to do this without any extra work,â explains Mr Nill, Managing Director of BSN"
