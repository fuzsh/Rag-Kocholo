Aside from curated collection presentations at our artspace and loans to institutions, we regularly group selected  artworks from our collection under a theme or formal aspects digitally.\n\nThe painting “NO MATTER WHAT I DO” (2022) by JENNY BROSINSKI is part of the first edition of this digital curation series: “A touch of body”, A digital selection of artworks from the collection featuring female artists working in abstraction. \n\nThe great freedom that Jenny Brosinski (b. 1984, German) gives her painterly elements are unmistakable. Colors and lines breathe here, show themselves as an open work and conceal nothing. Between color, dynamics of strokes, large letters, scribbles, folds, lines and footprints – these statements are just not as clear as language and also not as analytical like drawings. Jenny Brosinski’s abstract, minimalist painting is surprising concrete in their reference to themselves. Their aesthetics do not allow any lies, nor tricks, every line and every trace are visible and become a clear assertion. (Text: Larissa Kikol)\n\nOther artists in the selection “A touch of body” are Daisy Parris, Sylvia Ong, Xiyao Wang, Aneta Kajzer, Nadia Hernández, Isa Genzken, Soziale Fassade, Mirdidingkingathi Juwarnda Sally Gabori, soko (Sol Kordich), Ms N Marawili & Maria Taniguchi\n\nImage Caption: Jenny Brosinski, “NO MATTER WHAT I DO”, Oil, charcoal, spraypaint on canvas, 2022, 202 x 162 cm, courtesy the artist, Wentrup Gallery (@wentrup_gallery ) and Arndt Collection (@arndt_collection ) \n\n#arndtcollection #artcollection #digitalcuration @arndt_collection #theartbarn #collectionofourwishes #daisyparris @daisyparris #sylviaong @sylviaong.studio @xiyaowangart #xiyaowang @anetakajzer #anetakajzer @nadiahernandezofficial #nadiahernandez @isa.genzken #isagenzken #mirdidingkingathijuwarndasallygabori @jenny_brosinski #jennybrosinski @soko__________ #solkordich #mrsnmarawili @maria_taniguchi #mariataniguchi\".",
