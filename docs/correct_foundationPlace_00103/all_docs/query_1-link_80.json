        "text": "2013\n\nWithin the Frame of Abstract Images\n\nof the German Postwar Period\n\nWhen today, in a world that is becoming small-scale, ‘art’ and the commercial handling of it are fueling the public’s awareness of art, and when art biennales and fairs are springing up around the world, and when in particular the painting of the twentieth century is highly prized, then a look back is worthwhile. Back to a generation of painters in a clearly delimited living environment, to a time when Germany, rising from the rubble after World War II, was striving to once again set upright the humanistic view of humankind, which had been knocked from its pedestal by the crimes of National Socialism.\n\nAnd as chance would have it, a Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper page from 1955 now comes to light (rolled up as window insulation in a house built in 1955) with a review by the then British Vice-Consul and art critic John Anthony Thwaites: “German Abstract in Paris—An Exhibition of 35 Painters and Sculptors.” To everybody's amazement: German painters are on the path to abstraction. In Paris, the German painters show that they are positioned for postwar modernism, apparently also as its trailblazer in Germany. Afterward, the exhibition from Paris was presented in the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart and subsequently also shown in Düsseldorf.\n\nGerman Abstract - Informel\n\nWe have taken the exhibition of the German abstract painters in Paris in 1955 with the review of the British art critic John Anthony Thwaites (newspaper page in the exhibition) as the occasion for using images by the German painters of that notable exhibition in Paris as a ‘framework’ in our exhibition in 2013:\n\nGegenklänge · when sound interferes with the visual.\n\nAs a frame with a view of humankind inscribed in it, it sustained art in the years of transition after World War II, as the great art historian and contemporary witness Werner Haftmann (Der Mensch und seine Bilder, 1980) never tired of underscoring in essays and talks. This does not mean that only the abstract was being painted, but that abstract painting was emerging with a new awareness of the self / time.\n\nWhen one reads the art-historical texts of that time today, the talks and essays of E.H. Gombrich, The Story of Art, 1950; Willi Baumeister, Das Unbekannte in der Kunst, 1947; Werner Haftmann, Malerei im 20. Jahrhundert, it is not only the images but also how they are perceived that make an impression. What was of interest was not characterizing styles and trends (as e.g. Clement Greenberg attempted to characterize ‘Abstract Expressionism’ in the United States conceptually after 1945 as a national status, while it is today favored in the art trade), but instead addressing the individual stance and artistic language of forms.\n\nWhile in Paris, the postwar art metropolis in Europe, the new abstract art was seen as an existential force, in Germany it was nearly impossible for it to be mediated it in a neutral way. The confrontation between abstraction and figuration was extremely controversial: “abstraction is modernity, figuration National Socialist Breker-(Hitler) naturalism” (Willi Müller Hufschmid). In transcending an ideological reception of art, the establishment of the documenta in Germany in 1955 cannot be rated highly enough: in 1955, documenta I concluded the process of stocktaking and redress with an overview of the classical modern era of European painting. documenta II in 1959 was already dedicated to positions in art after 1945 and not only in Europe."
