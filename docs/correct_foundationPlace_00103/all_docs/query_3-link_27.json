In this regard, individual data components are brought together, in particular, in order to obtain new findings.\n\nMachine learning is a sub-area of AI. The focus is on the development of algorithms that imitate the learning behaviour of the human brain for machines.

Depending on the purpose of an AI application, the reliability can and may vary. The reliability of an application depends on various factors, for example the (Training) data that is used, the technology that is used etc. The algorithms that are used may also influence the reliability of the result.\n\nRead more:\n\nSee Question 10: How much data and what data is required to use an AI application?\n\nThe published cases in which an AI application has been unsuccessful are generally from the consumer sector. One example of unsuccessful use of a chatbot application is the e-assistant. After a user asked it to “call me an ambulance”, the chatbot referred to him as “an ambulance” from then on. Other well-known examples is that of Google image recognition, which incorrectly recognised people with dark skin as gorillas or the fatal accident caused by a Tesla Autopilot.\n\nRead more:\n\nUniversity of Louisville/Microsoft Corporation: Collection and timeline of unsuccessful application scenarios\n\nOver the course of the industrial revolution, workplaces changed significantly in the field of manufacturing. In recent years, a significant trend towards assisted workplaces has emerged, in which information is displayed in a context-sensitive and digital format. Physical assistance takes place using robots or exoskeletons, in particular in the field of monotonous or highly repetitive activities. In addition, there is an increasing level of individualisation of workplaces that had previously been homogenous. Much like the change from cubicles with dividing walls in large open-plan offices to individualised office rooms that are adapted to the needs of individual employees, a similar trend can be identified in areas that are closely related to manufacturing. Only part of the activities (e.g. simple data analyses, predictable physical activities) can be supported or carried out by AI assistants. AI systems must be understood as assistance systems for humans, not as systems that entirely substitute work being carried out by humans.\n\nRead more:\n\nVDMA: Artificial intelligence position paper\n\nOpen communication about upcoming changes at an early-stage is crucial for acceptance. In this regard, it is important to prepare the information for different interest groups within the company in terms of content, language and level of detail. In addition, explicit and implicit concerns need to be addressed openly. Communication must be honest and between equals. Involving employees in the new technologies (e.g. robots, digital assistance) can help to deal with rejection and spark interest. In addition, it is advisable to introduce AI applications to support work processes in a pilot area and to support other work steps (where possible) at a later point in time. If possible, participation in the project can take place at various levels. This contributes to encouraging the employees to identify with the solution. Visits to a laboratory with practical application scenarios helps to make AI more tangible, explain results from AI applications in a better manner and use examples to have an open discussion about the advantages and disadvantages.\n\nRead more:\n\nCentre for Cyber Cognitive Intelligence CCI\n\nInnovation laboratory Future Work Lab\n\nThere’s no change without employees! With regard to AI, it is important to help employees deal with their concerns and get them involved. For companies, this means: providing information, enabling dialogue and encouraging people to talk about and deal with their concerns. Further training opportunities at an early stage make a positive contribution to creating an optimistic environment for employees and getting them involved in the change. In order to do so, the employee must have an understanding of the future requirements for employees (e.g. skills, qualifications).\n\nManagers should deal with employees whose workplace will change in a focused manner. In doing so, satisfactory answers to any questions should be found and alternatives offered.\n\nIn the context of AI, the media often presents an exaggerated image with lots of negative impressions and suggestions of omnipotence, which creates a pessimistic view. Ethical use of AI is often deliberately played down. Pioneer companies have already created their own ethical guidelines for researching and developing AI in this regard. The final version of the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be published in April 2019. The Bundestag has also set up a Commission of Enquiry [Enquete-Kommission] in order to assess social responsibility, as well as the economic, social and environmental potential of AI.\n\nRead more:\n\nEuropean Union: Preliminary version of the Ethics Guidelines\n\nData Mining refers to the use of algorithms for the analysis and processing of large, complex and heterogenous data sets (“big data”) to generate new information.
