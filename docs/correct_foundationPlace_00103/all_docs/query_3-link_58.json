        "text": "Time Horizon, one of Antony Gormley's most spectacular large-scale installations, will be shown at Houghton Hall in Norfolk from 21 April – 31 October 2024, the first time the work will be staged in the UK.\n\nFeaturing 100 life-size sculptures, the works are distributed across 300 acres of the park, the furthest away being approximately 1.5 miles on the West Avenue. The cast-iron sculptures, each weighing 620kg and standing at an average of 191cm, are installed at the same datum level to create a single horizontal plane across the landscape. Some works are buried, allowing only a part of the head to be visible, while others are buried to the chest or knees according to the topography. Only occasionally do they stand on the existing surface. Around a quarter of the works are placed on concrete columns that vary from a few centimetres high to rising four meters off the ground.\n\nAntony Gormley is one of the most important artists of his generation and is widely acclaimed for his sculptures, installations and public artworks that investigate the relationship of the human body to space. His work has been exhibited throughout the UK and internationally.\n\nAntony Gormley said: 'My ambition for this show is that people should roam far and wide. Art has recently privileged the object rather than the experience that objects can initiate. Time Horizon is not a picture, it is a field and you are in it. The work puts the experience of the subject/visitor/protagonist on an equal footing with all material presences, organic and inorganic. The quality of the light, the time of the year, the state of the weather and the condition of your mind, body and soul are all implicated in the field, as is all the evidence within it of human activity already accomplished as well as the plethora of life forms that surround the hall.'\n\nLord Cholmondeley, owner of Houghton Hall, said: 'It has been an extraordinary experience witnessing the installation of 100 life-size sculptures in the historic landscape surrounding the house. It is a great privilege to have the opportunity to show this large-scale work by Antony Gormley for the first time in the UK. We hope visitors will enjoy exploring Houghton and the interesting dynamic between Time Horizon and our exhibition of Magdalene Odundo's ceramic and glass work, which will open in May.'\n\nHoughton Hall was built by Sir Robert Walpole, Great Britain's first Prime Minister, in around 1722. Designed by prominent Georgian architects Colen Campbell and James Gibbs, it is one of the country's finest examples of Palladian architecture. Houghton and its estate passed to the Cholmondeley family at the end of the 18th Century and remains a family home. The house and award-winning gardens have been open to the public since 1976.\n\nThe Houghton Arts Foundation continues to build a collection of contemporary art at Houghton including a number of site-specific commissions. With links to colleges and public institutions across the region, the Foundation's aim is for Houghton to become a focus for those who wish to see great art of our time in a historic setting. The 2024 exhibitions by Antony Gormley and Magdalene Odundo follow those by James Turrell (2015), Richard Long (2017), Damien Hirst (2018), Henry Moore (2019), Anish Kapoor (2020), Tony Cragg (2021), Chris Levine (2021) and Sean Scully (2023).\n\nTime Horizon, supported by Thaddaeus Ropac and White Cube\n\nPress Enquiries:\n\nFor Antony Gormley\n\nErica Bolton, Bolton & Quinn\n\ndennis@boltonquinn.com\n\n020 7221 5000\n\nFor Houghton Hall\n\nTracy Carroll\n\nMarketing and Events\n\ntracy@houghtonhall.com\n\n01485 528569\n\nNotes to Editors:\n\nAntony Gormley Biography"
