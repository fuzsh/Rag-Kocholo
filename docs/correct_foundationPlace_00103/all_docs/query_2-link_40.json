The present report relates to the activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from May 1957 to May 1958. During this period the work of the Office has continued in accordance with the provisions of its Statute to be carried out on a humanitarian and a social basis.\n\n2. It is the general policy of the High Commissioner in dealing with refugee problems to ensure international protection for refugees within the mandate of his office and to promote permanent solutions for non-settled refugees, giving them the choice between voluntary repatriation, resettlement in other countries whenever possible, or integration in their countries of residence.\n\n3. In the case of a new refugee problem, it is the policy of UNHCR to seek means of achieving a complete solution for the problem as soon as it arises, so that there does not remain in the country of first asylum a residual group of persons who cannot be settled. This policy was applied in the case of Hungarian refugees when the international community was made aware that countries of first asylum should not be left with the burden of large numbers of refugees difficult to resettle. Its implementation has been successful in Yugoslavia where, as a result of co-operation between Governments, the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration, the United States Escapee Program, voluntary agencies and UNHCR, the Hungarian refugee problem was completely solved by January 1958. Of the total influx of 19,857 Hungarian refugees into that country, 2,773 were voluntarily repatriated, 16,409 resettled and 675 integrated.\n\n4. The situation in Austria is less satisfactory. Of the total influx of over 180,000 Hungarian refugees into Austria, an estimated 7,800 have been repatriated and 154,300 resettled, while there still remain 18,200, of whom 7,600 are in camps. Here, an additional effort is required to resettle the 9,000 Hungarian refugees who have expressed the desire to emigrate.\n\n5. A permanent solutions programme in an amount of $3,500,000 has been put into effect for non-settled Hungarian refugees who wish to stay in Austria. This programme includes assistance for integration through the provision of housing and small loans, an educational programme, and aid to special groups, such as intellectuals.\n\n6. The High Commissioner still has a function of protection to exercise in respect of these refugees, whether they have been resettled in Europe or overseas or integrated in their country of first asylum. He will continue to facilitate the return of any refugees who freely express the desire to be repatriated.\n\n7. Partly as a result of the resettlement of Hungarian refugees, of the naturalization of other refugees and of the influx of new refugees, there has been a gradual change in the composition of the refugee population within the mandate of the High Commissioner's Office in various areas. In countries of resettlement, which admitted in the course of 1957 some 80,900 Hungarian refugees in addition to some 35,000 other refugees, the Hungarians constitute an important new element.\n\n8. On the other hand, the number of those whose refugee status is of longer standing has decreased through naturalization during this period by approximately 30,000 in Europe alone. New problems have arisen, however, as a result of the influx of new refugees who entered Western European countries at an estimated monthly rate of 1,700 during 1957.\n\n9. As a result of experience gained in the Hungarian operation, Governments are showing a tendency to apply more liberal immigration criteria to certain handicapped groups of earlier refugees. In addition to certain European countries, Australia and New Zealand have agreed in principle to accept a number of families with one or more physically-handicapped members. These Governments also give favourable consideration to the admission of difficult cases when this enables them to join their families which have already been admitted. The Government of the United States included a provision in favour of tubercular cases in its Immigration and Nationality Act of 11 September 1957.\n\n10. In view of these development, it may become necessary for the High Commissioner to increase his activities in area where numbers of refugees have been resettled and where closer relations with the governmental authorities may facilitate their assimilation.\n\n11. As regards international protection, further efforts have been made to improve the general situation as well as the legal status of refugees in various countries. Largely owing to the close co-operation which has developed between UNHCR Branch offices and the governmental authorities, new legal provisions have been adopted for the benefit of refugees, and measures have continued to be taken for the implementation of important articles of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, in particular those concerning the right of employment and social benefits.\n\n12. A preliminary report on the Survey of the non-settled refugee population in Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Turkey was submitted to the General Assembly as an addendum to the last report of the High Commissioner. Full details of the Survey findings have now become available and show that in mid-summer 1957, when the Survey was carried out, there were approximately 178,000 non-settled refugees in the countries mentioned above. Of these, some 58,000 refugees are living in camps and some 120,000 outside camps. Information made available by this Survey will greatly facilitate future planning of the refugee programme.\n\n13. In view of the limited resources at his disposal, the High Commissioner has adopted the practice of analysing and delimiting clearly certain refugee problems on which his main efforts can be concentrated.\n\n14. This is also true of the UNREF programme, now in its fourth and final year of implementation. During the current reporting period, the efforts of UNHCR have been concentrated on the solution of the problems of refugees in camps, and the 1958 programme is therefore mainly focused on the countries with the largest camp population.\n\n15. While permanent solutions are being achieved mainly through integration project, resettlement remains an important solution, and one of the most satisfactory for certain categories, including in particular those refugees who have not spent many years in camps.\n\n16. By 31 March 1958, a total of 34,903 refugees have been assisted under the UNREF programme, of whom 22,039 had been firmly settled. On the assumption that all camp clearance projects can be implemented within the UNREF Revised Plan of Operations (1958), it is estimated that there may remain at the end of this year some 11,600 refugees in camps who will not have benefited from the UNREF programme and who will not be eligible for assistance under other international programmes. To implement solutions for these refugees in the course of 1959 and 1960 as part of the intensification of the UNREF programme, a camp clearance programme in an amount of $4,800,000 complementary to national programmes has been submitted to the UNREF Executive Committee in accordance with paragraph 1 (a) of resolution 1166 (XII) of 26 November 1957. Decisions taken by the Committee on this programme will be found in the report on its eighth session (see Annex III).\n\n17. As a result of the appeal addressed by the High Commissioner to members of the United Nations and members of the specialized agencies under paragraph 1 (b) of resolution 1166 (XII), an amount of $3,478,100 had, by 15 May 1958, bee n paid, pledged or promised towards the total sum of about $10,200,000 required for the 1958 UNREF programme and its intensification for camps clearance. A further amount of $6,721,900 is therefore still needed, as compared with about $7,500,000 at the beginning of 1958.\n\n18. A special problem has arisen as a result of an acute shortage in the funds available to ICEM for the transportation of refugees of European origin from the Far East, and in the funds available to UNHCR for their care and maintenance in transit in Hong Kong. Through the generosity of several interested Governments and voluntary agencies a complete interruption of the operation was avoided, but, as at the beginning of June 1958, the crisis continues. Information on action taken by the UNREF Executive Committee on proposals for the solution of this problem may be found in the report of the eighth session of the Committee.\n\n19. As far as the long/range aspects of the problem are concerned, there are still 10,300 refugees of European origin on the mainland of China, 5,300 of whom have been assured of resettlement visas. These 10,300 could all be moved if transportation funds totalling approximately $5,500,000 were available to the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration.\n\n20. It will be recalled that, pursuant to resolution 650 B (XXIV) of the Economic and Social Council, adopted on 24 July 1957, the General Assembly at its twelfth session decided, in view of the continuing need for international action on behalf of refugees, to prolong the Office for a period of five years from 1 January 1959. At the same time the General Assembly adopted resolution 1166 (XII) on international assistance to refugees. The effect of this resolution is that the programme of the United Nations Refugee Fund should be intensified to the fullest extent possible in order to achieve permanent solutions for the maximum number of refugees remaining in camps, without losing sight of the need to continue to seek solutions for the problem of refugees outside camps; that the UNREF programme as such should come to an end on 31 December 1958; that from 1 January 1959 UNHCR should carry out such programmes as might be authorized by the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's programme ; and that the UNREF Executive Committee should exercise in 1958 such functions incumbent upon the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's programme as it deemed necessary, with a view to assuring the continuation of international assistance to refugees.\n\nCHAPTER I THE PROBLEM OF HUNGARIAN REFUGEES\n\nGeneral remarks\n\n21. The last report to the General Assembly summed up the position of the Hungarian refugee problem on 1 May 1957. An analysis of the progress made in the twelve months between that date and 1 May 1958 is given in this chapter.\n\n22. The total number of Hungarian refugees who have entered Austria and Yugoslavia is approximately 200,000. All Hungarian refugees who entered Yugoslavia have now found solutions to their problems by voluntary repatriation, by local integration in Yugoslavia or by resettlement in other countries. In Austria, on the other hand, there still remain some 18,200 refugees, of whom 7,600 are in camps. It is estimated that some 9,000 refugees wish to emigrate. The remainder of the group are expected to become locally integrated in Austria, either through their own efforts or with the assistance of special programmes, including a permanent solutions programme designed by UNHCR.\n\n23. The resettlement of more than 170,000 Hungarian refugees in over thirty countries in all parts of the world has considerably increased the task of international protection of the High Commissioner's Office.\n\n24. According to information available to the Office, the total number of refugees repatriated to Hungary from countries of both first and second asylum had reached about 15,800 by 1 May 1958, some 6,300 having been repatriated during the period under review. Some Governments of countries of asylum expressed a willingness to defray the travel costs of refugees returning to Hungary. Where difficulties arose, the High Commissioner intervened through diplomatic channels.\n\n25. Legal problems have arisen out of the necessity of ensuring that Hungarian refugees are given the rights to which they are entitled under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. In general, the Governments of countries of asylum have been outstandingly generous in the treatment they have accorded to Hungarian refugees. Many of this group have also been granted asylum by countries not parties to the Convention.\n\n26. A legal procedure was established as soon as possible in both Austria and Yugoslavia for deciding on the future of unaccompanied children. In the early days of the Hungarian refugee problem, however, a number of minors were include in mass transportation movements and have thus become spread over many countries. The Office of the High Commissioner has intervened with the Governments concerned in order to emphasize the importance of deciding on the future of these children in accordance with the principles of family unity and the best interest of the individual child.\n\n27. Upon arriving in a country of second asylum a refugee faces the necessity of adapting himself to what is often a very different society, of learning a new language and even of adjusting himself to different climatic conditions. In a number of cases, Hungarian refugees have found themselves unable to fit into their new environment, and have requested further resettlement to another country. The Office of the High Commissioner has helped a number of Governments to find new opportunities elsewhere for these refugees. In other cases, families have become separated during resettlement, and steps have been necessary to bring about family reunion. This complex operation has not yet been completed. Nevertheless, the great majority of Hungarian refugees who have left Austria and Yugoslavia have become integrated in their present countries of residence.\n\nA. Hungarian refugees in Austria\n\nOVER-ALL MOVEMENT OF REFUGEES\n\n28. It is estimated that a total of approximately 180,000 Hungarian refugees have entered Austria. On 1 May 1957, there were an estimated 35,300 refugees remaining in that country: by 1 May 1958, this figure had been reduced to about 18,200, including 7,600 refugees in camps. The reduction during this period was therefore small in comparison with the achievements during the early months of the Hungarian refugee problem. The intensive efforts of the early period were not sustained long enough to solve the whole problem immediately.\n\n29. Voluntary repatriation of refugees to Hungary continued without major difficulties during the period under review. By 1 May 1958, the total number of refugees repatriated to Hungary directly from Austria had reached approximately 7,700, of whom 3,300 left during the period under review.\n\nRESETTLEMENT\n\n30. By 1 May 1958, the number of refugees resettled from Austria had reached about 154,400. The relatively slow reduction in the numbers of refugees remaining in Austria between May 1957 and May 1958 can be attributed almost entirely to difficulties in the way of resettlement. After allowing for the possibilities of local integration in Austria, the number still desiring emigration may be estimated at some 9,000. It is to be hoped that a number of Governments which have already taken substantial numbers of Hungarian refugees will agree to make a relatively small further effort and accept an additional quota.\n\nPROVISION OF CARE AND MAINTENANCE\n\n31. The responsibility for providing care and maintenance falls on the Austrian Government. The previous report described the manner in which the League of Red Cross Societies undertook to provide part of the care and maintenance needs of refugees in specific camps from 15 December 1956 to 30 June 1957. From 1 July to 30 September 1957, this operation was continued by the Austrian Red Cross Society although the League still gave assistance. On 1 October 1957, the Government of Austria took back full responsibility for care and maintenance. The League of Red Cross Societies reports that up to 31 October 1957 Red Cross Societies had contributed over $3,000,000 in cash and $9,400,000 in kind for the operation in Austria. Besides the Austrian Red Cross Society, fourteen other national societies participated in the work in Austria. The value of national society personnel services to the League is estimated at $700,000.\n\n32. In the last report details were given of financial assistance provided to the Austrian Government through the Office of UNHCR. As a result of this help, of the operation undertaken by the Red Cross Societies and of bilateral contributions made directly to the Austrian Government, including surplus foods up to a value of $10,000,000 contributed by the United States Government, the financial aspect of the Hungarian refugee problem in Austria can be considered satisfactorily solved.\n\nPERMANENT SOLUTIONS PROGRAMME\n\n33. The last report referred to long-term projects approved by the UNREF Executive Committee at its fourth session and designed in particular to provide counselling, casework and scholarships for Hungarian refugees. At its fifth session, the UNREF Executive Committee authorized the Office of UNHCR to implement a permanent solutions programme for Hungarian refugees in Austria costing $3,500,000.\n\n34. Implementation of this programme is now proceeding. The outline of the programme by type of projects is given below, together with the financial status of projects on 1 May 1958.\n\na Project completed on 15 January 1958.\n\n35. The projects for housing and small loans, which together account for more than 70 per cent of the total value of the programme, represent a major effort to assist the economic integration of Hungarian refugees in Austria. Work on housing projects has already started, and every advantage will be taken of the 1958 building season. It is planned to provide about 860 dwelling units, which will take the forms of semi-detached houses, small semi-detached bungalows or apartments. At the same time, the small loans project is helping refugees to buy tools or capital equipment and thus enabling them to find employment or to open up small businesses. A considerable effort is also being made to provide a suitable educational programme (elementary schools, youth projects, aid to university students). The Hungarian refugee group includes a high proportion of young persons, and it has been necessary to provide school facilities outside the camps for these minors. Particular mention may be made of four secondary schools in which, as at 31 March 1958, 839 young refugees were being given suitable education, and also of a large vocational training institute set up by the Austrian Government and accommodating at the same date 140 boys. University scholarships have been given to 254 refugees to enable them to enter Austrian universities. It should be emphasized that the participation of UNHCR in the over-all educational programme for Hungarian refugees in Austria is relatively small. The Austrian Government and an impressive number of voluntary agencies and private foundations are contributing large sums of money to meet the educational needs of the younger refugees. Finally, there are projects for aid to special groups of refugees, such as intellectuals, who can obtain small grants or loans or special courses designed to assist their often difficult adaptation to a new environment.\n\nB. Hungarian refugees in Yugoslavia\n\nOVER-ALL MOVEMENT OF REFUGEES\n\n36. The total number of Hungarian refugees who entered Yugoslavia was 19,857. By the end of January 1958, a solution had been found for each individual in this group. A total of 16,409 refugees had emigrated, 2,773 had been voluntarily repatriated and 675 were considered to be integrated in Yugoslavia. The refugees resettled included a considerable proportion of difficult cases and persons suffering from physical or social handicaps, who would not normally meet the selection criteria of countries of immigration.\n\nPROVISION OF CARE AND MAINTENANCE\n\n37. While the main burden of providing care and maintenance was borne by the Yugoslav Government, the League of Red Cross Societies made a valuable contribution by supplying food, clothing and medical supplies. It officially terminated its operation on 30 September 1957, but it left with the Yugoslav Red Cross Society a considerable quantity of stores to be used during the coming months, while some assistance continued to be given by individual Red Cross Societies. The League reports that up to 31 October 1957 national Red Cross Societies had contributed over $430,000 in cash and almost $1,100,000 in kind for the operation in Yugoslavia.\n\n38. The expenditures incurred by the Yugoslav Government for housing, transportation and care and maintenance of Hungarian refugees amounted to some $7,700,000. Towards this amount, UNHCR was enabled to contribute approximately $1,050,000. This, however, still left the Yugoslav Government with a deficit of over $6,600,000.\n\nEND OF OPERATION IN YUGOSLAVIA\n\n39. The Provisional UNHCR Branch Office in Belgrade was opened on 15 February 1957 and withdrawn on 4 February 1958. The entire operation thus lasted approximately one year, and provides an object lesson in what can be achieved if Governments tackle a refugee problem of known size with vigour and determination.\n\nC. Contributions for Hungarian refugees\n\n40. The following table gives details of financial contributions for Hungarian refugees made, up to 15 May 1958, through the Secretary-General or the Office of the High Commissioner. It also gives certain statistics on the movement of refugees from Austria and Yugoslavia as well as between countries of resettlement. It has not been practicable to keep track of all movements of Hungarian refugees, and consequently the figures quoted should be treated as approximations. Figures are rounded to the nearest 100, or the nearest ten, as applicable, and, in general only those countries are included which are believed to have more than twenty Hungarian refugees. The position is shown as of 1 May 1958.\n\nFINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR, AND MOVEMENTS OF, HUNGARIAN REFUGEES - MAY 1958\n\na Arrivals from Yugoslavia.\n\nb Of whom an estimated 178,900 directly from Hungary.\n\nc Including natural increase of about 300.\n\nd Including an estimated 100 directly from Hungary.\n\ne Contribution in kind, not included in total.\n\nf this sum has been transferred, with the agreement of the French Government, to the Far Eastern Operation for care and maintenance, and is therefore not included in total.\n\ng Including an estimated 750 directly from Hungary.\n\nh Arriving from Hungary.\n\nI Considered to be integrated in Yugoslavia.\n\nj Totals are rounded, see para. 40 above.\n\nCHAPTER II SPECIAL REFUGEE PROBLEMS\n\n41. As indicated in the previous annual report, the High Commissioner's Office has been called upon to assist persons who, as a result of events which took place in the Middle East at the beginning of 1957, left the area for certain countries of temporary asylum in Europe, where they are now regarded as coming under the mandate of the High Commissioner's Office. Since the cost of care and maintenance of these persons in transit pending their resettlement is too heavy a burden on the Governments which have offered them temporary asylum, the UNHCR has been asked to provide assistance for them. During the period under review, a contribution of $200,000 was made by UNHCR, from governmental funds placed at its disposal, to two voluntary agencies for the care and maintenance and resettlement of these refugees.\n\n42. UNHCR was also called upon to give assistance to refugees who entered Tunisia in the course of 1957, and helped the Tunisian Government to bear the burden of emergency aid required for these refugees. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which had already given assistance to these refugees, has undertaken to distribute to them food and clothing placed at their disposal through UNHCR or purchased with funds which UNHCR received from several Governments for this purpose.\n\n43. The total assistance given through this Office to refugees in Tunisia amounts so far to $116,000. This assistance, together with that given by one Government in response to a suggestion from the High Commissioner, has made it possible to meet the most urgent requirements during the critical winter period. Further assistance is now being given to these refugees by the League of Red Cross Societies with the funds obtained in response to the joint appeal launched by the League and the International Committee of the Red Cross under the terms of the resolution adopted by the Conference of Red Cross Societies at New Delhi on 10 December 1957.\n\nCHAPTER III INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION\n\nGeneral remarks\n\n44. According to the Statute of the Office, one of the principal functions of the High Commissioner is the international protection of refugees. Only the concrete developments in this field are reported in the present report; but the Office exercises a constant vigilance over the interests of the refugees, and the High Commissioner is in close and continuous communication with Governments in order to improve their legal situation and to support the achievements of the permanent solutions programme by appropriate legal measures to consolidate the integration of the refugees into the community.\n\nA. International instruments affecting refugees\n\n1951 CONVENTION RELATING TO THE STATUS OF REFUGEES\n\n45. The Government of Tunisia announced in November 1957 that it recognized itself as bound by the Convention. The Convention is now in force between the following twenty-two States: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ecuador, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Holy See, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In at least four other countries, ratification of or accession to the Convention is under active consideration.\n\n46. A decree adopted on 10 January 1957 lays down detailed regulations for the application of the Convention in the Netherlands.\n\nCONVENTION ON THE DECLARATION OF DEATH OF MISSING PERSONS\n\n47. The Protocol extending the validity of the United Nations Convention on the Declaration of Death of Missing Persons for a further period of ten years after its expiry on 23 January 1957 has now been acceded to by the following States: Cambodia, China, Israel and Pakistan.\n\nUNIVERSAL COPYRIGHT CONVENTION\n\n48. During the period under review, the following States ratified |Protocol No. 1 of the Universal Copyright Convention which provides for the assimilation of stateless persons and refugees resident in a contracting State to nationals of that State for the purposes of the Convention: the United Kingdom on 27 June 1957, India on 21 October 1957, and Argentina on 13 November 1957. Twenty-three States are now parties to the Convention and to Protocol No. 1.\n\nCONVENTION ON THE RECOVERY ABROAD OF MAINTENANCE\n\n49. The United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance, adopted on 20 June 1956, entered into force on 25 May 1957. It has so far been ratified by six States: China, Israel, Morocco, Guatemala, Hungary and Norway.\n\n50. Refugee families, owing to their displacement, are often obliged to live in a different country from the country of residence of the person on whom they depend for their maintenance; for this reason, the Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance is of particular importance for refugees.\n\nDRAFT CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF FUTURE STATELESSNESS\n\n51. The General Assembly decided by resolution 896(IX) at its ninth session that an international conference of plenipotentiaries should be convened to conclude a Convention for the Reduction or Elimination of Future Statelessness as soon as at least twenty States had communicated to the Secretary-General their willingness to co-operate in such a conference. The following twenty-one States have notified the Secretary-General to that effect: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, El Salvador, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, India, Israel, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia. The conference will probably take place in 1959 and will examine a draft Convention on the Elimination of Future Statelessness and a draft Convention on the Reduction of Future Statelessness drawn up by the International Law Commission.\n\nAGREEMENT RELATING TO REFUGEE SEAMEN\n\n52. For many years the precarious position of refugee seamen, who frequently have no country in which they can lawfully stay, have no valid papers and are in an irregular status everywhere, has received the attention of the High Commissioner's Office.\n\n53. The Government of the Netherlands took the initiative in 1995 of calling an inter-governmental conference, which held three sessions at The Hague, in order to draw up an agreement to regulate the status of refugee seamen. At the third session in November 1957, the eight participating Governments (Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom), unanimously adopted an Agreement relating to Refugee Seamen. This has been signed by all the participating Governments and will come into force ninety days after ratification by these eight countries. Representatives of UNHCR and of the International Labour Organisation participated in the work of the conference.\n\n54. The Agreement represents an important step towards solving the problem of refugee seamen. It contains general criteria according to which refugee seaman who have no country in which they may lawfully stay shall be issued with a travel document provided for by the 1951 Convention, or a similar document, and be accepted in the territory of the State concerned. It also contains more liberal criteria to be applied to existing cases not covered by the general criteria at the time the Agreement comes into force. The general criteria cover:\n\n(a) Refugee seamen who have served under the flag of a contracting party for 600 days during the last three years ; or, failing this,\n\n(b) Refugee seamen who have had their last lawful residence in a contracting State during the last three years.\n\nThe special criteria for existing cases cover:\n\n(a) Refugee seamen who were issued with a travel document valid for return by a contracting State since 1945 ; or, failing this,\n\n(b) Refugee seamen who have were lawfully staying in a contracting State since 1945 ; or, failing this,\n\n(c) Refugee seamen who have served 600 days on a ship flying the flag of a contracting State during any period of three years since 1945.\n\n55. These provisions will give the refugee seamen covered by the new Agreement the right to a travel document, and to admission to the issuing country, so that they will have an opportunity of legally remaining and establishing themselves in that country.\n\n56. The Agreement, moreover, provides that the contracting State also undertake to see that refugees serving on their ships are provided with identity papers, and that refugee seamen are admitted temporarily to the territory of these State for shore leave, for taking up engagements on other ships, and for health reasons.\n\n57. The Agreement is open to accession by any Government which undertakes obligations with respect to refugee seamen under article 28 of the Convention, or obligations corresponding thereto. Although the Agreement has not yet entered into force, a number of the signatory States are already applying its principles.\n\nCONVENTIONS OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE\n\n58. The European Convention on Social and Medical Assistance, together with the Protocol applying the Convention to refugees, was ratified by France in October 1957.\n\n59. A Convention on Extradition was adopted on 13 December 1957 and will come into force ninety days after the deposit of the third instrument of ratification. In consultation with the High Commissioner's Office, a provision was included in the Convention to the effect that extradition shall not be granted if the requested party considers the offence concerned to be of a political nature; or where there are substantial grounds for believing that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made for the purpose of prosecuting a person on account of race, religion, nationality or political opinion, or where the person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.\n\nB. Admission, residence and expulsion\n\n60. The Office has been working in close co-operation with the Manpower Committee of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation to promote implementation, as far as refugees are concerned, of the OEEC Decision governing, the Employment of Nationals of Member Countries. The representative of France has proposed the adoption of Recommendation to the effect that refugees resident in member countries, taking up employment under the Decision in other member countries, should be issued with a travel document valid for return for a period of three years. Certain countries had difficulty in agreeing to this suggestion and, at the thirty-eighth session of the OEEC Manpower Committee which met in April 1958, it was suggested that such right of return should be limited to two years. The matter will be further discussed at the next session of the Manpower Committee and it is hoped that this proposal may be acceptable.\n\n61. The Argentine Government, by resolutions of 6 March and 3 May 1957, extended to refugees in its territory the facilities for residence and registration granted under Argentine legislation to political exiles coming from countries signatories of the International Penal Law Convention, signed in Montevideo in 1899.\n\n62. After consultations between the Austrian authorities and the UNHCR, the procedure for the determination of eligibility of refugees in Austria, which was established by a Decree of the Austrian Ministry of the Interior of 17 February 1956, has been amended by a Decree of the Ministry of the Interior of 29 March 1958.\n\n63. Under the new procedure, the provincial security authorities examine the cases of persons seeking asylum in Austria and determine whether or not they can be considered as refugees according to the 1951 Convention and be granted asylum in Austria ; in negative cases, persons who have reasonable chances of emigration may be permitted to remain temporarily in Austria in order to prepare their emigration. The cases of refugees already in Austria, on which a provisional decision had hitherto been made in so far as they were granted asylum, will be examined under the new procedure. All persons who are considered eligible under the Convention will be issued with a certificate proving their status, and on application, will be issued with the Convention Travel Document.\n\n64. The Decree provides for consultation with the UNHCR Branch Office at the various stages of the procedure. The High Commissioner has appointed two eligibility advisers at the seat of the security authorities in the provinces with the largest influx of refugees. Cases where the security authorities consider that the applicant is not a refugee, but where the eligibility adviser is of a contrary opinion, will be submitted to the Ministry of the Interior, which, in turn, will consult with the UNHCR Branch Office in Vienna. The final decision is taken by the Ministry of the Interior.\n\n65. During 1975, the Branch Office in Belgium received some 5,000 applications for recognition of refugee status, and some 3,600 persons were found eligible. More than 1,000 of these applications came from newly arrived refugees (compared with 200 in 1956.)\n\n66. By a Law of 14 March 1958, which entered into force on 6 April 1958, all refugees in Belgium have been exempted from payment of fees for the issue and renewal of residence permits.\n\n67. In Colombia, a Committee has been set up by a Decree of 6 September 1957 under the Ministry of External Relations to promote emigration and to assume all administrative functions connected with the issue of visas, and the reception and placement of immigrants.\n\n68. In France, in accordance with the principle of family unity, the Office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides (OFPRA) now grants refugee status to the spouses and minor children of eligible refugees who subsequently enter France legally to join their relatives. The extension of this status to minor children over eighteen, which was held in suspense for some time pending discussion with the High Commissioner's Office, has now also been granted. Many hundreds of refugees have thereby been accorded refugee status. This is the practice followed by most European countries signatory to the Convention.\n\n69. In the course of 1957,27,562 new certificates of eligibility were issued (compared with 18,089 in 1956). This figure includes an estimated 1,000 who had been accorded refugee status in another country before entering France. The majority of these new certificates were for pre-war refugees-Russians, Armenians, Poles and Spaniards-who were formally accorded refugee status at the moment of renewal of their residence permits.\n\n70. The existing procedure for the regularization of the position of new refugees entering France illegally has been improved by the issuance of an acknowledgement by the OFPRA of a refugee's application, pending final decision on his eligibility.\n\n71. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the Government has been approached by the Office to simplify and to speed up the procedure for the determination of the eligibility of refugees, which is described in previous annual reports. The Office is also supporting the plans of the Governments to transfer the Federal Reception Centre, where eligibility of newly arrived refugees is determined, from Valka Camp so that they may live under more favourable conditions.\n\n72. During 1957, a total of 5,681 applications for recognition of refugee status were submitted; in addition, 1,514 applications were pending from the previous year. Eight hundred and sixty-four refugees were determined eligible and 1,071 persons were determined to be ineligible; the applications of 3,433 persons were eliminated because the Ordinance of Asylum could not apply to them for various reasons.\n\n73. The figures quoted above do not include the 14,500 Hungarian refugees who were granted asylum in the Federal Republic of Germany after 23 October 1956 and were at first provisionally recognized as refugees. By the end of May 1958, the refugee status of 2,031 Hungarians had been confirmed.\n\n74. In Greece, during 1957, 1,086 applications for recognition of refugee status were received and approved.\n\n75. In Italy, some 10,000 applications for recognition were received, and refugee status was accorded to 7,500, including some 500 refugees already recognized elsewhere.\n\n76. The Office for Refugees and Stateless Persons set up in Morocco at the beginning of 1957 has recognized the validity of the majority of eligibility certificates issued during the period of transition and has itself issued some 700 further certificates.\n\n77. By virtue of the Royal Decree of 10 January 1957, concerning recognition of eligibility and regulating expulsion, the Branch Office in the Netherlands has issued some 2,000 \"mandate certificates\" entitling the holders to the benefits of the 1951 Convention.\n\n78. A new United States Law of 11 September 1957 amending the Immigration and Nationality Law provides for the issue of immigration visas left unused on the expiry of the Refugee Relief Act. The majority of these visas are made available for refugee-escapees. The Act also provides for the admission of some other categories of aliens with close relatives in the United States. The consequences of this Act are referred to in the section of this report dealing with resettlement.\n\n79. In Uruguay, a Bill regulating immigration is at present under consideration by the Congress. The Bill contains provisions regarding the selection, transportation and admission, with the co-operation of the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration and of voluntary agencies, of refugees, individually or in groups. The Bill further authorizes the Government to waive, in the case of refugees, certain requirement to with regard to documentation, and to age and health, in the case of persons coming to join their families in Uruguay.\n\nC. Rights of refugees in their countries of residence\n\nRIGHT TO WORK\n\n80. The Austrian Government, when ratifying the 1951 Convention, made a reservation in connexion with article 17 concerning wage-earning employment. Nevertheless, the Austrian Government, by decree, exempted refugees fulfilling certain conditions form the restrictions imposed on foreign labour. One of the conditions giving such exemption was the completion of three years' residence in Austria; and, in February 1958, the Austrian authorities extended the decree, which until then applied to all refugees covered by the 1954 Convention provided they had entered Austria prior to 1 January 1955. Refugees holding a refugee certificate, irrespective of the length of residence, will be treated in the same way as Austrian nationals by the employment offices as regards placement in employment.\n\n81. In the United Arab Republic (province of Egypt), the position of refugees remains rather difficult, mainly in view of the economic situation and of the limited possibilities open to them for obtaining employment. With the co-operation of the authorities, however, it has been possible to solve many individual problems; furthermore, the officials concerned have facilitated the renewal of refugees in certain individual cases where the High Commissioner's representative has intervened.\n\n82. The most important development in Italy in the field of legal protection during the period under review has been the declaration by the Italian Government on 27 July 1957 in application of article 17 of the Convention. This declaration states that the Government has decided to grant residence permits and work permits of unlimited duration to refugees within the High Commissioner's mandate who, on 27 March 1957, are living outside camps, have lived in Italy for at least there years or who have al wife or children of Italian nationality, and who are not being assisted by the Administration Aiuti Internazionali or by the United States Escapee program. Refugees who cease to be assisted by AAI or USEP will be given the same privilege.\n\n83. Detailed administrative instructions for the implementation of this decision have been issued to the local authorities concerned, and the procedure is working satisfactorily.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY\n\n84. The value of the assistance given to refugees in Belgium by the public assistance authorities reached an estimated twelve million Belgian francs in 1957, compared with nine millions in 1956.\n\n85. In Luxembourg, new Hungarian refugees with dependent children receive family allowances without having to fulfil the normal waiting period.\n\nLEGAL ASSISTANCE IN INDIVIDUAL CASES\n\n86. In Austria, under an UNREF project, funds have been provided to give legal counselling to individual refugees within the mandate of the High Commissioner, and especially to foreign-speaking refugees, with a view to resolving legal or administrative difficulties which are impeding their integration.\n\n87. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the UNHCR Office has been enabled by the United Nations Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to establish a fund to pay lawyers' and court fees for refugees who are in need of legal aid in court proceedings and who cannot obtain aid from any other source.\n\n88. In Greece, legal assistance is given to foreign refugees, and also to refugees of Greek ethnic origin, under an UNREF project signed in August 1957 with the Refugee Service s of a legal counsellor who can give day-by-day advice and refer refugees in need of aid in court actions to a panel of lawyers ready to give their services free of charge, and also for meeting stamp fees and court other charges in civil cases.\n\n89. Similar arrangements for the provision of legal assistance in individual cases are being made in Italy.\n\nD. Naturalization\n\n90. In Austria, 14,064 refugees acquired Austrian nationality during 1957, of whom 1,455 were foreign-speaking refugees and 12,609 refugees of German ethnic origin. A total of 10,626 of the latter obtained naturalization under the Option Law of 2 June 1954, which expired on 30 June 1956, and the remainder by the ordinary process of naturalization. The Austrian Government has requested provincial governments to process applications for naturalization from foreign-speaking refugees without insisting on their producing expatriation permits from the authorities of their countries of origin.\n\n91. During 1957, 474 aliens were accorded Belgian nationality, the majority of them refugees.\n\n92. An estimated 3,500 refugees obtained French nationality during 1957, including about 1,500 Spaniards and 1,000 Poles.\n\n93. On 19 August 1957, a new German Law on Nationality Questions was enacted which facilitates the acquisition of German citizenship by foreign wives of German nationals and by former German nationals who had acquired another nationality after Nazi persecution.\n\nE. Travel documents\n\n94. Two further to the 1951 Convention, Ecuador and Ireland, are now issuing the travel document for which that Convention provides.\n\n95. On 15 May 1957 the arrangements between the Benelux countries and France entered into force, exempting from the requirement of an entry visa for temporary travel refugees residing in those countries and holding travel document issued under the 1951 Convention or under the London Travel Document Agreement of 1946.\n\n96. Similar arrangements are already in force between the Benelux countries, and negotiations are taking place with a view to the conclusion of such agreements between other European countries.\n\n97. The Council of Europe Special Committee of Senior Officials for the Simplification of Frontier Formalities included in its agenda, at various sessions during the last year, items referring to the facilitation of travel for refugees. A draft multilateral agreement on the abolition of visas for refugees was submitted to the Committee by the Netherlands delegation. The Committee, while agreeing to the principle of the draft agreement, has not yet agreed on certain technical points and the draft is to be discussed further at future meetings of the Special Committee.\n\n98. At its sixth session held Athens from 3 to 6 March, the Committee adopted a draft resolution recommending Governments, members of the Council of Europe, pending the conclusion of a multilateral agreement exempting refugees from visas, to grant visas to refugees free of charge and also to speed up the procedure for their issue. The resolution contains further recommendations with regard to the issue of a standardized travel document for refugees under the 1951 Convention, or failing this, a document under the London Agreement of 1946, or a similar document. This draft resolution has been approved by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.\n\nF. Special problems\n\nINDEMNIFICATION AND RESTITUTION\n\n99. On 5 July 1957, the Federal Indemnification Law (Bundesentschaedigungsgesetz) was amended to extend the date-line for the filing of applications to 31 March 1958. Negotiations have continued between the German Federal Government and eleven other Governments on the problem of indemnification for victims of Nazi persecution living in these countries.\n\n100. An agreement was concluded on 6 February 1957 between the firm of I. G. Farben Industrie (in liquidation) and the Jewish Material Claims Conference for the benefit of those former concentration camp inmates who had to do forced labour in the Auschwitz area. Under the agreement, a fund of DM 30,000,000 has been established for distribution to claimants by the Jewish Material Claims Conference.\n\n101. Pursuant to provisions contained in the Bonn Convention of 26 May 1952 on the Settlement of Matters arising out of the War and the Occupation, a Restitution Law (Bundesrückerstattungsgestz) was enacted in the Federal Republic of Germany on 19 July 1957. This Law regulates the claims of victims of persecution for identifiable property of which they were deprived under the Nazi regime and which at present cannot be identified or no longer exists.\n\n102. Under this Law, the claimants are entitled to damages from the Federal Republic to the extent of the repurchase value of the property. The Government is obliged to grant compensation up to a total of DM 1,500,000,000. Compensation will, in particular, be granted for jewellery and other valuables confiscated by the Nazi regime, and confiscated household goods and furniture, as well as securities on bank accounts, provided the claimant can prove that the confiscated property was sent to Germany. According to a special provision, compensation should also be given for goods in removal vans confiscated in Europe outside the Federal Republic of Germany, if the claimant has emigrated from the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany and had his last domicile or permanent residence there. The date-line for the filing of claims, which was originally fixed for 1 April 1958, has since been extended until 31 December 1958.\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRACING SERVICE\n\n103. The Branch Office in Germany continues its close co-operation with the International Tracing Service, which is administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross under supervision of an international commission on which the Office is represented by an observer. During 1957, the International Tracing Service received 203,801 communications concerning persons who had suffered persecution, displaced persons and refugees. These included 134,462 requests for certificates needed for indemnification proceedings, 36,740 requests for death certificates and 32,599 other inquiries.\n\nCHAPTER IV THE PROMOTION OF REPATRIATION AND RESETTLEMENT\n\nVoluntary repatriation\n\n104. As hitherto, the voluntary repatriation of refugees within the mandate of the High Commissioner's Office has been facilitated in accordance with the provisions of the Statute, and when a refugee notifies the Office or one of the Branch Offices of his desire to return to his country of origin, he is referred to the authorities of that country. When difficulties arise, the matter is dealt with through diplomatic channels. Furthermore, due safeguards are applied to ensure the protection of refugees who are given the opportunity of being repatriated, as provided by the Statute and by resolution 925 (X) of the General Assembly, adopted on 25 October 1955. As a general rule, the repatriation of a refugee is paid for by the Government of his country of origin. In the case of Hungarian refugees, however, the Governments of some countries of resettlement have generously assumed the cost of repatriation of refugees who expressed the wish to return to Hungary.\n\n105. According to information received by UNHCR, some 6,300 Hungarian refugees were repatriated during the period under review, and 2,000 other refugees returned to their country of origin during the calendar year 1957. These figures are broken down as follows:\n\na Including a correction of 1,290 for unrecorded repatriation before 30 June 1957.\n\nb Estimate.\n\n106. A repatriation mission went to Austria in September 1957 and visited refugees in Salzburg, the Tyrol and Upper Austria. In accordance with usual practice, the Branch Office in Austria, upon the invitation of the Austrian Government, sent a representative to accompany the mission in the capacity of an impartial observer to see that no undue influence was exercised on the refugees from any side. A Hungarian governmental mission has also visited reception centres of Hungarian refugees in Yugoslavia. In accordance with established procedure, the mission was accompanied by a representative of the Yugoslav Government and by a representative of the UNHCR in the capacity of an impartial observer.\n\nResettlement\n\n107. In the course of 1956, some 88,800 Hungarian refugees were transported from Austria and Yugoslavia to countries of second asylum or other countries of resettlement, and 36,531 other refugees emigrated under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration. During 1957, some 80,900 Hungarian refugees were moved out of Austria and Yugoslavia, and 35,082 other refugees were resettled under the auspices of ICEM, in accordance with the following breakdown:\n\nArea of emigration\n\nCountry of immigration\n\nAustria\n\nGermany (Federal Republic)\n\nGreece\n\nItaly\n\nMiddle East\n\nNetherlands\n\nHong Kong\n\nOthers\n\nTotal\n\nArgentina\n\n6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n13\n\n-\n\n-\n\n3\n\n41\n\n70\n\nAustralia\n\n2,424\n\n440\n\n60\n\n1,262\n\n16\n\n38\n\n1,607\n\n1,216\n\n7,062\n\nBrazil\n\n7\n\n12\n\n9\n\n67\n\n10\n\n2\n\n445\n\n64\n\n616\n\nCanada\n\n3,148\n\n175\n\n133\n\n1,169\n\n9\n\n2\n\n13\n\n372\n\n5,021\n\nChile\n\n9\n\n8\n\n-\n\n3\n\n-\n\n-\n\n140\n\n42\n\n202\n\nColombia\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-\n\n60\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n3\n\n65\n\nRhodesia\n\n12\n\n-\n\n-\n\n5\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n17\n\nIsrael\n\n1\n\n4\n\n-\n\n2\n\n3,947\n\n-\n\n39\n\n6,972\n\n10,965\n\nNew Zealand\n\n-\n\n1\n\n40\n\n5\n\n-\n\n1\n\n-\n\n17\n\n64\n\nUnion of South Africa\n\n3\n\n-\n\n-\n\n3\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2\n\n8\n\nUnited States\n\n1,263\n\n5,896\n\n103\n\n185\n\n19\n\n5\n\n74\n\n8,187\n\n8 732\n\nUruguay\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n17\n\n-\n\n-\n\n6\n\n-\n\n23\n\nVenezuela\n\n4\n\n2\n\n13\n\n100\n\n17\n\n-\n\n62\n\n18\n\n216\n\nOther overseas counties\n\n2\n\n2\n\n16\n\n7\n\n-\n\n-\n\n452\n\n14\n\n493\n\nEuropean countries\n\n135\n\n2\n\n434\n\n738\n\n-\n\n-\n\n117\n\n101\n\n1,527\n\nTotal\n\n7,015\n\n6,546\n\n812\n\n3,636\n\n4,018\n\n48\n\n2,958\n\n10,049\n\n35,082\n\n108. In addition to the above-mentioned 35,082 refugees, approximately 1,000 physically-handicapped refugees were resettled under intra-European schemes without the assistance of ICEM.\n\n109. The slight decrease in the resettlement of other refugees during 1957 mainly resulted from the fact that the movement of refugees to the United States under the Refugee Relief Act ended in April 1957 and that the effects of the amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 11 September 1957 had not yet made themselves felt. On the other hand, the large number of resettlement opportunities which were absorbed by Hungarian refugees since the Hungarian refugee problem arose does not appear to have impinged on the rate of resettlement of other refugees.\n\n110. Every effort is being made by UNHCR, in close co-operation with the Governments of countries of resettlement, with the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration and with the administration of the United States Escapee Program, to take advantage of any resettlement opportunity which becomes available.\n\n111. Particular attention is being given to the emigration of families with one difficult case or handicapped refugee who can be cared for by other self-supporting members of the family, and to the resettlement of refugees who, on account of some physical or social handicap, cannot be accepted under current emigration programmes. Certain countries have already admitted considerable numbers of such refugees; and others are ready to do so if a resettlement grant is provided. A special project has been included in the UNREF Revised Plan of Operations (1958) for this purpose.\n\n112. Considerable attention is also being paid to the reunion of members of families, some of whom cannot rejoin their relatives in immigration countries owing to the fact that they have been previously rejected on medical grounds.\n\n113. The Government of the United States in its Immigration and Nationality Act of 11 September 1957 has already made provision for the immigration of persons previously rejected on the ground of tuberculosis and who wish to join their family in the United States. The Governments of Australia, Canada and New Zealand have also agreed to give favourable consideration to any such outstanding cases of family reunion.\n\n114. In the course of 1957, some 2,500 refugees have been resettled in various European countries mainly under a scheme of various municipalities in the Netherlands, under a Swedish scheme for the admission of difficult cases and dependants, and under the \"Two Thousand Scheme\" in the United Kingdom, which has been described in previous annual reports. The Governments of Denmark, Norway, France, Italy and Switzerland have also admitted a considerable number of difficult cases requiring permanent care in institutions, as shown in the chapter on the UNREF programme.\n\n115. In some instances, grants from the USEP Administration and from UNREF have been necessary to facilitate the establishment of these refugees, while in other instances receiving Governments have shouldered the full responsibility without support from UNREF.\n\nCHAPTER V PROGRAMME OF THE UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE FUND\n\nI. GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\n116. In 1958, the UNREF programme entered its fourth and final year of operation. By 30 April 1958, the value of projects under implementation or negotiation was $13,501,001. As of 31 March 1958, the number of beneficiaries firmly settled was 22,039, of whom 7,123 came from camps and 14,916 were living outside camps. Owing to the normal time-lag between the authorization and the completion of projects, the number of beneficiaries will be considerably higher when all current projects have been completed.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE PROGRAMME\n\n117. Up to 15 May 1958, governmental contributions to a total amount of $13,493,135 had been paid, pledged or promised towards the target of $16,000,000 for governmental contributions to UNREF during the four-year period 1955-1958. There thus remained a need for a further $2,506,865 if the original target was to be met. The contributions towards the four separate annual programmes were as follows:\n\n118. Funds from private sources have, ever since the beginning of the UNREF programme, supplemented the amounts made available in governmental contributions. During 1957, the private contributions included a generous gift of $407,947 from the United Nations Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A recapitulative breakdown of private contributions to UNREF and miscellaneous income is given below:\n\n119. Fund-raising campaigns are under way in Australia, New Zealand and Scotland and in preparation in Canada and Norway. The possibility of launching similar campaigns in a certain number of other countries is under consideration.\n\n120. Full details of governmental and other contributions to UNREF up to 15 May 1958 are given in Annex I.\n\nSURVEY OF THE NON-SETTLED REFUGEE POPULATION\n\n121. For some time, the need has been felt for more precise statistics on the non-settled refugee population, the data available to UNHCR being of a fragmentary nature and often subject to a wide margin of error. At its fifth session, the UNREF Executive Committee therefore authorized the Office to carry out a survey of the non-settled refugee population in various countries under UNREF project PS/1/EUR. The direction of this survey was confided to Professor Ph. J. Idenburg, Director General of Statistics in the Netherlands.\n\n122. The preliminary report on the Survey was forwarded to members of the General Assembly as an annex to the High Commissioner's report to the twelfth session. The final report is now available and shows that, as of mid-summer 1957, there were 58,200 refugees in camps and 120,000 non-settled refugees living outside camps, distributed as follows:\n\nIn camps\n\nOutside camps\n\nTotalb\n\nAustria\n\n30,500a\n\n28,000\n\n59,000\n\nFrance\n\n-\n\n36,000\n\n36,000\n\nGermany, Federal Republic of\n\n20,700\n\n40,000\n\n60,000\n\nGreece\n\n1,400a\n\n8,900\n\n10,300\n\nItaly\n\n5,250\n\n5,500\n\n10,800\n\nTurkey\n\n340\n\n750\n\n1,100\n\n58,200b\n\n120,000b\n\n178,000b\n\na Including unofficial camps.\n\nb Rounded figures.\n\n123. Of the 58,200 refugees living in camps, many were eligible for assistance under the USEP Program or the UNHCR programme for Hungarian refugees. There remained, however, some 33,700 refugees who were the immediate concern of UNREF. Of these, about 2,400 were considered likely to emigrate under normal schemes before the end of 1958, and did not appear in need of any special assistance. Further efforts were, however, still needed to assist the remaining group of 31,300 refugees who were divided as follows:\n\n(a) Approximately 11,800 refugees (or 38 per cent) were in households affected by physical, social or economic handicaps ;\n\n(b) Approximately 2,100 refugees (or 7 per cent) needed adequate employment and accommodation ;\n\n(c) Approximately 17,400 refugees (or 56 per cent) were considered to need only adequate housing.\n\n124. Within the non-settled group living outside camps, there were some 97,000 refugees not expected to emigrate under normal schemes and not eligible for assistance under normal schemes and not eligible for assistance under international programmes. Since the 1958 projects are directed primarily towards camp clearance, the UNREF programme can only hope to cater for a very small proportion of their total needs. These 97,000 refugees can be divided as follows:\n\n(a) Approximately 35,500 persons (or 37 per cent) were in households affected by physical, social and economic handicaps ;\n\n(b) Approximately 17,500 persons (or 18 per cent) were in need of employment and, in the majority of cases, housing ;\n\n(c) Approximately 43,500 persons (or 45 per cent) needed only housing. For various reasons, it was impossible to assess with sufficient accuracy the size of this group in France and Germany, and the estimates for this category should be considered as very conservative.\n\n125. The problem of these refugees outside camps was to be considered by the UNREF Executive Committee in the light of General Assembly resolution 1166 (XII) of 26 November 1957.\n\nINTENSIFICATION OF THE UNREF PROGRAMME FOR CAMP CLEARANCE\n\n126. It has been the policy of the UNREF Executive Committee to concentrate the programme on finding solutions for refugees living in camps. It was evident in 1957, however, that it would be impossible for the programme to settle, in the course of 1958, all the refugees in need of UNREF assistance in camps. Now that the Survey findings have become available, it is possible to assess the problem more accurately. It appears likely that, if all projects authorized within the UNREF Revised Plan of Operations (1958) can be implemented, there will still remain some 11,600 refugees in camps needing assistance of the type provided by UNREF.\n\n127. The problem was considered by the UNREF Executive Committee which, at its sixth (special) session in July 1957, adopted a resolution (No. 6) in which it requested that the permanent solutions programme be intensified to the fullest extent possible. This request was endorsed by the Economic and Social council at its twenty-fourth session (resolution 650 C (XXIV) of 24 July 1957) and was subsequently embodied by the General Assembly in resolution 1166 (XII). The action taken under this resolution in appealing for the additional funds needed for closing the refugee camps is described in chapter VI of this report.\n\n128. Every effort is being made to intensify the UNREF programme in 1958. The progress that will be possible is dependent upon the extent to which funds are made available. In order to meet the General Assembly's request for an intensification of the UNREF programme for camp clearance, a supplementary programme estimated to involve a UNHCR expenditure of $4,800,000 has been drawn up for the 11,600 refugees in camps who still need assistance. The UNREF Executive Committee was to consider this programme.\n\n129. Details of contributions totalling $571,502 paid, pledged or promised specifically for the Programme for Camp Clearance are given in Annex I.\n\nII. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME\n\nA. Expenditures and beneficiaries\n\n130. The UNREF programme, which is being implemented in twelve countries, falls into four main divisions: a permanent solutions programme, a programme for the settlement of difficult cases, an emergency aid programme, and the Far Eastern Operation. As of 30 April 1958, the UNREF programme disposed of funds for 641 projects amounting to a total value to UNREF of $13,501,001. Of these, 122 projects to a value to UNREF OF $3,034, 830 were in various stages of negotiation and 519 projects, for which the UNREF contribution amounted to $10,466,171, were either completed or in course of implementation. The latter figure was broken down as follows:\n\n$\n\nPermanent solutions\n\n7,317,038\n\nSettlement of difficult cases\n\n1,231,058\n\nEmergency aid\n\n310,450\n\nFar Eastern Operation\n\n1,607,625\n\n10,466,171\n\n131. These funds consisted of $8,661,046 from governmental contributions and $1,805,125 from private contributions and other income. In addition, supporting contributions totalling approximately $16,000,000 were made from within the countries where the programme is being carried out. Supporting contributions thus amounted to about 61 per cent of the total direct cost of the projects, which came to about $26,500,000. These figures do not include certain indirect supporting contributions in the form of services, which are difficult to evaluate.\n\n132. The above figures include part of the UNREF Revised Plan of Operations (1958) authorized in a total amount of $5,500,000, the implementation of which, subject to availability of funds, began in January 1958.\n\n133. The most recent set of figures for beneficiaries of the UNREF programme shows the position on 31 March 1958. By that date, 22,039 refugees had been firmly settled under the programme, of whom 7,123 were living in camps. A further 12,864 refugees (excluding those assisted under emergency aid projects) had benefited substantially from the programme. The table on the following page gives a breakdown of these figures by type of programme and country.\n\nB. Permanent solutions\n\nOVER-ALL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS PROGRAMME\n\n134. The permanent solutions programme has been increasingly focused on the refugee camp population in Austria, Germany, Greece and Italy. Due regard has, however, still been paid to the needs of refugees living outside camps in these countries, especially Greece and Italy, as well as in Belgium, France, Lebanon, turkey and the United Arab Republic.\n\n135. The systematic drive to clear the camps by finding a permanent solution for each refugee inmate has been maintained. It is planned to clear a total of forty-eight camps in Austria and Germany during 1958 and as many as possible in Greece and Italy. Further details are given below under individual country headings.\n\n136. The programme was originally designed to help refugees to help themselves. This objective has become progressively more difficult to achieve as the benefits of the programme extend to economically weaker members of the cap population suffering from various physical and social handicaps that impede their integration. For such persons, extensive rehabilitation is often necessary. They must also be given long and sympathetic counselling. Finally, many of them may never be able to earn a normal wage, and special arrangements are necessary to reduce the rent on new accommodation to a level which they can afford.\n\nOVER-ALL ANALYSIS OF THE UNREF PROGRAMME AS OF 31 MARCH 1958 a\n\nConsolidated numbers of actual beneficiaries by programme, country and stage of settlement\n\nProgramme Country\n\nFirmly settled\n\nBeneficiaries not firmly settled\n\nAll beneficiaries\n\nFrom camps\n\nOutside camps\n\nTotal\n\nFrom camps\n\nOutside camps\n\nTotal\n\nFrom camps\n\nOutside camps\n\nTotal\n\nI.

The total number of the latter is estimated at some 9,000 refugees.\n\nb Within the last six months, seven beneficiaries of this category (two difficult cases and five dependants) returned of their own free will to Italy.\n\nc Excluding 148 difficult cases already included in Part II  China.\n\nAUSTRIA\n\n137. By 31 March 1958, a total of 9,989 refugees had been firmly settled under permanent solutions projects in Austria. Of this number, 3,562 came from camps. A further 5,475 refugees, including 2,697 from camps, had also benefited from the programme.\n\n138. As far as refugees within the mandate of this Office are concerned, Austria has the second largest camp population after Germany. According to the Survey of the non-settled refugee population, the number of refugees in official and unofficial camps eligible for assistance under the UNREF programme was 12,400 at mid-summer 1957. This figure excludes new Hungarian refugees, refugees eligible for USEP assistance and refugees living outside the camps. An all-out effort is being made to clear as many camps as possible in the course of 1958, and twenty-one camps have been scheduled for clearance during 1958 and the early part of 1959. Essential data have been collected, in co-operation with the Austrian authorities, on the population of these twenty-one and of the remaining thirty official camps, so that UNHCR is now in possession of full statistical information on all official camps and is preparing for a complete camp clearance programme.\n\n139. The problem of providing satisfactory accommodation at suitable rents continues to be the foremost preoccupation of the Office. Under the Plans of Operations 1955-1958, the construction of 2,821 dwelling units is provided for. By 31 March 1958, 935 units had been completed, and a further 648 units were expected to be ready in 1958 or early 1959. The remaining 1,238 units are in various stages of planning or negotiation. Sufficient funds are not yet available, however, to implement the full 1958 housing programme, and the progress that can be achieved depends on the extent to which further UNREF contributions are made available.\n\n140. During the early stages of the programme, UNREF paid between one quarter and one third of the total cost of new housing. With the concentration of the programme on camps and the increasing proportion of beneficiaries in a weaker economic and social position, the share of international funds temporarily rose as high as two-thirds of the total cost. The Office of UNHCR is at present exploring the possibilities of obtaining an increased share of Austrian public funds.\n\n141. The counselling projects in Austria play a major role in the implementation of the entire programme, since it is through the counsellors that the refugees are directed towards projects for housing, credit and other purposes. Every effort has therefore been made to ensure that the counselling programme is organized as efficiently as possible, and that full coverage is available for all camps listed for closure in 1958.\n\n142. An important part is also played by projects giving credit facilities for such purposes as setting up small businesses, establishment on farms, and the purchase of furniture. Other sections of the programme are devoted to the rehabilitation of handicapped refugees, and to assisting the education of younger refugees in high schools, in vocational training institutes and in universities.\n\nGERMANY\n\n143. By 31 March 1958, a total of 3,749 refugees had been firmly settled under the permanent solutions programme, including 2,753 from camps. A further 5,106 refugees, including 3,695 from camps, had also benefited from the programme.\n\n144. Germany contains the largest number of refugees in camps. On 1 January 1958, there were 18,700 refugees eligible for UNREF assistance distributed in seventy-seven official camps.\n\n145. The German authorities are assisting the efforts of my Office, particularly through their \"Kasernenraeumungsprogramm\", or programme for the clearance of barracks. According to present plans, eleven camps containing 3,200 refugees will be cleared under this scheme in 1958. The authorities are also co-operating in arranging for the systematic clearance of camps outside the \"Kasernenraeumungsprogramm\". In all, it is planned to clear twenty-seven camps, containing 5,700 refugees, in the course of 1958.\n\n146. Linking the UNREF programme to the clearance of specified camps has involved many changes in approach. In housing, for instance, it is no longer sufficient simply to make apartments available to refugees wherever possible: the location of the building has to be adapted to that of the camps, and above all the rent has to be at a level which specific refugees can reach.\n\n147. By 31 March 1958, 348 dwelling units had been completed. Construction had started on a further 583 dwellings, while technical preparations were in various stages of progress for a further 647 units. The total number of units to be built in Germany thus comes to 1,578.\n\n148. Other important components of the permanent solutions programme in Germany are integration counselling and placement, rehabilitation of handicapped refugees, and the provision of credit, particularly for the purchase of furniture and household equipment. All these types of project have a role to play in bringing about the clearance of camps.\n\nGREECE\n\n149. By 31 March 1958, a total of 488 refugees had been firmly established under permanent solutions projects, of whom 192 came from camps. In addition, 371 refugees, including 140 from camps, had benefited but were not as yet firmly established.\n\n150. The resources of the programme are being concentrated on finding solutions for members of the camp population. According to the Survey of the non-settled refugee population, there were, in mid-summer 1957, 1,140 refugees eligible for UNREF assistance remaining in camps in Greece. Despite the difficulties caused by a continuing influx of new refugees, the Government will clear as many camps as possible by the end of 1958. It is planned to build or purchase 612 dwelling units in Greece within the scope of the UNREF programme. Of these, sixty-seven have already been completed, 122 are nearing completion, and the remaining 423 units are in various stages of progress.\n\nITALY\n\n151. By 31 March 1958, a total of 738 refugees had been firmly settled under the permanent solutions programme in Italy, including 305 from camps. As has been explained in previous reports, the possibilities available to refugees to become integrated in Italy are severely limited by the prevailing unemployment, and the emphasis of the programme is therefore placed on resettlement. A total of 507 refugees have so far emigrated under UNREF projects.\n\n152. A processing centre for emigration has been set up at Latina, and has been operating since the beginning of 1958. UNREF projects for resettlement in the 1955 Plan of Operations have been completed; those in the 1956 Plan, however, seem unlikely to be fully implemented unless further resettlement opportunities are made available by countries of immigration. The refugees to be assisted under the UNREF projects are mostly in the handicapped categories, and special resettlement schemes, based on liberal selection criteria, are urgently needed. It should be pointed out also that there is a continuing influx into Italy of new refugees, the majority of whom are young and healthy. For these persons, too, further resettlement opportunities are needed.\n\n153. With the help of the Italian Government, projects for local settlement are also being implemented. Particular mention may be made of the vocational training centre at Capua, and of a project at Garbagnate for the rehabilitation of tubercular and post-tubercular refugees.\n\nOTHER COUNTRIES\n\n154. Relatively small permanent solutions programmes are being implemented in five other countries: Belgium, France, Lebanon, Turkey and the United Arab Republic.\n\n155. In Belgium, a project for the provision of counselling and placement services has enabled 781 refugees to become firmly settled, while 1,074 others have also benefited.\n\n156. In France, assistance is being provided to handicapped refugees only. A total of 230 refugees have so far been firmly settled, and ten others have benefited, under projects for rehabilitation, for the integration of refugee intellectuals, and for the establishment of refugees in crafts and trades.\n\n157. In Lebanon, five refugees have become firmly settled while five others have benefited without yet becoming firmly settled, under a project for establishment in crafts and trades.\n\n158. In Turkey, seven refugees have been firmly settled, and 157 others have been assisted, under projects for vocational training, aid to university students, establishment in crafts and trades, and language training.\n\n159. In the United Arab Republic, twenty-seven refugees have been firmly settled, while thirty others have benefited without yet becoming firmly settled, under projects for vocational training, establishment in crafts and trades, and promotion of resettlement.\n\nC. Settlement of difficult cases\n\nGROUPS OF DIFFICULT CASES\n\n160. Efforts have been increased to find settlement opportunities for the so-called \"difficult cases\"-refugees who, because of age, illness or other incapacity, are unable to earn their own subsistence and have no relatives who can support them. According to the findings of the Survey of the non-settled refugee population, there were 4,700 difficult cases in camps (including all family members) at mid-summer 1957, while 16,300 non-settled difficult case and dependants were living outside camps. There is a further group of difficult cases among refugees of European origin in the Far East whose number is in the region of one thousand. Finally, there is a limited but important problem of difficult cases in the Middle East.\n\nINTERNATIONAL RESETTLEMENT OF DIFFICULT CASES\n\n161. The most striking development during the period under review has been an increase in the international resettlement of difficult cases, notably in countries outside Europe. The first non-European country to participate in such schemes was Australia which, in 1956, accepted twenty aged refugees from the Far East, and increased the number in 1957 to forty. The Government of New Zealand has also approved the admission of a first group of aged refugees from the mainland of China. Particular mention should be made, for European countries, of the chronic sick and paralysed refugees from the Far East accepted by France, and of the new groups of tubercular and mental cases admitted from the same area to Denmark and Sweden. The agreement given by the Italian government to admit forty aged refugees from China for settlement in institutions is especially significant in view of the important refugee problem that Italy already has to face. Belgium and Switzerland have also accepted almost forty difficult cases from the Far East for settlement in 1958. The principal need is now for funds for ICEM for transportation from the Far East so that advantage can be taken of the offers available.\n\n162. The intra-European resettlement of difficult cases has continued to make a valuable indirect contribution to the UNREF programme. By assuming the full responsibility for the permanent care of such refugees without assistance from UNREF, Governments of European countries incurred obligations evaluated at $417,990 in the course of 1957. In addition, voluntary agencies and private bodies, mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands, have ensured the admission and permanent settlement of difficult cases, as well as of handicapped and difficult-to-(re)settle refugees, with help from the USEP Administration or UNREF, in the form of one-time grants.\n\nTHE PROBLEM IN AUSTRIA AND GERMANY\n\n163. The survey of difficult cases living outside camps in Austria, which was begun in late 1956 and suspended as a result of the influx of Hungarian refugees, has now been completed. The final report will be available shortly. Among the refugees not eligible for USEP assistance, it was found that 885 households comprising 2,174 persons contained 1,058 difficult cases and that sixty-five households comprising 142 persons contained seventy-eight physically handicapped refugees. Some ninety-three households were found to be difficult-to-(re) settle.\n\n164. In Austria, refugees have, on the whole, been reluctant to enter institutions, and homes established with UNREF assistance are being filled only slowly. It is hoped, however, that when the camp clearance programme is further advanced and additional counselling has been provided, more refugees who are in need of institutional care will be prevailed upon to accept this solution. Other difficult cases are being given housing, while arrangements are made to ensure that they are visited by social workers and provided with medical and nursing care whenever necessary.\n\n165. It has become evident that a programme for difficult cases in Germany will have to be implemented if the camps are to be cleared. As a first step, a survey designed not only to gather information but also to make specific recommendations has been carried out by the Academy for Public Health in Hamburg. The final report covers 2,160 difficult cases, with 1,057 family members, living in eighty-five camps. A first group of projects based on the recommendations of the survey was approved by the UNREF Executive Committee at its seventh session. Institutional settlement was proposed for only about 15 per cent of the cases, while housing combined with arrangements for special care was recommended for 75 per cent, the remaining 10 per cent being provided with various individual solutions.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF UNREF PROJECTS\n\n166. By 31 March 1958, 936 difficult cases, including forty-six dependants, had been settled under UNREF projects. Of these, 307 were settled in local institutions in Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain, Turkey and the Middle East, 492 were moved from their country of residence and settled in institutions in Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, while 137 aged refugees in Greece and Italy were given annuities.\n\nD. Emergency aid\n\n167. Individual emergency aid projects for the most needy groups of refugees have been implemented in Greece, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and the United Arab Republic under the 1957 and 1958 programmes. An imprest account has also been made available to help refugees in other countries. Under the 1957 programme, for which the UNREF allocation was $134,259, 5,390 refugees were given medical assistance, food or other special aid. Under the 1958 programme 2,969 refugees benefited between 1 January and 31 March 1958.\n\nE. Far Eastern Operation\n\n168. Previous reports to the General Assembly have described the Far Eastern Operation (formerly known as the Shanghai Operation), under which the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration and UNHCR work jointly to resettle refugees of European origin living in China. ICEM is responsible for transportation, while UNHCR finances the care and maintenance of refugees in transit in Hong Kong.\n\n169. In 1955, the number of refugees entering Hong Kong and resettled was 594, while in 1956 it reached 1,191. In 1957, however, there was a great increase and a total of 4,120 refugees entered Hong Kong to await onward movement. As a result of this influx, the funds available to ICEM for transportation became dangerously low, and movement was slowed down. This, in turn, led to an increase in the number of refugees receiving care and maintenance in Hong Kong, and the UNREF allocation for care and maintenance during 1957 had to be increased by some $81,000.\n\n170. In August 1957, the Director of ICEM addressed an appeal for transportation funds to member Governments of his organization, the proceeds of which were sufficient to bring the total number of refugees moved in 1957 to 2,979. On 1 January 1958, however, there were still 1,141 refugees in Hong Kong awaiting onward movement, while ICEM was left with funds to move only about 350.\n\n171. The problem was considered by the UNREF Executive Committee at its seventh session in January 1958. The Committee unanimously adopted resolution No. 7 in which it authorized the High Commissioner, after proper consultation with the Director of ICEM, to appeal to Governments for special contributions to enable the Far Eastern Operation to continue, and authorized him to use such contributions to provide appropriate permanent solutions for the refugees.\n\n172. A joint appeal for funds for transportation was made by the Director of ICEM and the High Commissioner in January 1958, and further contributions were received by ICEM from several Governments. Movement out of Hong Kong during the first quarter of 1958 has, however, proved disappointing. The total number moved between 1 January and 3 May was 690, while there were 395 new arrivals. The number in transit in Hong Kong was thus still as high as 846 on 3 May.\n\n173. The slow reduction in the case-load in Hong Kong may be attributed to three main factors. First, refugees continued to enter Hong Kong at an average rate of 100 per month during the first quarter of 1958. Secondly, the scale of shipping arrangements made by ICEM had been substantially reduced by January 1958 as a result of the shortage of funds, which also precluded long-term planning of transportation and the necessary advance reservation of shipping space. Thirdly, nearly 500 of the transients in Hong Kong are members of a religious sect known as Old Believers: the resettlement project planned for this group has proved unsuitable and it has been necessary for them to remain in Hong Kong until new arrangements have been completed. The entire group is, however, scheduled to depart during May and June.\n\n174. As a result of the slow reduction in the caseload, the total UNREF allocation of $179,000 for care and maintenance during 1958 was exhausted by mid-March. Further funds of $108,317 have been found through the generous co-operation of two Governments and a private agency in New Zealand, and will enable the refugees to be maintained until about the end of May.\n\n175. Tentative estimates have been made of the further expenditures that would be involved if the Far Eastern Operation were to be completed by the end of 1960. Funds available to ICEM in May 1958 for transportation from the Far East were sufficient to move only another 510 refugees by 30 June 1958. It would be desirable for ICEM to move a further 2,550 refugees during the last six months of 1958 at a cost of approximately $1,325,000, and 4,000 refugees in each of the years 1959 and 1960 at a cost of some $2,087,500 per annum. The total, from 1 July 1958 to 31 December 1960, would be approximately $5,500,000. The total cost to UNHCR for care and maintenance during the same period would reach $525,000 if the average case-load in Hong Kong could be maintained at 250 persons and the per capita transit time at three weeks.\n\nCHAPTER VI ACTION TAKEN IN CONNEXION WITH GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTIONS 1166 (XII) AND 1167 (XII)\n\nEffects of General Assembly resolution 1166 (XII)\n\n176. On 26 November 1957, the General Assembly adopted resolution 1166 (XII) on international assistance to refugees within the mandate of UNHCR. In this resolution the General Assembly took, inter alia, the following measures:\n\n(a) It reaffirmed the basic principle laid down in the Statute that permanent solutions for refugees were to be found by actions designed to facilitate their voluntary repatriation, or their assimilation within new national communities.\n\n(b) It requested the High Commissioner to intensify the UNREF programme, primarily in order to find solutions for refugees in camps, and authorized him to appeal for the additional funds needed for the clearance of camps.\n\n(c) It decided that the UNREF programme was to be terminated on 31 December 1958, except so far as concerned projects started but not completed before that date.\n\n(d) It requested the Economic and Social Council to establish an Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme to replace the UNREF Executive Committee.\n\n(e) It left to the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme the decision on whether it is appropriate for international assistance to be provided through the Office of UNHCR in order to help solve specific refugee problems remaining unsolved after 31 December 1958, or arising after that date.\n\n(f) It delegated to the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme the power to authorize him to appeal for funds to solve specific refugee problems.\n\n(g) It authorized the High Commissioner to establish an emergency fund not to exceed $500,000 to be maintained from repayments of UNREF loans and from voluntary contributions.\n\n(h) It requested the UNREF Executive Committee to exercise in 1958 such function incumbent upon the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme as it deemed necessary to ensure the continuity of international assistance to refugees.\n\nAction taken by the High Commissioner under resolution 1166 (XII)\n\n177. In accordance with operative paragraph 1 (b) of the resolution, the High Commissioner has sent a letter of appeal to all States Members of the United Nations or members of the specialized agencies explaining the need for additional funds to finance the clearance of camps, and requesting contributions. The final amount yielded by this appeal can only be assessed at the end of 1958.\n\n178. The High Commissioner has spared no effort to initiate the intensification of the programme of the United Nations Refugee Fund to the fullest extent possible in order to achieve permanent solutions for the maximum number of refuges remaining in camps, without losing sight of the need to continue to seek solutions for the problems of refugees outside camps. A Programme for Camp Clearance has been drawn up for submission to the UNREF Executive Committee at its eighth session. However, as was stated already in resolution No.6, adopted by the UNREF Executive Committee at its sixth (special) session, and subsequently endorsed by Economic and Social Council resolution 650 (XXIV) of 24 July 1957 and General Assembly resolution 1166 (XII), this intensification of the UNREF programme will be practicable only to the extent that adequate funds are made available.\n\n179. In order to assure the continuity of international assistance to refugees, the UNREF Executive Committee was also to consider a \"Note on the Problem of International Assistance to Non-Settled Refugees after termination of the UNREF Programme\" (A/AC.79/115). In the light of this document, advice is sought as to whether it is appropriate for international assistance to be provided through the Office in order to help solve, in particular, specific refugee problems remaining unsolved after 31 December 1958. The decisions taken by the UNREF Executive Committee will be found in the report on the eighth session (see Annex III).\n\nAction taken by the UNREF Executive Committee under resolution 1166 (XII)\n\n180. At its seventh session, in January 1958, the UNREF Executive Committee took two measures under this resolution.\n\n181. First, after considering the difficulties facing the Far Eastern Operation, it exercised the functions of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme in adopting resolution No.7, in which it recognized the need to continue to provide international assistance for refugees of European origin in the Far East, and authorized the High Commissioner to appeal to Governments for special contributions to enable the Far Eastern operation to continue, after proper consultation with the Director of ICEM. Further details are given in the section concerning the Far Eastern Operation (paragraphs 168 to 175).\n\n182. Secondly, the UNREF Executive Committee, upon the suggestion of the High Commissioner, agreed that the emergency fund established under paragraph 7 of resolution 1166 (XII) should be opened as of 1 January 1958. The Committee was to consider at its eighth session the possibility of giving the High Commissioner, either provisionally or otherwise, directives regarding the way in which the sums paid into the emergency fund should be used. The Committee's decisions will be found in its report (see Annex III).\n\nAction taken by the UNREF Executive Committee and the High Commissioner in connexion with resolution 1167 (XII)\n\n183. In its resolution 1167 (XII), adopted on 26 November 1957, the General Assembly recognized that the problem of Chinese refugees in Hong Kong is such as to be of concern to the international community. It therefore appealed to States Members of the United Nations and of the specialized agencies, and non-governmental organizations, to give all possible assistance to alleviate the distress of these refugees, and it authorized the High Commissioner to use his good offices to encourage arrangements for contributions. States Members of the United Nations and of the specialized agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, have been informed that the High Commissioner is ready to use his good offices as authorized by the resolution, and that a special account has been opened for financial contributions paid through the Office. Funds received would be made available for assistance to the Chinese refugees in Hong Kong in consultation with the Government of Hong Kong.\n\n184. At its seventh session, the UNREF Executive Committee noted the action of the General Assembly in resolution 1167 (XII) and welcomed the statement therein that the problem of Chinese refugees in Hong Kong \"is such as to be of concern to the international community\". The Executive Committee expressed the hope that the response to the appeal of the General Assembly would be generous and widespread.\n\nCHAPTER VII GENERAL ACTIVITIES\n\nA. Relations with Specialized Agencies of the United Nations\n\nINTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION\n\n185. The High Commissioner has continued to collaborate with the International Labour Organisation on matters concerning refugees, and particularly refugee seamen. A representative of the ILO took part, with a representative of this Office, in The Hague Conference held in November 1957, at which an Agreement on the status of refugee seamen was signed by the eight participating Governments. The High Commissioner has suggested to the ILO that it should encourage further accessions to the Agreement and has also asked governmental authorities and maritime organizations to ensure that refugee seamen are informed of their rights under the Agreement.\n\n186. In May 1958, the 41st (Maritime) Session of the International Labour Conference considered as one of the items before it a convention on identity documents for seamen, who sometimes go to sea without passports. The identity document would be recognized for such purposes as transit and shore-leave, as well as for readmission to the territory of the issuing State. This Office was represented at the meeting at which the draft convention was drawn up, and the text includes an article whereby refugee seamen can also have the benefit of the identity document.\n\nUNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION\n\n187. Valuable co-operation on matters affecting refugees has been maintained between UNESCO and this Office. In the previous annual report it was stated that an educational adviser was to be lent by UNESCO to the UNHCR Branch Office in Vienna to assist in the planning of educational projects for young Hungarian refugees. An adviser was again seconded by UNESCO for a short period at the beginning of 1958. The educational programme, in which this Office is participating in Austria, is on a considerable scale, and the High Commissioner is grateful to the Director-General of UNESCO and his two staff members for their help.\n\nWORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n188. The World Health Organization, which has already given valuable assistance to the High Commissioner for Refugees by carrying out a survey of health problems of Hungarian refugees in Austria, has again been consulted by this Office in connexion with the difficult psycho-social situation of certain groups of refugees who have been living for years in camps in Austria and Germany, and will place an expert at the disposal of UNHCR to investigate the situation.\n\nB. Relations with the Council of Europe\n\n189. Close liaison has been maintained between the Council of Europe and UNHCR since the previous annual report. In its Recommendation 144 of 4 May 1957, the Standing Committee of the Consultative Assembly asked the Committee of Ministers to support the second joint appeal of the Secretary-General and this office for further contributions for assistance to Hungarian refugees and to invite Governments members of the Council of Europe to take into account the problem of Hungarian refugees in Yugoslavia and to assist in their resettlement.\n\n190. The Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, in response to the annual memorandum submitted to it by this Office, for information, adopted a Recommendation (No. 149) at its ninth session in which it recommended that the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe urge Governments members of the Council of Europe to increase their offers of resettlement for refugees within the mandate of UNHCR, to make their greatest effort to increase their financial contributions towards UNREF, and to respond generously to appeals for additional funds required for the Far Eastern Operation.\n\n191. The Council of Europe was represented by an observer at meetings of the UNREF Executive Committee, and a representative of this Office attended the Consultative Assembly and the Advisory Committee of the Council's Special Representative for National Refugees and Surplus Population, as well as other meetings where legal questions affecting refugees within the mandate of UNHCR were considered.\n\n192. The Council of Europe has also made a contribution to the protection activities of this Office as described in chapter III, paragraph 59.\n\nC. Relations with the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration\n\n193. The close collaboration which has developed between the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration and UNHCR has been particularly fruitful in connexion with the resettlement of Hungarian refugees from Austria and Yugoslavia. In the course of 1957, the Committee moved some 97,602 refugees within the mandate of this Office, including 62,520 Hungarian refugees and 35,082 o"
