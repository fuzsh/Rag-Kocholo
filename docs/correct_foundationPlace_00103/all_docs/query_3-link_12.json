        "text": "🏡🌳 Building a sustainable community: Eurovia's L'Eau Vive eco-district in Lieusaint, France! Eurovia is transforming a former sugar refinery into a vibrant, sustainable community. Phase one brought homes, schools, and amenities to life. Now, phase two will add 515 new homes and an intergenerational residence. 🏠 Our teams from Entreprise Jean Lefebvre - Ile de France (Cannes-Ecluses) and FLAN TERRASSEMENT oversee essential infrastructure, ensuring the project's success while prioritizing biodiversity protection. 🚧 Recognized with the #ExcellenceEnvironmentLabel, Eurovia's initiatives enhance environmental sustainability, protect #biodiversity, and include 4,000 hours of job integration, to support those far from the labor market. 🏞 👷 We are thrilled that our international teams elevate urban living and champion sustainable development standards! 🌍 #VINCIConstruction #BuildBetterTogether\n\nTouchdown at Marseille Provence Airport! 🛬 Our subsidiaries GTM SUD and Travaux du Midi, with the support of Botte Fondations, Girard, and Soletanche Bachy, have successfully completed the renovation and expansion of Terminal 1 at Marseille Provence Airport. Recently, the airport also underwent a major upgrade of its Instrument Landing System (ILS), carried out by Eurovia's Port-de-Bouc agency in September 2023. This operation involved replacing outdated equipment and enhancing the system's overall efficiency. This project marks a significant milestone as France prepares to accommodate an increasing number of visitors, especially with the major events planned for this summer. Project highlights: 🏢 Improved facilities: The renovated terminal features upgraded check-in counters, expanded gate areas, and improved passenger flow systems to ensure a seamless and efficient travel experience. The civil engineering work for the new building was completed in September 2022. 🌱 Sustainability: The terminal now features state-of-the-art energy-efficient lighting and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems, using low-carbon concrete and recycled steel! The design is optimized for low energy consumption, all aimed at achieving the HQE™ Very High-Performance Sustainable Building certification. 🌍 Regional growth: By improving the airport's infrastructure, we are contributing to the economic development of the region and reinforcing its role as a gateway for international travelers exploring the South of France. At VINCI Construction, we are proud to be a world leader in our leadership in airport construction and renovation. These milestones underline our commitment to improving global connectivity and travel efficiency worldwide! ✈️ 👏 Congratulations to everyone involved in this project! #VINCIConstruction #BuildBetterTogether Métropole Aix-Marseille-Provence More information on this project: https://lnkd.in/gzdxr4-3\n\n🚆 All aboard: Copenhagen's Metro 4 Extension is now on track! Congratulations to VINCI Construction Grands Projets and our partners for successfully completing this project after 6 years. With two 4.4 km tunnels, five underground stations, and advanced electromechanical systems, this extension is key to the urban renewal of the Sydhavn district, increasing connectivity and accessibility for residents and businesses. 🏙️🌟 With a leap in daily capacity from 240,000 to 460,000 passengers, this project significantly reduces congestion, thus improving urban mobility and the sustainability of the transport network. 🌍 After working on the delivery of the Øresund Tunnel 24 years ago, and then the Femern Tunnel, it's an honor to continue improving the daily mobility of Danes! #VINCIConstruction #BuildBetterTogether\n\n🌍 Essentials 2024: Explore our key projects! It’s time to reflect on our recent achievements and top priorities in our efforts to build better together! This year, we've defined 10 pillars, each representing our commitment to #safety, #sustainability, and #expertise. Stay tuned as we dive deeper into each pillar in the coming weeks! In the meantime, catch a glimpse through the video below or discover our Essentials in the comments below. #VINCIConstruction #Essentials2024\n\n🚗 Driving sustainable innovation: Inductive charging pilot in Sindelfingen! Our subsidiary VIA IMC GmbH is excited to announce a major E|MPOWER project milestone: installing induction coils at a test site in Sindelfingen. This innovative initiative aims to implement a 1 km stretch of inductive charging on a highway in Northern Bavaria by October 2024. 🔧 Testing innovative solutions The test field at the asphalt plant will identify the best installation methods and ensure system functionality, paving the way for future advancements. 🚧 Revolutionizing road infrastructure EUROVIA Deutschland's Stuttgart branch will build the test site and the highway section. This project is a significant first in highway inductive charging! 🤝 Congratulations to our teams! Together, we are driving innovation and #BuildBetterTogether for a greener future.

The Lyon-Turin railway line, spanning nearly 270 km between France and Italy, is set to be a major axis of the TEN-T (Trans-European Transport Network) – the future \"European metro.\" This ambitious bi-national project, involving TELT Lyon Turin (jointly owned by the French and Italian states), Rete Ferroviaria Italiana for the Italian section, and Groupe SNCF for the French section, is a unique model of cross-border cooperation. 🇫🇷 🇮🇹 Congratulations to our teams from DODIN CAMPENON BERNARD, VINCI Construction Grands Projets who have almost completed the challenging underground work at the Puits D'Avrieux section, including 7 large caverns, 2.5 km of tunnels, and 4 vertical ventilation shafts. Here is an overview of the project: 🛤Connectivity: linking the Modane underground zone 500 meters below. 🧰Safety: ensuring proper tunnel ventilation. 🍃Environment: removing one million lorries from roads and cutting 3 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Last year, EUROVIA ALPES, CARRIERES DU BASSIN RHONALPIN, and Terélian also won a 10-year contract with TELT, to recycle more than 50% of the 23 million tonnes of material excavated on the French side of the Mont-Cenis base tunnel. You can find out more about this incredible project in the comments. #BuildBetterTogether #VINCIConstruction #TELT 💬 Let's shape the future of sustainable transport together!\n\n🏥 New health project in Poland! 🙏👏 Congratulations to our Warbud S.A.'s teams on securing the contract for the Silesian Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology! This seven-story, 7,370 m² facility is set to be completed by December 2025.
