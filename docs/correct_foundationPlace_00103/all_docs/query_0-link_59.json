        "text": "In the mid-1970s, approximately 70-80 apprentice trainers were employed in Sindelfingen (first in building 30, later in building 11). Amazingly, there were 8-10 believing Christians, all of whom came from evangelical congregations (Regional Church, Brüderbund, Hahn Community, Aidlinger Kreis, Baptists, Adventists and Methodists). Apparently, the head of department had deliberately hired people with a Christian background.\n\nSo it happened that at the same time as the activities in Untertürkheim, but completely independently of one another, a prayer initiative was also started in Sindelfingen Plant 50. From April 1979, 5-6 of the faithful trainers made it a habit to pray regularly for the concerns of the company. Since they did not want to meet secretly, they informed their department head who provided them with a room. Over time, more men and single women from the office area joined the prayer group. They met every Wednesday during lunch break. The men prayed primarily for their business concerns. Every now and then they also asked their boss about current prayer requests, which they then brought to God.\n\nThe group got on very well. Despite different church affiliations and characteristics, they had unity in prayer because they concentrated on the one thing, namely the belief in Jesus Christ. The friendly relationship between them was so good that the group sometimes even went on weekend events together.\n\nDue to elimination programs, the men of this group gradually retired. As a result, the company prayer group dissolved around 2009. However, due to their good relationship with each other, the men still come together every quarter for mutual exchange and prayer. Every year on January 6th, they also meet for celebrating a service, singing and going for a walk.\n\nShortly afterwards, Dr. Harry Tröster and Hans Pracht joined the prayer circle. Over time, the number of participants continued to increase. In total, 28 people took part on a permanent or occasion basis. A community was created which had developed a strengthening unity in faith. The informal ‚Du‘ instead of the formal ‚Sie‘ (German ‚you‘) soon came naturally, which was far from being common at that time.\n\nAt the end of November 1994, only the three friends Christoph Burckhardt, Adolf Graf and Hans Pracht met at the YMCA house. The blessed time of prayer circles at the YMCA in Untertürkheim came to an end, but the prayers continued at other locations!\n\nNote by Dirk Baader:\n\nAround the years 1984 and 1985, Dirk Baader, Christoph Burckhardt, Ekhard Moosbrugger, Dr. Harry Tröster and Dr. Günther Zoll also met at times on the second floor of the Untertürkheim plant’s training workshop. At that time, the training workshop had a separate entrance directly to the right in front of the ‘Cannstatter Tor’.\n\nMartin Strauß (Dipl.-Kaufmann in the IT area) confessed his Christian faith during his whole working life. It was important to him that people get to know Jesus Christ and may be saved. From 1992 he also participated in the prayer group at Möhringen.\n\nIn 2004 he initiated an Alpha course (Christian foundation course) in the cafeteria in Möhringen. This course taking place at the end of the working day was attended by three people from his immediate professional environment.\n\nAfter two colleagues had found to the faith in Jesus Christ, Martin Strauß arranged a Christian faith course called ‘The Purpose Driven Life’ from October 2006 to June 2007. The objective was to encourage and strengthen the faith of the newly converted participants. The course took place weekly or fortnightly at the end of the working day in his room in Möhringen. The 40 units of the eponymous book by Rick Warren served as the basis for the course.\n\nFrom mid-2007 to mid-2011, Martin Strauß worked at the Esslingen-Pliensauvorstadt site in the ‘Roser’ building, where he started a prayer group (see section ‘Prayer groups in Esslingen-Pliensauvorstadt’). In mid-2011, he returned to the Möhringen site. There, in the first half of 2013, he offered a basic faith course on a biweekly basis. This course titled ‘Spur 8 – Entdeckungen im Land des Glaubens’ was attended by four to five non-church-oriented people. The course took place after work from 5 to 6 pm in a meeting room.\n\nFrom September 2013 to April 2014, Martin Strauß offered a second basic faith course ‘Spur 8’ in Möhringen.\n\nThis course, which also took place biweekly at the end of the working day, was attended by three interested persons. Martin continued this course until the end of April 2014, although he had already completed the active phase of his partial retirement at the end of January 2014.\n\nOne participant provided the following feedback:\n\n“I got a glimpse of the bible and again found access to the theme of ‘God and the Bible‘. The highlight was the story of the lost son. I got a better understanding of biblical topics. I also read the Bible again and can understand better how things relate. I thought the seminar was very good.“\n\nThrough his courses and testimonies of his Christian faith, over the years Martin Strauß has been in friendly contact with many colleagues. From the mid-nineties (usually on a weekly basis over about 10 years) he sent a so-called ‘Occasional Mail’ to those who were interested. It contained interesting short stories (for example by Axel Kühner), watchwords (also with short explanations), good Christian quotes and poems, prayers, psalms and tips (references to Christian books, broadcasters (ERF), holiday courses, etc.). On birthdays he also sent personal biblical words of blessing or presented a good Christian book.\n\nSince 2004, Martin Strauß also provides some of his colleagues with sermons that he gives as a predicant on a voluntary basis in his church. This is gladly accepted until today.\n\nIn December 2018 Ellen Christen, working at the Stuttgart-Fasanenhof site (municipality Möhringen), was approached by a colleague about the Christian faith. The two agreed to meet for mutual exchange and prayer in the New Year. Independent of this conversation, in January 2019, another Christian colleague joined Ellen. Through the website ‘Christians at Daimler’ he had found out that she was looking for fellow persons of prayer in order to initiate a prayer group at her site. In the same month, the three met for lunch together. They decided to meet regularly whenever possible to pray together at their location at Schelmenwasenstraße 39.\n\nIn the beginning of 2019 this group came up with the idea to install prayer groups across different Daimler locations, in which Christians of the same subject areas are summarized. These groups could exchange views and prayer requests for example via a Threema group and pray together for subjects relating their special working field.\n\nDuring the Corona pandemic, the prayer group at Schelmenwasen disbanded. Ellen Christen then joined Carsten Becher’s prayer group, which she had already attended during the time when it was still led by Markus Kleppe.\n\nCompletely independent of the activities in the Untertürkheim YMCA house, in the Möhringen headquarters, in Waiblingen and in Oberesslingen, in autumn 1992, some Christians from the Untertürkheim plant took the initiative to point to a Christian community outside working hours by advertising this in the company’s own educational program. This led to the fact that further Christians came forward to participate. At the beginning of 1993, the first prayer circle was founded in office facilities of the site in Untertürkheim. This circle met weekly for more than 30 years, starting before working hours at 6:45, under the leadership of Ekkehard K. and Wilfried O. in building 136. The colleagues Christoph Burckhardt and Hans Pracht of the former YMCA prayer circle joined the group after their circle was dissolved. Other persons who had beed previously attending the YMCA meetings were also present there. Adolf Graf, who had meanwhile taken early retirement, did not carry out this change.\n\nDue to the move of Ekkehard K. into the passive phase of partial retirement, the prayer group dissolved at the end of June 2023. Wilfried O. joined another prayer group in Untertürkheim.\n\nChantalle Wagne was a faithful member of a prayer circle in Möhringen until mid-2013. In 2013, she took over the new ‘Personnel Planning & Reporting’ function in the Human Resources Management, which required a move from Möhringen to Untertürkheim. In the immediate vicinity of her new location she could only find a prayer group that met in the early morning from 6:00 am to 7:15 am. Since this time was not suitable for her, she decided to initiate another prayer group in Untertürkheim at noon as soon as she was familiar with her new role.\n\nThis new prayer circle was first held on August 6, 2013. Since then, it has been attended weekly by 8 to 14 participants. The possibility of a recurring booking of a meeting room in the premises of the Works Council greatly simplified the organization.\n\nChantalle shared the following encouraging incident from her prayer circle:\n\n“In addition to many answers to prayers in business-related concerns, recoveries from illnesses and also in family matters, I can report on a project that had to be stopped because nobody knew how to get further (details of the project not intended for publication). Two members of the prayer group were involved in this project and brought the request into the prayer circle. We prayed for a few weeks for this issue until one day the solution to the problems appeared to one of the colleagues involved in a nightly dream. He was shown by the Lord exactly how to proceed. The colleague reported on this in the prayer circle before he submitted the solution to his supervisor. However, he didn’t know whether he should inform his supervisor about the fact that the solution was not from him but rather from the Lord in a dream. I encouraged him to inform his boss about the background and he did so. His rather skeptical superior allowed the solution to be tried out since there was no other options left for him. Implemented exactly as shown in the dream, the solution worked out well, i.e. the problems encountered were all solved. The solution even got patented. The colleague has since been able and allowed to report to many people about it.”\n\nChantalle Wagne led this prayer circle until shortly before she left the company on March 31, 2021. In February 2021, there was a baton handover to Gudrun Böhringer from the Controlling area, who shares the leadership with Hans-Martin Schimpf from the Production Planning. Both were previously longstanding members of Chantalle’s circle.\n\nVolker von Rad worked as an engineer for the development of air conditioning systems for passenger cars at the Mercedes Technology Center (MTC) in Sindelfingen until 2016, where he took part regularly in the prayer circle in building 50/1. In 2016, he moved to the Truck sector in Untertürkheim, where he was again responsible for the development of air conditioning systems, but for trucks. In 2016, together with David Hewitt (Transport Logistics at the Untertürkheim plant), who also came from Sindelfingen in 2012 and led a prayer circle there on the Sindelfingen production site (see below), he initiated another prayer circle in building 119 in level 4. Unlike the other prayer circle in building 119 (see above), this circle meets during lunch break.\n\nVolker von Rad left the company at the end of 2017, whereupon David Hewitt and Jürgen Pfrommer (Testing and Materials Technology) took over the management. From summer to the end of 2018, the circle rested, as Jürgen Pfrommer had to undertake many business trips to Hungary. Since early 2019, the circle meets again weekly at lunchtime. Due to a change of location of David Hewitt and lack of availability of Jürgen Pfrommer, from April 2019 the circle was managed by Matthias Hahn. Since the revival of this group, it enjoyed further growth.\n\nMatthias Hahn was employed by the company AKKA, but during this phase he worked for Daimler as a temporary employee. In mid-2020, his temporary employment contract was changed into a work contract, which is why he transferred the leadership of the circle to Felix Reisgys in June.\n\nAround the year 1998 there was a group of Christians in the building 46 of the production plant in Sindelfingen (plant 50), who met regularly during the breaks. There was a lot of prayer for each other. All this had been initiated by Sonja K., a burning Christian lady, who testified everywhere to Jesus. Some people decided to live with Jesus there. Helmut Essig also joined these Christians, who were of different ecclesiastical origin.\n\nDuring these meetings Helmut Essig met his colleague Fritz Hartleb. Around the year 1999, these two men decided to regularly pray for the company and its employees by walking across the factory premises between the production halls during their lunch break. Sonja K. left the company around this time.\n\nIn 2004, David Hewitt, together with Christoph Meier, took over the direction of this open-air prayer circle and coordinated the weekly meetings for eight years.\n\nWhen David Hewitt moved to Untertürkheim in 2012, the management went to Christoph Eisele (Asset Accounting), who coordinated this circle for another 6 years. Since Christoph Eisele’s workplace was relocated to Schlosshofstraße in October 2018, Helmut Essig has been responsible for the open-air prayer group since that time.\n\nOver the years, new people kept coming and praying for the company and the people working in it. It is very encouraging to see in retrospect what God has done great.\n\nHelmut Essig retired on November 30, 2022. In his farewell message he wrote: ‘Especially valuable are the relationships with Christians at Daimler over all these years. It is so precious to pray together and to stand up for so many things in prayer. The company prayer is a wonderful thing.’\n\nSince there were some participants who preferred a prayer time in the morning before work began, Helmut Keller founded an additional early prayer circle in 2004, which meets every Thursday at 7:00 am in building 50/1 in the same meeting room as the Monday circle.\n\nBoth, the Monday and the Thursday prayer group, were headed by Helmut Keller until the end of his active time at Daimler in August 2017. Due to the many positive experiences over the years and the impressing answers to prayer that the participants were able to witness there, it was easy to find suitable successors, who took over the lead of the two groups with joy and plenty of initiative. Thus, since September 2017, the Monday group has been passed on by Hannes Ackermann and the Thursday group by Reiner Maul. In particular, the Monday circle enjoyed lively participation at times and continued to grow in the time before Corona.\n\nOn October 1, 2022, Hannes Ackermann moved to the VAN division. Since then, the Monday circle has been coordinated by Marcel Mast.\n\nRüdiger Steinberg (at that time team leader of ‘Overall Vehicle Concept C-class’) has long been concerned about giving space to God and Christian values in his working environment. Therefore, in the beginning of 2005, he founded a prayer circle in level 4 of building 26. The fact that another prayer circle took place in the same building on the same day of the week – and also at the same time of day – became known only in 2006 on the occasion of the first Daimler Christian Meeting, where all existing Daimler prayer groups were presented. After a subsequent exchange with Benjamin Orschel, the then leader of the parallel prayer circle, they decided to keep the place and time of the two prayer circles as they were. Therefore, for many years there were two prayer circles in building 26, which took place on the same day of the week during the lunch break. With the outbreak of Corona, they were forced to organize the prayer circles via virtual meetings from the home office.\n\nAt the end of November 2021, Rüdiger Steinberg moved into passive semi-retirement. The participants of his circle joined the prayer circle led by Johannes Weiss, which took place at the same time (see previous section).\n\nIn October 2018, the working place of Christoph Eisele was moved into the project center for ‘Buildings and Interior Construction’ of the plant 59. This required a relocation from plant 50 to Schosshofstraße. Interestingly, there, he received a seating position next to a colleague who is at the same time a pastor on a voluntary basis in Rastatt. Together with another colleage, whom Christoph Eisele knows from his church, they met there for regular prayer from the end of 2018 until July 2022. During the Corona pandemic, the prayer meetings took place virtually.\n\nAt 66 years of age and nearly 49 years with the ‘good star’, Christoph Eisele said goodbye to his well-deserved retirement in July 2022. In addition to his many tasks in plant accounting, his mandate as union shop steward and as a member of the shop stewards’ committee, he led various prayer groups in plants 50 and 59 for many years. As he announced at his farewell, he wants to continue praying for the company and possibly join a retiree prayer group.\n\nEven after Christoph’s departure, the two prayer group members Alessandro L. R. and Levi D. continue to meet for prayer. Alessandro agreed to take over the lead from Christoph Eisele. He is looking forward to more fellow prayers.\n\nIn order to better address the needs of young colleagues – especially when working part-time and/or with children – Johannes Weiss founded another prayer circle in December 2021. Since many young colleagues are already fully occupied with family tasks before they start work and are already on their way to daycare or similar at the classic prayer circle time of 12 o’clock, the time was set at 8:30 o’clock. And since most of them work in home offices and organize their own working hours, participation at this early hour is not a problem. The prayer time is of course excluded from the reported working time.\n\nSeveral young participants reported back that they are very happy to have found a prayer circle with younger people. It is a prayer requestthat more prayer circles for younger people will emerge. It is absolutely understandable that a young professional does not necessarily have the same concerns as an older colleague.\n\nAnyone interested is welcome to participate in this prayer circle that takes place in MS teams (please send an email to info@christentreffen.de).\n\nHans-Georg Osswald joined Daimler in 2000 in the area ‘Global Service & Parts’ in Esslingen-Brühl, Palmenwaldstraße. Even then, some Daimler employees and colleagues from service companies met there every now and again to pray – either in a basement of the underground car park or in a workshop room. One day in 2000, Hans-Georg Osswald discovered a Christian (Kawohl) calendar on a colleague’s desk. He asked this colleague if there was a prayer circle in Esslingen-Brühl. The colleague affirmed and named him a few colleagues from the neighboring department, who would also take part in the prayer circle from time to time and to whom he would like to approach. Then he became a member of this prayer circle in Brühl and was grateful to have found brothers and sisters in faith at his location on the spot.\n\nThis prayer circle was at that time a relatively loose union. Many participants were often temporarily unable to attend and therefore took part only sporadically. So it happened that the prayer circle took place less and less over time. Around 2003, the members agreed to stop the prayer circle due to the many failures and the increasingly sparse participation.\n\nAround the year 2006, a new Daimler employee joined the department ‘After-Sales Diagnostics’ for passenger cars at Brühl. Since she was a dedicated Christian she inquired about a local prayer circle, and in 2007 she called the ‘decommissioned’ prayer circle back to life – using the catchy acronym ‘BAG’, which stands for ‘Bibel – Austausch – Gebet’ (Bible – Exchange – Prayer).\n\nWhen this colleague changed to Research & Development some time later (about 2007/2008), the question of the successor had to be clarified. The team leader of Hans-Georg Osswald, who was also a Christian and often participated in the prayer circle, asked Hans-Georg Osswald whether he would take over the role of head or organizer of the BAG meetings. Since then, this circle has been coordinated by him. Every week, Hans-Georg Osswald invites to the BAG prayer meetings by e-mail. As an entry into the prayer meetings usually a devotion for the day is shared, for example from https://unsertaeglichbrot.org/, https://www.gute-saat.de/ or http://faithfood.ch/.\n\nAt the beginning of 2009, the various departments of GSP/TD were cumulated in the Smart area at the Böblingen site. Thus, a large part of the Brühl prayer circle moved to Böblingen. The other part of the prayer circle remained in Brühl. Dieter Backhaus (Education System) took over the leadership until his entry into the passive part-time phase of partial retirement in December 2012. Thereafter, the circle was continued by Claudia D. for about one more year. Due to a change of job, however, this residual circle dissolved in 2013, while the circle moved to Böblingen meets weekly in the Smart area until today.\n\nAbout 2004/2005 I noticed another colleague at the sink, because he always beamed at me so friendly. I watched him for some time and thought to myself, ‘Either this colleague is “interested in me” or he is a Christian.’ The latter was true. After a short while, I realized that he, too, was a devout Christian. A close friendship developed with this colleague. Except during business break times, we often met at 5:00 am in the morning before the morning shift, to start the day with a morning prayer walk in the wild on the fields. Then we drove to work together.\n\nWhen I talked to another colleague in the bathroom when washing my hands, he said: ‘My grandma said everyone had to wear his cross’. When I answered, ‘For me the cross bore another,’ he said, ‘Oh, you are one of those, too!’ So we both recognized that we were followers of Jesus.\n\nInterestingly, even a Muslim colleague once provided me a colleague who believed in Jesus and worked with him on the same shift. Since the Muslim colleague knew about my faith, he referred to his colleagues to me with the words, ‘This is also someone like you’. Also to this colleague a close friendship developed.\n\nUntil the middle of 2008 Martin Moser and Reinhold Schneckenburger (Advanced Development within the area ‘Brake, Assistance and Suspension Systems’) were faithful participants of the prayer circle in the MTC, building 50/1. In September 2008, they moved to Böblingen as members of the Pre-Development department at Hanns-Klemm-Straße 45. Because they did not want to give up the weekly corporate prayer at their new location, they initiated their own new prayer circle. This circle existed until Martin Moser was transferred back to the MTC in May 2017 in the department ‘Parking and Camera Systems’.\n\nThe following anecdote can be found in this prayer circle:\n\n“The neighbor team had a trainee from South Korea. He could speak some German and good English, but he could only pray in his mother tongue. The jump from English to Korean has always been a bit funny, of course we have understood nothing. But through the Spirit of God we still shared in his prayer.”\n\n“My colleague’s son was hospitalized with facial paralysis. The colleague (father of the child) called desperately to me because nobody knew how it would go on with the child. I said to him, ‘Come on, we pray at our workplace – or better yet – we visit him in the hospital and pray there.’ He agreed.\n\nArriving at the hospital, the colleague opened the door to the hospital room, but immediately closed it again, because the night before two Muslim children were hospitalized in the room, whose mothers were sitting by the bed. Finally he went in and asked his son, ‘Shall Markus pray for you?’ The boy said yes. I called out loud to Jesus and asked for full restoration of the son. After that we went back to work. After about an hour, the son called and said, ‘I’m going to be released from the hospital.’ ”\n\nThe motivation to set up a prayer circle in Bremen had been brought by Wolfgang Marquaß, team leader ‘Tool Introduction and Testing Technology’, from the Hamburg plant in 2008. Already around the year 1998 there existed a small prayer circle, consisting of an E2 leader, two other colleagues and himself. His desire was to take this important mission with him to his new place of work.\n\nHe got in touch with other Christians because his then landlord in Bremen, who was a faithful man of prayer in his church, asked in a church service whether there were church members who work for Daimler and would be interested in a prayer circle. As a result, the first contacts were made at the Bremen plant in 2010.\n\nFrom the 2nd or 3rd hand, Wolfgang Marquaß learned that around the year 2010 there must have been one or more other prayer groups at the Bremen plant that regularly met in the production as shift prayer groups. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to establish direct contact with the colleagues of these circles.\n\nIn October 2018 Wolfgang Marquaß changed the job within the production equipment in a related field of responsibility. Since then, they have been meeting in a room assigned to his team.\n\nOn March 1, 2023, Wolfgang Marquaß switched from active to passive semi-retirement. As early as November 2022, he therefore handed over the leadership of the Bremen prayer group to his colleague Markus Häveker. Thus, the prayers at the Bremen plant could continue seamlessly.\n\nAccording to a statement by Wolfgang Marquaß in January 2019, it is very encouraging for the prayer group that a faithful participant named Axel G. still regularly participates in the company prayer circle, although he is already in semi-retirement for almost three years and has a journey of 50 km to the plant. Asked to Axel G. what was the reason for him to take the long route to the weekly corporate prayer circles, he replied: “I believe God is paying great attention to these little prayer rounds because they do what he wants. The bible says, ‘All your worries throw on him, because he cares for you.’ And another thing is very important to me: When it comes to admiring one or the other, that’s just our Lord Jesus, because he is and was very patient with me. He has often carried me through and he has given me great pleasure by entrusting my wife Angelika to me.”\n\nDavid Reeves has been working at the Tuscaloosa plant of MBUSI (Alabama/USA) as an Assembly Process Engineer since 2008 and as an Assembly Group Leader. He was encouraged from his church, Church of the Highlands, Birmingham (Alabama), to lead men in developing their faith deeper with Christ simply wherever God would place him. So for him, it was natural to start at work.\n\nIn January 2014 he started leading a Men’s Small Group, similar to the Bible Study group of Joseph Cox, that met weekly during lunch breaks since 2013 (see above). There they studied different topics, usually focused on leadership skills that are based on Biblical lessons. They also had one or two semesters focused on being stronger Men of God. The group had varied in size, usually around 10 men.\n\nThrough an email campaign initiated by a former colleague, the men’s group also distributed important prayer requests throughout the organization. One focus of this email campaign was to pray for the management to be influenced by the Holy Spirit in making the best and wisest decisions possible. Quote from David: “We have seen change for the better here since we started the prayers, and we believe God has played a part in that.”\n\nOn the occasion of the Daimler Christian Meeting in 2017 David Reeves was hooked-up by a live-connection over the internet (see photo).\n\nDavid Reeves spoke the following words to the German audience:\n\n„I would like to encourage everyone in this Daimler Christian Meeting to keep their faith in Christ strong! Jesus desires a personal relationship with you, and your simple answer is just to live for Him. All of my joy comes from knowing Jesus – not from my job, not from my hobbies, or anything that the world offers. If I trust in this world, I know that I will be disappointed. I know that Jesus will never let me down and that I can place all trust in Him. Please live your faith out daily at work! The Lord will give you a positive spirit and joy that you have never experienced. Remember to follow what Colossians 3:23 says: ‚Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not human masters.‘ Bring glory to God by how you conduct yourself at work. I also encourage you to pray for your leaders. Our structure for each person here is to pray daily for his/her Manager (E4), Senior Manager (E3), Vice President (E2), and President (E1).“\n\nTo the question of what a testimony or an experience with the Men’s Group would be, David answered:\n\n‘I would say the best testimony from leading my group is actually from myself: I have learned so much from the other men about being a better husband and father, when to put work behind my family (which is always tough for me), and deepening my faith with Jesus.’\n\nIn the year 2017 David Reeves was promoted to a manager of a new team called ‚Assembly Introduction‘.\n\nAfter completing a two-year master’s degree alongside his job as an assembly supervisor, David Reeves left the company in September 2022 and moved into the biomedical field.\n\nThere has also existed a prayer circle at the ‘Daimler Trucks North America Headquarters’ in Portland (Oregon / USA) for years. Volker Fliehmann, a former employee from the Truck sector in Untertürkheim, was able to get to know this circle during a stay abroad in 2014.\n\nIn April 2023, colleagues from DTNA in Portland shared the information that approximately 5-10 fellow Christians meet once a month for lunch together. The invitation is by word of mouth. The main contact for these meetings is Clint Everett.\n\nIn addition, Matthew Cummins leads a morning Bible study. A new feature is a short prayer time afterwards (in presence or virtually via MS Teams).\n\nThe vision of colleagues in Portland is not necessarily to organize more formal activities or meetings, as they hope people will connect with their home churches to fellowship and grow on a regular basis. Rather, they want to create a connecting point/hub so that relationships can be formed and deepened, and believers can organically support each other in various needs (e.g., mentorship, friendship, prayer, church recommendations).\n\nJoy Jacintha Selvaraj, a young Christian lady with Indian nationality, was working from February 2015 to April 2018 at Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation in Kanagawa, Japan, which is a part of Daimler Trucks. She was working initially in Human Resources and later in the Customer Services department. In January 2019 she gave a short review of her journey at Fuso:\n\n“During one of my business trips to Stuttgart through the guidance from a mutual friend in Christ I was blessed with the opportunity to meet with Dr. Helmut Keller. I was introduced to ‘Christians at Daimler’ and very soon I was welcomed into a prayer group that was active at Untertürkheim. After I had returned back to Japan I was motivated to always be open and trust that God will lead me to more believers at Fuso with whom I can build a community to share prayer requests and also to pray for the company.\n\nAfter I had returned from my business trip to Stuttgart in the year 2016 I met Anna, another Christian lady who had been working at Fuso longer than me. It was a blessing to know her as a colleague and sister in faith and to have fellowship with her whenever she returned to Tokyo after her frequent business trips to Taiwan.\n\nI was really amazed when I was seeking to connect with more Christians at work God had shown me two other Christians who were from India and working in Tokyo and I was really happy to invite them to lunch/dinner fellowship after work.”\n\nThrough his cooperation with the Indian colleagues of MBRDI (Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India) in Bangalore, Eberhard B., a member of a Sindelfingen prayer circle, got to know the Indian Christian Liz Stanley. Impressed by her deep faith and the fact that even more Christians are employed at MBRDI in Bangalore, he told her about the existing prayer circles at Daimler and motivated her to start a prayer circle in Banaglore as well.\n\nOn December 15, 2017, he made the joyful announcement that Liz Stanley had founded a prayer group in Bangalore in early December 2017, in which they meet four of them. Since Eberhard B. was on site at MBRDI right at the time, he was able to witness the first meeting live. In the absence of a vacant meeting room, the Indian colleagues met in the anteroom of a staircase.\n\nSince in November 2018 Liz was in Sindelfingen for three weeks, she was able to attend the 13th Daimler Christian Meeting in Weinstadt-Beutelsbach and make an active contribution there.\n\nLiz Stanley led the prayer circle in Bangalore until February 2020. In September 2021, Victor Xavier took over the coordination of the circle.\n\nJacintha Nazareth, a young employee of Mercedes-Benz Bank in Stuttgart-Feuerbach of Indian origin, was a participant of the 14th Daimler Christian Meeting on November 16, 2019. Here she learned about the prayer group existing at Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India in Bangalore.\n\nOn November 26, Helmut Keller established contact between Liz Stanley (Bangalore), Joy Selvaraj (Chennai, formerly employed by Mitsubishi Fuso Truck & Bus Corporation, Japan) and Jacintha Nazareth (Germany).\n\nA first telephone exchange between the Indian colleagues then took place on February 11, 2020, and since that date, telephone exchanges have taken place every week, sharing current concerns and bringing them before God. Soon this prayer group, organized via telephone or Skype, had grown to include two more Indian Daimler colleagues from Bangalore and a colleague from Mercedes-Benz Taiwan in Taipei.\n\nFor the 15th Daimler Christian Meeting in 2020, Suchin Aranha, Liz Stanley, Sam Arnold, Jacintha Nazareth, and Joy Selvaraj created an encouraging short video clip that was played to attendees on site. In addition, the prayer group was connected live to the on-site participants via an internet connection.\n\nThe Asian prayer circle was coordinated and facilitated by Joy Selvaraj from Chennai until spring 2022. Since July 2022, she has been married and lives with her husband in Canada.\n\nOn January 7, 2020, 5 colleagues from Mercedes-Benz Argentina, Buenos Aires, including Ivana Bazán, Manager of Controlling Vans Argentina, and Emily Torres, accounts receivable management, registered for the “Christians at Daimler” network on the website.\n\nWhen asked how they became aware of the network, Emily and Ivana said that they had learned about the network through their colleague Muriel Marrugo, who worked in Stuttgart and who attended the Daimler Christian Meeting in November 2019. They were delighted to hear that Daimler incorporates Christian standards as corporate values. There would be no Christian prayer groups in Buenos Aires so far, but they would consider it as important to set up such a circle.\n\nOn February 14, 2020, Ivana announced that, despite the current summer break, she had started a two-week prayer meeting at the Buenos Aires location and that she was very happy about it. Their WhatsApp group already consisted of 7 people.\n\nIt has long been known that in the truck production area of Mercedes-Benz do Brasil (MBBRAS) in São Bernardo do Campo (São Paulo state) there were some groups of believing employees who meet during their breaks for regular prayer. Unfortunately, the network ‘Christians at Daimler’ did not have any contacts to these Christians until 2020.\n\nBesides that, a few years earlier Christians from the senior management met for lunch with the aim of starting a prayer group. Although the project was approved by everyone involved, the idea could not be implemented successfully.\n\nIn May 2020, Chantalle Wagne drew attention to a believing colleague from MBBRAS named Luciano Emidio, whose contact she still had in her mailing list of the Untertürkheimer prayer groups. Luciano Emidio was employed at the Untertürkheim plant from April 2008 to November 2013 and regularly took part in a Untertürkheim prayer group on Tuesday mornings.\n\nAfter contacting him again by email, on June 2, 2020 Luciano Emidio took the initiative to invite the known Christians to regular prayer meetings at his location. The response was positive. The first online prayer at MBBRAS took place on June 17, 2020 with participants from São Bernardo do Campo and Campinas. They meet on a weekly basis via phone or Skype."
