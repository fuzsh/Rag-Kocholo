        "text": "The “centenary concrete” is currently used for almost any building, especially in combination with reinforced iron. In addition to natural aging (the so-called carbonation), it is mainly environmental influences (static overloads or salt spreading) that cause damage to the concrete and the reinforcement.\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of a building, prompt and professional maintenance of the concrete is therefore necessary. The old concrete must be removed so that the old iron reinforcement is free and cleaned of corrosion, in order to be able to apply a new corrosion proof protection. A new concrete cover layer and a special coating can then be then applied. The advantage in removing damaged concrete by high pressure water jets is a vibration-free process, which avoids tension cracks. At the same time, the reinforcements themselves are cleaned and freed from corrosion. The restoration is carried out with robots or with manual lances. The partial removal of damaged concrete is performed with a jet of water up to 3000bar and up to 400 liters / min, using special robots or manual lances.\n\nAdvantages\n\n• Absence of secondary damage such as. new micro-cracks\n\n• The very high-pressure water jet does not generate vibrations, to such an extent that it does not induce tension cracks, nor an extension of the noise induced in the structure\n\n• The resulting surface is rough and ideal for proper adhesion of the new concrete\n\n• Deteriorated concrete is removed more easily due to its reduced resistance to pressure. In this way, selective removal is possible\n\n• Complete conservation of the existing reinforcement\n\n• Effective cleaning of corroded reinforced structures\n\n• Solvent action on the chloride of the high pressure jet\n\n• Increase in grip values"
