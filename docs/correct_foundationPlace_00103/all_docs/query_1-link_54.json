The Biennale will host creative artistic entities from around 30 countries, cities, and institutions. These exhibitions will not only resonate with the Pansori soundscape of the 21st century but will also create a rich tapestry of sights and discourse by showcasing diverse perspectives.\n\nFind out more here\n\nUgo Rondinone will be awarded the 15th Robert Jacobsen Prize of the Stiftung Würth. The award ceremony will take place on September 5, 2024, at 7 pm in the Carmen Würth Forum in Künzelsau, Germany. This is also the opening of his presentation solar spirit at Museum Würth 2 and in the Sculpture Garden, which will be on display from September 6, 2024 to March 23, 2025.\n\nRegister for the Award Ceremony here\n\nGalerie Eva Presenhuber is proud to announce the representation of Vienna-based artist Liesl Raff. Liesl Raff's sculptures explore the nuances of physical and social interactions through a profound appreciation of diverse materials and persistent experimentation. Her work features a semiotics of materials that begins where words fail. Recently, she has used natural rubber to showcase its adaptable and shape-shifting properties. Standing near or within Raff's pieces, you experience a transition into a warm, cozy, and calm state, feeling a sense of dependability and safety. Her sculptures integrate seamlessly with their surroundings, promoting contact and interaction.\n\nFind out more about the artist here.\n\nJosh Smith is a multi-talented artist: he is not just a painter. Since the pandemic, he has appeared on Instagram as an ambassador for the art world. He also hosts a regular series on YouTube called \"Studio News\". During the broadcasts, he sometimes talks about his artistic creative process - in some editions, he simply remains silent. Now Smith is presenting a series of 16 new canvases with his first eponymous exhibition in Vienna.\n\nRead on PARNASS\n\nLouisa Gagliardi captivates collectors with her unique paintings that explore the tension between online and real-life existence. Her works feature slick, serene yet uneasy scenes with avatars that evoke a sense of ennui. Using a laborious digital process, she prints sketches on glossy PVC surfaces, creating a surreal, sci-fi allure. Gagliardi's background in graphic design influences her industrial technique, and her works reflect themes of hyperconnectivity and isolation. Influenced by artists like Fernand Léger, her art combines reflections and trompe l'oeil effects, aiming to immerse viewers in otherworldly, dream-like realms.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nDrawing from nuanced forms of joy, Black artists, whether residing in Africa or within the vast African diaspora, have pursued a spectrum of visual vocabularies that encompass the experiences of Blackness – of being Black; of living within Black cultures and navigating the complexities of representation and visibility. In doing so, they have intentionally explored the poetics of Blackness in a way that subverts reductive tropes. They explore Black subjectivity and Black consciousness through figurative painting as part of a historical continuum. Join curator Koyo Kouoh as she discusses these vocabularies and histories – surveyed and celebrated in the exhibition When We See Us, A Century of Black Figuration in Painting, currently on show at Kunstmuseum Basel – with artists Kudzanai-Violet Hwami and Tschabalala Self.\n\nWatch the artist talk here\n\nBorn and raised in Harlem, New York, Tschabalala Self (b. 1990) pushes the traditional boundaries of painting with her innovative use of pigments, textiles and printmaking methods. Infusing her work with her experiences as a Black American woman, Self deconstructs and reimagines Western portrayals of the Black body. In the video, Self discusses her artistic practice and her solo exhibition, Around the Way, which opened at EMMA in May 2024. The colourful displays in the exhibition evoke the metropolitan landscapes of Harlem and the atmosphere of its domestic interiors. Tschabalala Self is the seventh artist to join InCollection series of exhibitions co-produced by EMMA and Saastamoinen Foundation.\n\nWatch the video here\n\n\"The plants in Shara Hughes’s mind-bending paintings export the viewer far from reality. The American artist’s forms seem to be plundered from the depths of her imagination. Towering trees are depicted in spidery strokes of yellow, green and orange (Wits End (2024)), or with vibrant, fluffy blue dots embellishing their branches (What Nerve (2024)). Her works are often so loaded with energetic marks and organic forms that the background and foreground converge, leading to a rich tangle of dynamic visual material.\"\n\nRead the full article on Artnet\n\nShara Hughes is an American painter based in Brooklyn, and is known for her lush, vibrant, imaginative landscapes. These do not root in any outside reference, but rather in her exploration of shape, form and light. The narrative in her work is subtle; it is open to interpretation, but ultimately deals with the nature of her actions, reactions and emotions. Hughes calls her mostly large and vertical canvases invented or psychological landscapes – offering a colorful, kaleidoscopic vision of a painter’s interior.\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nPremiering in Zurich this week at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Tobias Pils: Happy Days marks the seventh solo show the artist has had with the gallery and presents a new body of work that highlights his signature style. On view June 7–July 20, 2024, the exhibition is comprised of two large-scale triptychs, a suite of eight paintings, and a bronze sculpture.\n\nRead the article here\n\n\"Doug Aitken is an American artist known for installations that span a wide spectrum of media and genres; they may include video, print media, photography, sculpture, sound, and performance. Aitken wants to make the traditional definition of art more accessible to a much more comprehensive and connecting meaning. The viewer is invited to move through his large-scale works, either by walking around huge screens, stepping on a train, or even swimming through mirrored sculptures – to name but a few of his immersive projects.\"\n\nRead the interview here.\n\nFresh out of the shower from Vienna, Josh Smith introduces his solo exhibition Studio News (24 May–20 July 2024). Fish, palm trees, and the Grim Reaper ('I mean that was a really bad one') have all graced the New Yorker's gestural and colour-rich canvases over his 20-year career. This time, it's bats: 'They're like birds, just way cooler.'\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nFor their second instalment of ReCollect! at the Kunsthaus Zürich, Oslo based artists Matias Faldbakken and Ida Ekblad have hung one of their favourite works from the collection, Francis Picabia’s Cure-dents (Toothpicks, c. 1924), opposite four painted bronze sculptures by Ekblad. Faldbakken has then ‘measured’ the distance between Picabia and Ekblad using a VHS-copy of the 1983 splatter film1 Stage Fright. The second installation is on view in the Chipperfield building of the Kunsthaus.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nAmidst a world rapidly changing under the weight of climate change, the exhibition I Feel the Earth Whisper at Museum Frieder Burda invites us to contemplate the fragile beauty of the natural world and our profound interconnectedness with it. Through the installations of Bianca Bondi, Julian Charrière, Sam Falls and Ernesto Neto – including sculpture, painting, video and photography – the show curated by Patricia Kamp and Jérôme Sans, invites us to reflect upon our relationship with the forests and unique ecosystems of the planet, and to rekindle our historically rooted role as guardians of these vibrant living spaces.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nNick Byrne from King Kong Magazine interviewed Torbjørn Rødland, whose photographic works are a moveable feast for the eyes. The subject matter is caught in the moment, but starts to alter in the imagination. Changing and warping, sneakily shapeshifting, his photographs give the illusion of reality, when in fact the realism of the images are just a shudder away from the surreal.\n\nRead the interview here.\n\nThe High Line's Moynihan Connector Billboard features Loosie in the Park (2019) and Patience (2022) by Tschabalala Self. Loosie portrays a Black woman in a Harlem park, smoking a single cigarette (\"loosie\"), reflecting on bodegas' cultural significance in Black and Latino communities. Meanwhile, Patience depicts a Black woman blending into her domestic setting, exploring themes of home and gendered labor. Both artworks encapsulate Self's exploration of community pillars like bodegas and the psychological dimensions of domesticity, respectively, showcasing her distinctive style and thematic depth in capturing Black female experiences.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nIt's snowing, the sun is setting, a storm is brewing – Ugo Rondinone's expansive exhibition cry me a river at Kunstmuseum Luzern invites viewers to immerse themselves in both his art and the elements. At the heart of the artist's work is the overwhelming beauty of the landscape and the power of nature. Rondinone, who lives in New York, grew up in Brunnen on Lake Lucerne and is now returning to his home country to present a major retrospective.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nAround the Way features multi-material paintings and sculptures by Tschabalala Self, whose works will together form colourful spatial displays in EMMA’s concrete-dominated exhibition space. Self’s art often deals with the intersections of race and gender. The artist draws from her personal experiences as a Black American woman. She depicts bodies that are both exalted and objectified in Western imagery and art history. Through repetition, deconstruction and distortion of this imagery, she creates a new kind of narrative about the Black body.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nUgo Rondinone grew up as a secondo in central Switzerland. As a gay man, he saw his life limited by the Aids crisis. But he became a world artist. NZZ conducted a big interview with the artist about his life, in which he said: \"My self-confidence is like a fairy tale. One day you see yourself as a gilded carriage, the next you realize you're just a pumpkin after all\"\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nUgo Rondinone has created a screen print of The Sun and a series of 27 of his Mountain sculptures exclusively for the NZZ. Reminiscent of geological formations, these are crafted from stacked stone chunks, arranged in pairs to create abstract compositions. Originating with a monumental installation in Nevada in 2016, Rondinone's mountains have found homes in public spaces globally, as well as smaller interiors. Each stone in the series is painted in a vibrant Day-Glo color, adding to the visual impact of the pieces.\n\nFind out more here.\n\n\"Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Zurich, presents the eighth solo exhibition of the artist: bass+ (re)modification, on display until 18 May. In a large white room, a black horizontal line runs across three walls. Dotted above and below, we see a series of rectangular, monochrome MDF panels. These vary in size and palette – on one end we witness a vibrant neon green, on the other, a quiet, slim blue. There’s a sense of coolness and play at hand, invoked by geometric shapes that are constantly in conversation with each other. We feel an energy bounce off each board, reflecting and reverberating across the gallery in a way that suggests lyricality. You’d be forgiven for thinking that these panels represent bars of sound, as if to emulate a musical software application.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nMuseum SAN presents BURN TO SHINE, a solo exhibition of works by Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone. With over forty works of sculpture, painting, installation, and film featured in the museum’s three main galleries, as well as the Nam June Paik Hall and the outdoor stone garden, BURN TO SHINE offers the most comprehensive presentation of the artist’s oeuvre in Korea to date. In contrast to the broad spectrum of medium and visual language that individual works employ, however, the exhibition, as a whole, gravitates toward themes that remain at the core of Rondinone’ s artistic practice spanning over three decades – the cycle of life, and relationship to nature that fundamentally define our human condition and experience.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nTo inaugurate the second chapter of their involvement in the ReCollect! series, co-curator Laura Vuille talks to Matias Faldbakken and Ida Ekblad about their individual practices, artistic intentions and experiences in working collaboratively. For ReCollect!, the two have been working together for the first time, creating joint installations where they interpret selected works from the Kunsthaus Collection through their own hands-on approach.\n\nBook here.\n\nTschabalala Self’s work has been selected for the 2026 Fourth Plinth commission. The Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square is one of the most important art commissions worldwide, putting new work by internationally renowned artists into the heart of London. Self’s sculpture, titled Lady in Blue, pays homage to a contemporary woman, who could be one of many Londoners walking through Trafalgar Square. Made of bronze, she will reference the square’s existing monuments, but will be patinated with Lapis Lazuli, a refined blue pigment in use since antiquity.\n\nFind out more about the Fourth Plinth Commission here.\n\nOcula spoke to Louisa Gagliardi about her unconventional painting methods and her upcoming show at Galerie Eva Presenhuber x Taxa, Seoul. Her work often explores feelings of awkwardness and alienation, earning her the nickname Digital Dali. Oculat states: \"Gagliardi is one of very few artists who has found representation at a leading gallery for her digital paintings, which she augments with ink and nail polish.\"\n\nRead the full interview on Ocula.\n\nApropos Hodler - Current Perspectives on an Icon, a new exhibition at the Kunsthaus Zürich, offers a deep dive into the enduring legacy of Hodler's art, examining its contemporary relevance through four key themes: landscapes, corporeality, belonging, and enigma/transcendence. Among the artworks, Ugo Rondinone's mesmerizing glass horses, forged from fire into cast glass, represent the earth through the animal's physicality. They are named after the oceans and captivate viewers with their fusion of themes surrounding natural elements, exploration, and romance.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nBrooklyn-based Austin Eddy’s paintings call on the viewer to create their own stories out of the ones he proposes. He might use autobiographical events and abstract them to birds, but never imposes his own interpretation. His birds are more form than animal: they are stand-ins for the very human desire for personal freedom, framed by its equally strong wish for stability and structure. As his work toes the line between figurative and abstract, it recalls the cubist forms of the 20th century, while being firmly anchored in Austin’s present.\n\nRead the full interview on Collectors Agenda\n\n\"The title of Steven Shearer’s exhibition “Sleep, Death’s Own Brother” reverberates from the almost seven-meter-wide wall piece Sleep II, 2015, a collage of hundreds of small photos depicting slumbering individuals. Some seem to be peacefully resting, while others appear lifeless, resembling corpses. This lurking presence of death pervades the entire exhibition, evident in thirty-seven small drawings and thirteen prominent paintings like The Sickly Fauve, 2014, which shows a pale androgynous figure whose dark under-eye circles suggest they haven’t seen sunlight for weeks.\"\n\nRead the full article on Artforum\n\nThe Schirn Kunsthalle presents THE CULTURE, an exhibition commemorating the 50th anniversary of Hip Hop. Originating in the Bronx during the 1970s, Hip Hop emerged as a powerful platform for cultural expression and critique. In collaboration with the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Saint Louis Art Museum, this exhibition sheds light on Hip Hop's profound global influence spanning music, fashion, technology, and the arts over the past five decades. Showcasing over 100 works by acclaimed artists like Adam Pendleton and Tschabalala Self, the exhibition delves into themes such as identity, racism, appropriation, and empowerment.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nSofia Mitsola has contributed her artwork Faux Fur, Faux Her (2024) to a fundraising auction held during the Ibero-American Patronage Awards on March 3, 2024, organized by the Fundación Callia in Madrid.

Where do they sprout from? Where do they live?” she explains. “In 2022, I was on the Greek island of Paros in the Cyclades and it got me thinking about fantastical places. I wanted to create an island of my own.”\"\n\nRead the full article on Elephant.\n\nThe Spotlight series includes a new or never-before-exhibited artwork paired with a commissioned piece of writing, creating focused and thoughtful conversations between the visual arts and authors, critics, poets, scholars, and beyond.

The major exhibition shines a light on 50 artists from the 1960s to today who have explored the transformative and subversive potential of textiles, harnessing the medium to ask charged questions about power: who holds it, and how can it be challenged and reclaimed?\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nSpanning Fruitmarket's Exhibition Galleries and Warehouse, the exhibition starts with an architectural installation showcasing wall-based works, transitions to a room displaying Martin Boyce’s history with Jan and Joël Martel’s 1925 concrete ‘trees’, and reimagines Fruitmarket’s Upper Gallery with an atmospheric blend of works. In the Warehouse, sculptures are presented in unconventional ways, questioning notions of storage and memory. This comprehensive showcase, spanning from 1992 to the present, offers a rare opportunity to contemplate the artistic essence and sculptural language of one of the UK’s foremost artists.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nThe digital animation Memory selec+ by Gerwald Rockenschaub is an integral part of the facade of the Casino Bregenz from February 15 to March 29, 2024, where two colored squares pulsate daily from 5 pm to 1 am. The dynamic effect of the animation is further enhanced by the intense color contrasts of green and pink. Rockenschaub skillfully deals with the architectural conditions and once again raises the question of the relationship between viewer, artwork and space. The environment and the people themselves become an integral part of his art.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nValérie Knoll interviews Jean-Frédéric Schnyder about ŒL AUF LEINWAND, his retrospective exhibition spanning 40 years. The conversation covers Schnyder's \"Billige Bilder\" (Cheap Paintings), initially created for fun without the intention of being artworks, as well as his pragmatic titles and his resistance to hierarchical art categorization. Schnyder discusses his artistic process, aversion to technology, and passion for hands-on craftsmanship. The interview also explores Schnyder's daily routine, unconventional studio setup, and perceptions of irony in his art, offering insight into his diverse subjects and the creation of a comprehensive catalog of his works, providing a glimpse into his unconventional artistic journey.\n\nListen to the podcast here.\n\nChloe Stead reviewed Steven Shearer's exhibition at the George Economou Collection, Athens: \"I’ve never had insomnia, but Steven Shearer’s paintings are a good indication of what it must feel like. Red-eyed, his protagonists stare pleadingly out at the viewer or hide from their gaze under veils of lank hair, shoulders hunched, cigarette in mouth. Rendered with luminous blue-, yellow- and green-tinged skin, these men – visually coded as artist and musician types through their personal style and twilight activities – are clearly in need of some quality shut-eye.\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nJerry Saltz reviewed Tschabalala Self's exhibition Bodega Run at the Swiss Institute in New York: \"Were the dusty bodegas of old superior to the anonymous, flattened spaces where many of us now buy our food?

Her practice mainly revolves around alienation, and dislocation as essential features of our current, global existence. Gagliardi’s strongly pronounced, figurative paintings form not only technically, but also visually a complex game denoting delirium or delusion. For this show, the artist will conceive a new series of paintings and sculptures within a maze-like scenography. Deep Breaths builds upon her ongoing interest in the liminal space. In our highly technological and hyper connected world the borders between reality and fiction are becoming more and more blurry. We get tricked into thinking that our flesh self and virtual self might become one.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nAmong those familiar with Eva Presenhuber's work is Zurich-based artist and curator Mitchell Anderson, who founded the project space Plymouth Rock in 2014 to 'show artists who weren't getting the attention they deserved' in Zurich.

Tuazon creates an immersive spatial intervention where the public is invited to walk around and through the work within the natural environment of Wadi Hanifa. Responding to the colonnade of palm trees on the site, Tuazon has positioned wood rings in the space between trees, which frame the artworks and create a series of illuminated portals along the stone pathway. Amidst the urban space of Riyadh, Light Rings takes ecology as its main source of inspiration, incorporating illumination, geometry, and harmony with its surroundings to form a vessel of time, light, and space.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nAesthetica Magazine reviewed Doug Aitken's show at SCHAUWERK: \"It’s a piece that informs a wider exhibition rooted in behaviour and fragmentation. The artist offers up a contemporary portrait of a restless, globalised world — driven by constant information, progress and technology. It speaks to other interdisciplinary installations, such as Julianknxx’s In ReMemory of Flight at The Barbican Centre, London, or John Akomfrah’s Arcadia at The Box, that use media and film as a means of documentation and observation. Overwhelmingly, Aitken tells us to pay attention to our rapidly changing environment.

Published by Gregory R. Miller & Co. and edited by Sasha Bonét, it explores the cultural significance of these community-owned spaces. The anthology combines Self's vibrant visuals with nine newly commissioned texts by diverse authors that explore the complex consumer and merchant dynamics of New York's metropolitan culture and the bodega's potential as a radical site of resistance from racial, gender, and diasporic perspectives. To mark its release, the Swiss Institute in New York will host a book launch on January 11, 2024, displaying Self's new Bodega Run works.

One of his central goals, as he put it to me later, is “redefining our relationship with the landscape, outside of basketball, enslavement.” He’s concerned with matters of agency, world building, and individuality—what he calls “post-victimhood” storytelling. “I really believe in life,” he told me. “I go out and try to make the best of it.”\"\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nPeter Fischli David Weiss, Douglas Gordon, Ugo Rondinone, Doug Aitken, Tschabalala Self and Franz West were selected among this year’s Kunstkompass Top 100 contemporary artists rankings in Capital Magazin!

They join gallery stalwarts, including Ugo Rondinone, Franz West and Steven Shearer, in a show of about 80 works by about 26 artists (November 11 to February 24). The title of the exhibition is Melencolia, although Presenhuber says that the art is more “works that are all reflective and thoughtful”. This, she says, is relevant for some of today’s artists under the age of 40 who can get “abused by high prices at auction, when they need more time and energy to think about what they are making.

Transparent, futuristic-looking plastic boxes preserve what has been encapsulated.

This creates an environment that includes visual, haptic, and auditory elements in the field of experience. The momentary appearance of a lightning bolt, typically observed in the distance, is brought closer to the visitor by means of a bronze body visually accentuated with yellow colour.

Horizons is a a large-scale aluminum boat carrying two ‘austronauts.’ According to the artist, these two characters, their eyes fixed on the distance, are ‘exo-humans’ in search of an advanced humanity. 'Horizons' also echoes two historical paintings which he references in his work as a sculptor: 'La barque de Dante' by Eugène Delacroix (1822) and 'Die Toteninsel' by Arnold Böcklin (1880). The boat, and more broadly the theme of navigation, are central to Appriou’s work, imbued with the idea of passage and elevated consciousness.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nRecently, Tschabalala Self has developed an interest for sculpture, theatre and fashion.

The title of the exhibition, Feed Me, Kiss Me, Need Me, is taken from the accompanying script. Self is particularly interested in the dual nature of the private environment as an emotionally and socially charged locus. \"The house has two realities,\" she states. \"A desired reality — a place of comfort, inwardness and true self-expression.\" \"In reality, it is a place full of expectations, where people are required to assume roles.\"\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nThis group exhibition highlights how the repertoire of circus forms continues to explore current social issues on both micro and macro levels, question political structures, expose stigmatization and illuminate the human-animal relationship. In his piece If There Were Anywhere But Desert. Saturday (2011), Ugo Rondinone skillfully captures the poignant essence of clowns, evoking a sense of melancholy that resonates with viewers. The suspended shoes embody the fragility and transience of human emotions, a theme that has permeated the circus throughout its long history, not only in its moments of joy and celebration, but also in its more sombre and melancholy aspects.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nRonald Berg at Kunstforum concludes about Martin Boyce recent gallery exhibitions: \"Perhaps Martin Boyce's 'fall from grace' into the applied metier is a symptom of the fact that the patterns of autonomy and freedom of purpose are no longer strictly valid today.

Encompassing all of the museum’s special exhibition galleries, To Divide By includes new paintings, drawings and ceramics, as well as two recent film portraits. For Pendleton, abstraction is a means of representation, a logic, and a space for theoretical and visual experimentation. “By working in and through abstraction,” noted Meredith Malone, curator at the Kemper Art Museum, who organized To Divide By in collaboration with the artist, “Pendleton calls for a more capacious, chaotic and fluid space, one capable of producing radically new expectations and outcomes, not only for himself but also for the viewer.”\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nOscar Tuazon and curator Lynn Kost will give an artist talk during Castell Art Weekend at Hotel Castell in Zuoz. Lynn Kost said \"Oscar Tuazon, (*1975 in Seattle) creates platforms with his sculptures on which other things are supposed to happen besides the viewing of art. Based on his interest in do-it-yourself architecture, he creates objects that open up interior spaces to the public. These can be entered and are linked to art historical references and socially acute themes such as resource consumption or sustainability. Just as the artist does not complete the structures into functional architecture in order to create space for the audience's imagination, the content references are only offers for discussion, because the common exchange comes before everything else.“\n\nFind out more about the event here.\n\nFor the exhibition series ReCollect!, Matias Faldbakken and Ida Ekblad are working together for the first time, creating a joint installation where they interpret selected works from the Kunsthaus Collection, as seen through their own hands-on activity.

Nature Doesn’t Know About Us celebrates the disparate elements of the Earth, while exploring the human connection to nature. The exhibition brings together the works of eighteen artists who combine skeptical clarity and at times humor-tinged desire to locate the intersection of spiritual and physical presence in our daily life. The natural world serves as a doorway into a highly rarefied metaphysical realm where the sea of consciousness surges against the tangible world. A world where all is in flux as distinctions between self and soul, body and spirit, past and present, mortification and bliss, confinement and escape all blur and waver.\"\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nTogether with Bergen Kunsthall and Kunst Museum Winterthur, Kunsthalle Bielefeld presents a trio of exhibitions that approach Oscar Tuazon’s work in different ways.

This space is usually reserved for temporary exhibitions of the collection. The Consortium Museum's directors have given this \"wing\" of the structure to two artists, Tobias Pils (b. 1971, Austria) and Joe Bradley (b. 1975, USA), who have strong ties to the art center and have previously exhibited there. The \"Paysage\" exhibition was the result of these two painters becoming curators. It pulls together pieces from their own collections by artists whose discreet careers have been characterized as \"folkart,\" \"outsider,\" and other vague terms. Hans Kruckenhauser, an Austrian painter who lived from 1940 until 2017, is the subject of Tobias Pils's current project.

The artist take over public spaces in the village of Saint-Paul de Vence, each developing, in their own way, a unique relationship with birds.\n\nSee more installation views here.\n\nDoug Aitken’s latest work, HOWL, is a 15-minute, five-channel film about an unnamed town in the American West. It’s filled with epic aerial shots of oil wells and daily life in the town, along with short excerpts from interviews with some of its residents. Those interviews take on an eerie meaning as their words echo and reverberate. It is on view at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Zurich, Maag Areal through July 22, 2023.\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nAt this year's Art Basel, we are pleased to present Ugo Rondinone’s sculpture humanskysix (2022), which is revealed to have been cast from the body of Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer. The sculpture will be on view at our booth P5 in Hall 2.1. The Basel-born Federer collaborated with fellow Swiss Ugo Rondinone on his ambitious installation human clouds, which is the third part of the trilogy burn shine fly – an exhibition celebrating life and its seasons, rhythms, and natural elements.\n\nWatch the documentary Portrait of a Champion here.\n\nMister Neutral: Martin Herbert investigates what lies behind the constructed guise of the amateur, the craftsman, the style-less dabbler, the cross maker, defining Jean-Frédéric Schnyder as a man of quietly huge ambitions who planned, up front, to outrun all of us while embracing a world full of difference and contradiction, of beauty and banality and brutality, leaving a trail of clues in his wake.\n\nOn Schnyderian Art: Originally published in 1990 in the pages of Parkett, this essay by Patrick Frey is an ode to the greatness of Jean-Frédéric Schnyder and his art—a mixture of trueness to life and a profoundly skeptical intelligence.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nOver the past ten years, Kahn has examined the spatial relationship between painting and sculpture to construct a visual vocabulary of representational and abstract forms that integrate formal concerns with materials from everyday life. His new works are playful narrative compositions with oversized figurative icons taken from domestic life. The deep, rusted red tone of the sculptures is a result of the natural weathering process of Cor-Ten steel, contrasting with the lush green foliage the LongHouse garden. The series was previously on view at City Hall Park, New York. In June 2023, two sculptures are shown at Art Basel Parcours 2023.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nCelebrating the Museum’s 125th anniversary, this landmark exhibition honors the East End’s rich artistic legacy and brings greater attention to major artists practicing here today. Forty-one artists have selected works from the collection to be shown along with their own. Rondinone's contribution, the alphabet of my mothers and fathers, is made of twenty-six panels arranged as a grid on all four walls of the gallery. Each panel holds a set of preindustrial farming and kitchen tools collected by the artist in the past three years from different farms and garage sales on Long Island.\n\nLearn more about the exhibition.\n\nFor his group of works Sunrise. East, Rondinone assigned a head with characteristic, highly reduced facial features to represent each calendar month. Larger than life and cast in shiny silver aluminium, the massive sculptural heads are reduced to their facial expressions: With mouths agape, they gaze from small eyes, from friendly and naïve to sceptical, from surprised to eerie. They trigger the most diverse associations, evoking ritual masks and ghosts, as well as the visual language of comics, emoticons, and memes. Visitors to the Städel Garden are invited to come face-to-face with all twelve creatures – and thus every month of the year – and experience the various joys, adversities, and emotions of an entire year in fast forward.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nA work by Joe Bradley is included in the group show A Leisurely Stroll - The Tenth Anniversary of The Long Museum at Long Museum, Shanghai. The theme of this exhibition is \"A Leisurely Stroll\", which points to two concepts that I want to talk about: one is \"time and history\", and the other is a \"way of seeing\". The show is curated by Wang Wei.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nGalerie Eva Presenhuber is proud to announce the representation of London-based Greek artist Sofia Mitsola, alongside Pilar Corrias, London. Mitsola works primarily with painting to examine the female body. By looking at figures in ancient Egyptian and Greek sculpture, Japanese animation, and pornography, she composes her own mythological characters and places them in geometrical, stage-like compositions. These are painted in vibrant colors and are layered with washes and impasto. Her paintings often feature bare, larger-than-life characters who address the viewer with their direct gaze and invite them to look back. Through this act, Mitsola forms dynamic relationships between the painting and the viewer to establish new hierarchies and play with ideas of voyeurism, power, and control.\n\nThis year's Biennale Weiertal revolves around \"common ground\": it is about social and ecological justice, and how closely they are linked. This becomes clear with regard to the current global exploitation of people and nature, to the distribution of resources on the planet that is supposed to be our \"common ground\". With 17 artistic contributions, among which Sam Falls, the garden in the Weiertal becomes a place of reflection and perhaps even the nucleus of social utopias that are carried from here into the world.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nLouisiana Channel met Hughes in her New York-studio to talk about drawing inspiration from other painters, and why she feels that a good painting is about “going to the edge and not giving away all the answers.”\n\nWatch the video here.\n\n“How could I make a painting about one flower that has multiple layers to it?” says American artist Shara Hughes about her painting POP, why the genre of still life was a thing of the past and needed to be updated.\n\nWatch the video here.\n\nStorm King Art Center presents the sun and the moon, twin sculptures, which are both over sixteen feet tall, and are formed with delicate circles fashioned from cast-bronze tree branches, one silver-leafed and the other gilded. Installed parallel to one another, the sun and the moon are aligned along an east-west axis, like portals or apertures with views of Schunnemunk and Storm King Mountains.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nLiam Gillick’s intervention in the permanent collection of Berlin’s Museum of the Ancient Near East, titled Filtered Time, opened to the public in April 2023. Using light, color, shape, projection, sound, and almost no text, his intervention comes at a time when the Pergamon Museum, in which this collection is housed, is projected to close at the end of 2023. Gillick agreed to realize his project amidst difficult debates about how to deal with these buildings and the fraught colonial histories they house, about which he spoke to Jörg Heiser.\n\nRead the full conversation between Liam Gillick and Jörg Heiser here.\n\nWorks by Karen Kilimnik and Verne Dawson are included in Beautiful, Vivid, Self-contained, a group exhibition at the Hill Art Foundation curated by artist and writer David Salle.

The show is on view in Chelsea from April 21 to July 21, 2023.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\n\"[...] These paintings are time. They take it and give it away. They move toward the viewer and away with him. They transform themselves in him for it is he who shifts them into a subjective shade of time and recreates them. And yet they continue to exist, indeed by simply existing they are the most basic form of dialogue. A dialogue that never demands affirmation nor negation, but decision - even if without compassion, for this picture in this moment, that is, in time! [...]\"\n\n— Tobias Pils\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nThis conversation with Doug Aitken and Neville Wakefield explores the origins of Aitken’s Mirage project (2017 – ongoing), and the continuum between the inaugural Desert X in the Coachella Valley and its newest exhibition. This program is presented in conjunction with the forthcoming release of Aitken’s immersive monograph Mirage, co-published by JRP|Editions and ZOLO PRESS, in collaboration with LUMA for Elevation 1049. This publication will also be presented on June 10 at Galerie Eva Presenhuber at the openign of Aitken's new exhibition HOWL.\n\nClick here to RSVP.\n\nTitled after a line from Hesiod’s eighth-century BC epic poem Theogony (“Harmful Night, veiled in dusky fog, carries in her arms Sleep, Death’s own brother”), this new exhibition by Steven Shearer revolves around this uneasy proximity (“brotherhood”) between death and sleep, a recurring trope in Shearer’s art. Built around the George Economou Collection’s substantial holdings of Steven Shearer’s work in painting and printed matter, Sleep, Death’s Own Brother proposes an in-depth look at the oeuvre of this Vancouver-based artist from the transgressive thematic perspective of the lifeless body, which is sometimes truly, sometimes only seemingly dead.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nThe Bündner Kunstmuseum is dedicating Dieter Roth an exhibition that by means of representative work groups gives a rare overview of his copious printmaking. The exhibition curated by Dr. Dirk Dobke and Dr. Ina Jessen for the Deichtorhallen Hamburg will be presented in an adapted form and brings together material and print works from all creative periods in the most comprehensive Dieter-Roth-exhibition in a good 20 years.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nAfter their collaboration in burn to shine (2020), Ugo Rondinone and the French-Morrocan choreographer Fouad Boussouf join forces again in the world premier of VÏA. This new ballet piece with a decor by Rondinone takes the spectators on a trip across the rhythms of urban hip-hop, the splendor of Arabian folklore, and the extravaganza of Nouveau Cirque, ultimately leading dance back to its origin in the material soil. The presentation takes place at the Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève from April 19 to 23, 2023.\n\nFind out more about the project here.\n\nJohn Giorno’s vision for a shared, open-access repository of information was groundbreaking in a pre-digital world. Dial-A-Poem was first presented at MoMA in the 1970 exhibition Information, organized by Kynaston McShine. Galvanized by social movements, including opposition to the Vietnam War, Giorno incorporated numerous works by radical poets and political activists. This exhibition features notes and documentation that illustrate how he originally arranged the poems, as well as phones containing 200 randomized poems selected by the artist in 2012 from his archive of thousands.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nIn the exhibition Valentin Carron & Jacques Chessex, the Tichy Ocean Foundation presents two of the most well-known French-speaking Swiss artists. Central to this exhibition is Valentin Carron’s larger-than-life sculpture Man and Child. It was conceived especially for the Tichy Ocean foundation exhibition and is placed, as per the artist’s wish, with more than fifty Chessex’s collages (1934-2009), meant as a sculptural haven of peace for the rather existential paper-works.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nFollowing the opening of ‘The Close of the Day,’ Chase Hall joins Document to discuss the American South, code switching, and how his biracial experience is far from monolithic. He says: “As we get closer to the future, and we talk about equity, and we talk about rights, it’s important for me to navigate in a way that’s honest to myself—even in that core, even in that genetic humility.”\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nTschabalala Self is the latest artist to unveil a new window display at the Hermès flagship boutique on Madison Avenue, New York, as part of the house’s historic Vitrine d’artiste programme. Hermès artistic window displays first began in the 1930s in Paris with the work of Annie Beaumel, a young sales assistant from the glove department, whose conceptual displays pioneered the use of shop windows as a space for artistic expression and exhibition. Tschabalala’s vignette offers shoppers and passersby a glimpse into an intimate moment, with her chorus of characters leisurely enjoying their familiar, albeit uncanny, environment, which Self has furnished with the trappings of an everyday home.\n\nYuki Higashino reviewed the exhibition Leaving the New World by the US-American artist John Dilg, which was on view at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Vienna, from January 14 to February 18, 2023. He says: \"Dilg is highly skilled, and his painterly erudition is unmistakable. He gives shape to an idea of a place that might have but did not come into being.\"\n\nRead the whole review here.\n\nHuman Is juxtaposes historical with newly produced artworks. The exhibition paints a polyphonic picture of the mutual penetration of body and technology: it addresses the often violent interdependence of humans on their technological surroundings and opposes any promises of salvation through trans-humanistic progress. Simultaneously, it opens up spaces of possibility in which dual-istic taxonomies can be overcome in favor of a networked and interdependent existence. With a contribution by Matthew Angelo Harrison.\n\nFind our more about the exhibition here.\n\nSince its emergence in the Bronx in the 1970s, hip hop has grown into a global phenomenon, driving innovations in music, fashion, technology, and visual and performing arts. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the birth of hip hop, The Culture: Hip Hop and Contemporary Art in the 21st Century captures the extraordinary influence hip hop has had on contemporary society through more than 90 works of art and fashion by some of today’s most important and celebrated artists, among them Adam Pendleton and Tschabalala Self.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition.\n\nThe exhibition Ein Ruheloses Universum by the artist duo Peter Fischli David Weiss shows the two works Surrli (1989) and the original Rat and Bear costumes (2004). The two animal figures appear in Peter Fischli David Weiss' work in various roles, for example as protagonists in the film The Least Resistance (1980-81) or as \"authors\" of the artist book Order and Cleanliness (1981) – two works which are also part of the exhibition at the Bechtler Stiftung.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nIn April 2023, Ugo Rondinone, curator of the exhibition when the sun goes down and the moon comes up, and the choreographer Fouad Boussouf work together on VÏA at the Grand Théâtre de Genève, a new piece for the Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève. In March, as an appetizer, Fouad Boussouf imagines for the Ballet a way to inhabit the exhibition. The result of two weeks of intense work in the “rhythmic spaces” imagined by Rondinone on the ground floor of the Museum of Art and History, Corps (im)mobiles invites us to discover the exhibition in a different way.\n\nFind out more about the project and purchase tickets here.\n\nThe exhibition ON STAGE explores the various theatrical and stage-related forms of expression in art since the 1960s, when a neo-avant-garde critical of tradition began focusing on performative and actionist art forms that endowed artists with a stage-like presence, often in front of an audience. The Viennese Actionism with its provocative and time-critical theatricality is just as much a part of this as the Vienna Group, whose literary cabaret stands firmly in the tradition of Dadaist theater, or the Fluxus-Movement with its media crossovers. The exhibition shows 150 works and work series, among them a painting by Tobias Pils, most of which are culled from the holdings of the mumok collection.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition.\n\nAs the signs that we need to rethink the polarity between nature and culture are multiplying, the exhibition “Nature Humaine – Humaine Nature” invites us to explore the complex relationship between humanity and nature. Although the fourteen artists seem to share the desire to foreground the urgent issues we face and to rethink our behaviours, they engage with different realms. Their works, including sculptures, drawings and videos, capture apparently bucolic elements or evoke the disastrous effects of humanity’s domination over the rest of the living world.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nHighlighting an interest in the history, technology, form and aesthetics, function or symbolism of flying objects, the exhibition centers around planes, airships, collections around the Balloonmania, wind tunnel models, collections of the Museum of Air and Space and archival images to pay tribute to the essential history of this building in aerostation and atraumatic. The group exhibition will bring together major figures of international artistic creation, among them the artist Doug Aitken.

The resulting exhibition consists of imaginatively calibrated vignettes of paintings and fashion, which celebrate glamour, beauty, fantasy, and the occult through the eyes of two singular yet overlapping perceptions. The title references the mid-century high society women who Truman Capote dubbed the “Swans”.\n\nFind out more about the exhibition here.\n\nWatch as artists Gelatin and Liam Gillick transform the Kunsthalle Wien exhibition space into a nightmarish film set. Based on the book To Live and Think Like Pigs, this improvised experimental film follows the story of four delusional, narcissistic, privileged young snobs as they navigate a time of political turmoil. You’ll almost feel like an extra in the film’s monumental faux-stone architecture set as you witness the main characters move through stages of development and self-reflection... until everything collapses.\n\nStream the movie from March 24, 2023, here.\n\nPioneer (2023), a new sculptural work by Tschabalala Self, is now on view in this year’s Desert X, the recurring exhibition that activates desert locations through site-specific installations across the Coachella Valley. For most, the expansiveness and freedom of the American West is inextricably tied to the Stetsoned archetype. Forgoing the forefathers, Self’s Pioneer is a monument built in homage to the collective foremothers of contemporary America — the largely unidentified Native and African American women whose bodies and labour allowed for American expansionism and growth. It stands as a visual representation of their birthright and place within the American landscape.\n\nExplore the viewing room here.\n\nChase Hall interrogates the realities of race in America through innovative figurative painting techniques and iconography that engage the past and the present. Using coffee grounds as pigment on raw cotton canvases, Hall varies the levels of coarseness and fineness of the bean to achieve a range of tonal values, metaphorically articulating a non-monolithic Black experience and evoking his biracial hybridity. The artist’s first solo museum exhibition brings together new paintings and an impressive installation featuring a century-old, self-playing Wurlitzer organ ensconced in a brick room, evoking the museum’s historic structure — and the breath and memory of those who created it.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nGerwald Rockenschaub's exhibition reappropriation (allure/construct) is on view at Schlossmuseum Linz from March 31 to July 2, 2023. The artist is one of the most internationally renowned representatives of contemporary Austrian art. Since his artistic beginnings in the Neo Geo movement of the 1980s, he has developed a stringent oeuvre characterized by radical reduction and precision. His works reveal borrowings from constructivist-concrete traditions as well as an interest in the abstraction of form, which plays an essential role in the creation of pictograms and similar pictorial signs.\n\nSee the installation views here.\n\nmumok presents New York artist Adam Pendleton’s first comprehensive solo exhibition in Europe. Pendleton’s painting is a continuous index in which gestures are recorded, transposed, and overwritten. Since 2008 he has articulated much of his work through the idea of Black Dada, an ever-evolving inquiry into the relationship between Blackness, abstraction, and the avant-garde. In his paintings, drawings, and other works, a visual philosophy of incomplete postulates emerges, flattening the distinctions between legibility and abstraction, past and present, familiar and strange. Curated by Marianne Dobner.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nOn the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Pinakothek der Moderne, the Modern Art Collection presents itself anew on 3,600 square meters of exhibition space with around 350 works by more than 150 artists.

One of the artists included in the exhibition was Tschabalala Self.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nKaren Kilimnik's solo exhibition Swan Lake at Kunsthaus Glarus is on view from February 26 to June 25, 2023. The exhibition presents two installative settings featuring Kilimnik's works Swan Lake (1992) and Kitri and friends at the garden folly (2004). Flanking these are paintings from different years that depict a “forest clearing as stage” theme but which also engage intrinsically with presence and absence. With these and other works, the exhibition highlights Kilimnik’s artistic ability to continually renegotiate the conditions of established narratives within and beyond her time.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nTschabalala Self's solo exhibition Inside Out at Kunstmuseum St.Gallen is on view from February 25 to June 18, 2023. The artist is deeply engaged with the medium of painting. She paints with various pigments, materials, textiles and threads. Her unique technique includes found, acquired, and hand-­dyed fabrics. With these she creates figures that depict avatars rather than individuals. The artist draws from her personal experiences as a Black American woman. In this context she stages bodies that are often exalted and excluded within her imagined environments.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nKunstmuseum Winterthur is presenting a retrospective of the American artist Oscar Tuazon, covering the years from 2000 to the present. For the exhibition in Winterthur, the artist is realizing an expansive wooden structure that is a sculpture, model house, meeting place and event forum all in one. By going beyond the limits of the room, it creates a new, incomparably more informal space for encounter and art.\n\nSee all installation views here.\n\nJean-Frédéric Schnyder's solo exhibition, officially on view until February 5, 2023 at Vienna Secession, shows a cross-section of the artist's painting from almost forty years (1983–2021). In his typical manner, the 102 paintings of various formats (all: oil on canvas) are hung evenly spaced and, increasing in size from front to back and then decreasing again, form a horizontal line. The ever-changing live image of the outdoor space, which the glass door on the front wall reveals, is part of the concept.\n\nLearn more on Secession, Vienna\n\nArtflyer recently published a major article and interview with the artist Jean-Marie Appriou. In the interview, Appriou says, “What interests me is to go beyond this imaginary surface that the mirage, or the world, is. This Alice in Wonderland or William Blake trick of the passage. The door to another state. When we are in front of a work of art, we don’t know what happens, it is indescribable, but we pass through a door to a state of superior consciousness.”\n\nRead more on Artflyer\n\nIn the newest video with Public Art Fund, artist Wyatt Kahn and curator Daniel S. Palmer discuss Kahn’s first public art exhibition, Life in the Abstract. Together, they delve into the inspiration drawn from Kahn’s daily life, connections to his broader practice, and how the sculptures reflect the democratizing spirit of public art. On Wednesday, December 7, there will be an Artist Talk with Wyatt Kahn, where he will address his multidimensional practice encompassing painting, drawing, and sculpture, focusing on Life in the Abstract.\n\nWatch on Public Art Fund\n\nThe strong, vivid hues shining in this collection appear as the shades of the rainbow. A color spectrum beautifully represented in Ugo Rondinone's visual cosmos, particularly his rainbow works. WE ARE POEMS embodies the artist's fascination with poetry emphasizing the subjective, the irrational, the emotional. The Swiss-born, New York-based artist believes that poetry-like art-needs no explanation, no thinking, but rather demands simply to be felt. Creative Director Albert Kriemler has selected this artwork as a symbol for the self-evident sensuality of Akris clothes and as a perfect representation for the 100 year anniversary of the fashion house.\n\nView the Défilé here\n\nthe water is a poem\n\nunwritten by the air\n\nno. the earth is a poem\n\nunwritten by the fire\n\nEvery autumn since 2015, the Petit Palais, Paris has invited contemporary artists to exhibit alongside its permanent collection.

Undeterred by the monumentality of the space, the artist integrated her work into its architecture pursuing a practice of blending light, color, video, and sound.
