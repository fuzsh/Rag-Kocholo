        "text": "Perfect Forming Technology\n\nFunctionality and Precision – Criteria for Moulds in the Production of Mould-Hardened Components\n\n“Easy to fill and easy to demould” – for the past few decades, user expectations for moulds used to process wetcast concrete, including self-compacting concrete, have been fully encompassed by these two requirements in the majority of cases. Recent developments such as increasing aesthetic standards, greater consideration of workers’ needs, and – last but not least – the importance of meeting functional quality requirements are driving forward advancements in the concrete casting segment. The bottom line is that these advancements also need to boost the cost-effectiveness of modern mould concepts compared to traditional technology. The quality levels expected from moulds used to produce components for building construction and special civil engineering applications (particularly tunnel liners) have been rising steadily. Meanwhile, the production of components for pipeline construction in general has seen significant developments in recent years. CPI 2-2024\n\n> read article\n\nMAGIC 1501\n\nBetonwerk Kühne gets set for the future with a new universal manhole riser production system\n\nAt its site in the Bavarian town of Geretsried, concrete manufacturer Betonwerk Kühne GmbH & Co. KG mainly produces precast concrete parts for civil engineering. Following the overhaul of the concrete mixing plant, the latest investment project involved replacing the existing production equipment for manhole risers and manhole cones, a 1989 Magic model from Schlüsselbauer. In spite of its robust design, the unit was beginning to show its age, and the outlay associated with ongoing servicing work could no longer be justified. However, since Kühne were still extremely satisfied with this Schlüsselbauer equipment, they once again opted for this tried-and-tested production concept and a modern Magic 1501 is now taking the place of the old machine. CPI 1-2024\n\n> read article\n\nPerfect Forming Technology\n\nEfficient production and installation: Jacking pipes from Beton Müller\n\nWhen it comes to trenchless installation, a hybrid pipeconsisting of durable reinforced concrete and a corrosion-resistant plastic inner lining has been gaining traction in Europe over the past few years. Supplied by German manufacturer Beton Müller from Baden-Württemberg, the Perfect jacking pipe has since been used in numerous projects both within and outside Germany. The jacking pipes are produced following the Perfect Pipe process, which has been proven for over 10 years at Beton Müller.

In an effort to solidify the company’s future, however, and before handing over the company to his children, Jacques Plattard wanted to invest in an upgrade of the company’s production systems at its plant in Villefranche-sur-Saône — starting with the pipe manufacturing plant a few years ago and now followed by an upgrade to their manhole production. Part of Jacques Plattard’s success is that he expects a great deal from his partners, which he repays by displaying loyalty through his friendly business relationships. One of his long-standing partnerships is with Austrian manufacturer Schlüsselbauer Technology, which in turn ensures Plattard keeps its leading position for manhole components in the extensive area of France’s southeast market.

As well as updating the hall and mixer infrastructure, the company is gradually replacing or upgrading its production facilities in line with the state of the art. In Summer 2022, a Magic 2500 machine from Austrian manufacturer Schlüsselbauer Technology was installed, representing another milestone in the site upgrade. The cost-effective Magic system was purchased to manufacture manhole risers and cones with nominal widths of 2000 and 2500 mm.

With an annual sales growth of 25–30% and a doubling of sales between 2020 and 2022, the company has gone from strength to strength in recent years and is also highly optimistic about the future. If it achieves its target of doubling sales again by 2025, it will have quadrupled its sales in just five years. According to the company’s own figures, it is the third-largest producer of precast concrete parts for civil engineering. The significant growth that it has enjoyed in recent years can be attributed to the strong rates of investment, which have brought about a very high level of automation. The result is drastically improved productivity combined with a significant reduction in production costs and rejected goods.

The company also provides full project support – from professional consultation and analysis of cost-saving potential, to preparation of tender documents. In an effort to keep high quality production economical, Tiba relies on meticulous maintenance of their existing systems as well as regular modernization. A good example of this methodology is seen at their Sollenau plant, where a new Magic 1501 production system for manhole components, such as risers and cones, was recently commissioned. This new Magic 1501 system was engineered and installed by the Austrian company Schlüsselbauer Technology GmbH & Co KG, a long-term and close partner of Tiba.

There are at least three key aspects behind this trend. The increase in use of jacking pipes to avoid having costly and time-consuming open trenches on construction sites is an ongoing trend in pipeline construction. In addition to this, there is increasing demand for corrosion-resistant pipelines—above all in the wastewater sector. Finally, Schlüsselbauer has continually improved the quality and functionality of its concrete casting moulds over several decades, to the point where its Perfect Forming Technology casting moulds are now considered among the leading products in the concrete sector.
