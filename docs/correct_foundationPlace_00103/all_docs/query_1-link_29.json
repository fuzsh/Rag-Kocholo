        "text": "A golden concrete core as a gift for the inauguration of new test benches? At the end of March, we participated in the opening ceremony for the new interior noise test benches of Mercedes-Benz AG in Sindelfingen as the overall planner of the project. These test benches meet all the requirements of e-mobility and can handle all phenomena of interior noise and powertrain integration. For the project, the test benches in the existing building were replaced with new ones. Before installing the new test benches, the existing had to be dismantled. It turned out that some components, including the vibrating foundation, were in partly good condition and could be reused. Nevertheless, foundation elements weighing several tons had to be removed, which took a total of 3 months and thus represented an important milestone in the project. As an overall planner, we were responsible for the complete planning and tendering of the upgrading and modernization and supervised the project until its realization. For this successful implementation, SBI has received a golden concrete core, symbolic for the entire project. We are very proud of this, as we contribute to sustainability with the upgrading and modernization in the project. Stay tuned if you want to learn more about this project. Many thanks to Mercedes-Benz AG! #successful #project #testbench #testfacility #concrete #sbiwbi"
