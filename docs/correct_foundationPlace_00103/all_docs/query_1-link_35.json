        "text": "The state roads L1182/L1183 connect the economic area Sindelfingen/Böblingen with the surrounding countryside to the west. The L 1182 ran through the centre of the Sindelfingen district of Darmsheim. The northern bypass of Darmsheim was planned to relieve traffic in the town centre. The measure comprised the new construction of the state road L 1182 starting in the northwest of Darmsheim up to the district road K 1004 in the northeast. The core of this northern bypass is the 468 m long Darmsheim tunnel.\n\nThe Darmsheim Tunnel consists of the 468 m long main tunnel with 2 lanes and emergency walkways on both sides. Approximately in the middle of the tunnel, a walk-in rescue tunnel branches off from the main tunnel. The rescue tunnel is approx. 238 m long and runs parallel to the main tunnel towards the west portal. Approx. 90 m in front of the west portal the collecting basin for the longitudinal drainage of the tunnel and approx. 170 m in front of the east portal the operating building were erected.\n\nThe Darmsheim tunnel, except for the portal areas, was excavated in a closed construction method (New Austrian Tunnel Construction Method). East and west portals were each constructed on approx. 15 m in an open construction method.\n\nIn order to preserve the natural terrain horizon as much as possible, the west portal was integrated into the existing steep slope in such a way that the original terrain intersects with the tunnel construction at the portal collar. Due to the steep slope inclination of approx. 30° to 45°, the overburden above the tunnel increases rapidly. The east portal is located on the edge of a former quarry. The quarry is partially backfilled with landfill material. In the course of the road construction of the northern bypass Darmsheim, the preliminary cut east with the construction pit embankments, the tunnel stop walls incl. soil nailing and the operating building were already largely constructed as a preliminary measure.\n\nIn the mining section, the tunnel consists of a double-shell construction with a temporarily load-bearing outer shell and an inner shell of reinforced concrete. The tunnel can be constructed largely without a static concrete base. The inner shell is set up on both sides on foundation banquets. In the tunnel entrance sections, the installation of a statically acting base vault is required. The length of the section with base vault is approx. 27 m in the west and approx. 33 m in the east. The open structures east and west were given a statically co-operating base vault, analogous to the adjoining tunnel entrance sections. The tunnel structure was designed as a water-impermeable concrete structure. A separating foil is arranged between the outer and inner shell. The reinforced concrete inner shell was manufactured in blocks with a standard block length of 10 m. The tunnel was constructed in a watertight concrete structure.\n\nThe rescue tunnel consists of an open portal structure and a closed tunnel. The rescue tunnel is connected to the main tube with the widening cross section. The extension was carried out with a single shell and a two-layer structure of the tunnel shell without sealing. The first layer is the shotcrete outer shell installed in the course of the driving protection. The second layer of the arch support was made of reinforced special shotcrete. Entering mountain water is collected via the central mountain water drainage and led to the tunnel portal."
