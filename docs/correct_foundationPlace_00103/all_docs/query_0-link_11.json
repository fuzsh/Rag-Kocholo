        "text": "An especially light, hybrid-slab construction in steel and reinforced concrete is planned to minimize the dead loads. The slab construction will facilitate large span widths, whereby the central zone of the building can remain free of columns. Regular openings in the steel joists enable and uncomplicated installation of building services within the ceiling plenum. The pedestal construction will be implemented in the same hybrid construction technique so that the exhibition and conference area can be designed free of columns. Only the bracing cores and the underground carpark will be constructed with reinforced concrete; the sub-terranean areas in contact with earth will be constructed with water impermeable concrete to provide a waterproof barrier."
