        "text": "GERALD_WALLACE_TIMBERWOLVES_PRESEASON.JPG\n\nGerald Wallace, seen above driving for a dunk during the preseason, was surprised to find out several Celtics teammates did not know his nickname, Crash.\n\n(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Graham Hughes)\n\nBOSTON – Brandon Bass probably is not used to teammates putting him in danger.\n\nBut Gerald Wallace’s physical style of play – which long ago earned him the appropriate nickname “Crash” – threatened Bass at one point during Wednesday night’s 97-87 win against the Utah Jazz.\n\n“Brandon told him that he almost hurt him running through a screen. (Wallace) just plays hard, man,” said teammate Avery Bradley. “Me personally, it makes me want to do the same. That rubs off on everybody else when they watch somebody play like that. Even if they don’t notice it during the game, when they see it on film it will inspire them to go out there and play hard on both ends just like him.”\n\nIf you're starting to feel confused about whether Wallace is a leader, a malcontent or a locker room cancer, you have company. But let's talk about his nickname instead.\n\nBradley said he did not know about \"Crash\" until Wednesday, when Wallace – after scoring nine points and nine rebounds while coming off the Boston bench for the first time – shared the moniker with some of his teammates. And Bradley wasn’t alone among Celtics clueless of Wallace’s alias.\n\nGiven the widespread knowledge of his alternate title, Wallace considered it preposterous that nobody in the locker room seemed to know it.\n\n“All of them didn’t (know). Brandon asked me what was my nickname,” the 31-year old laughed. “That’s surprising. That’s very surprising.”\n\n“I never knew it,” said Bradley. “But that’s how he plays, man. He’s just an exciting player to watch play, and to play alongside with. He gives everything on the floor.”\n\nBecause I know you’ve all been waiting to hear the origins of the nickname, here goes.\n\n“We were in Charlotte, they took an online vote for that,” said Wallace. “It was Crash and The Force and something else. They had all kind of names, you’d be surprised.”\n\nThough “May The Force be with you” puns would have been cool,* Crash definitely fits better.\n\n*And by cool, I mean I wanted to slap myself for even thinking of that pun in the first place."
