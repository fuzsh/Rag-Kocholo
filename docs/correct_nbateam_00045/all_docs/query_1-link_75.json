        "text": "Jason Thompson's tenure as the homegrown 76er lasted 22 days.\n\nThe Sixers traded the Camden native, who played at Lenape High School, to the Golden State Warriors Friday for Gerald Wallace and a 2016 NBA draft consideration. The Sixers have the right to swap the lesser of the first-round picks from the Miami Heat and Oklahoma City Thunder with Golden State's first-rounder.\n\nThis transaction came after the Sixers officially acquired Thompson, Nik Stauskas and Carl Landry from the Sacramento Kings on July 10.\n\nHowever, the franchise had stated that it planned to keep Thompson this season when he was acquired.\n\nNow, the question is how long will the Sixers keep Wallace?\n\nThe Warriors acquired the 33-year-old along with Chris Babb from the Boston Celtics in exchange for David Lee in a deal that was completed Monday. Wallace will enter his 15th season in October after being the 25th overall pick by the Kings in 2001. The 6-foot-7, 215-pound forward played in just 36 games with zero starts last season in Boston.\n\nHe is set to make $10.1 million next season in the final year of his contract.\n\nWallace averaged a career-low 1.1 points to go with 1.8 rebounds in just 8.9 minutes of action this past season. The Alabama native played the role of the veteran mentor for the youthful Celtics.\n\nHowever, he has career averages of 11.9 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.4 steals in 832 regular-season games with the Kings, Charlotte Bobcats, Portland Trail Blazers, New jersey Nets, Brooklyn Nets and Celtics.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Sixers announced the signing of rookie power forward Richaun Holmes. He signed a multiyear deal with the first two seasons guaranteed. The 6-10, 245-pounder was selected 37th overall out of Bowling Green."
