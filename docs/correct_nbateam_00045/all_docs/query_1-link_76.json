        "text": "Jason Thompson was generally excited to be coming home when the 76ers acquired him from the Sacramento Kings on July 9. As it turns out, it was a short stay.\n\nThe product of South Jersey\"™s Lenape High and Rider University was traded Friday to the Golden State Warriors for Gerald Wallace and draft considerations.\n\nWallace, 33, has played 14 NBA seasons and was traded from Boston to Golden State on July 9. He is in the final year of a contract paying $10.1 million. Thompson has two years left on his deal, at $6.4 million and $6.8 million.\n\nKnown in his heyday as a top defensive player, Wallace averaged just 8.9 minutes in 32 games for the Celtics. He made just one appearance, totaling four minutes when Boston was swept in four games by Cleveland in the opening round of last season\"™s playoffs.\n\nThompson had played his first seven seasons with Sacramento before being traded twice within a month.\n\nThe Sixers also announced Friday that they have signed second-round draft choice Richaun Holmes, the 37th overall selection from Bowling Green. No terms were listed, but Realgm.com reports it is a multi-year deal with the first two seasons fully guaranteed.\n\nThe 6-foot-10, 245-pound Holmes was Bowling Green\"™s all-time leader in blocked shots with 244 and as a senior was named the Mid-American Conference Defensive Player of the Year. He averaged 14.7 points, 8.0 rebounds and 2.7 blocks as a senior.\n\nIn three Utah Jazz Summer League games for the Sixers, Holmes averaged 10 points and five rebounds in 17 minutes per game.\n\nThe Sixers had planned on playing Holmes in the Las Vegas Summer League, but he suffered a fractured elbow in Utah.\n\n\"”\"”\"”\n\nÂ©2015 The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."
