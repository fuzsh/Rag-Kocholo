        "text": "by Marcel Mutoni\n\nEnough to refuse to visit one despite pleas from his team’s medical staff.\n\n“Crash”, well, crashed yet again last night, and appeared to have badly injured his left knee. Doctors, teammates and fans thought he was done for the night; Wallace had other ideas.\n\nFrom the Charlotte Observer:\n\n“I think I kind of forced them’’ to let him play, Wallace said after coming back from a sprained left knee to push the Bobcats to a 104-88 victory over the Sacramento Kings.\n\n“They wanted me to go to the hospital. I’m sick of hospitals. The only time I want to go there is to say hi to the doctors.’’\n\nThursday he’ll give in to a magnetic resonance imaging of the knee, which he sprained with about three minutes left in the first half. Wallace slipped, rolled and clutched his knee, leaving coaches and teammates gasping at the potential ramifications.\n\nG-Wallace scored 14 of his 25 points following the knee scare, and kept the Bobcats’ Playoff chances alive.\n\nThough he gave local doctors one less patient to worry about last night, it remains to be seen just how much longer Crash can avoid the hospital going forward."
