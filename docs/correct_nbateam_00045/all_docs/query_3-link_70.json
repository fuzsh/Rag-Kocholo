        "text": "If the Charlotte Bobcats go on to lose their first-round playoff series against the Orlando Magic, it certainly won't be because of Gerald Wallace. Playing substantial postseason minutes for the first time in his career, the Bobcats' franchise player, first-time All-Star, and only remaining player from their expansion roster has delivered everything but a win; even a player of his considerable ability can't win a game on his own.\n\nBecause this is a Magic blog, and because Dan Devine, Henry Abbott, and Brett Callahan have all touched on Wallace's strong play already, I won't belabor the point. But I did want to highlight how well Wallace has played in this series, even in defeat.\n\nHis per-game averages of 20 points, 11.5 boards, 1.5 assists, and 2.5 blocks on 55% shooting are impressive enough, and prior to last night's games he was the only 20-and-10 guy also averaging at least 2 blocks. Also consider that Wallace was in a three-way tie for seventh on the postseason win shares list so far, with 0.5, despite the glaring fact that the Bobcats haven't won anything yet. Dwyane Wade is the next-highest player from a winless team on that list, with 0.3.\n\nPerhaps this chart can underscore Wallace's impact better than I can:\n\nPoss. Used Pts. Pts Per Poss. Wallace 32 40 1.250 Rest of\n\nBobcats 133 126 0.947\n\nOh, and he's turned the ball over just once, in 40 possessions, on a team that's coughed it up 37 times already.\n\nAnd now that I've posted this piece, he'll probably shoot 3-of-14 with 4 turnovers in this afternoon's game against the Magic, at which point you're more than welcome to laugh at me. Or, if you're superstitious, thank me."
