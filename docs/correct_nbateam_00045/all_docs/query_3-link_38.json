        "text": "The Alabama Sports Hall of Fame inducted eight new members Saturday night.\n\nThe Class of 2023 included 3 basketball legends, 3 gridiron greats, a multi-conference title-winning football coach and a former SEC golf coach.\n\nFormer Auburn Tiger Karlos Dansby, who played for the Tigers from 2000-03 and went on to a 14-year NFL career, was inducted along with former Crimson Tider and New Orleans Saint Roman Harper and former UAB Blazer and Atlanta Falcon star Roddy White. Dansby was a two-sport star at Woodlawn High. He chose football over basketball. He chose Auburn over Alabama.\n\n\"I had to stay in state. It was gonna be between Alabama and Auburn,\" Dansby, a first-team All-American linebacker, said. \"I wasn't leaving. I wanted to be able to come home and write my legacy and my history.\"\n\nHarper, who on more than one occasion during his playing days at Alabama bragged on his hometown of Prattville, was first team All-SEC safety in 2005. He went on to play on the Saints first ever Super Bowl Champion in Super Bowl XLIV.\n\n\"When it was all said and done with football the ultimate compliment somebody gives you is 'he was a pro.' And a lot of people said that about me,\" Harper said. \"That means I did it the right way. I showed up with the right attitude. I put the work in off the field. And I showed up on Sundays and played at the highest level.\"\n\nChildersburg native Gerald Wallace was a \"one-and-done\" at Alabama, entering the NBA Draft after his freshman season in 2001. He made the right choice. He finished with 9,993 points, 4,838 rebounds, and 1,725 assists over his 15-year NBA career.\n\n\"It shows the hard work and dedication I put in,\" Wallace said of his induction. \"All the dreams and everything, It shows an appreciation and it's a reward for putting in all the hard work and to be recognized and to become a Hall of Famer means that everything I've done over the years will be remembered for the rest of my life.\"\n\nJoining Wallace in the Class of 2023 was Theo Ratliff, a native of Demopolis who played his college ball at the University of Wyoming and then played 17 years in the NBA, finishing with 5,809 points, 4,596 rebounds, and 1,968 blocks.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n\"It's a tremendous honor,\" Ratliff said of his selection. \"With all the greats, Charles Barkley, Bo Jackson, the great Bear Bryant. You just name a few people you grew up watching on television and Hall of Famers., their sport and also coaching-wise. It's just a great honor to be standing beside them.\"\n\nAlso representing the heroes of the hardwood was Larry Kenon, a Birmingham native, who played for Memphis State, leading the Tigers to the 1973 National Championship Game. That season Kenon averaged more than 20 points per game, on 52.5% shooting, and led Memphis State in rebounding with 16.7 per game. Kenon was coached by the late, great legendary Gene Bartow, who went on to become the first coach in the history of UAB Basketball and also wound up in the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\"When you go to a school that has a mentor like Coach Gene Bartow, you're gonna learn the game.\" Kenon said. \"No matter how much talent you may have physically, you're going to learn the game of basketball. He's gonna teach you how to use the backboard. He's gonna teach you how to use the game on angles.\"\n\nAlso going was Jackie Sherrill, a member of the 1964 and 1965 National Championship teams at Alabama.
