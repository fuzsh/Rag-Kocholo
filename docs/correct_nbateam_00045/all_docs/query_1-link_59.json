        "text": "The Golden State Warriors said their good byes to David Lee and welcomed Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb to the Bay Area. The relationship with Wallace didn’t last long as the Warriors moved the veteran to Philadelphia for forward/center, Jason Thompson. Thompson has also been on the move as the Sacramento Kings traded the big man to sixers earlier in the offseason.\n\nThe announcement came from the Warriors official Twitter account:\n\nThe Sixers looking to rebuild also received cash and draft considerations. This move was quite the surprise. When Wallace was acquired, fans had reasons to believe that forward would be waived as a salary cap move. That didn’t happen and fans started to believe that Wallace would be see playing time in the upcoming season. If he does see time, it will be with the Sixers.\n\nAlong with Andrew Bogut, Draymond Green, and Festus Ezeli, Thompson will be a solid rim protector and rebounder. Thompson who is 29, has a solid career average of 9.4 points and 6.9 rebounds in about 27 minutes of play. He was the 12th overall pick of the 2008 NBA Draft and was selected by the Kings (played all seven seasons there). The Warriors have been quiet throughout the offseason but look to solidify their spot in the Western Conference."
