        "text": "GERALD_WALLACE_TIMBERWOLVES_PRESEASON.JPG\n\nBoston Celtics' Gerald Wallace, right, drives to the net as Minnesota Timberwolves' Corey Brewer defends during first quarter of an NBA preseason basketball game in Montreal, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2013.\n\n(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Graham Hughes)\n\nWALTHAM – With one exception being winning a championship, Boston Celtics veteran Gerald Wallace has experienced much of what the NBA can possibly offer.\n\nThe small forward was drafted by the Sacramento Kings 12 years ago as an inconsistent youngster just trying to establish a role; got completely (and allegedly) hosed in the 2002 Western Conference Finals, along with the rest of the Kings, by infamous referee Tim Donaghy; participated in one Slam Dunk contest (which he lost to Jason Richardson in 2002); shifted to the Charlotte Bobcats when the team selected him in the 2004 expansion draft; developed into an All-Star in Charlotte; and once, as a Portland Trail Blazer, drew Ron Artest’s rage.\n\nWallace has been traded, either alone or with others, for a Rookie of the Year (Damian Lillard), two Hall of Famers (Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett) and a package of Dante Cunningham, Sean Marks, Joel Pryzbilla and The 1st-Round Pick That Eventually Became Tobias Harris; responded to Artest's aforementioned fury with a series of hustle plays that encouraged \"Gerald Wallace\" chants from the Rose Garden crowd; played home games at the Barclays Center throughout the Nets' first season in Brooklyn; became known in some circles as Gerald Wallace, Contract of Death after starting a four-year, $40-million deal with his worst season in a decade; and has now resurfaced, with a tendency for brutally honest commentary, as one of the Celtics better players.\n\nAlso listed on Wallace’s resume is a most improbable feat which surely deserves its own paragraph, if not an exhibit in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: he led the Bobcats to the playoffs in 2009-10, the only season so far during which the team has exceeded 35 wins.\n\nSo when Wallace says he doesn’t really know what to expect from this year’s Celtics, understand he does so with many years of zany experiences shaping his powers of prediction.\n\n“I don’t know man. I honestly don’t know,” Wallace said after practice. “I’m looking for a surprise and hopefully it’s a good surprise. (Hopefully) we come out and understand the situation that we’re in, understand what we have to do as a team, as individuals, and start the season off on a good note.”\n\nThink about all the unknowns: Rajon Rondo’s return, Jared Sullinger’s conditioning, Kelly Olynyk’s adjustment to the NBA, Vitor Faverani’s consistency and Jordan Crawford’s existence, to name a few. Other uncertainties include whether Jeff Green can regain post-All-Star break 2013 form without Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, how many players president of basketball operations Danny Ainge will trade by this time next year, and the opening night starting lineup that will meet the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday. That game arrives one day from the time I hit publish on this post, yet the Celtics still don’t know their starters, or at least claim not to.\n\nWe know, or at least can guess with terrific confidence levels, that the Celtics will not win a championship – or come close to one – this season. But are we sure they will be awful? Could they potentially compete for a playoff berth? Would they trade down the standings if they threaten to become too successful? Obviously, a lot depends on Rondo. But you could sell me on any possibility between contending for the eighth seed and fighting the Philadelphia 76ers for this year’s Least Watchable League Pass Team award. If I’ve recently watched The Water Boy, you could probably even convince me to believe Rondo could return at halftime to lead an improbable Bourbon Bowl victory. Or you could tell me Ainge plans to deal Rondo; that would not shock me either.\n\n“It’s going to be exciting to see how the season starts off – to see how our guys are going to respond, especially to the first game in a situation like that; to see Coach Stevens in a real first NBA game and how he reacts, and how he responds,” said Wallace. “So it’s going to be intriguing and interesting to watch.”\n\nHe added, “We’ll find out Wednesday. I don’t know. We can sit here and speculate on anything that we think we’re going to be, or think we might want to be. But until we hit the court Wednesday and the real deal happens, we won’t know.”\n\nDuring two separate preseason rants against effort, Wallace pretty clearly suggested he does not consider the Celtics contenders. Actually, for fear of putting words in his mouth, I’ll provide his direct quote: “I think at the end of the day when they keep looking at the scoreboard and we’re getting our a--es kicked every night, some response has to come.”\n\nSo maybe Wallace does have expectations for the Celtics. Or maybe he’s just waiting for the games to count, so he can determine exactly what to make of all his young teammates.\n\n“We ain’t got no choice,” he said. “Ready or not, the season’s here. Regardless of how we feel about ourselves – individually, the team, regardless – we have 48 hours (until) tip-off.”\n\nLess than that now. But the message stands."
