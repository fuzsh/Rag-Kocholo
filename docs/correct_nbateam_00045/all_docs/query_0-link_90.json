        "text": "KA_2 said:\n\n^ Indeed, one of Petrie's few big blunders. He's not only putting up solid scoring and rebounding numbers, but he's up for his first All D team of his career (he's worthy of it), and is actually setting some statistical records; that is, he'll likely end the season as one of only a handful of players in NBA history to average 2+ spg and 2+ bpg.\n\nActually I think Geoff's made a number of blunders that were more his (Geoff's) fault. Where Geoff blew it, and I mean REALLY blew it with the Wallace situation was in not planning ahead to protect him from the expansion draft. Now that truly was one of his worst moves as a GM. A time when I and half this board flat out does the job better than he did. But as far as his talent assessmnet...he drafted Gerald. He (or the Maloofs in cost cutting mode) may have even let Jim Jackson walk to make room for Gerald in the rotation.\n\nNo...if there is a finger to point on the Gerald situation I think it is at Rick. Geoff screwed up and lost him in the expansion draft, but Rick was the shooting-centric coach with no place for an emerging hustling physical star in his rotation. It was exactly what that team needed.\n\nHndsmCelt said:\n\nBear in mind that when GW was a King he took him self out of his best game beceause he felt a carmp comming on... comming on mind you.\n\nI am so sick of hearing people pee and moan about that incident. (this isn't aimed at you particularly, celt, your position is pretty much the concensus around here.. you are just the one who said it this time)\n\nDidn't anyone see that game?\n\nTHe kid went from playing 2 minutes here and two minutes there to suddenly playing an entire half. And he played that half harder than I have ever seen ANY player play ANY half in ANY game I have ever seen in the nba. Bar none. He was feeling it and flying around EVERYWHERE. All players, even the notorious hard workers usually slow down a little to catch their breath in between explosions of activity. Not GW that game-- he was on full burn for the whole time he was in the game -- AND HE WASN'T USED TO GETTING ANY EXTENDED MINUTES.\n\nIs it at all surprising that that inexperienced player didn't hydrate correctly and gassed himself out in that situation?\n\nIf that WAS the reason the coaching staff held up for banishing him to the bench, then I am even more pissed than I was before about the whole situation (and make no mistake about it, I have been HIGHLY pissed about the situation for years now )\n\nBenching a player because he played tooo damn hard and gassed himself out. UNFARKINGLY STUPENDOUSLY IDIOTIC.... <if that was the case>\n\nFrankly, whether or not the coaching staff blamed Wallace for that inciden, THEY (the coaching staff) were the ones who blew chunks in that game for not FORCING him to take a blow and get some water and have something left for the second half.\n\nWallace handles the ball just fine. And he really doesn't have any problems getting to the rim; the only thing holding down his scoring average is his free throw shooting...\n\nWallace has set or tied career highs in every single statistical category this season, and is also averaging career numbers across the board, despite not playing much more than he did last season, so it puzzles me to see people try to act like he's only playing well every once in a while. Not only that but as has been pointed out several times before, he is the only player in the entire league averaging 2+ steals *and* 2+ blocks.\n\nAnd, he is averaging more than fourteen points a game.\n\nFor the benefit of people who are not in the local media area I think there is a little more to the situation. After Wallace was taken in the expansion draft by Charlotte Adelman along with Elston Turner spoke on 1140(local Kings station) about Wallace's questionable work habits. Now, if you know Adelman he is not going to dog anyone after their gone(even Jerome James with his ridiculous grabage bag comments).\n\nHowever, it was clear that the coaching staff did not believe Wallace would put in the required work to get to the next level. Sometimes, a player just needs a change of scenerey or to hear the message from someone new. So, yeah it was a screw up but I think there was a LITTLE more to it than meets the eye.\n\nKA_2 said:\n\n^ Indeed, one of Petrie's few big blunders.

Adelman & Petrie deserve the blame for this blunder. He's a great offensive coach, but he gives people playing time based on their offensive and more specifically shooting ability whereas Gregg Popavich & Larry Brown won't let anyone play unless they play defense."
