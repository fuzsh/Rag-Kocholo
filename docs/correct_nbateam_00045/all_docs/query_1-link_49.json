The team fell short of a second straight playoff appearance following a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans in the 8th seed game of the Play-In Tournament.\n\nIn recent years, the Kings have missed out on some superstars in the draft, but they have selected some of their current core players, such as De’Aaron Fox and Keegan Murray, in the top 5.\n\nFox has transform into one of the league’s top scorers years after getting selected fifth overall by the Kings in 2017. Murray was selected fourth overall in 2022 and is projected to be part of the Kings’ future.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the Kings’ most notable draft picks during the Sacramento era (1985 to present).\n\nKings’ first ever pick in Sacramento\n\nThe Kings’ first draft pick in the Sacramento era was Joe Kleine, who selected sixth overall in 1985.
