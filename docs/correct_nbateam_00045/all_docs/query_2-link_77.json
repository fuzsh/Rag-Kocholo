        "text": "Charlotte, NC (Sports Network) - The Charlotte Bobcats Tuesday selected 19 players in the NBA Expansion Draft, including forwards Gerald Wallace and Marcus Fizer.\n\nWallace, who had spent his first three seasons with Sacramento, has averaged 3.4 points and 2.1 rebounds in his career. The 6-7 University of Alabama product has only started nine games in his short career, but should see plenty of playing time with Charlotte.\n\nFizer, who was drafted by Chicago with the fourth overall pick in the 2000 NBA Draft, has been slowed by injuries throughout his career. During his four years with the Bulls, he has posted 10.5 points and 5.0 rebounds per outing.\n\nThe Bobcats also selected forwards Lonny Baxter from Washington and the Suns' Jahidi White; forward Jason Kapono from the Cavaliers and center Loren Woods from Miami.\n\nBaxter has produced 4.4 points while White has totaled 6.0 points per game in his career. Kapono scored 3.5 points per contest in his rookie season while Woods netted 3.2 points and grabbed 3.5 rebounds with Miami last year.\n\nOther players chosen by Charlotte were guard J.R. Bremer from Golden State; center Primoz Brezec from the Pacers; Hornets guard Maurice Carter; Portland forward Desmond Ferguson; guard Richie Frahm from Seattle; Celtics forward Brandon Hunter; forward Zaza Pachulia from the Magic; Utah forward Aleksandar Pavlovic; Lakers forward Jamal Sampson; New Jersey forward Tamar Slay; forward Theron Smith from the Timberwolves and Nuggets guard Jeff Trepagnier.\n\nOn Monday, the Bobcats made their first big personnel move as they traded up two spots with the Los Angeles Clippers to the second overall pick in Thursday's NBA Draft. Charlotte, which was originally slated to pick fourth in its first-ever draft, dealt that selection in addition to its second-round pick, 33rd overall, to obtain the No. 2 pick from the Clippers.\n\nThe Bobcats also agreed to select Predrag Drobnjak in the expansion draft from the Clippers, who were looking to unload the 6-11 center's contract.\n\nDrobnjak averaged 6.3 points and 3.2 rebounds in 61 games last season.\n\nThe number one pick in Thursday's NBA Draft belongs to the Orlando Magic, who are rumored to be looking at Connecticut's Emeka Okafor or high school phenom Dwight Howard."
