CHILDERSBURG, AL (WBRC) - Former NBA player Gerald Wallace held his 7th annual Gerald Wallace Basketball Camp at his high school alma mater, Childersburg High School.

More than 150 kids have participated in the two-week camp.

Wallace played 14 years in the NBA before injuries put a hold on his professional basketball career.

The former Alabama star was drafted by the Sacramento Kings in the first round (25th overall) of the 2001 NBA Draft. Since 2004, Wallace played with the Charlotte Bobcats, Portland Trailblazers, Brooklyn Nets, and Boston Celtics.

In 2010, as a member of the Bobcats, Wallace was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team.

Since then, Wallace holds an annual camp to give back to the Childersburg community. "Just being able to come back here and give back to my community, it's truly a blessing. I love sharing my knowledge of the game, and NBA experience to those who have hopes and dreams of one day playing at a higher level", Gerald Wallace said.
