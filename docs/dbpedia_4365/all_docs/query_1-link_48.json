        "text": "Although Sam Kinison tragically died in 1992 after being hit by a drunk driver, his legendary, game-changing comedy lives on in Sam Kinison’s Last Recorded Performance. His final official stand-up act took place at the Grove Theatre in Upland, California just two weeks before his passing. Now, Comedy Dynamics has released the enhanced audio version on iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, Google Play and all other digital retailers and streaming sites on September 23, 2016.\n\n“We are honored to be working on such an impactful comedy legacy project like this, and we hope comedy lovers everywhere enjoy it,” said Brian Volk-Weiss, President of Comedy Dynamics.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated comedian was best known for his trademark scream and raw humor. Rodney Dangerfield gave Kinison his first big break on an HBO comedy showcase in 1985. He went on to write and star in two high-rated HBO stand up specials; Breaking the Rules and Family Entertainment Hour. He also appeared in Rodney Dangerfield: It’s Not Easy Bein’ Me, Saturday Night Live, Married With Children, In Living Color and the feature film Back To School. Along with being voted onto Comedy Central’s All-Time Top 20 Stand-Up Comedians list and VH-1’s Top Comedians list, fellow comedians Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Richard Pryor, Larry King, Howard Stern, Johnny Carson, Tim Matheson, and Tom Lykis, were not shy about singing his praises. Kinison was killed tragically by a drunk driver at the age of 38."
