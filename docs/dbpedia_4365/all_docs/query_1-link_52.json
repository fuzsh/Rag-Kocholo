        "text": "Samuel Burl Kinison (December 8, 1953 â€“ April 10, 1992) was an American stand-up comedian and actor. He gained fame for his intense and controversial comedic style, which involved sudden tirades and his distinctive scream. Kinison started his career performing for free but eventually became a regular at The Comedy Store, where he befriended comedians like Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. Known for his crass observational humor, he quickly rose to popularity and appeared on shows like The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Late Night with David Letterman, and Saturday Night Live. Kinison's life tragically ended in a car crash at the peak of his career. He received a Grammy nomination in 1988 and a posthumous win in 1994 for his comedy albums.\n\nOn August 27, 2024, Sam Kinison had 2,252 Wikipedia visits, making him the #2,721 most popular actor online."
