        "text": "Eatery and Spirits\n\nNOTE: Kinison's is now CLOSED.\n\nA new restaurant in Southern California, dedicated to the memory of the last great genius of stand-up comedy, Sam Kinison.\n\nA former Pentecostal preacher, Sam trailblazed a new, confrontational style of comedy in the eighties and nineties, at once loud and edgy, while still personal and deeply introspective. Since his tragic death in 1992, no one has stepped forward to take his place in the entertainment pantheon, and his loss is felt to this day.\n\n\"He was always pushing the limits. Always going too far and speaking too freely. But that was Sam's appeal. People never knew what he might say next. Sometimes even Sam didn't know. He opened his mouth and outrageousness just came out.\"\n\n-- From the book \"Brother Sam,\" by Bill Kinison, with Steve Delsohn.\n\nThe restaurant is owned and operated by Bill Kinison, author of the terrific book \"Brother Sam\" (watch for the film version by producer David Permut).\n\n\"Sam Kinison was one of our generation's greatest stand-up comics, and since the day he died I've wished I could hear those hoarse tones again.\"\n\n-- Howard Stern, from the book \"Brother Sam,\" by Bill Kinison, with Steve Delsohn.\n\n\"He was like a comedy combination of Chuck Yeager and Evel Knievel.\"\n\n-- Robin Williams, to \"Rolling Stone.\"\n\nThe bar and dining area feature mementos from Sam's brilliant career, including coats and robes, his guitars, posters from his concerts and films, and, most importantly, booze.\n\n\"His performance style was overpowering, with his screaming and wildman appearance, and it disturbed a lot of people. But to me the screaming was eloquent. It was a vent of rage. It added power and depth to his material.\"\n\n-- Richard Belzer, to \"Entertainment Weekly.\"\n\n\"He'll definitely be remembered, because somebody that wild and funny you don't forget.\"\n\n-- Rodney Dangerfield to \"Rolling Stone.\"\n\nCome on in and say hi to Bill and his family -- and thank him for keeping Sam's memory alive!\n\nJackets and T-shirts available.\n\n155 North 2nd Avenue, Upland, California, U.S.A., 91786; Phone # (909) 982-6042\n\nThe Words of Sam Kinison\n\n\"At restaurants and bars, Sam picked up every check in sight. At Spago, Chasen's, Dan Tana's, the Palm, first he'd gorge his friends on huge meals. Then he'd ask the waiter or waitress, 'What's the largest tip you ever had?' Then Sam would always double it.\"\n\n-- From the book \"Brother Sam,\" by Bill Kinison, with Steve Delsohn.\n\n(We put that in for the restaurant staff -- hint, hint.)\n\nReturn to COMEDY ON TAP"
