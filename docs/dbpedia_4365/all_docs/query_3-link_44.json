        "text": "Not long after World War II, veteran psychologist Dr. Bertram Forer ran into a nightclub graphologist—a man who claimed to read people’s personalities from their handwriting. The entertainer offered to interpret Forer’s penmanship. The psychologist declined. The man persisted, emphasizing that his insights into the human psyche were uncannily accurate. “How do you know?” Forer asked. “My clients all tell me,” the performer reported. Dr. Forer sent him on his way. But their interaction started cogs turning. Dr. Forer had an intriguing idea for a demonstration for his Introductory Psychology class.\n\nThis chapter links facets of personality, and other individual differences among people, to aspects of their sense of humor, including the way that they use comedy in their lives and the kinds of jokes they generate and appreciate. The study of personality back in the 1940s had grown quite convoluted. It had started in ancient times, when Hippocrates, of the legendary oath, proposed four temperaments. Unfortunately, they were also called “four humors.” He thought that personality arose from different proportions of fluids in the body, creating a popular link between personality and physiology. A model with that kind of simplicity would be ideal, but these four temperaments failed to account for important aspects of the way people behave. Unfortunately, theorists went from the extremely simple to the extremely complicated. Famous philosophers, including Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant, all elaborated on the Hippocratic humors in an attempt to explain human dispositions. By the late 1800s, Sir Francis Galton, brilliant half-cousin of Charles Darwin and noted polymath, reasoned that any important aspect of personality ought to make it into the language. He fashioned a taxonomy based on a dictionary (Caprara & Cervone, 2000).\n\nGordon Allport, the same guy who showed that we all think we’re funnier than average, identified almost 18,000 words in the English language that described people. At least 4,000 referred to personality traits (Allport & Odbert, 1936). Organizing all of these words into manageable groups was generating a ton of debate. One researcher’s mathematical wizardry condensed the thousands of terms into 16 factors that had the potential to describe everyone (Cattell, 1946). This feat has adherents today. Sadly, 16 factors lack the simplicity that would make them as helpful as possible. Further, the model doesn’t always fit data. It’s great for trait words, but when people report on their own behaviors, the 16 factors don’t quite fit. The quest for a simpler approach continued, but Dr. Forer and others could see trouble ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the thought that one’s sense of humor and personality must be related retained its intuitive appeal. It seems obvious that people who laugh often, tell jokes, and generate witty remarks must differ from those who don’t. Goethe (1920/2000) said, “Men show their characters in nothing more clearly than in what they think laughable.” A few theorists even suggested that asking clients about their favorite jokes or their interpretations of cartoons might help psychological diagnosis and treatment (Strother, Barnett, & Apostolakos, 1954; Zwerling, 1955). Fortunately, we have more reliable and valid techniques. A handful of researchers have done in-depth personality assessments of professional comedians, comedy writers, and humorists of various sorts. The most common personality profile for these successful comics appears below. It may seem remarkably detailed, but research of this type often consists of questionnaires and interviews that include hundreds of questions and hours of probing. As an experiment, see if this personality profile applies to you.\n\nAn Assessment Report for a Successful Comic\n\nYou tend to show a calm, self-assured, serene kind of stability. This often masks an inner tumult. You are prone to a certain cynicism about being a part of a group. You even show a mild dislike of people who seem to prefer following the crowd. These feelings can be particularly strong when you notice a close friend trying to gain other people’s approval. This inclination has led you to feel like an outsider in many situations, a role you find yourself taking more often than you had anticipated. On occasion, you defend this role even when it might not be in your best interest, sometimes leading you to consciously avoid being a part of groups, organizations, or institutions. At certain times, you have rebelled against authorities of one kind or another even when you knew they were correct. This role as an outsider can create long, private periods of self-examination.\n\nThese periods of self-examination and of having a strong sense for preferences have had an impact on your relationships. At times, you like to gossip a bit, but you are capable of keeping a secret. You are also an extremely attentive and sympathetic listener when you want to be. You are currently tempted by a dream that may not be very realistic, including fantasies about a perfect relationship, which can get in the way of your current happiness. It makes sense for you to acknowledge your attachment to a specific outcome. You can then work on making it less important by appreciating other domains where you are succeeding. Your relationships with your family can be conflicted and may be currently a bit strained.\n\nYou relish your time alone, despite moments of loneliness. This contrasts sharply with your remarkable ability to appear very engaged socially, which leads to times where you seem to be the life of the party, the person who keeps conversation flowing, or the one who holds a group together. This can sometimes feel like a façade. In fact, though you have many close acquaintances, the number of people whom you view as dear friends is relatively small. You have developed a dry sense of humor that seems to engage others and attract people. At times, this aspect of wit moves so quickly that you make jokes that go over other people’s heads. Either these people are unappreciative of nuance or they do not have sufficient background information to understand your broad range of references. Nevertheless, you take considerable pleasure in this ability and often find yourself rehearsing remarks in an effort to seem spontaneous in your entertainment of others. Although you occasionally feel awkward when you catch yourself doing this sort of thing, it is consistent with your desires and aims and you rarely let it get out of hand or interfere with more important pursuits.\n\nLinks Between Personality and Sense of Humor: What’s it all for?\n\nThe complicated links between one’s personality and sense of humor reveal a few recurring themes. First, if personality itself has anything to offer the study of behavior, the personality measures must do better than standard Barnum statements that describe practically anyone. If a trait applies equally to everybody, it can’t help us explain individual differences in humor or anything else interesting. In addition, “sense of humor” appears to be more of a folk concept than a scientific term. Everyone claims to have a sense of humor, even if no one can quite define it. Our stereotypes of those with a good sense of humor are all generally positive. In additon, one’s sense of humor, whatever it is, clearly has different components. The appreciation and production of jokes and gags may say a lot about someone’s sense of humor, but the two don’t correlate with each other. A dispositional tendency to see the funny sides of things or a propensity toward cheerfulness, good mood, and seriousness may contribute to our view of jokes and the world, too. These might not, however, relate to appreciating and generating punch lines.\n\nThe way that people use humor relates to other important things that we think, say, feel, and do. Some people use comedy to deal with stress. Some make jokes to lash out at others or bring them together, build themselves up, or tear themselves down. These acts likely come from different people and create different worlds for all of them. Extraverted, sensation-seeking folks like humor of all types, including nonsense and sexual jokes. Authoritarian, fundamentalist, serious folks like humor less and prefer incongruity-resolution gags to nonsense jokes. Extraverted people who are open to experience seem to create funnier jokes. Professional stand-up comedians are particularly high in openness to experience, might be less extraverted than we think, and might not make the most conscientious bookkeepers. The jokes that make people chuckle, the ones that they tell, and the ones that they make up themselves might predict a lot about who they are and what they do.\n\nBut what’s the point? Humor might predict a lot about us—how we spend our leisure time, create good work, attract mates, and stay healthy. But one’s sense of humor correlates with important aspects of personality. With that in mind, we have to interpret any potential benefits of humor with caution. If we’re all set to prove the wonders of wit, we have to make sure that any fortune and delight it might cause doesn’t really arise from simpler aspects of personality. For example, intriguing studies of humor link it to personal ingenuity. Humor and creativity relate to each other in curious ways. But both are also correlated with extraversion and intelligence. Do these findings actually say something important about humor and creative work, or does personality really explain everything? Let’s take a close look at this literature with these cautions in mind. Otherwise, we’re back in Forer’s classroom getting fooled by Barnum statements."
