        "text": "Sam Kinison was a popular stand-up comedian from Yakima, Washington, mainly active in the 1980s and the early 1990s. He also had a few acting roles in film and television. His only recurring role was that of Hugh, the main character's alter ego in the short-lived sitcom \"Charlie Hoover\" (1991). The series only lasted 7 episodes. Kinison had previously worked as a Pentecostal preacher, and his comedy routine incorporated sudden tirades and distinctive screams in the style of charismatic preachers. Kinison was noted for a tendency to use black comedy, and to often satirize Christian evangelist scandals.\n\nIn 1953, Kinison was born in Yakima, Washington. The city's economy is mostly based on agriculture. Yakima is the primary producer of hops in the United States, a key ingredient in the production of beer. Kinison's parents were the Pentecostal preacher Samuel Earl Kinison and his wife Marie Florence Morrow. Samuel \"pastored several churches \" throughout the United States, never settling for long in one place and always earning a meager income.\n\nIn 1956, Kinison was accidentally hit by a truck. He survived the accident, but suffered brain damage. His childhood was otherwise uneventful until 1964, when his parents divorced. Marie gained custody over Kinison, despite the boy's protestations. Kinison decided to follow in his father's footstep's, training to become a preacher.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1969, Kinison attended the \"Pinecrest Bible Training Center\", an unaccredited bible school located in Salisbury Center, New York. From 1970 to 1977, Kinison was employed as a preacher. He reportedly used a typical \"fire and brimstone\" style in his sermons, punctuated with shouting. Like his father, Kinison earned a meager income and struggled with poverty.\n\nDeciding to change his career path and become a comedian, Kinison moved to Houston, Texas. He found work at the Houston-based comedy club \"Comedy Workshop\" (1978-early 1990s). He received training at the Workshop's school for improvisational comedic actors, and joined the club's team of \"Texas Outlaw Comics\". The team reportedly was intended to consist of comedians \"who speak their minds\" and \"who aren't interested in selling out.\"\n\nIn 1980, Kinison decided to move to Los Angeles. He wanted to be hired by the West Hollywood-located comedy club \"The Comedy Store\" (1972-), where young comedians received press exposure and had a shot of appearing in HBO's \"Young Comedians\" television specials.\n\nKinison was initially hired as a doorman by \"The Comedy Store\", but eventually started performing as a comedian again. While struggling to find work, Kinnison reportedly developed addictions to both cocaine and alcohol. He hired his brother Bill as his manager.\n\nKinison's big break came when he was chosen as one of 8 performers in the \"The 9th Annual Young Comedians Special\" (1985). Most of the featured performers failed to impress the critics of the day, but Kinison won praise for voicing the frustrations of a typical married man in his routine. Kinison was next featured as a guest on the talk show \"Late Night with David Letterman\", and was cast in a supporting role in the comedy film \"Back to School\".\n\nKinison was at the height of his popularity by 1989. He was cast in the role of an angel in an episode of then-popular sitcom \"Married... with Children\" (1987-1997). In 1990, he had a role in the horror anthology series \"Tales from the Crypt\" (1989-1996). In 1991, he had a co-starring role in the sitcom \"Charlie Hoover\" (1991). The series' premise was that Charlie was a depressed, middle-aged office worker who is confronted by his own alter ego, who convinces him to turn his life around.\n\nHaving divorced twice, on April 4, 1992 Kinison married his long-time girlfriend Malika Souiri. She worked as a dancer. Following the wedding, the couple vacationed in Hawaii for 5 days. They returned to Los Angeles on April 10, as Kinison had to prepare for a performance at the Riverside Resort Hotel and Casino of Laughlin, Nevada. Later that day, Kinison's Pontiac Trans Am was \"struck head-on\" by a pick-up truck. The driver of the other vehicle was an inebriated 17-year-old boy.\n\nKinnison was found dead at the scene, with his head having smashed his car's windshield. At the time of the accident, Kinnison was not wearing his seat belt. He was 38-years-old at the the time of his death. His wife was also injured at the accident, but was able to recovered at a hospital. The driver responsible for the death pled guilty to charges of \"vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence\". He was sentenced to a single year of probation and 300 hours of community service.\n\nKinison was buried in a family grave plot at Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1993, archival footage of him was used for the television special \"A Tribute to Sam Kinison\". Kinnison's brother Bill wrote a biography of him, called \"Brother Sam: The Short, Spectacular Life of Sam Kinison\". Despite a relatively short career, Kinnison has been fondly remembered. He has been cited as an influence by other comedians."
