        "text": "Meet the man The New Yorker magazine dubbed “GOD’S COMIC”. In an 8-page article, The New Yorker magazine says that Brad’s “style is frantic, aggressive, and caustic, with echoes of Robin Williams, Sam Kinison, and George Carlin.” His unique style, forged in the comedy clubs he performed in early in his career, features sarcasm, biting wit and intelligence. With an energetic approach and no topics off limits, he is the only comic that uses his Judeo/Christian worldview for social commentary and pointing out laughable faith-based everyday experiences. This was unheard of 25 years ago in the Christian comedy genre, and still is to this day!\n\nBrad Stine is known as the man that revolutionized and launched the new era of Christian comedy in America with his breakout album “Put A Helmet On!” that single-handedly redefined the way Christian stand-up comedy could be perceived and performed.\n\nHis cutting edge methods literally opened the door for many Christian comics that would follow. Many of whom have acknowledged his influence including Tim Hawkins, John Crist, and Michael Jr and a host of others whose careers and styles have been impacted by Brad Stine.\n\nHe is also the most media covered Christian comedian in the country being featured in mainstream media outlets unlike any Christian comic before or since. Because Brad sees his comedy as being a missionary to America, Brads calling is to bring the gospel in unique ways to influence the cultural narrative.\n\nHe tours nationally on a regular basis performing in clubs, churches, and fundraisers for Crisis pregnancy centers, ministries and conservative causes and candidates.\n\nBrad has been a regular live social commentator on Fox & Friends every Monday morning for six months. He has been featured in the New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today. He has been profiled on NBC Nightly News, HBO, Showtime, CNN, Glenn Beck, Hannity and Colmes, NPR’S Fresh Air, ABC Nightline TWICE, MTV, and Comedy Central. He has had material published in Readers Digest and Focus on the Family magazine.\n\nBrad has been featured in the New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today.
