        "text": "So this is your second time in Peoria, what do you think of The River City?\n\nI want to move to Peoria. Great wi-fi, skinny mirrors, IHOP. Oh, and the people are real! By the way, I did not know it was called The River City.\n\nAny places that you've been to in Peoria that were memorable experiences?\n\nThe Jukebox Comedy Club! Our mutual friends, the band The Handcuffs brought me to a really cool store called: Younger Than Yesterday.\n\nHow were the crowds and shows at the Jukebox Comedy Club?\n\nSmall but phenomenal! My favorite audiences ever! For the record, size does not matter unless we're talking earthquakes.\n\nHow and when did you decide you wanted to do stand-up comedy?\n\nI was doing psych research at Harvard Medical School and decided to take a class at night for fun at The Cambridge Center for Adult Education called \"How To Be A Stand-Up Comedian.\" I was hooked. I had always been theatrical and in the musicals at school and camp, but I'd never done stand-up.\n\nDo you remember your first time on stage?\n\nYes. I got off stage and a friend from the class said, “Nobody could hear a word you were saying.” But I didn’t care.\n\nYour style and cadence is unique and unlike anything else in comedy. Did you consciously develop your dialogue style or is it something that just came natural?\n\nI didn’t like being on stage in silence, so I would just keep adding tag lines, and I guess that’s how my style came to be.\n\nWhat's the writing process like for you when you're coming up with new material for your act?\n\nI try to think of funny things all day for Twitter and Facebook. My newest joke wrote itself—because it really happened. I had just woken up and I had no idea where I was, but I knew I wasn’t at home because somebody was vacuuming. Sometimes I just write down what my husband says in his sleep.\n\nOne thing that I really enjoyed at Friday's show was the interaction that you have with the audience. You really got some of them involved and it was total improv that worked great. Do you do this at every show or does it depend on the audience?\n\nI love talking to the audience because then they realize I’m not just reciting lines but thinking on my feet—literally. It makes the audience feel like a community—they’re all in on the inside joke. I love when other comedians do this—Paula Poundstone is the best.\n\nYou've appeared on the Tonight Show with both Jay Leno and Johnny Carson as hosts. I've heard comedians say that it really changes your career after you did it when Carson was the host. What was your experience like?\n\nI still get nervous thinking about it (May 10, 1991). The experience was surreal. I had only been doing comedy for 6 years, which sound like a lot, but is nothing in comedian time. Johnny gave me the AOK sign, but it wasn’t caught on camera. Johnny heard that I was upset about this, and CAME TO MY DRESSING ROOM! With ED McMAHON! At which point I almost fainted. They were both so complimentary and tall. My life didn’t change dramatically after\n\nthat, although that's when I quit my day job in Boston and moved to L.A., but I love that I will always have been on the Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson!\n\nAfter the show on Friday at the Jukebox, I saw a couple come up to have their picture taken with you and they were doing some of your act for you. Is that weird when that happens?\n\nI love it. Except if they yell out a punchline if I'm on stage.\n\nWho and what inspired you in the past and present?\n\nPAST: Steven Wright, Lily Tomlin, Carol Burnett, Garry Shandling, David Letterman, Joan Rivers, Roseanne, Barbra Streisand, The Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nPRESENT: Jake Johannsen, Kira Soltanovitch, Tina Fey, Chris Rock, Brian Kiley. (Jake Johannsen will be at The Jukebox in a few weeks!)\n\nHow do you handle hecklers and/or rude drunken idiots in the crowd?\n\nEjecto seat.\n\nYou were in the movie, The Aristocrats. What was that experience like?\n\nWell, three guys came to my house and filmed me telling the Aristocrats joke. I wanted to be part of the documentary, but I did not want to tell the joke. So I sort of told it backwards. I saw the movie in a theater and was completely thrilled when my punchline got a laugh.\n\nOutside of your stand-up act, are you working on anything special these days?\n\nMy husband and I are writing a musical about stand-up comedy called HOME ON TUESDAY (cause even though I travel a lot, I’m always home on Tuesday). I’m also auditioning for America’s Got Talent at the end of April! Oh, and I'm always doing laundry—though I don't know how special that is.\n\nDo you have any advice for people that are just starting in the world of stand-up comedy?\n\nThe stand-up world is different than it was 29 years ago when I started, but one thing remains: Perform as much as humanly possible. Nothing replaces experience. And also try a new joke every time you go onstage. That is the advice I wish someone had given to me!"
