        "text": "The Out of Control tour bus sits idling in the rain in front of L.A.’s Sunset Hyatt. On tour with Kinison are the Outlaws of Comedy — LaBove, Mitchell Walters and Allan Stephan — as well as three aspiring comics. Today, they are heading out to Riverside, a two-hour drive; everyone else is aboard, but Kinison is over an hour late. Tardiness is one of his most incurable vices. In San Diego he slept right up until going onstage — then gave a stellar performance.\n\nHe finally shows up, and the bus gets rolling. Someone pops in a tape of the Traveling Wilburys, and everybody starts singing along with “Tweeter and the Monkey Man,” a tongue-in-cheek song about two outlaw partners on the lam: “When the walls came down/All the way to hell…”\n\nFor many years, Kevin Kinison was Sam’s favorite outlaw partner. Never a preacher or a comic, he worked odd jobs in clothing stores, sometimes stealing clothes for Sam to wear onstage. Kevin looked up to Sam and was always in the audience for his shows and partied with him to all hours.\n\nLast May, Kevin, then twenty-eight, had just gotten out of his second rehab program, paid for by Sam, and was on a prescribed lithium treatment. Sam himself seemed to feel the need to slow down. He’d exhausted himself doing a flurry of shows to get himself out of debt. He organized a convention of preachers who had influenced his style; it was to be held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where his mother and stepfather live and preach. Kinison flew in many of his comedian friends to witness the event. Then, during the gathering, Kevin walked calmly into his parents’ house, took out a gun and shot himself in the head.\n\nKinison blames the rehab programs, which, he says, “dealt with Kevin chemically instead of dealing with his inner pain. Now people will never know what it was. I don’t even know if he knew.”\n\nThe night after the funeral, Kinison began five straight nights of previously booked comedy gigs in New Jersey, feeling work would be therapeutic. Onstage, he raised a glass to toast Kevin and made a joke, warning Liberace’s ghost, “You dead fag! Stay away from my brother!”\n\nAfter the Jersey shows, Kinison says, Kevin’s death “really caught up with me. It was like drug-and-alcohol weekend. I was fucking blown out.” Comedy Store owner Mitzi Shore says she’d arranged a wake for Kevin that Robin Williams and Roseanne Barr were going to attend, but Kinison missed his plane, and it was canceled. When he finally arrived back in L.A., he went to the Store looking for a comic who had allegedly said, “It’s probably because of Sam’s lifestyle that Kevin took his life.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nUnable to find the man, Kinison led his cronies on a reckless crusade, beating up another comic and trashing an apartment. When he returned to the Store the next day to apologize, he found Shore talking to the police about his drug problem, and he stalked out, swearing never to return.\n\nOnce again Kinison has chosen to see things in black-and-white terms. After considering the Comedy Store his home for eight years, he now refers to it as the Comedy Sewer, and he made sure that a billboard for Have You Seen Me Lately? was placed directly across Sunset Boulevard from the club.\n\nKinison is adamant that he’s got his vices under control. “I’ve never had a problem distinguishing what drugs are — a substitute for life,” he says. “I’ve never allowed them or booze to be more important than what you have to do. The people that have real problems are the ones who can’t distinguish that a line of coke is just a party thing. To make it more important is really dangerous.”\n\nYet Kinison’s oversize image continues to haunt him. He attributes some of his bad rep in Hollywood to the fact that he pissed off the wrong people — the powerful Creative Artists Agency and its head, Michael Ovitz — by losing them their percentages on Atuk. “They’re business people,” he says, “not artists. I’m not going to be their fucking bitch, man. Let them get that from the other pussies. I know Mike Ovitz and all those guys think they’re such big fucking badasses. Well, my message to them is, Fuck you, I don’t need any of you, and I’ll do concerts the rest of my life, and videos, until somebody that makes movies is smart enough to say, ‘A Kinison movie would make money.’ I think we have the potential to deliver a film with the impact of The Blues Brothers.\n\n“When you hang a man, you better be sure he’s dead,” Kinison says, fuming. “I’m not going away. We’re coming after your fucking asses, you losers, to show you what comedy’s about. Taking all your fucking money and offices, and you can park our cars.”\n\nThe rain continues, and the tour bus moves at a funereal pace on the clogged freeway. Kinison moves to the front of the bus and stands in the stairwell, leaning forward, his face up at the windshield. “I love this,” he says. “One of my dad’s last jobs before he became a minister, he drove a bus. When I was a little kid, I used to go along for the rides. This is my favorite place to be on the bus. It feels like you’re in the pilot’s seat.”\n\nRelated\n\nPiloting this merry band of foulmouthed wisecrackers, however, isn’t as fulfilling for Kinison as it might seem. What he misses is, he says, “how good preaching used to make people feel. I mean, comedy’s fun, people laugh, but I don’t know if that makes them feel good about themselves. No. Let me put it this way. You can make ’em laugh, but you can’t make ’em happy. It takes God to do that.”\n\nSuddenly, there’s a break in the traffic. “All right!” says Sam Kinison. “We sacrificed a couple of cats. Crank up ‘Tweeter,’ roll a few, and let’s rock & roll.”"
