        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA – Comedy Dynamics has acquired exclusive rights to the Sam Kinison Collection of broadcast specials, home-movies, the Grammy award-winning album and rarely seen footage for broadcast, video, digital platforms for 2016.\n\nRobin William’s called Kinison; ‘the cuddly anti-Christ’, Howard Stern said that ‘Sam was one of our generation’s greatest stand-up comics’. Sam Kinison’s legacy lives on through this collection of stand-up broadcast specials and albums. The exclusive content includes two one-hour outrageous HBO specials, a 90-minute tribute hosted by Rodney Dangerfield, and rare/unreleased footage and images.\n\nBill Kinsion, Sam’s brother, manager and the executor of the Kinison estate stated that Sam was absolutely fearless. “Most people go to the edge and then stop. Not Sam. He’d see the edge and then just keep going. Sam was a white Richard Pryor; a preacher-turned-comedian; a primal screamer who shrieked for our sins.” Sam was known as the ‘rock-and-roll comic…popularized by his ‘Wild Thing’ music video with Billy Idol, Bon Jovi and other rock legends!”\n\nThe Grammy-nominated comedian was best known for his trademark scream and raw humor. Rodney Dangerfield gave Kinison his first big break on an HBO comedy showcase in 1985. He went on to write and star in two high-rated HBO stand up specials; Breaking the Rules and Family Entertainment Hour. He also appeared in Rodney Dangerfield: It’s Not Easy Bein’ Me, Saturday Night Live, Married With Children, In Living Color and the feature film Back To School. Along with being voted onto Comedy Central’s All-Time Top 20 Stand-Up Comedians list and VH-1’s Top Comedians list, fellow comedians Robin Williams, Jay Leno, Richard Pryor, Larry King, Howard Stern, Johnny Carson, Tim Matheson, and Tom Lykis, were not shy about singing his praises.\n\nKinison’s content is available for all media, worldwide, except where already licensed.\n\n“Kinison was always one-of-a-kind,” says Brian Volk-Weiss President of Comedy Dynamics. “His energy was wild and maintains the same power to this day.”\n\nComedy Dynamics is the largest independent comedy production and distribution company in North America, working with a wide range of established and emerging comedic talent including Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Jim Gaffigan, Bill Burr, Chelsea Peretti, Katt Williams and many more. The Comedy Dynamics catalog is available on several video streaming platforms including, but not limited to: Hulu, Roku, iOS, Amazon, and Android. In 2015, the company launched its first original series, Coming To The Stage, which serves as a launching pad for aspiring comedians.\n\nSchwartz & Company exclusively represents rights to the Sam Kinison estate, including name, likeness and all intellectual content."
