        "text": "Highly influential, and always controversial, African-American actor/comedian who was equally well known for his colorful language during his live comedy shows, as for his fast paced life, multiple marriages and battles with drug addiction. He has been acknowledged by many modern comic artist's as a key influence on their careers, and Pryor's observational humor on African-American life in the USA during the 1970s was razor sharp brilliance.\n\nHe was born Richard Franklin Lennox Pryor III on December 1, 1940, in Peoria, Illinois, the son of Gertrude L. (Thomas) and LeRoy \"Buck Carter\" Pryor. His mother, a prostitute, abandoned him when he was ten years of age, after which he was raised in his grandmother's brothel. Unfortunately, Pryor was molested at the age of six by a teenage neighbor, and later by a neighborhood preacher. To escape this troubled life, the young Pryor was an avid movie fan and a regular visitor to local movie theaters in Peoria. After numerous jobs, including truck driver and meat packer, the young Pryor did a stint in the US Army between 1958 & 1960 in which he performed in amateur theater shows. After he left the services in 1960, Pryor started singing in small clubs, but inadvertently found that humor was his real forte.\n\nPryor spent time in both New York & Las Vegas, honing his comic craft. However, his unconventional approach to humor sometimes made bookings difficult to come by and this eventually saw Pryor heading to Los Angeles. He first broke into films with minor roles in The Busy Body (1967) and Wild in den Straßen (1968). However, his performance as a drug addicted piano player in Lady Sings the Blues (1972), really got the attention of fans and film critics alike.\n\nHe made his first appearance with Gene Wilder in the very popular action/comedy Trans-Amerika-Express (1976), played three different characters in Wie geht's aufwärts? (1977) and portrayed real-life stock-car driver \"Wendell Scott\" in Stock Car Race - Höllenjagd auf heißen Pisten (1977). Proving he was more than just a comedian, Pryor wowed audiences as a disenchanted auto worker who is seduced into betraying his friends and easy money in the Paul Schrader working class drama Blue Collar - Kampf am Fließband (1978), also starring Yaphet Kotto and Harvey Keitel. Always a strong advocate of African-American talent, Pryor next took a key role in The Wiz - Das zauberhafte Land (1978), starring an all African-American cast, including Diana Ross and Michael Jackson, retelling the story of Das zauberhafte Land (1939). His next four screen roles were primarily cameos in Das verrückte California Hotel (1978); Muppet Movie (1979); Oh, Moses! (1980) and Dreist und gottesfürchtig (1980). However, Pryor teamed up with Gene Wilder once more for the prison comedy Zwei wahnsinnig starke Typen (1980), which did strong box office business.\n\nHis next few films were a mixed bag of material, often inhibiting Pryor's talent, with equally mixed returns at the box office. Pryor then scored second billing to Christopher Reeve in the big budget Superman III - Der stählerne Blitz (1983), and starred alongside fellow funny man John Candy in Zum Teufel mit den Kohlen (1985) before revealing his inner self in the autobiographical Jo Jo Dancer - Dein Leben ruft (1986). Again, Pryor was somewhat hampered by poor material in his following film ventures. However, he did turn up again in Die Glücksjäger (1989) with Gene Wilder, but the final product was not as sharp as their previous pairings. Pryor then partnered on-screen with two other very popular African-American comic's. The legendary Redd Foxx and 1980s comic newcomer Eddie Murphy starred with Pryor in the gangster film Harlem Nights (1989) which was also directed by Eddie Murphy. Having contracted multiple sclerosis in 1986, Pryor's remaining film appearances were primarily cameos apart from his fourth and final outing with Gene Wilder in the lukewarm Das andere Ich (1991), and his final appearance in a film production was a small role in the David Lynch road flick Lost Highway (1997).\n\nFans of this outrageous comic genius are encouraged to see his live specials Richard Pryor: Live and Smokin' (1971); the dynamic Richard Pryor: Live in Concert (1979); Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip (1982) and Richard Pryor... Here and Now (1983). In addition, The Richard Pryor Show (1977) is a must-have for any Richard Pryor fans' DVD collection.\n\nUnknown to many, Pryor was a long time advocate against animal cruelty, and he campaigned against fast food chains and circus shows to address issues of animal welfare. He was married a total of seven times, and fathered eight children.\n\nAfter long battles with ill health, Richard Pryor passed away on December 10th, 2005.\n\nLenny Bruce was born Leonard Alfred Schneider on October 13, 1925, in Mineola, Long Island, New York. His British-born father, Myron, was a shoe clerk, his mother, Sadie, was a dancer. Lenny's parents were divorced when he was a child. To support herself and her son, Sadie Schneider pursued a career in show business and sent Lenny to live with various aunts, uncles and grandparents.\n\nDropping out of high school, Lenny enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1942, which he almost disliked. He got himself discharged after convincing a team of Navy psychologists that he was experimenting with homosexual urges. With some help from his mother, Lenny began doing impressions, one-liners and movie parodies in small nightclubs. In 1948, he obtained some booking as a result of his appearance on the TV show Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. Lenny married a red-headed stripper named Honey Harlow in 1951, but they were divorced five years later. After Honey was arrested and sent to jail for a narcotics violation, Lenny raised their daughter, Kitty, by himself.\n\nSlowly, Lenny began working his way up from performing stand-up comedy in seedy New York City strip clubs and jazz clubs. Gradually his act evolved into something wholly different from that of other comics. Onstage, he was a dark, slender, and intense figure who prowled around like a caged animal and spoke into a hand-held microphone. His monologues were peppered with four-letter curse words and Yiddish expressions. In his act, Lenny liked to expose racist attitudes by forcing his audiences to examine their own racial prejudices. In another act bashing religions, Lenny acted out a conversation between Oral Roberts and the Pope, with both talking in the vernacular of glib show-business personalities. When jazz critic Ralph J. Gleason and San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen wrote about Lenny, be began to get the recognition he so badly wanted. Unfortunately, the seedy subculture of strip joints, clubs, and dives had introduced him to hard drugs and fast times.\n\nThrough his nightclub acts and record albums, Lenny became the hipster saint of the comedy world, crossing into the line of propriety where others feared to tread. But his foul-speaking acts began to catch up with him when he was arrested in 1961 on obscenity charges following an appearance at the Jazz Workshop in San Francisco, but a jury found him not guilty. Problems with the authorities and religious groups trying to silence him began to plague him as he appeared in clubs all over the country. In 1964, he was arrested again in New York City on more obscenity charges. During his trial a police officer read notes about Lenny's profane act, which caused the desperate comic to ask the judge to let him do the act in court so the judge could understand his callous humor in context, but the judge refused. Despite support from noted writers, critics, educators and politicians, Lenny was found guilty and sentenced to several months in prison, and was paroled just a few months later. Continually harassed by the police, Lenny became depressed and paranoid. Further prosecutions for obscenity and his drug use drove him toward instability. By 1965, he was broke and in debt. He claimed that every time he got a gig, the local police, wherever he was, would threaten to arrest the club owner if Lenny went onstage.\n\nIn February 1966, Lenny traveled to Los Angeles and appeared onstage for the first time in years. He performed for a very small crowd who included a few hecklers and vice cops waiting to arrest him if he should use profanity again. Lenny by this time was bearded, overweight, and haggard, and his performance centered on his current obsessions: his constitutional right of free speech, free assembly, and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. When a friend asked him afterwards why he had turned his back on comedy he replied, \"I'm not a comedian anymore. I'm Lenny Bruce.\" On August 3, 1966, Lenny was found dead on the bathroom floor of his Hollywood home. Whatever the details or reasons why, Lenny Bruce was found dead from a drug overdose at the age of 40.\n\nSteve Martin was born on August 14, 1945 in Waco, Texas, USA as Stephen Glenn Martin to Mary Lee (née Stewart; 1913-2002) and Glenn Vernon Martin (1914-1997), a real estate salesman and aspiring actor. He was raised in Inglewood and Garden Grove in California. In 1960, he got a job at the Magic shop of Disney's Fantasyland, and while there he learned magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals. At Santa Ana College, he took classes in drama and English poetry. He also took part in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre, and joined a comedy troupe at Knott's Berry Farm. He attended California State University as a philosophy major, but in 1967 transferred to UCLA as a theatre major.\n\nHis writing career began on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (1967), winning him an Emmy Award. Between 1967 and 1973, he also wrote for many other shows, including The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour (1969) and The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour (1971). He also appeared on talk shows and comedy shows in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1972, he first appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), doing stand-up several times each year, and even guest hosting a few years later. In 1976, he served for the first time as guest-host on Saturday Night Live (1975). By 2016, he has guest-hosted 15 times, which is one less than Alec Baldwin's record, and also appeared 12 other times on SNL.\n\nIn 1977, he released his first comedy album, a platinum selling \"Let's Get Small\". He followed it with \"A Wild and Crazy Guy\" (1978), which sold more than a million copies. Both albums went on to win Grammys for Best Comedy Recording. This is when he performed in arenas in front of tens of thousands of people, and begun his movie career, which was always his goal. His first major role was in the short film, Ein Kellner wie der Gast ihn liebt (1977), which he also wrote. His star value was established in Reichtum ist keine Schande (1979), which was co-written by Martin, and directed by Carl Reiner. The film earned more than $100 million on a $4 million budget. He also starred in Tote tragen keine Karos (1982), Der Mann mit 2 Gehirnen (1983), and Solo für 2 (1984), all directed by Reiner. To avoid being typecast as a comedian, he wanted do more dramatic roles, starring in Tanz in den Wolken (1981), a film remake of Dennis Potter's 1978 series. Unfortunately, it was a financial failure.\n\nHe also starred in John Landis's Drei Amigos! (1986), co-written by himself, opposite Martin Short and Chevy Chase. That year, he also appeared in the musical horror comedy, Der kleine Horrorladen (1986) opposite Rick Moranis. Next year, he starred in Roxanne (1987), co-written by himself, and in John Hughes' Ein Ticket für zwei (1987), opposite John Candy. His other films include Eine Wahnsinnsfamilie (1989) and Das Schlitzohr von der Mafia (1990), both opposite Moranis. In 1991, he wrote and starred in L.A. Story (1991), about a weatherman who searches meaning in his life and love in Los Angeles. It also starred his then-wife, Victoria Tennant. Same year, Vater der Braut (1991) was so successful that a 1995 sequel followed.\n\nDuring the 1990s, he continued to play more dramatic roles, in Grand Canyon - Im Herzen der Stadt (1991), playing a traumatized movie producer, in Der Schein-Heilige (1992), playing a fake faith healer, in Der Zufalls-Dad (1994), playing a betrayed man adopting a baby, and in David Mamet's thriller Die unsichtbare Falle (1997). Other, more comedic roles include in Housesitter - Lügen haben schöne Beine (1992) and Schlaflos in New York (1999), opposite Goldie Hawn, in Nora Ephron's Lifesavers - Die Lebensretter (1994), and in Bowfingers große Nummer (1999), written by himself and co-starring Eddie Murphy. After Bowfinger, he starred in Haus über Kopf (2003) and Im Dutzend billiger (2003), both earning more than $130 million. He wrote and starred in Shopgirl (2005), and appeared in the sequel of Cheaper by the Dozen. After them, he appeared in Der rosarote Panther (2006) and Der rosarote Panther 2 (2009), which he both co-wrote, as Inspector Clouseau.\n\nHe continues to do movies, more recently appearing in Ein Jahr vogelfrei! (2011), Home - Ein smektakulärer Trip (2015), and Alle Jahre wieder - Weihnachten mit den Coopers (2015). Besides aforementioned, he has been an avid art collector since 1968, written plays, written for The New Yorker, written a well-received memoir (Born Standing Up), written a novel (An Object of Beauty; 2010), hosted the Academy Awards three times, released a Grammy award winning music album (The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo; 2009), and another album (Love Has Come For You; 2013) with Edie Brickell. Since 2007, he has been married to Anne Stringfield, with whom he has a daughter.\n\nEdward Regan Murphy was born April 3, 1961 in Brooklyn, New York, to Lillian Lynch (born: Lillian Laney), a telephone operator, and Charles Edward Murphy, a transit police officer who was also an amateur comedian and actor. After his father died, his mother married Vernon Lynch, a foreman at a Breyer's Ice Cream plant. His brothers are Charlie Murphy & Vernon Lynch Jr. Eddie had aspirations of being in show business since he was a child. A bright kid growing up in the streets of New York, Murphy spent a great deal of time on impressions and comedy stand-up routines rather than academics. His sense of humor and wit made him a stand out amongst his classmates at Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School. By the time he was fifteen, Murphy worked as a stand-up comic on the lower part of New York, wooing audiences with his dead-on impressions of celebrities and outlooks on life.\n\nIn the early 1980s, at the age of 19, Murphy was offered a contract for the Not-Ready-For-Prime-Time Players of Saturday Night Live (1975), where Murphy exercised his comedic abilities in impersonating African American figures and originating some of the show's most memorable characters: Velvet Jones, Mr. Robinson, and a disgruntled and angry Gumby. Murphy made his feature film debut in Nur 48 Stunden (1982), alongside Nick Nolte. The two's comedic and antagonistic chemistry, alongside Murphy's believable performance as a streetwise convict aiding a bitter, aging cop, won over critics and audiences. The next year, Murphy went two for two, with another hit, pairing him with John Landis, who later became a frequent collaborator with Murphy in Der Prinz aus Zamunda (1988) and Beverly Hills Cop III (1994). Beverly Hills Cop - Ich lös' den Fall auf jeden Fall (1984) was the film that made Murphy a box-office superstar and most notably made him a celebrity worldwide, and it remains one of the all-time biggest domestic blockbusters in motion-picture history. Murphy's performance as a young Detroit cop in pursuit of his friend's murderers earned him a third consecutive Golden Globe nomination. Axel Foley became one of Murphy's signature characters. On top of his game, Murphy was unfazed by his success, that is until his box office appeal and choices in scripts resulted into a spotty mix of hits and misses into the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nFilms like Auf der Suche nach dem goldenen Kind (1986) and Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) were critically panned but were still massive draws at the box office. In 1989, Murphy, coming off another hit, Der Prinz aus Zamunda (1988), found failure with his directorial debut, Harlem Nights (1989). Und wieder 48 Stunden (1990), his turn as a hopeless romantic in Boomerang (1992) and as a suave vampire in Vampire In Brooklyn did little to resuscitate his career. However, his remake of Jerry Lewis's Der verrückte Professor (1996) brought Murphy's drawing power back into fruition. From there, Murphy rebounded with occasional hits and misses but has long proven himself as a skilled comedic actor with laudable range pertaining to characterizations and mannerisms. Though he has grown up a lot since his fast-lane rise as a superstar in the 1980s, Murphy has lived the Hollywood lifestyle with controversy, criticism, scandal, and the admiration of millions worldwide for his talents. As Murphy had matured throughout the years, learning many lessons about the Hollywood game in the process, he settled down with more family-oriented humor with Dr. Dolittle (1998), Mulan (1998), Bowfingers große Nummer (1999), and the animated smash Shrek - Der tollkühne Held (2001), in a supporting role that showcased Murphy's comedic personality and charm. Throughout the 2000s, he further starred in the hits Die Geistervilla (2003), Shrek 2 - Der tollkühne Held kehrt zurück (2004), Dreamgirls (2006) (for which he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), Norbit (2007), Shrek der Dritte (2007), and Für immer Shrek (2010).\n\nMurphy was married to Nicole Mitchell Murphy from 1993 to 2006. Murphy has ten children.\n\nBill Cosby is one of the world's most well-known entertainers and comedians. William Henry Cosby, Jr. was born on July 12, 1937, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Anna Pearl (Hite), a maid and William Henry Cosby, Sr., a U.S. Navy sailor. After 10th grade, Cosby joined the Navy and completed high school through a correspondence course. He later took up an athletics scholarship at Temple University, supporting himself during his studies by tending bar, where his easy going style and witty joking with the clientèle prompted suggestions that he try stand-up comedy. This he did and was soon to be discovered by the legendary Carl Reiner.\n\nIn his early twenties, he appeared on many well-known variety programs including Toast of the Town (1948). His big break came in 1965 when he appeared as \"Alexander Scott\" in Tennisschläger und Kanonen (1965), winning numerous Emmys for his performance. He later appeared in Bill Cosby (1969), playing a teacher, although originally the show only lasted for two years. He then created a Filmation cartoon based on many of his high school buddies including Weird Harold, Dumb Donald, Mushmouth, and others: the show was, of course, Fat Albert und die Cosby Kids (1972). The theme was humorous but also focused on Cosby's more educational side. He studied for many years during his career in the 1960s and 1970s, and he received a doctorate in Education from the University of Massachusetts. Cosby also starred in some highly successful movies such as Samstagnacht oben in der Stadt (1974), Drehn wir noch'n Ding (1975), Ausgetrickst (1977), C.R.A.S.H. (1976), and Das verrückte California Hotel (1978). During his early years he also made some comedy albums that sold very well; his most notable comedy song being \"Little Old Man.\" He was one of the original cast members of The Electric Company (1971), and he was featured in the series Pinwheel (1976) during the late 1970s and then appeared in the mediocre Zum Teufel mit Max (1981).\n\nIn 1984, 'Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids' stopped production, and Die Bill Cosby Show (1984) commenced. The show was originally intended to follow a blue-collar family, but finally ended up portraying a white-collar family. It was originally rejected by ABC, accepted by a then-floundering NBC, and was an almost instant success. From 1985 to 1987 the show broke viewing records, with Cosby becoming perhaps the strongest driving force in television during the eighties. Despite this great success, he arguably created his own downfall. The Cosby Show led what was considered by many at that time to be the best night of television: the line-up included Harrys wundersames Strafgericht (1984), Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981), and Familienbande (1982), which all followed The Cosby Show.\n\nCosby was dissatisfied with the way minorities were portrayed on television. He produced the TV series College Fieber (1987) and insisted that this program should follow the Cosby Show, rather than Family Ties. A Different World was set in an historically Black college and concentrated on young people and education. Impact was felt on the show immediately; at its peak, the Cosby Show logged an estimated 70 million viewers. However, after the scheduling reshuffle, the show lost roughly 20% of its massive audience. However, Cosby was still riding high in the early nineties until massive competition from Die Simpsons (1989).\n\nThe Cosby Show finally ended in 1992, conceding to Die Simpsons (1989), with the final production considered to be one of the highest-rated shows of the season and featured a pleading Cosby asking for peace in riot-torn Los Angeles during the height of the Rodney King riots. Cosby never seemed able to top the success of the Cosby Show; his film Bill Cosby - Die Superkanone (1987) was considered to be one of the worst American films in history and may have contributed in part to his downfall as a film actor, along with his performance in Ghost Dad - Nachricht von Papa (1990). He did attempt a minor comeback in 1996 starring in the Robin Williams film Jack (1996), which was directed by Francis Ford Coppola; and in another show, Cosby (1996), (starring Phylicia Rashad, who appeared as his wife in the previous Cosby Show). Since then he has produced films such as Men of Honor (2000), and shows including Little Bill (1999).\n\nSadly, his son Ennis was murdered in 1997. Throughout the years, Bill Cosby has taken a socially conscious tone, often associated with family values, coupled with a distinctly urban spin on his style.\n\nRodney Dangerfield was born Jacob Cohen on November 22, 1921 in Deer Park, Suffolk County, Long Island, New York. He was the son of Dorothy \"Dotty\" (Teitelbaum) and Phillip Cohen, who performed in vaudeville under the name Phil Roy. His father was born in New York, to Russian Jewish parents, and his mother was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant. Rodney began writing jokes at the age of fifteen, and started performing before he was 20. He took his act to the road for ten years, his stage name was \"Jack Roy\". While working as a struggling comedian, Rodney Dangerfield worked as a singing waiter. His first run at comedy was to no avail.\n\nRodney Dangerfield married Joyce Indig, in 1949 and had two children: Brian and Melanie. During the 1950s, Rodney was an aluminum siding salesman, living in New Jersey. The comedian made another attempt at stand-up comedy, this time as Rodney Dangerfield. In 1961, Rodney divorced from his wife.\n\nWhen he appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" (Toast of the Town (1948)), Rodney Dangerfield made Ed Sullivan laugh. Few people ever provoked any kind of reaction out of the legendary Ed Sullivan. Dangerfield had the image of a lovable disgruntled every-man type that became a hit all across nightclubs in the 1960s. Dangerfield also made many appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) and The Dean Martin Show (1965) in the 1970s.\n\nRodney Dangerfield snatched a minor supporting part in the movie, Der Filmvorführer (1970), in 1971. By the mid 1970s, he had cemented his image as a comedian constantly tugging at his red tie, always proclaiming he gets no respect. His big break came with many appearances on Saturday Night Live (1975), bringing himself to a much wider audience and proving hysterical on many occasions. In 1980, Dangerfield became a cornerstone of American comedy with the classic Caddyshack - Wahnsinn ohne Handicap (1980).\n\nHere, he played \"Al Czervik\", a rich golfer who was a basically nice guy who was extremely outspoken and very obnoxious. His character was often unhappy with the rich snobbery he was around, and he takes on the rich people that are so snobby to him.\n\nThe average guy that his character portrayed was an instant hit, and a formula that Dangerfield often stuck with. Also, in 1980, Rodney came out with a popular comedy album, \"Rappin Rodney\".\n\nThe album earned Dangerfield a Grammy for best comedy album. The next movie on Rodney's agenda was Monty, der Millionenerbe (1983), a comedy that showed him as an insulting working class person who suddenly becomes a millionaire. The movie was also a big hit. Dangerfield became very sparse in his roles on TV and film about this time. The year 1986 saw the comedy, Mach's nochmal, Dad (1986), his biggest film to date. The comedy was one of the first to gross over 100 million. In 1994, Dangerfield starred in his first dramatic role in the successful Oliver Stone film, Natural Born Killers (1994).\n\nHe played an abusive father who drove one of the killers crazy. His part was critically-acclaimed. In 1995, Dangerfield entered the world of cyberspace, becoming the first entertainer to have a website on the world-wide web. In 1997, he starred in Wally Sparks - König des schlechten Geschmacks (1997), a political and talk show satire which was poorly received. In 2000, Dangerfield starred as \"the Devil\" in Little Nicky - Satan Junior (2000). The movie was potentially a huge hit, but was a failure by most accounts. Dangerfield took a very small part, but was top-billed in the direct-to-video The Godson (1998), and starred in the direct-to-video link=tt0216930]. But it has not been all smooth sailing for this comedian. In 1997, he admitted to a lifelong bout with depression and, on his 80th birthday, had a mild heart attack. He has major fans from all kinds of people from all different backgrounds. Dangerfield had made a record 70 appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), and had discovered many struggling comedians, including Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, Roseanne Barr, Robert Townsend, Sam Kinison and Tim Allen.\n\nThe comedian owned a legendary nightclub in Manhattan called \"Dangerfield's\". In the 1990s, he made highly-publicized appearances on Die Simpsons (1989), In Living Color (1990), Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist (1995), Hör' mal, wer da hämmert (1991), Susan (1996), among others.\n\nIn 1993, he married Joan Dangerfield (aka Joan Child), a woman thirty years younger than him, and a Mormon.\n\nHe died on October 5, 2004, after falling into a coma following heart surgery.\n\nRicky Dene Gervais was born in a suburb of Reading, Berkshire, to Eva Sophia (House) and Lawrence Raymond Gervais, who was a hod carrier and labourer. His father was born in Ontario, Canada, of French-Canadian descent, and his mother was English. He was educated at Ashmead Comprehensive School and went on to study at University College, London, where he gained a degree in Philosophy.\n\nAfter university, Gervais attempted to pursue a pop career with Seona Dancing, a duo he formed with a fellow student. Similar to many groups in the early 1980s, they were a synth-pop act with a somewhat pretentious name and exhibiting a strong musical influence by David Bowie. Gervais adopted a vocal style that has often been compared to Bowie; comedian Paul Merton would later joke that Bowie nicked their music. Seona Dancing were briefly signed to a recording contract and released two singles, \"More to Lose\" and \"Bitter Heart\". The latter was slightly reminiscent of Queen's \"Body Language\" from a year earlier, featuring a similar synthesizer riff. The act failed to breach the UK top 75 and earn a place in the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles, but clips have survived and they have been frequently used to tease Gervais in interviews. Despite his own lack of success, Gervais stayed within the music industry for a while and even spent time as the manager of Suede.\n\nGervais had to wait a long time before achieving the fame he had hoped would come with a pop career. In the 1990s he formed a writing partnership with Stephen Merchant. In 2000, he landed his own comedy chat show on Channel 4, Meet Ricky Gervais (2000), which attracted legendary guests such as Jimmy Savile, Michael Winner, Paul Daniels, Peter Purves, Stefanie Powers, Jim Bowen and Midge Ure. The series only ran for six episodes but a year later greater stardom came for Gervais with the debut of BBC comedy The Office (2001). Although it was not initially received to great acclaim or viewing figures, it is now often cited as one of the greatest comedy series of all time and has been credited with reinventing the sitcom. Gervais starred as the obnoxious and embarrassing office manager David Brent, who has since been voted in various polls one of the greatest comic characters. It also prompted an American remake, Das Büro (2005). Gervais had further success with another sitcom, Extras (2005), which attracted a series of celebrity guests, including Ben Stiller, Samuel L. Jackson and his musical idol David Bowie. It served as a satire on the entertainment industry and leading stars were happy to play along by performing exaggerated versions of themselves.\n\nGervais has become one of the most popular and omnipresent comedy performers of the 21st century, hosting the Golden Globe awards, lending his talent to films, becoming a voice artist and appearing on numerous talk shows. He has become one of the best known British comedy figures in America. He is also regularly the subject of controversy due to his dark comedy. Some critics have called him insensitive and outrageous. Gervais has responded by saying \"offense is the collateral damage of free speech\", he has said that he doesn't aim for a mass audience, he's just pleased he's managed to get one, and he has compared his style of comedy and the audience he has acquired with being Iggy Pop in preference to being Phil Collins.\n\nWoody Allen was born on November 30, 1935, as Allen Konigsberg, in The Bronx, NY, the son of Martin Konigsberg and Nettie Konigsberg. He has one younger sister, Letty Aronson. As a young boy, he became intrigued with magic tricks and playing the clarinet, two hobbies that he continues today.\n\nAllen broke into show business at 15 years when he started writing jokes for a local paper, receiving $200 a week. He later moved on to write jokes for talk shows but felt that his jokes were being wasted. His agents, Charles Joffe and Jack Rollins, convinced him to start doing stand-up and telling his own jokes. Reluctantly he agreed and, although he initially performed with such fear of the audience that he would cover his ears when they applauded his jokes, he eventually became very successful at stand-up. After performing on stage for a few years, he was approached to write a script for Warren Beatty to star in: Was gibt's Neues, Pussy? (1965) and would also have a moderate role as a character in the film. During production, Woody gave himself more and better lines and left Beatty with less compelling dialogue. Beatty inevitably quit the project and was replaced by Peter Sellers, who demanded all the best lines and more screen-time.\n\nIt was from this experience that Woody realized that he could not work on a film without complete control over its production. Woody's theoretical directorial debut was in What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966); a Japanese spy flick that he dubbed over with his own comedic dialogue about spies searching for the secret recipe for egg salad. His real directorial debut came the next year in the mockumentary Woody, der Unglücksrabe (1969). He has written, directed and, more often than not, starred in about a film a year ever since, while simultaneously writing more than a dozen plays and several books of comedy.\n\nWhile best known for his romantic comedies Der Stadtneurotiker (1977) and Manhattan (1979), Woody has made many transitions in his films throughout the years, transitioning from his \"early, funny ones\" of Bananas (1971), Die letzte Nacht des Boris Gruschenko (1975) and Was Sie schon immer über Sex wissen wollten, aber bisher nicht zu fragen wagten (1972); to his more storied and romantic comedies of Der Stadtneurotiker (1977), Manhattan (1979) and Hannah und ihre Schwestern (1986); to the Bergmanesque films of Stardust Memories (1980) and Innenleben (1978); and then on to the more recent, but varied works of Verbrechen und andere Kleinigkeiten (1989), Ehemänner und Ehefrauen (1992), Geliebte Aphrodite (1995), Celebrity - Schön, reich, berühmt (1998) and Harry außer sich (1997); and finally to his films of the last decade, which vary from the light comedy of Scoop - Der Knüller (2006), to the self-destructive darkness of Match Point (2005) and, most recently, to the cinematically beautiful tale of Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). Although his stories and style have changed over the years, he is regarded as one of the best filmmakers of our time because of his views on art and his mastery of filmmaking.\n\nRedd Foxx began doing stand-up comedy on the infamous \"Chitlin' Circuit\" in the 1940s and 1950s. Foxx was one of the premier \"blue humor\" comedians. Blue humor was very dirty, too dirty for white audiences. For years his party albums were not available in white record stores. In the 1960s his records became available, although marginally in white record stores, leading to minor comedy work on Toast of the Town (1948) (aka \"The Ed Sullivan Show\") and The Red Skelton Show (1951), among other classic variety shows of the time. Foxx developed a fan base in the 1960s that led to increased notoriety. He received his own television series in 1972 called Sanford and Son (1972), which was a reworking of the British sitcom Steptoe and Son (1962). Foxx's character, Fred Sanford (was actually Foxx's brother's name), was a cranky old man who was set in his ways and would insult both friends and strangers at the drop of a hat. He ran a junkyard in Watts, a bad neighborhood in Los Angeles, with his son Lamont (played by Demond Wilson). The show broke down racial stereotypes and was a huge success, making Foxx and the show household names. Foxx fought a very public battle with the writers and producers of the show, claiming that they did not do enough to promote the black experience, and in general complained there were not enough black writers or producers in the entertainment industry. These highly publicized disputes led to the show faltering artistically, but not in the ratings. Foxx left the show in 1977 to accomplish his dream on ABC: his own variety show, which lasted less than a year. He also starred in the controversial film Norman... Is That You? (1976).\n\nFoxx's trouble with the law and the Internal Revenue Service hampered his career in the early 1980s. He flopped yet again with the sitcom The Redd Foxx Show (1986) on ABC. He did, however, find success playing a ghost in the TV movie Ghost of a Chance (1987), with Dick Van Dyke. The late 1980s found Foxx on a rebound, as he starred with Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy in the popular Harlem Nights (1989), which showcased the three premiere black comedians of their respective generations. A whole new generation of comedians begin claiming Redd Foxx as a major influence on their careers, including Murphy and Pryor. Foxx looked like he was finding success 20 years after Sanford and Son (1972) with Die verrückten Royals (1991). However, we will never know if the show would have been a success--while rehearsing for an episode, Foxx collapsed and was rushed to a hospital. He died in October of 1991. Redd Foxx will be remembered as a pioneering comedian who influenced generations of comedians and helped break down racial barriers in the the entertainment industry. His influence seems as strong as ever.\n\nBob Newhart was an American actor and stand-up comedian. His comedic style involved deadpan delivery of dialogue, a slight stammer when talking, and comedic monologues. He cited earlier comedians George Gobel (1919-1991), Ray Goulding (1922-1990), and Bob Elliott (1923-2016) as his main influences in developing his comedy style.\n\nIn 1929, Newhart was born in a hospital in Oak Park, Illinois to Roman Catholic parents, George David Newhart (1900-1985) and his wife, Julia Pauline Burns (1900-1994). George Newhart was the son of an American father and a Canadian mother, had both German and Irish ancestry, and claimed maternal descent from the O'Conor family of Connacht; his mother was an Irish-American. George had partial ownership in a plumbing and heating-supply business, which was the Newhart family's main source of income. Bob Newhart and his sister, who became a nun (Sister M. Joan Newhart), were raised Catholic.\n\nNewhart was raised in the vicinity of Chicago and attended a number of local Roman Catholic schools: first the St. Catherine of Siena Grammar School in Oak Park, then St. Ignatius College Prep in Chicago. He graduated the prep school (equivalent to a high school) in 1947, then enrolled at the Loyola University Chicago. He graduated in 1952 with a Bachelor's Degree in business management.\n\nShortly after graduating, Newhart was drafted into the the United States Army. He served as a personnel manager for the Army during the Korean War (1950-1953). He was honorably discharged in 1954, during the post-war demobilization of the American armed forces. He attempted to continue his studies, and enrolled into the Loyola University Chicago School of Law. However, he never completed his degree, quitting a required internship because his employer had allegedly demanded \"unethical\" behavior from him.\n\nNewhart briefly worked as an accountant for the USG Corporation (United States Gypsum Corporation), a Chicago-based company which manufactures construction materials. He quit after regularly facing trouble in \"adjusting petty cash imbalances\". He then proceeded to work as a clerk for various employers, but found himself struggling financially.\n\nIn 1958, he was hired as an advertising copywriter for a Chicago-based production company. To entertain himself, he started exchanging \"long telephone calls about absurd scenarios\" with a friendly co-worker. The 29-year-old Newhart had the idea to try his hand as a comedian, and developed a comedy routine based on the telephone calls. He recorded his routine into audition tapes, and send them to radio stations. His routine was met favorably. In 1959, Newhart started performing as a stand-up-comedian in nightclubs, and signed a contract with a new record company which was seeking to recruit some talent. The company was Warner Bros. Records (established in 1958), a subsidiary of the film studio Warner Bros.\n\nNewhart became famous primarily through his audio releases. His comedy album \"The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart\" (1960) became the first comedy album to make number one on the Billboard charts, and earned him the 1961 Grammy Award for Best New Artist. This success opened to him new career opportunities, in television and film. NBC offered him his own variety television show, the short-lived \"The Bob Newhart Show\" (October, 1961-June 1962). The show won the 1962 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, but was canceled anyway. It had won the award while facing four other candidates: \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Car 54, Where Are You?\", \"Hazel\", and \"The Red Skelton Show\", all of which outlasted Newhart's award-winning show.\n\nIn 1962, Newhart made his film debut in the war film \"Hell Is for Heroes\". Newhart played the character James Driscoll, an Army company clerk who broadcasts misleading radio messages to the enemy limes during World War II. He appeared frequently as a guest star in television over the subsequent years, but had relatively few big screen roles. He appeared in the caper story \"Hot Millions\" (1968), the reincarnation-themed fantasy film \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\" (1970), the war film \"Catch-22\" (1970), and the tobacco-smoking-themed satirical film \"Cold Turkey\" (1971).\n\nFrom 1972 to 1978, he starred in the hit sitcom \"The Bob Newhart Show\". He played the character Robert \"Bob\" Hartley, Ph.D. (Newhart), a Chicago psychologist who is surrounded by eccentric patients, work colleagues, friends, and family members. Hartley was effectively the \"straight man\" to the wacky characters surrounding him.\n\nIn 1977, Newhart voiced Bernard, the male lead in the animated film \"The Rescuers\" (1977). The film features the Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization, with its headquarters located in New York City. Bernard is not initially one of its members, but works as their janitor. When Miss Bianca, Hungary's representative in the organization, must choose a partner for her first field mission, she impulsively chooses Bernard over the the other available agents. Part of the success of the film is based on the contrast between the two partners, the adventurous, brave, but rather impulsive Bianca, and the overly cautious, shy, and reluctant hero Bernard. \"The Rescuers\" earned worldwide gross rentals of $48 million dollars at the box office during its initial release, and had a total lifetime worldwide gross of $169 million through subsequent re-releases.\n\nIn 1980, Newhart appeared in two live-action films, the comedy-drama \"Little Miss Marker\", and the political comedy \"First Family\". The first features Newhart as a member of a gangster-run gambling operation. The gangsters are surprised when a client uses his 6-year-old daughter as collateral for a bet. The other film featured Newheart as an inept President of the United States. The main plot deals with the President tolerating the kidnapping of American citizens by a fictional African country, because the country offers some valuable resources in exchange for their new American slaves.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1990, Newhart starred in a second hit sitcom, called simply \"Newhart\". He played the character Dick Loudon, a Vermon-based innkeeper who finds himself surrounded by strange employees, neighbors, and competitors. The show had a famous ending where the entire series is \"revealed\" to be a dream of Robert Hartley, Newhart's character from his hit CBS sitcom, \"The Bob Newhart Show\".\n\nIn 1990, Newhart returned to the role of Bernard, in the sequel film \"The Rescuers Down Under\". Early in the film, Bernard is preparing a marriage proposal for Miss Bianca, but his plans are derailed when they are both send to Australia for an urgent mission. The duo are partnered with Australian agent Jake, and Bernard is frustrated with when Jake competes with him for Bianca's affections. At the end of the mission, Berbard finally makes his marriage proposal, unwilling to let orders for further missions to interfere with his plans to marry the woman he loves. The film only earned 47.4 million dollars at the worldwide box office, and became Walt Disney Animation Studio's least successful theatrical animated film of the 1990s.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1993, Newhart starred in his third sitcom, called simply \"Bob\". He played the character Bob McKay, a veteran comic book writer and artist from the 1950s. Having long retired into obscurity, McKay is hired by a corporation to produce a revival of his classic character, the superhero \"Mad-Dog\". The first season introduced a large cast of eccentric co-workers. The second season dismissed most of these characters, and had McKay serving as the President of a company producing greeting cards. The series suffered from low ratings, and was canceled at the end of its second season. Only 33 episodes were produced.\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Newhart starred in his fourth sitcom \"George & Leo\". He played George Stoody, a bookstore owner who finds himself offering hospitality to a professional magician and part-time criminal (Judd Hirsch). The humor was based on the strong contrast between the two men, but the series failed to find an audience.\n\nNewhart returned to theatrical films with the romantic comedy \"In & Out\" (1997). He had roles in the animated film \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie\" (1998), the comedy \"Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde\" (2003), and the Christmas film \"Elf\" (2003) . From 2004 to 2008, Newhart played the major character Judson in three television films of \"The Librarian\" fantasy franchise. The franchise features a mystical library, which hides numerous magical and technological artifacts from various historical eras. A series of librarians have to guard the library and its contents from criminal organizations with sinister designs. Judson is the mentor who trains the current librarian, after the previous one was killed in action. The series hinted that Judson was older than he looked, and he was eventually revealed to be the original librarian. He was nearly immortal, and had trained succeeding librarians for centuries. In \"Horrible Bosses\" (2011), he made a surprise cameo at the end as Jason Bateman's new boss, Lou Sherman, who has a notorious reputation of his own.\n\nIn 2013, Newhart started playing the recurring character Arthur Jeffries (stage name \"Professor Proton\") in \"The Big Bang Theory\". He was a scientist who decades ago served as the host of a science show aimed at children, inspiring series co-protagonists Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper to start science careers of their own. Leonard and Sheldon, now professional physicists with academic careers, eventually get to meet their childhood idol. Jeffries's scientific career ended in disgrace, his television days are long over, and he has been reduced to earning a meager living as a party entertainer. This role won Newhart his first Primetime Emmy Award. The character dynamic between the two was popular, as Sheldon continued to idolize Jeffries who found his \"student\" to be insufferable. Following Jeffries' death, Newhart continued to appear in the series as Jeffries' ghost, appearing at various points to offer Sheldon advice and serving as a reluctant mentor. Sheldon viewed Jeffries as his version of Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nBob Newhart died in 2024, aged 94."
