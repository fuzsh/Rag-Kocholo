        "text": "Resplendent in glittering rock-star garb, Eddie Murphy prowls the stage in his hit concert movie, ''Raw,'' like a sleek young lion.\n\nBaring his teeth in a dazzling ear-to-ear grin, the 26-year-old king of comedy from Hempstead, L.I., playfully cuffs his fellow show-business icons. He locates a pompous prude lurking beneath Bill Cosby's avuncular joviality and finds a thin-skinned hysteric inside Richard Pryor's hipster. With vicious accuracy, he impersonates effeminate homosexuals, macho Italian-Americans and middle-class white managerial types.\n\nAs a needler of celebrities and a supercilious social parodist, Mr. Murphy is not all that different from the Bob Hope of 30 years ago who tweaked celebrity egos and lisped with a limp wrist. He has the same impeccably measured timing, the same impenetrable killer's smile, the same cool, monarchal self-confidence. But while their similarities go deep, their differences are far more profound. Mr. Murphy, for one, is black. If he possesses Bob Hope's imperial suavity, he is also the proud heir of a decades-old burlesque-show tradition of scatological party humor that Redd Foxx and others were instrumental in bringing into the mainstream of American comedy. White hipsters like Lenny Bruce and George Carlin were key figures in intellectually legitimizing this blue humor, And, preceding Mr. Murphy, Richard Pryor grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and elevated it into perilous, pyrotechnical art.\n\nWhile aggressive, scatological humor has been a staple of American comedy for decades, its above-ground acceptance has reached a new plateau in the last few years. As Mr. Murphy has been swept to the pinnacle of entertainment, older comedians like Rodney Dangerfield have been discovered and embraced by youthful audiences who grew up with hard-rock music and have found in Mr. Dangerfield's crude, roaring hostility the comic equivalent of leering heavy-metal rock.\n\nMr. Dangerfield, who owns a popular New York comedy club, has fathered a whole school of screamingly profane, assaultive male comedians, among them Sam Kinison, Andrew (Dice) Clay and Bob Goldthwait. Their phenomenal popularity in the comedy world is comparable to that of Ozzy Osbourne and the Beastie Boys in rock music. Heavy-metal rock has often been called ''head-banging music'' because it expresses adolescent sexual frustration and a feeling of social confinement. Outrageous ''attack comedy'' voices the same sense of pent-up frustration with no outlet other than wanton verbal aggression. An indispensable conduit to its success has been cable television, which has brought uncensored live comedy performances into millions of homes across the country.\n\nThe basic tenet of outrageous comedy, as announced by Redd Foxx, who made a brief, sad appearance on Broadway a few months ago, is that all people are equal in their bodily functions, animal desires and revulsions. In his wild-eyed freewheeling confessions, Mr. Pryor transcendently carried this concept into social and metaphysical realms. Mr. Murphy, who grew up worshiping Mr. Pryor, has synthesized his idol's ghetto-wise truth-telling, graphic language and sexual explicitness with Mr. Hope's toastmaster style. He epitomizes the contemporary stand-up comedian as both naughty pop philosopher and glib superstar.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
