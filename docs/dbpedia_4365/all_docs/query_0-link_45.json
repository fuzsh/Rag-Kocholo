        "text": "Like many college freshmen who, during their first semester, were introduced to the wonders of dorm-provided cable, I spent the majority of my free time watching stand-up specials on Comedy Central. There were many I liked, and many I didn’t, but one that has always stood out was Lewis Black’s first appearance on Comedy Central Presents in 1998. Specifically, his bits about “The Weather” and “February In Boston,” which were constantly on repeat late at night.\n\nI just couldn’t get enough of these routines, in which Black, employing a mixture of Sam Kinison’s screaming rage and George Carlin’s irritable insight, deconstructing something as normal and everyday as the weather. It was even better as the full nine-minute routine featured on 2000’s The White Album, in which Black railed against everything from the Weather Channel and celebrity meteorologists to hurricane naming conventions.\n\nBut it was never meant to be another angry rant. On the contrary, Black, unlike the Kinisons and the Bill Hickses of American stand-up, was channeling real rage into one carefully crafted and executed joke after another. He wasn’t simply yelling into the make to trigger the audience’s uncomfortable laughing reflexes, but quite the opposite. He was making thoughtful observations that were also funny.\n\nFlash forward nearly 20 years later to the release of Asian Comedian Destroys America!, the first Netflix special from The Daily Show correspondent Ronny Chieng and, as it turns out, his first-ever American comedy hour. Chieng, who got his start in the Australian circuit and toured internationally at the Melbourne, Sydney, and Edinburgh Fringe festivals, had previously released numerous specials. Now, thanks to Netflix, American audiences were about to get a taste of what they had been missing.\n\nAnd you know what? It reminded me an awful lot of Lewis Black and his thoughtful rants against the weather. Perhaps the earliest example of Chieng’s Black-esque style of angry comedy arrives nearly six minutes in when, after riffing about Americans’ excessive use of napkins, he brings up Amazon Prime.\n\n“No item too trivial,” he says. “No quantity too small to be hand-delivered into your home like an emperor.”\n\nFrom here, the prompt expands from what Amazon Prime actually is and does, to what potential services the brainchild of Dr. Evil cosplayer Jeff Bezos may very well employ.\n\n“Prime Now. Give it to me now. When I press ‘buy,’ put the item in my hand,” he jokes. “Break into my house and put the food I ordered in my mouth. Help me chew it and then push it down my esophagus with a stick. Then, pull the feces out of my anus for me.”\n\nAnyone who has seen Chieng’s previous specials, like 2013’s The Ron Way or 2014’s Chieng Reaction, shouldn’t be surprised by any of this. From his earliest stand-up days, the comic has primarily chosen those subjects that annoy him for the basis of his comedy. As Chieng explained to me in a previous interview:\n\n“Early on, I realized my best bits come from something that really pisses me off. I usually try to think about or remember those things for later use. But in my experience, at least, it’s always been a flag or a signpost for me when something makes me really angry,” he said. “I always try to explore those things or moments because that’s always been good for my comedy. It’s definitely a big part of my creative expression.”\n\nWhat’s more, his approach to “angry comedy” has never been akin to Kinison’s screaming or Hicks’s ranting. On the contrary, Chieng quickly realized that, if anger was going to be his muse, he would need to shape it into something other than a soapbox with jokes. “You can do 10 minutes of yelling at people,” he explained. “But if you want to do an hour, or if you want to headline, then you have to be able to see nuance and give a little bit more.”\n\nHence his extended bit about Amazon Prime going to ridiculous, hilarious, and frighteningly possible extremes for almost five minutes — just as Black railed against the weather and its adherents for nine minutes 20 years earlier.\n\nNo wonder The Daily Show, both in Jon Stewart’s day and now during Trevor Noah’s tenure as host, has employed Black as an occasional correspondent for his “Back in Black” segments. Their subjects and lengths vary, depending on the topic, but the result is always the same — the comedian takes the floor to yell, albeit intelligently, about something that’s irritating him. This also what Chieng does in his own regular The Daily Show segment, “Everything Is Stupid.”\n\nObviously, Chieng isn’t trying to copy and paste Black’s comedy methodology. Angry comedy and, by that same token, angry comedians are a dime a dozen. They always have been, and they always will be, but it’s always a breath of fresh air when a comic who uses their anger for material does so in a careful manner. The Chiengs, Blacks, and Bill Burrs of the American stand-up scene are doing precisely this, and it’s wonderful."
