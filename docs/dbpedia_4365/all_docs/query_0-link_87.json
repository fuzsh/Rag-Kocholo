        "text": "EPIX Unites All-Star Cast for Sam Kinison Tribute\n\nSam Kinison: Back From Hell Ignites EPIX\n\nNEW YORK -- An all-star cast is gathering on the new premium channel EPIXï¿½ to celebrate the hard-living and outspoken late comedian, Sam Kinison. This dynamic special event weaves interviews and performances by stars Chris Rock, Kathy Griffin, Jay Leno, George Lopez, Ice-T and Denis Leary, and many others, with a filmed tribute at the comedian's old stomping ground, The Comedy Store.\n\nFrequent appearances on \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Late Show with David Letterman,\" drove Kinison to heights of success usually reserved for rock bands. His brash performances and over-the-top style attracted huge audiences and sold-out massive arenas. A cult following and rave reviews made him one of the most promising comedians of his generation until his life was cut short by a drunk driver in 1992.\n\n\"I don't think there's a bit that you could find of Sam's that doesn't reflect the absolute truth of the situation,\" says comedian Denis Leary.\n\n\"We're excited to bring together some of today's most talented artists to pay homage to Kinison. He was a groundbreaker whose performances inspired so many,\" said Mark Greenberg, EPIX President.\n\nSam Kinison: Back From Hell will air on EPIX in February 2010. It is the third comedy event announced by EPIX, joining Eddie Izzard Live from Wembley which will run during EPIX's October launch weekend and Lewis Black: Stark Raving Black which will air in December 2009.\n\nAbout EPIX\n\nEPIX, a joint venture between Viacom Inc. (NYSE: VIA and VIA.B), its Paramount Pictures unit, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.
