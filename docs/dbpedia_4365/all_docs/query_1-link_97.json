A former Pentecostal preacher, he performed stand-up routines that were characterized by intense sudden tirades, punctuated with his distinctive scream, similar to charismatic preachers. Initially performing for free, Kinison became a regular fixture at the Comedy Store where he met and eventually befriended such comics as Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. Kinison's comedy was crass observational humor, especially towards women and dating, and his popularity grew quickly, earning him appearances on Late Night with David Letterman and Saturday Night Live.\n\nKinison received a Grammy nomination in 1988 for the single \"Wild Thing\" from his Have You Seen Me Lately? album, and a posthumous win in 1994 for Best Spoken Comedy Album, Live from Hell.\n\nFind A Grave Memorial\n\nSam Kinison Birth 8 Dec 1953 Yakima, Yakima County, Washington, USA Death 10 Apr 1992 (aged 38) Needles, San Bernardino County, California, USA Burial: Memorial Park Cemetery Tulsa, Tulsa County, Oklahoma, USA Show Map Plot Section 28, Lot 92, Space 3 Memorial ID 1282\n\nComedian.
