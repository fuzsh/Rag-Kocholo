        "text": "Meet the man The New Yorker magazine dubbed \"GOD'S COMIC\". In an 8-page article, The New Yorker magazine says that Brad’s “style is frantic, aggressive, and caustic, with echoes of Robin Williams, Sam Kinison, and George Carlin.” His unique style, forged in the comedy clubs he performed in early in his career, features sarcasm, biting wit and intelligence. With an energetic approach and no topics off limits, he is the only comic that uses his Judeo/Christian worldview for social commentary and pointing out laughable faith-based everyday experiences. This was unheard of 25 years ago in the Christian comedy genre, and still is to this day!\n\nBrad Stine is known as the man that revolutionized and launched the new era of Christian comedy in America with his breakout album “Put A Helmet On!” that single-handedly redefined the way Christian stand-up comedy could be perceived and performed.\n\nHis cutting edge methods literally opened the door for many Christian comics that would follow. Many of whom have acknowledged his influence including Tim Hawkins, John Crist, and Michael Jr and a host of others whose careers and styles have been impacted by Brad Stine.\n\nHe is also the most media covered Christian comedian in the country being featured in mainstream media outlets unlike any Christian comic before or since. Because Brad sees his comedy as being a missionary to America, Brads calling is to bring the gospel in unique ways to influence the cultural narrative.\n\nHe tours nationally on a regular basis performing in clubs, churches, and fundraisers for Crisis pregnancy centers, ministries and conservative causes and candidates.\n\nBrad has been a regular live social commentator on Fox & Friends every Monday morning for six months. He has been featured in the New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today. He has been profiled on NBC Nightly News, HBO, Showtime, CNN, Glenn Beck, Hannity and Colmes, NPR’S Fresh Air, ABC Nightline TWICE, MTV, and Comedy Central. He has had material published in Readers Digest and Focus on the Family magazine.\n\nBrad has been featured in the New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today. He has been featured on NBC Nightly News, HBO, Showtime, CNN, Glenn Beck, Hannity and Colmes, NPR’S Fresh Air, ABC Nightline, MTV, and Comedy Central. He has had material published in Readers Digest and Focus on the Family magazine.\n\nHe has five original DVDs featuring his comedy, and has written two books, Live from Middle America; Rants from a Red-State Comedian, published by Hudson Street Press and Being a Christian Without Being an Idiot.\n\nHe has appeared in numerous films as an actor and producer including, Persecuted, Christmas With a Capital C, My many sons, Welcome to Paradise, Sarah’s Choice, Homeless for the holidays, Marriage retreat, and many more to come.\n\nHe tours nationally on a regular basis performing in clubs, churches, and fundraisers for Crisis pregnancy centers, ministries and conservative causes and candidates.\n\n\"To whom it may concern:\n\nI am writing this letter to endorse Brad Stine as an excellent choice for a fundraising event at your Crisis Pregnancy Center. Brad brings to the event his Christian worldview in a very unique and refreshing way. His humor lightened our events, which we labeled “A Celebration of Life,” in a way that brought the largest payoff that we have seen in our 16 year history of fundraising. We know that God’s hand was on this event and used Brad to bring the message that all life is valuable to God\n\nThe Board of the Pregnancy Resource Center of Marion County in West Virginia utilized Brad Stine for two events. We held a “Family Night” on Friday night where local families could bring kids and teens out to hear Brad’s wonderful brand of clean comedy. This event was advertised in churches and on the radio and was packed out. We charged a small fee for this event ($5 for kids and $7 for adults), which covered the cost of bringing him in to speak. The next night he was the main event at our more traditional fundraising banquet. This banquet was attended mainly by adults and again was packed out. The comments we got from both events were very positive. Everyone loved Brad and they not only told us this, but they showed us by opening their purses and giving to the ministry.\n\nBrad gave the appeal for funds and my favorite line that he used during the appeal was as follows:\n\n“Some of you may say, well I will take this pledge card home and pray about this.\n\nDo you really think you need to ask God whether he wants you to support the Pregnancy Resource Center to help them save the lives of the unborn?\n\nWhat do you think God will say…. Nooo, you shouldn’t support the ministry, use that money to go out to eat.”\n\nHe said it so much better, but you can get the point. He can make people see the truth in a gentle way with humor. He is very effective at bringing God’s perspective and truth front and center by the use of comedy. I truly appreciate that he took time from his busy schedule to come to West Virginia to partner with us in this way. He is an excellent man, a great comedian, and a true blessing.\n\nSincerely,\"\n\nDr. Marjorie Darrah\n\nPresident, Board of Directors Pregnancy Resource Center of Marion County"
