        "text": "Vice TV has set the premiere date and released the trailer for “Dark Side of Comedy” Season 2, its “Dark Side” spinoff series that explores the behind-the-scenes stories of iconic comedians.\n\nSeason 2 subjects include Robin Williams, Sam Kinison, Joan Rivers, Carlos Mencia, Phil Hartman, Tracy Morgan, the sitcom “Family Matters,” Ellen DeGeneres, Norm MacDonald and Gilda Radner.\n\n“Dark Side of Comedy” Season 2 is narrated by Dave Foley (“NewsRadio,” “Kids in the Hall”) with commentators including Pauly Shore, Marc Maron, Tiffany Haddish, Pamela Aldon, Sally Jesse Raphael, Mike Binder and Rolanda Watts.\n\nIn the Season 2 trailer, Binder says Williams was “running with a lot of really scary figures — and Robin himself was kind of a scary figure for a while.” Haddish says Rivers “was a hustler,” and describes her as “mean as hell.” And Watts describes an experience where DeGeneres “sat there as if we weren’t even there.”\n\nPer Vice TV’s description for the new installment: “‘Dark Side of Comedy,’ from the creators of ‘Dark Side of the Ring,’ is back for a second season, venturing deeper into the darkest recesses of some of comedy’s greatest minds. With a comic genius felled by a mysterious illness, a disillusioned preacher turned America’s dirtiest stand-up, and a feminist icon famous for vicious take-downs, the hit series returns with more gripping stories from the underbelly of stand-up comedy.”\n\n“Dark Side of Comedy” Season 2 is executive produced by Vanessa Case, Guillermo Garcia and Paul Taylor for Vice Studios, and Falguni Lakhani Adams and Catherine Whyte for Vice TV. Martin Pupp is a producer. The show is a Vice Studios production in partnership with Bell Media’s Crave.\n\nWatch the trailer below."
