She moved to a larger theater at The Venetion in January 2011. She also created and hosted the syndicated improvisational comedy show Ask Rita, which mimicked the format of a talk/advice show. For this she received a Gracie Allen Award from the American Women in Television and Radio.

At age nineteen he discovered stand up comedy with the man who would become his best friend, Sam Kinison. Together the two founded a Rock & Roll Comedy concept that would earn Billboard Magazines “Top Tour” honors by selling out theaters across the country for 5 straight years.\n\nSkyrocketing to the biggest performance stages in the country as a founding member of “The Outlaws” in the late 80’s, and early 90’s, Carl would establish himself as an unparalleled comedic force during the biggest comedy boom of the last fifty years.
