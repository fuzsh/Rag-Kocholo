        "text": "The #MeToo movement is having an impact on comedy as some local comics retool their standup acts and steer away from topics that could be considered offensive.\n\nIt’s an industry where sexual harassment has been endemic, and where a thread of misogyny often runs through the jokes. The tone of stand-up acts has been shifting for a couple years, but has accelerated with Bill Cosby’s recent conviction of aggravated indecent assault and comic Louis CK largely being banished from the world of comedy after being accused of sexual misconduct by several women.\n\nThe #MeToo movement has helped accelerate the pace, too.\n\nMore: SC Republicans under fire for comments on women's movements\n\nGreenville comic and author Carrie Adams said that “you can definitely feel the presence of the #MeToo movement and associated with the LGBT (community) etc. It’s changed a lot in the five years that I’ve been doing comedy. It’s very prevalent now.”\n\nFor Craig Holcombe of Greenville’s No Expectations comedy troupe, that shift in perspective is important and necessary. As Holcombe sees it, there’s no place in comedy for humor that exists specifically to jab at someone for their experiences, race, or gender.\n\nBut that type of humor is prevalent at every rung of the ladder, from local clubs to superstar performances, and it’s practically woven into the DNA of comedy, he said.\n\n“It is a culture full of people who like talking about things that they know make people uncomfortable, with very little regard to people’s feelings,” Holcombe said. “I’ve always held the opinion that comedians can talk about anything, but a specific comedian can’t talk about anything. And so I think that comedy in general has a huge problem with people talking about, in this specific example, people talk about rape and sexual assault as a joke, people with no experience or no real knowledge of what that means to some people. I think in response specifically to the hashtag MeToo, the campaign and everything, I think it’s an amazing thing.”\n\nMore: Greenville's vibrant arts scene features something for everyone. Here's where to look for it.\n\nIn Holcombe’s view, there is plenty of comedic fodder in everyday life without resorting to humor that is designed to be hurtful.\n\nWhile male comics in Greenville are generally respectful of their female counterparts, that’s not always the case with comedians from other cities who perform here, said Evan Harris said, a female comic who has performed with Greenville’s No Expectations comedy troupe.\n\n“What I think is worse than being hit on by comedians is watching one of your peers take the brunt of some unkind words, and then not say anything about it. There are comedians who will pass through who will just tear into a female audience, and think it’s OK,” Harris said. “And they don’t hit men the same way. It’s from a very hurt place, and I like to say something to them about it &mldr; not in an aggressive way, but more like, ‘Hey, that’s really not cool.’”\n\nHarris has faced her share of sexual harassment during her years in comedy, mostly from the audience.\n\nShe recalls being heckled after she made a joke about where her looks fall on a scale of one to 10. The heckling didn’t stop when she left the stage; in fact, Harris said, the guy followed her out to her car.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Adams said she has never had an experience like Harris’, nor has she been the target of misogynistic behavior from male comics.\n\n“I have been very fortunate in comedy,” Adams said. “I know that I’m an outlier because I know from fellow female comics that my lack of experiences is atypical. I know there’s a lot of women out there who have experienced harassment and things of that nature, or they have felt a negative bias, but I really haven’t.”\n\nThat’s partly due to the sensitivity of the male comics in No Expectations, Adams said.\n\nThey “take care of it if they see it, and check it. &mldr; The people running comedy (in Greenville), I would say, are very aware and do their best to make it a safe place,” she said.\n\nToo much political correctness\n\nChris Phillips, whose stage name is Moo-Moo, also works with No Expectations and has performed standup since 2000. But he has a different perspective on the idea of sensitivity and political correctness in comedy.\n\nThere’s too much of it, Phillips said.\n\n“I’ve been around comedy for a very long time,” Phillips said. “Comedy is still an art. Unless you’re actually harassing women or assaulting anyone, you can get away with pretty much anything as long as it’s funny and you’re not hurting anyone.”\n\nMore: Comic Kevin Hart brings 'Irresponsible' tour to Greenville\n\nAmong his idols are controversial comics such as Andrew Dice Clay and the late George Carlin and Sam Kinison, performers who “used to push the envelope as far as it could go. &mldr; Those guys never draw the line.”\n\nWhen he’s writing a routine, Phillips said, he takes a similar approach, not censoring himself at all during the writing process.\n\n“I don’t draw a line because I don’t want to edit myself before I even write. I mean, I’m writing; I’m not harming anyone. There’s a big difference between those two things. &mldr; A lot of comics have become really PC. I’m not a PC comic. I’m not politically correct; I don’t march to that drum. Other comics have talked about it; I’m not one of the ones who do.”\n\nHarris said she thinks the idea of drawing a line can be subjective, and that the audience often will let a comic know when they’ve gone too far.\n\n“I think it’s always like a certain amount of payoff,” Harris said. “If you think that your point is a valid one to make, and you get a big laugh at the end, then, no. But I think a lot of the time, those jokes just fall flat. I guess anything that pushes against being too PC, or making an edgy joke just to be edgy, isn’t well-crafted, then it’s disrespectful, is how I feel about that.”\n\nMore: Racial slur changes tone of Greenville comedy show\n\n'The thought police'\n\nThe idea of comics being subjected to the “thought police” bothers Adams, who said she was surprised by the reaction she received from a joke she made about women at a recent open mic.\n\n“Basically, sort of ‘all women’ was the butt of my joke, and I can feel the audience clench, like ‘you can’t say that.’ And it was really interesting, because the joke was really pretty mild,” Adams said. “It wasn’t anything, in my opinion, offensive, but it was like women had become this sacred cow. And I think sacred cows are terrible for comedy, wherever they’re from. On the flip side of that, it’s extraordinarily difficult to write a funny rape joke. &mldr; These things aren’t funny, rape isn’t funny. There are all these things that just aren’t funny, and never have been.”\n\nThe “callout culture,” in which the public or other comedians publicly shame comics for the opinions they express, has become rampant but “tedious,” Adams said.\n\n“A lot of people work out their jokes on Facebook and Twitter. A lot of the time, a joke really makes its debut online before it makes its debut on stage. And if it doesn’t fit in with the sensibilities of the time, there’s going to be somebody who calls a comedian out. &mldr; I don’t like it,” Adams said.\n\nMore: Steve Martin, Martin Short comedy special filmed in Greenville coming to Netflix\n\n'Boys' club' mentality\n\nHolcombe worries that the “boys’ club” atmosphere of comedy, and the misogynistic thread that runs through some comics’ material, can discourage talented women from trying their hand at standup.\n\nUnlike other professions, comics can’t get fired from their jobs, Holcombe pointed out. While specific venues might refuse to allow a comic to perform, or booking agents may decline to work with a performer, the audience ultimately determines a comic’s success.\n\nNowhere is that more visible than at an open mic gig, he said.\n\n“We do a weekly open mic on Monday nights at Coffee Underground, and every week you see that spectrum laid out in stark, sometimes very stark relief. Sometimes you see somebody going on stage and trying to create, like, healing comedy about a trauma that they’ve been through or just hard experiences and sharing their point of view and making it funny. And then the next person to get on stage makes the most crass remark just to kind of make people uncomfortable,” Holcombe said.\n\nComic Ron White is known for his no-filter, politically incorrect routines. When White’s on stage, anything is fair game for his biting humor.\n\nMore: Hey Anderson, here’s how comedian Ron White will make your cheeks hurt from laughing\n\nWhite said in a recent interview that he hasn’t changed his approach to performing in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and he has no plans to change.\n\n“As long as I am talking about me and my life, that's what I do for a living. I don't care about political correctness at all. It is comedy. I pull no punches. I just try not to bore anyone,” White said.\n\nLos Angeles standup comic Rachael O’Brien, who performed in Greenville last month, said in a recent email interview that the push for sensitivity and inclusiveness has made an important impact on comedy.\n\nIt’s no longer “a man’s world,” O’Brien said.\n\n“I think it has opened up a window for all comics to expand their comedic style and shine a light on these issues and be more sensitive — while of course making light of it, like comics do. I also think there's been a good backlash against what maybe women or men deemed to be ‘cool’ to joke about in comedy,” O’Brien said. “Hell, the more struggle you've been through, the better you're able to empathize and have an interesting outlook on the world, which only makes someone a better/smarter comic with original ideas.”"
