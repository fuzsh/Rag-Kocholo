        "text": "Get ready to scream.\n\nSiriusXM is airing rare audio of the late, great Sam Kinison’s stand-up. Captured by an audience member days before his 1992 death in a car crash on his way to a performance, it’s the final recording of the profoundly profane comic.\n\nFirst, we’re premiering an audio documentary hosted by Ron Bennington about how Kinison went from a Pentecostal preacher to a famous comedian selling out shows.\n\n“Sam Kinison, man, that’s who made yelling cool,” Kevin Hart says.\n\n“It’s a sad story, because he was a great comic,” Andrew Dice Clay reflects. “He was a really great comic, one of the only ones I could sit and watch. Even if he was fighting with me, I’d go over to the Comedy Store and laugh. I loved him. I loved what he did, because he did understand performing.”\n\nHear interviews about his legacy with Hart, Clay, Louie Anderson, Josh Gad, Carl LaBove, Marc Maron, Jackie Martling and more when the special airs today at 3 p.m. ET on SiriusXM Comedy Greats (Ch. 94), the SiriusXM app and online."
