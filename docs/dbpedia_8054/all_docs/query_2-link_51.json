        "text": "Synopsis\n\nA Bear Robotics civil servant robot in Gumi City Council, South Korea was found unresponsive after a fall between floors. Employed since August 2023, it handled tasks, called elevators, and had a civil service card. Called the first robot suicide, media discussions in robot-dense South Korea follow. No second robot officer will be appointed.\n\nFor the first time, a robot civil servant employed by the Gumi City Council in South Korea was discovered unresponsive after an apparent fall down a flight of stairs. The incident, which occurred around 4 pm last Thursday, has been termed as the country's first robot suicide, according to media reports.\n\nAccording to the city council, the 'Robot supervisor' was found smashed and lying in the stairwell between the first and second floors of the council building. Mirroring humans, witnesses reported tha the robot \"circling in one spot as if something was there\" before the incident occurred. The exact cause of the fall is still under investigation, and the city council official said that \"Pieces have been collected and will be analysed by the company.\"\n\nAbout the robot servant:\n\nThe robot, which was officially a part of the city hall staff, had been diligently assisting with daily document deliveries, city promotion, and providing information to local residents. \"It was officially a part of the city hall, one of us,\" another official said. \"It worked diligently.\" The news of the robot's apparent suicide has sparked discussions in local media and online communities, with people questioning the workload and the reasons behind the incident.\n\nIn August 2023, a pioneering robot began serving in the city, marking a significant advance in robotic assistance. Developed by Bear Robotics, a startup from California specializing in robot-waiter technology, this robot was operational from 9 am to 6 pm and held its own civil service officer card. Unlike conventional models limited to a single floor, the Gumi City Council's robot had the capability to independently call elevators and navigate between floors.\n\nSouth Korea, recognized for its proactive integration of robotics, boasts the highest density of robots globally, with one industrial robot for every 10 employees according to the International Federation of Robotics. Following a recent incident, however, the Gumi City Council has indicated that it currently has no plans to introduce a second robot officer.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nHNIs invested in Piramal PMS.
