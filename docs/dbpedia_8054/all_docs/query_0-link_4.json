        "text": "When you are done with everything else, I do actually have 4 flags that I have been holding off on for a very very very long time that you might find fun. Just let me know when you're ready :) Fry1989 eh?\n\nPost away! I only have those Aussie ones and that Uzbek seal on my to-do list at present and neither should take more than a day. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nAlrighty. Well as you know, we have several royal standards for Queen Elizabeth II. Well I found some time ago that special ones were made for her coronation in 1953 in a shorter ratio. and I've been wanting to request them for at least a year and a half. The photos are [1] and [2]. I'm not sure of the ratio, but they're all the same and shorter than 1:2, and in the case of Australia/Canada/New Zealand, they're missing the blue disc with monogram that is on the current standards. Also in the case of Australia, it used the alternative style of ermine. IDK if any were made for the other realms then the 4 I have photos for. I guess you'll need:\n\nFile:Royal Standard of Australia.svg\n\nFile:Royal Standard of Canada.svg\n\nFile:Royal Standard of New Zealand.svg\n\nFile:Royal Standard of the United Kingdom.svg\n\nI know it'll take some effort, but if you're up to the task it would be wonderful. IDK what to call them, \"coronation standards\" or something I guess, but that's not hugely important, we can figure that out. Let me know how you feel :) Fry1989 eh?\n\nWhat exactly needs changing other than the proportions, the removal of the blue badge and the change in ermine? They all appear to be exactly the same as the existing royal standards apart from those three differences. If that's the case it shouldn't take long to do. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nNot really that much. THe UK one used the un-breasted harp unlike on the current file, the Canadian one used green maple leaves because they weren't changed to red until 1957, the Australian one used the different ermine but also a somewhat more fanciful lion for Tazz, and without the blue disc and commonwealth star there was room for a bigger badge for both Victoria and South Australia. Other then those differences, it really is just changing the proportions for them all. Still don't know what we should name them though. Fry1989 eh?\n\nHow's this for a first go? NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nIt's getting there, but I need to double check because it looks crooked towards the right to me, like a painting hanging on the wall a little off. Is that just my bad eyes?\n\nThere are some changes I would still recommend though. First is I'd say the 6 boxes are either square or narrower then they are tall (a little tough to tell). Second, Victoria's badge of the southern cross is less distorted and more like the actual constellation in the photo since there's more room. It also uses the Tudor crown. New South Wales section has a significantly larger cross and stars. Queensland'se section uses a maltese cross alot more like that on the state flag, though also narrower than it is tall. Last major thing that needs changing is that the ermine is 5 down, 6 across, and somewhat larger. Fry1989 eh?\n\nI really can't glean that level of detail from the pictures as I don't know what I'm looking for! I think the other ones are less complicated, though, so if there are things I should be looking out for on those let me know, otherwise I'll assume, like I did here, that there aren't any! NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nWell that's where I can come in to help. I'm good with mathematical geometry, so I can re-arrange the stars for Victoria and make NSW section bigger if you like. But what's important is it's nothing beyond \"fixable\" :). And yes I would agree the other three are much easier compared to this one. Fry1989 eh?\n\nAnd the good news is it's not crooked, it's either my bad eyes or my computer table is wonky lol. Fry1989 eh?\n\nCan we still work on it together? I hope you're not upset at me or anything. Fry1989 eh?\n\nOf course! Sorry, I've been doing other things the last couple of days so I haven't touched them yet, but I can have a crack tonight. What do you need me to alter on the Aussie one for you to fix it up? NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nHow's this for NZ? About right? NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nGreat. I think though that we should go with 3:5 as the ratio for all the flags, it looks like that's what it is by my eye, and I know they're all the same. The thing you need to know for New Zealand also is that it's 3 ships, not two. I'm also working on the Australian one with the mathematical things and any corrections I can make myself. I'll be done shortly, and will upload it as a temp file so you can compare and we can go from there. How's that sound? Fry1989 eh?\n\n3:5, eh? I can work with that. I'll have to fix the Canadian one I just uploaded, though. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nLOL sorry about that, I should have said it from the beginning. Also remember the Canadian one used a darker blue and green maple leaves instead of red, like on File:Canadian Red Ensign 1921-1957 (with disk).svg. Fry1989 eh?\n\nFixed, I hope? NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nExcept the Canadian one didn't use the lady harp. Sorry. I know it's all these things that are confusing. Fry1989 eh?\n\nHope you don't mind, but I applied my changes directly to File:Coronation Standard of Australia.svg instead of uploading separately first for comparison because I think I actually got it pretty good. If there's anything you want to change, feel free but I don't have any complaints. New Zealand's is perfect, thank you so much! The only correction Canada's needs is to drop the female harp. I know \"she\" was in the pre-1957 Canadian coat of arms, but they didn't put it on the standard for whatever reasoning. As for the UK, whenever you're up to it, I really am thankful. Fry1989 eh?\n\nSorry about the Canada debacle. I rushed in to add that harp as it was on the FOTW version without bothering to check actual sources. My bad...\n\nAnyway, I've replaced the one on the Cor. standard with one that looks slightly closer to the picture than the stylised one they're using today. Let me know if it looks appropriate to you.\n\nAs for the Aussie one, the only thing I would change is to make the ermine slightly smaller, which I have done. I've also reduced the filesize by ~100kb by doing the following: instead of duplicating the crown and the ermine to make an exact copy (I don't know how you do it, but I use Ctrl-D), I made a \"clone\" which copies the geometry without making a completely new copy - it basically draws the original one twice - which you can do with Alt-D. It's usually not much of a problem, but with something with a lot of elements like the crown, it really does have an impact. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nDone? NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nWe're soooo close, but it's still rubbing me the wrong way. Based on the positions of things in the Aussie and Canadian one, they must be even shorter, more like 3:4 or 4:5. You mind if I play around a little with the Aussie one until I figure which I think it is? I don't want you to have to do extra work on my account until I'm certain. Fry1989 eh?\n\nMy brain hurts like you wouldn't believe with all this math trying to get it right. My worst subject in school and now I rely on it so much here to make things exact, oh the irony. I'll have a 3:4 version available some time tomorrow, I don't think it's shorter then that. I'll do some comparisons and if everything matches up, I'll let you know. Thanks friend. Fry1989 eh?\n\nYeah, I think 3:4 is the right one. Sorry about that :( Fry1989 eh?\n\nOh! Thank you very much!

SuzanneKn (talk)\n\nHi Nik, can you help me to fix this logo?. I don't know why it is only appears with a half sentence while when I click the download thumbnail, it appears to be in full sentence. — ᴀʟʀᴇᴀᴅʏ ʙᴏʀᴇᴅ ʜᴜʜ?\n\nIt's due to your choice of fonts, I'm afraid. The renderer only has certain fonts available, so the ones you chose (Adobe Gothic Std B and Arial Narrow) have been replaced on the thumbnails by, I think, Liberation Sans. You have two choices:\n\neither you replace the fonts in the logo with similar ones that are available to the renderer (see the link)\n\nor, in Inkscape (or whichever program you use), you need to convert the text to paths, which will increase the filesize a bit, but will keep the text looking exactly as it does on your machine\n\nAs it's a logo, I would recommend the second option, as it's likely quite important to retain the exactness of the fonts. Unfortunately I don't have the Adobe font though, so that's something you'll need to do yourself. If you need any more help, feel free to get back in touch. :) NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nYay! Thank you!

Thank you. -- Shyoon1 (talk)\n\nThe source for the seal shows that it matches the same blue as the national flag of South Korea, and government sources show that all the government service flags are supposed to match as well.

You don't have any sources except for photographs, and if you trust photos so much then you should accept that photos of the seal show it dark blue like the national flag. Fry1989 eh?\n\nOkay, I admit the background color of seal is dark blue. However, do not change to the previous version of presidential standard of South Korea as you like. As I presented the photograph earlier, that was the very recent cabinet meeting. please change the background color of standard when the presidential standard actually changes. -- 19:52, 25 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nI want to thank you again for so much of your work on my graphic lab requests.

Thank you.\n\nYours sincerely, JuTa\n\nHey NikNaks, thanks for the comment at the Graphic Lab, but I'm confused as to what you said. You say here that somebody has already updated the color for the logo yesterday, but when I go to the file, the last upload was March of 2013... Am I missing something? I updated the colors in the article, but didn't mess with the logo. Also, thanks for the tip about using Notepad, but I don't have that program on my computer... I have a MacBook. I don't know if I have any other programs on the Mac that does it, either, so I'll have to look. Thanks, Corky | Chat?\n\n@Corkythehornetfan: My apologies! I'm clearly not with it today... I saw \"March 30\" and assumed someone had simply edited the file already; I also misread \"#841647\" for \"#841617\". Entirely my fault. Serves me right. I'll make the change for you now. For the record, I think \"TextEdit\" should be installed on your Mac for this kind of thing, but there are others online (emacs is well-known, but there are more). I recommend trying to find your text editor as it might come in handy for similar images in the future. Sorry again! NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nNo problem, NikNaks; we all have those days! TextEdit is installed, I just don't much about it. I'll mess around with it and check out emacs and other programs. Thanks for your help! Corky | Chat?\n\nHi Nick,\n\nYou did somewhat with File:Wotp-roads.svg and it worked. Can you try it again with File:MBT.en.svg?. That would be great!.\n\nI think it isn't commons because when I want to upload a new version, Ubuntu's file selection window show already a wrong rendered image. --Keysanger\n\n@Keysanger: Not entirely sure what the issue was (yet again) but this time I had to strip out some of the text code to get it to render correctly. I'd like to make a few suggestions that might help avoid issues in future (hopefully):\n\nUse MediaWiki fonts: Liberation Sans and DejaVu Sans are both fine, but \"FreeSans\" won't render correctly, although it still shouldn't do the weird thing that it ended up doing here\n\nTry to start with a canvas in integer units and keep it in integer units wherever possible\n\nAlways save your file as Plain SVG or, even better, Optimised SVG, although be careful with the latter as it can leave you with slightly unusual positions for some items. (I'm assuming you're using Inkscape given the contents of the file, but I could be wrong)\n\nUse the grid to line up your text\n\nEdit the SVG directly using a text editor if possible\n\nAgain, I have no confidence that any of these will help fix your issue in the future, but these are things I've gone through and done and the file now renders correctly and is much smaller. If I've inadvertently deleted something or moved something out of place, let me know. If you want to make the edits yourself, don't worry if the file size increases; this is inevitable unless you use a text editor. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nI have thought a long time about the source of the trouble and looked into the plain file. Sometimes when I am working with text my Inkscape gets blocked and doesn't respond anymore and the monitor gets darker. I click file->save an then \"quit\" and then I start it again. It could be the reason, but I can't reproduce it. On the other hand I wonder that the text file contains a really old directory of my PC. \"treck\" and \"data3\" were directories of my PC at least 3 or 4 years ago. Any way, thanks and let me know if you find the cause of the trouble. --Keysanger\n\nHello, are you going to convert all the silver/gold/platinum record icons to svg? If you don't have one yourself, here would be a list of them (and the missing ones). I also use the files in the template de:Vorlage:AfM. Regards, XanonymusX (talk)\n\n@XanonymusX: Well, I wasn't planning to before, but I most certainly can! It seems quite straightforward to make the rest of them (except perhaps the \"diamond\" one). Hopefully I shouldn't have any problems replacing the files on the various wikis, but if you're able to help on de-wiki as and when that'd be great. At the moment somebody (user \"Lk95\") has decided to revert some of the automated changes, but I can't see a reason behind it. Am I right in thinking I should have applied for some kind of flag to make mass changes? If you've already done that on my behalf, then thank you, but please let me know if I need to do something. Google translating the pages where my edits are mentioned doesn't seem very clear. I'm never sure exactly what the protocol for this kind of thing is!\n\nAnyway, the images. I will make the 1x and 5x versions first for each colour (except silver, as it seems there's only one) and then you can see what they look like and whether there need to be changes made before I make the rest - perhaps you could create a test-page somewhere to see how they look at small scales, for instance. Once you're happy with them, I'll fill in the gaps and then try to mass-replace the PNGs. Does that sound reasonable?\n\nI'll start making them now. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nI've made a start, but it seems that the GlobalReplace software has been replacing any instance of \"Gold.png\" instead of only that single file, so \"Double Gold.png\" has also been replaced, even if there is no vector to support it. This was not my intention, but it'll be easy to fix once the files are there. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nYes, I've noticed the problem of the Multi-Gold files. de:Benutzer:Knochen has started to fix some, as it seems. As for the list: this here could be used as a test page for the new files, he will certainly support us. There is enlisted every single one. And yeah, I had asked for you to become autoreviewer. Future edits will be automatically reviewed. I'll have a look at Lk95.--XanonymusX (talk)\n\nWhat about the Diamond one? It looks quite different from the original one. But I don't get what the right colour would be, until now there was a strange mix of them.--XanonymusX (talk)\n\nThank you for your efforts! I didn't mean to cause such a problem. I am quite wary of deliberately editing someone else's page, though, so if they are willing to get on board perhaps they could do so? Also, should I follow the convention I assumed when I uploaded (simple numbering of two, three, etc) or the one using \"double, triple, sextuple\" instead? Does it matter?\n\nRegarding the diamond one, I opted for the easier to create one that's used for 3x, 4x and so on, rather than the one used for 1x and 2x. I could certainly have a go at that style if you think it would be preferred, though. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nOkay, let's wait for a comment by de:Benutzer:Ali1610! He should also know what the correct colour for Diamond is; the one you used can easily be confused with Silver, however, the other one is very similar to the Gold one. I'm unsure what the better option is. The naming is another such thing, for me the new names would be okay, as long as they are sytematical enough for my de:Template:AfM.--XanonymusX (talk)\n\nEither naming convention is fine; I have file-mover rights here so I can simply move to whichever one you desire. The template looks as if either would work, but for simplicity's sake, I'll stick with the already existing one (double, triple) unless you want to change it to numbers or some other method. I could even do 1×, 2×, and so forth. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nI´ll answer tomorrow morning. No time to overview the whole case today anymore, sorry. I´m putting myself into bed now. --Ali1610 (talk)\n\nAs for now, very good work, thanks!--XanonymusX (talk)\n\nI've uploaded 1-10 for platinum and gold. It seems that there is an issue when some of the wider images (at the bottom) as they lose their white flash when they are scaled down to 15px. I will look into this on the village pump to see if anyone has any idea why this is. Until then, I think it is okay to have them block colour, if you agree. I will wait to hear about the diamond one, although I have uploaded an attempt at the gold-style one as the \"double\" for comparison with the white. I'll return to this in the morning. :) NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nActually, one last thing before I sleep. I'm not at all convinced that the way these images are used makes it easy to tell the difference between 4 and those above it at such small scales. Perhaps an alternative way of representing them is needed? NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nI absolutely agree with you on the difficulty of distinguishing between the 4x and so on. This system (like here) was introduced some time ago by a user and doesn't follow the standard, which would more look like this or even like this (the original one, without any images). Many of us criticised this way of hiding information in a tooltip (doesn't help mobile users at all!) plus putting certifications and peak positions together in one small column. Because of this, the new de:Template:Charttabelle doesn't allow this use of the images; I hope, that this will once become the standard (again).--XanonymusX (talk)\n\nNow here is my proposal: I would like to have only the single gold or platinum or diamond disc as an image and instead of showing it multiple times, we should add a well-readable number which is the information how many discs of this type were given. I suppose the number color red to keep it distinguishable from the disc itself. The correct colour for diamond should be this one to avoid a mix-up with the one for silver. Naming of these discs should be as short as possible to not unnecessarily complicate the source code which is long enough now... Is this possible in such a way? @XanonymusX: What do you think?--Ali1610 (talk)\n\nIf you want to use a number to represent the number of discs visually, there is no need to do this in an image; you could do that using a template and wiki formatting. :) I'll have another go at the diamond one a bit later. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nAlso, if someone could help me with this revert, perhaps with reference to this or something, I'd be most grateful. It seems the rest of the changes have been kept now that there are no broken file links. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nI've already thought of including a number by myself; but I don't think that it would solve the problem, because the unclear colour (Gold and Diamond; Silver and Platinum) remains and in my opinion an \"explanation\" (like the one AfM provides) would still be needed. We can experiment on that later with a template (even with a new version of AfM), like NikNaks suggested, but for now I guess we should just stick to the Commons system and finalize the svg conversion. Once they are homogeneous, we can look for a better solution on de:WP. For the file names you're right, maybe a little shorter would be handier.--XanonymusX (talk)\n\nI've updated the diamond, by the way, and hopefully it's closer to the PNG, although in my opinion, the white version is less like the silver one than this is to the gold. If you pick a naming convention I can move all the files fairly easily, just let me know. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nHi NikNaks, the quality of your Gold record icon.svg is not okay. It is larger than the other images. If you intend to replace all images (silver/platinum/diamond) they will look the same, but I am not quite sure if they still fit everywhere with the px measures for the smaller png images. Another problem is the resolution. Look at de:Janet Jackson/Diskografie in the bottom section as an example. The gold icon not only is different in color and size, it also looks pixelated and deformed. If you zoom it up to the size of your thumb you will see that a third on the right of the disc is almost a straight line. Also the top looks like it has been cut off (size?). So please improve the image as this is no adequate replacement. I would also recommend not to use black as color for the rim but the dark grey that is used in the png images. The svg reminds me of the pixel images I created with Microsoft Paint 20 years ago. The images will look smoother when there is less contrast in the colors. Best wishes -- HvW (talk)\n\nI am not entirely sure why you have decided to take quite such an antagonistic stance. With regard to your points:\n\nThe \"size\" of the SVG is entirely irrelevant. It is rendered at the same height as the other images (I believe this is what you refer to by \"px measures\"), there is simply less empty padding around it, particularly top and bottom - when the others are replaced this will become a non-issue.\n\nI don't agree at all that the image looks deformed or \"pixelated\". It is simply a sharper image than the others (which are essentially just blurry at that scale anyway) which makes it look unusual compared to the others.\n\nThe rim is black in File:Gold.png (and indeed on the Silver and Platinum PNGs as well). I do not understand where you are looking.\n\nIf you want to provide criticism of the images, please understand the limitations of the SVG renderer at such small sizes of image, but equally understand that your opinion that they are \"deformed\" or like something you could do in Paint is needlessly offensive. If others share your opinion then I'm more than welcome to have another go at doing so, or indeed create a different set of images rather than direct replacements for the existing PNGs. But I sincerely hope that your view that very blurry blobs are better than slightly sharper blobs isn't a common one. I also recommend you take a look at the whole list so that you can get an impression of how the SVG versions look compared to one another, rather than the PNGs. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nNow then, you cannot deny that at 15px the rightmost part of the disc is turned into a straight line, and disc and straight line do not go together. And this may be my personal opinion, but I prefer a \"blurry\" image to clearly visible steps in a curved object. Call me old-fashioned but when I started with computers the use of BMP images was discouraged exactly because of this pixelation on low resolution screens and now it comes back with vectorization? This somehow seems paradox. I apologize if you find the Paint remark offensive. This just is what it was all about back then. And you are right, both images (PNG and SVG) look the same in full size. At 15px the black in the PNG turn into a \"blurry\" grey. This is an improvement! If you hold up a CD or similar discs they do not have black rims. Maybe the original full size image is not perfect but works \"accidentially\" in low size. I do not know where this image is used in full size anyway. It is almost always used as a small icon and should be as good as possible at about 30px to 15px.\n\nI triggered off the use of these images in the German WP and we had a discussion since then if we really should use them. As Ali and XanonymusX already pointed out the higher certification levels are hardly discernible, so using numbers instead would be a good option. Nobody volunteered to create new images so we just went on using them. Maybe this would be a good opportunity to do it now. If we get rid of the PNGs we should do it properly. It would be great if you could come up with a proposal and my nagging will be of some use ;-) I do not think the PNGs were the ultimate solution and the SVGs are the ultimate solution. Best wishes -- HvW (talk)\n\n@HvW: Sorry, I didn't see your response here. I'm currently preparing for my finals next week so I haven't been paying this close attention.\n\nI am not sure there is anything to be done about the SVGs, other than attempting to fiddle with them a bit until they lose that line on the right, which is not necessarily even possible at that scale with the renderer as it is. In my opinion, it would be better to simply use circular discs rather than these tilted ellipses (both easier to identify as a disc and less likely to cause problems with the renderer) with a number alongside if it reached multiple levels. I am unlikely to ever use these myself in an article though so I was hoping for more input from the users of the actual files in that regard. If you have particular images that would fit your idea then I am more than happy to try my hand at making them for you, but this is my personal suggestion. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nThe problem is that certifications are not my main topic and I am already behind with many other things. And the German \"certifications experts\" are not really helpful either. So I will keep this on my to-do list and for now I will accept it as it is. Hopefully something will come up sooner or later. Thanks for your commitment with the images anyway and good luck for your exams. Best wishes -- HvW (talk)\n\n@HvW: @Ali1610: @XanonymusX: Any new thoughts on this? NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nTo be honest, no; unfortunately it isn't my main topic either. But thank you anyway for your commitment. As I don't expect any new \"decision\" in this direction to be made within the next months, I would suggest to simply complete the task by replacing all of the remaining pngs with the new svgs (for technical reasons, as for the first one), without further changes. If the \"certification experts\" have other ideas, I guess that we will have the opportunity to discuss this at some point in the nearer future; but as for then... Regards, XanonymusX (talk)\n\nI agree, worst thing we could do is stop halfway through. Since we don't want to go back, we should complete the current replacements. Even if it means that we have to do it all over again in the future with new images. But as we have no concept and can't fix a date this could never happen or not happen the way we are planning now. So it makes no sense to wait on. Best wishes -- HvW (talk)\n\nSome more svg were created and the png replaced by the svg version files. --Tommes\n\nThe File:Triple Gold record icon.svg is not existent\n\nFile:Quintuple Gold record icon.svg also and File:Sextuple Gold record icon.svg also --Knochen ﱢﻝﱢ‎\n\nAre coming, see above.--XanonymusX (talk)\n\nI would like to ask your second opinion on a triangle with rounded corners. AnonMoos was kind enough to create File:W series triangle.svg as part of some signs I'm working on. However the geometry has me a bit confused. This construction sheet is the one they used and it shows the length of each side being 600 if the triangle had straight corners, but the construction sheets for the signs when making the symbols show the length of each side being 600 with the rounded corners. Does that not mean that the SVG should be changed so each side is 600 long from the edge of each rounded corner? Fry1989 eh?\n\nWell, goodness. You've got two completely conflicting sources there by the looks of things. It depends entirely on which one is more reliable as to which measurement you choose to use. I'd like to contribute that the values for \"Y\" on the set of three images are almost exactly what you would expect for the first construction (with straight corners) as they're sqrt(3)*X. Equally, the lines for Y aren't necessarily exactly where they should be either (see here) which might simply be the way the page has been digitised, but it seems more like an error on the construction as well. So for my money, I'd guess that the construction set for the three have been made rather haphazardly, but without knowing the details about the origins of the sources that's all I can say I'm afraid, otherwise it's all just conjecture. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nThe source is a PDF from the roads department of the Philippines, I can email it to you if you would like to examine it better. What is really confusing is that both conflisting sources are in the same PDF, so before I start constructing the symbols I gotta figure out what dimensions are correct for the triangle and it's confusing the hell out of me. Fry1989 eh?\n\nWell, I'm not sure my judgement is going to be any better than yours! But by all means send me an email. Can you do that through wiki or do you need my address? NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nI can't do an attachment with the wiki email, so I would need you to email me and I can respond with the PDF attached. I know you're feeling as confused as I am, but I suck with this sort of geometric mathematics so the more support I can find for what's right the more secure I will feel in doing the symbols. Fry1989 eh?\n\nSorry, ended up watching the election coverage until this morning so I've only just had a chance to look at the doc. It seems like the X and Y measurements for the entire selection of W-series signs is erratic. The guidelines are regularly drawn such that they're inside the red border or well outside as often as they're drawn touching the edges. Also, look at things like W1-2 or W2-5. The junction depicted on the actual design is actually significantly different in shape to the construction on the squared grid. The same is true of W4-1. W5-9 doesn't even display the same graphic! Compare these images with those in section 3 of the document that actually discusses their use, and you'll see that in most cases, the construction grid has the more accurate image.\n\nIn my personal opinion, it seems as if the letters (and indeed the graphic) to the left in each case is simply there to give visual guidance by eye to where the various dimensions are, rather than act as an accurate portrayal of the designs, which is instead given by the construction of the base (with the pointy triangle, as discussed before) and the grid showing the exact construction for each particular sign. Whether or not this is the intention is unclear from the document, and there does not appear to be any clarification in the introduction to the design section either (or on page 36, although there is reference to dimensions there as well), but this is my impression. I hope this helps in some way! NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nSo I imagine you support using the file as created by AnonMoos in the proportions on the blank construction sheet? As for the election, I hope you weren't too disappointed ;) Fry1989 eh?\n\nIf that is the one made assuming the rounded triangle is inscribed inside a pointy one, then yes. :P And unfortunately it seems like my left-ish wing views will be on the backburner this time around. Better luck next time I suppose. NikNaks talk - gallery - wikipedia\n\nThanks, they have been working out pretty good :) Fry1989 eh?\n\nHello NikNaks.

Could you let me know how to properly cite you, please? — Preceding unsigned comment added by Saevers (talk • contribs)\n\nHello there! @Saevers:\n\nAs I am not the originator of the idea for the image, I don't feel comfortable taking any credit for it!\n\nI have changed the licence credit on the image to release it into the public domain. I therefore imagine you can credit it is as a public domain image available on Wikimedia Commons, with a link. If you need a named credit, I recommend trying to contact the author of the original schematic.\n\nCheers!

There's an official document (https://www.emansion.gov.lr/doc/RiverGeeCDA.pdf) which has a drawing of the flag on the first page that looks similar to the one you posted, which is different from the one currently in the article on the flag of Liberia. I was just wondering what the source for your image was\n\nHi NikNaks,\n\nThank you for your contributions to Commons. I noticed File:Supranational European Bodies with NATO members-en.svg is out of date. United Kingdom is no longer an European Union member. Could you update it? Thanks again.
