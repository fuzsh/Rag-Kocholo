        "text": "Answer:\n\nThe life of a sticker depends on the type of sticker material and where its placed. Stickers made out of vinyl and adhesive have a lifespan of up to 5 years while stickers made from cling last up to 6 months. Some specialty materials such as glow in the dark vinyl is not intended for long term outdoor use however it will still last indoors for up to 5 years. Perforated film that creates one-way visibility with its perforated vinyl pattern will last up to 3 years.\n\nFor more detailed information on the types of materials we offer check out our stickers materials page.\n\nAnswer:\n\nUploading an existing image or design to create a custom sticker is easy! However, there are some common issues with uploaded files that can hold up the production process. Below are a list of best practices for uploaded files that can help you avoid delays in receiving your order.\n\nEmbed Images/Files\n\nWhen you place an image or file into your illustrator document, make sure the file is embedded. With the placed file selected, you can see whether the image is Linked or Embedded in the top left corner of the document.\n\nOutline Fonts\n\nAfter you’ve designed your sticker in Illustrator or other design software, make sure that your fonts are outlined. When artwork is submitted without outlined text, we may not have the fonts needed to print your design as you created it.\n\nWhite Stickers\n\nIf you are ordering a sticker where the only color in the design is white, you can choose from a white transfer sticker or a clear vinyl sticker with the design printed in white. Transfer stickers have the design cut out of a piece of white vinyl and then have the background elements removed. Clear vinyl stickers have the design printed in an opaque, white ink and can either be die cut around the shape of your design or cut to a standard shape, such as a circle, square, or oval.\n\n**In some cases, where a transfer sticker is too small to cut, we may recommend changing to a sticker printed on clear vinyl.\n\nCut Paths On Sticker Sheets\n\nWhile ordering a sticker sheet, cut paths are signified by a 1 pt. stroke around your artwork. The stroke must be a spot color with the name “CutContour.\" For detailed instructions on how to add cut paths to your artwork in Adobe Illustrator, please view this short tutorial video.\n\nIf you would like a sticker sheet, but don’t want to worry about setting up your own cut paths, simply select the “I need cut paths” option.\n\nSubmitting Transfer Sticker Artwork As A Black Image\n\nWe often receive white artwork on a black background from customers who want to purchase a white transfer sticker. Please submit your artwork as a black image on a white background. Once you upload your file you will be able to select the color of your sticker.\n\nTransfer Sticker File Types\n\nPreferred Files Not Preferred Files Do Not Submit .EPS .JPG MS Office Files .AI .JPEG .PDF .PSD .TIF .PNG .CDR\n\nYou can check your file type by looking at the extension at the end of your file name. Example: transfer_sticker_file.eps\n\nPrinted Sticker File Types\n\nPreferred Files Not Preferred Files Do Not Submit .EPS .TIF MS Office Files .AI .CDR .PDF .JPG .JPEG .PNG .PSD\n\nAnswer:\n\nLamination is a type of manufacturing that adds a layer of material in order to improve the durability, strength, and appearance of a sticker. We use lamination to permanently add a protective layer of material. Lamination is an extra layer applied to the top of printed stickers that is scratch and acid-rain resistant and will increase the lifespan of your sticker by 1-3 years. It offers a high level of UV protection and protects the sticker from moisture and abrasion. Lamination will also alter the finish of the sticker, making it either glossy or matte in appearance. Lamination is FREE!\n\nSticker Layers:\n\nProtective Laminate Layer\n\nHigh-Resolution Digital Print\n\nSuperior Sticker Material\n\nWhy We Provide Free Lamination for All Stickers\n\nFor years here at Carstickers we charged extra for lamination because it was such an added value for our product. However, we have recently decided to laminate every sticker free of charge! We’re so excited to provide this extra value to all of our customers because we know how important lamination is to the durability and visibility of our products. Just choose between matte and gloss lamination, and your beautiful stickers will be shipped to your door all free of any additional fees.\n\nWhy We Laminate Stickers:\n\nResists Scratching and Abrasion\n\nWeather and Water Resistant\n\nUV Protection\n\nChoice Between Matte or Gloss\n\nImproved Durability\n\nMatte Lamination\n\nMatte lamination gives a beautifully subtle, flat effect that looks great on any stickers. The lamination forms a protective coating over the print that improves durability, UV protections, and weather proofing. Matte laminated stickers are great for a sleek look that doesn’t reflect light.\n\nGloss Lamination\n\nGloss lamination adds a high profile sheen that is often used on brochures, menus, magazine covers or presentation folders. Gloss lamination is a high impact option which forms a protective coating over the sticker which makes a wonderful shiny feel.\n\nAnswer:\n\nAt Carstickers.com, we measure and price all our stickers based on square inches. The easiest way to figure out the square inches of a sticker is to multiply the width by the height. For example, a sticker that is 4”W x 4”H (4 inches wide and 4 inches high), and a sticker that is 2”W x 8”H (2 inches wide and 8 inches high), will cost the same because they are both 16 square inches.\n\nThese measurements are based on the widest and tallest areas of the sticker's shape when a straight line is measured from left to right and top to bottom.\n\nPlease note: The measurements are taken when the design is upright and in the same position as it will be applied. This ensures the sticker you order will fit in the space intended. In theory, a diamond-shaped sticker could be rotated 45 degrees and measured as a square, but a 3”x3” diamond and a 3”x3” square rotated 45 degrees are not the same size and will not fit in the same space."
