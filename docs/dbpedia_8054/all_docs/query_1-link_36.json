        "text": "Eleven University of Scranton Students participated in a study abroad program in South Korea that provided an in-depth exploration of the criminal justice systems in both South Korea and the United States and allowed the students to compete with international teams in a cybercrime investigation challenge.\n\nThrough the course led by professors in the University’s Department of Criminal Justice, Cybersecurity and Sociology Michael Jenkins, Ph.D., and Sinchul Back, Ph.D., who previously served as a captain in the South Korean Marine Corps, the students visited several key institutions to gain a comprehensive understanding of South Korea’s criminal justice and national security systems. Students visited the Blue House (South Korea’s presidential residence akin to the White House), Gyeongbokgung Palace, the Demilitarized Zone at a Republic of Korea Marine base camp, the Korean National Police Agency, Korean National Police University, Korean Supreme Prosecution Office and the Korean Defense Counterintelligence Agency.\n\nHighlighting their trip, the students participated as a cybercrime investigation team in the 2024 International White Hat Conference, hosted by Boston University. The conference, themed “AI and Robotics Frontier: Mastering Cybercrime Defense in the Digital Age,” focused on advanced applications of AI and robotics in cybersecurity and cybercrime defense. Scranton teams excelled in the cybercrime investigation capture-the-flag (CTF) challenge, securing fifth, sixth, and eighth places among the international teams participating, including many teams of professionals currently working in the field of cybercrime investigation and cybersecurity.\n\nIn addition, four Scranton students were invited to present their research and projects related to cybercrime investigation at the student poster session of the conference that provided a platform to engage with experts and showcase their work, as well as a way to learn about the latest developments in cybersecurity. Dr. Back was the faculty co-author on the research studies presented.\n\nUniversity students who participated in a study abroad program in South Korea were:\n\nJustin K. Bauer, a criminal justice major from Staten Island, New York, and member of the University’s class of 2025;\n\nJacob Haley, a cybercrime and homeland security major from Pembroke, Massachusetts, and member of the University’s class of 2026;\n\nAnthony M. Knof, a criminal justice major from Pompton Plains, New Jersey, and member of the University’s class of 2026;\n\nJohn F. Mahoney, a criminal justice major from Rockaway Point, New York, and member of the University’s class of 2026;\n\nVictor A. Romanek, a criminal justice major from Hampton, New Jersey, and member of the University’s class of 2025, who also presented his study titled “Cyber Bullying and Offender age” at the student poster session of the 2024 International White Hat Conference;\n\nBrigida M. Sarcona, a criminal justice major from Staten Island, New York, and member of the University’s class of 2026, who also presented her research titled “Exploring Criminal Offender Age and Motivation in Cyberstalking: An Application of Cyber-Situational Crime Prevention Theory” at the student poster session of the 2024 International White Hat Conference;\n\nJessica M. Sommo, a cybercrime and homeland security major from Commack, New York, and member of the University’s class of 2026;\n\nAdam J. Steidle, a history major from Stewartsville, New Jersey, and member of the University’s class of 2026;\n\nColin A. Straub, a cybercrime and homeland security major from Royersford, and member of the University’s class of 2025, who also presented his study titled “DDoS Attacks: Motivation and Accomplices” at the student poster session of the 2024 International White Hat Conference;\n\nChristopher G. Villa, a biology major from Abington in his senior year at Scranton, who also presented his research titled “Exploring Criminal Offender Age and Geographical Location” at the student poster session of the 2024 International White Hat Conference;\n\nFinnbarr D. Whittaker, a cybercrime and homeland security major from Scranton, and member of the University’s class of 2027.\n\nTwo University students also attended the 2024 International White Hat Conference. They participated in a similar study abroad course to South Korea in 2022. The students attending the conference were:\n\nAndrew P. Cupo, a cybercrime and homeland security and criminal justice double major from West Orange, New Jersey, and member of Scranton’s class of 2025; and Bradley W. Rausch, a cybercrime and homeland security major from Byram Township, New Jersey, who graduated from the University in May of 2024.\n\nThe University began offering a bachelor’s degree in cybercrime and homeland security in the fall of 2020 and master’s degree in cybercrime investigation and cybersecurity in a fully online format in the fall of 2022."
