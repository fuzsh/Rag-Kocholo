        "text": "Many Koreans associate the flag with a long list of war crimes committed by Japan during its 1910-45 colonial rule – and see it as a sign that Tokyo will never properly and earnestly address its past.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Defence Ministry spokesman Jeon Ha-kyu said the ministry would not take issue with the flag this time, noting that hoisting of identifying flags while entering a foreign port was a “common international practice.”\n\nTokyo has maintained that its warships are legally required to raise the Rising Sun flag along with its national flag and, under the international maritime treaty, it is recognised as a mark to show their nationality.\n\nSeven warships and six planes will be mobilised for the planned exercise, which includes testing systems for the dissemination of information about vessels suspected of carrying WMDs.\n\nA Seoul official said the exercise does not target any particular nation. Pyongyang is, however, among the most serious threats given its high WMD proliferation risk.\n\nThe PSI, launched by Washington under former President George W. Bush in 2003, aims to stop the trafficking of WMDs, their delivery systems and related materials. The initiative has since grown to include the endorsement of more than 100 countries.\n\nThe PSI holds a high-level political meeting every five years to review and set guidelines. The Busan forum is the first one to be held in Asia."
