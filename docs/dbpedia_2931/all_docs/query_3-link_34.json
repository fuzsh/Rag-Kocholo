        "text": "The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is bringing fans back to Middle-earth with a new animated adventure.\n\nIn June 2024, the movie unveiled a first look at the characters, including the ancient king of Rohan, Helm Hammerhand (voiced by Succession star Brian Cox), and his daughter Héra (voiced by Gaia Wise).\n\nAfter being pushed back a few months due to the now-finished actors' strike, the movie is now set to be released this December.\n\nAnd it sounds like The War of the Rohirrim will be worth the wait – an exclusive 20-min footage reel was shown at the 2024 Annecy Film Festival, and the reactions were very positive.\n\nWhile we wait for Rings of Power season two on Prime Video and with a new Lord of the Rings movie already in the works, here's everything you need to know about The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim was delayed from its original release date and will now hit cinemas on December 13, 2024.\n\nThat's a move of eight months from its original release date of April 12, 2024. No further delays are expected.\n\nThe War of the Rohirrim was announced in June 2021, and it won't be the end for big-screen Lord of the Rings movies. It was confirmed in February 2023 that Warner Bros is developing new movies after signing a deal with Middle-earth Enterprises.\n\nWar of the Rohirrim cast: Who will be in Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim?\n\nMuch of the voice cast has been confirmed, with an exciting return from The Lord of the Rings OG trilogy star Miranda Otto. She will reprise her role as Éowyn, who will serve as the narrator of the film.\n\nBrian Cox (Succession) will lend his distinctive voice to Helm Hammerhand, the King of Rohan.\n\nRelated: All Lord of the Rings movies in order and how to watch them\n\nJoining them are Gaia Wise as Hera, the daughter of Helm, who helps defend their people, Shadow and Bone's Luke Pasqualino as Wulf, the ruthless leader of the Dunlendings who seeks revenge against Rohan for the death of his father Freca (who will be voiced by Shaun Dooley), plus Laurence Ubong Williams as Fréaláf Hildeson, Helm's nephew and successor to the throne of Rohan.\n\nLorraine Ashbourne, Yazdan Qafouri, Benjamin Wainwright, Michael Wildman, Jude Akuwudike, Bilal Hasna, and Janine Duvitski have been cast in undisclosed voice roles too.\n\nBehind the scenes, the movie is being directed by Kenji Kamiyama. Oscar-winner Philippa Boyens, who was part of the original screenwriting team of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, will be executive producing alongside producer Joseph Chou.\n\nAlso returning for the project will be The Lord of the Rings alums from its creative team, Oscar winner Richard Taylor and Tolkien illustrator John Howe.\n\nThe screenplay will be based on a script by Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews and will be set around 250 years before the events of the original movie, which is dubbed as the third age, while the new show is set to take place during the second age.\n\nWar of the Rohirrim plot: What will Lord of the Rings The War of the Rohirrim be about?\n\nThe movie is set to explore the as-yet-untold story of the Helm's Deep fortress, following the life of the legendary King of Rohan Helm Hammerhand.\n\nIt's set nearly 200 years before The Two Towers and tells the tale of a character introduced in the appendix of JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\n\nHelm and his people are forced to make a brave last stand in the fortress of Hornburg (later known as Helm's Deep) after ruthless Dunlending Lord Wulf, hellbent on vengeance over his father's death, launches a surprise attack.\n\nLeading the resistance against Wulf is Helm's daughter Hera.\n\nWe don't have a trailer for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim yet, but, with the release next December, it's only a matter of time.\n\nThe prestigious Annecy Film Festival screened 20 minutes of the movie in June 2024, and the reactions have been quite promising. Unfortunately, that footage is not available to watch."
