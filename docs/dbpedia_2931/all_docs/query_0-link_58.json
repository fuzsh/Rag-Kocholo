        "text": "What are all PS Plus games? Sony's PS5 and PS4 subscription service, PlayStation Plus, is jam-packed with hundreds of games available to members. On this page, we're going to tell you everything you need to know about PS Plus, including a full list of all PS Plus games across all three tiers: PS Plus Essential, PS Plus Extra, and PS Plus Premium. In addition, we'll tell you what each subscription offers and which games are joining or leaving the service.\n\nPS Plus Essential\n\nPS Plus Essential, the most basic tier of PS Plus, guarantees users at least two games for PS5 and PS4 per month. These games are made available for one month only, and must be added to your Game Library during that period. Once they're part of your Game Library, you'll be able to download and play them at any time, as long as you maintain an active membership.\n\nAll PS Plus Essential Games Available Now\n\nThe following 3 PS Plus Essential games are available now to PS Plus Essential, PS Plus Extra, and PS Plus Premium members:\n\nEnder Lilies: Quietus of the Knights PS4 Available until 2nd Sep 2024\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach PS4 PS5 Available until 2nd Sep 2024\n\nLEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga PS4 PS5 Available until 2nd Sep 2024\n\nPS Plus Extra\n\nPS Plus Extra is the second tier of PS Plus. It includes all of the perks and benefits from PS Plus Essential as well as a huge catalogue of PS5 and PS4 games that can be downloaded and played at any time, as long as you remain subscribed.\n\nAll PS Plus Extra Games List\n\nThe following PS Plus Extra games are available to PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium members. There are currently 630 games available with PS Plus Extra:\n\nPS Plus Premium\n\nPS Plus Premium is the third tier of PS Plus. It includes all of the perks and benefits from PS Plus Essential and PS Plus Extra in addition to a catalogue of PSP, PS2, and PS1 games which can be downloaded and played, so long as you have an active subscription. In select territories, all PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium games can be cloud streamed as well, including a wide range of PS3 games. Please note that PS3 games cannot be downloaded, they can only be played via streaming.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that in countries where cloud streaming is not available, a cheaper version of the PS Plus Premium tier is available called PS Plus Deluxe, which excludes all PS3 games. It's identical in all other ways, however.\n\nAll PS Plus Premium Games List\n\nThe following PS Plus Premium games are available to PS Plus Premium members only. There are currently 467 games available with PS Plus Premium:\n\nAll PS Plus Premium Time Limited Trials\n\nPS Plus Premium (or PS Plus Deluxe) also provides access to Time Limited Trials as an additional perk. These games can be downloaded in their entirety and played for a set number of hours, with any progress you make transferring to the full game should you decide to purchase it.\n\nThe following games currently have Time Limited Trials for PS Plus Premium members only:\n\nGame Platform Trial Length AFL 23 PS5, PS4 1 hour Age of Wonders 4 PS5 3 hours AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative PS4 1 hour Alan Wake 2 PS5 3 hours A Plague Tale: Requiem PS5 2 hours As Dusk Falls PS5, PS4 1 hour A Space for the Unbound PS5 1 hour Asterigos: Curse of the Stars PS5, PS4 2 hours Balatro PS5 1 hour Baldur's Gate 3 PS5 2 hours BIT.TRIP Rerunner PS5 45 minutes Bonfire Peaks PS5, PS4 1 hour Broken Edge PSVR2 30 minutes Carrion PS5, PS4 1 hour CATAN: Console Edition PS5, PS4 1 hou Cobra Kai 2: Dojos Rising PS5, PS4 2 hours Company of Heroes 3 PS5 2 hours Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion PS5, PS4 2 hours Cult of the Lamb PS5, PS4 1 hour Custom Mech Wars PS5 2 hours Cyberpunk 2077 PS5, PS4 5 hours CyberTD PS5, PS4 2 hours Dakar Desert Rally PS5, PS4 2 hours DC's Justice League: Cosmic Chaos PS5, PS4 30 minutes Dead Island 2 PS5, PS4 2 hours Death's Door PS5, PS4 1 hour DE-EXIT: Eternal Matters PS5, PS4 1 hour Demeo PS5, PSVR2 1 hour DNF Duel PS5, PS4 2 hours Dusk Diver 2 PS5 2 hours Dying Light 2 PS5, PS4 3 hours Ed-0: Zombie Uprising PS5 3 hours Elemental War 2 PS5, PS4 2 hours Eternights PS5, PS4 1 hour Everspace 2 PS5 2 hours Evil West PS5, PS4 2 hours Exoprimal PS5, PS4 30 minutes F1 Manager 2023 PS5, PS4 3 hours Fort Solis PS5 1 hour Galaxy Kart PSVR2 30 minutes Gangs of Sherwood PS5 2 hours Ghost Signal: A Stellaris Game PSVR2 30 minutes God of War Ragnarok PS5, PS4 3 hours GORN PSVR2, PSVR 1 hour Greyhill Incident PS5 30 minutes GRIS PS5, PS4 1 hour Hellboy Web of Wyrd PS5 2 hours Hogwarts Legacy PS5, PS4 45 minutes Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged PS5, PS4 2 hours Hunting Simulator 2 PS5 2 hours Jumanji: Wild Adventures PS5, PS4 30 minutes KarmaZoo PS5 2 hours Legendary Tales PSVR2 2 hours LEGO 2K Drive PS5, PS4 2 hours LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga PS5, PS4 1 hour Little League World Series Baseball 2022 PS5, PS4 2 hours MADiSON PS5, PS4 1 hour Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PS5 2 hours Matchpoint PS5, PS4 2 hours Miraculous: Rise of the Sphinx PS5, PS4 2 hours MLB The Show 24 PS5, PS4 2 hours Monster Hunter Stories PS4 3 hours Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin PS4 3 hours Mortal Kombat 1 PS5 2 hours Moss PSVR2 30 minutes Moss: Book II PSVR2, PSVR 30 minutes Mr. Run and Jump PS5 30 minutes My Friend Pedro PS4 1 hour NHRA Championship Drag Racing: Speed for All PS5, PS4 2 hours Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway PS5, PS4 2 hours Park Beyond PS5 2 hours Persha and the Magic Labyrinth -Arabian Nyaights- PS5 1 hour Persona 3 Reload PS5, PS4 3 hours Persona 5 Tactica PS5, PS4 2 hours PGA Tour 2K23 PS5 2 hours Phoenix Point PS5, PS4 2 hours Pixel Ripped 1978 PSVR2 1 hour Relayer PS5, PS4 2 hours Return to Monkey Island PS5 1 hour RIDE 5 PS5 2 hours RiMS Racing PS5 2 hours RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures Deluxe PS5 1 hour Rollerdrome PS5, PS4 30 minutes Ruinarch PS5, PS4 1 hour Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew PS5 2 hours Shadow Warrior 3 PS5, PS4 1 hour Sonic Frontiers PS5, PS4 1 hour Sonic Superstars PS5, PS4 1 hour SpiderHeck PS5, PS4 1 hour Steelrising PS5 2 hours Stellar Blade PS5 2 hours Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty PS5, PS4 2 hours Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League PS5 3 hours Super Crazy Rhythm Castle PS5 2 hours Tactics Ogre: Reborn PS5, PS4 2 hours Terraformers PS5, PS4 2 hours The Callisto Protocol PS5, PS4 1 hour The Cruel King and the Great Hero PS4 2 hours The Last of Us: Part I PS5 2 hours The Last of Us: Part II Remastered PS5 2 hours The Lord of the Rings: Gollum PS5, PS4 1 hour The Messenger PS4 1 hour The Talos Principle 2 PS5 2 hours The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition PS5, PS4 4 hours TopSpin 2K25 PS5, PS4 2 hours Townsmen VR PS5 1 hour Train Sim World 4 PS5, PS4 2 hours Transformers: EarthSpark Expedition PS5, PS4 30 minutes Trek to Yomi PS5, PS4 1 hour Tri6: Infinite PS5, PS4 30 minutes TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 PS5, PS4 1 hour Ultros PS5, PS4 1 hour Unrailed PS4 2 hours Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice PSVR2 30 minutes VR Skater PSVR2 1.5 hours Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realms of Ruin PS5 2 hours Weedcraft Inc PS5, PS4 1 hour Weird West PS5, PS4 2 hours Wizard with a Gun PS5 2 hours World of Outlaws: Dirt Racing PS5, PS4 2 hours WWE 2K24 PS5 2 hours\n\nUpcoming Additions\n\nNew PS Plus games are added every month.
