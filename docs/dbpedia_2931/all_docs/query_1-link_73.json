        "text": "The best Lord of the Rings games cover a lot of ground. In this ranking, you'll find some of the best action games, best survival games, best strategy games based on Tolkien's universe. Whether you're a fan of the novels or were drawn in by Peter Jackson's film adaptation, there's a LOTR game experience that'll be perfect for you right here - no matter your platform of choice.\n\nFrom retreading the footsteps of the Fellowship to exploring an uncharted part of Middle-earth's history, the best Lord of the Rings games cover a lot of bases. You won't see anything directly based on Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power TV series, but there's plenty more to explore. Some of these titles are available on Xbox Game Pass, while some PS2-exclusive gems might only be accessible if you're lucky enough to still own your old console. Either way, we've got you covered. Check out the best Lord of the Rings games below and experience Middle Earth hands-on.\n\n10. The Lord of the Rings: Conquest\n\nDeveloper: Pandemic Studios\n\nPublisher: EA\n\nReleased: 2009\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Conquest is a mixed bag. A class-based action game from the minds behind Star Wars: Battlefront, Conquest was rightly criticized for its lacklustre animations and underwhelming narrative. But it was easy to overlook its flaws when you brought another player along for the warg ride. Whether you were playing with a group online or with a friend in local co-op, it was always fun to take on the supporting role of a mage, dispelling arrows away from the main attacking force, or get into the thick of it as Aragorn or Legolas. While Conquest ultimately suffered from the same simplistic combat rhythms as Star Wars: Battlefront before it, there was a lot of fun to be had jumping into the middle of some of the film trilogy's biggest setpieces.\n\n9. The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age\n\nDeveloper: EA Redwood Shores\n\nPublisher: EA\n\nReleased: 2004\n\nA turn-based Lord of the Rings RPG developed in the vein of Final Fantasy and Tales franchises? Sign me up. While The Third Age does run in parallel to the film trilogy, your party only shows up for certain key moments. Gandalf guides you with collectible film clips that feature original narration from the voice actor himself. Pursuing the Fellowship and fighting alongside them across the film's battles is a nostalgia trip worth taking for any Tolkien fan. The Third Age offers up a different perspective on The Lord of the Rings, and found success with an interesting approach to combat design and overworld exploration.\n\n8. The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria\n\nDeveloper: Free Range Games\n\nPublisher: North Beach Games\n\nReleased: 2023\n\nInnovative, true to its source material, and just plain fun, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is one of the best LOTR games in recent years. After all, who better to lead a Lord of the Rings-style Minecraft survival crafting game than an intrepid dwarf? Off the back of Daedalic's unfortunate Lord of the Rings: Gollum earlier in the year, Return to Moria is a welcome example of a LOTR game done right. Being a live service title, it shines in multiplayer mode. The aim of the game is to team up with fellow dwarves and follow in the steps of the Fellowship, now in the fourth age of Middle Earth following the events of Peter Jackson's film trilogy. Whether you're going it alone with a friend, excavating the mines to reclaim Khazad-dûm from the orcs and goblins who lurk there is no simple task. Managing your light and noise is essential unless you want to draw attention to yourself, so expect a fair amount of melee combat on top of gathering, crafting, and puzzle solving in these procedurally-generated halls.\n\n7. LEGO The Lord of the Rings\n\nDeveloper: Traveller's Tales\n\nPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\n\nReleased: 2012\n\nPlaying through locations revamped to the tune of LEGO bricks is one thing. But featuring dialogue straight out of the movies elevates this simple LEGO title into a nostalgia-fueled romp through Middle-earth. Meet all the characters you've come to love and see them through the cartoonish lens that LEGO has to offer. With scenes and scenarios drawn from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy – each of which is imbued with Traveller's Tales sharp comedic instincts and timings, a staple of the LEGO games – LEGO Lord of the Rings features an incredible amount of content to get lost in, and is a must-play for LotR fans of all-ages.\n\nCheck our pick of the best LEGO games of all-time\n\n6. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\nDeveloper: Stormfront Studios\n\nPublisher: EA\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers brought us closer to Middle-earth than any game before it. With its blurring of lines between FMV footage pulled from the Peter Jackson films, fun hack-and-slash action, and recreation of some of LotR's most iconic battles, The Two Towers was a satisfying licensed game that ran a little on the short side. Still, there was nothing quite like it at the time, and roaming through Middle-earth while utilizing God of War-esque special attacks to destroy hordes of Orcs and Uruk Hai was a riot. There was room for improvement, but it was a solid first effort.\n\n5. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nDeveloper: EA Redwood Shores\n\nPublisher: EA\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King built on the foundations that Stormfront Studios put down with The Two Towers. With a longer campaign, updated graphics, and new fan-favorite playable characters like Gandalf, The Return of the King handily outdid the action-packed gameplay of its predecessor. Released before the actual film, The Return of the King also featured unreleased footage from its namesake which was a welcome bonus for franchise fans desperate for more. Add co-op gameplay into the mix and you can see why The Return of the King is a compelling trip down Tolkien lane that's still beloved to this day.\n\n4. The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-earth 2\n\nDeveloper: EA Los Angeles\n\nPublisher: EA\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nArguably one of the best RTS games of the early '00s, The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-earth 2 took the scale of and spectacle of The Lord of the Rings and put us in command of the action. Whether you were playing through the Good or Evil story campaigns or jumping online to recreate some of the franchises' biggest battles with your friends, The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-earth 2 (and its The Rise of the Witch-King expansion) was a compelling, polished strategy game with no shortage of depth and detail. Despite its legacy, The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-earth 2 had its online servers shut down in 2011, and is sadly no longer sold digitally.\n\n3. The Lord of the Rings Online\n\nDeveloper: In-house\n\nPublisher: Standing Stone Games\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nWith a wide variety of races and breathtaking locations, Middle-earth is a great place for an MMORPG. With dozens of games out there using dwarves and elves to prop their stories, it's only fair that Lord of the Rings got the same MMO treatment. Launched in 2007, Lord of the Rings Online has undergone several reworks and updates. Explore iconic locations like the Shire, Gondor, Gundabad, and Mordor across the MMORPG's many expansions. LoTRO even lets you switch to Sauron's side and take charge of powerful monsters to terrorize the Free Peoples. A thriving community paired with a breathing, living world makes for a plethora of possibilities. The Lord of the Rings Online is free-to-play, and the most recent expansion released in 2021 – and it remains one of the best MMORPGs out there today.\n\n2. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor\n\nDeveloper: Monolith Productions\n\nPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\n\nReleased: 2014\n\nMonolith's first stab at recreating Middle-earth was a breakout hit, and one of the best adventure games around. Featuring an original story set before the events of the films, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor gets a lot right. While its open world wasn't the most varied, Shadow of Mordor made up for any shortcomings in that respect with a progressive approach to interactive storytelling. For as great as the action-adventure combat and tightly woven narrative were, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is remembered because of its Nemesis system – allowing you to participate in, and shape, Orc power dynamics. Forming personal vendettas with procedurally-generated Uruk warriors was a true delight, and truly unique.\n\n1. Middle-earth: Shadow of War\n\nDeveloper: Monolith Productions\n\nPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\n\nReleased: 2017\n\nIf Shadow of Mordor was an ambitious step forward, Middle-earth: Shadow of War was a great leap. Monolith shed the grim aesthetic of its predecessor, and delivered one of the best open world games of the generation in this sequel – expanding upon everything, including the intricate lore of its world and protagonist Talion. In Shadow of War, the Nemesis System evolves into a genre-defining webbing of inter-connected Orcs. Orcs even remember how you fought against them, adapting to your playstyle while leveling up alongside you. It's an impressive feat that comes to life during the game's massive castle sieges, culminating in intense boss fights that can be approached in any way you choose. Sure, the drama the Nemesis system creates isn't canon, but Shadow of War is an excellent flagbearer of the Lord of the Rings franchise on its own terms."
