The game came out before the movie, and obviously an extremely anticipated one at the time. I personally never played movie games watching before the movie.\n\nAlric\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n2,022\n\nSep 19, 2021\n\n#2\n\nI did, same with the Star Wars Prequels.\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#3\n\nYes.

I reviewed the game and the only thing I regretted was seeing some of the cool visual ideas Peter Jackson's team came up with on a small tv first.\n\nAriakon44\n\nProphet of Truth\n\nNov 17, 2020\n\n10,713\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#6\n\nI don't remember if I played this one before the movies, but I played Lego Star Wars before Revenge of the Sith and saw how Padme died in Lego form.\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#7\n\nI did. As this was before the Extended Editions were a thing the Two Tower and Return of the King had scenes that were not seen in the movies yet. So I thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThereAreFourNaan\n\nNov 8, 2017\n\n13,742\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#8\n\nYep. Walked half an hour to the store and back on foot because my parents were busy on the day it came out (can't remember if it was a weekend or just school holidays). Saves my money for a while to get it.\n\nDoodlebug\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n386\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#9\n\nYes!!

So I got to see the movie first then the game. Regardless, it was extremely enjoyable.\n\nSmoolio\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,237\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#11\n\nHow can one play this these days, I remember loving it.

He really loved that game. This was when probably the spring time or something. But yeah I heard those games were super enjoyable.\n\nCamberGreber\n\nDec 27, 2019\n\n1,606\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#14\n\nMy favorite coop game of all time and the best 3d representation of golden axe made.\n\nBeing able to block at all times even in middle of combo was such an amazing addition.\n\nI would kill for a spirital sequel which leaned into the conan the barbarian universe artisticly.\n\nKinketsu\n\nNov 17, 2017\n\n2,040\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#15\n\nI definitely did because I didnt care much for Lord of the Rings. Two of my friends were really into it and forced me to see the first one at a late night preview but by the time the third one came around, one of them had already seen it because he was a mega fan and the other had actually passed away so I dont think I saw the movie for ages but I rented the game sharpish because I quite enjoyed Two Towers.\n\nHK-47\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n5,756\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#16\n\nSomeone remaster this shit and put it on Steam so I can pretend to be a child again.\n\nKarateka\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n6,940\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#17\n\nThe way is shut and the dead keep it the way is shut.\n\ndoyneamite\n\nOct 26, 2018\n\n705\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#18\n\nPlayed this game in co-op countless times. I wish there were more Lord of the Rings games.\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#19\n\nLoved this game. I remember me and my sister would play that minas tirith gate level for so long the game stopped spawning enemies.\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#20\n\nNo. Had a lot of fun playing with my brother though.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\njukeboxhero2396\n\nDec 25, 2018\n\n3,194\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#21\n\nIt's pretty interesting to see that quite a few people did. I remember when the Toy Story 3 game came out I got it after watching the movie. Must have been insane to see scenes of the new movie month and a half before the film was out.\n\nAtom\n\nJul 25, 2021\n\n12,783\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#22\n\nThis and two towers are just both really fun couch coop games. Played both of them with a friend a few years back without having any nostalgia for the original release and had a blast. So I guess technically I played it after.\n\nAlso the Hobbit video game that more closely followed the book was a really good action adventure title that I wish could get a GOG release.\n\njrcaretaker\n\nNov 11, 2020\n\n34\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#23\n\nLoved this game. I remember me and my sister would play that minas tirith gate level for so long the game stopped spawning enemies.\n\nSame. Also the beginning of the Helm's Deep level and the Rohan soldiers would cheer afterward.\n\nTerbinator\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n11,102\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#24\n\nYup, and the game has the Mouth of Sauron in it which the cinema release didn't, IIRC?\n\nNealMcCauley\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n6,572\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#25\n\nYeah it was fun to play and compare with the movie after finally seeing it. Jackson changed the Witch King's armor in reshoots because it looked too much like Sauron's, but the game shows his original look.\n\nSabercrusader\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n2,255\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#26\n\nI did not, didn't watch the movies on release myself until a bit later.\n\nThat said, the game was great.\n\nKyrios\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n15,818\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#27\n\nYup lol\n\nGod that game is so good.

Top tier stuff.\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#31\n\nThis had online co op right? I remember two towers was only single player.\n\nBoth games were amazing.\n\nHiLife\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n41,385\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#32\n\nTwo Towers and RotK are film based games that are held in the same regard as Goldeneye, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nStill the best lord of the rings video games.\n\nOuttrigger888\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n2,368\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#33\n\nI just bought two towers and return of the king for 10$ at a pawn shop for ps2.

And if I remember correctly, I also read the Dark Horse comic book adaptation before the movie, that was basically a story board for the entire movie, scene by scene.\n\nROTK and Two Towers are amazing games, specially Return of the King, really fun in co-op.\n\nThe GBA games were really good too, but different in style. They were more Diablo-like.\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#36\n\nThe Two Towers/RotK/Third Age/etc. games all look really awesome from what I've seen from LPs/streams. I wish I had picked them up way back when.\n\nUnfortunately it's extremely unlikely any of them will ever get ports or remasters since they're all EA games and they lost the LotR license a long time ago.\n\nGoldenroad\n\nAttempted to circumvent ban with alt account\n\nNov 2, 2017\n\n9,475\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#37\n\nNo. That was my college phase where I was really not into video games at all. I'm a huge LOTR fan, but I missed that whole era of LOTR games. Really the only LOTR games I've ever played are the SNES one and the Middle Earth (Shadow of Mordor/War).\n\nLegacy\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n15,704\n\nTransistor\n\nsudo rm -rf /\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n38,254\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#39\n\nI didn't for Return of the King, but I did for The Two Towers\n\nMr. Poolman\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n7,364\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#40\n\nThis game was insanely hard towards the end.\n\nI recall Gollum's final fight took me like 40 tries to beat him.\n\nDaingurse\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,874\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#41\n\nI did.

But a couple months later my dad shows up with a new graphics card for our computer.\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#44\n\nHow do people remember shit from ~20 years ago? Fuck if I know. Great game series though.\n\nBold One\n\nOct 30, 2017\n\n18,911\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#45\n\nI am far too young to have done this 👀\n\nJ_ToSaveTheDay\n\n\"This guy are sick\" and Corrupted by Vengeance\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n19,781\n\nUSA\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#46\n\nNo. I was in high school when the LOTR movies were making their theater debuts, and they all came out right around the time my friends and I finished finals. There was a pretty cheap movie theater within a mile of our high school, so we made it tradition each year to finish finals and go catch a screening of LOTR together -- Freshmen, Sophomore, and Junior years.\n\nI got Two Towers and Return of the King games as Christmas gifts about a week after that, not right at release.\n\nThey were fun as heck to coop with my brother (who also went to the LOTR movie screenings with my friends and I).\n\ntrashbandit\n\nDec 19, 2019\n\n3,915\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#47\n\nI don't remember, but I did play the shit out of that game. It's definitely one of the best movie tie in games.\n\nHockeyBird\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n13,025\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#48\n\nI did. Same thing with Star Wars Revenge of the Sith. I would also spoil myself in games by reading the strategy guide. I feel like it was only till I was 16 or 17 did I really start caring about people spoiled by something.\n\nSuperOctopus\n\nApr 22, 2020\n\n2,905\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#49\n\nThe EA Lord of the rings games at that time were so good. If I remember right, I think I played the game after seeing the movie but I'm not entirely sure."
