        "text": "With so many captivating universes fighting for attention, joining an MMO can require a significant commitment. To help you navigate the vast selection, we’ve compiled an essential list of the best MMOs for 2024 onwards.\n\nAs games go, MMOs can be overwhelming if you’re new to the genre. So, if you’re wondering exactly where to start, we’ve got a rundown of the best MMOs currently available.\n\nWhether you’re drawn to Final Fantasy XIV‘s epic scope or Runescape‘s classic charm, this list should have something for everyone.\n\nWithout further ado, here are 30 of the best free-to-play and paid-for-subscription MMOs you should check out in 2024.\n\n1. World of Warcraft\n\nWhat is it: The most famous MMO in history, World of Warcraft’s reputation as a titan of the genre is well earned, despite some difficult periods in recent expansions.\n\nWhat we think: Perhaps one of the most well-known MMORPGs on this list, World of Warcraft has been a household name since 2004. Today, it continues to attract fans from all over the world, featuring some of the most iconic characters in gaming, from Alexstrasza to Khadgar and Tyrande Whisperwind. Players are transported to a world of high fantasy to experience the nine-total expansions as they partake in epic dungeons and stories, raids, open-world PvP, duels, and battlegrounds.\n\nWoW’s class designs are arguably some of the best in gaming, with each having different specializations to focus on that completely change the gameplay of its many classes. It definitely leans towards catering to players who have lots of free time to grind through its mindboggling amount of currencies, reputations, and other requirements, but casual players will still have a blast exploring the world and uncovering the mysteries of Azeroth and the worlds beyond.\n\nThough the game suffered during Shadowlands, the most recent expansion, Dragonflight, brought renewed hope. The War Within has been confirmed for release on August 26 and it looks set to usher in a new era of prosperity and positivity for WoW plays. Couple that in with the time-limited events Blizzard are currently running and there has likely never been a better time to jump into the game.\n\n2. Final Fantasy XIV\n\nWhat is it: Square Enix’s attempt to bring the Final Fantasy universe to the MMORPG genre, it is a sprawling and impressive narrative-driven effort from the developer.\n\nWhat we think: Arriving to a negative audience response when it was first released in 2010, Final Fantasy XIV (commonly known as FFXIV) was also largely panned by critics. Following a complete shutdown of the game, it resurfaced once more in the summer of 2013 as A Realm Reborn — a complete revamp that struck gold with fans.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV is definitely a story game before an MMORPG. The title has six expansions in total, each of which can take up to 40 hours to complete storywise. That’s not to mention the other content that came along with them, like the new jobs, new zones, dungeons, and trials.\n\nAs an MMO, the game has a pretty heavy emphasis on community. Much of the community is lovely and is more focused on the casual aspects of the game, while there are certainly more hardcore players, much of the game’s content like Island Sanctuary and housing provides a more relaxed experience for players of any skill level.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV just released its Dawntrail expansion in July of 2024. Offering a new story in the wonderful world of Tural, further expanding on the game’s story and lore, introducing two new jobs of Pictomancer and Viper, and providing a solid basis for the devs to continue working on.\n\nOverall if you’re looking for a more laidback, friendly experience when it comes to an MMO, Final Fantasy XIV has the perfect amount of variety for anyone.\n\n3. EVE Online\n\nWhat is it: Set thousands of years ahead of our own time, EVE Online is a sandbox-style MMO where the shape of the world is defined entirely by its community.\n\nWhat we think: As MMOs go, none come close to the depth of simulation offered by EVE Online. It’s centered around exploration, trading, and warfare as you attempt to take your claim in the game’s vast universe. While those looking for an experience where you can explore the world as your character, like many other MMOs, may be disappointed, EVE Online instead has a wealth of features that will send anyone looking for their next sandbox adventure into a tailspin.\n\nIn-game, you step into the shoes of a Capsuleer, an immortal pilot who uses neural technology to navigate their ship throughout space from a capsule within your spacecraft. What’s more, there are plenty (over 350!) to unlock and fully customize, all of which have their own specific uses within the world.\n\nWith over 7,000 solar systems to explore, known collectively as ‘New Eden,’ four empires govern them: the Amarr, the Caldari State, the Gallente Federation, and the Minmatar Republic. Each has its own unique lore and backstory. There are even unexplored areas to venture out into and discover off the beaten path.\n\nDuring your adventure, you can pick from a selection of different careers, all of which change the way that you’ll navigate New Eden: Explorer, Industrialist, Enforcer, and Soldier of Fortune. What’s more, these also branch off into their own professions, with Enforcers being able to become Mission Runners or Bounty Hunters, whereas a Soldier of Fortune can take up arms as either a Pirate or Faction Militia.\n\nThe Equinox expansion has just launched, offering a host of changes, including new structures and a ship customization tool known as the SKINR. With plenty of new resources designed to make onboarding new players much easier, it’s a great time to journey into the darkest reaches of space.\n\n4. The Elder Scrolls Online\n\nWhat is it: The MMO entry in Bethesda’s immensely popular Elder Scrolls series, it takes many elements from the single-player games and thrusts them into a multiplayer setting.\n\nWhat we think: If you’re looking to play one of the most iconic story-driven RPG series with others, look no further than The Elder Scrolls Online. Throughout its lifecycle, developers ZeniMax have opened up more and more corners of the world of Tamriel to explore. At this point, it’s comfortably the biggest Elder Scrolls game ever, allowing players to explore Morrowind, High Isle, Summerset Isle, Elsweyr and other iconic locations.\n\nFeaturing all the bells and whistles one would expect from an Elder Scrolls title, from the Khajiit to an incredibly immersive storyline to uncover alongside the likes of guilds such as The Dark Brotherhood, there’s truly something for everyone here.\n\nUnlike FFXIV and World of Warcraft, ESO’s combat isn’t completely tab-targeting, featuring systems that give you slightly more player agency and control over what you’re doing. Just like the mainline games, you can aim and run around the battlefield with free reign. Hold down the attack button for longer and you’ll perform a heavy attack, or avoid an incoming one from your enemies with a well-timed block.\n\nWith phenomenal player housing opportunities and the ability to bend the game’s classes to your specific preferences (want a warrior that also uses spells? You can do that!) – you can truly craft a character unique to you. With years of expansions to play through, there is little reason not to give ESO a go.\n\n5. Old School RuneScape\n\nWhat is it: A return to an earlier time in RuneScape’s lifespan, with a persistent world and plenty of RPG elements, it is now the most popular version of the game.\n\nWhat we think: Releasing back in 2013 to thunderous applause from the community, Old School Runescape was originally offered as an alternative version of the game for those who wanted to return to an earlier time in its history. In its earliest days, it replicated RuneScape exactly as it was back in 2007. Since then, a ton of new content has been added, largely dictated by the community working in tandem with developer Jagex.\n\nThe game features traditional RPG elements across the board, with skills for players to level up. Combat skills dictate a character’s efficacy while fighting. Gathering skills allow players to collect raw resources and Artisan skills cover production abilities from cooking to smithing.\n\nThe player base is enormous, and few worlds feel as alive and thriving as the one here. Watching people gather in the major city centers to trade, group up and make friends is everything an MMO is supposed to be distilled into its purest form. Though the basic combat and point-and-click input mechanics won’t be for everyone, OSRS is an easy one to recommend.\n\n6. Guild Wars 2\n\nWhat is it: Story-focused and very fast-paced MMO with a dedicated development team that provides regular updates to the game’s expansive content offering.\n\nWhat we think: Though it is known in some quarters as the “other guy” when compared to WoW, Guild Wars 2 is right up there as one of the best MMOs available right now. While those who are looking for the best graphics might be disappointed, Guild Wars’ unique gameplay systems and story put it a cut above many. The game is also incredibly accessible, meaning you’re not punished for coming into the game in 2023 as a new player, or whether you’re returning to it after a break.\n\nCharacter creation gives you different choices that affect both small and larger gameplay elements, from your starting armor to how you’ll experience the core content of the game. Perhaps you were raised as Human nobility, or maybe you blacked out at a celebration as a Norn (yes, that’s actually a choice!).\n\nAside from their expansions, the game also releases new content in the form of Seasons, dubbed ‘Living World’ – these add new quests, storylines, and areas to the game world. Guild Wars 2’s PvP is very approachable, rewarding, and fun to play. World vs World pits you and boatloads of players from your world against opposing ones as you battle it out to claim your stake on castles and keeps in a never-ending loop.\n\n7. World of Warcraft: Classic\n\nWhat is it: A return to the earliest days of World of Warcraft, it offers a nostalgic and heartwarming experience within a thriving community.\n\nWhat we think: Explaining Classic World of Warcraft to those who don’t play is a little tricky these days, as there are multiple different versions to try. The first is known as Classic Era, which is essentially servers permanently locked to the end phase of the game before the release of the first expansion.\n\nBeyond that is Cataclysm Classic, where the servers are currently progressing through the arrival of Deathwing in the game’s third expansion. Lastly there is Season of Discovery, a time-limited experience with new powers, activities and quests, all set within the Vanilla universe.\n\nAll of the above is available for free (as long as you have an active WoW subscription,) and it serves as a wonderful window back into earlier versions of the most important MMO in history. The community is thriving and there is so much to explore, so what are you waiting for?\n\n8. Warframe\n\nWhat is it: Take control of a member of an ancient warrior race and wage war against members of warring factions, all set in a memorable sci-fi universe.\n\nWhat we think: As free-to-play games go, few are as immediately impressive as Warframe. Players step into the shoes of a Tenno, a race of immensely skilled ancient warriors who have awoken from a state of suspended animation far into Earth’s future. The game is set in our own solar system, with our characters quickly finding themselves in direct conflict with the Grineer, Corpus, Sentients, Infested and the Corrupted.\n\nOur encounters with those factions serve as the backdrop to much of the game’s narrative. The continuing story offered via regular content releases is engrossing, to say the least, and Digital Extremes has created a living universe second to none.\n\nCharacter customization comes via the titular Warframes, which grants our character different powers and abilities. This serves as a pseudo-class system that allows players to operate in various roles, whether they want to hang back and fire from range, offer support to team members or lead from the front.\n\nWarframe’s real strength comes from its movement-focused gameplay. The pace of traversal across maps and levels is breakneck, with everything from savage katana-style blades to hyper-powerful gunplay. If you enjoy Destiny 2 but resent its limited public social tools, then Warframe will absolutely appeal.\n\n9. Lord of the Rings Online\n\nWhat is it: The quintessential Middle-earth MMO experience, Lord of the Rings Online features everything you’d expect from a game set among within author J.R.R. Tolkien’s greatest creation\n\nWhat we think: Released all the way back in 2007, The Lord of the Rings Online is a huge game that fully realizes the entirety of Middle-earth. Though its graphics have inevitably suffered under the relentless progression of the last 15 years, it’s still an hugely impressive achievement that perfectly captures the vibe that both LotR book readers and movie watchers would expect.\n\nThe game switched to a free-to-play model all the way back in 2010, meaning that you can play almost all of the MMO’s content without needing to hand over a dime. That being said, the most recent content additions will cost you, with the most recent Corsairs of Umbar expansion coming in at £30.99. There’s also a VIP subscription model on offer that provides adventurers with everything from additional inventory slots to ‘Legendary Servers’, daily XP bonuses, and a whole lot more.\n\nWith seven races and eleven classes, from High Elves to a Stout-Axe and even a Beorning, you can shape your character’s fantasy as you see fit. If you’re a fan of PvP content, you’re in luck, as there’s a PvMP (Monster Play) mode that pits you against players stepping into the shoes of, well, a monster.\n\nThe game is undoubtedly PvE-focused, so those looking for that will also feel right at home as they explore the virtual Middle-earth. Taking its story from the work of both J.R.R. and Christopher Tolkien, there is no better fantasy story in gaming anywhere and its more than worth jumping into, especially considering the low barrier of entry.\n\n10. Black Desert Online\n\nWhat is it: Known for its incredible visual fidelity and impressively realized world, Black Desert Online is one of the largest and most complete MMO experiences on offer today\n\nWhat we think: Pearl Abyss’ Black Desert Online was already arguably the best-looking MMORPG on the market. That envelope was pushed even further in 2018, when Black Desert Remastered brought in an even higher visual standard and audio improvements.\n\nThe main selling point of BDO is that it offers a truly open world, giving you complete freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want. The game’s story, while entertaining, can be muddled and tricky to follow, but the vast array of other features means that you’re never lacking for something to do.\n\nThat being said, there’s a lot of grinding, and casual players may often feel overwhelmed at just how much there is to get through. With tons of life skills to pick up outside of typical combat, players can adopt the life of a farmer and hire workers to do all of the hard work, purchase properties or fish, and become merchants by transporting their goods through different trade routes to make that big sale.\n\nCharacter customization in Black Desert is also limitless, letting you truly mold every aspect of your adventurer, even down to the texture and length of their hair. Black Desert also gives away free goodies through redeemable codes, meaning you can stockpile items to use toward your adventure as new ones are released.\n\n11. RuneScape\n\nWhat is it: The “modern” version of the beloved MMO, it’s packed with a whole host of newer features that may appeal to a younger audience\n\nWhat we think: One of the OG MMOs, RuneScape has gone through huge changes since its initial release — from content expansions to visual overhauls (and more coming in the future!)\n\nEasily downloaded and run on both PC, Mac, Linux, and mobile, the game is completely cross-save, allowing you to pick up and play on any platform.\n\nThe main difference between this and its more archaic sibling in OSRS is approachability. New players to the genre or game will likely find this version to be far more forgiving, and there is a lot of content to work through at a pace that fits any schedule. Requiring less grind to get involved than some of its immediate competition, RuneScape is very much friendly to the casual audience.\n\nRuneScape also features a huge number of skills that affect how you approach and interact with the world of Gielinor. While some, like Farming, Invention, and Thieving, are locked to members only, there are over 15 skills free players can level up in, from Woodcutting to Fishing.\n\nThe overall improvements and expansions the devs made to the game, alongside Jagex’s respect for some of the simpler features from the past, make this free MMO one everyone should try out.\n\n12. New World\n\nWhat is it: Amazon Game Studios’ New World MMORPG is based on the settling of America, with players venturing to a land shrouded in mystery to uncover its secrets.\n\nWhat we think: Thanks in large part to its 1600s setting, the world combines unique armor and styling with a high-fantasy feel for a truly impressive player experience. You battle against NPC Humans who have been corrupted by the island of Aeternum’s mystical, dark power source.\n\nAs you explore and unravel the world’s lore, you’ll be able to take part in dungeons, expansive PvP content that pits between 25 and 50 players against one another, and even a PvPvE mode as you vie for control by killing enemies and collecting resources for your team.\n\nNew World is also full of skills centered around non-combat aspects of the game, giving you vast amounts of variety. Combat is also varied thanks to the different weapons on offer, with plenty to enjoy as you experiment with the game skills and attributes. Though the player count has dwindled in recent months, there’s more than enough in the current game to make it worth a go, particularly if you’re happy to work through the game solo (for the most part).\n\n13. Lost Ark\n\nWhat is it: Lost Ark is the rarely seen MMO ARPG, giving fans of games like Diablo and the multiplayer genre itself the chance to fight foes in a gorgeous, isometric world.\n\nWhat we think: Initially released in Korea back in 2018, Lost Ark finally arrived on Western shores early in 2022. There are six base character classes with their own specific playstyles, each of which has its own ‘Advanced’ versions (alongside plenty of unreleased ones) that further shape the way you approach the world. There are seven unique continents to explore, the chance to sail the high seas, and plenty of dungeons, quests, and PvP battles to keep you spoiled for choice in Lost Ark.\n\nEach of your abilities can be upgraded, too, further allowing you to create a character that fits in with your personal style. Alongside that are a whole host of non-combat-related skills to train and refine. In Arkesia, you’ll be able to explore, collect and fight to your heart’s content in a unique take on the MMORPG genre.\n\nLost Ark has impressive depth that immediately places it among the better games in the genre, even if its audience in the West has dwindled in recent times. The world you’ll operate within is also refreshing, eschewing the irrepressibly bleak format laid out in games like Diablo to bring its audience something a little more varied. Though the gameplay loop won’t necessarily appeal to everyone, Lost Ark is a great game to jump into at any skill level and with any amount of free time.\n\n14. Star Wars: The Old Republic\n\nWhat is it: The premier MMO set in the Star Wars universe, it features iconic locations and characters for the full Jedi experience.\n\nWhat we think: Fans of BioWare games like the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises will feel right at home with this free-to-play MMO. Featuring everything from romanceable companions, to fully-voiced NPCs (including your own character!) SWTOR provides RPG features that some of the other best games on this list could only dream of.\n\nIt can be fully played up to level 60 for free, and you can also experience the first two expansions at no extra cost. There’s a lot of content to get through before you even need to consider signing up for their subscription model, with some restrictions, of course, but despite that, there’s plenty to do.\n\nEach of the game’s 8 classes has a completely different storyline to explore, and it wouldn’t be a Star Wars game without the option to commit to either the Light Side or the Dark Side, complete with visual changes as you err closer and closer to either end of the spectrum.\n\n15. Fallout 76\n\nWhat is it: Bethesda’s iconic Fallout franchise makes its first foray into the MMO genre, as players explore Appalachia just 25 years after the bombs dropped.\n\nWhat we think: Though it went through one of the roughest launches in recent history, Fallout 76 has been on an absolute tear in recent months. Initially, the game was lacking in what players have come to expect as basic features, including NPCs. This made the whole game feel empty, with an eye-wateringly expensive cash shop further worsening the experience.\n\nSince then, Bethesda has rolled out major updates and expansions that have entirely turned the game on its head. NPCs now fill the wilds of Appalachia, and players embark on major quests together. Major factions from the single-player games now feature, and thanks to the release of Expeditions, it’s also possible to head to iconic locations like The Pitt.\n\nFallout 76 is filled with unique weapons and armor, as well as a crafting system that truly makes you feel like a Wasteland Wanderer. With more being added to the game all the time, it’s become an important part of the series and well worth playing as an existing fan.\n\n16. Star Citizen\n\nWhat is it: The most funded game in history, Star Citizen is a vast space sandbox that combines features from several genres into one enormous experience.\n\nWhat we think: Star Citizen is nothing if not controversial. After a successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2012 raised $2 million, the game blew past its original 2014 release date and there’s still no full debut in sight. Additionally, as of May 2024, the game has raised a scarcely believable $700 million, as it continues to expand its overall offering.\n\nStar Citizen is divided into three distinct modules or modes that offer a different aspect of the gameplay experience. The first is Hangar, which currently allows players to explore and interact with their own ships. Arena Commander is a space combat simulator that allows players to engage in dogfights with other players or the AI. The third is Star Marine, which is essentially a ground combat simulator set within the same world.\n\nAll three of those modules are also available to play in a combined persistent universe. This can be considered the game proper and it really is an impressive technological achievement. Transitioning between the three games states can be a little buggy but there really is something for everyone if you have the time to invest in participating in Star Citizen.\n\n17. Blade & Soul\n\nWhat is it: A bit of an under-the-radar entry into the genre, Blade & Soul combines Wuxia-style martial arts with a solid open world and memorable cast of characters.\n\nWhat we think: Blade & Soul was released in 2012, and it’s still one of the best free-to-play MMORPGs currently available. With a fantastic and engaging story, deep character creation, and high-octane action-based combat full of flashy combos to pull off, it’s definitely one to check out.\n\nFeaturing a blend of both martial arts and magic, the story begins with your character starting off as a student, before being thrust into a world of darkness as you attempt to avenge those who were defeated by the world’s nefarious forces.\n\nBlade & Soul features a dizzying choice of 14 classes to pick from alongside 4 different races. While each class is race-locked, there’s still a wide variety to choose from to play the way you prefer.\n\nBack in September 2021, the game also received a long-awaited Unreal Engine 4 update, too. Bringing the title up to date, there is plenty to like about Blade & Soul, even if its highly stylized approach won’t be to everyone’s tastes.\n\n18. Elite Dangerous\n\nWhat is it: Hardcore space flight simulation set in a 1:1 scale version of our own Milky Way galaxy, with a player-influenced persistent universe.\n\nWhat we think: Back on the eve of their respective releases, much was being made of the supposed rivalry between Elite Dangerous and No Man’s Sky, but in retrospect, it was a bit of a silly comparison. Elite puts players in control of a starship and a few credits then sets them loose. It has a fairly standard format with missions and activities that allow players to earn more money and pilot better ships.\n\nSo far, so normal. Elite’s real strength is drawn from its remarkable ability to make the player feel connected to the world and invested in its fate, all while never leaving the ship. Though the Horizons update now allows players to land on and explore planets (the game is better for it), it’s still rooted in setting out and exploring the stars. It might not have the potential to create quite the same epic encounters as EVE, but it’s a brilliant community to be a part of, nonetheless.\n\n19. Neverwinter\n\nWhat is it: The premier MMO set among the worlds laid out in Dungeons & Dragons, with all of the fantasy trappings that you would expect from Faerûn and beyond.\n\nWhat we think: Neverwinter has been through the mill over the years, as other MMOs steal the spotlight away from it. Despite that, there is a very solid game here that offers fast-paced and mechanically sound combat, alongside memorable encounters and a well-crafted overall narrative.\n\nThe world offered by Neverwinter is bright and often beautiful, with clear cues taken from both its immediate peers in the genre and the tabletop inspiration behind it. That said, in 2024 it does come with a few caveats.\n\nThe first of those is that the game has begun to show its age. Though other MMOs have been around longer, almost all of those have received visual upgrades in one form or another. Additionally, the player base is somewhat below comfortable levels, so group activities can be difficult to proceed through at any real pace. Lastly, the in-game cash shop feels a little predatory in its offering of pseudo-loot boxes and other randomized items.\n\nThat being said, there is plenty of enjoyment that can be drawn from the game without the pressure of a particularly competitive scene within the game.\n\n20. Star Trek Online\n\nWhat is it: Large-scale space combat rendered in an expansive open universe. Star Trek Online features all of the factions, ships and details that players would expect from the beloved sci-fi creation.\n\nWhat we think: Star Trek Online will celebrate its 15th birthday next year and, though it does show its age on occasion, there remains plenty of fun to be had. The game is set thirty years after the Star Trek: Nemesis movie, and the alliance between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire has collapsed.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, players are thrust into the captain’s chair as they take their position among the stars. Star Trek Online operates within two gameplay loops where you are either directly piloting a ship, exploring and participating in battles, or beamed down to the surface of a planet. The latter is where the class system comes into play, with how you choose to setup having a direct effect on your potency as an individual.\n\nThe space battles are refreshingly protracted, rewarding tactical nouse and timely use of weapons and shields. With an interesting narrative structure to boot, Star Trek Online is still well worth a visit, even if its halcyon days are behind it.\n\n21. Albion Online\n\nWhat is it: Sandbox MMORPG with strong fantasy elements. Albion Online features a full player-driven economy and no class system.\n\nWhat we think: In a move that seems weirdly logical the more I think about it, Albion Online shrugs off many of the shackles placed on it by the MMORPG genre. The game features no class system at all, instead giving players a blank slate where character build and skills are dictated by the gear you’re wearing. This is a remarkably liberating thing to come across when playing for the first time and Albion’s nice surprises don’t stop there.\n\nThe art style might lead you to believe that it’s relatively relaxed, maybe even cozy. Not so, with Albion’s PvP encounters some of the more hectic I’ve played. If you’re looking for PvE then this absolutely isn’t the game for you, but as something to jump in and out of at your leisure, it’s a great option. The P2W element of this game does rear its head from time to time, but this game shines brightest as a casual pursuit.\n\n22. Diablo 4\n\nWhat is it: The most famous and celebrated ARPG series in the history of the genre, Blizzard’s latest effort continues to build on its solid foundations.\n\nWhat we think: Though it has definitely had its fair share of critics since launching last year, Diablo 4 is a brilliant game. The base release follows Lilith, who serves as the overriding antagonist in the initial narrative and during the journey to level 100. That mantle is set to soon be taken over by her father Mephisto, in the Vessel of Hatred expansion, and there’s never been a better time to get involved before its release.\n\nThe game currently features five playable classes, with a sixth on the way as part of Vessel of Hatred. The gameplay rewards skill and knowledge of how to play your character and there’s a ton of difficulty scaling that should keep you busy for an age.\n\nThough we might be stretching the definition of MMO slightly with this one, the RPG elements are clear and one of Diablo’s strongest elements remains its story. The developer has struggled to balance classes and playstyles at times, but things are improving each day and you would struggle to find a healthier and more active game on this list.\n\n23. Trove\n\nWhat is it: A Minecraft-style MMO adventure where players can fight and build to their heart’s content, alone or with a multitude of friends.\n\nWhat we think: More than anything, Trove is good, clean family fun. The influence of Minecraft is clear in both the game’s art style and its approach to building and crafting. Players can choose from an intimidating 17 classes, many of which you won’t find in any other game. From Candy Barbarians to Chloromancers, you aren’t likely to know what you’re doing thanks to experience in the genre.\n\nThat said, Trove is easy to pick up and play either alone or with friends, and there are plenty of ways to meet new companions along the way. One of the coolest features is player-made gear, with anyone able to submit designs for new items to be added to the game. This has resulted in a huge volume of gear to explore and near-limitless potential for character creation.\n\nFor those constantly bemoaning the lack of player housing in mainstream MMOs, you should have no problems here. Trove allows you to build a personal home block by block, known as a cornerstone. This cornerstone can then be placed in specific areas in other regions, so you always have your custom house along for the ride. This extends further still, with some players building entire worlds to inhabit. A game so relaxing that it’s almost criminal and vastly different from many of its immediate peers in the genre.\n\n24. Dune: Awakening\n\nWhat is it: The first MMO set in Frank Herbert’s Dune universe, it takes place in an alternate reality where Paul Atreides was not born.\n\nWhat we think: The Dune movies have created a new fervor for Frank Herbert’s worlds, and Dune: Awakening could be the perfect game to satisfy that desire. Set on the planet Arrakis, it promises an expansive narrative that draws in characters and groups from the famed fictional work. The game will also help those figures from the written work by making them a major part of how players form their characters.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit will be able to teach them certain abilities, while Mentats have entirely different knowledge to impart. This should, in theory, lead to a class system that rewards hybrid-build players as much as those who specialize in one thing.\n\nThe game is currently in a beta stage, with a full release date yet to be determined. Funcom is currently accepting beta sign-ups, so if you like the look of it, there should be an opportunity to jump in soon.\n\n25. Tibia\n\nWhat is it: A true classic of the MMORPG genre, Tibia features a 2D tile-based world with an engrossing fantasy setting.\n\nWhat we think: There are very few games that can claim popularity 25 years after their release, and even fewer that boast a daily player count in the tens of thousands. Tibia is just such a game. It features many elements that have since become genre staples, like killing monsters to obtain loot and wealth, but the 2D art style has surprisingly come full circle and become refreshing again.\n\nIt’s also a brutal and bruising experience that its charming exterior fails to portray. You will die, likely a lot, and the game will punish you for doing so. Specifically, if you die one too many times, it will boot you all the way back to the rookie island at the start of the game. This essentially amounts to a full restart and it can feel harsh on the first playthrough. It’s also a remarkable testament to the game’s quality that so many still return in spite of these hardcore elements.\n\n26. Pax Dei\n\nWhat is it: A social sandbox MMO that draws inspiration from medieval myth and legend.\n\nWhat we think: Entering Steam Early Access in June 2024, Pax Dei has drawn a lot of attention. From the outside, at least, it seems to tick all of the boxes. Its premise is exciting enough: a medieval-era world where creatures of myth are unquestionably a part of everyday life.\n\nThe huge world is defined by places to harvest and craft, evil zones to explore and conquer and areas for players to call home. It features a full housing system that actually takes into account structural integrity, so the only thing limiting your imagination is the crushing reality of physics.\n\nCombat also looks lightning quick and exciting, with a real prominence placed on forming a community and advancing the game world together. With plenty of collaboration with the player base planned for development, it might be a good time to get in on the ground floor.\n\n27. Palia\n\nWhat is it: Somewhere between Disney Dreamlight Valley and Animal Crossing, this is an MMO that puts the emphasis on fostering a sense of community and growth.\n\nWhat we think: If you’re looking for exciting combat or extensive skill trees, then Palia won’t be the game for you. That said, for a certain corner of the gaming community that loves cozy simulators, Palia may well be a dream come true. One of the more recent games on this list, it features a shared world where players can grow their home plots in perfect harmony.\n\nThe game offers a fully customizable player housing set with a plot system where you can really stake your claim to a piece of land. There are extensive farming and land usage mechanics, as well as hunting opportunities and crafting. Though it can be played entirely solo, the MMO elements of this game set it apart from the other life and colony sims. It’s also free-to-play, so don’t be afraid to jump in and give it a try.\n\n28. RIFT\n\nWhat is it: Free-to-play full-package MMO that offers dungeons, raids and large battles against immense, fantastical creatures.\n\nWhat we think: RIFT might use a fairly monolithic approach to building an MMO, but what it does attempt, it does well, for the most part. Set in the realm of Telara, it features much of the fantasy fare that experienced players in the genre have come to expect.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, if a little uninspiring at times, but the game’s class system is a genuinely interesting approach to player roles. There are five fundamental classes, or “callings,” as the game refers to them.\n\nThe difference comes when actually building within that calling, as the game allows the player free reign. Warriors can sling spells and Mages can be melee monsters. This freeform system greatly elevates an otherwise solid MMO into one that’s fun to try.\n\n29. Dofus\n\nWhat is it: Tactical, turn-based MMORPG set within a high fantasy universe, with both free and paid options for accounts.\n\nWhat we think: The name Dofus refers to the moniker given to dragon eggs in the game. These coveted objects are the source of most conflict and provide a fun backdrop to a warm and inviting game.\n\nThe 2D, turn-based combat is actually fairly well executed. While it doesn’t come close to the greatest examples of this style, there’s more than enough to keep new players entertained. The game’s art direction is reminiscent of the browser games that dominated the 2000s, and the return to that design philosophy seems oddly fitting.\n\nThe paid version of Dofus is predictably where it shines brightest, and free users may quickly find that they are running into obstacles with regularity.\n\n30. Romans: Age of Caesar\n\nWhat is it: Co-operative, grand strategy MMO that puts players in charge of the Roman Empire’s development at the height of its influence.\n\nWhat we think: Though it might currently sit on Mixed reviews on Steam, it was impossible to make this list and not talk about arguably the weirdest game in the entire genre. This slow city builder takes players back to history’s most iconic empire as you grow and expand your settlement.\n\nIn theory, it could be played entirely solo, but the game does emphasize working with other players, and cooperation is key to success. The graphics are ancient, and the gameplay is janky, but it’s worth trying at least once if you’re even vaguely interested in what a co-op grand-scale city builder would be like. Is it as good as Firefly Studios’ best efforts? Absolutely not. But as a free-to-play offering, it’s a weird look at what could be."
