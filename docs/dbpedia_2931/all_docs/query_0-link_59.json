        "text": "Update: The good news is that nothing on this list is leaving Xbox Game Pass this month. Though, we have added Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess to this list!\n\nThere are dozens of fantastic things to play on Game Pass, both on the family of Xbox consoles and PC.\n\nSo really, the question isn’t ‘what are the best games on Game Pass,’ but rather, ‘how do I narrow them down’?\n\nSince Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda brought their exemplary stable of time-sink RPGs to the service, Game Pass has built a rock-solid core of forever titles you can always count on being ready to install. From there, it continues to swap in quality indies and in addition to Microsoft’s first and second party games.\n\nPlus the recent purchase of Activision Blizzard promises to add even more blockbuster titles to the catalogue in the not too distant future.\n\nWhether you’re looking for your next month-long obsession or just a way to burn a lazy Sunday afternoon, here’s a curated selection - in no partiuclar order - of the best Game Pass games for Xbox and PC.\n\nThe best Game Pass Games on Xbox and PC\n\nStarfield, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout, Starfield and every other Bethesda game\n\nCocoon\n\nYakuza: Like a Dragon\n\nMass Effect: Legendary Edition\n\nUnpacking\n\nForza Horizon 5\n\nHalo Infinite\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley\n\nDead Cells\n\nSignalis\n\nHitman Trilogy\n\nCrusader Kings 3\n\nThe Forgotten City\n\nOri and the Will of the Wisps\n\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc\n\nTunic\n\nValheim\n\nSuperliminal\n\nDarkest Dungeon\n\nHollow Knight\n\nFootball Manager 2022\n\nMinecraft\n\nStardew Valley\n\nWasteland 3\n\nVampire Survivors\n\nLEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga\n\nPentiment\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide\n\nSolar Ash\n\nGoat Simulator 3\n\nFar Cry 6\n\nDiablo IV\n\nLEGO 2K Drive\n\nLittle Kitty, Big City\n\nStill Wakes the Deep\n\nMy Time at Sandrock\n\nKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess\n\nStarfield, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout, Starfield and every other Bethesda game\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nIf you’ve never played them, then I’ll let you into something of an open secret: Bethesda RPGs are a little bit good.\n\nWhether it’s the high fantasy world of Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, the quirky post-nuclear wasteland of Fallout, or the whale-oil-punk Victoriandustrial cityscapes of Dishonored, pretty much everything on offer from Bethesda absolutely rules. Oh, and let's not forget brand-new IP Starfield, which has you exploring the vast expanse of space.\n\nAnd that’s to say nothing of the more shooter-focussed side of things - DOOM and Wolfenstein are also both excellent - as well as the underrated sci-fi immersive-sim, Prey, which has one of the best opening sequences around.\n\nOn PC, you also get access to some of the pre-Bethesda entries into series they later acquired. Of these, Fallout 1 and 2 come highly recommended if you’re interested in exploring the franchise lore - but be aware, they are very unforgiving by modern standards.\n\nPlus, there's the tantalizing prospect of the eventual Elder Scrolls 6 on the horizon as well.\n\nFor the sake of space, yes these all count as one on the list.\n\nCocoon\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nDirected by the lead gameplay designer of the legendary puzzle games LIMBO and INSIDE, Cocoon is as unique and arresting an experience as you can have, and the perfect example of a smaller budget, shorter game that can reach a wider audience through a service like Xbox Game Pass.\n\nWhere some games seek only to be visually impressive, Cocoon is constantly exciting mechanically, as you push through increasingly complex puzzles in a variety of eclectic environments.\n\nIt's one of those games where the less you know, the better, but make sure it's near the top of your must-play list!\n\nYakuza: Like a Dragon\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nThe cult Yakuza series has long threatened to boil over into the mainstream, and this turn-based transition with a brand-new protagonist is as perfect a time as any to get involved.\n\nCombining the sublime and the ridiculous, Like a Dragon continues Yakuza’s meticulous recreation of the backstreets and red-light districts of Japan - this time focusing on Yokohama - while taking the series’ trademark wacky humour to the next level to incorporate tropes you’d see in more typical and fantasy turn-based RPGs.\n\nDebuff enemies with demoralising insults, breathe fire with cheap booze and a lighter, or swing a handbag like a makeshift flail to split some skulls.\n\nIn your downtime, take on the roster of new and returning minigames from blackjack and darts to batting cages and karaoke.\n\nMass Effect: Legendary Edition\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC (Game Pass Ultimate required)\n\nPart of Xbox’s team-up with Electronic Arts to include EA Play titles on Game Pass, Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is another swathe of generation-defining RPGs, this time following Commander Shepard across a trilogy of space opera epics as they defend humanity and the galactic alliance from a mysterious and hostile foe.\n\nMass Effect 2 is often held up as one of the real gold standard games of the last 15 years, as you build a crack squad of specialists, Ocean’s Eleven-style, to pull off a high-stakes mission against impossible odds.\n\nBut really, if you can get past the 360/PS3-era feel of some of the gameplay, the whole series is as compelling as it ever was. And the Legendary edition graphical rework makes things a lot easier on the eye as well.\n\nEven if you already played them when they first came out, remember: the Legendary Edition includes all of the DLC you were probably too broke to fork out for at the time, so there’s possibly even new stuff in there for long-time fans.\n\nUnpacking\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nIf saving the world is too much pressure, why not lower the stakes and revel in the joy of tidying up?\n\nIt’s a lot more fun than it sounds.\n\nSet across different snapshots in time, chill out with this satisfying, serene and contemplative indie experience.\n\nForza Horizon 5\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nA racing game that’s just as fun for hardcore speedsters and people who don’t usually like racing games, Forza Horizon 5 offers customisable races, a moreish collect-a-thon of beautiful cars, and a varied open-world version of Mexico that’s fantastically well designed.\n\nIf you’re the kind of player that only picks up a controller between track days, you can crank the difficulty for a true test of your driving mettle. Or if you’re like me, every time you mess up a corner you can use the seamless rewind function to whiz back to where everything was going smoothly and pretend you’re still the racecar boss you always dreamed you were.\n\nForza Horizon 4 is also great and a relatively similar experience, just set in the southwest of the UK. So if you’d rather explore Yeovil than the Yucatan, check out the previous entry instead.\n\nHalo Infinite\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nOne of the best things about Gamepass is that you get a lot of the top-tier exclusive Microsoft-backed games from the day they’re released and Halo Infinite is one of the best.\n\nMaster Chief returns to the fore in this shiny, semi-open-world adventure that combines fan-service-y Halo lore for returning fans with classically-styled but endlessly engaging first-person shooting that has that unique series-defining feel.\n\nThe game also includes an incredible online multiplayer mode that manages to be incredibly competitive and frenetic, but with a very different tempo to reflex-heavy FPSs like Call of Duty and battle royale games.\n\nIt’s not all seriousness and po-faced drama however, Halo Infinite is also a lesson on how to own a lukewarm first impression, packed full of Craig the Brute memes and off-the-wall unlockable skull cheats.\n\nStar Wars Jedi Fallen Order\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC (Game Pass Ultimate required)\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order asks, ‘What if Dark Souls, but with an easy mode and with lightsabers that go vroom?’\n\nTaking shameless inspiration from the tough-but-fair RPG trend and layering it with the quintessential Star Wars aesthetic and lore we all know and love, Fallen Order is a fantastic romp up there with the best Star Wars games.\n\nThanks to the recent next-gen graphical update as well, it looks better than ever.\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, Switch, PlayStation, PC\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley is a life-sim from GameLoft, that places you in a quaint little village alongside plenty of fan-favourite Disney characters. Whether you're a Disney adult or not, Dreamlight Valley is surprisingly fun.\n\nWhile you will spend plenty of time resource gathering via mining, farming, and all that other stuff you're used to from simulation games, Disney Dreamlight Valley doesn't ever feel like a chore. It always feels like you're achieving something, which results in a rather relaxing, but satisfying, gameplay experience.\n\nYou can also play chef alongside Remy from Ratatouille, and watch the tumultuous relationship between Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck unfold. These are just a few of the small additions that make gameplay feel more alive.\n\nWhat's better is that the game is still in Early Access, and there's plenty new characters and updates to come.\n\nDead Cells\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nOne of the best roguelites anywhere, let alone on Game Pass, Dead Cells combines brutal combat and hardcore platforming with a memorable dark pixel aesthetic to create something as engrossing as it is rewarding.\n\nWhile it can take a while to get a grounding in its shifting, labyrinthine world, collecting stat-altering power ups and building out your character from a massive roster of equipment adds an interesting element of experimentation to the mix.\n\nIf you like your games to put up a fight, Dead Cells is a willing opponent.\n\nSignalis\n\nPlatforms: Xbox One, PS4, PC\n\nAre you a fan of survival horror? Are you familiar with the likes of Resident Evil and Silent Hill? If so, Signalis is a must-play for people like you. If not, Signalis is a rabbit-hole well worth venturing into.\n\nThis pixel art survival horror title is Rose Engine's debut, and it's incredibly impressive. Thrown into the shoes of Ester, a Replika agent who awakes on board a barren facility full of their infected counterparts, it's down to you to solve puzzles, traverse trapped corridors, and find answers.\n\nThe art style of the game is impressive, and even when you find yourself frustrated with various puzzles, you'll find yourself appreciating the environment. And let's not forget Signalis' sound design, which is eerily reminscent of the industrial sounds you'll be used to hearing in a Silent Hill game.\n\nHitman Trilogy\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nOft forgotten and underrated as a series, the three most recent Hitman games offer level after level of excellent assassination sandboxes to mess around in.\n\nHitman 2 and 3 are particularly great, with tons of memorable setpieces like the country manor murder mystery - where you impersonate a detective solving a previous crime while simultaneously killing the suspects.\n\nGrabbing the whole trilogy as one package lets you binge through as much as you can muster without having to eke out every possibility, but it’s just as fun to replay the same scenarios to attempt all of the grisly permutations.\n\nCrusader Kings 3\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nSchmooze, stab and seduce your way to a prosperous kingdom in Crusader Kings 3, where you take on the world to establish your family as the dominant dynasty across the Middle Ages.\n\nThis isn’t just some turn-based war simulator where you LARP at contracting dysentery though. All manner of statecraft is available to you when it comes to dealing with rivals, letting you take the high road of conventional diplomacy, the clandestine route of a few poison ear drops in the bedroom, or a straight-up muddy pitchfork fight between peasant armies should the need arise.\n\nEndlessly surprising as you connive your way to the top, fall back down again, then claw up the rungs once more as your disposed king’s rightful heir, Crusader Kings 3 shows that even though the weight of a crown wears heavy, it’s a lot of fun to try and keep it from toppling.\n\nThe Forgotten City\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nIs your favourite part of open-world RPGs talking to people in a fantasy world rather than hitting giant crabs? Then The Forgotten City is just the game for you!\n\nOriginally conceived as a Skyrim mod, this time-bending indie whodunnit is as compelling a mystery as any classic tale.\n\nExploring preserved Greek and Roman ruins, you collect evidence and conduct interviews with a memorable cast of characters to unravel the secrets of your situation.\n\nOri and the Will of the Wisps\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nBoth Ori and the Blind Forest and the sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps are on Game Pass, and both are brilliant.\n\nIn a crowded field of 2D adventures, the Ori series is a standout thanks to its vast and varied storybook world, pin-point gameplay and exceptional vibes.\n\nWhile it might seem like a kids game - and it certainly is ‘fun for all the family’ as they say - there’s a deeply satisfying core here of great design well executed that makes it an absolute must play.\n\nThey’re not very long games either, making them a great fit for a couple good weekends of play with a one month subscription, rather than getting bogged down in some 100 hour epic.\n\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nIn the madcap world of Japanese visual novels, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is one of the very best.\n\nEach attendee of the prestigious Hope’s Peak Academy is known throughout the world as the ‘Ultimate’ practitioner of their chosen profession, but when they’re trapped in the school by the terrible teddy bear Monokuma, their only chance of escape is to murder one of their classmates - and get away with it.\n\nBursting with iconic characters, quotable lines, and an off-beat soundtrack that’s stickier than super glue, the whole Danganronpa series is well worth your attention.\n\nTunic\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nA gorgeous, polygonal Zelda-like, Tunic evokes the nostalgic spirit of your favourite adventures without feeling too derivative or outstaying its welcome.\n\nWhere a lot of modern action RPGs lean into the trend of super-hard worlds filled with punishing combat and every obstacle being a pain-in-the-neck, here you guide your foxy friend across a mysterious and mystical island filled with interesting secrets and great map design.\n\nWhen everything else feels a bit serious, Tunic is a purer game with great art and a beautiful heart.\n\nValheim\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nValheim is one of the best survival games out there, and given the small team behind the game, this is quite the achievement.\n\nBased in a procedurally generated world inspired heavily by Norse mythology, Valheim is about more than just surviving; it's about the story that unfolds too. You start out as a legendary warrior whose soul has gone to Valheim, where you must restore piece and fend off the enemies of Odin.\n\nIf you do find yourself picking this one up on Game Pass, we've fortunately got a whole host of Valheim guides to help you along.\n\nSuperliminal\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nWe all don’t have quite as much cash as we’d like to spend on games, so when ingeniously innovative puzzle games like Superliminal come along that are super creative, but also very short, it’s understandable that most people opt for something meatier.\n\nBut when it’s included in Game Pass, there’s no reason not to dive into this memorable and mind-bending mystery where you can never quite believe your eyes.\n\nDarkest Dungeon\n\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox One\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a challenging roguelike RPG with a lot to do. Throughout, not only will you strive to keep your heroes alive, but you'll need to pay close attention to their psychological state too.\n\nGoing from dungeon to dungeon is no easy feat, and the unimaginable horrors hidden among them can drive your team to insanity long before they actually succumb to death. However, if you can manage your band of heroes effectively, this is a fun, dark take on your typical dungeon crawl.\n\nHollow Knight\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nAn awesome metroidvania-style RPG exploring a tiny world of bugs underground, Hollow Knight is a meaty slice of 2D action, pitting you against brutal bosses and perilous platforming sections across your journey.\n\nIt’s not all about the gameplay though. There’s plenty of hidden lore to unearth, the roots of which will leave you mulling over the history of this forgotten creepy-crawly kingdom for long after you roll the credits.\n\nFootball Manager 2022\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nYou can now dive into the all-consuming world of Football Manager as part of your Game Pass subscription, but be warned, you might never be able to cancel again.\n\nCrunching an unfathomably huge amount of data to sim as realistic as managerial experience as possible, Football Manager 2022 is the truest test of your footballing mettle around, since all that stands between humiliating defeat and resounding victory is your tactical nouse.\n\nWith an ever-increasing amount of real-world licences, deep lists of real players and an almost overwhelming degree of control at your fingertips, it’s no wonder people often apply for actual football management jobs with a list of their FM achievements on their CV.\n\nMinecraft\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nAh, Minecraft! This survival title from Mojang is arguably a staple for Game Pass, especially now that Java and Bedrock are available from the same launcher. This means you can play whichever version you prefer, and will never have to miss out on teaming up with friends.\n\nMinecraft is a simple game (for the most part) all about blocks. You'll spawn in a random world with nothing to your name, and your only task is to survive the night. Over a decade of fun has been had with Minecraft, with creators truly pushing the game and their builds to extreme limits in an effort to create something impressive.\n\nThat being said, if you've never tried out Minecraft, there's no better time than the present to go about crafting a home and felling the Ender Dragon.\n\nStardew Valley\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nBeloved with good reason, Stardew Valley is a deep and subtly gorgeous farming sim where you inherit your grandad’s homestead and build it back into a thriving ranch.\n\nYou raise cute animals, cultivate a huge variety of crops, explore a sprawling network of underground tunnels and meet new friends in the nearby town as you build your own beautiful rural life.\n\nThink rebuilding a farming business is too big a task for you alone? Well, the whole of Stardew Valley was pretty much made by one person, so there’s no excuse to not give it your all!\n\nWasteland 3\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nThe original Wasteland dropped back in the ‘80s, but its mutant brand of post-nuclear americana went on to directly inspire the core of another series you might have heard of - the first two Fallout games.\n\nRevived in the classic mould of high-camera, strategy-laden RPG, Wasteland 2 (also on Game Pass) and Wasteland 3 take the kooky heart everyone loves in Fallout and crank it up to an extreme degree.\n\nAs you help the Arizona Rangers win the trust and support of Colorado’s strongman leader The Patriarch, you’ll decide the fate of a mercantile gang who only wear halloween costumes, free the elves in Santa’s drug workshop, and take on a vicious cult that worship a truly terrifying creature: Ronald Reagan.\n\nVampire Survivors\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nAh, Vampire Survivors. This is the game that made editor-in-chief, Tom Orry, burn his lunch once he'd started playing, so you know it's good.\n\nVampire Survivors is a game where, honestly, you don't do all that much. That, however, is the joy of it. Don't judge it by the fact it looks old, or the fact that we just told you that you don't do much at all, because this game essentially provides free serotonin.\n\nYour goal is to survive as long as you can against hordes of enemies, using loot and power ups to get upgrades and thus, try survive even longer. It might seem minimalistic, because it is, but we can assure you that this is exactly what makes the game so great.\n\nLEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nEveryone has played a LEGO game at some point or another, and if you haven't, then we've got the perfect game for you: LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.\n\nThat's all nine mainline films in the Star Wars series, retold in a video game, where every character is made of LEGO bricks. If you enjoy Star Wars, it's a fantastic time, packed with jovial music and fitting jokes.\n\nWhat's better is that the game supports co-op play too, and is an even better experience alongside someone else.\n\nPentiment\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nPentiment comes from the folk over at Obsidian Entertainment, and is an absolute gem tucked away on Xbox Game Pass. It's a illustrated narrative-driven game with some of the most beautiful stylised art we've seen in a while.\n\nYou play as Andreas Maler during 16th century Europe, meeting up with a vibrant array of characters while uncovering mysteries and attempting to solve them. Pentiment is a \"wonderful tapestry of historical intrigue,\" as said by our own Jim Trinca, and history fans among us are in for an incredible time.\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem\n\nPlatforms: Xbox, PC\n\nA Plague Tale: Requiem follows predecessor, A Plague Tale: Innocence, and enthralls you in a world of the supernatural. If you haven't been privy to a glimpse at the game yet, you should check it out solely for how visually breathtaking it can be.\n\nAs you might've guessed from the title, your role in this action-adventure game is to step into the shoes of Amicia as they fend off hordes of rats that are spreading the black plague, and soldiers from the French Inquisition. All in all, it's an emotional tale of two siblings set in medieval France that'll stay with you long after you've finished playing.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide\n\nPlatforms: PC\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Darktide is a first-person co-op action game that works similarly to Warhammer: Vermintide 2. Yourself, and up to three additional friends, are to take on waves of enemies. To spice things up a little further, you're able to choose your own class, appearance, and gender, so you can delve into the RPG side of things.\n\nIn this elaborate environment, you'll find shoot 'em up fun, a great attention to detail, and most importantly, a challenge. This one is unfortunately only on Game Pass for PC, however.\n\nSolar Ash\n\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox\n\nSolar Ash comes from the creators of the award-winning Hyper Light Drifter, so you already know you're in for a pretty good time. In this game, you play as Rei, a Voidrunner who is determined to speed their way through abandoned ruins and dreamscapes as they avoid the Ultravoid.\n\nIf you enjoy fast-paced science-fiction with vibrant worlds and gruesome creatures, Solar Ash is a short 5-7 hour game that you'll derive plenty of satisfaction from. Platform your way to safety, and with any luck, you might save Rei's home.\n\nGoat Simulator 3\n\nPlatforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S\n\nIf you played Goat Simulator and that was enough to put you off silly goat games for life, take a minute to hear me out. Goat Simulator 3 - yes, they skipped 2 - is an absolute blast. It improves massively on its predecessor, with a beautiful open world for you to explore on hoof, by shuffling on your backside, or as a longboard-riding Shark, if you want.\n\nLess buggy than the last, with more quest objectives for players to meet and plenty of hilarious moments, I can't express enough how much I believe Goat Simulator 3 has at the very least, something for everyone to laugh at. There's plenty of neat Easter eggs for pop culture fans, too, with references to Doom, Star Wars, Skyrim and more to look forward to uncovering.\n\nThe folk over at Coffee Stain North created a chaotic action game with a goat for the protagonist, and it's hours of mindless fun alone or with friends. For free via Game Pass, there's no excuse to not give it a try!\n\nFar Cry 6\n\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nFar Cry 6 is a story about liberating a nation from the diabolical Anton Castillo, played by Breaking Bad and The Mandalorian's Giancarlo Esposito. It's story is definitely interesting, taking you across an expansive group of islands known as Yara that are inspired by Cuba. This is where you'll be playing the role of guerrilla across jungles, cities, and plenty of long stretches of road.\n\nWhere the story - and often repetitive quests - falter, the gameplay itself makes up for it. Gunplay is wholly satisfying, with an array of distinct weapons and animal companions to help you in your plight to liberate Yara. Dani Rojas is an exceptional protagonist who I could listen to all day long, and while it isn't Far Cry 2 or 3, I'd say that it's still worth your time.\n\nDiablo IV\n\nPlatforms: PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\n\nDiablo IV is set to arrive on Xbox Game Pass on March 28, so you might have a short while to wait before playing it via XGP. Alas, Sanctuary is calling for you once more, and Diablo IV will see you coming face to face with demons galore.\n\nWhile there have been some issues with the game from fans - when isn't there? - and it certainly could've been better, that has not stopped players from challenging themselves to hardcore runs or enthralling themselves in the brutal, bloody action.\n\nLEGO 2K Drive\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox Series One, Nintendo Switch, PC\n\nLEGO 2K Drive is good, but arguably not worth the price tag attached to it. So, with the game arriving on Xbox Game Pass, now is a better time than ever to give the game a whirl before spending your hard-earned cash. One of the first LEGO driving games in decades, you can expect to be building cars from LEGO bricks and then using them to race with friends or roam the world of Bricklandia.\n\nIt's got nothing on the likes of LEGO Star Wars and so forth, but if you want to race with LEGO vehicles and craft some impressive - or abominable - rides, then LEGO 2K Drive is worth taking a look at.\n\nLittle Kitty, Big City\n\nPlatforms: Xbox Series X/S, Xbox Series One, Nintendo Switch, PC\n\nIf you enjoyed Stray, or prefer your cat games to be a little sillier, then Little Kitty, Big City is for you. Inspired by the cats and family of Double Dagger Studio founder, Matt Wood, this adventure game has you playing as an adorable black cat who is lost in the streets of Japan.\n\nAs a result, you get to complete all manner of cat-like activities while exploring leisurely, making friends with other animals that you meet along the way. You can also choose exactly how mischevious of a cat you are, with plenty opportunity to knock things from heights or, you know, catnap in the sun. At some point, you'll also want to find your way home... or not. It's a hard life being a cat, after all!\n\nStill Wakes the Deep\n\nPlatforms: Xbox Series X/S, PC, PlayStation 5\n\nStill Wakes the Deep was a day-one launch on Game Pass, having arrived on June 18. And this short tale from The Chinese Room - the developers behind Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody's Gone to Rapture - is an impressive feat. In our review of the game, Jim spoke about how it was an 'accurate depiction of Scotland's oppressive social contract', and an 'incredible artistic achievement'.\n\nWhat do you do in Still Wakes the Deep, though? Well, this horror-narrative game sees you working on an oil rig hundreds of miles off the Scottish coast in 1975, but of course, things take a turn for the worse. It's up to you to navigate the rig and ultimately, try and save your crew from the horrors you'll be running into, or should I say, away from...\n\nMy Time at Sandrock\n\nPlatforms: Xbox Series X/S, Xbox Series One, Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5\n\nMy Time at Sandrock is the spiritual successor to My Time at Portia, and while the visual art-style wasn't to my personal taste - and there was a lot of grinding to be done - this is arguably one of the best simulation games out there right now. It's tight, packed with content for you to complete, and full of charming characters to help out or even romance.\n\nThink Harvest Moon with a facelift, blended with Stardew Valley's best bits. It's cosy and fruitful, and you'll never run out of things to do as you try to save this sandy community from financial ruin with your ranch.\n\nKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess\n\nPlatforms: Xbox Series X/S, Xbox Series One, Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5\n\nAn action-RPG, tower defence game, and a brawler walk into a bar. The barman says “what is this, a setup for some sort of convoluted joke?” and the trio replies “no, we’re the core elements of Capcom’s newest weird-as-hell genre-bending masterpiece”. Forgive me for the peculiar intro here, but if you play this game, you’ll know it’s in keeping with the tone.\n\nKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is Capcom at its brilliantly weirdest, experimenting with genre tropes and using its wonderful RE Engine to really push out a game that literally no-one was expecting. It reminds me, in all the best ways, of something you’d expect to be trapped on the PS3 or 360 generation, when games like Brutal Legend and Lost Planet were cocking around genre conventions and creating these weird chimeras that’d go on to live in cult esteem forever.\n\nKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is that to a T; it may not be for everyone, but give it some respect and a couple of hours, and you’ll find one of the most refreshing gaming experiences of 2024 show itself to you in a flurry of feathers and fletches."
