        "text": "How?\n\nAccording to Wiki, the Gamecube version was ported by Hypnos Entertainment, while the original PS2 version was EA Redwood.\n\nHow? How did this happen?\n\nJust to be clear: The Return Of The King was a really graphically impressive game for the time. Characters had a really high quality level of detail (actually being based on the actor likenesses), levels were designed and created using assets from the films, even the enemy models had an impressive level of quality and animation, and there was nearly always a huge amount of chaos happening on screen. If not quite Dynasty Warriors levels of enemy hordes, then not that far off in some levels.\n\nWhen I played the game on OG Xbox back in the day, it was capped at 30fps, and honestly that seemed entirely reasonable given the amount of graphical wizardry going on.\n\nNow I learn that the Gamecube version, while looking every bit as good as the Xbox version, ran at double the framerate? I didn't believe it at first, but footage on Youtube seems to back this up:\n\nDolphin footage explicitly shows the game running at 60fps:\n\nThis is honestly boggling to me. The Gamecube version of a high production value tie in to one of the biggest blockbusters ever just randomly runs at double the framerate of its PS2 and Xbox brethren. I can't think of any other multiplat games of the generation that did this, and certainly ones that favoured the Gamecube over the Xbox.\n\nThe game still looks good to this day. Possibly one of the best looking games on the Gamecube?\n\nI didn't even know this was on more than the PS2!\n\nAll three consoles, PC and even GBA (though that was just a separate tie in game sharing the movie title).\n\nThat's what makes this all the more bizarre. I can understand the Playstation 2 version running at 30; it's a really visually impressive game, loads of production values, loads of effects, enemies, high density of detail, etc. I can understand the PC version running at an uncapped frame rate.\n\nBut then, randomly, the GameCube is just \"Yeah, sure, I can double the frame rate on this bad boy no problem\" while even Mr Xbox is feeling the strain running it at 30.\n\nI knew the GameCube was a slick bit of kit, but this is just bizarre\n\nDolphin footage is not the most accurate representation of how the game actually ran on real hardware. Looking at actual GCN footage below the framerate is rather inconsistent with some very obvious drops. Pretty obviously using double buffer Vsync so there are some pretty glaring sustained drops to 30fps that can last for seconds at a time. I would personally call the framerate unlocked rather than 60fps.\n\nWhile it is certainly possible that the gamecube version is better optimised and does draw frames faster, it could just as likely be down to different priorities between the two dev studios. EA Redwood may simply have preferred a consistent capped 30fps while Hypnos preferred a faster framerate, consistency be damned. It's hard to say without more data. I would be curious to see how the other versions would run if they were patched to disable the 30fps cap for a proper apples to apples comparison."
