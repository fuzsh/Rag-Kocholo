In the last installment of the movie trilogy, destroy the Ring by casting it into the Crack of Doom, which frees Middle Earth from Dark Lord Sauron.\n\nReturn of the King's third person gameplay allows immersive action set in rich, interactive levels. The new game also features an all new co-op multiplayer mode which lets players form their own Fellowship and eight playable characters like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimil, Sam and Frodo all played out by thier actual actors from the films, battle vicious boss monsters like Shelob and the final showdown with Dark Lord Sauron, all backed up by Academy Award winner Howard Shore.\n\nRTX Remix is a modding platform by NVIDIA, which allows modders to create stunning HD remasters of classic games (see all supported), with ray tracing and DLSS. Playing RTX mods requires a RT capable GPU. Learn more here.\n\nLord of the Rings: The Return of the King's compatibility with RTX Remix is:\n\nStatus: Partially Playable\n\nRTX Remix Runtime Version: 0.4.1\n\nConf File: Download - updated 102d ago\n\nCaptures: 0 captures - add new\n\nAssets: 0 assets - add new\n\nMods: 0 mods - add new\n\nHide: This dialog\n\nAdditional installation instructions:\n\nDownload RTX Remix 0.5.0 from Github.com\n\nPut RTX Remix files to the same directory as ROTK.exe\n\nRename d3d8to9.dll to d3d9.dll\n\nIssues:\n\nEverything works well but there is no lighting (it needs to be placed manually by a mod)\n\nTo edit Remix you need to press Alt+Backspace, also it moves the in-game cursor so you will press things by accident\n\nNotes:\n\nThere is .conf file that should fix most of the UI and makes Gandalf staff emit bright light to make this game playable without any additional mod\n\nDiscord Thread: Discord.com\n\nTested by Raharu 5/2/2024 (RTX Remix 0.5.0)"
