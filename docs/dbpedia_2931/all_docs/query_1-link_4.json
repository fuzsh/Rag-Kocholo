        "text": "This article refers to the video game. For other namesakes, see The Return of the King (disambiguation).\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a 2003 video game based on Peter Jackson's New Line Cinema film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The game was published by Electronic Arts for GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GBA, PC, Mac, and Mobile.\n\nPlayer paths[]\n\nThe game has three \"paths\" to play, which involve different undertakings of the main characters of The Return of the King.\n\nThe Path of the Wizard[]\n\nCharacters\n\nGandalf\n\nLevels\n\nHelm’s Deep\n\nRoad to Isengard\n\nMinas Tirith - Top of the Wall\n\nMinas Tirith - Courtyard\n\nThe Path of the King[]\n\nCharacters\n\nAragorn\n\nLegolas\n\nGimli\n\nLevels\n\nPaths of the Dead\n\nThe King of the Dead\n\nThe Southern Gate\n\nPelennor Fields\n\nThe Black Gate\n\nThe Path of the Hobbits[]\n\nCharacters\n\nFrodo\n\nSam\n\nLevels\n\nEscape from Osgiliath\n\nShelob's Lair\n\nCirith Ungol\n\nCrack of Doom\n\nPlayable characters[]\n\nAragorn\n\nLegolas\n\nGimli\n\nGandalf\n\nSamwise Gamgee\n\nFrodo Baggins\n\nPeregrin Took\n\nMeriadoc Brandybuck\n\nFaramir\n\nBattle rating system / Experience[]\n\nThe game's battle rating system is based on how many hits the player can deal without taking damage. This fills the player's experience bar. Experience decreases whenever the player pauses from fighting. The ratings are as follows:\n\nFair - rusty Uruk-hai helmet\n\nGood - bronze Uruk-hai helmet\n\nExcellent - silver Uruk-Hai helmet\n\nPerfect - gold Uruk-Hai helmet\n\nAt the end of a level the player gets a rating, which is based on the amount of times the player gets the four ratings. According to this rating the player gets an experience bonus. Fair: 1000, Good: 2000, Excellent: 3000 and Perfect: 5000. With this gained experience, certain upgrades can be bought, either for 'the fellowship', meaning all members get this upgrade, or for 'the character', meaning only the current character get it, some upgrades however are some characters only.\n\nFor a list of all the upgrades see: List of upgrades.\n\nBonuses[]\n\nPalantír of Saruman (Bonus level)\n\nPalantír of Sauron (Bonus level) (Must also reach level 10 with Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn or Legolas or Gimli)\n\nSecret codes\n\nDifferences from the book and film[]\n\nHere are listed the differences between the video game, the original book, and Peter Jackson's film. The bold text shows the characters in co-op mode. Once The Crack of Doom is completed, any character can play in any level, co-op mode or not (except Helm's Deep, which isn't available in co-op mode).\n\nLevel Path Book Film Game Helm's Deep\n\nGandalf\n\nNon-Conflicting Non-Conflicting Non-Conflicting Road to Isengard\n\nGandalf\n\nGandalf\n\nA-L-G\n\nFollowing the battles of Isengard and Helm's Deep, Gandalf, A-L-G, Éomer, and Théoden journey to Isengard on horseback, and pick up Merry and Pippin.Non-Conflicting Gandalf comes to Isengard at the end of that battle, alone and on foot.

Both fall off the edge of the Cliff, though Frodo is saved by Sam. Frodo must push Gollum off the cliff in the Crack of Doom in order to get him and the ring into the lava.\n\nLevel summaries[]\n\nPath of the Wizard (Gandalf)[]\n\nHelm's Deep[]\n\nThe player must defeat the Orcs at Helm's Deep. This is a tutorial level, in which the player gets to experiment with the different moves the game has to offer. The level ends when the player destroys a cart of explosives on the causeway with three ballistas, driving the Orcs away from Helm's Deep.\n\nFailure if: (Player cannot fail)\n\nAllies- Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn and the Rohirrim\n\nThe Road to Isengard[]\n\nThe player chases the orcs through Fangorn forest. At one point, the player must help the Ents by killing 75 enemies in order to proceed. After following the path, the player will end up at the Dam of Isengard. The player must then protect the Ent trying to break the dam from the orc archers by killing them and letting the Ent break the dam. The level ends when the dam is destroyed.\n\nFailure if: The player is killed by orcs and dies.\n\nAllies-Ents\n\nMinas Tirith - Top of the Wall[]\n\nThe player must move up and down the walls of Minas Tirith, knocking down siege ladders and killing any enemies at the top of the wall. All the time, he must make sure that the overrun meter is as low as possible, because the player will fail if too many enemies make it on the wall. Occasionally, siege towers will appear, which the player must either fire a catapult at (left-side towers only) or shoot directly. When the player destroys the fourth siege tower (which will land on the wall no matter what), a cut-scene will show trolls using Grond . The level ends when the player makes it down the stairs to the courtyard.\n\nFailure if: The player dies or the wall is overrun.\n\nAllies-Gondorian swordsmen and archers\n\nMinas Tirith - Courtyard[]\n\nThe gates have been breached, and the player must now defeat the waves of enemies coming through the broken gate, with only a few Gondor soldiers to help him. His main objective is to defend the courtyard allowing the gondorian soldiers to escape to safety. . The level ends when 1000 gondorian soldiers have been saved.\n\nFailure if: The player dies.\n\nAllies-Gondorian archers\n\nPath of the King (Aragon, Legolas or Gimli)[]\n\nPaths of the Dead[]\n\nThe player, as either Gandalf, Legolas, or Gimli, must make their way to the very heart of the Dwimorberg mountain through the Paths of the Dead, in order to call the Dead Men of Dunharrow to fight for Gondor. Throughout the paths, they must fight specters that will seek to kill them. There is also a point where the Three Hunters are trapped and must defeat 35 specters before they are able to move on. The level ends when the player makes it to the end of the Paths of the Dead.\n\nFailure if: The player dies.\n\nAllies-Aragorn and / or Legolas and / or Gimli\n\nKing of the Dead[]\n\nThe player must now fight the King of the Dead alone. The King attacks either by a three-strike attack or by calling dead soldiers. After about half of his health has been depleted, he starts to blow powerful wind at the player and his three-strike attack becomes five-strikes. After the King is defeated, the player must escape the collapsing mountain to return to his and defeat any specters in his path.\n\nFailure if: The player dies\n\nAllies-Aragorn and / or Legolas and / or Gimli\n\nThe Southern Gate[]\n\nThe player must get past the Southern gate in order to help the Rohirrim at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Unfortunately, however, he must fight off hundreds of Uruks and orcs that lay in ambush. If you enjoy fighting many enemies, this level is for you. Two trolls also lay in wait. The player must fire three catapults, two at a tower and one at a troll, to get to the top of the gate. After he defeats the troll at the top, he must slay a Mumakil by shooting at four points in its armor and blowing it up. He must then open the gate. The level ends when the player gets through the gate alive.\n\nFailure if: The player dies\n\nAllies-Aragorn and / or Legolas and / or Gimli\n\nPelennor Fields[]\n\nThe player is immediately launched into the full-scale battle fighting several Easterlings and Uruks alongside the Rohirrim. They must battle until 60 enemies have been killed. Then, Merry and Éowyn will join the fight. Mumakil will also enter the battlefield. The player must destroy the Mumakil coming for Éowyn and Merry (the Mumakil will automatically kill them if it gets there, and the mission will fail) by destroying its armor and blowing it up before it is too late. Periodically, the Witch-king will ride down on his Fell Beast to attack Merry and Eowyn. The player must shoot the Witch-king until it flies off. This process will repeat until the Witch-king's Fell Beast is slain. Éowyn will kill him, and the dead will arrive.\n\nFailure if: The player dies or the Witch-king kills Éowyn and Merry or a Mumakil crushes them.\n\nAllies-Aragorn and / or Legolas and / or Gimli\n\nThe Black Gate[]\n\nThere are three parts to this level, separated by checkpoints.\n\nThe level begins with the player facing the Mouth of Sauron who was brandishing Frodo's Mithril shirt. The player then battles to defeat him. After the player slays the Mouth, the progress is saved and the next part begins.\n\nHordes of orcs will erupt from the Black Gate of Mordor. The player must kill every enemy that makes it onto the slag ruins. The objective is to kill six champions, but the enemies will come from the sides as well as the front after three champions have been killed. Once all six champions are defeated, there is a checkpoint and three Ringwriaths appear.\n\nThe Ringwraiths will attempt to kill the player and the members of the Fellowship. The level ends when the three Ringwraiths are slain.\n\nFailure if: The player dies or any other member of the Fellowship dies.\n\nThe Path of the Hobbits (Sam, Frodo)[]\n\nEscape from Osgiliath[]\n\nThe player must make their way through the besieged city of Osgiliath and escape through the sewers. Orcs are everywhere, and the Nazgûl are searching ceaselessly for the Ring. The player must fight their way through Osgiliath, and either take cover or get off the roofs as quickly as possible when the Ringwraiths are searching. The level ends when the player defeats the orc champion stationed near the exit of the sewers, and escapes the city.\n\nFailure if: The player dies or the Nazgûl catch Frodo.\n\nAllies-Frodo, Gollum/Smeagol, Gondor rangers, Gondor swordsmen, Gondor archers\n\nShelob's Lair[]\n\nThis level is separated into three levels, each separated by a checkpoint.\n\nThe first part: The first part is a gigantic maze, with few paths actually leading to the correct location. Though some paths will lead to EXP bonus stones, they also contain spider ambushes. A couple of Orcs also dwell in the lair. The player's basic objective, in this stage, is to make it to a huge arched bridge, where a checkpoint will signal the end.\n\nThe second part: The second part is more straightforward, but harder; there is only one path from this point on, but there are more enemies and more baby spider blockades that need to be separated by a torch. The objective, which is even simpler than the last, is to get out of the lair into a huge rock arena.\n\nThe third part: The player must now fight Shelob. She begins with parry-able thrusts, but will occasionally charge into a corner and summon spiders to attack the player. The only way is to hack at Shelob until she is defeated. Frodo will be taken by two orcs, which ends the level.\n\nFailure if: The player dies\n\nAllies-None\n\nCirith Ungol[]\n\nThe player must fight through many hordes of orcs, who are at war with each other though will focus attention on the player when they spot him (Note: The enemies seem to not actually kill each other, so it is up to the player to do so if they wish to.) The first part of the mission involves killing at least 80 enemies, which can be accomplished through a variety of paths and action sequences. Once this is done, the player must navigate the level until a short scene showing the remaining orcs fleeing to a bridge is shown. After firing a ballista and destroying part of the level, the player must rush across the bridge, beginning the second part of the level (if the player is too slow in getting across the bridge, the player dies.)\n\nThe second part is a short boss battle against Gorbag. Initially, the player cannot damage him, but by using the spears in the room, the player can toss one to break his shield, and another to stun him, during which time his life meter will appear. Note that it is possible to knock him down and use a finishing move, but it will not be an instant kill (it will just deal damage). Once Gorbag is defeated, the level ends.\n\nFailure if: The player dies or the player falls at the bridge leading to the second part of the level.\n\nAllies-None\n\nThe Crack of Doom[]\n\nThis level is basically a boss battle: it's Sam and Frodo against Gollum. Gollum only has melee attacks, but his swipes and jump attack can be quite deadly if unparried. To damage Gollum, the player must lure him to the very edge of the platform, slash him, knock him over with an attack, and finish the combo with a killing move. (Note: This is similar to the Final Judgment move.) The player must use this process a total of six times; each time, additional obstacles like falling rocks and lava oozing on the platform. Once the sixth killing combo has been completed, Gollum falls into the lava and the Ring is destroyed.\n\nFailure if: The player dies\n\nAllies-Sam\n\nPalantir Bonus Levels[]\n\nPalantír of Saruman[]\n\nThere are 20 rounds in this level, with every 5 rounds depicting a random deserted place in Middle-earth. In this level, the player must slay every enemy in each round in order to progress. The enemies are easy at first but get steadily harder, eventually resulting in enemies like Trolls and Champions. The enemies involved are Uruks, Spiders, and Trolls of all varieties (Normal, Shielded, Archer and champion.).\n\nAllies-None\n\nPalantír of Sauron[]\n\nThis level requires lvl 10 for Gandalf, Sam, and either Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli. There are 20 rounds similar to the Palantír of Saruman, but with different Middle-earth locations and harder and more numerous enemies. The difficulty progresses similar to the Palantír of Saruman. The enemies involved are Orcs, Easterlings, Uruks, and Trolls of all varieties.\n\nAllies-None\n\n[]"
