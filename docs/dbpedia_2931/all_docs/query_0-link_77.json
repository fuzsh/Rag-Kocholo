        "text": "Yes, don't overlook older PS4 games, as they upscale and look impressive on the PS5, especially if you're transitioning from a standard PS4 and have a good TV. Games like No Man’s Sky and the God of War Ragnarok look impressive on the PS5. Additionally, some PS4 versions of games with distinct PS5 versions can be updated to the PS5 version for free.\n\nAt JB, we’re at the frontlines of the latest PS5 game releases. Here are some of the newest additions to our PS5 game collection:\n\nAssassin’s Creed Mirage: It’s the 13th major installment in the Assassin’s Creed series and follows the journey of Basim Ibn Shaq as he transitions from a street thief to a member of the Assassin Brotherhood.\n\nEA Sports FC24: A rebranding of the FIFA series, it offers an overhauled Ultimate Team and a slower, more precise gameplay pace.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender: Quest For Balance: An interesting twist in this game is that the events are told through the eyes of the Order of the White Lotus, allowing players to experience Aang's story from their point of view.\n\nSUPER BOMBERMAN R 2: A giant robotic black moon ruled by a new species threatens to destroy Planet Bomber. The 8 Bomberman Bros, along with their new allies, must team up to confront the new monsters and their leader.\n\nMortal Kombat 1: Introducing a reborn Mortal Kombat universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang, it features a new fighting system, various game modes, and fatalities, redefining the fighting experience for avid Mortal Kombat players."
