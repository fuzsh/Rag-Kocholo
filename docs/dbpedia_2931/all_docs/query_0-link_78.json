        "text": "Game Pass Ultimate members automatically receive the entitlement for EA Play on console and can browse and download games through the Game Pass experience on your console.\n\nTo get started on PC, Ultimate and PC Game Pass members will first need to link their Xbox and EA accounts and make sure they have the EA app installed on their PC. The Xbox app for Windows PC will walk you through the setup process.\n\nIf you have played an EA Play game on your console, your Xbox and EA accounts are likely linked, so you should ensure you sign in to the Xbox app for Windows PC with that same Xbox account you use for console.\n\nOnce you have installed the EA app and link your accounts you will be able to browse the EA Play catalog and download games through the Xbox app for Windows PC via the EA app.\n\nIf you are having trouble with linking your Xbox and EA accounts, you can find additional support here.\n\nThe recurring billing feature is switched on by default, meaning you'll automatically pay for a new subscription period when your current period ends.\n\nYou can switch recurring billing off and back on through your Microsoft account or from your console. Learn more about stopping recurring billing at Microsoft Support.\n\nIf you did not want to be charged for recurring billing, but failed to switch off recurring billing before your payment was processed, youâ€™re still entitled to a refund of your most recent recurring billing charge if you cancel your subscription within 30 days after payment. This refund right is limited to one time per Microsoft account, per subscription product. You can submit such a refund request to our Support team: Request a refund."
