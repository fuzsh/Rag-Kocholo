        "text": "Get ready to return to Middle-earth, when Season 2 of Prime Video’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power makes its debut on August 29 in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. The series picks up J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic fantasy saga in a new age, set thousands of years before the story chronicled in Tolkien’s original The Hobbit novel and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nRead on to learn more about the cast, the creative direction, and, most importantly, how, where, and when you can watch.\n\nWhere to watch ‘The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’ Season 2?\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is available exclusively on Prime Video. If you’re a Prime member, log in to your account to watch on Prime Video, free with your membership. If you’re not a Prime Member yet, learn more about the benefits and find out how you can sign up.\n\nWhen does Season 2 come out?\n\nSeason 2 of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power will premiere on August 29, 2024, on Prime Video. The first season is available to stream now on Prime Video.\n\nHow many episodes are in ‘The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’ Season 2?\n\nThere are eight episodes in Season 2, matching the same episode count as Season 1.\n\nWhat is 'The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power' Season 2 about?\n\nThe series brings the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history to screens. This epic drama takes viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness.\n\nBeginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared reemergence of evil returning to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.\n\nSeason 2 comes in the wake of the three Elven rings being forged, and the introduction of legendary Tolkien villain Sauron. The Middle-earth heroes will also be facing a variety of terrifying creatures in Season 2, including the undead Barrow-wights (who are described as “ancient, reanimated heroes, acting for evil against their will”), a Hill-troll, and a returning sea creature that was first seen in Season 1. The second season will also introduce The Lord of the Rings saga character Tom Bombadil for the first time in live action, played by Rory Kinnear.\n\nWhat happened at the end of ‘The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’ Season 1?\n\nThe brooding, mysterious character Halbrand was revealed to be none other than legendary The Lord of the Rings villain Sauron (who transforms himself into yet another guise in Season 2, the beautiful and enigmatic Annatar, who claims to be an emissary of the gods in his attempt to manipulate the master elven smith Celebrimbor to forge more Rings of Power). Meanwhile, the Elven leaders used the small amount of mithril they acquired from the dwarves to forge the three Elven rings of power. The legendary dark land of Mordor was also born, with the eruption of a volcano to rain down smoke and ash.\n\nDo you need to watch the movies or read the books in order to understand the series?\n\nThe series is set thousands of years before the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, so audiences new to the franchise do not have to watch the movies or read the books to understand the series. Familiarity with the source material might help viewers spot extra references along the way, but the series itself fully stands on its own as an epic fantasy saga.\n\nWhere was 'The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power' filmed?\n\nSeason 2 of the Prime Video series was filmed in the United Kingdom, while Season 1 was filmed in New Zealand.\n\nWhich well-known characters show up in the series?\n\nThere are several familiar characters from Tolkien lore in the series, including Galadriel, Elrond, Sauron, Isildur, Durin IV, High King Gil-galad, and more. Season 2 will introduce Tom Bombadil for the first time in live action.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nNew additions to the cast for Season 2 include Ciarán Hinds, Rory Kinnear, Tanya Moodie, Gabriel, Akuwudike, Yasen “Zates” Atour, Ben Daniels, Sam Hazeldine, Amelia Kenworthy, Nia Towle, Nicholas Woodeson, Oliver Alvin-Wilson, Stuart Bowman, Calam Lynch, William Chubb, Kevin Eldon, Will Keen, Selina Lo, and Gavi Singh Chera.\n\nThe cast for Season 1 included: Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Robert Aramayo, Owain Arthur, Maxim Baldry, Ian Blackburn, Nazanin Boniadi, Beau Cassidy, Kip Chapman, Morfydd Clark, Anthony Crum, Ismael Cruz Córdova, Maxine Cunliffe, Charles Edwards, Will Fletcher, Trystan Gravelle, Lenny Henry, Ema Horvath, Thusitha Jayasundera, Markella Kavenagh, Joseph Mawle, Simon Merrells, Fabian McCallum, Geoff Morrell, Tyroe Muhafidin, Peter Mullan, Sophia Nomvete, Lloyd Owen, Augustus Prew, Megan Richards, Dylan Smith, Peter Tait, Alex Tarrant, Charlie Vickers, Amelie Child-Villiers, Leon Wadham, Benjamin Walker, Daniel Weyman, and Sara Zwangobani.\n\nNext up, check out the exciting teaser trailer for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Season 2, as it foreshadows that “an evil—ancient and powerful—has returned.”"
