The Lord of the Rings, a legendary franchise inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien's book series, has left an indelible mark across various forms of media, including movies, TV shows, and video games. Tolkien's extraordinary storytelling began with his books, igniting a passionate fan base and eventually becoming a timeless classic. In my view, The Lord of the Rings (LotR) is the cornerstone of the fantasy genre's modern popularity. It laid the foundation for today's iconic works, such as Game of Thrones, tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, and video game series like The Elder Scrolls. I believe that much of this diverse content owes its existence to The Lord of the Rings.

The world of LotR is brimming with rich lore and a multitude of characters, many of whom remain undiscovered by those who don't immerse themselves deeply into the franchise. Aside from television shows and movies, one of the most effective ways to capture people's interest and introduce them to these captivating characters is through video games. Throughout the years, we've seen a variety of LotR games, with some being exceptional and others not quite hitting the mark. These games span the spectrum, from lighthearted Lego adaptations to epic adventure experiences

My personal experience with LotR has always been incredibly positive. As a child, I read books and fell in love with the intricate world Tolkien had crafted. Shortly thereafter, I watched the movies and was equally captivated. However, a pivotal moment came when I got my first PlayStation 2 and played The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I was truly astounded by how a book and movie could be translated into a game of such high quality.

Fast forward to 2014, and Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor entered the scene, leaving me utterly speechless. It rapidly became one of my all-time favorite games. And just when I thought they couldn't surpass the brilliance of Shadow of Mordor, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War was released. The LotR franchise was at its peak. However, it's disheartening to note that at some point, a decision was made by unknown individuals that LotR had reached its zenith and needed to take a nosedive.

I want to be clear, there's a ton of LotR content out there, and not all of it is great. However, it's particularly disheartening when two games released in 2023 end up being such letdowns. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a game that wasn't in high demand and has received widespread criticism. I gave it a shot because I was intrigued by the idea of exploring more of the backstory of such a fascinating character, but it turned out to be a major disappointment. On the other hand, The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria had a much more promising concept with great potential, but that potential was squandered, resulting in a tedious and uninspiring survival game.

I do acknowledge that it's only two games, and previous LotR games have not necessarily set them up for failure. It's clear that the LotR gaming universe will continue to expand, and I hope that whoever takes on the franchise in the future will approach it with the care and attention it deserves. With such a rich lore and abundant content, there's no shortage of material to create captivating experiences. Good luck to the next one.
