Based on Peter Jackson's movies[edit | edit source]

14 games are based on the books only (see: The Lord of the Rings), and 20 games are based on the six movies by Peter Jackson.

In the table below, the "Systems" column is limited to two lines; this is to avoid cluttering with too many region-specific or country-specific ports. Such detailed information is left to game-specific guides.

The "N." column specifies which movie each video game is based upon (try and sort by it). "321" means that a game is based on events of the full trilogy; an empty cell means that the game tells an original story inspired by the movies.
