November 6, 1915 •THE .MOVING; fICTURR, WORLD .1059 Poe Brought to Life Through Genius of Henry B. Walthall No tragedy sears the soul of man as the loss of the woman he loves. Edgar Allan Poe, in the death of his wife, drained to the lees the cup of sorrow. To his grief was the added sting of death by cold and starvation. Through night's long hours he knelt by her body in a bare, wind-swept room, his spirit broken, his soul tasting the dregs of uttermost despair. Out of heart-rending tragedy his genius spoke in \"The Raven.\" He probed to the depths those unfathomable mysteries of life. He pictured the greatest happiness that comes to man — Love, and the greatest desolation — 'Death. This is why \"The -Raven\" strikes straight to the heart. Henry B. Walthall, the image of Poe, a man of the same mold and temperament, who * thinks and feels as did Poe, interprets America's greatest poet as no other living being could. His genius sparkles on the screen as did Poe's in literature. He gives to the world a living Poe, the Poe of Love and Song, the Poe of Hope and Happiness, the Poe of Desolation and Despair. This great presentation is embodied in Essanay's six-act photoplay, de- picting the life of Poe, as written by George C. Hazel ton and di- rected, by Charles J. Brabin. Mr. Walthall is -ably supported by - Warda Howard and an 'all star cast. Trademark Reg. U. 5. Fat. 1M7 1333 Argyle Street, Chicago George K.

War- ren KERRIGAN in a superb 3 weeks' series serial, being his \"New Adventures of Terence O'Rourke.\" If ever there was a chance to \"Clean up\" here it is. Kerrigan in this new nov- elty 3 weeks' series serial is our answer to the big demand for this popular star in a serial. It will be re- leased immediately following the last episode of \"The Broken Coin.\" Con- sidering the star J. War- ren Kerrigan — the author of the stories, Louis Jo- seph Vance — the director, Otis Turner — the lavish settings and huge pro- duction expenses, this se- rial stands without ques- tion as the biggest money getting attraction of the year.

In addition — Probably you've heard of B. S. Moss, of the Regent, Hamilton, Jefferson, and Eighty-sixth Street Theatres in New York City. You couldn't sell Moss a pig in a poke. You couldn't pass a coun- terfeit promise on him. He buys with his eyes open every time. Moss comes across with more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars a year for TRIANGLE PLAYS. And then there's Picker and Bennett in the Bronx. They have the Burland Theatre. They know plays when they see them — and they saw the TRIANGLE product at the Knickerbocker Theatre. They came right in and signed up. They'll pay consid- erably more than Thirty Thousand Dollars a year into the TRIANGLE strongbox. You could pay three Cabinet Officers in Washington with that. A lot of you know Shakman, of the Eighty-first Street Theatre in New York. Shakman is proud of his theatre, and he wants the best — so he's paying the stipend of another three Cabinet Officers —well over Thirty Thousand— to get TRIANGLE PLAYS. Moss — Picker & Bennett — Shakman — have reasons that have led them thus far — good reasons, and every one of them is a TRIANGLE reason. What kind of reasons have you? TRIANGLE!

Realizing a false impression has been created we hasten to assure the trade that, contrary to precedent, the Raver-Thomas productions will not be sold until fully completed and offered for review and criticism by the press. By this method, both buyer, renter and exhibitor may determine the importance of a Raver offering without being obliged to make a blind investment as has been the custom in the past. Fully appreciating the keen interest shown by the flattering overtures already made, we prefer, however, to abide by our original policy. HARRY R.

Her wonderful acting and histrionic interpretations. What makes her debut on the screen the most important event in the history of motion pictures? Because it is the first imperishable record of Farrar's art adapted to a medium (motion pictures) understood by and within the reach of every one of 100,000,000 people in the United States. What is the significance of Farrar's appearance in a pro- duction of the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company?

To attain atmosphere nothing is allowed to stand in the way. If it exists — or even is believed to exist — in Texas, Alaska, the West Indies, Martinique — an entire company is sent to get it, and the big burden of expense cheerfully assumed. Is a single railroad scene needed? All right! It's had; and here's the bill: $558.35 for nine cars' for forty-five miles. IF the proper setting can't be found, or can't be found easily, it is built.

This editorial comment appeared in the MOTION PICTURE NEWS last week, and was based on an article appearing in the NEW YORK TIMES, Sunday, October 17th, which occupied over a column of space and told of the tremendous efforts of the Equitable to secure local color and atmosphere in order that TECHNICALLY PERFECT PICTURES could be produced. SEVEN EQUITABLE DIRECTORS ARE NOW AT DISTANT POINTS STAGING THEIR PRODUCTIONS. Charles Seay directing Webster Cullison directing KATHARINE KAELRED \"IDOLS\" is at Martinique in the French West Indies, on the edges of Mont Pelee. Marshall Farnum directing ALEXANDRA GARLISLE \"CREEPING TIDES\" is working four thousand feet under-ground in the famous Braddock Mines, to secure proper detail for his production. Joseph Golden directing CHARLES J. ROSS \"THE SENATOR\" has been working three weeks in Washington, D. C. with the massive Federal buildings as scenic settings for his powerful political story. Harry Pollard directing MARGARITA FISCHER \"THE DRAGON\" will stage his production in the everglades of Florida. MURIEL OSTRICHE in \"A DAUGHTER OF THE SEA\" has been at Block Island a month, in the midst of rare and real fisher folk and marine atmosphere. E. Mason Hopper directing GAIL KANE in \"THE LABYRINTH\" is at Cienf uegos, Cuba, where in the warm glow of the tropical sun, he is gathering punch after punch. John Ince directing WILLIAM COURTENAY in \"GREATER LOVE\" engaged a seven story house adjoining the Hudson Theatre where Mr. Courtenay is appearing in \"Under Fire\" — in order that his star could work every moment and not worry over getting to his legitimate engagement each day.

(The Index for this issue will be found on page 1212) Entered at the General Post Office, New York City, as Second Class Matter Saturday, November 6, 1915 Facts and Comments The Moving Picture World sincerely deplores the lack of harmony in the ranks of Ohio's organized exhibitors. In Ohio, above all other states, the exhibitors ought to be united. Cen- sorship is an evil which cannot be fought successfully except by a united exhibiting body. Any question of petty personal pride ought not be allowed to interfere with the promotion of the general welfare. Ohio must purge itself of the disgrace of censorship. We feel that it is not necessary to apportion the blame. We only hope that common sense and common interests will result in reasonable concessions on both sides and in a perfect union of all interests. * * * AN editorial writer in one of the daily papers in this city prophesies that there will never be \"a Shakespeare of the (venia sit verbo) movies.\" Of course not, there could not be. In the development of the photodrama, however, we hope to attain great heights in the future and we have no doubt that the world will sooner or later hear from a dramatic genius whose fame will rest on the works of the screen. * * * IN SEVERAL cities there have recently been special children's performances under the auspices of the superintendents of schools. Programs were select- ed by the school authorities, consisting in the main of educational subjects and a sprinkling of comedy. Most of these performances took place in the morning and in theaters of large seating capacity. Of course, these performances are a great aid to the pupils in theit various courses of education. They have an additional value to the industry at large through the advertising they invariably get in the daily press. It is well from time to time to emphasize to the general public the educational value of the motion picture. It helps in every campaign against censorship. OUR distinguished friend, William A. Brady, cries out in despair and urges the American people generally to \"save\" the drama from the motion pictures. \"Who will save her\" — that's the question and the circumambient air wafts back no cheering response. \"What are moving pictures?\" shrilly asks Brother Brady. And then he furnishes his own despairing answer. \"The rehashing of every old situation the drama has ever known. If pictures go on as they have been going it will mean the death of the spoken drama.\" It is inconceivable that the spoken drama will ever approach the motion picture in popularity and in in- fluence and it is equally inconceivable that man's ap- preciation for the spoken drama will ever die out. If moving pictures are nothing but the \"rehashing of every old situation the drama has ever known,\" Mr. Brady is in a peculiarly happy position to find a rem- edy. * * * EXHIBITORS who take an active and intelligent interest in the civic life of their community not only benefit themselves but are a distinct gain and advantage to the whole business. We have re- cently met a number of such exhibitors and we have noticed that the motion picture in their towns is re- spected and quite exempt from political persecution either in the shape of meddling censorship or oppres- sive regulations. Exhibitors as a rule are busy men, but participation in the affairs of their town or city pays as an investment. Even a passive membership in the social and civic clubs of the home town will be found highly useful and profitable. * * * MANY exhibitors tell us that they are constantly asked by friends who have a little money to invest as to the chances of speculating in mo- tion pictures or in other words in buying stock. Stock selling schemes with a moving picture basis are spring- ing up in even the remotest corners of the country. These exhibitors will do well in declining to give ad- vice. An era of speculation is not likely to do the mo- tion picture much good. * * * THE ATTENTION of our readers is once more respectfully called to notices on Page 762 of our issue dated October 30 and on Page 1054 of issue dated October 30a. This issue bears date of November 6, but carries all the advance information that would be in our issue dated November 13 under the old plan and is being mailed two days earlier in the week. We believe this new arrangement will benefit all readers and sub- scribers. 1106 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD The American Hamlet November 6, 1915 By Louis Reeves Harrison. HOW much of Shakespeare lives for us ? Whatever his theme, whether he depicted madness, de- spair, jealousy, revenge, it matters little in com- parison with his marvelous idealizations of human character. These great idealizations, Hamlet, Othello, Shylock and the rest are burned into the memory of many millions who know very little about the plays themselves. The people of his fancy mean something. They are types. They represent dominating or thwart- ing impulses, drawn from the Bard's comprehensive observation of human nature as revealed in his time and in himself. Of all these, Hamlet remains the most fascinating, possibly because he is each one of us as we do not know ourselves or, more likely, as we do not want others to know us. Commonly, and quite naturally, we ascribe to our heroes the virtues we admire but do not possess, at least not so markedly as to attract general attention. We portray them as men of courage, decision, strength and tremendous energy. Difficulties are only placed in the hero's way to be overcome. He may even ex- hibit weakness at the beginning, such as the cowardice ' of inexperience, but he ultimately triumphs as we would like to do under similar circumstances. Thus the insistence on a happy ending often becomes the deadly enemy of truth. Just for the sake of variety it might not be out of place to lay bare the human soul as we secretly recognize it, a composite of aspiration and self-doubt. Perhaps the reason that there has never been a great novel distinctly American is because our authors are given to the portrayal of the hero that should be and dare not let us see themselves as they really are, dare not wound their own self-respect. Dissimulation is so nearly universal, every man pretending to be what lie is not, that the world's real nobleman is he who sin- cerely and openly admits his faults; but where is he? Diogenes has been vainly searching for him these many centuries. We are even hypocritical about the nat- ural kindness of our hearts at times. We openly laugh at the low comedy, yet, when our sympathies are touched by a tender bit of pathos, we are ashamed to shed tears. There are recompenses in egotism. The man who thinks he is all that he should be. disagreeable as he may prove to others, is a source of tremendous satis- faction to himself, but he is no Hamlet. \"I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious,\" says the noble Dane, \"with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.\" The mind that framed Hamlet's ut- terance had grown to deep self-knowledge. Resent- ing injustice, sensitive to slights, wounded by the ma- licious envy of the less capable, Shakespeare may have tormented himself with futile schemes of revenge and then realized the pitiful weakness of such moments. \"What should such fellows as I do, crawling between heaven and earth?\" So with the noblest minds ! Ever reaching upward to the unattainable, ever conscious of that too solid flesh which refuses to \"melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew,\" the few great men on whom the world must depend for progress are often those most pain- fully conscious of their imperfections. They live in •Copyright, Louis Reeves Harrison. dread of their frailties, recognizing them as so many secret enemies, and they brood long before undertaking this or that tremendous enterprise, where less intel- lectual men would not hesitate. In the Hamlets of our own day is lying fallow some of the richest mate- rial for dramatic characterization. Is there such a thing as an American Hamlet? An author who confuses the inheritance of physical traits with the formation of character might ask if there is such a thing as an American. One has already done so in stating that we are descendants of Europe, \"we have her traditions in our blood, and are made up of the same mental ingredients.\" \"Traditions in the blood\" are unknown to science, but there is small doubt that we have much in common with our European friends so far as what is known as \"human nature\" is concerned. We may be as avaricious as they are, but we spend more liberally. More splendid public insti- tutions are endowed by wealthy men in this country than in all Europe combined. Few national contribu- tions have come to us from the old country in our acute moments of suffering, yet we have ever been the first to give generously to those in need abroad. We are for America first, last and all the time, and may seem to be as ingenuously selfish as other nations in that respect, but the sentiment is not a surface one — there are big and sound principles underneath. Our strength as a nation lies in the maintenance of all that is just and right in those principles, it is true, but even more than that — we have become a dominant civilizing force and should exercise the native energy of which we are so proud, not for the defense of this or that gov- ernment, but for the people of less advanced forms of government against the brutal cliques, with traditions that are not in our blood, who are urging kind-hearted and well-meaning \"subjects\" to mutilate and destroy one another. If we would destroy the greatest evil the world has ever known, we must hit straight at the root of it and HIT HARD. The reason we do not is to be found in Hamlets' character. If it were possible to embody in one individual our national characteristics, our strong points and our weaknesses, we might therefrom evolve the American Hamlet. It is known that we are capable of tremen- dous energy, but that is supposed to be in chasing the almighty dollar. Wherein that is an American pecu- liarity any one who has traveled abroad would find it difficult to decide. Some Europeans even make war for the indemnity there is in it. Our attitude toward the foreign nations at war may give us a clearer view of ourselves than we at first realize. In trying to be intellectually fair to all, we are show- ing little of the high spirit and passionate resolution of those splendid Americans of more than a centurv ago, who made it possible for us to enjoy peace and happiness at this moment. We talk of the war as though those men were seeking it who are giving up all they hold dear in a magnificent struggle for human liberty. We do not seem to realize that they are fighting for the principles that make our own survival possible. We have Hamlet's recoil from bloodshed, an intellectual tendency to talk about it a great deal, combined with a supreme inability to make up our own minds as to exactly what we should do. Is it possible that a tendency toward philosophy is weaning us from our heart promptings, making us a race of Hamlets? November 6, 1915 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD 1107 More Harmony Needed By W. Stephen Bush. NO AMOUNT of discouragement will ever prevent The Moving Picture World from championing the cause of the organized exhibitor. In lending our influence to the cause of organization we only follow the traditions of the paper and the principles and policies of the founder. It is undeniably true that the cause of organization has made slow progress. The ideal organization containing as members more than fifty per cent, of the exhibiting body in any given locality is far from realization. The greatest obstacle in the way of an efficient and rep- resentative organization is the petty jealousy which too often characterizes the conduct of one exhibitor toward his colleague. On my recent travels through the state of New York this fact was again impressed on me with pain- ful clearness. There are exceptions, heaven be praised. In one city at least the exhibitors work together like one man and in other cities there are exhibitors who are capa- ble of distinguishing between fair and unfair competi- tion. As a rule, however, there is a deplorable lack of co-op- eration and in many cases a rancorous hatred of the near- est competitor or competitors. Men of good intelligence with engaging manners and an obvious sense of what is due to their neighbor lose all reasoning power when the conversation gets around to the nearest competitor. Ac- cording to their description the nearest competitor is a tiend incarnate, a being deserted of God and man, guilty of daily atrocities and wholly unfit to associate with his kind. When I meet the man thus described as the em- bodiment of every villainy I find him just about the same as the other fellow, eager for profit, of course, but rea- sonable and capable of seeing more than his own side of a question. He reciprocates the horrible opinion of the man down the street and doesn't need much provocation to launch into fierce denunciation of his rival, most of which is wholly unprintable. I can suggest no remedy except an appeal to reason. In every town with more than one exhibitor there is a com- munity of interest embracing all the exhibitors. What- ever hurts one is bound to hurt all. It is better to make a reasonable division of patronage with a field left for competition than to exhaust one's own resources in an effort to crush the other fellow. In one town I found a small theater actually admitting people free of charge and showing quite a decent program, too. This was done to cut down the attendance of a neighboring theater with about four times the seating capacity. My readers are too intelligent to need any comment of mine on such a situation. I knew an exchange in Philadelphia which owed no small measure of its success to its specialty of making the exhibitor see the folly of ruinous competition. A man would come into the manager's office bitterly complaining of his nearest competitor. Remember that this happened in the days when there was not one fourth of the present weekly supply of reels. The man was told to forget his troubles for the present and then the nearest competitor was sent for. He, too, was made to see the error of his ways. When reason had been restored to both men and it seemed safe to have them meet without danger of phys- ical violence the two men were brought together and an amicable arrangement was made between them, \"one being kept away from the other's program without any 're- peaters.' \" We sincerely believe it would be for the best interests of the industry as a whole if the exhibitor had a little more power and influence than he has now. It is very certain that he will never be much more than \"a hewer of stone and a drawer of water\" if he cannot get the petty jealousies out of his system. Happy Ending By W. Stephen Bush. I AM sure every reader of The Moviing Picture World feels himself competent to contribute an in- teresting view on the question of how a film play ought to end. Guided by what I have heard from exhibitors everywhere I am inclined to think that they all favor the happy endings. Of course when I say this I do not mean to state the personal view and taste of the exhibitor him- self. What the exhibitor personally likes or dislikes is one thing and what his audience likes or dislikes are two essentially different things. The exhibitor, of course, cannot afford to have pictures just for the gratification of his own tastes. He must sacrifice his tastes upon the altar of profit. When he hears his audience enthuse over a feature which he thinks particularly bad it is his cue to smile and agree with his audience. The consensus of the exhibitors in favor of happy end- ings represents the tastes and desires of the millions who go to see the motion pictures day after day. The demand for the happy ending is one of the dis- tinct lines of difference between the best traditions of the speaking stage and the screen. The plays without a happy ending have endured longer on the legitimate stage than the other kind, where the wedding bells ring out in the fifth act and the villain is led in handcuffs from the stage. This is especially true of what we may term the classic plays. With one or two exceptions the comedies of Shake- speare have been seen but little on the modern stage while the fame of the great tragedies still touches every house- hold in the English-speaking world. Who at a second's notice can recall the principal characters in the \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" ? It is much easier for the average person to recall the leading parts in \"Macbeth,\" \"Hamlet\" and \"Othello.\" Most of us I think still prefer \"Romeo and Juliet\" to the works of Laura Jean Libbey, and Laura Jean Libbey is one of the most conspicuous ex- ponents of the happy ending. Granting all this I must agree with the exhibitors' pre- vailing opinion that their audiences must have happy end- ings. Indeed some of the endings are altogether too happy. I saw a feature recently where a man shares the guilt of the deaths of hundreds of men, women and chil- dren and gets off with a slight wound in the arm with the finale showing him and the wife in happy seclusion on the porch of their Staten Island home. Yes, we do strain things a bit to get the happy ending. We all know that the happy ending is not always true to the life we are sup- posed to reflect on the screen. Just the same the audiences will have the happy ending. Except to a negligible minority the motion picture theater is a place of amusement, first, last and all the time. \"Weeps\" may be part of the entertainment, there is a fine place for them toward the end of the third act, but our audiences want to see everybody happy by the time the film is getting small on the fifth reel. Why sh )uld the exhibitor quarrel with this state of affairs? We cannot end the tale of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" with the wolf triumphant and digesting the little heroine. 1108 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD November 6, 1915 Rex E. Beach. Cameras to Explore Tropical Wilds Edward A. Salisbury and Rex Beach Head Finely Equipped Expedition to Central and South America. ONE of the best equipped motion picture expeditions ever organized sailed from New York last week in the yacht Wisdom. In charge of the party was Edward A. Salisbury, the man whose pictures of wild life already are known to lovers of motion pictures. Associated with him is Rex E. Beach, the famous writer of fiction, some of whose stories are already as familiar to picturegoers as all of them are to followers of current fic- tion. Others in the party are George Stone, microscopic camera ex- p e r t and scientist; Charles E. Earle, scientist and navigator; L. B. Flintom, son of the head of the Kansas City Feature Film Ex- change, and Charles C. Dahl, cameraman. Captain Thomas Flem- ing Day is skipper of the Wisdom. Captain Day has crossed the Atlantic in a twenty- one-footer and in a thirty-five-footer. That ought to establish his reputation as a sailor. On Wednesday afternoon Mr. Salisbury and Mr. Beach were photographed by the Pathe and Hearst-Selig camera- men. Mrs. Beach, who was visiting the Wisdom, lying off Eighty-sixth street, North River, was induced to join the two explorers in facing the cameras, protesting all the while. \"I'd rather go to the dentist than have my picture taken,\" she said. \"Why not ask Mary Pickford?\" Later the Wisdom took a turn up the river, that the photographer sta- tioned at the end of a pier might get a good picture of the trim craft that will serve as the home of the explorers for the next half year. The Wisdom is 72 feet long and 14 feet beam, with a draught of about 6 feet. She is equipped with a gaso- line engine of 50 horse- power. Her normal cruising speed is 10 knots. She carries launches with indepen- dent motive power, as well as a rowboat and a canoe. There is a complete dark-room equipment and an ice- making plant. In the main cabin is a large air-tight zinc-lined box for the storage of film. Packed in its walls is lime, intended to ab- sorb moisture. Boards projecting over the side convert the film box into a center reading table. The itinerary of the party as at present outlined — and Mr. Salisbury said that it would, of course, be subject to such changes as circumstances might dictate — calls for visits in Florida, a tour through the Bahamas, touching at Kingston, Jamaica, and Haiti, and down the Central American and Venezuelan coasts. The course of the Wisdom then will be retraced to Colon and through the Panama Canal, south along the Mexican, Central and South American coasts and then north along shore to San Francisco. The journey as outlined will approximate a distance of ten thousand miles and will consume in time from six to ten months to ac- complish. Thirty thousand feet of negative was on board the Wisdom when she sailed from New York, and an additional twenty Edward A. Salisbury. thousand will be shipped to Panama. As to the pictures to be taken, these will include everything of interest — wild life, scenic, hunting and fishing, natural life, and popular science, comprising microscopic studies. It was said by Mr. Salisbury that locations might suggest to Mr. Beach stories of a dramatic sort that would be enacted by the mem- bers of the party. When the novelist was asked in regard to this he was inclined to be noncommittal; he did not ad- mit nor did he deny it. One of the points visited will be Cocos Island, the Treasure Island of famous memory; Mr. Yacht Wisdom Coming Out of Dry Dock. Salisbury intimated the pictures taken here would not be limited to scenic. A stop will be made at the bird rookeries of Tiburon, off the west coast of Mexico. Here also pictures will be made of the cannibal tribes, the only known remaining survivors in or near North America of this rapidly becoming extinct division of humanity. It is not the intention of the explorers to confine their activities to the water. Trips will be made inland wherever it is desired to obtain subjects of unusual interest. In this way the party will cover the old Spanish cities and the capitals, as well as obtaining pictures of the natives and of jungle life. Mr. Salisbury, the owner of the Wisdom, will be the head of the party. Mr. Beach, as his books bear witness, is a lover of outdoor life, of hunting, of fishing and of adventure. He has traveled and hunted much in wild countries, in the north as well as in the tropics. We have a right to ex- pect that from his experiences on the trip there will come results matching in interest for fiction readers and picture- goers \"The Spoilers,\" just to name one subject. Like Mr. Salisbury, Mr. Beach is of powerful physique. Mr. Stone is a graduate of the University of California. He has specialized in microcinematography. So far as known he is the only man in the United States who has achieved success in this work. He carried with him a complete equip- ment of cameras and lenses. Included in the photographic paraphernalia on the Wisdom are four motion picture cameras. Mr. Earle is a graduate of Harvard, and has spe- cialized in chemistry. William Salisbury, a brother of the head of the expedition, accompanied the party to Norfolk, at which point Mr. Beach went aboard. It is a congenial bunch the Wisdom takes with her on her long trip — as should be a group of ten men who for so long a time will be in such close contact. Talking with them just before their departure it was impossible to smother a bad case of wanderlust. Bon voyage to the good ship Wisdom and her splendid crew! HARRY VOKES MAKING A COMEDY FOR GAUMONT In pursuance of its policy to give the public a new star with each Gaumont production. Harry Yokes is now at work at the Flushing studio on a Casino Star Comedy to be re- leased under the name of \"Beauty in Distress.\" Mr. Vokes was for years a co-star with \"Hap\" Ward. Probably no team in America has made more people laugh than Ward & Vokes. ALBERT MACKLIN BECOMES GAUMONT JUVENILE Albert Macklin, well known in pictures as a juvenile actor, sailed Tuesday, October 26, with the Gaumont companies, to spend the winter in Florida. He will appear in the Rialto Star Features photodramas. November 6, 1915 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD 1109 Bunch of Vitagraphs Coming Many Good Subjects in Proposed Releases of Early Date. THE Vitagraph Company, ever on the alert to keep abreast of the demands of the exhibitors and their growing patronage, have arranged a weekly program, beginning with the first week in November, to include a series of releases each one of which will be a representative Vita- graph picture, whether it be a one-part subject or a feature. Twenty-four of the Vitagraph stars are represented in the Scene from \"Between Two Fires\" (Vitagraph). first week's releases, who worked under the direction of seven different directors to make the separate stories. The first of the quality releases will be \"Between Two Fires,\" in which two maiden ladies living one on each side of a bachelor, conspire individually to capture him in the matrimonial net and the ruse employed by the victim to circumvent their designs. It was directed by Courtland Van Deusen, with the assistance of Flora Finch, Kate Price and William Shea, in its enactment. The second release of the week will be \"The Sultan of Zulon,\" a two-part comedy by William Calvert Howard, pro- duced by Wally Van. It tells in amusing manner the adven- ture of Ram Si Ko, in his search of a white wife to add to his already overstocked harem. Hughie Mack is the Sultan, while Dorothy Kelly and Donald MacBride assist him in creating the fun. Following \"The Sultan of Zulon\" will be a Frederic Chapin comedy, \"A Family Picnic,\" in which a Great Dane Scene from \"Beautiful Thoughts\" (Vitagraph). proves to be a white elephant on the hands of a picnic party. Kate Price, Ethel Corcoran, Donald MacBride and Paul Kelly are the comedians responsible for the comedy's suc- cess. A star cast of Vitagraph players selected from the West- ern company at Los Angeles, Cal., enacted the release for Thursday, \"The Ebony Casket.\" It is a story in which an ebony casket containing a stuffed cat helps a pair of lovers to overcome parental objection. William Duncan, Anne Schaefer, Myrtle Gonzales, Alfred Vosburgh, George Kun- kel, Otto Lederer, Carleton Weatherby and George Stanley are the principals concerned in its enactment. Eva and Stanley Dark are the authors of the regular \"Sid- ney Drew Day\" release. \"Beautiful Thoughts,\" in which Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew appear to exceptional advantage. Its theme is woven around the tenets of the \"Beautiful Thought- ist\" and the story develops into the means employed by a husband, a perpetual grouch, to drive the beautiful thoughts out of his wife's head. Florence Natol is the third member of the cast that presents this delightful comedy. A Broadway Star Feature, \"Anselo Lee,\" a stirring picture of Gypsy life, interwoven with a romance, into which a so- ciety girl is the beloved of a Gypsy Adonis, is the first Sat- urday release of the month. It was enacted by a cast of Vitagraph players that include Antonio Moreno, Naomi Childers, Donald Hall, Frankie Mann and Nellie Anderson, who worked under the direction of Harry Handworth. The above series of releases for the first week in Novem- ber is only a forerunner of what the Vitagraph Company promise in the succeeding weekly program, and to further es- tablish Vitagraph as a name that spells exceptional pictures it is continuously adding well-known names to its stock membership, producing force and list of authors. Paul Gilmore With Raver AUL GILMORE is another legitimate dramatic celebrity engaged to play a principal role in the Raver Film Corporation's first Augustus Thomas production, Other Girl,\" with James J. Corbett. Gilmore inter- the character of the likable minister, bubbling to the with personality. \"The prets brim As the clergyman, Paul Gilmore is invested with a part that befits his dash, vim and hand- some appearance. Ex- hibitors and the patron- izing public know Mr. Gilmore from two an- gles, namely, the mo- tion picture and the dramatic field. Before the camera, this mati- nee idol has appeared as a star only in im- p o r t a n t productions, among which \"The Penitentes,\" a Griffith film. To be exact, Mr. Gilmore left Los An- geles this Saturday and arrives at the Staten Pau* Gilmore. Island studio of the Raver Film Corporation Monday, No- vember 7. Mr. Gilmore appeared on Broadway in such productions as \"At Yale,\" \"Captain Debonnaire,\" \"The Boys of Company B,\" \"Mistress Nell,\" in support of Henrietta Crosman, and in a revival of \"The Three Musketeers.\" He also toured the United States in these plays. However, the South and West proclaim him as their own because of his success in that territory at the head of his own companies, presenting \"The Mummy and the Humming Bird,\" \"King Charles,\" \"The Tyranny of Tears,\" \"The Call of the North,\" \"The Havoc\" and the aforesaid, \"At Yale,\" \"Captain Debonnaire\" and \"The Boys of Company B.\" Mr. Gilmore represents that valuable class of stars roundly popular in both domains of the profession and in all sections of this country. EQUITABLE AFTER BIG WRITERS. In the literary sections of various New York, London and Paris daily papers, this week, appears an advertisement, placed by the Equitable Motion Pictures Corporation, in which important authors and playwrights are invited to sub- mit their wares to the Equitable scenario department and stating that no price was too great for stories and plays that were adaptable to the screen. The display advertisement in the literary sections and in the authors' trade journals was the culmination of Arthur H. Spiegel's authorizing the appropriation of one hundred thousand dollars by the Equitable to be used in procuring the greatest works of the great writers. Following this principle, Robert W. Chambers, Richard Le- gallienne, Sir Gilbert Parker, Sir James M. Barrie, C. N. and A. M. Williamson, Brand Whitlock and others of note are being approached and offered substantial sums to permit their works to be screened or to write original matter. 1110 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD November 6, 1915 \"The Old Homestead\" at Last Famous Players Film Co. Take First Scenes in Adaptation of Denman Thompson's Beloved Masterpiece in Newly Acquired Fifty-sixth Street Quarters. BY A RARE coincidence, the first scene taken in the old Durland Riding Academy which was acquired for studio purposes by the Famous Players Film Company after the burning of its Twenty-sixth street headquarters, was the opening of \"The Old Homestead,\" the celebrated rural classic which for over thirty years served to endear itself, and its star and author, Denman Thompson, to the American public. It is doubtful if any other play is as well known to the masses as \"The Old Homestead,\" with the possible excep- tion of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" It is one of the few plays which the great motion picture public knows as it knows its alphabet. And for that reason it will be appreciated by the public more than any sensational adaptation which has ever been made. Denman Thompson's old home will be used, by permis- sion of his son, Frank Thompson, from whom the rights to the play were obtained, as the settings for the rural por- tion of the story. The outlying districts of the typically quaint New England town in which it is situated will also be called upon to furnish additional rustic atmosphere. James Kirkwood, under whose direction the adaptation is being made, states that \"The Old Homestead\" will prove unique in the history of feature films because of the scarcity of studio sets which will be used. With the old Thompson home, the neighboring village, and old Grace Church in New York, which forms one of the important settings, all to be used as actual backgrounds, and with many scenes trans- piring in the streets of New York, there are but very few scenes which will be staged in the studio. The Famous Players are especially indebted to Frank Thompson for the personal co-operation and assistance which he has given them in their efforts to preserve to the last detail the traditions and atmosphere with which the elder Thompson's presentation of \"The Old Homestead\" has so long been invested. From the photographs fur- nished by Mr. Thompson the producers have been able to copy exactly the costumes and make-up of the original char- acters in the play. Triumph Plans Big Program Many Important Productions Scheduled by Equitable's Chief Producing Ally. WITH the Equitable program, now practically outlined for the forthcoming half year, Equitable's chief pro- ducing ally, the Triumph Film Corporation of which Arthur H. Jacobs is the executive head and Joseph Golden, director in chief, announces, as its more important activities of the next six months, six releases, in which eight of the foremost stars and noted players of the legitimate stage will make their appearance. Triumph's past releases on the Equitable program in- cluded Hilda Spong in \"Divorced,\" Lenore Ulrich in \"The Better Woman,\" Julius Steger in \"The Master of the House,\" and Helen Ware in \"The Price,\" all of which were super- vised by Director Golden himself. Through General Manager Jacobs arrangements were en- tered into last week whereby Harriet Ford, author of \"The Argyle Case,\" \"The Dummy,\" and other big legitimate suc- cesses, will, in the future, devote her time to constructing scenarios exclusively for Triumph. This is a tremendously big advance in scenario work, for Miss Ford is considered one of the most prolific and versatile of dramatic writers of the day, and at present has contracts for four different legitimate productions for Broadway, appearing during the forthcoming season. Henry Kolker, who is now working in \"The Warning,\" under the directorial auspices of Edmund Lawrence, has been engaged for three additional productions, which will characterize the Equitable releasing chart at a period of from three to four months apart. Mr. Lawrence will begin work immediately upon the production of \"The Ransom,\" in which the estimable Julia Dean will star. Miss Dean recently began rehearsing for her latest starring vehicle, which opens at a Broadway house soon, and it will be necessary for her to divide her time between studio and stage, but as Equitable will not release the Dean picture until early in January, ample time is allowed for her legitimate work. Marie Empress, last seen in \"When We Were Twenty- one,\" in which she portrayed the role of the vampire woman, will be featured by Triumph in a sensational dramatic offer- ing, based on one of Guy De Maupassant's stories, which is now in the making. Miss Empress will begin work about November 14 upon the completion of a large wardrobe. The De Maupassant script calls for elaborate apparel. Charles J. Ross, now playing in \"The Senator,\" William H. Crane's former vehicle, is at work at Washington, D. C, under Director Joseph H. Golden. \"The Senator\" will be seen on the Equitable program about December 20th. The Triumph scenario department is now in complete charge of Eva Unsell, formerly with Famous Players; Har- riet Ford, Mr. Golden and Arthur Jacobs. Edison's New Director General Frank Smithson, Noted Theatrical Manager and Father of Many Successes and Stars, Is Won Over by Edison. IN the nature of a triumph for the Edison organization is the winning over to motion pictures of Frank Smithson, the noted Broadway theatrical producer, to become its director general under Leonard W. McChesney, studio and motion picture division manager. For a bright galaxy, in- deed, it would make were the players' names to be mentioned who owe to Mr. Smithson's a c u m e n their present eminent position on the stage and screen, and, in the majority of these cases, owe their very theatrical or screen existence to his judg- ment and advancing of them. It may safe- ly be .said without danger of being gain- said that there is probably no other one man who has such a string of theatrical successes and money- makers to his credit. A few of these, within easy memory, are \"The Girl from Paris,\" said to be \"a world-beater\" among productions for the money it made; \"Monte Carlo;\" \"Ho- tel Topsy Turvy;\" \"The Defender,\" in Boston when Blanche Ring first came into prominence; \"The Chaperones;\" \"The Orchid;\" \"The Blue Moon;\" \"The Top of the World;\" \"The Motor Girl;\" \"The Beauty Spot;\" \"The Giddy Throng;\" \"King's Carnival;\" \"Nancy Brown;\" \"Queen of the Moulin Rouge;\" \"Louisiana Lou,\" and \"High Jinks.\" Mr. Smithson had but just returned from Chicago where he staged a big success when he jumped into the rehearsing of another in New York. When this task is finished, he will take up his new duties, about November 22, at the Edison studio. Twenty years of a most active life have been spent in America by Mr. Smithson, who, however, was a well-known leading comedian in England before he came here. There, he was associated with Augustus Harris, William Greet and others of prominence. He has originated many parts, notably, such as Uncle Matt in \"La Cigale,\" Larry O'Brien in \"Dandy Dick.\" with May Yohe, who had made a sensational success at that time. Mr. Smithson also played in and staged many English plays and pantomimes. When he visited this coun- try for pleasure, he met E. E. Rice, who prevailed upon him to remain and stage \"The Girl from Paris\" at the Herald Square theater. Since that time Mr. Smithson has become a loyal American citizen, declaring that he loves his adopted land the more each year he stays. Mr. Smithson will work hand in hand with the studio manager, Mr. McChesney, but the former will enjoy more latitude and authority than has heretofore been allotted one in a similar position, in recognition of Mr. Smithson's uncommon and successful experience and ability. The Edison organization long negotiated with Mr. Smithson before he could hear the call of motion pictures, but now that they have been successful, there is a feeling that he will be a motive and energetic factor in placing Edison releases in an enviable position and that he will be no small force in the constant betterment of screen artistic and dramatic standards. Frank Smithson. November 6, 1915 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD 1111 \"Who Is Guilty\"? New Pathe Series Written by Mrs. Wilson Woodrow and Featuring Emmy Wehlen It Will Be Produced by the Arrow Film Corporation. AFTER months of careful preparation Pathe announces the completion of plans for the series \"Who Is Guilty?\" which will follow \"Neal of the Navy.\" The first re- lease of the new series will be on December 11. the week after the release of the last episode of \"Neal of the Navy.\" Emmy Wehlen, the famous favorite of the legitimate stage and Howard Estabrook, the very best of Broadway's younger stars, will play the leads. The engagement of these \"top notch players at a very high cost is an assurance that Pathe intends to make this series its most pretentious of all the long list of successes identified with its name — a remarkable list beginning with \"The Perils of Pauline\" and running down through \"The Exploits of Elaine,\" \"The New Exploits of Elaine,\" \"The Romance of Elaine,\" \"Who Pays?\" \"Neal of the Navy,\" and \"The New Adventures of J. Rufus Wal- lingford.\" The Arrow Film Corporation will produce \"Who Is Guilty?\" at its studios in Yonkers, N. Y., and the series will be under the personal direction of Howell Hansel, the well- known director, who is now director-in-chief of the Arrow Film Corporation. Miss Wehlen and Mr. Estabrook will feature throughout the series. The supporting players will doubtless be changed from time to time to meet the re- quirements of the scenario. At present the supporting cast includes Lila Chester, Henry West, Mrs. Balfour. Stanley Walpole, E. I. De Yarny and Katherine Reichart. Emmy Wehlen is easily one of the most prominent play- ers of the day. She was strongly attracted to the stage when a child only six years old, and even at that early age her am- bition was to one day become a theatrical star. No one can talk to her without being convinced that she is a thinker and gifted with more than the ordinary amount of brains. She says of \"Who Is Guilty?\" after reading the scenarios, that in it she recognized a most unusual medium for mo- tion pictures, and that she feels sure that the series will not only amuse but instruct to a rare degree. Howard Estabrook, who is co-star with Miss Wehlen in the Pathe series, has enjoyed an almost meteoric career upon the stage. No list of Broadway celebrities would be complete without his name. He is now appearing with Elsie Janis at the George M. Cohan theater in \"Miss Infor- mation.\" His daily routine at the present time is enough to intimidate anyone. He rises at seven, and as soon as he has finished breakfast goes to Yonkers, works in \"Who Is Guilty?\" then returns to New York, takes a hasty dinner, and at seven goes to the theater from which he doesn't get back home until 12:30 a. m. Thus he may truly lay claim to the title of the \"twenty-four hours a day man.\" Mr. Esta- brook is strongly impressed with the strength of \"Who Is Guilty?\" and believes that it will arouse great interest, deal- ing as it does with vital problems of every-day life present- ed in a new way. He is a fine, clear-eyed chap of strong out-of-door tastes, having a pronounced partiality for ten- nis, golf, and other sports that demand physical exertion and skill. Howell Hansel, who will direct \"Who Is Guilty?\" is one of the best known producers in the business. He promises that the production will be of the most elaborate quality, and his record insures a thoroughly artistic series of pictures. He was connected with the dramatic stage ever since he was nineteen years old up to three years ago. His last engage- ment on the speaking stage were with Blanche Bates in the Belasco production of \"The Fighting Hope,\" and with Mr. Belasco in \"The Woman.\" He went into the motion picture business immediately on the conclusion of this last engage- ment, and has been with Thanhouser. the World Film and Lubin. He directed \"The Million Dollar Mystery\" from start to finish. Mr. Hansel says of \"Who Is Guilty?\" that the scenarios are the strongest he has ever read — that all the essentials of suspense, big dramatic moments, thrills, punch, surprise, etc., are there. Being interested in the social questions of the day he feels that \"Who Is Guilty?\" will perform a real service in making people think and in throwing light upon various problems of life. As for the stories of \"Who Is Guilty?\" they have been written for newspaper syndication by Mrs. Wilson Wood- row, the famous novelist, an account of whom appeared last week in these columns. They are put into scenario form by George Brackett Seitz, who has written many Pathe suc- cesses. The series will be in fourteen chapters of two parts each, each chapter complete in itself. The theme deals with various social problems of the day, and will be treated in a thoroughly unconventional manner. The question of \"Who Is Guiilty?\" for the various infractions of man-made laws will be left to the observer and the subject will always be handled in the most truthful manner possible consistent with good taste. To Record Photographic Conditions David Horsley Has Scheme to Aid Cameramen in Improving the Quality of Their Work. THE latest innovation of David Horsley is a cameraman's guide. It consists of two pieces of blackened wood hinged together to close up for convenience, and is small enough to be carried in the side-pocket of a man's coat or in a magazine cast. It is used to identify scenes HGRSiiEY#3 Scene, ||\" fy f) jfST 5.6. 6.8. -a Cameraman's Chart, Devised by David Horsley. after development and is held up in front of the camera before each scene is exposed and after the scene is finished. On it is written the name of the cameraman and the di- rector and the number of the scene being taken. A watch is inserted in the board to show at what time the negative was exposed. The value of this lies in the fact that in case the negative does not turn out perfectly under the time and conditions then in force the cameraman can be guided by the result in future operations. The watch also shows at what time the first scene in the morning was taken and all the scenes for the same day. Six sets of figures are also marked on the board to indicate the diaphragm openings. Whichever opening is used is chalked off in the board. Here also, if the negative is not properly exposed, the cameraman, having a record of the opening used, can use the proper opening in the future. A letter \"S\" and a letter \"C\" appear on the board. The \"S\" stands for sunshine and the \"C\" for cloudy. A chalk- mark is put through either one, according to circumstances. If a scene is taken in the studio a chalk-mark is made between the two letters. A record is also made of the shutter opening used. On the accompanying reproduction of the board there is marked \"'_,\" which means that in the case noted the picture \\\\a^ taken with half shutter. PLAZA THEATER USED BY EQUITABLE. The Equitable Motion Pictures Corporation, last week, rented the Plaza theater at Madison avenue and Fifty-ninth street and staged several of the big scenes in \"The Labyrinth\" in which Gail Kane is appearing. A thousand extra people occupied the auditorium seats, while the entire \"Town Topics Company,\" from the Cen- tury theater, in full stage attire, presented the second act of that play before the camera, with Gail Kane taking the principal role instead of the regular leading woman. The entire theater was wired and lights installed and the scenes staged from six in the morning until late in the evening. E. Mason Hopper directed the efforts of the multitude of extras and forty principals. 1112 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD November 6, 1915 Campaigning with the Exhibitor Audiences Everywhere Show Their Sympathy With the Motion Picture in the Fight Against Censorship — Good Work in Albany, Troy, Utica and Syracuse. THE campaign of The Moving Picture World against the adoption of the new constitution after a good beginning in Yonkers was continued with equal success in Albany. All the big motion picture theaters in the capital city were visited and slides were distributed. Every exhibitor spoken to was in hearty sympathy with the plan to punish the framers of the reactionary constitution for their insolent refusal to recognize the rights of the motion picture to be classed with the press. Manager Powers of the Colonial, the big new theater on upper State street, spoke in flattering terms of the plan, as did Manager Gardner of the \"Pearl,\" one of the oldest motion picture theaters in the city. Mr. Morris Deitches of the Majestic, an old friend of The World, asked for an extra set of slides. W. Stephen Bush also spoke in the Clinton Square Theater, one of the most popular in Albany, and in the Orpheum, which is owned and conducted by Mr. Wm. D. Frischknecht. t Mr. Weidmann of Weidmann Brothers, owners of several picture theaters in Albany, likewise indorsed our plan. All these exhibitors realize the danger of having censorship brought into New York now that the constitution makers have decided not to give us the immunity from censorship, which under the leadership of The Moving Picture World had been demanded. Anti-Censorship Address Before Rotary Club in Troy. Through the good offices of Mr. E. Weinberg, the pro- gressive manager of the Plaza Theater in Troy, an invitation had been extended to W. S. Bush to speak before the Rotary Club of that city. Wm. Weinberg is a valued member of the club, which is composed of representative merchants and professional men of Troy. In the club rooms an air of cheer- fulness and hospitality made itself felt. There was singing in chorus, relieved by solos and quartettes. Among the members present were clergymen, one of the candidates for mayor, and some city officials. In response to the invitation to make an address on \"The Past, the Present and the Future of the Motion Picture,\" Mr. Bush said he had no intention of delivering a formal address, but would content himself with saying something about censorship. \"The pleasant ritual of your hospitality,\" said Mr. Bush, \"this all-pervading genial atmosphere have made me hesitate. I said to myself: 'Is it right to reward these boys with a set speech, is it right to inflict oratory upon them?' I confess that when I heard you sing my compunction grew less and after I had listened to your quartette, all the cruelty of my normal nature returned and I felt myself entitled to a counter attack. (Laughter.) In all seriousness I cannot say much in the short time I have. As to the past and present of the motion picture I feel I can call you as my witnesses to prove the value and the power of the screen. What I want to urge upon you is the future of the motion picture. We are threatened with censorship in this state. It is proposed to strangle this great medium of expression and to subject it to whims of one or two individuals, who will attempt to reg- ulate the amusements of the people. It is for men like you, representing a high order of intelligence and citizenship, to help us in saving the motion picture and keeping it free, but responsible, just as the press is free but responsible. The motion picture is destined to a career of supreme usefulness. It follows the splendid motto of your club, 'He profits most who serves best.' Are we going to check its development, are we going to stop its career of service and usefulness to please a group of narrow bigots? The motion picture is the people's entertainment. The people control and regulate it through the influence of public opinion. It needs no further restraint. American democracy is just as capable of taking care of the screen as it has taken care of the press and the theater. If we have a board of censors, who will censor the censors?\" The speaker outlined briefly some of the absurdities com- mitted by the censor boards of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Utica and Syracuse Active. In Utica M. Dynimski, the owner of the Gem Theater, distributed the World's anti-constitution slides. In Syra- cuse all the exhibitors unreservedly favored the plan of the World. Manager Shafia of the Novelty, Manager Schein of the Hippodrome, Mr. F. A. Fout, owner of several sub- urban theaters; Mr. Lang of the Plaza, the managers of Dreamland and the Lyceum, Manager P. Doegan of the Elite and the Seymour, all went on record as favoring the cam- paign of the World. Among the other theaters where Mr. Bush spoke were the Happy Hour, managed by Messrs. Max and Mitchell Fitzer, and the Langan Theater, of which Mr. B. J. Hopkins is the manager. Everywhere the audiences listened with great attention and plainly manifested their approval of the speaker's shafts against censorship. Manager Weil of the Strand also declared himself a warm advocate of the plan of the Moving Picture World. The campaign will close in Rochester. Vitagraphers GiveJ3enefit Dance Treasury of the Hospital and Sick Fund Richer by Substan- tial Sum as Result. THE second annual ball of the Vitagraph employes for the benefit of the Hospital and Sick Fund was held at Sheepshead Bay on the evening of Wednesday, October 27. The large number of persons present by no means rep- resented the sale of tickets. Dancing began early and it was continued until 4:30 in the morning. It was a most pleasant all-around occasion. \"Vic\" Smith, the president of the fund, was in charge of arrangements. He was aided by Vice-President Sam Spedon, Treasurer Jack Evans and Secretary Dick Leslie. The committee issued a souvenir containing photographs of the members of the Vitagraph executive and playing forces. Among the exhibtors present were noted Samuel H. Trig- ger, Thomas Howard and Grant Anson. Of the directors and players and staff seen were George D. Baker, Tefft John- ston, who was accompanied by Mrs. Johnston and also by his mother and sister of Washington, D. C; Wilfred North, William Humphrey, Paul Scardon, C. Jay Williams, C. Van Deusen, Charles Eldridge, James Morrison, Albert Roccardi, James Kilgour, Anders Randolph, Robert Gaillard, Garry McGarry, William Shea, E. Overton, Anita Stewart, Lillian Walker, Kate Price, Edith Storey, Eulalie Jensen, Virginia Pearson, Dorothy Kelly, Leah Baird, who was accompanied by Arthur F. Beck, manager of the Twenty-third street branch of the Mutual; Flora Finch, Frankie Mann, Edwina Robbins, Mary Maurice, Carolyn Birch, D. MacBride, John T. Kelly, A. Cozine, Jack Brawn, William Dunn, H. Forshay, Donald Hall, Hughie Mack, T. R. Mills, Alice Lake, Josephine Earle, K. Franek, E. Tully, N. Anderson, Logan Paul, Edward Elkus, S. Stark, Ed Wentworth, Charles Chapman, Walter Arthur, Harry Waldron, F. Esslinger and J. B. French. John F. Miller, of the Buffalo Times was one of the many present from outside the studio. H. H. Van Loan ANOTHER appointment announced from the manager's office of the Universal Film Manufacturing Company this week is that of H. H. Van Loan's promotion to be manager of the publicity department. This is the position formerly held by Joe Brandt, prior to becoming manager of the home office. For a while he had charge of both offices, but Mr. Van Loan's ability in plac- ing the publicity de- partment in a most flourishing condition led the officials of the Universal to make him head of the publicity department where he has supervision over a staff of twenty men and women. Some of the big campaigns Mr. Van Loan has promoted in- clude the Universal beauty contest in which forty-eight news- papers in all parts of the country were lined up with the Universal. The Pavlowa, Bern- hardt, \"Graft\" and Uni- versal City campaigns are other tributes to his fertile brain. An- other campaign which is now in preparation and which bids fair to surpass even the beauty contest, is that of \"Who is the handsomest man in America?\" His appointment as manager of the publicity department comes to him as a reward for his faithful endeavors in build- ing up an efficient publicity system and he carries with his promotion the best wishes of a host of friends out of the profession.

WHEN some few weeks ago, Jack Pratt, Lubin director, began the production of Louis Reeves Harrison's big five-reel Lubin V-L-S-E release, \"The Rights of Man,\" he was confronted with the usual amount of problems which are thrust before the director, but in this particular case, it seemed that just a wee bit more than the average at- tention was to be necessary to build the proper sets and In all, through the five reels there are fifteen reproductions of this kind, each one of equal magnitude and each one a vivid picture of what war really brings upon a country. Grave of Three Hundred French and German Soldiers at Mondemont, France, Taken by Joe Farnham April 6, 1915. select the real locations for the staging of those scenes of the picture which were to be replicas of the battlefields of Europe. The success or failure of his efforts rested upon his ac- curacy, as full well he appreciated. There were graves to be shown, real war-time graves by the roadside; there were buildings to be struck by shells and the effects shown; and there were uniforms to be accurate and critic-proof in their appearance. Accordingly Director Pratt and Publicity Di- rector Joe Farnham, of the Lubin Company, got busy and dug for the proper information, untiringly. It was hard to secure the necessary data and the search had about been given up, when it was recalled that Farnham had been in France for four months and knew the real country con- ditions. Mr. Pratt found not only the knowledge desired, but in ad- dition a collection of seventeen hundred still pictures, which Farnham had taken himself and which gave vivid views of Scene from \"The Rights of Man,\" Showing Graves of Soldiers, Taken at Betzwood, Pa., by Director Pratt September IS, 1915. just what he sought — the graves, the wounded and dying and dead on the fields of battle, shell-destroyed buildings, etc. Then it was decided that \"The Rights of Man\" was to be at least one picture in which no man could criticize settings and locations. Carpenters and scenic artists were put to work and at Lubin's Betzwood, landscape architects construct- ed the ground as France really is, built houses, dug graves in replica, etc. \"Stuffy\" Davis Plays Himself Popular Publicity Promoter to Be Seen on Mutual Program as \"Stuffy, the Press Agent.\" TALK about realism! The Gaumont company is going the limit. When a scenario was received recently call- ing for the services of a press agent named \"Stuffy,\" John S. Martin, who books the Gaumont stars, went post haste up and down Broadway until he found \"Stuffy\" Davis, the press agent who made Barnum & Eailey famous. In polite society this pur- veyor of pertinent press paragraphs is known as Glenmore Davis, but to his friends along the Rialto he is just \"Stuf- Press agents are like good generals; they will not send a man where they would not go themselves did duty call. This was a case where duty plainly called \"Stuffy\" to take his stand as an actor. The fact that he never had been an actor didn't matter, because the contract flashed be- fore his eyes plainly stated that he had only to play HIMSELF in \"Does It Pay to Ad- vertise?\" Now that \"Stuffy\" is in for it, he finds that he didn't know what it meant to play himself in a Casino Star Comedy. Tom Waters, the com- edian who has the lead, threw \"Stuffy\" in a rainbarrel. This is the closest a Broad- way press agent has been to water since the Friars gave their last outing. If big amusement productions owe their success in large part to their publicity men, then \"Stuffy\" Davis can do a great deal of \"pointing with pride.\" For Frederic Thomp- son he handled the publicity for \"Polly of the Circus,\" \"Brewster's Millions,\" \"A Fool There Was,\" \"The Spend- thrift,\" and \"Springtime.\" More important than any of these was his connection with the big Thompson Amusement en- terprise at Coney Island, Luna Park. He has also been with the circus. Glenmore Davis. BLANCHE SWEET TO REMAIN WITH LASKY. Reports having reached the Lasky Feature Play Company that certain motion picture manufacturers believing that Miss Blanche Sweet's contract to appear exclusively in Lasky productions on the Paramount Programs had expired or was about to expire, had made overtures of employment to her, Messrs. Wise and Lichtenstein, attorneys for the Lasky Company this week made known generally that Miss Sweet will continue for a considerable period under the Lasky direction. The determination to make a public announcement of the contractural relations between the noted producing firm and the star was decided only after a circular letter had been sent to various manufacturers calling attention to the existing contract between the Lasky Company and Miss Sweet. Many of the companies responded to the letter of warning and expressed pleasure that the Lasky firm had seen fit to stop senseless reports of Miss Sweet's sudden termination of her Lasky contract. ALICE BRADY IN \"THE RACK.\" Alice Brady is the star in the forthcoming production of \"The Rack,\" based upon a Brady success. In that picture, Milton Sils, who made such a success in \"The Pit\" and \"The Arrival of Perpetua,\" will also be seen. The picture is in the hands of Emile Chautard, who recently completed \"The Little Church Around the Corner.\" 1114 THE MOVING PICTURE WORLD November 6, 1915 Paramount Photo- News Man Donald C. Thompson, \"Camera Reporter\" for Paramount Pictures, Goes to the Scene of the Balkan Conflict. LEAVING the Port of New York on the liner St. Paul, with the statement that by the time he reaches Athens, Greece will be in the war, Donald C. Thompson, ex- pert photographer and globe trotter, has set out for the Balkans in the interest of two organizations of utmost im- portance in their particular fields, the Paramount Pictures Corporation and the Leslie-Judge Company. Since the advent o f the motion picture, the \"camera - reporter\" has become more and more significant among the world's news gatherers. This twenty-six-year- old Kansan was one of the first to realize the possibility of the new branch of \"the game.\" At the Baltimore Dem- ocratic Convention three years ago he took his first flyer into the films. The result was such that he added a motion picture camera to his p h o tographic stock and freelanced to such good purpose that h e became a charter member in the Unusual Angle Club and d i s - tinctly welcome in the offices of the editors. A confirmed wander- er, he was in Canada at the outbreak of the war, and securing a per- mit from General Hughes was able to obtain exclusive pho- tographs of the Canadian contingent. Later he went to France on a freight ship, narrowly escaping demolition when a careless German bomb just missed the tramp steamer on which he did odd jobs for his passage, since mere money meant nothing when it came to getting inside the lines. With the English on the continent, Mr. Thompson took some of the most remarkable pictures of the entire war. For seven days and nights he was under steady fire at the retreat from Mons. When asked whether or not filming the battle was as dangerous as fighting he shrugged his shoul- ders and said, \"Yes, I suppose it is, but if you're going to be killed vou will be, so why worry?\" His one idea is to get the pictures just as the born reporter thinks of nothing but his \"story.\" He is quiet and matter of fact in speech and manner, and yet he has done things few men have more than dreamed of. At London he acted as correspondent for the New York World, and later joined the Belgian army. Having been at one time or another with the English, French, Belgians"
