        "text": "The Oath of the Sword was produced in 1914 by a company described by Moving Picture World as the “first company in America to be owned, controlled and operated by Japanese.” Based in Los Angeles, the Japanese American Film Company was among several similar independent film companies established by Japanese during a period when the American film industry had yet to become Hollywood as we know it. The Oath of the Sword is the earliest known Asian American film production, and illuminates a largely unknown chapter in American film history – only now being recovered via the rediscovery and restoration of films like The Curse of Quon Gwon (1916, Marion Wong) and Sessue Hayakawa’s The Dragon Painter (1919, William Worthington).\n\nThe Oath of the Sword tells the story of young lovers separated as the ambitious young man, Masao, leaves his lover Hisa to study abroad at the University of California Berkeley. Masao becomes a success at the university, a popular student and a star athlete who dominates in track and swimming competitions. Left to care for her ailing father and unable to cope with her solitude, Hisa eventually betrays Masao and marries another man. Upon Masao’s return to his native Japan, Hisa fulfills “the oath of the sword” (katana) and kills herself. Following the conventions of Madame Butterfly, in which a tragic interracial romance ends with suicide, the character Hisa is the fallen Japanese woman fulfilling her seemingly inevitable destiny by ending her life.\n\nThe film was released via independent distributor Sawyer Film Mart. Per contemporary newspaper advertisements, the film was screened across the United States in major cities, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and New York City. Years after its initial release, the film also reached audiences in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1918.\n\nOf interest for today’s viewers is the film’s setting on the Berkeley campus, as well as the first onscreen appearances of Yutaka Abe (1895-1977), who was later cast in The Cheat (1915, Cecil B. DeMille) and The Willow Tree (1920, Henry Otto). Abe’s early career in the American film industry is not well known. He also played a minor role in Lotus Blossom (1921), made by James B. Leong and his Los Angeles-based Wah Ming Motion Picture Company. Moving between the United States and Japan, Abe later had an influential career in the Japanese film industry as a phenomenally successful and respected writer, director, and producer. He is credited with directing some 66 Japanese films, from Shôhin eiga-shû: Pan (1925) to his final film Inochi no asa (1961). The Oath of the Sword is also significant for its casting of Japanese actors to play Japanese film characters, a major departure from industry practices of “yellowface” in films of this era, like Sidney Olcott’s Madame Butterfly (1915).\n\nThe only known print of The Oath of the Sword is in the collections of the George Eastman Museum. The film has been newly restored thanks to the collaboration of the George Eastman Museum and the Japanese American National Museum (Los Angeles), funded by a grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation. The digital restoration from a 35mm nitrate print and a 35mm safety negative from the George Eastman Museum collection was done at George Eastman Museum Film Preservation Services and at Colorlab.\n\nDenise Khor"
