        "text": "Kritika Kamra has consistently impressed audiences with her versatility, seamlessly transitioning between love stories, newsroom dramas, political thrillers, and more, each time delivering a memorable performance on television as well as OTT platforms. Now, she's set to captivate viewers once again in her first-ever role as a police officer in the upcoming ZEE5 original, Gyaarah Gyaarah. When asked about her experience of playing a cop and striking the right balance, Kritika revealed that the most challenging aspect wasn't embodying the role of a police officer. Instead, it was more about transitioning from one era to another.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Kritika Kamra on the most challenging aspect of playing a cop in two different eras in Gyaarah Gyaarah: “Maintaining this character arc was demanding”\n\nKritika Kamra shared, \"Playing a cop isn't particularly challenging because the uniform does much of the work for you. It naturally brings that commanding body language. However, I ensured my character wasn't one-dimensional, as it's quite complex and layered. The real challenge was portraying the character in both past and present timelines. I had to look the same yet bring out stark differences through hair, makeup, and mannerisms to distinguish between my younger and older self. Maintaining this character arc was demanding but exciting. It was fascinating to see how her personality evolved based on her experiences. That's what an actor craves in a good character, it's almost like living a different life. The whole experience was truly amazing.\"\n\nGyaarah Gyaarah is a time-bending thriller that spans across time. The story revolves around a 15-year-old cold case that gets reopened, leading to unexpected twists and turns. Raghav Juyal plays Yug Arya, a police officer who discovers he can communicate with another cop from the 1990s, portrayed by Dhairya Karwa, through a mysterious walkie-talkie. This unique premise sets the stage for a gripping investigation that questions the very nature of time and the possibility of altering the past to change the present and future.\n\nWith its stellar cast, including Gautami Kapoor and Harsh Chhaya, and the backing of producers Karan Johar and Guneet Monga Kapoor, Gyaarah Gyaarah explores the themes of justice, time, and the human condition.\n\nALSO READ: Raghav Juyal opens up about his character, the ‘butterfly effect’ and other details of Gyaarah Gyaarah; says, “When I read the script, I was mind-boggled”\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
