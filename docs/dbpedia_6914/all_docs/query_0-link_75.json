        "text": "As expected, Kill saw a growth in numbers on Saturday. Since the showcasing of the film has been reduced due to the arrival of Sarfira and Hindustani 2 (Hindi), it has been challenging for the film to bring in the kind of footfalls that it deserves. However, unlike many such small or mid-budget films that just give up in face of big competition, this one is fighting it out and still managing to attract at least niche audiences.\n\nThis was seen on Saturday as well when Rs. 1.20 crore more came in. This is a decent enough jump when compared to Friday which was around Rs 80 lakhs mark. In fact, since the film is playing on limited shows, the occupancy is better. While that’s one advantage that the film is having from the film watching perspective, it certainly needs bigger numbers as well and hopefully that would turn out to be the case today when the numbers will grow further, before stabilising all over again during the weekdays. While Rs. 1.50 crore would be comfortably surpassed today, anything over Rs. 1.75 crore would have a good ring to it.\n\nThe film has now collected Rs. 13.36 crores at the box office and today it will cross Rs. 15 crores mark. Next week, Dharma Productions’ own Bad News will arrive in theatres and it would be interesting to see how the showcasing is balanced out between the premium production house’s two offerings that would be running in parallel.\n\nNote: All collections as per production and distribution sources"
