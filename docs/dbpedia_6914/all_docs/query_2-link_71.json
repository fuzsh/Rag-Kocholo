        "text": "D.W. Griffith once said of Lillian Gish: \"She is not only the best actress in her profession, but she has the best mind of any woman I have ever met.\"\n\nStrong words from the man who made Gish the silent screen's greatest dramatic star with such films as \"The Birth of a Nation,\" \"Broken Blossoms\" and \"Orphans of the Storm.\" Such hyperbole was not typical for the pioneering director who has been called the inventor of the modern movie.Gish was equally devoted to the man she always called Mr. Griffith (there has been no evidence of a romance between them). It is no accident that she titled her autobiography, \"The Movies, Mr. Griffith and Me.\"\n\nShe wrote of penning a letter on the day of his death in 1948. She concluded: \"No century that has given the world a Dante - an Edison - a Griffith can be wholly bad.\" In the book she quoted Frank Capra: \"Since Griffith, there's been no major improvement in the art of film direction.\"\n\nGish, who was 99, died in her sleep Saturday evening in New York, hours before the death of a fellow screen legend, Ruby Keeler, the sweet-faced tap dancer who lit up a string of Warner Bros. musicals in the 1930s.\n\nFor Gish, the magic of movies ended with the advent of talkies.\n\n\"The movies were well on their way to developing an entirely new art form,\" she said in a 1954 interview. \"It was not just pantomime, but something wonderfully expressive. All that was shattered when the movies started to talk. They went right back to stage technique. There was nothing original about them anymore.\"\n\nDuring her astounding 94 years as an actress, Lillian Gish was known as Baby Lillian, The Iron Butterfly and The First Lady of the Silent Screen.\n\nShe and her younger sister were billed as Baby Lillian and Baby Dorothy because their mother didn't want her staid relatives to discover that the girls worked on the stage.\n\nLillian Gish earned the Iron Butterfly title because of an amazing fortitude despite her fragile appearance. She worked in a blizzard for \"Way Down East,\" leaping from one ice floe to another in a raging river. For \"The Wind,\" she stood in 120-degree heat in the Mojave Desert while eight airplane propellers and sulphur pots blew at her.\n\nAfter leaving Griffith in the early 1920s, she managed her career with a firm hand, demanding approval of scripts and directors.\n\nAlthough Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Jack Nicholson and a few latter-day stars have been able to win film contracts for 10 percent of gross receipts, none has managed to get 15 percent, as Gish did in 1923.\n\n*****\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nHighlights\n\nSome highlights of Lillian Gish's career:\n\nFILM\n\n\"An Unseen Enemy,\" 1912\n\n\"The Musketeers of Pig Alley,\" 1912\n\n\"A Misunderstood Boy,\" 1913\n\n\"The Mothering Heart,\" 1913\n\n\"The Battle of Elderbush Gulch,\" 1913\n\n\"Judith of Bethulia,\" 1914\n\n\"The Birth of a Nation,\" 1915\n\n\"Intolerance,\" 1916\n\n\"Hearts of the World,\" 1918\n\n\"Broken Blossoms,\" 1919\n\n\"Remodeling Her Husband,\" 1920.
