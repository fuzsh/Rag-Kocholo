The bottom portion shows a screenshot of a page titled, “Technology in Action.” The text reads as follows. The Changing Technologies of Film Promotion The history of cinema is, in part, a history of changing technologies, and the art and business of film promotion and marketing have continually changed over time along with those technologies. In the first decades of the twentieth century, the movies moved rapidly from a vaudevillian\n\nnovelty to an important institution within the cultural mainstream. Supporting this cultural shift, traditional print media (including newspapers, posters, and fan magazines) began to celebrate new films and stars as a part of a new and exciting literacy, a way of seeing the world in tune with the energies of the emerging twentieth century. Photoplay magazine appeared in 1911, just as the Hollywood star system was beginning to emerge as a major promotional strategy. This magazine attracted passionate readers and moviegoers to stories about upcoming films and about the public and private lives of directors and actors. Such publications broadened the reach of film promotion to the growing middle class and assimilated the new film arts into literary and journalistic media, bridging a cultural past and a cultural present [Figure 1.21a]. Figure 1.21a shows a cover page of Photoplay magazine. The caption reads, Photoplay magazine cover (February 1931). Magazines and newspapers welcomed the new art of cinema through traditional journalistic vehicles. Transcendental Graphics/Archive Photos/Getty Images. As promotional technologies expanded through the mid-twentieth century to include radio and television, film studios immediately took advantage of the broad markets reached by these outlets. As audio and visual media, radio and television allowed potential audiences to see and hear the actors, music, and images being promoted in advance of the films themselves. For instance, a ninety-second radio ad for Superman the Movie (1978) alternated between voiceover narration quoting the praise of critics (“a super hit!”), the film’s musical score, and pieces of lively dialogue (“the problem with men of steel is that there’s never one around when you want one”). Both radio and television became ubiquitous promotional vehicles that integrate sound and (in the case of television ads) images to draw viewers into theaters [Figure 1.21b]. Figure 1.21b shows a photo of Joan Collins, and the caption reads, “Television promotion (1960). Television and radio made stars like Joan Collins (pictured here) come alive as a new form of promotion. C B S Photo Archive/C B S/Getty Images.”\n\nMore recently, the internet brought another major technological change in film promotion. Today, many marketing campaigns encourage interactivity and direct involvement from potential viewers, teasing mysteries and unexpected surprises intended to boost word of-mouth engagement. The pioneering example of internet marketing was The Blair Witch Project (1999), a low-budget horror film that generated excitement through an immersive viral campaign. Over several months prior to its release, the film’s distributors released realistic “newsreel” footage online that made the plot of the film seem believable, to the point where potential viewers actually debated whether the film was fiction or documentary. Due to its commercial and critical success, The Blair Witch Project has become a model for subsequent viral marketing campaigns, illustrating the extent to which promotional technologies impact our film experience [Figure 1.21c]. Figure 1.21c shows a poster for missing people, and the caption reads, “The Blair Witch Project (1999). Today the internet often makes promotion part of an interactive engagement with viewers.

New part-opening and chapter-opening images\n\ncover films from cinema’s early years to today. Contemporary additions include Bohemian Rhapsody, Dunkirk, Free Solo, Jojo Rabbit, Little Women, Parasite, Roma, and Us alongside classics like Touch of Evil, Midnight Cowboy, The Shining, In the Mood for Love, and many more. Chapter 1 Encountering Film From Preproduction to Exhibition Between 2013 and 2018, Ryan Coogler directed three very different films: Fruitvale Station (2013), Creed (2015), and Black Panther (2018). Although all three feature Michael B. Jordan and share important questions about racial identity and cultural violence, the production, distribution, and exhibition of the three films illustrate how films, even by the same director, can be shaped by extremely different institutional histories that in turn shape our understanding of them. Based on actual events that occurred in 2008 in California, Fruitvale Station is a small but intense drama about an African American man mistakenly shot and killed by a transit policeman. When the film’s theatrical release in July 2013 coincided with the acquittal of the police officer who killed a young, unarmed African American man in Florida, Fruitvale Station became part of larger conversations, still ongoing, about justice in the streets of America. Creed traveled a different path. This franchise film inherited the whole history of the Rocky series, which focused on star Sylvester Stallone’s character as a working-class boxer. In Creed, Rocky, an older and wiser man, trains the son of his old rival. A more formulaic film than Fruitvale Station, it appealed to both African American and broader audiences and became a box-office success.\n\nFinally, as part of the popular Marvel Cinematic Universe film series, Black Panther ramped up its production values and its financial and cultural success. The film — about superhero T’Challa’s fight to save the fictional African nation of Wakanda — won three Academy Awards and grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing movie in history with a black director and a majority-black cast. As these three disparate films suggest, film production, distribution, and exhibition shape our encounters with movies, and these aspects of film are in turn shaped by how movies are received by audiences. Proven Learning Tools That Foster Critical Viewing and Analysis The Film Experience offers a great array of learning tools that have been updated for this edition, including new Viewing Cues in every chapter in-depth Film in Focus essays, including new ones on films like A Quiet Place and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse History Close Up boxes that advance a conversation about how film history interacts with contemporary film culture the most in-depth coverage of writing about film in any introductory film textbook History Close Up Oscar Micheaux One of the most important rediscovered figures in film history is the African American novelist, writer, producer-director, and impresario Oscar Micheaux (right), who in 1918 directed his first feature film, The Homesteader, an adaptation from his own novel. Micheaux owned and operated an independent production company from 1918 to 1948,\n\nproducing more than forty feature films on extremely limited budgets, most of which have been lost. Reusing footage and working with untrained actors, he fashioned a distinctly non-Hollywood style whose “errors” can be interpreted as an alternative aesthetic tradition. His most controversial film, Within Our Gates (1920) (discussed later in this chapter), realistically portrays the spread of lynching and was threatened with censorship in a period of race riots. Later, in Body and Soul (1925), Micheaux teamed up with actor, singer, and activist Paul Robeson in a powerful portrait of a corrupt preacher. Paradoxically, efforts made in the 1940s to persuade Hollywood to produce more progressive representations of African Americans helped put an end to the independent tradition of “race movies,” and Micheaux released his last film, The Betrayal, in 1948.\n\nSIXTH EDITION\n\nTHE FILM EXPERIENCE An Introduction\n\nTimothy Corrigan University of Pennsylvania Patricia White Swarthmore College\n\nFor Bedford/St. Martin’s Vice President: Leasa Burton Senior Program Director: Erika Gutierrez Director of Content Development: Jane Knetzger Development Editor: Will Stoneﬁeld Editorial Assistant: Bill Yin Director of Media Editorial: Adam Whitehurst Marketing Manager: Amy Haines Director, Content Management Enhancement: Tracey Kuehn Senior Managing Editor: Lisa Kinne Senior Content Project Manager: Peter Jacoby Workﬂow Project Manager: Lisa McDowell Production Supervisor: Robin Besofsky Director of Design, Content Management: Diana Blume Interior Design: Jerilyn DiCarlo Cover Design: William Boardman Text Permissions Associate: Allison Ziebka Photo Permissions Editor: Angela Boehler Photo Researcher: Krystyna Borgen, Lumina Datamatics, Inc.

Whether watching the newest Star Wars adventure with a packed crowd, viewing Academy Award–winner Parasite (2019), or catching up with classics or old favorites in our homes, we all have experienced the pleasures that movies can bring. The ﬁlm experience can begin with journeying to imaginary worlds, witnessing recreations of history, observing stars in familiar and unfamiliar roles, and exploring the laughter, thrills, or emotions of different genres. Understanding the full depth and variety of these experiences, though, requires more than just initial impressions. This book aims to help students learn the languages of ﬁlm and synthesize those languages into a cohesive knowledge of the medium that will, in turn, enhance their movie watching. The Film Experience: An Introduction offers readers a serious, comprehensive introduction to the art, industry, culture, and experience of movies — along with digital tools to bring that experience to life and help students master course material. As movie fans ourselves, we believe that the complete ﬁlm experience comes from understanding both the formal and cultural aspects of cinema. Knowing how ﬁlmmakers use the familiarity of star personas, for example, can be as valuable and enriching as\n\nunderstanding how a particular editing rhythm creates a speciﬁc mood. The Film Experience builds on formal knowledge and cultural contexts to ensure that students gain a well-rounded ability to engage in critical analysis. The sixth edition is better equipped than ever to meet this challenge with a renewed focus on the changing technologies of ﬁlm, including an extensively revised chapter on animated and experimental media (Chapter 9), a new Technology in Action feature that helps students understand how technology has inﬂuenced ﬁlm form and ﬁlm culture, and better-than-ever digital support in LaunchPad, our online course platform (learn more at launchpadworks.com). LaunchPad for The Film Experience now includes the full e-book, new video clips with discussion questions that bring cinematic concepts to life, and LearningCurve adaptive quizzing to help students practice and master key concepts from the book. The learning tools we have created help students make the transition from movie fan to critical viewer, allowing them to use the knowledge they acquire in this course to enrich their moviewatching experiences throughout their lives.\n\nThe Best Coverage of Film’s Formal Elements We believe that comprehensive knowledge of ﬁlm practices and techniques allows students a deeper and more nuanced understanding of ﬁlm meaning. Going beyond mere descriptions of the nuts and bolts of ﬁlm form, The Film Experience highlights how formal elements like cinematography, editing, and sound can be analyzed and interpreted within the context of a ﬁlm as a whole — formal studies made even more vivid by our suite of ﬁlm clips in LaunchPad. In choosing our text and video examples, we draw from the widest variety of movies in any introductory text, demonstrating how individual formal elements can contribute to a ﬁlm’s larger meaning. We understand the importance of connecting with students through ﬁlms they may already know, and we have added new examples referring to recent ﬁlms like Jojo Rabbit (2019), Little Women (2019), Parasite (2019), A Quiet Place (2018), Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker (2019), and Us (2019). We also feel that it is our responsibility to help students understand the rich variety of movies throughout history, utilizing classics like The Jazz Singer (1927), Citizen Kane (1941), Touch of Evil (1958), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and The Godfather (1972), as well as a wealth of experimental, independent, and international ﬁlms.\n\nFully Encapsulating the Culture of Film In addition to a strong foundation in ﬁlm form, knowledge of the nature and extent of ﬁlm culture and its impact on our viewing experiences is necessary for a truly holistic understanding of cinema. One of the pillars of The Film Experience story has always been its focus on the relationship among viewers, movies, and the industry. Throughout, the book explores how these connections are shaped by the social, cultural, and economic contexts of ﬁlms through incisive discussions of such topics as the inﬂuence of the star system, the marketing strategies of indies versus blockbusters, and the multitude of reasons that we are drawn to some ﬁlms over others. That discussion continues in this new edition with additional emphasis on how the medium’s history informs the ways we watch movies today.\n\nNew to This Edition In response to reviewer feedback, we have overhauled The Film Experience’s coverage of technology and animation. As ever, The Film Experience is the best textbook at representing today’s ﬁlm culture — and in this edition, we have renewed our focus on technology. With an extensively revised Chapter 9 and a new Technology in Action feature in every chapter, we show how changes in technology have inﬂuenced ﬁlm form and ﬁlm culture. Additionally, this edition of The Film Experience can be packaged with LaunchPad, which for the ﬁrst time contains the full e-book and LearningCurve adaptive quizzing.\n\nTechnology in Action Places Current Trends in Historical Context Every chapter now includes a full-page Technology in Action feature — some of which are supplemented by video activities in LaunchPad — and each explores how technology in a certain area, like cinematography or ﬁlm sound, has changed over time. Today, technological changes in ﬁlm are rapid and far-reaching. Over the last two decades, video stores have gone from a major segment of the industry to virtually nonexistent, while in-home streaming services like Netﬂix and Amazon Prime Video have emerged as the most common way that many of us experience ﬁlm. Other changes, like theaters’ transition to digital projection and the resurgence of\n\n3D ﬁlm, are equally impactful. The Technology in Action feature helps students understand these and other changes in a historical context, revealing that ﬁlm technology has always been evolving and that these changes have always affected the culture, exhibition, and experience of ﬁlm.\n\nA Heavily Revised Chapter 9 on Animation and Experimental Media Our pre-revision reviewers requested more coverage of animated ﬁlm, and we have provided it in this revised chapter. Chapter 9 now covers the history, form, technologies, and theory of both animated and experimental ﬁlm, providing an integrated look at these topics.\n\nLaunchPad for The Film Experience The Film Experience goes further with LaunchPad, our online platform. LaunchPad contains the full e-book of The Film Experience, Sixth Edition, plus additional e-readings that go beyond the print text LearningCurve adaptive quizzing, which helps students practice and master key concepts in each chapter of the book\n\nnumerous movie clips, video essays, discussion questions, and more — perfect for interactive learning Bringing print and digital together, the Viewing Cue feature in the margins of each chapter directs students to clips of both classic and contemporary ﬁlms available online in LaunchPad. A dozen new clips have been added for the sixth edition, all accompanied by thought-provoking discussion questions. LaunchPad also includes many additional Film in Focus features not available in the print book. The LaunchPad platform makes it easy to assign readings from the e-book, videos, and LearningCurve activities. Access to LaunchPad for The Film Experience can be packaged with the book or purchased on its own. Learn more at launchpadworks.com.\n\nNew Examples Enhance the Strongest Art Program Available Each generation of students that takes the introductory course (from eighteen-year-old ﬁrst-year students to returning adults) is familiar with its own recent history of the movies. Hence, we have updated this edition with a number of new examples that reﬂect the diverse student body — Hollywood blockbusters such as Avengers: Endgame (2019), Ready Player One (2018), and Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker (2019); independent fare like Booksmart (2019) and The\n\nDead Don’t Die (2019); and international ﬁlms like Honeyland (2019), Pain and Glory (2019), and Parasite (2019).\n\nProven Learning Tools Foster Critical Viewing and Analysis The Film Experience transforms students from movie buffs to critical viewers by giving them the help they need to translate their movie experiences into theoretical knowledge and analytical insight. Our host of learning tools includes the following: Chapter-opening vignettes place students inside a ﬁlm. Each compelling vignette, many of them new to this edition, draws from actual scenes in a real movie to connect what students know as movie fans to key ideas in the chapter’s discussion. For example, Chapter 1 opens with a contrast between ﬁlmmaker Ryan Coogler’s projects Fruitvale Station (2013), Creed (2015), and Black Panther (2018), illustrating the different scopes, scales, and frames of reference for contemporary ﬁlmmaking. Film in Focus essays in each chapter provide close analyses of speciﬁc ﬁlms, demonstrating how particular techniques or concepts inform and enrich those ﬁlms. For example, a new feature in Chapter 6 analyzes how sound — its use and its absence — in A Quiet Place (2018) creates emotional and visceral effects. A focus on history, including History Close Up boxes, shows students how ﬁlm history interacts with contemporary ﬁlm culture. The Film Experience continues to provide better and more inclusive coverage of history than any other introductory ﬁlm textbook, with a particular emphasis on spotlighting the\n\nachievements of historically marginalized groups, such as women and people of color. Viewing Cues adjacent to key discussions in the chapter highlight key concepts and prompt students to consider these concepts while viewing ﬁlms on their own or in class — and to visit LaunchPad for speciﬁc video clips with questions. The best instruction on writing about ﬁlm and the most student writing examples of any introductory text are offered throughout. Praised by instructors and students as a key reason they love the book, Chapter 12, “Writing a Film Essay: Observations, Arguments, Research, and Analysis,” is a step-bystep guide to writing papers about ﬁlm — taking notes, choosing a topic, developing an argument, incorporating ﬁlm images, and completing a polished essay. It includes several annotated student essays and coverage of creating video essays, exploring a popular format for ﬁlm analysis.\n\nResources for Instructors To ﬁnd more information on the instructor resources, please visit the online catalog at macmillanlearning.com/ﬁlmexperience6e.

Another science fiction film released in 2019, the Australian I Am Mother, targeted specialized audiences at the Sundance Film Festival, where its success attracted the streaming platform Netflix for distribution. The narrative, centered on the unsettling relationship between the robot Mother and a human daughter, has cinematic antecedents in Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Terminator (1984), and Ex Machina (2014). By contrast, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker tells a more\n\nconventional heroic tale, yet reflects the values of its contemporary audience with a female hero and a racially diverse cast. Despite diﬀerences of scale, complexity, and impact, the films were both box-oﬀice successes and received positive critical recognition. Although I Am Mother earned a fraction of the blockbuster’s take, it was a financial success given its comparatively modest production budget. From their production through their promotion, distribution, and exhibition, social and institutional forces shaped these two films in very diﬀerent ways. Part 1 of this book identifies institutional, cultural, and historical contexts that shape the film experience, showing us how to connect our personal movie preferences with larger critical perspectives on film. Chapter 1 introduces the movie production process as well as the mechanisms and strategies of film distribution, promotion, and exhibition. Chapter 2 gives an overview of film history as well as strategies for organizing historical information. Understanding these diﬀerent contexts will help us to develop a broad and analytical perspective on the film experience.\n\nCHAPTER 1 ENCOUNTERING FILM From Preproduction to Exhibition\n\nDescription\n\nThe first still, from Fruitvale Station (2013), shows Michael B. Jordan holding a dog and looking at its eyes on the road. The second still, from Creed (2015), shows Michael B. Jordan running on the street during a fitness training session. The third still, from Black Panther (2018), shows Michael B. Jordan wearing armor along with the chief of the border tribes W’Kabi.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2018, Ryan Coogler directed three very diﬀerent films: Fruitvale Station (2013), Creed (2015), and Black Panther (2018). Although all three feature Michael B. Jordan and share important questions about racial identity and cultural violence, the production, distribution, and exhibition of the three films illustrate how films, even by the same director, can be shaped by extremely diﬀerent institutional histories that in turn shape our understanding of them. Based on actual events that occurred in 2008 in California, Fruitvale Station is a small but intense drama about an African American man mistakenly shot and killed by a transit policeman. When the film’s theatrical release in July 2013 coincided with the acquittal of the police oﬀicer who killed a young, unarmed African American man in Florida, Fruitvale Station became part of larger conversations, still ongoing, about justice in the streets of America. Creed traveled a diﬀerent path. This franchise film inherited the whole history of the Rocky series, which focused on star Sylvester Stallone’s character as a working-class boxer. In Creed, Rocky, an older and wiser man, trains the son of his old rival. A more formulaic film than Fruitvale\n\nStation, it appealed to both African American and broader audiences and became a box-oﬀice success. Finally, as part of the popular Marvel Cinematic Universe film series, Black Panther ramped up its production values and its financial and cultural success. The film — about superhero T’Challa’s fight to save the fictional African nation of Wakanda — won three Academy Awards and grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing movie in history with a black director and a majority-black cast. As these three disparate films suggest, film production, distribution, and exhibition shape our encounters with movies, and these aspects of film are in turn shaped by how movies are received by audiences.\n\ncan help you review. Go to launchpadworks.com\n\nBefore audiences experience a ﬁlm, an extensive process of preproduction, production, distribution, and promotion has already taken place. Understanding this process deepens our appreciation for ﬁlm form and for the labor and cra of ﬁlmmakers and reveals ways that culture and society inﬂuence ﬁlmmaking itself. This chapter describes the process of production as well as the fate of a ﬁnished ﬁlm as it is distributed, promoted, and exhibited. Such extraﬁlmic processes describe events that precede, surround, or\n\nfollow the actual images we watch and are inseparable from the ﬁlm experience. As viewers, our response, enjoyment, and understanding are shaped by where and when we see a movie as much as by the ﬁlm’s form and content. The ﬁlm experience now encompasses ever smaller viewing devices (including computers, iPads, and smartphones), changing social environments (from IMAX to home theaters), and cultural activities designed to promote interest in individual ﬁlms (reading about ﬁlms, directors, and stars; playing tie-in video games; watching special editions on DVD or Blu-ray; or connecting to social media that support a ﬁlm franchise). Waiting in line with friends for a Thursday night premiere and half-watching an edited in-ﬂight movie are signiﬁcantly different experiences that lead to different forms of appreciation and understanding. Overall, it is helpful to think of production and reception as a cycle rather than a one-way process: what goes into making and circulating a ﬁlm anticipates the moment of viewing, and viewing tastes and habits inﬂuence ﬁlm production and dissemination.\n\nKEY OBJECTIVES List the stages of filmmaking, from preproduction through production to postproduction, and explain how each stage informs what we see on the screen. Describe how the mechanisms of film distribution determine what films we can see as well as when and how we can see them.\n\nAnalyze how film promotion predisposes us to see certain films and to see them in certain ways. Evaluate the ways in which film exhibition both structures and is influenced by audience reception. Explain the ways in which media convergence and rapid technological advances are aﬀecting all aspects of the film experience, from production to consumption.\n\nProduction: How Films Are Made The aim at each step of ﬁlmmaking is to create an artistic and commercial product that will engage, please, or provoke viewers. In short, ﬁlm production is a multilayered activity in which industry, art, technology, and imagination intertwine. It describes the different stages — from the ﬁnancing and scripting of a ﬁlm to its ﬁnal edit and the addition of production credits naming the companies and individuals involved — that contribute to the construction of a movie. Does the ﬁlm showcase the work of the director or the screenwriter? The cinematographer or the composer of the musical score? How do the answers to these questions affect viewers’ perspectives on the ﬁlm? Although some ﬁlms highlight certain dimensions of ﬁlmmaking more than others, the production process almost always anticipates an audience and implies a certain kind of viewer. Therefore, understanding the production process allows us to better appreciate and effectively analyze ﬁlms.\n\nPreproduction Although the word production describes the entire process of making a ﬁlm, a great deal happens — and o en a long time passes — before a ﬁlm begins to be shot. Preproduction is the phase when a ﬁlm project is in development. In narrative ﬁlmmaking (scripted ﬁlms; see also Chapter 7), the efforts of the screenwriter, producer, and\n\nsometimes director — o en in the context of a studio or an independent production company — combine at this stage to conceive and reﬁne an idea for a ﬁlm. Funds are raised, rights are secured, a crew is assembled, casting decisions are made, and key aspects of the ﬁlm’s design (including location scouting and the construction of sets and costumes) are developed during the preproduction phase. Documentary ﬁlmmakers might conduct archival or location research, investigate their subject, and conduct interviews during this period.\n\nScreenwriters A screenwriter (or scriptwriter) is o en the individual who generates the idea for a narrative ﬁlm, either as an original concept or as an adaptation of another source (such as a novel, true story, or comic book). The screenwriter presents that early concept or material in a treatment, a short prose description of the action of a ﬁlm and major characters of the story, written before the screenplay. The treatment is then gradually expanded to a complete screenplay (or script) — the text from which a movie is made, including dialogue and information about action, settings, shots, and transitions. This undergoes several versions, from the temporary screenplay submitted by the screenwriter to the ﬁnal shooting script that details exact scenes and camera setups. As these different scripts evolve, one writer may be responsible for every version, or different writers may be employed at each stage,\n\nresulting in minor and sometimes major changes along the way. Even with a ﬁnished and approved script, in the studio context an uncredited script doctor may be called in to do rewrites. From Sunset Boulevard (1950), about a struggling screenwriter trapped in the mansion of a fading silent ﬁlm star, to Their Finest (2016), about a female screenwriter’s struggles to script a propaganda ﬁlm about the heroic evacuation of Dunkirk during World War II, numerous ﬁlms have found drama in the process of screenwriting itself [Figure 1.1]. One reason may be the dramatic shi s and instabilities in the process of moving from a concept to a completed screenplay to a produced ﬁlm, a process that highlights the difﬁculties of trying to communicate an individual vision to an audience.\n\n1.1 Their Finest (2016). A story set in World War II during the British evacuation of Dunkirk, France, the film focuses on a young woman screenwriter (Gemma Arterton) whose personal strength and writing skills describe a diﬀerent kind of heroism, one that is particularly associated with the contribution of women during that war.\n\nProducers and Studios The key individuals in charge of movie production and ﬁnances are a ﬁlm’s producers. A producer oversees each step of a ﬁlm project, especially the ﬁnancial aspects, from development to postproduction and a distribution deal. At times, a producer may be fully involved with each step of ﬁlm production from the selection and development of a script to the creation of an advertising campaign for the ﬁnished ﬁlm. At other times, a producer may be an almost invisible partner who is responsible principally for ﬁnancing a movie. On some ﬁlms, the director, screenwriter, or actors also serve as producers. Producers are extremely powerful in studio systems, a term that describes the industrial practices of large ﬁlm production companies in Hollywood and in other national ﬁlm industries. The Hollywood studio era extended from the 1920s through the 1950s. During this time, producers o en had signiﬁcant input into creative decisions. For example, production supervisor Irving B. Thalberg and studio mogul Louis B. Mayer strongly inﬂuenced the creative direction of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), one of the largest and most proﬁtable studios. Meanwhile, producer David O. Selznick le MGM and founded his own studio, where he controlled all stages of production, beginning with the identiﬁcation of the primary material for ﬁlms. For instance, he acquired Gone with the Wind as a property even before the novel was published. Selznick supervised\n\nevery aspect of the 1939 ﬁlm version of the best-seller, even changing directors during production — a process documented in his famous production memos. Since the end of the studio system, producers of Hollywood ﬁlms continue to be heavily involved with ﬁnancing, but in most cases today, they no longer have the same level of creative control. The Hollywood production model is not the only one. For example, producers of independent ﬁlms from the 1990s onward have o en taken a different sort of role and have worked to facilitate the creative freedom of the writer and director, arranging the ﬁnancing for the ﬁlm as well as hiring a cast and crew, scheduling, shooting, postproduction (the period in the ﬁlmmaking process that occurs a er principal photography has been completed, usually consisting of editing, sound, and visual effects work), and distribution. For example, producer James Schamus ﬁrst worked with Ang Lee on the independent ﬁlm Eat Drink Man Woman (1994) and cowrote the screenplays of Sense and Sensibility (1995), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), and Taking Woodstock (2009). As vice president of Focus Features (a specialty division of Universal), Schamus shepherded Lee’s Brokeback Mountain (2005) through all stages of production. Regardless of the size or type of ﬁlm being made, distinctions among the tasks and roles of types of producers exist. In recent years, an executive producer may be connected to a ﬁlm primarily\n\nin name, playing a role in ﬁnancing or facilitating a ﬁlm deal and having little creative or technical involvement. On a documentary, an executive producer might work with a television channel commissioning the program, a streaming site such as Netﬂix, public funding agencies like the National Endowment for the Arts, or even private donors. A coproducer credit may designate an investor or an executive with a particular production company who helped fund the movie but may have had no role in its actual production. The line producer is in charge of the daily business of tracking costs and maintaining the production schedule of a ﬁlm, while a unit production manager is responsible for reporting and managing the details of receipts and purchases. The budget of a ﬁlm, whether big or minuscule, is handled by the producers. In budgeting, above-the-line expenses are the initial costs of contracting the major personnel, such as directors and stars, as well as administrative and organizational expenses in setting up a ﬁlm production. Below-the-line expenses are the technical and material costs — costumes, sets, transportation, and so on — involved in the actual making of a ﬁlm. Production values demonstrate how the quality of the ﬁlm’s images and sounds reﬂects the extent of these two expenses. In both subtle and not-so-subtle ways, production values o en shape viewers’ expectations about a ﬁlm. High production values suggest a more spectacular or more professionally made movie. Low production values do not necessarily mean a poorly made ﬁlm. In both cases, we need to adjust our expectations to the style associated with the budget.\n\nFinancing Film Production Financing and managing production expenses is a critical ingredient in making a movie. Traditionally, studios and producers have worked with banks or large ﬁnancial institutions to acquire this ﬁnancing, and the term bankable has emerged as a way of indicating that a ﬁlm has the necessary ingredients — such as a famous star or well-known literary source — to make that investment worth the risk. A mainstream action movie like Suicide Squad (2016), starring Will Smith, might cost well over $100 million to produce — a signiﬁcant investment that assumes a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial return. Developed alongside the conception of a ﬁlm, therefore, is a plan to ﬁnd a large enough audience to return that investment and, ideally, a proﬁt. Some ﬁlms follow a less typical ﬁnancing path. Kevin Smith made Clerks (1994) by charging expenses to various credit cards. The 1990s saw a rise in independent ﬁlm as ﬁnancing strategies changed. Instead of relying on a single source such as a bank or a studio, independent ﬁlmmaking is ﬁnanced by organized groups of individual investors or presales of distribution or broadcast rights in different markets. In the absence of studio backing, an independent ﬁlm must appeal to potential investors with a known quantity, such as the director’s reputation or the star’s box-ofﬁce clout. Even then, fundraising is o en challenging. Although major star Julianne Moore was attached to Lisa Cholodenko’s project The Kids Are All\n\nRight (2010) for ﬁve years, raising the ﬁlm’s $4 million budget was difﬁcult [Figure 1.2]. Filmmakers as successful as Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing, 1989) and Zach Braff (Garden State, 2004) have turned to the Kickstarter website to raise funding for recent projects.\n\n1.2 The Kids Are All Right (2010). A modestly budgeted independent production usually requires name stars to attract financing. Even with cast members committed, however, Lisa Cholodenko’s comedic drama about lesbian parents took years to produce.\n\nNonﬁction ﬁlms also require ﬁnancing. Documentaries may be sponsored by an organization, produced by a television channel, or funded by a combination of individual donors and public funds.\n\nCasting Directors and Agents\n\nWith the increasing costs of ﬁlms and the necessity of attracting money with a bankable project, the roles of casting directors and agents have become more important. Traditionally the work of a casting director, the practice of identifying the actors who would work best in particular scripted roles emerged during the advent of the star system around 1910. Around this time, Florence Lawrence, the exceedingly popular star of Biograph Studio who was known as the “Biograph Girl,” ﬁrst demanded to be named and given a screen credit. Since then, o en in consultation with directors, producers, and writers, casting directors have become bigger and more widely credited players in determining the look and scale of ﬁlms as they revolve around the cast of stars and actors in those ﬁlms. Agents represent actors, directors, writers, and other major individuals in a ﬁlm production. They negotiate with writers, casting directors, and producers and enlist different personnel for a movie. The signiﬁcance and power of the agent extends back at least to the 1930s, when talent agent Lew Wasserman, working as a publicist for the Music Corporation of America (MCA), began to create independent, multiple-movie deals for Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, James Stewart, and many others. By the mid-1950s, Wasserman and others had established a package-unit approach to ﬁlm production whereby the agent, producer, and casting director determine a script, stars, and other major personnel as a key ﬁrst step in a major production, establishing the production model that would dominate a er the demise of the traditional studio system. From the mid1970s through the 1990s, so-called superagents would sometimes\n\npredetermine a package of stars and other personnel from which a ﬁlm must be constructed. In the heyday of superagents, Michael Ovitz wielded extraordinary power and control, assembling movie production packages around Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Madonna, and Robert De Niro for ﬁlms such as Jurassic Park (1993), Tootsie (1982), and Goodfellas (1990).\n\nLocations, Production Design, Sets, and Costumes In narrative ﬁlms, the interaction between characters and the physical location of the action is o en a central dimension of a ﬁlm; hence, choices about location and set design are critical. Likewise, documentary ﬁlmmaking depends on location as well — from the record of a strike in Harlan County, U.S.A. (1976) to nature documentaries like Planet Earth II (2016) — but it also uses sets for interviews. Location scouts became commonplace in the early twentieth century. These individuals determine and secure places that provide the most suitable environment for shooting different movie scenes. Choosing a location is o en determined by a series of pragmatic questions: Does the place ﬁt the requirements of the script, and how expensive would it be to ﬁlm at this location? Many ﬁlms rely on constructed sets that re-create a speciﬁc place, but the desire for movie realism o en results in the use of actual locations to\n\ninvigorate a scene. Thus the Lord of the Rings (2001–2003) and Hobbit trilogies (2012–2014) take advantage of the lush and wild location ﬁlming in New Zealand, while Only Lovers Le Alive (2013) [Figure 1.3] makes the labyrinthine streets of Tangiers and the ravaged and vacated urban landscape of nighttime Detroit important backdrops for its tale about two emotionally impoverished and disenchanted vampires. In recent decades, the cinematic task of re-creating realseeming environments has shi ed to computer-graphics technicians. These technicians design the models to be digitally transferred onto ﬁlm, becoming, in a sense, a new kind of location scout.\n\n1.3 Only Lovers Le Alive (2013). Cities like Tangiers and Detroit become distinctive backgrounds for Jim Jarmusch’s moody, mordantly funny vampire story.\n\nThe production designer determines the ﬁlm’s overall look. Art directors are responsible for supervising the conception and construction of the physical environment in which actors appear, including sets, locations, props, and costumes. The set decorators complete the look of a set with the details. For example, in a movie set in a particular historical period and place, such as Argo (2012), the art department coordinated to create sets and locations that accurately reﬂected Tehran in 1980 and that also highlighted the suspenseful atmosphere surrounding the rescue of six Americans. The role of costume designers, those who plan and prepare how actors will be dressed as their characters, greatly increased as the movie business expanded in the 1930s. Costume designers ensure the splendor, suitability, and sometimes the historical accuracy of the movie characters’ appearances. Indeed, for those ﬁlms in which costumes and settings are central to the story — ﬁlms set in fantasy worlds or historical eras, such as Pan’s Labyrinth (2006), which uses both kinds of settings — one could argue that the achievement of the ﬁlm becomes inseparable from the decisions made about the art and costume design. In the end, successful ﬁlms integrate all levels of the design, from the sets to the costumes, as in The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), where the costumes re-create the 1930s in a luxurious hotel in Eastern Europe but have a zany excess and decadence that mirrors the plot and themes.\n\nProduction\n\nMost mythologized of all phases of moviemaking is production itself or principal photography, which is the majority of footage that is ﬁlmed. The weeks or months of actual shooting, on set or on location, are known as a ﬁlm shoot. Countless ﬁlms, from The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and Irma Vep (1996) to Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood (2019), dramatize inspired or fraught interactions among cast, crew, and the person in charge of it all, the director [Figure 1.4]. The reality of production varies greatly with the scale of the ﬁlm and its budget, but the director, who has o en been involved in all of the creative phases of preproduction, must now work closely with the actors and production personnel — most notably, the camera units headed by the cinematographer — to realize a collaborative vision.\n\n1.4 Irma Vep (1996). Maggie Cheung stars in a film about making a film — starring Maggie Cheung.\n\nThe Director The earliest ﬁlms of the twentieth century involved very few people in the process of shooting a ﬁlm, with the assumption that the cameraman was the de facto director. By 1907, however, a division of labor separated production roles, placing the director in charge of all others on the ﬁlm set. Today the director is commonly regarded as the chief creative presence and the primary manager in ﬁlm production, responsible for and overseeing virtually all the work of making a movie — guiding the actors, determining the position of the camera, and selecting which images appear in the ﬁnished ﬁlm. Directors have different methods and degrees of involvement. Alfred Hitchcock claimed he never needed to see the action through the camera viewﬁnder because his script directions were so precise that there would be only one way to compose the shot. Others are comfortable relinquishing important decisions to their assistant director (AD), cinematographer, or sound designer. Still others, like Woody Allen and Barbra Streisand, assume multiple roles (screenwriter, actor, and editor) in addition to that of director. In Hollywood during the studio era, when directors’ visions o en were subordinated to a “house style” or a producer’s vision, directors worked so consistently and honed their cra with such skilled\n\npersonnel that critics can detect a given director’s signature style across routine assignments. This has elevated directors like Howard Hawks (Bringing Up Baby, 1938, and His Girl Friday, 1940) and Nicholas Ray (Rebel Without a Cause, 1955) to the status of auteurs — directors who are considered “authors” of ﬁlms in which they express their own individual vision and experiences. Today a company backing a ﬁlm will choose or approve a director for projects that seem to ﬁt with his or her skills and talents. For example, Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón’s success with ﬁlms like A Little Princess (1995) and Great Expectations (1998) led to his early involvement with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). Because of the control and assumed authority of the director, contemporary viewers o en look for stylistic and thematic consistencies in ﬁlms by the same director, and ﬁlmmakers like Quentin Tarantino have become celebrities. This follows a model prevalent in art cinema made outside Hollywood in which the vision of a director like Jean-Luc Godard or Tsai Ming-liang (What Time Is It There?, 2001) is supported by the producer and made manifest in virtually every aspect of the ﬁlm.\n\nThe Cast, Cinematographer, and Other OnSet Personnel The director works with the actors to bring out the desired performance, and these collaborations vary greatly. Because ﬁlm\n\nscenes are shot out of order and in a variety of shot scales, the cast’s performance must be delivered in bits and pieces. Some actors prepare a technical performance; others rely on the director’s prompting or other, more spontaneous inspiration. Daniel DayLewis, the star of Lincoln (2012), There Will Be Blood (2007), and Phantom Thread (2017), is known for immersing himself in every role to such an extent that he stays in character throughout the entire production, even when the cameras are not rolling. David Fincher’s exacting directorial style requires scores of takes, or different versions of a shot, a grueling experience for Zodiac (2007) actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr. Some directors gravitate to particularly sympathetic and dynamic relations with actors — for example, Tim Burton with Johnny Depp, Pedro Almodóvar with Penelope Cruz, and Martin Scorsese with Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. The cinematographer, also known as the director of photography (DP), selects the cameras, ﬁlm stock, lighting, and lenses to be used as well as the camera setup or position. In consultation with the director, the cinematographer determines how the action will be shot, the images composed, and, later, the kind of exposure needed to print the takes. The cinematographer oversees a camera operator (who physically manipulates the camera) and other camera and lighting crew. Many ﬁlms owe more to the cinematographer than to almost any other individual in the production. Days of Heaven (1978) proﬁts as much from the eye of cinematographer Néstor Almendros\n\nas from the direction of Terrence Malick. Likewise, cinematographer Michael Ballhaus’s work on ﬁlms such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s The Marriage of Maria Braun (1979) and Martin Scorsese’s The Departed (2006) arguably displays the artistic singularity and vision that are usually assigned to ﬁlm directors [Figure 1.5].\n\n1.5 The Departed (2006). Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus suggests interpretations of the characters’ motives through shot composition and lighting.\n\nOther personnel are also on the set — including the production sound mixer (who is the sound engineer on the production set) and other sound crew, including the boom operator; the grips who install lighting and dollies; the special effects coordinator; the scenic, hair, and make-up artists; and the catering staff. A production coordinator helps this complex operation run smoothly. During the shoot, the director reviews dailies (footage shot that day) and begins to make selects (takes that are chosen to use in editing a\n\nscene). A er principal photography is completed, sets are broken down, and the ﬁlm “wraps,” or completes production. A ﬁlm shoot is an intense, concentrated effort in which the contributions of visionary artists and professional crew mesh with schedule and budget constraints.\n\nPostproduction Some of the most important aspects of a ﬁnished ﬁlm — including editing, sound, and visual effects — are achieved a er principal photography is completed and production is over. How deﬁnitive or efﬁcient the process is depends on many factors. A documentary may be constructed almost entirely during this phase, or a commercial feature ﬁlm may have to be recut in response to test screenings or the wishes of a new executive who has assumed authority over the project.\n\nEditing and Sound The director works closely with the editor and his or her staff during editing — the process of selecting and joining ﬁlm footage and shots into a ﬁnished ﬁlm with a distinctive style and rhythm. This process now is largely carried out with digital footage and computer-based editing. Editing is anticipated during preproduction of ﬁction ﬁlms with the preparation of a shooting script, and in production it is recognized in the variety and number of takes provided. Only a\n\nfraction of the footage that is shot is included in the ﬁnished ﬁlm, making editing crucial to its ﬁnal form. In documentary production, editing may be the most important stage in shaping the ﬁlm. When the editing is completed, the picture is said to be locked. Postproduction also includes complex processes for editing sound and adding special effects. A sound editor oversees the work of sound editing — combining music, dialogue, and effects tracks to interact with the image track. Less apparent than the editing of images, sound editing can create noises that relate directly to the action of the image (such as matching the image of a dog barking), underpin those images and actions with music (such as the pounding beats that follow an army into battle), or insert sounds that counterpoint the images in ways that complicate their meanings (such as using a religious hymn to accompany the ﬂight of a missile). In the sound mixing process, all of the elements of the soundtrack — music, effects, and dialogue — are combined and adjusted to their ﬁnal levels.\n\nSpecial Eﬀects Special effects are techniques that enhance a ﬁlm’s realism or surpass assumptions about realism with spectacle. Whereas some special effects are prepared in preproduction (such as the building of elaborate models of futuristic cities), others can be generated in\n\nproduction (with special camera ﬁlters or setups) or created on set (for example, by using pyrotechnics). Today most special effects are created in postproduction and are distinguished by the term visual effects — imagery combined with live action footage by teams of computer technicians and artists. In the contemporary digital age, computer technicians have virtually boundless postproduction capabilities to enhance and transform an image. Fantastical scenes and characters can be acted out using green-screen technology, in which actors perform in front of a plain green background; and motion-capture technology, which transfers the actors’ physical movements to computer-generated imagery (CGI), such as Andy Serkis as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–2003). The settings of the Star Wars sequel trilogy (2015–2019) were generated largely in postproduction [Figure 1.6]. All of the personnel who work behind the scenes on these many levels of ﬁlmmaking are acknowledged when the titles and credits are added in the ﬁnal stage of postproduction.\n\n1.6 Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi (2017). Although the original Star Wars films used multiple sets, models, and props, much of the sequel series was generated using state-ofthe-art computer technology.\n\nDistribution: What We Can See The completed ﬁlm reaches its audience through the process of distribution, in which ﬁlms are provided to venues including theaters and video stores, broadcast and cable television, internet streaming and video on demand (VOD), libraries and classrooms — even hotels and airlines. Despite these many outlets for distribution, many worthy ﬁlms never ﬁnd a distributor and are never seen. As avenues of distribution multiply, new questions about the role of ﬁlm culture in our individual and collective experience arise. Our tastes, choices, and opportunities are shaped by aspects of the industry of which we may be unaware, and we, in turn, inﬂuence the kinds of ﬁlms that distributors choose to release. The discussion that follows, which emphasizes the U.S. feature-ﬁlm distribution system since it o en controls even foreign theaters, explores how viewers are prepared by the social and economic machinery of distribution. Some contemporary companies, such as Netﬂix, Amazon, Hulu, and Disney, occupy dual roles as both distributors and producers of ﬁlms. Thus, the line between the two operations begins to blur — as does the relation between production and exhibition (see also Movie Exhibition: The Where, When, and How of Movie Experiences later in this chapter).\n\nDistributors\n\nA distributor is a company or an agency that acquires the rights to a movie from the ﬁlmmakers or producers (sometimes by contributing to the costs of producing the ﬁlm) and makes the movie available to audiences by renting, selling, or licensing it to theaters or other exhibition outlets. Top-grossing distributors today include Walt Disney, Warner Bros., Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal, Paramount Pictures, and Lionsgate. Smaller companies include A24, Magnolia Pictures, and divisions of both Netﬂix and Amazon. The types of ﬁlms that are produced depend on what Hollywood and other ﬁlm cultures assume can be successfully distributed. Film history has been marked with regular battles and compromises between ﬁlmmakers and distributors about what audiences are willing to watch. Michael Cimino’s 1980 ﬁlm Heaven’s Gate has become an infamous example: with an unprecedented budget of over $40 million, the completed version of the ﬁlm was over four hours long, severely complicating how the ﬁlm could be distributed and provoking harsh reviews from critics and audiences. Decades earlier, Orson Welles’s The Magniﬁcent Ambersons (1942) faced similar problems when studio heads determined that they needed to cut over an hour from the 135-minute movie in order to distribute it successfully.\n\nEvolution of the Feature Film\n\nConsider the following examples of how the prospects for distributing and exhibiting a ﬁlm can inﬂuence and even determine its content and form, including decisions about its length. From around 1911 to 1915, D. W. Grifﬁth and other ﬁlmmakers struggled to convince movie studios to allow them to expand the length of a movie from roughly ﬁ een minutes to over 100 minutes. Although longer ﬁlms imported from Europe achieved some success, most producers felt that it would be impossible to distribute longer movies because they believed audiences would not sit still for more than twenty minutes. Grifﬁth persisted and continued to stretch the length of his ﬁlms, insisting that new distribution and exhibition patterns would create and attract new audiences — those willing to accept more complex stories and to pay more for them. In the end, Grifﬁth proved to be right: his three-hour epic, The Birth of a Nation (1915), was both an enormous commercial and ﬁnancial success and a major cultural event, comparable to a traditional theatrical or operatic experience. Perhaps because of this success, the ﬁlm also unleashed major debate and protests about its racist representations of African Americans and its depiction of the Ku Klux Klan as heroic saviors [Figure 1.7]. The ﬁlm nonetheless became a benchmark in overturning one distribution formula, which offered a continuous program of numerous short ﬁlms, and establishing a new one, which concentrated on a single feature ﬁlm, a longer narrative movie that is the primary attraction for audiences.\n\n1.7 Advertisement for The Birth of a Nation (1915). The ambitious nature of D. W. Griﬀith’s controversial epic was apparent in its advertisements and unprecedented three-hour running time.\n\nDescription The advertisement shows John Wilkes Booth armed with a gun, jumping off a balcony. Three men try to stop him as a woman tends to President Lincoln seated in the balcony. The U. S. flag is draped around the railing of the balcony. Text at the right-center reads, “Lincoln’s Assassination. The fatal blow that robbed the South of its best friend.” The text below reads, D. W. Griffith’s Mighty Spectacle, The Birth of a Nation, founded on Thomas Dixon’s ‘The Clansman.’\n\nA er 1915, most ﬁlms were distributed with ninety-to 120-minute running times, and this pattern has proved durable. Sometimes, studios produce epic ﬁlms with unusually long running times — from Gone with the Wind (1939) to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) — which may be perceived by audiences as more important or more serious than the average movie because of their length. In a different manner, serial or sequel ﬁlms can present an extremely long narrative as part of an episodic viewing experience, as with the television distribution of the three Godfather ﬁlms (1972– 1990) or the eight Harry Potter movies (2001–2011), allowing viewers to watch and absorb a lengthy and highly complex story periodically.\n\nOur experience of a movie — its length, its choice of stars (over unknown actors, for example), its subject matter, and even its title — is determined by decisions made about distribution before the ﬁlm becomes available to viewers. Most movies are produced to be distributed to certain kinds of audiences. Distribution patterns — whether a movie is available everywhere for everyone at the same time, is released during the holiday season, or is available only in specialty video stores or on speciﬁc streaming sites — bring expectations that a particular ﬁlm either fulﬁlls or frustrates.\n\nRelease Strategies As one of its primary functions, distribution determines the number of copies of a ﬁlm that will be available and the number of locations at which the movie will be seen. During the heyday of the Hollywood studio system, studios either showed their ﬁlms in their own theater chains or sold them to theaters in packages, a practice known as block booking. Under the block booking model, studios required theaters to show cheaper, less desirable ﬁlms as a condition of booking the star-studded A pictures. This practice was the target of antitrust legislation and ﬁnally was outlawed in the 1948 Supreme Court decision United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., which divorced the studios from their theater chains and required that ﬁlms be sold individually. Before and a er 1948, distribution strategies have sometimes kicked off with a premiere — a red carpet event celebrating the opening night of a movie that is attended by\n\nstars and attracts press attention. A ﬁlm’s initial opening in a limited number of ﬁrst-run theaters (theaters that show recently released movies) as exclusive engagements gradually was expanded, allowing for a series of premieres. In 1975, Steven Spielberg’s Jaws introduced the practice of wide release, opening in hundreds of theaters simultaneously. In these cases, a ﬁlm with a mass circulation of premieres — sometimes referred to as saturation booking or a saturated release — is screened in as many locations as possible in the United States (and increasingly abroad) as soon as possible. For a blockbuster such as Avengers: Endgame (2019), the distributors immediately release the movie in a maximum number of locations and theaters to attract large audiences before its novelty wears off. This distribution tactic usually promises audiences a ﬁlm that is easy to understand and appeals to most tastes (for example, offering action sequences, breathtaking special effects, or a light romance rather than controversial topics). A limited release may be distributed only to major cities — the cult comedy Wet Hot American Summer (2001) never played in more than thirty theaters — and then expand its distribution, depending on the ﬁlm’s initial success. Audience expectations for ﬁlms following a limited release pattern are generally less ﬁxed than for wide releases. These ﬁlms usually will be recognized in terms of the previous work of the director or an actor, but they will offer a\n\ncertain novelty or experimentation (such as a controversial subject or a strange plot twist) that presumably will be better appreciated as the ﬁlm is publicly debated and understood through the reviews and discussions that follow its initial release. The Weinstein Company’s decision to limit the release of Todd Haynes’s experimental biopic of Bob Dylan, I’m Not There (2007), to major cities was a strategic bid to maximize critical attention to the ﬁlm’s daring and the intriguing premise of its star performances, which include Cate Blanchett playing the 1960s Dylan. As part of these general practices, distribution strategies have developed over time to shape or respond to the interests and tastes of intended audiences. Platforming involves releasing a ﬁlm in gradually widening markets and theaters so that it slowly builds its reputation and momentum through reviews and word of mouth. The strategy for expanding a release depends on box-ofﬁce performance: if a ﬁlm does well in its opening weekend, it will open in more cities on more screens. When the low-budget supernatural horror ﬁlm Paranormal Activity (2007) was acquired and released by Paramount, audiences became directly involved in determining where the ﬁlm would open by voting on director Oren Peli’s website. Independent ﬁlms also use platforming as a strategy. For example, Jonathan Caouette’s Tarnation (2003) — which does not use a conventional screenplay and was edited on a home computer with an alleged production budget of about $200 — screened at the\n\nSundance Film Festival with John Cameron Mitchell and Gus Van Sant as executive producers. This publicity led to other festival invitations, a distribution deal for a limited theatrical release, and considerable critical attention. A movie also can be distributed for special exclusive release, premiering in only one or two locations. A dramatic example of this strategy was the restored version of Abel Gance’s silent classic Napoléon, an epic tale of the life of the French emperor that periodically presents the action simultaneously on three screens. The original ﬁlm premiered in April 1927. In 1981, the exclusive release of the restored ﬁlm toured to one theater at a time, accompanied by a full orchestra; seeing it became a privileged event.\n\nTarget Audiences Since the late twentieth century, movies have been distributed with an eye toward reaching speciﬁc target audiences — viewers whom producers feel are most likely to want to see a particular ﬁlm. Producers and distributors aimed Sha (1971), an action ﬁlm with a black hero, at African American audiences by distributing it primarily in large urban areas. Distributors positioned T2 Trainspotting (2017), a hip sequel about former heroin users returning to their lives in Edinburgh, to draw art-house and younger audiences in cities, some suburbs, and college and university towns.\n\nThe original Nightmare on Elm Street movies (1984–2010), a violent slasher series about the horriﬁc Freddy Krueger, were aimed primarily at the male teenage audience who frequented cineplexes and, later, video stores. The various distribution strategies all imply important issues about how movies should be viewed and understood. First, by controlling the scope of distribution, these strategies determine the quality and importance of an audience’s interactions with a ﬁlm. As a saturated release, the 2015 attempt to restart the Fantastic Four series aimed for swi gratiﬁcation with a focus on special effects and action, before disappointed word of mouth could spread. On the other hand, Green Book (2018) was platformed gradually and beneﬁted from critical reﬂections on the relationship it depicts between a black classical pianist touring the U.S. south and his white workingclass driver [Figure 1.8].\n\n1.8 Green Book (2018). Platforming this modestly budgeted film cultivated audiences and critical responses.\n\nSecond, distribution can identify primary, intended responses to the ﬁlm as well as secondary, unexpected ones. Movies from the Pixar animation studio might resonate the most with children and their parents, with stories like Inside Out (2015), Finding Dory (2016), and Toy Story 4 (2019) [Figure 1.9] that address childhood and the process of parenting, with inside jokes and references for adults. But as Pixar has established itself as a source of high-quality animation, their adult following has grown — including former kids who grew up on the company’s early movies and now continue to see followups with their favorite characters even as they age out of the primary audience but remain part of the target audience. Awareness of these strategies of targeting indicates how our identiﬁcation with and comprehension of ﬁlms are as much a product of our social and cultural locations as they are a product of the ﬁlm’s subject matter and form.\n\n1.9 Toy Story 4 (2019). This computer-animated film is aimed principally at families, but childless audiences may still find plenty to identify with.\n\nAncillary Markets Commercial cinema’s reach has been expanding ever since studios began to take advantage of television’s distribution potential in the mid-1950s. New technologies for watching movies continue to proliferate. In addition to commercial television, ﬁlms have been distributed via home video formats (like VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray) and video on demand (VOD), which includes online streaming services like Netﬂix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney Plus. Today more of a ﬁlm’s revenue is generated by such ancillary markets than by its initial theatrical release.\n\nBroadcast and Cable Television Distribution\n\nOriginally, the motion picture industry competed with broadcasting, which distributed entertainment directly to the home through radio and later television. However, as television became popular in postwar America, ﬁlm studios realized that the new medium provided an unprecedented distribution outlet. Later, with the rise of cable television, studios gained even more lucrative opportunities to sell their vast libraries of ﬁlms. The launch of dedicated movie channels like Turner Classic Movies, for example, were a boon to cinema lovers. As both network and cable channels proliferated, more and more movies began to be presented through television distribution. In an attempt to reach specialized audiences through subscription cable, distributors like IFC Films have made critically acclaimed foreign and U.S. independent ﬁlms available on demand the same day they are released in art-house theaters in major cities, allowing television audiences in markets outside large cities access to such works as the Romanian 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days (2007), winner of the Cannes Film Festival’s top prize. Although the traditional wisdom is that such access will hurt the theatrical box ofﬁce, the strategy allows such ﬁlms to reach wider audiences, and positive word of mouth, for both the ﬁlm and the distributor’s “brand,” might enhance overall theatrical revenue. Guaranteed television distribution can also reduce the ﬁnancial risk for producers and ﬁlmmakers and thus, in some situations, allow\n\nfor more experimentation or ﬁlmmaker control. Starting in the 1990s, (subscription) cable channels such as HBO increasingly began producing their own ﬁlms that included riskier subjects. Even though these ﬁlms are presented on the cable channels, a theatrical window for the ﬁlm to receive reviews and become eligible for awards is sometimes allowed.\n\nWas the movie recently screened for class likely to have been shown on television? If so, in what way? How might such distribution have significantly changed its look or feel?\n\nTelevision distribution has both positive and negative implications. In some cases, ﬁlms on television must adjust their style and content to suit constraints of both time and space. For ﬁlms originally made for theatrical distribution, scenes might be cut to ﬁt a time slot or be interrupted with commercial breaks. In other cases, television distribution may expand the ways movies can communicate with audiences and experiment with different visual forms. For example, The Singing Detective (1986) — made explicitly for BBC distribution in the United Kingdom — uses the long length of a television series watched within the home as the means to explore and think about the passage of time, the difﬁculty of memory, and the many levels of reality and consciousness woven into our daily lives. Meanwhile, Ken Burns’s documentary The\n\nVietnam War (2017) uses its episodic ten-part distribution to investigate o en overlooked details and facts of that controversial war from multiple angles, too numerous for a theatrical ﬁlm.\n\nHome Video and Video on Demand Each new format for the public or private consumption of media — VHS (video home system), LaserDisc, DVD (digital video disk), Bluray, and video on demand (VOD), including today’s streaming services like Netﬂix — has offered a new distribution challenge for media makers and a potential new revenue model for rights holders. Independent producers may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to transfer existing media to new formats or to make enough sales for a particular avenue of distribution to be viable. As with distribution through theaters and through broadcast and cable television, distribution of home video formats and video on demand determines the availability of particular titles to audiences. Viewers may stream a ﬁlm online, rent or purchase it in a store, receive it by mail from companies like Netﬂix, or order it from independent distributors such as Kino Lorber. Historically, there was a speciﬁc lag time between a ﬁlm’s theatrical release in a cinema and its release on home video, but these relationships have changed over time. Some movies are distributed direct to home video, skipping the traditional theatrical release altogether, such as the ongoing series of follow-ups to Bring It On\n\n(2000). Whether a movie is released on home video a er its theatrical run or is made expressly for home video, this type of distribution usually aims to reach the largest possible audience and thus to increase revenues. As new technologies emerge, distributors frequently engage in “format wars,” in which different companies offer competing versions of similar products. For example, the home video era began in the 1980s with competition between Sony’s Beta format and VHS. The VHS format won out, and with the widespread use of videocassette recorders (VCRs), studios released ﬁlms on VHS cassettes, ﬁrst for rental and then increasingly for sales. A similar battle took place in the mid-2000s between high-deﬁnition DVD (HDDVD, backed by Toshiba) and Blu-ray (backed by Sony); in the end, Blu-ray prevailed. Typically, as in these two cases, one format ends up dominating the market and becomes the primary distribution channel through which viewers experience ﬁlms at home during that time period. One of the most signiﬁcant challenges to distributors posed by home video and video on demand is piracy, the unauthorized duplication and circulation of copyrighted material. Despite anticopying so ware, the circulation of pirated ﬁlms is widespread and can bypass social, cultural, and legal controls, bringing banned ﬁlms to viewers in China, for example, or building subcultures and networks around otherwise hard-to-access ﬁlms.\n\nBefore the closing of many video stores caused by the shi to subscriber and on-demand services in the 2000s, the video store was a signiﬁcant site of ﬁlm culture. Because the selection in rental stores was based on a market perspective on local audiences as well as the tastes of individual proprietors, some ﬁlms were distributed to certain cities or neighborhoods and excluded from other locations. The dominant chains (such as Blockbuster, which ﬁled for bankruptcy in 2010) focused on high-concentration, family-oriented shopping sites, offering numerous copies of current popular mainstream movies, as well as mainstream video games. They typically excluded daring subject matter or older titles. Some local independent video stores specialized in art ﬁlms, cult ﬁlms, or movie classics (such as those released on DVD by the Criterion Collection). Still other local stores depended on X-rated ﬁlms for their primary revenue. Sometimes in-store distribution followed cultural as well as commercial logic.
