The Gaucho (1927) [12]\n\n*Actress/Author **Author Only +Fragment Only ++One Extant Reel No Extant Material\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Several Biograph titles, including \"Examination Day at School,\" \"The Affair of an Egg,\" and \"The Usurer\" have erroneously been listed in Mary Pickford filmographies. I screened these titles (and a number of others) and the actress was not among the cast.\n\n[2] \"Through the Breakers\" (1909) is a title missing from a number of Pickford filmographies. I have identified her appearance as an extra in this film.\n\n[3] Pickford credits herself as author of two titles made by Selig. \"Unspoiled by Fame is Mary Pickford,\" The New York Dramatic Mirror, Mar 19, 1913, p. 28.\n\n[4] Two IMP titles, \"At the Duke's Command\" and \"From the Bottom of the Sea,\" that have appeared in a number of Pickford filmographies are notably absent here. I viewed MoMA's print of \"At the Duke's Command\" and confirmed Mary Pickford's absence from the cast. \"From the Bottom of the Sea\" is not extant,but Ethel Grandin is credited as playing the sweetheart. \"Letters and Questions,\"The New York Dramatic Mirror, Nov 29, 1911, p. 25. An image of Grandin from the film accompany's the review in The Moving Picture World, Nov 11, 1911, p. 454.\n\n[5] Given the information from the synopisis of the film found in Moving Picture News, Feb 11, 1911, p. 17, it is more than likely Pickford appeared here. \"Pictureland is unique in its way, and really two stories are photographed. The arrival of the \"IMP \" Company in Cuba, prepared to pose for films and the reception of the company are in the opening pictures. ...All of the well-known \"IMP\" stars appear in traveling costume, which is their first formal introduction in proper personae, an innovation which will be welcomed by their many admirers.\"\n\n[6] Film fan Scott Taylor rediscovered this IMP short on a Grapevine Video. Pickford was not mentioned in contemporary reviews or advertisements. The title has been missing from all previously published Pickford filmographies.\n\n[7] Mary Pickford is co-author of the screen play for \"Daddy-Long-Legs\" (1919).\n\n[8] Douglas Fairbanks production company The Elton Corporation co-produced this feature with the Mary Pickford Company.\n\n[9] Art Cinema (Joseph Schenck's company)produced \"Kiki\" not the Mary Pickford Company. Pickford took ownership of the title after Art Cinema dissolved in 1936.\n\n[10] A version titled \"One Hundred Percent Canadian\" (1918) was released in Canada.\n\n[11]Mary Pickford agreed to be in one scene of the Russian comedy \"Potselui Meri Pikford\" [A Kiss From Mary Pickford] during a visit to Russia in 1926. She also appears in the film, via newsreel footage, with husband Douglas Fairbanks.\n\n[12] Pickford makes a brief and unbilled appearance as the Virgin Mary."
