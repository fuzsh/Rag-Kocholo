        "text": "Milestone MCD-47017-2: Louis Armstrong and King Oliver [CD]\n\nLouis Armstrong's first recordings. The first 18 tracks are with Armstrong playing second cornet in King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band in 1923. The remaining 7 tracks are 1924 recordings of the Red Onion Jazz Babies, a predecessor group to the Hot Five that Armstrong recorded with after moving to New York and joining Fletcher Henderson's band. The Red Onion Jazz Babies included Sidney Bechet and wife Lil Armstrong and backed Alberta Hunter (recording under the pseudonym Josephine Beatty). The sound quality is about as good as could be expected from mechanical recordings, which is to say, they require a bit of getting used to.\n\nHowever, hearing these recordings is vital to understanding how groundbreaking the later Hot Five/Seven recordings were. While the Oliver band had a stiff, almost formal sound, the Hot Five/Seven had a much more earthy, swinging quality. The Oliver band performed primarily as an ensemble (usually with only short solo breaks) while the Hot Five/Seven recordings are largely vehicles for extended solos by Armstrong and his bandmates. The Hot Five/Seven were also helped by being largely recorded with new electronic techniques that offered much better fidelity and dynamic range.\n\nwww.amazon.com\n\nJust Gone (April 5, 1923)\n\nCanal Street Blues (April 5, 1923)\n\nMandy Lee Blues (April 5, 1923)\n\nI'm Going Away To Wear You Off My Mind (April 5, 1923)\n\nChime Blues (April 5, 1923)\n\nWeather Bird Rag (April 6, 1923)\n\nDipper Mouth Blues (April 6, 1923)\n\nFroggie Moore (April 6, 1923)\n\nSnake Rag (April 6, 1923)\n\nMabel's Dream (Early September, 1923?)\n\nMabel's Dream (Early September, 1923?)\n\nThe Southern Stomps (Early September, 1923?)\n\nThe Southern Stomps (Early September, 1923?)\n\nRiverside Blues (Early September, 1923?)\n\nAlligator Hop (October 5, 1923)\n\nZulu's Ball (October 5, 1923)\n\nWorkingman Blues (October 5, 1923)\n\nKrooked Blues (October 5, 1923)\n\nTexas Moaner Blues (November 8, 1924 (?))\n\nOf All The Wrongs You've Done To Me (November 8, 1924 (?))\n\nTerrible Blues (November 26, 1924)\n\nSanta Claus Blues (November 26, 1924)\n\nNobody Knows The Way I Feel This Morning (December 22, 1924)\n\nEarly Every Morn (December 22, 1924)\n\nCake Walking Babies From Home (December 22, 1924)\n\nColumbia CJ44441: Bessie Smith - The Collection [CD]\n\nA single CD collection that includes four of the nine sides that Armstrong with the \"Empress of the Blues.\"\n\nwww.amazon.com\n\nSt. Louis Blues (January 14, 1925)\n\nReckless Blues (January 14, 1925)\n\nYou've Been A Good Ole Wagon (January 14, 1925)\n\nI Ain't Gonna Play No Second Fiddle (if I Can't Play The Lead) (May 27, 1925)\n\nSony Bessie Smith 2: Bessie Smith - Complete Recordings, Vol. 2 (1924-1925) [CD]\n\nA two-CD set that includes all nine sides that Armstrong recorded in three sessions with the \"Empress of the Blues.\"\n\nlegacyrecordings.com\n\nSt. Louis Blues (January 14, 1925)\n\nReckless Blues (January 14, 1925)\n\nSobbin' Hearted Blues (January 14, 1925)\n\nCold In Hand Blues (January 14, 1925)\n\nYou've Been A Good Ole Wagon (January 14, 1925)\n\nNashville Woman's Blues (May 26, 1925)\n\nCareless Love Blues (May 26, 1925)\n\nJ.C.

Davies. Commonly regarded as the best sounding collection of the Hot Fives/Sevens. While there is more surface noise than the analogous collection from Sony/Columbia, they seem to have more \"life\" since Sony's Cedar noise reduction software also removes some of the harmonic distortion that give it life. Personally, I find the additional artifacts add to the nostalgic quality and make the recordings seem more real.\n\nwww.amazon.com\n\nMy Heart (November 12, 1925)\n\nYes!

Born August 6, 1902 on Careening Cay, an island in the archipelago of Bocas del Toro off the northwestern coast of Panama, Luis Carl Russell came to New Orleans in 1919. After studying piano with Steve Lewis and working with a band led by Albert Nicholas , Russell relocated to Chicago in 1924. In addition to regular work in bands led by King Oliver and Doc Cooke , Russell took the first steps towards assembling his own group and began making records as a leader in 1926. The following year Russell moved to New York, where he led an excellent big band featuring trumpeter Henry 'Red' Allen , trombonist J.C. Higginbotham , clarinetist Albert Nicholas, alto saxophonist Charlie Holmes and string bassist Pops Foster. Armstrong assumed nominal leadership of Russel's band from 1929-1930 and they reunited sporadically from 1935 - 1943.

A sprawling, marginally successful attempt to put Pops in a somewhat more contemporary setting. The album naming is confusing because it has been re-released by RCA as What A Wonderful World, which is apparently meant to capitalize on the posthumous popularity of the hit song that was part of an earlier album from 1968. The Wonderful World track is not the well-known version from 1968, but a more up-tempo version from 1970. \"We Shall Overcome\" is backed by a large all-star chorus that includes Miles Davis (that must have been something to hear!) and Tony Bennett, among others.\n\nwww.amazon.com\n\nMood Indigo (May 26, 1970)\n\nWhat A Wonderful World (May 26, 1970)\n\nMy One And Only Love (May 26, 1970)\n\nHis Father Wore Long Hair (May 27, 1970)\n\nEverybody's Talkin' (May 27, 1970)\n\nThe Creator Has A Master Plan (May 27, 1970)\n\nGive Peace A Chance (May 29, 1970, New York City)\n\nWe Shall Overcome (May 29, 1970, New York City)\n\nBoy From New Orleans (May 29, 1970, New York City)\n\nThis Black Cat Has Nine Lives (May 29, 1970, New York City)\n\nAvco Embassy AVE 33022: Louis Armstrong and the Nashville Cats(?)
