MOTION PICTURE NEWS Triangle Spells Dollars to These Men Hulsey, of Texas, doesn't think in nickels and dimes. He thinks in big sums — like a regular Texan. A hun- dred thousand a year won't stop Hulsey. So — his the- atres in Dallas, Waco, Galveston and Houston are all in the TRIANGLE now. And Jake Wells — everybody knows Wells. He has come into the TRIANGLE GARDEN, because he wants the best. So Richmond and Norfolk, will have TRIANGLE SERVICE. Costs don't worry Wells. He's after results. Simpson and Gordon, of Rochester, made a success of their Regent Theatre. But it wasn't big enough. Now they've bought a little insurance for more success —they've joined the TRIANGLE FAMILY. Out in Seattle, there's a man by the name of Jensen. You'll find him at the Liberty Theatre. Jensen will spend money if you can show him something worth while to spend it on. He's a TRIANGLE recruit — for nearly as much money as the President of the United States gets. TRIANGLE and success are interchangeable terms to these men — they investigated: then they bought.

Walthall depicts Poe's anguish over starving wife In a tumble down hut at Fordham, in the outskirts of New York City, Edgar Allan Poe sat by the bed of his dying wife. The snow sifted through the poor patched roof and broken door, and the midnight winds swept it in drifts across the floor. The beautiful young wife was wrapped in Poe's old army coat, her only covering. She needed warmth and food, but Poe was penniless. In the night hours he watched his adored wife, starv^- ing, shivering with cold, until death released her. His sensitive soul was torn with horror and despair. But his genius burned clear. Out of blood and anguish was born what has since been acknowledged as one of the greatest masterpieces of the English language — \"The Raven.\" Essanay has created a wonderfully artistic six act photoplay of \"The Raven,\" founded on Poe's life as pre- sented in the widely known novel and play by George C. Hazelton, and directed by Charles J. Brabin. HENRY B. WALTHALL, the living image of Poe, with Warda Howard, the great emotional actress, make of this masterpiece a drama that throbs with life and intense action. 1333 ARGYLE ST., CHICAGO George K.

DEARBORN STREET Volume XII NOVEMBER 6, 1915 No. 18 The Reviewer, The Producer and the Exhibitor THERE are so many false notions about what the re- viewing attitude of a trade paper toward pictures should be, that it is time some of these notions were exploded and exploded for good. One of these is, that any picture which violates the canons of art should be condemned. Another is, that every review should be a masterpiece of literary effort, in which is displayed in all its variegated completeness, the reviewer's \"preparedness\" on the English language. A third is, that the reviewer is infallible, and that any picture which he does not like, must, therefore, be a poor picture. The most pernicious of these is probably the last, and it is usually to be found in company with the second. We beg to disagree emphatically with each and all of these theories. * * * HTHE whole matter of trade reviewing can be summed up in these words : 1. The reviewer on a trade paper is, in reality, the projection room representative of the exhibitor. 2. As such, he is concerned first and principally, with ih^ box-office — that is, the money-making-possibilities, of the pictures he reviews. 3. The box-office success of a picture does not depend upon its artistic or theoretical perfection. 4. The reviewer's personal opinion of a picture is abso- lutely worthless, unless he is certain it will agree with the opinion of the thousands who will see that picture at their theatres. '> TTHE reviewer, we repeat, is the representative of the exhibitor in the producers' projection rooms. He is not writing to please the manufacturer. He is not writing to please himself. He is looking at every picture because the exhibitor cannot be there to see it himself, and it is his duty to see the picture as the exhibitor zi-oiild see it if he ivere there. Now the exhibitor is a business man. He is not an expert on high art. or on theories of dramatic construc- tion, or on philosophies of emotion and life. He is a busi- ness man — and his chief business is to know and to recog- nize at sight, what the people, to whom he caters, want. !k * * \"yHE men and women of the audience are not experts, ^ either, nor analysts, nor critics. They endorse a pic- ture, or condemn it, as a ivhole. They do not and cannot resolve it into its component parts, and weigh the value of each element in the total strength of the picture. They do not and cannot appraise it by abstract standards. They like a picture — or they don't like it. That is all. And over and over, audiences have applauded pictures which violated artistic dogmas, which were founded upon strained psychology, which have scandalized dramatic technicians because of their loose construction, which have been badly set, and indifferently acted — because they liked them, in spite of those weaknesses. And over and over again they have failed to be impressed by pictures which were sumptuously and correctly staged, admirably acted and satisfied every dramatic nicety— simply and solely be- cause they \"didn't like them,\" in spite of those elements of strength. ^ ^ ^ IN other words, a picture may violate, at a score of *■ points, the trained critic's sense of what a good picture should be, and pack the theatres — and a picture may be hailed as a masterpiece by the critics, and go begging for patronage. Art and success are quite independent of each other. When they meet it is an accident. When they don't, it is a misfortune. But the pubhc is the arbiter of success, and the public is not an art authority. It knows what it wants. H it can have that want supplied in an artistic manner, well and good. If not, art may whistle. It will have what it wants. ' * * * IF art were synonymous with success, Isadora Dun- can would have packed them in at the Century for a year, and \"Chin-Chin\" would have closed the first week. If art and success were inseparable, \"The Old Home- stead\" would have perished under a bhzzard of paper, and Percy Mackaye's blank verse dramas would be household words in every American home. It is such people the exhibitor is bound to represent. And it is such a public the trade reviewer must keep in mind in every review. * * * 'T'HIS means merely that cocksure condemnation of a picture, no matter how lofty the motive or how. artistic the balance in which it is weighed, is out of place the rez iew pages of a picture journal. There are millions of motion picture patrons, with all kinds of tastes for all kinds of pictures — with a leniency of judgment for detail, but a fastidious insistence that the total effect of the picture be to their liking. The best picture made will not satisfy every one of these millions; the poorest will find many receptive audiences among them. And what the public standard of judgment is, no man has ever discovered, so that he could reduce it to a formula, and turn out successes with mathematical certainty. (Continued on page 42.)

I TXDER such conditions, it is not for one reviewer, or any number of reviewers to condemn a picture be- fore it has reached and been passed upon by the public, whose opinion alone is worth anything to the exhibitor and the producer. This does not mean that every picture shall be uniformly praised. It does not mean that every fault shall be ignored. What it does mean is this : To the reviewers of a trade paper, every finished picture is first, a product to be marketed, and last, a work of art. As such, the main question to be answered by the trade reviewer is — will this picture make money for the ex- hibitor who books it, and how many possible reasons are there for supposing it will ? P\\OES it need to be repeated that this applies to the '-^ review pages, and to those alone? In editorials, in special articles, the journal can and should assail every weakness in the producing end of the business, and con- tinually demand progress and improvement in every depart- ment of the studio. But its reviews should not be converted into either editorials or special articles on these subjects, at the expense of a picture as yet untried by the public. This does not involve representing the picture to be something it is not. It is only emphasizing what the pic- ture is. It is, as a matter of fact, the one safeguard against that fatal attitude of mind into which all reviewers and critics are prone to fall— the attitude which assumes that, because a picture is not all it ought to be. it is commercially and to the public, worth nothing. * * * IN about four cases out of ten, it is self-evident that the picture, masterpiece or no masterpiece, will be a money- maker. When the reviewer has said so, he is through. In the other six, the exhibitor alone can be the judge. and he cannot always tell until he has tried it on an audience. When such a picture is to be reviewed, there is only one thing for the reviewer to do — inform the ex- hibitor of the picture's effect as a whole, of its contents, and its obzionsly strong and obviously weak features, and without pronouncing any verdict himself, leave the ex- hibitor to determine upon the entire evidence, not whether it is a good picture or a poor picture, but whether it is a good picture or a poor picture for his theatre. The reviewer may enumerate any catalogue of defects he pleases, but unless absolutely certain of his ground, he must not lead the exhibitor to beliez'e that anyone of these faults, or all of them combined, make it impossible for him to book and profit with that picture. * * * T^HIS is the only attitude a trade paper can assume, on its revieiv pages, in fairness to the producer and the exhibitor. On any other page in the magazine any propaganda for the uplift and improvement of pictures may be undertaken at any length, in any form. But never on the review pages, at the expense of any particular picture which still has a reputation and an income to earn for its producer. This in fairness to the exhibitor, be it repeated. For it is just as wrong to assure an exhibitor he cannot make money with a picture on which other exhibitors' ex- perience will prove that he can, as it is to assure him he can make money by booking a picture on which other ex- hibitors have lost, or will lose. * * * nrO see the picture as the exhibitor would see it if he were there — this is the whole duty of the trade reviewer in the projection room; this is and always has been the re- viewing policy of Motion Picture News. Stage Stars in Pictures \"\"PHE dramatic critic of a New York daily, who is quite distinct from his New York confreres in that he evi- dently studies pictures while he also criticizes them, makes a pertinent observation. Why, he asks, do not some eminent stage stars^ who appear in pictures perfect themselves in photoplay technic? The query is a timely one. The answer undoubtedly is that \"some\" stars not only do not take the picture seriously, but see no necessity for so doing. The attraction the picture offers is the salary given, as one star frankly admitted just the other day. As a vehicle for the expression of their art, they do not comprehend and hence do not recognize the motion picture. * * * VY7HICH state of affairs is not only unfortunate for ^ the pictures in which such stars appear, but also and decidedly unfortunate for the stars themselves. The picture, it would seem, can stand the results of this strange lack of understanding far better than the stars who are guilty of it. A noted prima donna recently scored a dramatic triumph in a picture. Her acting is splendid and the whole reason for her success is summed up in her own sincere statement, that she found in motion photography a freer, better medium of expression than the operatic stage. She acts because she knows and feels her medium. The consequences of this understanding of and de- votion to her work in pictures are not only contributory to motion picture art, but. and in a marked degree, to the prima donna's owm reputation and popularity. Wherein lies a lesson for \"some\"\" stars who appear — not to their own best credit — in motion pictures. Table of contents will hereafter be found every week opposite inside back cover.

MOTIONPICTURENEWS 43 Kansas Will Present Solid Front Against Censorship As Outcome of the State Convention Held in Pittsburg on October 18-19, Exchange Men and Exhibitors Form the Amusement Association of Kansas, Which Will Take the Active Work of Fighting for Saner Censor Laws from the Shoulders of the League special to Motion Picture NsN'fe Kansas Citj', Oct. 26. THE Amusement Association of Kansas, an organization of exhibitors and exchange men, was the outcome of the convention of the Motion Picture Ex- hibitors League of America, Kansas Branch, and the Film Exchange Men's Association of Kansas City, that was held in Pittsburg, Kansas, on October 18 and 19. This new association will take the active v/ork from the shoulders of the league and the exchange men's association in their fight against unfair censorship that is now being enforced in the Western state. The plans for it were worked out by big men who have been against the censorship law as it is practiced here. It has been said that the Kansas exhibitors have been lax and that it was a hard matter to get them to attend a convention, but this time they turned out in full force, and along with the assistance of the exchange men of Kansas City that went in a body, the new association was formed. It went with a vim when it was mentioned that the two organizations should combine in their efforts to secure a saner censorship in the state of Kansas, where conditions have reached an almost intolerable condi- tion in the way of expenses for the censor- ing of pictures for exhibition in that state. It was pointed out by one of the exhibitors that his tax, in which was included the cost of censoring, averaged about 40 per cent, on his investment. It is conditions like these that will have to be overcome, and it is the object of the new organization to overcome them. At an open meeting the first day of the convention it was suggested that a commit- tee be appointed from those who were pres- ent to devise ways and means of getting the exhibitors and exchange men together for the purpose of combating the censorship law in its present form. Committee Appointed A committee composed of E. R. Pearson, Kansas City manager of V-L-S-E; Charles Harden, Fox Film Corporation's manager in Kansas City ; Ross C. Cropper, manager of the Universal Film and Supply Company of Kansas City; P. J. Concannon, an ex- hibitor from Emporia ; Fred Savage, an ex- hibitor from Hutchinson, and W. M. Wil- leys, an exhibitor from Mulberry, took this in hand and reported later in the day with a copy of resolutions, which were submitted to the Exhibitors League. At a night meeting the league adopted them with a few minor changes which were agreeable to all concerned. The constitution and by-laws that were adopted follow : Whereas, The enactment and enforcement of hostile, burdensome. un-American and intolerable censorship laws as relating to the exhibition of motion pictures in the state of Kansas has brought about a condition which threatens the stability and prosperity of the industry; and Whereas. In the administration of the laws the exhibitors have met with what seems to them an unreasonably strict, prejudicial interpretation there- of, now therefore Be it resolved. That the members of the Motion Picture Exhibitors League, Kansas Branch, in cou- vention assembled, on this eighteenth day of Octo- ber, 1915, at Pittsburg, Kansas, in recognition of the paramount importance of securing an abatement of these conditions, does hereby pledge its mem- bership to the support of an organization to be known as the Amusement Association of Kansas and to have for the purpose of its existence general pro- tection of tile amusement interests against any and all impositions of whatever nature, as well as the improvement and upbuilding thereof in all matters, and to bring into close bonds of fellowship all and sundry interests directly or indirectly concerned ; and Be it resolved, That the Motion Picture Exhib- itors League, Kansas Branch, through its executive committee and members, urgently admonish all to whom the privilege of membership has been ex- tended to avail themselves thereof, sincere in the belief and firm in the conviction that by this means may be met and mastered the intolerable conditions that now exist. Declaration of Principles First. — We favor in every branch and department of the business of public amusement a policy of clean, honorable, honest and ethical business prac- tice and in fair dealing in all relations with the public and with each other. Second. — We utterly condemn the exhibition at any place at any time of any lewd, indecent, sug- gestive or immoral play, act, performance or mo- tion picture film, and pledge this association and its membership to the active and energetic sup- pression of any such play, act, performance or mo- tion picture film. Third. — This association stands pledged and com- mitted to a constant effort to improve and upbuild the quality of the public exhibitions given by 'its membership and the places in which they are held or given. Fourth. — We favor protecting our membership against fraudulent action or practice, against im- postors and impositions of whatever nature. The Constitution The objects and purposes of this association shall be to bring together in close bonds of association all persons interested in the business of public amusement in the state of Kansas and to foster and develop social and commercial relations between them and to protect its membership against fraud or unfair practices of any nature, regardless of by whom or what interest attempted, and to develop and upbuild the business of public amusement in accordance with the declaration and principles which appear above and to which this association is committed. Its membership shall consist of owners, proprie- tors, stockholders, lessees, managers, partners, and employes in or of theatres of all classes, film ex- changes, film or vaudeville booking agencies, scenic studios, motion picture theatre supply concerns, theatrical seating concerns, baseball, summer park and airdome enterprises and kindred and allied concerns and others having a financial interest in the business of public amusement subject to the action of the membership committee. The convention was a huge success in every way. It was predicted by some be- fore the date set for the meeting that it would be next to impossible to get the ex- hibitors to attend. But they came from all parts of the state and were well repaid for attending. All were enthusiastic about the meeting and all were up in arms about the huge censorship tax that they are compelled to pay. The general concensus of opinion was not to try to have the law repealed in its en- tirety, but to have it amended in such a way that it would not work such a hardship upon the exhibitors and exchanges. Several of the prominent men in the convention were in favor of this, while some of the most rabid were in favor of an attempt to repeal the law in its entirety. The question of how to eliminate the obstruction will be worked out later. The second day of the convention the Rev. Festus Foster, one of the censors. turned up and came in and talked to tlie exchange men and exhibitors. He said that he himself was not in favor of the high tax that the moving picture exhibitors were compelled to pay for the censoring of their films, but that he was in favor of censorship. He is of the opinion that the law could be amended and that he thought the tax should be just enough to pay the cost of such cen- soring. Kansas President Speaks Another speaker prominent among the ex- hibitors was W. B. Moore, president of the Motion Picture Exhibitors League, Kansas Branch. He operates a picture show in the state, and his taxes amount to about forty per cent, on his investment. Practically everyone of the two hundred present had something to say about cen- sorship. E. C. Mills, who has fought censorship and Sunday closing in Oklahoma and Texas, attended the convention as a representative of the Mutual Film Corporation, and no amount of praise will repay him for his invaluable service. The officers of the new association elected to serve for the coming year are : Carl Mensing, of Leavenworth, president; W. H. Willey, of Mulberry, vice-president ; E. H. Meyn, of Kansas City, Kansas, treasurer; and J. E. Poland, of Motion Picture News, secretary. The executive committee is composed of E. R. Pearson, V-L-S-E manager in Kansas City, chairman ; Harry Rogers, of Marion, secretary; Stanley Chambers, of Hutchin- son ; Lee Gunnison, of Atchinson, and Chas. W. Harden, Fox Film Corporation's man- ager in Kansas City. Exchanges Represented The following are the exchanges and the representatives they had at the conevntion : V-L-S-E, E. R. Pearson, L. J. Scott and H. E. Stabler; Mutual Film Corporation, F. L. Kiltz, E. C. Mills, William Warner and L. B. Douglas ; Fox Film Corporation, Chas. W. Harden, E. H. Wachter, and W. B. Emrich ; Universal Film and Supply Company, R. C. Cropper and C. W. Potter ; World Film Corporation, T. Y. Henry; Picture Playhouse Film Company, Roy W. J. Bettis ; Metro Pictures Service, ^I. E.

Hodkinson, in Joining Hands with the Celebrated Theatrical Producing Firm, Extends His Service to Cities Not Yet Reached by Film Corporation THE Paramount Pictures Corporation has signed contracts with Klaw and Erlanger by the terms of which a new $2,000,000 corporation, to be known as the Paramount-Kiaw and Erlanger Company, has been formed. The executive board of the new corpora- tion will consist of W. W. Hodkinson, president of the Paramount Pictures Cor- ])oration ; Adolph Zukor, president of the Famous Players Film Company ; Samuel Goldfish, treasurer and general manager of the Jesse Lasky Feature Play Company; Marc Klaw, Abraham L. Erlanger and Ray- mond Pawley, treasurer of the Paramount Pictures Corporation. An associate board of directors will be announced later. The purpose of the new organization will be to extend Paramount service to cities which it has not yet reached, and to procure suitable theatres in these cities for the showing of Paramount pictures. At its formation as the first feature pro- gram company in the motion picture busi- ness, a year and a half ago, the Paramount Pictures Corporation instituted the con- tinuous service system of booking photo- plays, which has been used successfully in the legitimate theatre by Klaw and Er- langer, and it was therefore natural that these two interests should form an alli- ance. It was announced that it is not the in- tention of this new organization to fight anyone, or to usurp the place of anyone. It is merely to extend the service of a com- panj- which already exists, and to better generally the exhibition of motion pictures throughout the country; it will not inter- fere with the present interests of the Para- mount Pictures Corporation or its feature- producing companies, the Famous Players Film Company, Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, Oliver Morosco and Pallas Pic- tures, Inc., on the oile hand, or Klaw and Erlanger on the other — which means that the present relations of the theatres book- ing the service of either of these organiza- tions will not be disturbed. Launching the first feature program in the face of terrific odds, instituting policies which were unheard of in the motion pic- ture business, Paramount proved that its ideas were correct. Today, bigger and bet- ter theatres, such as the Strand in New York,'have sprung up throughout the coun- try, and in every instance the backbone of their program is Paramount pictures. Au- tomobiles are now seen at motion picture theatres, and people in evening dress at- tend. Longer runs and rebookings, with tiic added value of national advertising, have proved successful — ideas which had their conception in the mind of W. W. Hodkin- son, and their fulfillment in the operations of the Paramount Pictures Corporation. Thought was evinced in every dealing of the big company — everything was planned ahead. The largest advertising campaign ever launched in the motion picture busi- ness was not begun without nearly a year of investigation on the part of Howard E. Spauldinu. It was supplemented by publicity and ad- vertising helps to the exhibitor. Step by step Paramount has spread its gospel throughout the country— higher prices, better theatres, better patrons and better music. The alliance of two such companies was bound to come in the natural sequence of events. It marks, apparently, the signing of the peace pact between the silent and spoken drama. UNIVERSAL BEAUTIES IN PALACE THEATRE FASHION SHOW Five beauties from the Universal Film Manufacturing Company appeared in the Palace theatre's Fall Fashion show as a part of the $1,000,000 display of gems, gowns, furs, lingerie, hats, feathers, sport clothes and boots from the supreme cre- ative artists in style. The Universal beauties were Violet Mersereau, Rosemary Theby, Dorothy Phillips, Betty Gray and Edna Hunter. Their gowns were designed by Harry Col- lins, costumer of 29 West Thirty-eighth street.

ASSISTANT DIRECTORS Announcement of the most recently per- fected plan of changes in equipment and working arrangements comes from the Gaumont studio at Flushing, L. I. In or- der to handle its four Mutual brands — the tri-weekly Rialto Star Features, in which a well-known Broadway player has the leading role ; the weekly Casino Star Com- edy, split-reel scenic and animated comic; \"See America First\" and \"Keeping Up with the Joneses,\" and the \"Mutual News Week- ly,\" the Gaumont company will open up a winter studio in South Jacksonville, Fla. Details were given in last week's Motion Picture News. Thirty thousand dollars is being expend- ed by the Thanhouser company for a glass studio at Jacksonville, Fla., as also an- nounced in Motion Picture News last week, which will be ready for occupation on December 1. At that time some of the New Rochelle contingency will go South, where the beautiful scenery of Florida, the West Indies and the Bermudas will be used as the setting for one and multiple- reel drama and comedy for the Mutual. Simultaneously, two companies will go to the Hudson Bay country to produce dramas of life in the frozen North. Ac- tivities will by no means be slackened in New Rochelle. No changes will be made at present in the Thanhouser's output of Mutual pictures — the two Falstaff come- dies, one multiple reel and one part drama, of weekly release, a bi-weekly Than-o-play multiple reel production, and an occasional Masterpicture. While the American Film Corporation announces no important immediate changes in production or equipment, it is sending to the Mutual program of November 11. as a Masterpicture, \"The End of the Road,\" a picturization of that play by H. Grattan Donnelly, which first went to the public under the title of \"Carolina.\" May Allison and Harold Lockwood play in this Master- picture. The most recent addition to the David Horsley players, announcement has just come, is Irving Cummings, the leading man of the Mutual's serial, \"The Diamond from the Sky.\" Another Masterpicture which will be re- leased as a special in the Mutual program on November 7, is \"The Seventh Noon,\" in which Ernest Glendenning, the popular young actor, plays the leading role. \"The Seventh Noon\" was originally a book fmm the pen of Frederick Orin Bartlett. STEEN GETS FRANCHISE FOR ONE REEL COMEDY ON ASSOCIATED A. G. Steen, president of the Steen Film Producing Company, Philadelphia, has been in New York negotiating for a franchise with the Associated, and after a thorough investigation has finally closed a deal for a franchise of a one-reel comedy weekly. Mr. Steen originall)' started the Steen Feature Film Exchange in Baltimore, ten years ago, and afterwards purchased several theatres, which he operated successfully. He was the manager of the Universal Film Manufacturing Co. He has an interest in the Tri-State Feature Film Co. of Phila- delphia and Baltimore, and was one of tin. prime movers in the formation of the Kri- terion, and owner of the rights for that program for Eastern Pennsylvania.

MOTIONPICTURENEWS 45 Rothapfel Meets Capital City Film Men on His Tour Gathering Is Second in the Countrywide Trip of Master-Manager Under Auspices of the Mutual, and Is Presided Over by B. C. Cunningham, of the Company's Exchange in Washington, D. C. — Hotel Raleigh Is Scene of Meeting, Where in the Oak Room, the Guests Listen to Talk on Exhibitor Management special to Motion Picture News Washington, D. C, Oct. 26. THE meeting of S. L. Rothapfel with the exhibitors and exchangemen of the National Capital, marked a sig- nificant unity of the motion picture and the press, which promises not only to strengthen this co-operation in Washing- ton, but will be felt elsewhere. The gathering was the second of the series known as the Rothapfel-Mutual tour, given under the auspices of the local Mutual film exchange, of which B. C. Cunningham is manager. The oak parlor of the Raleigh hotel was thrown open to the film men, who gathered informally, smoked and were served a buffet repast. This was not merely for the devotees of the Mutual program or features, nor to exploit in any way the films of these man- ufactures, which was demonstrated by the presence of exchangemen and exhibitors showing films of all programs. There was a spirit of fellowship which possibly no other film man could have created except Mr. Rothapfel, who is known in every corner of the country for his success. The significance of the unity of the press and pictures was demonstrated at the off- set when the speaker of the evening was introduced, not by someone of the Mutual ofiice, nor yet by an exhibitor, but by the only motion picture editor of the city, Gardner Mack, of the Times. By curious coincidence Mr. Mack has had the oppor- tunity of watching the career of Mr. Rothapfel, from the small theatre to the New York Strand, and was therefore well fitted to present him to his exhibitor as- sociates. Theatres Should Be Distinctive \"Individuality,\" said Mr. Rothapfel, \"is the keynote of success. \"Make your the- atre and your pictures, and your music, dif- ferent from the other fellow. Don't enter the exhibitor's field with the idea of com- petition and beating the other fellow down the street out. Spend your time attending to your own affairs, and let the other fel- low attend to his. \"There are many things that make for the success of a picture or a theatre, and one of the chief things to accomplish is to have faith in yourself, and make your peo- ple have faith in you. The old theory of giving the public what it wants, and the Barnum adage of \"the public wants to be fooled,\" are out-of-date now. \"Put your show above the public,\" he accentuated. \"Make the public look up to you, and make the public want what you want to give them. That's the road to success. And the public is not going to be fooled, either. It is a wise public to- day ; not the public Barnum was dealing with, and you must be wiser than your public.\" Mr. Rothapfel touched upon the chief point in the presentation of the picture, of the lights, the music, the stage decorations and minor details. \"I believe in lights,\" he reminded his hearers, \"and I believe in music, and these can be combined to make wonderful effects upon your audiences. More than this, I believe in the psycholog- ical point, which can win against the great- est odds.\" The speaker gave some prophecies of the film industry which interested his hearers. He predicted the death of the so-called multi-reel features, and the return to three reels of good, meaty stories, and an in- creased favor of the educational picture if properly presented. He predicted the open market and declared himself ready to forward this spirit. Hope in Board of Trade He dwelt upon the significance of the Motion Picture National Board of Trade, and of the things it had accomplished in its short life. He touched upon censor- ship, which he denounced emphatically, and he urged the co-operation of exhib- itors and all interested in the industry and the local press in every city. Tom Moore, the pioneer exhibitor of Washington, was called upon to make a few remarks. He said that Mr. Rothapfel had started so many new ideas working as to what he could do in his several the- atres that he did not want to interrupt them. A. Brylawski, of the Brylawski chain of theatres, was also called upon to speak, as was H. C. Gove, of the Columbia Photograph Company. The meeting closed with individual discourses in a heart-to-heart fashion. Gardner Mack, of the Times, as chair- man was a moving spirit during the eve- Special to Motion Picture News. Philadelphia, Oct. 26. THE speech of S. L. Rothapfel at the banquet engineered by the manager of the Mutual Exchange in Philadelphia, C. G. Powell, was an inspiration to every exhibit- or. The short notice of the affair prevent- ed many from attending, but those who were present were amply repaid. Mr. Rothapfel is no orator in the strict sense of the term, but he has the quality which made his heart to heart talk more interest- ing than the finest outburst of a trained speaker. As man to man he told of his own ex- perience and encouraged his audience to believe that each one of them could have, if not a Strand, at least a better and more profitable theatre than he is now running. Mr. Rothapfel prophesied a great change in the motion picture business in the next year or two. He foresees the return of shorter photo plays as good and better than the long fea- tures so eagerly sought after at present. An open market and fair competition was ning introducing speakers, suggesting topics of discussion, and creating an in- formality that resulted in many questions being asked and solved by this man of success. Among those present were : B. C. Cun- ningham, manager of the Mutual Film Exchange; T. C. Brainard, manager of the Herald and general manager of Harper Bros.; J. F. McDonald and H. G. Bier- man, of the Mutual ; Geo. M. Mann, of the Paramount Exchange; Gardner Mack, photoplay and dramatic editor of the Washington Times; Ralph Graves, dra- matic editor of the Washington Post; C. Plunkett, manager of the Plaza; J. Wrenn, manager of the Strand ; Arthur Robb, manager of the Garden; Tom Moore, pres- ident of Moore's Enterprises ; Catherine Lay Howe ; J. A.

Freuler, the Mutual's president, who conceived this tour, Mr. Rothapfel made it clear that his primary object in undertaking the trip was to help the exhibitor. Ed. J. O'Keefe, of the City Square the- atre, Atlantic City, acted as toastmaster. After Mr. Rothapfel had finished his talk, which brought out as his salient points the advice to the exhibitors to use their brains and to be individual, there was an informal discussion, several exhibitors being called upon for short talks. Jay Emanuel, of the Ridge; M. A. Benn, of the A. B. C; J. Jeffries, of the Rox- borough ; H. Stamper, of the Tioga, were the speakers and voiced the problems that confront the exhibitor away from the cen- tre of the big city. Mr. Rothapfel threshed out each problem as well as the very late hour permitted, and made a definite promise that as soon as this tour was over, he would come back to Philadelphia on \"his own hook\" and personally visit these theatres in order to study local conditions and show Rothapfel, at Banquet in Philadelphia, Predicts Return to Shorter Plays in Next Year or Two Table of contents will hereafter be found every week opposite inside back cover. 46 MOTION PICTURE NEWS Vol. 12.

L-KO APPOINTS KINGSBURY AS SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE Henry \"Pathe\" Lehrman, managing di- rector of the L-Ko Motion Picture Com- pany, of Hollywood, Cal., who has been paying New York City an extensive visit m the interests of his Billie Ritchie L-Ko comedies, secured while here the services of Stanley C. Kingsbury to act as his special representative. Mr. Kingsbury has been identified with the film industry for some years past, first entering the business as a showman, having owned and oper- ated one of the first picture houses in Syra- cuse. Later he became associated with the Warner's Features, being connected with the Buffalo ofiice, from where he was pro- moted to the managership of their interests in the Dominion of Canada with offices at Toronto. After serving for some time in that ca- pacity he associated himself with the Fa- mous Players Film Service, Ltd., with whom he became widely known in film cir- cles. Upon his return to the States Mr. Kings- bury again became connected with the Warner's interests which later became the United Film Company. When Mr. Lehrman came to New Y'ork and desired the services of a man of wide experience and extensive acquaintance in the motion picture business, he sought Mr. Kingsbury and after drawing up an agree- ment satisfactory to both parties, appointed him special representative of the L-Ko Mo- tion Picture Company. L Cameraman Thompson Off to War for Paramount Expert Photographer, Within Boundaries of All Countries at War at Various Times and Under Fire at Retreat from Mons, Leaves New York for .Athens FAYING the port of New York on the Since exclusive rights to the films he takes have been secured by the Paramount Pictures Corporation, Mr. Thompson will be one of the many camera-correspondents who will contribute their quota to the Para- mount Newspictures. In this connection he said : \"Knowing the standard of Paramount Pictures and having been taken into the confidence of W. W. Hodkinson as to what his celluloid magazine woijld contain, I did not further consider other offers that I had, but im- mediately closed with Walter E. Greene and the Paramount Corporation.\" In answer to a question as to minute de- tails of the Newspicture plan, Mr. Greene said, when seen : \"Paramount's policy has always been to do things first and talk about them afterwards— if at all. Suffice it to say that the engagement of Mr. Thompson as one of the war-correspondents — and we will have others — is only indicative of our de- termination to make these films worthy to be classed with other productions of the Paramount Program.\" liner St. Paul, with the statement that by the time he reaches Athens, Greece will be in the war, Donald C. Thompson, expert photographer and globe trotter, has set out for the Balkans in the interest of two or- ganizations of utmost importance in their particular fields, the Paramount Pictures Corporation and the Leslie-Judge Company. Since the advent of the motion picture, the \"camera-reporter\" has become more and more significant among the world's news gatherers. This 26-year-old Kansan was one of the first to realize the possibili- ties of the new branch of the industry. At the Baltimore Democratic Convention three >ears ago he took his first flier into the films. The result was such that he added a mo- tion picture camera to his photographic ,^tock and freelanced to such good purpose that he became a charter member in the Unusual Angle Club and distinctly welcome ni the offices of the editors. .'\\ confirmed wanderer, he was in Canada at the outbreak of the war and, securing a permit from General Hughes, was able to obtain exclusive photographs of the Cana- dian contingent. Later he went to France on a freight ship, narrowly escaping de- struction when a careless German bomb just m's^ed the tramp steamer on which he did odd jobs for his passage, since mere money meant nothing when it came to get- ting inside the lines. While with the English on the continent, Mr. Thompson took some of the most re- markable pictures of the entire war. For seven days and nights he was under steady fire at the retreat from Mons. W^hen asked whether or not filming the battle was as dangerous as fighting he shrugged his shoulders, and said : \"Yes, I suppose it is. but if you're going to be killed you will be. so why worry?\" At London he acted as correspondent for the New York World, and later joined the Belgian army. He has been at one time or nnother with the ^English, French. Belgians, Germans, Turks. Russians, Serbians and Bulgarians. Thus he has had a unique oppor- tunity to study the methods of the nations engaged in the war. MAKING PICTURES TO MUSIC NEW ESSANAY PLAN Music with pictures is the innovation in- troduced by George K. Spoor for the Es- sanay Company. Mr. Spoor conceived the idea of making pictures to music when Poe's \"The Raven\" was being produced re- cently. \"The Raven\" is an emotional photoplay so full of big moments that the actors had no time to recover from one before they were in the midst of another. It was for this lack of interlude that music was in- troduced to keep them up to the pitch. .\\n orchestra will be used at the studio from now on as a result of the success of \"The Raven.\" NICKOLAUS GOES TO COAST IN EXECUTIVE CAPACITY John Nickolaus. former head of the Uni- versal West Coast laboratory, who has been in the East for the past year, has been again sent to the West Coast, where he will hold an executive position in the pho- tographic department.

And another thing : The Selig sheet can be clipped. A good deal of publicity sent out by various manufacturers cannot be, be- cause when the editor is cutting a story out of one page he is cutting up a story on the reverse page. This fault the Selig publication avoids. It is of four pages. On two pages news items are run. On the back of each appears a \"house ad,\" which is to be read, but not clipped. Hence, the news pages stand by themselves. All of which shows that the Selig people have found out the secret of publicity de- signed for newspaper use: Give the news- paper what it wants, and in the shape the newspaper wants it. What the newspaper \\vants is facts ; facts served up in con- \\enient form. This formula is so simple that every picture manufacturer ought to have discovered it long ago. Only every picture manufacturer hasn't. The Selig Polyscope Company has. It has also been waging a campaign to get the exhibitor to advertise in the news- papers. The success of both these progressive ideas is witnessed in the following excerpts from a letter to Motion Picture News from H. C. Hoagland,- of the Selig pub- licity department: \"Along the lines which you are working we would submit a copy of the Philadel- phia Evening Ledger, of Saturday, Sep- tember 4, 1915, in which a very large dis- play ad on page 7 of that prominent news- paper appears. It read as follows : 'Exhib- itors of motion pictures should use printers' ink. Two out of three successful movie managers have cultivated increased busi- ness by the judicious use of newspaper and other space. Live exhibitors have taken over playhouses which seemed \"down and out.\" By using liberal advertising space and dependable picture-play service they have built up the \"down and out\" playhouses, until today they are on the broad highway to prosperity. We believe in newspaper space for the exhibitor. We believe when the exhibitor books unusual service he should so inform the public. — The Selig Polyscope Company ; reproduced from Paste-Pot and Shears. \"A few weeks ago we published a page announcement in our weekly, Paste-Pot and Shears, urging exhibitors to freely ad- vertise.

Each epi- sode is complete in two reels, and deals with the central character of Stingaree, a highwayman of the Australian bush, who TRUE BOARDMAN AS \"STINGAREE' has foresworn civilization and determines to prey on society. \"An Enemy of Mankind\" is in the na- ture of a prologue, and while dealing with Mr. Hornung's famous character was not written by the English author.

The progress of the adaptation of this dramatic and literary success was cut short by the disastrous fire which destroyed the Twenty-sixth street stuido of the concern on September 11. It was not until this week that the work could be again taken in hand as both direc- tors were engrossed in the replacing of some of the lost scenes in \"The White Pearl,\" which they had completed, with Marie Doro as the star, two weeks before the outbreak of the fire.

Because of his ex- pert horsemanship and crack rifle shooting he was peculiarly adapted to the part. With the release of the first episode ar- rangements have been made by the Kalem Company for the publication of the story in several hundred newspapers in all sec- tions of the United States and Canada, the fiction rights having been secured from Charles Scribner's Sons. Stingaree is first met as an English gen- tleman of leisure. Through a rapidly mov- ing combination of circumstances he be- comes an object of hatred to his young brother. Time after time he attempts to save the youth from himself but is finally made to bear the brunt of a scandal involv- ing the name of a married woman. -Accidentally Stingaree., who is then known as Irving Randolph, his right name, shoots the husband during target practice and to save the family name as well as to avoid arrest on a charge of murder he flees to Australia.

MOTION PICTURE NEWS 49 Judges Condemn Censorship at Ohio Convention Manuel Levine, of Common Pleas, in Suppression in Same Class with Samuel Kramer special to Motion' Picture Xews Cleveland, Oct. 25. DECIDED action was taken on the question of censorship at the annual meeting of the Ohio Motion Picture Exhibitors' League, which was just closed at the Hollenden. Public officials and jur- ists condemned censorship in no uncertain language. The resolution adopted on the censorship question was as follows : \"Resolved, that we are unalterably op- posed to motion picture censorship in all and any of its varied forms, knowing from actual experience that the judgment of our patrons, supported by the existing penal laws of Ohio, is all sufficient to meet the so-called evils complained of by the advo- cates of censorship.\" Common Pleas Judge Manuel Levine talked on \"The Freedom of the Photo- play\" at the banquet that closed the meet- ing. Judge Levine said that he was op- posed to censorship, due to the belief that the law should punish individual offenders and not place guardians over the law-abid- ing motion picture exhibitors. \"There is no more reason for censoring motion pic- tures than there is for censoring the press or curbing free speech,\" declared Judge Levine. This was regarded by the exhibitors as a slap at the censors who are trying to stifle free speech, as flashed on the screen. The case of Samuel Bullock, Cleveland motion picture exhibitor, arrested at the request of the state censors for showing the extract from the Herrington address at the West End Business Men's picnic at Puritan Springs the past summer, was talked over freely and unofficially by the delegates. The outcome of this case is be- ing watched with great interest all over the state, as it will set a precedent on a much-discussed question. Judge Samuel Kramer declared that, in his opinion, a court decision will be neces- sary to settle the censorship question, as there are many angles to the case that need elucidation. Censorship Un-American, Says Benesch Director of Public Safety A. A. Benesch condemned censorship, saying that it was un-American. He believes that local au- thorities, not those of the state located at Columbus who are unfamiliar with local conditions and wants of picture theatre patrons, should settle questions that arise regarding pictures. Other speakers were C. E. Baxter, of the city building depart- ment; John J. Sullivan, former United States district attorney; Police Prosecutor Silbert, Fred J. Herrington, president of the Motion Picture Exhibitors' League of America, Pittsburgh, and M. A. Miller, of New York, who said that censors were needed to censor the censors. Geveland delegates, keeping their prom- ise that they would not try to dominate the new organization, which voted unani- monslv to affiliate with the Motion Picture Talk on \"Freedom of the Photoplay\" at Cleveland Meeting Regards Picture Attempts to Stifle the Press and Curb Free Speech, While His Colleague Looks to Court Decision for Solution of Censor Question occasions that the motion picture theatres are responsible for sleepy children who come to school dull-eyed and listless after a long sojourn at the shows. The motion picture managers have tried on various occasions to devise some system, but no concerted action was taken until the ques- tion was presented at the convention. Another resolution adopted was one fa- voring the formation of an auxiliary or- .ganization to embrace representatives of all industries allied with the motion pic- ture business. It was recognized that all have interests in common and that all should be affiliated for their common good. State Headquarters in Cleveland Headquarters of the state organization will be established in Cleveland, as the delegates regard Cleveland as the main- spring of the motion picture industry in Ohio. This city also will be the center of the fight on the censorship question. Chairman Williams, of the state board, is aware of this fact, for he has been spend- ing considerable time in Cleveland of late. A merry fight was staged for the next convention, with about half a dozen cities in the race. When the smoke of the battle cleared, it was found that Canton had won the coveted honor. An elaborate entertainment program was provided for the delegates, who were taken on auto rides about the city, visiting the National Carbon Company's works, litho- graph plants, film exchanges and \"taking in\" new photoplays.

The curfew will not be the usual bell-ringing stunt, but this announce- ment will be put on the screen each night at 8:45: \"It is time that all good children were off home and to bed.\" At 9 o'clock the attendants will see to it that all ju- veniles unaccompanied by parents are out of the theatre. No tickets will be sold to children after 7 :30 p. m. This plan re- ceived the indorsement of Juvenile Judge Addams, who has been striving to end complaints about children being around the theatres at all hours. It is expected that it will also meet with the approval of teachers in the public schools who have charged on numerous Nance O'Neil Signs with Lubin for Feature Series Scenario Staff Will Submit for Consideration of Star Original Five-Reel Scripts and a Special Company Will Be Selected for Her Support Canyon of Arizona to complete filming of THROUGH the earnest efforts of Messrs.
