However, the economic impact of screening and treatment for HCV in high prevalence countries has not been well studied. Thus, we examined the cost-effectiveness of screening and treatment for HCV infection for asymptomatic, average-risk adults using a Markov decision analytic model. In our model, we collected age-specific prevalence, disease progression rates for Egyptians, and local cost estimates in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence of HCV infection (~15%) in the world. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and conducted sensitivity analyses to determine how cost-effective HCV screening and treatment might be in other developing countries with high and intermediate prevalence. In Egypt, implementing a screening program using triple-therapy treatment (sofosbuvir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin) was dominant compared to no screening because it would have lower total costs and improve health outcomes. HCV screening and treatment would also be cost-effective in global settings with intermediate costs of drug treatment (~$8,000) and a higher sustained viral response rate (70â80%).

The population totaled 50.5 million in 1986 with an annual growth rate of 2.8%. The infant mortality rate is 102/1000 (1986), and life expectancy is 58.3 years. Located in the northeastern corner of Africa, Egypt has a land area of about 1 million square kilometers and is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea, Libya, Sudan, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba, and Israel. Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world. Egyptians are a fairly homogenous people of Hamitic origin. Mediterranean and Arab influences appear in the north, and there is some mixing in the south with the Nubians of northern Sudan. Egypt has been a unified state for over 5000 years, and archeological evidence indicates that a developed Egyptian society has existed for considerably longer. The constitution of Egypt provides for a strong executive with authority vested in an elected president who can appoint 1 or more vice presidents, a prime minister, and a cabinet. Egypt's legislative body has 458 members -- 448 popularly elected and 10 appointed by the president. Power is concentrated in the hands of the president and the National Democratic Party's majority in the People's Assembly, but opposition parties organize, publish their views, and represent their followers at various levels in the political system. The process of gradual political liberalization begun by Sadat has continued under Mubarak. In fiscal year 1987 the gross domestic product (GDP) reached about US$30 billion. Agriculture and services each contribute about 1/3 of GDP; the remainder comes from industry, petroleum, mining, electricity, and construction. At this time, the Egyptian economy faces several challenges. In 1986 the government of Egypt initiated a major review of economic policy and initiated an economic\n\nEgypt and Red Sea\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1982-01-01\n\nA panaramic view of eastern Egypt, The Red Sea and Saudi Arabia beyond (24.0N, 33.0E).

This study aims to detect the prevalence of primary headache disorders in both urban and rural sectors in Fayoum governorate, Egypt. A total of 2600 subjects were included using multi-stage stratified systematic random sampling, with respondent rate of 91.3Â %. A pre-designed Arabic version, interviewer-administered, pilot tested structured questionnaire was developed according to The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version), and this questionnaire was validated and the strength of agreement in headache diagnosis was good. The 1-year headache prevalence was 51.4Â %, which was more prevalent in urban dwellers. The most common primary headache type was episodic tension type headache (prevalence; 24.5Â %), followed by episodic migraine (prevalence; 17.3Â %), both types peaked in midlife. Headache disorders were more common in females with exception of cluster headache that showed the expected male dominance. The risk of chronic headache increased more than one fold and half when the participants were females, married, and in those with high education. More than 60Â % of our participants did not seek medical advice for their headaches problem; this percentage was higher in rural areas. Primary headache disorders are common in Egypt; prevalence rate was comparable with western countries with exception of episodic tension headache. Still headache is under-estimated and under-recognized in Egypt and this problem should be targeted by health care providers.\n\n[The wild boar of Egypt].\n\nPubMed\n\nManlius, N; Gautier, A\n\n1999-07-01\n\nThe wild boar, Sus scrofa, is not a typical member of the Egyptian wild fauna, although it appears to have lived in the Nile Delta and other suitable regions in the north of the country. However, historic populations were probably of mixed origin, including feral domestic pigs. It is incorrect, as is sometimes still done, to include the wild boar in the iconographic bestiary of Ancient Egypt and assume that the domestic pigs of Ancient Egypt derive from local wild boars.\n\nOverview on health research ethics in Egypt and North Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarzouk, Diaa; Abd El Aal, Wafaa; Saleh, Azza; Sleem, Hany; Khyatti, Meriem; Mazini, Loubna; Hemminki, Kari; Anwar, Wagida A\n\n2014-08-01\n\nDeveloping countries, including Egypt and North African countries, need to improve their quality of research by enhancing international cooperation and exchanges of scientific information, as well as competing for obtaining international funds to support research activities. Research must comply with laws and other requirements for research that involves human subjects. The purpose of this article is to overview the status of health research ethics in Egypt and North African countries, with reference to other Middle Eastern countries. The EU and North African Migrants: Health and Health Systems project (EUNAM) has supported the revision of the status of health research ethics in Egypt and North African countries, by holding meetings and discussions to collect information about research ethics committees in Egypt, and revising the structure and guidelines of the committees, as well as reviewing the literature concerning ethics activities in the concerned countries. This overview has revealed that noticeable efforts have been made to regulate research ethics in certain countries in the Middle East. This can be seen in the new regulations, which contain the majority of protections mentioned in the international guidelines related to research ethics. For most of the internationally registered research ethics committees in North African countries, the composition and functionality reflect the international guidelines. There is growing awareness of research ethics in these countries, which extends to teaching efforts to undergraduate and postgraduate medical students. Â© The Author 2014.

There is almost no data regarding methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevalence in both countries. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus and MRSA nasal carriage among outpatients attending primary health care centers in two big cities in both countries. A total of 206 nasal swabs were obtained, 103 swabs from each country. S. aureus isolates were characterized by antibiotic susceptibility, presence of mecA and PVL genes, SCCmec-typing and spa typing, the corresponding Multi locus sequence typing clonal complex was assigned for each spa type based on Ridom StaphType database. MRSA was detected in 32% of the Egyptian outpatients while it was found in 25% of the Saudi Arabian outpatients. All MRSA isolates belonged to SCCmec type V and IVa, where some isolates in Saudi Arabia remained nontypeable. Surprisingly PVL(+) isolates were low in frequency: 15% of MRSA Egyptian isolates and 12% of MRSA isolates in Saudi Arabia. Two novel spa types were detected t11839 in Egypt, and t11841 in Saudi Arabia. We found 8 spa types among 20 isolates from Egypt, and 12 spa types out of 15 isolates from Saudi Arabia. Only two spa types t008 and t223 coexisted in both countries. Four clonal complexes (CC5, CC8, CC22, and CC80) were identified in both Egypt and Saudi Arabia. However, the data collected lacked a representation of isolates from different parts of each country as only one health center from each country was included, it still partially illustrates the CA-MRSA situation in both countries. In conclusion a set of control measures is required to prevent further increase in MRSA prevalence. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Editora Ltda.

Such problems are usually associated with limited managerial, technical and financial capabilities of municipal authorities. Municipal authorities in Egypt that are responsible for SWM services have always been accused of providing a less than satisfactory service, leading to huge quantities of solid waste being uncollected. This study assesses the potential for the provision of an effective and sustainable service, by estimating willingness of the residents to pay for such a service and the cost involved in its provision. The study covered the Rosetta urban centre and its adjacent areas, which are located in the northwestern part of the Nile Delta. It was found that, from an economic perspective, a viable SWM service could be provided in the study area using local funds. In order to increase the likelihood of success of such a service, it may be provided by a local firm or a cooperative to be established for that purpose.\n\nAn ancient scourge: the end of dracunculiasis in Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatts, S\n\n1998-04-01\n\nThis paper addresses the question of when guinea worm disease was last found in Egypt, and how written sources from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which mention the disease should be evaluated. This enquiry is relevant to the global eradication campaign now in progress, and the need for countries in which dracunculiasis was once present to prepare a certification of eradication. Sudan, the country which has the largest number of cases today, is Egypt's southern neighbour. Because of the nature of the disease (in endemic areas it is most common among poor, rural people), it may not have come to the attention of urban-based health personnel. In the period before the details of the transmission cycle were known, the attitudes and mindsets of physicians and travellers also have to be taken into account in interpreting written reports of the disease. An examination of documentary sources from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in European languages does not show any clear evidence for dracunculiasis transmission in Egypt during that period. Cases noted in Egypt, especially by the much quoted Dr Clot Bey in the 1820s, most likely originated beyond the borders of the country, in Sudan and, to a lesser extent, from endemic areas in the Middle East. However, many later commentators merely repeated what Clot Bey had written. A further difficulty is that some published reports which apparently concern dracunculiasis in Egypt, actually refer to cases in animals rather than humans.\n\nClinical characteristics of patients with multiple sclerosis enrolled in a new registry in Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nZakaria, Magd; Zamzam, Dina A; Abdel Hafeez, Mohamed A; Swelam, Mahmoud S; Khater, Shaimaa S; Fahmy, Mai F; Abdel Hady, Ayman; Fouad, Mohamed M; Abdel Nasser, Azza; Aref, Hany; Gadallah, Mohsen\n\n2016-11-01\n\nEpidemiological studies of multiple sclerosis (MS) are lacking in Egypt. To study the characteristics of Egyptian patients with multiple sclerosis in a new registry in a major tertiary referral centre in Cairo, Egypt. Patients were from the project MS database of the Multiple Sclerosis Unit at Ain Shams University Hospitals (N=950). We conducted a detailed medical history and examination including the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Females represented 72% of subjects (female: male ratio 2.57:1). The mean age of disease onset was 26.1Â±7.6 years. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) was the most common presentation (74.6%). Visual or sensory symptoms were the most common at presentation with RRMS, while motor symptoms were the most common presentation in other types of MS. Time to diagnosis was delayed up to 2 years in 27.8% of patients. The mean EDSS score was 3.6Â±2.1; 55% had EDSSâ¤3. About half (49%) received a disease-modifying drug. Progressive MS and motor presentation were associated with higher disability. This is the first documented MS registry from Egypt. The clinical characteristics of MS in Egypt was similar to other Arab countries and western countries. MS is more common among females in Egypt, with RRMS being the most common presentation. Visual symptoms and motor symptoms were the most common presentations in RRMS and progressive MS, respectively. Our findings also highlight the value of establishing registries in Egypt in order to be able to study, prospectively, the clinical course of the disease, the response to various DMD's and the epidemiology of MS in Egypt.

In this working paper the researchers study two levels of educational samples, the first one is of young geo-scientists and the other one is of young people of different disciplines to make over view survey (monitoring the base level) about knowing geoethics and another survey after applying some lectures and workshops to the same samples to monitor the second level. The aim of the research is to find out how people will accept this term and its application and how we can spread it through community with different effective ways. In Egypt there are some kind of culture problems could affect on spreading of any new concept, these problems could be overcome by some scientific, social and culture recommendations, these recommendations could be applied in both Arab countries and African Countries with few modifications.\n\nA systematic review of hepatitis C virus epidemiology in Asia, Australia and Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nSievert, William; Altraif, Ibrahim; Razavi, Homie A; Abdo, Ayman; Ahmed, Ezzat Ali; Alomair, Ahmed; Amarapurkar, Deepak; Chen, Chien-Hung; Dou, Xiaoguang; El Khayat, Hisham; Elshazly, Mohamed; Esmat, Gamal; Guan, Richard; Han, Kwang-Hyub; Koike, Kazuhiko; Largen, Angela; McCaughan, Geoff; Mogawer, Sherif; Monis, Ali; Nawaz, Arif; Piratvisuth, Teerha; Sanai, Faisal M; Sharara, Ala I; Sibbel, Scott; Sood, Ajit; Suh, Dong Jin; Wallace, Carolyn; Young, Kendra; Negro, Francesco\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe hepatitis C pandemic has been systematically studied and characterized in North America and Europe, but this important public health problem has not received equivalent attention in other regions. The objective of this systematic review was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology in selected countries of Asia, Australia and Egypt, i.e. in a geographical area inhabited by over 40% of the global population. Data references were identified through indexed journals and non-indexed sources. In this work, 7770 articles were reviewed and 690 were selected based on their relevance. We estimated that 49.3-64.0 million adults in Asia, Australia and Egypt are anti-HCV positive. China alone has more HCV infections than all of Europe or the Americas. While most countries had prevalence rates from 1 to 2% we documented several with relatively high prevalence rates, including Egypt (15%), Pakistan (4.7%) and Taiwan (4.4%). Nosocomial infection, blood transfusion (before screening) and injection drug use were identified as common risk factors in the region. Genotype 1 was common in Australia, China, Taiwan and other countries in North Asia, while genotype 6 was found in Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries. In India and Pakistan genotype 3 was predominant, while genotype 4 was found in Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria. We recommend implementation of surveillance systems to guide effective public health policy that may lead to the eventual curtailment of the spread of this pandemic infection.

Technical report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLieberson, J.; Stallard, J.\n\n1994-03-01\n\nThis report assesses the US Agency for International Development`s (A.I.D.`s) capital assistance program in Egypt in terms of both its commercial benefits for the United States and its developmental benefits for Egypt. In regard to the first aspect, the study found that few A.I.D.-funded projects or studies generated either participation by other donors or follow-on sales for U.S. companies. The report places much of the blame for this on U.S. firms` failure to take advantage of a clear opportunity to develop the Egyptian commercial market. Findings regarding the developmental benefits of the projects are mixed. (1) The projects helped supportmoreÂ Â» strong private sector growth in Egypt through the 1980`s. Nonetheless, their economic and financial rates of return were generally disappointing. (2) The projects were built to a high technical standard, but their sustainability is in doubt. (3) The pursuit of commercial advantage for U.S. firms did not distort the developmental goals of the projects. Overall, the report attributes the disappointing economic results of A.I.D.`s capital assistance program to a poor policy environment, which the reforms pursued in connection with the program did little to change.Â«Â less\n\nPostpartum Family Planning During Sociopolitical Transition: Findings from an Integrated Community-Based Program in Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nCooper, Chelsea M; Charurat, Elaine; El-Adawi, Issam; Kim, Young-Mi; Emerson, Mark R; Zaki, Wael; Schuster, Anne\n\n2016-06-01\n\nLimited information exists on postpartum family planning and implementation of integrated reproductive and maternal and child health programs in countries experiencing sociopolitical transition. A quasi-experimental evaluation of an integrated reproductive and maternal and child health program implemented in selected sites in Upper and Lower Egypt was conducted between 2012 and 2014. Preintervention and postintervention household surveys were conducted among 12,454 women in intervention sites and nonintervention comparison sites who at survey had a child younger than 24 months. Bivariate and multivariate analyses estimated the intervention's effects on postpartum family planning-related outcomes, including contraceptive use, knowledge of optimal birthspacing, reproductive intentions and decision making about contraceptive use. In Upper Egypt, modern contraceptive use decreased over the study period in both intervention and comparison sites (by six and 15 percentage points, respectively), and in Lower Egypt, contraceptive use remained unchanged in intervention sites and decreased slightly (by three points) in comparison sites; in both regions, the intervention was positively associated with the difference in differences between groups (odds ratios, 1.5 for Upper Egypt and 1.3 for Lower Egypt). The intervention appears to have had a positive effect on knowledge of optimal birthspacing in Upper Egypt, on wanting to delay the next pregnancy in Lower Egypt, and on pregnancy risk and joint decision making in both regions. Study findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrated reproductive and maternal and child health program implemented in a changing sociopolitical context. Revitalized efforts to bolster family planning within the country are needed to avert further losses and spark a return to positive trends.\n\nMarshak Lectureship Talk: Women in Physics in Egypt and the Arab World\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEl Sayed, Karimat\n\n2009-03-01\n\nUntil the end of the 19th Century Science was not classified into different disciplines. The first woman named in the history of science was Merit Ptah (2700 BC) in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. In the new Egypt the first girl's school started in Cairo in 1873 and the first University in 1908. Only a few girls attended the University at that time, mainly studying the humanities. The first Egyptian woman physicist graduated in 1940 and received her PhD in nuclear physics in the USA. Nowadays the number of women in physics is increasing in all branches of physics, some of them are senior managers and others have been decorated with various prizes. In this talk some statistics will be given to show the percentage of women in physics in relation to other fields of science in Egypt. In Saudi Arabia the first girls' school started in 1964 and the first college for women, which was a section of King Abdul-Aziz University (where education is not mixed), started in 1975. I was the founder of the Physics Department of this women's section. Egyptians have played significant roles in teaching schoolchildren and university students of both sexes in all the Arab countries: Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Kuwait, Yemen, the Gulf States, Libya, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. But with respect to Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, our role was limited, since classes are taught in French. Arab women living in the countries located east of Egypt still have many difficulties facing them, needing to overcome many technical, academic, and social problems, while women in the countries located west of Egypt have fewer problems. There were many problems in the early days of education in Egypt but the women of Egypt worked hard to gain the same rights as men and were able to pave the way for all Arab women. I myself met many difficulties in my early days. This talk will also describe the impact of the regional conference on Women in Physics in Africa and Middle East, which was held in Cairo in 2007.\n\nAid for family planning in Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\n1974-02-01\n\nA $5 million credit has been approved by the International Development Association, an affilate of the World Bank, to help finance a population project in Egypt. The project provides for the construction, equipping and furnishing of 22 general health centers, 12 polyclinics, 3 centers for training nursing teachers and 3 centers for in service training. 100 and 50 multipurpose vehicles will be provided to improve mobility of family planning services. Also included are a study on the maintenance of health facilities, 3 evaluation studies of family planning acceptors, an experimental home visiting program to inform and motivate people on family planning, and assistance in the production of health education material useful for family planning information and motivation. Simple demographic facts illustrate the seriousness of the population problem in Egypt. The current population of 35 million will be double by the year 2000 if the present 2.5% annual increase continues. This will put strains on a country whose population density quadrupled during the last century, and which stands to day at 950 persons per square kilometer of habitable land, a density rivalled by only 2 or 3 other countries in the world. The IDA credit will cover about 1/2 of the project's expense. The Egyptian government will finance the local costs. full text\n\nLessons learned from the disruption of dental training of Malaysian students studying in Egypt during the Arab spring.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimon, Sibu Sajjan; Ramachandra, Srinivas Sulugodu; Abdullah, Datuk Dr Fawzia; Islam, Md Nurul; Kalyan, C G\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPolitical crisis and worsening security situation in Egypt in late 2013 resulted in Malaysian students who were pursuing their dental education in Egypt being recalled home to Malaysia. The Ministry of Higher Education in Malaysia took steps to integrate these students into public and private universities in Malaysia. We used a questionnaire and informal interviews to learn from students returning from Egypt about their experiences transitioning from dental schools in Egypt to Malaysia. We discuss the challenges students faced with regards to credit transfer, pastoral care, the differences in the curriculum between the dental faculties of the two nations, and the financial implications of this disruption of their training. We live in a fragile world where similar political situations will surely arise again. The approaches used by the Malaysian government and the lessons learned from these students may help others. The perspectives of these students may help educators reintegrate expatriate students who are displaced by political instability back into the education system of their own countries.\n\nNational water, food, and trade modeling framework: The case of Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdelkader, A; Elshorbagy, A; Tuninetti, M; Laio, F; Ridolfi, L; Fahmy, H; Hoekstra, A Y\n\n2018-10-15\n\nThis paper introduces a modeling framework for the analysis of real and virtual water flows at national scale. The framework has two components: (1) a national water model that simulates agricultural, industrial and municipal water uses, and available water and land resources; and (2) an international virtual water trade model that captures national virtual water exports and imports related to trade in crops and animal products. This National Water, Food & Trade (NWFT) modeling framework is applied to Egypt, a water-poor country and the world's largest importer of wheat. Egypt's food and water gaps and the country's food (virtual water) imports are estimated over a baseline period (1986-2013) and projected up to 2050 based on four scenarios. Egypt's food and water gaps are growing rapidly as a result of steep population growth and limited water resources. The NWFT modeling framework shows the nexus of the population dynamics, water uses for different sectors, and their compounding effects on Egypt's food gap and water self-sufficiency. The sensitivity analysis reveals that for solving Egypt's water and food problem non-water-based solutions like educational, health, and awareness programs aimed at lowering population growth will be an essential addition to the traditional water resources development solution. Both the national and the global models project similar trends of Egypt's food gap. The NWFT modeling framework can be easily adapted to other nations and regions. Copyright Â© 2018.

However, approximately 27% of children under the age of 5 in these countries are still malnourished. This work focuses on the childhood malnutrition in one of the biggest developing countries, Egypt. This study examined the association between bio-demographic and socioeconomic determinants and the malnutrition problem in children less than 5 years of age using the 2003 Demographic and Health survey data for Egypt. In the first step, we use separate geoadditive Gaussian models with the continuous response variables stunting (height-for-age), underweight (weight-for-age), and wasting (weight-for-height) as indicators of nutritional status in our case study. In a second step, based on the results of the first step, we apply the geoadditive Gaussian latent variable model for continuous indicators in which the 3 measurements of the malnutrition status of children are assumed as indicators for the latent variable \"nutritional status\".\n\nAfrican refugees in Egypt: trauma, loss, and cultural adjustment.\n\nPubMed\n\nHenry, Hani M\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThis study examined the influence of pre-immigration trauma on the acculturation process of refugees, as reflected in the manifestations of their continuing bonds with native cultures. Six African refugees who sought refuge in Egypt because of wars and political persecution were interviewed about the circumstances of their departure from their home countries, as well as their life experiences in Egypt. All participants kept continuing bonds with their native cultures, but these bonds manifested differently depending on their ability to assimilate pre-immigration trauma and cultural losses. Participants who successfully assimilated both pre-immigration trauma and cultural losses developed continuing bonds with their native cultures that helped them (a) integrate the Egyptian culture into their life experiences and (b) tolerate difficult political conditions in Egypt. Participants who could not assimilate their pre-immigration trauma and cultural losses also developed continuing bonds with their native culture, but these bonds only provided them with solace.\n\nElectricity end use demand study for Egypt\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTuriel, I.; Lebot, B.; Nadel, S.\n\n1990-12-01\n\nThis report describes the results of a study undertaken by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) to develop an approach for reducing electricity demand in the residential sector in Egypt. A team with expertise in appliance energy usage, appliance manufacturing, appliance testing, and energy analysis was assembled to work on this project.

The present paper valuates the impact of temperature increase in the residential building sector of Egypt that is the most integrated example of the 7 out of the 20 MENA countries that have started their green efforts upon building environment. Furthermore, as it is based on a literature research upon socio-economic characteristics, existing building stock, existing legal and institutional framework, it elaborates a quantitative evaluation of Egypt's energy-saving potential, outlining basic constraints upon energy conservation, in order for Egypt to be able to handle the high energy needs due to its warm climate. Last but not least, the paper proposes a policy pathway for the implementation of green building codes and concludes with the best available technologies to promote EE in the Egyptian building sector.\n\nMulti scenario seismic hazard assessment for Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMostafa, Shaimaa Ismail; Abd el-aal, Abd el-aziz Khairy; El-Eraki, Mohamed Ahmed\n\n2018-01-01\n\nEgypt is located in the northeastern corner of Africa within a sensitive seismotectonic location. Earthquakes are concentrated along the active tectonic boundaries of African, Eurasian, and Arabian plates. The study area is characterized by northward increasing sediment thickness leading to more damage to structures in the north due to multiple reflections of seismic waves. Unfortunately, man-made constructions in Egypt were not designed to resist earthquake ground motions. So, it is important to evaluate the seismic hazard to reduce social and economic losses and preserve lives. The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment is used to evaluate the hazard using alternative seismotectonic models within a logic tree framework. Alternate seismotectonic models, magnitude-frequency relations, and various indigenous attenuation relationships were amended within a logic tree formulation to compute and develop the regional exposure on a set of hazard maps. Hazard contour maps are constructed for peak ground acceleration as well as 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.5-, 1-, and 2-s spectral periods for 100 and 475 years return periods for ground motion on rock. The results illustrate that Egypt is characterized by very low to high seismic activity grading from the west to the eastern part of the country. The uniform hazard spectra are estimated at some important cities distributed allover Egypt. The deaggregation of seismic hazard is estimated at some cities to identify the scenario events that contribute to a selected seismic hazard level. The results of this study can be used in seismic microzonation, risk mitigation, and earthquake engineering purposes.\n\nMulti scenario seismic hazard assessment for Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMostafa, Shaimaa Ismail; Abd el-aal, Abd el-aziz Khairy; El-Eraki, Mohamed Ahmed\n\n2018-05-01\n\nEgypt is located in the northeastern corner of Africa within a sensitive seismotectonic location.

Moreover, our calculations on the amount of the embodied water traded between Egypt and each of its partners take place according to a combination of available data on the blue, green and grey water footprints as well as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) database of traded amounts per crop type. A study on the virtual water trade gravity, enables us to enrich former related studies (Fracasso 2014; Fracasso, Sartori and Schiavo 2014) via examining Egypt's water supply dependence on the Nile River and if comparative advantages -purely from the side of water quantities- can be identified via recognizing which water footprint categories are particularly high. Additionally, this methodology can comprise -from a fundamental level- a guide for revealing the importance of water footprint types for Egypt's agricultural sector; hence, Egypt's potential comparative advantages, as far as quantitative water endowments are exclusively concerned (without consideration of water or crop prices). Although it is pointed out very correctly by various authors (Antonelli and Sartori 2014) that the virtual water trade concept does not incorporate many important aspects of water supply -such as heavy water price subsidizing- to be used accurately for the identification of comparative advantages, we consider that the purely quantitative examination can provide strong fundamental indications -especially for green and grey water footprints, which are hypothesized to be less sensitive to subsidizing. In overall, this effect can very well provide a primary indication on the organization of the global alimentation trade network (Yang et al. 2006). The gravity equation used contains water footprint data for the 15 top traded crops and the distances for Egypt\n\nReading Reform in Egypt: Do the Second-Grade Textbooks Reflect the New Direction?\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBoyle, Helen N.; Salah, Wail\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn light of disappointing scores on the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), Arabic-speaking countries have begun to reexamine, and in some case reform, how they teach reading in the early grades.

The significance of this public health threat is most pronounced in low- and middle-income countries where 90 percent of the world's road traffic-related fatalities take place. Current estimates for Egypt show a road traffic fatality rate of 42 deaths per 100,000 population-one of the highest in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. RTIs are also responsible for 1.8 percent of all deaths and 2.4 percent of all disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost in the country. Despite this, studies surrounding this topic are scarce, and reliable data are limited. The overall goal of this article is to define the health impact of RTIs in Egypt and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each data source for the purpose of improving the current RTI data systems. A 2-pronged approach was undertaken to assess the burden of RTIs in Egypt. First, a thorough literature review was performed using PubMed, Embase, ISIS Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases. Articles pertaining to Egypt and road traffic injuries were selected for screening. With assistance from Egyptian colleagues, a comprehensive exploration of data sources pertaining to RTIs in Egypt was undertaken and secondary data from these sources were procured for analysis. The literature review yielded a total of 20 studies, of which 6 were multi-country and 5 were hospital-based studies. None examined risk factors such as speeding, alcohol, or seat belt use. Secondary data sources were acquired from national hospital-based injury surveillance; a community-based health survey; pre-hospital injury surveillance; the Ministry of Transport; the General Authority for Roads, Bridges and Land Transport; death certificates; and the central agency for public motorization and statistics. Risk factor data are also limited from these sources.

In future reports, authors will be asked about the assessement of those invited women, and what were the results and outcome if referred women were found to have abnormalities in their breasts. In another study from Cairo, Egypt, women were taught how to examine themselves, and authors reported that many were found to have clinical breast cancers for which they were effectively downstaged, and therefore treated for cancers that would have otherwise presented later as more advanced cases [10]. This issue brings me back to re-emphasize the importance of awareness, teaching women self-breast exam, and clinical breast examination once-a-year by a physician, particularly in countries with limited resources. Breast cancer awareness campaigns emphasize the benefits of early detection by promoting breaking of taboos, and teaching scientific facts that early breast cancer can be cured, and that cure can be achieved without the need of mastectomy. Advanced breast cancer is devastating to women and to their husbands and children, and therefore campaigns should be directed towards women as well as husbands who should be asked to encourage their wives to enroll in screening campaigns. Campaigns have begun to reduce the effects of taboos and people started to talk more freely about cancer, in fact, we and many centers in Arab countries have started to see more cases of early breast cancer and even a significant number of cases with microcalcifications [4]. Breast cancer screening in countries with limited resources have been recently reviewed [11,12]. As for the management of abnormal findings, Dorria S. Salem et al. [1] report performing FNAB as first line management in suspicious cases and reserving core biopsies for inconclusive cases. I fully agree with the authors' efforts to ensure accurate diagnosis and the importance of having an experienced cytopathologist. However, FNA is useful and recommended when there is a palpable tumor or a highly suspicious tumor with\n\nEpidemiology, ecology and gene pool of influenza A virus in Egypt: will Egypt be the epicentre of the next influenza pandemic?\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdelwhab, E M; Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOutside Asia, Egypt is considered to be an influenza H5N1 epicentre and presents a far greater pandemic risk than other countries. The long-term endemicity of H5N1 and the recent emergence of H9N2 in poultry call attention to the need for unravelling the epidemiology, ecology and highly diverse gene pool of influenza A virus (IAV) in Egypt which is the aim of this review. Isolation of a considerable number of IAV subtypes from several avian and mammalian hosts was described. Co-infections of poultry with H5N1 and H9N2 and subclinical infections of pigs and humans with H1N1 and H5N1 may raise the potential for the reassortment of these viruses. Moreover, the adjustment of IAV genomes, particularly H5N1, to optimize their evolution toward efficient transmission in human is progressing in Egypt. Understanding the present situation of influenza viruses in Egypt will help in the control of the disease and can potentially prevent a possible pandemic.\n\nEpidemiology, ecology and gene pool of influenza A virus in Egypt: Will Egypt be the epicentre of the next influenza pandemic?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdelwhab, EM; Abdel-Moneim, Ahmed S\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOutside Asia, Egypt is considered to be an influenza H5N1 epicentre and presents a far greater pandemic risk than other countries.

Back to 1886 when the first oil discovery was achieved and since then exploration operations were carried out covering almost every prospective area in Egypt. The history of oil exploration in Egypt passed through six stages, each of which is characterized by its own activities and reflects the impact of certain developments not only in the applied exploration techniques, but also in the work style and prevailing exploration concepts, in addition to the development in the agreement terms. Six areas could add new oil and gas reservesmoreÂ Â» to Egypt, namely: N. Sinai (onshore and offshore); Nile Delta (onshore and offshore); Western Desert (onshore and offshore); Nile Valley; Red Sea; and the Gulf of Aqaba. Such areas have the prerequisites for commercial oil and/or gas accumulations including potential source rocks, good reservoirs and adequate traps in addition to effective seals. It is believed that the undiscovered oil and gas reserves of Egypt could be several times that which have been discovered so far.Â«Â less\n\nClinical Spectrum of Cerebral Palsy and Associated Disability in South Egypt: A Local Survey Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbas, Osama; Abdelaziem, Faten; Kilany, Ayman\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy is the most common cause of motor disability in children with a prevalence of 2-10/1,000 live births in the developing areas. AIM: The epidemiology, clinical picture, and associated comorbidities in CP have been extensively studied in high-resource countries, but in low-resource areas, including Africa, those studies are still lacking. METHODS: Cerebral palsy cases were prospectively recruited from every physiotherapy centre in Bani-Mazar city, Egypt, in a cross-sectional study from May 2015 to November 2015. RESULTS: Two hundred cases were enrolled with a prevalence of 1 per 1000 live births. Within the study population, 72.5% were the spastic type, 16% were dyskinetic, 7% were ataxic, and 4.5% were hypotonic. The most common comorbidities were cognitive impairment and epilepsy affecting 77% and 38%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cerebral palsy in developing countries has a higher prevalence and different clinical profile regarding severity and associated disability. The perinatal and high-quality neonatal care together with physical therapy and rehabilitation programs is still lacking in developing countries.

According to the World Health Organization, there was an estimated 358,000 maternal deaths globally in 2008. Developing countries accounted for 99% of these deaths of which three-fifths occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa. In primary health care (PHC), quality of antenatal care is fundamental and critically affects service continuity. Nevertheless, medical research ignores the issue and it is lacking scientific inquiry, particularly in Egypt. The aim of the following study is to assess the quality of antenatal care in urban Suez Governorate, Egypt. A cross-sectional primary health care center (PHCC) based study conducted at five PHCC in urban Suez, Egypt. The total sample size collected from clients, physicians and medical records. Parameters assessed auditing of medical records, assessing provider and pregnant women satisfaction. Nearly 97% of respondents were satisfied about the quality of antenatal care, while provider's satisfaction was 61% and for file, auditing was 76.5 Â± 5.6. The present study shows that client satisfaction, physicians' satisfaction and auditing of medical record represent an idea about opportunities for improvement.\n\nPublication trends in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology: focus on pharmacology in Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Mas, Mahmoud M; El-Gowelli, Hanan M; Michel, Martin C\n\n2013-11-01\n\nIn a previous analysis of the country of origin of papers published in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology, a major shift toward contributions from emerging market countries, was noticed in comparison of 2010 to 2001 publications. Repeating such analysis for 2012 publications in the journal confirmed this trend. An interesting new trend was the emerging presence of papers from a variety of Islamic countries including Egypt. Based on this trend, we shortly review the history and current structure of pharmacology in Egypt. It appears that the presence of Egyptian pharmacology in international journals including pharmacology journals has sharply been increasing over the last two decades. Challenges for a continuation of this encouraging trend are being discussed.\n\nNational water resource management as a global problem: The example of Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nElshorbagy, A. A.; Abdelkader, A. A.; Tuninetti, M.; Laio, F.; Ridolfi, L.; Fahmy, H.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe engineering redistribution of water remains limited in its spatial scope, when compared with the socioeconomic redistribution of water in its virtual form. Virtual water (VW) embedded in products has its own human-induced cycle by moving across the globe. There is a significant body of literature on global VW trade networks (VWTN), with most studies focused on the network structure and the variables controlling its behavior. It was shown that the importing nations will play an important role in the evolution of the network dynamics. The increased connectivity of the global network highlights the risk of systemic disruptions and the vulnerability of the global food, especially when exporting countries change to non-exporting ones. The existing models of VWTN characterize the properties of the network, along with its nodes and links. Acknowledging its contribution to understand the global redistribution of virtual water, hardly can this approach attract potential users to adopt it. The VW trade (VWT) modeling needs to be repositioned to allow resource managers and policy makers at various scales to benefit from it and link global VW dynamics to their local decisions. The aim of this research is to introduce a new modeling approach for the VWT where detailed national scale water management is nested within the coarser global VWTN. The case study of Egypt, the world biggest importer of wheat, is considered here because its population growth and limitations of water and arable land position it as a significant node in the global network. A set of potential scenarios of Egypt's future, driven by population growth, development plans, consumption patterns, technology change, and water availability are developed. The annual national food and water balance in every scenario is calculated to estimate the potential for VW export and import of Egypt. The results indicate that Egypt's demand for food might cause unexpectedly higher demands on other countries' water resources\n\nPath Dependence and Universal Health Coverage: The Case of Egypt\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFouda, Ayman; Paolucci, Francesco\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUniversal health coverage (UHC) is the big objective in health policy which several countries are seeking to achieve. Egypt is no different and its endeavors to attain UHC have been going on since the 1960s. This article discusses the status of UHC in Egypt using theories of political science and economics by analyzing the historical transformations in the Egyptian health system and its institutional settings. This article then specifically examines the path dependence theory against the sociopolitical background of Egypt and assesses any pattern between the theory and the current UHC status in Egypt. The important finding of this analysis is that the health policies and reforms in Egypt have been significantly influenced and limited by its historical institutional structure and development. Both the health policies and the institutional settings adopted a dependent path that limited Egyptâs endeavors to achieve the universal coverage. This dependent path also yielded many of the present-day challenges as in the weaknesses of the healthcare financing system and the inability to extend health coverage to the poor and the informal sector. These challenges subsequently had a negative impact on the accessibility of the healthcare services.

We characterized 866 isolates of C. maydis collected from 14 governates in Egypt, 7 in the Nile River Delta and 7 in southern (Middle and Upper) Egypt, with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The four AFLP primer-pair combinations generated 68 bands, 25 of which were polymorphic, resulting in 52 clonal haplotypes that clustered the 866 isolates into four phylogenetic lineages. Three lineages were found in both the Nile River Delta and southern Egypt. Lineage IV, the most diverse group (20 haplotypes), was recovered only from governates in the Nile River Delta. In some locations, one lineage dominated (up to 98% of the isolates recovered) and, from some fields, only a single haplotype was recovered. Under field conditions in Egypt, there is no evidence that C. maydis reproduces sexually. The nonuniform geographic distribution of the pathogen lineages within the country could be due to differences in climate or in the farming system, because host material differs in susceptibility and C. maydis lineages differ in pathogenicity.\n\nArea Handbook Series: Sudan: A Country Study\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1991-06-01\n\nmajor courts and mag- istrate’s courts.

Currently, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Egypt is around 15.6% of all adults aged 20 toÂ 79. To describe the epidemiology, principal causes, associated risk factors, cultural aspects, and challenges that may contribute to the rapid rise in T2D in Egypt. Review of papers in PubMed and relevant gray literature. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has identified Egypt as the ninth leading country in the world for the number of patients with T2D. The prevalence of T2D in Egypt was almost tripled over the last 2 decades. This sharp rise could be attributed to either an increased pattern of the traditional risk factors for T2D such as obesity and physical inactivity and change in eating pattern or other risk factors unique to Egypt. These include increased exposure to environmental risk factors like pesticides and increased prevalence of chronic hepatitis C. Prevention, early identification, and effective intervention are integral components of effective T2D care in Egypt. These strategies may reduce the expanding economic burden associated with T2D care. Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the current study, we integrate five distinct modeling platforms to simulate the potential risk of social unrest in Egypt resulting from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Blue Nile in Ethiopia. The five platforms simulate hydrology, agriculture, economy, human ecology, and human psychology/behavior, and show how impacts derivedmoreÂ Â» from development initiatives in one sector (e.g., hydrology) might ripple through to affect other sectors and how development and security concerns may be triggered across the region. This approach evaluates potential consequences, intended and unintended, associated with strategic policy actions that span the development-security nexus at the national, regional, and international levels. Model results are not intended to provide explicit predictions, but rather to provide system-level insight for policy makers into the dynamics among these interacting sectors, and to demonstrate an approach to evaluating short- and long-term policy trade-offs across different policy domains and stakeholders. The GERD project is critical to government-planned development efforts in Ethiopia but is expected to reduce downstream freshwater availability in the Nile Basin, fueling fears of negative social and economic impacts that could threaten stability and security in Egypt. We tested these hypotheses and came to the following preliminary conclusions. First, the GERD will have an important short-term impact on water availability, food production, and hydropower production in Egypt, depending on the short- term reservoir fill rate. Second, the GERD will have a very small\n\nWomen's Agency and Fertility: Recent Evidence from Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nSamari, Goleen\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFertility reached a two decade high of 3.5 births per woman in Egypt in 2014. Lower status of women is associated with higher fertility. Majority of the studies on women's agency and fertility rely on individual level cross-sectional data from South Asia, which limits the understanding of variation among communities and the direction of the relationship between women's agency and fertility in other global contexts. This study examines the relationship between women's agency and fertility longitudinally and among communities in the most populous country in the Middle East - Egypt. For 3,795 ever married women 15 to 49 years old in the 2006 and 2012 Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey, multilevel models are estimated for having given birth and number of births between 2006 and 2012. Contrary to expectation, women with more agency with greater participation in household decision-making and mobility are, in fact, more likely to have had a birth and have a greater total number of births. Only women with more egalitarian attitudes are associated with fewer births. Community membership explains 5% of the variation in fertility. Since social norms in Egypt favor a higher number of births and labor market participation among women is low, women with agency could be fulfilling social expectations of having children and choosing to have more children.\n\nThe path towards universal health coverage in the Arab uprising countries Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaleh, Shadi S; Alameddine, Mohamad S; Natafgi, Nabil M; Mataria, Awad; Sabri, Belgacem; Nasher, Jamal; Zeiton, Moez; Ahmad, Shaimaa; Siddiqi, Sameen\n\n2014-01-25\n\nThe constitutions of many countries in the Arab world clearly highlight the role of governments in guaranteeing provision of health care as a right for all citizens. However, citizens still have inequitable health-care systems. One component of such inequity relates to restricted financial access to health-care services. The recent uprisings in the Arab world, commonly referred to as the Arab spring, created a sociopolitical momentum that should be used to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). At present, many countries of the Arab spring are considering health coverage as a priority in dialogues for new constitutions and national policy agendas. UHC is also the focus of advocacy campaigns of a number of non-governmental organisations and media outlets. As part of the health in the Arab world Series in The Lancet, this report has three overarching objectives. First, we present selected experiences of other countries that had similar social and political changes, and how these events affected their path towards UHC. Second, we present a brief overview of the development of health-care systems in the Arab world with regard to health-care coverage and financing, with a focus on Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen. Third, we aim to integrate historical lessons with present contexts in a roadmap for action that addresses the challenges and opportunities for progression towards UHC.

A cohort of 30 families with suspected LGMD from Assiut, Egypt, was studied using immunohistochemistry, homozygosity mapping, Sanger sequencing, and whole exome sequencing. Six families were confirmed to have pathogenic mutations, 4 in SGCA and 2 in DMD. Of these, 3 families harbored a single nonsense mutation in SGCA, suggesting that this may be a common mutation in Assiut, Egypt, originating from a founder effect. The Assiut region in Egypt appears to share at least several of the common LGMD genes found in other parts of the world. It is notable that 4 of the 6 mutations were ascertained by means of whole exome sequencing, even though it was the last approach adopted. This illustrates the power of this technique for identifying causative mutations for muscular dystrophies. Muscle Nerve 54: 690-695, 2016.

A cultural, social and microbiological synopsis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWassili, J H; Baradaeus, Cyril\n\n2012-10-01\n\nEgypt, whose soil germinated the first civilization, monotheism, refined ethics and culture of sharing the abundance of extracted natural resources among its populace became the crucible proliferating de-novo genotypes of organic and moral maladies. The enigma is these mutations are synchronized by several factors, namely; failing medical health, if there is any, abundant filth, cultural bankruptcy, over population, dogmatic militarism, societal deprivation and characterization, etc. These domineering ingredients fossilized Egypt as of 1952 coup in an irrevocable national apoptosis, together with the crippled social justice and imbalanced distribution of wealth among Egyptians, rates of bacterial and viral evolution to second generation resistant to known medical interventions are expected to exponentially accelerate. Therefore, it deemed essential to elaborate on pollution and psychosis-induced inflammations and grievous crimes evoked by dogmatic cults at the breeding source, e.g., ghettos and sporadic locations of the homeless in Cairo, Alexandria and Upper Egyptian villages. While this second generation of viral and bacterial diseases could labor plagues threatening the precariously maintained so-called social fabric of Middle Eastern countries, that are uniquely segregating its populace according to their dogmatic affiliations and soaked into intolerance, it would definitely compromise the integrity of the expensively managed medical care system of developed countries.\n\n[Ideal family size in Arab countries].\n\nPubMed\n\nAyad, M\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThis study on the ideal family size in Arab countries, is based on the findings of the World Fertility Survey led in 8 Arab countries (Egypt, 1980; Jordan, 1976; Morocco, 1980; Mauritania, 1981; Sudan, 1979; Syria, 1978; Tunisia, 1978; and Arab Republic of Yemen, 1979). During these surveys, a questionnaire was presented to a specimen of 2,500 to 8,500 women, 1st to married and fertile women, then to childless or pregnant women. The study of the responses shows that a great majority of Arab women desire a large family. Less than 20% of them do not want to have another child in the future in Mauritania, Sudan, and Yemen; between 37% and 53% in the 5 other countries. The total number of children wanted is 4.9 in Morocco, 5.4 in Yemen, 6.1 in Sudan, 6.3 in Jordan and Syria, and 8.7 in Mauritania. Women prefer to have boys rather than girls. In Egypt and Tunisia, respectively, 83% and 66% do not want to have another child when there are as many boys as girls in the family. As expected, the more children a woman has, the less she wants to have another one. The more women use contraception and modern contraceptives, the less they want another child. Of the women who do not want another child, 67% are using contraception in Tunisia, 65% in Egypt, 50% in Syria, Morocco, and Jordan, but 25% in Sudan, 17% in Yemen, and 15% in Mauritania. The transition from natural fertility to planned fertility is very slow in Mauritania, Yemen, and Sudan, while Syria and Jordan present the beginning of an evolution. The decline of fertility is faster in Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco. In Arab countries, the weight of the traditional patriarchal family, and the lack of education and social opportunities for women is slowing down demographic transition.\n\nTrend of application of World Health Organization control strategy of tuberculosis in Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaad-Hussein, Amal; Mohammed, Asmaa M\n\n2014-09-01\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) control policy for tuberculosis (TB) includes Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccine at birth, case detection, and treatment of cases with directly observed therapy short-course (DOTS). This policy has been applied through the Ministry of Health and Population in Egypt for more than 30years. The controversies about the efficacy of the BCG vaccination against TB in adults initiate some suggestions for its discontinuation from compulsory vaccinations in countries with low incidence of TB. The present work aimed to study the trend of applying the WHO control policy for TB in Egypt among the Egyptian population throughout the last 20years (1992-2011). The documented database of the country, bibliographic review on MEDLINE, published studies and reports, WHO and EMRO databases that covered the period from 1992 to 2011 were used in this study. The incidence rate of all forms of TB (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) dropped by 50% from 34 cases to 17 cases per 100,000 population, as well as the prevalence rate declined by 60.6% from 71 cases per 100,000 population throughout the last 20years. Case detection and treatment success rates have increased throughout the studied period while it flat-lined over the past 6years which may need attention. The results of this study introduce an evidence-based recommendation for continuation of the WHO TB control policy in Egypt towards elimination of the disease.

It is expected to have significant impacts both in Egypt and around the world. Thus, the country is in need for taking action to prepare for the unavoidable effects of climate change, including the increase in water stress, the rise in sea level, and the rapidly increasing gap between the limited water availability and the escalating demand for water in the country. Also, weather and climate play a significant role in people's health. Direct impacts of climate change on the Egyptians public health may include also increased prevalence of human parasitic diseases. Climate could strongly influence parasitic diseases transmitted through intermediate hosts.

It is the country with the highest population density in the Middle East, Northern Africa and the Mediterranean basin. This review summarizes the prevalence, reservoirs, sources of human infection and control regimes of common bacterial, parasitic and viral zoonoses in animals and humans in Egypt. There is a gap of knowledge conerning the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases at the human-animal interface in different localities in Egypt. Some zoonotic agents are âexoticâ for Egypt (e.g., MERS-CoV and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus), others are endemic (e.g., Brucellosis, Schistosomiasis and Avian influenza). Transboundary transmission of emerging pathogens from and to Egypt occurred via different routes, mainly importation/exportation of apparently healthy animals or migratory birds. Control of the infectious agents and multidrug resistant bacteria in the veterinary sector is on the frontline for infection control in humans. The implementation of control programs significantly decreased the prevalence of some zoonoses, such as schistosomiasis and fascioliasis, in some localities within the country. Sustainable awareness, education and training targeting groups at high risk (veterinarians, farmers, abattoir workers, nurses, etc.) are important to lessen the burden of zoonotic diseases among Egyptians. There is an urgent need for collaborative surveillance and intervention plans for the control of these diseases in Egypt.

Egypt is the most ancient tourist country in the world. Several health fact-finding missions in the last few years were made to this small country that is frequently defined by the Valley of the Nile. With the spreading deserts on either side, or a very rich heritage of ancient relics, these scenic vistas are without equal elsewhere in the world. Although there are significant cultural differences among the population, Egypt has a long history of ethnic and religious compassion. Among the many rarities, main tourist attractions include the three great Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx, amazing ancient wonders of the world. These fact-finding missions included how health and medical care are defined, how people and culture are intertwined with its physical features, land use, and the economy and its resources.\n\nMind the Gap: The Human Rights of Children with Intellectual Disabilities in Egypt\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGobrial, E.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground: Children with intellectual disabilities (IDs) have the same human value as other children and are entitled to their basic human rights.

Comparisons were made between individuals having experienced SP at least once in a lifetime from Cairo, Egypt (nâ=â89), Copenhagen, Denmark (nâ=â59), and the American University in Cairo, Egypt (nâ=â44). As hypothesized, participants from the general Egyptian population were more likely to endorse supernatural causal explanation of their SP compared to participants from Denmark; participants from the American University in Cairo were less likely to endorse supernatural causes of their SP compared to participants from the general Egyptian population. Moreover, participants from the American University in Cairo were marginally significantly more likely to endorse supernatural causes of their SP compared to participants from Denmark. Additionally, we explored which culturally bound explanations and beliefs about SP existed in Egypt and Denmark. We found that nearly half (48%) of the participants from the general Egyptian population believed their SP to be caused by the Jinn, a spirit-like creature with roots in Islamic tradition, which constitutes a culturally bound interpretation of the phenomenology of SP in this region of the world. Case studies are presented to illustrate these findings.\n\nBurden of stroke in Egypt: current status and opportunities.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbd-Allah, Foad; Moustafa, Ramez Reda\n\n2014-12-01\n\nMiddle East and North Africa (MENA) countries have a diversity of populations with similar life style, dietary habits, and vascular risk factors that may influence stroke risk, prevalence, types, and disease burden. Egypt is the most populated nation in the Middle East with an estimated 85.5 million people. In Egypt, according to recent estimates, the overall prevalence rate of stroke is high with a crude prevalence rate of 963/100,000 inhabitants. In spite of disease burden, yet there is a huge evidence practice gap. The recommended treatments for ischemic stroke that are guideline include systematic supportive care in a stroke unit or stroke center is still deficient. In addition, the frequency of thrombolysis in Egypt is very low for many reasons; the major one is that the health insurance system is not covering thrombolysis therapy in nonprivate sectors so patients must cover the costs using their own personal savings; otherwise, they will not receive treatment. Another important factor is the pronounced delay in prehospital and in hospital management of acute stroke. Improvement of stroke care in Egypt should be achieved through multi and interdisciplinary approach including public awareness, physicians' education, and synergistic approach to stroke care with Emergency Medical System.

Whereas HCV mother-to-child infection is a well-established transmission route, there are no estimates of HCV infections resulting from vertical transmission for any country, including Egypt. The aim of this study was to estimate the absolute number of new HCV infections resulting from vertical transmission in Egypt. We developed a conceptual framework of HCV vertical transmission, expressed in terms of a mathematical model and based on maternal HCV antibody and viremia. The mathematical model estimated the number of HCV vertical infections nationally and for six subnational areas. Applying two vertical transmission risk estimates to the 2008 Egyptian birth cohort, we estimated that between 3,080 and 5,167 HCV infections resulted from vertical transmission among children born in 2008. HCV vertical transmission may account for half of incident cases in the <5-year age group. Disproportionately higher proportions of vertical infections were estimated in Lower Rural and Upper Rural subnational areas. This geographical clustering was a result of higher-area-level HCV prevalence among women and higher fertility rates. Vertical transmission is one of the primary HCV infection routes among children<5 years in Egypt. The absolute number of vertical transmissions and the young age at infection highlight a public health concern. These findings also emphasize the need to quantify the relative contributions of other transmission routes to HCV incidence in Egypt. Â© 2014 The Authors.

The study seeks improvements in the methods of evaluating public sector projects in Egypt. To approaches are employed: (1) project identification to optimally allocate Egypt's and World Bank's resources; (2) project appraisal to assess the economic viability and efficiency of investments. The electricity sector is compared with the agriculture sector as a means of employing project identification for priority ordering of investment for development in Egypt. The key criteria for evaluation are the impacts of developments of each sector upon Egypt's national objectives and needs. These includemoreÂ Â» employment opportunities, growth, alleviation of poverty, cross comparison of per capita consumption in each sector, economic rate of return, national security, balance of payments and foreign debt. The allocation of scarce investments would have been more efficient in agriculture than in electricity in meeting Egypt's national objectives and needs. World Bank lending programs in Egypt reveal a priority ordering of electricity over agriculture and rural development. World Bank development projects in Egypt have not been optimally identified, and its programs have not followed an efficient allocation of World Bank's and Egypt's resources. The key parameters in evaluating economic viability and efficiency of development projects are: (1) the discount rate (the opportunity cost of public funds); (2) the exchange rate; and (3) the cost of major inputs, as approximated by shadow prices of labor, water, electricity, and transportation for development projects. Alternative approaches to estimating the opportunity cost of public funds are made. The parameters in evaluating the efficiency of projects have not been accurately estimated in the appraisal stage of the World Bank projects in Egypt, resulting in false or misleading information concerning the economic viability and efficiency of the projects.Â«Â less\n\nCo-circulation of paramyxo- and influenza viruses in pigeons in Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nMansour, Shimaa M G; Mohamed, Fakry F; Eid, Amal A M; Mor, Sunil K; Goyal, Sagar M\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIn recent years, avian influenza virus (AIV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) have caused large-scale outbreaks in many countries, including Egypt. The culling and vaccination strategies have failed to control both viruses in Egypt. In this study, we investigated the outbreaks of nervous manifestations and deaths in pigeons between 2013 and 2015. The H5N1 subtype of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and pigeon paramyxovirus-1, an antigenic variant of NDV, were found to be the cause; AIV and pigeon paramyxovirus-1 were isolated from 61.3% (19/31) and 67.8% (21/31) of tested pigeons, respectively. Co-infection with both viruses was detected in 51.6% of pigeons (16/31). The AIV sequences showed PQGEKRRKKR/GLF motif at the haemagglutinin gene cleavage site, which is typical of the highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype. The phylogenetic tree showed that the highly pathogenic avian influenza belonged to clade 2.2.1.2. The NDV sequences carried one of the three motifs, 112 GKQGRL 117 , 112 KRQKRF 117 or 112 RRQKRF 117 , at the fusion protein cleavage site and were classified as genotypes I, VI and II in NDV-class II, respectively. This indicated that different genotypes of NDV can circulate simultaneously among pigeons. Further analysis revealed the clustering of some sequences in sub-genotypes Ia and VIb.2. To the best of our knowledge, these sub-genotypes have not been previously reported from pigeons in Egypt. Our results should serve as a base for future studies on both viruses in Egypt.\n\nHotline in Egypt marks change in government attitude to AIDS.\n\nPubMed\n\n1995-10-01\n\nThe first 24-hour AIDS hotline in the Arab world will open in Cairo, Egypt, in October 1995. The opening of the new service marks a change in attitude on the part of the Egyptian government, which has maintained a discreet AIDS control program in the past. Approval from religious leaders was necessary for the new program to begin; the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) played a prominent role in negotiations. The \"Counsel and Hot Line Centre,\" which will be based in Imbala district, will employ 19 people, including two doctors and two psychologists. The Centre was funded with US$300,000 from the Ford Foundation. Currently, 478 persons with HIV infections and 110 people with AIDS have been reported. The ministry estimates that there are 5000-7000 persons with HIV infections in Egypt.

To determine the prevalence of ASB among pregnant women booking at El Hussein and Sayed Galal Hospitals in Al-Azhar University in Egypt; and to observe the relationship between ASB prevalence and risk factors such as socioeconomic level and personal hygiene. Obstetrics and gynaecology clinics of 2 university hospitals in the capital of Egypt. Both hospitals are teaching and referral hospitals receiving referrals from across over the country. They operate specialist antenatal clinics 6â days per week. A cross-sectional study combining the use of questionnaires and laboratory analysis was conducted in 171 pregnant women with no signs or symptoms of urinary tract infection (1 case was excluded). Samples of clean catch midstream urine were collected and cultured using quantitative urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed. Of 171 pregnant women, 1 case was excluded; 17 cases (10%, 95% CI 5.93% to 15.53%) were positive for ASB. There was a statistically significant relation between the direction of washing genitals and sexual activity per week-and ASB. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacteria followed by Klebsiella . Nitrofurantoin showed 100% sensitivity, while 88% of the isolates were resistant to cephalexin. The prevalence of ASB seen in pregnant women in 2 tertiary hospitals in Egypt was 10%. E. coli and Klebsiella are the common organisms isolated. The direction of washing genitals and sexual activity significantly influences the risk of ASB. Pregnant women should be screened early for ASB during pregnancy; appropriate treatment should be given for positive cases according to antibiotic sensitivity screening. Cephalexin is likely to be of limited use in this management. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The main objective of this work is to utilize 3-D automatic detection algorithm for urban slum in ENVISAT ASAR and Google Erath images were acquired in Cairo, Egypt using Fuzzy B-spline algorithm. The results show that fuzzy algorithm is the best indicator for chaotic urban slum as it can discriminate them from its surrounding environment. The combination of Fuzzy and B-spline then used to reconstruct 3-D of urban slam. The results show that urban slums, road network, and infrastructures are perfectly discriminated. It can therefore be concluded that fuzzy algorithm is an appropriate algorithm for chaotic urban slum automatic detection in ENVSIAT ASAR and Google Earth data.\n\nBranding the Green Education: Challenges Facing Implementation of Education for Sustainable Development in Egypt\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRamzy, Omar; Wahieb, Rasha\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDue to the scarcity in natural resources and the demand for green labour and economy, education for sustainable development (ESD) gained a great importance in developed countries, let alone developing ones.

In Egypt, assisted reproduction treatments are permitted, but third parties are banned, as in the rest of the Sunni Islamic world. Italy became similar to Egypt with a 2004 law ending third-party reproductive assistance. In multisectarian Lebanon, however, the Sunni/Catholic ban on third-party reproductive assistance has been lifted, because of Shia rulings emanating from Iran. Today, third-party reproductive assistance is provided in Lebanon to both Muslims and Christians, unlike in neighbouring Egypt and Italy. Such comparisons point to the need for understanding the complex interactions between law, religion, local moralities and reproductive practices for global bioethics.
