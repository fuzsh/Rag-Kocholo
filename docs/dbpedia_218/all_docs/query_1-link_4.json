        "text": "The 21st century witnessed many cultural effects of globalization, due to the information and technology revolutions. Hollywood is the strongest soft power instrument of America; it had a historical political role since the early 20th century and with the beginning of the 21st century the Western domination had a tremendous influence on many Asian and African cultures. Despite the outstanding culture of Egypt, the Egyptian soft power witnessed a great decline in the early 21st century. The study aims to investigate the impact of the Western cinema on African cultures. This study argues that Hollywood had a remarkable influence on the Egyptian youth, the teenagers (16-20) and the adults (21-30), in terms of language, lifestyle and values. The study investigates the data in light of the theory of Cultural Imperialism that applies on the Egyptian case study and tests the impact of the Western domination on the Egyptian youth. The study precisely tackles how the Western movies had impact on the Arabic language, how the Western lifestyle is imitated in Egypt, and the domination of the Western values that are totally incompatible with the society. The thesis is divided into five chapters, an introductory chapter, a chapter that explains the politics of cinema and provides a historical background of the American and the Egyptian cinemas, a chapter that tackles the survey and the focus groupsâ€™ analysis, and a chapter that explains the reasons behind the decline of the Egyptian soft power, and finally the conclusion of the thesis.\n\nJapan is also one of the successful countries in using public diplomacy to promote their foreign policy. Public diplomacy is an important way to build mutual understanding between Japan and other countries. Japanese pop culture is also part of a power, not only economically, but can also function as part of soft power. In an effort to introduce Japanese culture to the international world, including Indonesia. Japanese culture or better known as J-Pop is a series of cultures from Japan such as comics/manga, music, movies and fashion, and all of these J-Pop cultures that are most popular and loved by teenagers in Indonesia are fashion, comics and anime. And this of course also greatly influences the new habits that grow in the lives of teenagers or millennials in Indonesia. You could say that the millennial generation lives in the midst of the growing influence of various foreign cultures that have entered Indonesia, and one of them is J-Pop culture. Manga and Anime as One Form of Japanese Soft Power In international relations, Japan has long been known as one of the advanced industrial countries with a strong economic system.\n\nView"
