The Festival will welcome filmmakers, talent, media, industry professionals, and film fans for a 10-days celebration of global cinema.\n\nThe Festival is thrilled to announce that Cyrano, a musical romantic drama directed by award-winning British director Joe Wright and written by Erica Schmidt, based on Schmidt’s 2018 stage musical of the same name, will raise the curtain on the first edition. The beautiful re-imagining of the timeless tale stars four-time Emmy-winning Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, Hayley Bennett, Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Ben Mendelsohn.\n\nThe inaugural edition will close with the World Premiere of acclaimed Egyptian director Amr Salama’s Bara El Manhag.

To be able to start so strongly, with such a wide array of incredible storytelling from both the Arab world and further afield, is significant and speaks to the promising future of this Festival, both this year and beyond. The slate also underscores the diversity of cinema being presented at the Festival, with authentic stories from all over the world coming from both established and emerging filmmakers.”\n\nThe Festival will be celebrating women and will honour two outstanding talents to salute their extraordinary contribution to cinema and continue the Festival’s mission to celebrate incredible women in film. From Saudi Arabia, the Festival will honour Haifaa Al-Mansour, the first female Saudi filmmaker, who has helped boost the women’s empowerment movement across the region and is one of the most significant figures in the Saudi film industry. Her feature debut, Wadjda, was the first film to ever be shot in the Kingdom and was nominated for numerous international awards, including a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. She has since gone on to direct films and TV shows internationally and remains at the frontier of groundbreaking filmmaking.\n\nThe second honouree is Egyptian actress Laila Eloui, who has starred in more than 70 films Her onscreen presence continues to captivate, entertain and inspire audiences and actors alike.

The iconic Egyptian cinema legend is one of the most recognisable names in the entire region and considered one of the finest actors of her generation, having appeared in over 80 films and received more than 50 awards from national, regional and international film festivals for her work. From European cinema, iconic French actress Catherine Deneuve, who is renowned for her extraordinary contributions to film, will join the Festival celebrations.\n\nThere will also be three in-conversations that will give Festival-goers insight into the careers and achievements of Haifaa Al-Mansour, Tunisian actress Hend Sabry and acclaimed Franco Argentinian director Gaspar Noé, and Lebanese directors and artists Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige.\n\nThe Festival is also proud to honour Jack Lang, President of the Institut du Monde Arabe and former Minister of Culture and Minister of Education, in recognition of his incredible efforts to promote relations between Saudi Arabia and France and integral role in building a cultural bridge between the Arab world and France.\n\nFestival-goers will have the opportunity to attend Red Carpet Galas and watch standout, compelling films from world-renowned directors and featuring stellar performances at the Red Sea’s purpose-built, 900-seat Al Balad auditorium.\n\nThe lineup over the 9 days includes:\n\nAcademy Award nominated and Golden Globe winning director Hany Abu–Assad’s political and emotional thriller Huda’s Salon will open the Red Sea Competition on 07 December.
