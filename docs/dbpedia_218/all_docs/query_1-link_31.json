        "text": "The Egyptian film industry has gone through dramatic changes since the early 2000s. One tangible consequence of such changes was the production—whether intentional or not—of protest films that expressed opposition to prevailing viewpoints and sought to break the taboo on key sociopolitical issues. Not only do these films serve as historical documents reflecting the state of society, but they also proved to be efficient tools of soft influence and mobilization, and they contributed to the creation of a new dynamic that inspired people to take to the streets on 25 January 2011. Based on the analysis of a large sample of blockbuster films, this article sheds light on the roles played by Egyptian cinema between 2001 and 2011.\n\nThis chapter analyzes two recent Egyptian films, the personal feminist documentary, Cairo Chronicles (Tania Kamal-Eldin, 2004), and Out on the Street [Barra fil Shara‘] (Jasmina Metwaly/Philip Rizk, 2015), an innovative instance of filmed theater of the oppressed produced in the wake of the Arab Uprisings. The aim of the paper is to reveal, through critique, the superficiality and in some instances irrelevance of these albeit very different films’ ideologically similar critical receptions: Cairo Chronicles has been misrecognized, for instance, as no more than a personal work of diasporic nostalgia; and Out on the Street has been misunderstood as a phenomenological engagement with the inaccessibility of facts. This paper seeks to transcend these limited, if not entirely unfavorable, understandings in the better interests of explaining the films’ profound pedagogical import as a core element of their respective aesthetic structuring and thus of the centrality of their political engagement.\n\nIn my master thesis I focus on a comparative study of cinematic productions of the popular Egyptian films entailing a description of slum areas and the poor classes. Films produced in the 2000s present an imaginary cultural constellation that stirred controversy within the middle classes audience in regard to the portrayal of the poor, social mobility, and sociopolitical context in the last ten years of Husni Mubarak's rule. I am delineating the projections and reflections of middle class cultural elite and audience on the poor dwellers of the growing slum areas of Cairo, as part of the reflexive discourse of the Egyptian middle class ethic and conception of modernity. In the light of political and economic transformations, cultural productions are scrutinized from the ethnographic lens to produce a comprehensive analysis of social positions, signs, and signifiers portrayed in the Egyptian cultural scenery, few years before 2011 uprising.\n\nI have tried, as much as possible, to limit the use of Arabic transcription throughout. However, in those rare instances where it is necessary, the format I use is a simplified version of the commonly cited transcription found in the Encyclopedia of Islam (Bosworth, 1960). Moreover, Arabic names, places and titles are not always strictly transcribed, but referred to as most commonly referenced. It is worth noting that they may appear differently in other published materials.\n\nEgyptian films from the 1930s through the 1950s reflected the diversity of Egypt's cities. This article argues that a subtle but notable shift in the semiotics of otherness—from a Levantine idiom to a less fluid construction of ethno-religious identity—occurs over this period in Egyptian cinema. Analysis of the films Salamah fi khayr [Salama is Fine] and al-cIzz bahdala [Mistreated by Affluence], both released in 1937, reveals what the author identifies as a \"Levantine\" idiom. These films articulate an ethics of coexistence, adopt a visual language of inclusion, and represent identity as fluid and mutable. Postwar \"ethnic comedies\" such as Faṭimah wa-Marika wa-Rashil [Fatima, Marika, and Rachel, (1949)] and Ḥasan wa-Murqus wa-Kohayn [Hasan, Marcus, and Cohen (1954)], continue to take Egyptian diversity for granted. However, as this article demonstrates, the characteristics that had defined Levantine cinema—ethics, aesthetics, and fluidity of identity—are no longer present. All the films under discussion treat ethno-religious and national identity as performance. However, that being said, the valences attached to the comic appropriation of an identity not one's own via role play, assumed identities, and sudden, disorienting class mobility shift over time in nuanced but significant ways. In establishing the idioms of \"Levantine cinema\" and \"ethnic comedies,\" this article also takes as a counterpoint the 2008 film Ḥasan wa-Murqus [Hasan and Marcus] which draws upon these earlier Egyptian cinematic traditions in constructing its own discourse of coexistence."
