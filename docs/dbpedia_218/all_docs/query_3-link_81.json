With Gaza until victory\"\n\n[Fri, 02 Aug 2024 17:49:45 +0300]\n\nIBB August 02. 2024 (Saba) - Ibb province has witnessed mass marches in 56 squares entitled \"Loyalty to the blood of the martyrs, with Gaza until victory\" in continuation of supporting the Palestinian people and resistance.\n\nParticipants in a march in Ibb city, with the participation of Governor Abdulwahid Salah, and a number of members of the Parliament and the Shura Council, condemned the Zionist terrorist genocide crimes against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the occupied territories.\n\nThe participants denounced the assassination crimes committed by the Zionist enemy, the latest of which was the cowardly operation that targeted the martyr Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement \"Hamas\", and the martyr leader Fouad Shukr in the southern suburb of Beirut.\n\nThey denounced the international silence regarding the war of extermination that the Palestinian people are being subjected to in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories, stressing the right of the Palestinian people to resist the occupation and respond to its aggression using all means that guarantee their basic rights, liberate their occupied territories, and restore their state and sovereignty.\n\nThe people of Ibb held the American administration fully responsible for the crimes, massacres, and systematic destruction of civilian life in the Gaza Strip that have occurred and are occurring.\n\nThe mobilization officer Abdul Fattah Ghallab, the assistant commander of the Fourth Military Region, Brigadier General Mohammed al-Khalid, and the presidents of Ibb University, Dr. Nasr al-Hajili, and the Court of Appeal, Judge Mohammed al-Shihab, participated in the march in the

al-Asloum, al-Ajoum, Al-Sha'awir, Najd Al-Adan and al-Amoos, and the people of Madhikha district gathered in marches in the center of the directorate and al-Afyoush, Halyan and Haza

Palestinian people.\n\nThe participants in the marches praised the steadfastness of the Palestinian people in the face of the Israeli war machine, stressing their absolute undermining of the revolutionary leadership by taking appropriate options to deter the Zionist enemy that is committing the most heinous crimes against the Palestinian people in Gaza.\n\nThey called on the Arab countries to take a unified position and sever relations with Israel and cancel the agreements signed with it in addition to boycotting the countries that support Israel and normalize relations with it, urging the trial of Israel and those who supported it as war criminals for violating international laws and conventions.\n\nA statement issued by the marches blessed the steadfastness, perseverance and patience of the Palestinian people, and the heroism, courage and bravery of their valiant resistance, stressing the continuation of the Yemeni people in organizing demonstrations, events and popular and official activities in support of, backing and advocating for Palestine.\n\nThe statement renewed the emphasis on the continuation of general mobilization and the mobilization to training and rehabilitation camps for the general mobilization forces in the governorate's directorates, to acquire the combat skills and experiences required for the battle with the enemy.\n\nIt appreciated the response of the Yemeni armed forces to the popular calls represented in intensifying qualitative operations in the Red and Arabian Seas, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, and in the south of occupied Palestine, blessing the qualitative development in the monitoring and targeting operations with precision.\n\nThe statement addressed the Occupation enemy, saying, \"You know that assassinating the leaders of the resistance will not save you from your inevitable fate, which is annihilation,\" considering the assassinations an escape from the defeat it suffered at the hands of the Mujahideen in the Gaza Strip and an attempt to restore the prestige and deterrence that fell on October 7 with a number of painful blows against the occupying enemy.\"\n\nThe statement called on the Arab and Islamic peoples and all the free people of the world to continue activating the weapon of the economic boycott of American and Israeli goods and the companies that support them, due to the economic impact this has on the enemies.\n\nIt also called for continuing the movement in activities and stands supporting the Palestinian prisoners and going out tomorrow, Saturday, to organize
