        "text": "C Violations of User Rights\n\nC1 1.00-6.00 pts0-6 pts\n\nDo the constitution or other laws fail to protect rights such as freedom of expression, access to information, and press freedom, including on the internet, and are they enforced by a judiciary that lacks independence? 0.000 6.006\n\nThe constitution contains language that nominally guarantees freedom of the media, stating that Egyptians “have the right to own and issue newspapers and establish visual, audio, and digital media outlets.” Under Article 34, the government is given the role of preserving online security, while under Article 70, the government is responsible for regulating online newspapers and visual and radio broadcast stations. Article 71 forbids censorship and states that no individuals should be jailed for crimes committed through publication. However, exceptions are made for censorship in “times of war or general mobilization,” and penalties for “incitement to violence” and “discrimination amongst citizens or impugning the honor of individuals” are to be specified by law. Article 211 outlines the establishment of a national media council tasked with regulating “the affairs of radio, television, and printed and digital press” and ensuring that the press maintains a commitment to “professional and ethical standards, as well as national security needs.”\n\nIn April 2019, the parliament approved amendments to the constitution that would allow Sisi to stay in power until 2030, extending his current four-year term to six years and permitting him to seek an additional six-year term in 2024. Among other changes, the amendments granted the president greater control over the judiciary and expanded the political and judicial authority of the military.\n\nIn October 2021, President Sisi terminated the state of emergency, which was first introduced in April 2017 and renewed 11 times. That said, numerous laws that threaten freedom of expression, such as the 2015 antiterrorism law (see C2), remain in effect. Furthermore, the government passed a number of amendments to existing legislation that codify many of the provisions from the emergency law.\n\nIn November 2019, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared that freedom of expression is protected in Egypt, except when it targets state institutions, transcends the constitution or law, or violates international obligations. Finally, he asserted that only the judiciary can investigate these cases and that defendants have the rights and necessary safeguards to defend themselves.\n\nThe SCMR was created in 2016, with the power to fine and suspend media organizations. The constitution permits the trial of civilians who break these laws in military courts, despite objections from political activists.\n\nC2 1.00-4.00 pts0-4 pts\n\nAre there laws that assign criminal penalties or civil liability for online activities, particularly those that are protected under international human rights standards? 0.000 4.004\n\nThe legal framework that governs online activity restricts freedom of expression in a variety of ways. Defamation is considered a criminal offense and included in the penal code.\n\nThe 2015 antiterrorism law broadened the scope of crimes that are considered terrorism and prescribed harsh penalties for nonviolent acts. Article 27 establishes a minimum five-year prison sentence for creating a website that incites violence, hosts content that misleads authorities on terrorism cases, or communicates with or organizes terrorist groups. Activists argued that the broad language of the law could apply to any peaceful political party or advocacy group. Finally, journalists face heavy fines for disputing official accounts of militant attacks. In March 2019, a parliamentary committee proposed amendments that prescribe severe penalties for expressing opinions online. Ostensibly promoting extremist ideology could carry a 10-year prison sentence, while promoting terrorist acts, extremist ideology, or ideas and beliefs that advocate violence could result in imprisonment of 15 years.\n\nIn 2015, President Sisi issued a separate law broadening the definition of “terrorist entities” to include anyone who threatens public order “by any means,” allowing the state to draw up lists of alleged terrorists or terrorist organizations. The law was met with skepticism from legal experts and human rights activists, who said that its vague wording could allow the state to designate political parties, student unions, or human rights organizations as terrorist groups. In February 2020, the parliament approved amendments to the definition of “a terrorist entity” and removed satellite channels, radio stations, and social media from the list of alleged terrorist groups in response to internal government backlash.\n\nAmendments to the law on states of emergency, the antiterrorism law, and the criminal code were rushed through in 2017 after terrorist attacks on three Coptic Christian churches. The amendments allowed for the indefinite detention of individuals suspected of threatening national security through the use of special emergency courts. The right to appeal the decisions of such courts and obtain a fair trial were curtailed. Police may also detain individuals for seven days without bringing them before a judge or prosecutor.\n\nIn August 2018, the president signed the Anti-Cyber and Information Technology Crimes Law, or Law No. 175 of 2018. It authorizes the blocking of websites that are deemed a threat to national security and punishes individuals who visit banned websites with up to one year in prison. Creators or managers of websites that are later banned could face up to two years in prison.\n\nDuring the coverage period, the Egyptian parliament approved a bill that would criminalize the publication of fake news during a health crisis. The law, presumably a result of the spread of disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, would include a yearlong prison sentence and a fine of 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($635) for “anyone who deliberately publishes or spreads false news or tendentious rumors related to the situation of an epidemic.” As the bill stands, only journalists would be exempt from prosecution.\n\nC3 1.00-6.00 pts0-6 pts\n\nAre individuals penalized for online activities, particularly those that are protected under international human rights standards? 0.000 6.006\n\nInternet users in Egypt operate in a highly repressive environment. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), there was a decline in the total number of imprisoned journalists throughout 2021, however, Egypt remains one of the world’s worst jailers of journalists. In many cases, the government justifies these arrests under the guise of “counterterrorism.” In addition to fines, arrests, and prison sentences, some civil society leaders have faced travel bans and asset freezes.\n\nBetween July and September 2021, the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) documented 13 violations against internet users including arrests for political or “moral” reasons and charging 3 already-detained activists for previous online posts. Such practices are meant to coerce online users into self-censorship and prevent them from publishing content that is critical of the government.\n\nSince the state of emergency was lifted (see C1), the Emergency State Security Courts no longer examine criminal cases, however, the courts continued proceedings against a number of human rights defenders and journalists. Rights groups heavily criticized some of these trials, during which the defendants were not allowed to mount a defense or deliberate with their lawyers.\n\nThe following were some of the more notable new criminal cases involving online posts and commentary during the coverage period:\n\nIn January 2022, prominent women’s rights activist Amal Fathy was sentenced to a year in prison after she criticized authorities for their “failure to protect women from sexual harassment” in a Facebook video.\n\nIn January 2022, Adel Morsi Ahmed, a journalist with Al-Manar, was arrested after criticizing security officials in Assiut Governorate on his Facebook account. He was charged with joining a terrorist group and spreading false news. It is unclear if he is still being detained.\n\nIn November 2021, Hossam Bahgat, the executive director and founder of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), was charged with “insulting the elections authority,” “spreading false news,” and “using a social media account to commit these crimes.” Bahgat had been arrested in December 2020 after he published a Twitter post that condemned alleged corruption during the country’s 2020 parliamentary elections. He was fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($635).\n\nUpon his arrival in Egypt in February 2021, Ahmed Samir Santawy, an Egyptian researcher and anthropology student at a university in Vienna, was forcibly disappeared for five days and interrogated about his research on women’s sexual and reproductive rights. He was also reportedly tortured by National Security Agency officials (see C7). In June 2021, Santawy was sentenced to four years in prison on charges of publishing “false news” on social media that condemned human rights violations in Egypt and the state’s mishandling of the pandemic.\n\nIn July 2021, content creator Nancy Ayman, known on social media as Moka Hegazy, was arrested and later charged with “promoting immorality and debauchery and infringing on public morals by publishing immoral videos on social media.” The prosecution also ordered the arrest of an otherwise unidentified person named Moaz, for allegedly helping Hegazy film and publish videos of her dancing. In February 2022, Hegazy was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nIn July 2021, journalist Abdel Nasser Salama was arrested after publishing a Facebook post that called upon President Sisi to resign because of the way he handled the water management dispute with Ethiopia. He was charged with spreading false news and funding and joining a terrorist group and put in pretrial detention for 15 days.\n\nIn July 2021, TikTok influencer Yasmine Abdel Razek El-Fouly (known as Hohos girl) and her videographer were detained after posting videos that allegedly violated “public morals and values.” In September 2021, a court in Alexandria sentenced El-Fouly and her videographer to three years in prison and ordered each to pay a fine of 200,000 Egyptian pounds ($10,552), on charges of “inciting immorality” and debauchery by broadcasting videos on TikTok.\n\nIn July 2021, after posting a video on Facebook calling on officials to send his son back to work at the Ministry of Interior’s traffic department, Fawzy Belal was arrested at his workplace in Alexandria. In August 2021, the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) charged him with joining a terrorist group and detained him for 15 days pending investigation.\n\nIn September 2021, after posting a video that satirically addressed the poor living conditions and high prices in Egypt, Nagy Fawzy Ali Moawad and his nephew Taha Hamd were charged with joining a terrorist group, spreading false news, and misusing social media. They were detained for 15 days pending investigation.\n\nIn March 2021, human rights activist Sanaa Seif was sentenced to 18 months in prison for “broadcasting fake news and rumors” regarding the spread of COVID-19 and health conditions in Egypt. Seif, who had been held in pretrial detention since June 2020, was released in December 2021 after completing her sentence.\n\nIn April 2020, university student Haneen Hossam was detained for allegedly “inciting debauchery” and “promoting human trafficking” among Egyptian women on TikTok by publishing a video explaining how to use the app for financial gain. That July, the Cairo Economic Misdemeanor Court sentenced her to two years in prison and a fine of 300,000 Egyptian pounds ($19,000). In June 2021, she faced charges carrying a 10 year prison sentence and a fine of 200,000 Egyptian pounds ($10,552). Her trial was postponed, and in April 2022 she was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nIn May 2020, social media influencer and director of the Likee app, Mawada Eladhm, was detained for “violating family principles and values in Egyptian society” and “establishing, managing, and using [websites and social media accounts] with the aim of committing those crimes.” In July, Eladhm and three Likee staff members were each sentenced to two years in prison and fined 300,000 Egyptian pounds ($19,100). Eladhm was charged with posting “indecent” dance videos and “violating the values and principles of the Egyptian family,” along with other charges. In June 2021, she was sentenced 6 years in prison and fined 200,000 Egyptian pounds ($10,552).\n\nIn an effort to bypass the Criminal Procedures Law, which outlaws the extension of pretrial detention for more than four years, authorities have embarked on a practice of “recycling defendants.” Many human rights activists received renewed detentions on old or new cases.\n\nThe following are examples from the coverage period of the Egyptian authorities’ practice of recycling detainees. These people were charged before the coverage period, then received new sentences during this coverage period:\n\nIn September 2019, blogger Mohamed Ibrahim ‘Oxygen’ was arrested on new charges after being released on probation in July 2019. In October 2019, a Cairo criminal court ordered his detention on charges related to “membership of a terrorist organization,” “defamation,” and “misuse of social media.” In February 2020, his detention was renewed for 15 days. Shortly before his expected November 2020 release date, he received an additional charge for membership of a terrorist organization and was detained pending an investigation. In December 2021, the Misdemeanors Emergency State Security Court in Cairo sentenced Oxygen to four years in prison on charges of “spreading false news undermining national security.”\n\nIn September 2019, prominent activist and lawyer Mahienour El-Masry was arrested and held in pretrial detention. Her detention was renewed for 45 days in December 2020 and again in January 2021. In July 2021, El-Masry was released pending investigation into charges of publishing false news.\n\nIn September 2019, Alaa Abdel Fattah, a prominent activist and blogger, who was jailed for five years and released on probation in March 2019, was arrested. It was reported that Abdel Fattah was beaten during his detention in Tora. In July 2020, Abdel Fattah’s detention was renewed for the third time. In December 2021, the Misdemeanors Emergency State Security Court in Cairo sentenced Alaa Abdel Fattah to five years in prison on charges of “spreading false news undermining national security.” In April 2022, Abdel Fattah started a hunger strike protesting his detention.\n\nIn October 2019, reporter, blogger, and Tahrir News social media coordinator Esraa Abdel Fattah, was arrested by security officers and was reportedly beaten and forced to surrender her mobile phone password. Her detention was further renewed several times pending an ongoing investigation. Abdel Fattah was released in July 2021.\n\nIn November 2019, freelance reporter Solafa Magdy, blogger and freelance journalist Mohamed Salah, and freelance photojournalist Hossam El-Sayyad were arrested by plainclothes security officers. They were charged with membership in a banned group, and Magdy and Salah were further charged with disseminating false news. In August 2020, the state prosecutor’s office issued the three defendants new charges for actions they allegedly committed while in prison, accused them of membership in a terrorist group and of spreading false news, and extended their pretrial detention. In April 2021, Magdy and El-Sayyad were released. However, Salah’s detention has been renewed.\n\nC4 1.00-4.00 pts0-4 pts\n\nDoes the government place restrictions on anonymous communication or encryption? 1.001 4.004\n\nCertain laws undermine the anonymity of communication in Egypt. In 2010, the NTRA issued a regulation that requires distributors of SIM cards to collect the personal data from users before the cards can be activated. In recent years, the NTRA has sought to remove dormant and unregistered SIMs to promote the credibility of the Egyptian market.\n\nIndividuals seeking to register a web address using Egypt’s .eg domain must submit their personal data and copies of their national identification document.\n\nEncryption remains restricted. Article 64 of the Telecommunication Regulation Law outlaws the use of any encryption equipment by telecommunications companies, their employees, or their customers without written consent from the NTRA and security agencies. In a November 2018 report, freedom-of-expression group Article 19 criticized Article 72 of Law No. 180 for granting the SCMR exclusive control over the establishment of encrypted platforms and requiring government approval for any other usage of such platforms.\n\nC5 1.00-6.00 pts0-6 pts\n\nDoes state surveillance of internet activities infringe on users’ right to privacy? 1.001 6.006\n\nSurveillance is a significant concern for internet users in Egypt. Article 57 of the constitution states that private communications may be monitored or confiscated by judicial order. In practice, surveillance operations lack transparency, potentially violating the constitution’s privacy protections. Additionally, Article 95 of the criminal code provides legal authority to law enforcement agencies to request the disclosure of communications data.\n\nEgypt’s cybercrime law (see C2) provides national security agencies access to the electronic data of internet and communication platform users without judicial oversight or clear regulation. Additionally, it does not include any substantial means to mitigate privacy violations or any compensation for those affected by these violations.\n\nA provision of the antiterrorism law allows the police to monitor internet traffic and social media activity to “prevent their use for terrorist purposes.” A committee established by the NTRA tracks communications over VoIP services (see A3). The 2018 cybercrime law also facilitates surveillance by state authorities (see C6).\n\nEgyptian authorities have access to spyware technology. In December 2021, Citizen Lab, a Canadian internet watchdog, reported that while living in exile, both opposition politician Ayman Nour and a well-known Egyptian journalist who wishes to remain anonymous were targeted by Cytrox’s Predator Spyware. According to Citizen Lab, there is medium-high confidence that the hack was done by the Egyptian government, which is a confirmed Cytrox Predator customer.\n\nIn November 2021, investigative website Disclose reported that French companies Nexa Technologies, Ercom-Suneris, and Dassault Systèmes supplied the Egyptian government with a cyber surveillance system that was deployed to monitor the electronic devices of human rights organizations and activists.\n\nOther reported instances of government-linked spyware use in recent years have included the use of Sandvine devices to block websites and monitor, prevent, or tamper with connections; FinSpy attacks against human rights activists; and the use of other sophisticated spyware that enabled attackers to read emails, log contacts, and record locations of citizens (see C8).\n\nAs early as 2013, Egyptian authorities were reported to be using software that allows service providers to monitor the behaviors of internet users as well as a wide range of communications, including voice calls, text messages, emails, instant messages, social media platforms, and search engines.\n\nAt times, police and plainclothes security agents have searched and seized mobile devices. During the September 2019 protests, people were asked to unlock their mobile phones and provide access to their social media accounts, which were checked for any expression of antigovernment sentiment. These actions were reported to be legal, as the public prosecutor had issued an order to inspect the social media accounts of allegedly illegal protesters. In January 2022, police officers near Tahrir Square stopped Imad Al-Sayed Ali Radwan to search his mobile phone. Radwan was arrested because of his antigovernment social media posts and convicted of promoting a terrorist group on social media. He was released the following month.\n\nIn 2019, the Public Prosecution established the Communication, Guidance and Social Media Department (CGSMD), which has a Monitoring and Analysis Unit (MAU) dedicated to monitoring social media users. The MAU has filed several lawsuits against social media users, such as Haneen Hossam, for committing vague crimes related to threatening “national security” and the “values of the Egyptian family” (see C3).\n\nC6 1.00-6.00 pts0-6 pts\n\nDoes monitoring and collection of user data by service providers and other technology companies infringe on users’ right to privacy? 0.000 6.006\n\nThe government can obtain user information from companies without due process. Article 64 of the Telecommunication Regulation Law allows service providers, as well as their marketing agents, to collect personal data from users. It also compels providers to give security agencies access to their “equipment, systems, software, and communication.”\n\nAccording to Privacy International, the 2018 cybercrime law requires telecommunications providers to assist law enforcement with surveillance operations. The law also compels providers to collect personal data and store them for 180 days. Failure to retain data for this amount of time could result in a fine of up to 10 million Egyptian pounds ($634,000); a second violation can lead to a fine of 20 million pounds ($1.3 million) and revocation of the company’s license. State agencies can request stored data without a judicial order, an apparent violation of Article 57 of the constitution. Vodafone International does not include Egypt in its transparency report and refrains from disclosing information about its assistance to local Egyptian authorities since, “the disclosure of national security-related material and other matters related to law enforcement” are legally prohibited in Egypt.\n\nA data protection law approved by the parliament in June 2019 and ratified by the president in July 2020 is the first legal safeguard for individual data privacy, and contains some data protection principles. However, the law stipulated that service providers should retain users’ data for 180 days and provide access to state authorities upon request. Furthermore, it exempts national security authorities from user-data protection obligations. It also does not include guarantees to the independence of the Personal Data Protection Center, which will be the regulatory authority. In March 2021, there was a stakeholder discussion on the application of the law.\n\nIn May 2018, the parliament passed a law to regulate ride-sharing apps, which includes requiring companies retain user data for 180 days and share it with authorities “on request” and “according to the law.” Requests for data do not need to be accompanied by a warrant, though a decree from the prime minister is required. In January 2019, following the law’s ratification in June 2018, negotiations between Uber and the government on implementing regulations were reportedly suspended due to controversy over whether the legislation can require user data to be stored in Egypt and whether security agencies can access it.\n\nC7 1.00-5.00 pts0-5 pts\n\nAre individuals subject to extralegal intimidation or physical violence by state authorities or any other actor in relation to their online activities? 1.001 5.005\n\nImprisoned activists, bloggers, and journalists frequently experience abuse and torture while in detention. Enforced disappearances and kidnappings of online activists and journalists are not uncommon.\n\nDuring the coverage period, at least two people were forcibly disappeared by security forces, reportedly due to their social media content. In January 2022, Constitution Party member (El-Dostour) Haitham el-Banna was arrested and disappeared. According to his family, his forced disappearance was related to a Facebook post that commemorated the anniversary of the 2011 revolution. In February 2022, he appeared before the SSSP, after which he was imprisoned for 15 days and convicted of joining a terrorist group, spreading false news, and misusing social media platforms. Similarly, in January 2022, Ihab Saeed Ahmed Saafan, an accountant, was forcibly disappeared for around three weeks. Saafan, who was accused of “joining and financing a terrorist group” and “spreading false news,” reported being beaten and subjected to electric shocks while security forces interrogated him about his Facebook and Twitter posts.\n\nTorture in prisons is not uncommon. In February 2020, Patrick George Zaki was detained and held for 24 hours by Egyptian authorities and was subjected to torture, including with electric shocks, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). Zaki, a researcher and activist, was accused of “calling for protests without permission” and for “spreading false news and inciting violence and terrorism” after posting to his Facebook page. His Facebook posts were the focal point of his interrogation.\n\nAccording to HRW, the LGBT+ community has been targeted by security forces on social networking sites and dating apps. In March 2019, a transgender woman was arrested and accused of involvement with a terrorist group and using social media to disrupt public order. She reportedly suffered sexual harassment and a forced anal examination while in custody (see C3). In July 2020, a Facebook user was harassed on the platform for being perceived as gay and was later harassed and assaulted offline. The user had posted a TikTok video in front of a rainbow flag, which was uploaded on Facebook without his permission. After receiving intimidating messages and a death threat, he temporarily closed his account (see B4). A recent study has found that prosecutions and imprisonment of LGBT+ people have increased due to the intensification of digital surveillance and the use of search and seizures of mobile devices by police (see C5). Online harassment and doxxing of LGBT+ people is also common.\n\nIn November 2019, after Mada Masr published an article on Sisi’s eldest son, who had been sidelined from his government position, nine plainclothes security officers raided the outlet’s office. They confiscated laptops and phones and took three staff members for interrogation; all three individuals were later released. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson noted that the Mada Masr raid had been conducted legally, and that the outlet did not have the required license to operate. He further denied detaining any staff and claimed that security agents did nothing beyond inspection, interrogation, and investigation.\n\nIn July 2020, an anonymous Instagram account that published testimonies about alleged sexual assaults became the target of online harassment and intimidation. The threats began after the account posted about “the Fairmont incident,” a high-profile rape case in which several men from “wealthy, powerful, and well-connected families” were accused of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman. The account was later hacked, and the witnesses’ private information was leaked on social media and progovernment websites in a reportedly state-sanctioned disinformation campaign meant to discredit them (see C8).\n\nC8 1.00-3.00 pts0-3 pts\n\nAre websites, governmental and private entities, service providers, or individual users subject to widespread hacking and other forms of cyberattack? 1.001 3.003\n\nInternet users in Egypt have been subject to several internal and external cyberattacks in recent years.\n\nPrivate companies and individuals were targeted with malware during the coverage period. In early 2022, reports emerged that thousands of Egyptian internet users had been infected with RedLine Stealer malware. The malware is used to steal passwords, credit card information, and other sensitive data.\n\nThe country was struck by several cyberattacks that used ransomware and affected companies worldwide in 2017. In addition, a 2018 Citizen Lab report found that Telecom Egypt had been redirecting Egyptian internet users to malware that mines cryptocurrency or displays advertisements, apparently to generate revenue using Sandvine equipment.\n\nIn March 2019, Amnesty International reported “OAuth” phishing attacks using third-party applications against journalists and human rights activists that were most probably conducted by or on behalf of the Egyptian authorities and linked to the NilePhish attacker group.\n\nIn October 2019, Check Point published a report revealing that 33 Egyptian citizens—including journalists, politicians, activists, and lawyers—were targeted through spyware that allowed attackers to read emails, log contacts, and record locations through downloaded mobile-phone apps. Some of the apps include Secure Mail, iLoud200%, and IndexY. Check Point suggested that such operations were linked to the Egyptian government given the groups that were targeted, the government’s investment of human and financial resources, the structures and data downloaded, the use of a registered server belonging to the MCIT, and geographic coordinates corresponding to GIS headquarters.\n\nIn July 2020, an Instagram account containing statements regarding the Fairmont incident was hacked by an unknown party (see C7).\n\nIn April 2022, following an online antigovernment campaign (see B8), authorities placed the country on “high cyber security alert.” While it is unclear if any cyberattacks occurred, a government source noted that authorities debated hacking the online accounts of users who shared the petition."
