        "text": "Renowned Egyptian actor Hisham Selim, 64 years old, passed away on Thursday, after a long battle against cancer over the past year.\n\nSelim, who was the son of the late football legend and businessman Saleh Selim, was born on January 27, 1958, and was among the most recognised actors of his generation.\n\nHis first debut on film was with late iconic actress Faten Hamama in the 1972 movie, \"Embratoreyet Meem\" (Empire M).\n\nSelim played several other prominent roles in cinema, theatre and TV, including films directed by late award-winning director Youssef Chahine such as \"Awdat El-Ebn Al-Dal\" (The Return of the Prodigal Son) in 1976 and \"Eskendria Kaman wa Kaman\" (Alexandria Again and Forever) in 1989.\n\nAround two years ago, Selim revealed during a popular TV show on \"Al-Qahera Wal Nas\" TV channel that his son Nour, formerly known as Noura, is transgender.\n\n\"My daughter Noura is now my son Nourâ€¦ This is what God wanted... I was not confused or surprised, because from the day she was born I could see her as a boy,\" he told filmmaker Enas El-Degheedy who hosted the show.\n\n\"As his father, I have to help him to be able to live the life that he wants,\" Selim added.\n\nThe announcement sent shockwaves across conservative Egypt, particular since it was a famed Egyptian father who openly support his transgender child, which until then was virtually unheard of, much less broadcasted on television.\n\nOn the other hand, activists and most members of Selim's artistic community hailed Selim's and his son's courage.\n\nSelim is survived by his wife, Nadia El-Ghaleb, two daughters and a son, Nour, from his first wife, Mervat El-Nahas."
