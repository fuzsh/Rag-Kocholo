        "text": "Resident Perspective: Salah Salem\n\nResident Perspective is a series of standardized interviews with Cairo residents to get their views on the city and their neighborhoods. Share your views on Cairo, fill the survey by clicking here.\n\nWhere in Cairo do you live?\n\nObour Buildings, Salah Salem Street. Belongs to Heliopolis district.\n\nList the most positive and the most negative aspects of living there.\n\nPositive: a garden between every two buildings, good cleaning services (trash, sweeping floors), good transportation (buses, and 2 new metro stations are now nearby “Stadium & Book Fair”), garage for every building, safe, has a nearby long avenue for walking, running, cycling, etc.\n\nNegative: Loud traffic, not enough services (almost all of them are shopping stores), hard to form close neighbors because of the many companies and mostly-elder population, no nearby hospital or clinic.\n\nHow do you move around Cairo (modes of transport) and what would you like to see different regarding the future of transport in the city?\n\nOrdered by frequency: - Walking - Metro (after the new metro extension for the third line) - Public buses - Microbuses (unofficial buses)\n\nHow does your district fit within Cairo? What would you like to see changed in that relationship between your neighborhood and the city?\n\nConnected through transportation but isolated because it doesn’t provide services to Cairo. Maybe shopping stores and that’s it. So no need to really come over except if you work in an office here.\n\nWhat are your top complaints about Cairo and what would you suggest to solve those problems?\n\n1- Traffic: I think we should stop encouraging owning cars by all the projects focused on them like expanding crossovers or widening streets by removing sidewalks. Instead we need to make it even harder for people to get to their destination so they know that this is not a city designed for cars, this is designed for humans. We need wider sidewalks, bike lanes in main avenues, more metro lines and public transportation and less solutions for how to make car the center of the city. Also startups related to traffic like bey2ollak, wasalny, and others concerned with Cairo should team up to offer a reliable and safe carpooling service.\n\n2- Losing Heritage: We need smarter solutions to saving our heritage. Stop bearing poor people because they live close to a monument, and start embrace them and teach them to use the monument to boost their business.\n\n3- Harassment This is becoming ridiculous. There’s no point of making a street better if I don’t feel safe walking in it. We pick streets and roads based on safety first then anything else. So harassment is making Cairo a lot smaller for us because many streets are not a choice.\n\nWhat do you like the most about Cairo and what are your favorite places in the city.\n\n1- Many historical places: You almost have a monument for every major historical event that happened in Egypt here in Cairo.\n\n2- variety in services and unofficial markets.\n\nDo you relate to the historic heritage of your district or of Cairo in general? Do you think you have a good sense of history of the city? Would you say you are have “civic pride” or are proud to live in Cairo?\n\nYes I do, please note that most people taking this survey will have a sense of responsibility toward the city to fill it. So don’t count on the percentage of “yes” you get from that survey as a representative of what citizens of Cairo really think.\n\nDo you understand how the city is governed/managed? Do you think your community/district would be better or worst if residents from the community/district were involved in local government (محليات)?\n\nNo I don’t, I have no idea who is responsible for what and I have a hard time finding answers.\n\nIn the context of Cairo, what comes to mind when you think of these keywords?\n\nPublic Space: No where.\n\nGreen Space/Parks: only ticket gardens, no gardens integrated with the streets.\n\nGated communities: Many, even if there’s no actual gate. and that’s in both expensive districts (new cities) and poor alleys where they consider those alleys part of their private homes.\n\nMuseums: Egyptian Museum needs more labels on the monuments, no affordable guidebooks for Egyptians to buy and not enough security inside, monuments are kept in bad displays and can easily be sabotaged, cleaning staff are irresponsible. The Islamic Museum is always closed, the same with Agricultural Museum. The Coptic Museum is the best kept museum, nice displays, nice lighting, everything is labeled, the tour makes sense and organized chronologically, good staff. Abdeen Palace is good but security is strict and sometimes forbid access to rooms that are supposed to be among the tours. I wasn’t allowed to take photos of the palace from outside.\n\nUnplanned districts: I think they should be embraced instead of being treated as ticking bombs.\n\nDowntown: Been there only once, don’t feel safe going there because of Tahrir square tension.\n\nIf you could move to another district in Cairo where would you move to?\n\nI have no idea. The problem is that nice districts to live in don’t have enough services and maybe that’s the reason they’re still nice."
