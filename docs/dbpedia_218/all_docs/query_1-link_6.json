        "text": "Social media users in Egypt have reacted with pride as Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah became the first Egyptian footballer to be named the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year.\n\nHe is only the second African footballer to win the award, after Leicester City's Algerian midfielder Riyad Mahrez in 2016.\n\nSalah, 25, has scored a 31 Premier League goals this season this season (equalling the 38-game-season record held by Luis Suarez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Alan Shearer) with three league games still remaining.\n\nSalah is a national icon in Egypt. Last year, the footballer's 95th-minute penalty against Congo secured a 2-1 victory which saw the Egyptian national team qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1990.\n\nStreets have been named in his honour, as well as a school in the city of Basyoun, while in January the footballer was received by Egypt's president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\n\nPresident al-Sisi was first elected president in May 2014, close to a year after he removed his elected predecessor, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, in a coup. The Muslim Brotherhood is now banned in Egypt.\n\nBut political groups on both sides were among those to offer their congratulations. Pro-state figures and Muslim Brotherhood supporters alike were quick to signal their support.\n\nHaytham Abokhalil, a pro-Muslim Brotherhood human rights activist, said, external Salah's award \"gives confidence to our youth that it can be the best if it has the appropriate possibilities and opportunities\".\n\nTo those sharing images of Salah's meeting with the Egyptian president, he said: \"whoever publishes photos of Sisi with captain Salah are a minority who wish to remain in the sick ward\".\n\nSeveral official state bodies have issued statements congratulating Salah. A foreign ministry spokesman said that Salah was \"a source of national pride and happiness,\" and \"a true inspiration to the youth of Egypt and Africa\".\n\nYou might also like:"
