        "text": "Cinema played a central role in the creation of modern Arab identity in the decolonization period. The “golden age” of Arab cinema is widely considered to be the period when Pan-Arabism as a political ideology was at its height from the 1940s to the 1960s and today’s cinema is often judged unfavorably against films of that era. In subsequent decades, the Arab defeat in the war with Israel in 1967, the passing of the Nasser era, the decline of secular Arab Nationalism, the impact of a globalized economy, the rise of Islamist politics, and the wave of Arab uprisings since 2011 have all influenced developments in the Arab film industry and television production. The growing conservatism of Arab audiences has also made directors, actors, and state censors throughout the Arab World today acutely aware of the limits of what they can present to the general public and even to the elite festival circuit. Translating the cinematic language of Arab films for a global audience remains a major issue for the main movie industries that now exist in the Arab World (Egypt, Lebanon, and Morocco), since films that win praise abroad often get mixed reactions or a negative response at home. Since the mid-1990s, the satellite television revolution has contributed to the decline of Arab cinematic production in terms of international recognition by offering an outlet that bypasses some of the obstacles of state censorship and film distribution companies. These same privately owned satellite channels have created a space for non-governmental voices representing competing religious and political factions and have given rise to a host of new genres, including news broadcasts aimed at a pan-Arab (rather than national) audience, music videos, reality TV, and talk shows that deal openly with sensitive social and political issues that have long been banned from state-owned broadcasting systems."
