        "text": "DUBAI: What is it like to be an artist in a changing Saudi Arabia? Saudi director Mansour Assad will tell you: it’s often harder than it looks. It’s been five years since the Kingdom kickstarted its film industry, and in that time, it’s built a landscape with seemingly limitless potential for aspiring filmmakers, complete with a passionate local audience eager to see new homegrown content. What’s the challenge, then? Pleasing everyone; something few have found the ability to do.\n\nAssad’s feature debut, “Slave,” explores this problem with a wicked satirical bent. In it, a young married couple create a short film of themselves as they argue in the kitchen, which goes viral overnight, garnering merciless feedback that quickly morphs into a life-changing scandal. The husband, Sakkir, finds himself in the interrogation room of a detective who offers him a way out — a magic marble that, if swallowed, will send him 48 hours into the past, allowing him to remake his film and quiet his many critics. With each attempt, he fails even more spectacularly than the last.\n\n“When I called this movie ‘Slave,’ what I meant was that this is a slave to society,” Assad explains to Arab News. “The point I’m exploring is that society will never change if we don’t have the courage to change ourselves — and be honest with ourselves.\n\n“It seems in the social-media era, influencers and content creators give people what they want and forget themselves,” he continues. “Even in the world of movies, it often feels like we can’t make a real story because society is not ready to see that there are sad people in our world. Some people aren’t ready to hear that some of us have real problems — and that was so triggering to me I had to make a film about it.”\n\nHaving picked up the Golden Palm for Best Film at the 2023 Saudi Film Festival in May, “Slave” has finally opened in cinemas across the Kingdom. As exciting as that milestone is for a young filmmaker, Assad also braced himself, knowing full well he was opening himself up to the same criticisms that inspired the film — criticisms he saw in the comment sections of so many YouTube sketches produced in the Kingdom over the last decade that affected the trajectory of many of his peers. To his delight, the film has been met with near-universal praise.\n\n“I’ve gotten so much positive feedback since it released. It seems there’s a lot of people angry about the situations that the movie explores. Every day, I’m getting someone thanking me for making it — someone who wants to speak about their own experience. And people also seem to think I’m a good artist myself, which is really pushing me forward,” says Assad.\n\nOddly enough, Assad never intended for “Slave” to be his debut feature. The 27-year-old thought it would be his third short film after 2019’s “Soul: Rooh” and 2021’s “Acceptance Land.” He started filming without any financing in place — without even sketching out a budget — but as he shot it, the project continued to grow in scope.\n\n“I started by sacrificing some of my bitcoins. I raised about SR40,000 ($10,664) from that so I could start filming what I thought would be a 30-minute short. Honestly, this was no great loss, because crypto crashed a week later and they lost basically as much value as I’d sold them for,” Assad says with a laugh. “But as I went, I realized there was more story to tell. So we started going around meeting with to financiers and showing them what we’d produced, and that was how we raised the money to turn it into a feature film.”\n\n“Slave” is not Assad’s first venture into the world of science fiction and fantasy. “Acceptance Land” explored similar themes. That film was set in 2096 after Earth had been ravaged by World War III and a person’s place in society is marked by the color of their clothes.\n\nWhile his interest in the genre may come from his childhood obsession with director Christopher Nolan and Hideo Kojima, creator of the “Metal Gear Solid” video game series, the ideas behind his films are personal.\n\n“I do have one theme across my movies so far,” he says. “It’s freedom. Each of these films is exploring the idea of humanity, and worlds in which people are not allowed to live as they want, to be who they are. But I’m trying to change that now. In my next films, I’m ready to explore new ground.”\n\nThat new ground that Assad is ready for is already right in front of him. He’s currently finishing the script for a new film called “AlUla’s Eagle,” inspired by his country’s unexplored recent history.\n\n“Maybe 40 years ago, there was a group of men who believed that the heads of the ancient eagle statues in the area were ‘haram’ (forbidden), so they started systematically crushing the heads of those statues. My story will follow one of those men,” says Assad.\n\nHe’s hugely excited by the story, as well as the potential it has as his first properly budgeted feature to propel him to the next level. But as excited as he is to be true to himself in his art, following the lessons that he’s set for his own characters, he’s also focused on how to succeed in the current landscape.\n\n“I think here in Saudi Arabia, we’ve really figured out how to tell a good story. We’re producing so many unique ideas all the time, and we’ve started to find success and win awards at festivals. The next phase is really not just about making a good movie, but figuring out how to communicate it,” Assad says. “It’s not enough to win something at a festival if you can’t get people to see it. The exciting thing is that everyone I talk to — whether that’s other filmmakers or people in the government — really understands this. We need to put our focus on how to get the word out, or else all we’re producing will disappear as quickly as it’s released.”\n\nHe's also conscious of his wish to avoid getting trapped in a similar feedback loop to his characters in “Slave,” while also getting better at discerning which comments are actually worth reading. There will always be critics in the digital world, he’s accepted, the trick is knowing how to harness them.\n\n“I think making art for broader society can be a very dangerous sport if you don’t realize how to control it. It’s great to have your own vision, but if you don’t figure out how to operate in a society, you will fail too,” Assad says. “What I’m doing now is learning what to take from this feedback loop that’s valuable, make stories that are more straightforward and can generate a bigger conversation. That’s what my heroes have done, and since I was a kid I’ve told myself that I will be like them, too.”\n\nRIYADH: When Saudi film director and producer Aymen Khoja started his own company, AK Pictures, two years ago, most of his pitches were rejected by investors. Half-jokingly, he told his business partner that he wished he was a foreigner. “If my hair was blond and my eyes were blue, they would’ve accepted at least five of these projects,” he tells Arab News that he said. “And then I looked at him, like, ‘Oh. This could be an idea.’”\n\nIt was. And now that idea has become “Il Signore,” Khoja’s latest film as director, currently showing in cinemas across the GCC.\n\n“Il Signore” is, Khoja says, “a light comedy” about a Saudi architect called Salem, who has been working hard to earn a promotion. But on the day he comes to the office expecting to be told that he has been successful in his endeavours, he learns that he is being fired instead, because a Westerner working in the company “put in a word” that Salem wasn’t needed anymore.\n\nSalem searches for a new senior-level job, but most of the positions he applies for are taken by expats. Desperate, Salem decides to adopt a fake identity — an Italian called Paolo.\n\n“That’s the fun journey you’ll see in the first 20 or 30 minutes of the film, until he becomes the Italian guy,” says Khoja. “And then his life changes. He gets the Porsche, he gets the high salary, and he gets the lifestyle that he wanted to have as a Saudi. But he doesn’t have it as a Saudi, he has it as an Italian. And then he faces this identity problem. And he has to decide if he can confess to his family or not.\n\n“It’s so different from any other Saudi film,” Khoja continues. “It’s timely. I think it’s very important to discuss these challenges. I don’t want to call this a problem; it’s a challenge that we see around us. We’re not saying Westerners or experts coming from outside, are not adding value. No. They are adding value. At the same time, we’re saying Saudis deserve a chance. And how can we find the right balance between learning from the people coming from outside with experience, and also giving an opportunity to the locals?”\n\nThe film has “nothing to do with politics,” Khoja is quick to stress. “It’s purely comedy. When we made this film, we thought of three things: We wanted to entertain people, we wanted to touch people, and we wanted to fulfill people. We never thought about politics. We’re discussing this issue from a comedic point of view. And the takeaway is just that I think there are some locals that deserve a chance.”\n\nFinding an actor who could portray Salem/Paolo was also a challenge, Khoja says. “The reason why I picked Yasir (Alsaggaf) to act this role is I needed an actor that, when people look at him, they believe that he’s Italian, but they also believe he’s Saudi. That was really hard, but that’s why we cast Yasir.”\n\n“Il Signore” also features Egyptian A-lister Bayoumi Fouad as Paolo’s boss. “The great thing about Bayoumi is, he can play the comedic and the serious at the same time, so you never know, like, ‘Is he serious? Is he joking?’ We needed someone like him to play this part. And you can see that chemistry between Yasir and Bayoumi. It’s there.”\n\nKhoja practiced what he’s preaching in terms of giving Saudis a chance when he was putting his crew together. He estimates it was a roughly even split between Saudis and non-Saudis. “We had people from Tunisia, from Egypt, the UAE. We did the United Arab nation,” he says with a laugh. “But I would say more than 50 percent were Saudi.”\n\nClearly, he’s keen to support Saudi’s blossoming film industry. But he’s also eager to ensure that it is approached as a business, with the need to turn a profit.\n\n“Il Signore,” Khoja says, is a “high-quality, very low” budget film shot over just 18 days, following two months of preparation.\n\n“If you make movies that cost, say, two or three million dollars, how are you going to bring profits from the box office?” he says. “The risk is so high. You don’t need a lot of money. It’s about the stories, the characters… it’s about the idea. Honestly, I asked for this (low) budget specifically. We did this to help stabilize the market. This is a statement, because if we keep spending money to make films that don’t make money, then this industry will not survive. The support of the government isn’t going to last forever. We need the private sector to understand how to make movies within a budget that actually brings in profits so we can build a sustainable industry. That’s the goal. We could have pitched this film for three million dollars, but we chose this budget because now we only need around 50,000 admissions to break even. And our projection is about 250,000 admissions.\n\n“You know, we care about what we do. And we care about building a sustainable industry. It’s such a great industry. You can impact people’s lives,” he continues. “That’s why I love movies. People might be sad, they watch a film, they’re happy, you know? And that’s why I believe in what I’m doing. I like making films because it changes people.”\n\nUltimately, Khoja wants to see not just his own movies flourishing, but the entire Saudi film industry.\n\n“I want to make movies that travel to the 400 million people that live in the Arab world. And I want to help other filmmakers (do that too),” he says. “I want Saudi films to fly.”\n\nDUBAI: Mukkram Kazim, head chef at French fine-dining restaurant L’ami Dave in Mansard Riyadh, began his career aged 18 in the UK, where he studied culinary arts and gained experience in fine dining. Kazim worked in prestigious restaurants in London before taking on “a significant role” with a luxury cruise line under famed US chef Thomas Keller.\n\nThat job took him across Europe, America, Asia and Australia, broadening his culinary perspective.\n\nKazim then opened his own restaurant, Gusto Italian, in England before taking the lead in the kitchen at L’ami Dave.\n\nHere, Kazim discusses common mistakes, his favorite dish to cook, and his management style.\n\nWhen you started out what was the most common mistake you made?\n\nA mistake many chefs make early in their career is not properly tasting and seasoning dishes as they cook. It’s easy to assume that a dish will turn out well without frequent adjustments, but flavors can change during cooking. Regular tasting and adjustments are crucial for a balanced final dish.\n\nWhat’s your top tip for amateur chefs?\n\nFocus on mastering basic techniques. Understanding how to properly handle knifes, cook vegetables and manage heat can make a huge difference. Once you’re comfortable with the basics, experimenting with flavor and ingredients becomes much easier and more enjoyable.\n\nWhat ingredient can instantly improve any dish?\n\nA high-quality sea salt. It enhances the natural flavors of ingredients and can make a noticeable difference in taste. Just a pinch can elevate the overall dish.\n\nWhen you go out to eat, do you find yourself critiquing the food? What’s the most-common mistake that you find in other restaurants?\n\nYes, as a chef, I think it’s natural to critique food when dining out. One common mistake I notice is inconsistency. Sometimes dishes can be under seasoned or unevenly seasoned, which affects the overall flavor.\n\nWhat’s your favorite cuisine?\n\nI usually go for Arabic or Indian cuisine, especially dishes featuring rice and meat. I enjoy the depth of flavors and the complexity of spices that these cuisines offer. Dishes like biryani or kabsa are particularly appealing because they combine aromatic spices with tender meat and flavorful rice, making for a satisfying and rich meal.\n\nWhat’s your go-to dish if you have to cook something quickly at home?\n\nA simple pasta aglio e olio. Just pasta, garlic, olive oil and a pinch of red pepper flakes. It’s flavorful and satisfying, and can be made in about 20 minutes with minimal effort. Plus, it’s a great way to use up staples and can be easily customized with extra ingredients.\n\nWhat customer behavior most annoys you?\n\nWhen they ask for excessive or frequent changes to a dish after it’s been ordered. Accommodating special requests is part of the job, but constant adjustments can complicate the preparation process and impact the timing and quality of the meal. Clear communication about preferences and limitations means a smoother dining experience for everyone.\n\nWhat’s your favorite dish to cook?\n\nMutton curry with spinach. I love it — the combination of tender lamb and vibrant spinach, infused with aromatic spices. The process of blending spices and achieving the perfect balance of flavors is incredibly satisfying, and the result is a dish that’s both comforting and impressive.\n\nWhat’s the most difficult dish for you to get right?\n\nOne of the most challenging to perfect is soufflé. It requires precise timing, temperature control, and the right technique to achieve the perfect rise and texture. Even slight deviations can lead to a deflated or uneven soufflé, making it a true test of a chef’s skill and attention to detail.\n\nAs a head chef, what are you like?\n\nI strive to strike a balance between being authoritative and approachable. I believe in leading with respect and setting high standards, while ensuring that every aspect of the kitchen runs smoothly. My approach involves clear communication and a commitment to quality.\n\nChef Mukkram’s lobster thermidor and pommes Anna recipe\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n1 whole lobster (including tails and claws); 120g thermidor sauce (instructions below); 30g unsalted butter; 180g of pommes Anna (instructions below); 2g microgreens\n\nFor the thermidor sauce (yield = 2.4kg)\n\nINGREDIENTS: 150g butter; 100g flour; 900ml milk; 1l cream; 200g shallots; 150g leeks; 15g garlic; 200ml American malt; 750ml shrimp stock (instructions below); 180g gruyere cheese; 25g dijon mustard; 40g Maldon salt\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nCombine 125g of butter with the flour and mix until evenly distributed.

And it’s a lot more needed. We did not have this privilege to express ourselves 10 years ago. There was no platform. Now? The sky’s the limit. They’ve got our back. Do you know how proud this makes me?”\n\nHere, we select some highlights from Tamer’s conversation on the show.\n\nOn going viral recently:\n\nWe were shooting the album teaser and we were playing this song called “Baba Fein” (a viral hit in the early 2000s). And I just made a little TikTok video from this thing, just showing what I’d done with the sample, basically. And it just blew up. This has never happened to me before. Never had a moment like that. And look, it’s cringe, and everybody’s like, “Oh my god, TikTok ruined the song” or whatever. But for an artist, if you have a song go viral on TikTok it is the greatest marketing tool that you could dream of. So, needless to say, I’m excited.\n\nOn insecurity:\n\nI’ve been making music since I was nine. And I’ve been showing my music to people since I was 17 — starting with the little clip of “Can’t Love Myself.” But I’ve battled with a lot of insecurity. I’m an introvert, so I think I was just scared. If you’d asked me two years ago, I’d have been, like, “Don’t show anyone any of this! I don’t want my music to leave this laptop.” I was frightened. But I’m not afraid anymore. Because I feel like it’s selfish if I do that. Like, the music helped me a lot. I made it for myself. I was going through a really tough time and it got me through it. Today, I understand that I’m in a position where I have an opportunity to really make a difference and really help push the envelope. Do what I can to be just a little part of this wave that’s happening already. With or without me, it’s gonna happen.\n\nOn how home is changing:\n\nI can tell you something I haven’t said in any (interview) before. I was born and raised here. I grew up in Jeddah. But when I was a kid, I didn’t want to live here when I was a grown up. And that broke my heart because I love this country. Now? There is no other place I’d rather be. What I’m trying to say is, for anybody who felt like how I felt when you were a kid, please understand that home is changing. Or if you used to live in Saudi and now you’re living outside, please understand that home is changing. I tell this to people who used to live here when they were kids — a lot of them are not even Saudi, a lot of them are Lebanese — and I show them, like, “Look what it’s like now!” Home is changing. People need to be more excited about this. It’s a beautiful thing. It’s an historical thing.\n\nOn Saudi Arabia’s arts and culture scene:\n\nWhen I came back home after being in the US for five years, I got the opportunity to work with (Saudi artist) Ahmed Mater, to do the (artwork) for the song “Wallahi.” And looking into that world of Saudi art, it was, like, “This is a goldmine!” And the best part is, it’s not just for the Arab world; it’s universal. Number one, this shows the importance of art. And number two, it’s coming out of one of the most unlikely places. The force that it is right now reminds me of when you’re in the shower and you hold a bar of soap, you know? The harder you try to squeeze it, that moment it gets its freedom, the further it will fly. This is exactly what’s happening in Saudi Arabia today. We’re ready. We want to go. And we’re not going to stop until the job is done. And the job will be done, it’s only a matter of time. For 40 years, this country had artists in the closet. And the beauty that we find! My God! We have a lot to offer. It’s alien to the outside world. And right now, in an age where so much saturation exists, the world needs something new, and I honestly believe that the modern Khaleeji youth is it. And it’s only a matter of time until people know — until it’s shown to the masses. All it really (takes) is exposure. Because, my God, do we have the art.\n\nkeywords\n\nDUBAI: The Saudi entrepreneur, founder of both haircare line SNDR and SNDR.Co — a brand specializing in wigs, extensions, and lashes — discusses style moments, fashion trends, and good and bad advice.\n\nBest TV show/film you’ve ever seen?\n\nMy favorite movie is “A Walk to Remember.” I am a hopeless romantic and the love story between Landon and Jamie is incredibly touching and beautifully portrayed. The way their relationship transforms them both and the heartwarming yet bittersweet ending make it a truly unforgettable film. It is perfect for anyone who believes in the power of love and the impact it can have on our lives.\n\nWorst TV show/film you’ve ever seen?\n\nOne of the worst TV shows I’ve ever seen is “The Bachelor.” While some people find it entertaining, I think it can be overly dramatic and often feels staged. The premise of finding love in such a competitive and artificial environment. It seems unrealistic to me. It lacks genuine connections and meaningful interactions, which is what makes other romance shows or movies enjoyable.\n\nBest personal style moment so far?\n\nOne of my best personal style moments so far was attending the Hai Vogue Fashion Experience in Jeddah. I wore a stunning, Saudi designer masterpiece that perfectly blended traditional Saudi elegance with modern fashion trends. The intricate detailing and flattering silhouette made me feel both confident and glamorous. It was a memorable moment because it allowed me to showcase my unique style and celebrate Saudi culture on an international platform.\n\nWorst personal style moment?\n\nI honestly do not think I have a worst personal style moment. I believe that every fashion choice I have made has been a learning experience and a part of my journey in developing my unique style. Even if some looks weren’t perfect, they’ve all contributed to my growth and understanding of fashion.\n\nBest accessory for a little black dress?\n\nThe best accessory for a little black dress is a statement necklace. It adds a touch of elegance and sophistication, instantly elevating the simplicity of the dress. A bold, eye-catching necklace can make the outfit stand out and draw attention to your face, creating a perfect balance between classic and chic.\n\nWorst accessory for a little black dress?\n\nThe beauty of a little black dress lies in its versatility. You can pair it with literally any accessory—from bold statement pieces to subtle, elegant touches, and it will always look fabulous. That is the magic of the little black dress: it effortlessly adapts to your style!\n\nBest fashion trend of 2024?\n\nOne of the best fashion trends of 2024 is the comeback of timeless classic pieces and 90’s style. I love how these trends bring a sense of nostalgia while remaining effortlessly chic and versatile. Timeless classics like tailored blazers and simple silhouettes provide a foundation for any wardrobe, while the 90’s inspired looks, such as slip dresses and high-waisted jeans, add a fun and retro vibe. It is a perfect blend of elegance and playful nostalgia that allows for endless styling possibilities.\n\nWorst fashion trend of 2024?\n\nI am not a fan of the resurgence of ultra-low-rise jeans. While they had their moment in the early 2000s, they can be quite uncomfortable and challenging to style in a way that feels flattering and modern. They often do not suit many body types and can limit the versatility of outfits. High-waisted jeans offer a much more flattering and practical alternative, which is why I prefer them over the low-rise trend.\n\nBest advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nThe best advice I’ve ever been given is to always stay true to myself and my values. In the world of fashion and social media, it is easy to get caught up in trends and what others expect of you. However, remaining authentic and grounded in who I am has been crucial to my success and happiness. This advice has helped me navigate my career with confidence and integrity, making choices that align with my true self.\n\nWorst advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nI honestly do not remember the worst advice I’ve ever been given. I tend to focus on the positive and the lessons learned, so any bad advice has just been a stepping stone to better decisions and growth.\n\nBest book you’ve ever read?\n\nThe best book I’ve ever read is “The Power of Now” by Eckhart Tolle. It’s an incredibly insightful book about living in the present moment and understanding the power of our subconscious mind. The way it explains the concept of mindfulness and how our thoughts shape our reality is truly transformative. It is a powerful read that has deeply influenced my perspective on life and the power of attraction.\n\nWorst book you’ve ever read?\n\nI do not think I have come across a book that I would consider the worst. Every book I have read has offered some value, whether it’s through new ideas, different perspectives, or simply the pleasure of reading. Even if a book is not my favorite, I believe there is always something to learn from it.\n\nBest thing to do when you’re feeling low?\n\nThe best thing to do when I am feeling low is to spend quality time with my family. Their love and support always lift my spirits and remind me of what's truly important. Whether it is playing with my kids, having a heartfelt conversation, or simply enjoying a meal together, being around my loved ones helps me feel grounded and recharged.\n\nWorst thing to do when you’re feeling good?\n\nThe worst thing to do when you are feeling good is to overcommit or take on too much at once. It is easy to get carried away with enthusiasm and agree to numerous tasks or projects, but this can lead to burnout and stress. It is important to enjoy the positive feelings without overwhelming yourself, maintaining a balance to sustain your well-being and happiness.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nThe best holiday destination really depends on the season. Europe in the summer is perfect because the countrysides are beautiful, the weather is amazing and the kids enjoy it. Plus, I love the rich culture and stunning scenery and do not mind the endless possibilities for content creation!\n\nIn the winter, Bali or the Maldives are ideal choices for me because I don’t like to be cold! It has beautiful warm weather, gorgeous beaches and a perfect escape from the winter chill.\n\nWorst holiday destination?\n\nFor me, a destination that’s overly crowded or lacks natural beauty might not be as enjoyable. It’s important to choose a holiday spot that matches your interests and provides the relaxation or adventure you’re looking for.\n\nBest subject at school?\n\nMy favorite subject in school was literature. I loved poetry and diving into different stories, exploring various writing styles, and discussing the themes and characters. It sparked my imagination and helped me develop a deeper appreciation for storytelling, which has been invaluable in my career as a content creator and influencer.\n\nWorst subject at school?\n\nThe worst subject for me in school was probably math. While I understand its importance, I found it challenging and less engaging compared to other subjects. The abstract concepts and complex problem-solving did not come as naturally to me, and I often struggled to stay interested. However, I still appreciate the skills it taught me in logical thinking and discipline.\n\nBest thing to do to ensure you have a productive day?\n\nThe best thing to do to ensure you have a productive day is to start with a clear plan and set specific goals. Creating a to-do list and prioritizing tasks helps you stay focused and organized. Waking up early is also crucial, as it gives you a head start and more time to accomplish your goals. Also, starting the day with a healthy routine, such as a good breakfast and some exercise, can boost your energy and mindset, setting a positive tone for the rest of the day. This approach helps me maximize efficiency and ensures that I accomplish important tasks.\n\nWorst thing to do when you’re trying to have a productive day?\n\nThe worst thing to do when you’re trying to have a productive day is to start by checking social media or other distractions.

The performances were top-notch and the atmosphere was unforgettable. It truly set a high standard for any future concerts I might attend.\n\nWorst concert you’ve ever been to?\n\nI haven’t been to any others.\n\nkeywords"
