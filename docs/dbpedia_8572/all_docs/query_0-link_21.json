One day the owner attempts to molest Kukoi. In self-defence, Kokoi hits the owner with an iron rod killing him on the spot. Kukoi is produced before court and then sent to state juvenile home where he is traumatized. Biswa Boro, the warden of the home, is an understanding man. He coaxes the boy into a confession of the true circumstances of the painful event. Kukoi is brought before the magistrate who orders his release and custody to his parents or any authorised guardian. Biswa goes to Kukoi’s village where he discovers that the boy’s mother died years ago and his stepfather has disowned him. Biswa, who is now retired and does not have children, decides to adopt Kukoi.",
