The resulting film adaptations that have theatre-like qualities often fail completely due to their inability to capture the attention of contemporary audience members, essentially creating a stagnant film. In this paper, I am specifically narrowing my focus and discussing tragedy film adaptations in comparison to themselves and theatre. But first, I will give an overall briefing of the history of film and theatre. Then I will discuss their relationship and what elements create successful entertainment within films and how theatre-like adaptations have a crippling effect to a film’s success rate. Finally I will have an in-depth discussion on these elements within the films: Waiting for Godot, Hamlet, and Moulin Rouge!, and the success rate of each.\n\nDuring the 19th century, theater adopted a realistic viewpoint by romanticism but also a rise in modern nationalism to give people a sense of belonging in a community or culture (Carlson 2014: 21). In the 20th century, realism in theater was challenged and plays were now easier to attend due to the improvements of communication and the ability to reach other areas of the world by travel (Carlson 2014: 23-24). Theater is another addition to the world of art that is continuously evolving and adapting to the world and cultures influencing its\n\nThe beginnings of theatre go back far I history. It started by acting out of religious rites portrayed by sings and dances to their gods. It’s believed to be started by the Greeks. “ The very words theatre, drama, tragedy and comedy are Greek in origin”(Brown 13). England has been the center of theatricals for many generations. There are many actors from England that have achieved success in America. England’s plays have been preformed on American stages.

Painting, sculpting, music, and, above everything, theatre. Even before they could speak properly , primitives use dance and small rituals as a way of enterteinment. However, now, in the higly technology developed world we live, every day there are more various and modern options to do in our free time but, at the same time all changes and becomes dull too fast.This puts theatre in a really fragile position and makes us wonder if it will become out-of-style or if, on the contrary, as this essay will proof, it will still be relevant and up to date for the next generations.\n\nIn today's busy world, people usually struggle to find time for fun and a way of relaxation but when it happens, they often spend it on entertainment. One of those forms of entertainment is watching stage or film productions. Theatre and film have lots of aspects in common and depend on each other, however, they involve differences.

The purpose of this essay is to compare and contrast between those two forms of art.\n\nThe lights begin to dim until you can barely see what is around you. The smell of butter is in the air as you recline your seat back till you are nearly vertical with the floor. Then a bright light shines in front of you, so massive it is impossible to miss. It is finally starting. The movie is finally starting. There is a significant reason why people occasionally go to the movie theatre to watch a movie rather than just watch the movie at home.

Have you ever had a bad experience at the movie theatre though? One where your shoes begin to squeak because you step in someone's spilt slushy or as you sit in your chair you hear the crunch of the previous person’s left over popcorn underneath you. Not only does this situation make you frustrated and irritated, it also distracts you from the movie you went to the theatre to see. If you have a bad time at the movie theatre, you may not even remember the movie you went to see because you are distracted by all the things around you. In this case, going to the movie theatre actually takes away from the movie itself.

But Ghashiram Kotwal, being a combination of classical, folk, and modern form, the sutradhar stays on the play from beginning to the end. Tendulkar’s brilliant fusion of Bharata’s Lokdharmi and Natyadharmi makes this play one of a kind. It is one such play where the Sutradhar can comment or even directly talk to the audience, or stand by silently as a spectator. The role of the Sutradhar is played by Haridasa in the play. He is an actor and a commentator. The Sutradhar comments on the incidents rhythmically. And it is followed with the last rhyming words by the Brahmin line. The play is truly an innovative experiment that offers a new direction to modern Indian Theatre due to Tendulkar’s\n\nIndian theatre is one of the longest and amplest theatres in the world; it dated back to around 5000 years, as the other theatres in over the world Indian theatre emerged in the seasonal celebration and religious ritual.
