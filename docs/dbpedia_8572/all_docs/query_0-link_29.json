        "text": "This article is about the Brahmins of Assam Valley, India. For the other related article that especially focuses on Assamese Brahmins in Lower-Assam (Kamrup), see Kamrupi Brahmins.\n\nBrahmins of Assam\n\nঅসমীয়া ব্ৰাহ্মণ\n\nAssamese Brahmins (Assamese: অসমীয়া ব্ৰাহ্মণ, Hindi: असमिया ब्राह्मण) constitute the Indo-Aryan community of the Assam Valley who belong to the Vedic Brahmin caste. Brahmins are found everywhere in Assam and surrounding areas however, most predominantly in Jorhat, Nalbari, Barpeta, Goalpara and Darrang districts. Assamese Brahmins have a significant diaspora, mainly in West Bengal, and are considered to be at the apex of eastern India's caste hierarchy. Common Assamese Brahmin surnames are Acharjee/Acharya, Barua/Baruah, Bhattacharjee/Bhattacharya, Gain/Gayen, Goswami/Ghoshwami, Thakur/Borthakur, Sharma/Sarma, etc.\n\nDescription[]\n\nBrahmins of Assam Valley belong to the group of Indo-Aryans, who are believed to be having their origins as far as West Bengal to Kannauj.[1] There is a myth that the Ahoms brought the Brahmins to Assam for worshiping goddess Kamakhya but the fact is that Brahmins were present in Assam much earlier to the advent Ahoms and hence also known as Kamrupi Brahmins.During the reign of Koch Kings the Kamrupi Brahmins were quite prosperous. In fact one of the earliest king of the Ahom Dynasty is known as Bamuni konwar as because he was brought up by a Brahmin family and till that time the Ahom kings were not Hindu and as such there is no question of Ahoms inviting Brahmins to Assam. Although Brahmins in Assam are same as per their faith and customs with that of any other Brahmin community across India but they are Saakta or worshiper of Shakti and are non vegetarian. Certain regional beliefs and customs may exist which may be distinct to the Brahmins in the state. Unlike Brahmins in other parts of India, they may eat non-vegetarian food which includes mostly Fish, Pigeon, Duck, Chicken, Mutton and Eggs. Each Brahmin family within the community belongs to a specific Gotra (Brahmin identity surname) which is unique to a family thereby indicating their origin or the Lineage. Many of the Brahmins in Assam write the conferred titles either given to them as a gift by the Ahom kings or else which they have adopted being in Assam for a long time.\n\nA. Surnames[]\n\n1. Barua, Baruah, Barooah, Baroova, Borooah or other spellings of the same surname.\n\nUnder this there may exist middle names/titles/prefixes that give the distinction of being Brahmins.

Besides these, Baruahs, Rajkhowas and Phukans are equally present among Ahoms (non-Indo-Aryan community) and Kalita, though it is not common to see \"Baruah\" to be spelled as \"Barooah\" by Ahoms.
