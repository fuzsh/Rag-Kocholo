        "text": "Most of your films are realistic.Where do you pick your characters from?\n\nI make films so that I can myself learn from them besides sending a social message across. The characters for my plots are a part of the society. My journeys on Mumbai's BEST buses, my visits to the villages in Assam give me sufficient scope to learn about society and its people. Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara, for instance, took me five years of research. During this period I made a voyage into the world of schizophrenics through books as well as by visiting people suffering from schizophrenia. And it was indeed surprising that most of the psychological problems are found among slum-dwellers. Merely sweeping the dirt in slums is not enough, the abstract aspects also have to be taken into consideration.\n\nWomen play the protagonists in most of your films. Be it\n\nApeksha\n\nyour first Hindi film or\n\nFiringoti\n\n(\n\nThe Spark\n\n) which made Moloya Goswami the first Assamese actress to win a National Film Award.\n\nMy mother, late Gunawati Barua is a central force behind my choosing women as protagonists. She was an institution in herself and I respected her a lot. Their intelligence and strength to take on life's hardships cannot be emulated by men. My female protagonists are therefore women of strength who try to overcome odds and are decisive. The school teacher Ritu, the teacher in\n\nFiringoti\n\n(\n\nThe Spark\n\n), for instance, is not deterred by the acts of anti-social elements in re-building the burnt school house of a village.\n\nWhat have been your efforts in bringing quality cinema to common masses?\n\nIt is not a filmmaker's job alone to bring quality films to masses. Nevertheless, I have always been directing my efforts towards creating a system wherein people get to watch good movies. But as usual, the ephemeral nature of our government sometimes leave some policies inefficacious. The efforts continue albeit. I can only hope.\n\nFrom Apeksha to Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara. How has your odyssey been?\n\nWell, the path was strewn with roses and thorns alike. In fact, I had faced many difficulties during the making of Apeksha. Those were enough to deter any film maker from taking up his next venture. The thought was depressing and I considered myself unfortunate, given that it was my maiden Hindi film. But in retrospect, I feel going through those bad times has helped me emerge stronger. I consider myself lucky for having gone through those testing times. This makes Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maara a successful attempt.\n\nWhat do you look for in the actors and actresses?\n\nIntelligence. An indepth understanding of the role, besides its projection on the screen needs cannot be everyone's pie. Urmila's intelligence counted for my choosing her in Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Maaran and she handled her role with equal deft as Anupam Kher - the protagonist.\n\nRegional films despite their richness in content fail to enthuse audiences.\n\nAs I have already said, we need a system that can guide audiences towards watching quality films. We need to create similar platforms as Sangeet Natak Akademy, Sahitya Akademy to bring regional films into the limelight."
