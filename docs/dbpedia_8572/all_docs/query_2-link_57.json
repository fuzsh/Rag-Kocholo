        "text": "It was the month of October in the year 2016 when on a very short notice, I had to proceed to Guwahati from Itanagar on an official tour on a sunny afternoon. My colleague, DK Sarma, who hails from Guwahati, was incidentally proceeding on leave and was generous enough to offer me a ride in his little grey Maruti car, which he said, was more than 20 years old. We took the route from Itanagar via Holongi, which cuts short the travel time to Guwahati by about an hour compared to the route via Banderdewa.\n\nThe landscape from Itanagar to Holongi check post is simply picturesque: a beautiful curvy double lane road laid through the hills with mesmerising “kohua bon” (scientific name – Saccharum spontaneum) growing on either side of it. The ubiquitous ‘kohua bon’ reminded me of a number of Assamese songs – the nostalgic ‘Juri moloya, kun dekholoi batori, Aei matitey kohua bonot…’ – by Madhumati Goswami, ‘Kohua bon mur akhanto mon…’ by the late Dr Bhupen Hazarika. I wondered how a wild vegetation crept into numerous songs and literary works in the country. An Adi song of Arunachal Pradesh also mentions the wild grass in ‘Pinko pimung aralo, kabgo ringo dung ngo…’, meaning amidst the kohua bon, I wander about weeping. It also reminded me of the novel “Pather Panchali” by Bibhuti Bhusan Bannerji and the famous train scene in the movie version of the novel by Satyajit Ray, where Appu and Durga run through a field of ‘kohua bon’ to see a train. It is said that the maestro of filmmaking, had to wait for the next season to complete the train scene as the ‘kouha bon’ which was being filmed, had been feasted upon by a herd of cattle after the first shoot.\n\nAfter we crossed Holongi check post, we had to navigate through herds of cattle refusing adamantly to listen to the honk of Sarma’s car. Sarma wonderfully overtook many brand new expensive cars on the way – thanks to his driving skills. In Sonitpur district, when we had to drive through arrays of potholes, I had my maiden feeling of the need to wear a helmet while travelling in a four-wheeler. Nevertheless, Sarma continued to press on the accelerator with a cryptic smile on his face. On many segments where the road is good, speed breakers are laid without any obvious necessity or visible warning. Running over speed breakers twice at full speed, l realised that “life Insurance“ is definitely a prerequisite to be a passenger in Sarma’s little car.\n\nA Mukesh song reverberated in my mind: ‘Suhana safar aur ye mausam haseen, hamein darr hai hum kho na jayein kahin’ – in the literal sense Ha… Ha…!"
