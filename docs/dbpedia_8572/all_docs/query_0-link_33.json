        "text": "To celebrate India’s 70 years of Independence, my pick of seventy films from my viewing list ….\n\nAGNISNAAN (Bhabendranath Saikia, Assamese, 1985)\n\nDr. Bhaben Saikia is credited to have introduced the parallel cinema movement in Assam. He made eight National award winning films besides being a prolific writer. I have just seen two of his films viz., SAROTHI & the above mentioned film, both of which left a big imprint on me. Why I like the film? Based on his own story, this is an unusual & powerful revenge saga of a dedicated wife (played by the brilliant Moloya Goswami) when her businessman husband takes in a new young wife in his life. The director however contends that it was her physical need that drove her towards infidelity.\n\nANAND (Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Hindi, 1971)\n\nWhether the inspiration came from Kurasawa’s IKIRU or modeled on the personality/friendship with Raj Kapoor, Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s ANAND is his finest film. Why I like the film? Great acting by the two leading actors, memorable dialogues & evergreen songs ….\n\nAKALER SANDHANE (Mrinal Sen, Bengali, 1980)\n\nThis is a memorable film on the discovery of the actual reality in rural India by a film unit and its director when they try to recreate/make a film on famines. Why I like the film? Films about films tend to be boring apart from exception like Truffaut’s DAY FOR NIGHT. This film by MS succeed in mirroring social realities and raising many relevant questions – in order to portray reality, weren’t the film unit responsible for making life harder for the poor villagers because of soaring prices and other forms of degradation when the urban film crew descend on the rural countryside?…\n\n4. PATHER PANCHALI (Satyajit Ray, Bengali, 1955)\n\nThe film that brought International acclaim to Indian cinema. It often figures in the critic’s list of ten best films in World Cinema.\n\n5. KHOSLA KA GHOSLA (Dibakar Bannerjee, Hindi, 2006)\n\nIn his debut film, Dibakar Bannerjee chooses a contemporary topic, that of land mafias exploiting innocent home and land buyers to the hilt. KKG deals with the predicament of an honest elderly man (Anupam Kher) when he buys a plot of land from a property dealer and gets duped in the process. The narrative unfolds the two sons’ (Prabin Dabas & Ranvir Shorey) effort at revenge/retrieval of the lost money (given away in the initial transaction by their father) with the assistance of a few others.\n\nWhy I like the film? The director captures the life and eccentricities of the characters from the Capital city effectively. The humor laced treatment of a serious subject makes the film enjoyable, and doesn’t allow it to become boring at any point.\n\n6. SHABDO (2012, Bengali) The tale of a foley artist – a sound technician for movies, their neglect and the blurring of lines between devotion to duty and personal injury\n\n7. PARTY (1984, Hindi)\n\nNihalani established himself as a distinguished filmmaker early in his career with films like ‘Akrosh’ and ‘Ardh Satya.’ But speaking personally, I find his third film PARTY to be more stylistically orchestrated, brimming with social commentaryand successful in exposing the dubiousness of the rich and the famous from the Cultural fraternity.\n\nUnder the guise of celebrating a recent honor bestowed on one Dr. Barve (Manohar Singh) a party is thrown by one of the female friends (Vijaya Mehta) of the feted writer. Several people arrive in this party and gradually their personal lives get unfolded before the viewer. Wannabe writers, actors from the theatre, social climbers and social activists & gate crashers mingle freely in the midst of free-flowing snacks and drinks. The discussions ranges from whether Political commitment contribute towards a writer’s greatness or the atrocities committed by the State on tribals in the name of development, and the fate that befalls those who speak as voice for the marginalized. In this respect one does find similarity of Gobind Nihalani with filmmakers like Mrinal Sen and Gautam Ghose who seek to address such topical issues in their works. Fine ensemble acting by Amrish Puri, Om Puri, Shafi Inamdar, K. K. Raina, Rohini Hattangady, Deepa Sahi, Pearl Padamsee, Mohan Bhandari, Soni Radzan & Jayant Kripalani add to the strength of the film.\n\n8. PAAR (1984, Hindi)\n\nPAAR is a tale of arduous struggle for survival. It narrates the story of a harijan couple (Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi) who flee from their native village in Bihar to escape from the wrath of the upper caste tyrannical landlord (Utpal Dutt) & his men. The landlord’s brother (Mohan Agashe) was killed to avenge the death of the Gandhian school teacher (played by Anil Chaterjee) who worked tirelessly for upliftment of the oppressed villagers.\n\nThe initial part of the film, especially the character of the school teacher, invokes the spirit of the Gandhi-Ambedkarite struggle of dalit upliftment. The second half of the film portrays the hardship the couple faces in the city of Kolkata romantically bestowed with an epithet – The City of Joy. The couple finds no such joy in the city but an odd job to drive a herd of pigs across a river with a lure for earning money to finance their travel back home.\n\nExquisitely filmed, backed by terrific performances, this is one of the greatest films ever in Indian cinema. Om puri does a cameo as a village sarpanch.\n\n9. AJANTRIK (Bengali, 1958)\n\n(to be Continued …)"
