He received the maximum BFJA Awards for Best Actor (Hindi) – four times[3] and nominated 25 times. He was awarded the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. Khanna is referred to as the \"First Superstar\" of Hindi cinema.[4][5][6][7] He made his debut in 1966 with Aakhri Khat and rose to prominence with his performances in films like Raaz, Baharon Ke Sapne, Ittefaq and Aradhana'\n\nEarly life\n\nKhanna was born in Amritsar on 29 December 1942. He was adopted and raised by foster parents who were relatives of his biological parents. Khanna lived in Thakurdwar near Girgaon. Khanna attended St. Sebastian’s Goan High School in Girgaum, along with his friend Ravi Kapoor, who later took the stage name Jeetendra. Their mothers were friends.[8] Khanna gradually started taking interest in theatre and did a lot of stage and theater plays in his school[9] and college days and won many prizes in the inter college drama competitions.[10] Khanna became a rare newcomer who struggled in his own MG sports car to get work in theatre and films in the early sixties.[11] Both friends later studied in Kishinchand Chellaram College(KC).[12] When Jeetendra went for his first film audition, it was Khanna who tutored him. Khanna's uncle changed Khanna's first name to Rajesh when Khanna decided to join films. His friends and his wife call him Kaka.[13]\n\n[edit]Adult life\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Khanna fell in love with the then fashion designer and actress Anju Mahendru.[14] They were in the relationship for seven years. Mahendru states that the couple did not speak to each other for 17 years after the breakup.[15] Later Khanna married Dimple Kapadia in March 1973, six months before Dimple's debut film Bobby released[16] and has two daughters from the marriage.[17] Khanna and Dimple Kapadia separated in 1984 as his schedule kept him away much of the time and Dimple became interested in pursuing an acting career,[18] and thereafter lived separately, but did not complete the divorce proceedings.[19] In the eighties Tina Munim was romantically involved with Khanna till the time she decided to leave the industry to pursue her higher studies.[20] Years of separation brought about mutual understanding between Rajesh Khanna and Dimple Kapadia.[15] Reporter Dinesh Raheja stated that “the bitterness between Rajesh and Dimple washed away\", noting that they are seen together at parties and that Dimple campaigned for Khanna's election and also worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar.[21] Their elder daughter Twinkle Khanna, an interior decorator and a former film actress, is married to actor Akshay Kumar[22] while their younger daughter Rinke Khanna, also a former Hindi film actress,[23] is married to a London-based investment banker Samir Saran.[24]\n\n[edit]Early career (1966–1975)\n\nRajesh Khanna was one of eight finalists in the 1965 All India Talent Contest organised by United Producers and Filmfare from more than ten thousand contestants.[25] Subsequently Khanna won the contest.[26] He made his film debut in the 1966 film Aakhri Khat directed by Chetan Anand, followed by Raaz directed by Ravindra Dave both of which were a part of his predetermined prize for winning the All-India United Producers’ Talent Competition.[27] G.P. Sippy and Nasir Hussain were the first to sign Rajesh Khanna after he won the contest.[28] Aakhri Khat was India’s entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 40th Oscar Academy Awards in 1967.[29] Khanna in an interview to Hindu newspaper said,\"Though “Aakhri Khat” is my first film, I received my first break as a leading actor in Ravindra Dave's, “Raaz” in 1967. My heroine was Babita, already a popular actress then. Though I had lots of confidence, I was shy in facing the camera initially. In my first three shots, I had to perform with stress on my body language and dialogue delivery. Though I was right with my dialogues, my movements were not up to the mark. Ravindra Dave explained me my scenes and movements very clearly correcting my way of walking\".[30] Being under contract with United Producers, he got projects like Aurat, Doli and Ittefaq.[31] He was then noticed for his performances in films like Baharon Ke Sapne, Aurat (1967), Doli, Aradhana and Ittefaq. Later Waheeda Rehman suggested Asit Sen to take Khanna for the lead role in Khamoshi.[32] Through Aradhana he rose to \"instant national fame\" and film critics referred to him as the first superstar of India.[33][34] In that film, Rajesh Khanna was cast in a double role (father and son) opposite Sharmila Tagore and Farida Jalal. The film also saw the resurgence of Kishore Kumar, who eventually became the official playback voice of Rajesh Khanna. The Kishore Kumar-Rajesh Khanna combination worked miracles and it was almost impossible to see them as separate identities. They became a singer-actor duo and together they gave many songs till 1991.[35] Then in year 1971, Haathi Mere Saathi became the biggest hit and also became the biggest grosser ever till then. Khanna is also credited with giving Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar their first chance to become screenplay writers by offering them work in Haathi Mere Saathi.[36] Javed Akhthar accepted in an interview \"One day, he went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow Aashirwad. But the film's script was far from being satisfactory. He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit.\"[37]\n\nRajesh acted alongside Mumtaz in eight successful films.[38] They were neighbours and got along very well, and as a result they shared a great on-screen chemistry. After Khanna married, Mumtaz decided to marry millionaire Mayur Madhwani in 1974. At the time, she was doing three films Aap ki Kasam, Roti and Prem Kahani with Khanna. She decided to quit movies only after completing these films. When she left films Khanna felt very lost. In one of her interviews, Mumtaz was quoted saying \"I would pull his leg and tease him about his fan following. Whenever Rajesh entered a hotel in Madras, there was a queue of 600 girls waiting to see him at midnight. As a result, even I would get some importance, as people would ask for my autograph as well. He was very generous with his associates, and would party a lot.\"\n\nDuring the peak of his career he would be mobbed during public appearances. Fans kissed his car, which would be covered with lipstick marks, and lined the road, cheering and chanting his name. Female fans sent him letters written in their blood.[39] There used to be a line of cars of his producers and hysterical fans outside his bungalow every day. Actor Mehmood parodied him in Bombay to Goa where the driver and conductor of the bus were called 'Rajesh' and 'Khanna'. Even today, he remains the favourite of mimicry artists, who copy his trademark style and dialogue delivery. During the filming of Amar Prem there was a scene that needed to be filmed at Howrah Bridge with a boat carrying Khanna with Sharmila moving under the bridge. The authorities ruled this scene out as they realized that if the public found out that the hero of the film would be there, it may create problems on the bridge itself, and that it might collapse due to the amount of people trying to get a glimpse of their favourite actor.[40] Film critic Monojit Lahiri remembers “Girls married themselves to photographs of Rajesh Khanna, cutting their fingers and applying the blood as sindoor. Rajesh was God, there has never been such hysteria.”[41]\n\nSeveral songs sung by Kishore Kumar in the 1970s were based on Rajesh Khanna. During the filming of the song 'Mere Sapnon Ki Rani' in Aradhana, Sharmila Tagore was shooting for a Satyajit Ray film and director Shakti Samanta had to shoot their scenes separately and then join the scenes together.In the seventies, his chemistry with Sharmila Tagore, Mumtaz, Asha Parekh, Zeenat Aman and Hema Malini were also popular with audiences.[42]\n\nThe BBC made a film on him, titled Bombay Superstar, in 1974, the shooting for which began the same time when he got married and his film Daag premiered.[43] In the video it can be noticed that Khanna was shooting for Aap Ki Kasam. A textbook prescribed by the Bombay University contained an essay, 'The Charisma of Rajesh Khanna!'.[44]\n\nSharmila Tagore said in interview to Indian Express, “Women came out in droves to see Kaka (Khanna). They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse, they would marry his photographs, they would pull at his clothes. Delhi girls were crazier for him than Mumbai girls. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen anything like this before and since.”[45]\n\nMusic remained one of the biggest attractions of all Rajesh Khanna films throughout his career. Many of the musical scores for Khanna's films were composed by Sachin Dev Burman, R.D. Burman and Laxmikant-Pyarelal. The trio of Rajesh Khanna, Kishore Kumar and R.D. Burman went on to make a number of popular films, including Kati Patang, Amar Prem, Shehzada, Apna Desh, Mere Jeevan Saathi, Aap Ki Kasam, Ajnabee, Namak Haraam, Maha Chor, Karm, Phir Wohi Raat, Aanchal, Kudrat, Ashanti, Agar Tum Na Hote, Awaaz, Hum Dono and Alag Alag.\n\nRajesh Khanna had 15 consecutive solo superhits between 1969 to 1971, which is still an unbroken record in Indian film history.[46] In calculation of the 15 films, 2 hero films like Maryada,Andaz and films with box office result as hits were excluded -Mere Jeevan Saathi, Choti Bahu and Shehzada.\n\nKhanna considered Guru Dutt, Meena Kumari and Geeta Bali as his idols.Khanna dislosed in an interview,\" My inspirations include, Dilip Kumar's dedication and intensity, Raj Kapoor's spontaneity, Dev Anand's style and Shammi Kapoor's rhythm.\"[30]\n\n[edit]1976–1978\n\nBetween 1976 and 1978, Khanna acted in 4 box office hits and in nine films that were not commercially successful. Seven of the unsuccessful films were critically acclaimed and have achieved strong cult status over the years among the viewers and these films included Mehbooba,[47] Bundal Baaz, Tyaag, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Naukri, Chakravyuha and Janata Havaldar which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, Meeraj, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and Mehmood Ali, respectively. Khanna persuaded Samanta to cast his sister-in-law Simple Kapadia opposite him in Anurodh.[48] Films starring Rajesh Khanna and directed by Shakti Samanta tended to be commercially successful, but Mehbooba was an exception.[49][50] The change from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers caused the decline of Khanna's career in terms of box office ratings to some extent. The declaration of emergency in India had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption becoming successes. Actor Joy Mukherjee made Chhailla Babu, a suspense thriller in 1977, which became the only successful film of his as a director[51] and the unexpected success of the Chhailla Babu gave a boost to the career of Khanna.[52] However, Khanna continued basically in solo hero social sober household meaningful films during this era and played a variety of characters in films of various genres. During this phase too he had box office hits like Maha Chor,[53] Chhailla Babu,[54] Anurodh and Karm.\n\n[edit]1979–1991\n\nAfter 1978, Khanna starred in critically acclaimed commercially successful films[55][56] such as Amardeep, Phir Wohi Raat, Bandish,[57] Thodisi Bewafaii, Dard, Kudrat, Dhanwan, Ashanti (1982 film), Avtaar, Agar Tum Na Hote, Souten, Jaanwar, Asha Jyoti, Awaaz,[58] Naya Kadam,[59] Hum Dono, Babu, Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar,[60] Shatru,[61] Insaaf Main Karoonga, Anokha Rishta, Nazrana, Angaarey, Adhikar (1986),Amrit, Awam (film) (from 1979–1991). Director Bharathiraja decided to remake his 1978 Tamil box office hit film \"Sigappu Rojakkal\" in Hindi with Khanna playing the role of a psychopath.[62] Kamal Haasan who played the same role in Tamil won South Filmfare Best Actor Award for his portrayal.[63] But the Hindi movie was seen as controversial by traditional and orthodox Hindi moviegoers and was not a commercial success, although Khanna's performance has been rated later higher by critics than the original.[64]\n\nTina Munim and Rajesh Khanna became the leading on and off screen couple of the 80’s with hits like Fiffty Fiffty, Suraag, Souten, Aakhir Kyun, Bewafai, Insaaf Main Karoonga and Adhikar(1986).[65] Ram Awatar Agnihotri wrote that Tina Munim showed the first sparks of the dedicated actress she would become in the films \"Alag Alag\" and \"Adhikar\", both with Khanna.[66] His on screen pair with Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil,Padmini Kolhapuri and Poonam Dhillon was also popular in the eighties[67]He also acted in the Marathi hit film \"Sundara Satarkar\" in 1981.[68] He has performed in the least number of multi-starrer films in comparison to his contemporaries and portrayed the central character in the few multistarrers he acted. Khanna delivered multi-starrer superhits like Rajput, Dharm Aur Qanoon,[69] Paapi Pet Ka Sawaal Hai, Zamana (1985), Dil-E-Nadan and Ghar Ka Chiraag. He did three potboiler movies with Jeetendra, which were blockbusters-Dharam Kanta,[70] Nishaan and Maqsad.[71] In the year 1984, his film Maqsad became the 2nd highest box office superhit film earning 8.5 crores.[72]Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar is one of the memorable political films of Rajesh Khanna. Khanna played the character of a corrupt politician in this film. Viewers praised his role in the film.[73] The year 1985 saw him turn a producer with Alag Alag. Eleven films, with Khanna in the lead, released in 1985 and eight of these became hits and in addition had two films with him in special appearance.[74] Before joining politics one of his last films as the lead hero was Swarg released in 1990. David Dhawan regards Swarg as his most favorite directorial venture and said in an interview \" Swarg did well. Though a serious film, people even today talk about it as it struck a chord. I was working with Rajesh Khanna for the first time. I shared a good rapport with him. He never threw tantrums on the sets.\"[75]\n\nHe experimented with films of different genres like tragedy in Babu as a rickshaw puller, thriller in Redrose as a psycopath, political adventure in Awam, negative roles in Dhanwan and Redrose, fantasy in Bundalbaaz and Jaanwar, crime in Phir Wohi Raat and Angarey, suspense in Chakravyuha and Iteefaq, comedy in Hum Dono and Masterji, action in Ashanti, family dramas like Aanchal and Amrit and Agar Tum Na Hote, variety of social films like Avtaar, Naya Kadam, Akhir Kyun and with different themes like reincarnation theme in Kudrat, patriotism in Prem Kahani, immature young love theme handled in different ways in films like Anokha Rishta, Nazrana and Dil E Nadan and did college romance in Bandish. He has played variety of characters as the lead hero – as a postman in Palkon Ki Chaon Mein, as a lawyer who proves that his senior has committed a rape 25 years earlier in Kudrat, as a politician in Aaj Ka MLA Ram Avtaar, as a young musician forced by fate to marry two women in Asha Jyoti, as professional advocate in Awaaz, fisherman in Prem Bandhan, a revolutionary patriot who is torn apart by love and policeman like in Prem Kahanai, as a righteous farmer in Bandhan etc.\n\nHe shared a close relationship with R.D. Burman[76] and Kishore Kumar. The trio were friends and have worked together in thirty two films.[77] Work of Pancham with Khanna is regarded as legendary and far superior than any other actor-music director combinations.[78] The king of playback singing Kishore Kumar had even credited Rajesh Khanna for his resurgence, so much so that he sang for Alag Alag, the first film produced by Rajesh Khanna without charging anything.[79][80] In 1985 Pancham found himself being sidelined after failure of few films but Rajesh Khanna was among the few who continued to stand by him.[81] Rajesh and Pancham worked together even after the death of Kishore in the films Jai Shiv Shankar, the unreleased film Police Ke Peechhe Police (both produced by Khanna ) and Sautela Bhai. Khanna even helped Leena Gangully and Amit Kumar in completing Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein, the last film directed by Kishore who died before the completion of the film.\n\nPyarelal quoted in an interview that “Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout “Wah! Wah!” in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Bewafai. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too.[38] He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then and did not want to work with him.\"[38] Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishoreda was very reluctant to sing \"Waada Tera Waada\" in Dushman and suggested Laxmikant Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishoreda meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishoreda that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.[38]\n\nActors who were part of the cast of most of his films include Ashok Kumar, Sujit Kumar, Prem Chopra, Madan Puri, Asrani, Bindu, Vijay Arora, Roopesh Kumar, Dina Pathak and A. K. Hangal, who remained part of his \" working team\" since the start until the late eighties. The lyricist whom he preferred for his movies was Anand Bakshi. Films by Shakti Samanta with Khanna in the lead, music by Pancham and lyrics by Anand Bakshi had people swooning over. The films Samanta directed without Khanna in the eighties were duds.[82][83] His other close friends from the film industry include Raj Babbar, J. Om Prakash and Jeetendra.\n\nCelebrities of the post-2000 era, like Madhur Bhandarkar, say that they take at least three or four turns in Carter Road even today only to see Khanna.[84] The younger generation stars like Imran Khan still regard Rajesh Khanna as someone who would take the top slot as the most romantic hero of all time.[85] Shahrukh Khan idolises Rajesh Khanna and has opined,\"Rajesh Khanna you can’t touch\".[86] Actor Tom Alter confessed “I still dream of being Rajesh Khanna. For me, in the early 1970s, he was the only hero – romantic to the core, not larger than life, so Indian and real – he was my hero; the reason I came into films and he still is.”[87] Actor Irrfan Khan accepted in an interview, \"The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality.\"[88] Rajesh Khanna was the last superstar to set fashion trends.[89] The trend of wearing guru kurtas and belt on shirts became famous in seventies and eighties because of Khanna.[90]\n\nKhanna was awarded Filmfare Special Award in 1991 for having starred in 101 films as the solo lead hero and just 21 two hero films in short span of 25 years. Khanna gave 35 Golden Jubilee Hits in period 1967-1975 and 3 in 1976-78 and 35 more in 1979-1991 and gave 22 Silver Jubilee Hits in period 1966-1991.By 2011, he held record for the Hindi actor with most number of author backed lead hero films - 106 solo hero films and having done only 22 two hero films.[91]\n\n[edit]Later career (1992-present)\n\nFrom the early nineties onwards he stopped acting and served as M.P. of New Delhi Constituency from 1991 to 1996. During that period, he returned to acting, playing the lead in Khudai(1994), which was about a father and son both falling in love for the same woman. After 1992, he appeared in only 10 films and declined most film offers. He made a comeback as a NRI in Aa Ab Laut Chalen(1999), and Kyaa Dil Ne Kahaa(2002) and played the solo lead in films Sautela Bhai in 1996, Pyar Zindagi Hai in 2001 and Wafaa in 2008.He did 4 television serials in period 2000-2009.\n\n[edit]Television\n\nHe is a life member of the International Film And Television Research Centre, the International Film And Television Club and the Asian Academy of Film & Television.[92] He is the Guest Faculty of 'Specialized Cinema Courses At Asian School Of Media Studies'. On 10 April 1999 Khanna inaugurated the live concert of S.P. Balasubramanyam held at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad as a tribute to Pancham.[93] In 2001 and 2002, Rajesh played the lead in two television serials: Aapne Parai (B4U & DD Metro)[94] and Ittefaq (Zee TV).[95] He performed in a video album based on Tagore's songs (Rabindra Sangeet) without payment.[96] He also endorsed Star se Superstar tak – a talent hunt programme in 2007 and donated a Gold Trophy of Rs.1 crore. In its Silver Jubilee Episode on 14–15 March 2008, K for Kishore aired a Rajesh Khanna special. He signed on to star in a TV serial with Creative Eye Banner (Dhiraj Kumar) in 2007, and in 2008 performed in a TV serial, Bhabhima, with Leena Ganguly as his co-star. His successful TV serial Raghukul Reet Sada Chali Aayi began in November 2008 and ended in September 2009.[97] Khanna cited the lack of good roles for actors like him in the films as the reason for him not appearing much in films after 2001. He said in an interview on being queried about his decision to do TV serials, \"The reach of TV is much more than cinema today and one episode of my serial is likely to be watched by more people than a super-hit film\".[98] In 2009, on his 67th birthday, Shemaroo Entertainment released his films and a song collection titled Screen Legends-Rajesh Khanna-the Original Superstar.[99] In May 2012, Havells, the fan making company endorsed Khanna as Brand Ambassador for their new ad campaign featuring him in solo advertisements.[100]\n\n[edit]Political and business career\n\nRajesh Khanna was a member of Parliament for the Congress Party, from the New Delhi constituency, where he won the 1992 by-election, retaining his seat until the 1996 election.[101] When Khanna was M.P he worked full time as a politician and did not accept new acting assignements.[102] He has since been a political activist for the Congress Party and campaigned for Congress in Punjab for 2012 elections.[103]\n\nKhanna and a group of foreign investors have bought land in Shirdi on which they plan to build a religious resort for disciples of Sai Baba of Shirdi.[104]\n\n[edit]Health\n\nIn June, 2012, it was reported that Rajesh Khanna's health had been deterorating for some time,[105] [106] On 23 June 2012 he was admitted to Lilavati Hospital due to some health complications. He was discharged on 8 July 2012 from the hospital and was reported to be fine.[107] [108][109][110] On 14th July 2012, Rajesh Khanna was readmitted in city's Lilavati hospital. He was admitted due to weakness and low blood pressure,\" Mr Khanna's estranged wife, Dimple Kapadia said. [11\n\nBollywood veteran Rajesh Khanna was at his dramatic best when he received the lifetime achievement trophy at the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards in Macau from his \"Anand\" co-star Amitabh Bachchan late on Saturday (June 13) night.\n\nKhanna, who featured in hits like \"Aradhana\", \"Kati Patang\" and \"Amar Prem\" in his four-decade long career, kept referring to Big B as \"babumoshai\", in the manner in which he addressed Bachchan in their 1971 heartwarming hit \"Anand\".\n\nIt took me 40 years and 180 films to get this IIFA Life time Achievement award-along journey I must say I am very grateful to IIFA, (event organisers) Wizcraft, committee members and babumoshai. Babumoshai, thank you very very much,\" Khanna said in his acceptance speech.\n\n“It is after 16 years later that we are together on a stage. I thank him from the bottom of my heart,\" he added.\n\nKhanna, 66, also belted dialogues from his famous films to entertain the audience. And he even appreciated Bachchan's successful journey in his professional life.\n\nLife should be big, not necessarily long, and my babumoshai is living life big - living life king size. (Look) from where to where he has reached in so many years. We started with ’Anand' and today we are on this platform. He is very dear to me, he is my babumoshai,\" he said.\n\nKhanna received a standing ovation from industry members as well as the audience.\n\nWhatever I am, I am because of you, my audience. My audience members, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian - everyone was responsible to make me an actor to a star to a superstar to what I am today. Thank you all,\" he said.\n\nwww.masala.com/12738-thank-you-babumoshai-rajesh-khanna-t...\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRajesh Khanna pronunciation (help·info); (born Jatin Khanna on 29 December 1942) is an Indian actor of Hindi films,[1] and has been Hindi film producer and an Indian politician.\n\nHe appeared in 163 films of which 106 had him as the solo lead hero and 22 were two hero projects.[2] He won three Filmfare Best Actor Awards and was nominated for the same fourteen times.

His friends and his wife call him Kaka.[12]\n\n[edit]Adult life\n\nSee also: Dimple Kapadia, Kishore Kumar, R.D.Burman, Jeetendra, and Simple Kapadia\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Khanna fell in love with the then fashion designer and actress Anju Mahendru.[13] They were in the relationship for seven years. Mahendru states that the couple did not speak to each other for 17 years after the breakup.[14] Later Khanna married Dimple Kapadia in 1973 and has two daughters from the marriage.[15] Khanna and Dimple Kapadia separated in 1984 as his schedule kept him away much of the time and Dimple became interested in pursuing an acting career,[16] and thereafter lived separately, but did not complete the divorce proceedings.[17] In the eighties Tina Munim was romantically involved with Khanna till the time she decided to leave the industry to pursue her higher studies.[18] Years of separation brought about mutual understanding between Rajesh Khanna and Dimple Kapadia.[14] Reporter Dinesh Raheja stated that “the bitterness between Rajesh and Dimple washed away\", noting that they are seen together at parties and that Dimple campaigned for Khanna's election and also worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar.[19] Their elder daughter Twinkle Khanna, an interior decorator and a former film actress, is married to actor Akshay Kumar[20] while their younger daughter Rinke Khanna, also a former Hindi film actress,[21] is married to a London-based investment banker Samir Saran.[22]\n\n[edit]Early career (1966–1975)\n\nRajesh Khanna was one of eight finalists in the 1965 All India Talent Contest organised by United Producers and Filmfare from more than ten thousand contestants.[23] Subsequently Khanna won the contest.[24] He made his film debut in the 1966 film Aakhri Khat directed by Chetan Anand, followed by Raaz directed by Ravindra Dave both of which were a part of his predetermined prize for winning the All-India United Producers’ Talent Competition.[25] G.P. Sippy and Nasir Hussain were the first to sign Rajesh Khanna after he won the contest.[26] Khanna in an interview to Hindu newspaper said,\"Though “Aakhri Khat” is my first film, I received my first break as a leading actor in Ravindra Dave's, “Raaz” in 1967. My heroine was Babita, already a popular actress then. Though I had lots of confidence, I was shy in facing the camera initially. In my first three shots, I had to perform with stress on my body language and dialogue delivery. Though I was right with my dialogues, my movements were not up to the mark. Ravindra Dave explained me my scenes and movements very clearly correcting my way of walking\".[27] Being under contract with United Producers, he got projects like Aurat, Doli and Ittefaq.[28] He was then noticed for his performances in films like Baharon Ke Sapne, Aurat (1967), Doli, Aradhana and Ittefaq. Later Waheeda Rehman suggested Asit Sen to take Khanna for the lead role in Khamoshi.[29] Through Aradhana he rose to \"instant national fame\" and film critics referred to him as the first superstar of India.[30][31] In that film, Rajesh Khanna was cast in a double role (father and son) opposite Sharmila Tagore and Farida Jalal. The film also saw the resurgence of Kishore Kumar, who eventually became the official playback voice of Rajesh Khanna. The Kishore Kumar-Rajesh Khanna combination worked miracles and it was almost impossible to see them as separate identities. They became a singer-actor duo and together they gave many songs till 1991.[32] Then in year 1971, Haathi Mere Saathi became the biggest hit and also became the biggest grosser ever till then.Khanna is also credited with giving Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar their first chance to become screenplay writers by offering them work in Haathi Mere Saathi.[33] Javed Akhthar accpeted in an interview \"One day, he went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow Aashirwad. But the film's script was far from being satisfactory. He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit.\"[34]\n\nRajesh acted alongside Mumtaz in eight successful films.[35] They were neighbours and got along very well, and as a result they shared a great on-screen chemistry. After Khanna married, Mumtaz decided to marry millionaire Mayur Madhwani in 1974. At the time, she was doing three films Aap ki Kasam, Roti and Prem Kahani with Khanna. She decided to quit movies only after completing these films. When she left films Khanna felt very lost. In one of her interviews, Mumtaz was quoted saying \"I would pull his leg and tease him about his fan following. Whenever Rajesh entered a hotel in Madras, there was a queue of 600 girls waiting to see him at midnight. As a result, even I would get some importance, as people would ask for my autograph as well. He was very generous with his associates, and would party a lot.\"\n\nDuring the peak of his career he would be mobbed during public appearances. Fans kissed his car, which would be covered with lipstick marks, and lined the road, cheering and chanting his name. Female fans sent him letters written in their blood.[36] There used to be a line of cars of his producers and hysterical fans outside his bungalow every day. Actor Mehmood parodied him in Bombay to Goa where the driver and conductor of the bus were called 'Rajesh' and 'Khanna'. Even today, he remains the favourite of mimicry artists, who copy his trademark style and dialogue delivery. During the filming of Amar Prem there was a scene that needed to be filmed at Howrah Bridge with a boat carrying Khanna with Sharmila moving under the bridge. The authorities ruled this scene out as they realized that if the public found out that the hero of the film would be there, it may create problems on the bridge itself, and that it might collapse due to the amount of people trying to get a glimpse of their favourite actor.[37] Film critic Monojit Lahiri remembers “Girls married themselves to photographs of Rajesh Khanna, cutting their fingers and applying the blood as sindoor. Rajesh was God, there has never been such hysteria.”[38]\n\nSeveral songs sung by Kishore Kumar in the 1970s were based on Rajesh Khanna. During the filming of the song 'Mere Sapnon Ki Rani' in Aradhana, Sharmila Tagore was shooting for a Satyajit Ray film and director Shakti Samanta had to shoot their scenes separately and then join the scenes together.\n\nThe BBC made a film on him, titled Bombay Superstar, in 1974, the shooting for which began the same time when he got married and his film Daag premiered.[39] In the video it can be noticed that Khanna was shooting for Aap Ki Kasam. A textbook prescribed by the Bombay University contained an essay, 'The Charisma of Rajesh Khanna!'.[40]\n\nSharmila Tagore said in interview to India Express, “Women came out in droves to see Kaka (Khanna). They would stand in queues outside the studios to catch a glimpse, they would marry his photographs, they would pull at his clothes. Delhi girls were crazier for him than Mumbai girls. He needed police protection when he was in public. I have never seen anything like this before and since.”[41]\n\nMusic remained one of the biggest attractions of all Rajesh Khanna films throughout his career. Many of the musical scores for Khanna's films were composed by Sachin Dev Burman, R.D. Burman and Laxmikant-Pyarelal. The trio of Rajesh Khanna, Kishore Kumar and R.D. Burman went on to make a number of popular films, including Kati Patang, Amar Prem, Shehzada, Apna Desh, Mere Jeevan Saathi, Aap Ki Kasam, Ajnabee, Namak Haraam, Maha Chor, Karm, Phir Wohi Raat, Aanchal, Kudrat, Ashanti, Agar Tum Na Hote, Awaaz, Hum Dono and Alag Alag.\n\nRajesh Khanna had 15 consecutive solo superhits between 1969 to 1972, which is still an unbroken record in Indian film history.[42] The commercial success of his films declined during 1976–78.In calculation of the 15 films, 2 hero films like Maryada,Andaz and films with box office result as hits were excluded -Mere Jeevan Saathi, Choti Bahu and Shehzada.\n\nKhanna considered Guru Dutt, Meena Kumari and Geeta Bali as his idols.Khanna dislosed in an interview,\" My inspirations include, Dilip Kumar's dedication and intensity, Raj Kapoor's spontaneity, Dev Anand's style and Shammi Kapoor's rhythm.\"[27]\n\n[edit]1976–1978\n\nBetween 1976 and 1978, Khanna acted in nine films that were not commercially successful. Seven of these were rated highly by critics upon their release and have achieved strong cult status over the years among the viewers and these films included Mehbooba,[43] Bundal Baaz, Tyaag, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Naukri, Chakravyuha and Janata Havaldar which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, Meeraj, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and Mehmood Ali, respectively. Khanna persuaded Samanta to cast his sister-in-law Simple Kapadia opposite him in Anurodh.[44] Films starring Rajesh Khanna and directed by Shakti Samanta tended to be commercially successful, but Mehbooba was an exception.[45][46] K. Balachander then remade his film Arangetram in Hindi as Aaina with Mumtaz in the lead and Khanna in a cameo appearance in 1977. This film was also unsuccessful. The change from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers caused the decline of Khanna's career in terms of box office ratings to some extent. The declaration of emergency in India had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption becoming success.[47] Actor Joy Mukherjee made Chhailla Babu, a suspense thriller in 1977, which became the only successful film of his as a director[48] and the unexpected success of the Chhailla Babu gave a boost to the career of Khanna.[49] However, Khanna continued basically in solo hero social sober household meaningful films during this era and played a variety of characters in films of various genres. During this phase too he had box office hits like Maha Chor,[50] Chhailla Babu,[51] Anurodh and Karm.\n\n[edit]Later career (1979–present)\n\nAfter 1978, Khanna starred in critically acclaimed commercially successful films[52][53] such as Amardeep, Phir Wohi Raat, Bandish,[54] Thodisi Bewafaii, Dard, Kudrat, Dhanwan, Avtaar, Agar Tum Na Hote, Souten, Jaanwar, Asha Jyoti, Awaaz,[55] Naya Kadam,[56] Hum Dono, Babu, Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar,[57] Shatru,[58] Insaaf Main Karoonga, Anokha Rishta, Nazrana, Angaarey, Adhikar (1986) and Amrit(from 1979–1991). Director Bharathiraja decided to remake his 1978 Tamil box office hit film \"Sigappu Rojakkal\" in Hindi with Khanna playing the role of a psychopath.[59] Kamal Haasan who played the same role in Tamil won South Filmfare Best Actor Award for his portrayal.[60] But the Hindi movie was seen as controversial by traditional and orthodox Hindi moviegoers and was not a commercial success, although Khanna's performance has been rated later higher by critics than the original.[61]\n\nTina Munim and Rajesh Khanna became the leading on and off screen couple of the 80’s with hits like Fiffty Fiffty, Suraag, Souten, Aakhir Kyun, Bewafai, Insaaf Main Karoonga and Adhikar(1986).[62] Ram Awatar Agnihotri wrote that Tina Munim showed the first sparks of the dedicated actress she would become in the films \"Alag Alag\" and \"Adhikar\", both with Khanna.[63] He also acted in the Marathi hit film \"Sundara Satarkar\" in 1981.[64] He has performed in the least number of multi-starrer films in comparison to his contemporaries and portrayed the central character in the few multistarrers he acted. Khanna delivered multi-starrer superhits like Rajput, Dharam Aur Kanoon,[65] Zamana, Dil-E-Nadan, Ashanti, Awam (film) and Ghar Ka Chiraag. He did three potboiler movies with Jeetendra, which were blockbusters-Dharam Kanta,[66] Nishaan and Maqsad.[67] Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar is one of the memorable political films of Rajesh Khanna. Khanna played the character of a corrupt politician in this film. Viewers praised his role in the film.[68] The year 1985 saw him turn a producer with Alag Alag. Eleven films, with Khanna in the lead, released in 1985 and seven of these became hits and in addition had two films with him in special appearance.[69] Before joining politics one of his last films as the lead hero was Swarg released in 1990. David Dhawan regards Swarg as his most favorite directorial venture and said in an interview \" Swarg did well. Though a serious film, people even today talk about it as it struck a chord. I was working with Rajesh Khanna for the first time. I shared a good rapport with him. He never threw tantrums on the sets.\"[70]\n\nHe experimented with films of different genres like tragedy in Babu as a rickshaw puller, thriller in Redrose as a psycopath, political adventure in Awam, negative roles in Dhanwan and Redrose, fantasy in Bundalbaaz and Jaanwar, crime in Phir Wohi Raat and Angarey, suspense in Chakravyuha and Iteefaq, comedy in Hum Dono and Masterji, action in Ashanti, family dramas like Aanchal and Amrit and Agar Tum Na Hote, variety of social films like Avtaar, Naya Kadam, Akhir Kyun and with different themes like reincarnation theme in Kudrat, patriotism in Prem Kahani, immature young love theme handled in different ways in films like Anokha Rishta, Nazrana and Dil E Nadan and did college romance in Bandish. He has played variety of characters as the lead hero – as a postman in Palkon Ki Chaon Mein, as a lawyer who proves that his senior has committed a rape 25 years earlier in Kudrat, as a politician in Aaj Ka MLA Ram Avtaar, as a young musician forced by fate to marry two women in Asha Jyoti, as professional advocate in Awaaz, fisherman in Prem Bandhan, a revolutionary patriot who is torn apart by love and policeman like in Prem Kahanai, as a righteous farmer in Bandhan etc.\n\nHe shared a very close relationship with R.D. Burman[71] and Kishore Kumar. The trio were very close friends and have worked together in more than thirty films.[72] Work of Pancham with Khanna is regarded as legendary and far superior than any other actor-music director combinations.[73] The king of playback singing Kishore Kumar had even credited Rajesh Khanna for his resurgence, so much so that he sang for Alag Alag, the first film produced by Rajesh Khanna without charging anything.[74][75] In 1985 Pancham found himself being sidelined after failure of few films but Rajesh Khanna was among the few who continued to stand by him.[76] Rajesh and Pancham worked together even after the death of Kishore in the films Jai Shiv Shankar, the unreleased film Police Ke Peechhe Police (both produced by Khanna ) and Sautela Bhai. Khanna even helped Leena Gangully and Amit Kumar in completing Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein, the last film directed by Kishore who died before the completion of the film.\n\nActors who were part of the cast of most of his films include Ashok Kumar, Sujit Kumar, Prem Chopra, Madan Puri, Asrani, Bindu, Vijay Arora, Roopesh Kumar, Dina Pathak and A. K. Hangal, who remained part of his \" working team\" since the start until the late eighties. The lyricist whom he preferred for his movies was Anand Bakshi. Films by Shakti Samanta with Khanna in the lead, music by Pancham and lyrics by Anand Bakshi had people swooning over. The films Samanta directed without Khanna in the eighties were duds.[77][78] His other close friends from the film industry include Raj Babbar, J. Om Prakash and Jeetendra.\n\nPyarelal quoted in an interview that “Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout “Wah! Wah!” in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Bewafai. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too.[35]\n\nCelebrities of the post-2000 era, like Madhur Bhandarkar, say that they take at least three or four turns in Carter Road even today only to see Khanna.[79] The younger generation stars like Imran Khan still regard Rajesh Khanna as someone who would take the top slot as the most romantic hero of all time.[80] Shahrukh Khan idolises Rajesh Khanna and has opined,\"Rajesh Khanna you can’t touch\".[81] Actor Tom Alter confessed “I still dream of being Rajesh Khanna. For me, in the early 1970s, he was the only hero – romantic to the core, not larger than life, so Indian and real – he was my hero; the reason I came into films and he still is.”[82] Actor Irrfan Khan accepted in an interview, \"The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality.\"[83] Rajesh Khanna was the last superstar to set fashion trends.[84] The trend of wearing guru kurtas and belt on shirts became famous in seventies and eighties because of Khanna.[85]\n\nFrom the early nineties onwards he stopped acting and served as M.P. of New Delhi Constituency from 1991 to 1996. During that period, he returned to acting, appearing in Khudai(1994). He made a comeback as a NRI in Aa Ab Laut Chalen(1999), and Kyaa Dil Ne Kahaa(2002). In September 2007, he officially announced his planned return to the big screen, signing a contract for several new films, including some television serials.\n\n[edit]Television\n\nHe is a life member of the International Film And Television Research Centre, the International Film And Television Club and the Asian Academy of Film & Television.[86] He is the Guest Faculty of 'Specialized Cinema Courses At Asian School Of Media Studies'. On 10 April 1999 Khanna inaugurated the live concert of S.P. Balasubramanyam held at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad as a tribute to Pancham.[87] In 2001 and 2002, Rajesh played the lead in two television serials: Aapne Parai (B4U & DD Metro)[88] and Ittefaq (Zee TV).[89] He performed in a video album based on Tagore's songs (Rabindra Sangeet) without payment, and is currently in the process of creating his own music channel \"R.K. Music Channel\".[90] He also endorsed Star se Superstar tak – a talent hunt programme in 2007 and donated a Gold Trophy of Rs.1 crore. In its Silver Jubilee Episode on 14–15 March 2008, K for Kishore aired a Rajesh Khanna special. He signed on to star in a TV serial with Creative Eye Banner (Dhiraj Kumar) in 2007, and in 2008 performed in a TV serial, Bhabhima, with Leena Ganguly as his co-star. His successful TV serial Raghukul Reet Sada Chali Aayi began in November 2008 and ended in September 2009.[91] Khanna cites the lack of good roles for actors like him in the films these days. He said in an interview on being queried about his decision to do TV serials, \"The reach of TV is much more than cinema today and one episode of my serial is likely to be watched by more people than a super-hit film\".[92] In 2009, on his 67th birthday, Shemaroo Entertainment released his films and a song collection titled Screen Legends-Rajesh Khanna-the Original Superstar.[93]\n\n[edit]Political and business career\n\nRajesh Khanna was a member of Parliament for the Congress Party, from the New Delhi constituency, where he won the 1992 by-election, retaining his seat until the 1996 election.[94] He has since been a political activist for the Congress Party.\n\nKhanna and a group of foreign investors have bought land in Shirdi on which they plan to build a religious resort for disciples of Sai Baba of Shirdi.[95]\n\n[edit]Awards, honours and recognitions\n\nMain article: List of Rajesh Khanna's awards, honours and recognitions\n\n[edit]Filmography\n\n[edit]Actor\n\nMain article: Rajesh Khanna filmography\n\n[edit]Producer\n\nYearFilm\n\n1985Alag Alag\n\n1989Police Ke Peeche Police\n\n1990Jai Shiv Shankar\n\n[edit]Co-Producer\n\nYearFilm\n\n1971Mehboob Ki Mehndi\n\n1974Roti\n\n1995Barsaat\n\n[edit]Playback Singer\n\nBaharon Ke Sapne (1967)\n\nSafar (1970)\n\nRaja Rani (1973)\n\nShehzada (1972)\n\nAmar Prem (1972)\n\nDaag (1973)\n\nAjnabee\n\nSouten (1983)\n\n193,839 items / 1,565,756 views\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRajesh Khanna (Hindi: राजेश खन्ना About this sound pronunciation (help·info); Punjabi: ਰਾਜੇਸ਼ ਖੰਨਾ, Urdu: راجيش کھنہ) (born Jatin Khanna on 29 December 1942) is a multiple Filmfare and BFJA award-winning Indian actor from Hindi films,[1] and has been Hindi film producer and an Indian politician.\n\nDuring his career, he appeared in over 160 films of which 96 had him as the solo hero and 17 were two hero projects.[2] He won three Filmfare Best Actor Awards and was nominated for the same fourteen times.

Khanna attended St. Sebastian’s Goan High School in Girgaum, along with his friend Ravi Kapoor, who later took the stage name Jeetendra. Their mothers were kirtan[clarification needed] pals.[7] Khanna gradually started taking interest in theatre and did a lot of plays in his school and college days and won many prizes in the inter college drama competitions.[8] Khanna became a rare newcomer who struggled in his own MG sports car to get work in theatre and films in the early sixties.[9] Both friends later studied in Kishinchand Chellaram College(KC).[10] When Jeetendra went for his first film audition, it was Khanna who tutored him.

Burman went on to make a number of popular films, including Kati Patang, Amar Prem, Shehzada, Apna Desh, Mere Jeevan Saathi, Aap Ki Kasam, Ajnabee, Namak Haraam, Maha Chor, Karm, Phir Wohi Raat, Aanchal, Kudrat, Ashanti, Agar Tum Na Hote, Awaaz, Hum Dono and Alag Alag.\n\nRajesh Khanna had 15 consecutive hits between 1969 to 1972, which is still an unbroken record in Indian film history.[45] The commercial success of his films declined during 1976–78.\n\nKhanna considered Guru Dutt, Meena Kumari and Geeta Bali as his idols.Khanna dislosed in an interview,\" My inspirations include, Dilip Kumar's dedication and intensity, Raj Kapoor's spontaneity, Dev Anand's style and Shammi Kapoor's rhythm.\"[26]\n\n1976–1978\n\nBetween 1976 and 1978, Khanna acted in nine films that were not commercially successful. Seven of these were rated highly by critics upon their release and have achieved strong cult status over the years among the viewers and these films included Mehbooba,[46] Bundal Baaz, Tyaag, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Naukri, Chakravyuha and Janata Havaldar which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, Meeraj, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and Mehmood Ali, respectively. Khanna persuaded Samanta to cast his sister-in-law Simple Kapadia opposite him in Anurodh.[47] Films starring Rajesh Khanna and directed by Shakti Samanta tended to be commercially successful, but Mehbooba was an exception.[48][49] K. Balachander then remade his film Arangetram in Hindi as Aaina with Mumtaz in the lead and Khanna in a cameo appearance in 1977. This film was also unsuccessful. The change from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers caused the decline of Khanna's career in terms of box office ratings to some extent. The declaration of emergency in India had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption becoming success.[50] Actor Joy Mukherjee made Chhailla Babu, a suspense thriller in 1977, which became the only successful film of his as a director[51] and the unexpected success of the Chhailla Babu gave a boost to the career of Khanna.[52] However, Khanna continued basically in solo hero social sober household meaningful films during this era and played a variety of characters in films of various genres. During this phase too he had box office hits like Maha Chor,[53] Chhailla Babu,[54] Anurodh and Karm.\n\nLater career (1979–present)\n\nAfter 1978, Khanna starred in critically acclaimed commercially successful films[55] such as Amardeep, Phir Wohi Raat, Bandish,[56] Thodisi Bewafaii, Dard, Kudrat, Dhanwan, Avtaar, Agar Tum Na Hote, Souten, Jaanwar, Asha Jyoti, Awaaz,[57] Naya Kadam,[58]Hum Dono, Babu, Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar,[59] Shatru,[60] Insaaf Main Karoonga, Anokha Rishta, Nazrana, Angaarey, Adhikar (1986) and Amrit. Director Bharathiraja decided to remake his 1978 Tamil box office hit film \"Sigappu Rojakkal\" in Hindi with Khanna playing the role of a psychopath.[61] Kamal Haasan who played the same role in Tamil won South Filmfare Best Actor Award for his portrayal.[62] But the Hindi movie was seen as controversial by traditional and orthodox Hindi moviegoers and was not a commercial success, although Khanna's performance has been rated later higher by critics than the original.[63]\n\nTina Munim and Rajesh Khanna became the leading on and off screen couple of the 80’s with hits like Fiffty Fiffty, Suraag, Souten, Aakhir Kyun, Bewafai, Insaaf Main Karoonga and Adhikar(1986).[64] Ram Awatar Agnihotri wrote that Tina Munim showed the first sparks of the dedicated actress she would become in the films \"Alag Alag\" and \"Adhikar\", both with Khanna.[65] He also acted in the Marathi hit film \"Sundara Satarkar\" in 1981.[66] He has performed in the least number of multi-starrer films in comparison to his contemporaries and portrayed the central character in the few multistarrers he acted. Khanna delivered multi-starrer superhits like Rajput, Dharam Aur Kanoon,[67] Zamana, Dil-E-Nadan, Ashanti, Awam (film) and Ghar Ka Chiraag. He did three potboiler movies with Jeetendra, which were blockbusters-Dharam Kanta,[68] Nishaan and Maqsad.[69] Aaj Ka M.L.A. Ram Avtar is one of the memorable political films of Rajesh Khanna. Khanna played the character of a corrupt politician in this film. Viewers praised his role in the film.[70] The year 1985 saw him turn a producer with Alag Alag. Eleven films, with Khanna in the lead, released in 1985 and seven of these became hits[clarification needed] and in addition had three films with him in special appearance.[71] Before joining politics one of his last films as the lead hero was Swarg released in 1990. David Dhawan regards Swarg as his most favorite directorial venture and said in an interview \" Swarg did well. Though a serious film, people even today talk about it as it struck a chord. I was working with Rajesh Khanna for the first time. I shared a good rapport with him. He never threw tantrums on the sets.\"[72]\n\nHe experimented with films of different genres like tragedy in Babu, thriller in Redrose, political adventure in Awam, negative roles in Dhanwan and Redrose, fantasy in Bundalbaaz and Jaanwar, crime in Phir Wohi Raat, comedy in Hum Dono and Masterji, family drama like Aanchal and Amrit and Agar Tum Na Hote, social film like Avtaar, Akhir Kyun and with different themes like reincarnation theme in Kudrat, patriotism in Prem Kahani, college romance in Bandish and professionalism in Awaaz.\n\nHe shared a very close relationship with R.D. Burman[73] and Kishore Kumar. The trio were very close friends and have worked together in more than thirty films.[74] Work of Pancham with Khanna is regarded as legendary and far superior than any other actor-music director combinations.[75] The king of playback singing Kishore Kumar had even credited Rajesh Khanna for his resurgence, so much so that he sang for Alag Alag, the first film produced by Rajesh Khanna without charging anything.[76][77] In 1985 Pancham found himself being sidelined after failure of few films but Rajesh Khanna was among the few who continued to stand by him.[78] Rajesh and Pancham worked together even after the death of Kishore in the films Jai Shiv Shankar, the unreleased film Police Ke Peechhe Police (both produced by Khanna ) and Sautela Bhai. Khanna even helped Leena Gangully and Amit Kumar in completing Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein, the last film directed by Kishore who died before the completion of the film.\n\nActors who were part of the cast of most of his films include Ashok Kumar, Sujit Kumar, Prem Chopra, Madan Puri, Asrani, Bindu, Vijay Arora, Roopesh Kumar, Dina Pathak and A. K. Hangal, who remained part of his \" working team\" since the start until the late eighties. The lyricist whom he preferred for his movies was Anand Bakshi. Films by Shakti Samanta with Khanna in the lead, music by Pancham and lyrics by Anand Bakshi had people swooning over. The films Samanta directed without Khanna in the eighties were duds.[79][80] His other close friends from the film industry include Raj Babbar, J. Om Prakash and Jeetendra.\n\nPyarelal quoted in an interview that “Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout “Wah! Wah!” in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Bewafai. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then and did not want to work with him.”[38] Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishoreda was very reluctant to sing \"Waada Tera Waada\" in Dushman and suggested Laxmikant Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishoreda meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishoreda that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.[38]\n\nCelebrities of the post-2000 era, like Madhur Bhandarkar, say that they take at least three or four turns in Carter Road even today only to see Khanna.[81] The younger generation stars like Imran Khan still regard Rajesh Khanna as someone who would take the top slot as the most romantic hero of all time.[82] Sharukh Khan idolises Rajesh Khanna and has opined,\"Rajesh Khanna you can’t touch\".[83] Actor Tom Alter confessed “I still dream of being Rajesh Khanna. For me, in the early 1970s, he was the only hero — romantic to the core, not larger than life, so Indian and real — he was my hero; the reason I came into films and he still is.”[84] Actor Irrfan Khan accepted in an interview, \"The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality.\"[85] Rajesh Khanna was the last superstar to set fashion trends.[86] The trend of wearing guru kurtas and belt on shirts became famous in seventies and eighties because of Khanna.[87]\n\nAkshay Kumar was a fan of Khanna since his childhood and later when he became Khanna's son-in-law, he told \"Look at what destiny had in store for me. I married my idol's daughter! I still can't believe it. Who wasn't his fan in the 1970s? I remember queuing up for hours to watch Aradhana, Amar Prem, Kati Patang. These are among my favourite films of all times.\"[88] When Action Replayy, a film starring Akshay in the lead released in 2010, Akshay ensured that Rajesh Khanna was the first person to watch the film in theaters. On the eve of the film's release Akshay said \"The film is set in the era that belongs to my father-in-law. I am proud of being part of the family now. Mr Khanna will be the first person to watch the film. I'm determined about that.\"[89] Action Replayy was a film which paid homage to the decade when Rajesh Khanna ruled.[90] Amitabh Bachchan, while presenting the lifetime achievement award to Khanna at the IIFA awards of 2009 acknowledged, \"The word superstar in the Indian film industry was for the first time coined for him\".[91]\n\nFrom the early nineties onwards he stopped acting and served as M.P. of New Delhi Constituency from 1991 to 1996. During that period, he returned to acting, appearing in Khudai(1994). He made a comeback as a NRI in Aa Ab Laut Chalen(1999), and Kyaa Dil Ne Kahaa(2002). In September 2007, he officially announced his planned return to the big screen, signing a contract for several new films, including some television serials.\n\nTelevision\n\nHe is a life member of the International Film And Television Research Centre, the International Film And Television Club and the Asian Academy of Film & Television.[92] He is the Guest Faculty of 'Specialized Cinema Courses At Asian School Of Media Studies'. On April 10, 1999 Khanna inaugurated the live concert of S.P. Balasubramanyam held at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad as a tribute to Pancham.[93] In 2001 and 2002, Rajesh played the lead in two television serials: Aapne Parai (B4U & DD Metro) [94] and Ittefaq (Zee TV).[95] He performed in a video album based on Tagore's songs (Rabindra Sangeet) without payment, and is currently in the process of creating his own music channel \"R.K. Music Channel\".[96] He also endorsed Star se Superstar tak - a talent hunt programme in 2007 and donated a Gold Trophy of Rs.1 crore. In its Silver Jubilee Episode on 14–15 March 2008, K for Kishore aired a Rajesh Khanna special. He signed on to star in a TV serial with Creative Eye Banner (Dhiraj Kumar) in 2007, and in 2008 performed in a TV serial, Bhabhima, with Leena Ganguly as his co-star. His successful TV serial Raghukul Reet Sada Chali Aayi began in November 2008 and ended in September 2009.[97] Khanna cites the lack of good roles for actors like him in the films these days. He said in an interview on being queried about his decision to do TV serials, \"The reach of TV is much more than cinema today and one episode of my serial is likely to be watched by more people than a super-hit film\".[98] In 2009, on his 67th birthday, Shemaroo Entertainment released his films and a song collection titled Screen Legends-Rajesh Khanna-the Original Superstar.[99]\n\nPolitical and business career\n\nRajesh Khanna was a member of Parliament for the Congress Party, from the New Delhi constituency, where he won the 1992 by-election, retaining his seat until the 1996 election.[100] He has since been a political activist for the Congress Party.\n\nKhanna and a group of foreign investors have bought land in Shirdi on which they plan to build a religious resort for disciples of Sai Baba of Shirdi.[101]"
