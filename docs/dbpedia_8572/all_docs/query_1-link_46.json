        "text": "This is Sheru (named after the Hindi word 'sher' for lion), one of four lion brothers born on 19 November, 2016.\n\nSheru and his siblings are amongst the new residents at the newly-opened Sydney Zoo, in Bungarribee, New South Wales.\n\nHere, Sheru rests in the warmth of the morning sun.\n\nDuring just about any visit to a zoo, I always head straight towards the lions.\n\nSydney Zoo has four male lions, and on this particular visit, I was fortunate enough to see Sheru out on a rocky outcrop, away from his brothers, looking in my general direction as he rested in the morning sun.\n\nPhotographed on Dharug land.\n\nDuring our second visit to the Sydney Zoo, I naturally spent most of my time with the lions.\n\nSydney Zoo is home to four male siblings, who were born on 19 November, 2016.\n\nThis is Sheru, and during the afternoon, a few hours after we had a personal encounter and hand-fed Sheru's brothers Bakari and Virunga, I spent more time photographing Sheru as he sat on the top of his hill and rested.\n\nLions are such majestic big cats, and any time spent with them, either in the wild or in zoos, is time well spent.\n\nOne of the male lions (possibly Karoo or Virunga, but definitely not Bakari or Sheru) at the Sydney Zoo rests in the afternoon sun.\n\nThis unusual view of one of the lions in the lion enclosure is unusual, in that it was captured from underneath the boardwalk, an area not accessible to the public.\n\nDuring a wildlife photography workshop hosted by Peter Sharp, we were given exclusive access to this part of the zoo, which not only allowed us to see these impressive lions up close, but photograph them from an eye-level or lower vantage point.\n\nPhotographed on Dharug land.\n\nThe bottom of the wicker basket hasn’t seen an occupant since we lived in Chelsea (before I was even on flickr, I think), but is seeing renewed use as a private spot for Ahja, since Sheru can’t fit inside.\n\nI would really like to get a slow motion video one day of the way the wind waves through her fur when she goes outside--it so clearly says, \"Now here is a cat made for cold weather.\""
