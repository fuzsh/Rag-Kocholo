        "text": "The origin of Assamese Cinema can be traced back to the dreams and imagination of a revolutionary visionary, Rupkonwar Jyotiprasad Agarwala, who was also a distinguished poet, playwright, composer and freedom fighter. He was instrumental in the production of the first Assamese Film Joymati, under the banner of Critrakala Movietone. Due to the lack of trained technicians, Jyotiprasad, , had to shoulder the added responsibilities of the script writer, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director while making his maiden film. The film, completed with a budget of Rupees sixty thousand was released on March 10th, 1935. It was the third Indian talkie to be released, a fact unknown to many. It is unfortunate that like so many early Indian films, the negatives and complete prints of Joymati are missing.\n\nThe film did not do well and Jyotiprasad Agarwala had to endure heavy losses. However, despite the failure of his venture, Jyotiprasad made another film after a lapse of two years titled Indramalati (1939). It was his second and last film. The eminent composer and singer of Assam Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, played a stellar role in the film.. With the passing away of Jyotiprasad, the Assamese film scenario witnessed a temporary lull for about a couple of years. But things changed with the onset of war, Taking advantage of this, the Late Rohini Kumar Baruah made a film on a relevant historical topic called Manomati (1941). It was followed by films like Parvati Baruah’s Rupahi (1946), Kamal Narayan choudhury’s Badan Barphukan (1947), Phani Sharma’s Siraj, Asit Sen’s Biplabi, Prabin Phukan’s Parghat and Suresh Goswami’s Runumi.\n\nBut the most remarkable film of the fifties was Piyali Phukan which went on to win a National award. In 1955, a new talent Nip Barua made his directorial debut with Smriti Paras. His subsequent films Mak Aaru Moram and Ranga Police bagged many state awards and a silver medal at the national level. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika also produced and directed his first film Era Batur Sur. Prabhat Mukherjee made a film on the universality of mother-hood, Puberan (1959),which was shown at the Berlin Film Festival. The next memorable production was Lachit Borphukan by Sarbeswar Chakraborty. Dr. Bhupen Hazarika made his unforgettable musical Shakuntala (1961) which proved equally successful with critics and the press. It also won a president’s award. Following this, a number of films began to be produced regularlyproduction and were released.
