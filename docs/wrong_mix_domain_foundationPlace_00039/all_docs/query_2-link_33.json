        "text": "The Siebel Repository is a key component of the Siebel architecture. The data stored in a repository is typically named metadata because it describes the architecture and logical behavior of a program in an abstract (\"meta\") manner. In the next section, we will discuss the content of the Siebel Repository in detail.\n\nDevelopers and analysts use Siebel Tools to access and modify data in the repository tables of the Siebel database. Each modification must be made available to the Siebel executable by compiling a new version of the Siebel Repository File (SRF) . The following diagram depicts the relationships between Siebel Tools, the Siebel Repository File, and the Siebel executable:\n\nWe observe that the Siebel executable, which is responsible for rendering the application to the end user in the browser, accesses a different set of tables than Siebel Tools.\n\nAs indicated, the Siebel Repository can be described as metadata stored in a set of tables in a relational database. When modern programming patterns arose in the second half of the last century, developers and architects found that it is highly beneficial to separate the program logic into specialized layers.\n\nThe Siebel Repository metadata is organized in the following layers:"
