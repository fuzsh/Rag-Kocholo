        "text": "Last Updated on April 21, 2022\n\nOracle is a computer technology corporation best known for its software products and services like Java.\n\nIn 2020, Oracle was the second-largest software company in the world by revenue and market capitalization. They employ over 130,000 people, and sell cloud-engineering services and systems and database management systems.\n\nOracle has a fairly prominent position with open source. They are a supporting member of the Linux Foundation, Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, and the Java Community Process.\n\nThrough its acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010, Oracle also became the steward of many other important and long-running open source projects such as the Java programming language and the MySQL relational database, introduced in 1995. The acquisition of Sleepycat Software, brought the open source Berkeley DB key/value store.\n\nThe company co-develops the OpenJDK, an open source implementation of the Java Platform Standard Edition, and Btrfs, a B-tree file system. They also open source the Oracle Coherence Community Edition, NetBeans, and produce Oracle Linux which is a Linux distro compiled from Red Hat Enterprise Linux source code.\n\nWhile Oracle develops and distributes open source software, they have many different business models. The majority of their products are published under a proprietary license. This series looks at free and open source alternatives to Oracleâ€™s products.\n\nOracle Siebel CRM delivers a combination of transactional, analytical, and engagement features to manage all customer-facing operations.\n\nSiebel CRM is proprietary software and not available for Linux. What are the best free and open source alternatives?\n\n1. Odoo\n\nOdoo is a complete Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software.

It manages key tasks such as communication, identification, prioritization, assignment, resolution and notification.\n\n2. vTiger\n\nvTiger is an easy to install Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution.\n\nThe software provides CRM functionality including contact management, campaigns, sales pipeline, calendar, project Manager, customer portal and documents. There are also ERP modules available such as inventory.\n\n3. SuiteCRM\n\nSuiteCRM is a software fork of the popular Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system SugarCRM, developed and maintained by SalesAgility.\n\nWith SuiteCRM, users can build business process models and create flexible, automated actions that can be activated to operate at any time.
