The tasks required to prepare your environment for Siebel CRM installation.\n\nInstallation Activities. The tasks required to install Siebel CRM on your server(s).\n\nConfiguration Activities. The tasks that prepare the various components of the software to work together to deliver the Siebel User Interface to users, interface with other systems, and so on.\n\nThis chapter will provide guidance on each of these topic areas. It is important to note that detailed information on the information provided in this chapter can be found in the Siebel Installation Guide for Microsoft Windows or in Siebel Installation Guide for UNIX, available on the Siebel Bookshelf, as appropriate. This is intended as a high-level overview only.\n\nInstalling Prerequisite Software: Overview\n\nSiebel CRM installs most of the software that it requires to run. However, depending on your operating system and database, you may need to install the following software before you install Siebel CRM. The minimum software requirements for installing Siebel CRM are as follows:\n\nOperating System. A number of different operating systems support Siebel CRM, including various releases of Microsoft Windows and UNIX. Before beginning installation, confirm that your operating system is certified on the Certifications tab on My Oracle Support.\n\nEnterprise Database. A number of different enterprise databases support Siebel CRM, including various releases of Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2. Before beginning installation, confirm that your enterprise database is certified on the Certifications tab on My Oracle Support. You must install the enterprise database software before you install Siebel CRM.\n\nNote: It is strongly recommended that you install the database platform on a separate server to that of your Siebel CRM installation.\n\nDatabase Connectivity. The server on which you install Siebel CRM installation requires database connectivity software to interact with the enterprise database. For example, to interact with an Oracle database, you must install the Oracle 32-bit database client. To interact a Microsoft SQL Server instance, you must install the SQL Server Native Client on each server where you install Siebel CRM. Before installing, confirm that your database connectivity software is certified on the Certifications tab on My Oracle Support.\n\nJava Development Kit. You must install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on at least one server to generate certificate requests and to install the resulting signed certificate on each server hosting any of the Siebel Enterprise Applications. JDK is freely available from the Oracle Technology Network. Before installing, confirm for specific supported versions on the Certifications tab on My Oracle Support. The 64-bit version of the JDK is required for Windows servers.\n\nNote: Other tools are available for generating certificate requests. Your organization may choose to use one of these alternate tools, which would eliminate the need for the JDK to be installed.\n\nJava Runtime Environment. When you download Siebel CRM, the installation files are stored in a set of Java Archives (JAR) files. In order to create an image of the software during installation, you require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE is freely available from http://www.java.com. Before installing, confirm for specific supported versions on the Certifications tab on My Oracle Support. Note that either the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the JRE is acceptable for Siebel CRM installation.\n\nNote: The JRE is only required on the machine where you generate the Siebel installation image.\n\nBuilding a Network Image\n\nThis topic describes creating a network image.\n\nNote: The syntax here is shown for Windows servers; there are very minor differences if you create a network image on a UNIX-based system.\n\nAfter you download the installation files, you need to build a network image for both the base version and the latest Update. You then execute the network image on each machine where you want to install Siebel CRM. However, the files that you download cannot be installed directly, and you are required to extract these files before installation. This is done using the Siebel Network Image Creator (SNIC). You must perform the following steps for the base release file and again for the patch set file. If you are planning to install the application on a UNIX system, you can create the network images on a Windows system, or vice versa. Creating a network installation image is a separate process from performing the installation.\n\nIn Windows Explorer, navigate to the base release files that you downloaded from Oracle Software Delivery Cloud (OSDC) or My Oracle Support (MOS).\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the downloaded base release files.\n\nUnzip the base release files into the same folder.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the correct file structure after you unzip the base release files.\n\nOpen a command or shell window and navigate to the path where you unzipped the files.\n\nEnsure that the JAVA_HOME variable is set to the location of your Java Runtime Environment (JRE), for example: set JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre1.8.0-151\n\nLaunch the snic.bat (Windows) or snic.sh (UNIX) script to start building the network image.\n\nWhen prompted to generate the network image, you can accept the defaults, however, consider the following important points:\n\nPlatform. AIX, HPUX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows are available. If you know you will be installing Siebel CRM components on both Windows and Solaris boxes, for example, you can select both at this time.\n\nProducts. There are five choices available. The minimum requirement is:\n\nSiebel Enterprise Server. Required for all Siebel CRM environments.\n\nSiebel Tools. This is required for functionality that is unavailable in Siebel Web Tools. For example, all visual designers (Workflow, Task Based UI, etc.), writing script on runtime repository objects, and performing upgrade and incremental repository merges.\n\nSiebel Web Client. Required for script debugging, workflow simulation, and other development tasks.\n\nLanguages. Siebel offers 22 standard languages. At a minimum, it is strongly recommended that you select English (ENU), even if it is not your intended primary language. If there is any possibility that you require more languages in Siebel CRM, it is recommended that you create images for them now and install all potential languages during your initial installation. It is more convenient to do this now, rather than adding languages later.\n\nOn completion, the SNIC prepares the installer image and saves the installation files in the location you specified.\n\nRepeat this procedure for the Monthly Update files that you downloaded from MOS.\n\nSecure Sockets Layer Requirements: Overview\n\nSeveral Siebel Application components are hosted within application containers that need to trust each other and also need to be trusted by client browsers or other external servers that integrate with Siebel CRM. This requirement is accommodated by creating a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate.\n\nThere are three steps required to create a SSL certificate:\n\nGenerate a certificate request on the server.\n\nSend the certificate to a certificate authority (CA) to approve the request and issue the certificate.\n\nImport the certificate into a keystore used by the Siebel CRM components.\n\nNote: For more information on SSL requirements, see Siebel Security Guide.\n\nAbout Selecting a Certificate Authority\n\nThe following options are available when choosing a certificate authority (CA):\n\nTrusted Root Certificate Authority. These are external companies who are inherently trusted by various operating systems and browsers, such as Symantec or GeoTrust. This is the preferred option because most components, including end-user browsers, will trust a certificate issued by a Trusted Root CA without requiring special action. This is a required approach for any environment that will be Internet-facing, such as a customer or partner portal.\n\nFor environments that are specifically internal, you can use an existing internal CA to issue a certificate. In this scenario, machines within the corporate network will typically already be configured to trust the internal CA, and therefore a certificate signed by that CA to servers running Siebel CRM will inherently be trusted by internal clients.\n\nNote: You cannot use this method for Internet-facing environments. External computers and other devices will not trust the certificate and will therefore throw security warnings when a user accesses the Siebel CRM environment. This method is sufficient only for specifically internal production environments and development, such as test or training environments and so on.\n\nWhen no internal CA is available and it is not feasible to obtain a certificate from an external Trusted Root Certificate Authority, you can create your own CA. However, anyone who accesses this environment will receive certificate security errors unless they manually import the root certificate for your CA. We recommend that you consider this method only when no other options are possible, and that it is used only for development and test environments.\n\nAfter selecting a CA, submit your certificate request and the CA will issue an actual certificate.\n\nThe CA provides the specific information required to make the certificate request. An important consideration during this process is how you select Subject Alternative Names (SANs). These allow multiple machines to use the same SSL certificate. For example, if you want to install Siebel CRM components on five servers: server1.mycompany.com, server2.mycompany.com, server3.mycompany.com, and so on, you can create a single certificate request on any machine, providing all five machine names to the CA as SANs. You can then install the resulting certificate on all of your servers. It is also possible to request a wildcard certificate, for example, *.mycompany.com, which can be used on all servers.\n\nImporting the Certificate Request\n\nAfter you generate the certificate request, you submit it to your chosen certificate authority (CA). You then import the returned certificate into the keystore. Because your servers rely completely on your keystore, you need to import the root and any intermediate certificates. These are provided by the CA and you must import them to the same keystore where you created the certificate request.\n\nOpen a command prompt window.\n\nExecute the following commands:\n\nkeytool -import -alias my_certificate_authority -file rootcert.cer -keystore .\\siebelkeystore.jks\n\nImports the root CA certificate into the keystore. You are prompted to confirm if you trust the certificate.\n\n(Optional) keytool -import -alias intermediate_certificate_authority -file intercert.cer -keystore .\\siebelkeystore.jks\n\nImports an intermediate CA certificate into the keystore if required. Your CA will inform you if this is a requirement.\n\nkeytool -import -alias siebel -file my_cert.cer -keystore .\\siebelkeystore.jks\n\nImports the Siebel certificate into the keystore.\n\nkeytool -import -alias my_certificate_authority -file rootcert.cer -keystore .\\TrustStore.jks\n\nCreates the truststore and imports the CA certificate. This is the first reference to the truststore, so it prompts you for a password in order to create it and then prompts you as to whether or not to trust the certificate.\n\nNote: For simplicity, it is recommended that you use the same password for both the Siebel Keystore and the TrustStore, as the installation wizards for Siebel CRM request both the stores, but only ask for one password. If your keystore and truststore have different passwords, you will need to manually edit the server.xml file after completing the installation. This file is located in the applicationcontainer\\conf folder for that component.\n\nInstalling Software for the Siebel CRM Application\n\nThere are a number of software components required to implement Siebel CRM fully, depending on your requirements and your implementation. The following illustration shows the minimum required components and how they interact with each other.\n\nThere are three distinct software installers that you will use to create your development environment:\n\nSiebel Enterprise Software. This provides the required software for the following components:\n\nSiebel Gateway. This uses the embedded application container functionality to manage communications with other modules. Configuration data for the Siebel environment is stored internally to the Siebel Gateway.\n\nSiebel Enterprise. This is a logical profile that defines the physical storage locations used by the Siebel Servers. For example, database type, name, location, and credentials, as well as the Siebel File System location and other global parameters.\n\nSiebel Server. This is the application server that provides the interface to the Siebel database and file system, enforcing business logic. This is typically a load-balanced component running parallel on multiple servers.\n\nSiebel Application Interface. This provides the delivery of Web pages from the Siebel Server to Web clients.\n\nSiebel Database. The Siebel CRM product stores all of its configuration information and user data within a customer-selected database, for example Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or IBM DB2. The Siebel Enterprise Software installer provides the scripts necessary to populate this database with the required tables, indexes, data, and other objects necessary to run Siebel CRM.\n\nSiebel Tools. This is a 32-bit Windows application that allows developers and administrators to make changes to the Siebel repository. You can implement many changes using the Siebel Web Client, however in Siebel Innovation Pack 2017, there are some specific types of repository changes that require the 32-bit Windows Siebel Tools client, such as modifications to Workflow processes.\n\nSiebel Developer Web Client. This is a 32-bit Windows application that allows developers and administrators to interact with the Siebel Database without needing any Siebel Server components. While it is not mandatory to run the application, having Siebel Developer Web Client available typically facilitates certain configuration and deployment activities, such as debugging scripts or workflow processes.\n\nDuring a basic installation, for example in a development environment, you only require a single instance of each component, but you can chose to install additional servers. For a test or production environment, it is likely that there will be more than one Siebel Enterprise Server and more than one Siebel Application Interface. This is to provide load balancing and resiliency.\n\nThis guide describes a minimal configuration, installing one of each component. For more information, see Siebel Applications Administration Guide.\n\nInstalling the Siebel Enterprise Software\n\nTo install the Siebel Enterprise Software, do the following:\n\nRun the setup.bat or setup.sh file from the Siebel_Enterprise_Software\\Disk1\\install folder created by Siebel Network Image Creator (SNIC).\n\nThis launches an installation wizard in which you can accept many default settings. Some of the critical installation prompts and recommended responses are as follows:\n\nApplication Install Task. If you are performing a new installation of Siebel, then select New Installation. Otherwise, select Migrate Installation. This guide focuses on new installations. For information pertaining to all types of installation, see Siebel Installation Guide for Microsoft Windows or Siebel Installation Guide for UNIX as appropriate.\n\nInstallation Directory. You can install all Siebel components under a single parent directory. To simplify installation, install everything under x:\\Siebel, where x is a local drive, such as C: or D:. If installing Siebel CRM on UNIX, you can install in a similar location on your UNIX machine. In this guide, we install all components to C:\\Siebel. The installer adds the ses folder automatically as a subfolder under Siebel. The final path is C:\\Siebel\\ses\n\nComponents. In a non-production instance, it is typical to install the following components together:\n\nGateway\n\nSiebel Server\n\nDatabase Configuration Utilities\n\nWhen these components are selected, the installer issues a warning message indicating that you cannot install these components together in an end-user environment. You are installing for a development instance, therefore you can ignore this warning.\n\nLanguages. At a minimum, it is recommended that you select English (ENU), even if it is not your intended primary language.\n\nNote: It is not possible to add languages after the initial installation. If there is any possibility that you require more languages in Siebel CRM, install all potential languages during your initial installation. Other than disk space (approximately 500MB per language), there is no negative impact to installing additional languages.\n\nPort Configuration. In a development or test environment, it is very possible that all components will be on the same physical server, as is described in this guide. For this reason, the default settings, which use standard HTTP and HTTPS ports for the application containers, are inappropriate. We need to reserve port 443, the HTTPS port, for traffic between end-user browsers and the Siebel Application Interface. The following port settings are therefore recommended for the Siebel Enterprise Server components:\n\nHTTPS Redirect Port. 9010\n\nHTTP Connection Port. 9011\n\nShutdown Port. 9012\n\nClient Authentication Parameters. These parameters indicate the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate keystores you need to copy into the installation location for the Siebel Application Interface:\n\nKeystore Name. The location of the keystore, in this example, C:\\Siebel\\Keys\\siebelkeystore.jks\n\nTruststore Name. The location of the trust keystore for your certificates, in this example C:\\Siebel\\Keys\\truststore.jks\n\nPassword. The password you used when you created your keystores.\n\nNote: If you did not use the same password when creating the keystores, then you must edit the file C:\\Siebel\\ses\\applicationcontainer\\conf\\server.xml manually after installation to set the passwords correctly.\n\nGateway TLS Port. This can be any available port, except in a migration installation from an earlier release of Siebel CRM, in which case, it must match the port for the previous Gateway installation. For simplicity, we will continue the numbering sequence and use 9013 for this port.\n\nTo facilitate re-installation, or additional automated installation, you are prompted to save your responses when you have completed each installation wizard.\n\nInstalling the Siebel Application Interface\n\nThe Siebel Application Interface (SAI) replaces the Siebel Web Server Extension (SWSE or SWE) used in previous versions. It provides a standards-based HTTPS entry point to the Siebel CRM application and is installed using the same Siebel Enterprise Server installation media as the Gateway, Siebel Servers, and Database Configuration Utilities. However, although it may be installed on the same physical server as these components, it must be installed separately and into a different directory structure from the components installed previously.\n\nTo install the Siebel Application Interface, do the following:\n\nRe-run the Siebel Enterprise Software installer.\n\nIn many cases, the options for installation will be the same as those used when installing the Gateway, Siebel Servers, and Database Configuration Utilities. You must use the following installation prompts and recommended responses for Siebel Application Interface, described as follows:\n\nInstallation Directory. This must be different from the previous directory used for the Siebel Enterprise Server. The recommended path is C:\\Siebel\\sai\n\nComponents. Only install Siebel Application Interface.\n\nLanguages. You must install the same set of languages selected during the previous installation. Other than disk space, there is no negative impact to installing additional languages.\n\nPort Configuration. The HTTP and HTTPS ports will serve as the entry point into the application (with the HTTP port automatically redirecting to the HTTPS port). If you do not want users to have to enter a port, set these to ports 443 and 80 (the default ports for HTTPS and HTTP respectively). The Shutdown port must be unique. We will continue numbering from the Siebel Enterprise Server installation and use 9014. The following port settings are therefore recommended for the Siebel Application Interface components:\n\nHTTPS Redirect Port. 443\n\nHTTP Connection Port. 80\n\nShutdown Port. 9014\n\nUsername and Password. The credentials that you specify will be used for accessing the Siebel Management Console initially, which is the user interface that we will use to configure the Gateway, Enterprise, Siebel Servers, and other components. After the initial setup, that is, once you have configured the Gateway Security Profile, you will use the username and password for the configured authentication authority. Any values are acceptable; for simplicity use: sadmin.\n\nClient Authentication Parameters. These indicate the SSL certificate key stores (that we created earlier) which will be copied into the installation location for the Siebel Application Interface:\n\nKeystore Name. The location of the keystore we created previously.\n\nFor example: C:\\Siebel\\Keys\\siebelkeystore.jks\n\nTruststore Name.The location of the trust keystore for our certificates.\n\nFor example: C:\\Siebel\\Keys\\truststore.jks\n\nPassword. Whatever password you used when you created your keystores.\n\nNote: If you did not use the same password when creating the keystores, you will have to manually edit the file C:\\Siebel\\ses\\applicationcontainer\\conf\\server.xml after installation to set the passwords correctly.\n\nAbout Installing the Latest Monthly Update\n\nBefore proceeding to the configuration steps below, it is very important that you install the latest Monthly Update. While it is possible to install Updates later, it is possible that an Update could contain bug fixes, repository data, or seed data that would not otherwise be included in your Siebel database. Only the most recent Monthly Update is required for installation, as they are cumulative. For example, if the 18.5 Update is available, it can be installed directly on top of the 17.0 Innovation Pack without the intermediate installation of 17.1, 17.2, 18.4, and so on. To install the Monthly Update, run the installers on the same machines on which you previously ran the base Innovation Pack installers.\n\nNote: If a given base Innovation Pack installer was run more than once, then you must run the Update installers a corresponding number of times. For example, if you run the Siebel Enterprise Server installer to install the Gateway, Siebel Server, and Database, and then run it once more to install the Siebel Application Interface on the same server, then you must run the Update installer twice, directing the installer to each of the ORACLE_HOMEs specified during the installation of the Innovation Pack.\n\nVerifying the Siebel Application Interface Installation\n\nYou can quickly verify that your Siebel Application Interface (SAI) installation was successful.\n\nBrowse to https://myserver.company.com/siebel/smc\n\nIf your browser displays a security warning, this is because your browser does not trust your SSL certificate or the certificate authority (CA) that you used to sign it.\n\nEnter your credentials in the login window.\n\nThese are the credentials you specified when you installed the SAI component.\n\nYou are prompted to create a gateway â for the purposes of this test, you can ignore this message as we are just verifying the installation.\n\nClose the browser.\n\nAutomatically Starting SES and SAI Components\n\nAlthough the Siebel Enterprise Server and Siebel Application Interface components will start automatically after installation, they do not run automatically after a restart of the server. Before proceeding further, it is recommended that these be configured to start automatically. The specific method for doing this will vary by operating system. For example, on Windows, you could add the scripts to the Local Computer Startup Scripts Policy so that they will be run automatically every time the computer is restarted, while on UNIX, a shell script could be placed in /etc/init.d/.\n\nThe script to startup each component is named startup.bat (or startup.sh for UNIX) and is found in the ...\\applicationcontainer\\bin folder for each component, for example C:\\Siebel\\sai\\applicationcontainer\\bin\\startup.bat.\n\nAfter configuring the scripts to run automatically, restart the machine(s) before continuing to validate that automatic startup process is working, and then proceed to the configuration of your Siebel Database.\n\nCreating the Siebel Database\n\nAbout Installing Client Connectivity Software\n\nBefore you create the Siebel database, you must ensure that you have the appropriate client connectivity software.\n\nThis varies by database platform:\n\nOracle Database. You must install the 32-bit Oracle client, even if you are running on a 64-bit machine. This is available for download from Oracle Technology Network. Consider the following guidelines when installing Oracle Database:\n\nWhen installing the software, select the Administrator option. Do not select the Instant Client or Runtime options.\n\nBefore installing the client on a Windows server, re-install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86). This prevents errors during the client installation process. Ensure that you run the installer as a local administrator.\n\nIf installing on a Windows server that also has a 64-bit version of Oracle installed, you need to edit the following registry value before running the installation: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Oracle\\inst_loc, where the Value name field is inst_loc and the Value data field is c:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Oracle\\\\inventory\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server. Install the Microsoft SQL Server Native Client, available from Microsoft.\n\nDB2. Install the IBM DB2 Connect 32-bit client (even if running on a 64âbit operating system). Select from the versions noted on the Certifications tab on My Oracle Support that are compatible with your DB2 database server version according to IBMâs certification matrix.\n\nPrerequisites for Installing the Database\n\nBefore we can start installing the Siebel Database, the database administrator must perform some preliminary steps. These are documented in detail in the Siebel Installation Guide for Microsoft Windows and Siebel Installation Guide for UNIX, but here is a short description:\n\nOracle. Create a tablespace in which the Siebel database objects will live. The recommended name is SIEBEL.\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server. Create a database. The recommended name is siebeldb.\n\nDB2. Create the SIEBEL and other database users.\n\nNote: These steps are typically done by a database administrator who may or may not be a direct member of the Siebel development team.\n\nRunning the grantusr.sql Script\n\nA database administrator, who may or may not be a direct member of the Siebel development team, performs these steps.\n\nAfter preparing the database, run the grantusr.sql script found in the .../dbsrvr/{db_platform} folder (for example, C:\\Siebel\\ses\\dbsrvr\\ORACLE). There are brief instructions at the top of each script explaining how to run the script. It will prompt you for information about the preparatory work done in the previous step, for example. the server where the database resides, the name of the database, any tablespaces, usernames, passwords, and so on. When the script completes, you will have an empty shell of a Siebel database with all the required users. Note that the execution of the script is typically done by a database administrator who may or may not be a direct member of the Siebel development team. This allows the Siebel team to have everything they need to populate the Siebel CRM Database without the need for specialized database administrator skills. The Siebel team should provide the desired passwords for the database users that the script will create. These include:\n\nSADMIN. The Siebel Administrator user will be used for administering the Siebel CRM application throughout the implementation.\n\nGUESTCST. The anonymous Guest Customer user. This user's credentials are used automatically by customer-facing applications before a user has actually logged in, providing access to the login page itself. This allows access to non-sensitive areas of the product, such as Branch Locators, without the need for every visitor to have a login.\n\nGUESTERM. The anonymous Employee user. This user's credentials are used automatically by employee-facing applications before a user has actually logged in.\n\nLDAPUSER. This is a generic user used by the authentication system.\n\nAfter the script has been executed, test the SADMIN login using a database platform-specific tool, such as SQL*Plus for Oracle, to verify that the user was correctly created.\n\nInstalling the Siebel Database\n\nThe Siebel CRM database is installed using the Database Configuration Wizard. You can execute it using the Database Server Configuration shortcut from the Windows Start menu or from the following UNIX shell: $SIEBEL_ROOT/config/config - mode dbsrvr\n\nThe configuration wizard prompts you for information on the location of the database, database names, tableowners, tablespaces, and so on, depending on your database platform. For more information, see Siebel Installation Guide for Microsoft Windows or Siebel Installation Guide for UNIX as appropriate. The following are important points to consider during database installation:\n\nWhen referring to directory locations, specify the path where the Siebel Enterprise Server (SES) components are installed, not the Siebel Application Interface (SAI) components.\n\nWhen performing the Siebel User/Role Creation step, ensure to change the default selection to: âGRANTUSR.SQL has been run by the DBA to create Siebel users and rolesâ.\n\nThis is because you already executed the grantusr.sql script. If you do not update this selection, the installation will not continue.\n\nEnsure that the Database Encoding value is Unicode. Oracle does not support non-Unicode Siebel CRM databases for new installations.\n\nIf you are installing one and only one language, you may pick it here. However, if there is any possibility that you will ever be installing multiple languages, it is recommended that you select English as the base language. This will default all log files and other settings to English, making it easier to debug when working with Oracle Technical Support. You will be able to install additional languages later.\n\nThe Configuration Wizard displays all the information you entered, and allows you to apply the changes. Once you confirm these changes, the Siebel Upgrade Wizard displays the steps necessary to install the database. Click OK to start the Siebel database installation. When the installation is complete, review the log files before continuing. For more information, see the installation guide for your selected database.\n\nConfiguring the Siebel Gateway\n\nThe Siebel Gateway maintains the configuration information for the components in the Siebel CRM environment. For example, it monitors where each Siebel Enterprise Server (SES) and Siebel Application Interface (SAI) instance is running, which components should be run on which physical servers, and so on.\n\nDo the following to configure the gateway:\n\nNavigate to the Siebel Management Console (SMC) at https://myserver.company.com/siebel/smc.\n\nThis is the server where you installed the SAI components. If you configured a HTTPS port number different from the default value, then include this in the URL.\n\nEnter the credentials that you defined when installing the SAI.\n\nThe SMC automatically determines that a Siebel Gateway has not yet been configured and starts the Gateway configuration process.\n\nEnter the requested information.\n\nFor more information, see Siebel Installation Guide for Microsoft Windows or Siebel Installation Guide for UNIX as appropriate. The following are key attributes:\n\nHost Name: HTTPS Port\n\nHost Name. This is the host name where the SES components are installed and where you intend to run the Gateway. This host name must match one of the Subject Alternative Names in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate previously generated and signed.\n\nHTTPS Port. This is the HTTPS port you selected when you installed the SES components, not SAI. For example: myserver.mycompany.com:9010\n\nSecurity Profile. This sets up the security mechanism used to authenticate connections to SMC. For the Gateway, you can name it, for example, Gateway Security Profile. For a development instance, you typically use database authentication, so you must specify the database type, for example, Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server. You also must specify the connection information, such as the location of database server, port for TNS Listener, and so on.\n\nTesting. Enter the credentials for SADMIN. These are the same credentials as those used when executing the grantusr.sql script. This password may be different than the one used during the installation of SAI.\n\nIf the test is successful, then SMC logs out, and prompts for login credentials. At this point, use the SADMIN credentials defined by the grantusr.sql script, and not those used during the installation of SAI.\n\nThe configuration wizard prompts you for service user credentials. These are the credentials under which the Gateway Service runs (either as a Windows Service or as a UNIX process).\n\nNote: For Windows-based systems, this should be a domain user who is also a local administrator.\n\nWhen you complete these steps, the Siebel Gateway service will be created, and the Siebel Deployment Hierarchy page opens.\n\nConfiguring the Siebel Enterprise\n\nThe Siebel Enterprise maintains environment-wide settings that are shared by all components, such as the location of the Siebel File System, the database, and so on.\n\nBefore continuing, it is important to understand that in the Siebel Management Console (SMC), a profile represents a template that provides the information needed for a given component. However, a profile is not an actual instance of that component. Using profiles allows us to deploy many instances of the same entity quickly, and repeatedly. You deploy the Enterprise only once, whereas a Siebel Server or Siebel Application Interface profile can be used many times.\n\nCreating the Enterprise Profile\n\nTo create the Siebel Enterprise profile, navigate the Siebel Management Console (SMC) to the Profiles/Enterprise node and create a new profile. For more information on each parameter, see Siebel Installation Guide for Microsoft Windows or Siebel Installation Guide for UNIX as appropriate.\n\nSome of the key parameters are as follows:\n\nProfile. A profile is a template for a component that can be deployed many times. To distinguish a profile from an instance of a component, it is recommended that profile name always includes the word: profile. For example, the Enterprise profile could be named EnterpriseProfile.\n\nPrimary Siebel File System. The Siebel File System will be used to store documents associated with Siebel CRM data, such as spreadsheets, word processing documents, presentations, images, and so on. This must be a network location that allows read-write access to all the servers on which Siebel Servers are eventually deployed. While the Enterprise creation requires only a single Siebel File System, it is possible to create multiple file systems to improve load-balancing and performance. For more information, see Siebel System Administration Guide in Siebel Bookshelf.\n\nAuthentication. The username and password for the Siebel Gateway.\n\nSecurity Encryption Level. Setting this to SISNAPI Using TLS 1.2 will cause inter-process communication amongst Siebel Enterprise Components to use TLS, improving security for these conversations. If this option is selected, it will be necessary to provide information about the Certificate Authority and other information needed to encrypt those conversations.\n\nDeploying the Enterprise Profile\n\nAfter successfully creating the Enterprise profile, deploy it as follows:\n\nNavigate the Siebel Management Console (SMC) to the Siebel Deployment Hierarchy and click the plus (+) icon to add an Enterprise to the deployment.\n\nSelect the profile you created.\n\nAssign a name to the Enterprise.\n\nA profile is a template, and the name provided here is only a named instance of that profile. The name of the Enterprise can be any alphanumeric string, but should be meaningful and easily identifiable, such as Development, or Test.\n\nSelect Deploy.\n\nIf you select Stage, then nothing will be deployed.\n\nWhen you submit the request, the SMC does the following:\n\nCreates the Siebel File System.\n\nCreates an ODBC source named {EnterpriseName}_DSN. This is used to communicate with the database, for example, Siebel_DSN.\n\nRefresh the Siebel Deployment Hierarchy page until the Enterprise shows as fully deployed.\n\nVerify that the File System and ODBC source were created:\n\nSiebel File System. You can verify that this was successful by inspecting the folder specified during the creation of the Profile. The Profile will show a set of folders that will be eventually used by the Siebel File System Manager.\n\nODBC Source. For Windows operating systems, validate that the ODBC source was created under the 32-bit ODBC Control Panel. For UNIX, check the contents of the .odbc.ini file in:\n\n/SIEBEL_HOME/ses/siebsrvr/sys\n\nFor example:\n\n[ENT1_DSN] Driver=/siebel/ses/siebsrvr/lib/SEor827.so ColumnSizeAsCharacter=1 ColumnsAsChar=1 ArraySize=160000 ServerName=SIEBELDB\n\nConfiguring Siebel Servers\n\nSiebel Servers are the application servers that provide the business logic layer for Siebel CRM. A Siebel Enterprise must include at least one Siebel Server, but in most cases, particularly for non-development instances, there is more than one Siebel Server.\n\nYou would deploy more than one Siebel Server for one of the following reasons:\n\nPerformance and Load Balancing. Siebel CRM is very scalable horizontally. Additional Siebel Servers allow more users to connect to the system, allow the execution of more background jobs, and so on.\n\nSpecialization. In addition to providing the business logic layer for active users, Siebel Servers run background jobs, such as large data import jobs or integration with other systems. To avoid these jobs interfering with the user experience, it is common to deploy more than one Siebel Server specifically for this reason.\n\nOperating System Dependence. Siebel CRM software runs equally well on Microsoft Windows and the various UNIX platforms on which it is certified. However, in some instances Microsoft Windows is specifically required. For example, Document Generation which interacts with Microsoft Word via Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) technology and Siebel Server Sync for Microsoft Exchange (SSSE), which relies on Windows Integrated Authentication to interact with Microsoft Exchange. It is not uncommon for a customer to run most of their Siebel Servers on a UNIX platform, and to use a few Microsoft Windows servers to support these specific use cases.\n\nCreating the Siebel Server Profile\n\nAs with all Profiles, the Siebel Server Profile is created in SMC: in this case, under the Profiles area, Siebel Servers node. Unlike the Enterprise Profile, it is possible, and in fact likely in a non-development environment, that you will create multiple Siebel Server profiles. The following example profiles illustrate possible examples how you might do this:\n\nSiebSrvrUIProfile. Supports end-user User Interface sessions.\n\nSiebSrvrWFProfile. Supports background workflow processes.\n\nSiebSrvrEIMProfile. Supports Enterprise Integration Manager processes for bulk data loads.\n\nSiebSrvrRESTProfile. Supports REST integration.\n\nDifferent profiles allow you to define specifically which application services are available on a given Siebel Server and, if needed, easily deploy an additional instance of that set of services onto additional servers for high availability and scalability.\n\nWhen determining how many profiles to create, you must consider the different possible ways that users and other systems interact with Siebel CRM. You can add more profiles and Siebel Servers at any time, and you can deploy and redeploy a Siebel Server quickly if needed.\n\nFor assistance determining number of profiles, servers and so on based on, customer requirements and expected usage, contact the Oracle Advanced Customer Support team (Expert Services).\n\nCreate the Siebel Server profile using the SMC as follows:\n\nFrom the Profiles/Siebel Servers node in SMC, create a new Profile record.\n\nSelect the Siebel Server Components that particular profile will support.\n\nAt a minimum, you must create a profile which includes the following sections:\n\nSiebel Web Tools. This is used for making configuration changes to the application.\n\nEach Component Group that includes the application that will be used. For example, if you plan to use Call Center, select the Siebel Call Center Component Group, if you plan to use Financial Services, select the Siebel Financial Services Component Group, and so on.\n\nEnterprise Application Integration (EAI). It is required to select this if you need access to the REST API.\n\nYou should also include any component group that contains a component that is used for the specific implementation, such as Siebel eDocuments, which is used for document generation on Windows servers only, and so on.\n\nNote: A Component Group typically contains many individual server components. For example, the Enterprise Application Interface Component Group contains more than ten server components, each of which automatically starts when the Siebel Server service starts. It is likely that only one or two of them is required. To conserve resources on the server, the unwanted components can be disabled using the Siebel Server Management utility. For more information, see Siebel System Administration Guide in Siebel Bookshelf.\n\nConfigure the Advanced Settings tab for load balancing and high availability.\n\nThese are typically not required for development environments, but can be used for other environments. For more information, see Siebel Installation Guide for Microsoft Windows or Siebel Installation Guide for UNIX as appropriate.\n\nDeploying the Siebel Server Profile\n\nAfter successfully creating the Siebel Server profile, deploy it by doing the following:\n\nIn the Siebel Management Console (SMC), navigate to the Siebel Deployment Hierarchy and click the plus (+) icon.\n\nSelect Siebel Server.\n\nEnter the following information:\n\nHost and Port. This the host where the Siebel Enterprise Servers (SES) components are installed and the HTTPS port number that was specified during that installation (for example, myserver.mycompany.com:9010).\n\nAction. If you are planning to deploy immediately, select Deploy.\n\nSiebel Server Name. It is recommended that you use the name of the physical host. For example, if your host is myserver.mycompany.com, then use myserver as the host. On rare occasions, you might deploy more than one Siebel Server per machine, for example, where Siebel Servers are clustered in Active-Active configuration for high availability. In this scenario, add an identifier to the server name to distinguish each from the other, for example, myserver_01, myserver_02, and so on.\n\nLanguages. These define all the languages this server supports. This selection is applicable to all Object Manager components, for example, user interface applications such as Call Center or Financial Services, and EAI integration components. However, this does not apply to components that are language-independent, such as Enterprise Integration Manager.\n\nWhen you submit the request, SMC does the following:\n\nCreates a Window Service or a UNIX daemon to host the selected components.\n\nLaunches Siebel CRM processes to host these components. You can view these processes in Windows Task Manager or the output of the ps utility on UNIX. All Siebel processes will match the pattern: sieb*.\n\nRefresh the Siebel Deployment Hierarchy page until the Siebel Server shows as fully deployed.\n\nThis might take several minutes. If deploying additional Siebel Servers to other machines using the same or different profile, you can deploy these profiles in parallel without waiting for earlier deployment(s) to complete.\n\nConfiguring the Siebel Application Interface\n\nThe Siebel Application Interface (SAI) provides the external interface to the Siebel CRM application. This includes user interface channels, such as employees, customers, and partners using browsers to interact with the application, as well as integration with other applications through REST or Web service calls. Normally a development instance requires a single SAI, but as with the Siebel Server, the Application Interface can be enabled on multiple servers to provide load balancing and high availability. For more information, see Siebel Installation Guide for Microsoft Windows or Siebel Installation Guide for UNIX as appropriate.\n\nThe key parameters of the SAI are those that are affect client interactivity, such as session timeouts.\n\nConsistent with the Enterprise and Siebel Servers, the SAI, configuration is completed in two parts:\n\nCreating or more SAI profiles. For many environments, it is likely that you only need one a single profile, even if you will have Application Interfaces running on multiple machines. You might consider creating multiple profiles for one of the following reasons:\n\nDiffering authentication. For example, using a different authentication authority for your internal users from that which you will use for your Internet users.\n\nIsolation. For example, to place Application Interfaces supporting customer-facing applications on one set of servers and employee-facing applications on another.\n\nDeploying the SAI profile as many times as required to support capacity requirements, high availability, isolation, and other technical and functional requirements.\n\nCreating the Siebel Application Interface Profile\n\nYou create the Siebel Application Interface (SAI) profile in the Siebel Management Console (SMC), under the Profiles area/Application Interfaces node. It is recommended that the profile name contains the word: profile. For example, SiebelAppIntProfile.\n\nAt least one Siebel Server with an EAI Object Manager must be deployed before you can create the first SAI profile. This is because the SAI profile requires selection of an existing EAI Object Manager.\n\nCreate the SAI profile using the SMC as follows:\n\nFrom the Profiles/Applications Interface node in SMC, create a new Profile record.\n\nProvide the requested information.\n\nThe following are important points to consider:\n\nBasic Information Tab: Enter the following information.\n\nHTTP 1.1-Compliant Firewall / Enable Web Compression. Set this to TRUE, unless there is a firewall that prevents HTTP 1.1 traffic.\n\nConfigure Fully Qualified Domain Name. If you have a single machine hosting an Application Interface, or are using a single entry point, for example a load balancer, set this parameter to TRUE. You must also specify the fully-qualified domain name, for example, myserver.company.com.\n\nAuthentication Information. Enter the relevant information for your environment.\n\nLogging. You can accept the default values. However, if you are debugging a problem, you can enter different values.\n\nREST Inbound Defaults. Select an EAI Object Manager, for example EAI Object Manager (ENU), and specify a base URL. This URL must include the name of a server where the Application Interface is running and includes the HTTPS port. For example, https://myserver.company.com:443/siebel/v1.0\n\nApplications Tab: Define the entry points that users use for connecting to Siebel CRM through the browser and that other applications use for integration. For each application that will be exposed, click the plus (+) icon and provide the following key information:\n\nApplication Name. This is the entry point that the user uses to navigate to Siebel CRM. For example, if the application name is callcenter, the user navigates to https://myserver.mycompany.com/siebel/app/callcenter/enu to reach the application.\n\nObject Manager. Select the object manager that maps to the Siebel CRM application, as defined in the runtime repository that will be mounted at this entry point. For example, for the Call Center application, select Call Center Object Manager (ENU).\n\nLanguage. Select the language that you want to expose. To expose a language, you need to have selected this language during the installation of both the Siebel Enterprise Server (SES) and SAI components, and also you need to have imported the language using the Database Configuration Wizard.\n\nREST Inbound Resources. For many environments, this field does not require configuration. For more information, see Siebel REST API Guide.\n\nOther Information. Accept the default parameters, unless you encounter specific instructions documented in Siebel Bookshelf to support your business requirements.\n\nDeploying the Siebel Application Interface\n\nAfter successfully creating the Siebel Application Interface (SAI) profile, deploy the profile by doing the following:\n\nNavigate the Siebel Management Console (SMC) to the Siebel Deployment Hierarchy and click the plus (+) icon.\n\nSelect Application Interface Server.\n\nEnter the following information:\n\nHost and Port. This the host where the SAI components are installed and the HTTPS port number that was specified during that installation (for example, myserver.mycompany.com:443).\n\nAction. If you are planning to deploy immediately, select Deploy.\n\nApplication Interface Node. It is recommended that you use the name of the physical host. For example, if your host is myserver.mycompany.com, then use myserver as the host.\n\nWhen you submit the request, the SMC instructs the SAI to expose an entry point into the Siebel CRM application for each application defined in the profile. For example: https://myserver.mycompany.com:443/siebel/app/callcenter/enu and https://myserver.mycompany.com:443/siebel/app/webtools/enu.\n\nUnlike other component types, you can make changes to the SAI profile that have already been deployed, and these changes take effect immediately without needing to redeploy.\n\nAdding the License Keys\n\nSiebel CRM requires you to activate valid license keys in the database. Without valid license keys, any attempt to connect causes the following browser error: The server you are trying to access is either busy or experiencing difficulties. Please close the Web browser, open a new browser window, and try logging in again.\n\nThe Object Manager log file in the siebsrvr\\log folder provides a more informative message for the administrator. For example in the SCCObjMgr_enu_XXXX_YYYYYYYY.log file:ObjMgrLicense Error 1 000000035a0b2200:0 2YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (dmlicmgr.cpp (308)) SBL-DAT-00172: No valid license keys were found in the database.\n\nTo add the license key, do the following:\n\nOn any server where the SES components are installed, navigate to the Siebel Server ..\\ses\\siebsrvr\\bin folder.\n\nRun the script licensekeymodule.bat (Windows) or licensekeymodule.sh (UNIX) script.\n\nEnter the following connection information:\n\nSiebel Server Location. The root of the siebsrvr folder. For example: C:\\Siebel\\ses\\siebsrvr\n\nODBC DSN. The ODBC source created by the deployment of the Enterprise Profile, which will be named enterprise_DSN where enterprise is the name of the Enterprise defined by the Profile. In this example, it is named siebel_DSN.\n\nTableowner / Username / Password. The database credentials specified when the grantusr.sql script was executed. This is usually SIEBEL, SADMIN, and the SADMIN password, respectively.\n\nDB Platform. Select one of the following: ORACLE, DB2UDB, DB2390, or MSSQL\n\nLog folder. This can be any valid path. This is usually the Siebel Server log folder, for example: C:\\Siebel\\ses\\siebsrvr\\log.\n\nSelect all the licensed modules.\n\nNote: Access to or possession of a license key, code, file, and so on, which unlocks or enables a software product is not a grant of entitlement. Your license agreement with Oracle provides the terms governing your use of Oracleâs products. Please ensure you are using the products in accordance with your license agreement.\n\nClick the Apply button and ensure that a success message is displayed.\n\nClose the license key module.\n\nAfter adding license keys, users can immediately to log into the system.\n\nEnsure that the SADMIN user can log into https://myserver.mycompany.com:<HTTPS Redirect Port>/siebel/app/callcenter/enu, (or whichever entry point is defined in the Siebel Application Interface Profile).\n\nSetting up the Developer Web Client\n\nAll administration activities can be performed using the browser-based user interface. However, it is sometimes convenient to have access to the Siebel CRM database using a Developer Web Client. This client does not rely on any of the Siebel Enterprise Server (SES) or Siebel Application Interface (SAI) components, but is a self-contained client with all the features of the browser client, with independent binaries.\n\nThis is convenient in the following situations:\n\nTroubleshooting server connectivity issues using the SAI.\n\nLogging in with a different authentication mechanism than is provided by the SAI. For example, logging in using database authentication when the SAI has been configured for a Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication mechanism.\n\nDebugging scripts, workflow processes, and Task-Based UI.\n\nThe Siebel Developer Client installation is similar to the Siebel Tools client installation; it is installed and configured in a single step. Much like Siebel Tools, it also requires the Oracle 32-bit client (even for customers using IBM DB2 or Microsoft SQL Server for their Siebel CRM Enterprise .database) and automatically installs an Oracle Express (Oracle XE) database as part of the installation process if you select the Sample Database option.\n\nTo install Siebel Developer Web Client, first install the base Innovation Pack release then the most recent Monthly Update (for example, 18.5). Monthly Updates are always cumulative. If there is more than one Update available, then you only need to install the latest.\n\nThe majority of the required information matches values specified during previous installation steps. You require the following new information:\n\nLanguages. While Siebel Tools can be used to configure all languages in the Repository, you must install the Siebel Developer Web Client for all languages that you plan to deploy in your Enterprise.\n\nType of Client. There are two types of clients available:\n\nSiebel Remote Client. This is used by end users to work in an offline mode. For more information, see Siebel Remote and Replication Manager Administration Guide.\n\nDeveloper Web Client. This is the recommended selection for administrative purposes.\n\nSearch Server Hostname and Port. Accept the defaults provided.\n\nHTTP Connection Port and Shutdown Port. These are used for test automation and other purposes. If you install the Developer Web Client on a different machine from SES and SAI, it is still recommended that these ports be unique to avoid any possible confusion. The defaults of 9001 and 9005 are acceptable unless already in use.\n\nWhen you finish installing the base release, ensure to perform the following tasks:\n\nInstall the most recent Monthly Update.\n\nVerify that Siebel Developer client connects to the Siebel CRM Enterprise database. You can do this by launching one of the shortcuts it created, for example Siebel Call Center, selecting the ServerDataSrc data source, and logging in using the SADMIN credentials."
