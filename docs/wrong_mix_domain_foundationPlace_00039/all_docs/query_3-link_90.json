        "text": "“Public agencies are looking for technology solutions that can lower costs while increasing their ability to handle rising workloads to deliver better and more effective services for the citizens they serve,” said David McCurley, Accenture’s global managing director for human services. “We are working with Oracle to address the rapidly rising public agency interest in commercial-off-the-shelf solutions as an alternative to more expensive custom-built software. This collaboration has resulted in our development agreement and the introduction of a new solution for child welfare case management.”\n\nThe Accenture Case Management Solution for Child Welfare on Oracle is a new, integrated case management solution designed to meet the specific requirements of child welfare agencies. The solution is based in part on Oracle’s Siebel CRM Public Sector Case Management commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product, Oracle’s Policy Automation rules engine and Accenture’s extensive experience developing child welfare solutions globally. It is expected to provide a foundation and structure for next-generation child welfare services in a manner consistent with the Accenture Public Service Platform.\n\nOracle plans to develop a Social Services Foundation Pack and Accenture plans to develop Oracle Application Integration Architecture Process Integration Packs to address disbursement and collections requirements. The project is expected to integrate Oracle’s Siebel Case Management with Oracle’s PeopleSoft Enterprise Financials systems for disbursements and embed Oracle Policy Automation for policy-based determination of eligibility.\n\nThe companies will work together using Oracle® Application Integration Architecture (AIA) to pre-build Process Integration Packs that use COTS software to provide public agencies with more effective and efficient technology solutions for social services. The benefits enabled by the social services collaboration include, but are not limited to:\n\nSupport for Workload Management and Caseworker Effectiveness\n\nImproved Client Services and Collaboration\n\nEnhanced Oversight and Outcome-Focused Program Delivery\n\n“Accenture is a global leader in the Social Services industry and we are extremely pleased to present a collaboration that is expected to bring next generation solutions that enable innovation, best practices, and proven software capabilities to the social services market,” said Kevin Curry, Application Sales Group vice president, Oracle Public Sector. “What we can deliver with our collective social services experience can raise the bar for transformed service delivery across child welfare organizations and other social services agencies that no longer appreciate the costly maintenance and difficult upgrade paths of custom built solutions.”\n\nAccenture and Oracle have teamed together for nearly 20 years. Accenture is an Oracle Platinum Partner and has one of the largest Oracle enterprise solutions practices among full-service integrators, with more than 44,495 Oracle-skilled professionals and more than 4,900 Oracle projects completed or underway.
