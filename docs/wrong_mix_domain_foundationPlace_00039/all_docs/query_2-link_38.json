The second part of the course introduces the concept of the Open UI “manifest” and how to administer it, then describes presentation models and physical renderers. The final lesson of the course describes the Siebel mobile interface in both connected and disconnected modes.\n\nLearn To:\n\nDescribe the Siebel Open UI architecture.\n\nIdentify the key file types involved in customizing the Siebel Open UI client.\n\nAdminister Siebel Open UI customizations.\n\nMake simple customizations in themes and cascading style sheets.\n\nMake simple customizations in Open UI desktop applications.\n\nBenefits to You\n\nBy taking this course, you’ll develop a deep understanding of the new Siebel Open UI framework and its benefits and features. You’ll walk away with a deeper understanding of the overall architecture so you can customize the Open UI Client through examples of customizing the manifest, the presentation model (how to apply client-side logic) and the physical renderer (how to change the way the data is presented to the users). You’ll also develop the skills to debug as needed.\n\nApply Styling\n\nThis course will walk you through the steps involved in changing the overall look and feel of the application using cascading style sheets, which are grouped into themes. Once themes are created, you can individually select the theme of your choosing.\n\nLearn Through Hands-On Exercises\n\nExpert Oracle instructors demonstrate how to use the new architecture through a series of examples. Please note this course does not teach JavaScript, CSS or HTML.
