The UN DESA defines its calculation method by counting \"population in all city districts meeting the criteria such as contiguous built-up areas, being the location of the local government, being a street or having a resident committee.\" In contrast, the National Bureau of Statistics of China normally counts all people living in the administrative units under the city in question as population of that city, even though some districts might be located in distant outskirts not closely connected to the city.\n\nThe selection of cities follows the definition of first and new first tier cities by Yicai Media Group.\n\nValues have been rounded.\n\nCitation formats"
