        "text": "Introduction\n\nPopulation ageing is a common phenomenon in the world.1 Globally, the number of the oldest-old persons (aged 80 years or over2 is projected to triple between 2019 and 2050, growing from 143 million to 426 million.1 In China, the number of the oldest-old persons will increase more than fourfold between 2019 and 2050, growing from 26.1 million to reach 115.3 million, projected by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations.3 Healthy ageing is an imperative strategy to deal with population ageing.\n\nHyperuricaemia is a metabolic disease due to the overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid (UA), a natural product generated from the purine metabolism.4 5 The burden of hyperuricaemia is substantial both in developing and developed countries. The 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that the prevalence of hyperuricaemia in the USA was 20.1%, approximately 47.13 million adults with hyperuricaemia.6 Data from the National Kidney Disease Surveillance Programme indicated that the prevalence of hyperuricaemia in the Irish was 24.5% in 2014, a pattern of increasing prevalence from 2006 to 2014.7 In the 2009–2010, China National Survey of Chronic Kidney Disease, the prevalence of hyperuricaemia was 8.4%, corresponding to a total of 92.9 million adults affected.8 Furthermore, the prevalence of hyperuricaemia increased with advancing age, and the highest prevalence was observed in the oldest-old persons.6 7\n\nThus, it is extremely significant to explore the prevalence of hyperuricaemia and associated factors in the oldest-old population. Although previous studies have reported that elevated serum UA (SUA) or hyperuricaemia is positively associated with atrial fibrillation,9 vascular inflammation,10 coronary artery disease,11 better muscle function12 in the oldest-old population, less evidence on the prevalence of hyperuricaemia among the oldest-old persons in China is known, with only one including 966 centenarians and 788 near-centenarians in the China Hainan Centenarian Cohort Study.13 Therefore, we conducted a community-based cross-sectional study to investigate the prevalence of hyperuricaemia among the oldest-old persons in Chengdu and identify associated factors to provide information on achieving healthy ageing in China.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy area\n\nChengdu is the capital city of Sichuan province, located at 30°05′—31°26′ N and 102°54′—104°53′ E. Chengdu is the fourth-largest city in China, the very centre of commerce, logistics, finance and science and technology, and the hub of transport and communication in Western China. The regional gross domestic product (GDP) of the city achieved 1701.265 billion in 2019, with an increase of 7.8%. The total resident population is more than 16 million in 2019, one of the most densely populated cities in China. Jinjiang, Qingyang, Longquanyi is located in the southeast, the northwest, and the east of Chengdu, respectively, which can be representative of the urban areas in Chengdu.\n\nParticipants\n\nAs described in detail previously,14 a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in urban areas of Chengdu, China, from September 2015 to June 2016. Survey participants were randomly recruited using a multistage stratified cluster sampling method.14 A representative sample of 1391 people aged over 80 years were enrolled from three districts: Jinjiang, Qingyang, Longquanyi (figure 1). A total of 145 participants were excluded due to unwillingness, severe neurological and psychological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, renal failure, end-stage cancer and severe frailty. This study consisted of three sections: a structured questionnaire, anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests. We excluded participants who had missing demographic information or fasting blood glucose, lipids and so on (n=65), and those whose SUA concentrations were missing (n=41). Subsequently, a total of 1285 participants were analysed in this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.\n\nData collection\n\nAs described in detail previously,14 data collection was completed by more than 20 trained medical staff in this study. Demographic factors (eg, age and sex), health-risky behaviours (eg, smoking and drinking) and personal medical history (eg, the doctor’s diagnosis or meditation of hypertension) were collected using a self-reported questionnaire. Anthropometric data, blood pressure, blood biomarkers were collected using the standard examination. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. Blood pressure was measured three times using standardised mercury sphygmomanometers. Using venous blood samples, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) were measured by oxidase method, and blood glucose was measured by glucose oxidase method, and UA was measured by the phosphotungstic acid method in the Clinical Laboratory Center of the Second People’s Hospital of Chengdu.\n\nVariable measure\n\nSmoking status and drinking status were clarified as ‘never’ or ‘former and current’. Due to changes in body composition with ageing, overweight was defined as BMI >27 kg/m2, acclaimed for the elderly (≥60 years).15 Hyperuricaemia was defined as SUA >420 µmol/L in men or SUA >360 µmol/L in women, according to Dietary guide for hyperuricaemia and gout patients (Chinese standard, WS/T 560–2017). Recent evidence suggested 5 mg/dL (333 µmol/L) was a more appropriate cut-off of SUA when investigating the negative impact of SUA on the cardiovascular system.16 For a comparison, hyperuricaemia was also defined as SUA>333 µmol/L (5.6 mg/dL) for both males and females. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg and (or) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg or the self-reported history or meditation of hypertension. Diabetes was defined as fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L and (or) oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 2-hour postload glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L or the self-reported history or meditation of diabetes. Dyslipidaemia was defined as TC ≥6.2 mmol/L, and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥4.1 mmol/L, and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <1.0 mmol/L, and/or TG ≥2.3 mmol/L, and/or the self-reported history or meditation of dyslipidaemia, based on the Chinese guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia in adults.17 History of kidney disease was defined as the self-reported of the doctor’s diagnosis of kidney disease, including glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, hypertensive nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, obstructive nephropathy, drug-induced nephropathy. A summary table was reported in online supplemental table 1.\n\nSupplemental material\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed while using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, V.23.0). Categorical variables, including sex, smoking, drinking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia and kidney disease, were presented as absolute numbers with the percentage, and Pearson’s χ2 test was used to detect the difference between the sexes. Except for age and TG, continuous variables, including BMI, SBP, DBP, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG), TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, SUA, were presented as means with the SD, and Student’s t test was used to detect the difference between the sexes. Age and TG were presented as medians with the IQR because of its skewed distribution, and the Wilcoxon’s rank sum test was used to detect the difference between the sexes. Besides, stratified by sex, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to detect the difference in SUA level between the age bands, and the Cochran-Armitage test was used to test the trend in hyperuricaemia prevalence between the age bands. A univariable logistic regression model and a multivariable logistic regression model were used to estimate the ORs and 95% CI to explore the associated risk factors of hyperuricaemia, using a forward-stepwise selection method (likelihood ratio) to specify how independent variables are entered into the model. Values of p<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\nPatient and public involvement\n\nNo patient involved.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this representative sample of the community-based population in Chengdu, we observed a substantial burden of hyperuricaemia in the urban oldest-old. Specifically, the overall prevalence of hyperuricaemia was 29.6%. There was no significant sex difference in the prevalence of hyperuricaemia, 29.1% in men vs 30.0% in women. Using a recently proposed cut-off of SUA, identified as that above which cardiovascular mortality significantly,16 the prevalence of hyperuricaemia among the urban oldest-old population was 50.4%. Multivariable analyses found that hyperlipidaemia and overweight were associated with the risk of hyperuricaemia in the oldest-old population, regardless of sex. Furthermore, there was a significant association between diabetes mellitus and hyperuricaemia only in women, but not in men.\n\nIn this study, our estimated prevalence of hyperuricaemia among the oldest-old is approximate to the Chinese centenarians and near-centenarians (29.02%)13, remarkably more than that from adults aged 18 years and older in the 2009–2010 China National Survey of Chronic Kidney Disease (8.4%).8 It has been reported that the prevalence of hyperuricaemia is highest in the oldest-old population, 27.8% in the USA,6 43.0% in the Irish.7 Differences in the prevalence of hyperuricaemia among the oldest-old may be accounted for the race, region, dietary habits.6 7 13 Higher Seafood consumption, higher meat consumption and lower vegetable consumption were significantly associated with the increasing risk of hyperuricaemia among the centenarians and near-centenarians.13\n\nOf note, the prevalence of hyperuricaemia defined by a recently proposed cut-off of SUA (5.6 mg/dL) was 70.3% higher than that in the classic definition (7.0 mg/dL in men and 6.0 mg/dL in women), consistent with a previous study.18 A 5.6 mg/dL was identified as a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality among Italians,16 more multicentre and multiethnic prospective studies are needed to prove external validity in health outcomes.\n\nPrevious studies have shown the higher prevalence of hyperuricaemia among adults in men than in women.8 19–21 However, our study indicated no difference in the prevalence of hyperuricaemia among the oldest-old between men and women. Young women adults with a lower prevalence of hyperuricaemia can be explained by the uricosuric effects of oestrogen.22–24 Following menopause, the prevalence of hyperuricaemia rose sharply in older women.7 22 23 The effect of oestrogen disappeared in the oldest-old women, which may account for no sex difference in the prevalence of hyperuricaemia.\n\nOur findings appear in agreement with a previous study in China, where the positive association between high TG and hyperuricaemia among the oldest-old was observed in both men and women.25 Moreover, overweight was positively associated with the prevalence of hyperuricaemia in the oldest-old, consistent with a study among long-lived Chinese subjects aged 90 years and older, indicating that higher levels of SUA may be positively associated with higher BMI.26 Besides, diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased prevalence of hyperuricaemia only in women. Nevertheless, evidence from observational studies can be biased by potential confounding factors and reverse causality. Thus, high-quality studies such as Mendelian randomisation studies should be carried out to confirm whether there is a causal association between cardiovascular disease risk factors and hyperuricaemia in the oldest-old population.\n\nOur studies have several limitations. First, the definition of hyperuricaemia merely relied on the concentration of SUA. Medication information (eg, diuretic)27 that may affect the level of SUA was not available, which can cause the estimated prevalence of hyperuricaemia subject to error. Second, potential confounding factors such as dietary intakes were not included. Third, kidney disease was defined by a self-reported history, rather than estimated glomerular filtration rate, which might cause a false-negative result.28 Moreover, all participants were recruited from the urban oldest-old population, so the results may not be generalisable to the rural oldest-old population. Finally, the association observed in this study resulted from a cross-sectional study, which may suffer from potential biases and reverse causality. Thus, more prospective studies or Mendelian Randomisation studies are needed to determine causality. Notably, this is the first comprehensive study that accurately evaluated the prevalence of hyperuricaemia among the oldest-old persons in Southwestern China, and identified factors associated with hyperuricaemia.\n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated that the burden of hyperuricaemia is substantial among the oldest-old population in the urban areas of Chengdu, China. Hyperlipidaemia and overweight are associated with the increasing prevalence of hyperuricaemia in both sexes, but the association between diabetes mellitus and hyperuricaemia is observed only in women. Further studies should be carried out to confirm the causal association."
