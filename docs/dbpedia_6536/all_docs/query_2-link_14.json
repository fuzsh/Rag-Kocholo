        "text": "Chengdu (Standard Mandarin: [ʈʂʰə̌ŋ.tú] (listen)), formerly romanized as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of Sichuan province, People's Republic of China. It is one of the three most populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the 5th-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is also considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\n\nThe surrounding Chengdu Plain is also known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: 天府之国; pinyin: Tiānfǔ zhi Guó) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. Founded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name (nearly) unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages.[citation needed] It is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air Chinaand Sichuan Airlines is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates. More than 260 Fortune 500companies have established branches in Chengdu.\n\nContents[]\n\n1Name\n\n2Logo\n\n3History\n\n3.1Early history\n\n3.2Imperial era\n\n3.3Modern era\n\n4Geography\n\n4.1Climate\n\n4.2Administrative divisions\n\n5Cityscape\n\n5.1Ancient fortress wall\n\n6Demography\n\n7Culture\n\n7.1Literature\n\n7.2Fine art\n\n7.3Religion\n\n7.4Education\n\n7.5Theatre\n\n7.6Language\n\n7.7Culinary art and tea culture\n\n7.8Teahouse\n\n7.9Hot Pot\n\n7.10Mahjong\n\n7.11Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le\n\n7.12Customs and festivals\n\n7.12.1Grand Temple Fair\n\n7.12.2Lantern Festival\n\n7.12.3Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival\n\n7.12.4Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival\n\n7.12.5South China Snow and Ice Festival\n\n8Home of the giant panda\n\n9Main sights\n\n9.1World natural and cultural heritage sites\n\n9.1.1Mount Qingcheng\n\n9.1.2Dujiangyan Irrigation System\n\n9.1.3Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries\n\n9.2Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms\n\n9.2.1Wuhou Shrine\n\n9.2.2Du Fu thatched cottage\n\n9.3Ancient Shu civilization\n\n9.3.1Jinsha Ruins\n\n9.3.2Golden Sun Bird\n\n9.3.3Sanxingdui Museum\n\n9.4Buddhist and Taoist cultures\n\n9.4.1Chengdu Daci Monastery\n\n9.4.2Wenshu Monastery\n\n9.4.3Baoguang Monastery\n\n9.4.4Qingyang Taoist Temple\n\n9.5Featured streets and historic towns\n\n9.5.1The Wide and Narrow Lanes\n\n9.5.2Jinli\n\n9.5.3Huanglongxi Historic Town\n\n9.5.4Chunxi Road\n\n9.5.5Anren Historic Town\n\n9.5.6Luodai Historic Town\n\n9.5.7Du Fu Thatched Cottage\n\n10Economy\n\n10.1Electronics and IT industries\n\n10.2Financial industry\n\n10.3Modern logistic industry\n\n10.4Modern business and trade\n\n10.5Convention and exhibition industry\n\n10.6Software and service outsourcing industry\n\n10.7New energy industry\n\n10.8Electronics and information industry\n\n10.9Automobile industry\n\n10.10Modern agriculture\n\n10.11Defense industry\n\n10.12Investment\n\n10.13Industrial zones\n\n10.14Real estate\n\n11Transport\n\n11.1Air\n\n11.2Railway\n\n11.3Metropolitan expressways\n\n11.4Coach\n\n11.5Highways\n\n11.6Chengdu Metro\n\n11.7Bus\n\n11.8River transport\n\n12Education\n\n12.1Colleges and universities\n\n12.2International schools\n\n12.3Major secondary schools\n\n13Consulates\n\n14Sports\n\n14.1Football\n\n14.2Tennis\n\n14.3Multi-sport events\n\n14.4Major sports venues\n\n15International Relations\n\n16See also\n\n17Notes\n\n18References\n\n18.1Citations\n\n18.2Bibliography\n\n19Further reading\n\n20External links\n\nName[]\n\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to shortly after its founding. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communisteras,[8] although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as Xijing in the 17th century. The Song-era geographical work A Universal Geography of the Taiping Era states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng 成 may mean \"turned into\" while du 都 can mean either a metropolis or a capital.) There are, however, several versions of why the capital had been moved from nearby Pi County and modern scholars sometimes theorize that the name was a transcription of an earlier name into Chinese characters.\n\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings Sindafu, Sin-din-fu, &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization Ching-too Foo.\n\nAlthough the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including Yizhou (益州). Chinese nicknames for the city include the Turtle City, variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the Brocade City, a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the Hibiscus City, from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\nLogo[]\n\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient artifact unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly history[]\n\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which—following its partial sinification—became known to the Chinese as Shu.[16][17] In the early 4th century bc, the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty relocated from nearby Pi County, giving his new capital the name Chengdu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 bc and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\nImperial era[]\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (錦官; jǐnguān) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou.[b] Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\n\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\n\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (大蜀, Dàshǔ). The Mongols sacked Chengdu in 1279 with a general slaughter that Horner estimated at over a million.[18] During their Yuan dynasty, Marco Polo visited Chengdu[11][19] and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.\n\nAt the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (大西) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646.[9] Zhang was said to have massacred large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan. In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers[20] and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco. Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\nModern era[]\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.[21][22]\n\nDuring World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\n\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was out of reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu.[23] The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.[24][25]\n\nHowever, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor.[26] One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands.[29] The Operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area.[30][31] Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.[33][34]\n\nThe industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\n\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\n\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade.[when?] The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.[35]\n\nGeography[edit][]\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\n\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\n\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30° 05' to 31° 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102° 54' to 104° 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (龙泉山脉) and the Penzhong Hills (盆中丘陵); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\nClimate[edit][]\n\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 °C (42.1 °F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all which lie in the Yangtze basin.[36] The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 °C (77 °F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 °C (91 °F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is typically interminably grey and dreary, compounding the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March–April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October–November). The annual mean is 16.27 °C (61.3 °F), and extremes have ranged from −4.6 °C (24 °F) to 37.5 °C (99.5 °F).\n\nCityscape[edit][]\n\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\nAncient fortress wall[]\n\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\n\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\nDemography[]\n\nHistorical population Year Pop. ±% 1953 857,000 — 1964 1,583,000 +84.7% 1970 6,922,918 +337.3% 1975 7,819,732 +13.0% 1980 8,225,399 +5.2% 1985 8,626,770 +4.9% 1990 9,195,004 +6.6% 1995 9,715,977 +5.7% 2000 10,392,531 +7.0% 2005 10,820,285 +4.1% 2010 14,047,625 +29.8% Population size may be affected by changes on administrative divisions.\n\nThe municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants at the 2010 census whom 8,311,752 in the city considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.[44]\n\nThe encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million\n\nCulture[]\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's 4th-most-livable city.\n\nLiterature[]\n\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Han dynasty; Li Bai and Su Shi, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\nFine art[]\n\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting schoolwith other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\nReligion[]\n\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n\n10/15/1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\n\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 - 1888. On May 9, 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\n\nOn June 24, 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened November 3, 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The Mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later raized by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The Mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later Missionaries would relocate and expand the Boy's and Girl's Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).[49]\n\nThe Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid 80's.\n\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. […] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with “inciting subversion of state power”, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\nEducation[]\n\nWen Weng, administer of Chengdu during the Han dynasty, established the first local public school now named Shishi (literally a stone house) in the world. The school site has not changed for more than 2,000 years, which remains the site of today's Shishi High School.\n\nTheatre[]\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period.[clarification needed] The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\nLanguage[]\n\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (成都话/成都方言) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\nCulinary art and tea culture[]\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article[55] by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\n\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\n\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\nTeahouse[]\n\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\nHot Pot[]\n\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\nMahjong[]\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives.

The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.\n\nA breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\n\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869.

Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\n\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\n\nIn 2008, after the release of the American animation movie Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and other DreamWorks members visited the city of Chengdu. In addition to seeing live pandas, crew members learned about the local culture. Katzenberg has stated that Kung Fu Panda 2 incorporates many elements of Chengdu in the film. The film's landscape and architecture also found inspiration from those found at Mount Qingcheng, a renowned Taoist mountain. In an interview with Movieline, Berger stated that ‘we never really thought of this as a movie set in China for Americans; it's a movie set in a mythical, universalized China for everyone in the world'.\n\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu.

The objective is to increase passenger traffic to more than 40 million by 2015, making Chengdu Airport the fourth-largest international hub in China, after Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, top 30 largest airports in the world.[72][73] Chengdu has already begun building a second international airport, the Chengdu Tianfu International Airport, which will have six runways and a capacity to handle between 80 and 90 million passengers per year.\n\nRailway[]\n\nChengdu is the primary railway hub city and rail administrative center in southwestern China. The Chengdu Railway Bureau manages the railway system of Sichuan Province, Chongqing City, Guizhou Province and Yunnan Province. Chengdu has four main freight railway stations. Among them, the Chengdu North Marshalling Station is one of the largest marshalling stations in Asia.

There will also be a road that connects Longquan Town to Longquan Lake; it is connected to the Chengdu–Jianyang Expressway and hence shorten the journey by 10 km (6.2 mi). By the end of 2008, there are ten expressways, connecting the centre of Chengdu to its suburbs. The expressways are Chenglin Expressway, extensions of Guanghua Avenue, Shawan Line, and an expressway from Chengdu to Heilongtan.\n\nThe toll-free Chengjin Expressway in the east of Chengdu is 38.7 km (24.0 mi) long. After it opens to the public, it will take only about half an hour to drive from central Chengdu to Jintang, half the time of the current journey.\n\nThe expressway between Chengdu to Heilongtan (Chengdu section), going to the south of the city, is 42 km (26 mi) long.

Bus cards are available that permit free bus changes for three hours.\n\nRiver transport[]\n\nHistorically, the Jin River was used for boat traffic in and out of Chengdu. However, due to the size of the river itself and the reduced water depth over time, the Brocade River is no longer capable of carrying any type of water traffic. Therefore, Chengdu has no direct access to the Yangtze River or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, inland port cities of Yibin and Luzhou—both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways—on the Yangtze have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development. As materials and equipment for the rebuilding of northern Sichuan are sent in from the East Coast to Sichuan, these ports will see significant increases in throughput.\n\nEducation[]\n\nChengdu is home to the greatest number of universities and research institutes in Southwestern China.
