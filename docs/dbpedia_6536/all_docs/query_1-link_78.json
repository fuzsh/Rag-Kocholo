        "text": "Check out these downloadable population density maps of China!\n\nAs of 2020, there are a total of 1.4 billion people in China. That’s a lot of people to fit into one country!\n\nIf you’re searching around for some good China population density maps, you’ve landed in the right place. I’ve curated a collection of the best maps I can find that give a visual representation of this massive China population.\n\nChina Population Density Maps\n\nBelow is a collection of various maps giving a visual representation of just how many people live in China.\n\nThe above population density map of China shows a fluid representation of the density within the country without regard for political division.\n\nThis map breaks down China’s population density by region and province.\n\nOf course, this might be hard to visualize in the context of the rest of Asia or the world. That’s where these comparison maps come in handy.\n\nComparing China’s Population Density\n\nWhen you zoom out and view China’s population density in relation to the rest of Asia, it becomes very interesting.\n\nWhen it comes to population numbers, China and India beat out any other part or the world.\n\nBut how do China’s different administrative regions compare with other countries in the world? This next map by MapsbyNick shows various countries in the world with a similar population to that province.\n\nFinally, this next population density maps puts it all into perspective. How does China’s population density look within the context of the entire globe?\n\nAs you can see, these maps of China tell an interesting story, not just from a micro level (within the country) but also on a more macro level (in contrast to the rest of the world).\n\nChina’s population has boomed over the past century, but what makes it so interesting is how the people of China have congregated in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and many others. Even “small” cities in China have millions of inhabitants!"
