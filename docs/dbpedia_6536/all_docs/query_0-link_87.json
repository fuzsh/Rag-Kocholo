        "text": "It has been claimed that smart growth would reduce housing costs. A $13,000 (2007$) decline in new residential unit costs was predicted for 2000 to 2025 in Costs of Sprawl --- 2000, for markets with smart growth (prescriptive planning) compared to responsive planning systems. At this rate, a reduction of nearly $4,000 would have occurred between 2000 and 2007. The reality was starkly different. In just seven years, median house prices rose more than $160,000 in prescriptive planning areas relative to prices in markets with responsive planning.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA'S EFFICIENT TOWNSHIP GOVERNMENT\n\nStudy Shows Smaller Governments Have Far Lower Costs per Capita\n\nIn this report commissioned by the Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors, Demographia shows that the Commonwealth's smaller local governments have by far the lowest costs per capita, even when attributable spending is added and spending financed by state and federal sources is subtracted. This conclusion is in opposition to the \"conventional wisdom,\" which is that larger governments are more efficient. In fact, the only \"economies of scale\" in larger governments are for special interest, which are able to exert control over larger government organizations with less effort and expenditure than would be necessary to control a myriad of smaller local governments. At the same time, smaller local governments are more effective because they are \"closer to the people.\"\n\nNEW YORK'S EFFICIENT TOWN GOVERNMENT\n\nStudy Shows Smaller Governments Have Far Lower Costs per Capita\n\nIn this report commissioned by the Association of Towns Of New York, Demographia shows that the Commonwealth's smaller local governments have by far the lowest costs per capita, even when attributable spending is added and spending financed by state and federal sources is subtracted. This conclusion is in opposition to the \"conventional wisdom,\" which is that larger governments are more efficient. In fact, the only \"economies of scale\" in larger governments are for special interest, which are able to exert control over larger government organizations with less effort and expenditure than would be necessary to control a myriad of smaller local governments. At the same time, smaller local governments are more effective because they are \"closer to the people.\"\n\nTHE HEAVY PRICE OF SMART GROWTH AND URBAN CONSOLIDATION\n\nSome economic analysts have attempted to blame the housing affordability crisis on demand or low interest rates. The reality, however, is that some of the most affordable housing markets (examples are Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston) also have the highest demand. The same low interest rates have been available both in the unaffordable and the affordable markets and cannot therefore be the cause of the housing affordability crisis. This Second Annual Demographia Housing Affordability Survey provdes a detailed examination of the issues behind the present structural and spotty housing affordability crisis.\n\nBLUEPRINT 2030: MOBILITY AND ACCESS FOR ATLANTA\n\nTraffic Congestion Can be Reduced: The First Step is to Try\n\nIn this report, Wendell Cox and Alan Pisarski show that Atlanta's intense traffic congestion, unusual for a low density urban area, is principally the cause of underinvestment in suburban roadways. Rejecting, the \"maternity wards increase the birthrate\" logic of \" d demand,\" they show how the Atlanta area can improve its traffic flow, saving people time and improving economic efficiency. While the casual visitor to Atlanta may think the urban area well served by wide freeways, coverage of the urban area is sparse. In fact, Atlanta has the greatest extent of suburbanization in the world unserved by cross-town (lateral) freeways. Further, the area has a substandard arterial (non-freeway) road system. Nonetheless, significant improvements can be made with expenditures that are well within the capability of the local economy. Atlanta's continued growth could well depend upon it.\n\nAMERICAN DREAM THREATENED: BLACKS, HISPANICS AT GREATEST RISK\n\nGrowing Smart: Planners Would Confiscate Homes Not Consistent with Their Plans\n\nThe American Plannning Association has developed a legislative guidebook containing model legislation which, if enacted would increase the price of housing, with the impact falling most heavily on lower income households, which are disproportionately African-American or Hispanic. Other provisions could force confiscation of houses where subsequent zoning changes render a use non-conforming. The model legislation is based upon the planning doctrine of smart growth, which like a previous planning doctrine, urban renewal, will make urban areas less attractive places to live.\n\nSMART GROWTH: DELUSION, NOT VISION\n\nWendell Cox Closing Statement at Railvolution Conference\n\nOn December 1, Wendell Cox and Congressman Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon) debated smart growth and transit at the annual Railvolution conference in San Francisco. Wendell Cox's closing statement is reproduced here.\n\nBADGE OF HONOR\n\nWendell Cox Placed on Sprawlwatch List\n\nWendell Cox and others are highlighted as opponents of the anti-sprawl movement. Cox stated that placement on the list was a \"badge of honor.\" but that Sprawlwatch would have more correctly characterized those on the list as \"pro-choice\" with respect to urban development --- that people should have the freedom to live and work where they like.\n\nWENDELL COX OPED IN THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION\n\nPortland Not Sprawl Free: Atlanta Needs Other Policies\n\nDespite Atlanta's reputation for severe traffic congestion and low densities, Wendell Cox shows that the Atlanta area scores generally better on measures of transit use than Portland, which has gained an international reputation for policies intended to increase transit ridership and urban density. His conclusion is that Portland's policies would not solve Atlanta's traffic problems any more than they have Portland's.\n\nWENDELL COX OPED IN THE WASHINGTON TIMES\n\nA Straitjacket on Growth\n\nNew urbanist and so-called \"smart growth\" policies promise to slow economic growth where implemented and could limit job creation and business expansion. Limitations on new \"big-box\" retailers is likely to limit job growth in construction trades and related industries. The telecommunications revolution and the expansion of regional jet service could erode the competitiveness of larger metropolitan areas, in combination with new urbanist and so-called \"smart growth\" initiatives. Smaller metropolitan areas are likely to benefit, as they welcome the growth turned away by metropolitan areas like Portland, Oregon.\n\nRESPONSE TO REPORT BY DAVID RUSK\n\nKeeping Kalamazoo Competitive: The Husock Report\n\nThis report by Howard Husock of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and Wendell Cox challenges the findings of the Kalamazoo County Compact by David Rusk and recommends competition based measures to improve the competitiveness of Kalamazoo.\n\nLatest News and Analysis\n\nURBAN CONSOLIDATION & SMART GROWTH: DESTROYING THE UNIVERSAL DREAM\n\nHow U.S. Land Use Regulation Exacerbated the International Financial Crisis: Heritage Foundation\n\nHow Smart Growth Exacerbated the International Financial Crisis: Report (20080428)\n\nUSA Housing Affordability & Net Domestic Migration\n\nTelevision New Zealand Interview: \"Spotlight on \"NZ's Housing Crisis\": Hugh Pavletich\n\nSmart Growth & Housing Affordability: 8 Market Analsis: ATL DFW IPS KC BOS POR SD WDC\n\nSydney & Dallas-Fort Worth: Starter House Cost Comparison\n\nAustralia Joint Housing & Development Industries Statement: Land Release, Fees, Process the Problem\n\nSmart Growth Raises Prices: NZ Government Report | New Zealand Housing Affordability Overview\n\nDemographia Submission to the NZ Housing Affordability Parliamentary Inquiry\n\nAustralia: Prime Minister, Treasurer, Reserve Bank Governor Cite Urban Consolidation (Smart Growth) Land Rationing\n\nThe Great Australian Dream Project | Boulevard of Broken Dreams: AFFORDABLEHOME.com.au\n\nNZ Report: Affordability Loss: Not Enough Land | NATIONAL/ INTERNATIONAL\n\nREPORTS\n\nNEWS\n\nCOMMENTARY Urban Planning and Economics: Research\n\nHow Planning is Destroying Housing Affordability: International Library\n\nUrban Consolidation & Smart Growth: Destroying the Great Australian Dream\n\nUrban Consolidation & Smart Growth: Destroying the Kiwi Dream\n\nSmart Growth & Regional Planning: Destroying the American Dream\n\nSmart Growth & Regional Planning: Destroying the Canadian Dream\n\nTown Planning: Destroying Housing Affordability in the UK\n\nTown Planning: Destroying Housing Affordability in Ireland\n\nPerformance Urban Planning Website"
