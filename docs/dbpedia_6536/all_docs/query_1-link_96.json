        "meta_description": "Abstract. Located in the mountainous area of southwest China, the\nChengduâChongqing urban agglomeration (CCUA) has been rapidly urbanized in the\nlast 4 decades, which has led to a 3-fold urban area expansion, thereby\naffecting the weather and climate. To investigate the urbanization effects\non the thermal environment in the CCUA under complex terrain, we\nconducted simulations using the advanced Weather Research and\nForecasting (WRF V4.1.5) model together with combined land use\nscenarios and terrain conditions. We observed that the WRF model reproduces\nthe general synoptic summer weather pattern, particularly for the thermal\nenvironment. It was shown that the expansion of the urban area changed the\nunderlying surface's thermal properties, leading to the urban heat island\neffect, enhanced further by the complex terrain. The simulation with the\nfuture scenario shows that the implementation of idealized measures\nincluding returning farmland to forests and expanding rivers and lakes can\nreduce the urban heat island effect and regulate the urban ecosystem.\nTherefore, urban planning policy has the potential to provide feasible\nsuggestions to best manage the thermal environment of the future city toward\nimproving the livelihood of the people in the environment.",

The results suggested that DOC transport in most rivers was mainly influenced by reservoir interception and surface water withdrawal. The impact of human water regulation on riverine DOC exports grew year by year. In general, this study developed an effective scheme to simulate DOC exports from terrestrial to aquatic systems, which is important for estimating global carbon budgets.\n\nOptimal water use strategies for mitigating high urban temperatures\n\nBin Liu, Zhenghui Xie, Shuang Liu, Yujing Zeng, Ruichao Li, Longhuan Wang, Yan Wang, Binghao Jia, Peihua Qin, Si Chen, Jinbo Xie, and ChunXiang Shi\n\nHydrol.

We use a set of model simulation that realistically simulate QBO and a novel ozone diagnostic tool to separate the temperature and circulation-driven QBO impact. These are important for diagnosing model-model differences in the QBO-ozone responses for climate projections.\n\nImpacts of anthropogenic water regulation on global riverine dissolved organic carbon transport\n\nYanbin You, Zhenghui Xie, Binghao Jia, Yan Wang, Longhuan Wang, Ruichao Li, Heng Yan, Yuhang Tian, and Si Chen\n\nEarth Syst.

Dynam., 8, 113–127, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-113-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-113-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIrrigation constitutes 70 % of human water consumption. In this study, using the improved CLM4.5 with an active crop model, two 1 km simulations investigating the effects of irrigation on latent heat, sensible heat, and carbon fluxes in the Heihe River basin in northwestern China were conducted using a high-quality irrigation dataset compiled from 1981 to 2013. The results revealed the key role of irrigation in the control of land–atmosphere water, energy, and carbon fluxes in semiarid basin.\n\nLS3MIP (v1.0) contribution to CMIP6: the Land Surface, Snow and Soil moisture Model Intercomparison Project â aims, setup and expected outcome\n\nBart van den Hurk, Hyungjun Kim, Gerhard Krinner, Sonia I.

To quantify this effect for intensity and range, a streamâriverbank scheme was incorporated into a state-of-the-art land model, and some runs were set up over Heihe River basin, northwestern China. The results show that the hydrology circle is significantly changed, and the ecological system is benefitted greatly by the river water lateral transfer within a 1 km range to the stream.\n\nEvaluation of a multi-satellite soil moisture product and the Community Land Model 4.5 simulation in China\n\nB.

CLM4.5 produces better temporal variation of surface soil moisture; ECV-SM has a low bias, but shows a weak correlation; ECV-SM is more likely to be superior in semi-arid regions.\n\nA joint data assimilation system (Tan-Tracker) to simultaneously estimate surface CO2 fluxes and 3-D atmospheric CO2 concentrations from observations\n\nX. Tian, Z. Xie, Y. Liu, Z. Cai, Y. Fu, H. Zhang, and L. Feng\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 14, 13281–13293, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-13281-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-13281-2014, 2014\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new carbon cycle data assimilation system (Tan-Tracker) is developed based on an advanced hybrid assimilation approach, as a part of the preparation for the launch of the Chinese carbon dioxide observation satellite (TanSat). Tan-Tracker adopts a joint data assimilation framework to simultaneously estimate CO2 concentrations and CFs and thus gradually reduce the uncertainty in the CO2 concentration evolution through continuously fitting model CO2 concentration simulations to the observations.\n\nImproving simulation of soil moisture in China using a multiple meteorological forcing ensemble approach\n\nJ.-G.

MacDougall, Jan Nitzbon, Jian Peng, Karina von Schuckmann, Sonia I. Seneviratne, Wim Thiery, Inne Vanderkelen, and Tonghua Wu\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 609–627, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-609-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-609-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change is caused by the accumulated heat in the Earth system, with the land storing the second largest amount of this extra heat. Here, new estimates of continental heat storage are obtained, including changes in inland-water heat storage and permafrost heat storage in addition to changes in ground heat storage. We also argue that heat gains in all three components should be monitored independently of their magnitude due to heat-dependent processes affecting society and ecosystems.\n\nThe rate of information transfer as a measure of oceanâatmosphere interactions\n\nDavid Docquier, StÃ©phane Vannitsem, and Alessio Bellucci\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 577–591, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-577-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-577-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe climate system is strongly regulated by interactions between the ocean and atmosphere. However, many uncertainties remain in the understanding of these interactions. Our analysis uses a relatively novel approach to quantify causal links between the ocean surface and lower atmosphere based on satellite observations. We find that both the ocean and atmosphere influence each other but with varying intensity depending on the region, demonstrating the power of causal methods.\n\nEvaluation of global teleconnections in CMIP6 climate projections using complex networks\n\nClementine Dalelane, Kristina Winderlich, and Andreas Walter\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 17–37, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-17-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-17-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe realistic representation of global teleconnections is an indispensable requirement for the reliable simulation of low-frequency climate variability and climate change. We present an application of the complex network framework to quantify and evaluate large-scale interactions within and between ocean and atmosphere in 22 historical CMIP6 climate projections with respect to two century-long reanalyses.\n\nOn the additivity of climate responses to the volcanic and solar forcing in the early 19thÂ century\n\nShih-Wei Fang, Claudia Timmreck, Johann Jungclaus, Kirstin KrÃ¼ger, and Hauke Schmidt\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1535–1555, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1535-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1535-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe early 19th century was the coldest period over the past 500 years, when strong tropical volcanic events and a solar minimum coincided. This study quantifies potential surface cooling from the solar and volcanic forcing in the early 19th century with large ensemble simulations, and identifies the regions that their impacts cannot be simply additive. The cooling perspective of Arctic amplification exists in both solar and post-volcano period with the albedo feedback as the main contribution.\n\nExploring the relationship between temperature forecast errors and Earth system variables\n\nMelissa Ruiz-VÃ¡squez, Sungmin O, Alexander Brenning, Randal D. Koster, Gianpaolo Balsamo, Ulrich Weber, Gabriele Arduini, Ana Bastos, Markus Reichstein, and RenÃ© Orth\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1451–1471, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1451-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1451-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSubseasonal forecasts facilitate early warning of extreme events; however their predictability sources are not fully explored. We find that global temperature forecast errors in many regions are related to climate variables such as solar radiation and precipitation, as well as land surface variables such as soil moisture and evaporative fraction. A better representation of these variables in the forecasting and data assimilation systems can support the accuracy of temperature forecasts.\n\nTrends and uncertainties of mass-driven sea-level change in the satellite altimetry era\n\nCarolina M. L. Camargo, Riccardo E. M. Riva, Tim H. J. Hermans, and AimÃ©e B. A. Slangen\n\nEarth Syst.

Here, we characterize the regional trends within these sea-level contributions, taking into account mass variations since 1993. We take a comprehensive approach to determining the uncertainties of these sea-level changes, considering different types of errors. Our study reveals the importance of clearly quantifying the uncertainties of sea-level change trends.\n\nThe biogeophysical effects of idealized land cover and land management changes in Earth system models\n\nSteven J.

We investigate the climate effects of cropland expansion, afforestation, irrigation, and wood harvesting using three Earth system models. Results show that these have important implications for surface temperature where the land cover and/or management change occurs and in remote areas. Idealized afforestation causes global warming, which might offset the cooling effect from enhanced carbon uptake.\n\nDynamic regimes of the Greenland Ice Sheet emerging from interacting meltâelevation and glacial isostatic adjustment feedbacks\n\nMaria Zeitz, Jan M. Haacker, Jonathan F. Donges, Torsten Albrecht, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nEarth Syst.

Here, using PISM, we study how the interplay of feedbacks between the ice sheet, the atmosphere and solid Earth affects the long-term response of the Greenland Ice Sheet under constant warming. Our findings suggest four distinct dynamic regimes of the Greenland Ice Sheet on the route to destabilization under global warming – from recovery via quasi-periodic oscillations in ice volume to ice sheet collapse.\n\nComplex network analysis of fine particulate matterÂ (PM2.5): transport and clustering\n\nNa Ying, Wansuo Duan, Zhidan Zhao, and Jingfang Fan\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1029–1039, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1029-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1029-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA complex PM2.5 measurement network has been built to investigate transport patterns and cooperative regions in China. Network-based degree measurements are used to reveal the spatial transport pattern of PM2.5. The study also attempts to investigate the seasonal transport path of PM2.5. In addition, the cooperation regions of PM2.5 are quantified according to their synchronicity characteristics. The proposed study can be applied to other air pollutant data, such as ozone and NOx.\n\nCO2 surface variability: from the stratosphere or not?\n\nMichael J. Prather\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 703–709, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-703-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-703-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric CO2 fluctuations point to changes in fossil fuel emissions plus natural and perturbed variations in the natural carbon cycle. One unstudied source of variability is the stratosphere, where the influx of aged CO2-depleted air can cause surface fluctuations. Using modeling and, separately, scaling the observed N2O variability, I find that stratosphere-driven surface variability in CO2 is not a significant uncertainty (at most 10 % of the observed interannual variability).\n\nQuantifying memory and persistence in the atmosphereâland and ocean carbon system\n\nMatthias Jonas, Rostyslav Bun, Iryna Ryzha, and Piotr Å»ebrowski\n\nEarth Syst.

The system has been trapped progressively in terms of persistence, while its ability to build up memory has been reduced. We expect system failures globally well before 2050 if the current trend in emissions is not reversed immediately and sustainably.\n\nSalinity dynamics of the Baltic Sea\n\nAndreas Lehmann, Kai Myrberg, Piia Post, Irina Chubarenko, Inga Dailidiene, Hans-Harald Hinrichsen, Karin HÃ¼ssy, Taavi Liblik, H.

It is a primary external driver controlling ecosystem dynamics of the Baltic Sea. The long-term dynamics are controlled by river runoff, net precipitation, and the water mass exchange between the North Sea and Baltic Sea. On shorter timescales, the ephemeral atmospheric conditions drive a very complex and highly variable salinity regime.\n\nSensitivity of landâatmosphere coupling strength to changing atmospheric temperature and moisture over Europe\n\nLisa Jach, Thomas Schwitalla, Oliver Branch, Kirsten Warrach-Sagi, and Volker Wulfmeyer\n\nEarth Syst.

In Europe, this happens most frequently in summer. Here, we examine how differences in atmospheric temperature and moisture change where and how often the land surface can influence rainfall. The results show that the differences barely move the region of strong surface influence over Scandinavia and eastern Europe, but they can change the frequency of coupling events.\n\nHuman impacts and their interactions in the Baltic Sea region\n\nMarcus Reckermann, Anders Omstedt, Tarmo Soomere, Juris Aigars, Naveed Akhtar, Magdalena BeÅdowska, Jacek BeÅdowski, Tom Cronin, MichaÅ Czub, Margit Eero, Kari Petri HyytiÃ¤inen, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Anders Kiessling, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Karol KuliÅski, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, Michelle McCrackin, H. E. Markus Meier, Sonja Oberbeckmann, Kevin Parnell, Cristian Pons-Seres de Brauwer, Anneli Poska, Jarkko Saarinen, Beata Szymczycha, Emma Undeman, Anders WÃ¶rman, and Eduardo Zorita\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1–80, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs part of the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports (BEAR), we present an inventory and discussion of different human-induced factors and processes affecting the environment of the Baltic Sea region and their interrelations. Some are naturally occurring and modified by human activities, others are completely human-induced, and they are all interrelated to different degrees. The findings from this study can largely be transferred to other comparable marginal and coastal seas in the world.\n\nExploring the coupled ocean and atmosphere system with a data science approach applied to observations from the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition\n\nSebastian Landwehr, Michele Volpi, F. Alexander Haumann, Charlotte M. Robinson, Iris Thurnherr, Valerio Ferracci, Andrea Baccarini, Jenny Thomas, Irina Gorodetskaya, Christian Tatzelt, Silvia Henning, Rob L. Modini, Heather J.

Leonard, Fernando Perez-Cruz, David Walton, and Julia Schmale\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 1295–1369, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1295-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1295-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition surveyed a large number of variables describing the dynamic state of ocean and atmosphere, freshwater cycle, atmospheric chemistry, ocean biogeochemistry, and microbiology in the Southern Ocean. To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, we apply a sparse principal component analysis and identify temporal patterns from diurnal to seasonal cycles, as well as geographical gradients and hotspots of interaction. Code and data are open access.\n\nAccounting for surface waves improves gas flux estimation at high wind speed in a large lake\n\nPascal Perolo, Bieito FernÃ¡ndez Castro, Nicolas Escoffier, Thibault Lambert, Damien Bouffard, and Marie-Elodie Perga\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 1169–1189, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1169-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1169-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWind blowing over the ocean creates waves that, by increasing the level of turbulence, promote gas exchange at the air–water interface. In this study, for the first time, we measured enhanced gas exchanges by wind-induced waves at the surface of a large lake. We adapted an ocean-based model to account for the effect of surface waves on gas exchange in lakes. We finally show that intense wind events with surface waves contribute disproportionately to the annual CO2 gas flux in a large lake.\n\nMultiscale fractal dimension analysis of a reduced order model of coupled oceanâatmosphere dynamics\n\nTommaso Alberti, Reik V. Donner, and StÃ©phane Vannitsem\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 837–855, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-837-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-837-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide a novel approach to diagnose the strength of the ocean–atmosphere coupling by using both a reduced order model and reanalysis data. Our findings suggest the ocean–atmosphere dynamics presents a rich variety of features, moving from a chaotic to a coherent coupled dynamics, mainly attributed to the atmosphere and only marginally to the ocean. Our observations suggest further investigations in characterizing the occurrence and spatial dependency of the ocean–atmosphere coupling.\n\nModelling sea-level fingerprints of glaciated regions with low mantle viscosity\n\nAlan Bartholet, Glenn A. Milne, and Konstantin Latychev\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 783–795, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-783-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-783-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nImproving the accuracy of regional sea-level projections is an important aim that will impact estimates of sea-level hazard around the globe. The computation of sea-level fingerprints is a key component of any such projection, and to date these computations have been based on the assumption that elastic deformation accurately describes the solid Earth response on century timescales. We show here that this assumption is inaccurate in some glaciated regions characterized by low mantle viscosity.\n\nJarzynski equality and Crooks relation for local models of airâsea interaction\n\nAchim Wirth and Florian LemariÃ©\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 689–708, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-689-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-689-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show that modern concepts of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics can be applied to large-scale environmental fluid dynamics, where fluctuations are not thermal but come from turbulence. The work theorems developed by Jarzynski and Crooks are applied to air–sea interaction. Rather than looking at the average values of thermodynamic variables, their probability density functions are considered, which allows us to replace the inequalities of equilibrium statistical mechanics with equalities.\n\nInteracting tipping elements increase risk of climate domino effects under global warming\n\nNico Wunderling, Jonathan F. Donges, JÃ¼rgen Kurths, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 601–619, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-601-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-601-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the Earth system, climate tipping elements exist that can undergo qualitative changes in response to environmental perturbations. If triggered, this would result in severe consequences for the biosphere and human societies. We quantify the risk of tipping cascades using a conceptual but fully dynamic network approach. We uncover that the risk of tipping cascades under global warming scenarios is enormous and find that the continental ice sheets are most likely to initiate these failures.\n\nA climate network perspective on the intertropical convergence zone\n\nFrederik Wolf, Aiko Voigt, and Reik V. Donner\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 353–366, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-353-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-353-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn our work, we employ complex networks to study the relation between the time mean position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and sea surface temperature (SST) variability. We show that the information hidden in different spatial SST correlation patterns, which we access utilizing complex networks, is strongly correlated with the time mean position of the ITCZ. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion on drivers of the annual migration of the ITCZ.\n\nSpatiotemporal patterns of synchronous heavy rainfall events in East Asia during the Baiu season\n\nFrederik Wolf, Ugur Ozturk, Kevin Cheung, and Reik V. Donner\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 295–312, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-295-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-295-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMotivated by a lacking onset prediction scheme, we examine the temporal evolution of synchronous heavy rainfall associated with the East Asian Monsoon System employing a network approach. We find, that the evolution of the Baiu front is associated with the formation of a spatially separated double band of synchronous rainfall. Furthermore, we identify the South Asian Anticyclone and the North Pacific Subtropical High as the main drivers, which have been assumed to be independent previously.\n\nRankings of extreme and widespread dry and wet events in the Iberian Peninsula between 1901 and 2016\n\nMargarida L. R. Liberato, Irene Montero, CÃ©lia Gouveia, Ana Russo, Alexandre M. Ramos, and Ricardo M. Trigo\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 197–210, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-197-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-197-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtensive, long-standing dry and wet episodes are frequent climatic extreme events (EEs) in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). A method for ranking regional extremes of persistent, widespread drought and wet events is presented, using different SPEI timescales. Results show that there is no region more prone to EE occurrences in the IP, the most extreme extensive agricultural droughts evolve into hydrological and more persistent extreme droughts, and widespread wet and dry EEs are anti-correlated.\n\nStratospheric ozone and quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) interaction with the tropical troposphere on intraseasonal and interannual timescales: a normal-mode perspective\n\nBreno Raphaldini, AndrÃ© S. W. Teruya, Pedro Leite da Silva Dias, Lucas Massaroppe, and Daniel Yasumasa Takahashi\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 83–101, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-83-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-83-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeveral recent studies suggest a modulation of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The physics behind this interaction, however, remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the QBO–MJO interaction and the role of stratospheric ozone as a forcing mechanism. A normal-mode decomposition procedure combined with causality analysis reveals significant interactions between MJO-related modes and QBO-related modes.\n\nDaytime low-level clouds in West Africa â occurrence, associated drivers, and shortwave radiation attenuation\n\nDerrick K. Danso, Sandrine Anquetin, Arona Diedhiou, Kouakou Kouadio, and ArsÃ¨ne T. Kobea\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 1133–1152, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1133-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1133-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe atmospheric and surface conditions that exist during the occurrence of daytime low-level clouds (LLCs) and their influence on solar radiation were investigated in West Africa. During the monsoon season, these LLCs are linked to high moisture flux driven by strong southwesterly winds from the Gulf of Guinea and significant background moisture levels. Their occurrence leads to a strong reduction in the incoming solar radiation and has large impacts on the surface energy budget.\n\nWater transport among the world ocean basins within the water cycle\n\nDavid GarcÃ­a-GarcÃ­a, Isabel Vigo, and Mario Trottini\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 1089–1106, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1089-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1089-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe global water cycle involves water-mass transport on land, in the atmosphere, in the ocean, and among them. The GRACE mission has allowed for the quantification of water-mass variations. It was a revolution in the understanding of Earth dynamics. Here, we develop and apply a novel method, based on GRACE data and atmospheric models, that allows systematic estimation of water-mass exchange among ocean basins. This is valuable for understanding the role of the ocean within the water cycle.\n\nEconomic impacts of a glacial period: a thought experiment to assess the disconnect between econometrics and climate sciences\n\nMarie-NoÃ«lle Woillez, GaÃ«l Giraud, and Antoine Godin\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 1073–1087, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1073-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1073-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo illustrate the fact that future economic damage from global warming is often highly underestimated, we applied two different statistically based damage functions available in the literature to a global cooling of 4 °C. We show that the gross domestic product (GDP) projections obtained are at odds with the state of the planet during an ice age. We conclude that such functions do not provide relevant information on potential damage from a large climate change, be it cooling or warming.\n\nSemi-equilibrated global sea-level change projections for the next 10 000 years\n\nJonas Van Breedam, Heiko Goelzer, and Philippe Huybrechts\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 953–976, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-953-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-953-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe made projections of global mean sea-level change during the next 10 000 years for a range in climate forcing scenarios ranging from a peak in carbon dioxide concentrations in the next decades to burning most of the available carbon reserves over the next 2 centuries. We find that global mean sea level will rise between 9 and 37 m, depending on the emission of greenhouse gases. In this study, we investigated the long-term consequence of climate change for sea-level rise.\n\nThe synergistic impact of ENSO and IOD on Indian summer monsoon rainfall in observations and climate simulations â an information theory perspective\n\nPraveen Kumar Pothapakula, Cristina Primo, Silje SÃ¸rland, and Bodo Ahrens\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 903–923, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-903-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-903-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInformation exchange (IE) from the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) is investigated. Observational data show that IOD and ENSO synergistically exchange information on ISMR variability over central India. IE patterns observed in three global climate models (GCMs) differ from observations. Our study highlights new perspectives that IE metrics could bring to climate science.\n\nClimate change as an incentive for future human migration\n\nMin Chen and Ken Caldeira\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 875–883, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-875-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-875-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe examine the implications of future motivation for humans to migrate by analyzing todayâs relationships between climatic factors and population density, with all other factors held constant. Such analyses are unlikely to make accurate predictions but can still be useful for informing discussions about the broad range of incentives that might influence migration decisions. Areas with the highest projected population growth rates tend to be the areas most adversely affected by climate change.\n\nCompound warmâdry and coldâwet events over the Mediterranean\n\nPaolo De Luca, Gabriele Messori, Davide Faranda, Philip J. Ward, and Dim Coumou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 793–805, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-793-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-793-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we quantify Mediterranean compound temperature and precipitation dynamical extremes (CDEs) over the 1979–2018 period. The strength of the temperature–precipitation coupling during summer increased and is driven by surface warming. We also link the CDEs to compound hot–dry and cold–wet events during summer and winter respectively.\n\nClimateâgroundwater dynamics inferred from GRACE and the role of hydraulic memory\n\nSimon Opie, Richard G. Taylor, Chris M. Brierley, Mohammad Shamsudduha, and Mark O. Cuthbert\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 775–791, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-775-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-775-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKnowledge of the relationship between climate and groundwater is limited and typically undermined by the scale, duration and accessibility of observations. Using monthly satellite measurements newly compiled over 14 years in the tropics and sub-tropics, we show that the imprint of precipitation history on groundwater, i.e. hydraulic memory, is longer in drylands than humid environments with important implications for the understanding and management of groundwater resources under climate change.\n\nMesoscale atmospheric circulation controls of local meteorological elevation gradients on Kersten Glacier near Kilimanjaro summit\n\nThomas MÃ¶lg, Douglas R. Hardy, Emily Collier, Elena KropaÄ, Christina Schmid, Nicolas J. Cullen, Georg Kaser, Rainer Prinz, and Michael Winkler\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 653–672, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-653-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-653-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe glaciers on Kilimanjaro summit are like sample spots of the climate in the tropical mid-troposphere. Measurements of air temperature, air humidity, and precipitation with automated weather stations show that the differences in these meteorological elements between two altitudes (~ 5600 and ~ 5900 m) vary significantly over the day and the seasons, in concert with airflow dynamics around the mountain. Knowledge of these variations will improve atmosphere and cryosphere models.\n\nOn the interconnections among major climate modes and their common driving factors\n\nXinnong Pan, Geli Wang, Peicai Yang, Jun Wang, and Anastasios A. Tsonis\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 525–535, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-525-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-525-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe variations in oceanic and atmospheric modes play important roles in global and regional climate variability. The relationships between their variations and regional climate variability have been extensively examined, but the interconnections among these climate modes remain unclear. We show that the base periods and their harmonic oscillations that appear to be related to QBO, ENSO, and solar activities act as key connections among the climatic modes with synchronous behaviors.\n\nEurasian autumn snow link to winter North Atlantic Oscillation is strongest for Arctic warming periods\n\nMartin Wegmann, Marco Rohrer, MarÃ­a Santolaria-OtÃ­n, and Gerrit Lohmann\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 509–524, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-509-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-509-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPredicting the climate of the upcoming season is of big societal benefit, but finding out which component of the climate system can act as a predictor is difficult. In this study, we focus on Eurasian snow cover as such a component and show that knowing the snow cover in November is very helpful in predicting the state of winter over Europe. However, this mechanism was questioned in the past. Using snow data that go back 150 years into the past, we are now very confident in this relationship.\n\nBack to the future II: tidal evolution of four supercontinent scenarios\n\nHannah S. Davies, J. A. Mattias Green, and Joao C. Duarte\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 291–299, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-291-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-291-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have confirmed that there is a supertidal cycle associated with the supercontinent cycle. As continents drift due to plate tectonics, oceans also change size, controlling the strength of the tides and causing periods of supertides. In this work, we used a coupled tectonic–tidal model of Earth's future to test four different scenarios that undergo different styles of ocean closure and periods of supertides. This has implications for the Earth system and for other planets with liquid oceans.\n\nConcurrent wet and dry hydrological extremes at the global scale\n\nPaolo De Luca, Gabriele Messori, Robert L. Wilby, Maurizio Mazzoleni, and Giuliano Di Baldassarre\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 251–266, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-251-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-251-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show that floods and droughts can co-occur in time across remote regions on the globe and introduce metrics that can help in quantifying concurrent wet and dry hydrological extremes. We then link wet–dry extremes to major modes of climate variability (i.e. ENSO, PDO, and AMO) and provide their spatial patterns. Such concurrent extreme hydrological events may pose risks to regional hydropower production and agricultural yields.\n\nSynthesis and evaluation of historical meridional heat transport from midlatitudes towards the Arctic\n\nYang Liu, Jisk Attema, Ben Moat, and Wilco Hazeleger\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 77–96, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-77-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-77-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPoleward meridional energy transport (MET) has significant impact on the climate in the Arctic. In this study, we quantify and intercompare MET at subpolar latitudes from six reanalysis data sets. The results indicate that the spatial distribution and temporal variations of MET differ substantially among the reanalysis data sets. Our study suggests that the MET estimated from reanalyses is useful for the evaluation of energy transports but should be used with great care.\n\nAmplified warming of seasonal cold extremes relative to the mean in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics\n\nMia H. Gross, Markus G. Donat, Lisa V. Alexander, and Steven C. Sherwood\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 97–111, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-97-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-97-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study explores the amplified warming of cold extremes relative to average temperatures for both the recent past and future in the Northern Hemisphere and the possible physical processes that are driving this. We find that decreases in snow cover and warmer-than-usual winds are driving the disproportionate rates of warming in cold extremes relative to average temperatures. These accelerated warming rates in cold extremes have implications for tourism, insect longevity and human health.\n\nTropical and mid-latitude teleconnections interacting with the Indian summer monsoon rainfall: a theory-guided causal effect network approach\n\nGiorgia Di Capua, Marlene Kretschmer, Reik V. Donner, Bart van den Hurk, Ramesh Vellore, Raghavan Krishnan, and Dim Coumou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 17–34, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-17-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-17-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrivers from both the mid-latitudes and the tropical regions have been proposed to influence the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) subseasonal variability. To understand the relative importance of tropical and mid-latitude drivers, we apply recently developed causal discovery techniques to disentangle the causal relationships among these processes. Our results show that there is indeed a two-way interaction between the mid-latitude circulation and ISM rainfall over central India.\n\nAnalysis of the position and strength of westerlies and trades with implications for Agulhas leakage and South Benguela upwelling\n\nNele Tim, Eduardo Zorita, Kay-Christian Emeis, Franziska U. Schwarzkopf, Arne Biastoch, and Birgit HÃ¼nicke\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 847–858, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-847-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-847-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study reveals that the latitudinal position and intensity of Southern Hemisphere trades and westerlies are correlated. In the last decades the westerlies have shifted poleward and intensified. Furthermore, the latitudinal shifts and intensity of the trades and westerlies impact the sea surface temperatures around southern Africa and in the South Benguela upwelling region. The future development of wind stress depends on the strength of greenhouse gas forcing.\n\nOrganization of dust storms and synoptic-scale transport of dust by Kelvin waves\n\nAshok Kumar Pokharel and Michael L. Kaplan\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 651–666, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-651-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-651-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study contributes to a better understanding of how large-scale dust transport can be organized from northwest Africa to the US, Amazon basin, and Europe and might be due in part to Kelvin waves. We also think there is still a need to study major historical dust events that occurred in this region to confirm that this location is suitable and responsible for the generation of the Kelvin waves and the transport of dust on a regular basis.\n\nESD Reviews: Climate feedbacks in the Earth system and prospects for their evaluation\n\nChristoph Heinze, Veronika Eyring, Pierre Friedlingstein, Colin Jones, Yves Balkanski, William Collins, Thierry Fichefet, Shuang Gao, Alex Hall, Detelina Ivanova, Wolfgang Knorr, Reto Knutti, Alexander LÃ¶w, Michael Ponater, Martin G. Schultz, Michael Schulz, Pier Siebesma, Joao Teixeira, George Tselioudis, and Martin Vancoppenolle\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 379–452, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-379-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-379-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEarth system models for producing climate projections under given forcings include additional processes and feedbacks that traditional physical climate models do not consider. We present an overview of climate feedbacks for key Earth system components and discuss the evaluation of these feedbacks. The target group for this article includes generalists with a background in natural sciences and an interest in climate change as well as experts working in interdisciplinary climate research.\n\nNorth Pacific subtropical sea surface temperature frontogenesis and its connection with the atmosphere above\n\nLeying Zhang, Haiming Xu, Jing Ma, Ning Shi, and Jiechun Deng\n\nEarth Syst.

The atmosphere is critical to frontogenesis through net heat flux and the Aleutian low, the latter of which benefits meridional temperature advection.\n\nThe multi-scale structure of atmospheric energetic constraints on globally averaged precipitation\n\nMiguel Nogueira\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 219–232, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-219-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-219-2019, 2019\n\nPotential of global land water recycling to mitigate local temperature extremes\n\nMathias Hauser, Wim Thiery, and Sonia Isabelle Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 157–169, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-157-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-157-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a method to keep the amount of water in the soil at the present-day level, using only local water sources in a global climate model. This leads to less drying over many land areas, but also decreases river runoff. We find that temperature extremes in the 21st century decrease substantially using our method. This provides a new perspective on how land water can influence regional climate and introduces land water management as potential tool for local mitigation of climate change.\n\nPipes to Earth's subsurface: the role of atmospheric conditions in controlling air transport through boreholes and shafts\n\nElad Levintal, Nadav G. Lensky, Amit Mushkin, and Noam Weisbrod\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 1141–1153, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1141-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1141-2018, 2018\n\nCausal dependences between the coupled oceanâatmosphere dynamics over the tropical Pacific, the North Pacific and the North Atlantic\n\nStÃ©phane Vannitsem and Pierre Ekelmans\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 1063–1083, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1063-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1063-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe El Niño–Southern Oscillation phenomenon is a slow dynamics present in the coupled ocean–atmosphere tropical Pacific system which has important teleconnections with the northern extratropics. These teleconnections are usually believed to be the source of an enhanced predictability in the northern extratropics at seasonal to decadal timescales. This question is challenged by investigating the causality between these regions using an advanced technique known as convergent cross mapping.\n\nMoisture transport and Antarctic sea ice: austral springÂ 2016 event\n\nMonica Ionita, Patrick Scholz, Klaus Grosfeld, and Renate Treffeisen\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 939–954, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-939-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-939-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn austral spring 2016 the Antarctic region experienced anomalous sea ice retreat in all sectors, with sea ice extent in October and November 2016 being the lowest in the Southern Hemisphere over the observational record (1979–present). The extreme sea ice retreat was accompanied by the wettest and warmest spring on record, over large areas covering the Indian ocean, the Ross Sea, and the Weddell Sea.\n\nRecent changes of relative humidity: regional connections with land and ocean processes\n\nSergio M. Vicente-Serrano, Raquel Nieto, Luis Gimeno, Cesar Azorin-Molina, Anita Drumond, Ahmed El Kenawy, Fernando Dominguez-Castro, Miquel Tomas-Burguera, and Marina PeÃ±a-Gallardo\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 915–937, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-915-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-915-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyzed changes in surface relative humidity (RH) at the global scale from 1979 to 2014 and compared the variability and trends in RH with those in land evapotranspiration and ocean evaporation in moisture source areas across a range of selected regions worldwide. Our results stress that the different hypotheses that may explain the decrease in RH under a global warming scenario could act together to explain recent RH trends.\n\nCited articles\n\nBerling-Wolff, S. and Jianguo, W.
