        "text": "Abstract Objective To investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of dyslipidemia among residents in Chengdu City, so as to provide insights into improving the prevention and control of dyslipidemia. Methods Based on the baseline survey of the Natural Population Cohort Study in Southwest China, residents aged 30 to 79 years was selected from 34 towns (communities) in 5 counties (districts) of Chengdu City using the multi-stage stratified cluster random sampling method in 2018. Demographic information and lifestyle behaviors were collected through questionnaires. Blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, serum uric acid, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were collected through physical examination and laboratory tests. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the factors affecting dyslipidamia. Results A total of 21 113 participants were surveyed, including 9 331 males (44.20%) and 11 782 females (55.80%), and had a mean age of (50.80±12.32) years. The prevalence rate of dyslipidemia was 35.64%, and the prevalence rates of high TG, low-HDL-C, high TC and high LDL-C were 17.25%, 11.88%, 10.11% and 7.35%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified gender (male, OR=1.584, 95%CI: 1.463-1.716), age (50 to 79 years old, OR：1.221-1.444, 95%CI: 1.079-1.632), residence (urban, OR=1.123, 95%CI: 1.052-1.198), marital status (not married, OR=1.246, 95%CI: 1.128-1.376), educational level (high school and above, OR=0.914, 95%CI: 0.849-0.983), current smoking (OR=1.220, 95%CI: 1.121-1.327), drinking (1 to 2 d/week, OR=1.525, 95%CI: 1.368-1.700; 3 to 5 d/week, OR=1.857, 95%CI: 1.575-2.191; almost every day, OR=1.512, 95%CI: 1.269-1.801), sedentary time in leisure time (>2 h/d, OR=1.123, 95%CI: 1.046-1.206), central obesity (OR=2.212, 95%CI: 1.986-2.265), hypertension (OR=1.489, 95%CI: 1.388-1.598), diabetes (OR=1.998, 95%CI: 1.833-2.157) and hyperuricemia (OR=2.012, 95%CI: 1.848-2.192) as factors affecting dyslipidemia. Conclusion The prevalence of dyslipidemia among residents in Chengdu City was mainly associated with smoking, drinking, sedentary time, central obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hyperuricemia."
