Apple Employee Discounts

Apple is one of the few technology companies that provides employee discounts on its products. The tech giant developed the employee purchase program (EPP) available to current workers, contractors, members, and family members of participating organizations.

Throughout the year, Apple employees can receive a special discount on three system bundles or displays, three iPads, three iPhones, three Watches, and up to ten iPods. Apple's employee discount program includes various products from various areas. These are some examples:

Hardware: Employees can get Apple employee discounts on various Apple goods, such as Mac laptops, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and accessories. This perk helps employees keep up with the latest technological breakthroughs without paying the full retail price. According to Glassdoor, Employees can get a 25% discount on an iPod, iPad, or computer once a year. After 90 days on the job, employees can select between a $500 discount on a Mac (except the Mini) and a $250 discount on an iPad, and this offer can be repeated every three years.

Software and Services: Employees can save money on Apple's software and services besides hardware. This includes subscriptions to services such as Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud storage, and App Store software apps. According to Glassdoor, Most Apple software is available at a 50% discount, and AppleCare is available at a 25% discount.

Third-Party items: Apple's partners also show their appreciation to employees by providing discounts on their items. These collaborations complete the Apple benefits package, resulting in a well-rounded work experience.

Eligibility for Apple Employee Discounts

Apple's employee discount program is open to all employees, including full-time and part-time employees and temporary and contract workers.

The Employee purchase program goes into effect after an employee has been on the job for 90 days. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the program, which is only now going into effect. Employees can choose between two discounts: $500 off the price of a Mac (mini excluded) or $250 off the price of an iPad. After using the discount, an employee is no longer eligible for it for three years.

Employees are usually eligible for discounts after a specific duration of employment, which encourages long-term commitment. To qualify for the Apple employee discounts, employees must be 18 years old and show proof of eligibility. This program is only designed for employees' usage.
