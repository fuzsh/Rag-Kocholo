My experience with the Apple Store has been variable. On a repair issue I got much better service from a different Apple Store than the one I bought the machine from.\n\nI will buy the extended support ----\n\nI think that's a good idea. I did with my MacBook purchase for the first time, after years of buying trouble-free Macs, on the suspicion that the Intel change could be problematical. That is now looking prescient.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Mac-Medic\n\nUser level: Level 6\n\n17,301 points\n\nI've found if you buy direct from Apple--either online or at a store--you have better chance of getting it replaced, or repaired faster, if you have a problem. Usually if you buy it from an online retailer like Mac Mall, Club Mac, etc., they will make you get the unit repaired--even if it's DOA out of the box.\n\n- Bmer\n\nMac Owners Support Group\n\nJoin Us @ MacOSG.com\n\nITMS: MacOSG Podcast\n\nï£¿ An Apple User Group ï£¿\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: BiTurboMunkie\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n30 points\n\nagreed w/ Plecostomus.\n\nalso, note that BTOs may not be exchanged/returned at an apple store.\n\ni'd just get it at an apple store if there's one around. the advantage is that you get to check you MB right there (my 1st MB's lid was misaligned).\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: indigobox\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n28 points\n\nI always thought that Apple took pride in their service. I recently bought a 20\" iMac from an Apple Store over here in the UK and the service was terrible.\n\nI live about 1 1/2 hours away from the store, so it is quite a trek, however I bought the new mac as I thought it was time to upgrade my hardware. I normally buy my mac peripherals from another store over here called John Lewis, same price and better customer service. Also give 2 year warranty on full systems so that appeals more.\n\nUpon buying it, I got home, and found that their was no keyboard in the box. The box had never been opened before, yet the keyboad was missing. I rang through to the store, which took an age, for the manager to say pack it all up and bring it back in, and they will replace it in full and give another system.\n\nThis never happened, when I got there, there was a keyboard waiting, and she just replaced that, so I was a little miffed as it isn't a light system to just carry around.\n\nMaybe you would experience better service, but so far it has left a really sour taste in my mouth, with dealing with Apple Store.\n\nCj.\n\nï£¿ iMac, 20\", 2.16GHz ï£¿ macBook, 1.8GHz (white) Mac OS X (10.4.7) ï£¿ iPod Photo 30Gb ï£¿ iPod Hifi\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: remedya\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nI always thought that Apple took pride in their\n\nservice. I recently bought a 20\" iMac from an Apple\n\nStore over here in the UK and the service was\n\nterrible.\n\nI have bought most of my Apple kit from their London stores and have always found their staff helpful and knowledgable with problems (I have had to return two laptops with logic board faults).\n\nI would steer away from resellers such as John Lewis as there are difficulties if repairs are needed. The Apple stores have authority to replace items; resellers don't.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: MleB\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n80 points\n\nI have only recently come back to Mac (after some 15 years away) and one of the reasons I did so was, should the device kack - and it most certainly will - I can go to my local Apple Store a mere 10 minute walk away (and where I bought it) and nail someone's sorry a** to the wall to get it fixed.\n\nIs this the relationship you were referring to?\n\nðŸ˜‰\n\nIn truth, I have been back to the store with a couple of software details since - and though this particular store is usually crazed with activity, there are a couple of staff who recognise me.\n\nActually, there are several highly regarded Apple resellers quite handy to me, but I guess I figured that if I'm going to buy a new Apple product, then an Apple Store (with its own repair facility) made sense in the long run.\n\nThere are certanly reports elsewhere in this Forum that suggests that often Apple Store Geniuses are, well...not - but still there is some value to me to having a 'bricks and mortar'location rather than relying entirely on a 1-800 to some place like Mombai and Support that consists of 'return to depot' or a 3rd Party repair facilty.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: dwb\n\nUser level: Level 7\n\n33,070 points\n\nIf your computer is dead on arrival or if a defect becomes apparent within the first week or two it is easier to get a replacement if you've bought direct from Apple whether online or at the store. If you read the return policy for third party vendors you'll see that they all indicate that you must return to Apple for repair. Now the laws of your locality might trump this policy as they do in my state, but the run around you get from the vendor can make the law nearly unenforceable. If you wish to buy online I highly recommend doing so direct from Apple.\n\nIf you want to buy from a local store there are often advantages to buying from an Apple reseller rather than at an Apple Store. Obviously one of the reasons Apple decided to start their own stores was because many areas weren't being served by a reseller, or a good reseller. OTOH there are many good resellers - and I must admit that I work for one that I think is excellent. If you have a local store that is interested in building relationships and doesn't just think of you as an income source then buying there would be a good idea.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Kent Hasel1\n\nUser level: Level 2\n\n230 points\n\nPersonally I just bought from Amazon because of the rebate and no tax as I live in CA. Your computer should be covered anyway for the normal warrenty period and if you were worried buy Apple care and you get that creamy Apple service no matter where you buy for years ðŸ™‚.\n\neMac 1Gz\n\nLink"
