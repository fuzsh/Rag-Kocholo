Apple will lock you out of your phone for subscriptions that you cancel but they have not canceled on their end and then will force you to pay for it before they allow your device to receive updates and upgrades. This company controls more of your data and access than they want you to know! Iâ€™ve been with them for years and had no clue until I tried to update my phone and couldnâ€™t. Samsung, I apologize for cheating on you!! Iâ€™m ready to come back home.\n\nDate of experience : August 15, 2024\n\nI have an MacBook that needs a newâ€¦\n\nI have an MacBook that needs a new battery. The computer itself say it needs a replacement. The nearest apple store in 3 hours away and they , I am told, have no processes to ensure that the battery will be replaced the day I schedule a Genius Bar visit. In fact, I was told that could not happen because the first visit was a â€œconsult â€œ and then it would take 3-5 days for them to fix. A battery issue, that they know head of time. With messaging from their own computer and a person 3 hours away. Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nDate of experience : August 14, 2024\n\nGreat Products\n\nNever had any real issues with Apple products I bought and Iâ€™ve been a user for a long time now. Instead, everything works as advertised and all the products are a joy to use. (I used MacBooks, AirPods and iPhones, along with the services like iCloud and Apple Music).\n\nRecently, I bought a used iPhone 11 but one in a very good condition because I wanted a second phone, and even now in 2024 this phone is so fast and works so well. I canâ€™t think of any Android that can do that.\n\nDate of experience : August 01, 2024\n\nApple ID password reset is literally a reason not to go near any Apple products.\n\nGenuinely advise people to think twice about relying on anything running off Apple ID. As a \"security measure\" it takes three days to reset a password. My partner had her phone stolen and couldn't remember her password and we went to reset it assuming it would be the same as Google, etc, and do it straight away via email or security questions, etc, only to be informed it would take *three days*. This means three days before we can access Find My iPhone; three days before we can be sure the phone was stolen and not lost; three days of no access to any other Apple devices using her account. The customer service rep seemed to think this was a selling point, proudly boasting that for some who forget their ID it can take months. Months to access services you're paying for, because their security practices are proudly dysfunctional. Meanwhile people actually stealing phones get a head start if you forget your details. It has made what was already a difficult situation ten times worse, and upset everyone involved considerably. It's also interesting to note that Apple don't have a complaint section on their support site. They couldn't give a monkeys.\n\nDate of experience : August 05, 2024\n\nI forget my password so I call appleâ€¦\n\nI forget my password so I call apple support and first the person act like he was going to help me. When he ask me for the serial number for my iPhone, I didnâ€™t know what that have to do with it but I give it to him. Few second later he ask me for proof of purchase. I ask him what that have to do with my password. I brought the phone with Cricket a phone company through a bank loan and I pay for it monthly. He told me that I need to have proof of purchase to be able to help me. Is ridiculous I feel like **** that guy make me feel offended. I never steal in my life, I work hard to get my stuff. Some people donâ€™t have thousand of dollar to drop in the moment for a phone. I get a loan and I pay for it and I pay more than the iPhone cost. For this person treat me like that. But I think that how Apple teach there employees to treat people because in few hours I found a bunch of people when through the samething happens to me even in the apple stores. They ask for proof of purchase when they go to ask for any kind of help with their account or password. So what said is if you buy a iPhone from someone or still pay for it Apple Support donâ€™t help you because the equipment is stolen in their eyes. So people keep every received or proof of purchase because Apple Support doesnâ€™t help you if you donâ€™t.\n\nDate of experience : August 16, 2024\n\nDisgusting service\n\nDisgusting service, wouldnt refund my sons 130.00 gift card that he brought with he's birthday money, 2 calls ended. Said I can't record calls, under data I'm calling on my phone. Calls can be recorded, and also I gave consent for my call to be recorded. Under data protection I call ask for that anyway.\n\nTotal disregard for any child that can't use it.\n\nApple pay is only I USA. Not UK\n\nAlso can't buy apps or games with regard to tye apple give card.\n\nTold me go back to tesco 2 iccassions which I have, been messes about back and fourth and noone will refund my sons 130 birthday money.\n\nThese gift cards don't always work, such misleading information.\n\nThe staff are rude. Also a minor who is trying to be independent. There was no understanding with this company.\n\nGenerally an awful company with no understanding of trading standards under the misleading consumer ACT. I will now start that progress , as its misleading.\n\nDate of experience : August 09, 2024"
