        "text": "Apple, which opened its first 2 exclusive India retail stores in April, with CEO Tim Cook himself inaugurating the outlets in financial capital Mumbai and national capital Delhi, respectively, is planning to open 3 more shops in the country by 2027, with the move coming as part of a larger expansion plan.\n\nAlso Read | Apple's India stores pay ₹40 lakh rent, record up to ₹25 crore monthly sales: Report\n\nThis is according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, its Chief Correspondent on Apple. Gurman posted the following tweet on Thursday: “NEW: Apple is working on 53 new, remodeled or relocated stores through 2027, including several new locations in China, Japan and Korea; 3 new stores in India, and new outlets in Miami, Detroit, London and Germany. All of the details and charts here.”\n\nWhere will Apple open the 3 new outlets in India?\n\nAccording to Gurman, like the first 2 stores, the new ones, too, will come up in Mumbai and Delhi. Borivali, a suburb at the north-western end of the financial capital, is proposed to get the country's third Apple store, in 2025. The fifth, meanwhile, will be opened at a location in the city's Worli in 2027.\n\nSandwiched between these will be the tech giant's fourth exclusive outlet, which will open in 2026, housed at the national capital's DLF Promenade mall; this, in fact, may very well be the company's second-largest shop in India.\n\nAlso Read | Apple launches India's second store in Delhi; Why is it a big deal?\n\nFirst Apple outlets in India\n\nOn April 18, Cook welcomed customers at Apple's maiden outlet in the world's fifth-largest economy, doing so at the Jio World Drive mall in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC); this is its largest shopping facility in India.\n\nThe CEO then flew to Delhi, and on April 20, inaugurated the outlet at the Saket's Select Citywalk mall."
