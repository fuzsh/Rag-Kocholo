        "text": "NOTE: As of November 15, 2012, US Postal Service regulations allow the shipment of products containing lithium-based batteries to APO, FPO, or DPO locations. USPS still prohibits the shipment of stand-alone lithium-based batteries, such as a replacement MacBook Pro battery. If you intend to purchase a stand-alone lithium battery for shipment to an APO, FPO or DPO address, please contact your freight forwarding service before making your purchase to determine product eligibility and delivery options to your desired destination.\n\nApple does not ship directly to APO/FPO addresses. However, there are a number of third-party forwarding services that can conveniently redirect Apple Store shipments to APO/FPO addresses for a fee.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nSign up with one of the freight forwarding services such as APO Box (Opens in a new window), or select another provider of your choosing.\n\nThen simply return to the Apple Online Store for Government and Military Employees to complete your order using the new U.S. address provided by the forwarding service. It’s really that simple.\n\nApple will ship your order to your new U.S. shipping address and the forwarding service will forward your order to your APO/FPO address. (Fees and service vary by vendor.)\n\nAPO/FPO Shipping Charges:\n\nPlease note that in addition to the standard shipping charges billed by Apple Inc., the forwarding service has its own charge for getting your order to your APO/FPO address. These additional fees include handling fees, Priority Mail postage, and any optional insurance coverage. Both the postage and insurance are charged at published U.S. Postal Service rates.\n\nAPO/FPO Insurance (Highly Recommended):\n\nFor APO/FPO Shipments, Apple is not responsible for loss or damage to products during shipment from the third-party forwarding service to APO/FPO. Therefore, we highly recommend that you insure each package for up to its full value. Insurance costs range from $3.20 for $200.00 worth of coverage to $21.00 for $2000.00 worth of coverage.\n\nAPO/FPO Delivery Time:\n\nPlease note that APO/FPO deliveries can take up to 6-8 weeks depending on local conditions at destination. Forwarding services use US Postal Service (USPS) to deliver to APO/FPO addresses, and USPS package tracking is not available to final destination.\n\nReturns:\n\nPlease notify the Apple support agent that your return will initiate from an APO/FPO address. Please click here for the process."
