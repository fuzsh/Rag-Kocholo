        "text": "More and more employees are saying that benefits are starting to outweigh salaries. This has proven particularly true in a global workplace that has been turned on its head by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEmployee stress levels over family, employment, health, and wellness are higher than ever. Apple, a company that has always emphasized its employeesâ health and wellbeing, has once again stepped up to ensure employee happiness, peace of mind, work/life balance, and overall care and empathy.\n\nHere are some of the top Apple employee benefits the company offers, which paint a picture as to why people love working for the tech giant that cares.\n\nNine Apple Employee Benefits and Perks That Retain Top Talent\n\n1. Health and Wellness\n\nApple employees enjoy excellent health insurance, with both dental and vision coverage. An onsite wellness center at Appleâs headquarters in California also gives employees access to various medical professionals, including doctors, chiropractors, and mental wellness practitioners.\n\nOther Apple employee health benefits include:\n\nLife and supplemental life insurance\n\nDisability insurance\n\nOccupational accident insurance\n\nRetiree health and medical\n\n2. Vacation and Time Off\n\nApple believes in a healthy work/life balance. Paid time off (PTO) for vacation and sick days for new hires is between 15 to 20 days per year.\n\nFor more senior employees, this jumps to between 20 to 30 days vacation and leave days a year.\n\n3. Parental Leave\n\nApple has a very unique and generous maternity leave policy. New mothers receive four weeks of paid leave before giving birth and 14 weeks of maternity leave afterward. An additional six weeksâ unpaid leave is also optional.\n\nFathers and non-birth parents are also able to take six weeks of paid leave.\n\n4. Commuting\n\nCommuting is the bane of most employeesâ daily work life. As such, Apple sweetens the deal for its employees by offering a free, exclusive shuttle service for workers living in Cupertino, Appleâs California HQ.\n\nThe company also provides a $100 stipend for employees to use towards the bus and other transport costs.\n\n5. Gym Credit\n\nIt is widely known that physical fitness plays a big role in mental wellness and productivity. Thatâs why Apple gives its employees $300 gym credit per month to put towards their personal physical health and wellness.\n\n6. Stock Purchase Program\n\nBeing personally invested in a company has proven to deepen an employeeâs drive to work harder towards its success. Apple has a company stock purchase plan, with available stock grants that allow employees to buy discounted stock.\n\nRelated: Ultimate List Of Companies With the Best Perks for Employees\n\n7. Tuition And Self Improvement\n\nApple has its own âuniversityâ, which is an on-campus training center geared towards helping employees understand the companyâs culture, values, and role in the world.\n\nEmployees can upskill with general business skills through online classes, along with personal finance seminars.\n\nApple also offers to reimburse its employees for tuition costs up to $5,250.\n\n8. Retirement\n\nApple doesnât forget about its employees just because they are retired. While in the companyâs employ, employees are offered a 50% 401(k) match for up to 6% of their total salary.\n\n9. Some More Fun Stuff\n\nTo keep things fresh and exciting, Apple has some fantastic extra employee perks that keep people connected and driven:\n\nProduct Discounts\n\nEmployees receive significant discounts on Apple products, keeping them on-trend and connected.\n\nSubsidized Meals\n\nAppleâs on-site Cafe Mac offers healthy home-cooked-style meals at low subsidized costs. In addition to this, there are always fresh apples available to snack on for free!\n\nFamous Beer Bash\n\nA regular event for Apple employees, the beer bash offers time to wind down and relax with free drinks, food, and often - celebrity cameos. Itâs been reported that stars such as Demi Lovato, Stevie Wonder, and OneRepublic have performed at these events.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith a strong emphasis on health and wellness, Apple offers comprehensive benefits to keep its employees happy and productive.\n\nIf you want to retain your employees and show you appreciate their hard work, consider learning from companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, and Tesla.\n\nMore and more employees are saying that benefits are starting to outweigh salaries.
