        "text": "What initially drew you to a role as a Lead Apple Solutions Consultant (ASC)?\n\nI was looking for a career that allowed me to do more than sales. As an ASC, I’m responsible for so many aspects of the business, from inventory to merchandising to training the staff. I’m not just selling products — I’m managing a business.\n\nWhat surprised you most about this job?\n\nI was amazed by the amount of guidance I received from Apple. When hired, I came out to Cupertino for training. I then traveled around my home region of New York City, meeting and learning from other ASCs. This was more than simply understanding the basics. This was about forming the relationships that would help me achieve long-lasting success.\n\nHow does your role affect the big picture at Apple?\n\nThis is an opportunity to find out what your real potential is. I’m a business partner to every retail store I work with. That means my leadership and business skills can have a significant impact on the Apple business, the retailer, and its employees.\n\nFind a team and begin your own\n\nstory here.\n\nBusiness Development\n\nApple expects innovation in every part of the company, and this team meets that challenge by identifying and creating new commercial models for Apple products and services. Join them and you’ll collaborate with our regional partner managers, sales executives, and teams both inside and outside Apple to create and execute sales plans that cover both industry and customer focus areas. This work includes strategic planning and development, results-driven partner management, and contract negotiations. You’ll set aggressive growth objectives that align with our worldwide strategy and orchestrate support for our largest agreements to consistently deliver according to plan. Areas of work include New Business Development, Partner Management, and Enterprise Sales.\n\nFind available Business Development roles\n\nAccount Management\n\nApple reaches its consumers and its business, education, and government customers in a variety of ways: through consumer resellers, carriers, and business and system integrators, as well as by direct sales. Within each channel, account executives are responsible for driving growth and top-line revenue while upholding the goal of every Apple customer connection — delivering a great customer experience. This work includes strategic account planning, account development, relationship management, and performance management. You’ll work with business and technical teams across Apple, including those in engineering, marketing, and legal, collaborating to solve business problems and ensure success for both Apple and its customers. Areas of work include Channel Account Management, Field Sales, Partner Management, and Inside Sales.\n\nFind available Account Management roles\n\nApple Store Sales\n\nAs part of a team focused on delivering great customer experiences, you’ll introduce people to the Apple products that help them do what they love in new ways. Or you might work with the local business community, connecting entrepreneurs and professionals with the tools they need to build success. Whether you work up front, backstage, or online, every day you’ll have the chance to make a big difference — for your customers, your team, and yourself. Roles include Specialist, Expert, Operations Expert, and Business Expert.\n\nFind available Apple Store Sales roles\n\nRetail Partner Sales\n\nMany of our customers enjoy an Apple retail experience even when there’s no Apple Store nearby — and they have this team to thank. The team includes Apple sales staff who connect with customers one-on-one in our Apple Shops within partner retailers. This group also develops relationships with retail partners worldwide to ensure all Apple inventory and merchandising elements are up to date and maintained according to Apple standards. As a team member, your passion, knowledge, and entrepreneurial spirit will transfer to the retail partner’s sales staff to drive their success.
