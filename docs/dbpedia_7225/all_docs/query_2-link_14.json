        "text": "Apple saw an opportunity to evolve its stores from being solely focused on transactions to becoming community hubs with education and creativity at the center. Together with Apple, we devised a strategy to help people pursue their passions.\n\nPeople can now visit an Apple Store to attend live performances with bands and musicians, learn drawing skills from influential artists, and collaborate with startups and entrepreneurs. They can send their kids to Apple Store camps for filmmaking and coding. They can even step out of stores and go on guided walks with professional photographers to learn new camera skills.\n\nTo facilitate the learning sessions, we designed and developed new software inside storesâfrom CMS-enabled massive video walls down to forum displays for intimate sessions.\n\nThe custom 6K video wallsâmultiple giant screens measuring as big as 34 feet wide that are synchronized with softwareâare the heart of the Today at Apple retail experience.\n\nThey also presented a challenge at a new scale, requiring months of prototyping. Work & Co designed and developed the content and display modes, and developed a new publishing tool.\n\nBecause stores have varying video wall dimensions, we created responsive designs for ultra-large screens to make sure each mode would work across every video wall in every store.\n\nTo help employees around the world stay connected, we partnered with Apple to create Helloâa global tool that helps the 70,000 Apple retail employees stay up-to-the-minute about their own stores, priorities, and news from across the company.\n\nEmployees get fresh video messages from Apple executives, on-the-job tips, prioritized tasks from their managers, education on Apple products, and support for Today at Apple sessions."
