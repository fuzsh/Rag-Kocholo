        "text": "Former roommates, Noah Lee and Dane Jensen, started Sock Club to share their love of socks with the world. Their vision quickly grew from a small subscription service into a bespoke sock design and manufacturing business — making over 15 million pairs of socks for consumers and some of the world’s biggest brands.\n\nLee and Jensen’s goal is to build a meaningful and lasting company that pushes the textile industry forward. From paying employees fairly and manufacturing responsibly to donating 100,000 pairs of socks every year to people in need, Sock Club is showing how a small business can make a huge impact.\n\nWe’re excited to be in a period of rapid growth. Apple is a key enabler of that.\n\nNoah Lee, Co-Founder, Sock Club\n\nThe cofounders choose Mac to empower every member of the team to do their best work across their company locations — from the creative minds in design to the dynamic forces in sales. Designers rely on Mac because it runs powerful creative apps, like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, that help them turn ideas into bespoke designs. And collaboration apps like Slack and Front keep design and sales teams in constant communication — helping them stay synchronized while juggling an ever-growing number of custom orders.\n\nSock Club also provides iPad and iPhone to their knitting teams in their North Carolina mills. Now, instead of typing order information by hand, they use iPad and iPhone to scan QR codes to schedule and program designs on the knitting machines. That information is automatically available to the sales team in Texas, where they use CRM apps like Hubspot on iPad to generate customer order details, create shipping labels, and take photos of products to send to customers.\n\nEvery one of Sock Club’s 45 employees wears a lot of hats to keep the business running. In fact, Max Williamson, VP of Customer Success and Strategic Partnerships, takes on the additional responsibility of being the company’s de facto IT department. Max turns to Apple Business Essentials to deploy and configure devices with ease. What used to take hours now only needs 15 minutes to get new machines up and running for employees. He’s also able to manage the entire fleet of Apple devices from Texas to North Carolina remotely — which helps the team to concentrate on the business, not tech support.\n\nApple Business Essentials offers a platform to scale business operations, making onboarding new employees and setting up new Apple devices fast and easy.\n\nMax Williamson, VP of Customer Success and Strategic Partnerships, Sock Club\n\nWith Mac, iPhone, and iPad every member of the company is equipped with the best tools to innovate the textile industry in a socially responsible way. So this small but mighty team can carry out its mission to put their socks on every foot in the world.\n\nSince 1932, R.M.Williams has been proudly handcrafting boots in Australia. Skilled craftspeople make the footwear in their Adelaide workshop with painstaking attention to detail — each boot is touched by more than 80 pairs of hands. With over 60 stores and 1,100 employees across 15 countries, the brand is committed to providing every customer with a personalized shopping experience for the perfect fit.\n\niPhone has replaced the traditional point of sale and transformed the shopping experience at R.M.Williams stores. Employees are more mobile and engaged and can better provide customers with a personalized, end-to-end experience in a more open, welcoming environment.\n\niPhone has been pivotal in revolutionizing our in-store experience, resulting in a significant increase in sales and a more personalized customer experience.\n\nPeter Ratcliffe, Head of Technology, R.M.Williams\n\nWith the NewStore app on iPhone, store employees look up stock, access endless aisle, order items for delivery, and complete payment with Tap To Pay on iPhone without ever leaving their customer’s side. Teams also use Apple devices to support in-store operations such as backend inventory, performance dashboards, scheduling, and company communications.\n\nIt’s also quick and easy to train store employees to use iPhone. They can easily access training videos and material, which gives them the confidence to process sales in just a few hours. And set-up is just as simple — with remote configuration via zero-touch deployment, employees use iPhone straight out of the box.\n\nSwitching to iPhone was a game-changer for R.M.Williams. We’re able to provide the next level of customer service, which helps us build better connections with our customers.\n\nKyle Grimshaw, Head of Stores, R.M.Williams\n\nBy streamlining operations and empowering employees to be mobile, iPhone saves the R.M.Williams employees around an hour a day. They now reinvest that time into enhancing the customer and employee experience which has resulted in an increase in sales. This commitment shows that the quality of R.M.Williams’ service is rivaled only by the quality of its product.\n\nSaturnbird is a coffee company based in Shanghai, China, whose innovative products and design focus has earned them massive growth, and a devoted fanbase. Their patented extraction process is shaking up the coffee industry, and has helped them scale from a single coffee shop to a globally-popular company delivering flavor to over 10 million customers online.\n\nSaturnbird attributes this success to their dynamic workforce — which has increased to 230 employees — and to the Apple devices and software they rely on. The company focuses on attracting and nurturing top talent by enhancing engagement and the employee experience at every interaction. They say choosing Mac has made a huge difference by increasing creativity and productivity.\n\nWe offer Mac to every Saturnbird employee because we want to empower them to do great things. High-quality tools inspire high-quality work across our teams.\n\nJun Wu, Founder & CEO, Saturnbird\n\nAll development happens on Mac, from conception to final product — employees rely on Mac for exceptional power and speed. And with all-day battery life*, product managers can stay mobile within the office and as they travel. The team also utilizes Feishu, a comprehensive collaboration app on Mac, and makes the most of Apple’s built-in apps like Freeform, Keynote, and Pages for productivity — enabling them to seamlessly pick up their workflows on iPhone and iPad, whenever needed.\n\nThe design team uses Mac to make everything from graphics to award-winning packaging design. They prefer Mac because of its compatibility with industry-leading creativity apps, like Cinema 4D and Rhino, and its ability to power through heavy tasks like 3D rendering. ”Mac makes the pro workflow smooth and easy” says Lian Wang, co‑founder.\n\nMac has proven to be popular for users and IT alike. 82% of Saturnbird’s employees choose to work on it. With streamlined management and security features, Mac enables the IT manager to address all company IT support needs single-handedly. Since adoption, Saturnbird has experienced zero security incidents on their devices. And by using built-in features such as FileVault and XProtect, they save on not having to manage 3rd party security add-ons.\n\nStability, security, and ease of management are crucial for efficient IT operation. Mac has consistently proven to be our reliable partner.\n\nWeijun Yao, IT Manager, Saturnbird\n\nTrusted by members from every team, Apple technology has become core to Saturnbird’s flavorful culture. And with each cup of delicious, aromatic coffee, customers get to savor the benefits.\n\nChildhood friends, Evan Kidera and Gil Payumo, share a passion for bringing authentic flavor to their community. They brought it to life when they launched their first Filipino-Mexican fusion food truck, combining tacos and burritos with the signature flavors of sisig — a rustic Filipino dish with a family twist from Gil’s childhood. Starting with one food truck, Señor Sisig has grown to four trucks and three restaurants across the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nAs the business grew, so did opportunities to increase their operational efficiency. To increase productivity, and maintain consistency across all locations, they centralized food preparations to a single commercial kitchen and built a technology infrastructure with Apple products and services.\n\nApple helps to power our entire business — from inventory, receiving, and distribution to management and finance — we just couldn’t do any of this without it.\n\nEvan Kidera, Co-Founder, Señor Sisig\n\nKitchen managers use Mac and iPad with the Foodager app to monitor all incoming ingredients and distribute cooked food across all locations. For training and onboarding, they turn to the Opus Training app on iPad to share content like recipe books and videos on how to roll the burritos “the Sisig” way. And Slack on iPhone helps their mobile workforce stay connected for instant troubleshooting and seamless communication.\n\nTo scale community engagement and awareness, the team creates and shares unique, home-grown content shot on iPhone to keep customers updated on everything from daily specials to collaborations with local artists. They also use Apple Business Connect to build their customer base. “We use Apple Business Connect so people can use our place cards in Apple Maps to find us, as well as order their food and complete their payment,” says Evan.\n\nTo streamline their IT operation, they use Apple Business Essentials. Features like zero touch deployment ensures that all devices are ready to be used right out of the box — no matter where they’re located. And for help desk support, AppleCare+ for Business Essentials empowers employees to instantly request repairs and troubleshoot around the clock — reducing downtime and increasing productivity.\n\nApple Business Essentials with AppleCare+ for Business Essentials enables us to seamlessly deploy devices to our team and gives us peace of mind for all technical support and repair.\n\nLejla Borovac, COO, Señor Sisig\n\nSeñor Sisig is bringing truly authentic flavors to more people in their community. And with Apple hardware and services, Gil and Evan have all the ingredients they need to serve the best burritos in town.\n\nDance is an e-bike subscription service founded by Eric Quidenus-Wahlforss, Alexander Ljung, and Christian Springub in 2020. Their goal is to give people friction-free access to electric bikes — making cities more about people and the planet and less about cars. To fulfill the company’s mission, they needed a platform that offered flexibility and security in order to scale. That’s why they decided to use Apple products from day one.\n\nFrom the beginning, we chose Apple because it has the best technology for building a business like Dance. Swift has allowed us to create innovative apps for our teams and customers.\n\nEric Quidenus-Wahlforss, Founder and CEO, Dance\n\nAt the head office in Germany, every employee uses Mac to support collaboration and productivity. Designers and developers work on Mac to create and test prototypes. In the workshop, mechanics use iPhone to access an e-bike’s service history by scanning a QR code attached to each frame. And everyone uses iPad to manage time sheets and shifts, simplifying workflows. Even Dance‘s customers can use iPhone, to contact the maintenance team and schedule roadside repairs directly through the app.\n\nWhen Dance employees needed a custom app to streamline workflows for their mechanics and operations team, they built it in Swift, Apple‘s powerful and intuitive programming language. Nynke de Boer, one of Dance’s early employees, was able to learn Swift in a few weeks and create the custom iOS app in a matter of months. Dance also used Swift to build an app for customers to manage their accounts and view real-time journey data from their e-bikes. Swift makes it easy to continuously update the app to meet new business needs as the company grows.\n\nApple devices have allowed us to build an amazing product. The platform gives us the flexibility to innovate and stay on top of our business’s rapid growth and changing needs.\n\nEric Quidenus-Wahlforss, Founder and CEO, Dance\n\nDance has rolled out its e-bikes in five major European cities to date. It relies on the built-in security of every Apple device to protect company and customer data as it continues to scale quickly. Staying nimble with the most powerful and flexible tools in an evolving work environment is why Dance chose Apple. And its business only continues to pick up speed, reaching new riders every single day.\n\nSophie Gilliatt and Katherine Westwood founded The Dinner Ladies, an online meal delivery service, to bring nutritious, home-cooked frozen meals to busy families. What started in their kitchen grew quickly, and they realized they needed a powerful technology solution to keep up. Supported by Apple’s ecosystem of products, they went from cooking 20 meals per week to over 90,000.\n\nAs we grew, the biggest problem was communication around consistency and product quality. That’s where Apple technology supports our business — we couldn’t have scaled without it.\n\nKatherine Westwood, Cofounder, The Dinner Ladies\n\nGilliatt and Westwood love using Apple technology in their personal lives. In their business, Apple products help The Dinner Ladies run efficiently, safely, and economically. As orders grew through the pandemic, Apple devices enabled Gilliatt and Westwood to manage day-to-day tasks remotely. They log recipes and plan menus on Mac, create employee rosters on iPad, and use iPhone to track deliveries — saving time and money.\n\nEmployees also find Apple’s intuitive, user-friendly platform simple for sharing data with team members and communicating with vendors. And Apple devices can sync with third-party apps and products, so staff can easily monitor food storage temperatures remotely, ensure quality control on iPad, and optimize delivery routes on iPhone.\n\nWhen technology just works — and we’ve found that to be the case with all of our Apple devices — it just makes us so much more efficient.\n\nKatherine Westwood, Cofounder, The Dinner Ladies\n\nApple products help The Dinner Ladies streamline operations from stove top to send-off. Their prepared food has skyrocketed in popularity, bringing busy families together by giving them more quality time at the dinner table. And the reliability of Apple technology frees up time so these talented cofounders can focus on creating innovative and nutritious recipes, which remains the heart and soul of their business.\n\nJaunt is one of Australia’s largest electric conversion workshops. The company upcycles four-wheel drive and classic cars into working electric vehicles so people can enjoy off-roading and driving while reducing their environmental impact. Its mission: Drive Australia toward a greener, cleaner future.\n\nWithout Apple, we couldn’t do what we do. We couldn’t run our business or make extremely concise, beautiful things cost effectively.\n\nDave Budge, CEO, Jaunt\n\nAcross the business, the Apple One platform and iCloud services let Jaunt move effortlessly from one job or device to another. In the concept stage, the teams use iPhone, iPad Pro, and Apple Pencil to scan the original vehicle, create mood boards, and design 3D models that can seamlessly be imported to Mac. Engineers use Numbers and OmniGraffle to plan electrical wiring diagrams. And every stage — from concept to build — is documented with iPhone.\n\nApple’s commitment to sustainability and 100 percent carbon-neutral operations made the choice of products to invest in a natural fit. Supported by Apple products, Jaunt is reducing emissions by creating efficient and paperless workflows. And rather than sourcing custom components from around the globe, Jaunt’s engineers design them on MacBook Pro and then make them by hand or send the designs to 3D printers for manufacture.\n\nJaunt marries hand-built craftsmanship with 21st-century manufacturing — a process driven and supported by Apple technology, from start to finish.\n\nDave Budge, CEO, Jaunt\n\nApple technology underpins the entire manufacturing process, enabling Jaunt to carry out its mission. By offering a reliable, efficient, and secure platform, Apple makes it easy for Jaunt to scale at any point. By implementing Apple technology, Jaunt has sped up and simplified production — without sacrificing quality or craftsmanship."
