        "text": "Introduction\n\nApple provides a voluntary manufacturer’s one-year limited warranty on it’s iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads. The guarantee provides additional rights to those provided by consumer law, including those related to non-conforming products.\n\nThe Apple warranty has benefits in addition to consumer rights, but it doesn’t replace them. As an Apple product consumer, you have a right to decide whether to request service under the consumer rights or Apple’s one-year limited warranty.\n\nHow Does Apple’s Free One-Year Warranty Work?\n\nYou are only eligible for the Apple One Year Warranty if you bought any product from the Apple retail store or authorized Apple resellers, including Apple Certified Refurbished products. Examples of devices that qualify include the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Apple TV, and other Apple accessories. If you bought a second-hand iPhone from an independent seller, you could not qualify for an Apple warranty.\n\nIn addition to the free one-year warranty, Apple provides an additional coverage it calls AppleCare+. It’s a standard warranty on every Apple product, including 90 days of free product support through chat, in-store, or via phone.\n\nAdditional Reading: What Repairs or Services are Included With AppleCare?\n\nWhile AppleCare+ extends the guarantee and service, the terms aren’t standard across all products.\n\nFor example, AppleCare+ on a Mac extends the standard coverage for three years, while it only extends for two years on an iPad Pro.\n\nWhat Does the Warranty Cover?\n\nUnlike the AppleCare+ warranty, Apple’s one-year warranty is limited in coverage. It provides coverage for Apple products and accessories in the original packaging against flaws in quality and materials.\n\nWhat the warranty doesn’t cover\n\nThe warranty doesn’t apply to non-Apple hardware or software, even if it comes packaged or you purchase it with Apple hardware. Check if these products’ manufacturers, publishers, and resellers provide warranties.\n\nNote that the warranty does not include coverage for software issues, accidental damage, or damage due to misuse.\n\nThus, if you have a cracked screen, you may have dropped your phone, meaning that you are not eligible for cover. But, if your screen begins showing glitches for no apparent reason, you can access free repair services; as long as it is still within the one-year warranty.\n\nApple also doesn’t provide a warranty for software it distributes, with or without the Apple brand name. That includes, but isn’t limited to, system software. Check the details on your usage rights on the license agreement supplied with the software.\n\nApple’s one-year warranty doesn’t cover:\n\nNormal wear and tear or damage due to regular use or consumption of Apple products\n\nLiquid damages (wait, I thought they said it was water-proof…No they say it’s water resistant, and they don’t guarantee it)\n\nDamage arising from any service, including extensions and updates, offered by a non-Apple representative or non-authorized Apple service provider\n\nDamage due to abuse, accident, misuse, fire, earthquake, contact with liquids, or other external causes.\n\nDamage because of third-party products or components that don’t meet Apple product specifications.\n\nCosmetic damage, including dents and broken plastic ports, apart from when damage is due to faulty work quality.\n\nConsumable parts like batteries and protective covers, parts that shrink over time, except in the event of failure due to the material’s damage\n\nA missing or damaged serial number of an Apple product\n\nInformation that Apple obtains from government authorities about the theft of a product, and you’re unable to disable or enable security measures like passwords to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple product. That’s especially the case where there’s no proof of ownership, for example, proof of purchase.\n\nApple can replace a battery under warranty if it’s healthy dips below 80% during the first year of ownership.\n\nSchedule an appointment at your Apple Store Genius Bar to present the phone physically to an Apple store near you.\n\nSuppose your phone has any damage preventing the battery replacement process; Apple’s staff will have to deal with such an issue before the replacement. The technicians will determine the cost associated with such a repair. Prior to providing any battery replacement, they’ll typically go through various troubleshooting, such as determining if it is your cable or power adapter causing your iPhone not to charge or have battery issues.\n\nThe company has the discretion to turn down a warranty claim. Don’t be surprised if they don’t replace your battery. They can deny your warranty for any reason. For example, you have a scratch, gouge, or chip that doesn’t affect functionality? Denied…\n\nHow to Use Your Apple Warranty\n\nEnsure you access online help resources before asking for Apple warranty service. If your Apple product stills fail to work correctly after using the resources, call an Apple representative or your Apple store if that applies to you. Resellers can also provide the assistance you need if you reach them through online help resources.\n\nAn Apple representative will look at your warranty to establish if it requires service. You’ll advise them on how Apple will provide the service if you qualify for one.\n\nThe options include:\n\nRepairing the product using new or previously used genuine parts from Apple. These have undergone testing and passed all functional requirements determined by Apple.\n\nReplacing the Apple product with another one of the same model. You may also consent to get a replacement with a product with the same or almost similar features. For example, you could get a device of a different model but with the same features or the same model in a different color.\n\nExchange the product for a refund of the purchase price. The company may require that you replace some user-installable parts or Apple products. This option assumes the remaining portion of the warranty or 90 days from the date of repair or replacement. When Apple replaces a product or provides a refund, any replacement item becomes your property, and the replaced or refunded items become Apple’s property.\n\nCan I Claim an Apple Warranty Without a Receipt?\n\nThe receipt you obtained at the purchase of an Apple proof of purchase. Apple requires you to present it to claim your warranty. If the receipt or invoice is unavailable, you can show evidence using:\n\nThe purchased account\n\nCopy of the receipt\n\nSerial number\n\nSometimes you must present more than one of these documents to support your claim.\n\nDoes the Apple Warranty Start from the Purchase Date or Activation?\n\nThe standard one-year Apple warranty starts when you purchase a product from them. This is also the invoice date.\n\nYou can buy the AppleCare+ warranty within 60 days after the purchase date to extend the guarantee to two or three years, depending on the product. AppleCare+ start from your original purchase date though, not when you activate AppleCare+.\n\nHow Can Gophermods Help?\n\nIf you have a broken Apple device and live in Minneapolis, Minnesota, feel free to visit our repair facility.
