The Epic Games Store is also launching on Android worldwide. The app store is launching with games including Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe and Fall Guys. The company says it's working with developers to launch their games on the Epic Games Store in the future. Epic Games is also bringing its games to independent mobile store AltStore PAL, which announced yeste\n\nExpect more choppy action from Big Tech stocks: Analyst\n\nEquity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are rebounding, with the technology sector (XLK) at the forefront. CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino joins Catalysts to share his outlook on the tech market. Zino notes that while tech has \"led the way\" in the market recovery, it remains \"the worst performing sector\" since July's market peak. Semiconductors experienced the most severe sell-off but have since shown the strongest gains and recovery. Looking ahead, Zino predicts \"more choppy action\" following this surge, expecting market volatility to persist for the next 2-3 months and through the election period. He notes that earnings drive tech stocks and highlights two potential catalysts: Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming Blackwell launch and the likely Apple (AAPL) iPhone 16 release. \"Those are the two product launches that we think could potentially see more upside to consensus estimates,\" Zino states. However, he cautions investors not to \"expect anything too extreme here, at least in the immediate near term\" from the tech sector.

The iPhone maker on Wednesday announced that it will soon allow app developers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S. to make use of its devices’ near-field communications and certain security features to enable activities including in-store tap payments. With Apple previously not allowing this, many digital wallets turned to things like QR codes or other workarounds to turn their iPhone apps into in-store payment tools.\n\nFortnite returns on iPhones in EU, globally on Android\n\nMultiplayer shooter game Fortnite is available again on iPhones in the European Union and worldwide on Google's Android devices after a gap of four years, following legal measures by the EU, developer Epic Games said on Friday. Fortnite, created by Epic, a U.S.-based studio, and backed by China's Tencent, the world's largest game studio, launched in 2017 and its last-player-standing, \"battle royale\" format became an instant hit, drawing in millions of dedicated players. But in August 2020, Apple and Alphabet's Google removed Fortnite from their app stores for violating their guidelines by launching a payment feature, prompting several lawsuits challenging their rules of charging up to 30% commissions on payments.\n\nGOOGL, AAPL, MSFT: Which Magnificent Seven Stock Is the Best Buy?\n\nThis summer, the previously unassailable Magnificent Seven stocks have experienced some uncharacteristic weakness. Investors have been taking stock of both their large gains over the past year and their relatively elevated valuations and evaluating whether there are more attractive opportunities in other sectors of the market. This has led to something of a rotation into more value-oriented sectors like Healthcare and Financials. But these are still some of the world’s most dominant companies, a\n\nWhat Apple’s Steve Jobs taught this CEO about leadership\n\nAfter interning under Steve Jobs (AAPL), Chet Kapoor has had a fruitful career, from serving as Google's (GOOG) VP and now as the CEO of DataStax. He sat down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to share the inside scoop on what he learned from Steve Jobs, as the guy who got coffee for the guy who got coffee for Jobs.
