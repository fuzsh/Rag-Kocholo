        "text": "If you need help with an iPhone, iPad, Mac or other Apple product–whether it’s broken or faulty, or you just can’t figure out how to do something with it–the company will help you solve the issue. Apple says many problems can be solved over the phone or by chat or email, but one thing that sets it aside from other companies is its willingness to offer hands-on support from in-store Apple Geniuses.\n\nYou can speak to a Genius at the Genius Bar in an Apple Store. But in order to do so you will need to book an appointment with Apple in advance–you can’t just show up. (Well, there are a limited number of walk-in appointments available and they might be able to squeeze you in, but it’s likely you would have to wait for hours and you might have a wasted journey.)\n\nIn this article, we show you how to set up an appointment with a Genius at an Apple Store. But note that many questions can be answered using Apple’s online tools, by phoning Apple Support, by asking in the Apple Support Communities, or by tweeting at @AppleSupport.\n\nHow to book a Genius Bar appointment on the Apple website\n\nBefore popping into a store, backing up your device is always recommended. It will also be useful for you to bring a photo ID with you, which matches your reservation name.\n\nOnce you’re set, all you’ll need to do is turn up at your appointment time and tell a Genius that you’ve arrived!\n\nFancy yourself a bit of an Apple Genius? Read How to get a job working as an Apple Store Genius.\n\nUse the Apple Support app to book an Apple appointment\n\nYou can also use the Apple Support app to book an appointment at an Apple Store. To do this, download and launch the Apple Support app.\n\nOnce you’re in the app, you will be asked to allow the app to use your location. If you tap Don’t Allow, you will have to provide location information manually. Make your selection, and then tap Continue.\n\nTap Search at the top. An expanded search page will appear. Type “Genius” in the box and then select one of the Genius Bar results that appear. This will take you to the Genius Bar section where you can make an appointment.\n\nFoundry\n\nWhen you get to the Apple Store at the time of your appointment, you can use the Apple Store app on your iPhone to check in and let the staff know you’ve arrived."
