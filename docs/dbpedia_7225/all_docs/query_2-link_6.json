By definition, they are not privately owned, they're owned by Apple -- hence the name Apple Store.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Phil Huang\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n29 points\n\nHi there,\n\nYou might feel frustrated to obtain the information of become an Apple authorise reseller.\n\nActually, I have been tried to contact Apple regarding to become an authorise reseller. If you call Apple custer service at 0800 039 1010 and then they will tell you to call their sales department in London. The number is 0208 218 1000.\n\nApple will ask you to create an account with their Authorise distributors (Ingram, Computer 2000 and Westcoast Ltd). Also, you need to spend £34,000 per quarter with these three distributors. Okay, that's create an account with these three authorise distributors...\n\nAfter you have obtained an account with them. You will find out, these three distributors are not offer a competitively priced (even higher than Apple online store). The question is: How can you make a profit if you buy Apple products from these three distributors?\n\nI've been contact one of their sales, his name is Tim. Guess what did he told me? He said I need to spend £200,000 per quarter from these authorise distributors. I think you would rather to spend that money to buy Apple products from somewhere else.\n\nThe reason why Apple don't want people to buy their products and resell them. Because they don't want to increase a competitor. If you buy Apple products directly and then sell cheaper to somewhere else. Who is going to buy Apple products from its online store?\n\nI will recommend don't waste your time to discuss with people from Apple. Because they are not going to help your bussiness.\n\nGood luck!!!\n\nPhil.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: ali brown\n\nUser level: Level 7\n\n26,493 points\n\nHi Cody!\n\nThere are Apple Authorized Service Providers.\n\nYou could locate one in your area, using this Apple: Find Service: Search Page, call them, and maybe they will give you information, on how to become Apple Authorized.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nali b\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Tuttle\n\nUser level: Level 7\n\n29,541 points\n\nRead the Benefits & Requirements for the Apple VAR (Value Added Reseller) Program and/or get an application to participate in that program here:\n\nhttp://resellerapplication.apple.com/reseller/var_program.html\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Don Archibald\n\nUser level: Level 10\n\n101,653 points\n\n...they are not privately owned, they're owned by Apple...\n\nYes - they are company stores, not franchises nor in any other way privately owned. The folk who work at an Apple Store are Apple Employees.\n\nFWIW, any privately owned store would also, by definition, be a reseller.\n\nLink"
