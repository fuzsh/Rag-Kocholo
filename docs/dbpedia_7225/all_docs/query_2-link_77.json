Such as in 2019 the sale declined and in 2020 they again raised.\n\nGreater China: China is placed in this segment. For Apple, this is not a promising sector. In the last two consecutive years sales in this segment just got declined. The only reason behind this is, the segment is packed with local competitors with a low range of price.\n\nJapan: This sector is somewhat constant in-term of sales. The sale was same in 2019 and 2020.\n\nRest of Asia Pacific: This is now emerging as a new potential sector for sales. In the year 2020, the sale of this segment increased by 10%.\n\nOutbound Logistics:\n\nThis includes the activity of sending a manufactured product to California’s warehouse of Apple and then distributing them. Apple’s technological items have a short product life cycle of about 12 months. Thus, the inventory cost is higher for them. Apple reduced its shipment costs in China and the Asian region by efficient market penetration. Therefore, they have gained a good brand image and brand appeal from the customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales:\n\nMarketing and sales are highly responsible for the enormous revenue of Apple. The company’s sale comes from 7 distinguished sectors. These are:\n\nApple Retail Stores\n\nApple Online Stores\n\nWholesalers\n\nDirect Sales Force\n\nThird-Cellular Network Carries\n\nRetailers\n\nValue-added Resellers\n\nThrough direct distribution, Apple earns 34% of its sales while by indirect distribution they earn the rest 66%.\n\nService:\n\nApple is very consistent in course of its service. In the pre-purchase stage, Apple by its young, enthusiast and technologically expert trained sales assistants demonstrate to the customers about their products. After the purchase, the customers can upgrade to newer models of Apple products for some additional money. There is even a return policy for purchased items in 14 days.
