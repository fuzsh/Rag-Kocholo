        "text": "Who Can Order?\n\nTo order any computers (including iPads and other mobile devices) intended to be UCSF-owned devices, please check with your supervisor, manager or department chair to determine if you are authorized to purchase before placing an order.\n\nWhere Can I Order From?\n\nTo order any UCSF Macs, we require everyone to have their Mac orders placed via UCSF ITFS Depot by submitting a computer order request, or place your order with CDW-G using BearBuy. Visit this web page for more information: https://supplychain.ucsf.edu/computers-and-peripherals.\n\nIMPORTANT: Please DO NOT purchase any UCSF Apple devices from retail stores, including Apple retail stores.\n\nFor UCSF iPads, following must be done:\n\nFor new iPad project/request(s), start with submitting an iPad Request by visiting https://ucsf.service-now.com/ucsfit and select Request Specific Services > Desktop Services > iPad Project Consultation Request\n\nAfter the project is approved, iPads purchases need to be placed directly with CDW-G through BearBuy or PMM/McKesson..\n\nFor PMM/McKesson, a quote should be used to upload into the system and can be generated from CDW-G. Visit this web page for more information on how to contact CDW-G to request a quote: https://supplychain.ucsf.edu/computers-and-peripherals.\n\nAn IT field technician can also assist with this ordering if needed. Please submit a general IT help request at https://help.ucsf.edu for ordering assistance.\n\nOnce the iPads are delivered, Desktop Engineering in UCSF IT needs to be notified with the order number or all serial numbers (can be found on back on box) to help enable proper provisioning by submitting a general IT help request at https://help.ucsf.edu if an IT field technician did not assist you with your order.\n\nIt is critically important to purchase all UCSF Apple devices from our authorized vendors for the following reasons:\n\nAllows full enforcement of security configurations standardized by UCSF IT Field Services for all UCSF-owned Apple devices\n\nProvides automatic \"proof of ownership\" to UCSF when IT is tasked to open an Apple support case to clear the Activation Lock remotely from a locked device\n\nIMPORTANT: Apple recently advised UCSF IT that reimbursement records are not acceptable as proof of ownership for Activation Lock cases.\n\nWhat If The Authorized Vendor Is Out Of Stock?\n\nWe do our best to monitor the situation with the vendor we authorized. For urgent orders that cannot wait for our authorized vendors to have inventory available to ship, please DO NOT purchase your new devices from any retail stores, including Apple stores. Contact your dedicated IT support team at UCSF instead so our IT leadership can make special arrangements as needed. We added emergency vendors in the past that have Macs in stock.\n\nThe problem with retail-purchased Apple devices by users is when the purchase was not paid directly by UCSF, it becomes \"sold to a consumer\" vs. \"sold to UCSF\". In such cases, Apple does not associate UCSF as the owner of these devices. When Apple's Activation Lock blocks our IT staff from setting them up for users, Apple support will require the individual listed in the original sales receipt to be the person contacting Apple support for the Activation Lock case, even after the person separates from UCSF, if the iCloud account linked to the device cannot be removed for any reason. This has been recently clarified by our Apple representative.\n\nWhat Is Activation Lock?\n\nActivation Lock is one of Apple's security features designed to prevent anyone else from using your Apple device if it's ever lost or stolen. This feature was recently introduced to Macs in 2020 for computer models released after 2017. Visit Apple's website at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208987 for more details, including steps to manually disable Activation Lock for Macs that aren't fully managed by UCSF IT.\n\nCan't IT Eliminate Activation Lock On Their Own?\n\nApple supports clearing Activation Lock remotely if the iCloud account linked to it is inaccessible as long as the recognized owner of the device in question initiates contact with Apple support. Apple devices that were purchased by users and reimbursed by UCSF do not qualify as UCSF-owned devices per Apple's rules.\n\nActivation Lock is manufactured into the device itself and cannot be removed by IT or customers. Clearing the Activation Lock, if activated, is entirely controlled by Apple for Macs that aren't managed in a supported Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform through Apple School Manager. At UCSF, we use a supported MDM solution called Jamf Pro for Macs and Intune for corporate-managed iPads to help manage Activation Locks as long as the computer's MDM enrollment is managed through UCSF's Apple School Manager account with Apple.\n\nMy UCSF iPad Was Purchased Elsewhere. What Should I Do?\n\nFor iPads that are purchased elsewhere not following these guidelines, they may not be compatible for setup with Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform used by UCSF IT Field Services and should be returned. If you cannot return them, please open a \"Get IT Help\" ticket at https://help.ucsf.edu to discuss your specific scenario. An hourly recharge will be imposed for special handling of your iPad.\n\nMy UCSF Mac Was Purchased Elsewhere. What Should I Do?\n\nApple School Manager became a new requirement for IT-managed Macs since early 2021. If your UCSF Mac was purchased at a retail store and originally paid with your payment card, then you must return it because it will not meet the ownership requirement that Apple's Activation Lock support requires when their assistance is needed to resolve remotely locked devices, such as Find My enabled with user-created iCloud accounts."
