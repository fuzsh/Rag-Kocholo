        "text": "Here's everything you need to know about how to use the Genius Bar and even how to pursue employment there.\n\nWhat services the Genius Bar offers\n\nApple's Genius Bar is a technical support service that can perform a wide variety of repairs and services on iPhones, MacBooks, Apple Watches, and other devices. If you make an appointment online before visiting an Apple Store, Apple will assess the problem and have a very good idea about whether your device can be serviced on-site or if more substantive repairs will be needed.\n\nMany common kinds of repairs — like screen and battery replacements on iPhones — can be done on the same day while you wait. In some cases, depending on your Apple warranty, Geniuses will simply replace your device.\n\nSome repairs, like damaged laptop screens and motherboards, for example, may require depot service. A Genius can take your device and ship it out for repairs, and the serviced item can be mailed directly to your home when the repair is complete.\n\nRelated stories\n\nQuick tip: If possible, back up your device before taking it to a Genius Bar. This is especially important if swapping your device with a replacement is necessary.\n\nStart with an appointment\n\nBefore you go directly to an Apple Store and try to get the attention of a Genius, start online or with a phone call. The Genius Bar allows for a very limited number of walk-ins each day, and if you arrive without an appointment, you might need to wait quite a while to be seen — or turned away entirely.\n\nInstead, the best place to start is on the Apple Genius Bar website, where you can describe your issue. It might even be possible to resolve some problems online, but if it looks like you need one-on-one customer service, you'll be scheduled for a Genius Bar appointment.\n\nTo make an appointment, scroll down and tap Get hardware help, and sign in with your Apple ID. Choose the device that's giving you trouble, and follow the instructions to describe the issue you are having. If it's something a Genius Bar can help you with, you'll have the option to choose the Apple Store closest to you or one with the most convenient appointment availability. Find a location, make an appointment, and go to the store at the indicated time.\n\nQuick Tip: If you prefer to start on the webpage for your local Apple Store, find the link to make a reservation for the Genius Bar, and it'll take you to the same Genius Bar website.\n\nTaking classes at a Genius Bar\n\nApple Stores don't just offer technical support and service via their Genius Bars — you can also take classes. Apple's Geniuses offer classes on how to get the most out of products like iPhones, MacBooks, Apple Watch, and even software like iMovie and iWork.\n\nTo see what classes are available in your local area, visit the Today at Apple webpage. Scroll to the bottom of the page, where you'll find upcoming sessions in your region, or click the View Calendar button to see more options.\n\nCommon classes include \"getting started\" sessions for devices like the iPhone and iPad, workshops on using the Apple Pencil to draw and sketch on iPads, iPhone photography and more.\n\nThese classes are free, but you should use the website to reserve a slot for the upcoming class to ensure there's space for you.\n\nHow to find a Genius Bar job\n\nThe good news is that you don't need a deep knowledge of electronics or software to get a job at an Apple Genius Bar. Apple hires Geniuses on both a part-time and full-time basis, and the company is primarily looking for people with strong people skills and problem-solving abilities.\n\nOther key qualifications include the ability to maintain composure and customer focus while solving technical issues and the ability to stay on schedule.\n\nApple provides training and certification to Geniuses but prefers candidates to have an aptitude for acquiring skills in technical repairs, excellent verbal communication skills, and the ability to work well on a team.\n\nYou can look for Genius Bar opportunities at Apple's Careers website."
