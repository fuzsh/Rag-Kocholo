In the unlikely event a product is not what you expected, you can return or exchange it with a receipt within 14 days of the date you receive the product from Apple. The product must be in its original condition with all of its included parts, accessories, and packaging and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based on the payment method. In addition, please note:\n\nApple products purchased through other retailers must be returned to those retailers in accordance with their returns and refunds policies.\n\nProducts can be returned only in the country where purchased.\n\nFor returns for cash or cash equivalent over $750, Apple will mail a refund check to you within 10 business days.\n\nFor returns with a gift receipt, Apple will offer you an Apple Gift Card.\n\nFor returns paid with your Apple Account balance, Apple will refund the portion paid to your Apple Account or, if unable, an Apple Gift Card.\n\nReturned products may require inspection.

If these features were activated and cannot be disabled by the person in possession, Apple may refuse the return or exchange.\n\nTo return ten or more of the same product, you must return to the Apple Store where purchased.\n\nFor complete details on how to return a product purchased at the Apple Store please visit the Returns & Refunds page.\n\nReturn of AppleCare+ under an iPhone Upgrade Program\n\nShould you return the AppleCare+ portion of your iPhone Upgrade Program, you will lose your Upgrade Option as set forth in iPhone Upgrade Program Terms & Conditions.\n\nReturns of Products with Wireless Services – Service Cancellation\n\nWireless carriers have different service cancellation policies. Returning Apple products with wireless services may not automatically cancel or reset your wireless account. You are responsible for your wireless service agreement and any fees associated with your wireless account. Please contact your wireless service provider for more information.\n\nZEISS Optical Inserts\n\nZEISS Optical Inserts - Prescription are custom, third-party products and may not be returned to an Apple Store location.

If you are unable to use your iPhone due to an unauthorized software modification, its repair will not be covered under the warranty.\n\nPricing and Price Reductions/Corrections\n\nApple reserves the right to change prices for products at the Apple Store at any time, and to correct inadvertent pricing errors. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment & Pricing page. If you were charged more than the posted price in an Apple Store location, see a Manager about a refund of the overcharge.\n\nShould Apple reduce the price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, visit an Apple Store location or contact Retail Customer Care at 1-800-MY-APPLE within 14 days of the price change to request a refund or credit of the difference in price. This excludes limited-time price reductions and special sales events, such as Black Friday. Price protection is limited to 10 units of a particular product and we may require that you have the product with you and/or have proof of possession to use it.\n\nPrices shown are in U.S. dollars. If you pay for your order with an international card, the price may fluctuate with exchange rates and/or your card issuer may charge foreign conversion charges and fees.\n\nOrder Acceptance/Confirmation\n\nApple may refuse or cancel any order or limit order quantity. Apple may also require additional qualifying information prior to processing any order. Once we receive your online or phone order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation does not signify acceptance of your order or constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Apple Store reserves the right to accept or decline your order at any time for any reason. If Apple cancels an order after payment, Apple will refund it.\n\nShipping & Delivery\n\nPlease review the Shipping & Pickup page to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the Apple Store. Since delivery of your order can be impacted by events beyond Apple’s control once it leaves our facilities, Apple cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery.\n\nAs Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, products shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the products. Title in the products shall pass to you when the products are picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Apple to resolve.\n\nIn-Store Pickup and Return\n\nApple offers in-store pickup for many of its products. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and order number will be required for pickup. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. We’ll also send you a reminder or two, in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Apple may cancel it. Please visit http://apple.com/us/shop/help/shipping_delivery for more details.\n\nPickup Contact\n\nIf you select in-store pickup, you may be able to designate a third party to pick up your order. You must provide their name and email address. Certain products and payment methods are not eligible for in-store pickup by a third party. The third party will need to bring a government issued photo ID and order number for pickup. Apple is not responsible for actions taken by the third party once your item(s) have been picked up.\n\nConsumers Only\n\nThe Apple Store sells and ships products to end-user customers only, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we suspect you are purchasing products for resale.\n\nU.S. Sales and Shipping Only\n\nThe Apple Store accepts orders from billing addresses within the U.S. and most U.S. territories. Products purchased online from the U.S. will only be shipped to addresses within the U.S. and are subject to U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations. Products must be purchased, sold, exported, re-exported, transferred, and used in compliance with these laws and regulations.
