Valued at over $2 trillion in 2021, it is also the most valuable technology company in the world.\n\nOriginally known for desktop computers, Apple was one of the first companies to switch to the graphical user interface (GUI) and saw success with the first Macintosh. Steve Jobs, the founder and CEO, was one of technology’s first “rockstars”, able to sell hardware as more than a tool for work.\n\nJobs resigned from Apple in 1985 and the company saw a gradual decline over the 1990s, as it struggled to compete with Microsoft on software and Windows manufacturers on hardware sales.\n\nIn a last ditch effort to save the company, Apple acquired Jobs’ company NeXT and installed him as advisor and then CEO. He turned the company’s fortunes around, launching iTunes and iPod in 2001.\n\nThe iPhone saw Apple ascend to one of the most valuable companies in the world, with revenue increasing from $37.4 billion in 2008 to $65 billion in 2010.\n\nThe success of the iPhone enabled Apple to launch new product categories, such as the iPad. Apple envisioned the tablet as a bridge between the smartphone and laptop, with the capabilities to be both.\n\nAs iPhone revenues have stagnated, Apple has looked for new ways to generate revenue from the iPhone. It launched Apple Watch in 2015, as an accessory to the iPhone which tracks various health and fitness metrics. AirPods were next, which paved the way for wireless headphones to become mainstream.\n\nIt has also built out its subscription services to include music and video streaming, video games, fitness and cloud storage. This segment alone generated $53 billion revenue in 2020, making it Apple’s second largest segment.\n\nAll eyes are on Apple’s next products, which may include a virtual reality headset and self-driving car. The past few product launches have been smaller in scope, like the HomePod and AirPod, and Apple fans are clamouring for the next iPhone.\n\nNote: Apple’s financial year ends in September.\n\nApple Key Statistics\n\nApple generated $383.2 billion revenue in 2023, 52% came from iPhone sales\n\nApple Services is the second largest division, responsible for 22% of revenue in 2023\n\n231 million iPhones, 49 million iPads and 22 million Mac and MacBook units were sold in 2023\n\nApple’s home and wearables division declined by 3.6% in 2023\n\nIt sold 75 million AirPods and 38 million Apple Watches in 2023\n\nApple Music has 93 million subscribers, Apple TV+ has 47 million\n\nApple Overview\n\nApple Revenue\n\nApple revenue increased dramatically in the 2010s, from $65 billion at the start of the decade to $274 billion by the end.
