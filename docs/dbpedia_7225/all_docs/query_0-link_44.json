        "text": "With WWDC 2024 now in the rearview mirror, Apple enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating the next major event: the fall unveiling of the new iPhone, Apple Watches, and a comprehensive update to Apple's entire OS lineup, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Until then, expect a relatively quiet summer.\n\nNow is arguably the worst time to purchase an iPhone or Apple Watch. With new models set to debut in just a few weeks, buying now means paying full price for devices that will soon be outdated, or missing out on discounts for existing devices.\n\nAlso: I upgrade my iPhone every year, but the iPhone 16 worries me - here's why\n\nThe new iPhone models are expected to bring significant upgrades, including enhanced AI capabilities and improved hardware features, while the next-generation Apple Watches should feature new health and fitness tracking capabilities, along with a revamped version of watchOS.\n\nFor those in need of tablets for work or that back-to-school frenzy, Apple has addressed -- for the most part -- the great iPad wasteland, updating the iPad Air with M2 silicon, and fitting the iPad Pro models with its new M4 chip. The iPad now also features an updated price tag -- everything else remains the same -- so that's back on the menu, but be aware that you're still buying hardware released in October 2022.\n\nBeyond that, Apple's lineup seems pretty strong, from the M3 MacBook Air systems to the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops powered by the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips (but still no M3 Ultra... yet).\n\nThe 'Naughty' list\n\nDon't buy these devices:\n\niPhone 15 and the Apple Watch line: These are a few months away from being refreshed, so unless you really don't care about getting all the cool stuff that will be exclusive to the new iPhone, along with whatever upgrades come to the wearable, I'd hold off buying for a few weeks.\n\nAirPods: As much as I love AirPods, they're getting old. The third-generation model was released two and a half years ago and is overdue for an update. Apple still sells the second-generation AirPods -- and those were released five years ago! My advice here is to stick to the second-generation AirPods Pro (technically, the version with the USB-C charging case is more of a 2.5 generation as it features a few small updates), or buy something not made by Apple.\n\niPad Mini: Released in September 2021, this tablet's age is worth keeping in mind. Two and a half years is a long time in tech. Would you pay full price for an iPhone 13, which was released at the same time? No, you wouldn't.\n\niPhone SE: Apple released this handset in March 2022 and rumor has it there won't be another one. Other rumors say the next one will launch this year, or sometime in 2025. We'll see.\n\nMac Studio: The M2-powered Mac Studio is no longer the beast it was, and given that it's over a year old and running on previous-generation silicon, I suggest giving it a miss and getting a MacBook Pro instead.\n\nApple TV: Last updated in October 2022, this device is due for a refresh alongside the iPhone, so unless you separately need a new one, wait a few months.\n\nThe 'Nice' list\n\nApple M3 MacBook Air\n\nApple's MacBook Air has an M3 chip, which has more oomph to tackle heavier-duty AI tasks.\n\nReview: M3 MacBook Air: Apple's AI computer for the masses has arrived\n\nAlong with the updated processor, this MacBook Air can also power two external monitors with the lid closed, making it a great desktop replacement -- just add two screens!\n\nWith prices for the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air starting at $1,099, and the 15-inch version starting at $200 more, these systems represent some serious processing power for an extremely competitive price (especially when you consider these are Apple laptops).\n\nApple Vision Pro\n\nApple's newest product is the company's foray into mixed-reality spatial computing.\n\nAlso: 10 reasons the Apple Vision Pro is secretly brilliant\n\nIt's hard to bet against Apple, but a futuristic set of goggles with a starting price of $3,499 doesn't feel like the easiest thing to sell. Still, Apple is Apple, and if any company can convince consumers to part with large sums of cash (and developers to create apps for a new platform that could fall flat on its face), it's Apple.\n\nApple 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\nThis lineup of MacBooks has the entire lineup of M3 chips -- from the powerful M3 to the insanely powerful M3 Max. Here are the specs:\n\nPowered by the M3, M3 Pro, or M3 Max chips\n\nUp to 22 hours of battery life\n\n8GB to 128GB of unified memory\n\n512GB to 8TB of SSD storage\n\nLiquid Retina XDR display\n\nPorts galore, with up to three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SDXC card slot, an HDMI port, a MagSafe 3 port, and a headphone jack\n\nAlso: M3 MacBook Pro buying advice: Who it's really for (and who should stick with M2 MacBook Air)\n\nApple's 24-inch iMac\n\nApple refreshed the iMac in October 2023, and while it has the same 24-inch, 4.5K Retina display, it received the M3 chip upgrade. Here are the highlights:\n\nApple M3 chip (no M3 Pro or M3 Max option)\n\n24-inch 4.5K Retina display\n\n8GB to 24GB of unified memory\n\n512GB to 2TB of SSD storage\n\nSuper-thin all-in-one desktop\n\nSeven vibrant colors\n\nAlso: Apple's M3 iMac disappoints 27-inch display devotees, but does anyone really need that?\n\n2nd-gen AirPods Pro (now with USB-C)\n\nThe AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) offer a major upgrade over the previous model, giving Apple's premium buds a massive lead over the competition. Apple has now refreshed the charging case to use USB-C rather than Lightning -- great if you have a new iPhone, but yet another cable or dongle to carry if not. Here are the highlights:\n\nActive Noise Cancellation reduces unwanted background noise\n\nAdaptive Transparency lets outside sounds in while reducing loud environmental noise\n\nPersonalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking places the sound all around you\n\nMultiple ear tips (XS, S, M, L)\n\nTouch control lets you swipe to adjust volume, press to direct media playback, answer or end calls, and press and hold to switch between listening modes\n\nSweat- and water-resistant for AirPods Pro and charging case\n\nMagSafe Charging Case with a speaker and a lanyard loop\n\nUSB-C charging\n\nAlso: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) review: Two major upgrades, tamed by one familiar flaw\n\nApple AirTag\n\nApple's AirTags are the perfect gift for someone who constantly loses things. You can add them to your luggage, your bike, your remote, or even your moving boxes -- the possibilities are endless.\n\nAlso: How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you\n\nWell-made, robust, and with a replaceable battery, these will make misplaced keys or lost wallet things of the past."
