One of the worldâs most popular brands, Apple dominates the tech industry with its top-quality products and software. Users choose to upgrade their iOS-powered devices year after year thanks to the companyâs effective marketing and production tactics. This article reviews the inner workings of the Apple business model.\n\nA Brief History of Apple\n\nApple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak officially launched the brand on April 1, 1976. The partnership of the two college dropouts brought forth sweeping ideas to motion. Working from Jobâs garage, the pair aimed to create computers that didnât take up much space in homes and offices. They introduced the hand-built Apple I computer as their first product, featuring only hardware modules.\n\nJobs and Wozniak later presented the Apple II in 1977, shifting to a fully assembled personal computer. It retailed for $1,298 during release and featured a redesigned TV interface that displayed simple text and graphics. It bested some of that yearâs competition and became a bestseller in the tech industry. They opened the product to the public and amassed a whopping $118 million in 1980.\n\nWozniak left the company in 1983, followed by Jobs in 1985 after an attempted coup against then-president John Sculley. However, Steve Jobs bought back Apple in 1997 to save the brandâs dropping market shares. His revolutionary tactics improved the numbers, eventually paving the way for the first iPhone to be introduced in 2007.\n\nThe Apple business model canvas stayed unbeatable through it all, allowing the company to reach the trillion-dollar mark in 2018. iOS devices and software became a household name, doubling its market cap in 2020.
