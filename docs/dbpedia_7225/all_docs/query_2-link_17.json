        "text": "When Carissa began her career at Apple as a part-time Specialist, her store’s leadership team had even more of an effect on her growth than she expected.\n\n“The Apple Store culture really promotes growth — people here help set you up for success. There’s the general support we all get to help us develop our careers, but the leaders here also work with your specific interests and talents. My managers saw something in me, saw that I had the potential to contribute as a leader at some point, so they nurtured that side of me. That really motivated me.”\n\nCarissa took advantage of every opportunity to build her skill set and gain more experience in different roles. Helping roll out the training program for Apple’s first wearable, Apple Watch, she found herself thriving in a range of new career experiences within the store, ultimately being promoted into management.\n\nNow, as a Senior Manager, Carissa is providing support and encouragement for her team members as they pursue their own path at Apple. “It’s now my job to help them reach their career goals, here in the store or in another part of Apple. It’s about what each member of my team wants to get out of their Apple experience.”\n\nWith that in mind, Carissa is focused on providing career opportunities for more people than ever. Having joined several of Apple’s Diversity Network Associations, she’s cultivated relationships with other managers around the world and applied what she’s learned to her work. “Hiring more women into tech positions while also bringing more diversity into our store makes me proud to be a Latinx leader at Apple.”\n\nAfter a 30-year career in video production, Tom joined the Creative team for his first experience working in retail. Everyone brings something different to their work, and Tom brought creativity and technical experience. By combining those skills with the core Apple Store training everyone receives, as well as additional Creative Pro training, he was able to build a foundation for a new career.\n\n“People come in with some incredible ideas for their projects, and they feel great when I help them bring those ideas to life. Truth is, I feel great, too.”\n\nTom helps people discover the endless possibilities of what they can do with Apple products. Drawing on his strengths as a natural teacher, he’s found success in leading Today at Apple sessions in the store as well as virtual sessions online. He also considers it a bonus that, while he’s teaching others, he picks up new bits of knowledge along the way.\n\n“I’ve learned so much by exploring different things with my customers. In the store, we have this wonderful approach to the customer experience called ‘Let’s find out together.’ I love how each conversation begins a shared interest in learning something new.”\n\nTom’s enthusiasm for connecting with others has given him a bit of a following. “Over the years, I’ve built great relationships with many of our regular customers. It’s such a joy to come to work every day, where people come in and thank me for what I love to do.”\n\nSerene wanted to work part-time while in college, and the Apple Store offered her that and more. The flexible schedule that worked around her course load was a must-have, and the education expense benefits were a love-to-have.\n\n“Working at Apple has actually made me rethink my academic goals. Through my experience as a Technical Specialist, I grew to realize how much I enjoy working with technology and switched my major to computer engineering. The tuition reimbursement program helped make that possible.”\n\nSerene believes that her store’s leadership has been instrumental in her ability to envision a long-term career at Apple after graduation. “Apple really provides you with all the resources to succeed — right now and throughout your career here. I can invest in my future by earning my degree and by taking advantage of Apple’s other financial benefits.”\n\nAs she navigates each college semester, Serene is intent on growing her experience at Apple. Next up, she’s planning on becoming a Technical Expert, and looking forward to adding new certifications and training programs to her skill set.\n\n“Believe it or not, it was kind of a childhood dream to work at the Apple Store. And now, as I focus on both my education and my career, I have new Apple dreams.”"
