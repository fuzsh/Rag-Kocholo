See the support-related materials included with your Apple product for more information.\n\nComplimentary software support provides telephone support for installation, launch, or reinstallation (not including data recovery) when your hardware configuration meets the minimum system requirements for the software. See the support-related materials included with your Apple product for more information.\n\nMost Apple software and hardware products include unlimited complimentary support incidents within the first 90 days of product ownership, or longer if required by applicable law. Apple Watch Edition and Apple Watch Herm√®s come with 2 years of complimentary support. See the support-related materials included with your Apple product or visit the AppleCare Products page for more information.\n\nApple defines a support incident as a specific, discrete issue that can be addressed by isolating its origin to a single cause. Apple, in its sole discretion, will determine what constitutes a support incident. A support incident has reached resolution when the customer receives one of the following:\n\nInformation that resolves the issue\n\nInformation on how to obtain a software solution that will resolve the issue\n\nNotice that the issue is caused by a known, unresolved issue or an incompatibility issue with the supported product\n\nInformation that identifies the issue as being resolved by upgrading to a newer release of the supported product\n\nNotice that the issue has been identified as a hardware equipment issue\n\nInformation that isolates issue to a third-party product, not supported by Apple"
