        "text": "Apple Business Model focuses primarily on selling its products and offering services through subscriptions. Sales of Apple products like the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook make up a large percentage of Apple’s revenue, while its services include Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, iCloud+, and Apple Arcade, although a small percentage of its revenue, net them a whopping average of $13 billion per quarter.\n\nApple has surpassed the trillion-dollar market cap mark through its business model, making it the first company to ever manage such a feat.\n\nA brief history of Apple:\n\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, two college dropouts, founded Apple on April 1, 1976, using Jobs’ garage as their main office. They aimed to revolutionize the way people saw computers. They wanted to make computers small enough to fit in people’s homes and offices. In effect, their first product, the Apple 1 — a hand-built computer —, included only functional hardware modules like CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips, and excluded features like monitors, keyboards, and other Human Interface Devices.\n\nOn their second product, the Apple II, expansion slots were included for attaching floppy disk drives and other components and Human Interface Devices. This second product increased their sales from $7.8 million in 1978 to $118 million in 1980 (when they went public).\n\nA few years later, in 1983, Wozniak left the company, and Jobs followed suit in 1985, after hiring PepsiCo’s John Sculley as president. He was ousted after the growing friction between him and Sculley resulted in him organizing a ‘coup’ to remove Sculley. This coup backfired, however.\n\nSteve Jobs founded his NeXT software company soon afterward, after buying Pixar from George Lucas. However, his departure was short-lived, and in 1997 Apple bought his company. This was done to bring him back to the company in order to save their declining market shares. The changes he implemented after coming back saved the company from impending doom, and in 2007, they launched one of their most successful product, the iPhone.\n\nThey have launched other successful products and services since then, which helped them become the first company ever to cross the trillion-dollar mark, this was in 2018. In 2020, they doubled their market cap by doubling down on their highly successful business model.\n\nWho Owns Apple:\n\nAccording to 2021 shareholder data, Apple’s major shareholders included corporations like The Vanguard Group (7.68%), BlackRock, Inc. (6.47%), Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

This community also enables Apple to have a somewhat stable revenue proposition.\n\nApple’s Weaknesses\n\nPricing Strategy: Apple’s prices make it a luxury company in developing countries, thus driving away most middle-class and lower-class potential customers;\n\nApple’s Opportunities\n\nProducts and Pricing Strategy: Although being partially implemented, the design and manufacturing of products aimed at middle-class and lower-class consumers will enable Apple to increase its already high revenue and market cap.\n\nApple’s Threats\n\nMarket Trends: As a result of Apple’s yearly release of products, the market trend is a big factor that determines the revenue yield of its new line-up of devices. Because most customers already have recent versions of their products or do not have plans of purchasing new ones, Apple’s yearly revenue yield at new product launches seems to be reducing year by year, and will most likely continue;\n\nCompetition: Competitors like Samsung are already affecting Apple’s customer base via their offering of flexible and customizable OS in their products. The arrival of better competitors aimed at the high and middle classes of developed countries will most likely affect Apple’s user base.\n\n-> Read More About Apple’s SWOT Analysis.\n\nConclusion"
