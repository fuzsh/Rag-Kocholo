Svante Arrhenius was born on February 19, 1859, in Vik, Sweden. Since he was young, he had been very interested with physics and mathematics.

He initially studied at University of Uppsala but he was not contented with the professor’s teaching so he sought a better university. He entered the Physical Institute of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, where he was guided by Erik Edlund, in 1881.

1880 – His dissertation stated that “neither pure salt nor pure water is a conductor.” The 15-page dissertation did not impress his professors, but attained applause and appreciation from several scientists in Europe , working on the development of the new science of physical chemistry.

1886 – He received a grant from the Swedish Academy of Sciences where he had a chance to study with Wilhelm Ostwald in Riga, with Friedrich Kohlrausch in Wurzburg, Ludwig Boltzmann in Austria, and J. H. van ‘t Hoff in Amsterdam.

1889 – He proposed what is known as the Arrhenius equation, a formula that exemplifies the temperature dependence of reaction rate. In particular, he has shown that heat speeds up the reaction rate of various chemicals.

1900 – He was one of the founders of the Nobel Institute and the Nobel Prizes. He became a part of the Nobel Committee on Physics, and a de facto member of the Nobel Committee on Chemistry. He used his position to award friends, namely Jacobus van ‘t Hoff, Wilhelm Ostwald and Theodore Richards, with Nobel Prizes.

1903 – He received his own Nobel Prize in chemistry, becoming the first Swede to receive the prestigious award.

1905 – He became the rector of the newly founded Nobel Institute of Physical Research at Stockholm, where he stayed until he retired in 1927.

Svante Arrhenius also researched topics such as astronomy, immunology, osmosis, toxins and antitoxins, the effect of carbon dioxide levels on climate, and the origin of life. He was also on the board of Swedish Society for Racial Hygiene (Eugenics).

His books include:

Världarnas utveckling (1906, Worlds in the making)

Smittkopporna och deras bekämpande (1913, Smallpox and its combating)

Stjärnornas Öden (1915, Destiny of the Stars)

Kemien och det moderna livet (1919, Chemistry and modern life).

Svante Arrhenius certainly reached success. “No one should ever bring you down” – a mantra that could sum up how Svante Arrhenius reached his stardom. He was not discouraged in spite of being neglected and unappreciated by the senior chemists during his younger years. Because of his drive, he then reached the pedestal.

In October 2, 1927, he died in Stockholm due to acute intestinal catarrh. His body was buried in Uppsala.
