        "text": "[page 2]\n\nThis leaves me with only a few more exams to proctor at the university. During the first year, the laboratory will be provisional and located in my living quarters. After a year, I will acquire a first-rate location at the current navigation school, which has a wonderful view of the city. I will probably stay there as long as I continue to conduct experiments.\n\nMy bride is a sister of the physiology professor J.E Johansson, one of my dearest friends. She is very similar to him, which motivated me to ask for her hand in marriage. We have been engaged since 26. April and we want to get married in early September. After I got engaged, I was delighted to discover hat we are a perfect match for each other.\n\nIn the autumn, I will begin a new life to a certain extent.\n\n[page 3]\n\nI am hopeful that our union will be very happy.\n\nI am now busy editing my American lectures. It's unbelievable how much time it takes. I must look up and double check everything. I'm going on a trip on 14. June. First, I will visit my mother in Upsala. She is very old (85 years) and weak. However, I hope she will live for several more years. On 18. June, I will visit my mother-in-law in Ratevik, Dalecadien, travel to Gothenburg, and then arrive in Copenhagen around the 30. June to continue working with Madsen. On 20. July, I will return home to prepare for a trip in August with my friend Kobb to see the solar eclipse in Spain. I must be back here for exams in early September.\n\nA Finnish man, Oholm, will visit you.\n\n[page 4]\n\nHe worked well with me on the topic of diffusion and is a very nice man. I will be very grateful to you as I was with Wegelius.\n\nI am very happy to hear that you enjoy your work. This is what Ostwald lacks. Fortunately, I also look forward to my work, which is a great gift. I am extremely interested to hear news about your work. The “lovely muse” comforts you guiltlessly in times of difficulty and sorrow. (May Haber have that feeling too. I haven't seen his gas reactions yet). Euler is in Paris at the Pasteur Institute. He is expected to become Professor of Chemistry in the autumn. A second position was established along with Pettersson’s. I'll see Ekholm soon and say hello. Pettersson traveled to the countryside a week ago.\n\nBest regards to you and your wife. My bride also says hello.\n\nYour loyal, old friend,\n\nSvante Arrhenius"
