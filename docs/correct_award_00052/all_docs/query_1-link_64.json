        "text": "Illness and Rebirth\n\nURING THE PRESS FRENZY Curie received a telegram informing her that she had been given an unprecedented second Nobel Prize, this time in chemistry. Although severely shaken by the scandal, she mustered the strength to attend the award ceremony, accompanied by her sister Bronya and her daughter Irène. At the ceremony on December 10, 1911, the president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences explained why Curie's 1898 discovery of two new elements deserved this additional recognition. It had not only revolutionized scientific understanding of the nature of the atom but had also opened up new areas of medicine and even helped measure the age of the earth. In her lecture the following day, Curie reasserted her claim to be the first to see that radioactivity was a property built into atoms.\n\nSvante Arrhenius, an influential Swedish physicist on the Nobel committee, at first encouraged Curie to accept the award in person, but when the scandal deepened he advised her to decline it until her name was cleared.\n\nHertha Ayrton, in whose company Curie recuperated during the summer of 1912, had first met the Curies in June 1903, when Pierre addressed the Royal Institution in London. (courtesy IEE)\n\nThe stress of the past several months took its toll on Curie. Suffering from severe depression and acute kidney problems, she spent most of January 1912 in a private clinic, registered under an assumed name. In March she underwent a kidney operation. She spent months recuperating in a house near Paris, rented under the name Madame Sklodowska. Feeling unworthy of Pierre's name, she even forbade Irène to address letters to her as Madame Curie.\n\nLUDING THE PRESS remained her highest priority. In late July, still using the name Sklodowska, she traveled to England, where she spent the rest of the summer with her friend and colleague Hertha Ayrton. Like Curie, Ayrton was not only the widow of a distinguished physicist but also an important practicing physicist herself. The two women were joined in their rented house near the seashore by Curie's daughters and their Polish governess."
