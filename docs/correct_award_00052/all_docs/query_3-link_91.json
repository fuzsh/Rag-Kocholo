What is remarkable is that through a combination of skill and luck he came within a factor of two of the IPCC estimate. His calculations were important only in a qualitative way in showing that this was a significant effect. Arrhenius expected CO2 levels to rise at a rate given by emissions at his time. Since then, industrial carbon dioxide levels have risen at a much faster rate: Arrhenius expected CO2 doubling to take about 3000 years; it is now generally expected to take about a century.\n\nSVANTE AUGUST ARRHENIUS\n\nBorn February 19, 1859 Vik, Sweden\n\nDied October 2, 1927 Stockholm, Sweden\n\nResidence Sweden\n\nNationality Sweden\n\nField Physical chemist\n\nInstitution Royal Institute of Technology\n\nAlma Mater University of Uppsala University of Stockholm\n\nDoctoral Advisor Eric Edlund\n\nDoctoral Students Oskar Benjamin Klein\n\nKnown for Arrhenius equation\n\nNotable Prizes Nobel Prize for Chemistry\n\n(1903)\n\nSvante August Arrhenius (February 19,\n\n1859 – October 2, 1927) was a Swedish chemist and one of the founders of the science of physical chemistry. The Arrhenius equation and the lunar crater Arrhenius\n\nare named after him.\n\nEarly years\n\nArrhenius was born at Vik (also spelled Wik or Wijk), near Uppsala,\n\nSweden, the son of Svante Gustav and Carolina Thunberg\n\nArrhenius. His father had been a land surveyor for Uppsala University, moving up to a supervisory\n\nposition. At the age of three, Arrhenius taught himself to read, despite his parents’\n\nwishes, and by watching his father’s addition of numbers in his account books, became an arithmetical prodigy.\n\nIn later life, Arrhenius enjoyed using masses of data to discover mathematical\n\nrelationships and laws. At age 8, he entered the local cathedral school, starting in the fifth grade, distinguishing himself in physics and mathematics, and\n\ngraduating as the youngest and most able student in 1876.\n\nAt the University of Uppsala, he was unsatisfied with the chief instructor of physics\n\nand the only faculty member who could have supervised him in chemistry, so he left to\n\nstudy at the Physical Institute of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm under the physicist Erik Edlund in 1881. His work specialized on the conductivities of electrolytes.\n\nIn 1884, based on this work, he submitted a 150-page dissertation\n\non electrolytic conductivity to Uppsala for the doctorate.\n\nIt did not impress the professors, and he received the lowest possible passing grade.\n\nLater this very work would earn him the Nobel\n\nPrize in Chemistry.\n\nThere were 56 theses put forth in the 1884 dissertation, and most would still be\n\naccepted today unchanged or with minor modifications. The most important idea in the\n\ndissertation was his explanation of the fact that neither pure salts\n\nnor pure water is a conductor,\n\nbut solutions of salts in water are.\n\nArrhenius’ explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into\n\ncharged particles (which Michael Faraday had given the\n\nname ions many years earlier). Faraday’s belief had been that ions\n\nwere produced in the process of electrolysis; Arrhenius\n\nproposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, solutions of salts contained\n\nions. He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions.\n\nFor weak electrolytes this is still believed to be the case, but modifications (by Peter J. W. Debye and Erich\n\nHückel) were found necessary to account for the behavior of strong electrolytes.\n\nThe dissertation was not very impressive to the professors at Uppsala, but Arrhenius\n\nsent it to a number of scientists in Europe who were developing the new science of physical chemistry, such as Rudolf Clausius, Wilhelm\n\nOstwald, and J. H. van ‘t Hoff. They were far\n\nmore impressed, and Ostwald even came to Uppsala to persuade Arrhenius to join his\n\nresearch team. Arrhenius declined, however, as he preferred to stay in Sweden for a while\n\n(his father was very ill and would die in 1885) and had received\n\nan appointment at Uppsala.\n\nMiddle period\n\nArrhenius next received a travel grant from the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which\n\nenabled him to study with Ostwald in Riga (now in Latvia), with Friedrich\n\nKohlrausch in Würzburg, Germany,\n\nwith Ludwig Boltzmann in Graz, Austria, and with van ‘t Hoff in Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1889 Arrhenius explained the fact that most reactions\n\nrequire added heat energy to proceed by formulating the concept of activation energy, an energy barrier that must be\n\novercome before two molecules will react. The Arrhenius\n\nequation gives the quantitative basis of the relationship between the activation\n\nenergy and the rate at which a reaction proceeds.\n\nIn 1891 he became a lecturer at Stockholms Högskola\n\n(now Stockholm University), being promoted to\n\nprofessor of physics (with much opposition) in 1895, and rector in 1896.\n\nHe was married twice, to Sofia Rudbeck, (who bore him one son) from 1894 to 1896, and to Maria Johansson (who\n\nbore him two daughters and a son), from 1905 onward.\n\nIn 1901 Arrhenius was elected to the Swedish Academy of\n\nSciences, against strong opposition. In 1903 he became the first\n\nSwede to be awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry.\n\nIn 1905, upon the founding of the Nobel Institute for Physical\n\nResearch at Stockholm, he was appointed rector of the\n\ninstitute, the position where he remained until retirement in 1927.\n\nLater years\n\nEventually, Arrhenius’ theories became generally accepted and he turned to other\n\nscientific topics. In 1902 he began to investigate physiological problems in terms of\n\nchemical theory. He determined that reactions in living organisms and in the test tube\n\nfollowed the same laws. In 1904 he delivered at the university of California a course of\n\nlectures, the object of which was to illustrate the application of the methods of physical\n\nchemistry to the study of the theory of toxins and antitoxins, and which were published in\n\n1907 under the title Immunochemistry. He also turned his attention to geology (the origin of ice ages), astronomy, physical\n\ncosmology, and astrophysics, accounting for the birth\n\nof the solar system by interstellar collision. He\n\nconsidered radiation pressure as accounting for comets, the solar corona, the aurora borealis, and zodiacal\n\nlight.\n\nHe thought life might have been carried from planet to planet by the transport of spores, the theory now known as panspermia.\n\nHe thought of the idea of a universal language, proposing a modification of the English language.\n\nIn an extension of his ionic\n\ntheory Arrhenius proposed definitions for acids and bases, in 1884. He believed that acids were substances which\n\nproduce hydrogen ions in solution and that bases were substances which produce hydroxide\n\nions in solution.\n\nIn his last years he wrote both textbooks and popular books, trying to emphasize the\n\nneed for further work on the topics he discussed.\n\nIn September, 1927, he came down with an attack of acute intestinal\n\ncatarrh, died on October 2, and\n\nwas buried in Uppsala.\n\nGreenhouse effect as cause for ice ages\n\nSvante Arrhenius developed a theory to explain the ice ages, and first formulated the idea\n\nthat changes in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could substantially alter\n\nthe surface temperature through the greenhouse effect (“On the Influence of\n\nCarbonic Acid in the Air Upon the Temperature of the Ground“, Philosophical Magazine 1896(41): 237-76). He was influenced\n\nby the work of others, including Joseph\n\nFourier‘s argument that the earth’s atmosphere\n\nacted like the glass of a hot-house. Arrhenius used the infrared observations of the moon\n\nby Frank Washington Very and Samuel Pierpont Langley at the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh to calculate the absorption of CO2 and\n\nwater vapour. Using the just published Stefan’s\n\nlaw he formulated his greenhouse law. In its\n\noriginal form, Arrhenius’ greenhouse law reads as follows:\n\nif the quantity of carbonic acid increases in geometric progression, the augmentation of\n\nthe temperature will increase nearly in arithmetic progression.\n\nWhich is still valid in the simplified expression by Myhre et al(1998).\n\ndelta F = a ln(C/C0)\n\nArrhenius’ high absorption values for CO2, however, met criticism by Knut Ångström in 1900, who published the first modern infrared spectrum of CO2\n\nwith two absorption bands. Arrhenius replied strongly in 1901 (Annalen der Physik),\n\ndismissing the critique altogether. He touched the subject briefly in a technical book\n\ntitled Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik (1903). He later wrote Världarnas\n\nutveckling (1906), German translation: Das Werden der Welten (1907), English\n\ntranslation: Worlds in the Making (1908) directed at a general audience, where the\n\nsuggested that the human emission of CO2 would be strong enough to prevent the\n\nworld from entering a new ice age, and that a warmer earth would be needed to feed the\n\nrapidly increasing population. From that, the hot-house theory gained more attention.\n\nNevertheless, until about 1960, most scientists dismissed the hot-house / greenhouse\n\neffect as implausible for the cause of ice ages as Milutin Milankovitch had presented a mechanism using orbital changes of the earth.\n\nArhenius estimated that a doubling of CO2 would cause a temperature rise of\n\n5 degrees Celsius [1], recent values from IPCC place this\n\nvalue (the Climate sensitivity) at between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees. What is remarkable is that\n\nthrough a combination of skill and luck he came within a factor of two of the IPCC\n\nestimate. His calculations were important only in a qualitative way in showing that this\n\nwas a significant effect. Arrhenius expected CO2 levels to rise at a rate given\n\nby emissions at his time. Since then, industrial carbon dioxide levels have risen at a\n\nmuch faster rate: Arrhenius expected CO2 doubling to take about 3000 years; it\n\nis now generally expected to take about a century.\n\nSee also\n\nArrhenius equation Acid-base\n\nreaction theories\n\nReferences\n\nSvante Arrhenius, 1884, Recherches sur la conductivité galvanique des électrolytes,\n\ndoctoral dissertation, Stockholm, Royal Publishing House, P.A.
