        "text": "This week in the Connection Finder, we're featuring Nobel Laureates, starting with Marie Curie, Nobel Prize winner in Physics for her research on radioactivity. We want to honor the recently awarded Nobel Prizes and Alfred Nobel's birthday.\n\nFeatured alongside her are others who've won Nobel prizes:\n\nJohn Northrop, Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work with enzymes, proteins, and viruses.\n\nSir Lawrence Bragg, Nobel Prize in Physics for work on crystal structures by means of X-rays.\n\nGerty Radnitz Cori, Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for the discovery of the mechanism by which glycogen—a derivative of glucose—is broken down in muscle tissue into lactic acid and then resynthesized in the body and stored as a source of energy (known as the Cori cycle).\n\nSvante Arrhenius, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, \"in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered to the advancement of chemistry by his electrolytic theory of dissociation.\"\n\nBjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Nobel Prize in Literature \"as a tribute to his noble, magnificent and versatile poetry, which has always been distinguished by both the freshness of its inspiration and the rare purity of its spirit.\"\n\nAlbert Michelson, Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the speed of light.\n\nGuglielmo Marconi, Nobel Prize in Physics for work in wireless telegraphy.\n\nPearl S. Buck, Nobel Prize in Literature for \"The Good Earth's\" description of rural life in China.\n\nSinclair Lewis, Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humour, new types of characters\" (following the publication of \"Dodsworth\").\n\nRoger Sperry, Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for split-brain research.\n\nGeorge Beadle, Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for work in genetics.\n\nWho are you most closely connected to? If you're one of the 23,937,000 of us who are connected to each other on our big tree you can check with the Connection Finder.\n\nYou can check for shared ancestors with the Relationship Finder. Are you a cousin to any of them? Your Relationship Finder Quick Links page (see your profile pull-down menu under \"Relationships\") has quick links for several notable groups.\n\nSpecial feature: Check out how you're connected to other Nobel Laureates by searching the Nobel Laureates category and related categories like Physicists and Authors using the green MyConnections button in the upper right hand corner of the page.\n\nLet us know how you're related below! If you want to share your connection on social media with cousins and friends, click the \"get shareable image\" below the results, e.g. Marie Curie and Alfred Nobel. Then just upload it along with the URL of your direct connection. (Please refrain from sharing your connection on the featured profiles themselves, though. It clutters conversations on research and collaboration. Thanks!)"
