        "text": "Year\n\nWinner\n\nCountry*\n\nAchievement\n\n1901\n\nHoff van't, Jacobus H\n\nNetherlands\n\nfor work on rates of reaction, chemical equilibrium, and osmotic pressure\n\n1902\n\nFischer, Emil\n\nGermany\n\nFischer's research on the purines was instituted in 1881. He determined the structures of uric acid, xanthine, caffeine, theobromine, and other related compounds, and he showed that they are all derivatives of a single compound, a nitrogenous base that he named purine.\n\nDespite major complications because of stereochemical relations, Fischer was able to use these derivatives to determine the molecular structures of fructose, glucose, and many other sugars, and he was able to verify his results by synthesizing those compounds. He also showed how to distinguish the formulas of the 16 stereoisometric glucoses. In the course of his stereochemical research, Fischer discovered that there are two series of sugars, the D sugars and the L sugars, that are mirror images of each other. His study of sugars led him to investigate the reactions and substances involved in fermentation, and, in his investigations of how enzymes break down sugars, Fischer laid the foundations for enzyme chemistry.\n\n1903\n\nArrhenius, Svante\n\nSweden\n\ntheory of electrolytic dissociation.\n\nArrhenius not only proposed that acids and bases break up into ions, but he used ions to explain neutralization reactions and electrical conductivity of solutions.\n\n1904\n\nRamsay, Sir William\n\nU.K.\n\ndiscovery of inert gas elements and their places in the periodic system.\n\nThrough fractional distillation and spectral analysis of liquid argon from liquid air, Ramsay discovered neon, krypton and xenon.\n\n1905\n\nBaeyer, Adolf von\n\nGermany\n\nNotable among Baeyer's many achievements were the discovery of the phthalein dyes(including indigo) and his investigations of uric acid derivatives, polyacetylenes, and oxonium salts. One derivative of uric acid that he discovered was barbituric acid, the parent compound of the sedative-hypnotic drugs known as barbiturates.\n\nBaeyer proposed a \"strain\" (Spannung) theory that helped explain why carbon rings of five or six atoms are so much more common than carbon rings with other numbers of atoms.\n\n1906\n\nMoissan, Henri\n\nFrance\n\nisolation of fluorine; introduction of Moissan furnace\n\nBy electrolysis of HF, Moissan isolated fluorine and remarked that it could attack even cold silicon, burning it with occasional sparks.\n\n1907\n\nBuchner, Eduard\n\nGermany\n\nfor demonstrating that the fermentation of carbohydrates results from the action of different enzymes contained in yeast and not the yeast cell itself. He showed that an enzyme, zymase, can be extracted from yeast cells and that it causes sugar to break up into carbon dioxide and alcohol.\n\n1908\n\nRutherford, Ernest\n\nU.K.\n\ninvestigations into the disintegration of elements and the chemistry of radioactive substances\n\nHis research with alpha particles led him to propose a model of the atom in which most of the atom's mass was concentrated in a small positive nucleus.\n\n1909\n\nOstwald, Wilhelm\n\nGermany\n\npioneer work on catalysis, chemical equilibrium, and reaction velocities\n\nOstwald showed that acidic ions that play a role in catalysis are also released by the reactants themselves, thus compensating for the consumption of the acid added initially.\n\n1911\n\nCurie, Marie\n\nFrance\n\ndiscovery of radium and polonium; isolation of radium\n\n1912\n\nGrignard, Victor\n\nFrance\n\ndiscovery of the Grignard reagents, consisting of organometallic compounds in which a negatively polarized carbon can add itself and its adjacent atoms to an organic compound containing an electrophilic site\n\nSabatier, Paul\n\nFrance\n\nfor his method of hydrogenating organic compounds in the presence of finely disintegrated metals. In 1897 he reduced ethylene to ethane with hydrogen using nickel as a catalyst and eventually extended his approach to wide variety of organic compounds.\n\n1913\n\nWerner, Alfred\n\nSwitzerland\n\nfor coordination theory, which permitted a simple classification of inorganic compounds and extended the concept of isomerism\n\n1914\n\nRichards, Theodore William\n\nU.S.\n\naccurate determination of the atomic weights of numerous elements\n\nRichards improved the determination of atomic masses; by modern standards, they were accurate to three decimal places, paving the way for the discovery of isotopes.\n\n1915\n\nWillstätter, Richard\n\nGermany\n\npioneer researches in plant pigments, especially chlorophyll\n\n1916-17\n\nNo Prizes awarded\n\n1918\n\nHaber, Fritz\n\nGermany\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century the rapidly increasing demand for nitrogen fertilizer greatly exceeded the supply, which still came mainly from Chilean nitrate. The problem of utilizing atmospheric nitrogen for this purpose had become of worldwide concern. (See nitrogen fixation.) Haber developed a method for synthesizing ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, and by 1909 he had established conditions for the large-scale synthesis of ammonia. The process was handed over to Carl Bosch of Badische Anilin- & Soda-Fabrik for industrial development, leading to the Haber-Bosch process.\n\n1919\n\nNo Prize awarded\n\n1920\n\nNernst, Walther Hermann\n\nGermany\n\nwork in thermochemistry\n\nHis third law states that at absolute zero (0 K) the entropy of every substance is zero.\n\n1921\n\nSoddy, Frederick\n\nU.K.\n\nchemistry of radioactive substances; occurrence and nature of isotopes\n\n1922\n\nAston, Francis William\n\nU.K.\n\nwork with mass spectrograph; whole-number rule\n\nBy using a mass spectograph, which separates particles of different masses by a magnetic field, he showed that most elements were a mixture of different isotopes. He calso came up with the whole number rule, which states that the mass of a specific isotope is a whole number.\n\n1923\n\nPregl, Fritz\n\nAustria\n\nmethod of microanalysis of organic substances\n\n1924 No Prize awarded\n\n1925\n\nZsigmondy, Richard\n\nAustria\n\nelucidation of the heterogeneous nature of colloidal solutions\n\n1926\n\nSvedberg, Theodor H.E.\n\nSweden\n\nfor his studies in the chemistry of colloids and for his invention of the ultracentrifuge, which he used to determine precisely the molecular weights of highly complex proteins such as hemoglobin\n\n1927\n\nWieland, Heinrich Otto\n\nGermany\n\nfor his determination of the molecular structure of bile acids.\n\n1928\n\nWindaus, Adolf\n\nGermany\n\nWindaus discovered 7-dehydrocholesterol , which is the chemical precursor of vitamin D, and he showed that it is a steroid.\n\nHe discovered that it is converted into the vitamin when one of its chemical bonds is broken by the action of sunlight. This explained why exposure to sunlight can prevent vitamin D deficiency (rickets) in humans. Windaus' research also helped establish the chemistry of the sex hormones and advanced the development of drugs used to treat heart ailments\n\nHarden, Sir Arthur\n\nU.K.\n\nHis more than 20 years of study of the fermentation of sugar advanced knowledge of intermediary metabolic processes in all living forms. He also pioneered in studies of bacterial enzymes and metabolism.\n\n1930\n\nFischer, Hans\n\nGermany\n\nHemin is a crystalline product of hemoglobin. By splitting in half the molecule of bilirubin, a bile pigment related to hemin, Fischer obtained a new acid in which a section of the hemin molecule was still intact. Fischer identified its structure and found it to be related to pyrrole.\n\nThis made possible the artificial synthesis of hemin from simpler organic compounds whose structure was known. Fischer also showed that there is a close relationship between hemin and chlorophyll, and by the time of his death he had nearly completed the synthesis of chlorophyll.\n\n1931\n\nBergius, Friedrich\n\nGermany\n\ninvention and development of chemical high-pressure methods. These studies led to his work on converting coal into liquid hydrocarbons.\n\n1932\n\nLangmuir, Irving\n\nU.S.\n\ndiscoveries and investigations in surface chemistry. Langmuir's studies of molecular films on solid and liquid surfaces opened new fields in colloid research and biochemistry.\n\n1934\n\nUrey, Harold C.\n\nU.S.\n\ndiscovery of hydrogen's heavy isotope deuterium\n\n1935\n\nJoliot-Curie, Frédéric\n\nFrance\n\nsynthesis of new radioactive elements\n\nIrène Curie\n\n1936\n\nDebye, Peter\n\nNetherlands\n\nfor their work on dipole moments and diffraction of X rays and electrons in gases\n\nDebye helped reveal the nature of polar molecules,which have an overall positive and negative parts to them. He did this by studying their alignments in magnetic fields.\n\n1937\n\nHaworth, Sir Norman\n\nU.K.\n\nIn 1934, with the British chemist Sir Edmund Hirst, he succeeded in synthesizing vitamin C, the first to be artificially produced.\n\nThis accomplishment not only constituted a valuable addition to knowledge of organic chemistry but also made possible the cheap production of vitamin C (or ascorbic acid, as Haworth called it) for medical purposes.\n\nKarrer, Paul\n\nSwitzerland\n\nKarrer's best-known researches were on plant pigments, particularly the yellow ones (carotenoids), which are related to the pigment in carrots. He not only elucidated the chemical structure of the carotenoids but also showed that some of these substances are transformed into vitamin A in the animal body. In 1930 he established the correct formula for carotene--\n\nthe chief precursor of vitamin A--and this was the first time that the chemical structure of a vitamin had been established. Shortly afterward he was able to determine the constitution of vitamin A itself.\n\n1938\n\nKuhn, Richard (declined)\n\nGermany\n\nKuhn investigated the structure of compounds related to the carotenoids, the fat-soluble yellow colouring agents widely distributed in nature. He discovered at least eight carotenoids, prepared them in pure form, and determined their constitution. He discovered that one was necessary for the fertilization of certain algae. Simultaneously with Paul Karrer he announced the constitution of vitamin B2 and was the first to isolate a gram of it. With coworkers he also isolated vitamin B6.\n\n1939\n\nButenandt, Adolf (declined)\n\nGermany\n\nIn 1929, almost simultaneously with Edward A. Doisy in the United States, Butenandt isolated estrone, one of the hormones responsible for sexual development and function in females.\n\nIn 1931 he isolated and identified androsterone, a male sex hormone, and in 1934, the hormone progesterone, which plays an important part in the female reproductive cycle. It was now clear that sex hormones are closely related to steroids, and after Ruzicka showed that cholesterol could be transformed into androsterone, he and Butenandt were able to synthesize both progesterone and the male hormone testosterone. Butenandt's investigations made possible the eventual synthesis of cortisone and other steroids and led to the development of birth control pills.\n\n1943\n\nHevesy, Georg Charles von\n\nHungary\n\nfor the use of isotopes as tracers in chemical research\n\n1944\n\nHahn, Otto\n\nGermany\n\nfor the discovery of the fission of heavy nuclei\n\n1945\n\nVirtanen, Artturi Ilmari\n\nFinland\n\nKnowing that the fermentation product, lactic acid, increases the acidity of the silage to a point at which destructive fermentation ceases, he developed a procedure (known by his initials, AIV) for adding dilute hydrochloric or sulfuric acid to newly stored silage, thereby increasing the acidity of the fodder beyond that point. In a series of experiments (1928-29), he showed that acid treatment has no adverse effect on the nutritive value and edibility of the fodder and of products derived from animals fed the fodder.\n\n1946\n\nNorthrop, John Howard\n\nU.S.\n\npreparation of enzymes and virus proteins in pure form. He crystallized pepsin, a digestive enzyme present in gastric juice, in 1930 and found that it is a protein, thus resolving the dispute over what enzymes are. Using the same chemical methods, he isolated in 1938 the first bacterial virus (bacteriophage), which he proved to be a nucleoprotein. Northrop also helped isolate and prepare in crystalline form pepsin's inactive precursor pepsinogen (which is converted to the active enzyme through a reaction with hydrochloric acid in the stomach); the pancreatic digestive enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin; and their inactive precursors trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen.\n\nStanley, Wendell Meredith\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the preparation of enzymes and virus proteins in pure form. In 1935 Stanley crystallized tobacco mosaic virus (TMV, the causative agent of a plant disease) and showed that it is a rod-shaped aggregate of protein and nucleic acid molecules. His work enabled other scientists, utilizing methods of X-ray diffraction, to ascertain unambiguously the precise molecular structures and the modes of propagation of several viruses.\n\nSumner, James Batcheller\n\nU.S.\n\nAfter crystallizing the enzyme urease in 1926, Sumner went to Stockholm to study with Hans von Euler-Chelpin and Theodor (The) Svedberg. He crystallized the enzyme catalase in 1937 and also contributed to the purification of several other enzymes.\n\n1947\n\nRobinson, Sir Robert\n\nU.K.\n\nHis most important studies were undertaken on alkaloids; these are complex, naturally occurring, nitrogen-containing compounds that can have profound biochemical effects on living things. Robinson's efforts to determine the chemical reactions that form alkaloids in plants led him to discover the structures of morphine (1925) and strychnine (1946).\n\n1948\n\nTiselius, Arne\n\nSweden\n\nfor their researches in electrophoresis and adsorption analysis. He used electrophoretic methods to separate the chemically similar proteins of blood serum\n\n1949\n\nGiauque, William Francis\n\nU.S.\n\nfor revealing the behaviour of substances at extremely low temperatures. His research confirmed the third law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of ordered solids reaches zero at the absolute zero of temperature. In the course of his low-temperature studies of oxygen, Giauque discovered with Herrick L. Johnston the oxygen isotopes of mass 17 and 18.\n\n1950\n\nAlder, Kurt\n\nWest Germany\n\nfor the discovery and development of diene synthesis. The diene synthesis consists essentially of the linking of a diene, which is a substance containing two alternate double bonds, to a dienophile, which is a compound containing a pair of doubly or triply bonded carbon atoms. The diene and dienophile readily react to form a six-membered ring compound. Similar reactions had been recorded by others, but it was Alder and Diels who provided the first experimental proof of the nature of the reaction and demonstrated its application to the synthesis of a wide range of ring compounds. Diene synthesis can be effected without the use of powerful chemical reagents. It has been used to synthesize such complex molecules as morphine, reserpine, cortisone and other steroids, the insecticides dieldrin and aldrin, and other alkaloids and polymers.\n\nDiels, Otto Paul Hermann\n\nWest Germany\n\n1951\n\nMcMillan, Edwin Mattison\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the discovery of and research on transuranium elements\n\nSeaborg, Glenn T.\n\nU.S.\n\n1952\n\nMartin, A.J.P.\n\nU.K.\n\nfor the development of partition chromatography. Martin and Synge invented paper partition chromotography in 1944. Partition chromatography depends on the partition, or distribution, of each component of a mixture between two immiscible liquids. One of the liquids is held stationary by strong adsorption on the surface of a finely divided solid while the other flows through the interstices of the solid particles. Any substance that preferentially dissolves in the mobile liquid is more rapidly transported in the direction of flow than is a substance that has greater affinity for the stationary liquid.\n\nSynge, R.L.M.\n\nU.K.\n\n1953\n\nStaudinger, Hermann\n\nWest Germany\n\nfor their work on macromolecules; devised a relationship between viscosity and molecular weight\n\n1954\n\nPauling, Linus\n\nU.S.\n\nstudy of the nature of the chemical bond; introduced hybridization. In order to account for the equivalency of the four bonds around the carbon atom, he introduced the concept of hybrid orbitals, in which electron orbits are moved from their original positions by mutual repulsion. Pauling also recognized the presence of hybrid orbitals in the coordination of ions or groups of ions in a definite geometric arrangement about a central ion. His theory of directed (positive and negative) valence (the capacity of an atom to combine with other atoms) was an outgrowth of his early work, as was the concept of the partial ionic character of covalent bonds--i.e., atoms sharing electrons. His empirical concept of electronegativity, the power of attraction for electrons in a covalent bond, was useful in further clarification of these problems. In the case of compounds whose molecules cannot be represented unambiguously by a single structure, he introduced the concept of resonance hybrids whereby the true structure of the molecule is regarded as an intermediate state between two or more depictable structures. The resonance theory came under heavy but unsuccessful attack in the U.S.S.R. in 1951 when doctrinaire scientists of the Communist Party argued that it conflicted with dialectical materialist principles.\n\n1955\n\ndu Vigneaud, Vincent\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the isolation and synthesis of two pituitary hormones: vasopressin, which acts on the muscles of the blood vessels to cause elevation of blood pressure; and oxytocin, the principal agent causing contraction of the uterus and secretion of milk.\n\n1956\n\nHinshelwood, Sir Cyril Norman\n\nU.K.\n\nfor their work on the kinetics of chemical reactions\n\nThey studied chain mechanisms (a series of in between steps between the reactant and product in a reaction) involving free radicals (atoms or molecules with an unpaired electron)\n\nSemyonov, Nikolay Nikolayevich\n\nU.S.S.R.\n\n1957\n\nTodd (of Trumpington), Alexander Robertus Todd, Baron\n\nU.K.\n\nWhile at Manchester he began work on nucleosides, compounds that form the structural units of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). In 1949 he synthesized a related substance, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is vital to energy utilization in living organisms.\n\nHe synthesized two other important compounds, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) in 1949 and uridine triphosphate in 1954. In 1955 he elucidated the structure of vitamin B12.\n\n1958\n\nSanger, Frederick\n\nU.K.\n\nfor the determination of the structure of the insulin molecule\n\n1959\n\nHeyrovský, Jaroslav\n\nCzech.\n\nfor the discovery and development of polarography, an instrumental method of chemical analysis used for qualitative and quantitative determinations of reducible or oxidizable substances. Heyrovský's instrument measures the current that flows when a predetermined potential is applied to two electrodes immersed in the solution to be analyzed.\n\n1960\n\nLibby, Willard Frank\n\nU.S.\n\nIn 1946 he showed that tritium, the heaviest isotope of hydrogen, was produced by cosmic radiation. The following year he and his students developed the carbon-14 dating technique. This technique is used to date material derived from former living organisms as old as 50,000 years. It measures small amounts of radioactivity from the carbon-14 in organic or carbon-containing materials and is able to identify older objects as those having less radioactivity.\n\n1961\n\nCalvin, Melvin\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the study of chemical steps that take place during photosynthesis. Calvin began his work on photosynthesis in the mid-1940s. For his studies he developed a system of using the radioactive isotope carbon-14 as a tracer element in the green alga Chlorella. By arresting the plant's growth at various stages and measuring the tiny amounts of radioactive compounds present, Calvin was able to identify most of the reactions involved in the intermediate steps of photosynthesis.\n\nZiegler, Karl\n\nWest Germany\n\nZiegler's most important discovery was made in 1953. He and a student, E. Holzkamp, set out to repeat a preparation of higher aluminum alkyls by heating ethylene and aluminum triethyl; unexpectedly they obtained a complete conversion of the ethylene monomer (CH2 = CH2) to the dimer, 1-butene (CH3CH2CH = CH2). The explanation was found in the presence of a trace of colloidal nickel derived from the catalyst used previously in the autoclave for hydrogenation experiments. This led to the discovery that substances made by mixing organometallic compounds with compounds of certain heavy metals permitted the fast polymerization of ethylene at atmospheric pressure to a linear polymer of high molecular weight having valuable plastic properties (other processes used high pressure and produced a partly branched polymer). The catalyst derived from aluminum alkyl and titanium tetrachloride proved especially useful. It formed the basis of nearly all later developments in the production of long-chain polymers of hydrocarbons from such olefins as ethylene and butadiene; the resulting products came into widespread use as plastics, fibres, rubbers, and films.\n\n1964\n\nHodgkin, Dorothy Mary Crowfoot\n\nU.K.\n\nfor determining the structure of biochemical compounds (such as vitamin B12)essential in combating pernicious anemia. It would later take 10 years ( from 1961 to 1971) to synthesize this particular vitamin.\n\n1965\n\nWoodward, R.B.\n\nU.S.\n\nFor the synthesis of compounds such as including quinine (1944), cholesterol and cortisone (1951), and vitamin B12 (1971)\n\n1966\n\nMulliken, Robert Sanderson\n\nU.S.\n\nfor work concerning chemical bonds and the electronic structure of molecules. Mulliken began working on his theory of molecular structure in the 1920s. He theoretically systematized the electron states of molecules in terms of molecular orbitals. Departing from the idea that electron orbitals for atoms are static and that atoms combine like building blocks to form molecules, he proposed that, when molecules are formed, the atoms' original electron configurations are changed into an overall molecular configuration. Further extending his theory, he developed (1952) a quantum-mechanical theory of the behaviour of electron orbitals as different atoms merge to form molecules.\n\n1967\n\nEigen, Manfred\n\nWest Germany\n\nfor studies of extremely fast chemical reactions.\n\nEigen was able to study many extremely fast chemical reactions by a variety of methods that he introduced and which are called relaxation techniques. These involve the application of bursts of energy to a solution that briefly destroy its equilibrium before a new equilibrium is reached. Eigen studied what happened to the solution in the extremely brief interval between the two equilibria by means of absorption spectroscopy. Among specific topics thus investigated were the rate of hydrogen ion formation through dissociation in water, diffusion-controlled protolytic reactions, and the kinetics of keto-enol tautomerism.\n\nNorrish, Ronald George Wreyford\n\nU.K.\n\nNorrish and Porter, who worked together between 1949 and 1965, used the new technique of flash photolysis to study the intermediate stages involved in extremely rapid chemical reactions. In this technique, a gaseous system in a state of equilibrium is subjected to an ultrashort burst of light that causes photochemical reactions in the gas. A second burst of light is then used to detect and record the changes taking place in the gas before equilibrium is reestablished.\n\nPorter, Sir George\n\nU.K.\n\n1968\n\nOnsager, Lars\n\nU.S.\n\nHe applied the laws of thermodynamics to systems that are not in equilibrium--i.e., to systems in which differences in temperature, pressure, or other factors exist. Onsager also was able to formulate a general mathematical expression about the behaviour of nonreversible chemical processes that has been described as the \"fourth law of thermodynamics.\"\n\n1969\n\nBarton, Sir Derek H.R.\n\nU.K.\n\nfor research that helped establish conformational analysis (the study of the three-dimensional geometric structure of complex molecules) as an essential part of organic chemistry.\n\nHassel, Odd\n\nNorway\n\n1970\n\nLeloir, Luis Federico\n\nArgentina\n\nfor the discovery of sugar nucleotides and their role in the biosynthesis of carbohydrates\n\n1971\n\nHerzberg, Gerhard\n\nCanada\n\nresearch in the structure of molecules.\n\nHerzberg's spectroscopic studies not only provided experimental results of prime importance to physical chemistry and quantum mechanics but also helped stimulate a resurgence of investigations into the chemical reactions of gases. He devoted much of his research to diatomic molecules, in particular the most common ones--hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide. He discovered the spectra of certain free radicals that are intermediate stages in numerous chemical reactions, and he was the first to identify the spectra of certain radicals in interstellar gas. Herzberg also contributed much spectrographic information on the atmospheres of the outer planets and the stars.\n\n1972\n\nAnfinsen, Christian B.\n\nU.S.\n\nAnfinsen studied how the enzyme ribonuclease breaks down the ribonucleic acid (RNA) present in food. Anfinsen was able to ascertain how the ribonuclease molecule folds to form the characteristic three-dimensional structure that is compatible with its function.\n\nMoore, Stanford\n\nU.S.\n\nStein, William H.\n\nU.S.\n\nMoore and Stein pioneered new methods of chromatography for use in analyzing amino acids and small peptides obtained by the hydrolysis of proteins. In 1958 they helped develop the first automatic amino-acid analyzer, a machine that greatly facilitated the analysis of the amino acid sequences of proteins. In 1959 Moore and Stein used the new machine to make the first determination of the complete chemical structure of an enzyme, ribonuclease.\n\n1973\n\nFischer, Ernst Otto\n\nWest Germany\n\norganometallic chemistry\n\nFor his identification of a completely new way in which metals and organic substances can combine. After studying the synthetic substance ferrocene, he concluded that it consisted of two five-sided carbon rings with a single iron atom sandwiched between them.\n\nWilkinson, Sir Geoffrey\n\nU.K.\n\nWilkinson went on to synthesize a number of other \"sandwich\" compounds, or metallocenes, and his researches into this previously unknown type of chemical structure earned him the Nobel Prize.\n\n1974\n\nFlory, Paul J.\n\nU.S.\n\nfor studies of long-chain molecules involved in plastics. His research demonstrated the importance of understanding the sizes and shapes of these flexible molecules in establishing relationships between their chemical structures and their physical properties..\n\n1975\n\nCornforth, Sir John Warcup\n\nU.K.\n\nfor work in stereochemistry of enzyme-catalyzed reactions such as the one involved in the synthesis of cholestrol\n\nPrelog, Vladimir\n\nSwitzerland\n\nfor work in stereochemistry of of alkaloids, antibiotics, enzymes, and other natural compounds\n\n1976\n\nLipscomb, William Nunn, Jr.\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the structure of boranes.\n\nBy developing X-ray techniques that later proved useful in many chemical applications, Lipscomb and his associates were able to map the molecular structures of numerous boranes and their derivatives. Boranes are compounds of boron and hydrogen. The stability of boranes could not be explained by traditional concepts of electron bonding, in which each pair of atoms is linked by a pair of electrons, because boranes lacked sufficient electrons. Lipscomb showed how a pair of electrons could be shared by three atoms. His theory successfully served to describe boranes and many other analogous structures.\n\n1977\n\nPrigogine, Ilya\n\nBelgium\n\nfor widening the scope of thermodynamics.\n\nPrigogine's work dealt with the application of the second law of thermodynamics to complex systems, including living organisms. The second law states that physical systems tend to slide spontaneously and irreversibly toward a state of disorder (this process is known as entropy); it does not, however, explain how complex systems could have arisen spontaneously from less ordered states and have maintained themselves in defiance of the tendency toward entropy. Prigogine argued that as long as systems receive energy and matter from an external source, nonlinear systems (or dissipative structures, as he called them) can go through periods of instability and then self-organization, resulting in more complex systems whose characteristics cannot be predicted except as statistical probabilities. Prigogine's work was influential in a wide variety of fields, from physical chemistry to biology, and was fundamental to the new disciplines of chaos theory and complexity theory.\n\n1978\n\nMitchell, Peter Dennis\n\nU.K.\n\nfor the formulation of a theory of energy transfer processes in biological systems. Mitchell studied the mitochondrion, the organelle that produces energy for the cell. ATP is made within the mitochondrion by adding a phosphate group to ADP in a process known as oxidative phosphorylation. Mitchell was able to determine how the different enzymes involved in the conversion of ADP to ATP are distributed within the membranes that partition the interior of the mitochondrion. He showed how these enzymes' arrangement facilitates their use of hydrogen ions as an energy source in the conversion of ADP to ATP\n\n1979\n\nBrown, Herbert Charles\n\nU.S.\n\nintroduction of compounds of boron and phosphorus in the synthesis of organic substances\n\n.\n\nBrown's work with borohydrides led to the development of an important new class of inorganic reagents. His discovery of the organoboranes revealed an array of powerful and versatile reagents for organic synthesis. He was also known for studies of reactions involving so-called carbonium ions or carbo-cations.\n\nWittig, Georg\n\nWest Germany\n\nIn investigating reactions involving carbanions, negatively charged organic species, Wittig discovered a class of organic phosphorus compounds called ylides that mediate a particular type of reaction that became known as the Wittig reaction. This reaction proved of great value in the synthesis of complex organic compounds such as vitamins A and D2, prostaglandins, and steroids\n\n1980\n\nBerg, Paul\n\nU.S.\n\nfirst preparation of a recombinant DNA.\n\nIn the course of studying the actions of isolated genes, Berg evolved methods for splitting DNA molecules at selected sites and attaching segments of the molecule to the DNA of a virus or plasmid, which could then enter bacterial or animal cells. The foreign DNA was incorporated into the host and caused the synthesis of proteins that were not ordinarily found there. One of the earliest practical results of recombinant technology was the development of a strain of bacteria containing the gene for producing the mammalian hormone insulin.\n\nGilbert, Walter\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the development of chemical and biological analyses of DNA structure. In the 1970s Gilbert developed a widely used technique of using gel electrophoresis to read the nucleotide sequences of DNA segments. The same method was developed independently by Sanger\n\nSanger, Frederick\n\nU.K.\n\nBy 1977 he had elucidated the sequences of nucleotides in the DNA molecule of a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria). This phage, phi-X 174, was the first organism to have its entire nucleotide sequence determined. To achieve this feat, Sanger again developed new laboratory techniques, this time for splitting DNA into fragments whose base sequences can then be determined.\n\n1981\n\nFukui ,Kenichi\n\nJapan\n\nfor the orbital symmetry interpretation of chemical reactions. Hoffmann and Woodward discovered that many reactions involving the formation or breaking of rings of atoms take courses that depend on an identifiable symmetry in the mathematical descriptions of the molecular orbitals that undergo the most change. Their theory, expressed in a set of statements now called the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, accounts for the failure of certain cyclic compounds to form from apparently appropriate starting materials, though others are readily produced; it also clarifies the geometric arrangement of the atoms in the products formed when the rings in cyclic compounds are broken.\n\nHoffmann, Roald\n\nU.S.\n\n1982\n\nKlug, Aaron\n\nU.K.\n\nfor investigations of the three-dimensional structure of viruses and other particles that are combinations of nucleic acids and proteins, and for the development of crystallographic electron microscopy.\n\n1983\n\nTaube, Henry\n\nU.S.(Canadian born)\n\nfor his extensive research into the properties and reactions of dissolved inorganic substances, particularly oxidation-reduction processes involving the ions of metallic elements.\n\nThe oxidation or reduction of one metal ion by another involves their exchange of one or more electrons. Many such reactions occur rapidly in aqueous solution despite the fact that the stable shells of water molecules or other ligands should keep the two ions from getting close enough for electron exchange to occur directly. Taube showed that, in an intermediate stage of the reaction, a chemical bond must form between one of the ions and a ligand that is still bonded to the other. This ligand acts as a temporary bridge between the two ions, and its bond to the original ion can later break in such a way as to effect--indirectly--the electron transfer that completes the reaction. Taube's findings have been applied in selecting metallic compounds for use as catalysts, pigments, and superconductors and in understanding the function of metal ions as constituents of certain enzymes.(from Britannica biography)\n\n1984\n\nMerrifield, Bruce\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the development of a method of polypeptide synthesis\n\n1985\n\nHauptman, Herbert A.\n\nU.S.\n\nHauptman and Karle devised mathematical equations to extract phase information from the intensity of spots resulting from the diffraction of X rays deflected off crystals. Their equations made it possible to pinpoint the location of atoms within the crystal's molecules based upon an analysis of the intensity of the spots.\n\nKarle, Jerome\n\nU.S.\n\n1986\n\nHerschbach, Dudley R.\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the development of methods for analyzing basic chemical reactions\n\nLee, Yuan T.\n\nU.S.\n\nPolanyi, John C.\n\nCanada\n\n1987\n\nPedersen, Charles J.\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the discovery of crown ethers, organic molecules that can solvate metal ions, which normally do not dissolve in organic solvents.\n\nLehn, Jean-Marie\n\nFrance\n\nFormed cryptands from crown ethers by replacing Os with Ns\n\nCram, Donald J.\n\nU.S.\n\nFormed cryptates, which selectively recognized and bound specific guest molecules and ions.\n\n1988\n\nDeisenhofer, Johann\n\nWest Germany\n\nfor the discovery of structure of proteins needed in photosynthesis.\n\nMichel, Huber and Deisenhofer set out to study the structure of a protein complex found in certain photosynthetic bacteria. This protein, called a photosynthetic reaction centre, was known to play a crucial role in initiating a simple type of photosynthesis. Between 1982 and 1985, the three scientists used X-ray crystallography to determine the exact arrangement of the more than 10,000 atoms that make up the protein complex. Their research increased the general understanding of the mechanisms of photosynthesis and revealed similarities between the photosynthetic processes of plants and bacteria.\n\nHuber, Robert\n\nWest Germany\n\nMichel, Hartmut\n\nWest Germany\n\n1989\n\nAltman, Sidney\n\nU.S.\n\n(born in Canada)\n\nfor the discovery of certain basic properties of RNA.\n\nThe old belief was that enzymatic activity--the triggering and acceleration of vital chemical reactions within living cells--was the exclusive domain of protein molecules. Altman's and Cech's revolutionary discovery was that RNA, traditionally thought to be simply a passive carrier of genetic codes between different parts of the living cell, could also take on active enzymatic functions. This new knowledge opened up new fields of scientific research and biotechnology and caused scientists to rethink old theories of how cells function.\n\nCech, Thomas Robert\n\nU.S.\n\n1990\n\nCorey, Elias James\n\nU.S.\n\nfor the development of retrosynthetic analysis for synthesis of complex molecules. This technique involves breaking down an organic compound into several stages, ensuring that each step is reversible so that the route can eventually be traced backwards. With such an approach, Corey synthesied a wide variety of terpenes and ginkgolide B (used in treating asthma). Link to synthesis.\n\n1991\n\nErnst, Richard R.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nfor improvements in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\n\nIn 1966, working with an American colleague, Ernst discovered that the sensitivity of NMR techniques (hitherto limited to analysis of only a few nuclei) could be dramatically increased by replacing the slow, sweeping radio waves traditionally used in NMR spectroscopy with short, intense pulses. His discovery enabled analysis of a great many more types of nuclei and smaller amounts of materials.\n\n1992\n\nMarcus, Rudolph A.\n\nU.S.\n\n(born Mtl,Canada)\n\nfor an explanation of how electrons transfer between molecules. In a series of papers published between 1956 and 1965, he investigated the role of surrounding solvent molecules in determining the rate of redox reactions--oxidation and reduction reactions in which the reactants exchange electrons--in solution. Marcus determined that subtle changes occur in the molecular structure of the reactants and the solvent molecules around them; these changes influence the ability of electrons to move between the molecules. He further established that the relationship between the driving force of an electron-transfer reaction and the reaction's rate is described by a parabola. Thus, as more driving force is applied to a reaction, its rate at first increases but then begins to decrease. This insight aroused considerable skepticism until it was confirmed experimentally in the 1980s.\n\n1993\n\nMullis, Kary B.\n\nU.S.\n\ninventors of techniques for gene study and manipulation.\n\nMullis developed PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in 1983. Earlier methods for obtaining a specific sequence of DNA in quantities sufficient for study were difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. PCR uses four ingredients: the double-stranded DNA segment to be copied, called the template DNA; two oligonucleotide primers (short segments of single-stranded DNA, each of which is complementary to a short sequence on one of the strands of the template DNA); nucleotides, the chemical building blocks that make up DNA; and a polymerase enzyme that copies the template DNA by joining the free nucleotides in the correct order. These ingredients are heated, causing the template DNA to separate into two strands. The mixture is cooled, allowing the primers to attach themselves to the complementary sites on the template strands. The polymerase is then able to begin copying the template strands by adding nucleotides onto the end of the primers, producing two molecules of double-stranded DNA. Repeating this cycle increases the amount of DNA exponentially: some 30 cycles, each lasting only a few minutes, will produce more than a billion copies of the original DNA sequence. Before the advent of Smith's method, the technique biochemical researchers used to create genetic mutations was imprecise and the haphazard approach made it a difficult and time-consuming task. Smith remedied this situation by developing site-directed mutagenesis, a technique that can be used to modify nucleotide sequences at specific, desired locations within a gene. This had made it possible for researchers to determine the role each amino acid plays in protein structure and function. Aside from its value to basic research, site-directed mutagenesis has many applications in medicine, agriculture, and industry. For example, it can be used to produce a protein variant that is more stable, active, or useful than its natural counterpart.\n\nSmith, Michael\n\nCanada\n\n1994\n\nOlah, George A.\n\nU.S.\n\ndevelopment of techniques to study hydrocarbon molecules. Although theoretically recognized for several decades as a common intermediate in many organic reactions, carbocations were unobservable because they were a short-lived, unstable class of compound. Olah was able to successfully disassemble, examine, and then recombine carbocations through the use of superacids and ultracold solvents.\n\n1995\n\nCrutzen, Paul\n\nNetherlands\n\nexplanation of processes that deplete Earth's ozone layer. Rowland and Molina theorized that CFC gases combine with solar radiation and decompose in the stratosphere, releasing atoms of chlorine and chlorine monoxide that are individually able to destroy large numbers of ozone molecules. The chlorine atoms were persistent because they were recycled once an intermediate radical, ClO, reacted with atomic oxygen. Earlier, in 1970 Crutzen had discovered that nonreactive nitrous oxide (N2O), produced naturally by soil bacteria, rises into the stratosphere, where solar energy splits it into two reactive compounds, NO and NO2. These compounds, which remain active for some time, react catalytically with ozone (O3).\n\nMainly because of their influence, production of CFC's was eventually banned.\n\nMolina, Mario\n\nU.S.\n\nRowland, F.
