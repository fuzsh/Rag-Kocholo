Two volumes.\n\nStockholm: Norstedt, 1884.\n\n1st Edition. Soft cover. Near Fine. Item #003173\n\nOffprint: Bihang Till K. Svenska Vet.-Akad. Handlingar, Bd. VIII, 13. Stockholm: Norstedt, 1884. 8vo (215 x 140 mm). 53 [1], 89 [1] pp. Original wrappers with publisher's ink stamp at top margin of each volume (wrappers little browned, lower cover of first volume with minor edge chipping). Text generally clean and crisp, just a little browning of first and final page. A near fine set. ----\n\nDSB I, p.302; Poggendorff IV, 40. FIRST EDITION, very rare in the offprint wrappers intended for private discribution (not to compare with the regular journal issues which have printed wrappers with price stated). That the true offprints are frequently mixed up in literature and sales catalogues is owned to the fact that the regular issues of this supplement series to the 'Proceedings of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences' were distributed in single numbers with printed wrappers. None of the latter are offprints in the classical sense (i.e. copies given by the publisher to the author for distribution to colleagues and friends).\n\nA milestone work of physical chemistry in which Arrhenius first formulates his theory of electrolytical dissociation. His explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into charged particles, to which Michael Faraday had given the name 'ions' many years earlier. Faraday's belief had been that ions were produced in the process of electrolysis. Arrhenius proposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, solutions of salts contained ions. He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1903 was awarded to him in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered to the advancement of chemistry by his electrolytic theory of dissociation. - Visit our website for additional images and information."
