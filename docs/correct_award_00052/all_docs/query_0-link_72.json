        "text": "Nobel Laureates Paul Crutzen, George de Hevesy, Hans von Euler-Chelpin and Svante Arrhenius have all worked at Stockholm University. In addition, Gunnar Myrdal, who was researcher at Stockholm University, has received the Swedish Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Bert Bolin, Professor of Meteorology, was one of the founders of the UN Climate Panel that was awarded the Peace Prize. The poet and literature prize winner Tomas Tranströmer was one of the university's former students.\n\nPaul Crutzen, Chemistry, 1995\n\nPaul Crutzen (1933–2021) received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on the ozone layer of the earth’s atmosphere. Paul Crutzen has made fundamental contributions to our understanding of the formation and destruction of ozone – processes that are also affected by the emission of gases caused by human activity. In particular, he has shown the importance of nitrogen oxides for the ozone balance.\n\nChemical mechanisms in the ozone layer\n\nCrutzen has also made a significant contribution to our knowledge of how the reactions which destroy ozone are reinforced by cloud particles in the stratosphere. That the dilution of the ozone layer is strongest just above the poles of the earth – in particular over Antarctica – is due to this effect. The extremely low temperatures lead to the creation of a very large quantity of cloud particles. Research on the chemical mechanisms in the ozone layer has shown signs of the negative impact of humans. There are now far-reaching international agreements on the prohibition of emission of freons and other gases that destroy ozone in the so-called Montreal Protocol.\n\nOzone in the lower stratum of the atmosphere\n\nPaul Crutzen has also studied how ozone is created in the lower stratum of the atmosphere, the troposphere, where the amount of ozone has increased in the last century, due to car exhaust fumes and other emissions. Besides contributing to the greenhouse effect, ozone close to the ground also causes damage to crops and human health.\n\nPaul Crutzen was Dutch and came to the Department of Meteorology at Stockholm University in 1959. He defended his doctoral thesis at the University in 1973 and has periodically continued his activities here, alongside his work at several large research institutions around the world.\n\nPaul Crutzen shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland.\n\nGeorge de Hevesy, Chemistry, 1943\n\nGeorge de Hevesy (1885–1966) received the 1943 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the method of using isotopes to trace chemical reactions and processes in the body.\n\nChemical elements can exist as different isotopes – with a smaller or larger number of neutrons in the atomic nucleus and accordingly, different mass numbers. An example is carbon-14 with eight neutrons instead of the six that exist in “normal” carbon, carbon-12. Certain isotopes are unstable and fall apart. George de Hevesy showed that these radioactive isotopes can be used to follow the reactions of chemical substances.\n\nTracing reaction pathways using isotopes\n\nGeorge de Hevesy was a pioneer in using isotopes to trace reaction pathways both in organic and inorganic chemistry and medicine. The ability to follow chemical reactions in cells meant that the dynamic exchange processes of biological systems could be observed for the first time. Various methods based on isotopes are now among the routine tools in research.\n\nDiscovered the element hafnium\n\nGeorge de Hevesy, born in Budapest in Austria-Hungary, was a physicist and chemist and spent a great deal of his time at different European universities. Besides his discoveries on isotopes, he discovered the element hafnium in 1923, named after Hafnia, which is the Latin name for Copenhagen. George de Hevesy settled in Stockholm in 1943 and was then active as a researcher at Stockholm University College, which later became Stockholm University.\n\nGeorge de Hevesy was the sole recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1943.\n\nGunnar Myrdal, The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, 1974\n\nGunnar Myrdal (1898–1987) received the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 1974 for his work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and for the analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena.\n\nImpact on both research and social issues\n\nIn the 1930s, Gunnar Myrdal made several important contributions to the so-called Stockholm School, for example by emphasizing how expectations affect economic fluctuations. His later works also included social and political aspects of society, in particular “An American Dilemma” from 1944 on racial problems in the US. The book played an important role in the debate and the decisions on civil rights in the following decades. The book “Asian Drama” from 1968 on the sources of overpopulation and poverty in South Asia had a great impact and affected research and the debate on the problems facing developing countries.\n\nNational and international political appointments\n\nGunnar Myrdal devoted his time between academic work and politics. He was very influential in Sweden’s Social Democratic Party and became one of the most important architects of the emergency politics in the 1930’s which saw increased public ventures to counteract the depression. Moreover, he had a great influence on Swedish welfare policy together with his wife Alva, also an active politician. Gunnar Myrdal had several national and international appointments, for example, such as Swedish Minister of Commerce and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 1947–1957.\n\nGunnar Myrdal was Professor of Economics at Stockholm University College during the years 1933–1950. In 1962, he founded the Institute for International Economics Studies at Stockholm University where he was director until 1967.\n\nGunnar Myrdal shared the prize in Economic Sciences with Friedrich von Hayek in 1974.\n\nHans von Euler-Chelpin, Chemistry, 1929\n\nHans von Euler-Chelpin (1873–1964) received the 1929 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on the fermentation of sugar and the enzymes involved in the complex reactions making it possible to make bread, beer and wine.\n\nGlycolysis important for the understanding of life\n\nThe breakdown of sugar in the so-called glycolysis is largely controlled by enzymes, large proteins that keep the chemical reactions going. In his research on yeast cells, Hans von Euler-Chelpin showed that also a coenzyme, NAD, is necessary for enzymes to be able to do their work. NAD is present in all organisms, where it plays a fundamental role in its capacity to transport electrons to different parts of the cell.\n\nResearch on glycolysis plays an important part in the understanding of life. The ten stages of reaction that break down sugar constitute the basis of a long chain of reactions in different organisms. Besides being transformed into ethanol in yeast cells, glycolysis provides energy that keeps our cells going and provides building blocks for proteins. Hans von Euler-Chelpin’s work provided a basis for that knowledge. He also studied vitamins and showed, for example, that colouring agents such as beta carotene in vegetables are transformed into vitamin A in the body.\n\nFrom studies in art to chemistry and physics\n\nGerman-born Hans von Euler-Chelpin became a scientist during his time as a young art student. An interest in the optical characteristics of colours led to studies in chemistry and physics. He came to Stockholm University College in 1897 and became a professor here in 1906.\n\nHans von Euler-Chelpin shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1929 with Arthur Harden.\n\nSvante Arrhenius, Chemistry, 1903\n\nSvante Arrhenius (1859–1927) received the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery on how chemical compounds in solution can conduct electric current.\n\nSvante Arrhenius was one of the most important scientists of his time. His electrolytic theory of dissociation completely changed chemists’ conception of acids, bases and salts. Electrolytical dissociation means that compounds fall apart into electrically charged ions, as for example, when ordinary table salt dissolves into natrium and chloride ions. Thus, solutions can work as electrolytes and be carriers of electric current.\n\nThanks to Svante Arrhenius’ theory, a number of mysterious chemical and physical phenomena could be explained and described in a simpler and more homogeneous way than previously. Even though his theory has been modified in the twentieth century, it still remains a major discovery within chemistry.\n\nThe Arrhenius equation\n\nSvante Arrhenius’ most important contribution might be the so-called Arrhenius equation, which formulates the relationship between how quickly a reaction occurs and the energy that must be supplied for it to occur. This connection is of fundamental importance for the understanding of how chemical reactions really occur. Svante Arrhenius was also one of the very first to make the connection between the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the global temperature – what we today call the greenhouse effect.\n\nProfessor of physics and Vice-Chancellor of Stockholm University College\n\nSvante Arrhenius began his studies in Uppsala. The theories he developed in his doctoral dissertation were first treated with such scepticism that he passed with the lowest possible grade. After some time, his theories were revaluated, however, and he was employed as a lecturer at Stockholm University College in 1891. He became professor of physics here in 1895 and was also Vice-Chancellor of Stockholm University College for seven years. Today, his name lives on in the Arrhenius laboratory, which houses many of the scientific departments at Stockholm University.\n\nSvante Arrhenius was the sole recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903 and Sweden’s first Nobel Prize Laureate.\n\nBert Bolin, Peace Prize 2007\n\nBert Bolin (1925–2007) was professor of meteorology at Stockholm University and a driving force behind the creation of the UN climate panel IPCC and its first chairman in the years 1988–1997. In 2007, the organization was awarded, together with former US Vice President Al Gore, the Nobel Peace Prize for its work. Bert Bolin was invited to Oslo to receive the Peace Prize for IPCC but was unable to attend due to illness. Shortly afterwards he passed away.\n\nTomas Tranströmer, Literature, 2011\n\nThe poet Tomas Tranströmer (1931–2015) was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Literature “because, through his condensed, translucent images, he gives us fresh access to reality”, according to the prize motivation.\n\nTomas Tranströmer was not only one of the century’s great Swedish poets. His work has also been translated into more than thirty languages.\n\nTomas Tranströmer studied the history of literature, psychology, and other subjects at Stockholm University College. During the late 50s he worked at the Institute for Psychometrics at Stockholm University College. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Stockholm University in 1990."
