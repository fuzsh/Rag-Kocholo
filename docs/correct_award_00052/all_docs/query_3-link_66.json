        "text": "The Nobel Prize is one of the most prestigious and coveted awards in the world, recognizing the outstanding achievements and contributions of individuals and organizations in various fields of science, literature, and peace. However, not every deserving scientist has received this honor, either due to oversight, bias, politics, or death. In this story, I want to briefly explore the lives and works of a few visionary scientists who deserved a Nobel prize but didn’t win, and the reasons why they were snubbed.\n\nLise Meitner, the co-discoverer of nuclear fission"
