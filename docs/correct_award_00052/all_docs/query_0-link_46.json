        "text": "[person]\n\nSwedish physical chemist born in Vik (1859-1927). Arrhenius is most famous for what is now known as the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate of chemical reactions to temperature and activation energy. Arrhenius was awarded the Royal Society's Davy medal and the Faraday medal of the Chemical Society in 1914, and the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903 based on his early work on the conductivity of electrolytes in solution."
