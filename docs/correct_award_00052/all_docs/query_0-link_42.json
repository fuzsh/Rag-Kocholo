        "text": "At the beginning of the 20th century, Svante Arrhenius was the most famous scientist in Sweden. Besides his scientific research, he wrote and held popular scientific lectures on topics such as cosmology and chemistry’s influence on modern society. The research presented in his 1884 doctoral thesis (published on this day, 26 May) was the main basis for awarding him the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry – however his thesis was almost not approved. His research on how molecules can be split into electrically charged ‘ions’ (a new chemical term during this time period) was very closely related both to chemistry and physics. The physicists at the university thought that his thesis was about chemistry and the chemists thought it was about physics. But Arrhenius refused to be put off and continued his interdisciplinary research. During the 1890s he became interested in meteorology and geology, and was the first person to calculate how much the average temperature would rise if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased. His doctoral thesis is part of the Nobel Prize Museum’s collection of artefacts from Nobel Prize laureates."
