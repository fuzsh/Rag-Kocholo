        "text": "\"Is the mean temperature of the ground in any way influenced by the presence of the heat-absorbing gases in the atmosphere?\"\n\nWith this single question, Arrhenius became the father of climate change. Arrhenius believed that what we humans were doing – burning fossil fuel on a large scale – would make countries warmer. He was the first person to investigate the effect CO2 would have on the global climate. But, alas, a century later, with all the information and knowledge we have, we are still using fossil fuel as one of our main sources of energy.\n\nSvante Arrhenius did not get a Peace Prize and his work on climate and carbon emissions was pretty much forgotten for more than half a century, largely because most people did not believe that human activity could have an impact on the earth’s climate. But in the 21st century, the Norwegian Nobel Committee embraced the efforts made to limit the harm done by man-made climate change and threats to the environment.\n\nIn 2007, the Norwegian Nobel Committee stayed true to Alfred Nobel´s grand vision of creating a better world by awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former US Vice President Al Gore Jr. They were awarded the Prize for their efforts to obtain and disseminate greater knowledge concerning man-made climate changes and the steps that need to be taken to counteract those changes.\n\nThe IPCC was established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1988, and its purpose was to collect research and report on the state of the climate. Between 1990 and 2007, four reports were submitted by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, pushing climate change into the spotlight and onto the front page. The reports stated, as Arrhenius had predicted, that climate change was to a significant extent man-made, but also that it was accelerating. The reports also stated that there was an urgent need to adopt counter-measures in order to prevent a global climate crisis from arising in the near future. Not only will it become a global climate crisis, but according to the IPCC, there is a real danger that the changes will increase the number of conflicts and wars, due to already scarce and unequal distribution of natural resources.\n\nConflicts and insecurity, triggered by hunger and climate disasters, are driving people into displacement. The global society should be helping to improve society through knowledge, science and humanism, in the spirit of Alfred Nobel. When we invest in the fight against climate change, we invest in sustainable peace and in the end our own security.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is rewarded engaged planetary citizens, who dare to come up with radical ideas that confer the greatest benefit to humankind. Such as ideas to reduce climate change, because sustainable peace requires and needs immediate climate action. But the planet needs more than empty talk. And it needs more than a Prize. Alfred Nobel once said that good wishes alone will not ensure peace. And he was right."
