In 1884 he submitted a 150 page dissertation on electrolytic conductivity to Uppsala for the doctorate. It did not impress the professors. Later, extensions of this very work would earn him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The most important idea in the dissertation was his explanation of the fact that neither pure salts nor pure water is a conductor, but solutions of salts in water are. In 1900, he became involved in setting up the Nobel Institutes and the Nobel Prizes. In 1902 he began to investigate physiological problems in terms of chemical theory. He determined that reactions in living organisms and in the test tube followed the same laws. I(...)",
