        "text": "Electric Arcs\n\nIn 1884 Ayrton began attending evening classes at Finsbury Technical College in London, where she was just one of three women alongside 118 men studying electricity and physics. These two fields of study would define the rest of her career and research.\n\nAyrton’s lecturers included physics expert and renowned electrical engineer Professor William Edward Ayrton, who she married in 1885. In the early 1890s, Ayrton began assisting her husband with his research on the properties of electric arcs, an early and powerful form of electric lighting. She soon she took over the research herself and established two key points in the working of electric arcs.\n\nFirst, she discovered that the problems with electric arc lighting such as hissing, flickering and instability were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. Secondly, she found that when oxygen was excluded, a steady arc was obtained.\n\nHence she was able to establish the 'Ayrton equation'—a linear relationship between arc length, pressure and potential difference.\n\nBetween 1895 and 1896, Ayrton published a series of 12 journal articles on electric arc lighting research and analysis in The Electrician, the premier electrical engineering periodical of the age. With these articles, she overtook her husband’s earlier work in this field and established her own credentials as an expert on electric arcs and in the field of electrical engineering more generally.\n\nThis recognition led to increased opportunities, including the invitation to deliver her own paper on electric arcs to the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE, now IET), the first woman to do so. In 1899, Ayrton was elected a member of the institution (MIEE), a prestigious and widely recognised professional qualification. Thus Ayrton became the first female member of the IEE and the first professionally recognised female electrical engineer.\n\nWhen testing samples of pitchblende, a uranium ore, Curie found them to be several times more radioactive than expected. This suggested to her that they contained another unknown and highly radioactive element.\n\nHer husband joined her in her efforts to isolate this new element, and later that year they successfully extracted a sample. Curie named this new element polonium, after her native Poland.\n\nWhile extracting polonium from pitchblende, the Curies noticed that another extremely radioactive element must be present. This led to the discovery of radium, which the pair announced in December 1898.\n\nIn 1903, Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel were nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on radioactivity.\n\nSwedish mathematician Gosta Mittag-Leffler, an ardent advocate of women in science, argued that Marie should be considered alongside her husband for her work on radioactivity. Eventually the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded jointly to Marie and Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel.\n\nA scandal and a second Nobel Prize\n\nIn 1911, reports emerged of a romantic affair between Marie Curie and Paul Langevin, a colleague at the Sorbonne and former student of her husband’s. A scandal was whipped up in Paris’ right-wing newspapers, and rumours began to spread that it had been Pierre, and not Marie, behind the Curies’ great work. The public dissection of her private life almost ruined her reputation.\n\nCurie’s public image was saved in the midst of this scandal when she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of radium and polonium. She had received only two nominations, but one of these was from Svante Arrhenius, an influential member of the committee and supporter of women in science.\n\nArrhenius may have used his influence to sway the committee in favour of Curie. Not only was the discovery of two new elements clearly worthy of Nobel recognition, but Arrhenius may have seen that allowing the work of a woman scientist to be unfairly discredited would undermine the status of all female scientists.\n\nCurie won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of radium in 1911. It was awarded to her and her alone, reasserting her position as an accomplished scientist in her own right.\n\nMeitner, with the help of her nephew Otto Frisch, sought to explain this process using theory. They noted that the mass of the uranium was significantly greater than the combined mass of the fission products. Following the immutable laws of conservation, this difference in mass must be accounted for somewhere.\n\nUsing Einstein’s famous equation 'E=mc²', which states that mass and energy are interchangeable, Meitner and Frisch suggested that the missing mass was being released as energy. Frisch returned to his lab in Copenhagen to perform the confirmatory experiments, and then he and Meitner rushed to share their results with Hahn.\n\nHahn’s research team identified the fission products as barium, and thus the process of fission was discovered: a heavy uranium nucleus is bombarded with neutrons, which causes the nucleus to split into lighter nuclei and simultaneously releases a huge amount of energy. This ground-breaking discovery revolutionised nuclear physics."
