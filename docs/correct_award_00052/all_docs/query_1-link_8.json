        "text": "* 19. February 1859 in Vik near Uppsala † 2. October 1927 in Stockholm\n\n1876 Study of Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics at the Universities of Uppsala and Stockholm\n\n1884 Promotion\n\n1885 Travelling fellowship of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\n\n1891 Lectureship at the University of Stockholm\n\n1895 Professorship at the University of Stockholm\n\n1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\n1905 Chief of the Nobel Institute for Physical Chemistry\n\nAlso in the new year the Archives of the University of Würzburg continue their “Scholar of the Month”-Series. This time we would like to present the Swedish Physician and Chemist Svante Arrhenius, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903.\n\nAcademic Career\n\nAlready when he was young, Svante Arrhenius showed great interests for Mathematics and Physics. From the age of eight, he attended the cathedral school of Uppsala and finished it with attaining his A-levels. Afterwards he started his study of Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics at the University of Uppsala, but transferred to the University of Stockholm in 1881, because of conflicts of opinion with his Professor, the physician Tobias Robert Thalén. There he was significantly supported by the Swedish physician Erik Edlund. In 1884 his dissertation with the title Recherches sur la conductibilité galvanique des électrolytes (Investigations on the galvanic conductivity of electrolytes) followed, however was not met with approval by his colleagues.\n\nArrhenius’ way to Würzburg\n\nArrhenius’ claim, that common salt solutions contain sodium and chlorine ions was unthinkable for most natural scientists at that time. Nevertheless, his theory also found prominent encouragement, like for example of the Chemist and Physicist Wilhelm Ostwald who showed great interest on Arrhenius thoughts. Therefor Ostwald visited the young Swedish chemist himself and was able to experimentally confirm his thesis. After refusing an offer of a professorship out of family reasons, he soon started an extended travelling fellowship made possible by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. His travels also brought Arrhenius to Würzburg, where he worked together with the Physician Friedrich Kohlrausch and the later Nobel laureate Walther Nernst. Kohlrausch introduced him to his techniques of measuring the conductivity of diluted solutions. Further stations of Arrhenius travels were Riga, Amsterdam and Graz. Afterwards he received an offer for a professorship in Giessen, which he declined in order to accept a lectureship in Stockholm, which was later converted to a professorship.\n\nThe first Swedish Nobel Laureate in Chemistry"
