        "text": "Irish indie-rock band Fake Friends return with their second single, “Girlfriend,” to be released on July 5th. The infectiously catchy, upbeat track explores a breakup from the girl’s perspective, touching on love, loss in a dwindling relationship.\n\n“The chorus came to me quickly, but I struggled with the verses,” Cathal Flaherty explains. “I finally finished it during a rough patch in my relationship, which inspired the song.”\n\nRecording “Girlfriend” took longer than expected, with three separate versions before the band settled on the final mix. The song features Benjamin Loose (Republic of Loose) on Bass and Luke Tai on Drums as well as additional guitars and backing vocals from Larry Hogan. Girlfriend comes off the back of the band’s debut single ‘Maybe’ which has been playlisted across stations all over Ireland and the UK.\n\nFake Friends recently signed a three-year deal with Song City Records and are working on more music with producer Larry Hogan at Dublin Studio Hub, set for release later this year.\n\nAbout Fake Friends\n\nFake Friends is a project between actual friends Cathal Flaherty and Patrick Kelly, born out of lock down in 2020. Both musicians have been writing together since and along with some other friends have been recording in Dublin Studio Hub since 2023. The duo along with their full band headlined a sold-out Whelan’s in Dublin in July 2023 and have since then signed a massive €300,000 deal to AMA Music Agency and Song City Records. 2024 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the duo from Kerry and Carlow with more singles on the way and more gigs to be announced.\n\nFake Friends are available for interviews and in studio sessions."
