        "text": "ADDING BALANCE TO YOUR LIFE\n\nJhené Aiko Efuru Chilombo (born March 16, 1988) is an American singer and songwriter, who embarked on her music career contributing vocals and appearing in several music videos for R&B group B2K. At the time, she was known as B2K member Lil’ Fizz’s “cousin”, though she is not actually related to him. It was used as a marketing tool, suggested by Sony and Epic Records, to promote Aiko through B2K and attract an audience. In 2003, Aiko was set to release her debut album, My Name Is Jhené, through her labels Sony, The Ultimate Group and Epic, however the album was never released, with Aiko eventually asking to be released from the label in order to continue her education.\n\nIn March 2011, Aiko made her return to music with the release of her first full-length project, a mixtape titled Sailing Soul(s). On December 16, 2011, Aiko signed a recording contract with American record producer No I.D.’s record label ARTium, distributed through Def Jam Recordings. In 2013, Aiko appeared on Big Sean’s single “Beware”, also featuring Lil Wayne, which became her first top 40 single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In November 2013, she released her first project for Artium and Def Jam, an extended play, titled Sail Out. The EP was supported by the singles “3:16AM”, “Bed Peace” and “The Worst”, the latter of which went on to become certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Aiko released her major-label debut album, Souled Out, on September 9, 2014. On September 22, 2017, she released her second studio album Trip. My favorite song of her’s, “New Balance”, came out in October of 2017 and was featured on this album.\n\nOn March 6, 2020, she released her third studio album entitled by her surname, Chilombo. This album contains twenty songs and a number of collaborations including John Legend, Future, and Dr, Chill. It is also very much inspired by her break up with performer Big Sean who she used to duo with him as Twenty88. Aiko wanted this album to have a more tranquill feel and took inspiration from Hawai’i, where she recorded the album. Along with artist H.E.R, who has been talked about before on this blog, Aiko collaborated on the song “B.S” in early March. On April 23, H.E.R. and Aiko live streamed themselves singing their song together in their respective houses for charity due to the COVOID-19 pandemic.\n\nA TIME FOR CHANGE\n\nAlt-J (written as alt-J) is an English indie rock band formed in 2007 in Leeds. The band’s symbol is the Greek letter delta, Δ, which can symbolize change or difference in math and science. Alt-J was formed when Gwil Sainsbury (guitar/bass), Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals) and Thom Sonny Green (drums) met at Leeds University in 2007.\n\nAfter graduating, the band moved to Cambridge where they spent several months working on their music before signing a deal with Infectious Music in December 2011. Their self-titled 4-track demo EP, was recorded with producer in London and featured the tracks “Breezeblocks”, “Hand-Made”, “Matilda”, and “Tessellate”. It’s fair to say you have heard the song “Breezeblocks” as it had a really long air time on the radio and has been used in quite a few tv shows and movies like the Netflix original Daybreak. An Awesome Wave, their first full album was compiled of the EP songs plus 10 more. Their debut album was released on 28 May 2012 in the UK, Europe, and Australia, and on 18 September 2012 in North America via and received largely favourable reviews and was described as a “captivating blend of insatiable grooves and profound poignancy”.\n\nIn April 2012, alt-J and played a minor headlining tour around the United Kingdom and Ireland in October of that year and were featured regularly on summer festivals. They also did concert tour in the United States in December 2012 and performed at the Laneway Festival tour in Australia. In November 2012 the band were announced as the winners of the Mercury Prize for their album. Besides the prize-money, the band saw an increase in their profile resulting in An Awesome Wave reaching 13 in the UK album chart.\n\nIn early June 2014, alt-J announced a 2014 tour to take place in North America over October and November. The 23-day tour started in Vancouver, B.C. on 14 October and ended in Washington, D.C. on 19 November. On 9 June 2014, they announced their second album This Is All Yours, that was released on 22 September 2014. This Is All Yours went straight to Number 1 on the UK’s Official Albums Chart, this album also contains one of my favorite songs by them, “Left Hand Free”. alt-J headlined the September 2015 edition of Boston Calling Music Festival.\n\nOn 3 March 2017 alt-J began teasing their third studio album on their social media accounts with an audio clip captioned “00110011 01110111 01110111” (the ASCII code for “3ww”). The band reported later that day that their third album would be titled Relaxer and was scheduled for release on 2 June 2017. On 6 March 2017 alt-J released “3WW,” which features lead singer Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice, as a digital single and announced dates for the Relaxer Tour in support of the album. In anticipation of their third album, the band released an online video game, soundtracked by their single “3WW,” as well as announcing in May 2017 that they would be playing a five-date UK tour at seaside venues, starting on 4 September 2017. The album was released shortly afterwards, on 2 June 2017, to generally favorable reviews. “Deadcrush,” the fourth single from the album, was featured as a soundtrack in the popular FIFA 18 game. Relaxer was nominated for the 2017 Mercury Prize.\n\nOn 28 September 2018 an alternative version of Relaxer was released. The album, titled REDUXER, is a “rap heavy do-over” of the previous year’s record.\n\nFROM THE GARDEN\n\nJonathon Ng, born the 23rd of December 1995, began independently releasing tracks as The Eden Project in 2013. In 2014, he released the album Kairos, in which he experimented with a more subdued alternative style of music. In October 2014, he released the Entrance EP, proving his most popular tracks were deviations from his usual sound. At the start of 2015, Ng further embraced his indie style with the Bipolar Paradise EP, whose track “Fumes” has amassed over 15 million views on YouTube as of January 2019. He later announced that he was discontinuing The Eden Project, and released Final Call, his last EP under the alias. It contained two covers, one being “Crazy In Love” by Beyoncé, which is the best cover of this song I have ever heard. “Times Like These” is officially the last song released under his former alias.\n\nNg changed his alias to EDEN following the release of Final Call, and began recording new work in spring 2015. The End Credits EP was released for free download worldwide on 8 August. The EP consists of indie pop and alternative electronica tracks with a strong emphasis on vocals. Two singles, “Nocturne” and “Gravity”, were released in June and July, respectively. As a whole, the EP has amassed over 14 million plays on the streaming platform SoundCloud.\n\nShortly after his End Credits tour, Ng announced that his new EP, I Think You Think Too Much of Me, which includes my favorites of his work, would be released on 19 August 2016. On 10 June 2016, the first single, “sex”, was released, featuring a greater focus on vocals and instrumentation. This song has to be one of my favorites. The title implies a very different vibe than what is actually given; the song is incredibly heartbreaking while also being fun to sing at the top of your lungs. A month later, Billboard premiered the next single, “drugs”, a day before its official release on 15 July 2016. After release, the EP charted on the Irish Albums Chart, becoming Ng’s first charting music. The music video for “drugs” is really cool since it’s a 360 degree video experience in virtual reality. The video amassed 1.5 million Facebook views in one week.\n\nOn 8 November 2017, Eden hinted toward the release of a new single on social media. On 8 and 9 November, Eden’s website displayed coordinates where people scavenged to find posters hidden in various locations across the world. “Gold” was officially released 10 November 2017 alongside the announcement of the Vertigo World Tour, which will span from March to May 2018. Eden’s third single for the album, “Crash”, was released on 8 December 2017 on Spotify and iTunes.\n\nVertigo was released on 19 January 2018. Eden began the Vertigo World Tour in promotion of the album in March 2018. The tour ran for eight months, concluding on 27 November. On 29 June 2018, Eden released an EP called About Time from the collection of songs which were played during the Vertigo World Tour during the break between parts 2 and 3 of the tour. Eden released a single, “909”, on 24 April 2019. Two singles, “Untitled” and “Projector” were released during October 2019. In December 2019, “Love, Death, Distraction” and later in January 2020 “Isohel” was released as part of Eden’s album No Future, which was released on 14 February 2020.\n\nRock Throughout This Land\n\nI feel like I have been repeating myself too much throughout these posts about music, so here is one a bit different than the previous. Gary Lee Clark Jr. was born February 15, 1984 and is an American musician from Austin, Texas. He is best known for his fusion of blues, rock and soul music with elements of hip hop. In 2011 Clark signed with Warner Bros Records and released The Bright Lights EP. It was followed by the albums Blak and Blu (2012) and The Story of Sonny Boy Slim (2015). Throughout his career Clark has been a prolific live performer, which has been documented in two releases; Gary Clark Jr. Live (2014) and Gary Clark Jr Live/North America (2017). He has shared the stage with Eric Clapton, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, B.B. King and the Rolling Stones.\n\nIn November of 2017, the DC Comics’ cinematic extended universe, DCEU, released its first team superhero movie entitled Justice League. Though the movie has mixed reviews, something that can’t be denied is its great soundtrack. The song used throughout multiple trailers, and the movie itself, was Gary Lee Clark Jr’s version of the hit song “Come Together”, which was originally, and famously, created in 1969 and recorded by The Beatles.\n\nHis latest album, This Land, was released on February 22, 2019. In 2020, he won the Grammy Award for “Best Rock Song” and “Best Rock Performance” for the song “This Land” from his album of the same name. “This Land” is a song about the persecutions of black people in America, and how they still are not treated or believed to be true Americans, something very close to Clark’s heart as he is African American himself. As of right now Clark is the proud owner of four of his six nominations for a Grammy award.\n\nPOEM OF THE WEEK\n\nMixing it up with some rhyme schemes and varying themes\n\nThe Oppressionists\n\nBy Jayne Cortez\n\nArt\n\nwhat do the art\n\nsuppressors\n\ncare about art\n\nthey jump on bandwagons\n\nwallow in press clips\n\n& stink up the planet\n\nwith their\n\npornographic oppression\n\nArt\n\nwhat do they care about art\n\nthey go from being\n\ncontemporary baby kissers to\n\nold time corrupt politicians\n\nto self-appointed censorship clerks\n\nwho won’t support art\n\nbut will support war\n\npoverty\n\nlung cancer\n\nracism\n\ncolonialism\n\nand toxic sludge\n\nthat’s their morality\n\nthat’s their religious conviction\n\nthat’s their protection of the public\n\n& contribution to family entertainment\n\nwhat do they care about art\n\nNo, Not The Guy Who Ran For President; This Is Much Better\n\nRitt Momney is the musical project that turned from band to solo act back to band. Originally created my Salt Lake City native, Jack Rutter, the band started when he was a high school student in 2017. Beginning as an indie rock band comprised of high school friends, the project became a personal outlet for Rutter after his bandmates left on Mormon missions and his girlfriend left for college. In his bedroom, he began writing, recording, and producing his upcoming debut LP, entitled “Her and All of My Friends,” in which Rutter grapples with loss, loneliness, and a drift away from Mormon culture. Currently, a live Ritt show features Rutter on vocals/guitar/keys, Jonas Torgersen on guitar, Noah Hamula on bass, Auden Winchester on keys, and (temp) Sam Olson on drums. Aged 17-19, the band keeps busy playing local and regional shows, and working on their new album.\n\nRitt Momney’s most recent, album released in July of 2019, entitled, Her and All My Friends . There are 13 tracks in total on the album; however there is a released EP that includes three songs released in the summer of 2017. The EP, Theater Kid/ Probably, includes -you guessed it-, “Theater Kid”, “Probably”, and a bonus track “Golden Slumbers”. While the band’s usual sound is more on the indie side, there are few songs, one inparticular, that may surprise you. The song that I am, and the people picking music for the HBO series “Ballers”, most interested in is “(If) the Book Doesn’t Sell”. This is by far my most favorite song on the album, but it did not start out this way. Unlike most of their songs, “(if) the Book Doesn’t Sell” is sung with voice modification, which makes it sound like bad autotuned and almost unpleasant to the ear at first. I almost skipped the song entirely until I got to the second verse. The fourteen-year old Jack Rutter explains, from his point of view, an extensive conversation he has with God and the Devil in his kitchen one night. Though the song takes place from his point of view, there is still a lot of description of how both the Devil and, especially, God are feeling. The fictional Rutter gets into a screaming match with God, and is left with the horrible knowledge that there is no longer a heaven or hell, that there will be nothing after death. He must then, at age fourteen, decide how he will live his life; with hopefulness or with the truth.\n\n“(If) the Book Doesn’t Sell” is definitely the best song on the album; however I’ll include a few more that I like for good measure: “Something, in General” and “Young Adult”.\n\nYOU KNOW THEY’RE SONGS, BUT DO YOU KNOW THEIR NAME?\n\nDaughter are an indie folk band from England. Fronted by North London native Elena Tonra (born 15 January 1990), they were formed in 2010 after the addition of Swiss-born guitarist Igor Haefeli and drummer Remi Aguilella from France. They have released four EPs and three albums, and are currently signed to two record labels, one for their North America endeavors, and the other based in Europe. After playing the local London circuit, they toured supporting Ben Howard around Europe and have since played headlining tours around North America, Europe and Australia.\n\nElena Tonra was raised in Northwood, London and, through her Dublin-born grandfather, experienced traditional Irish music from an early age. After being bullied at school she used writing to “deal emotionally with life”. Changing schools at the age of 12 had a great impact and since then Tonra writes “about things I feel difficult talking about in adulthood”. Tonra began her career in music by performing acoustic shows under her own name around London. She found that this “didn’t suit me at all. As a musician, I’m self-taught and felt I was restricted by my abilities”.\n\nHaefeli attended one of the acoustic shows that Tonra was performing and found that “she had this power which drew everyone in”. Originally from Neuchatel, Haefeli also attended London’s Institute of Contemporary Music Performance where he met Tonra during a songwriting course. They began performing together with Haefeli adding electric guitars. After their first demo started word of mouth on the band, Daughter self-released their debut EP, His Young Heart, on 20 April 2011, recorded in Haefeli’s bedsit. Later that same year, they released another EP, The Wild Youth, on 2 October through artist-led Communion Records. The latter EP earned praise from British website For Folk’s Sake who described Daughter as “one of the unique sounds in the pop landscape today.”\n\nTonra and Haefeli became romantically involved and the guitarist insisted that they “keep our couple life and our band life separate,” as Haaefeli didn’t want to bar Tonra from saying things in her songs that were personal. While Tonra agreed with Haefeli they later ended their relationship before the release of their album If You Leave in 2013.\n\nIn 2012, shortly after headlining a 700-capacity show in London, Daughter announced their signing to UK label 4AD. Their first proper single, “Smother”, was released in October of that year. It was playlisted by both BBC Radio 1 and 6Music, while being awarded Single of the Week by long-time supporter Huw Stephens. In December 2012 the band appeared on the David Letterman Show prior to the release of the record, which Tonra described as “perhaps (…) a cart-before-the-horse situation”.\n\nThough you may not have known their name there is a good chance you’ve heard their music. Daughter has been played on many popular tv shows, such as: Grey’s Anatomy, Vampire Diaries, Teen Wolf, and The Gifted. My personal favorites are, unoriginally, some of the more popular songs, but hey what works works. These favorites include Medicine, Smother, and Youth.\n\n“On Wednesday’s We Wear Pink”\n\nDavid Bowden, known professionally as Pink Sweat$, was born February 14,1992 and is an American singer and songwriter. Pink Sweats didn’t grow up with a lot of musical influence until he was 17 years old, but admired artists like Michael Jackson, Prince, and Kanye West. He became a musical artist after surviving a three-year battle with Achalasia. Achalasia refers to the failure for smooth muscles fibers to relax causing difficulty for food and liquid to pass through the food pipe into the stomach.\n\nHis stage name was adopted as he always wore pink sweatpants and was given the nickname “Pink Sweats”. He first started making music at the age of 19 as a demo vocalist at Sound Stigma Studios, where he discovered his love for songwriting and began to develop his career in music. He produced in different genres of music for rapper Tierra Whack and country duo Florida Georgia Line. On July 12, 2018, he released his first single “Honesty”, which later started to gain attention on streaming platforms, reaching #10 on Spotify‘s US Viral Chart. I know what you’re thinking; “Yeah he sounds cool, but I definetley haven’t heard his songs before.” That’s what I thought when I was listening to some of his less popular songs, then I hit “Honesty.” Seriously this song is on a bunch of social media platforms used for edits or cheesy couple stuff, you’ve definetley heard it. He released the second single “No Replacing You” on July 26 and his debut EP Volume 1 was released on November 2, 2018, as the singer put out a music video for “Drama” later that month. He later followed this release with the sequel EP Volume 2.\n\nI know I didn’t list it in my description of the artist above but my MOST favorite song of his is “Cocaine.” It has a very Khalid vibe to it, while keeping an originality. The harmonies are almost ominous, then you listen to the lyrics and it all comes together. It can be a good cry song or something to play when you’re lying down with your friends in bed to vibe with.\n\nPOEM OF THE WEEK\n\nMixing it up with some rhyme schemes and varying themes\n\nPink is My Colour\n\nBy: Lovina Chidi\n\nPink pants and rosy plants\n\nPink blouses, never failing to arouse spouses\n\nPink hot feverish lips\n\nPassionate pants of pink\n\nLove letters dipped in pink ink\n\nYou see!

Wilson was raised by a Filipina mother and an African-American father. She comes from the Bay Area (California) and has a younger sister. Wilson was introduced to the public as a child prodigy, covering Alicia Keys on piano on the Today Show, before competing on Radio Disney’s The Next BIG Thing when she was 12 years old in 2009. She later signed to RCA Records at the age of 14 and released the single “Something to Prove” under her real name in 2014.\n\nRe-emerging in late 2016 with a new persona and her debut EP, H.E.R. Vol. 1 was released September 9, 2016, produced by songwriter David “Swagg R’Celious” Harris, Wilson received support from big names in the music industry and labelmates Alicia Keys and Bryson Tiller helped get the word out through Twitter co-signs, shout outs, and re-posts. In April 2017, Rihanna posted an Instagram clip with H.E.R.’s track “Focus” playing in the background. The clip has been viewed over 5 million times! She then released subsequent EPs H.E.R. Volume 2 (2017), The B Sides (2017), I Used to Know Her: The Prelude (2018) and I Used to Know Her: Part 2 (2018). Her first compilation album H.E.R. was released in October 2017, consisting of tracks from the singer’s first two EPs plus six additional songs. Her second compilation album I Used to Know Her was released on August 30, 2019. H.E.R. was nominated for five Grammy Awards at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019, winning Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Album.\n\nAddressing the secrecy over her identity, H.E.R. has said: “The mystery is a metaphor for who I am, or who I was at the time of creating the project… I feel like oftentimes we don’t like to be open as people about our emotions or things that we are going through. At the time [of recording], I was very closed off except for when I was writing or when I was in the studio…I am a voice for women who feel like they’re alone in these situations. This project came from emotion, and that’s what I want it to be about – not what I look like or who I’m with, but the raw emotion and support for women.” To NPR she said, “I feel like this is the era of the anti-star. I really just wanted it to be about the music, and get away from, ‘Who is she with?’ and ‘What is she wearing?'”\n\nNPR listed H.E.R. Vol. 1 as the first selection in its “5 Essential R&B Albums You Slept On”. Calling the music “Slow-burning R&B that zooms in on emotional highs and lows,” Rolling Stone included H.E.R. in its March 2017 “10 Artists You Need To Know” roundup. Forbes named her one of “5 Alternative R&B Artists to Look Out for in 2017”, reporting: “In the same vein as The Weeknd’s enigmatic introduction to the world, H.E.R.’s image remains a mystery. The irony, though, is that her moniker is an acronym for Having Everything Revealed.”\n\nPersonal Favorites Include: Hard Place, Changes, Focus, Could’ve Been (Remix), Lights On, Losing, and Every Kind of Way.\n\nMusical Week\n\nAs the Spring 2020 semester befalls us here at Penn State, so don’t passion blogs. I’ve decided to keep my passion blog the same; discussing music and artists that I find totally underrated. This week I’m doing something different, in that, I’ll be talking about my top 3 MALE underrated songs/musicals instead of normal albums and EP’s. As always these songs, and the whole musical playlist can be found on Spotify.\n\n3. MICHAEL IN THE BATHROOM: “Be More Chill” George Salazar\n\nThe Broadway production of “Be More Chill” came out in 2019 and swept the nation with it’s musical adaptation of the same titled novel. The plot revolves around the main character, Jeremy Heere, who takes a pill that is a computer program which will help him become more popular and date the girl he likes. His bestfriend Michael Mell is left behind during a party as Jeremy becomes more and more popular. While at the party Michael has a panic attack while in the bathroom. George Salazar, portrays the panic and confused emotions while using his vibrato to imitate the tremble of someone crying. Michael goes through what seems to be an existential crisis as he questions his life choices and validity to even be living, as he feels he is invisible now that he has been abandoned by his only friend. While the song itself is about a pretty serious mental health issue, George Salazar brings comedy into his performance as most teenagers who feel less of themselves tend to make self-deprecating jokes.\n\n2. WHY GOD, WHY: “Miss Saigon” Will Chase\n\n“Miss Saigon” was, more popularly, Lea Solonga’s breakout role, launching her already forming career. It told the story of two unlikely people coming together and falling in love in 1970’s during the Vietnam War. One being Chris Scott, an American soldier deployed in Vietnam. The other, Kim, a seventeen-year-old South-Vietnamese girl who is forced to work at “Dreamland” a Saigon brothel. While the musical’s debut happened in 1988, my favorite portrayal of Chris is by Will Chase in 2000. He is able to convey sincerity and innocents in his love for Kim and also the frustration that comes with their relationship. “Why God, Why” (click the link and skip to 16:30) is performed while Kim is sleeping. Chris is asking God why he has led him to this moment, with this girl, in Vietnam, even though he will soon have to go back to America. Not only is Chase’s voice beautifully portraying the anger of his life at war and at himself at how easily he fell in love, Chase shows it as well in his physical performance. At one of the climaxes of the song Chase angrily pushes a chair he was sitting on previously, runs up abruptly to the bed, and screams at God while looking at Kim’s sleeping body in bed. It is an extremely powerful moment, letting the audience look into the soul of the American soldier.\n\n1. SHOW STOPPIN NUMBER: “The Guy Who Didn’t Like Musicals” Robert Manion\n\nStarkid Productions has put out a lot of plays, all becoming more meme famous than anything else with a strong cult fandom. They are more recognized for their “Harry Potter” adaptations; however, they have quite a few gems in their list of musicals. One of their most recent, “The Guy Who Didn’t Like Musicals” includes a pessimistic business man who, you guessed it, hates musicals. As an unlikely turn the apocalypse occurs as people start getting infected by aliens and cannot control their singing habits. A scientist, Professor Henry Hidgens, at first attempts to help the protagonists fight the apocalypse but ends up singing out his heart in order to be turned into one of the singing zombies like the rest of the infected in order to be “reborn” (song starts 1:18:00). The song he sings is about a musical he had been writing while getting ready for the apocalypse, “Working Boys”. Robert Manion’s performance is hilariously over emotional and strangely sexual at times. Manion makes his voice higher when Hidgens is in character for his part in the musical, but keeps a low, confident register for most of the song. Honestly, even if you aren’t into musicals, just watch this part because this one performance MADE the musical. If anything just skip to 1:27:37 for the hip swivel. Also, be sure to look at Joey Richter’s, Ted, face throughout the performance, it is so cute.\n\nZEPHYR [ˈzefər] NOUN\n\nA SOFT GENTLE BREEZE\n\nNicole Zefanya, born 24 January 1999, was raised in Jakarta, Indonesia.

He also moved to Pennsylvania as a young child, connecting him to us all at Penn State!\n\nI Ask My Mother to Sing\n\nBy Li-Young Lee\n\nShe begins, and my grandmother joins her.\n\nMother and daughter sing like young girls.\n\nIf my father were alive, he would play\n\nhis accordion and sway like a boat.\n\nI’ve never been in Peking, or the Summer Palace,\n\nnor stood on the great Stone Boat to watch\n\nthe rain begin on Kuen Ming Lake, the picnickers\n\nrunning away in the grass.\n\nBut I love to hear it sung;\n\nhow the waterlilies fill with rain until\n\nthey overturn, spilling water into water,\n\nthen rock back, and fill with more.\n\nBoth women have begun to cry.\n\nBut neither stops her song."
