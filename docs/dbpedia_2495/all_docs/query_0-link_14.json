        "text": "Before rushing out to buy the latest disc from your favorite artist, you might want to wait for the \"new and improved\" version.\n\nIncreasingly, record companies are re-releasing CDs - from movie soundtracks to rap - that have been out for only a few months with \"bonus\" material - remixed songs, new tunes, even DVD material.\n\n\"J.Lo,\" the second disc by Jennifer Lopez, was released in July 2001, but six months later, it was re-released to add a remixed version of the album track \"I'm Real,\" with Ja Rule, which wasn't included in the original version but became a smash hit afterward.\n\nB2K recently re-released their sophomore album, \"Pandemonium,\" with DVD footage and extra tracks, including their latest hit, \"Girlfriend,\" which isn't on the December-released original.\n\nAnd Jay-Z's double-disc \"Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse\" - released in November - was repackaged last month as a single disc, with highlights from the two-CD album and bonus tracks.\n\nWith the industry suffering from lagging sales and Internet piracy, labels say they need new ways to draw customers into stores.\n\n\"I think as our industry continues to change, we've been challenged by the consumer to be more creative,\" said Kevin Liles, president of Def Jam Records, home to Jay-Z and LL Cool J. \"The consumer is saying, 'We want more,' and we want to give them more.\"\n\nDanny Goldberg, president of independent label Artemis Records, sees the new trend as akin to the marketing of movie videos and DVDs.\n\n\"You might get a VHS of something, and then the next thing there is a DVD that has extra stuff on it or something like that,\" Goldberg said.\n\nBut Alayna Hill-Alderman, who owns two Record Archive stores in Rochester, N.Y., is among those who believe the new trend isn't fan friendly.\n\nHill-Alderman says re-releasing new CDs punishes those who have purchased the original.\n\n\"I think it's a very dangerous trend,\" she said. \"It's confusing to the consumer, it's confusing to the retailer.\"\n\nGoldberg, however, doesn't think it's been a problem.\n\n\"I don't think there's a huge history of consumer complaints,\" he said.\n\nRecord industry executives say the goal isn't to force consumers to buy the same album twice, but to satisfy die-hard fans.\n\n\"(Some) fans want every ounce of information,\" said Ceci Kurzman, vice president of Epic Records' worldwide marketing. \"This is really incredibly valuable for that consumer.\"\n\nKurzman was product manager of the \"Chicago\" soundtrack, released in January, which has been a surprise hit with more than 1 million copies sold. In March, Epic released a \"limited edition\" version of the original, with a bonus DVD containing behind-the-scenes footage of the Oscar-winning movie, archival material and other features.\n\n\"The idea was for people who wanted this extra content and people who were enormous fans of the film ... (to have) an option to buy the soundtrack with this additional content,\" she said.\n\nThe re-release of an album can breathe new life - and sales - into it. In February, Def Jam rushed out a new version of LL Cool J's four-month-old \"10\" to include \"All I Have,\" a song he did for Lopez's \"This Is Me ... Then\" album that had become a huge hit. The week before the album's re-release, it sold about 11,000 copies; afterward, it sold 66,000.\n\nMary J. Blige's \"No More Drama\" was released in late August 2001. Although its first single was a hit, sales were modest. Five months later, the album was released again - with four additional songs and a new cover. The new version shot up the charts.\n\n\"I think those albums that they usually pull back and re-release, it's because sales aren't doing really well,\" said rapper 50 Cent. \"It's because they had to go in and make another single.\"\n\nHis debut disc, \"Get Rich or Die Tryin',\" released in February, is the year's best-selling disc so far, with 4.3 million albums sold.\n\nHe, too, has released additional songs - but with a twist. The project, \"The New Breed,\" is sold as a DVD, with documentary-style footage of the rapper and live performances, along with a CD with three extra songs.\n\n\"The New Breed\" debuted at No. 2 in April, with 246,000 copies sold. \"That's a way for them (fans) to get some new music,\" said 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson.\n\nBoth Liles of Def Jam and record store owner Hill-Alderman agree the record industry needs to find new ways to satisfy fans' desire for new music between albums.\n\n\"They should be introducing sort of stopgap material,\" Hill-Alderman said. \"They should release that material as a separate piece.\"\n\nLiles says re-released albums are a way to do it.\n\n\"You have to do different things,\" he said. \"Really, at the end of the day, it's just forcing us to step up to that challenge.\""
