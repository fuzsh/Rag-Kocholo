It was released on October 15, 2021. The album is preceded by the lead double single, A Kiss x Forever Always.\n\nBackground[]\n\nDuring September 2019 the band began working on new tracks for a new album.\n\nRocky clarified that the track (A Kiss and Forever Always) were mixed while in Utah, in preparation for Riker's wedding, while taking calls from his manager. Rocky clarifies that the clues were spontaneous, that they always do things at the last minute and that they were happy with the end result.[1]\n\nOn March 19, the band revealed that they would be sharing two songs (OMG Plz Don't Come Around and flashdrive) during the month as they finalize the album.[2] The next day they said the release date would be April 2.[3] 5 days later (March 25, 2020) they shared the cover that would accompany the double single.[4] A visual of the song was posted on youtube the same day the double single was released\n\nRocky announced, on his Instagram account on June 26, 2020, that a new single would drop on July 10, 2020 but did not say its title.[5]\n\nOn July 6, 2020 the band the band published the pre-save link on their Instagram account for Take Me Away.[6] Ten days later, Ross shared a behind-the-scenes short of the music video in his Instagram stories. The video premiered on MTV’s Friday Live Stream, where they landed in the top 5 fan-requested artists in the previous week’s show.[7] On July 26, the band posted a couple of bts of the music video to their Instagram account.[8]\n\nOn August 3, 2020, the band shared the cover, title and date of the single (Places) on their social media.[9] On Sepember 25, 2020, the band shared the cover, title and date of the single (Fade) on their social media.[10]\n\nOn April 1, 2021, on the Livestream for Paste Magazine, Ross talked about the track (Heaven Angel) and the creative process behind it.[11] The band shared the cover and release date of the single on June 30, 2021 on Instagram.[12] On the same day the single was released, the band did a live on YouTube where they said the album could be released in October and that before that they would release a couple more tracks. Mary Jane was confirmed as one of the songs that will be on the LP.[13] However, the track did not make the final cut of the album.\n\nMusic and composition[]\n\nRoss during his interview with SPIN:\n\n“What’s exciting about these songs is that they all have different creation times, in that some of them have been in the process for a year or two and some of them we just started making a few months ago,” Ross added. “We didn’t just sit down and start making the album right here, right now. The songs all came from different points in our lives.”[14]\n\nRoss for CLASH magazine:\n\n“When COVID first hit and then the BLM movement was happening, there was a hesitation to release anything. We didn’t want to distract from what was going on. We took the time to relax and reset. Eventually, we got back in the studio and made music hardcore again. It was nice to take that break.”\n\n“...We have so many songs that we love and just want to get them out. Eventually we want to do a complete body of work, but as of right now it isn’t a collective piece.”[15]\n\nRocky for DORK Magazine:\n\n\"We're always wanting to create something that doesn't exist yet on our hard drive or in our minds. We could release a 30-song album right now, but the problem is in the process of making this album – because we're in our house, we make our own schedules – we'd quickly just keep wanting that fresh, new idea.\"[16]\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nArtwork[]\n\nSingles[]\n\n\"A Kiss\" and \"Forever Always\" were released as a double single on October 25, 2019 from the album.\n\n\"OMG Plz Don't Come Around\" and \"flashdrive\" were released as a double promotional single on April 2, 2020 from the album.\n\n\"Take Me Away\" was released on July 10, 2020 as the third official single from the album.\n\n\"Places\" was released on August 7, 2020 as the fourth official single from the album.\n\n\"Fade\" was released on September 25, 2020 as the fifth official single from the album.\n\n\"Heaven Angel\" was released on July 9, 2021 as the sixth official single from the album.\n\n\"#1 Fan\" was released on August 13, 2021 as the seventh official single from the album.\n\n\"Leave Me Feeling Confident\" was released on September 27, 2021 as the second promtional single from the album.\n\nTrack listing[]\n\nNo. Title Length 1. \"Heart of Mine\" 04:24 2. \"cray z babe e\" 03:13 3. \"Leave Me Feeling Confident\" 03:49 4. \"Beautiful Girl\" 03:04 5. \"#1 Fan\" 03:06 6. \"Heaven Angel\" 03:39 7. \"When You Need a Man\" 03:27 8. \"Plz Don't Come Around (Interlude)\" 01:10 9. \"OMG Plz Don't Come Around\" 03:49 10. \"Places\" 03:19 11. \"A Kiss\" 04:32 12. \"Fade\" 04:00 13. \"flashdrive\" 03:33 14. \"Take Me Away\" 03:24 15. \"Forever Always\" 03:24\n\nTotal length:\n\n51:53"
