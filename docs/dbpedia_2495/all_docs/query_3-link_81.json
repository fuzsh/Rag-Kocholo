        "text": "Matthew S. Brenneman, 40, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Danicka M. Bergeson in Hennepin County District Court, a little over a year after police found Brenneman covered in bleach in Bergeson’s bathroom and her dead body wrapped tightly in blankets on her bed.\n\nThe plea carries a sentence of just under 24 years. That is an upward departure from sentencing guidelines, which Hennepin County prosecutor Erin Lutz said was justified due to two aggravating Blakely factors (when prosecutors seek a sentence that exceeds state law) attached to the murder charge.\n\nThose factors were that Brenneman murdered Bergeson in her zone of privacy, because it was in her bedroom, and that he treated her with particular cruelty because he left her body to decompose.\n\nBrenneman had a history of abusing Bergeson, a 33-year-old former Army medic, and was under an order to not have any contact when he went to her apartment and killed her sometime between June 29 and July 8 last year. Brenneman had been released from jail a few days earlier, after pleading guilty to domestic assault charges.\n\nBrenneman affirmed that he was under a no-contact order when he went to the Ramsgate Apartments in Hopkins where Bergeson lived. He said they spent time together and watched fireworks on the Fourth of July — a claim which drew invective from Bergeson’s family and led Moreno to tell them they needed to remain quiet or leave the court.\n\nBrenneman affirmed that at some point he and Bergeson started arguing, that he pinned her down to her bed and caused bruising on her chest and arm. He admitted that he knew it was “day two or three of not drinking” for Bergeson and that she could become physically weak when abstaining from alcohol.\n\nHe admitted that at some point she stopped resisting. That he did not administer aid. That he left her in her bed. That he did not check on her for days. That he did not call for help. And once he realized she was dead, he wrapped her body in a plastic bag.\n\n“To hear him tell his story and us not to tell our story is difficult,” he said. “He only has to tell enough just to meet the criteria of the charges. It’s like he can make up what he wants as he goes along, and that’s what we have to listen to.”\n\nCharging documents said that when cops were called to Danicka Bergeson’s apartment on July 8, 2023, they found Brenneman in the bathroom, seeming to have just drank bleach. Bergeson was dead in her bed. Officers wrote that Brenneman had bruising and swelling to his cheek, scratches and scrapes to his face, arms and legs, “and distinctive scratches to his back consistent with fingernail scrapes.” There was an apparent suicide note written on the kitchen table, which read, “Things happened abruptly, I didn’t know what to do and tried to go on a couple days. I can’t try to live after this. The end, Matthew.” Several other drafts of the note were in the garbage.\n\nJust days earlier, Brenneman had been released from jail after pleading guilty to two domestic assault charges stemming from incidents in April and May of 2023. In April, Brenneman punched Bergeson, leaving her with a black eye. In May, he strangled her, said he was going to kill her and left her with what the charges referred to as “substantial bruising to her body and marks on her neck.”\n\nIn December, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office secured an indictment against Brenneman, including one count of first-degree murder while committing domestic abuse with a past pattern of domestic abuse, which carries the potential for a life sentence with the possibility of parole. The indictment also included two counts of second-degree murder.\n\nCourt records also show that Brenneman was the subject of an order for protection in 2021 from a different partner, after he was accused of pinning her to a bed during a drunken rage.\n\nBergeson’s family said that, given all of the evidence and Brenneman’s history, the plea agreement left them feeling like justice evaded them — even as they praised the prosecution for their handling of the case."
