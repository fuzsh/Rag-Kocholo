        "text": "Donna at her home\n\nThis photo is taken after Ritchieâs death during an interview.\n\nPhoto part of the same interview.\n\nDonna shares her memories of Ritchie\n\nRitchie was my first true love and my first experience losing someone I loved. Ritchie was a truly good guy; kind and polite. He liked to dress well and always look good. I still remember his aftershave, âOld Spice.â Ritchie spoke often about his family. He wanted to buy his mom a home. Ritchieâs mom and I grew close. She made me feel like family and she taught me how to cook Ritchieâs favorite foods: tamales, menudo and enchiladas. Ritchieâs family has influenced me and my family by showing me that with the love and support of family nothing is too difficult. They are a blessing to me and my family.\n\nDonna was a great comfort to Ritchieâs mom and sisters after Ritchieâs death. Donna has attended the Winter Dance Party Concert for the last several years as a special guest. Her graciousness to Ritchieâs fans and support of Ritchieâs family continues to show the bond that was created almost sixty years ago.\n\nThe Ritchie Valens family would like to acknowledge Alan Clark (The Alan Clark Archives), Donna Fox, Judy Willis and Michelle Hoover (Photographer) for their contribution to this page."
