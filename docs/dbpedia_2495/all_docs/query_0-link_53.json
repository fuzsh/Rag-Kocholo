        "text": "Presenting the best Omarion albums, ranked. This votable list includes all four solo albums from the famous R&B singer, as well as his 2007 collaborative album with rapper Bow Wow, Face Off. In 2005, a year after the breakup of B2K, Omarion, real name Omari Ishmael Grandberry, released his debut album, O, which drove enough sales to earn Gold certification. Both O and his 2006 followup, 21, were chart-topping albums in the US.\n\nDuring the 2010s, Omarion became a prolific collaborator, featuring on many top rappers' tracks, and his two lattermost albums, 2010's Ollusion and 2014's Sex Playlist, saw his favors duly returned, with features from names such as Gucci Mane, Jeremih, Chris Brown, and Rick Ross.\n\nFrom old to new albums, Omarion's discography is full of gems, but it's up to you to decide which record is the best of the best. Vote up your favorite Omarion albums below to decide which one takes home the gold."
