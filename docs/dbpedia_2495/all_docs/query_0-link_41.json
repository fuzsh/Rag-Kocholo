        "text": "It's just a case of offering value. A lot of people would pick up a single like Jam, see it has 4 versions of the same song, and put it straight back down. Same thing if it's just got the album version of Girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, if you had an unreleased song like Carousel, Price of Fame, Al Capone or Sunset Driver, every time a new single came out, you'd suddenly find that every MJ fan was buying every CD single.\n\nUnlikely. Most people didn't buy an album and a single from it. They bought 1 or the other. So they wouldn't know that a song is exclusive to the 45 or maxi single. Sometimes B-sides were only on a 12\" maxi single or in Prince's case, a longer version of the B-side instead of the 45 edit. So unless a person is interested in dance remixes, they won't buy it. Not every place sold maxi singles anyway. It's usually hardcore fans who are aware of exclusive B-side songs (Prince, Sting, Depeche Mode, Tori Amos, etc.). Many people don't even care about an artists album. They only care about the songs they heard on the radio. That's why Greatest Hits/Best Of compilations are popular and there's also oldies radio stations. With some artists, their Greatest Hits sold way more than any of their regular albums (Eagles, ABBA, Queen, The Carpenters, Johnny Mathis, etc.)\n\nHere's the thing. I posted a comment earlier saying this exact thing. Without a physical, tangible object (i.e. 7\" or 12\" single) there is no such thing as a B side.\n\nNon-album songs put on a CD single were also called B-sides. Sometimes there were multiple extra tracks up to 3 or 4. Although a CD only has 1 side. Not exactly the same thing, but some artists like Mariah Carey would record different vocals for remixes. In some cases the remix or re-recorded version was on the single and the music video. One example is No One Is To Blame by Howard Jones. The single version has Phil Collins playing drums and on background vocals, Phil isn't on the album version. I had Howard's album already before that was released as a single, so I knew it was different. Some people would buy these albums and get upset that the radio/video version wasn't on it, lol. There was song Whitney Houston had out in the 1990s called If I Told You That. The album version is Whitney solo, but the single version is a George Michael duet. The 12\" version of Mike's You Can't Win is different from the one on The Wiz soundtrack & movie.\n\nNon-album songs put on a CD single were also called B-sides.

The 12\" version of Mike's You Can't Win is different from the one on The Wiz soundtrack & movie.\n\nI know. I lived through that era.\n\nIf they are specifically talking about songs that Michael originally released as B sides but which are now available online then I can understand people continuing to use that term (although maybe not since he often used previous album tracks as B sides)\n\nYeah, if we mean actual \"B-Sides\", ie from a vinyl or CD, then MJ only had a handful in his whole career. Come Together being one. It's sad that this stands out as a rare example.\n\nI guess more recently, these have simply been labelled as \"previously unreleased\", or just \"extras\". It's actually pretty sad that in the last decade, albums stopped having 12 tracks, and instead started to have 10 tracks and \"2 exclusive bonus tracks!!\"\n\nMichael didn't really have many B Sides...I don't think he liked having them.\n\nYeah, that's the strange part.\n\nI think in the UK he only had 7 number ones. Most singles would get to number 3 or 4. It could easily have been double or triple this number if they'd put in a little effort with the actual release.\n\nUnlikely. Most people didn't buy an album and a single from it. They bought 1 or the other. So they wouldn't know that a song is exclusive to the 45 or maxi single.\n\nI'm not talking about most people. Specifically MJ fans, who might think \"I'm just gonna buy the album\". These are the people Sony should try to convert into people who say \"I have to buy the new single because it's the only place I can get Carousel!\"\n\nAlso in more recent years various stores have different versions of albums where some of the songs are different (Target exclusive, Barnes & Noble, Best Buy).\n\nAnd that's a really sucky practice. I blame Americans for being gullible enough to accept it.\n\nHow great it would have been, when on each of the different Invincible CD’s (I’m talking about the colored covers) there would have been one different hidden track for each color.\n\nThat would be fucking disgusting. Taking advantage of your customers just turns them off. I don't live in a world where that's great.\n\nA single for £1.99 is very reasonable if you get 3 brand new tracks with it. But it's totally unacceptable to sell a £14.99 album multiple times just to get one extra song.\n\nI was happy enough to buy one copy of Invincible. There's absolutely no way I would buy 4 versions of it.\n\nThat would be fucking disgusting. Taking advantage of your customers just turns them off.

But it's totally unacceptable to sell a £14.99 album multiple times just to get one extra song.\n\nI was happy enough to buy one copy of Invincible. There's absolutely no way I would buy 4 versions of it.\n\nHow is that taking advantage of customers? People buy & collect all kinds of things, like Funko Pops or MCU popcorn bins. Years ago there was a person who paid $24,000 for Paul McCartney's birth certificate. Some rock bands like KISS make more money from their merchandising than their records. I remember acts like New Kids On The Block & MC Hammer had 1-900 phone numbers to call which cost a certain amount of money for each minute. People, mainly teens, called it. People also pay hundreds of dollars to see veteran acts in concert like The Rolling Stones and some current ones too like Taylor Swift. That's more money than buying 4 copies of Invincible.\n\nThere was no rule that said it had to be a bonus track or rare or unreleased. It was literally designed as filler for the second side of a record when flipped.\n\nPeople need to remember Michael came up on Motown. Go back and count how many singles he was featured on during the 70s that contained a b side not otherwise available on an album. It's a very short list.\n\nIn some cases, it was the B-side that became the big hit, not the A-side (Carl Douglas - Kung Fu Fighting, Salt n Pepa - Push It). The Beatles often had what was called a double sided hit. Both sides hit the Top 10. This is also the case with Hey Ya/The Way You Move by OutKast\n\nMotown back then was more about having 20 of their artists record the same song than non-album B-sides. So if Mike was following that he would have released covers albums like Rod Stewart was doing with those series of Great American Songbook CDs. He did release a few remakes: It's The Falling In Love, Come Together, Girlfriend, & The Jacksons' Blame It On The Boogie.\n\nHow is that taking advantage of customers?\n\nIf you can't see that being manipulated into buying an album 4 times is disrespectful, then I guess I can't help you.\n\nThere was no rule that said it had to be a bonus track or rare or unreleased. It was literally designed as filler for the second side of a record when flipped.\n\nI'm not saying there's a rule. I'm just saying a single that offers value will sell more copies than a single that doesn't.\n\nReleasing 3 or 4 brand new songs on a single is a purchase incentive. On the other hand, releasing a remix or live version is seen as cheap. Releasing a straight album track is even worse than that.\n\nPeople need to remember Michael came up on Motown. Go back and count how many singles he was featured on during the 70s that contained a b side not otherwise available on an album. It's a very short list.\n\nExactly. That's the point we're making! And let's not forget the majority of his career on Motown wasn't actually that successful.\n\nThe Beatles often had what was called a double sided hit.\n\nThe Beatles were special in that a lot of the time the A-side wasn't on any album.\n\nCan you imagine how many #1s MJ would have had if he released singles that weren't on an album? Hint: all of them.\n\nIf you can't see that being manipulated into buying an album 4 times is disrespectful, then I guess I can't help you.\n\nYeah, Mike and/or Epic Records held a gun up to people heads to force them to buy multiple copies. Invincible is not the first or the last album to have more than 1 cover. There's a video of a guy who buys the same album from different countries (mainly heavy metal acts). All of them had the same cover and songs, the only difference is the scan bar code for each country, but in some cases the songs are in a different order. The only way he could have done that is to buy imports, which most stores did not sell. He bought some from online. There's anther guy who buys the record, cassette, CD (also 8-track tape & reel to reel if there are those) of the same album. He has done this with a lot of releases. I guess these guys were manipulated too. The 2nd guy must have played the record backwards and it had a subliminal message saying \"buy this album in multiple formats\"\n\nI'm not saying there's a rule. I'm just saying a single that offers value will sell more copies than a single that doesn't.\n\nReleasing 3 or 4 brand new songs on a single is a purchase incentive. On the other hand, releasing a remix or live version is seen as cheap. Releasing a straight album track is even worse than that.\n\nExactly. That's the point we're making! And let's not forget the majority of his career on Motown wasn't actually that successful.\n\nThe Beatles were special in that a lot of the time the A-side wasn't on any album.\n\nCan you imagine how many #1s MJ would have had if he released singles that weren't on an album? Hint: all of them.\n\nHow many artists actually release a single with 3 or 4 brand-new songs? Every single I've ever bought in the mid-2000s contained either a remix, live or alternate version of the title track or something from the same album. This wasn't specific to Michael Jackson.\n\nIn my personal opinion, The Beatles are overrated. They had very little competition in way of other artists. Ditto Elvis. Ditto Cliff Richard. If they had been around in the 80's up against the likes of Prince, MJ, Madonna, Whitney, the amount of choice and genre....I doubt they'd have done as well.\n\nIn the USA, all of the singles were on albums, because their albums released on Capitol Records (USA, Canada) were different from the ones released elsewhere.\n\nYeah, I know. But none of the American stuff counts. I'm just talking about the original discography. They made a point of keeping albums and singles separate. Therefore both did well.\n\nYeah, Mike and/or Epic Records held a gun up to people heads to force them to buy multiple copies. Invincible is not the first or the last album to have more than 1 cover.\n\nAgain, I'm not talking about what's worse. I'm talking about what's bad.\n\nIt's always a crappy idea for a record company to try to make people buy an album twice just to get one song. That's all there is to say.\n\nHow many artists actually release a single with 3 or 4 brand-new songs?\n\nMost bands in the 90s.\n\nEVERY Oasis single came on one 4-track CD, containing 3 brand new songs you'd never heard before (occasionally one of them was a demo or live version).\n\nEVERY Foo Fighters single and EVERY Radiohead single and EVERY Supernaturals single came on two 3-track CDs, containing 4 tracks you'd never heard before (occasionally one of them was a demo or remix).\n\nSee also Bush, Garbage, U2, Nirvana, Ash, Stereophonics, Skunk Anansie and Travis...\n\nIt very much was the standard. Some bands even used to release 3 CDs of B-sides for each single, or otherwise the cassette and vinyl single might have different B-sides. MJ was simply uncompetitive, in a competitive market.\n\nIn my personal opinion, The Beatles are overrated. .....I doubt they'd have done as well.\n\nThat just makes you sound silly. And jealous.\n\nThe explanation that Michael Jackson himself provided about the different colors of the 'Invincible' album was not only disrespectful but also ridiculous:\n\n\"Because we wanted the fans to have some fun with it and collect them ... there's albums that I love and I will buy them 5 times, even though I have the same cover. Like, 5 times 'cause I love that album so much. So, imagine if they did a different color or just changed the color, I would buy it 5 more times. We just wanted the fans to have some fun with the pictures and with the colors ... That's why we did it\" (Michael Jackson, October 2001)\n\nHe talked about the fans/potential buyers of that album as if he referred to naive, 5-year-old children."
