        "text": "ADDING BALANCE TO YOUR LIFE\n\nJhené Aiko Efuru Chilombo (born March 16, 1988) is an American singer and songwriter, who embarked on her music career contributing vocals and appearing in several music videos for R&B group B2K. At the time, she was known as B2K member Lil’ Fizz’s “cousin”, though she is not actually related to him. It was used as a marketing tool, suggested by Sony and Epic Records, to promote Aiko through B2K and attract an audience. In 2003, Aiko was set to release her debut album, My Name Is Jhené, through her labels Sony, The Ultimate Group and Epic, however the album was never released, with Aiko eventually asking to be released from the label in order to continue her education.\n\nIn March 2011, Aiko made her return to music with the release of her first full-length project, a mixtape titled Sailing Soul(s). On December 16, 2011, Aiko signed a recording contract with American record producer No I.D.’s record label ARTium, distributed through Def Jam Recordings. In 2013, Aiko appeared on Big Sean’s single “Beware”, also featuring Lil Wayne, which became her first top 40 single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In November 2013, she released her first project for Artium and Def Jam, an extended play, titled Sail Out. The EP was supported by the singles “3:16AM”, “Bed Peace” and “The Worst”, the latter of which went on to become certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Aiko released her major-label debut album, Souled Out, on September 9, 2014. On September 22, 2017, she released her second studio album Trip. My favorite song of her’s, “New Balance”, came out in October of 2017 and was featured on this album.\n\nOn March 6, 2020, she released her third studio album entitled by her surname, Chilombo. This album contains twenty songs and a number of collaborations including John Legend, Future, and Dr, Chill. It is also very much inspired by her break up with performer Big Sean who she used to duo with him as Twenty88. Aiko wanted this album to have a more tranquill feel and took inspiration from Hawai’i, where she recorded the album. Along with artist H.E.R, who has been talked about before on this blog, Aiko collaborated on the song “B.S” in early March. On April 23, H.E.R. and Aiko live streamed themselves singing their song together in their respective houses for charity due to the COVOID-19 pandemic.\n\nA TIME FOR CHANGE\n\nAlt-J (written as alt-J) is an English indie rock band formed in 2007 in Leeds. The band’s symbol is the Greek letter delta, Δ, which can symbolize change or difference in math and science. Alt-J was formed when Gwil Sainsbury (guitar/bass), Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals) and Thom Sonny Green (drums) met at Leeds University in 2007.\n\nAfter graduating, the band moved to Cambridge where they spent several months working on their music before signing a deal with Infectious Music in December 2011. Their self-titled 4-track demo EP, was recorded with producer in London and featured the tracks “Breezeblocks”, “Hand-Made”, “Matilda”, and “Tessellate”. It’s fair to say you have heard the song “Breezeblocks” as it had a really long air time on the radio and has been used in quite a few tv shows and movies like the Netflix original Daybreak. An Awesome Wave, their first full album was compiled of the EP songs plus 10 more. Their debut album was released on 28 May 2012 in the UK, Europe, and Australia, and on 18 September 2012 in North America via and received largely favourable reviews and was described as a “captivating blend of insatiable grooves and profound poignancy”.\n\nIn April 2012, alt-J and played a minor headlining tour around the United Kingdom and Ireland in October of that year and were featured regularly on summer festivals. They also did concert tour in the United States in December 2012 and performed at the Laneway Festival tour in Australia. In November 2012 the band were announced as the winners of the Mercury Prize for their album. Besides the prize-money, the band saw an increase in their profile resulting in An Awesome Wave reaching 13 in the UK album chart.\n\nIn early June 2014, alt-J announced a 2014 tour to take place in North America over October and November. The 23-day tour started in Vancouver, B.C. on 14 October and ended in Washington, D.C. on 19 November. On 9 June 2014, they announced their second album This Is All Yours, that was released on 22 September 2014. This Is All Yours went straight to Number 1 on the UK’s Official Albums Chart, this album also contains one of my favorite songs by them, “Left Hand Free”. alt-J headlined the September 2015 edition of Boston Calling Music Festival.\n\nOn 3 March 2017 alt-J began teasing their third studio album on their social media accounts with an audio clip captioned “00110011 01110111 01110111” (the ASCII code for “3ww”). The band reported later that day that their third album would be titled Relaxer and was scheduled for release on 2 June 2017. On 6 March 2017 alt-J released “3WW,” which features lead singer Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice, as a digital single and announced dates for the Relaxer Tour in support of the album. In anticipation of their third album, the band released an online video game, soundtracked by their single “3WW,” as well as announcing in May 2017 that they would be playing a five-date UK tour at seaside venues, starting on 4 September 2017. The album was released shortly afterwards, on 2 June 2017, to generally favorable reviews. “Deadcrush,” the fourth single from the album, was featured as a soundtrack in the popular FIFA 18 game. Relaxer was nominated for the 2017 Mercury Prize.\n\nOn 28 September 2018 an alternative version of Relaxer was released. The album, titled REDUXER, is a “rap heavy do-over” of the previous year’s record.\n\nFROM THE GARDEN\n\nJonathon Ng, born the 23rd of December 1995, began independently releasing tracks as The Eden Project in 2013. In 2014, he released the album Kairos, in which he experimented with a more subdued alternative style of music. In October 2014, he released the Entrance EP, proving his most popular tracks were deviations from his usual sound. At the start of 2015, Ng further embraced his indie style with the Bipolar Paradise EP, whose track “Fumes” has amassed over 15 million views on YouTube as of January 2019. He later announced that he was discontinuing The Eden Project, and released Final Call, his last EP under the alias. It contained two covers, one being “Crazy In Love” by Beyoncé, which is the best cover of this song I have ever heard. “Times Like These” is officially the last song released under his former alias.\n\nNg changed his alias to EDEN following the release of Final Call, and began recording new work in spring 2015. The End Credits EP was released for free download worldwide on 8 August. The EP consists of indie pop and alternative electronica tracks with a strong emphasis on vocals. Two singles, “Nocturne” and “Gravity”, were released in June and July, respectively. As a whole, the EP has amassed over 14 million plays on the streaming platform SoundCloud.\n\nShortly after his End Credits tour, Ng announced that his new EP, I Think You Think Too Much of Me, which includes my favorites of his work, would be released on 19 August 2016. On 10 June 2016, the first single, “sex”, was released, featuring a greater focus on vocals and instrumentation. This song has to be one of my favorites. The title implies a very different vibe than what is actually given; the song is incredibly heartbreaking while also being fun to sing at the top of your lungs. A month later, Billboard premiered the next single, “drugs”, a day before its official release on 15 July 2016. After release, the EP charted on the Irish Albums Chart, becoming Ng’s first charting music. The music video for “drugs” is really cool since it’s a 360 degree video experience in virtual reality. The video amassed 1.5 million Facebook views in one week.\n\nOn 8 November 2017, Eden hinted toward the release of a new single on social media. On 8 and 9 November, Eden’s website displayed coordinates where people scavenged to find posters hidden in various locations across the world. “Gold” was officially released 10 November 2017 alongside the announcement of the Vertigo World Tour, which will span from March to May 2018. Eden’s third single for the album, “Crash”, was released on 8 December 2017 on Spotify and iTunes.\n\nVertigo was released on 19 January 2018. Eden began the Vertigo World Tour in promotion of the album in March 2018. The tour ran for eight months, concluding on 27 November. On 29 June 2018, Eden released an EP called About Time from the collection of songs which were played during the Vertigo World Tour during the break between parts 2 and 3 of the tour. Eden released a single, “909”, on 24 April 2019. Two singles, “Untitled” and “Projector” were released during October 2019. In December 2019, “Love, Death, Distraction” and later in January 2020 “Isohel” was released as part of Eden’s album No Future, which was released on 14 February 2020.\n\nThe week before break I took part in our CAS department’s “Deliberation Nation”. My group’s topic was on the involvement of automation in manufacturing in America and how people see different solutions, or if we even need a change. However, we had a pretty rocky start getting to this subject. At first we all wanted to do our project on the recycling, or lack of it, in Penn State dorms. We figured our audience we be interested because of their close involvement in the problem and the topic would be easily accessible to research. Sadly, as excited as we were, this subject just wasn’t right for the assignment and would lead to a more difficult project. Under the time crunch we quickly decided to go a different direction, AI and automation being used in American manufacturing.\n\nI think the main problem we had during this project was the confusion. We all believed our first idea was pretty interesting, but we didn’t consider what actually makes something a deliberation. Then there was a problem with what exactly we meant by automation and AI, we weren’t using the same definitions at first and some people used the terms interchangeably. These problems got sorted out after our practice deliberation, so I think we did really well at listening to critiques and solving the problems we had at first. Also, though we had some problems with our topic, we all worked well together. Everyone worked together and listened to everyone else’s ideas. I didn’t work closely with everyone in the group, but my personal experience in my mini group was really positive. We were both very busy so we split up the work and set a schedule for our individual parts to be due. This system seemed to work be effective for us, and I’m pretty certain the other mini groups did something similar.\n\nSomething I would change about my own involvement and work, would be helping others in other mini groups. I had a pretty light workload, and could have tried to spend more time with the issue guide group because they seemed to be swamped. I got preoccupied with other classes, but if I were to do this again I would definitely try to set aside some time to help the introduction group since they seemed to have the hardest job.\n\nThe deliberation I sat in on was “Babies ‘R’ Us”, which was about genetic modification in unborn children. They talked about what judgments in morality would make of genetic modification, what time of modification would be done (physical character traits or genetic disorders or both), and how this would effect the economy and social structure. Some things I thought they did better than my group was the chair setup, their presentation style, and the easy follow along. They set up their chairs in a circle which made it a lot easier to talk to each other. This setup made everyone easy to see, so raising hands and just talking was pretty effective compared to the picking on people we did. Also when presenting no one stood up. This made everyone seem equal in their opinions and more comfortable since it seemed less formal. There were also pauses in each presentation to ask questions instead of reading everything through. This made fleshing out our thoughts and opinions much easier because we did not have to remember everything we thought since a talking session would take place soon. The overview mini group also made their notes easy to view. Instead of using their laptops, everything was written on large notepad papers and hung up after each argument. This made things a lot easier when we could look back on what was already said and realize we were talking in circles and we should move to another question or argument.\n\nOverall, Deliberation Nation was a stressful experience to work on, but a fun thing to participate in. I would definitely do this event again now that I know what to expect and I think I would do a lot better. That being said I’m proud of the work me and my group did, especially the public speaking portion of it. We all worked really hard and I think it paid off into a interesting and well executed deliberation.\n\nRock Throughout This Land\n\nI feel like I have been repeating myself too much throughout these posts about music, so here is one a bit different than the previous. Gary Lee Clark Jr. was born February 15, 1984 and is an American musician from Austin, Texas. He is best known for his fusion of blues, rock and soul music with elements of hip hop. In 2011 Clark signed with Warner Bros Records and released The Bright Lights EP. It was followed by the albums Blak and Blu (2012) and The Story of Sonny Boy Slim (2015). Throughout his career Clark has been a prolific live performer, which has been documented in two releases; Gary Clark Jr. Live (2014) and Gary Clark Jr Live/North America (2017). He has shared the stage with Eric Clapton, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, B.B. King and the Rolling Stones.\n\nIn November of 2017, the DC Comics’ cinematic extended universe, DCEU, released its first team superhero movie entitled Justice League. Though the movie has mixed reviews, something that can’t be denied is its great soundtrack. The song used throughout multiple trailers, and the movie itself, was Gary Lee Clark Jr’s version of the hit song “Come Together”, which was originally, and famously, created in 1969 and recorded by The Beatles.\n\nHis latest album, This Land, was released on February 22, 2019. In 2020, he won the Grammy Award for “Best Rock Song” and “Best Rock Performance” for the song “This Land” from his album of the same name. “This Land” is a song about the persecutions of black people in America, and how they still are not treated or believed to be true Americans, something very close to Clark’s heart as he is African American himself. As of right now Clark is the proud owner of four of his six nominations for a Grammy award.\n\nPOEM OF THE WEEK\n\nMixing it up with some rhyme schemes and varying themes\n\nThe Oppressionists\n\nBy Jayne Cortez\n\nArt\n\nwhat do the art\n\nsuppressors\n\ncare about art\n\nthey jump on bandwagons\n\nwallow in press clips\n\n& stink up the planet\n\nwith their\n\npornographic oppression\n\nArt\n\nwhat do they care about art\n\nthey go from being\n\ncontemporary baby kissers to\n\nold time corrupt politicians\n\nto self-appointed censorship clerks\n\nwho won’t support art\n\nbut will support war\n\npoverty\n\nlung cancer\n\nracism\n\ncolonialism\n\nand toxic sludge\n\nthat’s their morality\n\nthat’s their religious conviction\n\nthat’s their protection of the public\n\n& contribution to family entertainment\n\nwhat do they care about art\n\nWe all know that the affordability, efficiency, and sustainability of cleaner, greener energy will be a major challenge for this century. Some have called natural gas a better and cleaner energy source. Yet, the process of extracting the gas (called hydraulic fracturing or fracking) proves problematic for both environmentalists as well as those in proximity to the wells.\n\nHydraulic fracturing (ʺfrackingʺ) is the fracturing of rock by a pressurized liquid. This technique consists on injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure in order to create small fractures and facilitate the extraction of gas and oil. Hydraulic fracturing can report important economic benefits to many countries but entails important environmental and public health risks. The history of fracking can be traced back to 1862 during the American Civil War when Col. Edward Roberts realised that oil could be extracted through the use of explosives.\n\nToday, there are horizontal wells using massive hydraulic fracturing in the USA, Canada and China. However, some countries, such as France and Tunisia, aware of the environmental and health dangers of fracking have decided to ban it. But is the impact of fracking mostly positive or negative?\n\nFracking Pros\n\n1. Economy\n\nThe main benefit is the impact on the economy. The technique allows companies to access oil and gas difficult to get by traditional drilling methods. Therefore it would contribute develop a new industry and the economy in areas where gas extraction was not possible before. It can also contribute to increase the offer of gas and oil, on which our economy is so dependent, keeping consumer prices down.\n\n2. Security and Environment\n\nFracking is positive in terms of energy security as countries may become less dependent on oil and gas imports and avoid the impacts of fluctuation in oil prices. Fracking may have an indirect positive impact on environment. If you take into consideration that the technique is mostly used to extract natural gas, which produces far less carbon dioxide emissions than other commonly used sources of energy, such as coal.\n\nFracking Cons\n\n1. Water Pollution\n\nHydraulic fracturing is criticized for wasting a considerable amount of fresh water, when drought risks are increasing. Clean water precious assets for life. The fracking process involves pumping large quantities of water, chemicals, and sand deep underground. This process produces a huge amount of pressure, which both extracts the natural gas and forces much of the water back to the surface.\n\nSome of the chemicals used in fracking, such as hydrochloric acid, can be very dangerous for the environment. More than 40 different chemicals are used in the process, such as acids, biocides, breakers, stabilizers, corrosion inhibitors, crosslinkers, gelling agents, and surfactants. The major concern with polluted water is that the salts, radium, other heavy metals, and benzene (a carcinogenic and flammable chemical) are forced back up to the surface with the rest of the wastewater. For efficiency, fracking companies want to reuse this wastewater and they subsequently treat the water so that the excess waste does not plug up parts of the well. Consequently, the products that have been removed (radium, and some other heavy metals) are disposed of. However, the water that gets reused still contains salts and benzene. The water is then pumped back underground, endangering aquifers.\n\n2. Proximity to Residential Areas—Fumes and Earthquakes\n\nHydraulic fracturing is a very noisy activity, and it can cause small local earthquakes. In addition to the risk of water contamination for those near fracking sites, wells also produce excess gases, which are either simply released into the air or burned upon their release. These fumes both leave an odor as well as present the possibility of negative health effects for those in proximity to the wells. Such effects include dizziness, confusion, and nasal bleeding. There is also growing evidence to support that fracking can produce minor earthquakes within the vicinity of fracking wells. This may not be as surprising as it sounds considering the amount of pressure, around 8,000 pounds per square inch, that the gas extraction process exerts on shale rock beneath the surface.\n\n3. Property Rights\n\nUsually when someone buys a property, their rights do not extend to the subterranean levels where fracking companies aim to extract natural gas. So, these huge, multinational companies purchase or lease the mineral rights to the land, and gain legal rights to accesses those minerals through drilling as long as they pay damages to the surface owner, which they never really pay in full. Additionally many leases do not require companies to compensate landowners for water contamination. Many American landowners, farmers, and families are pinned down by drilling companies who can legally exercise their rights regardless of what lays on the surface.\n\n4. Lack of Governmental Regulation\n\nThe wastewater that rises to the surface during fracking is treated and then reused. After treatment, the waste that is extracted from the wastewater is thrown in a landfill, because it’s excluded from federal regulations of toxic waste. These laws do not recognize the fact the waste can be extremely dangerous for the environment, as described above. However, regardless of how dangerous these chemicals may be, it is not treated as hazardous waste. If the waste is treated as normal garbage, then these toxic materials may endanger people’s health and the environment’s wellbeing for years to come.\n\nNo, Not The Guy Who Ran For President; This Is Much Better\n\nRitt Momney is the musical project that turned from band to solo act back to band. Originally created my Salt Lake City native, Jack Rutter, the band started when he was a high school student in 2017. Beginning as an indie rock band comprised of high school friends, the project became a personal outlet for Rutter after his bandmates left on Mormon missions and his girlfriend left for college. In his bedroom, he began writing, recording, and producing his upcoming debut LP, entitled “Her and All of My Friends,” in which Rutter grapples with loss, loneliness, and a drift away from Mormon culture. Currently, a live Ritt show features Rutter on vocals/guitar/keys, Jonas Torgersen on guitar, Noah Hamula on bass, Auden Winchester on keys, and (temp) Sam Olson on drums. Aged 17-19, the band keeps busy playing local and regional shows, and working on their new album.\n\nRitt Momney’s most recent, album released in July of 2019, entitled, Her and All My Friends . There are 13 tracks in total on the album; however there is a released EP that includes three songs released in the summer of 2017. The EP, Theater Kid/ Probably, includes -you guessed it-, “Theater Kid”, “Probably”, and a bonus track “Golden Slumbers”. While the band’s usual sound is more on the indie side, there are few songs, one inparticular, that may surprise you. The song that I am, and the people picking music for the HBO series “Ballers”, most interested in is “(If) the Book Doesn’t Sell”. This is by far my most favorite song on the album, but it did not start out this way. Unlike most of their songs, “(if) the Book Doesn’t Sell” is sung with voice modification, which makes it sound like bad autotuned and almost unpleasant to the ear at first. I almost skipped the song entirely until I got to the second verse. The fourteen-year old Jack Rutter explains, from his point of view, an extensive conversation he has with God and the Devil in his kitchen one night. Though the song takes place from his point of view, there is still a lot of description of how both the Devil and, especially, God are feeling. The fictional Rutter gets into a screaming match with God, and is left with the horrible knowledge that there is no longer a heaven or hell, that there will be nothing after death. He must then, at age fourteen, decide how he will live his life; with hopefulness or with the truth.\n\n“(If) the Book Doesn’t Sell” is definitely the best song on the album; however I’ll include a few more that I like for good measure: “Something, in General” and “Young Adult”.\n\nYOU KNOW THEY’RE SONGS, BUT DO YOU KNOW THEIR NAME?\n\nDaughter are an indie folk band from England. Fronted by North London native Elena Tonra (born 15 January 1990), they were formed in 2010 after the addition of Swiss-born guitarist Igor Haefeli and drummer Remi Aguilella from France. They have released four EPs and three albums, and are currently signed to two record labels, one for their North America endeavors, and the other based in Europe. After playing the local London circuit, they toured supporting Ben Howard around Europe and have since played headlining tours around North America, Europe and Australia.\n\nElena Tonra was raised in Northwood, London and, through her Dublin-born grandfather, experienced traditional Irish music from an early age. After being bullied at school she used writing to “deal emotionally with life”. Changing schools at the age of 12 had a great impact and since then Tonra writes “about things I feel difficult talking about in adulthood”. Tonra began her career in music by performing acoustic shows under her own name around London. She found that this “didn’t suit me at all. As a musician, I’m self-taught and felt I was restricted by my abilities”.\n\nHaefeli attended one of the acoustic shows that Tonra was performing and found that “she had this power which drew everyone in”. Originally from Neuchatel, Haefeli also attended London’s Institute of Contemporary Music Performance where he met Tonra during a songwriting course. They began performing together with Haefeli adding electric guitars. After their first demo started word of mouth on the band, Daughter self-released their debut EP, His Young Heart, on 20 April 2011, recorded in Haefeli’s bedsit. Later that same year, they released another EP, The Wild Youth, on 2 October through artist-led Communion Records. The latter EP earned praise from British website For Folk’s Sake who described Daughter as “one of the unique sounds in the pop landscape today.”\n\nTonra and Haefeli became romantically involved and the guitarist insisted that they “keep our couple life and our band life separate,” as Haaefeli didn’t want to bar Tonra from saying things in her songs that were personal. While Tonra agreed with Haefeli they later ended their relationship before the release of their album If You Leave in 2013.\n\nIn 2012, shortly after headlining a 700-capacity show in London, Daughter announced their signing to UK label 4AD. Their first proper single, “Smother”, was released in October of that year. It was playlisted by both BBC Radio 1 and 6Music, while being awarded Single of the Week by long-time supporter Huw Stephens. In December 2012 the band appeared on the David Letterman Show prior to the release of the record, which Tonra described as “perhaps (…) a cart-before-the-horse situation”.\n\nThough you may not have known their name there is a good chance you’ve heard their music. Daughter has been played on many popular tv shows, such as: Grey’s Anatomy, Vampire Diaries, Teen Wolf, and The Gifted. My personal favorites are, unoriginally, some of the more popular songs, but hey what works works. These favorites include Medicine, Smother, and Youth.\n\n“On Wednesday’s We Wear Pink”\n\nDavid Bowden, known professionally as Pink Sweat$, was born February 14,1992 and is an American singer and songwriter. Pink Sweats didn’t grow up with a lot of musical influence until he was 17 years old, but admired artists like Michael Jackson, Prince, and Kanye West. He became a musical artist after surviving a three-year battle with Achalasia. Achalasia refers to the failure for smooth muscles fibers to relax causing difficulty for food and liquid to pass through the food pipe into the stomach.\n\nHis stage name was adopted as he always wore pink sweatpants and was given the nickname “Pink Sweats”. He first started making music at the age of 19 as a demo vocalist at Sound Stigma Studios, where he discovered his love for songwriting and began to develop his career in music. He produced in different genres of music for rapper Tierra Whack and country duo Florida Georgia Line. On July 12, 2018, he released his first single “Honesty”, which later started to gain attention on streaming platforms, reaching #10 on Spotify‘s US Viral Chart. I know what you’re thinking; “Yeah he sounds cool, but I definetley haven’t heard his songs before.” That’s what I thought when I was listening to some of his less popular songs, then I hit “Honesty.” Seriously this song is on a bunch of social media platforms used for edits or cheesy couple stuff, you’ve definetley heard it. He released the second single “No Replacing You” on July 26 and his debut EP Volume 1 was released on November 2, 2018, as the singer put out a music video for “Drama” later that month. He later followed this release with the sequel EP Volume 2.\n\nI know I didn’t list it in my description of the artist above but my MOST favorite song of his is “Cocaine.” It has a very Khalid vibe to it, while keeping an originality. The harmonies are almost ominous, then you listen to the lyrics and it all comes together. It can be a good cry song or something to play when you’re lying down with your friends in bed to vibe with.\n\nPOEM OF THE WEEK\n\nMixing it up with some rhyme schemes and varying themes\n\nPink is My Colour\n\nBy: Lovina Chidi\n\nPink pants and rosy plants\n\nPink blouses, never failing to arouse spouses\n\nPink hot feverish lips\n\nPassionate pants of pink\n\nLove letters dipped in pink ink\n\nYou see!
