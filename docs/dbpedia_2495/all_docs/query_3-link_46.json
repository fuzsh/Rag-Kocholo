        "text": "Who inspired Billy Joel to write 'Uptown Girl'?\n\nSpeaking to radio DJ Howard Stern, Billy Joel revealed that he originally titled the song 'Uptown Girls', and it was created at a time when he found himself surrounded by Christie Brinkley, Whitney Houston and his then-girlfriend Elle Macpherson.\n\nThe song was initially written about his relationship with model Macpherson, but it ended up also being about his soon-to-be wife, Brinkley.\n\nRead more: Billy Joel's greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nBoth women were two of the most famous supermodels of the 1980s.\n\nHe later said: \"The fact that I can attract such a beautiful woman as Christie should give hope to every ugly guy in the world!\"\n\nBilly has also said that the song was inspired by the music style of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.\n\nChristie Brinkley appeared in the music video\n\nBilly Joel - Uptown Girl (Official Video)\n\nThe song's video shows Billy and his backup singers working as car mechanics.\n\nChristie arrives in a chauffeured Rolls-Royce, as Billy and his mates dance around her.\n\nA poster of Brinkley can also be seen in the garage, as well as on a billboard above the garage advertising 'Uptown cosmetics'.\n\nBy the end of the video, Billy and Christie ride off on a motorcycle.\n\nAre Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley still together?\n\nIn a word, no.\n\nThe couple got married in 1985. They first met in 1983 on the Island of St Barts, in the Caribbean, and were married on a yacht on the Hudson River, the second marriage for both of them.\n\nGuests at the wedding included singer Paul Simon and members of the band Stray Cats.\n\nHowever, the marriage ended in August 1994.\n\nThey had one child together: Alexa Ray Joel, born December 29, 1985.\n\nThe couple have remained good friends over the years while raising Alexa.\n\nHow did it perform in the charts?\n\nIt was a number three record in the US, and reached number one in the UK, his only number one in the country.\n\nIt was the second biggest-selling single of 1983 in the UK, and was the 19th biggest-selling single of the 1980s, selling 975,000 copies. It had sold over 1.06 million copies by 2017.\n\nWestlife also scored a number one with a cover\n\nWestlife - Uptown Girl (Official Video)\n\nOf the many cover versions, boyband Westlife's is the most famous.\n\nIn the UK, the song was recorded as 2001's Comic Relief single, reaching number one and becoming the group's best-selling single to date.\n\nRead more: Westlife's 10 best songs ever, ranked\n\nIts music video also parodied the Billy Joel video, showing the boys trying to impress model Claudia Schiffer.\n\nDid Princess Diana really dance ballet to 'Uptown Girl'?\n\nDancing with Diana: Princess wowed audience in surprise appearance\n\nA scene in the penultimate episode of season four of The Crown shows Princess Diana (played by Emma Corrin) surprising her husband Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor), with a dance sequence set to 'Uptown Girl' at the Royal Opera House.\n\nThis did actually happen!\n\nIn December 1985 at a VIP event held at London’s Royal Opera House, the event occurred at the annual Friends of Covent Garden.\n\nAs a surprise for her husband, Diana appeared on stage with dancer Wayne Sleep.\n\nSleep later said of the moment: “I said to Princess Diana – this will never work, Ma’am. You’re so much taller than me.”\n\nThe pair danced a short dance routine to Billy Joel’s classic hit, to huge applause from the lucky audience.\n\nYears later, Sleep wrote in The Guardian: “She loved the freedom dancing gave her. A few days later, I got a letter. She wrote: ‘Now I understand the buzz you get from performing.’”"
