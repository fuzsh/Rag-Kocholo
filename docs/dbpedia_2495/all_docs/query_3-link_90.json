        "text": "South African athlete Oscar Pistorius was released from prison on parole on Friday after serving nearly nine years for the shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine's Day in 2013.\n\nPistorius, once hailed an inspiration as a double-amputee Olympic runner competing against able-bodied athletes, was serving a 13-year sentence at Atteridgeville Correctional Center in the South African capital of Pretoria.\n\nLittle details surrounding his release were available, but the announcement from the country's Department of Corrections came at around 8:30 a.m. local time, according to The Associated Press.\n\nPistorius was convicted of murder in 2015 and sentenced to 13 years and five months in prison. In South Africa, serious offenders are eligible for parole after serving at least half of their sentence.\n\nOSCAR 'BLADE RUNNER' PISTORIUS WARNED HE COULD BECOME ASSASSINATION TARGET FROM COUNTRY'S UNDERWORLD\n\nPistorius was granted parole on Nov. 24 under various conditions, including that he not leave the area of Pretoria, the Department of Corrections said at the time. He is set to live at his uncle's mansion in the upscale suburb of Waterkloof, according to the AP.\n\nHe will also be required to attend a program to deal with his anger issues and will have to perform community service. His parole conditions will be in place for five years.\n\nBLADE RUNNER OSCAR PISTORIUS: A LOOK BACK AT THE OLYMPIAN'S METEORIC RISE AND FALL\n\nPistorius testified at his murder trial that he killed Steenkamp, 29, by mistake, thinking she was a dangerous intruder hiding in his bathroom in the middle of the night when he fired four times through the door with his licensed 9mm pistol.\n\nProsecutors argued that Pistorius killed her in a rage after she had fled to the toilet cubicle during a late-night argument.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPistorius was initially convicted of culpable homicide, which is comparable to manslaughter, in her death. That conviction was overturned and he was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors.\n\nThey also appealed against an initial sentence of six years for murder, and Pistorius was ultimately sentenced to 13 years and five months in prison.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the South Africa Department of Corrections, but did not hear back by time of publication."
