        "text": "Our favorite girl squad is returning to television after 11 years of sadly leaving our TV screens. The cast of Girlfriends, Tracee Ellis Ross, Golden Brooks, Persia White, and Jill Marie Jones, will reunite for an October 8 episode of ABC’s black-ish where Ross currently stars. The four actresses portrayed Joan, Maya, Lynn and Toni, four friends living, working and dating in Los Angeles. The black-ish episode, titled “Feminisn’t,” follows Ross’ Bow as she introduces her onscreen daughter, Diane (Marsai Martin), and her mother-in-law Ruby (ESSENCE’s Black Women in Hollywood honoree Jenifer Lewis) to her feminist group after the two reveal they don’t believe in feminism. “Being able to merge the worlds of black-ish and Girlfriends was surreal for me—and so much fun,” ESSENCE’s October cover star told Entertainment Weekly of the reunion. “These are women I grew up with and love deeply and it was easy to tap back into the magic of our chemistry and how much we love each other. It was giggles on top of giggles on top of giggles.” When the show landed on small screens back in 2000, Black women everywhere tuned in to choose which of the main characters was most relatable to their lives. Pulled from the expansive mind of writer Mara Brock Akil, during its eight year run, Girlfriends went on to become an iconic show that served as proof that we are truly magic. Find out what the cast members have been up to since leaving our living rooms.\n\n05\n\nKeesha Sharp\n\nLanding the role of Monica Brooks on the show in 2002, Keesha Sharp moved from outcast to a member of the crew while playing William’s wife. Since Girlfriends wrapped in 2008, Sharp has acted in many films, including Why Did I Get Married?. Since 2016, she has starred alongside Damon Wayans in the Fox series, Lethal Weapon and starred in Chadwick Boseman’s Marshall. She and her husband, Bradford Sharp, have been married for more than 20 years, and are working on a biopic of Earth Kitt together.\n\n06\n\nReggie Hayes\n\nAfter his role as the dry humored, mama’s boy William Dent (don’t forget the Esquire), Reggie Hayes — much like his on-screen gal pals — has continued to appear in many acting roles over the years. To date, Hayes has appeared in roles on shows for Criminal Minds, Let’s Stay Together, Hart of Dixie, NCIS and more.\n\n07\n\nKhalil Kain\n\nPlaying the role of Maya’s husband Darnell after Flex Alexander’s season one departure, Khalil Kain grew to become a relatable and realistic depiction of Black men. Since the Girlfriends season finale, Kain continued to act. He was seen in the 2010 film, For Colored Girls and is noted as having roles in shows like Blue Bloods, Person of Interest and Elementary. In addition, he is credited for roles in the movies Misguided Behavior and The Fearless One."
