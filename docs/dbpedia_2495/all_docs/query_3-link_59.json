        "text": "\"To realize that I was the victim of what was apparently someone's sick joke and constant lies was, and is, painful and humiliating.\n\n\"It further pains me that the grief I felt and the sympathies expressed to me at the time of my grandmother's death in September were in any way deepened by what I believed to be another significant loss in my life. I am enormously grateful for the support of my family, friends and Notre Dame fans throughout this year. To think that I shared with them my happiness about my relationship and details that I thought to be true about her just makes me sick. I hope that people can understand how trying and confusing this whole experience has been. In retrospect, I obviously should have been much more cautious. If anything good comes of this, I hope it is that others will be far more guarded when they engage with people online than I was.\n\n\"Fortunately, I have many wonderful things in my life, and I'm looking forward to putting this painful experience behind me as I focus on preparing for the NFL Draft.\"\n\nTe'o was a Heisman Trophy finalist, finishing second in the voting, and led Notre Dame to its first appearance in the BCS championship.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN for \"College GameDay\" on Oct. 2, Te'o said Kekua's last words to him were \"I love you.\" He also said that she was \"the most beautiful girl I've ever met.\"\n\nSwarbrick said Te'o never met Kekua in person.\n\n\"What I will tell you, this was exclusively an online relationship,\" he said.\n\nHe said that he would leave it to Te'o to explain how his father Brian Te'o came to say that his son and Kekua met in person a number of times.\n\nThe South Bend Tribune reported that on Oct. 10 during a taped interview with Brian Te'o and Manti Te'o's mother Ottillia, the father said that his son and Kekua met in person after a Notre Dame-Stanford game in 2009 in Palo Alto, Calif.\n\n\"They started out as just friends,\" Brian Teo said, according to the newspaper. \"Every once in a while, she would travel to Hawaii, and that happened to be the time Manti was home, so he would meet with her there. But within the last year, they became a couple.\n\n\"And we came to the realization that she could be our daughter-in-law. Sadly, it won't happen now.\"\n\nReagan Mauia, an Arizona Cardinals fullback, said he believes Kekua existed because he met her in person when he and other Polynesian teammates and Pittsburgh Steelers star Troy Polamalu went to do charity work in American Samoa in June 2011.\n\n\"This was before her and Manti,\" Mauia said Wednesday evening. \"I don't think Manti was even in the picture, but she and I became good friends. We would talk off and on, just checking up on each other kind of thing. I am close to her family. When she was going through the loss of her father, I was -- I offered a comforting shoulder and just someone to bounce her emotions off. That was just from meeting her in Samoa.\"\n\nMauia said Tuiasosopo -- whom Mauia believes is Kekua's cousin -- introduced the two. After the initial meeting, Mauia said he met her at an \"after-party\" for all of the athletes involved in the camp.\n\n\"She was tall,\" he said. \"Volleyball-type of physique. She was athletic, tall, beautiful. Long hair. Polynesian. She looked like a model ... \"\n\nAnother former NFL player on the trip to American Samoa told ESPN.com Thursday that he has no recollection of meeting Kekua.\n\nWhen reached by ESPN.com on Wednesday night, former University of Washington and NFL quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo acknowledged that he is a cousin of Ronaiah Tuiasosopo but said he never had met or heard of Kekua.\n\nMauia said it is his understanding that Kekua's mother is operating her Twitter account. He said he'd never met her mother. When told by a reporter that she apparently might not have existed, Mauia said: \"No, she is real.\"\n\nTe'o is training in preparation for the NFL draft at the IMG Institute in Bradenton, Fla. He is No. 8 on Mel Kiper's latest draft board.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press, ESPN.com's Gene Wojciechowski, Matt Fortuna, Ted Miller and Mike Fish was included in this report."
