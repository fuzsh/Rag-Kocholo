It was releaed on March 12, 2002. The album reached #2 at on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart.\n\nBand info\n\nEpic Records definitely did its homework before unleashing B2K into the pop market. The boy band of clean cut and suave young black men is everything a marketing department dreams about and attractive teens becoming men who make the girls melt with a little bit of a rugged, tough guy attitude and flashy clothes. Of course, there are also the dance beats that are as much dance-pop as hip-hop. In fact, you might even wager a bet that the many producers and songwriters on this album had been listening to a bit of Craig David and other British 2-step pop stars. Plus, the group members are capable singers as well, which is another bonus. Overall, with the girl-magnet looks, the trendy radio-ready production, and the limitless vocal hooks, Epic Records has all the makings of pop stardom in B2K, including a market-testing hit single in \"Uh Huh\" that set the stage for the group's debut album.\n\nAlbum performance\n\nB2K, a self-titled album, gets off to a good start, jumping right into some of its best songs, \"Gots ta Be\", \"Understanding,\" and \"Why I Love You\". It also reached #2 at on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart. Before unleashing the album highlight, the aforementioned \"Uh Huh\". From there, the album gets progressively long-winded, running through 17 songs in total.\n\nTrack listing\n\n# \"Gots Ta Be\" &ndash; 5:21\n\n# \"Understanding\" &ndash; 3:52\n\n# \"Why I Love You\" &ndash; 4:00\n\n# \"Uh Huh\" &ndash; 3:43\n\n# \"B2K Is Hot (Skit)\" &ndash; 0:35\n\n# \"B2K Is Hot\" &ndash; 3:39\n\n# \"Fantasy\" &ndash; 3:44\n\n# \"I'm Not Finished\" &ndash; 4:26\n\n# \"Come On\" &ndash; 4:05\n\n# \"Hey Little Lady (Interlude)\" &ndash; 0:28\n\n# \"Hey Little Lady\" &ndash; 3:52\n\n# \"Baby Girl\" &ndash; 4:50\n\n# \"Your Girl Chose Me\" &ndash; 2:53\n\n# \"Shorty\" &ndash; 3:22\n\n# \"Feel This Way\" &ndash; 3:53\n\n# \"Last Boyfriend\" &ndash; 3:27\n\n# \"Here We Go Again\" &ndash; 4:07\n\ningles\n\n*\"Uh Huh\"Released: December 2001\n\n*\"Gots Ta Be\"Released: February 2002\n\n*\"Why I Love You\"Released: May 2002\n\nAlbum charts"
