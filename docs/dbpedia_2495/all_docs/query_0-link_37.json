He rose to prominence as the lead singer of the boy band B2K. The group achieved success in the early 2000s with their singles \"Gots ta Be\", \"Uh Huh\", \"Girlfriend\", and the number-one hit \"Bump, Bump, Bump\" (featuring P. Diddy).\n\nAfter the group disbanded in 2004, Omarion embarked on a solo career with the release of his debut studio album O (2005), which debuted atop the Billboard 200. The album, gaining success from its title track, received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album. The same year, he guest featured on Bow Wow's single \"Let Me Hold You\", which peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nHis second solo album, 21 (2006) became his second consecutive number one album and spawned the hit single \"Ice Box\", which peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100—remaining his highest-charting single to date.
