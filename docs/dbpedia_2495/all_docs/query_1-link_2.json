Written and produced by L.A. Reid and Babyface, \"Girlfriend\" was released as the album's lead single on October 26, 1987, by record label MCA. The song charted in several countries, peaking at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reaching the top 10 in Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song was originally intended for Vanessa Williams' debut album The Right Stuff.[1] According to L.A. Reid, Williams' record label Wing showed interest in Williams' recording \"Girlfriend\", which Reid played for her alone in his apartment. However, Pebbles heard the song and offered Reid more money and two cars for the chance to record it.[2] As a result, the production team were not asked to work on more songs on Williams' debut. Reid said due to that incident, Williams never spoke to him again.[3]\n\nChart performance\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Girlfriend\" became Pebbles' first top-five hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and her first number one song on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[4] The single also peaked at number eight in the United Kingdom and at number nine in Ireland, becoming Pebbles' only top-10 hit in both countries, reached the top 20 in Switzerland, Canada, and West Germany, and was a Top 40 hit in New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Belgium.\n\nAwards and accolades\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Girlfriend\" earned Pebbles her first nomination for the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 1989 Grammy Awards, losing to \"Giving You the Best That I Got\" by Anita Baker.[5]\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Date Format(s) Label(s) Ref.
