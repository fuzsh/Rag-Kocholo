Aiko embarked on her musical career in 2002, as a backing vocalist and music video performer for the R&B group B2K. She was signed by their record label, The Ultimate Group that same year and was marketed as the \"cousin\" of B2K member Lil' Fizz to cultivate her own following,[5][6] although they are not related.[7][8] Her debut album, slated for a 2003 release through the label with Epic Records, was shelved due to Aiko instead further pursuing her education.[9]\n\nIn March 2011, Aiko made her return to music with the release of her first full-length project, a mixtape titled Sailing Soul(s). In December of that year, she signed a recording contract with producer No I.D.'s record label ARTium Recordings, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings.[10] Her mainstream breakthrough followed thereafter, as she co-performed alongside Lil Wayne on Big Sean's 2013 single \"Beware\", which became her first top 40 single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In November of that year, she released her debut extended play (EP) Sail Out, which spawned the singles \"3:16AM\", \"Bed Peace\" (featuring Childish Gambino) and \"The Worst\"—the latter received quintuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nAiko released her debut studio album, Souled Out (2014) to critical and commercial success.[11] Her second and third albums, Trip (2017)[12] and Chilombo (2020), were met with continued success; the latter peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and earned Aiko three Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nJhené Aiko Efuru Chilombo was born on March 16, 1988, in Los Angeles, California. Her family lived in South Los Angeles, but their home burned down when she was seven and they moved near Slauson Avenue around View Park–Windsor Hills, Baldwin Hills, and Ladera Heights where she was homeschooled until high school. She calls her home neighborhood \"Slauson Hills\".[13][14][15] Aiko is the daughter of Christina Yamamoto and pediatrician Karamo Chilombo (born Gregory Wycliff Barnes). Her parents are divorced.[16] Aiko has seven siblings, four from both her mother and father's side and three half-siblings from her father's side. Her older sister is R&B singer Mila J.[17][18] Her mother is of Spanish, Dominican, and Japanese descent, and her father is of Native American, African-American, and German-Jewish descent.[19] Her maternal grandfather was of Japanese descent and her maternal grandmother is of Dominican heritage.[20][21] She took vocal lessons in Culver City, but quit when she unexpectedly became pregnant.[22]\n\nAiko addressed her mixed heritage during a Twitter conversation: \"I am less black than someone half black, but also less white [than] someone half white… and asian is the least thing i am,\" she said \"So at this point, it’s whatever they want me to be. I have a Japanese grandfather and a Creole/Dominican grandmother on my mothers side and both of my fathers parents are black and white. my dna results came in 25% Asian, 33% African and 34% European. So that is what i was referencing in the tweet. also, those dna sites update and change from time to time so who actually knows. Ok now im done explaining, promise i am human and i see you all as family regardless of how u view me.\"[21]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n2002–2006: Career beginnings and hiatus\n\n[edit]\n\nAiko embarked on her musical career contributing vocals to several B2K releases, as well as a song on The Master of Disguise soundtrack in 2002, while signed to The Ultimate Group and managed by Chris Stokes.[23][24] During this time she was known as the cousin of B2K's rapper, Lil' Fizz, though she is not actually related to him.[7][8] It was used as a marketing tool, suggested by her labels Sony, The Ultimate Group and Epic Records, to promote Aiko through B2K and attract an audience; nonetheless Aiko affirms that she and Lil' Fizz grew up together and were close like family.[5] She featured on tracks five through eight of the R&B group's remix album B2K: The Remixes – Volume 1.[25] \"Santa Baby\", a cover she recorded, was also featured on their album Santa Hooked Me Up and she appeared as a guest vocalist on the song \"Tease\" from Pandemonium!.[26][27] Her song \"Dog\"[27] appeared as a bonus track.[citation needed]\n\nAiko also appeared in numerous music videos including O'Ryan's debut video, \"Take It Slow\",[28] B2K's debut video \"Uh Huh\"[29] and \"Why I Love You\",[30] P.Y.T.'s \"Same Ol' Same Ol' (Remix)\"[31] featuring Sarai, Play's \"M.A.S.T.E.R.

Aiko was set to release her debut album, then-titled My Name Is Jhené in 2003 through Sony, The Ultimate Group, Epic; however, the album was never released due to tension at the record label Epic, which ultimately led to Aiko asking to be released from the label.[39] Aiko later left the aforementioned labels in order to continue her education.[6]\n\n2007–2011: Return to music and Sail Out\n\n[edit]\n\n.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}@media print{body.ns-0 .mw-parser-output .hatnote{display:none!important}}\n\nMain articles: Sailing Soul(s) and Sail Out\n\nIn 2007, she made a return to music, in an interview she spoke on the choice saying \"Shortly before I conceived my daughter, I stepped back into the field and took a meeting with a label head.

Aiko reveals several lyrical verses in her book that can be found in her album Trip which was released the same year as the publication of 2Fish.[125] During the recording of the album Aiko opted to freestyle when writing the album, she would have a beat or would sit with producers and she would sing a melody until she had words, she described the process as not having a lot written down saying \"there's not a lot of writing down—I'll only write it down to make sure it makes sense after I come up with it. For the most part, I like to not have second thoughts.\"[126] Aiko revealed that whilst writing music she enjoys being high in order to use the feeling as inspiration and that for the entire writing and recording process of her debut mixtape Sailing Soul(s), she was under the influence of cannabis. When writing for her debut studio album, she did the same but recorded while sober.[127] Aiko places great importance on writing her music, believing it defines her as an artist: \"After each song I've lost like a piece of me, because I've put it in to (sic) the song.\"[127] Singer Nick Jonas cited Aiko as an influence during the recording of his debut album, noting her alternative R&B sound as his influence.[128]\n\nInfluences\n\n[edit]\n\nAiko cites American rapper Tupac as a major influence, saying he is \"a big inspiration for me just to stick to who I am and to actually stand for something through music\" and \"an icon for speaking your mind and being you, even if it's controversial.\"[129][130] Aiko also cites R&B singer Aaliyah as well as rappers Eminem and Kendrick Lamar as influences.[131][129] Aiko also calls recording artist Kid Cudi, a major influence, stating Cudi is \"pretty much one of the only people that I listen to consistently. No matter what he puts out, I'm one of those fans. He can do no wrong in my eyes.\"[129]\n\nAiko also credits Brandy as a major influence, saying, \"I always say the person who taught me how to sing indirectly because I listened to her all the time was Brandy. I fell in love with her voice when I was six years old. I always loved Brandy.\" Aiko also listens to Beyoncé to learn from her vocal technique and is also influenced by India.Arie and Amel Larrieux.
