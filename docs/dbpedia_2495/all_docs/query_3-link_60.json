        "text": "Have you ever noticed that Leonardo DiCaprio hasn't publicly dated a woman aged over 25?\n\nIt’s become somewhat of an internet joke with netizens laughing that DiCaprio always breaks up with his partners before their 25th birthday.\n\nAnd this week, DiCaprio's dating life is going viral once again.\n\nThe actor has been linked to 19-year-old model Eden Polani after the pair were spotted at an EP release party for Ebony Riley.\n\nPolani, 19, and DiCaprio, 48, have an age difference of 29 years.\n\nWhile their relationship is just pure speculation at the moment, social media users have started pointing out their stark age gap.\n\nFor example, the age gap between Polani and DiCaprio means that she was born seven years AFTER Titanic was released.\n\nIf that doesn’t give you shivers, how about this one?\n\nThe age difference between Polani and DiCaprio is the exact same as Pedro Pascal and fellow The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey. Yep, you read that right.\n\nAmid the news, we decided to take a look back at the age gaps in DiCaprio's past relationships.\n\nGisele Bundchen: 1999 - 2004.\n\nBrazilian model Gisele Bundchen was freshly 18 when she began dating a 25-year-old DiCaprio.\n\nA seven-year age gap isn’t anything noteworthy, however The Things reported Bundchen had something to say about it after she ended things five years later at 23.\n\n\"I was becoming more and more aware of things that I’d chosen not to look at,\" the publication reported.\n\n\"Was I alone in wanting to do some serious soul-searching while he stayed the same? In the end, unfortunately, the answer was yes.\"\n\nBar Refaeli: 2005 - 2010.\n\nDiCaprio began a relationship with Israeli model Bar Refaeli a year later in 2005 when she was only 20 years old. At the time, DiCaprio was 31.\n\nBlake Lively: 2011.\n\nDiCaprio dated Blake Lively (Gossip Girl) for a few months in 2011 when she was only 23 and he was 36.\n\nThe relationship didn’t last very long, and she went on to meet and marry her current husband and father of three children, Ryan Reynolds.\n\nErin Heatherton: 2012.\n\nErin Heatherton has nothing but nice things to say about her time dating the actor in 2012, when she was just 22 and he was 38.\n\nAccording to The Things, she shared: \"He's a wonderful person, and he's a friend of mine, I wish him all the best. I've never had a boyfriend I've been more comfortable with and more at one with now.\"\n\nToni Garrn: 2013 - 2014.\n\nToni Garrn dated DiCaprio in May 2013 when she was 21 years old. The German model broke it off by December 2014 allegedly because she was sick of his partying, which is a feat in itself considering the actor was about to hit 40 years old. According to The Sun, the pair were spotted together again in 2017. Garrn was still only 25 at the time, but nothing came of it.\n\nKelly Rohrbach: 2015.\n\nSports Illustrated model Rohrbach dated DiCaprio for roughly half a year in 2015 when she was 25 years old and he was 41.\n\nThe pair called the split mutual and Rohrbach went on to score a role in the Baywatch reboot in 2017.\n\nBefore you go on, watch the trailer for the Titanic here to grasp how long ago that film was released. Post continues below.\n\nVideo via 20th Century Studios.\n\nNina Agdal: 2016 - 2017.\n\nDanish swim model Nina Agdal spent a year with DiCaprio frolicking on beaches and yachts all around the world.\n\nEventually their relationship ran its course, suspiciously around the time that Agdal turned 25 years old in 2017. (At the time, DiCaprio was 43.)\n\nCamila Morrone: 2017 - 2022.\n\nMorrone broke DiCaprio's short relationship spell and dated him for four years from 2017. At the time, she was just 19 years old, and he was 43 years old.\n\nThe model told the Los Angeles Times, \"I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date,\" when her 23-year age difference with DiCaprio was brought up.\n\nThe public thought Morrone might finally be the one, especially when their relationship lasted through COVID.\n\nHowever, just two months after Morrone turned 25, the pair broke up. At the time, DiCaprio was 48.\n\nGigi Hadid: 2022.\n\nHadid and DiCaprio’s relationship didn’t feel like anything more than a press junket.\n\nIt felt like the pair were constantly papped for a short amount of time to make headlines.\n\nThey were seen hanging out all over New York in September 2022, but the 'relationship' fizzled by December 2022.\n\nHadid is the only woman DiCaprio has 'dated' that was over the age of 25, which is another reason to think it wasn't real.\n\nVictoria Lamas: 2022.\n\nDiCaprio was immediately linked to Victoria Lamas just weeks after Hadid.\n\nLamas is the daughter of actor Lorenzo Lamas (Grease).\n\nDiCaprio, 48, was actually closer to Lorenzo’s age, 65, than Victoria’s age, 23, when they began dating in December 2022.\n\nFeature Image: Getty and Instagram @edenpolanii.\n\nLove watching TV and movies?
