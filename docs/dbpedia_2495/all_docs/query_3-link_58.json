        "text": "The five-piece alt-rock band girlfriend. having released their debut album, today on Halloween 2023.\n\nThe album To Be Quiet was preceded by with excellent singles like the shoegaze-influenced ‘In Silence’, along with ‘Trust’ and ‘Repent’.\n\nThe 14-track record is out now, and available on Bandcamp with a double 12″ gatefold package available.\n\nThe band said:\n\nTBQ has been 8 years in the making, and we put our blood, sweat and tears into making it.\n\nIt has survived through broken bones, unemployment, dead end jobs, a global pandemic, illness, heartbreak, crises, an illegal eviction and so many other adverse factors that felt insurmountable at times.\n\nTo Be Quiet is an exorcism of these things that haunt us. Of the pain that comes with being alive now. Above all else, it is a celebration of our friendship and being able to turn pain into something beautiful with your mates.\n\nListen to the album here. It’s also on streaming services.\n\nTo Be Quiet by girlfriend."
