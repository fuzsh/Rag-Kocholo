        "text": "If a human being were to be the direct personification of the word “duality,” it would most certainly be Stephen Bruner, aka Thundercat. From harmonizing over soulful instrumentation about wishing he could be a cat, to gripping with loss of a friend, to aging and socioeconomic disadvantage, Thundercat’s juxtaposition of painfully human emotions and scenarios can truly make you laugh and cry all at once. But his fourth studio album It Is What It Is is perhaps Bruner’s greatest display of his artistic versatility.\n\nBuilding off of the genre-melding sounds established by his 2017 project Drunk, Thundercats signature velvety melodies and funky production allow him to really come into his own sonically on this album. While Thundercat seems to pin down his soundscape on this LP, It Is What It Is is far from predictable. Alternating between toned down, nearly lofi production (“Lost in Space / Great Scott / 22-26”) and upbeat, jazzy tracks, (“Black Qualls,” “Dragonball Durag”) the project ticks all the boxes of a typical Thundercat release without sounding musically complacent. With help from friend and co-producer Flying Lotus, Thundercat takes considerably more sonic risks on It Is What It Is, allowing the album to be far more experimental than prior projects. But each risk pay off, creating standouts like “Innerstellar Love” and “Existential Dread.” The result is a cacophonic ride through Thundercats various emotional states, pushed along with inherently intriguing instrumentation and production.\n\nMood and sound are ever changing on It Is What It Is, as Thundercat attempts to come to terms with the death of his close friend Mac Miller. The title itself is a reflection of the lessons learned from the Pittsburgh musicians passing, “It’s just part of it, part of the story,” said Bruner in an interview with Apple Music. “That’s why the name of the album is what it is -- [Mac’s death] made me put my life in perspective. I’m happy I’m still here.” His happiness is reflected through his utilization of humor throughout the record, as it extenuates his grieving. No matter how good, bad, happy or sad the situation, Bruner always seems to find room for comedy. His lighthearted approach to misfortune saves the project from focusing too hard on philosophical reflection of the morality and fragility of life, something Thundercat is far too hilarious for. Instead, It Is What It Is exists somewhere else; somewhere between grieving and happiness, laughter and tears, the meaningful and the meaningless, life and death. Duality takes center stage in It Is What It Is, as Bruner must begrudgingly accept the highs and the lows of life because, quite simply put, it is what it is.\n\nIn addition to humor, good company seems to uplift Thundercat during the rough patches in life, and they also happen to make this guest list on this record star-studded. Steve Lacy, Louis Cole, Pedro Martins and Flying Lotus add to the already soulful aesthetics of a Thundercat record, while Ty Dolla $ign and Childish Gambino put in valuable vocal performances on notable cuts “Black Qualls” and “Fair Chance.” The tracklist is full of melodic, atmospheric songs that inspire a wealth of emotions. From floating through space on “Lost in Space / Great Scott / 22-26” to being thrust into the saturated uptempo “Innerstellar Love,” the album is a bumpy, yet endearing musical ride. The funky guitar gracing “Black Qualls” make for a truly soulful track, with a valuable and thought-provoking emphasis on black education and confidence. “Fair Chance” is spacey, glossy, beautiful goodbye to Mac from two of his closest friends (Cat and Ty Dolla $ign). “Dragonball Durag” is hilariously catchy and provides an exuberant counterpart to Bruners introspection. But the crown jewel of the tracklist comes last, in It Is What It Is’ title track, as Thundercat succumbs to his pure devastation in the wake of the death of Mac Miller. “My best just wasn’t enough/ It couldn’t be helped, the end/ The things I would do for you/ So many things I wanna say/ This is the end,” sings Thundercat over a melancholy guitar solo. The song acts as Bruners final goodbyes to Mac, as he grips with the apex of guilt, pain and mourning he’s felt in the two years following Miller’s death. The unbridled despair in Thundercats voice is raw, endearing and heartbreaking. Combined with the intimate, somber production, “It Is What It Is” is a tear-jerking, brilliant memorial to Miller. About halfway through, the track fades and is followed by Thundercat and Pedro Martins trading bass solos. Interweaving with Martins, Thundercat spends the closing moments of It Is What It Is playing the same instrument that sparked his friendship with Miller, which clearly blossomed into something incredibly dear to Bruner.\n\nIt Is What It Isis, through and through, a fantastic record. Its irresistibly funky, genre-fusing instrumentation combined with its playful, yet devastating subject matter make for a truly intriguing project.\n\nFavorite Songs\n\nLost in Space / Great Scott / 22-26\n\nBlack Qualls (feat.

At age 12, Jhené signed her first record deal with Epic Records; laying down vocals on several B2K tracks in the early 2000s. 12-year-old Aiko even opened for the boy band’s tour “Scream Tour 3” in 2003. When Aiko was 15, she asked to be released from Epic Records due to conflicts of interest regarding who she was as an artist. In 2008 at the age of 20, Jhené and O’ryan Browner’s (brother of former B2K singer, Omarion) daughter Namiko Love Browner was born.\n\nFast forward to March 16th, 2011, after an 8-year hiatus Jhené made her return to the music business. Jhené released her debut mixtape, Sailing Soul(s) via her website jheneaiko.com, with features from artists such as Kanye West, Drake, and Miguel. In 2012 Aiko signed a deal with legendary producer No I.D. 's record label, Artium Records, (Def Jam affiliate) to prepare for the release of her debut album. November 12th, 2013, Aiko released her debut EP Sail Out. Featured on the album were popular artists Kendrick Lamar, Vince Staples, Childish Gambino, and Ab-soul. Aiko has since gone on to release TWENTY 88 which is a collaboration album with rapper and boyfriend Big Sean, her second studio album Trip, and now CHILOMBO.\n\nIn May of 2019, it seemed as if Jhené was back in album mode. Jhené released “Triggered (freestyle)” which was a breakup song aimed towards rapper Big Sean. The song itself triggered the release of four more singles over the next year: “Trigger Protection Mantra”, “None Of Your Concern” featuring Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign, “P*$$Y Fairy”, and “Happiness Over Everything” featuring Miguel & Future.\n\nOn February 21, 2020, Aiko went to Instagram to announce that CHILOMBO would release on March 6th. Later that week Aiko described her then-upcoming third studio album as a celebration of her coming into her own personal power.\n\nCHILOMBO was released on March 6, 2020, through Def Jam. The album boasts 20 songs and has an 01:03:34 timestamp on it. The album features some old faces we’re used to seeing on Jhené’s albums, as well as some new ones. Big Sean, H.E.R., Future, Miguel, Ab-Soul, Dr. Chill, Nas, John Legend, and Ty Dolla $ign all feature on the project.\n\n“Triggered (freestyle)” and “None Of Your Concern” featuring Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign are tracks two and three on CHILOMBO. With these songs being back to back, they immediately give listeners a perspective on her and Sean’s relationship. Rather than bottling up her emotions, Jhené went to the studio to express her irritation through a freestyle. Jhené doesn’t leave any room for confusion on this track. Instead of sending subtle shots, all of her bars are direct. The singer even went on the Rap Genius website to provide verified commentary on the song. On “None Of Your Concern”, Jhené and Big Sean are dealing with the aftershock of their relationship. Although the two artists do tell each other how they felt during the downfall of their relationship; much of the song focuses on how they plan to move on: with, or without one another.\n\n“Happiness Over Everything” featuring Miguel & Future, “Tryna Smoke”, and “Party For Me” featuring Ty Dolla $ign all show a side of Jhené that fans are not used to seeing. The three songs draw many comparisons to 90s West Coast Rap. The production on the three tracks are based on funk music and have very laid-back melodies; if you couple that with the fact that the lyrics are related to partying and drugs, listeners are definitely reminded of where Jhené is from. “Party For Me” stands out the most out of the three. While listening fans took to Twitter to say they felt like she channeled her “Inner Nipsey Hussle” on the track, it turns out they were right. The track interpolated Nipsey’s flow on his song “Dedication”. “Party For Me” is seen as a tribute to the late rapper.\n\nIt wouldn’t be a true R&B project without a sensual slow bop, and Jhené delivers just that on track 6 with “P*$$Y Fairy (OTW)”. Although the song is your classic seductive R&B track, it stands out from most songs with a similar subject matter because of its storytelling. Jhené paints a vivid picture of sexual fantasizing, tension, and the actual experience. This is one of the most popular tracks on the project, with many of its lyrics flooding our timelines since its release.\n\nAs a whole, CHILOMBO is quite the experience. If Jhené’s massive dragon tattoo on her back was no indication, fans should know she’s evolved. On Jhené’s social media, you can find the singer reading books like ‘FEAR, Essential Wisdom for Getting Through the Storm’, by Thich Nhat Hanh or ‘Becoming Supernatural’, by DR. Joe Dispenza. There’s a common theme Jhené’s new favorite reads, and her new music share: the concept of healing. In every song on CHILOMBO, the singer has the sounds of a crystal singing bowl embedded into every track. The bowls are used for healing, meditation, reducing stress, and balancing chakras. Along with singing bowls, the album is filled with uplifting and reassuring lyrics.\n\nOn CHILOMBO the four singles on the album were some of the best songs on the project. Often, by the time an artist's full project comes out, their singles are played out. Even though Jhené beautifully steps out of her comfort zone vocally on “Speak”, “Magic Hour”, and “Lightning and Thunder” featuring John Legend; her singles still stand out.\n\nYou can hit me up on twitter @004COURT and let me know what you think.\n\nFavorite Tracks\n\nNone Of Your Concern (Feat.

When looking at his background, it is not much of a surprise that he became this successful, it was only a matter of time. His family is full of talented gospel singers in the Inglewood area and his younger brother, R&B singer SiR, is signed to Top Dawg Entertainment. D Smoke has been working hard on his craft for a long time and that earned him his well-deserved spot on the popular new Netflix competition show Rhythm + Flow. He passed through all of the challenges on the show with flying colors and gave the audience absolutely stunning performances they will never forget. D Smoke went on to win the show and set the bar extremely high for all contestants to come.\n\nD Smoke was very strategic when it came to the lead up and release to this album. Ahead of release he dropped two singles called “Fly” and “No Commas”, along with new music videos for each of them. After that, he went to social media to increase hype by revealing the release date and track list as while as posting pictures relating to the album. These tactics seemed to have paid off big time for him because Black Habits is doing numbers.\n\nBlack Habits, D Smoke’s first official studio album, dropped on February 7th, 2020. The album runs just over an hour long, at about 62 minutes, and was published by WoodWorks Records. Although D Smoke on his own is already incredible, Ari Lennox, Snoop Dogg, and more are featured on this album and are a lot of what brought this beautiful piece together.\n\nMorning Prayer is the lead track for this project. It is mostly composed of a mother and her children going through a prayer before going to school, finishing with a couple of lines from D Smoke. These few lines hint at the upcoming topics he discusses later in the album, like racism and bullying.\n\nSmoke takes a stand in the second song called “Bullies”, where he raps hard with a killer flow. This tough hook will give you a good idea of the tone in the track:\n\n“So fuck y'all bullies We act like we ain't, but us all, bullies Never settlin' for subpar, bullies Don't make a nigga knock the rust off, bullies”\n\nThis song is a statement and it’s dope to see him start the album this way because it lets you know he’s not about to take bullshit from anyone.\n\nThe third track, “No Commas”, has got to be the hardest track on the album. D Smoke attacks bar after bar and snaps for two crazy verses. As if those verses weren’t great enough, he put the icing on the cake with the outro by bouncing back and forth between speaking English and Spanish. This skill really adds a third-dimension to the heavy-hitting cut.\n\nEver since the tracklist was released and I saw Snoop Dogg, my excitement for the album shot through the roof. The two California natives pay homage over a bass-heavy beat for the song titled “Gaspar Yanga”. D Smoke raps for most of it, leading up to Snoop’s fire chorus, giving the track a major west coast feel that is bound to have you bouncing in the whip.\n\nOn the fifth track of the album, “Top of the Morning”, D Smoke presents a great morning-time perspective and outlook on life. Smoke really takes a step back and reminds himself of how we should be attacking the day that lies ahead of us. This song will leave you two-stepping while grinding your daily hustle.\n\nSitting at number ten on the tracklist is “Fallin”, a song about Smoke’s relationship with a girl. He opens up about his feelings in such a real and honest way, and he crushes the analogies, blending the feelings and bars so fluidly. There are three clever verses on this track and D bodies every single one of them.\n\nThe east side and the west side come together to create a masterpiece in “Real Body”, the 12th track on Black Habits. D Smoke and the acclaimed Dreamville singer Ari Lennox go back to back singing sensual verses. It is a bit of a slower track, however, the arrangement of the drums add so much drive that you can’t help but rock your head and sing along.\n\nD Smoke linked with his brother SiR, who is also an immensely talented singer/songwriter, to collaborate “Closer to God”. My favorite part of this song is the instrumentation. Going along with the idea of furthering their relationship with God, the two used pianos and a church organ to successfully create a very spiritual beat.\n\nThe final (and also my favorite) piece on the album is titled “Black Habits II”. The execution of this song is phenomenal. The message behind this song is super powerful, it has a flawless, jazzy beat, and the wordplay is extremely sharp. In every line throughout the intro, chorus, and first verse D Smoke uses the word black. Shining a light on his feelings toward racism, he cleverly adds this twist to make the lines hit so much harder.\n\nThanks to Rhythm + Flow, bilingual rapper D Smoke has finally started to receive the clout he deserves. He has done nothing but keep us constantly entertained and his new album Black Habits is a major turning point for his career. We should expect to see even more growth from the Inglewood rapper in future projects.\n\nFavorite Tracks\n\nGasper Yanga (Ft. Snoop Dogg)\n\nFallin’\n\nBlack Habits II\n\nRating: 7.5\n\nListen to Black Habits here:\n\nWith only two records under his belt, the 19 year old rapper performed with an unparalleled energy that has been missing from the live shows of his peers. One moment the crowd is swelling, yelling ‘I Am 50-Cent!ʼ with the same confident tone that Keem carries on “MOSHPIT”. The next, a fan is brought on-stage, and later Keem excitedly tells the crowd that they are his day one fans - a true honor to those who recognize the star-potential in hi music and persona.\n\nThe actual experience of being in the audience reminded me of smaller punk shows, in which the crowd is almost exclusively comprised of hardcore fans who know every lyric and key-change. As we all danced and attempted to mirror Keemʼs vitality, I found myself inches away from various celebrities, such as the bedroom-pop icon Cuco, and Odd Futureʼs Taco. We were all there with similar intentions, attempting to remain present and enjoy the moment as much as possible.\n\nThe days of small shows are numbered for Keem because even though he only had two records of material to pull from, every song felt like a hit. Every song was welcomed from the fans like an unexpected encore, from the breakout hit “ORANGE SODA”, to the slower ballad “BULLIES”, to the truly iconic “Baby Keem”. I look forward to seeing where his career takes him, and since the show he has gained accolades from Spotify, Billboard, and even had a chance to meet Jay-Z a few days ago. When I see him next it could either be at the Oracle or at The Forum, but I know that wherever it is the show is going to be incredible.\n\nThe rise of AzChike has officially begun. The trailblazing rapper is already popping in his Los Angeles (his hometown) it's just a matter of time until the rest of the world catches on. Chike has steadily gained a fan base over his time in the spotlight since 2015. The LA party scene is very familiar with his substantial talent due to his early hits such as “Licked Up” and “The Shit” frequently gracing functions of all sizes in SoCal. He has gained a reputation of bringing enormous amounts of energy to every performance he is apart of, and every track he hops on. Chike seems to be attempting to do things his way, and by his own rules. His sound and style both in and outside of the rap game are completely himself and never compromise.\n\nI feel like a lot of AzChike’s appeal can really be seen when he is performing. Before this interview, I had the pleasure of seeing him and 1TakeJay perform at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles. The moment Chike took the stage the energy shifted and the crowd was his. Even after his performance, he might have been the most hype person on the stage for 1TakeJay’s set. His authenticity and energy will continue to attract fans and serve him very well throughout the remainder of his career. My conversation with AzChike, lightly edited for content and clarity, follows below:\n\nMiles Hagan, StereoVision (MH): How much does it mean for you to be able to perform in your hometown?\n\nAzChike (AZ): That shit means everything. It's the best shows on the tour every time we go out. I spend the most money on clothes for the LA show too I come to show love and show up.\n\nMH: How important is the city of LA to you?\n\nAZ: LA is everything. I grew up all over LA I’m really a native. I'm from 86th and Figueroa, I went to Domingues high, I'm really a native and I love this city. That the sound right there, I don't really do anything else. I tried more conscious and trap, but that LA sound is what really helped me blow up. I mixed everything in from bars, to flow, to strategies. LA is everything.\n\nMH: How do you feel about being a trendsetter both in fashion and in your music?\n\nAZ: I don't really expect it in music, because I just try to snap in the studio every time. With clothes, I’m just blessed to be able to do things like spend 2000 dollars on a scarf. I take it pretty seriously.\n\nMH: How would you describe AZCult and who are the members?\n\nAZ: AzSwaye, AzBroll, and AzPorter. We have extensions that definitely help us outside, but it's really just family. We a cult, if you wanna join show blood for real. Show blood and show drip and that's really it.\n\nMH: From your earlier post today you are in Album mode, what can we expect from the new music?\n\nAZ: I'm just having fun giving you the vibes, and turning up. I intentionally did just fun shit right now, so y’all wouldn’t expect the melodies and the vibey shit that’s coming. I love that you love it, because then that gives me more room to do things, and show I’m versatile. I really just wanna have fun on my first project.\n\nMH: Anything else to say to the fans?\n\nAZ: Just have fun and never think too hard. Just work for what you want and believe in yourself. You don't have to be a rapper or a part of these big shows, just be the best at whatever it is you choose to do.\n\n1TakeJay was born and raised in Compton California. Through his high school years he was a football star but frequently changed schools before suffering a career ending injury. Growing up, Jay frequently listened to jerkin’ music, a style that is deeply rooted in Los Angeles culture. This musical influence is apparent in Jay’s music and his club trap certainly feels like a natural evolution for LA jerk rap.\n\nJay quickly exploded onto the rap scene in the fall of 2018 with his viral hit “Hello” which sampled Apple’s “Marimba” ringtone in the instrumental. Fans were instantly drawn to 1Take’s unique delivery and was frequently described as “Blueface but he can rap”. He followed up the smash hit with his debut mixtape Wait Hol Up which showcased impressive features from other LA all-stars such as AzChike and Kalan.FrFr while simultaneously introducing us to other members of the 1TakeBoys like 1TakeQuan and 1TakeTeezy. The tapes lead single “Arco” quickly became Jay’s signature song and another viral hit. This summer, 1Take dropped his latest smash “Drip Walking” which we can only expect to be the focus track off his upcoming album.\n\nEver since Jay’s first record, Los Angeles has known he was hot and has rocked with him every step of the way. While I loved turning up to his music the past year, I wasn’t sold on 1Take’s longevity as an artist until I watched his enthralling live performance where he almost brought the El Rey Theater to the ground. My conversation with 1TakeJay, lightly edited for content and clarity, follows below:\n\nSpencer Lobdell, StereoVision (SL): I read that you had a pretty impressive football career throughout high school and even had multiple Division 1 offer. Can tell me a little about 1TakeJay the football star?\n\n1TakeJay (1TJ): Well I played QB in high school but that was honestly just because we didn’t have anyone else. I really liked playing cornerback - that’s what I always thought I was the best at. I was thinking about going to play in college but I got hurt and that was that.\n\nSL: When did you start rapping and how did that come about?\n\n1TJ: I probably started in 2014. The homie 1TakeTeezy had the studio and the whole crew would make songs all the time. One day they just kept telling me “get on, get on” so I hoped on the track and from that point on I was fuckin’ with it. Still to this day there hasn’t been a moment when it’s occurred to me that this is my career, it’s more just me and the homies having fun.\n\nSL: How did you guys come up with the name 1Take?\n\n1TJ: Low key it came from competition. At first it was just like “let me do this better than the homie” than it turned into “let me do this better than the homie and in less time” and we ended up at 1TakeBoys.\n\nSL: How does it feel to come up with the people you’ve known your entire life?\n\n1TJ: Honestly shit just feels regular because nothing changed. We still do all the same stuff haha.\n\nSL: What can you tell me about The Machine Works label?\n\n1TJ: Yeah Machine Works is brand new this year shoutout TK and Picaso (The founders of Machine Works). Basically it’s a new record label under Atlantic Records that represents me and AzChike. It’s all the same people I was already working with, they just got an imprint to make it an official thing and to make sure everything stays in house.\n\nSL: DJ Mustard dropped one of the albums of the year this summer with Perfect Ten and you kick the project off with your high energy banger “Intro”. How did your relationship with Mustard begin and did that track feel any different to you than your other hits?\n\n1TJ: I’ve been fucking with Mustard way before we did a song so it was never like “Bro let’s get in the studio” he just sent me the beat one day and asked if I liked it. The instrumental was hard so I did the track and he obviously liked it because he put it on his album. It didn’t feel any different because I was just talking shit. Mustard told me “Don’t even try and make a song, just gas it like Arco” so that’s what I did.\n\nHykeem Carter (AKA Baby Keem) is hip-hop’s most exciting young voice. The young Las Vegas artist has been deeply rooted in the industry since long before any of his own solo music was released. He is particularly connected to powerhouse label TDE as he got his big break when he landed a spot producing tracks on Kendrick Lamar’s 2018 Black Panther movie soundtrack. Since then he won a grammy for producing tracks on Jay Rock’s Redemption, produced hit songs like ScHoolboy Q’s “Numb Numb Juice”, and created a large buzz for his own solo music.\n\nIn October of 2018, Keem released his well-received debut mixtape The Sound of Bad Habit. The tape boasted impressive songs like “Baby Keem”, “Gang Activities”, and “Miss Charlotte” which all point to early signs of stardom. The tape showcases Keem’s stylistic diversity as well as his unique dialect and vocabulary. Anyone who heard Sound of a Bad Habit spent nine months in intense anticipation for the promising projects follow up.\n\nWhile Keem and his manager, Brock Korsan, both teased album snip-bits on their Instagram for months during the conception of the album, the official rollout for Die For My Bitch began on June 11th with the release of his absolutely addicting single “INVENTED IT”. The upbeat, infectious cut only lasts a minute and a half and will have you hitting replay for hours. The hook boasts his unique vocabulary that takes some deciphering (“Big protein I’m smoking lonely for the culture/No Ted Talk I’m stepping on a little roach”) leading to the consumption of Baby Keem’s music being somewhat reminiscent of that of fellow LA artist Drakeo The Ruler.\n\nA month later Keem released the album’s second single, “FRANCE FREESTYLE”. The cut is gritty, tough as nails, and couldn’t sound less like the radio-friendly “INVENTED IT”. The menacing song hits every beat and should be added to weight-lifting playlists across the country.\n\nA week later on Hykeem released the final single off Die For My Bitch, “ORANGE SODA”. The song’s title is one way that Keem refers to the women in his life yet again shining a light on his uncommon way of talking.\n\nOn July 19th Baby Keem independently released Die For My Bitch. The mixtape is 14 tracks long, runs for 34 minutes, and has no featured artists.\n\nThe album starts with a voicemail from an unnamed girl who is furious with Keem and tells him to call her back immediately. This voicemail is a reoccurring theme throughout the project although the mystery women’s tone changes from angry to desperate as the tape progresses. After the short voicemail commences the beat hits and it hits hard. “STATS” is an excellent attention-getter and introduces new fans to Keem’s intentionally-provocative rapping and his unmatched confidence (“Baby Keem just humbled a model”). Halfway through the song, there is a soulful ten-second interlude that alerts us that Keem is far more than your standard trap rapper. This interlude is interrupted by Keem’s slicing ad-libs as we are instantly transported back to chaos.\n\nOn the second track “HONEST” Keem makes it known that he is far from one dimensional as he turns the intensity down for the emotional cut about returning to your ex when things aren’t going so well. Keem’s brutal honesty is on display throughout the whole tape but is especially present on this track (“You’re not who I love, I just need to pass the time”). In the second verse, Keem sings “Baby Keem, shit I’m chosen” and even though we’re only six minutes into the tape, it’s hard to not believe him.\n\nAfter we hear two of the afro mentioned singles (“INVENTED IT” & “FRANCE FREESTYLE”) we are transported to the beautiful soundscape that is “BULLIES”. The team of producers that worked on this track masterfully created an instrumental that is layered with swirling synths and harmonies that make this track feel like it exists in its own world. Keem’s hook on this track is one of the most addicting stanzas on the album making chill cut an early favorite.\n\nCasey Veggies dropped his first mixtape in 2007 when he was 14. He was a founding member of Odd Future and then left to work with fellow Los Angeles native YG. He signed a major record deal with Epic Records, released his debut album Live & Grow, and quietly disappeared.\n\nAs we recently learned in a telling interview with DJ Booth, Veggies didn’t disappear but rather was at war with his record label, Epic Records. Veggies believed that the label didn’t believe in him as an artist and only wanted hits. “They had me waiting a little too long to drop music, and from them telling me they want this type of records, them telling me “We want hits,” we kind of hit a wall. It’s like, y’all want one thing, but y’all not necessarily helping me get that.”\n\nFast forward four years and countless piles of paperwork later and Casey Veggies is back with his most personal offering to date, a tape called Organic which was released independently free from the ropes that Record labels had used to tie him down.\n\nVeggies released three singles prior to the release of Organic starting with “Mirage” back in February. The single allows us to dive into Casey’s psyche while reminding us that the veteran spitter has flow. A single called “Awarded” came next and would end up being the albums lead single and the only track to get a music video upon release. “Stop Playing” featuring LA peer Dom Kennedy was the final single coming out a week before the release of Organic.\n\nOrganic was released on June 7th as a 10-track effort with a run time of 36 minutes.\n\nThe album gets right into things with the intro track “Dream$” being one of my favorite joints on the project. Casey raps about his come up over a dreamy instrumental with a classic Los Angeles drawl and a back and forth flow that we’ve been missing since his last release in 2015. Veggies vocal layering is terrific on the hook and solidify this as one of the best offerings on this tape.\n\nCasey keeps his momentum with the second track and lead single, “Awarded”. The track is insanely catchy and a flex at the root of the term (“When I walk in the building I’m very important/I kept it real and ain’t get awarded). Two tracks into the album and there is already a strong theme of resiliency and independence.\n\n“I Came Up” is the fifth song on the album and is host legendary west coast features YG and E-40. The song is as California as it gets with a G-Funk inspired instrumental that sounds like a perfect home for LA rapper 03 Greedo. YG and E-40 both live up to expectations and deliver solid verses that showcase their signature styles.\n\nThe seventh song on the album is “Candy” which features another iconic Los Angeles rapper, The Game. “Candy” is a love song about a true ride-or-die girlfriend who is good for more than hitting the town and popping bottles. I think Game precisely sums up the demeanor of this track on the last two lines of his second verse when he raps, “She from the 30's and I fuck with her/Witness to my first murder, nigga, so I'm stuck with her”.\n\n“No Favors” follows “Candy” and is filled with joy and pride. On this track, Casey is transparent as an independent emcee who signed a record deal and learned that his artistic freedom is priceless. He brags that he is now free from Epic Record’s restrictive collar and able to do exactly as he pleases without needing to ask for favors.\n\nCasey Veggies’ was gone for four years. He slowly floated out of relevance and it seemed like everyone had forgotten about the OG Odd Future emcee. That is until 2019 when the resilient rapper reinvented himself and burst back into the rap game with his independent offering Organic. The album is focused, entertaining, and delivers a clear message of toughness and independence. Casey’s pen game is sharp and while the topics are presented in a way we’ve seen before they are executed well. Casey Veggies has returned from the sunken place and is here to stay.\n\nFavorite Tracks:\n\nDream$\n\nAwarded\n\nCandy (Feat. The Game)\n\nRating: 7.5\n\nListen to Organic here:"
