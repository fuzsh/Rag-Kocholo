        "text": "Developed in collaboration with domestic and sexual violence prevention charity NO MORE, the new true crime series tells the true story of a group of women who came together to bring a murderous ex-boyfriend to justice\n\nListen To Episode One Now\n\nNEW YORK – July 10, 2023 – iHeartPodcasts and Novel announced today the launch of a new, true crime podcast “The Girlfriends,” in collaboration with NO MORE, a global nonprofit dedicated to ending domestic and sexual violence.\n\nThe podcast tells the true story of a group of women who formed a club to put a murderous ex-boyfriend behind bars. The story illuminates the ways women unite to protect each other when systems of justice fail them. The first episode of the weekly podcast is available today, distributed by iHeartPodcasts. Listen to episode one here and on all major podcast platforms.\n\nUnlike your typical true crime, The Girlfriends is not about the murderer, Bob. It’s about his wife Gail, and the other women who dated him that could have suffered the same fate. It’s about Gail’s sister Alayne, who never gave up the fight for justice. It's about the gratitude she felt when she learned that a sisterhood of women in Las Vegas and New York were on her side.\n\nHosted by Carole Fisher, one of 'The Girlfriends', the series is hard-hitting, but also empowering and galvanizing, with heart-warming moments. Set to an original choral score by Luisa Gerstein from Deep Throat Choir, women’s voices are at the center of this true justice series.\n\n“The Girlfriends” is distributed by iHeartPodcasts. Listeners can hear episode one now on the iHeartRadio app, and everywhere podcasts are heard.\n\nDownload cover art here.\n\nEditor’s Note:\n\nInclude the podcast audio player directly into your article or website by using the embed code below:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-girlfriends/introducing-the-girlfriends/embed\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Introducing: The Girlfriends\"></iframe>\n\nAbout Novel\n\nNovel is the leading independent premium podcast company making shows that go long on story, rich in detail and heavy on sonics.\n\nThe world is now building a new kind of relationship with audio and Novel is at the forefront of shaping that landscape.
