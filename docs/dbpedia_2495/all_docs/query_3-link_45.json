        "text": "Cole Swindell debuted a romantic new anthem from his highly-anticipated deluxe album on Friday (March 17). The country hitmaker marked the occasion with a sweet reel on Instagram featuring his longtime girlfriend, Courtney Little.\n\n“…your heart/ Wasn't made to be broken/ Wasn't meant to be in pieces/ It was made to be loved/ Done by someone who'll never leave it/ Wasn't made to be left out in the middle of the pouring rain/ I know you've been there but girl this ain’t/ Yesterday, and I'm gonna show ya/ That baby, your heart wasn't made to be broken/ Wasn't made to be broken”\n\n“My 4th studio album has done so much for us this past year,” Swindell said when he released his first single from the deluxe album “Drinkaby,” in January. “I felt we had a few more songs that deserved to be part of the project and I can’t wait for y’all to hear them.”\n\n“Broken” marks the second new track to release from Stereotype Broken, the extended version of Swindell’s project that released last year. The original 13-track collection included “Single Saturday Night,” “Never Say Never,” with Lainey Wilson, and the smash-hit anthem “She Had Me at Heads Carolina,” inspired by Jo Dee Messina’s iconic ‘90s single, “Heads Carolina, Tails California.” Swindell’s “She Had Me At Heads Carolina” — which got a remixed version with Messina — is nominated in the Country Song of the Year category at the 2023 iHeartRadio Music Awards.\n\nThe 2023 iHeartRadio Music Awards, which is now in its 10th year, will air live from The Dolby Theater in Los Angeles, California, on Monday, March 27 from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET live (PT tape-delayed) on FOX. Fans can also listen to the event on nationwide iHeartRadio stations and on the iHeartRadio app. Tickets to the event go on sale to the general public on Wednesday, February 15 at 12 p.m. ET/9 a.m. PT. The highly-anticipated awards show w ill celebrate the most-played music in 2022 and preview upcoming hits in 2023. Viewers can catch star-studded award presentations, live performances and more.\n\nStereotype Broken is slated to release on April 28. Listen to “Broken” here:"
