        "text": "Everyone’s favourite British musician Harry Styles has finally released his new album, Fine Line, and with it, the song everyone’s been waiting for: ‘Cherry’.\n\nAhead of the release of his new record, Styles revealed that ‘Cherry’ is not only about one of his ex-girlfriends – 33-year-old French model Camille Rowe – but that her voice actually features at the end.\n\n“When we listened back to the album, I asked her to add it in,” he told Zane Lowe last month when prompted about whose voice is in the song. “I think she liked it.”\n\nHe continued: “‘Cherry’ is about… I wanted it to reflect how I felt then. I was feeling not great. It’s all about being not great. Because you get petty when things don’t go the way you want it. There’s parts that’s so pathetic.”\n\nREAD: What It’s Really Like To Be In A Room With Harry Styles ACCORDING TO OUR EDITOR\n\nWhen Styles references pathetic parts of the song, he’s likely speaking of the lyrics which take a dig at Rowe’s current boyfriend, Theo Niarchos, an art dealer whose parents reportedly own one of the world’s biggest private art collections. In one verse Styles sings, ‘Does he take you walking ’round his parents’ gallery?’ While the song’s chorus reads, ‘Don’t you call him “baby”/We’re not talking lately/Don’t you call him what you used to call me.’\n\nRowe and Styles started dating mid-2017 before ending their relationship a year later. Though neither party has confirmed a reason for the split, Styles alludes to cheating on Rowe in another of his new songs, ‘Fallen.’ In it, Styles sings: ‘I’m in my bed you’re not here/And there’s no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands/Forget what I said, it’s not what I meant/Now I can’t take it back.’\n\nAs ‘Cherry’ ends, a voicemail from Rowe in French plays:\n\nCoucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j’suis désolée…\n\nBah non… Nan, c’est pas important…\n\nBon allez… On a été à la plage, et maintenant on—\n\nParfait ! Harry\n\nThe message translates in English to “Hello! Are you asleep? Oh, I’m sorry…Well, no… No, it’s not important. Well… We went to the beach and now we… Perfect! Harry.”\n\nSpeaking to Rolling Stone for a cover interview earlier this year, Styles said that music is the place where he’s willing to talk about his love life publicly. “It’s not like I’ve ever sat and done an interview and said, ’So I was in a relationship, and this is what happened,’” Styles said. “Because, for me, music is where I let that cross over. It’s the only place, strangely, where it feels right to let that cross over.”\n\nWhile there’s probably a large percentage of the world who’d like to see Rowe and Styles reconcile in the wake of his love song, if he really did cheat on her, it’s pretty brilliant that she decided to cut ties and move on – with a cultured billionaire, no less. Currently channelling Camille Break Up Energy for 2020.\n\nListen to ‘Cherry’ below."
