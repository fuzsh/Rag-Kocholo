Band info

Epic Records definitely did its homework before unleashing B2K into the pop market. The boy band of clean cut and suave young black men is everything a marketing department dreams about and attractive teens becoming men who make the girls melt with a little bit of a rugged, tough guy attitude and flashy clothes. Of course, there are also the dance beats that are as much dance-pop as hip-hop. In fact, you might even wager a bet that the many producers and songwriters on this album had been listening to a bit of Craig David and other British 2-step pop stars. Plus, the group members are capable singers as well, which is another bonus. Overall, with the girl-magnet looks, the trendy radio-ready production, and the limitless vocal hooks, Epic Records has all the makings of pop stardom in B2K, including a market-testing hit single in "Uh Huh" that set the stage for the group's debut album.

Album performance

B2K, a self-titled album, gets off to a good start, jumping right into some of its best songs, "Gots ta Be", "Understanding," and "Why I Love You". It also reached #2 at on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart. Before unleashing the album highlight, the aforementioned "Uh Huh". From there, the album gets progressively long-winded, running through 17 songs in total.
