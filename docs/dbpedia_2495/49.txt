Two years into a young career, B2K had three proper studio albums, a holiday album, and two remix compilations on the shelves. After that third studio album, they broke up. The obvious next step? A best-of, of course. All of the chart hits dating from 2002 and 2003 are included ("Uh Uh," "Bump, Bump, Bump," "Gots ta Be," "Girlfriend"), along with a handful of album cuts. Though this compilation might've been seen as just another piece of product to take advantage of the group's fan base, it was actually quite handy and timely for casual fans who couldn't keep up with the group's release schedule. When this was released, the oldest song was two years old, so just about everything should've been fresh in the memory of the average listener.
