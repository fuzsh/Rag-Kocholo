        "text": "Letter From The Director\n\nLetter from\n\nthe Director\n\nDear Friends,\n\nO\n\nne of the most rewarding things about working at Stanford is being surrounded by so many people who care deeply about education and recognize its unique potential to strengthen community ties and bring out the best in humanity. Coming together in our classrooms—whether online or on campus—we are reminded to be awed and inspired by art, music, and literature; to appreciate the nuances and complexities of international cultures and conflicts; and to reflect on the state of democracy and human rights and decide how we will choose to engage.\n\nThis fall, we have planned three terrific courses focused on democracy, voting rights, and the upcoming presidential election. We are grateful to Jim Steyer for bringing together an extraordinary speaker series on “Election 2024: Democracy on the Ballot,” highlighting prominent political leaders, activists, scholars, and journalists, including Nicholas Kristof, Pam Karlan, and more. We are also excited to have Stanford law professor Nate Persily teach a hybrid course on “The Right to Vote and the Law of US Democracy” and Stanford lecturer emeritus Martin Lewis teach “The Historical Geography of US Presidential Elections.”\n\nWe’re also pleased to be offering courses exploring wider global perspectives. Thomas Fingar, a lecturer with the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Relations, will teach “US-China Relations: From Cold War to Cold Shoulder.” Stanford visiting scholar Amir Kamel will teach a new course exploring the role of the US dollar within the global economy, including the rise of the International Monetary Fund. And Gizem Sivri, a Stanford visiting scholar in Islamic Studies, will teach “Beyond the Veil: Women and Social Transformation in the Middle East.”\n\nNew liberal arts courses in our lineup will illuminate how art responds to societal shifts and serves as a powerful catalyst for change. Stanford art history professor Emanuele Lugli—who previously worked as a journalist at Vogue—will teach “Fashion and Other Disasters: A History of Clothing from the Middle Ages to Modern Brands,” an adapted version of his Stanford undergraduate course, which explores fashion as a philosophical concept and a global enterprise. The course considers the connection between transformative moments in fashion and dark periods in history, from the European plague in 1348 to World War II. We are also pleased to have Stanford history lecturer Theresa Iker joining us to teach “Taylor Swift and Millennial America,” a course exploring how the iconic musician was shaped by the culture she grew up in even as she influenced listeners of her generation and beyond.\n\nWe also want to thank Stanford GSB lecturer Matt Abrahams—a dear friend of our program and podcast host of Think Fast, Talk Smart—for developing and leading a dynamic new speaker series, “Communication Essentials for Work and Life.” In this course, students will learn how to enhance communication and master the art of influence, addressing topics like nonverbal presence, reputation management, storytelling, and building rapport.\n\nFinally, we are excited to announce a new opportunity for those of you eager to take an even deeper dive into the world of AI. Our three-course “AI Leadership Series”—along with an optional summer capstone course devoted to exploring careers in AI—launches this fall. The first course, “Introducing AI Systems,” will be taught by Gaurav Khanna, senior manager of data science and digital journeys at Cisco Systems. The series will continue in winter with a “Leading AI Transformation” course followed by “Building and Scaling AI Solutions” in spring.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you in class!\n\nWarmly,\n\nJennifer Deitz\n\nDirector & Associate Dean\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFeatured Courses\n\nExplore a curated selection of Stanford’s top courses across various disciplines, designed to provide an exceptional learning experience\n\nLiberal Arts & Sciences\n\nImmerse yourself in the liberal arts to awaken your creativity, enhance your critical thinking abilities, and gain a deeper understanding of our complex world.\n\nArt Studio\n\nReignite your capacity for creativity in an art studio course.\n\nFood & Drink\n\nIndulge your taste buds in a culinary journey through our Food & Drink courses.\n\nWellness & Health\n\nPrioritize your health and wellness with courses designed to help you build healthy habits and support your mental and emotional well-being.\n\nCreative Writing\n\nWhether you’re just beginning to write or putting the finishing touches on your first novel, our writing courses offer expert instruction from accomplished authors, individual attention, and supportive feedback.\n\nCommunication\n\nHone your communication skills and learn how to convey a clear, compelling, and consistent message.\n\nBusiness\n\nOur business courses will equip you with the knowledge and skills you need to succeed in building your career, launching a startup, or growing a business.\n\nTechnology & Data Science\n\nEmbark on a journey through artificial intelligence, master a new coding language, or dive into the world of data science.\n\nWriting Certificates\n\nHave you always wanted to write a book?

Key figures in politics, business, foreign policy, academia, and media will tackle crucial questions: How can we strengthen democracy across political divides?

And how can we prioritize children and families in our national policies?\n\nThe Right to Vote and the Law of US Democracy\n\nNate Persily\n\nJames B. McClatchy Professor of Law and Professor, by courtesy, of Communication and of Political Science, Stanford\n\nThe 2024 election is upon us. Record numbers of Americans believe the election will not be free and fair.

In this course, Stanford law professor Nate Persily will provide a foundational understanding of the themes in the law and policies related to elections and politics and cover major Supreme Court cases on voting rights, redistricting, ballot access, campaign finance, and more.\n\nThe Historical Geography of US Presidential Elections\n\nMartin Lewis\n\nSenior Lecturer in International History, Emeritus, Stanford\n\nThe 2024 elections come on the heels of important transformations in the political geography of the United States. New swing states are emerging, and former purple states are turning more red or blue. Historian Martin Lewis will lead this map-intensive exploration of American presidential elections from 1788 to the present. The course will delve into voting patterns at state and county levels as well as the ethnic, economic, and educational characteristics that influence election results—with an eye on the complex factors that will play out on November 5, 2024.\n\nFeatured Courses\n\nFeatured Courses\n\nOnline\n\nEmanuele Lugli\n\nAssistant Professor of Art and Art History, Stanford\n\nFashion is both a philosophical concept and an influential industry.

These events provide a foundation for understanding the evolving narratives that drive fashion’s continuous reinvention.\n\nOnline\n\nMichael McWilliams\n\nProfessor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Emeritus, Stanford\n\nWater is central to the evolution of life on Earth—and it has been for billions of years, shaping and defining our planet.
