        "text": "In the following clip, as taken from the Marx Brothers’ 1940 film Go West, Chico Marx, accompanied by his brother Harpo, entertains a crowd of onlookers with an impromptu performance on the piano. Adopting his signature style of playing, in which he “shoots” the keys with his thumb up and index finger straight, like a gun, Chico delivers one of his quintessential performances — one which is showy, flamboyant and engrossing. It is midway through that he proceeds to snatch an apple from Harpo’s mouth and use it to play the piano.\n\nGroucho Marx once said that Chico never practised the piano pieces he played; instead, he would soak his fingers in hot water before performing.\n\nGROUCHO AND CHICO MARX AT THEIR FORMIDABLE BEST IN HORSE FEATHERS (1932): THE PASSWORD SCENE"
