An extended range of multituberculate Kryptobaatar and distribution of mammals in the Upper Cretaceous of the Gobi Desert. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 48 (2) 273-278. The Late Cretaceous multituberculate mammal Kryptobaatar dashzevegi Kielan−Jaworowska, 1970 is the most common mammalian taxon in the Upper Cretaceous (?lower Campanian) rocks of the Djadokhta Formation at\n\nMultituberculates were the most abundant and diversified mammals during the Mesozoic, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere (see Kielan-Jaworowska et al., 2004; and Hahn and Hahn, 2006, for the bibliography). Adapted for an omnivorous to herbivorous diet, multituberculates were the longestlived order of the class Mammalia; they appeared in the Middle Jurassic (Bathonian), survived the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, and persisted until the Early Cenozoic (Late Eocene). The order Multituberculata consists ...\n\nNew Late Cretaceous mammals from the Intertrappean beds of Rangapur, India and paleobiogeographic framework. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 48 (3): 331–348. A new mammal−bearing locality from the Intertrappean beds (Maastricthian) of Rangapur, Andhra Pradesh, India pro− vides isolated teeth referable to Deccanolestes and a new eutherian, Sahnitherium rangapurensis. Dental comparisons with Cimolestes, Procerberus, and Aboletylestes do not support proposed “palaeoryctoid ” affinities for Deccanolestes. Although similarities exist with Otlestes and Batodon, Deccanolestes is currently considered to be of uncertain familial affinities. Sahnitherium rangapurensis exhibits similarities to Procerberus, Paranyctoides, Alostera, Aboletylestes, and Avitotherium, but it is here placed within Eutheria incertae sedis. Despite family level taxonomic uncertainties, the new material confirms the presence of eutherians on the Indian subcontinent during the Late Cretaceous. A Eurasian connec− tion via ..."
