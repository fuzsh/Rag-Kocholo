In a move to advance the company's position in the market for atrial fibrillation (AF) treatments, St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Paul, MN, USA) has made a US$15 million minority investment in Epicor Medical, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Epicor is a developer of new devices for AF treatment.

Epicor has developed a high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation system for epicardial treatment of AF. The technology allows an ablation device to be placed on the outside of the heart to deliver focused ultrasound energy across the wall of the heart to create very precise and complete lines of electrical block to halt the propagation of AF. In early trials, the technique was shown to have the potential to be a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment for AF without placing the patient on a cardiopulmonary bypass system.

St. Jude is an important manufacturer of implantable defibrillators and heart valve products. The company's pacemaker products incorporate the AF Supression Algorithm, the first clinically proven technology to suppress atrial fibrillation.

"This investment in Epicor Medical has the potential to strengthen St. Jude Medical's position in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, a major healthcare challenge,” said Terry L. Shepherd, chairman and CEO of St. Jude. "Epicor's technology is unique and has the potential to deal definitely and simply with patients suffering from even the most difficult forms of AF.”
