We report on the technical credentialing program as prerequisite for centres joining the trial. Participating centres were asked to develop treatment plans for two test cases to assess their ability to create plans according to protocol. Dose delivery in the presence of inhomogeneity and motion was assessed during a site visit using a phantom with moving inserts. Site visits for the trial were conducted in 16 Australian and 3 New Zealand radiotherapy facilities. The tests with low density inhomogeneities confirmed shortcomings of the AAA algorithm for dose calculation. Dose was assessed for a typical treatment delivery including at least one non-coplanar beam in a stationary and moving phantom. This end-to-end test confirmed that all participating centres were able to deliver stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy with the required accuracy while the planning study demonstrated that they were able to produce acceptable plans for both test cases. The credentialing process documented that participating centres were able to deliver dose as required in the trial protocol. It also gave an opportunity to provide education about the trial and discuss technical issues such as four-dimensionalÂ CT, small field dosimetry and patient immobilisation with staff in participating centres. Advances in knowledge: Credentialing is an important quality assurance tool for radiotherapy trials using advanced technology. In addition to confirming technical competence, it provides an opportunity for education and discussion about the trial.\n\nA preclinical rodent model of acute radiation-induced lung injury after ablative focal irradiation reflecting clinical stereotactic body radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHong, Zhen-Yu; Lee, Hae-June; Choi, Won Hoon; Lee, Yoon-Jin; Eun, Sung Ho; Lee, Jung Il; Park, Kwangwoo; Lee, Ji Min; Cho, Jaeho\n\n2014-07-01\n\nIn a previous study, we established an image-guided small-animal micro-irradiation system mimicking clinical stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). The goal of this study was to develop a rodent model of acute phase lung injury after ablative irradiation. A radiation dose of 90 Gy was focally delivered to the left lung of C57BL/6 mice using a small animal stereotactic irradiator. At days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 14 after irradiation, the lungs were perfused with formalin for fixation and paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome. At days 7 and 14 after irradiation, micro-computed tomography (CT) images of the lung were taken and lung functional measurements were performed with a flexiVentâ¢ system. Gross morphological injury was evident 9 days after irradiation of normal lung tissues and dynamic sequential events occurring during the acute phase were validated by histopathological analysis. CT images of the mouse lungs indicated partial obstruction located in the peripheral area of the left lung. Significant alteration in inspiratory capacity and tissue damping were detected on day 14 after irradiation. An animal model of radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) in the acute phase reflecting clinical stereotactic body radiotherapy was established and validated with histopathological and functional analysis. This model enhances our understanding of the dynamic sequential events occurring in the acute phase of radiation-induced lung injury induced by ablative dose focal volume irradiation.\n\nThe development of stereotactic body radiotherapy in the past decade: a global perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nLo, Simon S; Slotman, Ben J; Lock, Michael; Nagata, Yasushi; Guckenberger, Matthias; Siva, Shankar; Foote, Matthew; Tan, Daniel; Teh, Bin S; Mayr, Nina A; Chang, Eric L; Timmerman, Robert D; Sahgal, Arjun\n\n2015-09-04\n\nIn the past 10 years, there has been an exponential increase in the incorporation of stereotactic body radiotherapy, also known as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, into the armamentarium against various types of cancer in different settings worldwide.

This brings with it new technological challenges for set-up of a SABR program and continuing quality assurance. Compared with intracranial procedures SABR requires consideration of motion and inhomogeneities and has to deal with a much larger variety of targets ranging from lung to liver, kidney and bone. To meet many of the challenges virtually all advances in modern radiotherapy, such as Intensity Modulated and Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IMRT and IGRT) are used. Considering the few fractions and high doses per fraction delivered to complex targets it is not surprising that patient specific quality control is considered essential for safe delivery. Given the variety of targets and clinical scenarios we employ different strategies for different patients to ensure that the most important aspects of the treatment are appropriately tested, be it steep dose gradients, inhomogeneities or the delivery of dose in the presence of motion. The current paper reviews the different approaches and phantoms utilised at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre for SABR QA.\n\nThe role of technology in clinical trials using stereotactic body radiotherapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRomero, Alejandra MÃ©ndez; Heijmen, Ben J M\n\n2017-01-01\n\nStereotactic body radiotherapy is a highly technology-driven treatment modality. The wider availability of in-room imaging and advanced radiotherapy delivery techniques has led to more institutions offering stereotactic ablative therapy (SABR). While some technological challenges remain, the crucial point for the next generation of SABR clinical trials is that today's technology is used correctly and close to its optimal potential for accuracy. The credentialing procedure of SABR needs to be extensive, but this investment will benefit the trial itself, the patients and the professionals involved.

Radiation therapy modulates tumour phenotypes, enhances antigen presentation and tumour immunogenicity, increases production of cytokines and alters the tumour microenvironment, enabling destruction of the tumour by the immune system. Investigating the combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapeutic agents, which also promote the host antitumour immune response is, therefore, a logical progression. As the spectrum of clinical use of stereotactic radiotherapy continues to broaden, the question arose as to whether the ablative radiation doses used can also stimulate immune responses and, if so, whether we can amplify these effects by combining immunotherapy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). In this Perspectives article, we explore the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting activation of the immune system following SABR. We then examine studies that provide data on the effectiveness of combining these two techniques - immunotherapy and SABR - in an approach that we have termed 'ISABR'. Lastly, we provide general guiding principles for the development of future clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of ISABR in the hope of generating further interest in these exciting developments.\n\nThe Confluence of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy and Tumor Immunology\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFinkelstein, Steven Eric; Timmerman, Robert; McBride, William H.; Schaue, DÃ¶rthe; Hoffe, Sarah E.; Mantz, Constantine A.; Wilson, George D.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nStereotactic radiation approaches are gaining more popularity for the treatment of intracranial as well as extracranial tumors in organs such as the liver and lung. Technology, rather than biology, is driving the rapid adoption of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), also known as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), in the clinic due to advances in precise positioning and targeting. Dramatic improvements in tumor control have been demonstrated; however, our knowledge of normal tissue biology response mechanisms to large fraction sizes is lacking. Herein, we will discuss how SABR can induce cellular expression of MHC I, adhesion molecules, costimulatory molecules, heat shock proteins, inflammatory mediators, immunomodulatory cytokines, and death receptors to enhance antitumor immune responses.

Plan delivery was evaluated at three breathing rates ranging from 7 to 23 breaths-per-minute (BPM) against the planning anatomy (15 BPM) calculated dose. Dynamic ion chamber, EBT3 film and Fricke-xylenol orange-gelatin (FXG) gel measurements were acquired using a motion phantom with appropriate inserts for each dosimeter. The results show good agreement between measured and calculated plan dose within the internal gross tumour volume (IGTV) target.\n\nEF5 PET of Tumor Hypoxia: A Predictive Imaging Biomarker of Response to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) for Early Lung Cancer\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2014-09-01\n\nPredictive Imaging Biomarker of Response to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy ( SABR ) for Early Lung Cancer PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Billy W...CONTRACT NUMBER Response to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy ( SABR ) for Early Lung Cancer 5b.

The development of systemic therapy has led to prolonged survival. However, in selected patients with a finite number of discrete lesions in liver, defined as oligometastatic state, additional local therapies such as surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, and radiotherapy can lead to permanent local disease control and improve survival. Among these, an advance in radiation therapy made it possible to deliver high dose radiation to the tumor more accurately, without impairing the liver function. In recent years, the introduction of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has offered even more intensive tumor dose escalation in a few fractions with reduced dose to the adjacent normal liver. Many studies have shown that SABR for oligometastases is effective and safe, with local control rates widely ranging from 50% to 100% at one or two years. And actuarial survival at one and two years has been reported ranging from 72% to 94% and from 30% to 62%, respectively, without severe toxicities. In this paper, we described the definition and technical aspects of SABR, clinical outcomes including efficacy and toxicity, and related parameters after SABR in liver oligometastases from colorectal cancer.\n\nEF5 PET of Tumor Hypoxia: A Predictive Imaging Biomarker of Response to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) for Early Lung Cancer\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-09-01\n\nRadiotherapy ( SABR ) for Early Lung Cancer PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Billy W.

However, unlike traditional surgery the lung cancer remains in place after treatment. Thus, imaging follow-up for evaluation of recurrence is of paramount importance. In this retrospective designed Institutional Review Board-approved study, follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) exams were performed on sixty one patients to evaluate enhancement pattern in the ablation zone at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after SABR. Eleven patients had recurrence within the ablation zone after SABR. The postcontrast enhancement in the recurrence group showed a washin and washout phenomenon, whereas the radiation-induced lung injury group showed continuous enhancement suggesting an inflammatory process. The textural feature of the ablation zone of enhancement and perfusion as demonstrated in computed tomography nodule enhancement may allow early differentiation of recurrence from radiation-induced lung injury in patients' status after SABR or primary lung cancer.\n\nEF5 PET of Tumor Hypoxia: A Predictive Imaging Biomarker of Response to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) for Early Lung Cancer\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-09-01\n\nSABR ) for Early Lung Cancer PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Billy W.

However, even patients with solitary HCC are not always amenable to these treatments. The authors prospectively investigated the clinical outcomes of patients who received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for solitary HCC. A phase 2 study involving SBRT and optional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was conducted in patients with Child-Pugh grade A or B and underlying, solitary HCC (greatest tumor dimension, â¤4 cm) who were unsuitable candidates for resection and radiofrequency ablation. The prescription dose was 35 to 40 grays in 5 fractions. The primary endpoint was 3-year local tumor control. From 2007 to 2012, 101 patients were enrolled, and 90 were evaluable with a median follow-up of 41.7 months (range, 6.8-96.2 months). Thirty-two patients were treatment-naÃ¯ve, 20 were treated for newly diagnosed intrahepatic failure, and 38 were treated for residual or recurrent HCC as salvage therapy. Thirty-two patients did not receive TACE, 48 received insufficient TACE, and 10 attained full lipiodol accumulation. The 3-year local control rate was 96.3%, the 3-year liver-related cause-specific survival rate was 72.5%, and the overall survival rate was 66.7%. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities were observed in 6 patients, and 8 patients had Child-Pugh scores that worsened by 2 points. SBRT achieved high local control and overall survival with feasible toxicities for patients with solitary HCC, despite rather stringent conditions. SBRT can be effective against solitary HCC in treatment-naive, intrahepatic failure, residual disease, and recurrent settings, taking advantage of its distinctive characteristics.

However, there is little documentation detailing the radiobiological effects of hypofractionated radiation on healthy renal tissue. In this study we describe a methodology for assessment of regional change in renal function in response to single fraction SABR of 26 Gy. In a patient with a solitary kidney, detailed follow-up of kidney function post-treatment was determined through 3-dimensional SPECT/CT imaging and (51)Cr-EDTA measurements. Based on measurements of glomerular filtration rate, renal function declined rapidly by 34% at 3 months, plateaued at 43% loss at 12 months, with minimal further decrease to 49% of baseline by 18 months. The pattern of renal functional change in (99m)Tc-DMSA uptake on SPECT/CT imaging correlates with dose delivered. This study demonstrates a dose effect relationship of SABR with loss of kidney function.\n\nRecommendations for dose calculations of lung cancer treatment plans treated with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDevpura, S.; Siddiqui, M. S.; Chen, D.; Liu, D.; Li, H.; Kumar, S.; Gordon, J.; Ajlouni, M.; Movsas, B.; Chetty, I. J.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate dose distributions computed with 5 different dose algorithms for patients with lung cancers treated using stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR). Treatment plans for 133 lung cancer patients, initially computed with a 1D-pencil beam (equivalent-path-length, EPL-1D) algorithm, were recalculated with 4 other algorithms commissioned for treatment planning, including 3-D pencil-beam (EPL-3D), anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA), collapsed cone convolution superposition (CCC), and Monte Carlo (MC). The plan prescription dose was 48 Gy in 4 fractions normalized to the 95% isodose line. Tumors were classified according to location: peripheral tumors surrounded by lung (lung-island, N=39), peripheral tumors attached to the rib-cage or chest wall (lung-wall, N=44), and centrally-located tumors (lung-central, N=50). Relative to the EPL-1D algorithm, PTV D95 and mean dose values computed with the other 4 algorithms were lowest for \"lung-island\" tumors with smallest field sizes (3-5 cm). On the other hand, the smallest differences were noted for lung-central tumors treated with largest field widths (7-10 cm). Amongst all locations, dose distribution differences were most strongly correlated with tumor size for lung-island tumors. For most cases, convolution/superposition and MC algorithms were in good agreement. Mean lung dose (MLD) values computed with the EPL-1D algorithm were highly correlated with that of the other algorithms (correlation coefficient =0.99). The MLD values were found to be ~10% lower for small lung-island tumors with the model-based (conv/superposition and MC) vs. the correction-based (pencil-beam) algorithms with the model-based algorithms predicting greater low dose spread within the lungs. This study suggests that pencil beam algorithms should be avoided for lung SABR planning. For the most challenging cases, small tumors surrounded entirely by lung tissue (lung-island type), a Monte\n\nA national dosimetry audit for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in lung.\n\nPubMed\n\nDistefano, Gail; Lee, Jonny; Jafari, Shakardokht; Gouldstone, Clare; Baker, Colin; Mayles, Helen; Clark, Catharine H\n\n2017-03-01\n\nA UK national dosimetry audit was carried out to assess the accuracy of Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) lung treatment delivery. This mail-based audit used an anthropomorphic thorax phantom containing nine alanine pellets positioned in the lung region for dosimetry, as well as EBT3 film in the axial plane for isodose comparison. Centres used their local planning protocol/technique, creating 27 SABR plans. A range of delivery techniques including conformal, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and Cyberknife (CK) were used with six different calculation algorithms (collapsed cone, superposition, pencil-beam (PB), AAA, Acuros and Monte Carlo). The mean difference between measured and calculated dose (excluding PB results) was 0.4Â±1.4% for alanine and 1.4Â±3.4% for film. PB differences were -6.1% and -12.9% respectively. The median of the absolute maximum isodose-to-isodose distances was 3mm (-6mm to 7mm) and 5mm (-10mm to +19mm) for the 100% and 50% isodose lines respectively. Alanine and film is an effective combination for verifying dosimetric and geometric accuracy. There were some differences across dose algorithms, and geometric accuracy was better for VMAT and CK compared with conformal techniques. The alanine dosimetry results showed that planned and delivered doses were within Â±3.0% for 25/27 SABR plans. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Re-irradiation with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) represents an appealing approach, due to the optimized dose distribution that allows for high-dose delivery with better sparing of organs at risk. This strategy has the goal of long-term control and even cure. Aim of this review is to report and discuss published data on re-irradiation with SABR in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Results indicate that thoracic re-irradiation may offer satisfactory disease control, however the data on outcome and toxicity are derived from low quality retrospective studies, and results should be cautiously interpreted. As SABR may be associated with serious toxicity, attention should be paid for an accurate patients' selection. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Use of highly targeted, hypofractionated regimens of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is now a primary management option for patients with oligometastatic disease. The properties of SBRT are summarized and the results of retrospective and prospective studies of SBRT use in the management of oligometastases are reviewed. Future directions of SBRT, including optimizing dose and fractionation schedules, are also discussed. SBRT can deliver highly conformal, dosed radiation treatments for ablative tumors in a few treatment sessions. Phase 1/2 trials and retrospective institutional results support use of SBRT as a treatment option for oligometastatic disease metastasized to the lung, liver, and spine, and SBRT offers adequate toxicity profiles with good rates of local control. Future directions will involve optimizing dose and fractionation schedules for select histologies to improve rates of local control while limiting toxicity to normal structures. SBRT offers an excellent management option for patients with oligometastases. However, additional research is still needed to optimize dose and fractionation schedules.\n\nRib fracture following stereotactic body radiotherapy: a potential pitfall.\n\nPubMed\n\nStanic, Sinisa; Boike, Thomas P; Rule, William G; Timmerman, Robert D\n\n2011-11-01\n\nAlthough the incidence of rib fractures after conventional radiotherapy is generally low (<2%), rib fractures are a relatively common complication of stereotactic body radiotherapy. For malignancy adjacent to the chest wall, the incidence of rib fractures after stereotactic body radiotherapy is as high as 10%. Unrecognized bone fractures can mimic bone metastases on bone scintigraphy, can lead to extensive workup, and can even lead to consideration of unnecessary systemic chemotherapy, as treatment decisions can be based on imaging findings alone.

It is applied in the primary, neoadjuvant as well as the adjuvant setting. Radiation techniques have rapidly evolved during the past decade enabling the delivery of high radiation doses, reducing side-effects in tumour-adjacent normal tissues. While increasing local tumour control, current and future efforts ought to deal with microscopic disease at a distance of the primary tumour, ultimately responsible for disease-progression.

Methods: The study was performed in 21 lung cancer patients who underwent Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR). Two different methods (i) Same dose coverage to the target volume (named as same dose method) (ii) Same monitor units in all algorithms (named as same monitor units) were used for studying the performance of seven different dose calculation algorithms in XiO and Eclipse treatment planning systems. The seven dose calculation algorithms include Superposition, FastmoreÂ Â» superposition, Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT) Convolution, Clarkson, Anisotropic Analytic Algorithm (AAA), Acurous XB and pencil beam (PB) algorithms. Prior to this, a phantom study was performed to assess the accuracy of these algorithms. Superposition algorithm was used as a reference algorithm in this study. The treatment plans were compared using different dosimetric parameters including conformity, heterogeneity and dose fall off index. In addition to this, the dose to critical structures like lungs, heart, oesophagus and spinal cord were also studied. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software. Results: The meanÂ±stdev with conformity index for Superposition, Fast superposition, Clarkson and FFT convolution algorithms were 1.29Â±0.13, 1.31Â±0.16, 2.2Â±0.7 and 2.17Â±0.59 respectively whereas for AAA, pencil beam and Acurous XB were 1.4Â±0.27, 1.66Â±0.27 and 1.35Â±0.24 respectively. Conclusion: Our study showed significant variations among the seven different algorithms. Superposition and AcurosXB algorithms showed similar values for most of the dosimetric parameters. Clarkson, FFT convolution and pencil beam algorithms showed large differences as compared to superposition algorithms. Based on our study, we recommend Superposition and AcurosXB algorithms as the first choice\n\nStereotactic body radiotherapy in lung cancer: an update *\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbreu, Carlos Eduardo Cintra Vita; Ferreira, Paula Pratti Rodrigues; de Moraes, Fabio Ynoe; Neves, Wellington Furtado Pimenta; Gadia, Rafael; Carvalho, Heloisa de Andrade\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract For early-stage lung cancer, the treatment of choice is surgery.

This case study highlights the effect of a change in patient breathing amplitude on the dosimetry to organs at risk and target structures. A 73-year-old male patient was planned for receiving 26 Gy of radiation in 1 fraction of SABR for a left primary RCC. The patient was simulated with four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) and the tumor internal target volume (ITV) was delineated using the 4DCT maximum intensity projection. However, the initially planned treatment was abandoned at the radiation oncologist'smoreÂ Â» discretion after pretreatment cone-beam CT (CBCT) motion verification identified a greater than 50% reduction in superior to inferior diaphragm motion as compared with the planning 4DCT. This patient was resimulated with respiratory coaching instructions. To assess the effect of the change in breathing on the dosimetry to the target, each plan was recalculated on the data set representing the change in breathing condition. A change from smaller to larger breathing showed a 46% loss in planning target volume (PTV) coverage, whereas a change from larger breathing to smaller breathing resulted in an 8% decrease in PTV coverage. ITV coverage was similarly reduced by 8% in both scenarios. This case study highlights the importance of tools to verify breathing motion prior to treatment delivery. 4D image guided radiation therapy verification strategies should focus on not only verifying ITV margin coverage but also the effect on the surrounding organs at risk.Â«Â less\n\nForaging behaviour in Drosophila larvae: mushroom body ablation.\n\nPubMed\n\nOsborne, K A; de Belle, J S; Sokolowski, M B\n\n2001-02-01\n\nDrosophila larvae and adults exhibit a naturally occurring genetically based behavioural polymorphism in locomotor activity while foraging. Larvae of the rover morph exhibit longer foraging trails than sitters and forage between food patches, while sitters have shorter foraging trails and forage within patches. This behaviour is influenced by levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PGK) encoded by the foraging (for) gene. Rover larvae have higher expression levels and higher PGK activities than do sitters. Here we discuss the importance of the for gene for studies of the mechanistic and evolutionary significance of individual differences in behaviour. We also show how structure-function analysis can be used to investigate a role for mushroom bodies in larval behaviour both in the presence and in the absence of food. Hydroxyurea fed to newly hatched larvae prevents the development of all post-embryonically derived mushroom body (MB) neuropil. This method was used to ablate MBs in rover and sitter genetic variants of foraging to test whether these structures mediate expression of the foraging behavioural polymorphism. We found that locomotor activity levels during foraging of both the rover and sitter larval morphs were not significantly influenced by MB ablation. Alternative hypotheses that may explain how variation in foraging behaviour is generated are discussed.\n\n[(18)F]Choline PET/CT and stereotactic body radiotherapy on treatment decision making of oligometastatic prostate cancer patients: preliminary results.\n\nPubMed\n\nPasqualetti, Francesco; Panichi, Marco; Sainato, Aldo; Matteucci, Fabrizio; Galli, Luca; Cocuzza, Paola; Ferrazza, Patrizia; Coraggio, Gabriele; Pasqualetti, Giuseppe; Derosa, Lisa; Sollini, Martina; Mannelli, Lorenzo; Ortori, Simona; Monzani, Fabio; Ricci, Sergio; Greco, Carlo; Fabrini, Maria Grazia; Erba, Paola Anna\n\n2016-01-22\n\nA new entity of patients with recurrent prostate cancer limited to a small number of active metastatic lesions is having growing interest: the oligometastatic patients. Patients with oligometastatic disease could eventually be managed by treating all the active lesions with local therapy, i.e. either surgery or ablative stereotactic body radiotherapy. This study aims to assess the impact of [(18)F]Choline ([(18)F]FMCH) PET/CT and the use stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients (pts) with oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa). Twenty-nine pts with oligometastatic PCa (â¤3 synchronous active lesions detected with [(18)F]FMCHPET/CT) were treated with repeated salvage SBRT until disease progression (development of > three active synchronous metastases). Primary endpoint was systemic therapy-free survival measured from the baseline [(18)F]FMCHPET/CT. A total of 45 lesions were treated with SBRT. After a median follow-up of 11.5 months (range 3-40 months), 20 pts were still in the study and did not receive any systemic therapy. Nine pts started systemic therapy, and the median time of the primary endpoint was 39.7 months (CI 12.20-62.14 months). No grade 3 or 4 toxicity was recorded. Repeated salvage [(18)F]FMCHPET/CT-guided SBRT is well tolerated and could defer the beginning of systemic therapy in selected patients with oligometastatic PCa.\n\nEmbryonic ablation of neuronal VGF increases energy expenditure and reduces body weight\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJiang, Cheng; Lin, Wei-Jye; Sadahiro, Masato; Shin, Andrew C.; Buettner, Christoph; Salton, Stephen R.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nGermline ablation of VGF, a secreted neuronal, neuroendocrine, and endocrine peptide precursor, results in lean, hypermetabolic, and infertile adult mice that are resistant to diet-, lesion-, and genetically-induced obesity and diabetes (Hahm et al., 1999, 2002). To assess whether this phenotype is predominantly driven by reduced VGF expression in developing and/or adult neurons, or in peripheral endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues, we generated and analyzed conditional VGF knockout mice, obtained by mating loxP-flanked (floxed) Vgf mice with either pan-neuronal Synapsin-Cre- or forebrain alpha-CaMKII-Cre-recombinase-expressing transgenic mice. Adult male and female mice, with conditional ablation of the Vgf gene in embryonic neurons had significantly reduced body weight, increased energy expenditure, and were resistant to diet-induced obesity. Conditional forebrain postnatal ablation of VGF in male mice, primarily in adult excitatory neurons, had no measurable effect on body weight nor on energy expenditure, but led to a modest increase in adiposity, partially overlapping the effect of AAV-Cre-mediated targeted ablation of VGF in the adult ventromedial hypothalamus and arcuate nucleus of floxed Vgf mice (Foglesong et al., 2016), and also consistent with results of icv delivery of the VGF-derived peptide TLQP-21 to adult mice, which resulted in increased energy expenditure and reduced adiposity (Bartolomucci et al., 2006). Because the lean, hypermetabolic phenotype of germline VGF knockout mice is to a great extent recapitulated in Syn-Cre+/â,Vgfflpflox/flpflox mice, we conclude that the metabolic profile of germline VGF knockout mice is largely the result of VGF ablation in embryonic CNS neurons, rather than peripheral endocrine and/or neuroendocrine cells, and that in forebrain structures such as hypothalamus, VGF and/or VGF-derived peptides play uniquely different roles in the developing and adult nervous system.

S.; Kabana, W. P.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe ablation performance of materials composed of various concentrations of nylon, hollow silica spheres, hollow phenolic spheres, and four elastomeric resins was determined. Both blunt-body and flat-panel specimens were used, the cold-wall heating-rate ranges being 0.11 to 0.8 MW/sq m, respectively. The corresponding surface pressure ranges for these tests were 0.017 to 0.037 atmosphere and 0.004 to 0.005 atmosphere. Some of the results show that (1) the addition of nylon significantly improved the ablation performance, but the nylon was not compatible with one resin system; (2) panel and blunt-body specimen data do not show the same effect of phenolic sphere content on ablation effectiveness; and (3) there appears to be an optimum concentration of hollow silica spheres for good ablation performance. The composition of an efficient, nonproprietary ablator for lifting body application is identified and the ablation performance of this ablator is compared with the performance of three commercially available materials.\n\nEF5 PET of Tumor Hypoxia: A Predictive Imaging Biomarker of Response to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) for Early Lung Cancer\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-11-01\n\nSABR) for Early Lung Cancer PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Billy W Loo Jr, MD PhD CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION: The Leland Stanford Junior University...Response to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) for Early Lung Cancer 5b.

To introduce SBRT in a system of coverage with evidence development, a correct financing had to be determined. A time-driven activity-based costing model for radiotherapy was developed. Resource cost calculation of all radiotherapy treatments, standard and innovative, was conducted in 10 Belgian radiotherapy centers in the second half of 2012. The average cost of lung SBRT across the 10 centers (6221&OV0556;) is in the range of the average costs of standard fractionated 3D-conformal radiotherapy (5919&OV0556;) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (7379&OV0556;) for lung cancer. Hypofractionated 3D-conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy schemes are less costly (3993&OV0556; respectively 4730&OV0556;). The SBRT cost increases with the number of fractions and is highly dependent of personnel and equipment use. SBRT cost varies more by centre than conventional radiotherapy cost, reflecting different technologies, stages in the learning curve and a lack of clear guidance in this field. Time-driven activity-based costing of radiotherapy is feasible in a multicentre setup, resulting in real-life resource costs that can form the basis for correct reimbursement schemes, supporting an early yet controlled introduction of innovative radiotherapy techniques in clinical practice.\n\nInfluence of ablation impurities on blunt body re-entry ionization\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchexnayder, C. J., Jr.; Evans, J. S.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nElectron density profiles which include the effect of an ablated sodium impurity were computed for the boundary layer on a blunt-nosed body re-entering the atmosphere at 7.62 km/sec. Profiles are computed from the nose to a distance of four diameters along the RAM C-payload. A finite-difference, laminar, nonequilibrium chemistry boundary-layer program was used. Comparison of theory with S-band diagnostic antenna results, electron concentration deduced from X- and C-band attenuation data, and Langmuir probe data at several different aft body locations show that agreement is good at high altitude. At the lower altitudes there is disagreement between theory and S-band antenna data where the apparent discrepancy is attributed to the three-body recombination rate constant used for deionization of sodium coupled with the effect of angle of attack.\n\nA Phase 1 Trial of an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor plus Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in Patients with Inoperable Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-10-01\n\nwith Inoperable Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Karen Kelly, MD CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION: University of California...Inhibitor plus Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in Patients with Inoperable Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 5b.

A systematic search strategy was adopted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. 195 articles were identified, of which 17 were appropriate for inclusion. Studies were small and data largely retrospective. In total, 205 patients are reported to have received pelvic SABR re-irradiation. Dose and fractionation schedules and re-irradiated volumes are highly variable. Little information is provided regarding organ at risk constraints adopted in the re-irradiation setting. Treatment appears well-tolerated overall, with nine grade 3 and six grade 4 toxicities amongst thirteen re-irradiated patients. Local control at one year ranged from 51% to 100%. Symptomatic improvements were also noted. For previously irradiated patients with recurrent pelvic disease, SABR re-irradiation could be a feasible intervention for those who otherwise have limited options. Evidence to support this technique is limited but shows initial promise. Based on the available literature, suggestions for a more formal SABR re-irradiation pathway are proposed. Prospective studies and a multidisciplinary approach are required to optimise future treatment. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Treatment for bone metastases has been largely conservative, and it includes the use of high doses of analgesics, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and bisphosphonates; however, results are sometimes transient and ineffective. In the presence of neurological involvement a surgical strategy should be considered. Recently, percutaneous procedures such as radiofrequency ablation, vertebroplasty, and kyphoplasty have been introduced as palliative techniques to treat painful vertebral metastases [3, 11, 25]. In our study we combined the use of radiofrequency ablation with vertebroplasty in the treatment of dorsolumbar metastatic vertebral fractures in order to examine the relationship between restoration of the vertebral structure and decrease in pain. From January 2014 to March 2015 we retrospectively analyzed 18 patients with malignant vertebral lesions who underwent radiofrequency ablation with vertebroplasty followed by cementoplasty, with posterior transpedicle fixation on levels near the lesions. The parameters examined were: demographics, pain relief, and the distribution of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) determined by the mean Saliou filling score; all complications were recorded. The mean age of the patients was 55.72 years (range 34-69); average operative time was 60.4 min (range, 51-72). The average pain index score (visual analog score; VAS) decreased significantly from 8.05 at baseline to 3.0 (p < 0.05) after 6 months. The Saliou filling score revealed a distribution of PMMA in the vertebral body that was satisfactory (12-18) in eight patients, mediocre (6-12) in seven patients, and inadequate (0-6) in the remaining three patients. In two vertebrae, minimal asymptomatic cement leakage occurred in the lateral recess without neurological damage. No pulmonary embolism and no visceral or neural damage was recorded. Radiofrequency ablation combined with vertebroplasty seems to\n\nLong-term influence of body mass index on cardiovascular events after atrial fibrillation ablation.\n\nPubMed\n\nBunch, T Jared; May, Heidi T; Bair, Tami L; Crandall, Brian G; Cutler, Michael J; Jacobs, Victoria; Mallender, Charles; Muhlestein, Joseph B; Osborn, Jeffrey S; Weiss, J Peter; Day, John D\n\n2016-09-01\n\nCatheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is an established therapeutic rhythm approach in symptomatic patients. Obesity is a dominant driver of AF recurrence after ablation. However, being both overweight and underweight drives long-term cardiac and general health risks. Long-term data are needed to understand the influence of body mass index (BMI) on outcomes after ablation in regard to arrhythmia recurrence and cardiovascular outcomes. All patients who underwent an index ablation with a BMI recorded and at least 3Â years of follow-up were included (nâ=â1558). The group was separated and compared by index ablation BMI status (â¤20, 21-25, 26-30, >30Â kg/m(2)). Long-term outcomes included AF recurrence, stroke/TIA, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and death. Patients with advancing BMI status were more likely to be male and have hypertension, a smoking history, diabetes, HF, and a prior cardioversion. Patients with a BMI â¤20 were more likely to have a moderate-high congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75, diabetes, stroke (CHADS2) score. At 3Â years, recurrence rates of AF increased significantly with increasing BMI status (pâ=â0.02); paradoxically, there was a trend for increased stroke risk with decreasing BMI (pâ=â0.06). Long-term death rates tended to increase inversely with BMI status, and HF rates were greatest in the highest and lowest BMI groups. Lower weight at AF ablation lowers arrhythmia recurrence risk. However, AF ablation patients who are normal or underweight remain at high risk of other cardiovascular outcomes including increased stroke risk with less AF burden.\n\nBiodosimetry Based on Î³-H2AX Quantification and Cytogenetics after Partial- and Total-Body Irradiation during Fractionated Radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nZahnreich, Sebastian; Ebersberger, Anne; Kaina, Bernd; Schmidberger, Heinz\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe aim of this current study was to quantitatively describe radiation-induced DNA damage and its distribution in leukocytes of cancer patients after fractionated partial- or total-body radiotherapy. Specifically, the impact of exposed anatomic region and administered dose was investigated in breast and prostate cancer patients receiving partial-body radiotherapy. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were quantified by Î³-H2AX immunostaining. The frequency of unstable chromosomal aberrations in stimulated lymphocytes was also determined and compared with the frequency of DNA DSBs in the same samples. The frequency of radiation-induced DNA damage was converted into dose, using ex vivo generated calibration curves, and was then compared with the administered physical dose. This study showed that 0.5 h after partial-body radiotherapy the quantity of radiation-induced Î³-H2AX foci increased linearly with the administered equivalent whole-body dose for both tumor entities. Foci frequencies dropped 1 day thereafter but proportionality to the equivalent whole-body dose was maintained. Conversely, the frequency of radiation-induced cytogenetic damage increased from 0.5 h to 1 day after the first partial-body exposure with a linear dependence on the administered equivalent whole-body dose, for prostate cancer patients only. Only Î³-H2AX foci assessment immediately after partial-body radiotherapy was a reliable measure of the expected equivalent whole-body dose. Local tumor doses could be approximated with both assays after one day. After total-body radiotherapy satisfactory dose estimates were achieved with both assays up to 8 h after exposure. In conclusion, the quantification of radiation-induced Î³-H2AX foci, but not cytogenetic damage in peripheral leukocytes was a sensitive and rapid biodosimeter after acute heterogeneous irradiation of partial body volumes that was able to primarily assess the absorbed equivalent whole-body dose.\n\nStereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for stage I histologically proven non-small cell lung cancer: an Italian multicenter observational study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRicardi, Umberto; Frezza, Giovanni; Filippi, Andrea Riccardo; Badellino, Serena; Levis, Mario; Navarria, Piera; Salvi, Fabrizio; Marcenaro, Michela; TrovÃ², Marco; Guarneri, Alessia; CorvÃ², Renzo; Scorsetti, Marta\n\n2014-06-01\n\nAim of this retrospective multicenter observational study was to provide data on outcomes and prognostic factors in patients affected with stage I histologically confirmed NSCLC treated with Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR, or Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy, SBRT) outside clinical trials. We analyzed a cohort of 196 patients with histological/cytological diagnosis of NSCLC. Median age at treatment was 75 years old; median tumor diameter was 2.48 cm, and median GTV 13.3 cc. One hundred fifty-five patients had stage IA disease (79.1%) and 41 patients stage IB disease (20.9%). Total doses ranged from 48 to 60 Gy in 3-8 fractions. Primary endpoints of the study were safety (acute and late toxicity) and efficacy (Local Control, Disease-Free Survival, Overall and Cancer-Specific Survival). Median follow-up time was 30 months. The percentage of grade â¥2 pulmonary toxicity was 3%, and the 30 and 60 days mortality rate was 0%. Local Recurrence-Free Survival was 89.7% at 3 years. Fifty-nine patients (30.1%) had at least one failure (local and/or nodal and/or distant), with a Disease-Free Survival (DFS) rate at 3 years of 65.5%. Overall Survival (OS) and Cancer-Specific Survival (CSS) rates were 68% and 82.1% at 3 years, respectively. Median time to any recurrence was 15 months, while median overall survival time was 54 months. At multivariate analysis, stage IB was the only variable associated to a decrease in DFS, OS and CSS (HR 2.77, p = 0.006; HR 2.38, p = 0.009; HR 4.06, p â¤ 0.001, respectively). A difference in survival according to stage was also evident at the log-rank test (p â¤ 0.0001 for CSS and OS). The results of the present study support the routine use of SABR for stage I NSCLC in a daily practice environment. The only prognostic factor that has been confirmed by our analysis was tumor stage (IA vs. IB). Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We assessed whether sex, age, weight, and previous radiotherapy influence dosing of pegvisomant in patients with active disease. Data from 69 men and 49 women participating in multicenter, open-label trials of pegvisomant were retrospectively evaluated using multiple regression techniques. Sixty-nine subjects (39 men, 30 women) had undergone external beam pituitary radiotherapy. Serum IGF-I was at least 30% above age-related upper limit of normal in all patients at study entry. After a loading dose of pegvisomant (80 mg), patients were commenced on 10 mg/d. Pegvisomant dose was adjusted by 5 mg every eighth week until serum IGF-I was normalized. At baseline, men had significantly higher mean serum IGF-I levels than women despite similar GH levels. After treatment with pegvisomant, IGF-I levels were similar in men and women. A significant correlation between baseline GH, IGF-I, body weight, and the dose of pegvisomant required to normalize serum IGF-I was observed (all P < 0.001). Women required an average of 0.04 mg/kg more pegvisomant than men and a mean weight-corrected dose of 19.2 mg/d to normalize serum IGF-I [14.5 mg/d (men); P < 0.001]. Patients treated with radiotherapy required less pegvisomant to normalize serum IGF-I despite similar baseline GH/IGF-I levels (15.2 vs. 18.5 mg/d for no previous radiotherapy; P = 0.002). Sex, body weight, previous radiotherapy, and baseline GH/IGF-I influence the dose of pegvisomant required to normalize serum IGF-I in patients with active acromegaly.\n\nSpine Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy: Indications, Outcomes, and Points of Caution\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEppinga, Wietse; Charest-Morin, Raphaele; Soliman, Hany; Myrehaug, Sten; Maralani, Pejman Jabehdar; Campbell, Mikki; Lee, Young K.; Fisher, Charles; Fehlings, Michael G.; Chang, Eric L.; Lo, Simon S.; Sahgal, Arjun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nStudy Design: A broad narrative review. Objectives: The objective of this article is to provide a technical review of spine stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) planning and delivery, indications for treatment, outcomes, complications, and the challenges of response assessment. The surgical approach to spinal metastases is discussed with an overview of emerging minimally invasive techniques. Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted on the techniques, outcomes, and developments in SBRT and surgery for spinal metastases. Results: The optimal management of patients with spinal metastases is complex and requires multidisciplinary assessment from an oncologic team that is familiar with the shifting paradigm as a consequence of evolving techniques in surgery and stereotactic radiation, as well as new developments in systemic agents. The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score and the epidural spinal cord compression (Bilsky) grading system are useful tools that facilitate communication among oncologic team members and can direct management by providing a baseline assessment of risks prior to therapy. The combined multimodality approach with âseparation surgeryâ followed by postoperative spine SBRT achieves thecal sac decompression, improves tumor control, and avoids complications that may be associated with more extensive surgery. Conclusion: Spine SBRT is a highly effective treatment that is capable of delivering ablative doses to the target while sparing the critical organs-at-risk, chiefly the critical neural tissues, within a short and manageable schedule. At the same time, surgery occupies an important role in select patients, particularly with the expanding availability and expertise in minimally invasive techniques. With rapid adoption of spine SBRT in centers outside of the academic setting, it is imperative for the practicing oncologist to understand the relevance and application of these evolving concepts.

Ph.D. Thesis - North Carolina State Univ.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSutton, K.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nA computational method was developed for the fully-coupled solution of nongray, radiating gas flows with ablation product effects about blunt bodies during planetary entries. The treatment of radiation accounts for molecular band, continuum, and atomic line transitions with a detailed frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient. The ablation of the entry body was solved as part of the solution for a steady-state ablation process. The method was applied by results at typical conditions during entry to Venus. The radiative heating rates along the downstream region of the body can exceed the stagnation point value. The radiative heating to the body is attenuated in the boundary layer at the downstream region of the body and at the stagnation point of the body. A study of the radiation, inviscid flow about spherically capped, conical bodies during planetary entries shows that the nondimensional, radiative heating distributions are nonsimilar with entry conditions. Caution should be exercised in attempting to extrapolate results from known distributions to other entry conditions for which solutions have not yet been obtained.\n\nMathematical modelling of tumour volume dynamics in response to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTariq, Imran; Humbert-Vidan, Laia; Chen, Tao; South, Christopher P.; Ezhil, Veni; Kirkby, Norman F.; Jena, Rajesh; Nisbet, Andrew\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThis paper reports a modelling study of tumour volume dynamics in response to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). The main objective was to develop a model that is adequate to describe tumour volume change measured during SABR, and at the same time is not excessively complex as lacking support from clinical data. To this end, various modelling options were explored, and a rigorous statistical method, the Akaike information criterion, was used to help determine a trade-off between model accuracy and complexity. The models were calibrated to the data from 11 non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with SABR. The results showed that it is feasible to model the tumour volume dynamics during SABR, opening up the potential for using such models in a clinical environment in the future.\n\nRadiation-induced second primary cancer risks from modern external beam radiotherapy for early prostate cancer: impact of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and flattening filter free (FFF) radiotherapy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMurray, Louise J.; Thompson, Christopher M.; Lilley, John; Cosgrove, Vivian; Franks, Kevin; Sebag-Montefiore, David; Henry, Ann M.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nRisks of radiation-induced second primary cancer following prostate radiotherapy using 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), flattening filter free (FFF) and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) were evaluated. Prostate plans were created using 10âMV 3D-CRT (78âGy in 39 fractions) and 6âMV 5-field IMRT (78âGy in 39 fractions), VMAT (78âGy in 39 fractions, with standard flattened and energy-matched FFF beams) and SABR (42.7âGy in 7 fractions with standard flattened and energy-matched FFF beams). Dose-volume histograms from pelvic planning CT scans of three prostate patients, each planned using all 6 techniques, were used to calculate organ equivalent doses (OED) and excess absolute risks (EAR) of second rectal and bladder cancers, and pelvic bone and soft tissue sarcomas, using mechanistic, bell-shaped and plateau models. For organs distant to the treatment field, chamber measurements recorded in an anthropomorphic phantom were used to calculate OEDs and EARs using a linear model. Ratios of OED give relative radiation-induced second cancer risks. SABR resulted in lower second cancer risks at all sites relative to 3D-CRT. FFF resulted in lower second cancer risks in out-of-field tissues relative to equivalent flattened techniques, with increasing impact in organs at greater distances from the field. For example, FFF reduced second cancer risk by up to 20% in the stomach and up to 56% in the brain, relative to the equivalent flattened technique. Relative to 10âMV 3D-CRT, 6âMV IMRT or VMAT with flattening filter increased second cancer risks in several out-of-field organs, by up to 26% and 55%, respectively. For all techniques, EARs were consistently low. The observed large relative differences between techniques, in absolute terms, were very low, highlighting the importance of considering absolute risks alongside the corresponding relative risks, since when absolute\n\nPercutaneous ablation of pancreatic cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDâOnofrio, Mirko; Ciaravino, Valentina; De Robertis, Riccardo; Barbi, Emilio; Salvia, Roberto; Girelli, Roberto; Paiella, Salvatore; Gasparini, Camilla; Cardobi, NicolÃ²; Bassi, Claudio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a highly aggressive tumor with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Prognosis and treatment depend on whether the tumor is resectable or not, which mostly depends on how quickly the diagnosis is made. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be both used in cases of non-resectable pancreatic cancer. In cases of pancreatic neoplasm that is locally advanced, non-resectable, but non-metastatic, it is possible to apply percutaneous treatments that are able to induce tumor cytoreduction. The aim of this article will be to describe the multiple currently available treatment techniques (radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation), their results, and their possible complications, with the aid of a literature review.

The question addressed was 'Is stereotactic ablative radiotherapy equivalent to sublobar resection in high-risk surgical patients with Stage I non-small cell lung cancer?'. Altogether over 318 papers were found, of which 18 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and sublobar resection (SLR) offer clear survival benefit in the treatment of early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in high-risk patients unsuitable for lobectomy and SABR has shown good results in medically operable patients. No randomized data are available comparing SLR and SABR, and therefore, data from prospective studies were compared. Overall survival at 1 year was similar between patients treated with SABR and SLR (81-85.7 vs 92%); however, overall 3-year survival was higher following SLR (87.1 vs 45.1-57.1%). There was no statistically significant difference in local recurrence in patients treated with SABR compared with SLR (3.5-14.5 vs 4.8-20%). Both treatment modalities are associated with complications. Fatigue (31-32.6%), pneumonitis (2.1-12.5%) and chest wall pain (3.1-12%) were common following SABR; however, serious grade 3 and 4 toxicity were rare. Morbidity following SLR was reported between 7.3 and 33.7%. Thirty-day mortality following SABR was 0%, while predicted 30-day mortality following a lung resection, using the thoracoscore predictive model ranges between 1 and 2.6%. Treatment for early-stage NSCLC should be tailored to individual patients. SABR is an acceptable alternative to SLR in high-risk patients but comparative data are required.\n\n[Percutaneous lung thermo-ablation].\n\nPubMed\n\nPalussiÃ¨re, Jean; Catena, Vittorio; Gaubert, Jean-Yves; Buy, Xavier; de Baere, Thierry\n\n2017-05-01\n\nPercutaneous lung thermo-ablation has steadily been developed over the past 15years. Main indications are early stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) for non-surgical patients and slow evolving localized metastatic disease, either spontaneous or following a general treatment. Radiofrequency, being the most evaluated technique, offers a local control rate of about 80-90% for tumors <3Â cm in diameter. With excellent tolerance and very few complications, radiofrequency may be proposed for patients with a chronic disease. Other ablation techniques under investigation such as microwaves and cryotherapy could allow overcoming radiofrequency limits. Furthermore, stereotactic radiotherapy proposed for the same indications is efficient. Comparative studies are warranted to differentiate these techniques in terms of efficacy, tolerance and cost-effectiveness. Copyright Â© 2017 SociÃ©tÃ© FranÃ§aise du Cancer.

As described elsewhere, they have been recently undergoing initial technical readiness (TRL) advancement by NASA. The performance limits of flexible ablators in terms of maximum heat rates, pressure and shear remain to be defined. Further, it is hoped that this emerging technology will vastly expand the capability of future NASA missions involving atmospheric entry systems. This paper considers four topics of relevance to flexible ablators: (1) Their potential applications to near/far term human and robotic missions (2) Brief consideration of the balance between heat shield diameter, flexible ablator performance limits, entry vehicle controllability and aft-body shear layer impingement of interest to designers of very large entry vehicles, (3) The approach for developing bonding processes of flexible ablators for use on rigid entry bodies and (4) Design of large arcjet test articles that will enable the testing of flexible ablators in flight-like, combined environments (heat flux, pressure, shear and structural tensile loading). Based on a review of thermal protection system performance requirements for future entry vehicles, it is concluded that flexible ablators have broad applications to conventional, rigid entry body systems and are enabling to large deployable (both inflatable and mechanical) heat shields. Because of the game-changing nature of flexible ablators, it appears that NASA's Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) will fund a focused, 3-year TRL advancement of the new materials capable of performance in heat fluxes in the range of 200-600 W/sq. cm. This support will enable the manufacture and use of the large-scale arcjet test designs that will be a key element of this OCT funded activity.\n\nStereotactic ablative radiotherapy: a potentially curable approach to early stage multiple primary lung cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Joe Y; Liu, Yung-Hsien; Zhu, Zhengfei; Welsh, James W; Gomez, Daniel R; Komaki, Ritsuko; Roth, Jack A; Swisher, Stephen G\n\n2013-09-15\n\nSurgical resection has been the standard treatment for early stage multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC). However, a significant proportion of patients with MPLC cannot undergo surgery. For this report, the authors explored the role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for patients with MPLC. Patients with MPLC who received SABR (50 grays [Gy] in 4 fractions or 70 Gy in 10 fractions) for the second tumor were reviewed. Four-dimensional, computed tomography-based, planning/volumetric image-guided treatment was used for all patients. Treatment outcomes/toxicities were analyzed. For the 101 patients who received SABR, at a median follow-up of 36 months and with a median overall survival (OS) of 46 months, the 2-year and 4-year in-field local control rates were 97.4% and 95.7%, respectively. The 2-year and 4-year OS rates were 73.2% and 47.5%, respectively; and the progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 67% and 58%, respectively. Patients who had metachronous tumors had better OS and PFS than patients who had synchronous tumors (2-year OS: 80.6% metachronous vs 61.5% synchronous; 4-year OS: 52.7% vs 39.7%, respectively; P =â.047; 2-year PFS: 84.7% vs 49.4%, respectively; 4-year PFS: 75.6% vs 30.4%, respectively; P =â.0001). For patients who either underwent surgery or received SABR for an index tumor, the incidence of grade â¥ 3 radiation pneumonitis was 3% (2 of 71 patients); however, this increased to 17% (5 of 30 patients) for those who received conventional radiotherapy for an index tumor. Other grade â¥ 3 toxicities included grade 3 chest wall pain (3 of 101 patients; 3%) and grade 3 skin toxicity (1 of 101 patients; 1%). SABR achieves promising long-term tumor control and survival and may be a potential curative treatment for early stage MPLC.

Avraham; Vadas, Timothy M.; Smilowitz, Henry M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGold nanoparticles can absorb near infrared light, resulting in heating and ablation of tumors. Gold nanoparticles have also been used for enhancing the dose of X-rays in tumors during radiotherapy. The combination of hyperthermia and radiotherapy is synergistic, importantly allowing a reduction in X-ray dose with improved therapeutic results. Here we intratumorally infused small 15 nm gold nanoparticles engineered to be transformed from infrared-transparent to infrared-absorptive by the tumor, which were then heated by infrared followed by X-ray treatment. Synergy was studied using a very radioresistant subcutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) in mice. It was found that the dose required to control 50% of the tumors, normally 55 Gy, could be reduced to <15 Gy (a factor of >3.7). Gold nanoparticles therefore provide a method to combine hyperthermia and radiotherapy to drastically reduce the X-ray radiation needed, thus sparing normal tissue, reducing the side effects, and making radiotherapy more effective.

We tested whether autonomic alterations, arrhythmogenesis, and the progression of hypertension induced by CIH depend on the enhanced CB chemosensory drive, by ablation of the CB chemoreceptors. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to control (Sham) conditions for 7 days and then to CIH (5% O2, 12/h 8 h/d) for a total of 28 days. At 21 days of CIH exposure, rats underwent bilateral CB ablation and then exposed to CIH for 7 additional days. Arterial blood pressure and ventilatory chemoreflex response to hypoxia were measured in conscious rats. In addition, cardiac autonomic imbalance, cardiac baroreflex gain, and arrhythmia score were assessed during the length of the experiments. In separate experimental series, we measured extracellular matrix remodeling content in cardiac atrial tissue and systemic oxidative stress. CIH induced hypertension, enhanced ventilatory response to hypoxia, induced autonomic imbalance toward sympathetic preponderance, reduced baroreflex gain, and increased arrhythmias and atrial fibrosis. CB ablation normalized blood pressure, reduced ventilatory response to hypoxia, and restored cardiac autonomic and baroreflex function. In addition, CB ablation reduced the number of arrhythmias, but not extracellular matrix remodeling or systemic oxidative stress, suggesting that reductions in arrhythmia incidence during CIH were related to normalization of cardiac autonomic balance. Present results show that autonomic alterations induced by CIH are critically dependent on the CB and support a main role for the CB in the CIH-induced hypertension.

Since relatively few high-dose ablative fractions are delivered to a small target volume, the consequences of a geometric miss are potentially severe. This paper presents the results of treatment delivery set-up data collected using Elekta Synergy (Elekta, Crawley, UK) cone-beam CT imaging for 17 patients immobilised using the Bodyfix system (Medical Intelligence, Schwabmuenchen, Germany). Images were acquired on the linear accelerator at initial patient treatment set-up, following any position correction adjustments, and post-treatment. These were matched to the localisation CT scan using the Elekta XVI software. In total, 71 fractions were analysed for patient set-up errors. The mean vector error at initial set-up was calculated as 5.3Â±2.7 mm, which was significantly reduced to 1.4Â±0.7 mm following image guided correction. Post-treatment the corresponding value was 2.1Â±1.2 mm. The use of the Bodyfix abdominal compression plate on 5 patients to reduce the range of tumour excursion during respiration produced mean longitudinal set-up corrections of â4.4Â±4.5 mm compared with â0.7Â±2.6 mm without compression for the remaining 12 patients. The use of abdominal compression led to a greater variation in set-up errors and a shift in the mean value.

With evidence that NSCLC can have a dose dependent response with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), we hypothesize that a SABR boost on residual tumor treated with chemoradiotherapy could increase treatment efficacy. The purpose of this study was to determine feasibility of such an approach. A prospective phase I trial was performed including 26 patients. Time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) was used for dose escalation which ranged from 3â¯Ãâ¯7 to 3â¯Ãâ¯12â¯Gy for the stereotactic boost, after 46â¯Gy (2â¯Gy per day) of chemoradiotherapy. Median follow-up was of 37.1â¯months (1.7-60.7), and 3, 4, 3, 3, 9 and 4 patients were included at the dose levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. During chemoradiotherapy, 9 patients experienced grade 3 toxicity. After stereotactic radiotherapy, 1 patient experienced an esophageal fistula (with local relapse) at the 3â¯Ãâ¯11â¯Gy level, and 1 patient died from hemoptysis at the 3â¯Ãâ¯12â¯Gy level. The 2-year rate of local control, locoregional free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival was 70.3%, 55.5%, 44.5% and 50.8%, respectively. In the treatment of NSCLC with chemoradiotherapy followed by a stereotactic boost, the safe recommended dose in our protocol was a boost dose of 3â¯Ãâ¯11â¯Gy. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A significant limitation of radiotherapy is its relatively low therapeutic index, defined as the maximum radiation dose that causes acceptable normal tissue damage to the minimum dose required to achieve tumor control. Recently, a new radiotherapy modality using synchrotron-generated X-ray microbeam radiotherapy has been demonstrated in animal models to ablate tumors with concurrent sparing of normal tissue. Very little work has been undertaken into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that differentiate microbeam radiotherapy from broad beam. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the whole genome transcriptional response of in vivo microbeam radiotherapy versus broad beam irradiated tumors. We hypothesized that gene expression changes after microbeam radiotherapy are different from those seen after broad beam. We found that in EMT6.5 tumors at 4-48 h postirradiation, microbeam radiotherapy differentially regulates a number of genes, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen gene family members, and other immunity-related genes including Ciita, Ifng, Cxcl1, Cxcl9, Indo and Ubd when compared to broad beam. Our findings demonstrate molecular differences in the tumor response to microbeam versus broad beam irradiation and these differences provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of microbeam radiotherapy and broad beam.\n\nSingle-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy for spinal metastases from renal cell carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nBalagamwala, Ehsan H; Angelov, Lilyana; Koyfman, Shlomo A; Suh, John H; Reddy, Chandana A; Djemil, Toufik; Hunter, Grant K; Xia, Ping; Chao, Samuel T\n\n2012-12-01\n\nStereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as an important treatment option for spinal metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as a means to overcome RCC's inherent radioresistance. The authors reviewed the outcomes of SBRT for the treatment of RCC metastases to the spine at their institution, and they identified factors associated with treatment failure. Fifty-seven patients (88 treatment sites) with RCC metastases to the spine received single-fraction SBRT. Pain relief was based on the Brief Pain Inventory and was adjusted for narcotic use according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 0631. Toxicity was scored according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Radiographic failure was defined as infield or adjacent (within 1 vertebral body [VB]) failure on follow-up MRI. Multivariate analyses were performed to correlate outcomes with the following variables: epidural, paraspinal, single-level, or multilevel disease (2-5 sites); neural foramen involvement; and VB fracture prior to SBRT. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used for statistical analysis. The median follow-up and survival periods were 5.4 months (range 0.3-38 months) and 8.3 months (range 1.5-38 months), respectively. The median time to radiographic failure and unadjusted pain progression were 26.5 and 26.0 months, respectively. The median time to pain relief (from date of simulation) and duration of pain relief (from date of treatment) were 0.9 months (range 0.1-4.4 months) and 5.4 months (range 0.1-37.4 months), respectively. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that multilevel disease (hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, p = 0.02) and neural foramen involvement (HR 3.4, p = 0.02) were correlated with radiographic failure; multilevel disease (HR 2.3, p = 0.056) and VB fracture (HR 2.4, p = 0.046) were correlated with unadjusted pain progression. One patient experienced Grade 3 nausea and vomiting; no other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed\n\nTumor abolition and antitumor immunostimulation by physico-chemical tumorÂ ablation.\n\nPubMed\n\nKeisari, Yona\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTumor ablation by thermal, chemical and radiological sources has received substantial attention for the treatment of many localized malignancies. The primary goal of most ablation procedures is to eradicate all viable malignant cells within a designated target volume through the application of energy or chemicals. Methods such as radiotherapy, chemical and biological ablation, photodynamic therapy, cryoablation, high-temperature ablation (radiofrequency, microwave, laser, and ultrasound), and electric-based ablation have been developed for focal malignancies. In recent years a large volume of data emerged on the effect of in situ tumor destruction (ablation) on inflammatory and immune components resulting in systemic anti-tumor reactions. It is evident that in situ tumor ablation can involve tumor antigen release, cross presentation and the release of DAMPS and make the tumor its own cellular vaccine. Tumor tissue destruction by in situ ablation may stimulate antigen-specific cellular immunity engendered by an inflammatory milieu. Dendritic cells (DCs) attracted to this microenvironment, will undergo maturation after internalizing cellular debris containing tumor antigens and will be exposed to damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Mature DCs can mediate antigen-specific cellular immunity via presentation of processed antigens to T cells. The immunomodulatory properties, exhibited by in situ ablation could portend a future collaboration with immunotherapeutic measures. In this review are summarized and discuss the preclinical and clinical studies pertinent to the phenomena of stimulation of specific anti-tumor immunity by various ablation modalities and the immunology related measures used to boost this response.\n\nSalvage Reirradiaton With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Locally Recurrent Head-and-Neck Tumors\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCengiz, Mustafa, E-mail: mcengiz@hacettepe.edu.tr; Ozyigit, Goekhan; Yazici, Goezde\n\n2011-09-01\n\nPurpose: In this study, we present our results of reirradiation of locally recurrent head-and-neck cancer with image-guided, fractionated, frameless stereotactic body radiotherapy technique. Methods and Materials: From July 2007 to February 2009, 46 patients were treated using the CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA) at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. All patients had recurrent, unresectable, and previously irradiated head-and-neck cancer. The most prominent site was the nasopharynx (32.6%), and the most common histopathology was epidermoid carcinoma. The planning target volume was defined as the gross tumor volume identified on magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. There were 22moreÂ Â» female and 24 male patients. Median age was 53 years (range, 19-87 years). The median tumor dose with stereotactic body radiotherapy was 30 Gy (range, 18-35 Gy) in a median of five (range, one to five) fractions. Results: Of 37 patients whose response to therapy was evaluated, 10 patients (27%) had complete tumor regression, 11 (29.8%) had partial response, and 10 (27%) had stable disease. Ultimate local disease control was achieved in 31 patients (83.8%). The overall survival was 11.93 months in median (ranged, 11.4 - 17.4 months), and the median progression free survival was 10.5 months. One-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 41% and 46%, respectively. Grade II or greater long-term complications were observed in 6 (13.3%) patients. On follow-up, 8 (17.3%) patients had carotid blow-out syndrome, and 7 (15.2%) patients died of bleeding from carotid arteries. We discovered that this fatal syndrome occurred only in patients with tumor surrounding carotid arteries and carotid arteries receiving all prescribed dose. Conclusions: Stereotactic body radiotherapy is an appealing treatment option for patients with recurrent head-and-neck cancer previously treated with radiation to high doses.

L.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe influence of ablation on the aerodynamic characteristics of a blunted slender cone was investigated. Plastic models were launched in free flight at ablating conditions. The results were compared with results of similar tests using metal nonablating models. Ablation was found to decrease the dynamic stability and the drag, but had little effect on static stability and lift. The plastic models appeared to experience ablation-induced roll.\n\nA multicentre 'end to end' dosimetry audit of motion management (4DCT-defined motion envelope) in radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nPalmer, Antony L; Nash, David; Kearton, John R; Jafari, Shakardokht M; Muscat, Sarah\n\n2017-12-01\n\nExternal dosimetry audit is valuable for the assurance of radiotherapy quality. However, motion management has not been rigorously audited, despite its complexity and importance for accuracy. We describe the first end-to-end dosimetry audit for non-SABR (stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy) lung treatments, measuring dose accumulation in a moving target, and assessing adequacy of target dose coverage. A respiratory motion lung-phantom with custom-designed insert was used. Dose was measured with radiochromic film, employing triple-channel dosimetry and uncertainty reduction. The host's 4DCT scan, outlining and planning techniques were used. Measurements with the phantom static and then moving at treatment delivery separated inherent treatment uncertainties from motion effects. Calculated and measured dose distributions were compared by isodose overlay, gamma analysis, and we introduce the concept of 'dose plane histograms' for clinically relevant interpretation of film dosimetry. 12 radiotherapy centres and 19 plans were audited: conformal, IMRT (intensity modulated radiotherapy) and VMAT (volumetric modulated radiotherapy). Excellent agreement between planned and static-phantom results were seen (mean gamma pass 98.7% at 3% 2â¯mm). Dose blurring was evident in the moving-phantom measurements (mean gamma pass 88.2% at 3% 2â¯mm). Planning techniques for motion management were adequate to deliver the intended moving-target dose coverage. A novel, clinically-relevant, end-to-end dosimetry audit of motion management strategies in radiotherapy is reported. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We report on the first patient treatment of electromagnetic-guided real time adaptive radiotherapy delivered with MLC tracking for lung stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy. A clinical trial was developed to investigate the safety and feasibility of MLC tracking in lung. The first patient was an 80-year old man with a single left lower lobe lung metastasis to be treated with SABR to 48Gy in 4 fractions. In-house software was integrated with a standard linear accelerator to adapt the treatment beam shape and position based on electromagnetic transponders implanted in the lung. MLC tracking plans were compared against standard ITV-based treatment planning. MLC tracking plan delivery was reconstructed in the patient to confirm safe delivery. Real time adaptive radiotherapy delivered with MLC tracking compared to standard ITV-based planning reduced the PTV by 41% (18.7-11cm 3 ) and the mean lung dose by 30% (202-140cGy), V20 by 35% (2.6-1.5%) and V5 by 9% (8.9-8%). An emerging technology, MLC tracking, has been translated into the clinic and used to treat lung SABR patients for the first time. This milestone represents an important first step for clinical real-time adaptive radiotherapy that could reduce pulmonary toxicity in lung radiotherapy. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We investigated the current practice of SABR for early-stage NSCLC in Korea. We conducted a nationwide survey of SABR for NSCLC by sending e-mails to all board-certified members of the Korean Society for Radiation Oncology. The survey included 23 questions focusing on the technical aspects of SABR and 18 questions seeking the participants' opinions on specific clinical scenarios in the use of SABR for early-stage NSCLC. Overall, 79 radiation oncologists at 61/85 specialist hospitals in Korea (71.8%) responded to the survey. SABR was used at 33 institutions (54%) to treat NSCLC. Regarding technical aspects, the most common planning methods were the rotational intensity-modulated technique (59%) and the static intensity-modulated technique (49%). Respiratory motion was managed by gating (54%) or abdominal compression (51%), and 86% of the planning scans were obtained using 4-dimensional computed tomography. In the clinical scenarios, the most commonly chosen fractionation schedule for peripherally located T1 NSCLC was 60 Gy in four fractions. For centrally located tumors and T2 NSCLC, the oncologists tended to avoid SABR for radiotherapy, and extended the fractionation schedule. The results of our survey indicated that SABR is increasingly being used to treat NSCLC in Korea. However, there were wide variations in the technical protocols and fractionation schedules of SABR for early-stage NSCLC among institutions. Standardization of SABR is necessary before implementing nationwide, multicenter, randomized studies.\n\nCritical Structure Sparing in Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for Central Lung Lesions: Helical Tomotherapy vs. Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChi, Alexander; Ma, Pan; Fu, Guishan; Hobbs, Gerry; Welsh, James S.; Nguyen, Nam P.; Jang, Si Young; Dai, Jinrong; Jin, Jing; Komaki, Ritsuko\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Helical tomotherapy (HT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) are both advanced techniques of delivering intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Here, we conduct a study to compare HT and partial-arc VMAT in their ability to spare organs at risk (OARs) when stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is delivered to treat centrally located early stage non-small-cell lung cancer or lung metastases. Methods 12 patients with centrally located lung lesions were randomly chosen. HT, 2 & 8 arc (Smart Arc, Pinnacle v9.0) plans were generated to deliver 70 Gy in 10 fractions to the planning target volume (PTV). Target and OAR dose parameters were compared. Each techniqueâs ability to meet dose constraints was further investigated. Results HT and VMAT plans generated essentially equivalent PTV coverage and dose conformality indices, while a trend for improved dose homogeneity by increasing from 2 to 8 arcs was observed with VMAT. Increasing the number of arcs with VMAT also led to some improvement in OAR sparing. After normalizing to OAR dose constraints, HT was found to be superior to 2 or 8-arc VMAT for optimal OAR sparing (meeting all the dose constraints) (pâ=â0.0004). All dose constraints were met in HT plans. Increasing from 2 to 8 arcs could not help achieve optimal OAR sparing for 4 patients. 2/4 of them had 3 immediately adjacent structures. Conclusion HT appears to be superior to VMAT in OAR sparing mainly in cases which require conformal dose avoidance of multiple immediately adjacent OARs. For such cases, increasing the number of arcs in VMAT cannot significantly improve OAR sparing.

The advantage of the technique resides in its ability to provide a high dose to tumor but spare normal tissues to an extent not previously possible. In this paper we will provide an introduction and review of this technology with regard to its use in gynecologic malignancies. Preliminary results from our experience are presented for the purpose of illustrating the range of SBRT applications in gynecologic oncology. A comprehensive literature review was conducted and our experience from the past three years was reviewed. Six case series are published that report results of SBRT for gynecologic malignancies. Sixteen gynecologic patients have been treated with SBRT at our institution. Treatment sites include pelvic and periaortic nodes (9 patients), oligometastatic disease (2), and cervical or endometrial primary tumors when other conventional external radiation or brachytherapy techniques were unsuitable (5). Preliminary follow-up at a median of 11 months (range, 0.3-33 months) demonstrates 79% locoregional control, 43% distant failure, and 50% overall survival. SBRT boosts to macroscopic periaortic node recurrences and other sites seem to provide local control and a possibility of long-term disease-free survival in carefully selected patients. Previously this had been difficult to achieve with conventional radiotherapy because of the proximity of periaortic nodes to small bowel. SBRT also offers a novel approach for minimally invasive treatment in the management of gynecological cancer where current surgical and radiotherapy techniques are unsuitable.
