This disturbs the propagation of the electrical signals resulting in abnormal muscle contraction. This, in turn, manifests itself in atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachicardia, among other conditions.\n\nthe predominant means for generating ablative lesions in the heart is through the use of radio frequency energy.\n\nradio frequency energy is delivered from the tip of a catheter that is inserted percutaneously into an artery or a vein.\n\nEnergy is deposited in the tissue through ionic conduction of electricity, which generates heat in the process.\n\nthe energy is thermally conducted through the tissue from the source, at the point of contact, in all directions.\n\nvolumes of ablated tissue are generated that are far greater in width than necessary or desirable.\n\nelectrophysiologists and catheter companies have been working to develop catheters to duplicate the maze procedure or some other set of lesions without the need for open heart surgery. This effort, while still underway, has been largely unsuccessful for a number of reasons, including inadequate contact of the ablating electrode with the myocardium, and technical difficulty of the procedure in creating full thickness (i.e., transmyocardial) continuous lesions.\n\na method for ablation of cardiac tissue in a myocardium includes the steps of locating a region of aberrant electrical pathways in the myocardium and scanning a focused ultrasound beam through the region of the myocardium to destroy aberrant electrical pathways by creating a lesion of desired extent in the myocardium.\n\nApparatus for ablation of cardiac tissue in a myocardium constructed in accordance with the present invention, includes an ultrasound transducer and control means for energizing the ultrasound transducer to transmit a focused ultrasound beam at selected times and for selected periods to selected points in the myocardium to destroy aberrant electrical pathways in the myocardium by creating a lesion of desired extent in the myocardium.\n\nFigure 1 is a posterior view of a human heart showing a region of the myocardium of the heart through which a focused ultrasound beam is scanned to destroy aberrant electrical pathways by ablation of cardiac tissue and creation of a lesion of desired extent in the myocardium in accordance with the present invention.\n\nFigure 2 is a block diagram of apparatus, constructed in accordance with the present invention, for ablation of cardiac tissue in the myocardium to destroy aberrant electrical pathways and creation of a lesion of desired extent in the myocardium in accordance with the present invention.\n\nFigure 3 is a schematic representation of two transmissions of a focussed ultrasound beam by an ultrasound transducer in accordance with the present invention.\n\nFigure 4A is a vertical sectional view of a unit useful in carrying out the method of creating a lesion in the myocardium in accordance with the present invention.\n\nFigure 4B is a cross-sectional view of the Figure 4A unit.\n\na human heart has: a superior vena cava 10 right pulmonary veins 12 and 14 right atrium 16 intra atrial sulcus 18 area of oblique pericardial sinus 20 an inferior vena cava 22 a right coronary artery 24 a small cardiac vein 26 a coronary sinus 28 a right ventricle 30 a posterior interventicular branch 32 a middle cardiac vein 34 a left ventricle 36 an oblique vein 38 a great cardiac vein 40 left pulmonary veins 42 fold of left vena cava 44 a pulmonary trunk 46 and an aorta 48.\n\na region of aberrant electrical pathways in the myocardium is located and a focused ultrasound beam is scanned through this region of the myocardium to destroy aberrant electrical pathways by creating a lesion of desired extent in the myocardium.\n\nFigure 1 shows a path 50 that isolates the right pulmonary veins 12 and 14 and the left pulmonary veins 42 and along which the ultrasound beam is scanned to create the desired lesion in the myocardium by ablation.\n\nUltrasound transducer 52 can be of conventional construction and operation.\n\nthe step of scanning the focused ultrasound beam includes moving the focused ultrasound beam to points along scan path 50 at which a plurality of lesions are created that merge to form the lesion of desired extent in the myocardium.\n\ncontrol means 54 include an ablation beam signal source 56 which generates signals that are coupled to ultrasound transducer 52 through a switch 58 to energize the ultrasound transducer and transmit a focussed ultrasound beam to a target, namely the region of the myocardium where the desired lesion is to be created.\n\nthe focused ultrasound beam preferably has a duration of less than five seconds at each points along scan path 50. Under these conditions, blood flow itself is not an effective cooling mechanism. By limiting the duration of the ultrasound beam to less than five second, the blood flow will not increase and counteract ablation of the myocardium by the focused ultrasound beam.\n\nthe frequency of the focused ultrasound beam will be between 5 MHz and 15 MHz.\n\nFIG. 3 is a schematic representation of two transmissions of a focussed ultrasound beam by an ultrasound transducer 52.\n\nthe ultrasound transducer is composed of a plurality of elements that are energized in a timed sequence by signals from ablation beam signal source 56 to form an ultrasound beam that is electronically scanned, in the usual manner, as the different elements of the ultrasound transducer are energized.\n\nthe scanning mode can be sequential (i.e., groups of transducer elements are energized in physical order), so that a plurality of lesions are created as a sequence of elemental lesions that merge to form the lesion of desired extent in the myocardium.\n\nthe scanning mode can be other than sequential (i.e., groups of transducer elements are energized in other than physical order or more than one group of transducer elements is energized at the same time), so than the plurality of lesions are not formed in sequence.\n\nOne reason for non-sequential scanning is to permit the transducer elements to cool down between transmissions when either the power level is high or the time between transmissions is short.\n\nthe design of ablation beam signal source 56 permits selection of the desired mode of scanning.\n\nthe power or intensity level of the focused ultrasound beam can be adjusted, so that only at the focus of the ultrasound beam will the intensity be sufficiently high to irreversibly ablate the myocardium. This allows destroying tissue at depth without damaging overlying structures.\n\nthe ablation of the myocardium can be conducted by transmission of the focused ultrasound beam either from the epicardium of the heart or the endocardium of the heart.\n\ncontrol means 54 include inspection means for inspecting the lesion created in the myocardium.\n\ninspection means are particularly useful when the lesions are created by transmissions of the focused ultrasound beam from the endocardium of the heart.\n\nthe inspection means can be a conventional ultrasound imaging unit 60 that generates signals that are coupled through switch 58 to energize ultrasound transducer 52 to transmit ultrasound signals to a selected target and receives signals conducted through switch 58 from ultrasound transducer 52 that are developed from reflections of the ultrasound signals from the target.\n\nUltrasound imaging unit 60 forms, in the usual manner, an ultrasound image on a display screen 60a of the target, namely the lesion in the myocardium.\n\nthe same ultrasound transducer serves to form the focused ultrasound beam that creates the lesions in the myocardium and to develop ultrasound images of the lesions in the myocardium.\n\nthe operating mode of this ultrasound transducer is determined by the position of switch 58.\n\nthe aberrant electrical pathways are destroyed by a lesion that isolates the right pulmonary veins and the left pulmonary veins from the remainder of the atrium.\n\nOne such lesion set is the one created along scan path 50 shown in Figure 1.\n\nOther scan paths can be used.\n\ntwo scan paths, one surrounding and isolating the right pulmonary veins and another surrounding and isolating the left pulmonary veins can be used.\n\nthe step of scanning the focused ultrasound beam electronically is repeated at selected locations in the selected region or regions of the myocardium as the ultrasound transducer is repositioned manually along the selected scan path.\n\nFigures 4A and 4B illustrate one way of manually repositioning the ultrasound transducer along a selected scan path.\n\nAn ultrasound transducer 52 is positioned in a tube 62 that is adapted to be positioned on the heart.\n\nUltrasound transducer 52 is pulled through tube 62 by a pull wire 64 fastened to the leading end of the ultrasound transducer.\n\nTube 62 is made of a material that is expandable and has the proper acoustic impedance. The tube has sufficient flexibility to form a curved passage but is sufficiently stiff to allow pressure to be applied so as to maintain contact with the beating heart.\n\nTube 62 is positioned in its unexpanded shape in order to pass through the anatomical confines of the atrium.\n\nwater is passed through tube 62.\n\nthe pressure of the water passing through tube 62 expands the tube.\n\nthe water also serves as a coupling material and as a coolant for the ultrasound transducer.\n\nultrasound transducer 52 is inserted in the tube. As shown in Figure 4B, tube 62 is shaped to prevent rotation of ultrasound transducer 52 relative to the cardiac surface.\n\nPull wire 64 is indexed, so that ultrasound transducer 52 is properly repositioned at prescribed points along the scan path at which the focused ultrasound beam is scanned electronically to create the desired lesion sequence in the myocardium.\n\nthe transducer is moved in increments that result in overlap of the plurality of lesions.\n\nLandscapes\n\nHealth & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nSurgery (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nLife Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nBiomedical Technology (AREA)\n\nNuclear Medicine, Radiotherapy & Molecular Imaging (AREA)\n\nVascular Medicine (AREA)\n\nOrthopedic Medicine & Surgery (AREA)\n\nMechanical Engineering (AREA)\n\nHeart & Thoracic Surgery (AREA)\n\nMedical Informatics (AREA)\n\nMolecular Biology (AREA)\n\nAnimal Behavior & Ethology (AREA)\n\nGeneral Health & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nPublic Health (AREA)\n\nVeterinary Medicine (AREA)\n\nUltra Sonic Daignosis Equipment (AREA)\n\nAbstract\n\nDans un dispositif de crÃ©ation de types d'ablation Ã l'intÃ©rieur d'un coeur, une source d'ultrasons est utilisÃ©e Ã la fois pour localiser les sites d'ablation et ensuite pour procÃ©der effectivement Ã l'ablation des sites sÃ©lectionnÃ©s.
