        "text": "Tuesday – We drove back from Cartagena this morning before heading to surgery in the afternoon for a bypass grafting case. For the first half of the way, I sat in the back and enjoyed looking out the window. It’s amazing how dry parts of Bolivar are.\n\nThe drought has been responsible for the deaths of over 20,000 farm animals here in Colombia. The small lakes are disappearing, from my first trip to Sincelejo to my most recent visit just a few weeks later. The trees and bushes besides the roadways are completely coated with layers of dust from passing vehicles. It gets greener as we pass into Sucre, but it’s a sad reminder of the devastating effects of climate change.\n\nAfter stopping for breakfast along the way, where we met up with Dr. Melano, Iris went with Dr. Melano and I stayed with Dr. Barbosa. We talked about music mostly. At one point, a former patient from several years ago called, just to say hello. The patient had recently heard that Dr. Barbosa now had a surgery program in Sucre. (The patient had previously traveled to Cartagena from a small town in Sucre for surgery.)\n\nOnce we got to Sincelejo, we headed to the hospital to see our patient before surgery and go over any last-minute questions or concerns.\n\n(Of course) I was worried about finding vein but we easily found good quality conduit. Dr. Salgua has been very nice about helping me with the saphenectomies. The team teases me because I have a difficult time pronouncing her name. We have a kind of system: While I finish closing the leg, she moves up the table to assist the surgeon in starting the grafts. Then when I finish wrapping the leg, I stay at the back of the table with the instrumentadora, learning the Spanish names for all the instruments. Once the chest is closed, she does a layer of fascia and I close the skin incision.\n\nIt’s a little crowded sometimes with the new instrumentadora learning the essentials of cardiac surgery, but the atmosphere at the back of the table is a lot different from the climate at the top. (Dr. B is always calm, pleasant and entertaining – but Dr. Salgua is almost completely silent the whole time). I am a lot quieter than my “out of OR self” when I am across the table from the surgeon too..\n\nWednesday – Another coronary case, on a fragile-ish patient (multiple co-morbidities including chronic kidney disease etc). It was a long case and I was a little worried the whole time but the patient did well. (I always worry about the frail patients).\n\nI did okay too – performing a saphenectomy with Dr. Barbosa. The patient had a vein stripping procedure previously (on one leg only) so I wanted to be sure to get a good segment of vein on the remaining vein. I think Dr. Barbosa was worried about the quality of the conduit (because he kind of hovered – and didn’t relax until we started harvesting it.)\n\nI wish I would have more opportunities to perform a traditional saphenectomy (one very long incision). I assisted on one several years ago – and I think if I had a chance to do a couple more, I would feel more comfortable skip harvesting. Of course, a headlamp would also help. (It’s kind of dark looking down the skip ‘tunnels’). Then once I’ve mastered skip harvesting, I think it’s just another small jump to endo-harvesting with a scope. I know a lot of people never bother learn to skip harvest, but I feel more comfortable building on the principles of open procedures first. I might need them in an emergency case which is kind of why I wished I had more open saphenectomy experience.\n\nThursday – Saw three patients in the clinic today. However, on reviewing the patient records and an intra-office echocardiogram, one of the patients definitely doesn’t need surgery at this point. (Asymptomatic with only moderate valvular disease). We were happy to let him know he didn’t need surgery even if that means fewer cases.\n\nTwo surgeries today. The first case was a bypass case for a patient with severe coronary disease and unstable angina. Dr. Salgua and I did the harvest. I think Dr. Barbosa is a little nervous about handing over the reins to me for harvest because he keeps a pretty close eye on me while I am doing it. But then again, it might be because I am a little overly cautious and hesitant at this point. If I didn’t have Dr. Salgua to look over my shoulder and encourage me onward, I’d put clips on everything and proceed at a snail’s pace to make sure I do it right. But since it’s still my first week, maybe I shouldn’t be so hard on myself.\n\nOn the other hand, he must think my suturing is pretty good, because he just trusts me to do it correctly.\n\nThe second case was a patient from last week, who developed a large (symptomatic) pleural effusion and cardiac effusion (no tamponade or hemodynamic instability) which is a pretty common surgical complication. The case proceeded well – I placed the chest tube, with Dr. Barbosa supervising. Dr. Barbosa performed the cardiac window portion of the procedure.\n\nSadly, one of our patients from last week died today. It was a fragile patient to begin with, and even though surgery proceeded well, the patient could never tolerate extubation and had to be re-intubated twice after initially doing well. From there, the patient continued to deteriorate.\n\nFriday\n\nToday we had a beautiful aortic valve surgery. This has always been one of my favorite cardiac procedures. Somehow its elegant in the way the new valve slides down the carefully coördinated sutures. (I don’t have pictures from this case – since I was first assisting – but I will post some from a previous case – so you can see what I mean).\n\nDr. Salgua worked an overnight shift, so I was at the top of the table – (and yes, noticeably quieter than normal.) I was surprised at how fast it seemed to go – but maybe that’s because everything went so smoothly. Or maybe because we’ve done a lot of coronaries lately, which is a much more tedious and time-consuming process.\n\nIris and I are working on a patient education process – as a way to improve the continuum of care for patients (particularly after discharge). I really enjoy working with Iris because I feel like we are always on the same page when it comes to patient care.\n\nWhile it’s been a tiring week for the crew – I am, as always! exhilarated and happy to be here in Sincelejo. Just knowing it’s the end of another week (and I am that much closer to going home) has me feeling a little sad. But I guess I can’t stay forever, and I sure don’t want to take advantage of all the kindnesses that have been extended to me.\n\nThat being said:\n\nAt the end of every surgery, every day and every week in Sincelejo – I am grateful. Grateful to Dr. Barbosa for being such a willing and patient teacher – grateful to the operating room crew (especially Iris Castro and Dr. Salgua) and particularly grateful to all the kind and generous patients I have met and helped take care of*.\n\nThe medical mission\n\nThis week I had another inquiry about ‘medical missions’. I know people mean well when they ask about medical missions, or when they participate in these types of activities but…\n\nLong time readers know my philosophy on this – don’t go overseas so you can pat yourself on the back over the ‘great deeds’ you performed ‘helping the poor’. It’s patronizing to the destination country and its inhabitants – and generally not very useful anyway. An awful lot of volunteers with real skills and talents go to waste on these so-called mission trips when their skills might be better served (in less exciting or glamorous ways) in free clinics in our own country.\n\nBut it does give everyone involved a chance to brag about how selfless and noble they have been; traveling thousands of miles, sleeping somewhere without 24/7 wi-fi (and who knows what other hardships).\n\nInstead, change your orientation – and maybe challenge that assumption that everything you’ve learned about medicine, health care and taking care of people is better and superior. Open your eyes and be willing to learn what others have to teach you instead.\n\n* I always opt for full disclosure and transparency with the patients. I introduce myself and explain that I am a studying with Dr. Barbosa, what my credentials and experience is to give them the opportunity to ‘opt out’.\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nHere in Cartagena, I have been fortunate enough to have two great roommates; Iris and Ximena.\n\nDr. Barbosa made all the arrangements for me, and I was a little nervous about bunking down with another nurse (we can be temperamental and territorial at times) but living with Iris has been absolutely wonderful.\n\nI was kind of worried I’d be living with some young, possibly flighty nurse who might resent having a middle-age woman in her home, cramping her style. Instead, it’s like having an instant best friend and I love it.\n\nFor starters – we have a lot in common: we are both academically and professionally inclined. Iris is the perfusionist for Dr. Barbosa’s cardiac surgery service and is extremely knowledgeable.\n\n(In Colombia, Perfusion is an advanced nursing degree. Iris obtained her master’s degrees in both critical care (National University) and Perfusion at (CES.). She is widely acknowledged as one of the best perfusionists (if not the best) in all of Colombia. Her peers frequently consult her seeking advice for a variety of surgical circumstances.\n\nShe is the only nurse to collaborate (and be listed on the cover) of a comprehensive Colombian textbook on Cardiology. Her name is listed along side such esteemed Colombian physicians as Pablo Guerra, Nestor Sandoval and Sergio Franco.\n\nShe also serves as a reviewing editor of several Colombian medical journals. Research articles are sent to Iris to review the methodology/ study design and overall quality. Articles she rejects will not be accepted for publication.\n\nIn her free time, it’s not unusual to find her reading the latest journal articles on cardiac surgery or working on presentations for the latest meeting or international conference on perfusion. In fact, she recently returned from the annual Colombian conference on cardiology and cardiac surgery in Medellin. She is equally enthusiastic about all aspects of nursing and the position and rights of women (nurses) in Colombia and in medical society in general.\n\nShe is particularly outspoken against much of the machismo that dominates life here. She is the one person I have learned to expect to never ask me the unpleasantly intrusive questions that seem to pass for almost introductory conversation here such as “Why don’t you have children? Don’t you want them? What does your husband think of that? Your husband permits you to be here [in Colombia] without him?”*\n\nEven when we don’t agree on all issues, she never judges my opinions or thoughts. She endeavors to understand my reasoning instead. It’s refreshing.\n\nThis combination of intellect, insight and experience makes for a lot of interesting and engaging discussions in the evenings as we relax and enjoy the fragrant breezes that bring daily relief to the sweltering city.\n\nA strong woman in a culture of machismo\n\nIris is also extremely forthright and independent (traits that also resonate with me.) She takes no ‘guff’ from anyone and lives how she pleases in a society that has a lot of difficulty accepting that (unmarried, no kids with Ximena as a part-time roommate.)\n\nEven my professor, as charming and intelligent as he is, defaults into this kind of ‘macho’ thinking. He tells me he worries about Iris, as “she is all alone” without a man to protect her. He worries she is missing out on true happiness and is destined to be sad, alone. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nRather, Iris has chosen to defy tradition, and live life on her terms. She has friends, family and romantic attachments like anyone else. She just maintains both her privacy and her independence despite that, sort of like Elizabeth I of England.\n\nIt is sometimes hard as an outsider to understand why this attracts some much attention – a single woman living quietly in her own apartment. But then I think back to some of the comments I get from friends, acquaintances, co-workers and even strangers regarding locums life, and I realize, that as female professionals; whether the United States or Colombia, we still have a long way to go.\n\nIt’s just that as an American, I think I have fallen for the illusion of the possibility of female equality in way that women in other countries never have. (The irony is that at this moment in my home country, women’s rights; to reproductive, financial and professional freedom are being eroded more that any other time in recent history. Hard won battles of the 60’s and 70’s are being erased with nary an outcry.)\n\nHere ‘paternalism’ rules the day – and no one pretends any different.\n\nBut there is more to Iris that a forthright, intelligent, independent individual. She is also a nurturer, a caregiver, a nurse in the very sense of the word.\n\nWhat could be more nurturing that offering up her home to an unknown stranger from another land?\n\n“Ximena”\n\nIris and the other members of her apartment complex have adopted a white and orange stray cat that answers to a variety of affectionate terms. One of these is “Nena”. One my first day here, I confused “Nena” as a shortened version of Ximena, so Ximena she is.\n\nThis straggly looking, mangy little ball of fluff is adored by the residents of the small apartment building. Typical of most cats, she is “owned” by none, but owns each neighbor in turn. But it was Iris who took up donations to get Ximena surgery she needed and routine veterinary care. All the residents share in the feeding and care of the street cat – including applying a cream to her healing surgical scar, but it is Iris whom Ximena usually seeks.\n\nWhile most of the residents leave their doors open during the afternoons to invite Ximena in, Ximena is most often found either inside our apartment, or bellowing outside the door (on the rare occasions that is is closed.) She wanders in with the grace and arrogance that only a cat possesses.\n\nShe carries herself with a dignity that belies her ‘homeless’ state as to say she isn’t a vagabond but a seasoned traveler as she visits each apartment in turn – but always comes back to Iris to stay all afternoon and overnight.\n\nSome of the neighbors our jealous of Ximena’s attention, but with our weekly journeys to Sincelejo, they always have an apportunity to host ‘Nena as their favored guest.\n\nIris loves to cook – and does so easily, deliciously. She embraces a healthy lifestyle filled with daily exercise and fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\nWe talk about my love of Colombian food – and together one day in the kitchen, we make brevas. She tells me with a smile that she has never made them, but used to watch her grandmother cook them for a sweet tweet.\n\nWe savor the sugary treat, one breva at a time over the next several days.\n\nIn addition to learning how to perform saphenectomies from Dr. Barbosa, Iris is teaching me how to crochet. My first project will be one of the small bags that is in a style typical for Colombia. I think it is ironic that it seems easier to suture that it is to crochet.\n\nBut Iris is endlessly patient with me – and slowly, slowly as I unravel my mistakes and start again, I am making progress. She has a blogspot where she showcases her latest creations. She recently received national accreditation as a ‘native artist’ to participate in festivals and art fairs that specialize in traditional Colombia crafts.\n\nToday, as we sit on the sofa, crocheting, we talk about plans for the Semana Santa (Easter Week). The secretarial staff in Sincelejo has vacation plans and wants to keep the office closed all week so she can visit a boyfriend in Medellin – but Iris and I think it should remain open for the patients. We plan to offer to staff the office, so that patients won’t have to wait a week to be seen. We will have to navigate and negotiate carefully and diplomatically to prevent causing any hard feelings but as Iris points out, it’s the right thing to do for the patients – and the doctors, and that’s what matters. (My motives are admittedly more self-serving: more clinic = more surgery.)\n\n*This type of questioning is fairly pervasive throughout Colombia, and is often performed as part of introductory conversation. Once a taxi driver in Bogotá directed me to the nearest fertility clinic when I responded “No” to the question about children. He wasn’t rude, on the contrary, he thought he was being helpful.\n\n** Iris prefers not to have her picture taken.\n\n0.000000 0.000000\n\nDr. Sergio Franco wrote the book on heart surgery.\n\nIt was exciting and illuminating to talk to Dr. Sergio Franco, who is one of Colombia’s most prolific writers and professors of cardiac surgery. The 50 year-old cardiac surgeon has authored multiple textbooks for surgeons and edited ten others, making him one of the nation’s definitive experts on cardiac surgery.\n\nCurrently he is the Medical Director of the Cardiopulmonary and Peripheral Vascular Center of the Fundacion San Vicente in Rio Negro, as well as Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the Clinica de Medellin. For the last 12 years, he has also been the program director for post-graduate studies at the Universidad CES medical school. Between the two clinics, and the five other surgeons he works with (2 at Clinica de Medellin and 2 at Rionegro), he estimates that the cardiac programs see volumes of 700 – 750 cases per year.\n\nFor our first interview, we meet at the Clinica de Medellin to talk. He later invites me to see the hospital at Rionegro.\n\nEducation/ Training / Experience\n\nDr. Franco attended medical school, general surgery residency and cardiac surgery fellowship at the Universidad Pontifica Boliviarana. He finished his fellowship in 1996. As part of his fellowship, he spent nine months training in heart and lung transplantation at Loyola University Medical Center in Chicago, Il. During his heart and lung tranplantation training, he received an award as “Best Foreign Medical Fellow.” He graduated with high honors due to his exemplary grade point average.\n\nHe has additional training in thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic surgery (Missouri Baptist, 1998), and minimally invasive valvular surgery (Cleveland Clinic).\n\nSelected awards and special recognition\n\nHe was also the first surgeon to perform endovascular harvesting of the saphenous vein in Colombia in 1997. He received second place for a poster presentation based on this technique at the Colombian Congress of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cartagena, 8 to 11 February 2006.\n\nHe received the Cesar Uribe Piedrahita Medal from the Colombian Medical Federation and the Antioquia Medical College in 2003 for academic and clinical excellence, in addition to several other awards for academic achievement.\n\nHe was the chapter president of the Colombian Society of Cardiovascular Surgery and the Colombian Surgical Consensus for multiple terms. He was also the Chairman, and Medical Advisory of the first Latin American Forums on cardiovascular surgery.\n\nHe has received several awards including “The best of 2006” from Hospital General de Medellin for his assistance in the development, creation and commissioning of the cardiovascular services unit at that facility. He has also presented his work at numerous national and international conferences.\n\nHe speaks English in addition to his native Spanish.\n\nDr Sergio Franco\n\nSan Vicente Fundacion\n\nCardiovascular Surgery\n\nMedical Director, Cardiopulmonary and Vascular Surgery\n\nRionegro, Antioquia\n\nTele: 574 444 8717 Ext. 3502\n\nCell: 310 424 4884\n\nEmail: sfsx@sanvicentefundacion.com\n\nWebsite: http://www.sanvicentefundacion.com\n\nWhile I requested a visit to the operating room, an invitation was not forthcoming.\n\nSelected writings of Dr. Sergio Franco\n\nBook chapters:\n\n1.

Long-Term Effectiveness of HIFU on Atrial Fibrillation in High Risk Valvular Surgery Patients. A Clinical Interview from Epicor- Cardiac Ablation System – St Jude Medical. March 2009.\n\nI apologize for the wordiness of this post – but much of what we discuss below is covered in the Bogotá, Cartagena and Mexicali books – the essential mechanisms of cardiac surgery; how procedures work, what is off-pump surgery, when do we use the bypass pump and other explanatory information. But since I have am not writing a full book on Medellin, I wanted to offer a bit of a primer for my new internet readers here.\n\nDr. Luis Meza\n\nCardiac surgeon, Hospital General de Medellin\n\nAfter interviewing Dr. Meza and meeting many of the staff at Hospital General de Medellin, it was a pleasure to be invited to observe Dr. Meza and Dr. Urequi , the head of the cardiac surgery department in the operating room. Despite the patient’s young age, the surgery (for me as an observer) was knuckle-biting. While the surgery itself was a fast, straight-forward and uncomplicated repair of an interauricular septal defect – it was the patient’s fragile condition that had me on the edge of my seat.\n\nComplex patients The case was typical of many of the cases they see at public hospitals. It was a young patient with newly diagnosed right-sided heart failure due to an uncorrected congenital defect. The patient had traveled from another part of Colombia (one of the poorer regions) to have surgery. The patient had initially presented to a local doctor after a syncopal event (passing out) and was found to have an enlarged heart, with a moderate sized pericardial effusion (fluid in the sac around the heart.) After arriving at HGM, the patient was also diagnosed with a serious acquired coagulopathy (bleeding disorder).\n\nSince the patient had a hole between the left atrium leading into the right atrium, blood was being pushed from the left atrium (which is under higher pressure) to the low pressure right atrium. Over the course of many years, this had caused the right atrium to enlarge massively. As the right atrium was continuously being overfilled (from blood from the left side), the right side of the heart was being forced to work harder, and harder. As the atrium continued to be overstretched, and enlarged – it also caused blood to be forced back into the pulmonary arteries – causing pulmonary hypertension. While pre-surgical tests (echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization) showed the patient to have (only) moderate pulmonary hypertension (with PA systolic pressures of 65mmHg).\n\nPre-operative testing is only part of the story\n\nHowever, when we looked down, into the patient’s chest – it was obvious that the patient’s pulmonary vasculature was engorged and enlarged. The patient’s heart was massive, and floppy (which is a sign the heart is working way too hard). The patient also had peripheral edema which is another sign that the heart was not working well.\n\nPotential for badness*\n\nSo even though, the surgery itself (described below) is not terribly technically challenging (‘like darning socks’ one surgeon used to say) – a lot can go wrong because the patient’s heart just doesn’t work that well to begin with.\n\n* a not-so-scientific term to describe the likelihood of potential complications, problems or adverse outcomes. These may be unavoidable circumstances in many cases – but the term is a reminder to remain vigilant even during so-called “simple” procedures.\n\nNitric oxide on hand\n\nThis OR does have nitric oxide – (which we didn’t need), but was available nearby, just in case. Nitric oxide, milrinone and other medications are critical to have on hand in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Some patients will never need it – others can’t survive without it – and sadly, (in patients with severe fixed pulmonary hypertension), nothing – not even an assist device is going to make much difference. While we can try to predict which patients are going to tolerate surgery, it’s not always clear-cut. Tests (echocardiograms, right heart caths) can predict, tests can give probabilities – but sometimes tests are wrong, and patients who appear to have only ‘mild’ disease do very poorly (and visa versa). Sometimes, we just have to hold our breath as the patient comes off bypass and see.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous post – cardiac surgery procedures can be a bit more complicated than many other surgical procedures, and while having something like nitric oxide on hand doesn’t seem like a big deal – it is. (I have worked in several facilities without these capabilities). It also speaks to the general preparedness of the staff. But despite the ‘potential for badness’ everything proceeded beautifully with Drs. Urequi and Meza. The case seemed to speed by despite the patient’s fragile health. The entire CPB (cardiopulmonary bypass run) was just 26 minutes with a total cross-clamp time of 31 minutes.)\n\nA little bit about cardiopulmonary bypass – the “heart-lung machine”\n\nIn comparison to the congenital repair above, average CPB times for valve replacement run around 100 minutes, 60 to 90 minutes for bypass surgery. Patients have a higher risk of CPB related complications from hypo/ altered perfusion after long pump runs . As the clock begins to exceed 120 minutes, the risk of renal failure, cognitive changes and bleeding problems (as blood cells are continuous smashed/ broken / damaged within the pump) increase.\n\nWhat is “Off-pump surgery”? Nowadays, lots of people get real excited about “off-pump” surgery because they think that by not using the heart-lung machine, they can avoid a lot of the problems we mentioned above. But that’s oversimplifying the entire scenario – and one that I find is often used to “sell” a particular surgeon or surgical program. Off-pump can be safer than CPB cases, for some patients. But these are usually not the patients that the surgery is sold to.. So it’s important to know what some of the terminology really means. Just because Hospital X has billboards announcing that they now perform off pump surgery – doesn’t mean that it’s something you may even need or want.\n\nOff pump is not for everyone\n\nPatients have to be fairly healthy to tolerate cardiac surgery without the pump. People with a lot of the problems that we thought were worsened by the pump, actually fare worse when we try to do surgery without the heart-lung machine. For example, we initially thought that Off-pump surgery would be great for people with renal insufficiency or ‘bad kidneys’ – particularly people who have kidney problems but aren’t quite sick enough to be on dialysis yet. The hope was that by avoiding the bypass pump we could avoid any damage to the kidneys from artificial flow/hypoperfusion because one of the biggest risks of cardiac surgery in patients with bad kidneys is that surgery will cause their kidneys to fail entirely, and make patients dialysis dependent. Unfortunately, the research from all of the off-pump surgeries being done hasn’t really shown the benefits that we thought it would. So like most things in medicine, it’s not quite the panacea we had hoped it was. But we did learn an incredible amount of information once surgeons started trying off pump surgeries for coronary bypass. Surprisingly, we learned that many of the complications, and conditions that we had long blamed on the CPB pump – weren’t related to the machine at all. But much of this is still being argued by cardiac surgeons every single day – each with different research studies giving different results..\n\nMore importantly, Off-pump not possible for many types of cardiac surgery\n\nIt’s technically impossible to do some types of cases without the bypass pump. Coronary bypass surgery (CABG) is very different from other types of surgery, for example. During bypass, the surgeon is only operating on the outside of the heart – attaching new conduit (arteries and veins) to arteries on the surface of the heart. So – it isn’t absolutely essential to have the pump circulating blood for him while he’s operating – in some patients – we can let their body do it for us during surgery.\n\nBut replacing diseased heart valves, or the great vessels (aortic aneurysms etc) is a completely different entity. In those surgeries – the surgeon is cutting into the heart or great vessels themselves. It’s not possible to lop off the top of the aorta, operate on the aortic valve and not have blood being re-directed mechanically during this process. Otherwise blood would just literally spill out into the chest and never oxygenate the brain and the rest of the body. (The only time we ever do this kind of procedure without a pump is during organ retrieval – for obvious reasons). It’s important to know these distinctions so people understand how the surgery actually proceeds.\n\nFor the case today – the surgeon has to make an incision through the side of the atria (wall of the heart chamber) to get to the hole on the inside wall of the heart.) The surgeon then closes the hole with suture (and a patch, in some cases). Some doctors do this in the cath lab without surgery – but that’s also controversal because the patch used in the cath procedures in the past has caused a high incidence of stroke. In a young patient like the one here – you certainly wouldn’t want to risk it – particularly since we don’t know how well those patches hold up in the long term.\n\nCardiac surgeons operate at Hospital General de Medellin (HGM)\n\nOverall evaluation of today’s case:\n\nSafety checklists, and all pre-operative procedures were completed. Patient was prepped and draped in an appropriate sterile fashion. Antibiotics were administered within the recommended window (of time). Appropriate records were maintained during the case.\n\nSurgery proceeded normally and without incident.\n\nDue to an underlying coagulopathy the patient did require administration of nonautologous blood products (4 units of packed red blood cells, 3 packets of platelets, and abumin) while on pump. While the facility does not have a ‘cell-saver’ for washing and re-infusing shed blood, patient did receive autologous(their own) transfusion from the CPB pump. This blood, from the CPB circuit was returned to the patient to limit the amount of blood needed after surgery. Hemoglobin at the conclusion of surgery was 9.6mg/dl, which is within acceptable parameters.\n\nHemostasis was obtained prior to chest closure, with only a small amount of chest tube drainage in the collection chamber at the time of transfer to the intensive care unit.\n\nSurgical Apgars – do not apply for cardiac cases due to the nature of the case, and use of CPB. Mean pressure while on CPB was within an acceptable range. Patient’s urinary output was less than anticipated during the case (150cc) despite the use of mannitol while on pump, but the patient responded well (1000+) with volume infusion and the addition of furosemide.\n\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable during the entire case. The was a very brief transitory period of hypotension (less than 5 minutes) near the conclusion of the case, which was immediately noted by anesthesia and treated with no recurrence.\n\nOn transfer to the unit, the patient was accompanied by several members of the OR staff, including Dr. Meza, the anesthesiologist, and the perfusionist, each of which did a face-to-face “hand-off” report of the patient (and medical history) including the course of the surgical procedure (including medications given, lab values, procedural details) to the Intensivist (physician), with ICU nursing staff attending to the patient.\n\nTransesophageal echo (TEE) was not performed during this case, but was available if needed.\n\nAlso, I am happy to report there were no smartphones or “facebooking” in sight. No one appeared engaged in anything other than the surgery at hand.\n\nIt looks like the rest of the medical community is finally speaking up about the overuse and safety issues of TAVI/ TAVR for aortic stenosis, but it’s still few and far between – and in specialty journals… But in the same week that Medscape, and the Heart.org reported on a newly published article in the British Medical Journal on the overuse of TAVI therapies, and the need for earlier diagnosis and treatment of Aortic Stenosis – the Interventionalists over at the Heart.org (a cardiology specialty journal) have published a series of articles promoting / pushing the procedure including an article entitled, “The TAVR Heart team roles.”\n\nJAMA recently published a paper by Robert Bonow and Chintan Desnai, discussing the benefits, risks and expectations with TAVI. This paper discusses the very real need for clinicians to address heightened patient expectations regarding TAVI as an ‘easy’ alternative to surgery.\n\nTAVI is vastly overused – Reed Miller, The Heart.org\n\nHere at Cartagena Surgery – we’ve been doing our own research – contacting and talking to a multitude of practicing cardiologists and cardiac surgeons to get their opinions – in addition to reviewing the latest data.\n\nIn related news, a review of the latest research on the ‘transcatheter’ valve therapies demonstrates considerable concern: including data on peri-valvular leaks as reported in the last national TAVI registries in Europe and in the US:\n\n• The incidence of paravalvular leaks after TAVI is extremely high ( > 60%)\n\n• It is technically challenging today to quantify these leaks.\n\n• Most of them are quoted “mild”, but more than 15 % are estimated “moderate” and “severe”.\n\n• In > 5% of patients, the peri-valvular or valvular regurgitation grade increased significantly over time.\n\n• there is no significant difference between Edwards SAPIEN and Medtronic COREVALVE\n\nAs one cardiologist explained:\n\n“Importantly, the thrombogenic potential of mild leaks was recently demonstrated by Larry Scotten ( Vivitro System Inc. Victoria, Canada). High reverse flow velocities expose glycoprotein GP Ib-IX-V platelet receptors to circulating Von Willebrand molecule with, as results, platelet aggregation and fibrin formation. The incidence of brain spots and stroke after TAVI was of great concern in the PARTNER A and B studies. Whereas, Aspirin is not mandatory in patients implanted with bioprosthetic valves, Plavix + Aspirin is recommended for all TAVI patients. The rationales of such therapy were not explained so far.”\n\nValve oversizing – a surgeon explains\n\n“To reduce these peri-valvular leaks , cardiologists tentatively use large valve size, up to 29-mm. The very large majority of valve sizes used in conventional aortic valve replacement are smaller than 25-mm. Oversizing may increase the risk of late aortic aneurysms (aortic rupture has been reported) [emphasis added].\n\nMoreover, atrio-ventricular conduction may be impaired with the need of permanent pacing. Poorer outcomes have been reported in patients when the need for permanent pacemaker occurs.\n\n“As we like to say about clothes and shoes, you forget the price overnight but you remember the quality for ever . The price of TAVI may be cheaper but patients may experience inferior outcomes. In view of these results, using TAVI would not be appropriate for the great majority of heart valve candidates. Moreover trans-catheter delivery and sub-optimal fit are not likely to increase tissue valve durability… and everybody knows that tissue valves are not enough durable for young adults and children. TAVI is thus a suitable strategy only for the neglected population of high risk patients who are no longer candidates for surgery [emphasis added].\n\nWorth pointing out again that there would be no need for TAVI and long-term outcomes of patients would be much better if severe aortic stenosis were correctly managed at the right time. Enclosed the recommendations of Robert Bonow (Circulation, July 25, 2012) for early valve replacement in ASYMPTOMATIC patients. A large cohort of accurate biomarkers is available today for correct timing of surgery and consequent prevention of irreversible myocardium damage. In the study of Lancellotti (enclosed) 55% of “truly asymptomatic patients” with severe aortic stenosis developed pulmonary hypertension during exercise and had poor clinical outcomes. The measurement of both mean trans-aortic pressure gradient and systolic pulmonary pressure, which are technically easy, rapid and with good reproducibility may improve the management of such patients.\n\nThese updates on the natural history of aortic stenosis illustrate the present paradoxical and intriguing focus of the industry on an experimental procedural innovation for end-stage old patients when more efficient heart valves are today feasible and could be used sooner for the benefit of all patients .\n\nEnclosed an article on The Need For A Global Perspective On Heart Valve from Sir Madgi Yacoub.\n\nAdditional Reference / supporting data:\n\nModified from Ross J and Branwald E (Circulation 1968 (Suppl): 61-67)\n\n• The incidence of stroke was 9% after TAVI in the 214 patients of the enclosed study published last week in the American Journal of Cardiology. The incidence of stroke with TAVI was > two times higher than with conventional surgery in the PARTNER study. Pooled proportion of postoperative stroke was 2.4% with conventional surgery in the large meta-analysis of patients > 80 years old (enclosed)\n\n• Peri-valvular aortic insufficiency is observed in more than 60% of patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve replacement. Moderate or severe aortic insufficiency was seen in 17.3 % of the PARTNER inoperable and high risk cohorts at 1 year. They have been reportedly associated with dyspnea, anemia, cardiac failure and diminished survival. Most interestingly, the FDA does not accept more than 1% peri-valvular insufficiency in patients implanted with conventional prosthetic heart valves… The SJM Silzone mechanical heart valve was re-called because of peri-valvular leakage rate of… 1.5 % .\n\n• Traditionally, aortic stenosis involving a 2-cuspid aortic valve has been a contraindication to TAVI. Of 347 octogenarians and 17 nonagenarians explanted valves , 78 (22%) and 3 ( 18%) had stenotic congenitally bicuspid aortic valve, respectively. Because the results of TAVI are less favorable in patients with stenotic congenitally bicuspid valves, proper identification of the underlying aortic valve structure is critical when considering TAVI in older patients . More than 50% of patients with aortic stenosis have bicuspid aortic valve and are not, therefore, good candidates for TAVI. Most importantly, the great majority of patients with calcified stenotic bicuspid aortic valves is young ( < 60 years old) and not candidate for tissue valve replacement.\n\n• The French Registry of trans-catheter aortic-valve implantation in high-risk patients was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 3, 2012. It reports 3195 TAVI procedures during the last two years at 34 centers.\n\nThe mean age was 83 years. The incidence of stroke was 4.1%. Peri-prosthetic aortic regurgitation was 64 %. The rate of death was 24% at one year. At the same time, the meta-analysis published in the American Heart Journal reports 13,216 CONVENTIONAL AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT in patients > 80 years old. The rate of death was 12.4% at one year, 21.3% at 3 years and 34.6% at 5 years\n\nFull references for works cited in text:\n\nBonow, R. O. (2012).

N Engl J Med. 2012 May 3; 366(18):1705-15 [full abstract below].\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nTranscatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) is an emerging intervention for the treatment of high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis and coexisting illnesses.\n\nWe report the results of a prospective multicenter study of the French national transcatheter aortic-valve implantation registry, FRANCE 2.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nAll TAVIs performed in France, as listed in the FRANCE 2 registry, were prospectively included in the study. The primary end point was death from any cause.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nA total of 3195 patients were enrolled between January 2010 and October 2011 at 34 centers. The mean (±SD) age was 82.7±7.2 years; 49% of the patients were women.\n\nAll patients were highly symptomatic and were at high surgical risk for aortic-valve replacement. Edwards SAPIEN and Medtronic CoreValve devices were implanted in 66.9% and 33.1% of patients, respectively. Approaches were either transarterial (transfemoral, 74.6%; subclavian, 5.8%; and other, 1.8%) or transapical (17.8%).\n\nThe procedural success rate was 96.9%. Rates of death at 30 days and 1 year were 9.7% and 24.0%, respectively.\n\nAt 1 year, the incidence of stroke was 4.1%, and the incidence of periprosthetic aortic regurgitation was 64.5%.\n\nIn a multivariate model, a higher logistic risk score on the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE), New York Heart Association functional class III or IV symptoms, the use of a transapical TAVI approach, and a higher amount of periprosthetic regurgitation were significantly associated with reduced survival.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThis prospective registry study reflected real-life TAVI experience in high-risk elderly patients with aortic stenosis, in whom TAVI appeared to be a reasonable option.\n\nRutger-Jan Nuis, MSc, Nicolas M.

Frequency and Causes of Stroke During or After Trans-catheter Aortic Valve Implantation. American Journal of Cardiology Volume 109, Issue 11 , Pages 1637-1643, 1 June 2012 [full abstract provided].\n\nTranscatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is invariably associated with the risk of clinically manifest transient or irreversible neurologic impairment. We sought to investigate the incidence and causes of clinically manifest stroke during TAVI. A total of 214 consecutive patients underwent TAVI with the Medtronic-CoreValve System from November 2005 to September 2011 at our institution. Stroke was defined according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium recommendations. Its cause was established by analyzing the point of onset of symptoms, correlating the symptoms with the computed tomography-detected defects in the brain, and analyzing the presence of potential coexisting causes of stroke, in addition to a multivariate analysis to determine the independent predictors. Stroke occurred in 19 patients (9%) and was major in 10 (5%), minor in 3 (1%), and transient (transient ischemic attack) in 6 (3%). The onset of symptoms was early (≤24 hours) in 8 patients (42%) and delayed (>24 hours) in 11 (58%). Brain computed tomography showed a cortical infarct in 8 patients (42%), a lacunar infarct in 5 (26%), hemorrhage in 1 (5%), and no abnormalities in 5 (26%). Independent determinants of stroke were new-onset atrial fibrillation after TAVI (odds ratio 4.4, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 15.6), and baseline aortic regurgitation grade III or greater (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 9.3).\n\nIn conclusion, the incidence of stroke was 9%, of which >1/2 occurred >24 hours after the procedure. New-onset atrial fibrillation was associated with a 4.4-fold increased risk of stroke. In conclusion, these findings indicate that improvements in postoperative care after TAVI are equally, if not more, important for the reduction of peri-procedural stroke than preventive measures during the procedure.\n\nSinning JM, Hammerstingl C, Vasa-Nicotera M, Adenauer V, Lema Cachiguango SJ, Scheer AC, Hausen S, Sedaghat A, Ghanem A, Müller C, Grube E,Nickenig G, Werner N.

J Am Coll Cardiol. 2012 Mar 27;59(13):1134-41. [full abstract provided].\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\nThe aim of this study was to provide a simple, reproducible, and point-of-care assessment of peri-prosthetic aortic regurgitation (periAR) during trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and to decipher the impact of this peri-procedural parameter on outcome.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nBecause periAR after TAVI might be associated with adverse outcome, precise quantification of periAR is of paramount importance but remains technically challenging.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nThe severity of periAR was prospectively evaluated in 146 patients treated with the Medtronic CoreValve (Minneapolis, Minnesota) prosthesis by echocardiography, angiography, and measurement of the aortic regurgitation (AR) index, which is calculated as ratio of the gradient between diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) to systolic blood pressure (SBP): [(DBP – LVEDP)/SBP] × 100.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nAfter TAVI, 53 patients (36.3%) showed no signs of periAR and 71 patients (48.6%) showed only mild periAR, whereas 18 patients (12.3%) and 4 patients (2.7%) suffered from moderate and severe periAR, respectively. The AR index decreased stepwise from 31.7 ± 10.4 in patients without periAR, to 28.0 ± 8.5 with mild periAR, 19.6 ± 7.6 with moderate periAR, and 7.6 ± 2.6 with severe periAR (p < 0.001), respectively. Patients with AR index <25 had a significantly increased 1-year mortality risk compared with patients with AR index ≥25 (46.0% vs. 16.7%; p < 0.001). The AR index provided additional prognostic information beyond the echocardiographically assessed severity of periAR and independently predicted 1-year mortality (hazard ratio: 2.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 6.4; p = 0.009).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe assessment of the AR index allows a precise judgment of periAR, independently predicts 1-year mortality after TAVI, and provides additional prognostic information that is complementary to the echocardiographically assessed severity of periAR.\n\nGotzmann M, Lindstaedt M, Mügge A. (2012). From pressure overload to volume overload: Aortic regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Am Heart J. 2012 Jun;163(6):903-11. [full abstract provided].\n\nSevere aortic valve stenosis is a common valvular heart disease that is characterized by left ventricular (LV) pressure overload. A lasting effect of pressure overload is LV remodeling, accompanied by concentric hypertrophy and increased myocardial stiffness. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis and high surgical risk. Although TAVI has favorable hemodynamic performance, aortic valve regurgitation (AR) is the most frequent complication because of the specific technique used for implantation of transcatheter valves.\n\nDuring implantation, the calcified native valve is pushed aside, and the prosthesis usually achieves only an incomplete prosthesis apposition. As a consequence, the reported prevalence of moderate and severe AR after TAVI is 6% to 21%, which is considerably higher than that after a surgical valve replacement. Although mild AR probably has minor hemodynamic effects, even moderate AR might result in serious consequences. In moderate and severe AR after TAVI, a normal-sized LV with increased myocardial stiffness has been exposed to volume overload. Because the noncompliant LV is unable to raise end-diastolic volume, the end-diastolic pressure increases, and the forward stroke volume decreases. In recent years, an increasing number of patients have successfully undergone TAVI. Despite encouraging overall results, a substantial number of patients receive neither symptomatic nor prognostic benefits from TAVI. Aortic valve regurgitation has been considered a potential contributor to morbidity and mortality after TAVI. Therefore, various strategies and improvements in valve designs are mandatory to reduce the prevalence of AR after TAVI.\n\nWalther T , Thielmann M, Kempfert J, Schroefel H, Wimmer-Greinecker G, Treede H, Wahlers T, Wendler O.

Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2012 Aug;42(2):278-83. Epub 2012 Jan 30. [full abstract provided].\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nTransapical (TA- aortic valve implantation (AVI) has evolved as an alternative procedure for high-risk patients. We evaluated the second-generation SAPIEN xt ™ prosthesis in a prospective multicentre clinical trial.\n\nMETHODS\n\nA total of 150 patients (age : 81.6; 40.7 % female) were included. Prosthetic valves (diameter :23 mm (n= 36), 26 mm (n= 57) and 29 mm (n= 57) were implanted. The ASCENDRA-II™ modified delivery system was used in the smaller sizes. Mean logistic EuroSCORE was 24.3% and mean STS score was 7.5 ± 4.4%. All patients gave written informed consent.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nOff-pump AVI was performed using femoral arterial and venous access as a safety net. All but two patients receivec TA-AVI, as planned. The 29-mm valve showed similar function as the values of two other diameters did. Three patients (2%) required temporary bypass support.\n\nPostoperative complications included renal failure requiring long-term dialysis in four, bleeding requiring re-thoracotomy in four, respiratory complication requiring re-intubation in eight and septsis in four patients, respectively.\n\nThirty day mortality was 13 ( 8.7%) for the total cohort and 2/57 (3.5%) receiving the 29 mm valve respectively. Echocardiography at discharge showed none or trivial incompetence (AI) in 71% and mild-AI in 22% of the patients. Post-implantation AI was predominantly para-valvular and > 2+ in 7% of patients. One patient required re-operation for AI within 30 days.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe PREVAIL TA multicenter trial demonstrates good functionality and good outcomes for TA-AVI, using the SAPIEN xt ™ and its second generation ASCENDRA-II™ delivery system, as well successful introduction of the 29-mm SAPIEN XT ™ valve for the benefit of high-risk elderly patients.\n\nSubramanian S, Rastan AJ, Holzhey D, Haensig M, Kempfert J, Borger MA, Walther T, Mohr FW. (2012). Conventional Aortic Valve Replacement in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Candidates: A 5-Year Experience. Ann Thorac Surg. July 19 2012 [full abstract provided].\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nPatient selection for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains highly controversial. Some screened patients subsequently undergo conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) because they are unsuitable TAVI candidates. This study examined the indications and outcomes for these patients, thereby determining the efficacy of the screening process.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nBetween January 2006 and December 2010, 79 consecutive patients (49% men), aged older than 75 years with high surgical risk, were screened for TAVI, but subsequently underwent conventional AVR through a partial or complete sternotomy. The indications, demographics, and outcomes of this cohort were studied.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nMean age was 80.4 ± 3.6 years. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.55 ± 0.16, and the mean logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation was 13% ± 7%. Of the 79 patients, 6 (7.6%) had prior cardiac surgical procedures. Indications for TAVI denial after patient evaluations were a large annulus in 31 (39%), acceptable risk profile for AVR in 24 (30%), need for urgent operation in 11 (14%), and concomitant cardiovascular pathology in 5 (6%). Mean cross-clamp time was 55 ± 14 minutes, and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 81 ± 21 minutes. Concomitant procedures included a Maze in 12 patients (15%). Postoperative morbidity included permanent stroke in 2 (2.5%), respiratory failure in 9 (11%), and pacemaker implantation in 2 (2.5%). Hospital mortality was 1.3% (1 of 79). Cumulative survival at 6, 12, and 36 months was 88.5%, 87.1% and 72.7%, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nOur existing patient evaluation process accurately defines an acceptable risk cohort for conventional AVR. The late mortality rate reflects the advanced age and comorbidities of this cohort. The data suggest that overzealous widening of TAVI inclusion criteria may be inappropriate.\n\nIndustry fights back\n\nNow it looks like Edwards Lifesciences, the company that manufacturers the Sapien valve is speaking out to dispute recent findings that show TAVI to have less than optimal results. Of course, the author at the site, Med Latest says it best, “Setting aside the conflict of interest stuff, which might be a red-herring, what we’re left with is a situation where evidence-based medicine, while being something all would sign up to, is not that straightforward.”\n\n[1] Several cardiologists and cardiac surgeons contributed to this article. However, given the current politics within cardiology, none of these experts were willing to risk their reputations by publically disputing the majority opinion. This is certainly understandable in today’s medico-legal climate in wake of widespread scandals and credibility issues. However, all quotes are accurate, even if unattributable with minor formatting (such as the addition of quotations, and paragraph headings have been added for increased clarity of reading in blog format.) I apologize for the ‘anonymous nature’ of my sources in this instance – however, I can assure you that these ‘experts’ know what they are talking about.\n\n[All commentary by Cartagena Surgery are in italics and brackets].\n\nAs reported by heartwire, and a savvy reader, Lapeyre here at Cartagena Surgery, the FDA has gone ahead and approved TAVI/ TAVR for patients that are eligible for open surgery. [We must think alike, as I was drafting this post when I received the reader mail].\n\nDespite the FDA’s previously cited concerns over the excessive stroke rate with the Sapien device (as discussed in the article re-posted below) – the FDA approved the use of this therapy as an alternative to surgery on June 13th.\n\nNow we can sit back and watch as the up selling of this device to the public as news hits the US media and the television advertisements begin. Soon this device will crowd out surgery as interventionalists cite “patient refused surgery” as the criteria for implantation, no matter what the best interest of the patient really is. I wonder if they will even disclose the heightened stroke rate when they start implanting this into patients at a much higher rate. Of the 12 members of the FDA panel, only one member voted against the expansion criteria.\n\nAs reported by Shelley Wood in a follow-up Heartwire article , only Dr Valluvan Jeevanandam spoke out against expanding the criteria for use, stating, “I think this is a very good technology, and it gives us an alternative to AVR surgery, and I’m sure the device will continue to get better,” Jeevanandam, a cardiovascular surgeon, told heartwire after the meeting.\n\n“However, at the current time, compared with standard AVR, this device has a higher stroke rate and a high rate of aortic insufficiency, did not meet the criteria for noninferiority* in males, and has a high incidence of vascular complications.”\n\nThese are all issues that need to be very clearly explained to patients as part of the informed-consent process, he stressed. Otherwise, patients who are “enamored at the idea of avoiding a sternotomy” may not fully understand these risks.”\n\nI fully concur with Dr. Valluvan Jeevanandam except that I might re-phase the term ‘enamored of.’ Actually, I think our so-called peers need to quit coercing patients by intentionally scaring them – in order to bill more procedures out of them. [Don’t believe it? Then check out Mark Midei and our overstenting archives.]\n\nI will continue to champion well-established therapies with strong long term data. I know this will get me labeled as ‘old-fashioned’ (or worse) but as we’ve seen in cardiology – numerous times; easy is not always the best answer..\n\nYes, conventional surgery hurts – it’s not glamorous, it’s not pretty. But it’s (statistically) darn safe these days, and most of the surgeons doing it have done it thousands of times.. Even the bioprosthetic valves have a long durability than previously thought – meaning not everyone has to take warfarin..\n\nWe shouldn’t exploit people’s fears of surgery to use quasi-experimental procedures, no matter how “cool” they sound..\n\n* I hope readers remember that ‘noninferiority’ is a lesser standard that superior to, or even EQUAL to..\n\nFDA flags strokes, trial conduct, as TAVI maker seeks expanded role for Sapien – from Heartwire.com (Shelley Wood).\n\nGaithersburg, MD – A higher risk of stroke and differences in how patients randomized to different procedures were actually treated and evaluated within the PARTNER A trial, which compared transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) with surgery, are issues the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hopes its expert advisors can help clarify in weighing the pros and cons of expanding approval of the Sapien transcatheter valve (Edwards Lifesciences) [1,2]. Those issues and others are detailed in an FDA briefing document, posted online today, that the agency’s Circulatory System Devices Panel will consider in advance of Wednesday’s meeting.\n\nAs previously reported by heartwire, the FDA last year reviewed and subsequently approved the Sapien valve and transfemoral delivery system in patients not suited to open-valve replacement, based primarily on the PARTNER B results. Wednesday’s meeting, drawing heavily on the PARTNER A results, will help the FDA decide whether to expand approval to high-risk patients who are surgery eligible and whether to approve the transapical approach also tested in PARTNER A.\n\nIn briefing documents posted online today, the FDA directed its advisors to pay special attention to a number of issues relating to trial conduct as well as patient outcomes.\n\nIn particular, the FDA review cites the “doubling” of neurological events seen in the Sapien-treated patients in the first 30 days postprocedure, with a higher stroke rate seen among transapical as compared with the transfemoral group.\n\nThe FDA documents also query “attempt-to-treat” decisions, including the higher number of patients randomized to surgery in whom no treatment was attempted; longer delays to treatment in surgical patients; and the higher number of concomitant operations seen in the surgical aortic-valve-replacement group—all factors that could have influenced adverse-event and survival rates in this group.\n\nFDA is also asking its expert panel to weigh in on whether both the transfemoral and transapical approaches should be approved, given the numerically higher mortality in the transapically treated patients as compared with the transfemorally treated patients in the device arm.\n\nGeneral questions the FDA panel will be answering Wednesday include those related to the issues above, as well as to different outcomes seen in men and women, the importance of paravalvular regurgitation seen in patients treated with TAVI, valve durability, the required anticoagulation/antiplatelet regimen, and obtaining true informed consent.\n\nVoting questions center on whether the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy and whether the benefits of the new device outweigh the risks.\n\nIndustry analysts reading the tea leaves in the FDA’s review see the agency’s briefing document as largely promising, with Wells Fargo’s Larry Biegelsen predicting a “tough day, but positive panel outcome” and JP Morgan’s Michael Weinstein stating that the FDA synopsis contained “no major surprises; positive outcome expected.”\n\nIn other cardiology news,\n\nNew guidelines recommend the discontinuation of prasugrel a full seven days before surgery to prevent catastrophic bleeding complications. (The cynical side of me expects to see a bigger push by the industry to use prasugrel now that clopidogrel is generic.) Expect to see a couple more “Ask your doctor” ads..\n\nNote: I owe Dr. Vasquez a much more detailed article – which I am currently writing – but after our intellectually stimulating talk the other day, my mind headed off in it’s own direction..\n\nHad a great sit down lunch and a fascinating talk with Dr. Vasquez. As per usual – our discussion was lively, (a bit more lively than usual) which really got my gears turning. Dr. Vasquez is a talented surgeon – but he could be even better with just a little ‘help’. No – I am not trying to sell him a nurse practitioner – instead I am trying to sell Mexicali, and a comprehensive cardiac surgery program to the communities on both sides of the border.. Mexicali really could be the ‘land of opportunity’ for medical care – if motivated people and corporations got involved.\n\nDuring lunch, Dr. Vasquez was explaining that there is no real ‘heart hospital’ or cardiac surgery program, per se in Mexicali – he just operates where ever his patients prefer. In the past that has included Mexicali General, Issstecali (the public hospitals) as well as the tiny but more upscale private facilities such as Hospital Alamater, and Hospital de la Familia..\n\nNot such a big deal if you are a plastic surgeon doing a nip/tuck here and there, or some outpatient procedures – okay even for general surgeons – hernia repairs and such – but less than ideal for a cardiac surgeon – who is less of a ‘lone wolf’ due to the nature and scale of cardiac surgery procedures..\n\nCardiac surgery differs from other specialties in its reliance on a cohesive, well-trained and experienced group – not one surgeon – but a whole team of people to look out for the patients; Before, During & After surgery.. That team approach [which includes perfusionists, cardiac anesthesiologists (more specialized than regular anesthesia), operating room personnel, cardiology interventionalists and specialty training cardiac surgery intensive care nurses] is not easily transported from facility to facility.\n\nThat’s just the people involved; it doesn’t even touch on all the specialty equipment; such as the bypass pump itself, echocardiogram equipment, Impella/ IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump), ECMO or other equipment for the critically ill – or even just the infrastructure needed to support a heart team – like a pharmacy division that knows that ‘right now’ in the cardiac OR means five minutes ago, or a blood bank with an adequate stock of platelets, FFP and a wide range of other blood products..\n\nWe haven’t even gotten into such things such as a hydrid operating rooms and 24/7 caths labs – all the things you need for urgent/ emergent cases, endovascular interventions – things a city the size of Mexicali should really have..\n\nBut all of those things take money – and commitment, and I’m just not sure that the city of Mexicali is ready to commit to supporting Dr. Vasquez (and the 20 – something cases he’s done this year..) It also takes vision..\n\nThis is where a company/ corporation could come in and really change things – not just for Dr. Vasquez – and Mexicali – but for California..\n\nIt came to me again while I was in the operating room with Dr. Vasquez – watching him do what he does best – which is sometimes when I do what I do best.. (I have some of my best ideas in the operating room – where I tend to be a bit quieter.. More thinking, less talking)..\n\nAs I am watching Dr. Vasquez – I starting thinking about all the different cardiac surgery programs I’ve been to: visited, worked in – trained in.. About half of these programs were small – several were tiny, single surgeon programs a lot like his.. (You only need one great surgeon.. It’s all the other niceties that make or break a program..)\n\nAll of the American programs had the advantages of all the equipment / specialty trained staff that money could buy***\n\n[I know what you are thinking – “well – but isn’t it all of these ‘niceties’ that make everything cost so darn much?” No – actually it’s not – which is how the Cardioinfantils, and Santa Fe de Bogotas can still make a profit offering world-class services at Colombian prices…]\n\nThe cost of American programs are inflated due to the cost of defensive medicine practices (and lawyers), and the costs of medications/ equipment in the United States****\n\nWell – there is plenty of money in Calexico, California** and not a hospital in sight – just a one room ‘urgent care center’. The closest facility is in El Centro, California – and while it boasts a daVinci robot, and a (part-time?) heart surgeon (based out of La Mesa, California – 100 + miles away)– patients usually end up being transferred to San Diego for surgery.\n\nOf course, in addition to all of the distance – there is also all of the expense.. So what’s a hard-working, blue-collar guy from Calexico with severe CAD going to do? It seems the easiest and most logical thing – would be to walk/ drive/ head across the street to Mexicali.. (If only Kaiser Permanente or Blue Cross California would step up and spearhead this project – we could have the best of both worlds – for residents of both cities..\n\nA fully staffed, well-funded, well-designed, cohesive heart program in ONE medium- sized Mexicali facility – without the exorbitant costs of an American program (from defensive medicine practices, and outlandish American salaries.) Not only that – but as a side benefit, there are NO drug shortages here..\n\nHow many ‘cross-border’ cases would it take to bring a profit to the investors? I don’t know – but I’m sure once word got out – people would come from all over Southern California and Arizona – as well as Mexicali, other parts of Baja, and even places in Sonora like San Luis – which is closer to Mexicali than Hermasillo.. Then Dr. Vasquez could continue to do what he does so well – operate – but on a larger scale, without worrying about resources, or having to bring a suitcase full of equipment to the OR.\n\nThe Mexican – American International Cardiac Health Initiative?\n\nBut then – this article isn’t really about the ‘Mexican- American cross-border cardiac health initiative’ –\n\nIt is about a young, kind cardiac surgeon – with a vision of his own.\n\nThat vision brought Dr. Vasquez from his home in Guadalajara (the second largest city in Mexico) to one of my favorite places, Mexicali after graduating from the Universidad Autonomica in Guadalajara, and completing much of his training "
