Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, QIAGEN has acquired the major assets of MSI (which include over 160 applied or issued patents) for $US28.5 million in cash plus potential earn-outs of up to $US6.75 million. MSI, a privately held company, has developed a range of proprietary products and services based on its Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) technology. The key application of MDA is whole genome amplification (WGA). WGA is distinct from PCR since it allows nonspecific amplification of the complete genome to create more DNA for analyses, whereas PCR amplifies only specific, mostly very short stretches of DNA matching a predefined target sequence and is designed to detect specific sequences. The two technologies, WGA and PCR, are therefore often synergistic as samples can be pretreated with WGA to create sufficient sample amount for many subsequent analyses using PCR and other downstream applications. QIAGEN intends to launch a series of kits integrating MSI’s WGA technology to address specific customer needs in early 2005. QIAGEN also acquired MSI’s technology portfolio related to rolling circle amplification (RCA), which includes the exclusive rights to use this technology for protein applications. QIAGEN expects that products arising from this technology can target applications for both nucleic acids and proteins. The company has a website at http://www.qiagen.com/.\n\nQuintiles Transnational of Research Triangle Park, NC, has completed the previously announced sale of assets relating to its specialty dermatology products company Bioglan Pharmaceuticals.
