        "text": "During Colombia Moda, I met several American business people looking for more information about fabric and textiles than the small booths could provide. Many of them wanted to go out and see the fabrics, some of the shops and the factories but no one thought to take them to see any of these things. All of the people I met were first-time visitors to Medellin (and some may never be back). I can’t help with factory tours (I’d like to see those myself) but I do live nearby, so I thought maybe I could help provide some information for future visitors to this fair city. Since I thought wandering around El Centro as a first-time visitor without a guide might be a little daunting, this post might help people feel more comfortable. So I spent all day Saturday wandering around the district – to take pictures and be able to provide more information to people interested in finding fabrics and materials while in Medellin.\n\nA note about Fabric shopping in Medellin: If you are looking for super cheap – crazy bargains, you probably won’t find them here. But you will find a huge array of all kinds of fabric – most of it made right here in the city. For someone like myself who is sometimes (okay, frequently) frustrated by the lack of floor space given to apparel fabrics in the United States – (where it seems like 90% of fabric is for quilting and such), it’s still a bonanza.\n\nAlso, while it isn’t made in the USA (which is increasingly rare, I know) – I still feel a bit of loyalty towards buying locally sourced items – even if Medellin is that source. Still interested? Good.\n\nHow to get here – the real Medellin\n\nThe best fabric and general shopping in Medellin isn’t in the fancy malls of El Poblado and Enviagado. It’s in the busy, teeming streets of El Centro. El Centro is also where many of the most famous tourist attractions are, so if you are interested in seeing some of the famous architecture, the Botero collection (at the Museo de Antioquia) – you can do that too. El Poblado and Enviagado are the rich, sanitized versions of Medellin – so if you have friends that aren’t interested in shopping but would like to see more of Medellin – this is a trip to take them on…\n\n1. Taxi – if you want to take a taxi, ask him to take you to the Plaza Botero. It’s a few streets away from your destination, but it’s a nice central space – especially good if you are meeting friends or other visitors.\n\n2. Metro Train – the metro train is cheap, clean and quite reliable. It’s also a good way to see a bit of the city. Take the (blue line) train to either Parque Berrio station or the San Antonio station. San Antonio is closer to shopping, but Parque Berrio puts you right at the Plaza. (For more information about the Metro, see this helpful article at Medellin Living).\n\nGet a map – Now, I know this is a digital age, but sometimes a paper map is just easier.. Safer too because it makes you less of a target for thieves who prey on upscale tourists for all of our fancy electronic devices.\n\nThere are several of these kiosks located in/ around Plaza Botero and around the Parque Berrio station. Just ask for a map “Mapa, por favor” and they will be happy to provide you with a free map of Medellin. I used this same map for reference for the shopping areas, to make it easy for visitors to recognize where to go.\n\nNavigating the city Places like Medellin and Bogotá are particularly easy to navigate because streets use numbers, not names for the most part. (Once you get used to the system – our system of street naming in the USA seems needlessly confusing.) Everything is basically on a grid – Calles run in one direction and are abbreviated as Cll. Carreras run in a perpendicular direction and are often abbreviated as Cr. It makes locating a business very easy. For example, my favorite fabric store in Medellin is Textiles El Faison – and their address is Calle 49 #53 – 101. This means that they are located on Calle 49, about 101 meters from the cross-street, Carerra 53.\n\nNow that you are here – with your map Walk south towards Calle 49. (To orient yourself – remember that Medellin is set in the foothills. If you start walking uphill, you are heading East (the wrong direction) – towards the financial center of Medellin (near where I usually stay). On Calle 49 – turn West (or downwards on a very slight grade) The next several streets will be crammed with shops filled with all kinds of sewing related items – thread stores, fabric stores, sewing machine repair etc.\n\nMany of the shops look tiny compared to JoAnn’s or the big craft stores you may be used to. Sometimes they are tiny – but sometimes, it’s just the entrance to a larger indoor mall.\n\nFabric\n\nNow, the fabric stores line Calle 49 and many of the cross-streets.. But sometimes notions can be a bit trickier to track down. A lot of tiny shops sell just one product – like elastic or ribbon trims, buttons and the like.\n\nAs I mentioned before, my favorite fabric store from my wandering on Saturday – is Textiles El Faison. It’s a big store, and not quite as claustrophobic feeling as some of the smaller shops. (When the shops are crowded, and the fabric piled to the ceilings, I get a bit closed in feeling in some of the smaller shops..) Not that this would prevent me – if I saw ‘the fabric’ there.\n\nLots of great stuff- but limited luggage space, so I move on to the next ones.\n\nBut for general browsing, or to see fabric in a shop more like what most of us are used to – Textiles El Faison is a well-lit two story shop. Jaime Sosa is the manager there – and he is very nice and helpful. My photos are a bit blurry because I was relying on my small phone (an older model) because I don’t like lugging my fancy Nikon down to El Centro).\n\nHere’s the address for people who want to skip the adventures and go straight to his shop:\n\nTextiles El Faison Calle 49 No 53 – 101 Medellin\n\nBut that’s not the only great place.. I really liked Portofino Textil too.. It’s located on the ground floor of a little textile mall. (It’s a very interesting mall – about half the shops sell custom printed fabrics).\n\nI was trying to cover a lot of ground, so I didn’t stop in and get all the details on custom printing – even though I saw little storefronts printing the fabric during my wandering. (Maybe I will get a chance to go back and ask some questions.) Custom may be the wrong word since most of it seems to be more like “Small lot pop prints” but at one shop, I did see a customer hand over a jump drive filled with images for printing). But some of the other shops / kiosks didn’t look to have computers just their own style of pop prints (justin beiber, popular artists, other cool designs).\n\nPortofino Portofino has more of a warehouse feel – and a two meter minimum. Fabric is priced by the kilogram. I couldn’t resist one of the fabrics there – and my two meters of this lightweight lycra was 0.7kg in total. For an example on prices – the tag on the bolt said 45,000 per kilogram but advertised a discount.. After the discount, my fabric total 27,156. tax added a bit – for a total of 28,350 for my two meters of a 60 inch (or there about width). According to today’s exchange rate – that’s about $15.35 (or around 7.50 a yard since a meter is a couple of inches more.) So, like I said – not a crazy, amazing deal – except that I love the fabric, it was made right here, and it’s certainly not something I’d find at Hancocks or Joanns (if we even had one in my town). It’s actually located under another fabric store but I found it to have better selection, and salespeople that were very helpful and friendly. (Fabien was particularly nice – and patient with my limited Spanish).\n\nPortfino Textil #162 Carrera 53 No. 49 – 68 Medellin There were quite a few other shops – so you will just have to make you way down Calle 49 and find your own favorites. Patterns Pattern magazines can be especially hard to find – but when you do find them – they are a great deal.. Most pattern books contain anywhere from 20 to 200 patterns. It depends on the magazine. My favorites are Bianca, Quili and the more simply named Patrones. Bianca has a lot of the patterns that are hard to find in the United States – like an extended variety of swimwear, lingerie and exercise apparel. They also have a great assortment of patterns made for the new stretchy fabrics; lycra blends and modal.\n\nPatrones is a grand brand because it has copies of a lot of the designs by major labels. Want to wear your own Dolce & Gabbana? Then patrones is the magazine for you. Sometimes you can find the magazines at larger newsstands or bookstores like Panoamericano. Some of the patterns in Patrones are pretty intricate and instructions are limited (and in Spanish) but at 4,000 to 10,000 pesos (2.25 to about 6 dollars) a book – if you are an experienced sewer it is still quite the find.) Now – for patterns on Calle 49 – the best place to go is – this little shop..\n\nThe place is tiny, so you have to ask to see the pattern books (or point, if necessary.) They don’t have long aisles to browse like some of the bigger bookstores. But the owner is very sweet – and they have a large array of titles available.\n\nYarns\n\nNow, Medellin has that ‘perpetual spring’ climate we have been talking about, so I didn’t find as many places offering the bulky and superbulky yarns that I love. Quite a few thread stores offered the smaller crochet threads and yarns similar to Lily’s Sugar N’ Cream but since I am on a superbulky yarn kick – I will keep looking.. I did see a couple, but shame on me because I didn’t write down exact addresses or take pictures (but since one of them is on a street close to home, I may venture out later this week – when I’ve exhausted my current supply and get some pics.)\n\nNow before you head out for your shopping adventure – review a few things to make your shopping more enjoyable and safe.\n\nIn Medellin – alone or not quite ready to venture into El Centro by yourself?\n\nI am always up and willing to lend a hand – if I am in the city. (It’s a good guess if I am blogging about Medellin, then you can find me here.) You can always call me/ text me at 301-706-3929 (If I am not in Colombia, I won’t answer) or email me at k.eckland@gmail.com I’d be happy to arrange to get together for a day tour of the shopping areas. We can check out museums, eat some tasty street food, buy local produce, window shop – or hunt down that one special piece of fabric you’ve been waiting for..\n\nIf you don’t catch me on this trip – I’ll be back.. I’ll definitely be back for Colombia Moda 2015, so if you come a few days early (in July) we can have some fun.\n\nNow that it’s over, I can say it’s been another wonderful week at Colombia Moda: I met Miss Colombia (she seems sweet) and took a picture of the President of the Republic..\n\nDidn’t get to meet President Santos, but maybe someday. (I promise not to talk politics.)\n\nLuis Martin\n\nI even say hello to one of the models (since we were heading down the hallway) and we had a nice conversation. It’s funny – I guess I always get intimidated by people taller than me, etc.. and I guess sometimes the expectation is just that models aren’t that nice.. But nothing could be farther from the truth. Luis Martin – a local model from a neighborhood here in Medellin was very nice, sweet and pleasant. It must be weird for him – I mean, his face is really familiar to me – after two years of seeing it thru my lens..\n\nI wish we hadn’t be racing down a hallway – I would have liked to get a photo because he looks better in his own clothes..(Better sense of style). Anyway, I thought it was nice of him to make conversation with a random gringa.. (We talked about Virginia of all things). So – I wish him the best luck, and hope he makes the cover of Vogue one of these days.\n\nLast day of Moda\n\nYesterday was the last day at Colombia Moda, and I don’t have enough nice things to say about all of the photographers and videographers there. They are the reason I came back this year. Instead of treating me as an outsider, they have always been welcoming and kind.\n\nThis year it was great to be back and see old friends like Stiven and Fredrico. I didn’t see some of the wonderful people from last year, like Estaban who kept me in laughter and good humor even when every bone in my body ached from long hours in contorted positions.\n\nThis year, I have to give special thanks and words of gratitude to the videographers of Une Canal (Channel One) of Medellin. Une Canal is the public television station for the city and during fashion week, they record live from the runway so it can be seen on big screens outside (so people without access to the runway itself can see it as it happens.) That means they are at every single catwalk – always smiling, joking and being friendly even while setting up cameras, untangling cables etc…\n\nThe Videographers of Une Canal\n\nThat’s the handsome Juan Carlos, the charming Danilo Gallego and the ever kind Hernan. For the entire fashion week, they allowed (and encouraged) me to take one of the plum floor positions beneath their cameras – in the dead center position of the runway.\n\nPeople with better equipment than my starter Nikon can take sitting positions and even rise up on the press bleachers, but without this prime spot on the floor – I’d have been toast. I never would have been able to capture 1/10th of the images that I’ve used in my recent articles.\n\nI’d love to do a real (in-depth) articles on the videographers and photographers here at Moda, but it looks like I’ve already been scooped which I think it really cool. Yesterday, the reporter from Une canal turned the tables of the videographers and interviewed them before one of the runways.\n\nI am hoping to see Juan Carlos, Danilo and Stiven at some future events here in Medellin before I leave in August.. If not – I’ll see you next year!\n\nI met Dr. Betancourt Parra at IQ interquirofanos while observing surgery with Dr. Luis Botero,. Dr. Betancourt was friendly, and immediately amendable to an interview but it took a little while to coördinate our schedules.\n\nIn person, he reminds me a bit of Dr.Carlos Ochoa Gaxiola, the kind and talented Mexican surgeon who graciously permitted me to study with him at Hospital General de Mexicali for several months while writing the Mexicali book.\n\nMaybe it was his laid-back and open conversational style, or the braces on his teeth, giving him a bit of boyish charm that belies his years of experience. Maybe it was his enthusiasm for his work, but whatever it was, I found the discussion to be especially informative and interesting.\n\nAesthetic plastic and reconstructive surgery\n\nDr. Betancourt is a plastic surgeon in Medellin. He performs a wide range of aesthetic and reconstructive plastic surgery including corporal (body) and facial procedures such as rhinoplasty (nose), face-lifts, blepharoplasty (eyelid lift), breast augmentation, liposuction etc. but his true love is post-bariatric surgery procedures.\n\nHe also performs reconstructive surgery such as breast reconstruction after breast cancer.\n\nPost-bariatric practice\n\nPost-bariatric surgery is a subspecialty area of plastic surgery (reconstructive surgery). Many of these patients have lost very large amounts of weight (100+ pounds) and have large amounts of sagging, drooping and excess skin.\n\nThis skin is more than aesthetically displeasing – it can also contribute to the development of skin irritations such as intertriginous dermatitis and infections. It is particularly prone to causing problems for females – due to an excess build up of moisture, and friction in the genital areas. It can also make simple tasks like showering, getting dressed and cleaning after using the bathroom difficult. Patients sometimes have to “tuck” loose skin from the abdomen into support garments to prevent this skin from slipping down to their thighs. This excess of skin (and the resultant movement/ friction) can prevent people from participating in normal activities like exercise.\n\nThe psychological impact of the appearance of, and the challenges of daily living can be extremely distressing – especially for someone who have spent months or years trying to lose weight.\n\nThe group of procedures used to treat this problem is called “Body contouring”. For the majority of patients – this body contouring process will require several months and several separate surgeries.\n\nBody Contouring\n\nOne of the primary procedures for body contouring is called a “lower body lift/ /belt lipectomy/ torsoplasty”. This is actually two separate but very similar techniques; with the belt lipectomy being a modified lower body lift procedure. However, they are often grouped together to simplify discussions about body contouring procedures. The lower body lift or belt lipectomy is usually one of the first procedures as part of the reconstructive process after massive weight loss.\n\nThis procedure is the core procedure – which removes the majority of excess skin and tissue which is usually in the abdominal/ torso area. This is a dramatic and large surgical procedure which I liken to “the open heart surgery of plastic surgery.” This procedure can take 2 to 6 hours, and often requires a 1 to 2 night hospital stay.\n\nThe remaining procedures are more of a ‘fine tuning;, as they are smaller procedures with lesser effects as they are aimed at smaller, more specific areas of the body. These procedures include brachioplexy to remove excess skin (aka “batwings”) from the upper arm/ bicep area, reduction mammoplasty to remove excess skin and drooping from the breast area, or a thighoplasty, to remove excess skin from the thighs/ upper legs.\n\nOne year minimum wait after bariatric surgery\n\nDr. Betancourt requires a minimum of one year after bariatric surgery before patients begin considering body contouring procedures.\n\nThis is important for two reasons:\n\n1. Patient’s weight should be stable prior to performing surgical procedures.\n\n2. This period gives patients a chance to adjust to their new weight. Several studies have demonstrated that it may take months to years to adjust the mind’s eye (mental image) to a person’s actual appearance.\n\nFor an excellent article by Salwar & Fabricatore (2008) on the psychological considerations for patients after massive weight loss – click here.\n\nMirror versus mind’s eye\n\nThis is why many people literally “do not see” recent changes in our weight / appearance (particularly subtle/ small changes) when looking in the mirror. However, as time passes, the mind’s perception of our image/ appearance usually changes to accommodate changes in our ‘real’ appearance – whether weight loss/ gain, signs of aging (fine lines, wrinkles) or even the loss of a limb or appendage.\n\nWhen the mental / mirror image “mismatch” is dramatic, long-lasting, accompanied by depression/ anxiety or leads to dangerous practices like anorexia, hypergymnasia or self-mutilation – it is called body dismorphic disorder (BDD). Patients who have successfully adjusted to their new size and appearance are much more likely to have realistic expectations, be satisfied with surgical outcomes and be able to maintain their weight over the long-term.\n\nDr. Betancourt explained that he enjoys the intellectual challenges of caring for post-bariatric surgery patients for several reasons. These patients, often differ greatly from the majority of plastic surgery patients due to the presence of multiple co-morbid conditions relating to their previous obesity. Patients may also have body image issues following the initial bariatric surgery as they adjust to their new bodies. These patients may require multiple procedures for a complete reconstruction, making treatment a somewhat lengthy process.\n\nDr. Betancourt states that this is what makes it so gratifying; to be able to provide patients with dramatic body changes, help improve their self-image and enable patients to successfully adjust to their new lives. He also finds it very rewarding because of the high level of patient satisfaction after these procedures.\n\nThese patients account for approximately 1/3 of his practice.\n\nEducation and Training\n\nDr. Betancourt has been a plastic surgeon for twelve years. For eleven years, he worked in a public hospital, Manuel Uribe Angel in Enviagado, providing reconstructive surgery services to all patients at all socio-economic levels in Antioquia, Colombia . For the last several years, he has devoted a significant portion of his practice to the sub-specialty of post-bariatric surgery. He has attended several post-bariatric surgery conferences to learn new techniques and exchange ideas with many of the leaders in the field including Dr. Alaly (USA), Jean François Pascal (France) and Dr. Ricardo Baroudi (Brazil).\n\nDr. Betancourt attended medical school at Universidad CES (University of Health Sciences) and graduated in 1993. He is currently a professor at CES.\n\nHe competed in general surgical residency at the public hospital, Hospital Ipiranga in Sao Paulo, Brazil before completing his plastic surgery fellowship at the Universidad Santo Amaro, (in Sao Paulo, Brazil).\n\nHe is a member of the Colombian Society of Plastic Surgery (SCCP), as well as the Brazilian Society of Plastic Surgery.\n\nDr. Betancourt speaks Portuguese and English in addition to his native Spanish. He reports some trepidation with his English but was readily able to communicate with me without difficulties.\n\nDr. Juan David Betancourt Parra\n\nTorre de Especialistas Intermedica\n\n# 1816\n\nCalle 7 No.39 – 137\n\nMedellin\n\nTele: 352 0264\n\nEmail: plasticjdb1@une.net.co\n\nWebsite: www.plasticjbd.com\n\nInternational Patients\n\nWhile the majority of Dr.Betancourt’s patients are from the local area, he does see international patients. After an initial contact by email, or via his internet page, Dr.Betancourt solicits a complete medical history including previous surgical reports (from previous bariatric or plastic surgery procedures) and current photos. Patients will also need to have blood work, and EKG as part of the pre-operative evaluation. Additional studies may be needed depending on the individual’s history and diagnostic test results. (Patients may be referred to Internal Medicine specialist, as needed).\n\nFollowing the on-line/ email communications, patients will be seen, for an in-person consultation and full physical examination. Dr. Betancourt’s office will make arrangements for a translator and companion to accompany the patient, as needed. With the patient’s assistance, a full surgical treatment plan will be designed at that time – which discusses how many surgeries and what the anticipated timeline and recovery will be.\n\nAs discussed above, the torsoplasty/ belt lipectomy is usually the first procedure performed, often followed by reduction mammoplasty/ mammoplexy.\n\nWith the torsoplasty, patients are usually hospitalized for 1 to 2 nights. They are encouraged to be active and ambulatory as soon as possible after surgery to prevent post-operative complications such as thrombosis and pneumonia. Dr.Betancourt usually engages private nurses to assist patients following their discharge from the hospital.\n\nSufficient recovery from return travel usually requires 3 weeks, and is monitored by Dr.Betancourt.\n\nDr. Betancourt also provides psychological / counselling referrals as needed for patients.\n\nAdditional References / Reading and Resources on post-bariatric surgery\n\n* Recommended reading: Langer V, Singh A, Aly AS, Cram AE.

He primarily specializes in facial plastic surgery (rhinoplasty, blepharoplasty, forehead surgery, facial endoscopy, face-lifts and fillers) and breast surgery (augmentation/ reduction). He reports that he receives most of his clients by work of mouth but does see a significant percentage of medical tourists.\n\nThe majority of his patients are private practice (self-pay) patients but he does see patients from many of the major Colombian health care insurance plans such as Colseguro, Liberty, Sur America, Colsanitas. While American insurance companies do not traditionally cover elective cosmetic procedures, it is worth investigating with your insurer as many of the larger plans such as Blue Cross/ Anthem now have ancillary plans for cosmetic procedures.\n\nDr. Diaz has been a practicing plastic surgeon for thirty years, and a professor of plastic surgery at the Universidad de Antioquia for the past 12 years. He attended the Universidad de Antioquia medical school and completed his plastic surgery residency there as well.\n\nLike all Colombian surgeons profiled here at Latin American Surgery.com, he is a member of the Colombian Society of Plastic, Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery. He is also a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) and the International Society of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic surgery.\n\nPre-operative process\n\nAs we talk, he reviews the pre-operative process for his patients. “It usually starts with an email from the patient,”he states. Then he solicits a complete medical history from the patient, including medications, past surgeries, social habits (smoking, drinking etc), current and past medical problems (like hypertension) and family history. This also includes photographs so he can best determine exactly what procedure(s) they will need, plan the procedure and discuss anticipated results.\n\nIf they have a single problem (like high blood pressure), then he sends the patient for a complete medical evaluation.\n\nAll smokers are required to quit at least 2 months before the procedure, and Aspirin (and other anti-platelets) must be discontinued 8 days before the scheduled procedure.\n\nOut-of-town patients are encouraged to bring another adult with them, and additional translators are provided as needed.\n\nPlan for adequate recovery time\n\nOne of the things he stresses heavily during our interview is the need for medical tourists to allocate adequate time to the recovery process before returning to their home country. This is something that has been brought up in previous interviews with other surgeons, as well but bears repeating. Even smaller surgeries require adequate healing time, so the idea of a ‘weekend surgical makeover’ should be dismissed from the minds of potential clients.\n\nMost important aspect is post-operative care\n\nThe time necessary for adequate healing is usually 15 days to three weeks depending on the procedures. This period is also important for surgeons to be able to detect small problems such as delayed healing before it becomes a bigger problem. “It is better for me to see an incision that isn’t healing right away so I can treat it immediately, then for the patient to put it off – and then seek treatment weeks later when it is a much larger problem.”\n\nAnother reason he encourages patients to not to rush home, is that surgeons in their home countries may be unwilling to care for patients who have surgery elsewhere.\n\nPatients take priority\n\nDr. Diaz prides himself in providing excellent post-operative care. All patients have his cell phone, and he encourages them to use it for all and every question or concern – day or night. “If they need me, I am here.”\n\nAnd – don’t worry, if you are hesitant to call him – he is going to call you anyway, just to check in and make sure you are doing well, and your pain is controlled. He calls all of his patients the day after surgery, and continues to check-in and see patients frequently during the first weeks after surgery.\n\n“My patients always take priority, even after they return home. If I have a patient Skyping me in the office – well, that takes priority over other things because I know what a hassle it is for them.”\n\nHe speaks English fluently but reports he continues to take weekly classes in English and American culture. He feels that it is impossible to have a complete understanding and good communication of his clients without understanding the culture.\n\nTrends in facial plastic surgery\n\nDuring his lengthy plastic surgery career, Dr. Diaz has seen a lot of trends come and go in aesthetics. He reports that one of the main trends he has seen over the last few years, is a trend for lesser facial procedures such as facial endoscopy, eyelid surgery or use of fillers by his clients versus a full face-lift. He states the reasons are multiple. Patients want to avoid the dreaded “plasticized / surgerized” artifical appearance that has been highly visible in popular media such as American reality shows, and prefer more subtle results, so his patients tend to seek treatment earlier, just a lines and folds appear. While many of these treatments are temporary like fillers or laser re-surfacing, the results are more natural and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nSecondly, patients want to avoid the longer downtown involved with a larger procedure like a face-lift which may have residual bruising, or swelling for several weeks. These patients want to be refreshed and back in the office quickly.\n\nLastly, as he reflects on his career and the ‘style’ of plastic surgery – he reports that for many of his clients (particularly Colombian client), the focus is so heavily on the body (breast and buttock augmentation) that the face is secondary in consideration.\n\nDr. Ruy Rodrigo Diaz\n\nCalle 32 No 72-28\n\nClinica de Las Americas, 4th floor\n\nMedellin\n\nTele: 345-9159\n\nEmail: rdiaz@une.net.co\n\nDr. Juan David Londoño is a plastic surgeon here in Medellin who specializes in body procedures such as liposuction, abdominoplasties and breast augmentation.\n\nHe shares an office with Dr. Jorge Aliro Mejia Canas in the Forum building, next to the Santa Fe shopping mall in the upscale Poblado neighborhood.\n\nHe is also one of just a handful of surgeons here who specialize in hair restoration.\n\nDr. Londoño attended medical school at the Universidad de Antioquia, graduating in 1995. He completed his plastic surgery residency at the same institution and completed his training in 2003. While he trained in both reconstructive and aesthesthic plastic surgery, he states that he prefers aesthetic surgery because of the close relationship it entails with patients.\n\nToday we talked primarily about Hair Restoration procedures because it’s his favorite procedure, and one I don’t know much about.\n\nPatience is the key, he states as he explains the ins and outs of hair restoration treatments. Patience was certainly the order of the day as he carefully and graciously explained the principles of hair transplantation to me. Patience is necessary he explains, as in, there is no ‘quick fix’. Hair restoration techniques have evolved with the development of newer procedures but it remains a painstaking process.\n\nNot just for male pattern baldness\n\nWhile people traditionally think of this treatment as exclusively for male pattern baldness, women also undergo hair restoration in cases of thinning hair. People can also use this treatment to restore hair to other areas of the body such as the eyebrows (or as commonly publicized in Turkey) for beard restoration.\n\nTreatment options\n\nAs Dr. Londoño explains, there are a range of treatments available for the treatment of hair loss, such as male pattern baldness, or thinning hair. While these treatments run along a continium of scalp massage –> medications –> surgery; these treatments can also be used to compliment each other.\n\nProbably the best well-known treatments are the medications such as topical applications of minoxidil (Rogaine) or oral (finesteride) Propecia tablets. Many people are familiar with these medications due to long-standing and widely viewed pharmaceutical advertisements in the early and late 1990’s. Both of these medications were originally developed to treat other conditions (hypertension and BPH) and hair growth was quickly noted to be a frequently occurring side effect. These medications underwent additional clinical trials and study by the FDA before being re-formulated (as a topical spray), in the case of minoxidil, and re-marketed to treat hair loss.\n\nHowever, these medications are less than ideal for treating a long-term problem like hair loss. While the medications can prevent additional hair loss, in most cases – additional hair growth is modest and requires continued medical therapy (pills) to maintain.\n\nScalp massage, is believed to stimulate blood circulation in the scalp and improve the health of the scalp and hair. It is also quite pleasant for most people. However, the results of scalp massage as a sole treatment are minimal at best when it comes to the treatment of alopecia.\n\nSurgical methods of hair restoration\n\nThe original surgical methods of hair transplantation (or hair restoration) are more widely known for their limited results. “Hair plugs” refer to the artificial appearance due to the technique of implanting a group of hair in one area, with the finished results often having a row-like appearance (like a doll).\n\nMore modern techniques include the strip method, and the most recent technique called Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE).\n\nWith the strip method a small area of scalp on the back of the head (where hair is usually the densest, and has the greatest longevity) is surgically removed in a long strip. The scalp is then sutured closed, leaving a small linear scar. The area of scalp, and hair follicules are then used for implantation. By taking a portion of the scalp, the surgeons are able to ensure that the critical portion of the hair shaft – the root is preserved. This root is needed for hair to survive and grow after implantation.\n\nWith the newer Follicular Unit Extraction, each hair, including the root is extracted using a 1mm punch biopsy technique. (This is like a skin biopsy punch but much smaller.) Since each root is extracted individually, this is a painstaking and time consuming process. He reports that depending on the degree of hair loss, the length of the sessions and the results desired by the patient – determines the number of sessions a person will need. Since this procedure requires multiple sessions, some patients elect for shorter sessions but require a higher number of sessions since this is often more convenient for the schedules of working people.\n\nThe first treatment is usually done to re-establish the natural hairline. Subsequent treatments are needed to fill in areas of hair loss.\n\nFor patients who have very little remaining head hair, hair can be taken from other parts of the body. In general, surgeons use hair from areas (like the so-called “fringe area”) where hair persists despite months or years of hair loss. These areas are less likely to have hair that will succumb to the processes that caused alopecia in these individuals.\n\nThere are newer methods of FUE which use a more automated process, but as Dr. Londoño explains this often incurs a higher cost – and does not improve the outcomes (but does shorten the process somewhat.) He has the Artas Robot to assist him with the process, (if needed), but cautions readers not to be fooled by surgeons advertising the latest and greatest machinery. We digress into a conversation about general plastic surgery and the widespread advertising of specifically trademarked (and very expensive) equipment such as SlimLipo, Ultrasound and Vaser.\n\nIt’s more about the surgeon than the tools\n\nHe cautions consumers not to be fooled into thinking that having the most expensive equipment equals the best surgeon as often these devices are employed only to attract customers and command more expensive prices. As we discussed in a previous post, these devices were designed for specific uses that may not even be needed for many clients.\n\nWhy should patients pay for ultrasound-assisted liposuction when standard liposuction will be equally effective in their case? That’s kind of how he feels about the hair transplant robot. He has it – and he will use it if he needs it, but it isn’t for everyone.\n\nResults take time\n\nResults of this procedure are not immediate. The scalp takes time to heal from the transplant procedure, and the newly implanted follicules need to adjust to the transplantation process. Usually, the initially transplanted hair sheds – leaving living, hair producing roots behind. These hair roots will then grow new hair as part of the normal hair growth cycle. But hair takes time to grow – so many patients won’t see the full results of their procedure for up to six months afterwards as the hair grows in to the patient’s normal length.\n\nCosts of the procedure\n\nThe near universal standard for hair restoration at many facilities is a dollar a hair. When you consider that the average (full) head of hair contains 100,000 hairs – the potential costs of this procedure* can be daunting. However, Dr. Londoño does not apply a “one price fits all” approach to his patients. Instead his assesses the client, their restoration needs (a small area versus the entire coronal area), the amount (and type) of treatments involved, and the expected results before determining a price. It is a more personalized and individualized accounting that may not suit some medical tourists who are looking for bargain basement prices however, it seems a better practice.\n\nDr. Juan David Londoño\n\nCalle 7 sur N. 42-70\n\nEdificio Fórum Poblado,\n\nconsultorio 511\n\nMedellin, Colombia\n\nTelé: 448489 or 3140478\n\nEmail: ciruplas2@une.net.co\n\nWebsite: www.cirplalondono.com\n\nSpeaks primarily Spanish.\n\n*Generally patients would only need a small fraction of this number for hair restoration.\n\nReferences and Resources\n\nKhanna M.

This photo is for article art only and is not an attempt to dupe or trick readers. It is my policy to always disclose when photos have been altered from the original image.\n\n6.251840 -75.563590\n\nPlease note that some of the images in this article have been edited to preserve patient privacy.\n\nToday, Dr. Luis Botero has invited me to observe surgery at IQ Interquirofanos in the Poblado section of Medellin. He is performing full-body liposuction and fat grafting of the buttocks.\n\nThe facility: IQ Interquirofanos\n\nIQ Interquirofanos is an ambulatory surgery center located on the second floor of the Intermedica Building across the street from the Clinica de Medellin (sede Poblado). The close proximity of this clinic to a hospital is an important consideration for patients in case of a medical emergency.\n\nThe anesthesiologists estimate that 90% of the procedures performed here are cosmetic surgeries but surgeons also perform gynecology, and some orthopedic procedures at this facility.\n\nThe are seven operating rooms that are well-lit, and feature modern and functional equipment including hemodynamic monitoring, anesthesia / ventilatory equipment/ medications. There are crash carts available for the operating rooms and the patient recovery areas.\n\nThere are fourteen monitored recovery room beds, while the facility currently plans for expansion. Next door, an additional three floors are being built along with six more operating rooms.\n\nSterile processing is located within the facility with several large sterilization units. There is also a pharmacy on-site. The pharmacy dispenses prosthetics such as breast implants in addition to medications.\n\nThe only breast prosthetics offered at this facility are Mentor (Johnson & Johnson) and Natrelle brand silicone implants (Allergan). In light of the problems with PIP implants in the past – it is important for patients to ensure their implants are FDA approved, like Mentor implants.\n\nIn the past seven years, over 31,000 procedures have been performed at Interquirofanos. The nurses tell me that during the week, there are usually 30 to 35 surgeries a day, and around 15 procedures on Saturdays.\n\nPrior to heading to the Operating Room:\n\nPrior to surgery, patients undergo a full consultation with Dr. Botero and further medical evaluation (as needed). Patients are also instructed to avoid aspirin, ibuprofen and all antiplatets (clopidogrel, prasugrel, etc) and anti-coagulants (warfarin, dabigatran, etc.) for several days. Patients should not resume these medications until approved by their surgeon.\n\nComplication Insurance\n\nAll patients are required to purchase complication insurance. This insurance costs between 75.00 and 120.00 dollars and covers the cost of any treatment needed (in the first 30 days) for post-operative complications for amounts ranging from 15,000 dollars to 30,000 dollars, depending on the policy. All of his clients who undergo surgery at IQ Interquirofanos are encouraged to buy a policy from Pan American Life de Colombia as part of the policies for patient safety at this facility. International patients may also be interested in purchasing a policy from ISPAS, which covers any visits to an ISPAS-affiliated surgeon in their home country.\n\nToday’s Procedures: Liposuction & Fat Grafting\n\nLiposuction – Liposuction (lipoplasty or lipectomy) accounts for 50% of all plastic surgery procedures. First the surgeon makes several very small slits in the skin. Then a saline – lidocaine solution is infiltrated in to the fat (adipose) tissue that is to removed. This solution serves several purposes – the solution helps emulsify the fat for removal while the lidocaine-epinephrine additives help provide post-operative analgesic and limit intra-operative bleeding. After the solution dwells (sits in the tissue) for ten to twenty minutes, the surgeon can begin the liposuction procedure. For this procedure, instruments are introduced to the area beneath the skin and above the muscle layer.\n\nDuring this procedure, the surgeon introduces different canulas (long hollow tubes). These tubes are used to break up the adipose tissue and remove the fat using an attached suctioning canister. To break up the fat, the surgeon uses a back and forth motion. During this process – one hand is on the canula. The other hand remains on the patient to guide the canulas and prevent inadvertent injury to the patient.\n\nDue to the nature of this procedure, extensive bruising and swelling after this procedure is normal. Swelling may last up to a month. Patients will need to wear support garments (such as a girdle) after this procedure for several weeks.\n\nTypes of liposuction:\n\nIn recent years, surgeons have developed different techniques and specialized canulas to address specific purposes during surgery.\n\nStandard liposuction canulas come in a variety of lengths and bore sizes (the bore size is the size of the hole at the end of the canister for the suction removal of fat tissue.) Some of these canulas have serrated bores for easier fat removal.\n\nUltrasound-assisted liposuction uses the canulas to deliver sound waves to help break up fat tissue. These canulas are designed for patients who have had repeated liposuction. This is needed to break up adhesions (scar tissue) that forms after the initial procedure during the healing process.\n\nLaser liposuction is another type of liposuction aimed at specifically improving skin contraction. This is important in older patients or in patients who have excessive loose skin due to recent weight loss or post-pregnancy. However, for very large amounts of loose skin or poor skin tone in areas such as the abdomen, a larger procedure such as abdominoplasty may be needed.\n\nDuring laser liposuction, a small wire laser is placed inside a canula to deliver a specific amount of heat energy to the area (around 40 degrees centrigrade). The application of heat is believed to stimulate collagen production (for skin tightening). Bleeding is reduced because of the cautery effect of the heat – but post-operative pain is increased due to increased inflammatory effects. There is also a risk of burn trauma during this procedure.\n\nThere have been several other liposuction techniques that have gone in and out of fashion, and many of the variations mentioned are often referred to by trademark names such as “Vaser”, “SmartLipo”, “SlimLipo” which can be confusing for people seeking information on these procedures.\n\nFat Grafting\n\nFat grafting is a procedure used in combination with liposuction. With this procedure, fat that was removed during liposuction is relocated to another area of the body such as the buttocks, hands or face.\n\nIn this patient, Dr. Botero injects the fat using a large bore needle deep into the gluteal muscles to prevent a sloppy, or dimpled appearance. Injecting into the muscle tissue also helps to preserve the longevity of the procedure. However, care must be taken to prevent fat embolism*, a rare but potentially fatal complication – where globules of fat enter the bloodstream. To prevent this complication, Dr. Botero carefully confirms the placement of his needle in the muscle tissue before injecting.\n\nResults are immediately appreciable.\n\nThe Surgery:\n\nPatient was appropriately marked prior to the procedure. The patient was correctly prepped, drapped and positioned to prevent injury or infection. Ted hose and sequential stockings were applied to lessen the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis. Pre-operative procedures were performed according to internationally recognized standards.\n\nSterility was maintained during the case. Dr. Botero appeared knowledgeable and skilled regarding the techniques and procedures performed.\n\nHis instrumentadora (First assistant), Liliana Moreno was extremely knowledgeable and able to anticipate Dr. Botero’s needs.\n\nCirculating nurse: Anais Perez maintained accurate and up-to-date intra-operative records during the case. Ms. Perez was readily available to obtain instruments and supplies as needed.\n\nOverall – the team worked well together and communicated effectively before, during and after the case.\n\nAnesthesia was managed by Dr. Julio Arango. He was using an anesthesia technique called “controlled hypotension”. (Since readers have heard me rail about uncontrolled hypotension in the past – I will write another post on this topic soon.)\n\nControlled Hypotension\n\nHowever, as the name inplies – controlled hypotension is a tightly regulated process, where blood pressure is lowered to a very specific range. This range is just slightly lower than normal (Systolic BP of around 80) – and the anesthesiologist is in constant attendance. This is very different from cases with profound hypotension which is ignored due to an anesthesia provider being distracted – or completely absent.\n\nWith hypotensive anesthesia – blood pressure is maintained with a MAP (or mean) of 50 – 60mmHg with a HR of 50 – 60. This reduces the incidence of bleeding.\n\nHowever, this technique is not safe for everyone. Only young healthy patients are good candidates for this anesthesia technique. Basically, if you have any stiffening of your arteries due to age (40+), smoking, cholesterol or family history – this technique is NOT for you. People with high blood pressure, any degree of kidney disease, heart disease, peripheral vascular disease or diabetes are not good candidates for this type of anesthesia. People with these kinds of medical conditions do not tolerate even mild hypotension very well, and are at increased risk of serious complications such as renal injury/ failure or cardiovascular complications such as a heart attack or stroke. Particularly since this is an elective procedure – this is something to discuss with your surgeon and anesthesiologist before surgery.\n\nThe patient today is young (low 20’s), physically fit, active with no medical conditions so this anesthesia poses little risk during this procedure. Also the surgery itself is fairly short – which is important. Long/ marathon surgeries such as ‘mega-makeovers‘ are not ideal for this type of anesthesia.\n\nHowever, Dr. Arango does an excellent job during this procedure, which is performed under general anesthesia. After intubating the patient, he maintained a close eye on vital signs and oxygenation. The patient is hemodynamically stable with no desaturations or hypoxia during the case. Dr. Arango remains alert and attentive during the case, and remains present for the entire surgery. Following surgery, anesthesia was lightened, and the patient was extubated prior to transfer to the recovery room.\n\nHe also demonstrated excellent knowledge of international protocols regarding DVT/ Travel risk, WHO safety protocols and intra-operative management.\n\nSurgical apgar score: 9 (however, there is a point lost due to MAP of 50 – 60 as discussed above).\n\nResults of the surgery were cosmetically pleasing.\n\nPost -operative care:\n\nPrior to discharge from the ambulatory care center after recovery from anesthesia the patient (and family) receives discharge instructions from the nurses.\n\nThe patient also receives prescriptions for several medications including:\n\n1. Oral antibiotics for a five-day course**. Dr. Botero uses this duration for fat grafting cases only.\n\n2. Non-narcotic analgesia (pain medications).\n\n3. Lyrica ( a gabapentin-like compound) to prevent neuralgias during the healing period.\n\nThe patient will wear a support garment for several weeks. She is to call Dr. Botero to report any problems such as unrelieved pain, drainage or fever.\n\nNote: after some surgeries like abdominoplasty, patients also receive DVT prophylaxis with either Arixtra or enoxaparin (Lovenox).\n\nFollow-up appointments:\n\nDr. Botero will see her for her first follow-up visit in two days (surgery was on a Saturday). He will see twice a week the first week, and then weekly for three weeks (and additionally as needed.)\n\n* Fat embolism is a risk with any liposuction procedure.\n\n**This is contrary to American recommendations as per the National Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) which recommends discontinuation within the first 24 hours to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\n6.251840 -75.563590\n\nDr. Sergio Franco wrote the book on heart surgery.\n\nIt was exciting and illuminating to talk to Dr. Sergio Franco, who is one of Colombia’s most prolific writers and professors of cardiac surgery. The 50 year-old cardiac surgeon has authored multiple textbooks for surgeons and edited ten others, making him one of the nation’s definitive experts on cardiac surgery.\n\nCurrently he is the Medical Director of the Cardiopulmonary and Peripheral Vascular Center of the Fundacion San Vicente in Rio Negro, as well as Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the Clinica de Medellin. For the last 12 years, he has also been the program director for post-graduate studies at the Universidad CES medical school. Between the two clinics, and the five other surgeons he works with (2 at Clinica de Medellin and 2 at Rionegro), he estimates that the cardiac programs see volumes of 700 – 750 cases per year.\n\nFor our first interview, we meet at the Clinica de Medellin to talk. He later invites me to see the hospital at Rionegro.\n\nEducation/ Training / Experience\n\nDr. Franco attended medical school, general surgery residency and cardiac surgery fellowship at the Universidad Pontifica Boliviarana. He finished his fellowship in 1996. As part of his fellowship, he spent nine months training in heart and lung transplantation at Loyola University Medical Center in Chicago, Il. During his heart and lung tranplantation training, he received an award as “Best Foreign Medical Fellow.” He graduated with high honors due to his exemplary grade point average.\n\nHe has additional training in thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic surgery (Missouri Baptist, 1998), and minimally invasive valvular surgery (Cleveland Clinic).\n\nSelected awards and special recognition\n\nHe was also the first surgeon to perform endovascular harvesting of the saphenous vein in Colombia in 1997. He received second place for a poster presentation based on this technique at the Colombian Congress of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery, Cartagena, 8 to 11 February 2006.\n\nHe received the Cesar Uribe Piedrahita Medal from the Colombian Medical Federation and the Antioquia Medical College in 2003 for academic and clinical excellence, in addition to several other awards for academic achievement.\n\nHe was the chapter president of the Colombian Society of Cardiovascular Surgery and the Colombian Surgical Consensus for multiple terms. He was also the Chairman, and Medical Advisory of the first Latin American Forums on cardiovascular surgery.\n\nHe has received several awards including “The best of 2006” from Hospital General de Medellin for his assistance in the development, creation and commissioning of the cardiovascular services unit at that facility. He has also presented his work at numerous national and international conferences.\n\nHe speaks English in addition to his native Spanish.\n\nDr Sergio Franco\n\nSan Vicente Fundacion\n\nCardiovascular Surgery\n\nMedical Director, Cardiopulmonary and Vascular Surgery\n\nRionegro, Antioquia\n\nTele: 574 444 8717 Ext. 3502\n\nCell: 310 424 4884\n\nEmail: sfsx@sanvicentefundacion.com\n\nWebsite: http://www.sanvicentefundacion.com\n\nWhile I requested a visit to the operating room, an invitation was not forthcoming.\n\nSelected writings of Dr. Sergio Franco\n\nBook chapters:\n\n1.

March 2009.\n\nWhat is the difference between a medico estetico and a cirujano plastico? The answer is more than just an issue of translation and semantics. We discussed this and several other issues during a visit to Clinica Plastic & Estetica Nova with Julio Casadiego, who works in the medical tourism sector here in Medellin at Colombia Travel Operator. Mr. Casadiego works with many of the healthcare professionals here in Colombia to assist overseas traveler in making arrangements for medical travel and has done so since 2009.\n\nThe Clinica Plastica & Estetica NOVA\n\nCarrera 48 #32B sur 30\n\nEnvigado, Antioquia\n\nTele: (4) 339 2300 EXT 125\n\nEmail: gerencia@clinicanova.com.co\n\nNova is an ambulatory surgery center and a center for aesthetics. (Aesthetics is an umbrella term that encompasses other treatments outside of plastic surgery.) This five-story facility houses several doctors offices, aesthetic treatment facilities (laser treatment area) other nonsurgical treatment areas (cellulite treatment, botox/ injectables etc.), a cosmetic dentist (Dr. Jorge Ivan Echavarria) specializing in crowns, dental implants, maxiofacial surgery, and orthodontics along with other cosmetic services such as teeth-whitening.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy as well as a full lab (for development of gel matrix in addition to performing blood analysis), and sterilization facilities along with an operating theatre and recovery unit.\n\nThere are three operating rooms; all of which are spacious and well-lit. Each operating room has a full complement of fully functional and modern equipment and hemodynamic monitoring devices. There are also several well placed ‘crash carts’ for potential emergencies. The recovery room contains hemodynamic monitoring equipment with additional emergency equipment (just in case.) Dr. Diego Correa was my guide for a tour of the operating facilities and was happy to answer all of my questions.\n\nHe also reported that in the last year there have been just three cases of minor skin infections (the causative agent was normal skin flora). He reports no serious infections or complications after surgery, and states that have been no instances of resistant bacteria or MRSA.\n\nWhat is a Medico Estetico?\n\nThe literal translation of medico esthetico is aesthetics doctor, but a more accurate description would be a doctor who serves as an Aesthetics Consultant, or a doctor who performs nonsurgical aesthetics treatments. For a better understanding of this specialty, I spoke with Dr. John Jairo Monsalve Bedoya, a medico estetico and general director at the Nova clinca.\n\nA cirujano plastico is a ‘plastic surgeon’. This is the surgeon who is trained to perform surgical procedures such as abdominoplasties, breast augmentation and similar types of procedures.\n\nAs he explained, the Aesthetics Doctor is a physician who specializes in the study of Aesthetic procedures. Patients consult with this physicians as part of the initial consultation to help patients determine what procedures the patient needs or wants to achieve a desired result. This is important in many cases when the patient knows what type of result they want (“I want to look younger”, for example) but may not know exactly what procedure is best to accomplish the results they want.\n\nDuring the consultation, the doctor listens to the patient describe what they are looking for, collections medical history and other medical information as well as preferences. Then the doctor discusses a range of procedures from injectables (botox, restalyne, gel matrix), and other non-surgical treatments (laser/ light therapies, mini-lift procedures) to larger, more invasive surgical procedures such as facial endoscopy, traditional face-lifts, eye lifts and other related procedures.\n\nFinally, based on the information provided and the discussion with the patient and their family – the doctor recommends the procedures to accomplish the results the patients are seeking.\n\nOnce the patient has decided on their options, Dr. Monsalve, and his associate Dr. Correa begin the pre and post-operative treatment plan. This plan is more than discussing payment, arranging a date for surgery, and a follow-up visit. As Dr. Monsalve explains – it’s a process that encompasses the entire pre-operative period, surgery and recovery.\n\nPatients undergo a compete physical examination, with blood work and cardiac testing as appropriate (usually EKG). Patients are evaluated and treated by internal medicine physicians for any co-morbid conditions before meeting with the anesthesiologist for further evaluation. (This is done to reduce risk of peri-operative and post-operative complications). The degree of pre-surgical evaluation is related to the type of treatment – with more comprehensive evaluations for patients who elect to have surgical procedures with general anesthesia.\n\nIntra-operative care is provided by the attending anesthesiologist with the initial post-operative recovery under monitored care in the recovery room. But after the immediate recovery, patients aren’t simply discharged home.\n\nThe discharge planning / recovery phase is also governed by Dr. Monsalve and his team. This includes a 24 hour call line, and home visits, as needed. In fact, Dr. Monsalve encourages patients to call, saying, If a patient is having pain – they should call.. If they have questions or concerns, they should call. It doesn’t matter what time it is.\n\nDr. Monsalve also encourages patients to consider aesthetics “a process- not just a surgery”. He states that this treatment is a part of a patient’s life, and that using a philosophy of a process-based approach (rather than an episodic experience of pay – surgery – follow-up visit) results in a better patient experience, better outcomes and greater satisfaction/ happiness with the outcomes. He believes that successful aesthetic procedures aren’t about making people prettier, it’s about making people happier with themselves.\n\nMedellin surgeons serving their community\n\nDuring our discussion, we also talked about the many ways that local surgeons give back to their communities. While this includes the more widely known programs such as Operacion Sonrisa, it also includes programs such as Gorditis de Corazon for post-bariatric procedures, Angeles por Colombia , a more generalized organization that recruits volunteers from all professions and areas of society (which operates under a philosophy of each one recipient then helps three others) as well as several other programs aimed at providing reconstructive surgery procedures to low-income Colombians.\n\nGel Matrix for skin rejuvenation\n\nDuring our visit we also talked to Dr. Maria del Pilar Sanin, another medica estetica, who performs many of the non-surgical procedures offered at Nova. She talked about Recombinant Plasma (approximate translation) which uses a gel matrix made for the patient’s own blood to improve the appearance and condition of the skin.\n\nThe origins of gel matrix: cardiac surgery\n\nHaving worked in cardiac surgery, this concept is not new – our perfusionist in Virginia often used the patient’s shed blood in orthopedic surgery to make a similar gel matrix that enhanced healing and reduced inflammation – particularly in patients with a history of poor wound healing.\n\nHere at the clinica Nova, no major surgery is required. Blood is taken, (by syringe) and placed into a centrifuge. Now if you can remember back to high school biology – this causes the blood to separate into its components, buffy coat, platelets and red cell matter. Then the doctor uses the platelet rich portion (which also contains fibroblasts, collagen, and other nutrients important to skin elasticity and wound healing). This formula is then injected in small increments into the patient’s face to promote skin health and rejuvenation. Since the material is made for the patient’s own body, (and unadulterated with preservatives or other chemicals) there is no possibility for allergic reactions or sensitivities to the ingredients.\n\nDr. Maria del Pilar Sanin reports that the healing time for this procedure is approximately four days, and that redness and inflammation at the sites of injections are common immediately after this procedure. She states that the duration of the effects depend on the patient’s underlying skin condition, general health and age. On average it lasts 1.5 to 2.0 years in most patients, but may not last as long in patients with extensive sun damage or deteriorated skin condition.\n\nShe recommends this procedure as a complimentary treatment to other non-surgical treatments for better overall skin condition/ health and a reduction in the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. She reports it is frequently used to treat the deepening of the naso-labial fold (the line that stretches from the nose to the corners of the mouth.)\n\nClinica Nova offers a wide-range of patient-centered aesthetic procedures and plastic surgery – all under one roof.\n\nIf you want to understand and to really know life in Medellin, than you need to see the richness and complexities of life here. It’s simplistic to say that life here is more than black and white. It isn’t varieties of grey either.. There are so many levels, and sublevels and little pockets / slices of life here. Every barrio has its own personality; community, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nNever has that been more apparent than during my visit to El Tesoro yesterday to interview Dr. Botero. Even so, I would be selling the city short if I pretended that I truly understood Medellin in my brief time here. My friend, Adriaan has lived here since 2008 and he would be the first person to admit – that it takes much of that time just to scratch beneath the surface.\n\nOne of the reasons I write about Colombian life so frequently, in addition to medical issues is to better understand life here – and to share that with my readers. It’s not just another language, or another Latin American country. Superficial differences are great for picture postcards and brief visits – but if you spend any real time here, or want to have lasting business relationships or friendships with people here, than you have to dig deeper (not just into Colombia, but in yourself).\n\nOne of the lessons has to do to with what we bring to other countries. A lecturer at the Global Health Conference in Duke one year explained it best. He went on a ‘medical mission’ to Mongolia.. And he thought he should teach them American principles of surgery. But when he got there he talked to the surgeons there and realized they didn’t want or need this. They wanted to learn more about laparoscopic surgery. So he changed his project entirely, and taught laparoscopic surgery. (Notably, he was the only speaker at this three-day conference who listened – and taught what the hosts wanted to learn.)\n\nThis is not a medical mission, it’s the anti-thesis to what I do. But I still have to listen, and to consider Colombians and Colombia as a big part of what I do. I am not an imperialist, and I am not a big multi-national organization. But if I am going to encourage people to see Colombia as a viable option to affordable surgery, then I need to consider the Colombians that will be impacted by this.\n\nI have to take time to make sure that my efforts don’t undermine the needs of Colombian citizens – that they don’t lose access to health care providers in favor of the ‘wealthy gringos’ with cold hard cash in hand. I have to try to encourage others in this industry to do the same; to work within the existing framework to try to ensure services for all.\n\nThis means that I tend to steer clear of facilities created only for ‘rich gringos’ and send people to the excellent public and private facilities that also serve Colombian citizens. This prevents the diversion of resources away from the very people who live here and rely on these services fo"
