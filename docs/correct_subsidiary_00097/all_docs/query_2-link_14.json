        "text": "Were these MD's St. Jude implanters? I bet they were.\n\nThree More Cardiologists Settle With Government Over Kickback Allegations Related to UMDNJ Cardiology Program (U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey)\n\nNEWARK – The U.S. Attorney’s Office has entered into settlements totaling approximately $960,000 with three cardiologists to settle allegations they accepted kickbacks in the form of salaries from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ), and caused the submission of false claims to Medicare, Acting U.S. Attorney Ralph J. Marra, Jr., announced on Sept. 17.\n\nA settlement was signed today with Dr. Ravindra Patel of Scotch Plains for approximately $300,000. Earlier this month a settlement was signed with Dr. Jasjit Walia of Edison for $300,000. In August, a settlement was signed with Dr. Rakesh Sahni of Rumson for approximately $360,000. Each settlement represents double damages for salaries received by the cardiologists as kickbacks for making prohibited referrals to UMDNJ’s University Hospital.\n\nFederal law prohibits a doctor from accepting a salary or other remuneration in exchange for referring patients. University Hospital is a state-licensed Level 1 Trauma Center. To maintain funding and accreditation from the state, University Hospital was dependent on the annual performance of a certain number of cardiac procedures, including cardiac catheterizations and cardiothoracic surgery.\n\nThe government alleges that beginning in 1995, University Hospital was failing in this regard, and to remedy the problem, embarked on a program to bring in more cardio surgery patients through part-time employment contracts with a number of community cardiologists. Those doctors had their own private practices and significant numbers of patients whom they could refer to University Hospital. The government alleges that those employment contracts served as vehicles to pay kickbacks to the cardiologists for their referrals to University Hospital.\n\nIn the past year and a half, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has reached settlements with six other cardiologists who are alleged to have exploited this same program at University Hospital. Two other cardiologists also pleaded guilty to criminal embezzlement charges, and the Office has filed civil suits against two others. The U.S. Attorney’s Office is continuing its investigation and pursuing those who received payment under fraudulent contracts.\n\n“We will continue to pursue those physicians who abuse and defraud federal health care programs by making referrals based on financial considerations rather than the best interests of patients,” Marra said.\n\nThe settlement forgoes the need to file suit against the three cardiologists. The three current settlements involve cardiologists who were alleged to have received salaries in exchange for improperly referring patients. Medicare was then billed for services performed as a result of these improper referrals.\n\nIn 2008, the US Attorney’s Office entered into civil settlement agreements with six other cardiologists involved in the program: Trevor Atherley of Watchung; Joven Dungo of Caldwell; Abdul Ameen of Bayonne; Michael Benz of Nutley; Bakul Desai of Livingston; and Laxmipathi Garipalli of Colts Neck. The Office also filed lawsuits against Dr. Joseph Campbell of Orange, and Dr. Atul Prakash of Cedar Grove, based on the same alleged conduct. These two actions are currently being litigated.\n\nIn February of 2008, Desai and Garipalli, pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal embezzlement charges for engaging in the same fraudulent conduct and taking salaries totaling $840,000 between them.\n\nMarra credited Special Agents of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Thomas O’Donnell of the New York Regional Office; and Special Agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Weysan Dun in Newark, for the investigation leading to today’s settlements.\n\nThe cases were handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Kriegsman of the U.S. Attorney’s Office Civil Division.\n\nMore information on the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey: http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nj/\n\nLA doctor prescribes 'unneeded' implant to get job for his son, lawsuit alleges\n\nJune 16, 2010 | Lance Williams\n\nAlbert Israel, 77, says he realizes that he didn’t actually need an internal defibrillator implanted in his chest.\n\nBut the Los Angeles retiree got one anyway – and almost died on the operating table.\n\nPhto by Lisa Setrini-Espinosa\n\nAnd now, in legal documents filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, Israel says he has discovered he underwent the unnecessary surgery for the most “venal” of motives.\n\nHis cardiologist, Dr. Michael Burnam of Tarzana, had recently gotten his son a $200,000-per-year job as a salesman for St. Jude Medical Inc., which manufactures defibrillator devices, Israel’s lawsuit says.\n\nIn exchange for giving his son the job, the physician promised to prescribe St. Jude Medical devices for his patients, a former employee of St. Jude has testified.\n\nThat’s the only reason Burnam told Israel to undergo surgery for the implant, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe alarming allegations in Israel’s lawsuit suggest a scenario in which a physician swapped the Hippocratic Oath for a cash-and-carry ethos.\n\n“We expect our physicians to be motivated solely by the well-being of their patients and nothing more,” said Los Angeles attorney Jeffrey D. Wolf, who represents Israel.\n\nLawyers for Burnam and St. Jude couldn’t be reached for comment. In legal filings, Burnam denied wrongdoing.\n\nBurnam is a longtime Los Angeles-area cardiologist. In 2001, he was publicly reprimanded by the state medical board for “surgical errors” that caused an angioplasty patient to have a heart attack, records show.\n\nEarlier this month, St. Jude said it would pay $3.7 million to settle U.S. Justice Department allegations that it had paid kickbacks to some hospitals in Ohio to get heart device business, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAccording to his lawyer, Israel has had some heart problems and for years wore a pacemaker, which Dr. Burnam monitored. Then, in 2008, Burnam told Israel his heart problems were so serious he needed the defibrillator implant, also called an ICD, which is supposed to ward off heart attacks. Burnam falsely told the surgeon who was to do the operation that Israel had suffered a heart attack, court records show, and made other alleged misrepresentations about Israel’s condition, as well.\n\nDuring surgery, the implant accidentally stabbed Israel’s heart, the lawsuit says. Surgeons managed to save Israel's life, but he hasn't fully recovered, his lawyer says.\n\nUnbeknownst to Israel, a few months earlier, Burnam had begun negotiating with St. Jude for a job for his son, Brad. The son admits he was hired because he could bring his father’s “business” to St. Jude, the lawsuit says.\n\nA former St. Jude employee, Mark House, said in pretrial testimony that in addition to the job for his son, Burnam wanted money for heart research.\n\nBurnam “wanted (the son) to have $200,000,” House testified. Burnam also “wanted a research site set up … he wanted enough money for computers and potentially have a research coordinator nursed there.”\n\nThe quid pro quo was explicit, according to the testimony.\n\n“He said that we would get the business if there was something that we could do for Brad and for him,” House said."
