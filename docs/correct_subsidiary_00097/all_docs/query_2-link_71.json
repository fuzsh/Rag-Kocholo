however, the PI (package insert) only includes data for up to 3 years • you also cited an open-label extension study – that is not “substantial evidence” – only 100/231 patients remained – need adequate & well-controlled studies 6\n\n7. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Copaxone … ➢ Unsupported comparative claim: – Claim: “No other RRMS therapy can demonstrate the long- term results like Copaxone” – FDA: we are unaware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that show that Copaxone is safer, more effective, or otherwise superior • … continued … 7\n\n8. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Copaxone – David Kyle and Karen Stewart ➢ Overstating Efficacy/Broadening Indication ➢ Webpage: “Running, Swimming and Biking After Multiple Sclerosis” – Kyle … 8\n\n9. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Copaxone – David Kyle and Karen Stewart … ➢ Kyle Website … ➢ Karen Stewart Website … 9\n\n10. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Copaxone – David Kyle and Karen Stewart … ➢ Karen Stewart … after … ➢ FDA: 10\n\n11. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Copaxone – David Kyle and Karen Stewart … ➢ Key lessons – Testimonials – even if accurate, do not equal substantial evidence or “substantial clinical experience” • inconsistent with approved labeling, which was: – decreasing relapses of RRMS – not indicated for slowing, preventing or reversing physical disability of the MS sufferer – Teva – needed data from A&WCCT to make these claims (and, theoretically, would have to submit to FDA as a supplement to approved application before making them) 11\n\n12. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Copaxone – David Kyle and Karen Stewart … ➢ Key lessons … – Broadened indication – type of MS • FDA – approval is for RRMS • Webpage claims talk about cycling “after Multiple Sclerosis”, but without qualification as to RRMS – Broadened indication – length of therapy • Kyle and Stewart, on website, are stated to have started Copaxone in 1998 and 2003; suggests long-term usage • FDA – this implies that Copaxone is effective over a long term, but your PI data is only for 3 years .. 12 12\n\n13. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Copaxone – David Kyle and Karen Stewart … ➢ Key lessons – Omission of Risk Information • FDA – webpage fails to include any discussion of risk information – references to approved labeling in website do not cure error – Implied Superiority (based on alleged less risk) • FDA -- AAN Panels – listed serious AEs that were not in the Warnings & Precautions part of Copaxone PI; – however, these are listed in the Adverse Event list on PI • FDA – AAN Panels – also failed to list a number of Warnings that are in Copaxone PI such as chest pain, skin necrosis, and potential impact on immune response 13\n\n14. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright EpiPen WL – DTC Ad – May 2012 ➢ Overstatement of Efficacy – Hot Link to Letter – FDA: “… particularly alarming from a public health perspective because the misleading presentation of the use of the EpiPen may result in serious consequences, including death.” – TV ad: 14\n\n15. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright EpiPen WL – DTC Ad – May 2012 … ➢ Overstatement of Efficacy – Hot Link to Promo – FDA: Overwhelming impression is that the EpiPen alone can provide assurance that a child with history of anaphylaxis does not need to worry or take other precautions • gives impression don’t have to worry about the cake – “… a cake made of who-knows-what…” • FDA -- “The standard of care to prevent a potentially life-threatening anaphylactic reaction is to take precautionary measures to avoid the allergen.” ➢ Logistics – came in via FDA’s “Bad Ad” website – April 20 – conference call bet. FDA & Pfizer • agreed to pull materials 15\n\n16. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright EpiPen WL – DTC Ad – May 2012 … ➢ Corrective Actions requested – “Corrective messages” • Describe the violative promotional pieces/activity • Summarize the violative messages • Provide info to correct each message • Use same media to correct and same duration of time and frequency as violative promotional mats. • Be free of promotional material 16\n\n17. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Ista – Bromday WL – Omitted Risk Info ➢ July 2011 – Hot Link – Warning Letter – Hot Link – Promotional Materials ➢ FDA – first, we sent you a WL on Xibrom last year, before you got approval of a supplement to change the labeling to once/day dosing – omitted risk information also – Flyer – fails to include any of the Warnings or Precautions, including: • omitted risk of sulfite anaphylaxis – life threatening • omitted risk not to use when wearing contacts 17\n\n18. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Ista – Bromday WL – Omitted Risk Info ➢ FDA – also omitted material facts on dosage – Xibrom (first generation) – dosing began 24 hours after surgery – Bromday – dosing begins 1 day before surgery – Problem – • because the flyer suggests that Bromday replaces Xibrom, erroneous conclusions on dosing are possible • also, the PI for Bromday has a precaution against using a topical NSAID more than 24 hours before surgery (issue: seems to be, but is not clear in WL, 1 day vs. 24 hours) ➢ Full PI – did not cure the defects in the flyer 18\n\n19. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Shire – Vyvanese – WL – May 2001 ➢ Magnet promo – ADHD drug – Hot Link to Warning Letter – Hot Link to Magnet ➢ Bad Ad report – from a pediatric medical office ➢ FDA – violative because it makes representations regarding use of Vyvanse, but omits the full indication and risks associated with the use of the drug. • implied the drug was safer and more effective • Magnet – had a plastic sleeve for inserting the biz card of sales rep – when inserted, it blocked the risk info 19\n\n20. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Shire – Vyvanese – WL – May 2001 … ➢ Omitted risk information – Product has a Boxed Warning on potential for abuse – Other serious risks, including some that are fatal – Contraindications – many – omitted – FDA -- “Please see accompanying Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning” – not adequate (also not clear where it was) ➢ Omitted indication information – all said was “First Prodrug Stimulant” – nothing about ADHD – fails to adequately communicate important information on ADHD indication regarding special diagnostic considerations, need for comprehensive treatment, and long-term use. 20\n\n21. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Shire – Vyvanese – WL – May 2001 … 21\n\n22. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Gelnique – Untitled Letter – Nov. 2010 ➢ “Stall Cling” – not clear what it clung to – Hot Link -- U-Letter – Hot Link – Promo – Viewed at ACOG annual clinical meeting in S.F. ➢ Alleged violations – minimizes risk – overstates efficacy – broadens indication – omits important risk info – makes unsubstantiated claims 22\n\n23. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Gelnique – Untitled Letter – Nov. 2010 … ➢ Minimized risk – risk info in very small font at bottom of piece in single-spaced typed paragraphs – not reasonably comparable to efficacy claims – which are large and easy to see graphically – as to prominence – adverse events presented before more serious risks ➢ Overstated Efficacy – failed to disclose that the big “71%” was compared to a placebo reduction of 56% (or 2.0 vs. 2.7 episodes per day) – disclaimer on placebo in very small print in bottom corner – does not mitigate this overstatement 23\n\n26. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Gelnique – Untitled Letter – Nov. 2010 … ➢ Broadened indication – – Significant reduction in “incontinence episodes” – implies drug is for all types of incontinence – Approved indication – narrower – “overactive bladder with symptom of urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency” – FDA – fact that full indication is at bottom in Brief Summary does not cure the violation vs. size/prominence of violative statement ➢ Omitted Risk Info – failed to include Warning in P.I. on hypersensitivity and need to discontinue if develop hypersensitivity to drug -- in Brief Summary, but not in “Important Safety Info” (buried) 26\n\n27. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Gelnique – Untitled Letter – Nov. 2010 … ➢ Unsubstantiated claims – “Fits into a woman’s skin care routine” • not supported by “substantial evidence” • inconsistent with skin care warnings • inconsistent with detailed instructions on how gel is to be applied (e.g., keep dry for 1 hour; don’t cover until dry) – “Smart Gel Technology is her weapon against wetting” • no evidence suggests their technology is any better than other overactive bladder treatments • claim implies it is better 27\n\n28. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Trisenox – Untitled Letter – June 2011 ➢ Hot Link – Untitled Letter ➢ Hot Link – Promotional Materials ➢ Sent in via a 2253 ➢ FDA: – broadens indication – minimizes and omits risk info – misleading claims – unsubstantiated claims – overstates efficacy • Result – promotes for broader population than proven by substantial evidence 28\n\n29. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Trisenox – Untitled Letter – June 2011 … ➢ Broaden indication – indication – very narrow – web claims – falsely imply good for any type of APL 29\n\n30. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Trisenox – Untitled Letter – June 2011 … ➢ Minimized Risk – info on risk must be given same prominence as those relating to effectiveness • effectiveness info – “large, bold, and colorful font and graphics, on the top portion of page” • risk info -- including on Boxed Warning, appears in small type at bottom • also, when safety info was nearer to the top on the website, it related to minor safety issues and still downplayed major issues • … continued … 30\n\n32. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Trisenox – Untitled Letter – June 2011 … ➢ Overstated Efficacy – used data based on a new definition of “complete remission” (CR) that FDA had not recognized in the approved labeling; was essentially a retrospective re-calculation of response rates based on looser criteria (eliminated a bone marrow confirmation step) • and because “molecular remission” (MR) was based on CR, the reanalysis skewed those numbers as well 32\n\n33. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Trisenox – Untitled Letter – June 2011 … ➢ Unsubstantiated claims – Contrast: • PI says that the mechanism of action of drug is not completely understood • “Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the fusion protein PML/RAR-alpha.” 33\n\n34. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Trisenox – Untitled Letter – June 2011 … ➢ Misleading claims – Dosing – Contrast: • Infusion – every day for up to 4 hours per day for up to 60 days – MANAGEABLE? • Frequent lab and ECG testing required ➢ Omission of Risk – from WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS section of P.I. – fetal harm and warning against nursing – human carcinogen 34\n\n35. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Infergen – Warning Letter – March 2011 ➢ Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals – “Statgram” – Hot Link -- Warning Letter – Hot Link – Promotional Materials ➢ Came in both via 2253 and “Bad Ad” program ➢ FDA allegations – omits and minimizes important risk information – broadens and omits material facts about approved indication, – overstates efficacy – unsubstantiated claim – failure to provide adequate directions for use -- labeling 35\n\n37. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Infergen – Warning Letter – March 2011 … ➢ Omits risk information – sent without the P.I.; only risk information was: “Providers can obtain additional prescribing information regarding INFERGEN, including the product’s safety profile and the box warning for all interferon alphas regarding neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic and infectious disorders, and complete product information by visiting our product website at www.infergen.com1.” – Infergen – its labeling is packed full of warnings, precautions, contraindications, etc. – ranging from requiring close monitoring to suicidal and homicidal ideation, etc. ➢ Did not include full P.I. – because FDA regarded piece as “labeling,” the brief summary rule was n/a – “Highlights” Labeling – not enough 37\n\n38. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Infergen – Warning Letter – March 2011 … ➢ Broadens Indication – Statgram -- claimed approved for daily dosing with ribavirin for retreatment of HCV patients – But – • Infergen is approved only for patients 18 or older with compensated liver disease • omits fact that Infergen has not been proven in naïve patients or those with co-infections involved HIV or HBV ➢ Overstated Efficacy – number of claims made about sustained virological responses (SVRS), but were based on an underpowered, open label study; thus not substantial evidence 38\n\n39. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Colcrys – Untitled Letter – Dec. 2011 ➢ Mutual Pharmaceutical – video and “sell sheet” – Untitled Letter [Hot Link] – Promotional Material [Hot Link] ➢ FDA Allegations – omit risk info – minimize risk info – overstates efficacy – unsubstantiated safety superiority claims 39\n\n40. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Colcrys – Untitled Letter – Dec. 2011 … ➢ Omitted risk info – Warning from PI on risk of rhabdomyolysis in patients with renal dysfunction or elderly – Sell sheet – • “Tough but Gentle” – inconsistent with P.I., which includes fatal overdoses, life-threatening and fatal drug interactions, and neuromuscular toxicity • “Tolerability is comparable to Placebo” – clearly not! ➢ Risk info not comparable to efficacy discussions – video spent 15 minutes on Colcrys and how it compares to unapproved colchicines; no verbal discussion on risk; – then goes, without any alert, into a “running telescript format” for risk info 40\n\n41. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Colcrys – Untitled Letter – Dec. 2011 … ➢ Minimized Risk/Unsubstantiated Safety Superiority – FDA concerns: • erroneously suggests there are no issues with Colcrys in patients with comorbid conditions • erroneously suggests that Colcrys is superior (safer) for patients with concomitant medications and comorbid conditions • FDA – no A&WCCT on a head-to-head basis to support 41\n\n42. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Colcrys – Untitled Letter – Dec. 2011 … ➢ Overstatement of Efficacy – video – FDA – the P.I. states that the efficacy of Colcrys was assessed at 24 hours, not 16 • study was not powered to evaluate outcomes at 16 hours 42\n\n43. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Saphris – Untitled Letter – Feb. 2012 ➢ Merck – Hot Link to untitled letter – complaint via “Bad Ad” – oral statements by Dr. Armando Favazza – at lunch – “on behalf of Merck” – no slides or materials • “Merck Peer Discussion Group” • Not a response to a question ➢ FDA – statements promote Saphris for an unapproved use, for which labeling lacks adequate directions for use – adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) “just as he might prescribe Abilify” and “it works just as well” – approved indications – schizophrenia and bipolar, but not MDD 43\n\n44. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Testopel – Warning Letter – March 2010 ➢ Slate Pharmaceuticals – CIII -- testosterone therapy – WL is about 14 pages long [Hot Link] ➢ Unapproved uses – by reference to testimonials on: – Depression; erectile dysfunction, Type 2 diabetes, HIV – Increased muscle mass and bone strength ➢ Omitted Risk – video – 2 minutes on efficacy; 10 seconds on risk, none done verbally ➢ Minimized Risk – video – doctor said patient can come get treated and not have to “think about anything else” 44\n\n45. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Testopel – Warning Letter – March 2010 … ➢ Broadened indication – created impression could be used for any testosterone replacement, when there are limits to its approved use – “only approved implantable testosterone pellet” ➢ Overstating Efficacy – many statements that people “Reclaim their lives” or “feel normal again” – however, FDA: – no substantial evidence of this – understates the serious risks associated with the drug 45\n\n46. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Testopel – Warning Letter – March 2010 … ➢ Unsupported Superiority – Slate: claimed greater PD effect on gonadotrophin suppression and PK features are advantageous compared to other T preps • study they relied on was not even on their drug • study was not an A&WCCT done head-to-head; rather open label, single dose and non-randomized PK study – Slate – also contended men preferred their pellet product over others – but relied on same flawed study as above [note – the violations in this letter were lengthy; I pulled some of the highlights] 46\n\n47. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Pexeva -- Untitled Letter – May 2011 ➢ Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Flash Card – Untitled Letter [Hot Link] – Promotional Material [Hot Link] ➢ Drug – indicated for PD, MDD, OCD and GAD – boxed warning on suicidality ➢ Broadened indication – “Broad spectrum therapy” and linked MDD to anxiety • FDA – implies Pexeva is effective in persons with MDD comorbid to anxiety, but not proven by substantial evidence – Study cited did not even measure GAD 47\n\n48. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Pexeva -- Untitled Letter -- May 2011 … ➢ Overstated Efficacy – – Flash card – listed numerous individual symptoms that can be linked to MDD, PD, OCD, and GAD; – FDA -- claims that the manner in which the clinicals supporting approval were done did not specifically measure those symptoms; thus, these lack substantial evidence ➢ Omission of Risk Info – omits warning in P.I. about serotonin syndrome, which can be fatal – fails to state the Pexeva is not approved in pediatric pops. 48\n\n51. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Pataday – Untitled Letter – Oct. 2011 ➢ Alcon Research, Ltd. – Rebate Card – via 2253 – Untitled Letter [Hot Link] – Promotional Material [Hot Link] ➢ What kind of ad is it supposed to be? ➢ Can you find what’s wrong with the next ad? 51\n\n53. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Pataday – Untitled Letter – Oct. 2011 … ➢ Suggests indication – graphic of dandelion and the eye – which FDA says has a plant allergen superimposed over the iris ➢ Suggests dosage – logo -- “Once Daily” ➢ Superiority – “Most relief” ➢ Once falls out of reminder labeling, requires full labeling 53\n\n54. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Aegerion – Loose CEO Lips Sink Ship? ➢ Warning Letter -- November 8, 2013 [Hot Link] ➢ Facts: – Juxtapid® -- approved for familial homozygous hypercholest- erolemia (HOFH), but not for reduction of cardiac events. – CEO – on CNBC – “These patients are going to die of a cardiac event, either a stroke or a heart attack, if we don’t have them on therapy.” [and some other statements] ➢ FDA: – This creates a new use, for which there are not adequate directions for use – No balancing risk information relative to “new” uses – and product has a boxed warnig 54\n\n55. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Aegerion – Loose CEO Lips Sink Ship… ➢ Corrective action: – At FDA’s request – Aegerion – ran a corrective advertisement on CNBC (among other things) – FDA – has closed the warning letter 55\n\n56. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Concordia – More Loose Lips? Sales Script ➢ Untitled Letter [Hot Link] – on Kapvay – Promotional Material -- Professional telephone script ➢ Omitted material risk information – “completely omits the contraindication, all of the warnings and precautions, and common adverse events…” – “I can e-mail the full prescribing information … or you can access it at the Kapvay website ... Which do you prefer?” • FDA: “… this does not mitigate the omission of important risk information” • FDA: by omitting key risk info, “misleadingly suggests that Kapvy is safer than has been demonstrated.” 56\n\n57. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Concordia – Loose Lips? … Sales Script … ➢ Omitted material facts – Script describes Kapvay as treatment for ADHD, but fails to say that it is part of a “total treatment program” – Dosing – wrong – script suggests twice a day, but labeling calls for it to start with single dose at bedtime – then could be titrated from there ➢ Established name – clonidine hydrochloride – Not in conjunction with Kapvay – Here – that FDA cited it may reflect fact that clonidine is a drug that has been around for a while and omitting it in running text could lead someone to think product was more innovative (although WL does not say that) 57\n\n59. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright FDA Device Advertising – Warning Letters 59 n = 25\n\n60. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Oratec Interventions WL – Aug. 2001 ➢ Actually 2nd warning letter (prior in 1999) to Oratec on same product – SpineCath Intradiscal Catheter and an Electrothermal Arthroscopy System ➢ Allegations – unapproved/uncleared uses – SpineCath – cleared to be intended for the “coagulation and decompression of disc material to treat symptomatic patients with annular disruption of contained herniated discs.” • Website – promoting for degenerative disk disease • FDA – not same as herniated disk • … continued … 60\n\n61. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Oratec Interventions WL – Aug. 2001 ➢ FDA: – In Oratec’s May 7, 1999 response to our previous Warning Letter, you indicated that some of the terms used by medical professionals to describe the presence of contained herniations and annular disruptions include phrases such as degenerative disc disease, chronic discogenic syndrome, internal disc disruption, cliscogenic pain, and discopathic syndrome. We disagree with that assessment. – In addition to annular disruption of contained herniated discs (the cleared intended use), the Office of Device Evaluation has concluded that the claim of degenerative disc disease may also encompass: degenerative arthritis of the facet joints, instability of the motion segment, pain syndromes, and spinal stenosis. The agency considers the claim of degenerative disc disease to be an expansion and broadening of the intended use requiring the submission of a new 510(k). – Additionally, in our follow up letter to Oratec dated October 4, 1999, we advised that whenever Oratec uses the term \"lower back pain\" it should be qualified with the modifier \"lower back pain associated with herniated discs.\" 61\n\n62. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Oratec Interventions WL – Aug. 2001 … ➢ FDA – Intended use regulation: – 21 CFR 801.4 -- The intended use is the objective intent of the persons responsible for the labeling of the device. Such objective intent may be shown by the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product and maybe shown by labeling claims, advertising matter, or oral or written statements by such persons or their representatives. It may be shown by labeling claims that the article is, with the knowledge of such persons or their representatives, offered and used for purposes for which it is neither labeled nor advertised. 62\n\n63. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Thermatix WL – Jun. 2004 ➢ Off-label promotion – TMx-2000 BPH Thermotherapy System (TMx-2000) – approved under a PMA in 2001 – a “non-surgical device for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men who have a minimum prostatic urethra length of 30 mm and a total prostate volume between 30 and 100 cc – Challenged claims • Treat median lobe enlargement of the prostate – FDA – no clinical data in your PMA to support • You can treat other patients during the procedure – FDA – precautions in PMA labeling say that attention required by a physician during treatment -- to, among other things, make sure rectal temperatures remain correct 63\n\n64. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Thermatix WL – Jun. 2004 ➢ Unsubstantiated Efficacy Claims – Claim – durable for 4+ years • FDA – data in PMA only covers 1 year – Claim – “permanent tissue necrosis” • FDA – BPH can come back, so this is misleading because it implies a permanent cure for BPH – Claim – “superior peak flow rate improvement” • FDA – we are not aware of data showing a statistically significant improvement over other therapies 64\n\n65. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright St. Jude Medical WL -- 2010 ➢ Epicor™ LP Cardiac Ablation System – cleared for ablation of cardiac tissue (generally) ➢ Claims: – \"The Epicor LP system is designed specifically to create the critical Cox Maze III lesions entirely epicardially, which helps mitigate risks associated with other cardiac ablation technologies.\" – \"The Epicor UltraCinch LP Ablation Device ... is designed to safely, effectively and reproducibly create a classic box lesion in a single step.\" 65\n\n66. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright St. Jude Medical WL – 2010 … ➢ FDA: – claims [on your website] to be promotion of these devices for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. – Although the box lesion and Maze lesions are ablation lesions performed on cardiac tissue during cardiac surgery, they are specifically intended to disrupt abnormal electrical conduction to isolate the pulmonary veins in an attempt to terminate a patient's atrial fibrillation. Therefore, FDA considers references to the classic box or Maze cardiac lesions to be synonymous with the treatment of atrial fibrillation. 66\n\n67. www.complianceonline.com ©2015 Copyright Solar Wide WL – 2011 ➢ GMP problems, plus: – Your TENS device, the Stimplus Pro, cleared under K913522 was cleared for the following uses: symptomatic relief of chronic, intractable pain and from acute post-surgical and acute post-traumatic pain.

Cardiac Power Output (CPO) is the #1 correlate to mortality for [acute myocardial infarctions] (AMI) in cardiogenic shock patients . . .

Rather, where the statute under which they were prosecuted dispensed with \"consciousness of wrongdoing,\" an omission or failure to act was deemed a sufficient basis for a responsible corporate agent's liability.
