        "text": "For Immediate Release\n\nRockville, MD, October 15, 2004\n\nMacroGenics, Inc., a growing biotechnology company developing antibodies and vaccines to treat cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases, announced the completion of its Series B financing of $30.5M led by Alta Partners and TPG Ventures. Participants in this new round of financing include Mithra Group, Red Abbey Venture Partners, and Emerging Technology Partners, in addition to current Series A shareholders, InterWest Partners, MPM Capital, OrbiMed, Cogene BioTech Ventures, Vivo Ventures, and Hunt Ventures.\n\nWe are fortunate to have such an esteemed group of new investors join our current shareholders to help finance the next phase of the company, commented Dr. Scott Koenig, President and CEO. We have made tremendous progress over the past two years in developing lead therapeutic candidates for treating antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and cancer, while advancing our core platform in antibody engineering. Capital raised in this financing will be used to support the clinical development of these product candidates as well as recent in-licensed opportunities in infectious diseases.\n\nMacroGenics unique understanding of the interaction of antibodies with their receptors has created a best-in-class antibody engineering platform and generated several exciting and novel clinical and preclinical product candidates that have the potential to treat autoimmune disorders, cancer and infectious diseases, commented Ed Hurwitz, General Partner of Alta Biopharma III and new member of the Board of Directors at MacroGenics. The proceeds of this financing will allow MacroGenics to deliver clinical proof-of-concept on several products and firmly establish the company as a leading next- generation antibody therapeutics company.\n\nWe are delighted with the opportunity to work with an outstanding and accomplished management and founder team, as well as a terrific group of investors to continue the effort to build an important new biotherapeutics company, remarked Dr. Geoffrey Duyk, Managing Director at TPG Ventures. Dr. Duyk will also join the Board of Directors at MacroGenics following the financing.\n\nAbout MacroGenics\n\nMacroGenics, Inc., incorporated in 2000 by scientific founders Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch from Rockefeller University, and Drs. Lee Hood, Alan Aderem, and Ruedi Aebersold of the Institute for Systems Biology, has been actively engaged in exploiting technologies related to the biology of Fc receptors expressed by immune cells and the Fc region of the antibody molecule, along with tools of proteomics and genomics to identify new therapeutic targets. Two of the product candidates to emerge from initial discovery efforts became part of a co-development agreement with Genzyme Corporation in October 2003 and the first of these molecules is expected to enter clinical testing in early 2005. A recently in-licensed attenuated vaccine to prevent West Nile virus (WNV) infections is planned to begin Phase 1 clinical studies later this year in a trial sponsored by the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. MacroGenics will be responsible for manufacturing and clinical development following the initial trial. Two therapeutic antibodies, one to treat patients with diseases caused by WNV and the other to treat individuals with lymphoma, are completing their pre-clinical development and are expected to enter clinical testing by early 2006. The company has identified a number of other promising targets and lead molecules that are being evaluated as future antibody and vaccine candidates. To date, the company has raised $61.7M in venture-backed financing.\n\nAbout Investors\n\nAlta Partners was founded in 1996 by four of the senior partners of Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co.
