A major theme of his research has been developing and testing new endoscopic methods for treatment of patients with Barrettâs. He was the principal investigator of a 19 center U.S. trial of radiofrequency ablation for dysplastic Barrettâs esophagus, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this procedure. The paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He was also the lead investigator of a 10 center study defining the efficacy of cryotherapy in subjects with Barrettâs and high-grade dysplasia. These endoscopic technologies have fundamentally changed the care of patients with early esophageal neoplasia. He is also a member of several consortia that are conducting translational studies of Barrettâs patients. Nicholas Shaheen conducts clinical trials, translational research and epidemiological studies on Barrettâs esophagus. These studies have involved a number of CGIBD members and trainees. He is the PI for a T35 summer research program that trains medical students in research. He is the chief of the UNC Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. His research and leadership positions are important for the success of the CGIBD.\n\nMichael S. Smith, MD, MBA is the Associate System Chief of Gastroenterology for the Mount Sinai Health System, and an Associate Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He previously served as Chief of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West Hospitals, where he also was Director of the Esophageal Program.\n\nDr. Smith graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University with a concentration in molecular biology, after which he earned both an MD and MBA with honors in healthcare management at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Wharton School of Business. He then completed a residency in internal medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, followed by a gastroenterology fellowship at the Columbia campus of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nAs a member of the medical faculty at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University and now at Mount Sinai, Dr. Smithâs clinical practice has focused on the diagnosis and management of esophageal disease, with a particular interest in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer. His research has investigated how new tools, techniques and medications are best incorporated into everyday treatment of these conditions. Dr. Smith has given invited lectures throughout the US and around the world, and has served as a mentor to many physicians new to endoluminal treatments for Barrett's esophagus. He is a founding member, treasurer and executive committee member of the American Foregut Society, and will serve as the society's president in 2025-26.\n\nâ\n\nDr. Souza trained at Howard University, Beth Israel Hospital (Boston), and the University of Maryland Medical Center. She is an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the Dallas VA Medical Center. Dr. Souzaâs laboratory focuses on exploring molecular mechanisms through which the gastroesophagealreflux of acid and bile mediates the development of Barrettâs esophagus, the condition in which a metaplastic epithelium predisposed to malignancy replaces the squamous epithelium normally lining the distal esophagus. Her laboratory has demonstrated differences between esophageal squamous cells in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with and without Barrettâs esophagus in the signaling pathways that are activated by acid and bile salts. Those findings have formed the basis for her highly original perspective on why Barrettâs esophagus develops in only a minority of GERD patients. Her laboratory also focuses on how GERD might contribute to carcinogenesis in Barrettâs esophagus. Most recently, she has shown that gastroesophageal reflux elicits an immune-mediated injury (rather than a caustic chemical injury) as the initial pathogenetic event in reflux esophagitis, a finding that challenges long-held views on the development of that condition. In partnership with Dr. Stuart Jon Spechler, Dr. Souza combines traditional in vitro approaches to the study of disease with a novel, in vivo, translational approach involving perfusion of the human esophagus with acid or bile salts during endoscopic examination. As a result, Dr. Souzaâs work has had substantial impact on the clinical management of patients with GERD and Barrettâs esophagus.\n\nDr. Wani is the Katy O and Paul M Rady Endowed Chair in Esophageal Cancer Research and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus specializing in esophageal diseases and therapeutic endoscopy. He has a long-standing research focus in the field of Barrettâs esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Over the past 10 years, he has developed a successful track record of: a) conducting epidemiologic studies that have defined the natural history of Barrettâs esophagus and Barrettâs associated dysplasia, b) conducting studies that demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of endoscopic eradication therapies for management of Barrettâs esophagus related dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma, c) developing novel quality indicators and outcome metrics for endoscopic eradication therapies in Barrettâs esophagus developed by the Treatment with Resection and Endoscopic Ablation Techniques for Barrettâs esophagus (TREAT-BE) Consortium, d) conducting studies to improve the effectiveness of current screening and surveillance strategies using devices such as the Cytosponge and advanced imaging techniques, and e) authoring national GI society guidelines on endoscopic eradication therapy for Barrettâs related neoplasia patients (American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy - ASGE), Barrettâs esophagus with low-grade dysplasia (American Gastroenterological Association â AGA) and screening and surveillance in Barrettâs esophagus (ASGE). All of these studies utilize resources of not only local expertise but international multidisciplinary collaborations that foster rapid and meaningful outcomes to improve care of Barrettâs esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. Administrative experience: Dr. Wani established and serves as the Executive Director of the Katy O and Paul M Rady Esophageal and Gastric Center of Excellence at the University of Colorado. The Esophageal and Gastric Multidisciplinary Clinic at the University of Colorado Cancer Center has evaluated >1000 patients with esophageal and gastric premalignant and malignant conditions. This infrastructure has served as the backbone for several of his research programs. Dr. Wani has established a number of productive collaborations including the TREAT-BE consortium and engagement with the co-investigators that will foster engagement in this grant. He continues to serve on several national committees and recently chaired the ASGE Standards of Practice (Guidelines Committee) and served the ACG Research Committee and the AGA CGIT and Research Committee. He was also recognized as a Future Leader in Gastroenterology by the AGA.\n\nHis research has been published in several high impact journals such as Gastroenterology, Gut, American Journal of Gastroenterology and Cancer and presented at national (Digestive Disease Week) and international GI meetings.
