The request seeks documents related to communications “by and within the company on various indications” for the heart-shocking devices, the company said in its filing.\n\nSt. Jude said it doesn’t expect the FDA’s letter on the promotion of the ablation devices to affect sales. Cardiac ablation devices are used to treat irregular heartbeats by destroying the tissue causing the irregularity.\n\nThe ablation device line was acquired by St. Jude in its acquisition of Epicor Medical Inc. for $185 million in June 2004.\n\nWhite Rock Bank scolded by Commerce\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Commerce has made public a consent order with Cannon Falls, Minn.-based White Rock Bank.\n\nThe bank, which dates to 1915, had assets of about $154 million as of March 31 and a profit of $272,000. But White Rock’s capital ratios — the percentage of capital to assets — in its first-quarter report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. were below the minimums required by the consent order, which took effect April 23.\n\nCommerce asked that the bank maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 11 percent, above the level regulators consider healthy; White Rock Bank’s ratio on March 31 was 7.58 percent, below the 8 percent regulators consider adequate.\n\nThe order also states that White Rock’s board must reduce its exposure to assets classified as “substandard” or “doubtful” in a recent bank exam, refrain from making loans to problem borrowers and not add to its brokered deposits.\n\nWhite Rock also has branches in Goodhue and Red Wing.\n\nNonprofit wins $500K Sam’s Club grant\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Fund USA, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit that helps create jobs and business opportunities in low- and middle-income neighborhoods around the U.S., won a $500,000 “Giving Made Simple” grant from Sam’s Club.\n\nSam’s Club members and associates voted online for one of eight finalist organizations.\n\nFrank Altman, CRF USA founder and CEO, thanked Sam’s Club members and associates for selecting the nonprofit, saying, “CRF USA and our many lending partners can now bring better jobs to thousands of working men and women across the country.”\n\nBriefly\n\nC2 Imaging LLC, a newly formed affiliate of St. Paul-based Vomela Specialty Co., said Monday it completed the acquisition of the business and assets of C2 Media, a supplier and designer of digital and screen-printed graphic products. … Eden Prairie-based Alliant Techsystems received orders totaling $372 million to produce small-caliber ammunition for the U.S. Army Contracting Command in Rock Island, Ill. Alliant operates the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Mo., where the rounds will be produced. Alliant also announced a $52 million order for 120 mm training tank ammunition from the U.S. Army. The award is for the third year of a four-year contract. … Sourcebooks, Naperville, Ill., has acquired assets of Minneapolis-based Marianne Richmond Studios Inc., a Minneapolis-based publisher of gift books. Terms were not disclosed. … Avery Dennison Corp., the world’s largest label maker, sued rival Maplewood-based 3M Co. in federal court in Delaware, alleging infringement of a new U.S. patent for sheets of easily removable labels.\n\nInsider Trades\n\nTravelers: Jay Benet, chief financial officer, sold 4,166 shares Jan. 15 at $48.57 per share, 10(b) 5-1 plan, and 4,166 shares Jan. 29 at$50.75 per share, 10(b) 5-1 plan; holds 40,688 shares.
