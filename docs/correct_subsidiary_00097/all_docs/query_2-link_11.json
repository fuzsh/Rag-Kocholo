As a result, we are mailing to most of our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the Notice) instead of a paper copy of this Proxy Statement and our 2010 Annual Report. The Notices are being mailed to stockholders starting on or about March 7, 2011. We believe that this process allows us to provide our stockholders with the information they need in a more timely manner, while reducing the environmental impact. The Notice contains instructions on how to access those documents over the Internet. The Notice also contains instructions on how to request a paper copy of our proxy materials, including the attached Proxy Statement, our 2010 Annual Report and a form of proxy card or voting instruction card. All stockholders who have previously requested a paper copy of our proxy materials will continue to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail.\n\nYour vote is important. Whether or not you are able to attend the Annual Meeting in person, it is important that your shares be represented. Please vote as soon as possible.\n\nOn behalf of our Board of Directors, thank you for your participation in this important annual process.\n\nSunnyvale, California\n\nMarch 1, 2011\n\nPlease note that attendance at the Annual Meeting will be limited to stockholders as of the record date, or their authorized representatives, and guests of Intuitive Surgical.\n\nINTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.\n\nPROXY STATEMENT\n\nFOR\n\n2011 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\nWhy am I receiving these materials?\n\nOur Board of Directors (as sometimes referred to in this Proxy Statement as the Board) has made these materials available to you on the Internet, or has delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on April 21, 2011 at 3:00 p.m., Pacific Daylight Time, at the location and for the purposes as set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This solicitation is made on behalf of our Board of Directors and we will pay the entire cost of solicitation. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by telephone, fax or personal interview. No additional compensation will be paid to these directors, officers and employees for these services. We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $12,500 plus reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses. Our stockholders are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and are requested to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. The approximate date on which this Proxy Statement and form of proxy will be first sent and made available to stockholders is March 7, 2011.\n\nWhat is included in these materials?\n\nThese materials include:\n\nIf you received printed versions of these materials by mail, these materials also include the proxy card or voting instruction form for the Annual Meeting.\n\nWhat items will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?\n\nYou will be voting for the following proposals:\n\n1. The election of three Class II members to the Board of Directors to serve until the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Proposal No. 1 on page 41);\n\n2. The amendment and restatement to the 2010 Incentive Award Plan (Proposal No. 2 on page 42);\n\n3. Advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal No. 3 on page 49);\n\n4. Advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal No. 4 on page 50); and\n\n5. The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011(Proposal No. 5 on page 51).\n\nWhat are the Boards voting recommendations?\n\nThe Board recommends that you vote your shares:\n\nWhere are Intuitive Surgicals principal executive offices located, and what is Intuitive Surgicals main telephone number?\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1266 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, California 94086, and our main telephone number is (408) 523-2100.\n\nWhy did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?\n\nWe are pleased to continue to take advantage of the SEC rule that allows companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we have sent to most of our stockholders of record and beneficial owners a Notice regarding Internet availability of proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or to request a paper copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically on an ongoing basis. A stockholders election to receive proxy materials by mail or electronically by email will remain in effect until the stockholder terminates such election.\n\nHow can I get electronic access to the proxy materials?\n\nYou can view the proxy materials for the meeting on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. Please have your 12 digit control number available. Your 12 digit control number can be found on your Notice. If you received a paper copy of your proxy materials, your 12 digit control number can be found on your proxy card or voting instruction card.\n\nWhy did I receive a full set of proxy materials in the mail instead of a Notice regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials?\n\nWe are providing stockholders who have previously requested to receive paper copies of the proxy materials with printed copies of the proxy materials instead of a Notice. If you would like to reduce the environmental impact and the costs incurred by us in mailing proxy materials, you may elect to receive all future proxy materials electronically via email or the Internet. To sign up for electronic delivery, please follow the instructions provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card or voting instruction card, to vote using the Internet and, when prompted, indicate that you agree to receive or access stockholder communications electronically in future years.\n\nWho may vote at the Annual Meeting?\n\nThe Board of Directors set February 22, 2011 as the record date for the Annual Meeting. All stockholders of record who owned Intuitive Surgical common stock at the close of business on February 22, 2011 are entitled to receive notice of, to attend, and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of the Intuitive Surgical common stock has one vote on each matter, and there is no cumulative voting. At the close of business on the record date, there were 39,219,510 shares of common stock outstanding.\n\n2\n\nWhat is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name?\n\nStockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Companys transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, LLC (Computershare), you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Notice was sent directly to you by the Company. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a proxy card.\n\nBeneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and the Notice was forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting instruction form.\n\nHow can I vote my shares?\n\nIn PersonIf you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the meeting. If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee or trustee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name. If you are a beneficial owner, you are also invited to attend the meeting. Since a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from the organization that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting.\n\nVia the InternetYou may vote by proxy via the Internet by visiting www.proxyvote.com and entering the control number found in the Notice.\n\nBy TelephoneIf you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may vote by proxy by calling the toll free number found on the voting instruction form.\n\nBy MailIf you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, and if you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by proxy by filling out the proxy card and sending it back in the envelope provided. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail and you are a beneficial owner, you may vote by proxy by filling out the voting instruction form and sending it back in the envelope provided.\n\nWhat is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting?\n\nThe holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present at the Annual Meeting for the transaction of business. This is called a quorum. Your shares will be counted for purposes of determining if there is a quorum, whether representing votes for, withheld or abstained, if you:\n\nIf a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting will be adjourned until a quorum is obtained.\n\nHow are proxies voted?\n\nAll shares represented by valid proxies received prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted and, where a stockholder specifies by means of the proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with the stockholders instructions.\n\n3\n\nWhat happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?\n\nStockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you:\n\nthen the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board of Directors on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.\n\nBeneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, the organization that holds your shares may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your shares will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a broker non-vote.\n\nWhich ballot measures are considered routine or non-routine?\n\nThe ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 (Proposal No. 5) is considered a routine matter under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with Proposal No. 5.\n\nThe election of directors (Proposal No.1), the approval of the amendment and restatement to our 2010 Incentive Award Plan (Proposal No. 2), the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal No. 3) and the advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal No. 4) are matters considered non-routine under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore there may be broker non-votes on these four proposals.\n\nWhat is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?\n\nFor Proposal No. 1, each director must be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director by the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. This means that the number of votes cast FOR a director must exceed the number of votes cast AGAINST that director, with absentions and broker non-votes not counted as votes cast as either FOR or AGAINST such directors election.\n\nApproval of Proposal No. 2, No. 3, No.4 and No.5 require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.\n\nFor Proposal No. 4, if none of the frequency alternatives (one year, two years or three years) receive a majority vote, we will consider the frequency that receives the highest number of votes by stockholders to be the frequency that has been selected by stockholders, on an advisory basis.\n\n4\n\nHow are abstentions and broker non-votes treated?\n\nShares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions or broker non-votes will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Shares voted ABSTAIN on proposals other than the election of directors will have the same effect as voting against the matter. Broker non-votes are not deemed to be entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether stockholder approval of a matter has been obtained. As a result, broker non-votes are not included in the tabulation of voting results on any proposal for purposes of determining whether proposals have been approved. In order to minimize the number of broker non-votes, the Company encourages you to provide voting instructions to the organization that holds your shares by carefully following instructions provided on the Notice.\n\nCan I change my vote?\n\nYou may revoke your proxy at any time before it is actually voted at the Annual Meeting by:\n\nYour attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, constitute revocation of your proxy. You may also be represented by another person present at the Annual Meeting by executing a form of proxy designating that person to act on your behalf. Shares may only be voted by or on behalf of the record holder of shares as indicated in our stock transfer records. If you are a beneficial stockholder but your shares are held of record by another person, such as a stock brokerage firm or bank, that person must vote the shares as the record holder in accordance with the beneficial holders instructions.\n\nWho will serve as the inspector of election?\n\nA representative from Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will serve as the inspector of election to determine whether or not a quorum is present and to tabulate votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting.\n\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?\n\nThe preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. The final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election and published in our current report on Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting.\n\nHow can I attend the Annual Meeting?\n\nAttendance at the Annual Meeting is limited to stockholders. Admission to the Annual Meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Each stockholder may be asked to present valid picture identification such as a drivers license or passport and proof of stock ownership as of the record date. The use of cell phones, smartphones, pagers, recording and photographic equipment, and/or computers is not permitted in the meeting rooms at the Annual Meeting.\n\n5\n\nDeadline for receipt of stockholder proposals for 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nAny stockholder who meets the requirements of the proxy rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), may submit to the Board of Directors proposals to be considered for submission to the stockholders at the Annual Meeting in 2012. In order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy material to be disseminated by the Board of Directors, your proposal must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and be submitted in writing by notice delivered or mailed by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, to our Corporate Secretary at Intuitive Surgical, Inc., 1266 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, California 94086 and must be received no later than November 8, 2011. Your notice must include:\n\nThe chairperson of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the introduction of your proposal if it is not made in compliance with the foregoing procedures or the applicable provisions of our Bylaws. Our Bylaws also provide for separate notice procedures to recommend a person for nomination as a director or to propose business to be considered by stockholders at a meeting outside the processes of Rule 14a-8. To be considered timely under these provisions, the stockholders notice must be received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address set forth below no earlier than December 23, 2011 and no later than January 22, 2012. If the date of our 2012 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after April 21, 2012, the stockholders notice must be received by not later than the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made. A stockholder providing such notice must also further update and supplement such notice so that the information provided or required to be provided is true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is 10 business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement must be received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices not later than 5 business days after the record date for the meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date) and not later than 8 business days prior to the date for the meeting or, if practicable, any adjournment or postponement thereof (and, if not practicable, on the first practicable date prior to the date to which the meeting has been adjourned or postponed). Our Bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholders notice. We recommend that any stockholder wishing to make a nomination for director or to bring any other item before an annual meeting, other than proposals intended to be included in the proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8, review a copy of our Bylaws, as amended and restated to date, which can be found at http://www.intuitivesurgical.com or, without charge, from our Corporate Secretary at the address below:\n\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc.\n\nAttn: Corporate Secretary\n\n1266 Kifer Road, Building 101\n\nSunnyvale, CA 94086-5304\n\n6\n\nDIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nGeneral Information\n\nThe Board of Directors, which is divided into three classes, has nine authorized seats. Three Class II directors are to be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve a three-year term expiring at the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until a successor has been elected and qualified. The remaining six directors will continue to serve their respective terms.\n\nOur Bylaws provide for a majority voting standard in uncontested elections of directors. As such, in an election where the number of nominees for director does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, a nominee for director will be elected to the Board of Directors if the number of shares voted for the nominee exceeds the number of shares voted against the nominee. The required quorum for a meeting of the Companys stockholders is a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the meeting. The majority voting standard would not apply, however, if the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected. In that case, the nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting would be elected.\n\nThe majority voting standard will apply to the election taking place at the meeting. Consequently, in order to be elected, a nominee must receive more for votes than against votes. Proxies may not be voted for more than the three nominees, and stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors. In the event any nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the meeting, the proxies will be voted for any nominee, if any, who may be designated by the Board of Directors to fill the vacancy. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors is not aware that any nominee is unable or will decline to serve as a director.\n\nOur Board is currently composed of a group of leaders with broad and diverse experience in many fields, including: management of large global enterprises; technology and innovation leadership; healthcare; financial services; legal and compliance; and corporate governance. In these positions, they have also gained significant and diverse management experience, including industry knowledge, strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management and leadership development. Many of the directors also have experience serving as executive officers, or on board of directors and board committees of other public companies, and have an understanding of corporate governance practices and trends. Other directors have significant academic and research experience and bring unique perspectives to the Board. The biographies below describes the skills, qualities, attributes and experiences of each of the nominees that led the Board to determine that it is appropriate to nominate these directors.\n\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board and the Board believe the skills, qualities, attributes and experiences of its current directors and director nominees provide the Company with business acumen and a diverse range of perspectives to engage each other and management to effectively address the evolving need of the Company and represent the best interests of the Companys stockholders.\n\n7\n\nThe names of the nominees and directors, their ages as of February 15, 2011 and certain other information about them are set forth below:\n\nName of Director\n\nAge\n\nPrincipal Occupation\n\nDirector\n\nSince\n\nClass I Directors with term expiring at the 2013 Annual Meeting:\n\nAmal M.

The Board of Directors will evaluate the appropriateness of the size of the Board from time to time. In establishing its size, the Board, as recommended by the Governance and Nominating Committee, considers a number of factors, including (i) resignations and retirements from the current Board; (ii) the availability of appropriate and qualified candidates; (iii) balancing the desire of having a small enough Board to facilitate deliberations with, at the same time, having a large enough Board to have the diversity of knowledge, experience, skills and expertise so that the Board and its committees can effectively perform their responsibilities in overseeing the Companys business and (iv) the goal of having an appropriate mix of inside and independent directors.\n\nOur Board is currently composed of a group of leaders with broad and diverse experience in many fields, including: management of large global enterprises; technology and innovation leadership healthcare; financial services; legal and compliance; and corporate governance. Our Board members have acquired these diverse skills through their accomplished careers and their service as directors of a wide range of other public and private companies.\n\nNomination Process\n\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee identifies director nominees by reviewing the desired experience, mix of skills and other qualities to assure appropriate Board composition, taking into consideration the current Board members and the specific needs of the Company and the Board.\n\n11\n\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee will consider nominees recommended by stockholders, and any such recommendations should be forwarded to the Governance and Nominating Committee in writing at our executive offices as identified in this Proxy Statement. Such recommendations should include the following information:\n\nWe will also request such other information as may reasonably be required to determine whether each person recommended by a security holder meets the criteria listed below and to enable us to make appropriate disclosures to the security holders entitled to vote in the election of directors. Any recommendations received from stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner as potential nominees suggested by board members, management or other parties.\n\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates director candidates based upon a number of criteria, including:\n\nBoard Responsibilities\n\nThe Boards primary responsibility is to seek to maximize long-term stockholder value. The Board selects the CEO of the Company, monitors managements and the Companys performance, and provides advice and counsel to management. Among other things, the Board at least annually reviews the Companys long-term strategy, longer-term business plan and an annual budget for the Company. The Board also reviews and approves transactions in accordance with guidelines that the Board may adopt from time to time. In fulfilling the Boards responsibilities, directors have full access to the Companys management, external auditors and outside advisors. With respect to the Boards role in risk oversight of the Company, the Board of Directors discusses the Companys risk exposures and risk management of various parts of the business, including appropriate guidelines and policies to minimize business risks and major financial risks and the steps management has undertaken to control them.\n\n12\n\nBoard Leadership\n\nThe Company is focused on its corporate governance practices and values independent board oversight as an essential component of strong corporate performance to enhance stockholder value. Our commitment to independent oversight is demonstrated by the fact that all of our directors, except our Chairman, and President and Chief Executive Officer, are independent. In addition, all of the members of our Boards committees are independent. Our Board of Directors acts independently of management and regularly holds independent director sessions of the Board without members of management present.\n\nMr. Smith is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Dr. Guthart is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Guthart is also a member of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has determined that the separation of the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is appropriate at this time as it allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus primarily on management and strategy responsibilities, while allowing our Chairman to focus on leadership of the Board, providing feedback and advice to the Chief Executive Officer and providing a channel of communication between the Board members and the Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman of the Board presides over all Board meetings and works with the Chief Executive Officer to develop agendas for Board meetings. The Chairman advises the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management on business strategy and leadership development. He also works with the Board to drive decisions about particular strategies and policies and, in concert with the independent Board committees, facilitates a performance evaluation process of the Board. We do not have a lead independent director. Our Board believes that the current board leadership structure is best for the Company and its stockholders at this time.\n\nBoard Committees\n\nOur Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Governance and Nominating committee. Our Board of Directors and its committees set schedules to meet throughout the year and also can hold special meetings and act by written consent from time to time, as appropriate. Our Board of Directors has delegated various responsibilities and authority to its committees as generally described below. The committees will regularly report on their activities and actions to the full Board of Directors. Each committee of our Board of Directors has a written charter approved by our Board of Directors which is available on our website at http://www.intuitivesurgical.com.\n\nDuring 2010, our Board of Directors held four meetings and each director attended all of those meetings. Members of the Board and its committees also consulted informally with management from time to time and acted at various times by written consent without a meeting during 2010.\n\nThe following table reflects the current membership of each Board committee:\n\nName\n\nCommittee Membership Audit\n\nCommittee Governance and\n\nNominating\n\nCommittee Compensation\n\nCommittee\n\nEric H.

In 2010, the Compensation Committee met two times and all members of the Compensation Committee attended all of those meetings. The Compensation Committee operates under a charter which can be found on the Companys website at http://www.intuitivesurgical.com.\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\n\nDuring 2010, the Compensation Committee consisted of Eric H. Halvorson, Amal M. Johnson and Alan J. Levy, Ph.D., none of whom is a present or former officer or employee of our Company. In addition, during 2010, none of our officers had an interlock relationship, as that term is defined by the SEC, to report.\n\nAttendance at the Annual Meeting\n\nWe encourage, but do not require, our Board members to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. All members of the Board of Directors attended our 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n14\n\nCOMPENSATION OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS\n\nDirector Compensation Table\n\nThe following Director Compensation Table sets forth summary information concerning the compensation paid to our non-employee directors in 2010 for services to our Company.\n\nName\n\nFees earned or\n\npaid in cash ($) Option\n\nAwards ($) (9) Total ($)\n\nRobert W.

Halvorson (Chairman) Amal M. Johnson Alan J. Levy, Ph.D.\n\nThis Proxy Statement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as projects, believes, anticipates, plans, expects, intends, may, will, could, should, would, and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to risks associated with our compensation programs. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are based on current expectation and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.\n\nCompensation Discussion & Analysis\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for 2010 should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. Actual compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from currently planned programs as summarized in this discussion.\n\nThis section explains the Companys executive compensation program as it relates to the following named executive officers or NEOs as of December 31, 2010 whose compensation information is presented in the tables following this discussion in accordance with SEC rules:\n\nName\n\nPosition\n\nGary S. Guthart President and Chief Executive Officer Lonnie M. Smith Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board Jerome J. McNamara Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing Marshall L. Mohr Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark J. Meltzer Senior Vice President and General Counsel\n\n17\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe Companys goal for its executive compensation program is to attract and retain a talented, entrepreneurial and creative team of executives who will provide leadership for the Companys success in driving da Vinci surgery to the broadest number of patients. The Company seeks to accomplish this goal in a way that is aligned with the long-term interests of the Companys stockholders. The Compensation Committee oversees the executive compensation program and determines the compensation for the Companys executive officers. The Company believes the compensation program for the named executive officers was instrumental in helping the Company achieve strong financial performance in the continually challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nIn 2010, the Companys revenue grew to $1,413 million, an increase of 34% over the prior year. Net income also increased to $381.8 million in 2010, an increase of 64% over the prior year. The Company generated cash flows from operating activities of $528.8 million driving a cash and investments balance at the end of 2010 of $1,608.9 million, an increase of $436.9 million over the prior year.\n\nIn 2010, each named executive officer was a member of the Companys executive team. Each named executive officer is expected to contribute as a member of the executive team to the Companys overall success rather than merely achieve specific objectives within that officers area of responsibility.\n\nThe Company continues to rely on long-term equity awards in the form of stock options to attract and retain an outstanding executive team and to ensure a strong connection between the executive compensation program and the long-term interests of the Companys stockholders. Stock options are granted to the named executive officers annually, on February 15th (or the next business day if February 15th is not a business day) and vest 1/8 at the end of six months and 1/48 each month through the end of a four-year vesting period.\n\nThe Company places less emphasis on total cash compensation than on long-term equity awards. The design of the Companys annual performance-based cash bonus program (Corporate Incentive Plan or CIP) for 2010 was set at 60% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and 40% of base salary for the other NEOs, except Mr. McNamara. Mr. McNamara is not subject to the CIP; instead, Mr. McNamaras incentive plan is based on the Companys Commission Plan (the Commission Plan) for our sales executives. As noted below, these target bonus opportunities are lower than the range commonly provided by peer companies.\n\nThe CIP is funded based on a predetermined increase in operating income goal, excluding non-cash stock compensation expense, and paid out to executives based on predetermined team performance goals. The team performance goals are related to market expansion, product development, manufacturing and quality, efficiency and cost performance and other areas directed at long-term stockholder value growth. Target and maximum levels are established for operating income and most performance goals which drive bonuses to be paid anywhere from 80% to 125% of the targets outlined above.\n\nThe Company achieved the 125% operating income goal and most of the team performance goals resulting in the Compensation Committee awarding the NEOs CIP payout at 118% to 121% of the individual goals outlined above. Mr. McNamara exceeded all of his sales and performance targets and the Compensation Committee awarded him a Commission Plan payout at 122% of his target. See The Role of Cash Compensation section below for more discussion on the CIP.\n\nIn 2010, each of the named executive officers received an increase in base salary following a review of each named executive officers performance, the Companys financial results and the competitive environment, as discussed above. See Base Salaries and Base Salary Increases sections below for more discussion on the determination of NEO base salaries.\n\nThe first part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, titled Executive Compensation Philosophy, discusses in greater detail the Companys philosophy and approach to executive compensation. The second part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, entitled Compensation Decisions for 2010, discusses the Compensation Committees compensation decisions for the named executive officers in 2010.\n\n18\n\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY\n\nGoal of Executive Compensation Program\n\nThe Companys goal for its executive compensation program is to attract and retain a talented, entrepreneurial and creative team of executives who will provide leadership for the Companys success in driving da Vinci surgery to the broadest number of patients. The Company seeks to accomplish this goal in a way that is aligned with the long-term interests of the Companys stockholders.\n\nDetermining Compensation for the Named Executive Officers\n\nTeam-Based Approach and Performance Expectations. Each of the named executive officers is a member of the Companys executive team. The compensation program for the named executive officers rests on two principles. First, each executive officer must demonstrate exceptional personal performance in order to remain part of the executive team. The Company believes that executives who underperform should be removed from the executive team and have their compensation adjusted accordingly, or be dismissed from the Company. Second, each executive officer must contribute as a member of the team to the Companys overall success rather than merely achieve specific objectives within that officers area of responsibility. Because of this team-based approach, the Company carefully considers the relative compensation levels among all members of the executive team. Accordingly, the Companys executive compensation program is designed to be internally consistent and equitable in order to further the Companys success and achieve the goal of the executive compensation program. The reasons for differences in the amounts awarded to each of the named executive officers relate primarily to the experience, responsibilities and performance of each named executive officer.\n\nEmphasis on Long-Term Equity Awards. The Company relies on long-term equity awards in the form of time-vested stock options because the Company believes stock options are the most effective compensation element for attracting entrepreneurial, creative executives and promoting their long-term commitment to the Company. To help promote retention, the Companys stock option awards typically vest 1/8 at the end of six months and 1/48 per month thereafter through a four year period and have a ten year term. Annual stock option awards are granted on February 15th (or the next business day if February 15th is not a business day). Awards are determined based on the contributions of the NEO during the prior year, on an assessment of the NEOs ability to contribute to the Company in future periods and the retention goals of the Company. The emphasis on long-term equity awards also is designed to align the interests of the named executive officers with the Companys stockholders by ensuring that executives have a significant portion of their compensation tied to long-term stock price performance.\n\nDiscretion and Judgment of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee determines all compensation for the named executive officers based on their interactions with them as well as Dr. Gutharts recommendation. All three Compensation Committee members are independent directors under the applicable NASDAQ and SEC rules. Each year, the Compensation Committee conducts an evaluation of each named executive officer to determine if changes in the officers compensation are appropriate based on the considerations described below. At the Compensation Committees request, Dr. Guthart reviews with the Compensation Committee the performance of the other named executive officers. The Compensation Committee gives considerable weight to Dr. Gutharts evaluations of the other named executive officers because of his direct knowledge of each executive officers performance and contributions.\n\nIn exercising its discretion to determine compensation, the Compensation Committee carefully considers the experience, responsibilities and performance of each named executive officer and the Companys overall financial performance. The Company recognizes that executive compensation practices are influenced by a wide range of complex factors, including changes in strategic goals, changing economic and industry conditions, accounting requirements and tax laws, and evolving governance trends. As a result, the Compensation Committees discretion and judgment are critical to designing an executive compensation program that achieves the Companys goal while also addressing these factors.\n\n19\n\nThe Compensation Committee presents its recommendation regarding the compensation and stock option grants for the named executive officers to the Board of Directors for their approval.\n\nElements of the Compensation Program\n\nThe Companys executive compensation program is simple in design. The compensation program for the NEOs includes:\n\n\n\nAnnual performance-based cash bonus awards; and\n\n\n\nBase salaries.\n\nThe named executive officers are also eligible to participate in the Companys health and welfare programs, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 401(k) Plan.\n\nThe Role of Long-Term Equity Awards\n\nOverview. The Company believes that long-term equity awards in the form of stock options are an extremely important way to attract and retain a talented executive team and align the executives interests with the Companys stockholders. Accordingly, executive compensation is weighted considerably toward long-term equity awards rather than cash compensation. In 2010, long-term equity awards for the named executive officers represented approximately 80% of the officers target total compensation. This compares to approximately 50% at peer companies.\n\nVesting Periods and Ten Year Option Terms Maximize Retention and Support Long-Term Focus. The Company believes granting awards with four year vesting periods and ten year terms creates a substantial retention incentive and also encourages the named executive officers to focus on the Companys long-term business objectives and long-term stock price performance. Stock options are awarded to employees, including the NEOs, each February 15th (or the next business day if February 15th is not a business day). Exceptions are made for executives who are promoted to the executive team or are recent hires. To determine the size of the stock option awards, the Compensation Committee first establishes a target compensation value to be delivered to the named executive officers through long-term equity awards. In doing so, the Compensation Committee considers various factors, including the following:\n\n\n\nThe officers experience and performance;\n\nOnce the target value has been established, the Compensation Committee determines the number of shares subject to the awards by reference to the current value of the Companys common stock and presents its recommendations to the Board of Directors for their approval.\n\nOption Grant Practice. The Compensation Committee has delegated the authority to the CEO to make initial option grants, within an approved range, to new employees, excluding Vice Presidents and executive team members. The Compensation Committee approves all grants made under the 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. During 2010, all initial hire grants were granted once a month on the fifth business day of each month for new hires in the previous month, at an exercise price equal to the closing sales price of our stock on the grant date. The Compensation Committee has also delegated the authority to the CEO to make focal option grants to all employees, excluding Vice Presidents and executive team members. For annual focal option grants to Vice Presidents and executive team members, the Compensation Committee must review and submit its\n\n20\n\nrecommendation for approval by the Board of Directors. These focal grants will be made on February 15th or the next trading day if February 15th is not a business day, at an exercise price equal to the closing sales price of our stock on the grant date. This timing enables management and the Compensation Committee to consider performance by both the Company and the individual and balance it against our expectations for the current year.\n\nWe do not time the granting of our options with any favorable or unfavorable news released by the Company. The initial grants are based on the timing of date of hire of our new employees. Proximity of any awards to an earnings announcement or other market events is coincidental.\n\nThe Role of Cash Compensation\n\nOverview. The Company believes that cash compensation is less effective than long-term equity awards in achieving the goal of the Companys executive compensation program. Accordingly, target cash compensation for the named executive officers, represented approximately 20% of the officers target total compensation in 2010 and is below the median of target cash compensation provided by peer companies. The named executive officers cash compensation includes performance-based cash bonus awards and base salaries.\n\nPerformance-Based Cash Bonus Awards. The Companys CIP for non-sales executive officers and Commission Plans for sales executives are designed to reward employees for achieving stretch financial and operating goals that are key to the success of our business and are aligned with the short and long-term interests of our stockholders.\n\nThe Company believes that CIP cash bonus awards and commission awards are an important component of the executive compensation program because they reward the named executive officers for achieving the annual performance goals established by the Company. However, the CIP cash bonus awards and commission awards represent a small percentage of the executives total compensation because the Company believes that cash bonus awards are less effective in attracting new executive talent than equity compensation, and they promote retention only in the short-term (the bonus performance period). In addition, the Company prefers to emphasize long-term stockholder value creation over annual operating results. Accordingly, the plan is modestly funded relative to peer companies, as reflected by the following:\n\nThe Company has established sales commission plans so that senior sales personnel may earn three to four times their base salary. The Company believes that these commission plans are an important part of compensation program for sales personnel as they incent the achievement of short term sales and represent a significant retention tool. Most of the companies that Intuitive Surgical competes with for sales talent are much larger than Intuitive Surgical and provide substantial compensation packages to their employees. The Company believes that these commission plans are competitive in the medical device industry.\n\nCIP Funding. The first step is comprised of an overall CIP plan funding (Plan Funding) goal tied to operating income, excluding stock option expense. Generally, the plan begins funding at the previous years operating income level, excluding stock option expense, to a maximum funding of 125% of the pool at a predetermined increase in operating income, excluding stock option expense. For 2010, funding was set at operating income for 2009 of $473 million, excluding stock option expense. Maximum funding of 125% of the pool was set at $650 million of operating income, excluding stock option expense. The Compensation Committee has approved the Plan Funding for 2011 to begin at the actual operating income achieved in 2010, excluding stock option expense, of $668 million.\n\n21\n\nPayout of Funded Amounts. In the second step, amounts funded in the first step are paid to employees based on goals established in the areas of product and market development, manufacturing and quality, efficiency and cost performance and other areas directed at long-term stockholder value enhancement. The amount of our incentive pool that will be paid out as incentive bonuses (Pay-Out Pool) for each NEO as well as each eligible employee is determined by an equal weighting of achievement of the operating income goal and team performance goals. The size of the Pay-Out Pool generally cannot exceed the size of the Plan Funding.\n\nTeam performance goals for the NEOs are established at the corporate level and are comprised of procedural growth, system sales growth and revenue growth, and goals related to fixed costs, marketing objectives, customer training effectiveness, product development, regulatory approvals and compliance, new product introductions, quality of production, applied research and intellectual property. Each NEO must contribute as a member of the team to the Companys overall success rather than merely achieve specific objectives within that officers area of responsibility. The corporate level goals are initially established by the executive team and the CEO and then reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors annually at the beginning of the year. Since the specific targets of our corporate performance goals are highly confidential, we do not publicly disclose specific objectives. Revealing specific objectives would provide competitors and other third parties with insights into the Companys confidential planning process and strategies, thereby causing competitive harm.\n\nThe nature of goals and the weighting assigned to each are subject to change annually. Recurring goals are generally set above prior year results and budgeted levels. The performance goals are designed to be aggressive, and there is a risk that payments will not be made at all or will be made at less than 100% of the target amount. The achievement of the goals may be affected by several factors including, but not limited to, the impact of global and regional conditions, credit market and the related impact on health care spending; timing and success of product development and market acceptance of developed products; and regulatory approvals, clearances and restrictions. Due to these factors which are not entirely controlled by the NEOs and the stretch nature of the goal setting, it is relatively difficult to achieve the corporate performance goals. The challenge of the goals and the uncertainty in the environment ensures that any payments under the plan are truly performance-based which is consistent with the plans objectives. Each NEOs share of the Pay-Out Pool will be based upon his or her individual performance and contribution to the achievement of the performance goals.\n\nOur cash incentives for our top sales executives, including one of our NEOs, Mr. McNamara, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing are tied fully to performance plans which are calculated based on the achievement of predetermined sales metrics, including revenue, surgical procedures completed, contribution margins and fixed costs (the Commission Plans). Under these Commission Plans, which are approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the year, the sales executives are assigned target and maximum levels for each metric which are then applied to a scaled bonus rate. The performance pay-out is scaled to the over-achievement of each metric.\n\nEach year, the bonus and commissions structures are reviewed to ensure that the design and payment structure falls in line with our compensation philosophy. At the end of each year, the Compensation Committee determines the amount of the award to be paid to each officer by comparing actual results to the performance goals. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, reduce or increase the amount of any individual award based on the officers overall performance and his contribution to the achievement of the corporate performance goals.\n\nBase Salaries. The Compensation Committee determines base salaries for each named executive officer based on the executive officers role and responsibilities, a review of any applicable market data and individual job performance. The Company believes that base salaries are less important than long-term equity awards in achieving the goal of the Companys executive compensation program. The de-emphasized role of base salaries as part of the executive compensation program is demonstrated by the fact that base salaries are below the 50th percentile of peer companies for the named executive officers.\n\n22\n\nEmployment Agreements or Other Arrangements\n\nChange in Control Plan. In December 2008, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the Companys Severance Plan (the Change in Control Plan). The Board believes the adoption of the Change in Control Plan is beneficial to our stockholders because it minimizes the uncertainty presented to our valuable workforce in the case of a change in control. Under this plan, all eligible employees of the Company who have been employed at least six months prior to the separation from service date, including executive officers, are entitled to the following severance benefits in the event of a termination of employment without cause or an involuntary separation from service within twelve months after a change in control of the Company:\n\nSee Potential Payment Upon Termination or Change in Control section below for detailed discussions of the Change in Control Plan and estimates of the compensation that would have been payable to the NEOs, had they been triggered at December 31, 2010.\n\nOther Arrangements. The named executive officers are employed at will. Based on the Companys philosophy, the compensation program for the named executive officers does not include any of the following pay practices:\n\n\n\nTax reimbursements; and\n\n\n\nSupplemental executive retirement benefits.\n\nIn addition, the Company does not provide any perquisites or change in control benefits to the named executive officers that are not available to other employees.\n\nEmployment Agreement with Lonnie Smith. The Company does not have any employment agreements with any named executive officers, except with Mr. Smith. Upon the commencement of Mr. Smiths new role effective January 2010, the key provisions of his employment agreement with the Company had been amended to an annual salary of $300,000 (further amended to $200,000 per annum effective July 1, 2010 and to $100,000 per annum effective January 1, 2011), a target bonus percentage of 40% (performance-based, not a guaranteed bonus), along with stock options as approved by the Board. Specifically, Mr. Smith was not entitled to any severance under the Companys Change in Control Plan upon the commencement of his new role effective January 1, 2010. Effective January 1, 2011, Mr. Smith will no longer participate in the Companys CIP.\n\nOther Considerations\n\nThe Role of Compensation Consultants. For 2010, the Compensation Committee did not retain any compensation consultants for executive compensation benchmarking. The Compensation Committee selected and directly retained the services of Compensia, an independent executive compensation consulting firm in mid-2009, which completed a comprehensive compensation analysis on executive compensation for 2009. Our current practice is to review our executive compensation every two years.\n\n23\n\nThe Role of Peer Companies and Benchmarking. While we do not believe that it is appropriate to establish compensation levels based solely on benchmarking, we believe that information regarding pay practices at other companies is nevertheless useful in two respects. First, we recognize that compensation practices must be competitive in the marketplace. Second, independent marketplace information is one of several factors we consider in assessing the reasonableness of compensation. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee approved the engagement of Compensia to assist with updating our peer group and assessing the competitiveness of our executive compensation program in 2009. Peer groups were used for three purposes:\n\n\n\nDirect Peer Group\n\n\n\nPrimary comparison for aggregate company equity utilization\n\n\n\nReference Peer Group\n\n\n\nBroad Peer Group\n\n\n\nSecondary reference point used to compare executive compensation\n\nTwo selection criteria were used to establish our Direct Peer Group including:\n\n1. Revenue ($450 million to $2.25 billion)\n\n2. Market capitalization ($3 billion to $12 billion)\n\nWhen compared to our 2008 Direct Peer Group, 100% of the existing direct peers met the revenue criterion; conversely 50% of the direct peers did not achieve the market capitalization criterion. Nevertheless, given recent stock market volatility, we determined to retain these companies and will re-examine whether we should continue to include them in 2011. In 2009, two peers were acquired (Respironics, Advanced Medicals Optics) and one merged (Invitrogen).\n\nIn 2009, our Direct Peer Group consisted of Bio-Rad Laboratories, CONMED, Edwards Lifesciences, Haemonetics, Hologic, IDEXX Laboratories, Illumina, Integra LifeSciences Holdings, Inverness Medical Innovations, Kinetic Concepts, Medicis Pharmaceutical, Millipore, ResMed, Sirona Dental Systems, Varian Medical Systems and Waters Corp.\n\nIn addition to our direct peers, we created a Reference Peer Group to gain additional perspective on labor market competitors. In 2009, this peer group consisted of Applied Materials, Boston Scientific, Covidien, Johnson & Johnson, KLA-Tencor, Lam Research, Medtronic, Novellus Systems, Smith & Nephew, St. Jude Medical and Stryker.\n\nFinally in 2009, our Broad Peer Group included life sciences industry (LSI) and technology industry (High-Tech) market norms provided by Radford. A custom data cut from the Radford Life Science Survey consisting of U.S.-based, public, non-subsidiary life science companies with revenues 1/3 to 3x that of the Company was included. Secondarily a custom cut from the Radford Executive Compensation Survey was used with scope factors of U.S.-based, public, non-subsidiary technology companies with revenues 1/3 to 3x and market capitalization to revenues ratio greater than 2x that of the Company.\n\nThe Compensation Committee reviews compensation practices at peer companies to inform the Committees decision-making process so it can set total compensation levels that it believes are reasonably\n\n24\n\ncompetitive. The Compensation Committee, however, does not set compensation components to meet specific benchmarks, such as targeting salaries above the median or equity compensation at the 75th percentile. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee believes that over-reliance on benchmarking can result in compensation that is unrelated to the value delivered by the named executive officers.\n\nThe Role of Shareholder Say-on-Pay Votes. In 2011, the Company has provided its stockholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive compensation. See Proposal Nos. 3 and 4 below. Although the stockholder vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers.\n\nTax Deductibility of Compensation Expense. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that the Company can deduct in any one year for compensation paid to the chief executive officer and the three most highly-compensated named executive officers employed by the Company at the end of the year (other than the Companys chief financial officer). However, the $1 million deduction limit does not apply to compensation that is performance-based and provided under a plan that has been approved by the Companys stockholders. While the Compensation Committee considers the deductibility of awards as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee also looks at other factors in making its decisions as noted above and retains the flexibility to grant awards it determines to be consistent with the Companys goal for its executive compensation program even if the award is not deductible by the Company for tax purposes.\n\nThe awards under the CIP and Commission Plans are not designed to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) for tax deductibility. Certain awards under the 2010 Incentive Award Plan, including stock options, may qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) for tax deductibility.\n\nCOMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR 2010\n\nLong-Term Equity Awards\n\nIn fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Compensation Committee authorized the following equity grants for the named executive officers based on its assessment of the factors discussed in the section titled The Role of Long-Term Equity Awards:\n\nOptions Granted (#)\n\nNEO\n\n2011 2010 2009\n\nGary S. Guthart\n\n31,875 37,500 60,000\n\nLonnie M. Smith\n\n5,000 18,000 60,000\n\nJerome J. McNamara\n\n25,000 30,000 50,000\n\nMarshall L. Mohr\n\n16,000 18,750 30,000\n\nMark J. Meltzer\n\n16,000 17,000 30,000\n\nIn January 2011, the Compensation Committee approved annual stock grants for certain eligible employees. Given the Companys commitment of a net three-year average burn rate (see below) of 3.0% in the long term, options grants to employees, including NEOs, were reduced relative to prior years.\n\nWe believe the Companys executive compensation policy is closely aligned with stockholders interests. While salary and an annual cash incentive bonus represent the achievement of shorter term goals, stock option awards, with a four-year vesting schedule and ten-year term, represent a longer term compensation structure that promotes retention and continuous commitment to the operating results of the Company. Annual stock option grants occur every February and reflect the value of ones individual contribution to the Company, both present and future. At this phase in the Companys growth cycle, a majority of executive annual compensation is derived\n\n25\n\nfrom the value of options granted. The following chart displays the historical relationship between our CEOs annual compensation and the change in stockholder value as reflected by the percentage change in value of the Companys common stock price. For comparative purposes, CEO annual compensation consists of salary, accrued bonus, plus the value of equity compensation paid out in February of the following year (the value of the 2011 equity compensation was estimated).\n\n* The CEO Compensation decrease in 2009 reflects the change in responsibilities for Lonnie Smith relative to the transition of Gary Guthart as CEO in January 2010.\n\n26\n\nAlthough a majority of our executive compensation is derived from stock compensation, named executive officer grants as a percentage of total grants have shown a continued decrease year over year. This trend reflects managements commitment to support equitable grants across the organization, through lowering their stake and facilitating participation by all employees in the stock compensation program. As a result, the number of executive grants have declined on average by 15% per year, in each of the past two years (including the February 2011 grant).\n\nBurn rate. In administering our equity program, we actively manage our grants in accordance with a target burn rate. We define burn rate as the number of equity awards granted in the year, net of cancellations and expirations, divided by the sum of the undiluted weighted average shares of our common stock outstanding during the year plus the number of options that have been issued and are outstanding. The burn rate measures the potential dilutive effect of our annual equity grants. The total number of options granted in 2010 was 1,407,222 and the number of options cancelled or expired was 234,772. As of December 31, 2010 the weighted average number of shares outstanding was 39,152,419 and the total number of granted options outstanding was 4,813,070. For fiscal 2010, our burn rate was 2.7%, and our three-year average burn rate from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 was 3.0%. Similarly, our burn rate as calculated using shareholder advocacy group methodology is below the mean plus one standard deviation of the Companys Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) group segmented within the Russell 3000 Index. We believe that our burn rate is reasonable in relation to companies in our industry and reflects a judicious use of equity for compensation purposes.\n\n27\n\nBase Salary Increases\n\nBase salaries for executives are reviewed annually in July or more frequently should there be significant changes in responsibilities. In each case, we take into account the results achieved by the executive, his or her future potential, scope of responsibilities and experience, and competitive salary practices.\n\nThe Compensation Committee approved base salary increases, reflected in the table below, which take into consideration the Companys team-based approach and the scope of the executives role and responsibilities relative to other members of the executive team. After giving effect to these increases, the named executive officers total cash compensation opportunities still remain below the median of peer companies due to the Companys philosophy of setting target and maximum bonus opportunities at levels lower than the range commonly provided by peer companies and because there is no long-term cash bonus program at the Company.\n\nName\n\nOctober 1, 2009 ($) August 1, 2010 ($)\n\nGary S.

Effective August 1, 2010, Dr. Gutharts base salary was increased by $10,000 or 2%, prorated for the January 1, 2010 increase.\n\n(2) Mr. Smith resigned from his role of Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2010 and remains as an executive officer of the Company and Chairman of the Board of Directors. His base salary was reduced to $300,000 at that time. Mr. Smiths base salary was further reduced to $200,000, effective July 1, 2010 and to $100,000 effective January 1, 2011, in light of his continuing reduced time commitment to the Company.\n\nPerformance-Based Cash Bonus Awards\n\nThe Companys 2010 performance exceeded the maximum goals for adjusted sales and adjusted operating income established by the Compensation Committee for the bonus program. As a result, the incentive pool was funded at 125% of the total targeted cash amount. The amounts earned are a reflection of the Companys performance as well as the NEOs individual performance against their goals. The table below shows each named executive officers performance-based cash bonus award for 2010, which was earned in fiscal 2010 and paid in fiscal 2011.\n\nName\n\n2010 Bonus Award ($)\n\nGary S.

The Company, after reviewing and discussing the compensation programs with the Compensation and Audit Committees of the Board, believes that the programs are balanced and do not motivate or encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking because of the following:\n\n28\n\nBecause of the above, the compensation programs appropriately balance risk and the desire to focus employees on specific short-term goals important to the Companys success.\n\n29\n\nCOMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\n2010 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\n\nThe following Summary Compensation Table sets forth summary information concerning the compensation paid to our NEOs in years ending December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 for services to our Company in all capacities.\n\n(1) The amounts in this column represent the grant date fair values of the option awards granted to the executive in the fiscal year in accordance with stock compensation accounting.

Mr. McNamara is under the Commission Plan and the target is calculated based on achieving 100% of predetermined sales metrics. At its discretion, the Compensation Committee has the authority to pay any NEO in excess of or below his targeted bonus amount. The goals for 2010 were approved by the Compensation Committee in January 2010. The payout amounts for each NEO were reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors in January 2011 upon completion of the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2010.
