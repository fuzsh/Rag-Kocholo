There are over 700,000 strokes per year in the United States alone. Approximately 100,000 of these are hemorrhagic and 600,000 are ischemic (either due to vessel narrowing or to embolism). A large number of strokes are believed to be caused or related to a defect in the heart called a patent foramen ovale, or to thrombus formation due to an irregularity in the heart beat called atrial fibrillation. Although there are pharmacological therapies for stroke prevention such as oral or systemic administration of warfarin or the like, these have been found inadequate due to serious side effects of the medications and lack of patient compliance in taking the medication.\n\nthe heart is generally divided into four chambers: the upper two are the left and right atria and the lower two are the left and right ventricles.\n\nthe atria are separated from each other by a muscular wall, the interatrial septum, and the ventricles by the interventricular septum.\n\nabno â nal openings, holes or shunts can occur between the chambers of the heart or the great vessels (interatrial and interventricular septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus and aortico-pulmonary window respectively), causing shunting of blood through the opening.\n\ncardiac and interventricular septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus and aortico-pulmonary window respectively are open.\n\na patent foramen ovale is a condition wherein an abnormal opening is present in the septal wall between the two atria of the heart.\n\nAn atrial septal defect is a condition wherein a hole is present in the septal wall between the two atria of the heart.\n\na patent foramen ovale tends to behave like a flap valve. Accordingly, the axis of the patent foramen ovale tends to be at an angle, and almost parallel to the septal wall.\n\nthe patent foramen ovale is a virtual tunnel, long and wide, but not very tall. It is normally closed because the roof and floor of the tunnel are in contact, but it can open when the pressure in the right side of the heart becomes elevated relative to the pressure in the left side of the heart, such as while coughing.\n\nthe clots or plaque can then travel to the brain or other tissues to cause a thromboembolic event like a stroke.\n\nthe clots may pass to the arterial side when there is an increase in the pressure in the right atrium. Then the clots travel through the left side of the heart, to the aorta, and then to the brain via the carotid arteries where they cause a stroke.\n\npatent foramen ovale have required relatively extensive surgical techniques for correction.\n\nthe most common method of closing intracardiac shunts such as a patent foramen ovale, entails the relatively drastic technique of open-heart surgery, requiring opening the chest or sternum and diverting the blood from the heart with the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nthe heart is then opened, the defect is sewn shut by direct suturing with or without a patch of synthetic material (usually of Dacron, Teflon, silk, nylon or pericardium), and then the heart is closed.\n\nthe patient is then taken off the cardiopulmonary bypass machine, and then the chest is closed.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia of the heart that results in a rapid and chaotic heartbeat that produces lower cardiac output and irregular and turbulent blood flow in the vascular system.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is associated with a 500 percent greater risk of stroke due to the condition.\n\na patient with atrial fibrillation typically has a significantly decreased quality of life due, in part, to the fear of a stroke, and the pharmaceutical regimen necessary to reduce that risk.\n\nLAA left atrial appendage\n\nthe LAA is a cavity which looks like a small finger or windsock and which is connected to the lateral wall of the left atrium between the mitral valve and the root of the left pulmonary vein.\n\nthe LAA normally contracts with the rest of the left atrium during a normal heart cycle, thus keeping blood from becoming stagnant therein, but often fails to contract with any vigor in patients experiencing atrial fibrillation due to the discoordinate electrical signals associated with AF.\n\nthrombus formation is predisposed to form in the stagnant blood within the LAA.\n\na method of preventing ingress of material into the left atrium of a heart includes: providing a delivery sheath having a sheath proximal end, a sheath distal end, and a lumen extending therethrough, to the right atrium of the heart; advancing the sheath distal end through an opening between the right atrium and the left atrium; providing an expandable cage, having a proximal end, a distal end, a plurality of supports extending therebetween, a first membrane provided at the proximal end, and a second membrane provided at the distal end, the expandable cage having a collapsed configuration to be received within the lumen of the delivery sheath, and an expanded configuration for deployment within the heart; delivering the expandable cage to the left atrium of the heart through the delivery sheath; and expanding the expandable cage within the left atrium, the expandable cage when expanded positioning the second membrane at the ostium of the left atrial appendage, wherein the second membrane prevents passage\n\nthe opening can be a natural opening, and the opening can be formed by piercing the atrial septum.\n\nthe opening is a patent foramen ovale or a septal defect.\n\nthe cage can be self expanding, and can be expanded by retracting the delivery sheath proximally.\n\nthe delivering step includes pulling the delivery sheath proximally with respect to the expandable cage prior to said expanding step.\n\nthe delivering step includes pushing the expandable cage past the sheath distal end prior to said expanding step.\n\ndelivering the expandable cage includes positioning the cage distal of the distal end prior to said expanding step.\n\nthe method can further include verifying the position of the expandable cage within the left atrium, wherein said verifying is performed prior to said expanding step, repositioning said cage within the left atrium, and/or retrieving said cage from the left atrium.\n\na method of preventing ingress of material to a chamber of a heart includes: providing an expandable cage to a chamber of a heart, wherein said chamber has at least two openings, and wherein said expandable cage comprises a proximal end, a distal end, a plurality of supports extending therebetween, and at least one membrane, the expandable cage having a collapsed configuration for delivery to the heart, and an expanded configuration for deployment within the heart; and expanding said expandable cage within the chamber of the heart, wherein said at least one membrane is positioned at one of said at least two openings of the chamber to prevent ingress of material into the chamber.\n\nOne of said at least two openings can be an ostium to a left atrial appendage, a patent foramen ovale, or a septal defect.\n\nthe membrane can filter blood from a left atrial appendage and/or substantially prevent blood flow from a right atrium into a left atrium the heart.\n\nan expandable cage for preventing ingress of material to a chamber of a heart includes: a frame including a proximal end, a distal end, and a plurality of supports extending therebetween, wherein said cage has a collapsed configuration for delivery to a chamber of the heart, and an expanded configuration for deployment within the heart; and at least one membrane provided at at least one of said proximal and said distal ends, wherein a length between said proximal and distal ends when at least partially expanded generally approximates the distance between an ostium of a left atrial appendage and a septum of the heart.\n\nthe at least one membrane can include a proximal membrane provided at said proximal end and a distal membrane provided at said distal end.\n\nthe at least one membrane can have a diameter corresponding to the dimensions of a patent foramen ovale or a diameter corresponding to the dimensions of an ostium of a left atrial appendage.\n\nthe proximal end includes supports that extend proximally, distally, and proximally from an apex to a proximal hub.\n\na system for preventing ingress of material to a chamber of a heart includes and expandable cage; and a transseptal sheath for delivering the expandable cage to the chamber.\n\nFigure IA is an anterior illustration of a heart, with the proximal portions of the great vessels;\n\nFigure IB is a partial cross-sectional view of the heart of Figure 2;\n\nFigure 2 is a schematic, partial cross-sectional view of an intracardiac cage implanted in a chamber of a heart.\n\nFigure 3 is a perspective view of an intracardiac cage in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFigure 3A is a side elevational view of the intracardiac cage of Figure 3;\n\nFigure 3B is an end view taken along the line 3B-3B of Figure 3 A;\n\nFigure 3C is one embodiment of an intracardiac cage having branched portions\n\nFigure 3D is one embodiment of an intracardiac cage having serpentine spring portions\n\nFigure 3E is one embodiment of the end portion of an intracardiac cage\n\nFigure 3F is a top view of a fracturable support\n\nFigure 3 G is a side view of the fracturable support of Figure 3F;\n\nFigure 4 is a partial cross-sectional view of an intracardiac cage according to another embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFIGS 5-7 are perspective views of an intracardiac cage according to additional embodiments of the present invention.\n\nFigures 8-9 are perspective views of a delivery system for delivering the intracardiac cage of Figures 3-7 to a desired location within the heart;\n\nFigure 10 is a detailed view of the distal end of the delivery system of Figure 9;\n\nFigure 11 is a partial cross-sectional view of the axially moveable core of Figures 8-10;\n\nFigure HA is a cross-sectional view taken along line 1 IA-I IA of Figure i i;\n\nFigure 12 is a perspective view of an intracardiac cage coupled to the axially moveable core of Figure 1 1 ;\n\nFigures 13A-13C are perspective views of a transseptal sheath in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.\n\nFigure 14 is a perspective view of a dilator in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.\n\nFigure 14A is a detailed view of the distal end of the dilator of Figure 14.\n\nFigures 15A-15N are schematic, partial cross-sectional views showing the delivery and deployment of an intracardiac cage to the left atrium of a patient's heart.\n\nFigure IA is a heart 100 and certain portions including the left ventricle 102, the left atrium 104, the left atrial appendage 106, the pulmonary artery 108, the aorta 110, the right ventricle 112, the right atrium 114, and the right atrial appendage 1 16.\n\nthe left atrium 104 is located above the left ventricle 102 and the two are separated by the mitral valve (not illustrated).\n\nFigure IB is a partial cross-sectional view of the heart 100 of FIG. IA with additional features shown.\n\nDeoxygenated blood generally enters the right atrium 114 from the upper portion of the body via the superior vena cava 202 and from the lower portion of the body via the inferior vena cava 204.\n\nthe blood is pumped from the right atrium 114 into the right ventricle 112 through the tricuspid valve 206 and then to the lungs (not shown) through the pulmonary valve 208 and pulmonary arteries 108.\n\nOxygenated blood returns to the heart 100 from the lungs via the pulmonary veins 210, which direct the blood into the left atrium 104. As the heart 100 pumps, the oxygenated blood passes from the left atrium 104 into the left ventricle 102 via the mitral valve 212. Blood exits the left ventricle 102 via the aortic valve 214 and aorta 110, which distributes the oxygenated blood to the body via the circulatory system.\n\na septum 216 separates the left side of the heart 100 from its right side, and prevents blood from flowing directly therebetween.\n\nan interatrial septum (not shown) separates the right atrium 114 from the left atrium 104\n\nan interventricular septum separates the right ventricle 112 from the left ventricle 102.\n\nthe interatrial septum and interventricular septum are sometimes referred to as the atrial septum and ventricular septum, respectively.\n\nFIG. 2-7 Embodiments of structures suitable for blocking an opening to a chamber of the heart are illustrated in Figures 2-7. It should be understood that although the embodiments described herein may be referred to as blocking, the same embodiments are also suitable for filtering, sealing, closing off, or plugging, both totally or partially.\n\nFIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of an intracardiac cage 300 implanted in a left atrium 104 of a patient.\n\nthe cage 300 has a proximal end 302 positioned against the atrial septum 216, and a distal end 304 positioned against the ostium of the left atrial appendage 106.\n\na first membrane 500A is provided at the proximal end of the cage 300 to create a barrier to the ingress of material, such as particles or fluid or both, into the left atrium 104 through any opening that maybe located in the atrial septum 216, such as a septal defect, patent foramen ovale, or a puncture opening used for accessing the left atrium 104.\n\nthe intracardiac cage 300 may be used to close multiple atrial septal defects occurring in a patient's heart.\n\na second membrane 500B is provided at the distal end of the cage 300 to create a barrier to the ingress of material, such as particles or fluid or both, into the left atrium 104 from the left atrial appendage 106.\n\nthe cage 300 may have any suitable configuration adapted to span the distance between the septum 216 and the atrial appendage 106 and position the membranes 500A and 500B across an opening in the septum 216 and the ostium of the atrial appendage 106. Although two membranes 500A, 500B are illustrated on the cage 300, it will be appreciated that only one membrane may be used, if desired, to provide a barrier to either a septal opening or the atrial appendage, or more than two membranes may be used to prevent ingress of material from other openings into the chamber. In another embodiment, the cage 300 does not include a membrane. Instead, the cage itself acts as a barrier to substantially prevent ingress of particles, fluids, or both into the left atrium.\n\nthe cage 300 is preferably expandable within the left atrium to provide sufficient force to hold the membranes 500A and 500B against the respective openings.\n\nthe cage 300 is self-expanding, such that in the configuration shown in Figure 2, the cage 300 is in a mostly, but not completely, expanded configuration, to hold the cage in place, hi other embodiments, the cage 300 may be manually expanded, such as by inflation of a balloon or other mechanism, with the cage 300 locking itself in the desired configuration within the heart.\n\nany of a variety of active expansion devices are used to expand the cage 300 within a patient.\n\ntelescoping tubes can be used to expand the cage 300.\n\nAn inner tube can be positioned in contact with the distal end of a cage 300 and an outer tube can be positioned in contact with the proximal end of the cage 300.\n\ndistal force can be applied to the proximal end of the cage 300, thereby causing the cage 300 to change its shape from reduced- diameter configuration to an expanded-diameter configuration.\n\nthe amount of cage 300 expansion can be controlled by any of a variety of mechanisms, such a lock placed on either or both of the telescoping tubes to fix its position when the tubes achieve a predetermined or desired separation.\n\na ratchet can be used to fix the separation between the telescoping tubes.\n\nTelescoping tubes and other embodiments of cage 300 expansion devices are described in U.S. Application No. 10/426,107, filed July 30, 2002, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\nOne of skill in the art will appreciate that although the expansion devices and structures described in the aforementioned application are configured for an implantable device for placement within a left atrial appendage, these teachings can readily be applied to a cage as described herein for placement within an atrium.\n\nthe cage 300 in one embodiment has a length between the proximal and distal ends of about 2 cm to about 10 cm, more preferably about 5 cm to about 7 cm, to correspond to the size of the left atrium 104.\n\nFIG. 3-3F An intracardiac cage 300 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figures 3-3F, without showing the membranes 500A and 500B.\n\nthe cage 300 has a proximal end 302, a distal end 304, and a longitudinal axis extending therebetween.\n\na plurality of supports 306 extend between a proximal hub 308 and a distal hub 310.\n\nthe cage 300 can include at least two or three supports 306, and in some embodiments, includes at least about ten supports 306. In one embodiment, sixteen supports 306 are provided.\n\nthe supports 306 are branched into branches 307 to provide mechanical coverage at the ends 302, 304 of the cage 300 and reduce the mechanical coverage in the non-barrier, central, or mid portion of the cage 300.\n\nthe branches 307 can be provided at proximal end 302, the distal end 304, or both ends 302, 304 of the cage 300.\n\nthe supports 306 include curves 309, such as serpentine curves or s-shaped curves, to provide an overall deployed length that can vary to fit a variety of atrium lengths yet collapse into a delivery catheter.\n\nthe curves 309 can be positioned at any one or a combination of the proximal end 302, distal end 304, or mid portion of the cage 300.\n\nthe tissue-contacting surface of the curves 309 is formed within the outer surface defined by the cage 300.\n\nthe curves 309 of the cage 300 provide length adjustability during cage 300 deployment.\n\nthe supports 306 can be deployed substantially in contact with the inner surface of the atrium to reduce blood flow disturbances. Blood flow disturbances can be a cause of thrombus formation and thrombus can embolize, potentially causing infarcts and/or strokes.\n\nthe precise number and configuration of supports 306 can be modified depending upon the desired physical properties of the cage 300, as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein without departing from the present invention.\n\nthe cage 300 can also include an occluding member (not shown) and any of a variety of stabilizing members, such as those described in U.S. Application No. 09/435,562, filed 11/8/1999, and U.S. Application No. 10/033,371, filed 10/19/2001, published as U.S. Publication No. 2002/0111647, which are incorporated by reference.\n\nthe supports 306 are generally sufficiently spaced apart from one another to allow blood to flow between them.\n\nthe proximal hub 308, distal hub 310, or both, and the associated supports 306 can be shaped as shown in Figure 3E, in which the hub 308, 310 is at least partially recessed.\n\nthe hub 308, 310 can be recessed relative to the surface defined by projecting the supports in a continuous curve 311, such as that shown as the dashed line in Figure 3E. This recessing either or both of the hubs 308, 310 may be employed with any of the embodiments shown herein.\n\nthe hub 308, 310 can be recessed so that when deployed, it does not cause irritation or tissue damage to the heart.\n\nEach support 306 can include a proximal spoke portion 312, a distal spoke portion 314, and an apex 316.\n\nEach of the proximal spoke portion 312, distal spoke portion 314 and apex 316 can be a region on an integral support 306, such as a continuous rib or frame member which extends in a generally curved configuration as illustrated, with a concavity facing towards the longitudinal axis of the cage 300.\n\na distinct point or hinge at apex 316 can or can not be provided.\n\nthe cage 300 may be reduced in diameter to a reduced or collapsed configuration for transluminal delivery to the heart, as will be described in greater detail below. Once delivered to the heart, the cage 300 diameter can be expanded to an expanded configuration for placement and securement at the desired location within the heart 100.\n\nthe cage 300 may be self-expanding, with supports made of a superelastic material such as nickel titanium alloy or nitinol. To collapse the cage 300, the supports 306 may be extended axially to a generally linear configuration, with the distance between the proximal and distal hubs 308, 310 increasing.\n\nthe cage 300 may be collapsed to its reduced configuration while maintaining the distance between the proximal and distal hubs 308, 310 substantially constant, such as by folding the supports 306 upon themselves or otherwise collapsing the supports 306 while holding the relative position of the proximal and distal ends 302, 304. Even more preferably, the supports 306 may not only collapse upon themselves, but the distance between the proximal and distal hubs 308, 310 may decrease when the cage 300 is moved to its collapsed configuration, such as by pulling the distal end 304 toward the proximal end 302, or pushing the proximal end 302 toward the distal end 304, or both.\n\nthe cage 300 expands not only radially outwardly, but also axially to increase the distance between the proximal and distal hubs308, 310.\n\nSuch an embodiment may facilitate placement of the cage 300 within a chamber of the heart 100, as described below.\n\neach support 306 can be provided with one or two or more anchors or barbs 318 to help secure or anchor the cage 300 at the desired location within the heart 100.\n\neach of the barbs 318 projects generally radially outwardly from the longitudinal axis, and is inclined in the proximal direction.\n\nOne or more barbs 318 may also be inclined distally, orthogonally, perpendicularly, inwardly, outwardly, and/or to the side, as may be desired by the particular clinical use. In a preferred embodiment enough barbs 318 are provided to prevent the cage from rotating relative to the atrial wall.\n\nAt least one barb 318 is directed in each of a proximal, distal, and transverse direction with respect to a support 306 to prevent the cage 300 from rotating relative to the atrial wall.\n\nthe cage 300 includes three barbs 318.\n\nthe cage 300 includes four barbs.\n\nthe barbs 318 and corresponding support 306 are cut from a single ribbon, sheet or tube stock and the barb 318 inclines radially outwardly at approximately a tangent to the curve formed by the support 306.\n\nthe cage 300 includes no barbs 318 at all.\n\nthe term âbarbâ is a broad te â n intended to have its ordinary meaning.\n\nthe term âbarbâ can include any of a variety of anchors, locks, adhesives, clips, clamps, coils, springs, and/or hooks known to those of skill in the art.\n\nthe barb can be any device that holds, secures, fixes, locks, and/or maintains the position of an implantable device, such as an intracardiac cage 300, either partially, substantially, or totally, within the heart.\n\nthe barbs are projections that do not come to a point, such as a catch and release hook. Barbs may have traumatic or atraumatic tips, or a combination thereof.\n\nthe barbs can engage, penetrate, pierce, pinch, press, and/or grasp the tissue at the inside wall of the heart.\n\nthe cage 300 can be deployed or recovered using a delivery system, as described in greater detail below. Cage 300 recovery can be facilitated by the anchor or barb design.\n\nthe anchors or barbs can pronate such that they do not 'catch' on a delivery catheter during cage recovery or implant delivery.\n\nbarbs move into the planes of the supports during withdrawal of the cage into a catheter, thereby preventing the barbs from contacting the distal end of the catheter and impeding withdrawal of the cage into the catheter.\n\nthe barbs move inward to the planes of the supports during withdrawal of the cage 300 into a catheter. Implantable devices including pronating anchors and barbs are disclosed in U.S. Application No. 10/838,710, filed May 4, 2004, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\nthe barbs allow tissue ingrowth, and in other embodiments they prevent tissue ingrowth.\n\nthe support 306 has a center portion that is fractureable, which permits the cage 300 to separate into two portions. Cage fracture may be desirable for hearts which become enlarged, or which contract in overall size, over time.\n\nthe barbs preferably promote tissue ingrowth, which allows permanent anchoring of each cage 300 portion within the heart.\n\nthe barbs 318 are located only at the proximal and distal ends 302, 304 of the cage 300, and not in the center portion 313.\n\na fracturable support 306 is illustrated in Figures 3F and 3 G.\n\nthe fracturable support 306 has two atraumatic loop ends 313 that are coupled to one another with a rivet 315.\n\nthe rivet 315 can be made from a bioresorbable material so that it dissolves over time.\n\nAnchoring of the cage 300 relative to the atrial wall may be desirable to prevent cardiac tissue irritation, erosion, or damage; to prevent irritation or disruption of conduction pathways in the heart tissue, to orient supports in relation to blood flow pathways such as the pulmonary vein or the mitral valve.\n\nthe cage 300 illustrated in Figure 3 may be constructed in any of a variety of ways, as will become apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.\n\nthe cage 300 is constructed by laser cutting a piece of tube stock to provide a plurality of axially extending slots in-between adjacent supports 306.\n\neach barb 318 can be laser cut from the corresponding support 306 or space in-between adjacent supports 306.\n\nGenerally axially extending slots 320 separate adjacent supports 306 and end a sufficient distance from each of the proximal end 302 and distal end 304 to create a proximal hub 308 and a distal hub 310 to which each of the supports 306 is attached, hi this manner, an integral cage 300 is fo â ned.\n\neach of the components of the cage 300 may be separately formed and attached together such as through soldering, brazing, heat bonding, adhesives, and other fastening techniques which are known in the art.\n\nAnother method of manufacturing the cage 300 is to laser cut a slot pattern on a flat sheet of appropriate material, such as a flexible metal or polymer. The flat sheet may thereafter be rolled about an axis and opposing edges bonded together to form a tubular structure.\n\nthe cage 300 is manufactured by braiding a structure, such as wire filament, into a cylindrical configuration and crimping the braided ends into radiopaque tubes. Such devices and methods are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,325,815, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\nthe apex portion 316 which can also carry a barb 318 may be advanced from a low profile, compressed, or reduced-diameter orientation (not shown) in which each of the supports 306 extend generally parallel to the longitudinal axis, to an implanted, expanded or enlarged-diameter orientation as illustrated, in which the apex 316 and its barb 318 are positioned radially outwardly from the longitudinal axis.\n\nthe support 306 may be biased towards the enlarged orientation, or may be advanced to the enlarged orientation under positive force following positioning within a desired tubular anatomical structure, in any of a variety of manners.\n\nFIG. 4 A cross-sectional view of another embodiment of an intracardiac cage 300 is shown in Figure 4.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably is available in a range of sizes to accommodate the anatomy of a patient's heart 100.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably includes a frame 402 and a membrane (not shown) on the proximal face or end 302 of the cage 300 and/or distal face or end 304 of the cage 300.\n\nthe frame 402 can be constructed of self-expanding nitinol supports 306.\n\nthe membrane preferably is constructed of a fabric covering, such as one made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), or an ePTFE/polyethylene (PE) laminate.\n\nePTFE expanded polytetrafluoroethylene\n\nPE ePTFE/polyethylene\n\na PE mesh preferably is placed against the supports 306, with one sheet of ePTFE preferably placed over the PE mesh and another sheet of ePTFE preferably placed on an opposite side of the supports 306.\n\nthe membrane preferably is heated on both sides causing the PE to melt into both sheets of ePTFE, thereby surrounding a portion of the frame 402.\n\nthe nitinol supports 306 allow the cage to self- expand in the desired portion of the heart 100, and can be expanded such that the membrane covers, blocks, filters, contacts, engages, or applies pressure to a desired anatomical surface, area, region, orifice, ostium, hole or defect.\n\nthe ePTFE/PE lamination is generally partially porous, and facilitates rapid endothelialization and healing.\n\nthe membrane can include implant grade filter or barrier materials such as polyester, polyurethane, polyethylene, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), polypropylene mesh, metal mesh, including Nitinol, stainless steel, and other metals, and other filter or barrier materials as are commonly known in the art.\n\nthe membrane can include an impervious film, and in some cases can have openings to enhance fluid flow therethrough.

blow-molded, or otherwise fabricated material.\n\nthe membrane can be attached to the supports 306 by heat-fusing, with or without an intermediate adhesive layer, by encircling supports and attaching the membrane to itself using any of a variety of techniques, such as heat fusing, solvent welding, ultrasonic welding, by using adhesives, by mechanical interlock, or by other means as are known in the art.\n\nthe membrane can be configured to provide a impervious barrier function to some or all of any substances desired, such as substances thought to be a significant causative factor in stroke

lungs.\n\nthe membrane can be configured to filter some or all of such substances.\n\nthe membrane can be configured to de-activate or remove from the bloodstream some or all of any substances thought to be a significant causative factor in stroke or migraine, including but not limited to those listed above.\n\nOne or more membranes may be applied to the supports 306, and each membrane applied may have different barrier, filter, or de-activation characteristics, and any single membrane may have regions with differing barrier, filter, or de-activation characteristics.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably

408 comprises an atraumatic tip, such that contact between the atraumatic tip and the inside surface of the heart 100 does not cause substantial damage or trauma to the heart 100.\n\nthe distal hub 304 may also be used to extend into the left atrial appendage to hold the cage in place.\n\na crosspin 404B secures the implant plug 408 to the distal end or hub 304.\n\nthe cage 100 preferably is expandable and collapsible, as described above, and can include anchors 318 that extend from the frame 402 when the cage 300 is expanded, as described above.\n\nFIGs 5-7 illustrate additional

previously discussed.\n\nthe barrier 500 may be provided on only one half or hemisphere, such as proximal face 302 as illustrated, on both faces (not shown), or may be carried by the entire cage 300 from its proximal end 302 to its distal end 304 provided the barrier has suitable flow properties for the chosen configuration.\n\nthe barrier 500 may be secured to the radially inwardly facing surface of the supports 306, as illustrated in Figure 6, or may be provided on the radially outwardly facing surfaces of the supports 306, or both.\n\nFIG. 7 Another embodiment of an intracardiac cage

For example, lengths in the area of from about 80 cm to about 100 cm are typical for use in percutaneous transluminal access at the femoral vein for locating and puncturing a site on the atrial septum in the heart.\n\nthe tubular body 916 may be manufactured in accordance with any of a variety of known techniques, for manufacturing catheters adapted to reach the coronary arteries or chambers of the heart.\n\nthe tubular body 916 may be manufactured as an extrusion of appropriate biocompatible polymeric materials such as high/low density polyethylene (HDPE/LDPE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), nylons, and a variety of others which are known in the art.\n\nBlended materials may also be used, such as HDPE (e.g., HDPE/LDPE ratios such as 50%:50%, 60%:40% and others) with from about 5% to about 25%, and, in one embodiment, about 20% BaSO 4 for lubricity and radiopacity.\n\ntubular body 916 may comprise a spring coil, solid walled hypodermic needle tubing (e.g., stainless steel, NiTi alloys) or braided reinforced wall as is understood in the catheter and guidewire arts.\n\nsolid walled hypodermic needle tubing e.g., stainless steel, NiTi alloys\n\nbraided reinforced wall as is understood in the catheter and guidewire arts.\n\nthe tubular body 916 is provided with an approximately circular cross sectional configuration having an outside diameter within- the range of from about 0.020\" to about 0.300\". In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the tubular body 916 has an outside diameter of about 0.160\" throughout its length. Other lengths and diameters may be readily utilized, depending upon the desired profile and performance characteristics.\n\nthe proximal end 912 is provided with a manifold 918, having one or more access ports as in known in the art.\n\nmanifold 918 is provided with a core wire port 920 which may also or alternatively function as a guidewire port in an over the wire embodiment.\n\nAn injection port 922 may also be provided, for injecting a contrast media, such as to confirm that the distal end 914 has traversed the intraatrial septum 216. Additional access ports may be provided as needed, depending upon the functional capabilities of the catheter.\n\nthe manifold 918 may be injection molded from any of a variety of medical grade plastics or formed in accordance with other techniques known in the art.\n\nthe flexible body 916 is provided with a preset bend 924, for assisting in biasing the distal end 914 against the intraatrial septum 216 as is understood in the art.\n\nthe bend 924 preferably has a radius within the range of from about 0.5 cm to about 5 cm and, in one embodiment, about 2.5 cm.\n\nthe bend 924 is centered on a point which is within the range of from about 1 cm to about .10 cm proximally from distal end 914. In one embodiment, the bend 924 is centered at approximately 6 cm proximally from distal end 914.\n\nthe bend 924 can be defined by a proximal transition where it meets the substantially linear proximal portion of the dilator 910, and a distal transition where it meets the substantially linear distal portion of the dilator 910.\n\nthe angular deflection of the bend 924 is generally within the range of from about 30Â° to about 80Â° and, in one embodiment, is about 50Â°.\n\nthe bend 924 may be provided in accordance with any of a variety of techniques.\n\nthe tubular body 916 when the tubular body 916 includes a hypotube or other metal tubing, it may be bent such as around a forming mandrel in excess of the elastic limit of the hypotube.\n\nan injection molded catheter body may be heat set in a predetermined bend, such as with removable flexible mandrels extending through any interior lumen to maintain patency of the lumen around the bend 924.\n\nOther techniques will be known to those of skill in the art.\n\nthe bend 924 may be formed during or after placement of the catheter in the heart.\n\nthe dilator 910 may be accomplished by providing the dilator 910 with any of a variety of steering mechanisms, which allow a distal portion 914 of the dilator 910 to be inclined away from the axis of the normal bias of the dilator 910.\n\none or more axially moveable pull wires may extend throughout the length of the dilator 910. Proximal traction on a pull wire that is secured at the distal end 914 of the dilator 910 will cause a lateral defection of the dilator 910.\n\nthe dilator 910 is additionally provided with a tissue piercing structure 926 such as a needle 928.\n\nthe needle 928 preferably includes a tubular structure such as a stainless steel hypotube having a sharpened distal end 930.\n\nthe sharpened distal end 930 of the needle 928 is axially moveable and advanceable through an aperture 932 in the distal end 914 of the tubular body 916.\n\nthe needle 928 has an axial length of from about 1 cm to about 5 cm, an inside diameter of about 0.022 inches and an outside diameter of about 0.032 inches. Any of a variety of other dimensions for needle 928 may also be used depending upon the desired performance and overall catheter dimensions.\n\nthe needle 928 is coupled to a control element such as core wire 934 which axially moveably extends throughout the length of tubular body 916.\n\nthe proximal end of the core wire 934 in the illustrated embodiment extends proximally from the core wire port 920.\n\nthe needle 928 is preferably axially moveable between a first position in which the tip 930 is contained within the distal end 914 of the tubular body 916 and a distal position in which the tip 930 of the needle 928 is exposed beyond the distal end of the tubular body 916, such as for piercing the fossa ovalis. Distal advancement of the proximal end of the core wire 934 will advance the needle 928 from the first position to the second position as will be appreciated in view of the disclosure herein.\n\nthe needle 928 and core wire 934 may be removed entirely from the dilator 910, except when desired to pierce the septum.\n\nOther mechanisms known to those of skill in the art, such as spring-loaded needles with trigger releases, may be used to move the needle 928 from the first position to the second position.\n\nthe piercing structure 926 may be proximally retracted and removed from the dilator 910, thereby leaving the central lumen of the dilator 910 fully available for subsequent therapeutic or diagnostic devices or materials.\n\nthe distal end 914 of the dilator 910 is provided with a tapered frustro conical surface 936.\n\nThis allows the tubular body 916 to function as a dilator, thereby permitting the tapered surface 936 to enlarge the opening fonned by needle 928 while minimizing \"tenting\" of the fossa ovalis during a transseptal access procedure.\n\nthe right atrium 114 may be initially accessed with a transseptal access system through either the inferior or superior vena cava 204, 202, which initially involves cannulation with an introducer sheath such as through the well known \"Seldinger\" technique.\n\na transseptal access system of the present invention includes a transseptal sheath 900, a piercing dilator catheter 910 as discussed above, and an appropriately sized guidewire 940.\n\nOne access point is along the right femoral vein, although access from the left femoral vein is also possible. Access may also be achieved through a puncture in any of a variety of other veins of suitable internal diameter and the present invention is not limited in this regard.\n\na conventional spring tipped guidewire 940 is thereafter advanced through the needle into the vein and the needle is subsequently removed.\n\nthe dilator 910 is positioned within a sheath such as a 14 French introducer sheath. Subsequently, the sheath and inner dilator 910, in combination with the guidewire 940, are advanced through the femoral vein to the right atrium 114.\n\nFigure 15A illustrates a schematic partial cross-section of a portion of the heart 100.\n\nthe right atrium 114 is in communication with the inferior vena cava 204 and the superior vena cava 202.\n\nthe right atrium 114 is separated from the left atrium 104 by the interatrial septum 216.\n\nthe fossa ovalis 942 is located on the interatrial septum 216.\n\nthe sheath 900 having the dilator 910 and guidewire 940 therein are initially positioned within the right atrium 114.\n\nthe guidewire 940 is then distally advanced to access the superior vena cava 202, as shown in Figure 15B.\n\nthe dilator 910 and sheath 900 are advanced into the superior vena cava 202, as illustrated schematically in Figure 15C.\n\nthe guidewire 940 is proximally retracted.\n\nthe transseptal needle 928 is advanced through the central lumen of the dilator 910 and sheath 900.\n\nthe transseptal needle 928 is advanced (possibly with a stylet in place) to a point that the stylet tip is just inside the distal tip of the sheath 900 and dilator 910, a position previously noted by the operator, and the stylet is withdrawn from the transseptal needle 928.\n\nthe tip of the dilator 910 is then positioned against the septum 216 by distal advancement through the sheath 900.\n\nthe tip is then dragged along the septum 216 by proximal traction on the dilator 910 until the tip pops onto the fossa ovalis 942.\n\nVarious methods and devices known to those of skill in the art may be utilized to help identify the location of the fossa ovalis. 942.\n\nOne such method and device is described in U.S. Application No. 10/100,270, filed ,March 15, 2002, published as U.S. Publication No. 2002/0169377, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\nthe physician is normally assisted during placement, as in the entire procedure, by fluoroscopy or other visualization techniques.\n\nthe distal tip of sheath 900 and the distal tip of dilator 910 may be provided with a radiopaque marker, hi addition, some physicians find it desirable to infuse a radiopaque dye through the transseptal needle 928 at various stages of the procedure to assist in visualization, particularly following the transseptal puncture.\n\nthe transseptal needle 928 is abruptly advanced to accomplish a quick puncture, as illustrated in Figure 15E.\n\none medical technique is to confirm the presence of the tip 930 of the transseptal needle 928 within the left atrium 104. Confirmation of the location of the tip 930 of the transseptal needle 928 may be accomplished by monitoring the pressure sensed through the transseptal needle lumen to ensure that the measured pressure is within the expected range and has a waveform configuration typical of left atrial pressure.\n\nproper position within the left atrium 104 may be confirmed by analysis of oxygen saturation level of the blood drawn through the transseptal needle 928; e.g., aspirating fully oxygenated blood.\n\nvisualization through fluoroscopy alone, or in combination with the use of dye, may also serve to confirm the presence of the tip 930 of the transseptal needle 928 in the left atrium 104.\n\na sheath 900 that includes a dilator 910 (not shown) is positioned adjacent the patent foramen ovale 944.\n\nthe patent foramen ovale 944 generally includes a septum secundum 946 and a septum primum 948. Additional devices and methods for piercing the septum primum and secundum are shown in U.S. Application No. 10/972,635, filed October 25, 2004, published as U.S. Publication No. 2005/0119675, which is incoiporated by reference in its entirety.\n\nthe transseptal sheath 900 and dilator 910 are positioned adjacent to the patent foramen ovale 944 and its tissue piercing structure 926 is advanced distally through the septum secundum 946 and septum primum 948 by actuating an actuator, such as a control on the dilator 910 manifold 918.\n\nan actuator such as a control on the dilator 910 manifold 918.\n\nthe tissue piercing structure 926 may be advanced across the septa manually.\n\ntissue piercing structure 926 may be advanced across the septa using a spring loaded handle. Crossing the septa quickly using a spring loaded handle may facilitate crossing of the septum primum 948.\n\nthe tip 936 of the dilator 910 is advanced through the septum 216 and into the left atrium 104, as shown in Figure 15H. Typically, care is taken to ensure that, at the same time of advancing the dilator 910 and sheath 900 into the left atrium 104, the tip 930 of the transseptal needle 928 is not advanced a sufficient distance such that the needle 928 can damage the inside wall of the left atrium 104.\n\nthe transseptal needle 928 is withdrawn.\n\nthe sheath 900 is then advanced into the left atrium 104, either by advancing the sheath 900 alone over the dilator 910 or by advancing the sheath 900 and dilator 910 in combination, as shown in Figure 151.\n\nthe dilator 910 is then withdrawn from sheath 900, as shown in Figure 15 J.\n\nthe main lumen of the sheath 900 is now available as a clear pathway to advancing further diagnostic or therapeutic instruments into the left atrium, such as the delivery system 800 described in greater detail above with respect to Figures 8-12.\n\nthe size and morphology of the left atrium 104 can be determined by injecting contrast media through the sheath 900 and into the left atrium 104.\n\nthe system and method preferably allows for selection and preparation of a deployment system 800.\n\nthe delivery system 800 preferably comprises an intracardiac cage 300 of an appropriate size for placement in a patient. Initially, the cage 300 preferably is in an expanded configuration, with its axially moveable core 808 engaging a slider assembly 406, as described above.\n\na recapture sheath 804 preferably is positioned so it covers and supports the flexible segment 850 of the delivery system 800, wherein the flexible catheter section 828 of deployment catheter 806 and flexible core section 836 of axially moveable core 808 are aligned.\n\nthe Touhy-Borst valve 864 preferably is tightened over the deployment catheter 806 to prevent relative movement between recapture sheath 804 and deployment catheter 806.\n\nthe loading collar 882 and peel-away sheath 802 preferably are positioned so they are at the base of the recapture flares 860, proximal thereto.\n\nthe delivery system 800 preferably is loaded by rotating the control knob 814 counterclockwise until the cage 300 is fully collapsed.\n\nat least a portion of the control line 888 is coupled with the control knob 814 such that rotation of the control knob 814 in the counterclockwise direction retracts at least a portion of the control line 888.\n\nRetraction of the control line 888 preferably places tension on the proximal hub 308 of the cage 300 because a portion of the control line 888 preferably is coupled with the proximal hub 308 by a pin 404.\n\ntension in the control line 888 preferably causes the proximal hub 308 of the cage 300 to move proximally relative the axially moveable core 808, thereby collapsing the intracardiac cage 300.\n\nthe diameter of the cage 300 preferably is reduced to approximately l/3 rd or less of its original diameter when collapsed.\n\nthe loading collar 882 and peel-away sheath 802 are then advanced distally over the flares 860 and cage 300 until the distal tip of the cage 300 is aligned with the distal end of the peel-away sheath 802 and the distal end of the loading collar 882 is about 1.5 cm from the distal tip of the cage 300.\n\nthe flares 860 partially cover the cage 300.\n\nthe loading collar 882 preferably is removed and discarded.\n\nthe entire system preferably is flushed with sterile heparinized saline after attaching stopcocks to the recapture sheath injection port 870, the proximal injection port 818 and distal injection port 820 of the delivery system 800.\n\nthe recapture sheath 804 and the Touhy-Borst valve 864 are first thoroughly flushed through port 870.\n\nthe distal injection port 818 and the proximal injection port 820 of the deployment handle 810 are preferably flushed as well.\n\nthe distal injection port 820 is in fluid communication with lumen 854 of the axially moveable core 808, and the proximal injection port 818 is in fluid communication with injection lumens 826 of the multi-lumen shaft 812.\n\nthe transseptal sheath 900 placement preferably is reconfirmed using fluoroscopy and contrast media injection.\n\nthe delivery system 800 as described above, with the cage 300 coupled thereto, preferably is then inserted into the proximal end of the transseptal sheath 900.\n\na continual, slow flush of sterile heparinized saline preferably is applied through the proximal injection port 818 of the deployment handle 810 to the distal end of the deployment catheter 806 until the tip of the peel-away sheath 802 has been inserted into, and stops in, the hemostatic valve 904 of the transseptal sheath 900.\n\nthe distal tip of the peel-away sheath 802 is inserted approximately 5 mm relative to the proximal end of the transseptal sheath 900.\n\nthe recapture sheath 804 and deployment catheter 806 preferably are advanced, relative to the peel-away sheath 802, approximately 20-30 cm from the proximal end of the transseptal sheath 900, and the system 800 preferably is evaluated for trapped air.\n\nthe peel-away sheath 802 is preferably not advanced into the transseptal sheath 900 due to the hemostasis valve 904 blocking its passage. If air is present in the system 800, it may be removed by aspirating through the distal injection port 820, recapture sheath injection port 870, or proximal injection port 818.\n\nthe deployment catheter 806 and recapture sheath 804 preferably are moved proximally and the delivery system 800 preferably is removed from the transseptal sheath 900. All air preferably is aspirated and the flushing/introduction procedure preferably is repeated.\n\nthe peel-away sheath 802 preferably is manually slid proximally to the proximal end 866 of the recapture sheath 804.\n\nthe Touhy-Borst valve 864 preferably is loosened and the deployment catheter 806 preferably is advanced distally relative to the recapture sheath 804 until the deployment handle 810 is within about 2 cm of the Touhy- Borst valve 864 of the recapture sheath 804. This causes the cage 300 to be advanced distally within the transseptal sheath 900 such that the recapture sheath 804 no longer covers the cage 300 or the flexible section 850.\n\nthe Touhy-Borst valve 864 preferably is tightened to secure the deployment catheter 806 to fix relative movement between the deployment catheter 806 and recapture sheath 804.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably is advanced to the tip of the transseptal sheath 900 by distal movement of the deployment catheter 806.\n\nthe distal hub 310 of the cage 300 preferably is aligned with a transseptal sheath 900 tip radiopaque marker 950, as illustrated in Figure 13 A.\n\nthe sheath 900 position within the left atrium 104 preferably is confirmed with a distal contrast media injection.\n\nthe distal end of the transseptal sheath 900 is positioned at, near, or inside of the ostium of the left atrial appendage 106, as illustrated in Figure 15K.\n\nthe position of the cage 300 preferably is maintained by initially holding the deployment handle 810 stable.\n\nthe transseptal sheath 900 preferably is withdrawn proximally until its tip radiopaque marker 950 is within about 1-2 mm of the septum 216 but still within the left atrium 104. This preferably exposes at least a portion of the cage 300, as shown in Figure 15L.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably is expanded at least in part by rotating the control knob 814 clockwise. Rotating the control knob 814 preferably releases tension on the control line 888, preferably allowing the cage 300 to expand, as illustrated in Figure 15M.\n\nthe sheath 900 is advanced until the cage 300 abuts the vicinity of the left atrial appendage 106. The cage 300 is then deployed a little more. Sheath 900 advancement and cage 300 deployment and expansion is repeated until the cage 300 is fully deployed out of the sheath 900.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably is self-expanding.\n\nany tension on the left atrial appendage 106 or left atrium 104 preferably is removed by carefully retracting the deployment handle 810 under fluoroscopy until the radiopaque marker 858 on the axially movable core 808 moves proximally approximately 1-2 mm in the guide tube of the slider assembly 406.\n\nthe position of the cage 300 relative the left atrial appendage 106 and left atrium 104 preferably is not altered because the axially movable core 808 preferably is coupled with the slider assembly 406, which allows for relative movement between the cage 300 and the axially movable core 808.\n\nthe slider assembly 406 preferably allows for the distal portion of the axially movable core 808 to be slightly retracted proximally from the distal hub 310 of the cage 300, thereby removing any axial tension that may be acting on the cage 300 through the axially movable core 808.\n\nthe radiopaque marker 858 preferably is about 1-2 mm proximal from the cage 300 distal hub 310, and the transseptal sheath 900 tip preferably is about 2-3 mm proximal from the implant proximal hub 308, thereby indicating a neutral position.\n\nthe cage 300 is positioned within the left atrium 104 such that the barrier 500B covering its distal end 304 is aligned with the ostium of the left atrial appendage 106. In another embodiment, the cage 300 is positioned within the left atrium 104 such that the barrier 500A covering its proximal end 302 is aligned with a portion of the septum 216, such as a patent foramen ovale 944.\n\nthe cage 300 is positioned within the left atrium 104 such that the barrier 500B covering its distal end 304 is aligned with the ostium of the left atrial appendage 106 and the barrier 500A covering its proximal end 302 is aligned with a portion of the septum 216, such as a patent foramen ovale 944.\n\nthe expanded diameter of the cage 300 preferably is measured in at least two views to assess the position of the implant within the left atrium 104.\n\nthe measured implant diameter preferably is compared to the maximum expanded diameter.\n\nthe proximal and distal injection ports 818, 820 of the deployment handle 810 correlate with the proximal and distal contrast media injections.\n\nthe proximal contrast media injections are delivered through the delivery catheter lumen 826 to a location proximal to the cage 300.\n\nthe distal contrast media injections are delivered through the axially movable core 808 to a location distal to the cage 300.\n\nProximal contrast media injections preferably are completed in two views. If the injection rate is insufficient, the recapture sheath injection port 870 may be used independently or in conjunction with the proximal injection port 818 to deliver fluid to a location proximal to the cage 300.\n\nany transverse tension on the left atrial appendage 106 or left atrium 104 preferably is released by exposing the flexible segment 850 of the delivery system 800.\n\nthe flexible catheter section 828 and the flexible core section 836 preferably are linearly co-located to cooperate as the flexible catheter section 828 of the delivery system 800, as described above. This preferably is accomplished by retracting the transseptal sheath 900 proximally approximately 2 cm to expose the flexible section 828.\n\nthe flexible section 828 preferably will flex to allow the cage 300 to sit within the left atrium 104 free from transverse forces that may be created, for example, by contractions of the heart acting against the transseptal sheath 900 or deployment catheter 806.\n\ndistal contrast media injections preferably are completed in at least two views to verify proper positioning of the cage 300.\n\na flush of saline preferably is used as needed between injections to clear the contrast media from the left atrial appendage 106.\n\nthe transseptal sheath 900 preferably is advanced distally to cover the flexible section 828.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably may be collapsed and repositioned in the left atrium 104.\n\nthe deployment handle 810 preferably is advanced distally to place the radiopaque marker 858 of the axially moveable core 808 at the distal hub 310 of the cage 300.\n\nthe distal end of the transseptal sheath 900 preferably is aligned with the distal end of the flexible segment 850.\n\nthe control knob 814 preferably is rotated until the cage 300 has been collapsed to approximately l/3 rd or less of its expanded diameter.\n\nthe tip of the transseptal sheath 900 can be withdrawn into the right atrium 114 during recapture to prevent excessive lengthening of the cage 300 within the left atrium 104 and potential tissue trauma.\n\nthe control knob 814 preferably acts on the control line 888 to place tension on the proximal hub 308 of the cage 300, pulling the proximal hub 308 of the cage 300 proximally relative the distal hub 310 of the cage 300 to collapse the cage 300.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably can be repositioned and re- expanded.\n\nthe stability of the cage 300 preferably is verified in several views. Stability tests preferably are preformed in the following manner.\n\na contrast media filled syringe preferably is connected to the distal injection port 820 of the deployment handle 810. Under fluoroscopy, at least about a 10 mm gap between the tip of the transseptal sheath 900 and the proximal hub 308 of the cage 300 is preferably confirmed.\n\nthe stability of the cage 300 in the left atrium 104 preferably is evaluated using fluoroscopy and echocardiography.\n\nthe recapture sheath Touhy-Borst valve 864 preferably is loosened.\n\nthe deployment handle 810 preferably is alternately retracted and advanced about 5-10 mm while maintaining the position of the transseptal sheath 900 and simultaneously injecting contrast media through the distal injection port 820. This tests how well the implant is held within the left atrium 104.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably may be collapsed and repositioned as described above. If repositioning the cage 300 does not achieve an acceptable result, the cage 300 preferably may be collapsed and recaptured as described further below.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably meets the following acceptance criteria, associated with the assessment techniques listed below, prior to being released.\n\nthe assessment techniques to be evaluated preferably include 1) residual compression; 2) implant location; 3) anchor engagement; 4) seal quality; and 5) stability.\n\nthe implant diameter as measured by fluoroscopic imaging, preferably is less than the maximum expanded diameter of the cage 300.\n\nthe proximal sealing surface of the cage 300 preferably is positioned between the left atrial appendage 106 ostium and sources of thrombus formation (pectinates, secondary lobes, etc.) (preferably imaged in at least two views).\n\nthe cage 300 frame 402 preferably is positioned within the left atrium 104 so as to engage a row of anchors or barbs 318 in a left atrial 104 wall (preferably imaged in at least two views).\n\nthe contrast injections preferably show leakage rated no worse than mild (preferably defined as a flow of contrast media, well defined, and filling one-third of the left atrial appendage 106 during a proximal injection over a period of up to about five ventricular beats, preferably imaged in at least two views).\n\ncage 300 recapture is desired or necessary (e.g., because a different size cage 300 is necessary or desired), or if acceptable positioning or sealing cannot be achieved, the cage 300 preferably is fully collapsed as described above.\n\nthe locking collar 872 of the peel away sheath 802 preferably is unlocked.\n\nthe peel-away portion 874 of the peel-away sheath 802 preferably is split up to the reinforced section 876 and removed.\n\nthe reinforced section 876 of the peel-away sheath 802 preferably is slid proximally to the hub of the recapture sheath 804.\n\nthe Touhy-Borst valve 864 on the proximal end of the recapture sheath 804 preferably is slightly loosened to allow smooth movement of the recapture sheath 804 over deployment catheter 806 without allowing air to enter past the Touhy-Borst valve 864 seal.\n\nthe recapture sheath 804 can now be advanced further distally relative to the transseptal sheath 900.\n\nthe recapture sheath 804 While holding the deployment catheter 806 and transseptal sheath 900 in place, the recapture sheath 804 preferably is advanced distally into the transseptal sheath 900 until a half marker band 868 on the recapture sheath 804 is aligned with a full marker band 950 on the transseptal sheath 900. This preferably exposes the recapture flares 860 outside the transseptal sheath 900.\n\nthe collapsed cage 300 preferably is retracted into the recapture sheath 804 by simultaneously pulling the deployment handle 810 and maintaining the position of the recapture sheath 804 until approximately half the cage 300 is seated in the recapture sheath 804.\n\nthe Touhy-Borst valve 864 on the recapture sheath 804 preferably is tightened over the deployment catheter 806.\n\nthe recapture sheath 804 and cage 300 preferably are retracted into the transseptal sheath 900 by pulling on the recapture sheath 804 while maintaining the position of the transseptal sheath 900, preferably maintaining left atrial access.\n\nthe recapture flares 860 of the recapture sheath 804 preferably cover at least some of the anchor or barbs 318 on the cage 300 as the cage 300 is retracted proximally into the transseptal sheath 900.\n\nthe cage 300 preferably is released from the delivery system 800.\n\nthe transseptal sheath 900 preferably is advanced to the proximal hub 308 of the cage 300 for support.\n\nthe release knob 816 on the proximal end of the deployment handle 810 preferably is rotated to release the cage 300. Rotating the release knob 816 preferably causes a mating surface 856, such as a threaded portion, of the distal shaft 834 of the axially movable core 808 to rotate with respect to the slider assembly 406 such that the mating surface 856 preferably is decoupled from the slider assembly 406.\n\nthe release knob 816 preferably is retracted until the distal shaft 834 of the axially movable core 808 is at least about 2 cm within the transseptal sheath 900.\n\nthe delivery system 800 preferably is retracted and removed through the transseptal sheath 900.\n\nthe transseptal sheath 900 position preferably is verified to be approximately 1 cm away from the face of the cage 300. Contrast injections, fluoroscopy and/or echocardiography preferably may be used to confirm proper positioning and delivery of the cage 300 and position with respect to the left atrial appendage 106 and septum 216.\n\nthe transseptal sheath 900 preferably is withdrawn, as illustrated in Figure 15N.\n\nthe barrier 500A on the proximal face 502 of the cage 300 generally includes an ePTFE lamination or other structure that promotes neointimal growth and endothelialization. As ingrowth and endothelialization occur, a naturally formed barrier to seal, close, or patch a defect in the septum 216 is achieved.\n\nthe cage 300 provides a frame or scaffolding to hold the barrier 500B in place against the septum 216 and across and/or inside of the left atrial appendage 106, as described in greater detail above.\n\nintracardiac cage 300 One advantage of the intracardiac cage 300 is that gross stretching or distension of the patent foramen ovale 944 opening do not occur, either for sizing, or because of oblique attachment.\n\nthe intracardiac cage 300 has been primarily described with respect to implantation within the left atrium 104, it should be understood by those of skill in the art that the same or equivalent structures can be used within the right atrium of the heart to provide a barrier 500 against the septum secundum 946 and/or the ostium of the right atrial appendage 116. In addition, the same or similar structures may be used to provide a barrier 500 against any septal defect, whether in the interatrial septum or the interventricular septum.\n\nthe present invention may be used to provide a barrier to seal off, block, or filter an atrial septal defect (ASD), a ventricular septal defect (VSD), a patent foramen ovale (PFO), or a patent ductus arteriosis (PDA).\n\nASD atrial septal defect\n\nVSD ventricular septal defect\n\nPFO patent foramen ovale\n\nPDA patent ductus arteriosis\n\ncage has been used, those of skill in the art should understand that the terms implant and occlusion device may be used as well to describe identical or equivalent structures.\n\nimplant and occlusion device may be used as well to describe identical or equivalent structures.\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that all of the disclosures herein are applicable to a wide variety of structures that include both cages and implants that may or may not also be occlusion devices. Routine experimentation will demonstrate those limited circumstances under which certain disclosures and combinations thereof are not beneficial.\n\nLandscapes\n\nHealth & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nLife Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nSurgery (AREA)\n\nHeart & Thoracic Surgery (AREA)\n\nPublic Health (AREA)\n\nVeterinary Medicine (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nBiomedical Technology (AREA)\n\nGeneral Health & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nAnimal Behavior & Ethology (AREA)\n\nMolecular Biology (AREA)\n\nMedical Informatics (AREA)\n\nNuclear Medicine, Radiotherapy & Molecular Imaging (AREA)\n\nCardiology (AREA)\n\nVascular Medicine (AREA)\n\nReproductive Health (AREA)\n\nOral & Maxillofacial Surgery (AREA)\n\nTransplantation (AREA)\n\nSurgical Instruments (AREA)\n\nPCT/US2006/036054 2005-09-16 2006-09-15 Intracardiac cage and method of delivering same WO2007035497A1 (en)\n\nPriority Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title EP06814751.1A EP1945112B1 (en) 2005-09-16 2006-09-15 Intracardiac cage\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (2)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US11/229,313 2005-09-16 US11/229,313 US7972359B2 (en) 2005-09-16 2005-09-16 Intracardiac cage and method of delivering same\n\nPublications (1)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date WO2007035497A1 true WO2007035497A1 (en) 2007-03-29\n\nFamily\n\nID=37402724\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date PCT/US2006/036054 WO2007035497A1 (en) 2005-09-16 2006-09-15 Intracardiac cage and method of delivering same\n\nCountry Status (3)\n\nCountry Link US (4) US7972359B2 (ko) EP (1) EP1945112B1 (ko) WO (1) WO2007035497A1 (ko)\n\nCited By (10)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title WO2012163257A1 (zh) * 2011-06-01 2012-12-06 å å¥ç§æ(æ·±å³)æéå ¬å¸ å·¦å¿è³å°å µå¨ WO2013158354A1 (en) * 2012-04-17 2013-10-24 Indian Wells Medical, Inc.
