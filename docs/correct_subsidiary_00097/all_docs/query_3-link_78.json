SOFTWARE CONSULTANT (Projects): Role Software Developer / Consultant April 1999–Nov 2007 Clients Various Major Corporations Wireless USB (WUSB) Developer – Three stacked Wireless Host Drivers released. 2) Radio Control Driver (RCI) 3) Host Wire Adapter Driver (HWA) 4) Device Wire Adapter Driver (DWA) Implemented Selective Suspend to work with WUSB protocol. Developed template drivers for next generation PCIe drivers. USB DWG Committee Chair – USB/IrDA Bridge Specification released. Led a team of independent participants representing numerous companies for the purpose of releasing an open specification describing a methodology and protocol for porting IrDA 1.0 communications over USB. This specification has been cited for being an example of how to port external communications across USB. USB Developer Work Group (DWG) Committees Participated in USB DWG Committees for the purpose of developing open USB specifications including, but not limited to, USB/IrDA Bridge, Device Firmware Upgrade, Human Interface Device (HID), Content Security, Mass Storage, Control IR, and Audio. MFC GUI, WDM Driver, and DLL Developed MFC GUI to interface with WDM kernel drivers. MFC based, Object Oriented Visual C++ GUI accessed XML files to store mapping definitions, macro definitions, and specific application access methods. DLL’s were also written to handle notifications of current application changes and GUI callback functionality. Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 was used to develop the WDM drivers, GUI, and DLL’s. Automated Outlook Screening Application Developed C++ COM application to screen incoming emails and referenced web pages. The application interfaces with Microsoft Outlook via COM, downloads the referenced web pages on the incoming email, screens the referenced web pages for key words, and assigns point values for each web page based upon the key words. Web pages having high point values would result in a response form being automatically constructed using XML. The keywords and associated point values are stored in a database. All email reply details are also stored in the database ensuring that only one response is made. Windows WDM Host Drivers. Developed numerous Windows WDM Drivers for USB devices using Microsoft Visual C++ and the Windows DDK. Windows GUI Applications. Developed numerous Windows GUI Applications. GUI test applications were used for the initial proof of device communications, testing USB protocol conformance, and on to final stress testing of the system and product. Host Driver Test Applications developed using both Borland Builder C++ and Microsoft Visual C++. Page 3 of 6 December 28, 2015\n\n4.

USB HID managed Headset (Audio Streams, HID, Device Firmware Upgrade, etc.) Managed all USB software aspects of producing an advanced Audio Headset having various controls remotely located at the headset. Developed the headset to be totally controlled using HID methodology replacing the less standard and less reliable implementations of Audio Stream controls. Incorporated an improved HID Parser in the USB Host Driver bypassing the less than standard OS supplied HID Parser. Developed software to upgrade the firmware in the Audio Headset via USB as new versions were developed. Developed a method for remembering the last headset settings between uses. This USB Headset used 7 USB interfaces. DLL written to provide customizable “skins” for the GUI. MFC based GUI written to interface with the WDM kernel driver. HID based Control Panel Developed all the required Host side WDM Drivers and test applications for a Control Panel having a vast array of knobs, buttons, leds, sliders, etc. All controls were managed using advanced HID methodology. Included an advanced HID Parser within the USB Host drivers based upon an earlier version that was developed for Apple. Developed numerous multi-threaded test applications covering all product development stages to ensure that every control was functioning properly and that simultaneous uses of different controls would all be handled properly. Developed Device Firmware Upgrade functionality so that new versions of firmware could be downloaded into the Control Panel.
