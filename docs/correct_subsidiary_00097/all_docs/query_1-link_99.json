        "text": "Antoine Papiernik is Chairman and Managing Partner at Sofinnova Partners, which he joined in 1997.\n\n“Life Sciences investing is not just about recognizing good science,” Papiernik says, “it’s about people — learning how to interact with co-investors, limited partners, and entrepreneurs. Listening, discerning, negotiating, and finding common interests.”\n\nWhen you find the right people to invest in, he adds, “you can bank on them more often than you can predict how the science is going to turn out.” He looks for entrepreneurs with the nimbleness to adapt, “even if that means a making a major shift from where one starts out on the journey.”\n\nAntoine actively invests for our Capital Funds. He has been an initial investor and active board member in a number of public companies, including Actelion, ProQR, Shockwave Medical, NovusPharma (sold to CTI), Movetis (sold to Shire), and Pixium Vision. Trade sale success stories include CoreValve (sold to Medtronic), Fovea (sold to Sanofi Aventis), Ethical Oncology Science (EOS, sold to Clovis Oncology) and Recor Medical (sold to Otsuka).\n\nHe has also invested in and is a board member of private companies Reflexion Medical, Tissium, Pi-Cardia, SafeHeal, Noema Therapeutics, Ablacare, Highlife and Inspirna (formerly Rgenix).\n\nAntoine has an MBA from the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania. He has been selected twice for the Forbes Midas List, an annual ranking recognizing the world’s top venture capital investors. Antoine is one of the few European and life science investors to have appeared on the prestigious list.\n\nAt the Emerging Medtech Summit Dr. Villafaña will share the story of Medical 21 (his latest venture) and discuss fundraising goals and strategic partner interests.\n\nCo-inventor of the first lithium powered pacemaker and founder of Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc./Guidant.

DeBakey in Houston where he had the opportunity to be involved in some of the first scientific work that was being done with continuous flow left ventricular assist devices. After completing his training David went back to Minnesota where he worked briefly in the Twin Cities before joining his father in practice at the Mayo Clinic. He was recruited to the Medical College of Wisconsin in 2017 as the Surgical Director of Heart and Lung Transplantation, where he has been involved in research and implementation of a wide range of medical device technologies. He is a member of the editorial board for the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, co-edited the textbook “Mechanical Circulatory Support: Principles and Applications,” and has published over 100 peer reviewed scientific papers.

They have two children, Lyle and Lucia, ages 8 and 6.\n\nDavid will attend the Emerging Medtech Summit to represent Alira Health's extensive advisory services and to network and meet with other industry insiders.\n\nDavid joined Alira Health with over 25 years of management experience in the medical device, products and clinical diagnostics field.
