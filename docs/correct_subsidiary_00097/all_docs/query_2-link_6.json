        "text": "BOSTON, Aug. 12 /PRNewswire/ -- Follica Inc., a privately held developer of novel therapies for androgenetic alopecia and other hair follicle disorders, today announced an $11 million Series B financing round. Polaris Venture Partners led the financing and existing investors InterWest Partners and PureTech Ventures participated.\n\nAndrogenetic alopecia is male and female pattern hair loss in genetically susceptible men and women.\n\nThe company also announced several new additions to its team. Two new members joined the Follica board, including Mr. G. Kirk Raab, former CEO Genentech, COO Abbott, and chairman, Connetics. Mr. Raab will serve as Follica’s chairman. The other new board member is Dr. Kevin Bitterman, principal at Polaris Venture Partners. Raab and Bitterman will join existing board members Daphne Zohar, Follica CEO and PureTech Ventures managing partner, and Mr. Chris Ehrlich, general partner, InterWest Partners.\n\n“Polaris is thrilled to join PureTech and InterWest in helping to build Follica,” said Bitterman. “The cutting-edge biology on which the company was founded allows Follica to address hair loss and multiple other conditions with an entirely novel mechanism of action. The combination of world-class founders George Cotsarelis, Rox Anderson and Vera Price, and the enormous unmet need in the aesthetic dermatology space make this a tremendously exciting company.”\n\nIn addition, Dr. Samir Mitragotri of the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), a leading expert in transdermal drug delivery, will join Follica’s Scientific Advisory Board. The company also welcomed Mr. Scott Kellogg (formerly of Sontra Medical, Ultracision, and Ethicon Endosurgery) as vice president of operations and promoted Dr. Stephen Prouty (formerly of Johnson & Johnson’s skin biology group) to vice president of research.\n\nFollica was co-founded by PureTech Ventures and a group of academic dermatologists from Harvard, UCSF and the University of Pennsylvania to address the critical issue of alopecia. The company recently announced a Series A round of financing in January 2008.\n\nIn a paper published in May 2007 in the journal Nature, technology licensed by Follica from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine was used to generate completely new hair follicles for the first time in normal adult mammals.\n\nUnlike currently available treatments that attempt to retain or re-activate existing follicles, this technology provides for the first time, the potential to stimulate entirely new hair follicles. New hair follicles that form after disruption function normally, cycle through the normal stages of hair growth and exhibit normal architecture, including a full complement of stem cells.\n\nAbout Polaris Venture Partners:\n\nA national venture capital firm with over $3 billion under management, Polaris (www.polarisventures.com) invests in seed, early stage and growth equity businesses in the life science, technology, digital media, enertech and consumer sectors.
