The Annual Meeting will be a virtual meeting. You will be able to attend and participate in the Annual Meeting online by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/luciddx/2023.

The Company will not conduct an in-person annual meeting of stockholders in 2023.\n\nStockholders participating in the Annual Meeting will be able to listen only and will not be able to speak during the webcast. However, in order to maintain the interactive nature of the Annual Meeting, virtual attendees will be able to:\n\n●vote via the Annual Meeting webcast; and\n\n●submit questions or comments to the Company’s officers during the Annual Meeting via the Annual Meeting webcast.\n\nStockholders may submit questions or comments during the meeting through the Annual Meeting webcast by typing in the “Submit a question” box.\n\nWhat proposals are being presented for a stockholder vote at the Annual Meeting?\n\nThere are four proposals being presented for stockholder vote at the Annual Meeting:\n\n●the election of two members of the Board as Class B directors, to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified (referred to herein as the “Director Election Proposal”);\n\n●the separate approval of amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation\n\n○to incorporate new Delaware law provisions regarding officer exculpation; and\n\n○to increase the total number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue by 100,000,000 shares, from 100,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares (referred to herein, collectively, as the “Charter Amendment Proposals”);\n\n●the separate approval, for the purposes of Listing Rule 5635 of Nasdaq, of:\n\n○the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock under the March 2023 Note; and\n\n○the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock under the Series A Preferred Stock (referred to herein, collectively, as the “Stock Issuance Proposals”); and\n\n●the ratification of the appointment of Marcum LLP as the Company’s independent registered certified public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2023 (referred to herein as the “Accountant Ratification Proposal”).\n\nStockholders will also consider any other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.\n\nWhat are the recommendations of the Board?\n\nThe Board recommends that you vote:\n\n●“FOR” the election of the management nominees in the Director Election Proposal;\n\n●“FOR” each of the Charter Amendment Proposals;\n\n●“FOR” each of the Stock Issuance Proposals; and\n\n●“FOR” the Accountant Ratification Proposal.\n\nWhy did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?\n\nThe Company uses the internet as the primary means of furnishing proxy materials to stockholders. The Company is sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice of Internet Availability”) to its stockholders with instructions on how to access the proxy materials online at www.cstproxy.com/luciddx/2023 or request a printed copy of the materials.\n\nStockholders may follow the instructions in the Notice of Internet Availability to elect to receive future proxy materials in print by mail or electronically by email. The Company encourages stockholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials online to help reduce the environmental impact of the Company’s annual meetings and reduce the Company’s printing and mailing costs.\n\nWho is entitled to vote?\n\nThe holders of the Company’s common stock at the close of business on the record date, April 25, 2023, are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the record date, [●] shares of common stock were outstanding (inclusive of shares underlying unvested restricted stock awards). Holders of the Company’s common stock have one vote for each share that they own on such date.\n\nWhat is the difference between a record holder and a beneficial owner?\n\nIf your shares are registered in your name with the Company’s transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, then you are considered the “record holder” for those shares. If you are the record holder of your shares, you have the right to vote your shares by proxy or to attend the meeting and vote via the Annual Meeting webcast.\n\nIf your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, then you are considered to hold your shares in “street name.” While you are the “beneficial owner” of those shares, you are not considered the record holder. As the beneficial owner of shares of the Company’s common stock, you have the right to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares. However, since you are not the record holder of your shares, you may not vote these shares at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from the stockholder of record.\n\nHow do I submit my vote?\n\nRecord Owners. Record holders can vote by the following methods:\n\n●By Attending the Annual Meeting. You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote via the Annual Meeting webcast.\n\n●By Proxy via the Internet. You may vote by proxy via the Internet. Your Notice of Internet Availability or proxy card provides instructions for accessing the website through which you may submit a proxy via the Internet.\n\n●By Proxy via the Mail. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials, you may vote by proxy via the mail by completing the included proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid return envelope.\n\nBeneficial Owners. Beneficial owners of shares held in street name may instruct their bank, broker or other nominee how to vote their shares. Beneficial owners should refer to the materials provided to them by their nominee for information on communicating these “voting instructions.” Beneficial owners may not vote their shares at the Annual Meeting unless they obtain a legal proxy from the stockholder of record and follow the instructions set forth above for attending the Annual Meeting.\n\nWhat does it mean to vote by proxy?\n\nWhen you vote “by proxy,” you grant another person the power to vote stock that you own. If you vote by proxy in accordance with this proxy statement, you will have designated the following individuals as your proxy holders for the Annual Meeting: Lishan Aklog, M.D., the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; and Dennis McGrath, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAny proxy given pursuant to this solicitation and received in time for the Annual Meeting will be voted in accordance with your specific instructions. If you provide a proxy, but you do not provide specific instructions on how to vote on each proposal, the proxy holder will vote your shares “FOR” election of the management nominees in the Director Election Proposal, “FOR” each of the Charter Amendment Proposals, “FOR” each of the Stock Issuance Proposals, and “FOR” the Accountant Ratification Proposal. With respect to any other proposal that properly comes before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote in their own discretion according to their best judgment, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.\n\nHow do I attend the Annual Meeting?\n\nThe Annual Meeting will be a virtual meeting. Any stockholder wishing to attend the Annual Meeting must register in advance. To register for and attend the Annual Meeting, please follow these instructions as applicable to the nature of your ownership of the Company’s common stock:\n\nRecord Owners. If you are a record holder, and you wish to attend the Annual Meeting, go to https://www.cstproxy.com/luciddx/2023, enter the control number you received on your Notice of Internet Availability or proxy card, and click on the “Click here to preregister for the online meeting” link at the top of the page. Immediately prior to the start of the Annual Meeting, you will need to log back into the meeting site using your control number. You must register before the meeting starts.\n\nBeneficial Owners. Beneficial owners who wish to attend the Annual Meeting must obtain a legal proxy from the stockholder of record and e-mail a copy (a legible photograph is sufficient) of their legal proxy to proxy@continentalstock.com. Beneficial owners should contact their bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding obtaining a legal proxy. Beneficial owners who e-mail a valid legal proxy will be issued a meeting control number that will allow them to register to attend and participate in the Annual Meeting. You will receive an e-mail prior to the meeting with a link and instructions for entering the Annual Meeting. Beneficial owners should contact Continental Stock Transfer no later than 4:00 p.m. on June 13, 2023.\n\nStockholders will also have the option to listen to the Annual Meeting by telephone by calling:\n\n●Within the U.S. and Canada: (800) 450-7155 (toll-free)\n\n●Outside of the U.S. and Canada: (857) 999-9155 (standard rates apply)\n\nThe passcode for telephone access is 4818543#. You will not be able to vote or submit questions unless you register for and log in to the Annual Meeting webcast as described above.\n\nWhat happens if I do not provide voting instructions to my bank, broker or other nominee?\n\nIf you are a beneficial owner and do not provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions and do not obtain a legal proxy, under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, your bank, broker or other nominee generally may vote on routine matters but may not vote on non-routine matters. If your bank, broker or other nominee does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, your bank, broker or other nominee will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.”\n\nThe Company expects that the Director Election Proposal and the Stock Issuance Proposals will be considered non-routine matters. If they are treated as non-routine matters, as expected, broker non-votes may occur with respect to these proposals. The Company expects that the Charter Amendment Proposals and the Auditor Ratification Proposal will be considered routine matters. If they are treated as routine matters, as expected, broker non-votes should not occur with respect to these proposals.\n\nHow do I revoke my proxy or voting instructions?\n\nRecord Owners. A record holder may revoke his, her or its proxy by (i) submitting a subsequent written notice of revocation that is received by the Company’s Secretary at any time prior to the voting at the Annual Meeting, (ii) submitting a subsequent proxy prior to the voting at the Annual Meeting or (iii) attending the Annual Meeting and voting via the Annual Meeting webcast. Attendance by a stockholder at the Annual Meeting does not alone serve to revoke a stockholder’s proxy. Stockholders may send written notice of revocation to the Secretary, Lucid Diagnostics Inc., 360 Madison Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, New York 10017.\n\nBeneficial Owners. Beneficial owners should refer to the materials provided to them by their bank, broker or other nominee for information on changing their voting instructions.\n\nWhat constitutes a quorum?\n\nThe presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions are voted neither “FOR” nor “AGAINST” a matter, but are counted in the determination of a quorum. Similarly, as described above, a “broker non-vote” may occur with respect to shares held in street name when the bank, broker or other nominee has not received instructions from the beneficial owner as to how the shares are to be voted on a non-routine matter and does not have discretionary authority to vote such shares on the matter. The shares subject to a proxy which are not being voted on a particular non-routine matter because of a broker non-vote will not be considered shares present and entitled to vote on the matter. These shares may be present and entitled to vote on other matters (including other routine matters), in which case the shares will count as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. If the proxy indicates that the shares are not being voted on any matter at the Annual Meeting, however, the shares will not be counted as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum.\n\nHow many votes are required to approve each proposal?\n\nDirector Election Proposal. Election of a nominee in the Director Election Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. “Plurality” means that the individuals who receive the largest number of votes cast “FOR” their election (up to the number of directors to be elected) are elected as directors. Consequently, abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the vote with respect to this proposal.\n\nCharter Amendment Proposals. Approval of each of the Charter Amendment Proposals requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals. However, if banks, brokers and other nominees have discretionary authority to vote on these proposals, as expected, there should not be any broker non-votes with respect to these proposals.\n\nStock Issuance Proposals. Approval of each of the Stock Issuance Proposals requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions, which are considered present and entitled to vote on these matters, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal. Broker non-votes, which are not considered present and entitled to vote on this matter, will not have any effect on the vote with respect to these proposals.\n\nAccountant Ratification Proposal. The Accountant Ratification Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions, which are considered present and entitled to vote on this matter, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal. Broker non-votes, which are not considered present and entitled to vote on this matter, will not have any effect on the vote with respect to this proposal. However, if banks, brokers and other nominees have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal, as expected, there should not be any broker non-votes with respect to this proposal. The results of the Accountant Ratification Proposal are advisory and non-binding on the Board.\n\nDoes the Company have a controlling stockholder?\n\nAs of April 4, 2023, PAVmed Inc. (“PAVmed”) owned approximately 72% of the Company’s outstanding common stock and is the Company’s controlling stockholder. Accordingly, PAVmed has the power to elect all the members of the Board and determine the outcome of all other matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders, without the consent of the Company’s other stockholders. PAVmed has indicated that it intends to vote “FOR” the management nominees in the Director Election Proposal, “FOR” each of the Charter Amendment Proposals, “FOR” each of the Stock Issuance Proposals and “FOR” the Accountant Ratification Proposal.\n\nWill I have dissenters’ rights with respect to any of the matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting?\n\nNeither Delaware law, nor the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, provides for appraisal or other similar rights for dissenting stockholders in connection with any of the matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, stockholders will have no right to dissent and obtain payment for their shares.\n\nWho is paying for this proxy statement and the solicitation of my proxy, and how are proxies solicited?\n\nProxies are being solicited by the Board for use at the Annual Meeting. The Company’s officers and other employees, without additional remuneration, also may assist in the solicitation of proxies in the ordinary course of their employment. In addition to the use of the mail and the Internet, solicitations may be made personally or by email or telephone, as well as by public announcement.\n\nThe Company will bear the cost of this proxy solicitation. The Company may also request brokers, dealers, banks and their nominees to solicit proxies from their clients where appropriate, and may reimburse them for reasonable expenses related thereto.\n\nWho can help answer my questions?\n\nIf you have questions about how to vote or direct a vote in respect of your shares or about the proposals, or if you need additional copies of the proxy statement or proxy card, you may contact the Company at:\n\nLucid Diagnostics Inc.\n\n360 Madison Avenue, 25th Floor\n\nNew York, New York 10017\n\nAttention: Secretary\n\nTHE DIRECTOR ELECTION PROPOSAL\n\nThe Board is divided into three classes, Class A, Class B and Class C. Currently, there are two directors in Class A, Jacque J. Sokolov, M.D. and Stanley N. Lapidus, whose terms expire at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, two directors in Class B, Ronald M. Sparks and James L. Cox, M.D., whose terms expire at the Annual Meeting, and two directors in Class C, Lishan Aklog, M.D. and Debra J. White, whose terms expire at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders.\n\nAt the Annual Meeting, the Company’s stockholders will elect two Class B directors, to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. The Board is nominating Ronald M. Sparks and James L. Cox, M.D., each a current Class B director, for re-election as the Class B directors. Biographical information about the nominees can be found in “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” below.\n\nEach of the nominees has agreed to be named in this proxy statement and to serve as a director if elected. Unless otherwise specified by you when you give your proxy, the shares subject to your proxy will be voted “FOR” the election of these nominees. In case any of these nominees become unavailable for election to the Board, an event which is not anticipated, the proxy holders, or their substitutes, shall have full discretion and authority to vote or refrain from voting your shares for any other person in accordance with their best judgment.\n\nRequired Vote and Recommendation\n\nNominees that receive the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, will be elected as directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the vote with respect to this proposal.\n\nPAVmed, as the owner of a majority of the Company’s common stock, can control the outcome of this election. PAVmed indicated it intends to vote in favor of the management nominees for director.\n\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” EACH NOMINEE LISTED ABOVE.\n\nTHE CHARTER AMENDMENT PROPOSALS\n\nOn April [●], 2023, the Board unanimously adopted and declared the advisability of amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to (i) provide for exculpation of certain of the Company’s officers from liability in specific circumstances, as permitted by Delaware law (the “Officer Exculpation Amendment”) and (ii) increase the total number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue by 100,000,000 shares, from 100,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares (the “Authorized Capital Amendment”). The Board further directed that these amendments be considered for approval by the Company’s stockholders at the next annual meeting of stockholders. Accordingly, at the Annual Meeting, stockholders will vote on separate proposals to approve these amendments.\n\nThe form of the certificate of amendment is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. If approved by the stockholders, the amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State, which will occur as soon as reasonably practicable after the Annual Meeting.\n\nOfficer Exculpation Amendment\n\nGeneral\n\nThe State of Delaware, which is the Company’s state of incorporation, recently enacted legislation that enables Delaware corporations, like the Company, to limit the liability of certain of their officers in limited circumstances under Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). In light of this legislation, the Company is proposing to amend paragraph A of Article Eighth of its Certificate of Incorporation to provide for exculpation of certain of the Company’s officers from liability in specific circumstances, as permitted by Delaware law. The new Delaware legislation only permits, and the proposed amendment would only permit, exculpation for direct claims (as opposed to derivative claims made by stockholders on behalf of the Company) and would not apply to breaches of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or any transaction in which the officer derived an improper personal benefit. The rationale for so limiting the scope of liability is to strike a balance between stockholders’ interest in accountability and their interest in the Company being able to attract and retain quality officers to work on such stockholders’ behalf.\n\nReasons for the Officer Exculpation Amendment\n\nThe Company’s Certificate of Incorporation currently provides for the exculpation of directors but does not currently include a provision that allows for the exculpation of officers. The Board believes it is appropriate for the Company, as a public company, to have exculpation clauses for both officers and directors in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation. Officers, like directors, often make decisions on crucial matters. Frequently, officers, like directors, must make such decisions in response to time-sensitive opportunities and challenges. Even when acting in good faith and with the intention of furthering the interests of the Company and its stockholders, the Company’s officers may become subject to investigations, claims, actions, suits or other proceedings seeking to impose liability on them personally by parties who, with the benefit of hindsight, question the judgments made by them, especially in the current litigious environment. As a result, officers, like directors, may be exposed to substantial personal financial and other risks. Limiting officers’ concern about personal risk stemming from unintentional missteps would empower them to best exercise their business judgment in furtherance of stockholder interests. The Company expects a number of industry participants to adopt similar exculpation clauses that limit the personal liability of officers in their charters and failing to adopt the amendment could impact the Company’s recruitment and retention of exceptional officer candidates, as they may conclude that the potential exposure to personal financial and other risks exceeds the benefits of serving as an officer of the Company. The proposed amendment would better position the Company to attract top officer candidates and retain its current officers and enable the officers to exercise their business judgment in furtherance of the interests of the Company and its stockholders without the potential for distraction posed by such risks. Additionally, it will align the protections for the Company’s officers with those protections afforded to its directors.\n\nTaking into account the narrow class and type of claims for which officers’ liability would be exculpated, and the benefits the Board believes would accrue to the Company and its stockholders as described above, the Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation be approved.\n\nAuthorized Capital Amendment\n\nGeneral\n\nIf the amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation is approved, the Board will be authorized to issue 100,000,000 additional shares of common stock (for a total of 200,000,000 shares), in its discretion, without further approval of the stockholders. The Board does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of the shares of common stock, unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or securities exchange rules.\n\nThe 100,000,000 additional shares of common stock for which authorization is sought would be identical to the 100,000,000 shares of common stock the Company is presently authorized to issue. Holders of the common stock do not have preemptive rights to subscribe to additional securities which may be issued by the Company. The holders of the common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares of the common stock voted in an election of directors can elect all of the Company’s directors. PAVmed, as the holder of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock, has the power to elect all the members of the Board and determine the outcome of all other matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders, without the consent of the Company’s other stockholders. The holders of the common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as, and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefor. The Company has never paid dividends on its shares of common stock. In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of the common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution after payment of liabilities and after provision has been made for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. There is no redemption or sinking fund provision applicable to the common stock.\n\nThe Company’s Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes the Company to issue 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 20,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nReasons for the Authorized Capital Amendment\n\nAs of April 4, 2023, 43,625,703 shares of the common stock were issued and outstanding (inclusive of shares of common stock underlying unvested restricted stock awards). In addition, as of such date:\n\n●5,052,458 shares of the Company’s common stock were issuable upon exercise of the Company’s outstanding stock options, at a weighted average exercise price of $2.19 per share;\n\n●9,774,032 shares of the Company’s common stock were issuable upon conversion of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, assuming the shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted in full on such date at the current conversion price of $1.394 per share. The number of shares of common stock to be issued under the Series A Preferred Stock may be significantly greater than this amount, because dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be paid in shares of the Company’s common stock. See “The Stock Issuance Proposals—The Series A Offering” below; and\n\n●2,364,064 shares of the Company’s common stock were issuable upon conversion of the March 2023 Note, assuming the principal of the March 2023 Note and interest thereon were converted in full on such date at the current fixed conversion price of $5.00 per share. The number of shares of common stock to be issued under the March 2023 Note may be substantially greater than this amount, if the Company makes the amortization payments of principal and interest in shares of the Company’s common stock, because in such cases (and in certain other cases as described elsewhere in this proxy statement) the number of shares issued will be determined based on the then current market price (but in any event not more than fixed conversion price per share or less than a floor price). The Company cannot predict the market price of its common stock at any future date, and therefore, the Company is unable to accurately forecast or predict the total amount of shares that ultimately may be issued under the March 2023 Note. In addition, the number of shares issued under the March 2023 Note may be substantially greater if the Company voluntarily lowers the conversion price, which the Company is permitted to do pursuant to the terms thereof. See “The Stock Issuance Proposals—The March 2023 Note Offering” below.\n\nIn addition, as of April 4, 2022, 3,834,058 shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance, but not subject to outstanding stock-based equity awards, under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2018 Long Term Incentive Equity Plan (the “2018 Plan”) and 683,983 shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance, but have not yet been issued, under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated (the “ESPP”). The number of shares available under the 2018 Plan will automatically increase on January 1st of each year, through (and including) January 1, 2032, in an amount equal to 6% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, unless the Board provides for a lesser amount. Similarly, the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP will automatically increase on January 1st of each year, through (and including) January 1, 2032, in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 2% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, and (b) 1,000,000 shares, unless the Board provides for a lesser amount.\n\nFurthermore, (i) in March 2022, the Company entered into a committed equity facility with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., pursuant to which the affiliate committed to purchase up to $50 million in shares of the Company’s common stock (of which $48.2 million remains), from time to time at the Company’s request, at prices based on the current market price; (ii) in November 2022, the Company entered into an “at-the-market offering” for up to $6.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock (of which $6.2 million remains), that may be offered and sold under a controlled equity offering agreement between the Company and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., (iii) in August 2022, the Company entered into a sixth amendment to the management services agreement with PAVmed, pursuant to which PAVmed may elect to receive payment of the monthly fee under the management services agreement in cash or in shares of the Company’s common stock, with such shares valued at a price based on the current market price; and (iv) in November 2022, the Company entered into a payroll and benefits expense reimbursement agreement with PAVmed, pursuant to which PAVmed will continue to pay certain payroll and benefit-related expenses on the Company’s behalf and the Company will reimburse PAVmed on a quarterly basis or at such other frequency as the parties may determine, in cash or, subject to approval by each of the Board, in shares of the Company common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares, with any such shares valued at a price based on the current market price.\n\nThe Board believes approval of the amendment is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. In addition, under the March 2023 SPA (as defined in the “Stock Issuance Proposal” below), the Company agreed to hold a stockholder meeting, by no later than July 31, 2023, to approve resolutions authorizing, among other things, the increase in authorized shares of contemplated by this proposal, and will be obligated to continue to seek stockholder approval quarterly until such approval is obtained. Accordingly, failure to obtain stockholder approval of this proposal also will require the Company to incur the costs of holding one or more additional stockholder meetings until the Company obtains such approval.\n\nThe authorization of additional shares of common stock will enable the Company to meet its obligations under its outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities, and its equity compensation plans, while retaining flexibility to respond to future business needs and opportunities. For example, the additional shares may be used for additional equity awards to the Company’s employees, for financing the Company’s business (including for the payment of liabilities owed to PAVmed or third parties), for acquiring other businesses, or for forming strategic partnerships and alliances. The Company explores opportunities for such transactions, including equity capital raises, acquisitions and strategic partnerships and alliances, as they arise or as the Company’s needs require. Although the Company frequently reviews various transactions, the Company has no current agreement or commitment to issue additional shares of its common stock, except as described above.\n\nThe issuance of additional shares of common stock for which authorization is sought may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and on the equity and voting power of existing security holders of the Company’s capital stock. See “Description of Common Stock” below. It may also adversely affect the market price of the common stock. However, if the issuance of additional shares of common stock allows the Company to pursue its business plan and grow its business, the market price of the common stock may increase.\n\nWhile not intended as an anti-takeover provision, the additional shares of common stock for which authorization is sought could also be used by management to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or to delay or prevent changes in control or management of the Company. For example, without further stockholder approval, the Board could strategically sell shares of common stock to purchasers who would oppose a takeover or favor the current Board. Although the amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation has been prompted by business and financial considerations and not by the threat of any hostile takeover attempt (nor is the Board currently aware of any such attempts directed at the Company), approval of the proposal could facilitate future efforts by management to deter or prevent changes in control of the Company, including transactions in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. The Board is not aware of any attempt, or contemplated attempt, to acquire control of the Company, and the amendment is not being presented with the intent that it be utilized as a type of anti-takeover device or to secure management’s positions within the Company.\n\nRequired Vote and Recommendation\n\nApproval of each of the Charter Amendment Proposals requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals.\n\nPAVmed, as the owner of a majority of the Company’s common stock, can control the outcome of the vote on these proposals. PAVmed indicated it intends to vote in favor of both proposals and has agreed with the purchaser of the March 2023 Note to vote in favor of the Authorized Capital Amendment. See “The Stock Issuance Proposals—The March 2023 Note Offering—Ancillary Agreements” below.\n\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” EACH OF THE CHARTER AMENDMENT PROPOSALS.\n\nTHE STOCK ISSUANCE PROPOSALS\n\nIn March 2023, the Company completed the following financing transactions:\n\n●On March 7, 2023, the Company entered into subscription agreements (each, a “Series A Subscription Agreement”) with certain accredited investors for the sale of 13,625 shares of newly designated Series A Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $1,000 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $13.625 million (the “Series A Offering”). The closing of the sale occurred effective on March 7, 2023.\n\n●On March 13, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “March 2023 Note SPA”) with an accredited investor, for the sale of a Senior Secured Convertible Note with an initial principal amount of $11,111,110 (the “March 2023 Note”) in a private placement (the “March 2023 Note Offering”). The closing of the sale of the March 2023 Note occurred on March 21, 2023.\n\nPursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5635(d), stockholder approval is required prior to the issuance of securities in a transaction, other than a public offering, involving the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the Company of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock), which equals 20% or more of the common stock or 20% or more of the voting power outstanding before the issuance, at a price less than the lower of: (i) the closing price immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement, or (ii) the average closing price of the common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement for the transaction.\n\nThe number of shares of the Company’s common stock issuable in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock and the March 2023 Note may exceed this limit. Accordingly, in light of Nasdaq Rule 5635(d), unless the Company obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by Nasdaq, the Company will not effect any conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, and a holder of Series A Preferred Stock will not have the right to receive dividends or convert any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to a dividend or a conversion, the holder would have received in respect of its shares of Series A Preferred Stock in excess of its pro rata share of 19.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock as of immediately prior to the transaction. Similarly, the March 2023 Note provides that, unless the Company obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by Nasdaq, the Company is prohibited from issuing any shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the March 2023 Note, if the issuance would exceed the aggregate number of shares of common stock which the Company may issue without breaching the Company’s obligations under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Furthermore, under the March 2023 SPA, the Company agreed to hold a stockholder meeting by no later than July 31, 2023 to approve resolutions authorizing the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock under the March 2023 Note for the purposes of compliance with the stockholder approval rules of Nasdaq.\n\nAccordingly, at the Annual Meeting, stockholders will vote on separate proposals to approve the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock under the Series A Preferred Stock and under the March 2023 Note.\n\nThe Series A Offering\n\nAs of April 4, 2023, the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible into 9,774,032 shares of the Company’s common stock, assuming the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted in full on such date at the current conversion price of $1.394 per share. Assuming all the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding until its mandatory conversion on March 7, 2025 and all dividends thereon are paid, each as more fully described below, the Company anticipates that it will issue 13,683,644 shares of common stock to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock\n\nIn connection with the sale of the Series A Preferred Stock, on March 7, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series A Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Series A Certificate of Designations”). The key terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are as follows:\n\nConversion. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations as set forth in the Series A Certificate of Designations and described below, into such number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of Series A Preferred Shares to be converted, multiplied by the stated value of $1,000 (the “Stated Value”), divided by the conversion price in effect at the time of the conversion. The conversion price is $1.394, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, and similar transactions. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations as set forth in the Series A Certificate of Designations and described below, on March 7, 2025.\n\nRank. The Series A Preferred Stock is senior to the common stock and any other class of the Company’s capital stock that is not by its terms senior to or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nDividends. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends payable as follows: (i) a number of shares of common stock equal to 20% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock then held by such holder on March 7, 2024, and (ii) a number of shares of common stock equal to 20% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock then held by such holder on March 7, 2025. A holder that converts its Series A Preferred Stock prior to March 7, 2024 or March 7, 2025, as the case may be, will not receive the dividend that accrues on such date with respect to such converted Series A Preferred Stock. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock also will be entitled to dividends, on an as-if-converted to shares of common stock basis, equal to, and in the same form as, dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock when, as, and if such dividends are paid on shares of the common stock.\n\nLiquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (or any Deemed Liquidation Event as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designations), the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment shall be made to the holders of common stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Stated Value, plus any dividends accrued but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series A Preferred Stock been converted into common stock immediately prior to such event.\n\nVoting. Except as otherwise provided in the Series A Certificate of Designations or as otherwise required by law, the holders of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights.\n\nBeneficial Ownership Limitation. The Company will not effect any conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, and a holder will not have the right to receive dividends or convert any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the receipt of dividends or the conversion, the holder (together with such holder’s affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with such holder or any of the holder’s affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock (or, upon election of the holder, 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock).\n\nExchange Limitation. Unless the Company obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by Nasdaq, the Company will not effect any conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, including, without limitation, an automatic conversion, and a holder of Series A Preferred Stock will not have the right to receive dividends or convert any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to a dividend or a conversion, the holder would have received in respect of its shares of Series A Preferred Stock in excess of its pro rata share of 19.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock as of immediately prior to the transaction. A holder’s pro rata share of the limitation is equal to (i) the original purchase price paid to the Company for all the shares of Series A Preferred Stock acquired by the holder (and not subsequently disposed of, other than pursuant to a conversion hereunder), divided by (ii) the aggregate original purchase price paid to the Company for all the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and all other securities aggregated with the Series A Preferred Stock for the purposes of the Nasdaq rules.\n\nAncillary Agreements\n\nThe Company and the investors in the Series A Offering also executed a registration rights agreement (the “Series A Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nThe information set forth in this section is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Series A Certificate of Designations and Series A Registration Rights Agreement, which are attached as Exhibits 3.1 and 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on March 13, 2023.\n\nThe March 2023 Note Offering\n\nAs of April 4, 2023, the March 2023 Note was convertible into 2,364,064 shares of the Company’s common stock, assuming the principal of the March 2023 Note and interest thereon were converted in full on such date at the current fixed conversion price of $5.00 per share. If all Installment Amounts (as defined below) are paid in shares of common stock at a price equal to the current market price as of April 4, 2023 (i.e., $1.30), the Company estimates that it would issue 9,092,554 shares to the holder of the March 2023 Note. If such amounts are paid in shares of common stock at a price equal to the Floor Price (as defined below), the Company estimates that it would issue 39,401,067 shares to the holder of the March 2023 Note.\n\nMarch 2023 Note SPA\n\nThe March 2023 Note SPA contains certain representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for similar transactions. Under the March 2023 Note SPA, the Company also agreed to the following additional covenants:\n\n●During the period through and including the 90th day after the maturity date of the March 2023 Note (or such later date as is agreed between the parties), the Company may not issue any securities that would cause a breach of the March 2023 Note, file a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), relating to any securities other than the shares underlying the March 2023 Note or the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock, or issue, offer, sell, grant any option or right to purchase, or otherwise dispose of any equity or equity-linked or related security, any debt, any preferred stock (other than up to $6,375,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock) or any purchase rights, subject to certain exceptions, including issuances at a price greater than $5.00 per share.\n\n●So long as the March 2023 Note remains outstanding, the Company will not effect or enter an agreement to effect any variable rate transaction.\n\n●The Company will hold a stockholder meeting, by no later than July 31, 2023, to approve resolutions (the “Stockholder Resolutions”) authorizing (i) an increase in the authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 100 million to 200 million shares, and (ii) the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock under the Notes for the purposes of compliance with the stockholder approval rules of Nasdaq (as contemplated by this proposal). The Company will be obligated to continue to seek stockholder approval quarterly until such approval is obtained.\n\nIn addition, under the March 2023 Note SPA, the Company granted the purchaser participation rights in future offerings of any equity or equity-linked or related security, any debt, any preferred stock or any purchase rights, during the three years after the closing (or the date no Notes remain outstanding, if later) in an amount of up to 100% of the securities being sold in such offerings.\n\nMarch 2023 Note\n\nGeneral. The March 2023 Note accrues interest at a rate of 7.875% per annum and matures on March 21, 2025 (the “Maturity Date”), subject to the right of the noteholder to extend the Maturity Date under certain circumstances. The March 2023 Note is required to be senior to all the Company’s other indebtedness, other than certain permitted indebtedness.\n\nSecurity. The March 2023 Note is secured by all the Company’s existing and future assets (including those of the Company’s significant subsidiaries), pursuant to a security agreement by and between the Company and the holder of the March 2023 Note (the “March 2023 Note Security Agreement”).\n\nGuaranty. The obligations under the March 2023 Note are guaranteed by all of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries, pursuant to a guaranty by the Company’s subsidiaries in favor of the holder of the March 2023 Note (the “March 2023 Note Guaranty”).\n\nVoluntary Conversion. All or any portion of the principal amount of the March 2023 Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest and any late charges thereon, is convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the noteholder’s option, into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial fixed conversion price of $5.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments.\n\nAlternate Conversion. At any time during an Event of Default Redemption Right Period (as defined in the March 2023 Note), a noteholder may alternatively elect to convert all or any portion of the March 2023 Note at an alternate conversion price equal to the lower of: (i) the fixed conversion price then in effect, and (ii) the lowest of 80% of the VWAP of the Company’s common stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable notice of conversion, 80% of the VWAP of the Company’s common stock as of the trading day of the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable notice of conversion, 80% of the VWAP of the Company’s common stock as of the trading day immediately prior to the time of occurrence of the applicable event of default, and 80% of the average VWAP of the Company’s common stock for each of the two trading days with the lowest VWAP of the Company’s common stock during the ten consecutive trading day period ending and including the trading day immediately prior to the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable notice of conversion, but in the case of clause (ii), not less than the Floor Price (as defined in the Notes).\n\nInstallments. On September 21, 2023, on the 1st and 10th trading day of each calendar month thereafter, and on the Maturity Date (each, an “Installment Date”), the Company will make an amortization payment on the March 2023 Note in an amount equal to the initial principal balance of the March 2023 Note divided by the total number of such amortization payments (such that the entire initial principal balance will be repaid by the Maturity Date), plus any amounts that have been deferred or accelerated to the applicable Installment Date (as described below), plus all accrued and unpaid interest and any late charges (the “Installment Amount”). Each amortization payment will be satisfied, at the Company’s election, in shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to certain customary equity conditions (including minimum price and volume thresholds) (the “Equity Conditions”), at 100% of the Installment Amount (an “Installment Conversion”), or otherwise (or at the Company’s option, in whole or in part) in cash at 115% of the Installment Amount (an “Installment Redemption”). If the Company effects an Installment Conversion, the Company will convert all or a portion of the Installment Amount into shares of the Company’s common stock at an installment conversion price per share equal to the lower of (i) the fixed conversion price then in effect and (ii) 82.5% of the average VWAP of the Company’s common stock for each of the two trading days with the lowest VWAP of the Company’s common stock during the ten consecutive trading day period ending and including the trading day immediately prior to the applicable Installment Date, but in the case of clause (ii), not less than the Floor Price.\n\nDeferral. A noteholder may, at its election, defer the payment of all or any portion of the Installment Amount due on any Installment Date to another Installment Date.\n\nAcceleration. On any day during the period starting on an Installment Date and ending on the trading day immediately prior to the next Installment Date (the “Installment Period”), a noteholder may, at its election, accelerate the conversion of other Installment Amounts at an acceleration conversion price per share equal to the lower of (i) the installment conversion price for the most recent Installment Date, and (ii) 82.5% of the average VWAP of the Company’s common stock for each of the two trading days with the lowest VWAP of the Company’s common stock during the ten consecutive trading day period ending and including the trading day immediately prior to the acceleration date, but in the case of clause (ii), not less than the Floor Price.\n\nReallocation. A noteholder may, at its election, reallocate all or any portion of the Installment Amount for an Installment Date to a later date during the Installment Period, with such reallocated amount converted at a reallocation conversion price per share equal to the lower of: (i) the fixed conversion price then in effect, and (ii) the lower of (x) the installment conversion price for the such Installment Date, and (y) 82.5% of the average VWAP of the Company’s common stock for each of the two trading days with the lowest VWAP of the Company’s common stock during the ten consecutive trading day period ending and including the trading day immediately prior to the reallocation date, but in the case of clause (y), not less than the Floor Price.\n\nChange of Control. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the March 2023 Note), a noteholder may require the Company to redeem all, or any portion, of the March 2023 Note at a price equal to 115% the greater of: (i) the outstanding value of the March 2023 Note; (ii) the underlying value of the shares then issuable upon conversion of the note (without regard to any limitation on conversion set forth in the March 2023 Note); and (iii) the Change of Control consideration attributable to underlying value of the shares then issuable upon conversion of the March 2023 Note (without regard to any limitation on conversion set forth in the March 2023 Note).\n\nBeneficial Ownership Limitation. A noteholder does not have the right to convert any portion of the March 2023 Note, to the extent that, after giving effect to such conversion, the noteholder (together with certain of its affiliates and other related parties) would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion (the “Maximum Percentage”). The noteholder may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage (which in no event may exceed 9.99%), provided that any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after delivery of a notice to the Company of such increase.\n\nExchange Limitation. Unless the Company obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by Nasdaq, the Company is prohibited from issuing any shares of common stock upon conversion of the March 2023 Note or otherwise pursuant to the terms of the March 2023 Note, if the issuance of such shares of common stock would exceed the aggregate number of shares of common stock which the Company may issue without breaching the Company’s obligations under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq.\n\nEvents of Default. The March 2023 Note provides for certain Events of Default, including, among other things, any breach of the covenants described below and any failure of both Lishan Aklog, M.D., the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to serve as its Chief Executive Officer and Dennis McGrath, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, to serve as its Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. In connection with an Event of Default, the noteholder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the March 2023 Note, in cash, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 132.5% of the conversion amount being redeemed and (ii) the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the conversion amount to be redeemed at the alternate conversion price (as defined in the March 2023 Note) then in effect, multiplied by the greatest closing sale price of the Company’s common stock on any trading day during the period beginning on the date immediately before the Event of Default and ending on the date of redemption.\n\nCovenants. The Company is subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants regarding the rank of the March 2023 Note, the incurrence of indebtedness, the existence of liens, the repayment of indebtedness and the making of investments, the payment of cash in respect of dividends, distributions or redemptions, the transfer of assets, the maturity of other indebtedness, and transactions with affiliates, among other customary matters. The Company also will be subject to financial covenants requiring that (i) the amount of the Company’s available cash equal or exceed $5 million at all times, (ii) the ratio of (a) the outstanding principal amount of the March 2023 Note, accrued and unpaid interest thereon and accrued and unpaid late charges to (b) the Company’s average market capitalization over the prior ten trading days, not exceed 30%, and (iii) that the Company’s market capitalization shall at no time be less than $30 million.\n\nAncillary Agreements\n\nIn connection with the consummation of the sale of the March 2023 Note, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the “March 2023 Note Registration Rights Agreement”) with the investor in the March 2023 Note Offering, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the March 2023 Note and granted the investor certain piggyback registration rights. In addition, the Company entered into a voting agreement (“March 2023 Note Voting Agreement”) with its parent company, PAVmed, which as of April 4, 2023 held an aggregate of approximately 72% of the Company’s common stock, pursuant to which PAVmed agreed to vote the shares of the Company’s common stock now owned or hereafter acquired by it in favor of the Authorized Capital Amendment and the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock under the March 2023 Note.\n\nThe information set forth in this section is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the March 2023 Note, the March 2023 Note SPA, the March 2023 Note Security Agreement, the March 2023 Note Guaranty, the March 2023 Note Registration Rights Agreement and the March 2023 Note Voting Agreement, which are attached as Exhibits 4.1, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on March 14, 2023 and as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on March 24, 2023.\n\nReasons for the Series A Offering and the March 2023 Note Offering\n\nThe Board has determined that the ability to issue shares of the Company’s common stock to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and to the holder of the March 2023 Note is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, because (i) the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock, and the effective price used to value the Company’s common stock for the payment of the dividends thereon, is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of sale of the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) the fixed conversion price of the March 2023 Note represents a substantial premium to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of sale of the March 2023 Note, (iii) the floating price used for any payment of Installment Amounts represents a reasonable discount to the prevailing market price of the Company’s common stock at the time of any such payment, and the floating price is subject to a reasonable minimum price, and (iv) the payment of interest and principal of the March 2023 Note in shares of common stock, and the right of the holder to convert the March 2023 Note, allows the Company to preserve liquidity for other corporate purposes, including the payment of costs and expenses necessary for the commercialization of its products.\n\nEffects if the Stock Issuance Proposals Are Approved\n\nThe additional shares of common stock that would be issuable to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and to the holder of the March 2023 Note would have the same rights and privileges as the shares of the Company’s currently authorized common stock. The issuance of the shares pursuant to the Series A Preferred Stock and the March 2023 Note will not affect the rights of the holders of outstanding common stock, but such issuances will have a dilutive effect on the existing stockholders, including on the voting power and economic rights of the existing stockholders, and may result in a decline in the price of the Company’s common stock or in greater price volatility. See “Description of Capital Stock” below. If the stockholders approve this proposal, the Company will be able to issue shares of its common stock in excess of 19.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock as of March 31, 2023, including upon conversion from time to time of the Series A Preferred Stock and in satisfaction of all Installment Amounts due under the March 2022 Notes (subject to satisfaction of the Equity Conditions).\n\nThe March 2023 Note provides that the holder is prohibited from converting the note to the extent the holder would beneficially own more than 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock after such conversion or payment. Similarly, the Series A Preferred Stock provides that a holder will not have the right to receive dividends or convert any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the receipt of dividends or the conversion, the holder would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock (or, upon election of the holder, 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock). Unlike Nasdaq Rule 5635(d) and the corresponding provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock and the March 2023 Note, which limit the aggregate number of shares the Company may issue to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the March 2023 Note, this beneficial ownership limitation limits the number of shares a holder may beneficially own at any one time. Consequently, the number of shares the holder may beneficially own in compliance with the beneficial ownership limitation may increase over time as the number of outstanding shares of common stock increases over time. In addition, the holder may sell some or all of the shares it receives under the Series A Preferred Stock or the March 2023 Note, permitting it to acquire additional shares in compliance with the beneficial ownership limitation. The Company is not seeking stockholder approval to lift such ownership limitation. Because of the beneficial ownership limitation, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(b), which requires stockholder approval prior to the issuance of securities when the issuance or potential issuance will result in a change of control of the Company, is not implicated. Generally, Nasdaq considers a change of control to have occurred when, as a result of an issuance, an investor would own, or have the right to acquire, 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock and such ownership is the largest ownership position.\n\nEffects if the Stock Issuance Proposals Are Not Approved\n\nThe Company is not seeking the approval of its stockholders to authorize its entry into the Series A Subscription Agreements or the March 2023 Note SPA, and the related documents, or to issue the Series A Preferred Stock or the March 2023 Note, as the Company has already done so and such documents already are binding obligations of the Company. The failure of the Company’s stockholders to approve this proposal will not negate the existing terms of the documents, which will remain a binding obligation of the Company.\n\nIf the stockholders do not approve this proposal, the Company will be unable to issue in excess of 19.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock as of immediately prior to the transactions. As a result, the Company may not be able to satisfy all conversions under the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company may be required to repay its obligations under the March 2023 Note in cash, rather than by the payment of Installment Amounts in shares of common stock. The Company’s ability to successfully implement its business plans and ultimately generate value for its stockholders is dependent upon its ability to raise capital and satisfy its ongoing business needs. If the Company is required to repay its obligations under the March 2023 Note in cash rather than common stock, the Company may not have the capital necessary to fully satisfy its ongoing business needs, the effect of which would adversely impact future operating results, and result in a delay in or modification or abandonment of its business plans. Additionally, it may be necessary for the Company to acquire additional financing in order to repay the obligations under the March 2023 Note in cash, which financing may not be available on advantageous terms and which may result in the incurrence of additional transaction expenses.\n\nIn addition, if the Company’s stockholders do not approve this proposal, under the March 2023 Note SPA, the Company will be required to seek stockholder approval of this proposal on a quarterly basis until it obtains such approval. As such, failure to obtain stockholder approval of this proposal will require the Company to incur the costs of holding one or more additional stockholder meetings until it obtains such approval.\n\nRequired Vote and Recommendation\n\nApproval of each of the Stock Issuance Proposals requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals. Broker non-votes will not have any effect on the vote with respect to these proposals.\n\nPAVmed, as the owner of a majority of the Company’s common stock, can control the outcome of this proposal. PAVmed indicated it intends to vote in favor of both proposals and has agreed to vote in favor of the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock under the March 2023 Note. See “The Stock Issuance Proposals—The March 2023 Note Offering—Ancillary Agreements” above.\n\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL OF THE STOCK ISSUANCE PROPOSALS.\n\nTHE ACCOUNTANT RATIFICATION PROPOSAL\n\nThe Board has appointed Marcum to serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will vote on a proposal to ratify this appointment.\n\nMarcum has served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm since the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. While stockholder ratification of the Board’s decision to retain Marcum is not required by the Company’s bylaws or otherwise, the Board has chosen to submit that selection to the Company’s stockholders for ratification. If the Company’s stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Board may, but is not required to, reconsider whether to retain that firm. Additionally, even if the selection is ratified, the Board may in its discretion direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year, if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\n\nMarcum has advised the Company that the firm is independent with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company expects that representatives of Marcum will be present at the Annual Meeting to make statements and to respond to appropriate questions from the Company’s stockholders.\n\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s Fees and Services\n\nThe following table sets forth the fees billed for or in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 by Marcum, the Company’s principal accountant.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Marcum LLP Audit Fees (1) $397,000 $329,000 Audit-Related Fees (2) — — Tax Fees(3) — — All Other Fees — — Total Fees $397,000 $329,000\n\n(1) Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for audits and quarterly reviews of the Company’s consolidated financial statements during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for services that are normally provided by the accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years, including the issuance of consents in connection with registration statement filings with the SEC and comfort letters in connection with securities offerings. (2) Audit related fees represent the aggregate fees billed for assurance and related professional services rendered by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees.” (3) Tax fees represent the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning services.\n\nThe aggregate fees included in Audit Fees are those billed for the fiscal year. The aggregate fees included in the Audit-Related Fees and Tax Fees are those fees billed in the fiscal year.\n\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\n\nThe audit committee of the Board has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services for the purpose of maintaining the independence of the Company’s independent auditor. The Company may not engage its independent auditor to render any audit or non-audit service unless either the service is approved in advance by the audit committee, or the engagement to render service is entered into pursuant to the audit committee’s pre-approval policies and procedures. All accountant services and fees noted above were either approved in advance by the audit committee or rendered pursuant to such pre-approval policies and procedures.\n\nRequired Vote and Recommendation\n\nApproval of the Accountant Ratification Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” this proposal. Broker non-votes will not have any effect on the vote with respect to this proposal.\n\nPAVmed, as the owner of a majority of the Company’s common stock, can control the outcome of this proposal. PAVmed indicated it intends to vote in favor of this proposal.\n\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF MARCUM LLP AS THE COMPANY’S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\n\nIn the discussion that follows, the Company has summarized selected provisions of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), as they relate to the Company’s common stock. This summary is not complete. This summary is subject to the relevant provisions of the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws. Please read the provisions of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect for provisions that may be important to you.\n\nGeneral\n\nUnder its Certificate of Incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. On March 7, 2023, the Company filed the Series A Certificate of Designations, which designated 20,000 shares of the preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nAs of April 4, 2023, 43,625,703 shares of the common stock were issued and outstanding (inclusive of shares of common stock underlying unvested restricted stock awards). In addition, as of such date:\n\n● 5,052,458 shares of the Company’s common stock were issuable upon exercise of the Company’s outstanding stock options, at a weighted average exercise price of $2.19 per share; ● 9,774,032 shares of the Company’s common stock were issuable upon conversion of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, assuming the shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted in full on such date at the current conversion price of $1.394 per share. The number of shares of common stock to be issued under the Series A Preferred Stock may be significantly greater than this amount, because dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be paid in shares of the Company’s common stock. See “The Stock Issuance Proposals—The Series A Offering” above; and ● 2,364,064 shares of the Company’s common stock were issuable upon conversion of the March 2023 Note, assuming the principal of the March 2023 Note and interest thereon were converted in full on such date at the current fixed conversion price of $5.00 per share. The number of shares of common stock to be issued under the March 2023 Note may be substantially greater than this amount, if the Company makes the amortization payments of principal and interest in shares of the Company’s common stock, because in such cases (and in certain other cases as described elsewhere in this proxy statement) the number of shares issued will be determined based on the then current market price (but in any event not more than fixed conversion price per share or less than a floor price). The Company cannot predict the market price of its common stock at any future date, and therefore, the Company is unable to accurately forecast or predict the total amount of shares that ultimately may be issued under the March 2023 Note. In addition, the number of shares issued under the March 2023 Note may be substantially greater if the Company voluntarily lowers the conversion price, which the Company is permitted to do pursuant to the terms thereof. See “The Stock Issuance Proposals—The March 2023 Note Offering” above.\n\nIn addition, as of April 4, 2023, 3,834,058 shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance, but not subject to outstanding stock-based equity awards, under the 2018 Plan and 683,983 shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance, but not yet issued, under the ESPP. The number of shares available under the 2018 Plan will automatically increase on January 1st of each year, through (and including) January 1, 2032, in an amount equal to 6% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, unless the Board provides for a lesser amount. Similarly, the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP will automatically increase on January 1st of each year, through (and including) January 1, 2032, in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 2% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, and (b) 1,000,000 shares, unless the Board provides for a lesser amount.\n\nFurthermore, (i) in March 2022, the Company entered into a committed equity facility with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., pursuant to which the affiliate committed to purchase up to $50 million in shares of the Company’s common stock (of which $48.2 million remains), from time to time at the Company’s request, at prices based on the current market price; (ii) in November 2022, the Company entered into an “at-the-market offering” for up to $6.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock (of which $6.2 million remains), that may be offered and sold under a controlled equity offering agreement between the Company and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., (iii) in August 2022, the Company entered into a sixth amendment to the management services agreement with PAVmed, pursuant to which PAVmed may elect to receive payment of the monthly fee under the management services agreement in cash or in shares of the Company’s common stock, with such shares valued at a price based on the current market price; and (iv) in November 2022, the Company entered into a payroll and benefits expense reimbursement agreement with PAVmed, pursuant to which PAVmed will continue to pay certain payroll and benefit-related expenses on the Company’s behalf and the Company will reimburse PAVmed on a quarterly basis or at such other frequency as the parties may determine, in cash or, subject to approval by each of the Board, in shares of the Company common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares, with any such shares valued at a price based on the current market price.\n\nAs of April 4, 2023, 13,625 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.\n\nCommon Stock\n\nHolders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. As of April 4, 2023, PAVmed owned approximately 72% of the Company’s outstanding common stock and is the Company’s controlling stockholder. Accordingly, PAVmed has the power to elect all the members of the Board and determine the outcome of all other matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders, without the consent of the Company’s other stockholders. Subject to any preferential dividend rights of any outstanding shares of preferred stock, holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if declared by the Board, out of funds that the Company may legally use to pay dividends. If the Company liquidates or dissolves, holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in the Company’s assets once the Company’s debts and any liquidation preference owed to any then-outstanding preferred stockholders are paid. The Company’s common stockholders have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights, and no liquidation preference, and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the common stock. All shares of common stock that are outstanding are fully-paid and non-assessable.\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nThe Board has the authority, without further action by the Company’s stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions thereof. These rights, preferences and privileges could include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, and sinking fund terms, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon the Company’s liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Companyor other corporate action. Although the Company does not currently intend to issue any additional shares of preferred stock, the Company cannot assure you that it will not do so in the future.\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock\n\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is senior to the common stock and any other class of the Company’s capital stock that is not by its terms senior to or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nEach share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations as set forth in the Series A Certificate of Designations and described below, into such number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of Series A Preferred Shares to be converted, multiplied by the Stated Value, divided by the conversion price in effect at the time of the conversion. The conversion price is $1.394, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, and similar transactions. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations as set forth in the Series A Certificate of Designations and described below, on March 7, 2025.\n\nThe holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends payable as follows: a number of shares of common stock equal to 20% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock then held by such holder on each of March 7, 2024 and 2025. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock also will be entitled to dividends, on an as-if-converted to shares of common stock basis, equal to, and in the same form as, dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock when, as, and if such dividends are paid on shares of the common stock.\n\nIn the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (or any Deemed Liquidation Event as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designations), the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment shall be made to the holders of common stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Stated Value, plus any dividends accrued but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series A Preferred Stock been converted into common stock immediately prior to such event.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in the Series A Certificate of Designations or as otherwise required by law, the holders of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have no voting rights.\n\nDividends\n\nThe Company has not paid any cash dividends on its shares of common stock to date. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon the Company’s revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition and will be within the discretion of the Board. It is the present intention of the Board to retain all earnings, if any, for use in the Company’s business operations and, accordingly, the Board does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn addition, as long as the March 2023 Note is outstanding, the Company may not, directly or indirectly, redeem, or declare or pay any cash dividend or cash distribution on, any of its securities without the prior express written consent of the purchaser of the March 2023 Note. Furthermore, the Company’s common stock is junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends.\n\nThe Company is required to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in shares of the Company’s common stock as described above.\n\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\n\nDelaware law and the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire the Company by means of a tender offer or a proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove the Company’s incumbent officers and directors.\n\nThese provisions of Delaware law and the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of preventing changes in the composition of the Company’s Board and management. These provisions may also have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of the Company’s common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in the Company’s best interests, including transactions which provide for payment of a premium over the market price for the Company’s shares.\n\nThese provisions are intended to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to first negotiate with the Board. The Company believes that the benefits of the increased protection of the Company’s ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure the Company outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.\n\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Statute\n\nThe Company is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits persons deemed to be “interested stockholders” from engaging in a “business combination” with a publicly held Delaware corporation for three years following the date these persons become interested stockholders unless the business combination is, or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder was, approved in a prescribed manner or another prescribed exception applies. Generally, an “interested stockholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock. Generally, a “business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board. A Delaware corporation may “opt out” of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from a stockholders’ amendment approved by at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares. The Company has not opted out of these provisions. As a result, mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts of the Company may be discouraged or prevented.\n\nUndesignated Preferred Stock\n\nThe ability of the Board, without action by the stockholders, to issue undesignated shares of preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences as designated by the Board could impede the success of any attempt to change control of the Company. These and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of the Company.\n\nAuthorized Common Stock\n\nThe Company’s authorized but unissued shares of common stock will be available for future issuance without stockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital and corporate acquisitions. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock also could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of the Company’s common stock by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\n\nClassified Board of Directors\n\nThe Board is divided into three classes. The number of directors in each class will be as nearly equal as possible. Directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election. The existence of a classified board may extend the time required to make any change in control of the Board when compared to a corporation with an unclassified board. It may take two annual meetings for the Company’s stockholders to effect a change in control of the Board, because in general less than a majority of the members of the Board will be elected at a given annual meeting. Because the Board is classified and the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation does not otherwise provide, under Delaware law, the Company’s directors may only be removed for cause.\n\nVacancies on the Board\n\nThe Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws provide that any vacancy occurring on the Board, including by reason of removal of a director, and any newly created directorship may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office. This system of appointing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company’s company, because it generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors.\n\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations\n\nThe Company’s bylaws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at any meeting of stockholders. The Company’s bylaws also will specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder’s notice. These provisions may preclude the Company’s stockholders from bringing matters before the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at the Company’s meetings of stockholders.\n\nNo Cumulative Voting; Special Meeting of Stockholders\n\nStockholders will not be permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Furthermore, special meetings of the Company’s stockholders may be called only by Chief Executive Officer, the Company’s President, the Board, or a majority of the Company’s stockholders.\n\nExclusive Forum Selection\n\nThe Company’s Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject to limited exceptions, that derivative actions brought in the Company’s name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder’s counsel in any action brought to enforce the exclusive forum provision. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of the Company’s capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision provides that the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware will have concurrent jurisdiction over any action arising under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent the exclusive forum provision restricts the courts in which the Company’s stockholders may bring claims arising under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision. Investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\nAlthough the Company believes this provision benefits the Company by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this provision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is enforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against the Company’s directors and officers and increasing the cost to stockholders of bringing such lawsuits.\n\nListing of the Common Stock\n\nThe Company’s common stock is approved for trading on the Nasdaq Global Mar"
