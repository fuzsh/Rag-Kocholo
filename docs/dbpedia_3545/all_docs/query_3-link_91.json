        "text": "Not so long ago, in 2018, when Siolim became my new postal address, the village did not possess any delivery flex—not for groceries or provisions from the corner shop, nor for takeout dinners you often crave with Netflix, not even for the daily newspaper you take for granted every morning.\n\nBack then, Thalassa had not uprooted from its original location, and the pandemic had not driven worn-out city dwellers to warm up to the village’s rolling field view.\n\nThe Siolim that restaurateur Rohit Khattar, founder and chairman of EHV International and Old World Hospitality—he runs Indian Accent in Delhi and New York, Comorin in Gurgaon and most recently, Koloman in New York— has inherited is not quite the same. It’s now a buzzing pincode, burgeoning with new residents, who find its proximity to Assagao’s runup of restaurants as attractive as its accessibility to the beaches of north Goa.\n\nOn the narrow lane in Vady, Khattar’s Hosa, which means ‘new’ in Kannada, is one of the first restaurants that greets you with its powder blue façade. From the outside, Hosa looks like a well-maintained Goan Portuguese house, but step in and a dazzling 14ft bar (featuring over a hundred bottled reasons that will attract status-conscious barflies) is just the starting point of a sleekly-designed, modern space that peels room-after-room to accommodate 100 diners among the company of some art greats.\n\nInside Hosa, Goa\n\nKhattar’s sister, Rohini Kapur, who is the design director at his hospitality group, collaborated with architect Ashley Mascarenhas to restore the space–previously a boutique hotel–beyond its former glory. Handcrafted tiles in graphic patterns on the floor, warm wooden furnishing around and unobtrusive art on the walls (currently on display are 35 stunning artworks by South Indian artists–from Laxma Goud to Ravinder Reddy– from Chennai’s reputed Apparao Galleries) makes the restaurant experience feel like being entertained in the home of a wealthy, tasteful host. Outside, a small al fresco seating overlooks the Chapora river, where locals jovially pile up every year to witness a boat parade during São João. “When I decided to open a restaurant in Goa, I knew it wasn’t going to be a place for Comorin or Indian Accent,” confirms the reticent Khattar, whose reputation as a restaurant moghul is not as well-known as his eateries.\n\nIf Khattar means that Hosa is not the kind of place where young people would only go if their parents were paying, he’s right. But neither is it the kind of South Indian restaurant where you would dig, all hands in, into a wholesome plate of sambar vada. For one, there is no sambar-vada. “With the setting, interiors, service and of course the quality and presentation of the cuisine, we hope to elevate the stereotypical South Indian restaurant experience,” says Khattar, who was driven to explore the culinary diversity of the South beyond the familiar. Through its service, Hosa eschews the stiff rectitude that most fine dining spaces have made their signature. Instead, a casualness exudes from servers—clad in breezy, coconut-motif shirts—which permits light moments of banter between meals.\n\nWith chef Suresh DC— a Bangalore boy, who sharpened his knives at Bangkok’s coastal Indian restaurant, Jhol— as his kitchen mascot, Khattar found a perfect match to explore his foray into South Indian cuisine, without paying heed to its holy triumvirate of idli-vada-sambar.\n\nThe chef-restaurateur duo are not the first to think of this. Assagao, now the culinary centre of north Goa, first brought Malayali meal diversity to the sunny state when Delhi’s Gunpowder relocated here in 2013. Its meen curry and appams continue to attract throngs of tourists even today, though picture-perfect Tamil Table and coastal eatery Mahe, are now close contenders as places taking South Indian food beyond its standard perception.\n\nSouthern fare is seeing a renaissance not only in Goa. On MasterChef Australia, the 2018 winner Sashikumar Cheliah displayed his Tamil roots to find his way to the victory table. Most recently, Semma, a South Indian restaurant helmed by chef Vijay Kumar, received a Michelin star, becoming the only Indian restaurant in the US to boast of this accolade.\n\nSouthern stars\n\nIn chef Suresh’s hands, South Indian cuisine—with all its glorious scents and unique flavours—appears as an impeccable parade of artful arrangements. Sitting underneath a three-by-three photo grid of Chettinad homes by Sebastian Cortes in an elegant dining room, my lunch seems ceremonious. The first dish that renders my table silent is a small plate of curry leaf cured snapper, a carpaccio-styled dish that is poured with a flavoursome spiced kokum rasa, so soul-nourishing I could drink it in a bowl. The chef’s iteration of a simple curd rice dish is no less grand–called Almond 65, a cheeky take on Chicken 65, it comes dressed with almond fritters and pomelo.\n\nDishes and drinks at Hosa are a lot about cubes and foams, but even with all this fuss, the experience remains fun. “When I started my career 10 years ago, it was in a European kitchen, so I try to use those techniques to cook South Indian food,” says chef Suresh, who with Hosa’s menu, achieves the unthinkable. In just one page, and through 38 dishes, he packs in culinary feats from five states of the south—Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. There’s something to be said of the pleasures of encountering a short menu in this age of endless scrolls and choices. That his tight edit of dishes can help you sample Southern India’s vast and varied regional culinary traditions, while catering to finicky modern diners who come with highly specific diets and restrictions, is no short of a modern-day wonder.\n\nSuresh spent the better part of 2022 on the road, researching and eating food across homes in Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Karaikudi, Chettinad, Hyderabad and Godavari, and the prodigious chef now brings these techniques and flavours from his travels to his restaurant as delicious souvenirs.\n\nHis food may be complex, but the taste remains comfortable. Take the mutton pepper roast, served with garlic chips and taco-styled bun porottas or the tightly coiled coconut shrimp, which he manages to make artful in styling and as flavourful in taste as Kerala’s famed fish moilee. Desserts too are anything but staid. “South Indian desserts are a bit boring, but our menu has a whole new iteration of it. I wanted to change the look and feel of it,” says the chef, who hits the sweet spot with much fanfare when he brings his Mysore pak coffee cake and coconut and jasmine sorbet to our table. The subtle apparatus helping these dishes shine with sheer sensationalism comes from the elegant serveware that the chef commissioned to Ahmedabad-based pottery studio, The Burrow.\n\nRaising the bar\n\nMixologist Varun Sharma doesn’t share the chef’s love for brevity. The enthusiastic beverage manager, who leads the bar programme at the parent group’s award-winning Comorin, has also designed a killer bar program at Hosa, with a 20-page illustrated menu that spotlights cocktails by day and night. His bar table looks like a scientist’s lab where tinctures, infusions and housemade soda mixes are laid out like successful experiments. Like Suresh, he wields his mixology with nuanced artistry, taking no shortcuts– take for instance the rum kokum cola made with a deliciously fizzy housemade concoction.\n\nHosa’s offerings are all uplifted versions of familiar tastes. And Sharma, like his chef counterpart, doesn’t even leave the humble beer alone. His refreshing take on shandy is the sandy shack, an on-table contraption that mixes pale ale with flavours of grapefruit and lemonade on tap. His cocktails too display the restaurant’s playful approach to the cuisine (bourbon infused with popcorn and Indian sarsaparilla, anyone?). My favourite was the gin fizz powder, a mango-infused gin cocktail where the rim comes dusted with gunpowder mix.\n\nKeeping up with sober GenZers, who have birthed the zero alcohol industry, the drinks menu has a dedicated section featuring health-conscious beverages like Gin-ish and Sober Rum that contain no sugar or alcohol.\n\nMy visit, a week before the restaurant officially opens, sees Khattar, a genial host, preside over our table, critiquing and cheerleading his servers, like a headmaster overseeing his students. His decades of success in hospitality is evident in the minutiae of events, but also on display are his perfectionist ideals. He picks up after a server drops a sliver of oil. He analyses each bite through our lunch–the chilli dish is “too spicy”, the Rooh Afza-tinged sharbat “too sour”, and the playlist “too stereotypical”–notes to make before his grand opening.\n\nKhattar’s famed food affiliations would make Hosa a buzzy new destination anywhere in the world, but in Siolim, it offers its residents the first address to dress up for a plush dining experience. With skyrocketing rents, unplanned constructions and now a nexus of food apps wooing its hungry residents, the village isn’t what it used to be. But unchanged are the rhythms of village life, like my daily newspaper run to the church–an opportunity to feed the vicinity strays, gawk at newer construction and catch up on village news. Hosa, this week, is sure to be the talking point.\n\nHosa opens on 25 November at House no.60/1, Near St. Anthony’s Church, Vaddy, Siolim, Goa. Open only for dinner until 28 November, post which it will be open all days, noon-midnight. A meal for two with cocktails is approximately Rs 4,000."
