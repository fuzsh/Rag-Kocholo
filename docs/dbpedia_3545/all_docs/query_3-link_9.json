        "text": "Next Article\n\nTHERE is an unwritten law in journalism that you do not denigrate the aged, the sick, or the mentally and physically afflicted. This same gene is part of the Goan DNA and from a very early age children are taught this. Even more emphatically, children are taught to respect their elders and often called the elderly ‘uncle’ or ‘auntie’.\n\nThis is common throughout the world among close communities. In Australia, the aborigines practise it with a gusto that is refreshing. In choosing to perpetrate a mindless insult by another so-called writer, I do it with both disappointment and shame that a fellow Goan should stoop so low. Who the heck gives anyone the right to disdainfully call someone a ‘dodderer’ without good reason? Why is it that the pipsqueaks of this world cause hurt by doing or saying or writing, in this case the dumbest of things? Or was it really a silly, fruitless exercise in riling the meek?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou have to be a contemporary of the dodderer to appreciate that he was once a warrior, a pioneer who was forced out of the comfort of his family home for nearly a century and transported to an alien country where he found no welcome but racist abuse and taunts. Worse, he was called a Paki while skinheads and White supremacists bashed him. He was for a long time a ‘Black bastard’ at work or in the streets of England. Whatever the pain and the suffering, the dodderer persevered ‘for the sake of the children’. Some could not take it and packed their bags\n\nfor Goa, only to return a short time later. Being blessed with a good command and an excellent accent in English, the dodderer found it fairly easy to slip into mainstream English life both in the private sector and the public service. It was not long before the dodderers were commanding high salaries and high positions. It was also not long before the Poms were able to discern between the different brown skinned citizens. In Parliament, the dodderer and his tribe were recognised for their former colonial service, their quality of service, their loyalty to their colonial masters and, if not welcomed with open arms, they were accepted with hands across mouths and eyes.\n\nThe weather, unfortunately, was hard to handle. Having been born in a heavenly temperate climate, Britain’s frozen winters were totally alien, especially for the older folk, soon to be called the dodderers. But they even overcame that, though never completely. There was some respite during the many visits to Goa where the dodderers absolutely celebrated the sunshine and revelled in their home-coming. However, the Wimpy kids, the fish and chips generation, could not handle the pig toilets or the authentic curry dishes. The dodderers had to come to terms with that, too, and in the end sacrificed visits to Goa for the family’s sake.\n\nAlthough there were some Goans in the UK, their numbers were not such that Goan eateries had flourished. So, in the early days of Goan-African migration in 1968, Goan cuisine was rare and hard to come by. But it soon flourished as other brown-skinned entrepreneurs went about setting up spice shops, providing all the needed ingredients. It was also not long before families were supplementing their income by cooking food, especially Goan sausages, sorportel, samosas, pasties and a variety of other delights. It took some doing to achieve the flourishing Goan food industry which is lauded among the best of cuisines.\n\nPerhaps the dodderer’s greatest achievement is his children, who have blossomed into adulthood with university educations that once were thought to be beyond some Goans’ reach. Today, the sons and daughters of dodderers compete with the best globally in the sciences, cyberspace, academia, nuclear medicine, highly specialized surgery, engineering of the highest calibre, music and every other sphere of life.\n\nYoung Goans are among the most gifted people on Earth and many with Queen’s English and a variety of American and Canadian accents! These new Goans, however, are less Goan than the average Goan, not by intent but by automatic assimilation. For all intents and purposes, they are British, American, Canadian, Australian and European. They honour their fathers and mothers, give tradition a modicum of salutation but honour the ways of their birthright and the land of their birth. It is exactly the same in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. It is only natural evolution. A friend from Australia who had visited England recently remarked that ‘they sound like Poms, you can’t tell the difference’. Exactly, they are Poms and proud of it.\n\nSchoolmates, in another continent, carrying a lot of memories. Left to right – the author’s brother Johnny, Orlando Almeida, Anthony ‘Foxy’ D’Silva, Peter Lobo, the author, Ron Almeida, Alex Rebello, Ronnie Gunputrav.\n\nThe children of East African Roman Catholic Goans had that comical lilting Indian accent forced out by the colonial British government. They ordered that English was the only language to be spoken at home. No Indian or Goan vernaculars were allowed. There was a noble intent behind this would-be sinister edict. Some Goan kids were growing up as the butt of a thousand jokes as they directly translated English from Konkani. The results were hilarious just as they were in the case of Hindi, Punjabi and other languages of the sub-continent. Goans born\n\nafter 1940 (and some born before that) were the lucky beneficiaries of an English accent exclusive to East African Goans and they cherished it. In my own case, having been brainwashed somewhat by British and American movies and American detective and cowboy stories, I worked at giving full value to the letters L and R like the Scots but without the brogue. I developed a slight twang that pleased radio and television producers and has remained true despite the ravages of living in the UK. Sometimes I did sound more as if I spoke the Queen’s English, or if I was an English Midlander, depending on who I was with.\n\nIn Australia, I have developed tiny bits of strine (Aussie lingo) and I am quite proud of it. I loved being on stage and being the master of ceremonies came natural to me early and my clear diction was my calling card. My youngest son Carl has taken emcee-ing to much larger stages and audiences and to his own unique dimensions than I ever could have. I marvel at the accents the young people spout these days. You know whether a Goan comes from Liverpool, Manchester, Scotland, Ireland, or London by his or her accent. In some cases the brogue is thicker than mushroom soup. There are also those young adults who are now blessed with all the language gifts that make up the Queen’s English and, if spoken without life’s human foibles, it is delightful. The US kids are a credit to the different drawls from different parts of the US. The same can be said of Goans from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Asia.\n\nWherever they are, they pick up the accent because of the need to blend in and not stand out. It is a form of assimilation and no one has forced it on them; it is a subconscious thing. Only small minds from an ancient past will pick on accents as a negative. Accents should be celebrated in the same way the children of East African Goan dodderers celebrate academic and business success. Dodderers they may be, but they have gone through hell to give their children the best chances possible and the children have repaid the sacrifices of their parents by achieving outstanding results by any world standard. These super Goans may not be as Goan as their parents, or speak Konkani or love going to Goa. They may not even like Goan food or church anymore, but they are super human beings and now belong to the world. These\n\nare the new Goans.\n\nNairobi Goan Institute M.R.

Some East African Goans did not want to leave Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania or elsewhere in Eastern Africa. They were forced to leave and for many years a brutal hatred of things African festered in their hearts, especially the Goans from Uganda who were forced to leave under conditions reminiscent of the Nazi era. The Ugandan Goans lost virtually everything, some even their lives as Idi Amin’s soldiers sacked them from their beautiful country homes and careers. Most East African Goans slipped into mainstream English or UK life with relative ease, but they suffered all the pangs of racism that had once been reserved for the West Indians. Some Goans suffered injury from the Paki-bashing skinheads and the racist abuse powered by Enoch Powell and White supremacists. The East African Goan has endured many hardships, abuse and heartbreaks but has continued single-mindedly to make the sacrifices for the betterment\n\nof his children. The road to dodderer-hood is paved with a martyrdom of sorts.\n\nThe East African Goan dodderer deserves thanks and praise, not disdain or insults, for paving the way for other Goans to follow. Doddering I think, for most, begins at 65, or it could happen at much younger age for one reason or another. There is nothing elegant about growing old past 60 for many East African Goan dodderers. Their staple diet of fish curry and rice plus one or two vegetables, pork sorportel or chicken xacuti from the freezer, beef vindaloo, or lamb and potato curry has been replaced with fish grilled without salt and just a teaspoon of virgin olive oil, steamed peas, carrots, potatoes, beans, cauliflower, Chinese greens or a selection from god’s garden harvest. And yes, lentils and four or five beans, that’s where the farting comes from. Doctors tell me that the Goan coconut curries and alcohol, especially caju feni distilled from fermented cashew apples, was responsible for a higher than average incidence of diabetes among Goans and other Indians living along the Malabar Coast.\n\nThe rice and fish curry is still on the menu though in smaller portions and the basmati rice is low GI and cholesterol resistant to a small degree. There is also the no-salt smoked salmon with onions, tomato, lettuce, cucumber sandwich on 12-grain bread or the delightful canned salmon or tuna with onions, tomato, green coriander and chopped chilli sandwich. It worked great as a weight reducer for me. You are lactose intolerant after drinking milk for 68 years and you are seriously thinking about turning to soy-milk for the porridge. Why, you may ask? Well a dodderer has got to do what a dodderer has got to do. Got to get that cholesterol down, got to keep those sugar levels to a minimum! Do not drink single malt scotch anymore. Cannot remember what beer tasted like. Once you binged on 16-20 pints at the local. Soon you are a reformed social drinker who now only drinks 2.5 litres of water a day. You are in the lion’s den: your friends now have two beers where once they had three and four; one or two are forced to drink light beer and you sit there, the social alcoholic eunuch that you are and, like someone at a wake, you sip on that bottle of pure, unadulterated water. Your friends of 50 years don’t know what to think. Some may even admire\n\nyou for the willpower you show in being nonchalantly un-bothered by the alcohol around. Especially since you once enjoyed, but never abused, a love affair with single malt Scotch. Your friends around you swear they would not live another day without that medicinal social drink.\n\nYou no longer look the tall dark lady-killer you once were. Once you were a soccer, cricket, hockey, golf, table tennis, badminton, athletics warrior and now your fleet-of-foot prowess is but a distant memory, sometimes not even that. Mostly you did your best work at the card table or at the races. More recently, the US casinos were a delight. You grew up in the shadows of Goan hockey and athletics Olympians. You were among the gods of your sports scene. Once you rocked! You jived, waltzed and tangoed with the power and grace of a gold medal skater. Today, you opt for economy of movement and space: you stand in one spot with your partner and generate some movement from the hip down and in your mind’s eye you are at least making a very minor attempt to dance. No, the sweet bird of youth flew away many decades ago. Instead, you are 10-20 kilos lighter. Your skin is fairer and looks healthier (so you think). You will be 70 or 80 next month but you can jog a little on the treadmill at 4 kph, you are doing three minutes but aiming for six. You may be kidding yourself because shuffling your feet is not jogging. So, for the first time in your life, you are on the verge of becoming a gym junkie. Once you laughed at those old guys who spent hours walking laps around the football grounds at the Railway Institute in Nairobi.\n\nToday, you push yourself just that little bit. Hey, at least your knowledge of the current pop scene is improving from the video screens at the gym. Your life is at the mercy of the specialists and vampires (blood tests) at the local medical centre. You see your cardiologist, endocrinologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and ten other specialists every six months. Today, life is full of tests: blood tests, urine tests, X-rays, MRIs, ultrasounds, CT scans, ECGs, stress tests, etc. Your heart is home to a pacemaker and blood flows through your arteries thanks to stents. I had a stent while on holiday in Goa not so long ago. These days some dodderers get their kicks visiting the physiotherapist or the Chinese\n\nmassage parlour where manipulative fingers and machines ease the pain in the joints, the lower back, the upper back, the neck and the knees. Soon you will be looking to replace this or that. Imagine, you are in the market for spare parts surgery! And the funeral has become the dodderers’ social club. Church and the good deeds it offers form your new sanctuary. Here you find peace amongst acquaintances of different racial backgrounds. And there is always a village feast somewhere in England or a tiatr (Konkani play) to catch with friends from long ago.\n\nWhat the heck! No regrets. You accept that the damage has already been done and you only have yourself to blame. Loved it when you drank all that beer followed by a few shorts of scotch, every day! Worse, all those cigarettes you smoked such a long time ago. And that sorpotel, chicken skin-on xacuti, those wonderful vindaloos, prawn, crab curries, marinara chilly-fries, succulent pork curries, those extraordinary goat and lamb curries, pullao, heaps of basmati, butter chappatis, naans, yes you gave thanks and loved it all, especially those recipes for diabetes, those unforgettable Goan sweets. Now you dodderer, dodderer you, you put up your hands in resignation and say: “I’m happy to go when I am called, I have no regrets.”\n\nRegrets, you have a few. Being the last of your generation from East Africa where the umbilical connection with Goa was generally strong, you still dwell on some old-school hopes and aspirations. You accept that mixed marriage, even with Muslims and Hindus, is a matter of supply and demand. . . the children tell you it is only because of love. Once you might have killed or packed your daughter off to Goa or a nunnery, today you ask your friends: what to do? You find solace in ‘as long as they are healthy and happy’. You forget that this particular DNA gene was cut a long time ago, when the young people quit on religion. You say: I guess that is evolution.\n\nI am delighted to be a Goan of East African origin. There will always be something Kenyan running through my veins because I owe Kenya a debt of gratitude for giving me life, a career and the experience of many wonderful and magical moments. Similarly, my DNA can only be Goan thanks to my father and mother, even though I speak very little Konkani\n\nand that with an accent. I am comfortable with the Goan in me and the Goan in my friends and acquaintances. I am also comfortable with the Goan in my children, who are more Aussie than Goan or Pom or Kenyan. They have their parents’ DNA and nothing else Goan. They are cool with that.\n\nRGI Salus Cup winners. Seated from left: Robert Santiago, Jack Carvalho, Peter Pinto (vice president), Michale D’Souza (sports secretary), John D’Souza, Francis Fernandes. Standing include: Tony Pinto, Martin D’Souza, Eddie Rodrigues, Alex Fernandes (perhaps the greatest Goan player who played for Kenya), Eulogio Braganza, Greg Carvalho and John Fernandes.\n\nYou seek out old friends from the old country because you share a common East African gene: a lifetime of memories, shared events, sport, growing up, births, marriages, deaths, loss, achievements, nightmares, dreams, Goan food and a million other specks of life in an African paradise where we thought we were in heaven on earth. All this before the shanties invaded Eastleigh and went viral all over Nairobi, like the favelas in Rio.\n\nThe East African Goan, as the label suggests, is a breed apart. There are a million things that bind us together forever. We shared in the joys of birth, marriage, of growing up poor and not knowing it, propped up\n\nby hundreds of friends who were in the same boat. We shared what little we had, as did our parents. Those that had a bit to spare did it with discretion worthy of sainthood, mainly through fear of the evil eye. We saw our loved friends die and we buried them. Others we pulled out of car wrecks that had taken the lives of others. We went through the nightmare of recovery together and we all became victims of the aftermath. The memories of the lost loved ones bind us together forever. We shared broken hearts and dreams. We shook our heads at the heartbreakers and soon made up once the healing was done. We raised children and shared their First Holy Communions and Confirmations with our inner circle of friends and family. Tears of pride rolled down our cheeks and our friends were there to put an arm around us and turn the tears to smiles.\n\nOur parents saw us grow into adulthood and marry and continue the cycle of life. We share a love of God, the church, the school and the club. We chose our clubs according to the like-minded friends who were already members. So we joined the Railway Institute, the Goan Institute, the Goan Gymkhana and the Tailors Society reserved for trouk, Konkani speakers and fans of tiatr. It was not long before tailors’ children deserted their fathers’ club for the RI or GI, the Mombasa Institute, the Kampala Goan Institute and similar institutions. At these clubs we began our education in the social mores of life. We met girls and fell in and out of love.\n\nWe danced cheek-to-cheek, held hands momentarily and secretly. We tasted the first kiss that was no more than a fumble of lips, French kissing came much later with experience. We bought the girls Babycham, Wincarnis, gin and tonic, Bacardi and Coke, the lager shandy and a glass of wine, preferably Portuguese Mateus. With a girl in your arms, eyes closed, you kissed her lightly on the lips, cheeks and forehead and you sighed a gentle sigh of wonderment. We spoke to the parents of our girlfriends for the first time and, if we were lucky, we had an adult conversation.\n\nSometimes we got invited to dinner. For the son of a tailor, this was a different lifestyle and, more often than not, you were intimidated by it. You feigned working late or some such honourable decision to turn\n\ndown the invitation. And if you wanted to take a girl out and were too afraid of the draconian parents, you asked a special kind of guy who could charm the old folks to ask on your behalf. But if the parents had a habit telling boys to ‘come back when you have your university degree’ you sometimes gave up the love of your life.\n\n1957 M.R.

Especially those who believed very firmly that the sons and daughters of carpenters, tailors, motor mechanics, clerks, accountants, public servants, should marry their own kind, as well as from the relevant North Goa– South Goa divide as well as the all-important financial or\n\neducation status. Children of the poor did not have to worry about that. Their education would be limited to secondary school for the boys and secretarial college for the girls and they were happy with that.\n\nAires and Josephine Fernandes. Aires was one of the best Goan snooker and billiards players in East Africa. Both were staunch supporters of the Nairobi Goan Institute.\n\nSome would argue that there was one club that was the home of the imagined Goan upper class, something that has been relegated to a sad past. The club provided us with all our heroes and role models and they were mostly superstar sports men and women, many of them current or past Olympians. We played tennis, badminton, hockey, cricket, soccer, table tennis, darts, snooker, billiards. We played sport hard, sometimes we drank hard, foolishly, and even more foolishly we fought amongst ourselves. We had fought the good fight and there would be another day, another challenge. We had learned some of life’s lessons with a black eye or two but we had also earned some mutual respect.\n\nWe also became members of the ‘club’ so that we could avail ourselves of the facilities for our weddings, whenever they would be.\n\nWe shared the pain and trauma of being denied work permits, in effect the ‘get out of Kenya’ kick. We held the painful farewells and drank a few Tuskers to drown our sorrows. Will we ever see each other again? That was the question of loved friends as they were dispersed to the four corners of the world and that is why we all come to London or Toronto to meet up with our soul-mates, blood brothers and sisters of sorts, but above all the unique Goan tribe from East Africa. Today we seek out old friends to find out how they are, how their folks are, any news from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania or Goa? Heard from anyone in Canada, US, Australia, New Zealand? We are of one tribe, bonded together through shared life experiences and in the twilight of our lives we hurt together just as much as we love and laugh together. More importantly, we cherish each moment shared.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, I meet every Friday with Tony Reg D’Souza, Loy D’Souza, Felix Nazareth, Cajie Miranda, Leslie and Andrew Scott, and Terry Pereira (Peter Cook’s (Railways) son). We are all from Eastleigh, except Felix who was a member of that other club I mentioned. Now we live within 10 minutes of each other. Mal Ferris (who is an adopted Goan, loves visiting Goa, Goan food a drop of feni of course) and his wife Margaret and Harold George D’Souza from Mombasa, who lives 40 minutes away, and a whole bunch of other East African Goans occasionally join us.\n\nWhat is even sweeter is that the young adult brood and their partners sometimes join the old men, bringing to the table fresh ears for our well-worn stories and jokes. My friends’ wives also join us from time to time. When he is in town, we are also joined by the mirth and merriment of Kenyan Drake Shikhule (who tells everyone that he is from the Goa village of Bastora) and his wife Jo-anne. We do this come what may, rain or shine. Absences are frowned upon. . . in jest. These dodderers have a great time although our drinking habits are on the wane. The ravages of a deliriously happy past seem to taking their toll. Some of us have cut down on our usual three pints of beer to a couple of light ones. Random breath testing is one reason; taking care of health busi-\n\nness is another. But there is no letting up on the sharp one-liners or the piercing, laughter-rendering retorts. The Friday Club is known the world over. Now (in 2016) only Terry works full-time.\n\nWe have nothing to apologise for. The Eastern African Goans gave much to their countries of adoption. Most important of all was religion and education. They saved their pennies and helped the Irish priests build churches and schools. In East Africa, these great institutions dotted many towns. Wherever there were a few Goans gathered then, Catholicism and Catholic school education flourished. This was the greatest contribution to the colonial countries, so much so that emerging Africans preferred the Catholic education system to the public government schools.\n\nGoans in post-independent Kenya\n\nWhat started in 1963 as a steady exit by Goans who felt that there was no place for them in an independent Kenya reached a crescendo with the exodus in 1968. Before that there had been a steady trickle of Goans returning home or families sending wives and children to the UK. The steady trickle continued to increase with the introduction of the work permits, the Africanisation of the police and the so-called Kenyanisation policy which was introduced to force Asians to become Kenyan citizens. In 1968, thousands left Kenya.\n\nAfter 1968, some families sent their wives and children overseas for safety and hung around until it was also their turn to leave. After 1975, the once mighty Railway Goan Institute shut down for lack of patrons. The Goan Institute and the Goan Gymkhana, once the exclusive realm of middle class Goans (GI) and Brahmins (GG), was home to ghosts of the past and any non-Goan who wanted to join the club. Caste, class, village, colour, religion or position did not matter anymore. Although most clubs opened their doors soon after independence in 1963, there were few takers.\n\nI was a young parliamentary reporter and had the privilege of watching Fitz carry out his Deputy Speaker’s duties. He was always icecool and precise, with an uncanny mastery over parliamentary standing orders. There were not many occasions when MPs argued with the\n\nquiet Goan. He had a great teacher, though, the wise Sir Humphrey Slade, the Speaker. I thought he represented the best in White folks and carried the unwritten banner on his forehead that not all White men were evil bastards. The sad thing was I cannot ever remember speaking to Fitz. I was the prisoner of other post-independence topics. In my own case, Kenya gave me a career that took me into the halls of power in many countries and showed me a world that I could not have even imagined. From leaving school at 13, to becoming Chief Reporter and an investigative reporter, my journey did not come easily. However, from the earliest times, as I came into close contact with men who would become the greatest power-brokers in Kenyan politics in 1960, I knew Kenya was not my country and there would be no permanent place for me even though I was born there. I would never enjoy the kind of editorial freedom I had tasted in Britain and other parts of Europe.\n\nMy two brothers chose to remain and people like Daniel arap Moi and Njoroge Mungai tried hard to change my mind. But while I was there, I did what a good journalist does: sought the truth. I must confess that I did not have the guts to report all that I had discovered. I could not remain in a country under constant threat of deportation or a bullet aimed at my head. I left in 1974.\n\nYet everyone, including Kenyatta and his cabinet ministers, thought I was a Kenyan citizen, to the extent that I went as part of official Kenyan delegations to various countries. Most African heads of state and their ministers recognised me as a Kenyan. I look back at the land of my birth with nothing but great fondness and even greater heartbreak as corruption and crime continues to fester close to its heart. I fear for its future. Perhaps there is one group of people who deserves Kenya’s collective applause: the Goans that remained. I am not sure that those who stayed after everyone else had left did it for reasons of commerce and business, or that they could not fathom living anywhere else, or because some of them were genuinely dedicated to the betterment of the country if not the people. Whatever the reason, the eternal survival instincts of the Goans have allowed them not only to prosper but also to become one with other Kenyans. Some mixed\n\nmarriages have signalled the infancy of assimilation. Some, if not all, of these very successful Goans have ensured their children left the country.\n\nYet one non-political power couple stands out: the multi-faceted Felix Pinto and his table tennis legend wife Jane Pinto had committed themselves to Kenya through a range of businesses as early as the late 1950s. He and his family have made an immense contribution to post-independence Kenya. Here are a few grains of Goan heritage who persevered in business, creating jobs, contributing to the education of young Kenyans and Kenyans with disabilities, creating opportunities for individual advancement, caring for the environment including the national parks and animal sanctuaries. They have managed to succeed, sometimes under frightening and challenging times, with the same quiet dignity and poise that was the hallmark of generations before them. I for one, of those who left ‘home’ for the safety of foreign shores, have always saluted you. You have always lit the flame of remembrance and protected the heritage of the good name Goans have enjoyed throughout the generations.\n\nThere is one footnote in history we must not forget: the architect Braz Menezes won the competition for the country’s independence decorations that transformed Nairobi in 1963. He was among the first Goans to become a citizen and start his own firm and he led the way in reforming the approach to low-income housing projects in slum areas. With his partner David Mutiso he transformed his firm into the largest truly Kenyan one. Their high point was being selected to design the United Nations Environment Program headquarters. The firm of Mutiso Menezes International still exists today at Westlands in Nairobi, even though the original partners have left the firm.\n\nAs always, in all our endeavours, good, bad, or ugly, the final salute must remain with the women, often the greatest heroines of the Goan home and the community collective. They were the foundation of the community as the homemakers of each family. I doubt there is a single family that does not owe its greatest debt to the mother. Where would our fathers have been without their wives’ fortitude, faith, strength of character and as empresses of their domain, although in those early\n\ndays the man was always the master of his domain. Mothers universally were God’s own wonderful creation. Even though, in those times, they walked in the shadows of the husbands.\n\nWhere, I wonder, would the cabinet ministers, permanent secretaries, heads of government and other senior marshals of government have been without their devoted, dedicated and utterly, utterly confidential Goan secretaries? These women were the real Goan heroines in the run up to Independence and were even more entrenched and silently powerful after Independence. Their bosses found them absolutely trustworthy, otherwise how could they have been entrusted with both national and private information, sometimes of the highest secrecy and of the most sensitive kind? Goan secretaries were no less head-hunted by the private sector and until their departure served with incredible success, so much so that when some of them migrated to Britain, the transition was often seamless. It was the wife who often found work first before the husband. Alongside the secretaries, I would add the teachers, nurses, midwives, radiographers, lab technicians, doctors and the many other professions women graced in a beautiful country.\n\nTeachers, both male and female, deserve their own pages in history. I have never stopped admiring them and that is perhaps one of the reasons why I loved school, especially English, so much. Goan teachers were among the jewels in the crown of Goan progress. However, after independence, they played a much more vital role in developing the hearts and minds of young Kenyans for future leadership roles. One of my good buddies, Tony Reg D’Souza, did exactly that. At the famous Mary Hill Catholic School in Nairobi, he taught young boys who would eventually be in the leadership of the country and titans of local industry. Many years later many of them still remember Tony, who now lives in Sydney, Australia where we meet every Friday for a beer, as mentioned earlier!\n\nAmong the men are those who manned the Customs and Excise departments in Mombasa and at various airports. These men in white protected the country with a diligence that is reserved for heroes. Here as well stand the Goan men and women who made sure the railways\n\nwere run to the highest efficiency: on time and with a First Class that was the envy of others in Africa. Goan chefs and stewards and waiters made sure the food was world class and the service memorable. Here again an army of Goans trained Africans to succeed in a seamless transition.\n\nMombasa, photo courtesy of CoastWeek.\n\nPerhaps the most flamboyant of the Goan professionals were the legal set. To this day they continue to do Goans proud. And before ready-made clothes arrived, Goan tailors were in high demand and had a reputation for excellence bar none. Most of them returned to Goa after independence. If nation building did not involve politics, the Kenyan Goans matched the other migrant tribes. Goans had successes as individuals in various fields with no part played by the general Goan community. On the other hand, other South Asian communities strongly supported and promoted individual excellence. Other closely-knit, even secretive, South Asian communities were probably the richest people in Africa. As a community, Goans excelled in the areas of religious needs, education, charity, sport and club activities. As individuals, they excelled in many other fields.\n\nGoan secretarial colleges were responsible for churning out Goan secretaries to the highest standards. I went to Goan-owned Premier College in the city to learn short-hand and touch-typing. Got the touch but lost the short-hand bit.\n\nDr Ribeiro Goan School in Nairobi and the Goan School in Mombasa were perhaps the truest epitaphs for Goan contribution to education in Kenya. It has been one of the great achievements of the community and there are thousands, albeit a vanishing breed, who will never forget it. There were also a couple of housing estates that were to the Goan credit.\n\nGoans and South Asians, especially the Indians who dominated spice and clothing bazaars, Indian shopkeepers who were to be found almost everywhere in Kenya, Indian builders and construction companies, Pakistanis, a few Sri Lankans, and others of a similar skin colour, were all painted with same brush: exploiters (blood suckers) of the poor Africans. Treated even worse were the shopkeepers in the remotest parts of Kenya, the dukawallahs. Asians constantly had the abuse of exploitation hurled at them to the point that it became a Black Kenyan mantra. Political opportunists repeated this in front of thousands of people at rallies for independence, regardless of whether it was true or not. There is no doubt that in the early years, Africans were treated somewhat badly as is the want of colonial Africa of that period: ‘they are not like us...’; ‘they are savages’; ‘their gods are witch doctors’ were some of the kinder sentiments expressed.\n\nHowever, there is one group of people that the Kenyan government owes a particularly huge debt of gratitude and these were the Goan civil servants. Whereas once their ancestors ruled the seas in the cabins, bars, dining rooms, as waiters, stewards and chefs, this vigilant band of Goans ruled the civil service, sometimes imperiously but always with loyalty, honesty, dignity and a steadfastness that was reminiscent of the last soldier standing in any historic conflict. Mervyn Maciel will, I am sure, pay great homage to his fellow clerks and civil servants. From early on, most of the ‘brown Portuguese’ employed as clerks by the British were called ‘Indian baboo clerks’ by some.\n\nVarious governors of Kenya including Sir Evelyn Baring had often\n\npointed to ‘their fine reputation for loyal service’ and to the fact that the most trusted member of the district staff was the senior Goan clerk. It was easy for the Goans to believe in this image and thus consider themselves not only a class above Asians but also as the ‘favourites’ of the colonial government. They were quite proud of their newly inherited ‘status’ and when they returned home to Goa they would emphasize the difference in their lifestyles, adopted from their contact with the Europeans and some would even speak in broken Swahili with each other. From Kenya’s dust, the country’s DNA had entered the Goan bloodstream, and for generations to come Goans would happily shout about their Kenyan connection. However, while they did not want to be called Indian or Portuguese, once they had migrated to the UK and parts overseas many were happy with the Portuguese label.\n\nAs the Goans waited with heavy hearts, sobbing and tears and trepidation for their future, they assisted in the training of Africans to do their jobs and thus facilitated the transfer of business from the Goans to the newly independent Africans. The few who took up Kenyan citizenship provided short-term longevity of experience in their jobs. They were the go-to experts for the new employees.\n\nEqually, Goans in the medical field did the same. Some doctors remained several years longer until there were suitable replacements. A similar trend followed in the private sector. In virtually every sphere of production, manufacture, agriculture and animal husbandry, Goans played a pivotal role in the early years of Kenya’s independence. In every sphere of life, except politics.\n\nIt was this devotion to their God that provided them with the faith and strength to be generous to a fault. There were some exceptions of course. As the final page was being written with the exodus of a majority of the Goans, it’s ironic that this might have been their finest hour when the sun went down on colonial Kenya.\n\nExodus with tears into the unknown\n\nWinston Churchill in a communication to the founders of the Nairobi Goan Institute stated, ‘The British Empire is big enough to shel-\n\nter the law abiding and peaceful Goan pioneer, a good citizen of Portugal, and to protect him in all his activities in British East Africa either as a Government employee or otherwise.’\n\nThe Goans who had to leave Kenya made the decision to remain Portuguese, British, Indian or nationals of another country. They rejected the option of a Kenyan citizenship. If they could not become ‘African’, they could not commit their lives and the lives of their children to an African country. They had to go. Some, like me, made up their minds very early that they would be moving on. I have already explained why I had to leave... in a hurry.\n\nHowever, even many of those who took up citizenship sent their children overseas. After the children had settled in foreign lands, their Kenyan citizen parents joined them. A few brave souls who would not have felt at home anywhere else continued to live out their days in their Kenyan paradise.\n\nTom Mboya, while speaking in the Kenya Legislative Council, sounded one of his many warnings to the Goans. ‘There are some Goans and Goan associations in this country. I respect the Goan community. I notice that some Goans and Goan associations went out of their way to declare their loyalty to Portugal.\n\n‘Indeed, there are Goans in this country who wish to be loyal to Portugal, then I say, you have no business being in Kenya. They cannot be loyal to Portugal as well as Kenya. Loyalty to Portugal means loyalty to the acts of that regime, means accepting what they are doing in Angola and Mozambique, particularly to their policies and system. If that is what the Goan community in this country wants to be, let them know from now on they will have no place in this country.\n\n‘They must declare their position publicly and clearly where they stand. We have many of them in our Civil Service, some in high positions and if their loyalty can be doubted they have no place in our civil service. They must ask categorically if they are loyal to Kenya or Portugal. That is my warning to the Goan community.’\n\nI think on July 21, 1961, also in Parliament, Fitz de Souza said, ‘Goans in this country are very clearly told if they do not support the Portuguese policies they would be deprived of their Portuguese pass-\n\nports.\n\n‘I want to assure the Goans in the country that the African people and the party I am associated with, the Kenya African National Union, are not the enemy. They fully realise the contributions the Goans have made and will continue to make in the future.\n\n‘Those Goans who are tools of the Portuguese administration, those Goans who are trying to compel their fellow brethren to support Portuguese obnoxious policies, those Goans will not be tolerated. And particularly where a Goan occupies a position in the civil service and claims loyalty to any government as barbaric as Portugal cannot be trusted in the service of this country.’\n\nIf you left Kenya, it was because of the choice you made, even though you were forced to make it. In 1963, Jomo Kenyatta urged all Asians to support the ruling KANU party. He said in a speech that he and M.A. Desai had ‘worked as brothers for the rights of the Asian and the African.’ Kenyatta said that he had sat with the great Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru and had planned the future of their respective countries. Kenyatta said that he hoped that Asians would join in building a Kenya in which Africans and Asians ‘live together, work together and plan together’. He said his government would ‘protect their businesses’ and ‘they had nothing to fear.’ There was a strong belief among Asians that those Asians who did not support KANU would be evicted and deported. Kenyatta said anyone guilty of doing this would ‘be punished worse than under the British.’\n\nThe late legendary US Civil Rights activist and the first AfricanAmerican appointed Justice of the US Supreme Court, Thurgood Marshall, was invited by Jomo Kenyatta to the Lancaster House Constitutional Conference to assist with the writing of independent Kenya’s first Constitution. Marshall was very keen on equal rights for both the Asians and Europeans in an independent Kenya. To that end he incorporated a bill of rights in the Constitution. In July 1963, he visited Nairobi to see how his bill of rights was being exercised. Below is an authorised and generous excerpt from Mary L. Dudziak’s fascinating book: Exporting American Dreams: Thurgood Marshall’s African Journey (OUP USA, 2008):\n\n‘At the end of their first day in Kenya, Marshall and Berl Bernhard (Marshall’s travelling companion, the US Civil Rights staff director) attended a reception and dinner in their honour at the home of Tom Mboya, who now held a cabinet post in the new government. Marshall fulfilled his promise to the Indian shop-owner. (Earlier in the day in Nairobi, the two men had seen a sign in a shop window: “Forced to close”. The Indian owner told them he was being boycotted. Marshall told the shopkeeper he would raise the matter with the Prime Minister that night.)\n\n‘Bernhard recalled, “About halfway through the cocktail hour, Thurgood got a hold of Kenyatta and said: ‘Jomo what the hell are you doing’ and I thought, my god... and he said: ‘I spent all my time busting tail in that wet place in London writing a Constitution for you with a bill of rights. And you don’t go around taking people’s property without due process of law. And I’ve only been here one afternoon, what is the first thing I see. (Sic) You’re beginning to make it impossible for Indians and Pakistanis to stay in Kenya and operate their business. What are you going to do about it?’\n\n‘Bernhard described Kenyatta as a very impressive man, “very cool, very elderly.” Kenyatta told Marshall they were looking into it. Marshall was not mollified. “No it’s not ‘looking into’,” he replied. “It’s doing something about it.”\n\n‘He called Mboya over and said to him, “Your responsibility is to see that despite what the Prime Minister wants to happen, that we are going to protect the property rights in the country.’\n\n‘Tom Mboya said, “Well we are going to do that, Judge, and...” Marshall cut in: “You’re not doing it.”’\n\nI am not sure if there was another occasion in history when someone stood up to Kenyatta on the issue of the Asians in Kenya. Several months later, however, Thurgood criticised Asians for not taking up citizenship. Asians feared that citizenship would not protect their jobs, their businesses or protect them against discrimination and deportation. That is exactly what happened.\n\nThe 1968 exodus to the UK was a heart-breaking episode in the lives of the Kenyan Goans. Many thought that the day would never come\n\nwhen they would be forced to leave Kenya. They thought: ‘We will serve the new government as well as we served the colonial government. If we leave, who is going to do the work? The country will collapse in a short time.’ It did not.\n\nNight after night they boarded aircraft bound for the UK. You could hear people crying and sobbing in the airport’s departure lounge. There was a lot of anger and abuse. There was a lot of fist-pumping in the air. In the end, they left with heavy hearts. It was heartbreaking watching the household employees sobbing uncontrollably as they said farewell to their former employers. They had little idea what was waiting for them at the other end. They knew they were not wanted. Advertisements by cities like Bradford, Leicester and others made it clear: ‘Don’t come. We don’t want you.’\n\nI went to Leicester, Birmingham and other parts of the British Midlands. I also visited Bradford. The message to the Asians in Kenya was the same: ‘We don’t want you.’ Leicester was a broken city after textile manufacturing crashed in the UK. The city and its suburban inhabitants were in the doldrums. Many did not know when they would find work again. Leicester already had a mostly out-of-work West Indian population which was fighting its own race relations battle. In 1968, the people of Leicestershire were very insular. Not many ventured outside the Shire boundaries and this had been so for generations. They did not have much idea of the world outside or the rainbow variety of nations. It was a standing joke that many local thought they needed a passport to get to London. And if you mentioned Wales or Scotland, they would ask, jokingly, what country is that?\n\nIt was not long ago that the late firebrand Member of Parliament and leading anti-Asian migration guru, Enoch Powell, was speaking of ‘Rivers of Blood’ that would be running all over the UK. There were no rivers of blood, but in those very early days Asians were attacked and beaten by skinheads, many of them devoted supporters of the gospel according to Enoch Powell and other White supremacists like the National Front. ‘Paki bashing’ became a new British pastime. All brown skins were called ‘Pakis’. They could not tell the difference. However, the Asians including the Goans did overcome. Ironically, Leicester,\n\nBirmingham, Bradford and many suburbs of Great London are prospering because of the South Asians. But in those early days it was particularly dark times for the new immigrants. Imagine a mother with three school-age children in the middle of the great metropolis. But help did come both from state institutions and kind Britons.\n\nWhile they continued to make a new life for themselves in their new country, Kenya lived in their blood. There were those who had put Kenya completely out of their minds and were never to return there. The majority, however, yearned for the old country and would return on holidays or they would be jumping for joy every time a Kenyan won a gold medal in the international and Olympic athletics. So much so that many still wear to this day those distinctive T-shirts with the logo of the Kenyan beer Tusker. It was once a favourite beer and thankfully is available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Kenya DNA was alive and well.\n\nMany years later, in 1974, I migrated to London then moved to Leicester. By then the racism had died down somewhat but there was no fraternizing. For example, I went to the Wyvern Arms pub every day for a whole year and a half before someone actually spoke to me. When the kid did it was difficult to understand the Shire accent. He asked and it sounded like: ‘jiyachuuk errars’. I told him I could not understand what he was saying. He lifted the darts in hands and gestured throwing them. What he said was: Do you chuck arrows? From that day I was an accepted member of the pub because I played darts, snooker and pool and became a representative member of the pub teams. I used to meet the pensioners every Sunday morning for a game of dominoes and we each bought a round. That friendship meant that I never had to buy any vegetables. Fresh greens were delivered to my doorstep free of charge. I never experienced any kind of racism during the four years we were there or the many times I visited the British Isles before. I guess I was lucky.\n\nThe vanishing Goan\n\nCurrently there are households where fish curry and rice are no\n\nlonger the exclusive meal on Friday nights. What is a Goan without his fish curry and rice, their staple diet for hundreds of years? In about 15 years that trait will completely disappear outside of Goa. Only migrants from Goa will persevere for a little while. In 30 or 40 years’ time, the Goan gene will probably have died out completely outside of Goa and with it interest in Goa will also continue to dissipate.\n\nIn 2015, only 25 per cent of the population in Goa was Roman Catholic. How soon will it take the Christian religion to disappear from Goa itself, since Catholic Goans continue to migrate to distant shores? Especially since thousands have availed themselves of Portuguese passports and continue to create new Goan ghettos in British suburbs.\n\nTragically, not many Goans in the diaspora speak their mother tongue Konkani. There is a real disconnect with real Goan culture. When I write of Goans I am referring to the 100-carat authentic Roman Catholic variety, 6 am or 7 am Mass with mum, of course, before work or school, Angelus at midday, Benediction in the evening, a rosary and all the litanies in the world while kneeling on a concrete or mud floor, confessionals on Saturday afternoon and the resultant three or four rosaries for all those evil thoughts of puberty, novenas for this and novenas for him or her, for souls you know and did not know, a Statue of Our Lady ... or Saint Anthony, St Joseph, St Francis Xavier or another, the procession from one home to the next and the endless prayers, a prayer to this saint, that saint, that other saint and, of course, my patron saint, your patron saint... always the prayer: deliver us from evil. You would think that living was a never-ending battle with Mr. Devil. Sadly or not, the devoted and the devotion are vanishing, especially outside of Goa. But they did leave us with good manners, godliness, goodliness, etiquette, decorum, honesty, loyalty, trust, a marriage for life (that is questionable as a good thing), a passion to succeed and give the children everything they did not have, a love of music and dance, an eye for the arts, dress and style and, of course, a cuisine so exclusive it could only happen in Goa.\n\nAs a journalist, I have always felt freed from all the taboos and prejudice of the Goan kind. I was fortunate enough to be born poor of a\n\ntailor family and the only way was up. The evolution of freedom was happening all around me. My Goan friends came from different castes and classes of the Goan landscape. Whether our parents liked it or not, we were unstoppable.\n\nThe Silent Generation and the one before it were infested with all the prejudices of separatism, class, caste, inter-tribalism, racism and prejudice by religion. Who in their right minds would put a daughter, sister, or niece through the kind of torment mothers once did, saying: ‘My God, My God, what have you done to us? What kind of devil has taken you away from us and Jesus?’ ( Tears, wailing, temple beating and chest thumping ensued). ‘What will people think, what will people say about us? That we did not bring you up properly? We took you to church every day! We were going to find you a nice Goan Catholic boy; you were not ready yet, no? A Muslim, a Muslim, a Muslim is a devil. He does not know God. You have disgraced your father, your family and the Goan name. How will I be able to show my face outside our home? How will I be able to go to church?’\n\nEnter the father, defender of our faith. ‘You are no longer a daughter of mine. You will not look at my face or talk to me. Wash her in holy water, rub some garlic on her and call Coutinho, he will know what to do, salt and chillies, whatever. Ask the priest to come and exorcise her. He will get the devil out of her. Say a few novenas, give a few Masses. Write to Goa; tell them to pray at our church. If everything fails, we will send her to Goa and the nunnery in our village. That will take the devil out of her. You stay with her for six months, we will manage here. Tie her to the bed and make sure she does not run away, she may kill herself. And they will blame us. Take her to the doctor tomorrow; make sure there is nothing growing inside of her. If there is, you know what to do. Do not talk to anyone else about it, especially not your brother or your sister. You know what big mouths they have. And we will not go to the club for a few weeks or at least not until we return from Goa. You know it is your fault. You were not a good mother otherwise this disaster would not have happened.’\n\nMeanwhile the victim would be thinking, what have I done that is so wrong? I am 14 years old. I love Sharif. This is my life you are de-\n\nstroying, my soul you are smashing and my heart you are crumbling. You are killing me! Please stop this pain! I am only in love! I am only in love! I may not marry him and I will commit no sin with him, so what is wrong? I have not even kissed him. We do not know how. God, what kind of God are you? Sharif just saved me from those horrible Goan boys who were teasing me. Is it sin to be nice to someone who is nice to you?\n\nThe boy’s father would respond, ‘I have spoken to Sharif and he tells me that nothing happened. He only walked her home from school. But I can see a young boy’s love in his eyes. It is the first awakening of manhood, nothing else. So we are sending him to a madrassa in Lahore. His brothers have convinced him he has to go. My wife is heartbroken. She does not know what she has done wrong. This country is difficult for our boys. Girls have their faces uncovered, almost naked at the shoulders and legs. These things are too much for a young boy. Yes, there is no point in taking chances.’\n\nThe girl’s father would reply, ‘Memsahib and I have decided to send Ellen to Goa and that should be the end of that. What can we do? They are children and we try to bring them up according to our gods. What else can we do? OK. Everything is good.’\n\nThe Goan caste system, too, is vanishing, at least in the diaspora. But slivers of prejudice remain which is the only reason some Canadian Goans saw the need for an organisation called ‘The Sons and Daughters of Tailors’. I expect, like the vanishing Goan, that it is a fad that will fade away. But it was not too long ago that mothers told their sons to keep away from a particular girl because her father and mother would not tolerate it because they were a different caste or in a different class. After all, he was only the son of a lowly shoemaker and she was the daughter of educated parents who were reasonably well-to-do. We cannot sit at the same table with them, she would tell him. For her to be with you would bring great shame and disgrace on their house and our\n\npeople will not like their high and mighty ways, especially when they will always be looking down on us. We, each of us, must stick to our own kind. Too many young Goans were driven to exile, to suicide or a life in living hell because of this kind of prejudice within. Fortunately, this Goan has almost completely vanished.\n\nFortunately, there is one Goan who is not vanishing: the recent migrants from Goa to Africa, the UK, Canada, US and elsewhere. A hard-working species, reminiscent of the original migrant somewhat but more committed to building new homes in Goa, supporting the people who remain behind and forging a beautiful future for their families. These are Goans of two continents; happy to be toiling away with the firm knowledge a retirement awaits them in Goa. I hope this Goan is around for many decades to come. This Goan has a lot of pride in his or her achievements and the security of a future in Goa and overseas.\n\nThere is another Goan Catholic emerging from the rubbish tip of prejudice. The African Goans, especially the East African clique, tend to hang together and are forced to mix, by the necessity of numbers, with Goans who have migrated directly from Goa, from other parts of India and Pakistan and from the Gulf countries. These intra-Goan prejudices fortunately break down when inter-marriage comes to the rescue.\n\nIn the bad old days, those piercing thorns of prejudice always seemed to surface with questions. ‘Where do your mother and father come from? What is your father’s profession? What does your mother do? Why, your father could not afford to keep her home? What is your village? Do you all have a house in Goa? What is your profession? How many degrees do you have? How much do you earn? What are your assets?’ They never ask, “Are you a practising Roman Catholic?’ Fortunately, this is also a vanishing Goan. It is vanishing even more when a different race is involved. These days none of these types of questions are raised.\n\nThe wonderful thing about today is that none of that nonsense is relevant, in as much as being or not being a Goan is relevant. The young Catholic Goan has no hang-ups whatsoever. They straight, gay, lesbian, trans-gender, atheists, no church, without religion of any kind,\n\netc etc, neither White nor Black nor Brown nor Yellow, colour is insignificant. Free at last, free at last. A friend married a Muslim boy. He is a gentle, doting soul and totally in love with her. He is everything that she dreamed of in a soul mate, a friend, a lover, the father of their children and her husband. Before she married, she had to convert. Her mother does not care, only her daughter’s happiness matters. His parents dote on the granddaughter but they had heavy hearts when he told them he was marrying a Roman Catholic infidel, shaitan (devil). Today, she is the daughter they wished for their son. No worries, no problems, love rules. I love ‘em both, love ‘em all.\n\nMore recently, one of my most favourite young people married an Aussie girl. I love this kid because he is a special kind of person. He is blessed with gentleness and an innocence that is bereft of anything ugly or untoward. He is one of life’s quiet achievers. Their wedding was a sensational day and night. Goans are blessed with a fine taste for beer and scotch and have a pretty good set of pins and hips on the dance floor. Besides health restrictions, we will eat most anything, just like White Anglo-Saxon Aussies. We made a whole bunch of new friends that day and celebrated a whole bunch of other lives. I saw a whole lot of Goan baggage go out a welcome window. That day, I felt that being Goan was irrelevant. That day, the Goan had vanished and it was a good thing too.\n\nThere are too many mothers and fathers and grandparents who might be turning in their graves for the way things have turned out today. In those beautiful, innocent old days, a fair-skinned damsel was a prized catch as much as a dark-skinned African, African-American or a Caribbean maiden is a hot catch now. Marrying a Muslim, a Hindu, a Punjabi or a Black man: they would have not have dreamt about it. It would have been a nightmare for a people who were taught that they were Portuguesa, not even Goan. Fortunately, that prejudice is well and truly dead and buried.\n\nEvery day is a beautiful time for the world, at least some of the world. It is particularly true for my part of the world, Australia. My country is blessed with having a few serious problems and lots of minor problems, mostly of man’s own making. It is indeed a land of op-\n\nportunity. Like everywhere else, integrity and honesty are at the mercy of those who make it their business to corrupt the world. But generally, Australia seems a country just as much at peace with itself as most places in the world. In most places of the world, you will find young Goans at peace with their lot. They are the new Turks on the block except they do not mix with boys in the hood. The hood is no place for them. These are the freest Goans anywhere. In fact, being Goan has very little meaning for them. They have shifted their world so many times that they are now in a different world where Goa and Goans do not exist. There is very little chance that their spouses will be Goan. They do not move in Goan circles and do not have the opportunity to meet potential Goan life-mates. Very few Goans anywhere in the world have second thoughts about their children marrying a non-Goan, especially people of White skin. Even the former taboos of not marrying Blacks (Africans, African-Americans and West Indians), Muslims, Sikhs, Punjabis, Indians in general, etc., are disappearing, at least outside of India.\n\nIt is in the lofty spheres of achievement that Goa and Goan become rather irrelevant and insignificant in the larger scheme of things. For one, very few of the old-fashioned Goan Catholics will come into contact with them, interact with them or become part of their scene. Konkani, Goa, etc., might as well be in another universe. This is also true of the other sub-species at a much lower level who have come to accept their surroundings, the culture, life as being their own and they see themselves as no different than anyone else in the street, the suburb or the city. They are only acting naturally, making themselves at home in an environment that is comfortable. More often than not, these new Goans will marry non-Goans and it is here that the vanishing really begins.\n\nAs you walk through the corridors of life in US, Canada, Europe, Australia and South America, where the assimilation (or, rather, where the intruding colonial population has replaced the indigenous population) is often complete, the dominant ethnicity is slowly losing its unique lustre. The spices of multi-ethnicities are diluting the single strains. In cruel times, they would have been referred to as a nation\n\nof half-castes. The Indian in the West Indies is less of an Indian and almost all Caribbean, with the Black American part being dominant. This is a classic example of assimilation. In Europe, however, the reverse is probably true. The African part of the West Indian is being dominated by the European. The result is, like in Brazil, fairer skinned half-castes. Often the golden glow of the skin is sensational.\n\nIndian half-castes, Anglo-Indians, migrated in great numbers to foreign shores where today there is very little Indian left in their genetic makeup. The bottom line is that the world’s ethnicity is changing. A Jew is no longer a Jew, he or she might be Jewish, but not an uncontaminated sample Jew. The same can be said for many White Anglo Saxons and those Whites in Europe, Canada and the US. Even the Ku Klux Klan patron saints are no longer totally White without a speck of Black. In reality, there is no such thing as a pure race. With Goa’s largest population located outside the Indian sub-continent, Goans are subject to all the changes affecting a shifting world.\n\nIt is the same for other sub-continentals. Not everybody can handle the mental trauma of an arranged marriage in India, and local overseas Indian girls are frowned on as not being the real thing. So mixed marriage through love, necessity of demand or necessity of sex is a natural trend.\n\nThis is why so many Indian surnames have Christian first and middle names. It is even more difficult to tell who really is a Goan when the issue of the marriage has a Smith, Jones or Brown for a surname. Sometimes this has been necessitated by the economies of availability: not enough Goan girls or boys. Some traditions, especially religion, have had to be sacrificed on the altar of marriage. Can any Goan of pre-baby boomer days imagine their daughter marrying a divorced White AngloSaxon in the Church of England, or some other non-Catholic branch of the Christian church, or a temple, gurdwara (Sikh religious shrine) or mosque? But it happens. After all the questions, what relevance does Goa have in the greater world? The new generation has to chart its own course. Enveloped by the myriad cultures in Britain and Europe, born Goans have taken to their adopted cultures like fish to water. There is little to no room for Goa. Within a few decades the slightest trace of the\n\nEast African Goan will have disappeared.\n\nRight now the changing of the guard is happening to the Silent Generation. They are dying out. They were the last guardians of the memories and traditions of an old Goa. The baby boomers will also be gone in 20 years or so. With them will go the last vestiges of the Goa that their parents and grandparents once knew. With Gen X and Gen Y and the generation after that, whole generations will be lost to Goa. Britain, Europe, US, Canada, Australia will replace what was once Goa. It will soon be a vanished population.\n\nThis is a mighty tsunami wiping away a whole country resident overseas and with it will go its history, its theatre and music, traditions and everything else. Perhaps, the only thing to survive will be a modern version of a few dishes from its traditional kitchen. That is all. Otherwise, the so-called real Goan will be a stuffed relic in a museum somewhere. Goans in Goa will finally realise that in the bigger scheme of things they are simply Indian. Of course, the vanishing is not restricted to Goans. It is a global thing.\n\nThe following is an editorial published in the Catholic Mirror (Nairobi, Kenya), in March 1968.\n\nGoan Catholics\n\nThe spotlight in recent weeks has been turned full on the exodus of many Asians from Kenya. Among those who have departed are a number of Goan families from Nairobi and other centres in the country. Their departure must necessarily remind us of the extraordinary contributions the Goans of Kenya have made to the Catholic Church and Catholic life in this country. They came here bringing with them a tradition of Catholic worship and family life, which stretched back more than four centuries to the great apostle of their homeland, St. Francis Xavier.\n\nThe Nairobi Cathedral Basilica, located around the City Square, seat of the Archdiocese. It had its humble beginnings as the tiny Holy Family Church, with a parochial school attached. Photo courtesy of Wikipedia.\n\nIn their own country – an area surrounded by nonChristian communities – they had developed that Christian tradition. It centred on a great devotion to the central act of worship of the Church, the Sacrifice of the Mass and the Blessed Eucharist. It found strength in their love of Mary, the Mother of God and St. Francis Xavier. The older generation passed on their faith to those who followed them and many a missionary in Kenya in the last\n\nhundred years has had reason to thank God for the example of Catholic life of this people. Their loyalty to their faith and their unhesitating generosity in the material support of the Church and its spread to others are too well known to need emphasis.\n\nOne need but mention a few of the monuments to this generosity: the Holy Family Basilica in Nairobi, St. Francis Xavier’s Church, the Boys’ and Girls’ Schools and the St. Teresa’s Church in Eastleigh, Parklands Church, Dr Ribeiro’s Goan School.\n\nThey were generous to a fault when it came to giving to God, whether that giving involved the sacrifice of their time and comfort in working for such societies as that of\n\nSt. Vincent de Paul or the Legion of Mary, or delving into their resources to build churches where God would be worshipped or schools where their children would receive a true Christian education.\n\nIt is only natural then that the Catholic community, comprising people of every race, should regret the necessity that makes many of these fellow Catholics leave us in Kenya. The Church will be poorer, spiritually and materially, for their going, but the countries to which they go will be the richer for their coming. Those who remain will, we know, continue the Goan tradition of loyalty to their faith. Those who are leaving will carry with them the thanks of their fellow Catholics and missionaries and the prayerful wish that all will go well for them in their new homes. To all, whether they go or stay, might be applied the words of Pope Pius XI regarding another small Catholic race, the Irish, whom persecution and economic necessity compelled to leave their homeland a hundred years ago: “Like God’s pure air, they are everywhere; and everywhere they are doing good.”\n\nWe lived a Utopian life in Kenya. Amid the Mau Mau fighting for their land and the resultant colonial atrocities against the Kikuyu and other Black people in Kenya, Asians lived a relatively peaceful life. There was some concern, but not enough to pack the wives and daughters off to the safe havens in India and Pakistan. The British and other settlers were in a terrible state of fear as the White farmers and their employees were in the gun sights of the Mau Mau. It was even worse for the ‘loyal’ Africans who were to die in the hundreds if not thousands at the hands of the Mau Mau as part of the latter’s fear campaign.\n\nGenerally speaking, brown skins and other similar foreign tribes did not involve themselves, because it was not their fight and because they were in awe of the colonial masters. Mainly, they had been conditioned to not even think for a moment of the plight of their fellow Kenyans. True, some did make something of an effort to show a little concern for their cooks, nannies, gardeners and other domestic staff. In some cases, Kikuyu employees were sent back to their home villages from the main towns and cities, even though this was a cruel blow.\n\nA few years before the fall of the Boer empire in South Africa, attempts were being made to formalise through legislation an evil system called ‘separate development’ or Apartheid. It was almost like an Aryan or Nazi conspiracy to keep all the different races in their respective ghettoes with the exception that the Whites would get the choicest bits. Fortunately, the attempt failed and with it so did the Apartheid system and White dominance. It is little known that the British successfully achieved the evil separate development system in Kenya: Africans lived in huts around their small farms, Asians, Goans and other nonWhites lived in their designated areas. The Whites lived in the best part of the towns and took over the best farmland. Growing up in Eastleigh I had a little interaction with the Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and one or two Arab, Gujaratis, Kutchies, Borana or Somali families. I had absolutely nothing to do with any White kids. They did not live in my world and they were not aware of my kind. Our fathers came into contact with the Whites as servants on a higher social rung than the Africans.\n\nGoans were given preferential treatment because they were not likely to upset the social applecart. The favoured treatment was really\n\nanother piece of the divide and rule strategy. The Goans were of course preoccupied with their God, their social clubs, sports and communityrelated charity works, including the building of schools where the community had congregated around a Catholic Church.\n\nOur parents tolerated other brown skins but only just. There was never any question of assimilation. They would rather celebrate death than marriage to a non-Catholic. Even marriage to a White person was frowned upon vehemently and put the family in complete community disgrace. There was not even the thought of marriage with the ‘savages’, the Africans. Some inter-marriage had taken place in the very earliest days at the coast, for lack of Goan females, and in the hinterland."
