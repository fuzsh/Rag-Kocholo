        "text": "New Geotechnical Journal Page: https://impactum-journals.uc.pt/geotecnia/index\n\nThe journal “Geotecnia” was published for the first time in June 1971. Its founder was Úlpio Nascimento and its first Editor was José Folque. Since that date it has been continuously published, with three issues per year, on average. Since March 2007 it has been published jointly by the Geotechnical Societies of Portugal and Brazil: SPG (Portuguese Geotechnical Society), ABMS (Brazilian Association of Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering) and ABGE (Brazilian Association of Engineering Geology).From January 2011 it was published by SPG and ABMS and, since June 2011 it is published by the Geotechnical Societies of Portugal, Brazil and Spain: SPG, ABMS and SEMSIG (Spanish Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering).\n\n“Geotecnia” is owned by the Portuguese Geotechnical Society (SPG) and is published jointly by SPG, ABMS (Brazilian Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering) and SEMSIG (Spanish Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering).\n\nIt has been published since 1971 and welcomes research papers, case-history papers, state-of-the-art papers, technical notes and discussions of previously published work, in all Geotechnical Engineering related domains – Soils Mechanics, Rock Mechanics, Geosynthetics, Environmental Geotechnics and Engineering Geology – in a wide interpretation of this field, with theoretical and/or practical contributions.\n\nPapers should be written in Portuguese or Spanish and are rigorously peer-reviewed, ensuring relevance, innovation and up-to-date information.\n\nEDITOR\n\n: António Gomes Correia, Universidade do Minho, Portugal\n\nASSOCIATE EDITORS:\n\nAlberto Sayão, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil;\n\nFernando Pardo de Santayana, Centro de Estudios y Experimentación de Obras Públicas, Madrid, España.\n\nEXECUTIVE BOARD:\n\nAna Cristina Sieira, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil;\n\nCésar Sagaseta, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, España;\n\nJosé Estaire, Centro de Estudios y Experimentación de Obras Públicas, Madrid, España;\n\nNuno Guerra, FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal;\n\nPaulo Cesar Maia, Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense, Campos dos Goytacazes, Brasil;\n\nPaulo Pinto, FCT, Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.\n\nPapers submitted to Revista Geotecnia can be classified as “Articles”, “Technical Notes” and “Discussions” of previously published material. Papers discussing case studies are welcome, particularly when involving original work with practical relevance for civil engineering. A “Technical Note” is a description of scientific-technical work whose degree of elaboration is not yet sufficiently advanced to be considered as an article. It should not exceed 10 pages.\n\nThe classification of each submission as well as the decision to publish is made by the Editorial Board. Each submission is analysed by at least three reviewers. The results of the review process are presented within one month.\n\nSubmission of papers to Revista Geotecnia is made at the web site http://www.revistageotecnia.com/.\n\nThis platform supports the communication between the Editorial Board, the Reviewers and the Authors throughout the review process.\n\nPaper submission should take into account the following points:\n\nPapers should be presented in Portuguese or Spanish and written in the third person.\n\nThe work should be sent in a computer file. A template for Microsoft Word is available. The title, name(s) of the author(s) and the body of the paper (including figures and tables) should be sent in a single file properly identified.\n\nThe title should not exceed 75 characters including spaces. It must be written in Portuguese or Spanish and in English.\n\nAfter the title should be indicated the names of the authors and in a footnote at most three references to their academic degrees or professional affiliations.\n\nThe article should start with an abstract in Portuguese or Spanish not exceeding 150 words, followed by its translation into English. After the abstract and its translation three keywords should be indicated that adequately characterize the paper content.\n\nIn principle papers should not exceed 30 pages.\n\nThe figures should be included in the paper file and in the proper sequence. The figures may be in colour but the authors must take into account that in the printed version they will be converted into black and white. Authors should verify that lines and symbols are legible in the printing format.\n\nEquation numbers should be right justified.\n\nAll symbols should in general comply with the list published in the “Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering” (Tokyo 1977) and with the list issued in March 1970 by the “Commission on Terminology, Symbols and Graphics Representation” of the International Society of Rock Mechanics.\n\nReferences in the text should comply with the Portuguese Standard NP-405 of 1996, indicating the name of the author (without initials) followed by the year of publication in parentheses [e.g.: Skempton and Henkel (1975) or Lupini et al. (1981)]. When there are several references to the same author and the same year use a), b), etc.\n\nThe paper should end with the reference list in alphabetical order of the surname of the first author, followed by the names of the other authors, the year of publication, the title of the book, editor and city (or a complete journal reference).\n\nDiscussions of published papers will be accepted up to six months after the publication date. Discussions will be sent to the author for reply. Discussion and Replies will be published together, as far as possible.\n\nThe title of the discussions and replies will be that of the paper with the additional indication “Discussion” or “Reply”. Followed by the name of the respective author in the format described in point 4 above.\n\nDiscussions and replies should follow the paper template.\n\nEnquiries should be addressed to:\n\nDireção da Revista Geotecnia\n\nSPG, a/c LNEC – Av. Brasil, 101, 1700-066 Lisboa, Portugal\n\nemail: editor@revistageotecnia.com"
