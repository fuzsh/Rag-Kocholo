Understanding Goa's vibrant Konkani\ntheatre\nAndré Rafael Fernandes, Ph.D\nPublished with financial support from the Tiatr Academy of\nGoa (TAG)\nISBN 978-93-80739-01-4\nPrice: Rs. 195 in India. Hardbound.\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\nCalled one of the most vibrant forms of modern Indian theatre, the tiatr strikes a deep chord with its audiences.\n\nWhat are its origins? How did it get its legacy of music and song? What role did the city of Bombay play in promoting the tiatr? Who pioneered this drama form? What challenges does it now face? These are some of the issues are tackled in this book.\n\nBased on a Ph.D. thesis, this work traces the growth of the tiatr (or tiatro) right from its diverse, sometimes overlooked, origins. It unearths references to the earliest Portuguese plays in Goa. It helps understand theatre in Goa, the region's culture history, and the role of diaspora communities in keeping the Konkani language vibrant.\n\nThe book contains some rare illustrations. For instance, the front cover illustration depicts a handbill for the 1904 performance of Batcara. List of characters confirms the early participation of women in the tiatr, at a time when this was not prevalent in other Indian theatre forms. Also on front cover, a handbill of Batcara, staged in 1915 for the Women's War Relief Fund in World War I days. Back cover shows a partial facsimile of a book by Pai Tiatrist João Agostinho Fernandes.\n\nThe printing costs of the book have been fully sponsored by the young Tiatr Academy of Goa, under its scheme to publish books related to the tiatr. It has been priced reasonably, to make it widely available and easily affordable.\n\nIt focuses on the origins of the tiatr, Goa's legacy of music and song, the beginnings of the Konkani tiatr, Pai Tiatrist, other tiatrists, challenges being faced by the tiatr today, new aspects of the tiatr, and an elaborate selected bibliography (of primary sources, books, newspapers, magazines, multimedia and websites).\n\nThough the book was initially written as a PhD thesis, its style is simple and down-to-earth, making it suitable for a wide range of readers.\n\nOne pathbreaking aspect of the book is as follows: The author has released this book under a Creative Commons 3.0, attribution, non-commercial license. What this means is that anyone can make copies of this work for non-commercial purposes, and share the same by way of photocopies or through digital copies on the Net.

In fact, this was the thesis written by Dr. Fernandes for his doctorate. For the TAG, it is a matter of pride that Dr. Fernandes obtained his Ph.D. on a subject -- the Goan tiatr -- which is the most popular dramatic form of Goa. The Goan tiatr has progressed in all aspects during the last 118 years. Year after year, its popularity too has reached greater heights. Yet, upto now, there has been no authentic documentation on the tiatr. This vacuum is being filled with the publication of this book. -- Tomazinho Cardozo, President, Tiatr Academy of Goa.\n\nABOUT THE TIATR\n\nDown the decades, hundreds of tiatrists have kept audiences enthralled for thousands of performances in Goa, Bombay (Mumbai) and elsewhere. Just one figure that gives you a hint of how popular this form of the Konkani stage is: on any given weekend during the theatrical season, at least ten shows are held in various parts of Goa.\n\nTiatrs incidentally entertain not just local audiences, but in recent times also perform for the benefit of Goan emigrants elsewhere in India, the Middle East, London and Toronto.\n\nFor some time now, the general impression has been that this dramatic form began in 1892 in Bombay.
