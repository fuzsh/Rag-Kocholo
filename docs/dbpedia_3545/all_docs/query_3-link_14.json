        "text": "By Karan A. Korgaonker.\n\nGoa; the holiday destination of many college students who make plans to visit the state but never see those plans come to fruition. Now this isn’t anything new, nor is it exclusive only to Indians. In fact, Goa has had such an alluring presence that it took the Portuguese 451 years to leave, and even that was only because 45,000 Indian tourists decided to cross the border. But what did the people of Goa think of the sudden change of government? What does the current population think? What about the rest of India, and indeed the world? What was the effect of Portuguese rule in Goa?\n\nDisclaimer: I cannot say for certain that the views below will be the same for all members of the state. However, this is what I have found from my own experience.\n\nMy grandmother would, whenever I met her, often talk about how she went to sleep one day with the Portuguese flag over her head, and woke up the next with the Indian one. She often spoke of the Portuguese times with fond memories, and it was these recollections that eventually shaped my own thoughts on the Portuguese occupation of Goa. The memories were far from the truth of course, but I only learnt of this when I began my journey into the history of Goa.\n\nAs it was, my grandmother remembered the Portuguese times almost akin to a utopia. There was no crime, and everyone enjoyed equal opportunity and rights. There was freedom of speech, expression, religion, and the entire liberal agenda was all part of the ‘unique’ Goan Civil Code. Everyone spoke languages you could understand (this will be a major point further along this article), be it Portuguese or Konkani. Prices were low, there was no poverty, and government processes were hassle-free, with no bureaucratic waste of time. A great time to be alive and a marvellous place to live in, Portuguese Goa truly was heaven on earth.\n\nOf course, when we look at the above paragraph, we can immediately see that not all of what my grandmother recounts is true. Were it so, then there would not have been any Goa Freedom movement, no rejoicing in the streets as the Indian Army marched into the state almost unopposed. Whenever I brought this up in conversation, I would always be either ignored or shooed away, or simply told that I was reading Indian propaganda written by Hindus. So why does my grandmother remember Portuguese Goa so differently from what it actually was? At first I put it down to an old woman’s failing memory; but no mind, no matter the dilapidation, would concoct memories out of thin air. Thus the utopic memories must have been grounded in some truth, and this truth was simple – nostalgia had clouded my grandmother’s memories.\n\nMy grandmother was in her early 20s when the Portuguese left Goa, thus her own memories were formulated in part by those of her own parents, and also the hardships she herself would subsequently go through in the new Goa, ruled by India. These hardships were mostly related to employment, as with the new government, new laws for employment appeared. Moreover, since Goa was now part of a much larger landmass with a quite porous border, immigrants were another issue.\n\nWhich neatly brings me to the next question, how do many Goans see Goa now? A large number of them have the view that there are fewer Goans in Goa than ever before. And who is a Goan? Someone who can speak Konkani is often immediately viewed with friendliness; take for example the simple taxi ride (which is run akin to a mafia by the way, woe to you if you want to use Uber) from the airport to, say, Vasco, a distance of some 4 kilometres or about 12 minutes. Were you to approach a post-paid taxi driver speaking in Konkani, the fare would be about 200 Rupees (a bargain), were you to speak in Hindi, 400 Rupees (a steal), and if you spoke in English, a mere 1200 Rupees (The Art of The Deal). Speaking in Konkani instantly puts a smile on the face of a Goan even far away from Goa. Take the example of George, the famous block gyp, to whom I spoke one word of Konkani and was immediately barraged by more Konkani than I had ever heard of in my life.\n\nI have often overheard conversations on the bus, or while just aimlessly walking around Vasco ‘cause I got lost (the city is confusing, don’t judge me) where the persons involved would often discuss how the state has gone downhill. The problem that they almost always attribute to this is the immigration. It’s not even the ‘They take our jobs’ argument, but more of the ‘They don’t speak our language, we don’t understand them.’ Language has always been an integral part of Goan identity; indeed, when in 1981 a vote was called on whether Goa should be given the status of a state or incorporated into one of its neighbours, language played a key role for statehood. Language plays a role in Goan politics as well. The medium of instruction has always been a hot topic, and a favourite for MLAs to bring up during elections.\n\nGoa, of course, can’t be free from languages other than Konkani, since it is tourist destination and there are a ton of other Indian language speakers visiting the state every year. Globalisation, along with the choice to study between Portuguese, French, Konkani, and Marathi in the 8th standard in the Goa board syllabus keeps alive the bilingual tradition that used to prevail in Portuguese India (many Goans – and in fact Indians – are multi lingual!)\n\nWhen India invaded Goa, countries such as the UK, USA, the Netherlands, Brazil and Pakistan (no surprise here) did not agree with India’s actions, while other countries such as the USSR, the United Arab Republic (modern Egypt and Syria), Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, Liberia, Mozambique, and even Ceylon supported them. Most of the support came from countries that were themselves once colonies of European powers, or considered themselves to be allies towards India. China while in an official statement seemed to support India’s claim on Goa, in newspaper publications ridiculed the annexation.\n\nThe Portuguese influence on Goa is very noticeable. The distinct architecture, the folk songs and dance, the musical tradition in general, the traditional attire, the cuisine, and the nature of the people as happy-go-lucky are very clear representations of a mixture of cultures. Due to the active proselytising nature of the Portuguese, a large percentage of Goans are Christian, and most of the famous tourist destinations are churches. Many place names are very Portuguese in origin, and pronunciation. As a rule, the last ‘m’ in most place names isn’t pronounced. Intermarriage between religions was not promoted but it was not looked down upon either, except in very extreme cases. Most of the exotic surnames of the Goans were adopted by those who were converted to Christianity, by taking the surnames of their convertors. And while the Portuguese times weren’t exactly the most utopic of eras of Goan history, it was definitely a very unique period for the state, one which has shaped its culture, as well as its view in contemporary media as a fun-loving state where everyone is jolly, no activists mysteriously disappear, where there are no education and employment issues, and no brain drain."
