        "text": "Goa is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India, among Indians as well as foreigners. And this is not only because of the lovely beaches that the state has to flaunt, but also coz of the number of festivals that are hosted here. Be it cultural celebrations or music festivals, Goa has it all, in abundance. The festivals celebrated in Goa are an amalgamation of several cultures. The fairs and festivals give you yet another reason to visit this stunning coastal state. Here’s a list of popular festivals held in Goa, which exhibit colourful and fascinating parades or EDM, and of course, Goa’s rich culture!\n\nFeast of the three kings\n\nWhen: Celebrated on January 6\n\nFeast of the three kings or the Epiphany is one of the most popular festivals in Goa. It is celebrated on January 6 every year in the village of Cansaulim and Chandor in South Goa and the village in Verem in North Goa. Christians as well as non Christians celebrate this festival with great fervour. The feast is held at the Our Lady of Remedies chapel or chapel of Nossa Senhora dos Remedios located at Cuelim.\n\nTo declare the start of the festivity, trumpets and the kettledrums are played early morning. The otherwise sleepy villages buzz with activity and come to life. The celebration continues for nine days with a lot of dancing and music. On these nine days of celebration, people visit the Our Lady of Remedies chapel located on top of a hill in Qualim, Salcete. Although an excellent road has been arranged, people still prefer walking up the steep hill to attend the Mass held in this chapel and to recite the Rosary. The beautiful statue of Mother Mary is decorated with jewellery by Hindus and Christians alike on the day of the feast. Many offerings are made to thank Mother Mary for fulfilling their wishes. During these nine days, the chapel resonates with songs by church choir.\n\nOn the last day, i.e. on the day of the Feast of the Magi on January 6, three boys from Arossim, Cansaulim and Cuelim are selected to dress up as Three Kings. These kids carry gifts—frankincense, myrrh and gold—for the infant Jesus, just like the Kings. The boys travel towards the chapel on horseback and with a band. Dressed as Kings, the boys reach the chapel to offer their gifts. The procession is led by little children playing kettledrum and trumpet. The three kids dressed as Kings and the whole procession celebrates the three Kings’ journey to see baby Jesus.\n\nThe feast is followed by a fair. An extensive fair is held near the chapel. Complete with fun rides and makeshift shops selling everything from clothes to toys to trinkets, the fair is a must visit. One of the most peculiar things about the Feast of the three kings is that as soon as the festivities are over the buntings and flags are removed and the crowd goes home immediately. By midday, you will not find anyone around the chapel. The remains closed until the next feast as no priest reside in it. The reason behind this is that the place is believed to be haunted by Maratha King Shivaji and his troops.\n\nAbout the chapel: Perched on a hill in Qualim, Salcete, Our Lady of Remedies chapel is famous for its miracles. The chapel has a beautiful statue of Mother Mary carrying a vase in one hand and baby Jesus in the other. The Lady of Mount is known as the protector of the people. People worship her as the fertility goddess. She is famous for fulfilling wishes of the devotees. According to few historians, the site on which the chapel is situates was earlier the site of a Hindu temple.\n\nGoa Carnival (Carnaval – Portuguese)\n\nWhen: During late February or first two weeks of March\n\nCelebrated in the month of February, Goa Carnival or Carnaval is the most colourful and fun filled event in the state. The carnival is celebrated for four days and this is the time when you see Goa at the peak of its festivities. It is like an extravaganza of colour, fun frolic and music. Each town hosts colourful parades of floats. Along with floats the masked revellers dressed in beautiful costumes, make their way through the streets of Goa singing and dancing in rhythm. The huge parades with lively dancers, bands and floats are a sight to behold. Grand dance balls are arranged throughout the night. The festival comes to an end with the popular Red and Black dance, which is organised on the last day of the festival in Panaji.\n\nThe festival offers you an opportunity to experience Goa’s unique culture. Some believe the festival to be a relic of ancient pagan rituals to pay respect to the gods of nature and fertility, but others see the festival as the beginning of spring season and the end of winter. The festival, which usually falls in late February or the starting two weeks of March, begins on the Saturday just before Ash Wednesday. The first parade is organised in Panaji. During the festival, people eat, drink and enjoy.\n\nGoa Carnival is associated with the King Momo, the mock king who presides over the celebration and orders his subject to enjoy. Dressed in colourful attires, King Momo and his entourage also participate in the parade. As the king passes by the crowd shouts ‘Viva Carnaval!’ Over the years, the festival has evolved and now there are different types of floats like the funky float and the traditional one. Attractive prizes are given for the best float for each category.\n\nShigmotsav/Gulalotsav Festival\n\nWhen: March\n\nShigmotsav or Shigmo or Gulalotsav is a 14-day-long spring festival celebrated in Goa in March. It is the biggest spring festival celebrated by the Hindus and is a fusion of carnival and Holi. The festival is celebrated in the Hindu month of Phalguna on the full moon day. Shigmotsav is Goa’s answer to the festival of colours, Holi.\n\nThe celebration begins by offering prayers to the god and goddess of the village. During this festival, elaborate floats are prepared and parades with street dancers and traditional folk songs are organised.

The temple of goddess Lairai is decorated with lights and several rituals and poojas are conducted. Devotees from all over the state visit the temple to pay their respect. The festival is also known for the ‘fire walking’. People throng to this place to witness this unusual ritual.\n\nLairai Jatra was once a six-day long celebration and now it has reduced to just a single day. The celebration begins early morning with performing rituals. Most of the devotees wear a different type of dhoti and flower garlands. They also carry a stick, which they make using twisted twigs. The stick is decorated with colored yarn. Devotees dance inside the temple of Lairai carrying the stick. The dance is performed in a circle and this continues until midnight. Around midnight, the dance ritual inside the temple concludes with a person lighting a bonfire close to the temple. The devotees form a circle around the bonfire and once again start dancing.\n\nDuring the early morning, when the fire dies out and coal starts to form, some devotees run across the hot coal holding the stick and chanting the name of goddess Lairai. Tourists and devotees visit this temple during Lairai festival to witness this ritual.

Initially, the village in Divar Island had three communities, namely Piedade, Sao Matias and Goathias. The people of Piedade and Matias were involved in frequent fights over property. Often, these disputes ended in violence or bloody duels. In order to solve this matter, the Portuguese introduced a system of demarcation of the boundaries with the use of flags. However, the flags were knocked down with a stone by the rival groups. In the memory of this practice, the people of the island used to take part in mock fights during Bonderam festival. Fotash, a toy weapon made of a bamboo stem, was used by the people to knock down the rival group’s flag. Peppercorn or berries were used as missiles. This practice is no longer followed due to eye injuries caused during a mock fight. Fotash, the toy weapon, is displayed during the parade.\n\nFestival: The preparation for the festival starts at the crack of the dawn with music floating through the streets of the village. The celebration starts at noon with a Flag parade from Divar Island’s main junction.
