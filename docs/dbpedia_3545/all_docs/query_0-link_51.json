        "text": "1. Abstract This paper discusses the necessity and opportunities of combined approaches in the identification of heritage values (or heritage significance) for intangible and tangible heritage. I initially highlight the difficulties heritage professionals currently have when trying to create unbiased accounts of heritage values and point out the obstacles that are caused by their various specializations and heritage disciplines. On this basis I argue for a consistent perception of all heritage items as all kinds of heritage are equally constructed by our values as part of our social realities. These values are not visible, audible or tangible but are mental constructs and we require strategies to understand and communicate them irrespective of their heritage manifestations. Values are often shared and negotiated by connecting stories – which also form our cultural identities – and I suggest that we have to trace and gather these stories in order to identify our heritage values and heritage significance. 2. Heritage in convenient packages At whatever age and in whatever context we first encountered the notion of heritage we soon learned that heritage is more than we initially thought. Because the term seems to encompass so many different layers it – and not only the term but the whole concept of heritage – is usually broken down into more convenient or more graspable subgroups. In most cases these subgroups are organised according to the physical manifestation of the heritage items, their permanence, mobility or performance. The heritage subgroups derived from these divisions can be identified on several levels, from main categories like tangible and intangible heritage to very specific packages within a subgroup as for example vernacular or religious architectural monuments for immovable heritage. Interestingly enough there are no standardized categories or grouping mechanisms. In fact every organization and institution with responsibility in the heritage field starts reinventing the wheel by creating divisions and packages at its particular convenience. If we look at some examples, we realize that the main reason for such division is a clear framing of administrational and professional responsibility."
