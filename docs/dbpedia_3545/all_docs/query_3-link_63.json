Although often similar in ingredients and appearance, different styles of bread popular throughout the Indian subcontinent are distinguished by distinct cooking techniques, textures or types of flours ranging from pillowy flatbreads or thin crêpes to stuffed dough or crisp puffs.\n\nIntegral to the Indian food experience, bread is eaten as an appetizer with various chutneys, dips or sauces as well as to accompany a snack or meal by soaking up the rich curries and gravies common to Indian food.\n\n1. Naan\n\nThe most widely recognized Indian bread is soft, bubbly naan. This unleavened flatbread can be baked or fried and frequently appears as an accompaniment at Indian restaurants in the United States and around the world. Traditionally, naan is cooked in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay or metal oven with a high cooking temperature. The signature bread is served plain or with butter, garlic and/or chilies.\n\n2. Chapati\n\nChapati is an unleavened flatbread made of finely ground whole wheat flour mixed into dough with water and salt that is cooked on a tava, or flat skillet. This ancient style of bread gets its name from the Hindi word chapat, which means slap or flat. The word describes the traditional method of preparing the dough by wetting one’s palms and slapping the dough between them.\n\nChapati, known as roti in other parts of the world, is foundational to a number of other cuisines across Asia, the Middle East and the Caribbean.\n\nGourmet Cooking Classes Near You\n\nTake your culinary skills to new levels with guidance from five-star chefs.\n\nBook Now\n\n3. Paratha\n\nParatha is another style of unleavened, whole-wheat flatbread and a quintessential Indian food. Thicker and more substantial than naan or chapati, paratha is prepared by coating the dough with ghee (a type of clarified butter) or oil and folding repeatedly, similar to making puff pastry, using a lamination technique.\n\nParatha might also be layered or stuffed with other ingredients such as spiced vegetables, potatoes, lentils or paneer, a soft Indian cheese. Layered and stuffed paratha is finished with a shallow fry and often enjoyed for breakfast or as an afternoon snack.\n\n4. Papadam\n\nPapadam is a thin, deep-fried bread traditionally made with black gram bean flour that is either fried or cooked in dry heat until crisp. Perhaps more similar to a chip or tortilla, papadams are often served with Indian food accompaniments like chutneys, raita (a creamy vegetable dip) or toppings such as lime pickle, chopped onions or chilies and eaten as an appetizer or alongside a meal.\n\nIndian Street Foods\n\nStreet food is central to Indian food culture, with each region, state and city having its own delicacies and local favorites. Many regional Indian foods enjoyed along its bustling streets can be found across the country under different names or spellings. Most street foods are simple, filling dishes that are easy to make and eat on the go but are still rich with the bold flavors and aromas of fried dough, savory vegetables and toasted spices.\n\n5. Samosas\n\nArguably the most popular street food in India, samosas are fried or baked pastry pockets with a savory filling such as spiced potatoes, onions and peas. With origins dating back to around the 10th century, versions of samosas with different shapes and fillings can be found throughout Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The samosa has become an iconic Indian food recognized all around the world.\n\n6. Chaat\n\nChaat actually refers to an entire category of Indian food popular throughout the country in street stalls and roadside stands. Combining aromatic spices and tangy sauces, chaat blends elements that are sweet, salty, crunchy, spicy and savory into one dish bursting with flavor and texture sensations. Although every chaat may look a little different, versions of this unique Indian food usually share a similar design.\n\nBook a Local Food Tour Now\n\nExplore your city's best bites, esteemed eateries and hidden gems with a top-rated tour guide.\n\nBook Now\n\nBegin with a starchy base such as samosas, puffed rice or fried bread. Next, add lots of vegetables such as raw onion, boiled potatoes or chopped tomatoes. A sweet, spicy or tangy chutney is then poured over the vegetables followed by a dusting of chaat masala spice blend to give the chaat its signature flavor.\n\nFinally, finish the chaat with a sprinkle of something crispy or fried such as fried potato bits, crunchy chickpeas or deep-fried noodles. Aloo chaat is a popular potato-based version of this Indian food to look for if you want to give chaat a try.\n\n7. Pani Puri\n\nPani puri is a unique Indian street food experience that goes by many names throughout the country depending on the region, but it is believed to have originated in the northeastern state of Bihar.\n\nEnjoying pani puri is an interactive experience in which you use your thumb to poke a hole in one side of a round, hollow puri, a deep-fried crisp flatbread, which is then filled with a mixture of flavored water, chili powder, chaat masala, tamarind chutney, potatoes, chickpeas or onions — although spices and fillings vary across regions. Pop the entire puri in your mouth to experience an explosion of vibrant flavors and textures.\n\n8. Bhelpuri\n\nBhelpuri is a crunchy snack made of puffed rice served in the style of chaat. It combines sweet, sour and spicy flavors with contrasting textures from a variety of chutneys, vegetables and crunchy toppings.\n\n9. Kachori\n\nAnother popular deep-fried Indian food that goes by many names is kachori. Similar to an empanada, kachori are made with a dough of fine flour stuffed with lentils, beans, vegetables or onions and spices with rich gravy or bold chutney.\n\n10. Chole Bhature\n\nA typical Punjabi street food, chole bhature, also known as chana bhatura, consists of chickpeas (chana) in a spicy sauce served with puffed, fried bread similar to a puri. This simple dish is often enjoyed for breakfast, as a street food snack or a complete meal accompanied by onions, pickled vegetables or chutneys.\n\n11. Matar Kulcha\n\nAnother favorite street food from North India is matar kulcha. This simple snack consists of a soft flatbread served with spiced white pea gravy and is one of the most famous street foods in Delhi.\n\nGourmet Cooking Classes Near You\n\nTake your culinary skills to new levels with guidance from five-star chefs.\n\nBook Now\n\n12. Dosa\n\nDosas are an icon of South Indian food, with a legacy dating back to ancient times. Made from fermented lentil and rice flour batter, the thin pancakes or crêpes are served hot and either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. They are usually eaten with chutney or sambar, a South Indian lentil and vegetable stew. Variations of dosa contain different combinations of fillings and sauces with regional varieties of dough ingredients and preparation methods.\n\n13. Vada Pav\n\nVada pav is a vegetarian street food dish native to the central state of Maharashtra, which is home to the city of Mumbai. The popular dish consists of a deep-fried potato dumpling inside a soft bread bun accompanied by chutneys and green chili peppers.\n\nVada pav, also called a Bombay Burger, was created in the mid-20th century as an affordable and nourishing dish for workers and holds an important place in the city’s culture and political history. World Vada Pav day is celebrated annually on August 23.\n\n14. Misal Pav and Pav Bhaji\n\nThe soft bread roll, or pav, is an important element in several Indian street food dishes, including misal pav and pav bhaji. These Maharashtrian street foods consist of a lentil or vegetable curry paired with a roll for dipping the savory, spiced gravies. Both dishes can be found with a wide variety of pairings and presentations.\n\n15. Kathi Rolls\n\nOriginally from Kolkata in the West Bengal state of India, kathi rolls began as a skewer-roasted kebab wrapped in paratha bread.
