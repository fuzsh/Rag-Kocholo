Due to the Portuguese rule in Goa that lasted for over 450 years, the state hosts people of various regions, ethnic races, and religions from India and abroad. Another reason that Goa is a great place to visit for tourists is because of how widely spoken English is, making it a very accessible place to visit for tourists from around the country.\n\nKonkani - The Official Spoken Language of Goa\n\nKonkani is the official language of Goa and is spoken on the south coast of the country. According to research, 57% of Goans speak Konkani. If interacting with the locals is your thing, learning the language would definitely be an added bonus. You never know if talking in the local language might get you a good bargain in local shops, and cab drivers and get the hands-on information you might be unaware of.\n\nMarathi\n\nMarathi sounds very similar to Konkani as both these languages belong to the Indo-Aryan group and are one of the most widely spoken languages in Goa. Some consider Konkani to be one of its dialects.\n\nHindi\n\nThough Konkani and Marathi are the major languages, you won't find any trouble in communicating in Hindi as it is a widely written and spoken language in Goa.\n\nEnglish\n\nEnglish is a popular language in Goa amongst tourists and people in the urban localities. Goa attracts a plethora of visitors from abroad who are only fluent in English. Most locals have tried their hand at English to help them run their businesses effectively.\n\nPortuguese\n\nPortuguese used to be the official language in Goa during the colonial. It was made compulsory to learn the language amongst the locals. Although the language is not extinct, some of the older generations are still familiar with it. You will also find the language being taught in educational institutions as a third language.\n\nKannada\n\nGoa shares its borders with Karnataka and people from Karnataka moved to Goa for trade and business. The early settlers moved in the late 1800s. Therefore, about 5% of the people in Goa speak Kannada.\n\nCommon Phrases in Konkani\n\nSince you'll be negotiating with vendors and drivers who are locals, the best way to make a good impression is by speaking their language. This may not only impress them but also help you when it comes to bargaining. Here are some common phrases and terms that might be helpful while in Goa.\n\nEnglish Konkani Translation I speak a little Konkani Aoo thodee Konkani ooloyta Can you help me? Mhojem modot korshi? I come from (place) Mau zo gao ( place) How do I go there? Thuim hao kosso vossoonk How much to (place)? Vossoonk kitley pot ollay Where can I make a phone call? Maka phone karonc khuim meltolem Please Upkar koroonc What is the charge per day? Eke dissak kitley poi shay? Thank you Deu borem Korum\n\nThese are the spoken languages in Goa. As a tourist, you will do just fine if you are fluent in Hindi and English.\n\nThis post was published by Yash Saboo\n\nShare this post on social media\n\nFacebook Twitter\n\nTop Hotels In Goa\n\n56 Best Resorts in Goa\n\n₹ 1,750 onwards\n\n49 Best Beach Resorts In Goa For a relaxing getaway\n\n₹ 2,679 onwards\n\n50 Best 5-star Hotels In Goa\n\n₹ 4,500 onwards\n\n63 Best Villas in Goa\n\n₹ 1,904 onwards\n\n64 Best Hotels in Goa\n\n₹ 2,475 onwards\n\n59 Best Hotels in Goa Near Beaches\n\n₹ 399 onwards\n\nView All Hotels In Goa\n\nRelated Articles\n\nArt & Culture\n\nHistory of Goa - How Portuguese & Southern Influences Built the State\n\nArt & Culture\n\nCulture of Goa: A Guide to Goan Tradition and Culture\n\nArt & Culture\n\n13 Enchanting Festivals in Goa - From Carnivals to Fiestas\n\nAdventure\n\nAnjuna Beach Party - What To Keep In Mind\n\nAdventure\n\nScuba Diving In Goa - Price, Location, & Operators\n\nAdventure\n\nGoa is About to Host A New Adventure Sport and We Are EXCITED\n\nAdventure\n\nGot Just 48 Hours In Goa?
