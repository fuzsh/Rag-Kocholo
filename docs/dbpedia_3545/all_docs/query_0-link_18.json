H.\n\n2006-08-01\n\nO universo em que vivemos possui segredos jamais imaginados pelo homem, fruto da pequena proporÃ§Ã£o que ocupamos diante de um cosmos infinito. A astronomia funciona como um instrumento que sacia a sede humana em desvendar esses segredos, estudando as galÃ¡xias, quasares, pulsares alÃ©m da existÃªncia de todos os elementos que preenchem o espaÃ§o cÃ³smico, o vÃ¡cuo, nÃ£o mais vazio como se pensou em outros tempos. A mÃ­dia explora esse campo de forma mÃ­stica e tambÃ©m cientÃ­fica. A difusÃ£o adequada e dentro dos padrÃµes educacionais vigentes, de conceitos astronÃ´micos, se faz necessÃ¡ria, devido sua presenÃ§a nos conteÃºdos escolares, centros de ciÃªncia e na mÃ­dia, de modo geral. A reforma do CurrÃ­culo BÃ¡sico da Escola PÃºblica da maioria dos Estados brasileiros introduziu conceitos astronÃ´micos desde a prÃ©-escola atÃ© o Ensino MÃ©dio. Num estudo realizado com 1.032 alunos do Ensino MÃ©dio de seis escolas estaduais, revelou-se atravÃ©s da aplicaÃ§Ã£o de um questionÃ¡rio que abordava conheciment os bÃ¡sicos em astronomia, como estes foram adquiridos e qual era a infra-estrutura oferecida pela escola: para 66,2% dos entrevistados o professor jÃ¡ fez alguma apresentaÃ§Ã£o a respeito de astronomia. O presente estudo revelou tambÃ©m que 44,5% dos alunos entrevistados adquiriram seus conhecimentos astronÃ´micos na escola, 28,1% atravÃ©s da televisÃ£o e 27,4% afirmaram que seus conhecimentos foram obtidos atravÃ©s de outros tipos de mÃ­dia (internet, filmes e revistas). Embora o estudo revele claramente que hÃ¡ certo equilÃ­brio na forma em que os alunos obtiveram seus conhecimentos astronÃ´micos, a mÃ­dia ainda explora e muitas vezes desperta o interesse pela astronomia com assuntos que nÃ£o fazem parte de nosso cotidiano como, por exemplo, o homem na Lua, os projetos espaciais e a primeira viagem de um astronauta brasileiro no espaÃ§o.

Portugal is mountainous north of the Tagus River and consists of rolling plains in the central south. The Azores and Madeira islands belong to Portugal but enjoy considerable autonomy. Portugal's dependency of Macau on the Chinese coast is an autonomous entity under Portuguese administration. The former teritories of Goa and Portuguese Timor were annexed by India and Indonesia respectively in 1961 and 1976, and the former territories in Africa achieved independence in 1974 and 1975. Portugal, 1 of the oldest states in Europe, traces its modern history to A.D. 1140 when the 1st king was crowned. The approximate present day boundaries were secured in 1249. Portugal eventually became a massive colonial empire with territories in Africa and Latin America and outposts in the Far East. The Portuguese Republic replaced the monarchy in 1910. After some years of instability, Antonio Salazar became prime minister, and with his successor, ruled Portugal as an authoritarian \"corporate\" state for 42 years. An almost bloodless coup in 1974 led to establishment of a parliamentary democracy. The 4 main organs of national government are the presidency, the prime minister and council of ministers, the assembly of the republic, and the courts. Portugal's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1984 was $19.4 billion, and per capita income was $1930. After almost a decade of rapid growth, the economy declined in the mid 1970s due to disruption after the 1974 revolution and the large influx of refugees from Portugal's former colonies in Africa. Growth resumed in the late 1970s, but structural problems and an often adverse international economic climate have slowed progress. The proportion of the labor force in agriculture has dropped from 42% to 24.4% since 1960. Agricultural production now contributes only 8.8% to the GDP, and a\n\nEarly Childhood Education and Care Policy in Portugal = A Educacao Pre-Escolar e os Cuidados para a Infancia em Portugal.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMinistry of Education, Lisbon (Portugal).\n\nBased on the view that the rapid expansion and development of preschool education requires careful scrutiny of both educational policy and practices, this book presents information on current early childhood education and care policy in Portugal.

This article describes the main statutes and procedures governing medicinal products for human use in Portugal and the role of the country×³s National Medicines and Health Products Authority (Autoridade Nacional do Medicamento e Produtos de SaÃºde, I.P.; INFARMED). From the most recently available data, an update of requests and approvals concerning marketing authorizations, variations, pricing, and reimbursements is provided. Data were sourced from the INFARMED website, Infomed (database of medicinal products for human use), and periodic reports issued by national authorities. Organic laws, acts, and law decrees published in the government gazette (DiÃ¡rio da RepÃºblica) are cited and reproduced as required. In 2015 Portugal ranked fifth in the European System of Medicines Evaluation in terms of the number of completed procedures as a reference member state. Approximately 80% of all approved drug applications in Portugal in 2015 were for generic drugs, mostly pertaining to the nervous system. In Portugal, INFARMED monitors drug quality, safety profile, and efficacy in all stages of the drug life cycle, ensuring patients' safety. The Portuguese market for medicinal products for human use has been appreciably changed by the advent of generic drugs. There is an increased trend for new request applications for biological and biotechnological substances. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

Este trabalho descreve a participaÃ§Ã£o da MOPPE, escola-piloto do INPE no projeto, no perÃ­odo de 2000-2003. SerÃ£o apresentadas 1) a criaÃ§Ã£o de um clube de ciÃªncias (1999 a 2001) cujo tema foi a colonizaÃ§Ã£o de Marte e 2) a ementa de astronomia trabalhada com as 7a. e 8a. sÃ©ries do ensino fundamental. A proposta do projeto Colonizando Marte foi estudar diversos aspectos de uma missÃ£o interplanetÃ¡ria e construir experiementos que permitissem quantificar esses aspectos. Os resultados obtidos incluiram apresentaÃ§Ãµes nas SBPC Jovem em 2000 e 2001. Discutiremos tambÃ©m as ementas de astronomia trabalhadas desde 2001 e o envolvimento dos alunos com atividades ligadas a astronomia, fora da aula de ciÃªncias. A inclusÃ£o de astronomia no currÃ­culo das Ãºltimas sÃ©ries motivou a participaÃ§Ã£o de mais alunos culminando com a conquista de duas medalhas para alunos da 7a. sÃ©rie na Olimpiada Brasileira de Astronomia em 2002. Houve tambÃ©m um aumento no nÃºmero de participantes na OBA 2003 e nos projetos de astronomia mais elaborados nas Feira de CiÃªncias de 2001 e 2002.

G.; Sousa, Raul A. R. C.\n\n2011-05-01\n\nThe establishment and development of optometry in Portugal resulted from the committed work of many individuals and institutions. These efforts have had good results in terms of raising the public's awareness of the major role played by optometrists in primary eye care. Back in the late 80's higher education in optometry was started. Ten years ago the results of scientific research on the topic first became available and are now also contributing to the success of optometry in Portugal. In regard to the optometry profession, specific regulations are to be discussed in the national parliament. The AssociaÃ§Ã£o de Profissionais Licenciados de Optometria (APLO), as the professional organization representing optometrists in Portugal, has been critically important in this process. This article will present an overview of the history of optometry in Portugal, of change in the foreseeable future and of the APLO's experience and activities.\n\nEarly Childhood Education in Portugal.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nVasconcelos, Teresa\n\nThis booklet provides an overview of the policy and status of early childhood education in Portugal and includes the text of Law 5/97, the Framework Law for Pre-School Education, as well as the Curriculum Guidelines for Pre-School Education adopted by Portugal's government.

F.; Voelzke, M. R.\n\n2009-03-01\n\nSendo a Astronomia uma das ciÃ¨ncias mais antigas da humanidade, e considerando sua importÃ¡ncia histÃ³rica e cultural, Ã© de extrema relevÃ¡ncia que tÃ³picos relacionados a ela sejam tratados nas escolas. Embora os ParÃ¡metros Curriculares Nacionais do Ensino MÃ©dio (PCN-EM) e as OrientaÃ§iacute;es Complementares aos ParÃ¡metros (PCN+) apontem a importÃ¡ncia de uma abordagem significativa de conceitos relacionados Ã Astronomia nas aulas de FÃ­sica, muitos estudantes terminam o Ensino MÃ©dio (EM) sem compreender a razÃ£o de certos acontecimentos de origem celeste, ainda que estes faÃ§am parte de seu cotidiano e sejam alvos da curiosidade natural dos jovens. Da observaÃ§Ã£o dessa curiosidade em alunos de uma escola pÃºblica paulista, na cidade de Suzano, surgiu o interesse em investigar os conhecimentos bÃ¡sicos em Astronomia dos alunos do Ensino MÃ©dio desta escola, constituindo-se este como principal objetivo desta pesquisa. Para tanto foi elaborado um questionÃ¡rio de mÃºltipla escolha aplicado inicialmente a 34 alunos do primeiro ano e, posteriormente, a mais 310, distribuÃ­dos entre as trÃ¨s sÃ©ries do Ensino MÃ©dio dos perÃ­odos matutino e noturno. Dessa forma, observou-se que 73,9% dos estudantes identificaram o Sol como sendo uma estrela, 67,1% mostraram compreender a sucessÃ£o entre dia e noite e 52,3% relacionaram o Big Bang Ã origem do Universo. Em contrapartida, apenas 34,5% relacionaram as estaÃ§Ã­es do ano Ã inclinaÃ§Ã£o do eixo de rotaÃ§Ã£o da Terra, 21,3% indicaram a influÃ¨ncia gravitacional simultÃ¡nea da Lua e do Sol como responsÃ¡vel pelo fenÃ²meno das marÃ©s, 24,5% indicaram corretamente quais sÃ£o os objetos celestes mais prÃ³ximos da Terra, 36,1% identificaram ano-luz como uma medida de distÃ¡ncia e 34,2% reconheceram as estrelas cadentes como meteoros, evidenciando-se assim o pequeno discernimento dos estudantes quanto aos fenÃ²menos e termos astronÃ²micos do cotidiano.

Azevedo, InÃªs; Marcelino Ferreira, LuÃ­s AntÃ³nio Fialho\n\nWind capacity and generation grew rapidly in several European countries, such as Portugal. Wind power adoption in Portugal began in the early 2000s, incentivized by a continuous feed-in tariff policy mechanism, coupled with public tenders for connection licenses in 2001, 2002, and 2005. These policies led to an enormous success in terms of having a large share of renewables providing electricity services: wind alone accounts today for ~23.5% of electricity demand in Portugal. We explain the reasons wind power became a key part of Portugal's strategy to comply with European Commission climate and energy goals, and provide a detailed reviewmoreÂ Â» of the wind feed-in tariff mechanism. We describe the actors involved in wind power production growth. We estimate the environmental and energy dependency gains achieved through wind power generation, and highlight the correlation between wind electricity generation and electricity exports. Finally, we compare the Portuguese wind policies with others countries' policy designs and discuss the relevance of a feed-in tariff reform for subsequent wind power additions.Â«Â less\n\nBolsa Escola: Breaking the Cycle of Poverty, Child Labour and School Disaffection in Brazil\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDenes, Christian Andrew\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe Bolsa Escola program in Brazil presents a clear break from the economic growth models and supply-side based strategies of the past.

The number and pathology (parasitic diarrhoeas, protozoal and helminthic infections) of in-patients with Tropical Diseases at the Unidade de DoenÃ§as Infecciosas, ParasitÃ¡rias e de Medicina Tropical (UDIP-MT) were described, with special emphasis on Malaria (155 in-patients during the period from 1989 to 1993) and on Sleeping Sickness, where Eflornitin (DFMO) was for the first time used in Portugal. Finally, the impact of HIV epidemic on incidence and different clinical presentations of parasitic and other tropical pathology was also evaluated.\n\nPrevalence of human papillomavirus infection in women in Portugal: the CLEOPATRE Portugal study.\n\nPubMed\n\nPista, Angela; de Oliveira, Carlos Freire; Cunha, Maria JoÃ£o; Paixao, Maria Teresa; Real, Odete\n\n2011-08-01\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for a range of diseases, including cervical cancer. The primary objectives of the CLEOPATRE Portugal study were to estimate the overall and age-stratified prevalence of cervical HPV infection and to assess HPV prevalence and type-specific distribution by cytological results among women aged 18 to 64 years, who reside in mainland Portugal. This cross-sectional population-based study recruited women aged 18 to 64 years, according to an age-stratified sampling strategy, who attended gynecology/obstetrics or sexually transmitted disease clinics across the 5 regional health administrations in mainland Portugal between 2008 and 2009. Liquid-based cytology samples were collected and analyzed centrally for HPV genotyping (clinical array HPV 2 assay) and cytology. Prevalence estimates were adjusted for age using 2007 Portuguese census data. A total of 2326 women were included in the study. The overall prevalence of HPV infection in the study was 19.4% (95% confidence interval, 17.8%-21.0%), with the highest prevalence in women aged 18 to 24 years. High-risk HPV types were detected in 76.5% of infections, of which 36.6% involved multiple types. The commonest high-risk type was HPV-16. At least 1 of the HPV types 6/11/16/18 was detected in 32.6% of infections. The HPV prevalence in normal cytology samples was 16.5%. There was a statistically significant association between high-risk infection and cytological abnormalities (P < 0.001). This is the first population-based study to quantify and describe cervical HPV infection in mainland Portugal. This study provides baseline data for future assessment of the impact of HPV vaccination programs.\n\nStudent Mobility in Portugal: Grappling with Adversity\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSin, Cristina; Tavares, Orlanda; Neave, Guy\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe article examines how far the key Bologna objective of student mobility has been achieved in Portuguese higher education institutions and the main factors shaping it.

A total of 321 middle and high school teachers from 59 schools in urban and rural areas of central Portugal completed the OCB scale at their schools. The confirmatory factor analysis validated a hierarchical model with four latent factors on the first level (altruism, conscientiousness, civic participation and courtesy) and a second order factor (OCB). The revised model fit with the data, Ï 2 /gl = 1.97; CFI = .962; GFI = .952, RMSEA = .05. The proposed scale (comportamentos de cidadania organizacional em escolas- Revista CCOE-R)- is a valid instrument to assess teacher's perceptions of OCB in their schools, allowing investigation at the organizational level of analysis.\n\nPhytoplankton off the Coast of Portugal\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA large phytoplankton bloom off of the coast of Portugal can be seen in this true-color image taken on April 23, 2002, by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard NASA's Terra satellite.

At the table, the ESO Director General, Catherine Cesarsky , and the Portuguese Minister of Science and Technology, JosÃ© Mariano Gago . In his speech, the Portuguese Minister of Science and Technology, JosÃ© Mariano Gago , stated that \"the accession of Portugal to ESO is the result of a joint effort by ESO and Portugal during the last ten years. It was made possible by the rapid Portuguese scientific development and by the growth and internationalisation of its scientific community.\" He continued: \"Portugal is fully committed to European scientific and technological development. We will devote our best efforts to the success of ESO\". Catherine Cesarsky , ESO Director General since 1999, warmly welcomed the Portuguese intention to join ESO. \"With the accession of their country to ESO, Portuguese astronomers will have great opportunities for working on research programmes at the frontiers of modern astrophysics.\" \"This is indeed a good time to join ESO\", she added. \"The four 8.2-m VLT Unit Telescopes with their many first-class instruments are nearly ready, and the VLT\n\nPost Fire Vegetation Recovery in Portugal\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGouveia, Celia; Bastos, Ana; DaCamara, Carlos; Trigo, Ricardo M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFires in Portugal, as in the Mediterranean ecosystems, have a complex effect on vegetation regeneration due to the different responses of vegetation to the variety of fire regimes and to the complexity of landscape structures. A thorough evaluation of vegetation recovery after fire events becomes therefore crucial in land management. In 2005, Portugal suffered a strong damage from forest fires that damaged an area of 300 000 ha of forest and shrub. This year are particularly interesting because it is associated the severe drought of 2005. The aim of the present study is to identify large burnt scars in Portugal during the 2005 fire seasons and monitoring vegetation behaviour throughout the pre and the post fire periods. The mono-parametric model developed by Gouveia et al. (2010), based on monthly values of NDVI, at the 1kmÃ1km spatial scale, as obtained from the VEGETATION-SPOT5 instrument, from 1999 to 2009, was used.\n\nEstimating the prevalence of female genital mutilation in Portugal.\n\nPubMed\n\nTeixeira, A L; Lisboa, M\n\n2016-10-01\n\nDue to globalized migratory processes, female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) has spread to other countries, including countries in Europe, where, with a few exceptions, it remains a concealed problem. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first national extensive study to estimate the prevalence of FGM/C in Portugal. Prevalence estimation. Using extrapolation of country-of-origin prevalence data and the 2011 Census data, this study estimated: the prevalence of FGM/C in Portugal among women of reproductive age (15-49Â years) and among all women aged â¥15Â years; and the number of girls aged <15Â years living in Portugal who have undergone or will probably undergo FGM/C. It is estimated that 6576 women aged â¥15Â years living in Portugal have undergone FGM/C, with cases distributed unevenly throughout the national territory. In addition, it is estimated that 1830 girls aged <15Â years living in Portugal have undergone or are likely to undergo FGM/C. This study estimated that more than 6000 women living in Portugal have undergone FGM/C, and many girls remain at risk. These two groups need different types of interventions. Awareness of the number and geographical dispersion of cases of FGM/C will enable more informed and targeted definition of public health policies for protection of females who have undergone or are at risk of undergoing FGM/C.

They function as a safety net and as a way of reinforcing the bonds amongst elements in a family. Although Portugal is undoubtedly a Southern European country, it is frequently ignored in comparative studies, and is assumed to share the characteristics of Spain and Italy. But do these countries really belong to a common, distinctive model? Portugal was included in the fourth wave of the survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe, which provides a large sample for the study of intergenerational private transfers in this country. It also enables comparison with what happens elsewhere in Europe. We examine the upward and downward flows between generations and identify several important determinants of each type of transfers. Additionally, we show that the different types and directions of transfers are positively correlated, pointing to a self-reinforcement of transfer behaviour in families. We find that Portugal has an especially low probability of private transfers of time and money. After taking into consideration the household-level characteristics, none of the countries included in this study has a significantly lower probability of occurrence of any type of transfer than that of Portugal. A Southern European specific pattern of family transfers is only partially confirmed, yet Portugal and Spain do share the same model.\n\nImmigration and Supplementary Ethnic Schooling: Ukrainian Students in Portugal\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTereshchenko, Antonina; Grau CÃ¡rdenas, Valeska Valentina\n\n2013-01-01\n\nImmigration from Eastern European countries to Portugal is a recent phenomenon.

The Portuguese economy, on the other hand, is in a state of crisis which has resulted in large numbers of unemployed. The growth of the population along with these hard times has made it more difficult to reduce the rate of unemployment. It is also more difficult for those leaving school to find jobs. The better educated generations are seeking jobs in industry and in other services that Portugal will find difficult to offer in sufficient numbers in the immediate future. At present, the Portuguese economy has a large component of agricultural labor. In any case, the means of economic and social intervention to fight unemployment have limited potential. Therefore, many of those unable to find jobs in Portugal will attempt to emigrate. Many Portuguese are already working in Germany, France, and in other Western European countries but migration today is much more difficult. In addition, these countries cannot be expected to recive many more migrant workers in the future. In fact, those better educated workers from Portugal will not be very interested in the low paying jobs which can be found more easily by foreign workers in Western Euorpe. Many will therefore attempt to find jobs in non-European countries. There has been a recent increase of migration to Canada and the US. A renewal of interest in jobs in Brazil and other South Amerian countries is also to be expected. There may also be a future increase in the number of experts, technicians, and other qualified personnel emigrating to Portuguese speaking African countries if there is adequate security and if these countries find the way to expand economic growth.

However, data from Portugal are limited and a considerable part of the literature is in Portuguese. Currently, the rate of congenital infection in Portugal is unknown, and almost nothing is known of sequelae of congenital toxoplasmosis. There is no recent general population-based serological survey of Toxoplasma gondii in humans in Portugal. In addition, there is little information on genetic characteristics of T. gondii in animals and humans. In the present paper, we review prevalence, clinical spectrum and epidemiology of T. gondii in humans and animals in Portugal.

An observational study was performed. An on-line survey was sent by email including questions about characteristics of national, regional and local health transport systems, vehicles, material, and composition of the transport team and their training. Hospital pediatric healthcare professionals treating children in Spain, Portugal and Latin America RESULTS: A total of 117 surveys from 15 countries were analyzed. Of them, 55 (47%) come from 15 regions of Spain and the rest from Portugal and 13 Latin American countries. The inter-hospital transport of pediatric patients is unified only in the Spanish regions of Baleares and CataluÃ±a and in Portugal. Chile has a mixed unified transport system for pediatric and adult patients. Only 51.4% of responders have an educational program for the transport personnel, and only in 36.4% of them the educational program is specific for pediatric patients. In Spain and Portugal the transport is executed mostly by public entities, while in Latin America public and private systems coexist. Specific pediatric equipment is more frequent in the transport teams in the Iberian Peninsula than in Latin American teams. The specific pediatric transport training is less frequent for teams in Latin America than on Spain and Portugal. There is a great variation in the organization of children transport in each country and region. Most of countries and cities do not have unified and specific teams of pediatric transport, with pediatric qualified personnel and specific material.

Whereas in non-peripheral European countries religious themes and even controversies between science and religion were dealt with by scientists and discussed in scientific communities, in Portugal the absence of a debate between science and religion within scientific and intellectual circles is particularly striking. From the historiographic point of view, in a country such as Portugal, where Roman Catholicism is part of the religious and cultural tradition, the influence of religion in all aspects of life has been either taken for granted by those less familiar with the national context or dismissed by local intellectuals, who do not see it as relevant to science. The situation is more complex than these dichotomies, rendering the study of this question particularly appealing from the historiographic point of view, geology being by its very nature a well-suited point from which to approach the theme. We argue that there is a long tradition of independence between science and religion, agnosticism and even atheism among local elites. Especially from the eighteenth century onwards, they are usually portrayed as enlightened minds who struggled against religious and political obscurantism. Religionâor, to be more precise, the Roman Catholic Church and its institutionsâwas usually identified with backwardness, whereas science was seen as the path to progress; consequently men of science usually dissociated their scientific production from religious belief.\n\nFirst autochthone case of sporotrichosis by Sporothrix globosa in Portugal.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Oliveira, Manoel Marques Evangelista; VerÃ­ssimo, Cristina; Sabino, Raquel; Aranha, JoÃ£o; ZancopÃ©-Oliveira, Rosely Maria; Sampaio, Paula; Pais, CÃ©lia\n\n2014-04-01\n\nIn this study, we characterize the first autochthone case of human sporotrichosis reported in Lisbon, Portugal.

This study aims to contribute to the characterization of the fire regime in Portugal with the multivariate statistical analysis of the time series of number of fires and area burned in Portugal during the 1980 - 2009 period. The data used in the analysis is an extended version of the Rural Fire Portuguese Database (PRFD) (Pereira et al, 2011), provided by the National Forest Authority (Autoridade Florestal Nacional, AFN), the Portuguese Forest Service, which includes information for more than 500,000 fire records. There are many multiple advanced techniques for examining the relationships among multiple time series at the same time (e.g., canonical correlation analysis, principal components analysis, factor analysis, path analysis, multiple analyses of variance, clustering systems). This study compares and discusses the results obtained with these different techniques.

These studies rely on either multi-model ensembles or on single-model approaches. The RCM-ensembles account for uncertainties inherent to the different models. In this study, using a 16-RCM ensemble under the IPCC A1B scenario, the climate change signal (future minus recent-past, 2041-2070 - 1961-2000) of 4 bioclimatic indices (Huglin Index - HI, Dryness Index - DI, Hydrothermal Index - HyI and CompI - Composite Index) over mainland Portugal is analysed. A normalized interquartile range (NIQR) of the 16-member ensemble for each bioclimatic index is assessed in order to quantify the ensemble uncertainty. The results show significant increases in the HI index over most of Portugal, with higher values in Alentejo, TrÃ¡s-os-Montes and Douro/Porto wine regions, also depicting very low uncertainty. Conversely, the decreases in the DI pattern throughout the country show large uncertainties, except in Minho (northwestern Portugal), where precipitation reaches the highest amounts in Portugal. The HyI shows significant decreases in northwestern Portugal, with relatively low uncertainty all across the country. The CompI depicts significant decreases over Alentejo and increases over Minho, though decreases over Alentejo reveal high uncertainty, while increases over Minho show low uncertainty. The assessment of the uncertainty in climate change projections is of great relevance for the wine industry. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial, since different models may lead to quite different outcomes and may thereby be as crucial as climate change itself to the winemaking sector.

This map represent a valuable supporting tool for forest and fire management decisions, focus prevention activities, improve the efficiency of fire detection systems, manage resources and actions of fire fighting with greater effectiveness. Therefore this study proposed a structural fire risk map of the vegetated area of Portugal using a deterministic approach based on the concept of fire risk currently accepted by the scientific community which consists in the combination of the fire hazard and the potential economic damage. The existing fire susceptibility map for Portugal based on the slope, land cover and fire probability, was adopted and updated by the use of a higher resolution digital terrain model, longer burnt area perimeter dataset (1975 - 2013) and the entire set of Corine land cover inventories. Five susceptibility classes were mapped to be in accordance with the Portuguese law and the results confirms the good performance of this model not only in terms of the favourability scores but also in the predictive values. Considering three different scenarios of (maximum, mean, and minimum annual) burnt area, fire hazard were estimate. The vulnerability scores and monetary values of species defined in the literature and by law were used to calculate the potential economic damage. The result was a fire risk map that identifies the areas more prone to be affected by fires in the future and provides an estimate of the economic damage of the fire which will be a valuable tool for forest and fire managers and to minimize the economic and environmental consequences of vegetation fires in Portugal.

In the Mediterranean region, the disease has long been perceived as being a constraint to livestock production in North Africa and Turkey but was believed to have minimal impact in Southern European countries. It has recently been demonstrated that in Southern Portugal the prevalence of T. annulata is approximately 30%. While the population genetics of the parasite and the multiplicity of infection in the bovine host have been studied in a number of countries, no information is currently available on the composition of the parasite population in Southern Europe or its relationship to populations in bordering regions. A parasite genotyping system, based on micro- and mini-satellite amplification, was used to perform genetic analysis of T. annulata populations from T. annulata infected cattle in twelve farms in Southern Portugal. A diversity of genotypes and a high multiplicity of infection were found, suggesting that the parasite possesses a panmictic population in this region. In comparison with genotypes found in Tunisia and Turkey, parasites from Portugal form a genetically distinct group and show lower genetic diversity. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the case of Portugal, a country which at the same time imports and exports health workers. Since the early 1990s Portugal became a destination country receiving foreign health care professionals. This situation is now changing with the current economic situation as fewer immigrants come and more Portuguese emigrate. Foreigners coming to Portugal do so in part for similar reasons that bring Portuguese to want to emigrate, mainly the search for better work conditions and professional development opportunities. The emigration of Portuguese health professionals is also stimulated by the difficulty for recently graduated nurses, dentists and diagnostic and therapeutic technicians to find employment, low salaries in the public and private sectors, heavy workloads, remuneration not related to performance and poor career prospects. The paradoxes described in this study illustrate the consequences of the absence of a policy for the health professions. Strategies based on evidence, and on an integrated information system that captures the dynamic evolution of the workforce in health are not only necessary but also a good investment.

Health Research in Portugal has been managed by the FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e Tecnologia and the National Health Institute Doctor Ricardo Jorge, and it has not been a political priority, emphasized by the absence of a national scientific research plan for health, resulting in a weak coordination of actors in the field.

A recent improvement on their characterization has been achieved with the gathering of basic information on past floods and landslides that caused social consequences in Portugal for the period 1865-2015 through the DISASTER database (ZÃªzere et al., 2014). This database was built under the assumption that strong social impacts of floods and landslides are sufficient relevant to be reported consistently by national and regional newspapers. The DISASTER database contains detailed information on the location, date of occurrence and social impacts (fatalities, injuries, missing people, evacuated and homeless people) of each individual hydro-geomorphologic case (1677 flood cases and 292 landslide cases). These hydro-geomorphologic disaster cases are grouped in a restrict number of DISASTER events that were selected according to the following criteria: a set of at least 3 DISASTER cases sharing the same trigger in time (with no more than 3 days without cases), which have a widespread spatial extension related to the triggering mechanism and a certain magnitude. In total, the DISASTER database includes 134 events (3.7 average days of duration) that generated high social impacts in Portugal (962 fatalities and 40878 homeless people). Each DISASTER event was characterized with the following attributes: hydro-geomorphologic event type (e.g landslides, floods, flash floods, urban floods); date of occurrence (year, month and days); duration in days; spatial location in GIS; number of fatalities, injured, evacuated and homeless people; and weather type responsible for triggering the event. The atmospheric forcing at different time scales is the main trigger for the hydro-meteorological DISASTER events occurred in Portugal. In this regard there is an urge for a more systematic assessment of the weather types associated to flood and landslide damaging events to correctly\n\nTetracycline antibiotics in hospital and municipal wastewaters: a pilot study in Portugal.\n\nPubMed\n\nPena, A; Paulo, M; Silva, L J G; SeifrtovÃ¡, M; Lino, C M; Solich, P\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThis study investigated the occurrence of tetracyclines (TCs), namely minocycline (MIN), TC, and its epimer epitetracycline (ETC), and doxycycline (DC), in four hospital wastewater effluents and its fate in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in Coimbra, Portugal. Analytical determination was carried out by solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. A gradient system with a mobile phase containing oxalic acid 0.02 M and acetonitrile was used. After postcolumn derivatization with magnesium reagent, TCs were detected at lambda(exc) 386 nm and lambda(em) 500 nm. The proposed method allowed good sensitivity, accuracy, and precision. LOQs were 0.5 microg l(-1) for ETC and TC and 15 and 5 microg l(-1) for MIN and DC, respectively. The recovery values ranged between 66.4% and 117.1%, and intraday and interday repeatability was lower than 6.8%. The method was successfully used to determine the presence of the above-mentioned TCs in 24 wastewater composite samples obtained from hospital effluents and from influent and effluent of the WWTP located in Coimbra, Portugal. MIN and TC were found in 41.7% of the samples; ETC and DC were found in 25% and 8.3% of the samples, respectively. The levels found ranged from 6 to 531.7 microg l(-1) in hospital effluents, while its concentrations in WWTP ranged from 95.8 to 915.3 microg l(-1). A seasonal influence in the concentrations found has also been observed, the levels found in samples collected during spring being higher than those observed in samples collected during autumn; however, these are only preliminary results.

Fourteen subtypes within nine subtype families were identified, and three of the subtype families (If, IIb, and IId) were restricted or largely limited to Portugal. Parasites from cattle from various regions in Portugal and wild ruminants in Lisbon showed limited genetic heterogeneity (only two subtype families). All wild ruminants had the same subtype, which was also the predominant subtype in cattle all over Portugal and was found in nine HIV-infected patients in Lisbon. Two other C. parvum subtypes were only restricted to limited locations. In contrast, human parasites displayed 13 subtypes in nine subtype families, with most of the infections caused by parasites in Ib, IIa, IIc, and IId families. Two of the C. parvum subtype families (IIc and IIb) had only been found in humans. The high overall parasite diversity and high percentage of C. hominis infections attributable to Ib and C. parvum infections to IId represent unique characteristics of Cryptosporidium transmission in humans in Portugal.\n\nANALYSIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF OZONE-RICH EPISODES IN NORTHEAST PORTUGAL\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarvalho, A.; Monteiro, A.; Ribeiro, I.; Tchepel, O.; Miranda, A.; Borrego, C.; Saavedra, S.; Souto, J.

In addition, a strong wind flow pattern from NE is visible in the North of Portugal and Galicia, in Spain. These two features may lead to an enhancement of the photochemical production and to the transport of pollutants from Spain to Portugal. In addition, the 3D mean back trajectories associated to the ozone episode days were analysed. A clustering method has been applied to the obtained back trajectories. Four main clusters of ozone-rich episodes were identified, with different frequencies of occurrence: north-westerly flows (11%); north-easterly flows (45%), southern flow (4%) and westerly flows (40%). Both analyses highlight the NE flow as a dominant pattern over the North of Portugal. The analysis of the ozone concentrations for each selected cluster indicates that this northeast circulation pattern, together with the southern flow, is responsible for the highest ozone peak episodes. This also suggests that long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants may be the main contributor to the ozone levels registered at Lamas dâOlo. This is also highlighted by the correlation of the ozone time series with the meteorological parameters analysed in the frequency domain.\n\nAssessing International Product Design and Development Graduate Courses: The MIT-Portugal Program\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDori, Yehudit Judy; Silva, Arlindo\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe Product Design and Development (PDD) course is part of the graduate curriculum in the Engineering Design and Advanced Manufacturing (EDAM) study in the MIT-Portugal Program.

C.; Trigo, R. M.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nThe number of fires and the extent of the burned surface in Mediterranean Europe have increased significantly during the last three decades. This may be due either to modifications in land-use (e.g. land abandonment and fuel accumulation) or to climatic changes (e.g. reduction of fuel humidity), both factors leading to an increase of fire risk and fire spread. As in the Mediterranean ecosystems, fires in Portugal have an intricate effect on vegetation regeneration due to the complexity of landscape structures as well as to the different responses of vegetation to the variety of fire regimes. A thorough evaluation of vegetation recovery after fire events becomes therefore crucial in land management. In the above mentioned context remote sensing plays an important role because of its ability to monitor and characterise post-fire vegetation dynamics. A number of fire recovery studies, based on remote sensing, have been conducted in regions characterised by Mediterranean climates and the use of NDVI to monitor plant regeneration after fire events was successfully tested (DÃ­az-Delgado et al., 1998). In particular, several studies have shown that rapid regeneration occurs within the first 2 years after the fire occurrences, with distinct recovery rates according to the geographical facing of the slopes (Pausas and Vallejo, 1999). In 2003 Portugal was hit by the most devastating sequence of large fires, responsible by a total burnt area of 450 000 ha (including 280 000 ha of forest), representing about 5% of the Portuguese mainland (Trigo et al., 2006). The aim of the present work is to assess and monitor the vegetation behaviour over Portugal following the 2003 fire episodes. For this purpose we have used the regional fields of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as obtained from the VEGETATION-SPOT5 instrument, from 1999 to 2008. We developed a methodology to identify large burnt scars in Portugal for the 2003 fire season. The vegetation dynamics was then\n\nVocational Education and Training in Portugal.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGrilo, E.

M.; Annunziato, A.; Carrilho, F.; Baptista, M.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nIn this paper we present the ongoing implementation of a national tsunami warning system in Portugal. After the Sumatra event in December 2004, the UNESCO, through its International Oceanographic Commission, recognized the need for an end to end global tsunami warning system and International Coordination Groups have been established for different areas around the globe: Indian, Caribbean, Atlantic and Mediterranean ocean basins. This system is the natural response to the historical and recent instrumental events generated along the western segment of the Eurasia and Nubian plates, which eastern end corresponds to the Gulf of Cadiz. The TWS includes three main components: the seismic detection, the tsunami detection and the issue of warnings/alerts. In Portugal the automatic earthquake processing is installed at IM (Instituto de Meteorologia) which is the only national institution operating on a 24x7 basis. This makes IM the natural candidate to host the Portuguese tsunami warning system. The TWS under implementation has several key points: definition of the tsunami scenarios, tsunami detection, and tsunami protocol messages. The system will also be able to predict tsunami potential impact along the coast, wave-heights and arrival times at pre-defined locations along the coast. In this study we present the recent results on definition of tsunami scenarios, establishment of the scenario database and the tsunami analysis tool. This work is a joint effort between Instituto de Meteorologia (Portugal), the Joint Research Center, JRC- ISPRA, Italy and the coordination of the Portuguese Group for the implementation of NEAMTWS in the area. This work has been financed by different European projects as NEAREST and TRANSFER, and also by the JRC, the IM and CGUL/IDL institutions.\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia in Portugal.\n\nPubMed\n\nBourbon, M; Alves, A C; Medeiros, A M; Silva, S; Soutar, A K\n\n2008-02-01\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is characterised clinically by an increased level of circulating LDL cholesterol that leads to lipid accumulation in tendons and arteries, premature atherosclerosis and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Although Portugal should have about 20,000 cases, this disease is severely under-diagnosed in our country, this being the first presentation of Portuguese data on FH. A total of 602 blood samples were collected from 184 index patients and 418 relatives from several centres throughout Portugal. Fifty-three different mutations were found in 83 index patients, 79 heterozygous and 4 with two defective LDLR alleles. Additionally, 4 putative alterations were found in 8 patients but were not considered mutations causing disease, mainly because they did not co-segregate with hypercholesterolaemia in the families. Three unrelated patients were found to be heterozygous for the APOB(3500) mutation and two unrelated patients were found to be heterozygous for a novel mutation in PCSK9, predicted to cause a single amino acid substitution, D374H. Cascade screening increased the number of FH patients identified genetically to 204. The newly identified FH patients are now receiving counselling and treatment based on the genetic diagnosis. The early identification of FH patients can increase their life expectancy and quality of life by preventing the development of premature CHD if patients receive appropriate pharmacological treatment.\n\nCo-circulation of a novel phlebovirus and Massilia virus in sandflies, Portugal.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmaro, FÃ¡tima; ZÃ©-ZÃ©, LÃ­bia; Alves, Maria J; BÃ¶rstler, Jessica; Clos, Joachim; Lorenzen, Stephan; Becker, Stefanie Christine; Schmidt-Chanasit, Jonas; Cadar, Daniel\n\n2015-10-24\n\nIn Portugal, entomological surveys to detect phleboviruses in their natural vectors have not been performed so far. Thus, the aims of the present study were to detect, isolate and characterize phleboviruses in sandfly populations of Portugal. From May to October 2007-2008, 896 female sandflies were trapped in ArrÃ¡bida region, located on the southwest coast of Portugal. Phlebovirus RNA was detected by using a pan-phlebovirus RT-PCR in 4 out of 34 Phlebotomus perniciosus pools. Direct sequencing of the amplicons showed that 2 samples exhibited 72 % nucleotide identity with Arbia virus, and two showed 96 % nucleotide identity with Massilia virus. The Arbia-like virus (named Alcube virus) was isolated in cell culture and complete genomic sequences of one Alcube and two Massila viruses were determined using next-generation sequencing technology. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Alcube virus clustered with members of the Salehabad virus species complex. Within this clade, Alcube virus forms a monophyletic lineage with the Arbia, Salehabad and Adana viruses sharing a common ancestor. Arbia virus has been identified as the most closely related virus with 20-28 % nucleotide and 10-27 % amino acid divergences depending on the analysed segment. We have provided genetic evidence for the circulation of a novel phlebovirus species named Alcube virus in Ph. perniciosus and co-circulation of Massilia virus, in ArrÃ¡bida region, southwest of Portugal. Further epidemiological investigations and surveillance for sandfly-borne phleboviruses in Portugal are needed to elucidate their medical importance.\n\nGovernance in Educational Institutions in Portugal\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGarcÃ­a Redondo, Eva\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe present study addresses the governance processes governing the organization and management of educational institutions in Portugal, in a context of analysis in which the educational reforms carried out in this country, from the early nineteenth century (when school responsibility is assumed exclusively by the State) to the present, play whatâ¦\n\nViticultural zoning in Portugal: current conditions and future scenarios\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFraga, H.; Santos, J. A.; Malheiro, A. C.; Moutinho-Pereira, J.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nViticulture and wine production represent a main economic activity of the agro-production sector in Portugal, particularly over some world famous winemaking regions, such as the Port Wine / Douro Valley, Minho and Alentejo. As viticultural zoning provides valuable information regarding the suitability of a given grapevine variety to local climatic conditions, it is thus of great interest to the Portuguese winemaking sector. Furthermore, projected future climates are also likely to have important impacts on this zoning. Therefore, in the current study we aim at 1) discussing the current viticultural zoning in Portugal, and 2) assessing its future changes under anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing (A1B SRES scenario) in the 2011-2070 time period. A set of appropriate bioclimatic indices, computed using temperatures and precipitations defined on a daily basis, is used for viticultural zoning. For the assessment of the recent-past conditions an observational gridded dataset (E-OBS) is used, while for future climate change projections, a 16-member ensemble of model experiments (ENSEMBLES project dataset), is considered. Overall, statistically significant increases (decreases) in the thermally-based (humidity-based) indices are projected to occur in the future throughout the country, particularly over its southern and innermost regions. All these changes are in agreement with the widely accepted projections for warmer and dryer Southern European climates. High impacts are found in the most important winemaking regions in Portugal, highlighting the urgent need for developing suitable adaptation and mitigation measures so as to cope with a changing climate. A reshaping of the viticultural regions is thereby expected to occur within the next decades over Portugal.\n\nPhytoplankton Bloom Off Portugal\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nTurquoise and greenish swirls marked the presence of a large phytoplankton bloom off the coast of Portugal on April 23, 2002.

This study aims to estimate the probable scenario for HF prevalence and its consequences in the short-, medium- and long-term in Portugal. This assessment is based on the EPICA (Epidemiology of Heart Failure and Learning) project, which was designed to estimate the prevalence of chronic heart failure in mainland Portugal in 1998. Estimates of heart failure prevalence were performed for individuals aged over 25 years, distributed by age group and gender, based on data from the 2011 Census by Statistics Portugal. The expected demographic changes, particularly the marked aging of the population, mean that a large number of Portuguese will likely be affected by this syndrome. Assuming that current clinical practices are maintained, the prevalence of heart failure in mainland Portugal will increase by 30% by 2035 and by 33% by 2060, compared to 2011, resulting in 479 921 and 494 191 affected individuals, respectively. In addition to the large number of heart failure patients expected, it is estimated that the hospitalizations and mortality associated with this syndrome will significantly increase its economic impact. Therefore, it is extremely important to raise awareness of this syndrome, as this will favor diagnosis and early referral of patients, facilitating better management of heart failure and helping to decrease the burden it imposes on Portugal.

C.; Trigo, R. M.\n\n2010-04-01\n\nA procedure is presented that allows identifying large burned scars and the monitoring of vegetation recovery in the years following major fire episodes. The procedure relies on 10-day fields of Maximum Value Composites of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MVC-NDVI), with a 1 kmÃ1 km spatial resolution obtained from the VEGETATION instrument. The identification of fire scars during the extremely severe 2003 fire season is performed based on cluster analysis of NDVI anomalies that persist during the vegetative cycle of the year following the fire event. Two regions containing very large burned scars were selected, located in Central and Southwestern Portugal, respectively, and time series of MVC-NDVI analysed before the fire events took place and throughout the post-fire period. It is shown that post-fire vegetation dynamics in the two selected regions may be characterised based on maps of recovery rates as estimated by fitting a monoparametric model of vegetation recovery to MVC-NDVI data over each burned scar. Results indicated that the recovery process in the region located in Central Portugal is mostly related to fire damage rather than to vegetation density before 2003, whereas the latter seems to have a more prominent role than vegetation conditions after the fire episode, e.g. in the case of the region in Southwestern Portugal. These differences are consistent with the respective predominant types of vegetation. The burned area located in Central Portugal is dominated by Pinus Pinaster whose natural regeneration crucially depends on the destruction of seeds present on the soil surface during the fire, whereas the burned scar in Southwestern Portugal was populated by Eucalyptus that may quickly re-sprout from buds after fire. Besides its simplicity, the monoparametric model of vegetation recovery has the advantage of being easily adapted to other low-resolution satellite data, as well as to other types of vegetation indices.\n\nHigh ozone levels in the northeast of Portugal: Analysis and characterization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarvalho, A.; Monteiro, A.; Ribeiro, I.; Tchepel, O.; Miranda, A. I.; Borrego, C.; Saavedra, S.; Souto, J. A.; Casares, J. J.\n\n2010-03-01\n\nEach summer period extremely high ozone levels are registered at the rural background station of Lamas d'Olo, located in the Northeast of Portugal. In average, 30% of the total alert threshold registered in Portugal is detected at this site. The main purpose of this study is to characterize the atmospheric conditions that lead to the ozone-rich episodes at this site. Synoptic patterns anomalies and back trajectories cluster analysis were performed, for the period between 2004 and 2007, considering 76 days when ozone maximum hourly concentrations were above 200 Î¼g m -3. The obtained atmospheric anomaly fields suggested that a positive temperature anomaly is visible above the Iberian Peninsula. A strong wind flow pattern from NE is observable in the North of Portugal and Galicia, in Spain. These two features may lead to an enhancement of the photochemical production and to the transport of pollutants from Spain to Portugal. In addition, the 3D mean back trajectories associated to the ozone episode days were analysed. A clustering method has been applied to the obtained back trajectories. Four main clusters of ozone-rich episodes were identified, with different frequencies of occurrence: north-westerly flows (11%); north-easterly flows (45%), southern flow (4%) and westerly flows (40%). Both analyses highlight the NE flow as a dominant pattern over the North of Portugal during summer. The analysis of the ozone concentrations for each selected cluster indicates that this northeast circulation pattern, together with the southern flow, are responsible for the highest ozone peak episodes. This also suggests that long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants is the main contributor to the ozone levels registered at Lamas d'Olo. This is also highlighted by the correlation of the ozone time-series with the meteorological parameters analysed in the frequency domain.\n\nChallenges and strategies to improve the availability and geographic accessibility of physicians in Portugal.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Oliveira, Ana Paula Cavalcante; Dussault, Gilles; Craveiro, Isabel\n\n2017-03-23\n\nShortages of physicians in remote, rural and other underserved areas and lack of general practitioners limit access to health services. The aims of this article are to identify the challenges faced by policy and decision-makers in Portugal to guarantee the availability and geographic accessibility to physicians in the National Health Service and to describe and analyse their causes, the strategies to tackle them and their results. We also raise the issue of whether research evidence was used or not in the process of policy development. We analysed policy and technical documents, peer-reviewed papers and newspaper articles from 1995 to 2015 through a structured search of government websites, Portuguese online newspapers and PubMed and Virtual HealthÂ Library (Biblioteca Virtual em SaÃºde (BVS)) databases; key informants were consulted to validate and complement the documentary search. The challenges faced by decision-makers to ensure access to physicians were identified as a forecasted shortage of physicians, geographical imbalances and maldistribution of physicians by level of care. To date, no human resources for health policy has been formulated, in spite of most documents reviewed stating that it is needed. On the other hand, various isolated and ad hoc strategies have been adopted, such as incentives to choose family health as a specialty or to work in an underserved region and recruitment of foreign physicians through bilateral agreements. Health workforce research in Portugal is scarce, and therefore, policy decisions regarding the availability and accessibility of physicians are not based on evidence. The policy interventions described in this paper should be evaluated, which would be a good starting point to inform health workforce policy development.\n\nRegulation, circulation and distribution of penicillin in Portugal (1944-1954).\n\nPubMed\n\nBell, Victoria; Rui Pita, JoÃ£o; Pereira, Ana Leonor\n\nPortugal did not participate in World War II but was one of the first countries in the world to receive penicillin for civilian use. The Portuguese Red Cross began to import the antibiotic from the United States of America in 1944 and appointed a controlling committee to oversee its distribution, due to the small amount available. In 1945, as world production increased, penicillin began to be distributed through the normal channels. An important role in its regulation was played by the official department responsible for controlling pharmaceutical and chemical products in Portugal, the ComissÃ£o Reguladora dos Produtos QuÃ­micos e FarmacÃªuticos (Regulatory Committee for Chemical and Pharmaceutical Products). Penicillin was imported as a raw material from 1947 and the first medicaments containing penicillin, prepared in Portugal, were released into the commercial circuit in 1948. A laboratory had been established in 1942 by the ComissÃ£o Reguladora for the analytical verification of medicaments and medicinal products with the aim of certifying their quality and minimizing the number of products with no attested therapeutic efficacy. The number of medicaments analysed by this laboratory increased substantially from 72 in the year of its foundation (1942) to 2478 in 1954, including, after 1948, medicaments containing penicillin. The aim of the present paper was to elucidate the role of the ComissÃ£o Reguladora dos Produtos QuÃ­micos e FarmacÃªuticos in regulating and controlling the distribution of penicillin in Portugal during the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nPalliative care and nursing in dissertations and theses in Portugal: a bibliometric study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFerreira, Maria AmÃ©lia Leite; Pereira, Alexandra Manuela Nogueira de Andrade; Martins, JosÃ© Carlos Amado; Barbieri-Figueiredo, Maria do CÃ©u\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTo identify the academic scientific production on palliative care in master dissertations and PhD theses carried out by nurses in Portugal.

Baits of Spartina maritima stems were exposed to permanent or temporary submersion at the upper and lower limits of the intertidal zone. The baits were observed for fruit bodies and spores directly and after incubation in moist chambers. Twenty six marine species were identified (17 Ascomycota, two Basidiomycota and seven mitosporic fungi). Twenty four are new records for Portugal. Nia globospora Barata and BasÃ­lio was published as a new species. Species were characterized with respect to frequency of occurrence, colonization capability and substrate succession.

Several countries have conducted surveys to derive value sets, but this was not the case for Portugal. The purpose of this study was to estimate a value set for the EQ-5D for Portugal using the time trade-off (TTO). A representative sample of the Portuguese general population (n = 450) stratified by age and gender valued 24 health states. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained interviewers. Each respondent ranked and valued seven health states using the TTO. Several models were estimated at both the individual and aggregated levels to predict health state valuations. Alternative functional forms were considered to account for the skewed distribution of these valuations. The models were analyzed in terms of their coefficients, overall fit and the ability for predicting the TTO values. Random effects models were estimated using generalized least squares and were robust across model specification. The results are generally consistent with other value sets. This research provides the Portuguese EQ-5D value set based on the preferences of the Portuguese general population as measured by the TTO. This value set is recommended for use in CUA conducted in Portugal.\n\nLyme borreliosis spirochetes in questing ticks from mainland Portugal.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaptista, Susana; Quaresma, Ana; Aires, TÃ¢nia; Kurtenbach, Klaus; Santos-Reis, Margarida; Nicholson, Matthew; Collares-Pereira, Margarida\n\n2004-04-01\n\nIn Portugal, Ixodes ricinus ticks have been shown to contain DNA of several spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, with major differences in the genetic diversity between ecozones. Some isolates have been obtained since 1999, confirming the circulation of pathogenic strains in these ticks. Ixodes ricinus is considered to be a widespread species, however, in Portugal it is found only in a few habitats. Here we present preliminary results from a nationwide survey of questing I. ricinus (n = 4,001) and other Ixodidae (n = 1,534) in Portugal, initiated in 2001. The sampling points (so far 41) were selected using a Geographic Information System, according to the type of vegetation, accessibility and prevalence of human cases. The spatial and temporal of tick abundance and the infection of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in ticks were determined in selected areas. Ticks were examined for the presence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato by culturing (719 out of 4,001 I. ricinus), and direct PCR amplification of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer region (1,870 out of 5,535) followed by RFLP analysis, the reverse line blot assay and nucleotide sequencing of PCR amplicons. The most abundant tick genus was Rhipicephalus (53%), followed by Dermacentor (34%), I. ricinus and Hyalomma (7%, each). The Mafra and GrÃ¢ndola sites, where a more intensive study was carried out, were excellent habitats for I. ricinus. However, a clear difference of the prevalence of Borrelia infection and the genetic diversity of circulating spirochetes was observed in these two sites. Genotyping of all I. ricinus isolates revealed 5 B. garinii, 8 B. lusitaniae and 1 B. valaisiana strains, which were obtained for the first time in these regions along with a considerable percentage of tick-derived PCR amplicons. Two hard-tick species other than I. ricinus in GrÃ¢ndola were also B. lusitaniae positive, thus seeming to take part in the transmission cycle of Borrelia.

Passed in February, the law was a liberalization of Portugal's strict anti-abortion laws, which ban all abortions except for narrowly defined medical reasons or in the case of rape (and those are permitted only until the 12th week of pregnancy). Because the issue is such a controversial one, politicians had turned to a national referendum asking Portuguese voters to overturn or ratify the new law. The referendum was the first in the country since the end of its right-wing dictatorship in 1974, and 50% participation was required. Only 31.5% of the country's 8.5 million eligible voters went to the polls on June 28. Of those voting, 50.9% voted against the liberalized new legislation. Sunny weather and World Cup soccer matches were both pointed to as reasons for the low turnout. Officials estimate there are some 20,000 illegal abortions annually in Portugal. Abortion-rights activists in the mostly Roman-Catholic country say hospitals see roughly 10,000 women a year suffering from complications from illegal abortions, and that at least 800 women die each year from the procedure.

A cross-sectional population-based study was performed. Women aged 18-64 years who attended selected obstetrics and gynecology or sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in mainland Portugal between February 2008 and March 2009 were recruited, according to an age-stratified sampling strategy. Liquid-based cytology samples were analyzed centrally for HPV genotype and for cytologic features. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified risk factors for HPV infection. Among the 2326 women evaluated, the crude prevalence of HPV infection was 19.4%. Lifetime number of sexual partners was a strong predictor of HPV infection (odds ratio 5.44 for 5-10 partners versus 1 partner; P<0.001). Other risk factors were young age (particularly among women aged 20-24 years; P<0.001); country of birth other than mainland Portugal (P=0.002); education up to secondary school level (P=0.010); smoking history (â¤ 10 years; P=0.004); and any STD in the past 12 months (P=0.052).

Twenty-six (21.3%) birds were found to be infested with at least one chewing louse species. The chewing lice identified include 18 species. Colonial birds (34.9%) and migratory birds (29.5%) had statistically significant higher prevalence than territorial birds (6.8%) and resident birds (13.1%), respectively. This paper records 17 louse species for the first time in southern Portugal: Laemobothrion maximum, Laemobothrion vulturis, Actornithophilus piceus lari, Actornithophilus umbrinus, Austromenopon lutescens, Colpocephalum heterosoma, Colpocephalum turbinatum, Eidmanniella pustulosa, Nosopon casteli, Pectinopygus bassani, Pseudomenopon pilosum, Trinoton femoratum, Trinoton querquedulae, Craspedorrhynchus platystomus, Degeeriella fulva, Falcolipeurus quadripustulatus, Lunaceps schismatus. Also a nymph of the genus Strigiphilus was collected from a Eurasian eagle-owl. These findings contribute to the knowledge of avian chewing lice from important birds areas in Portugal.

Despite improvements in the treatment of hypertension and the resulting decrease in associated mortality, the progressive aging of the population and increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation have prevented the incidence of stroke from falling as much as desired. The authors review the evidence on the situation in Portugal and propose an intervention plan. Copyright Â© 2013 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia. Published by Elsevier EspaÃ±a.

Isabel P.\n\n2010-05-01\n\nThe characterization of rainfall at a variety of space- and time-scales demands usually that data from different origins and resolution are explored. Different tools and methodologies can be used for this purpose. In regions where the spatial variation of rain is marked, the study of the scaling structure of rainfall can lead to a better understanding of the type of events affecting that specific area, which is essential for many engineering applications. The relevant factors affecting rain variability, in time and space, can lead to contrasting statistics which should be carefully taken into account in design procedures and decision making processes. One such region is Mainland Portugal; the territory is located in the transitional region between the sub-tropical anticyclone and the subpolar depression zones and is characterized by strong north-south and east-west rainfall gradients. The spatial distribution and seasonal variability of rain are particularly influenced by the characteristics of the global circulation. One specific feature is the Atlantic origin of many synoptic disturbances in the context of the regional geography (e.g. latitude, orography, oceanic and continental influences). Thus, aiming at investigating the statistical signature of rain events of different origins, resulting from the large number of mechanisms and factors affecting the rainfall climate over Portugal, scale-invariant analyses of the temporal structure of rain from several locations in mainland Portugal were conducted. The study used short-term rainfall time series. Relevant scaling ranges were identified and characterized that help clarifying the small-scale behaviour and statistics of this process.\n\nAtmospheric circulation classification comparison based on wildfires in Portugal\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPereira, M.
