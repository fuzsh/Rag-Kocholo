        "text": "Hooters abruptly closed dozens of “underperforming stores” – the latest chain to shutter restaurants as inflation batters US consumers.\n\nThe famed chicken wings brand, known for its skimpy uniforms, cited “pressure from current market conditions” for its decision to close an unspecified number of stores.\n\n“Like many restaurants under pressure from current market conditions, Hooters has made the difficult decision” to close select locations, a spokesperson told The Post on Monday.\n\nRoughly 40 of the 300 restaurants worldwide were shut, including in Florida, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Texas and Virginia, according to Nation’s Restaurant News.\n\nThe number of Hooters locations has declined by 12% since 2018, according to restaurant consulting firm Technomic. Meanwhile, competitors Twin Peaks and Dave & Busters have all seen increases since then, CNN reported.\n\nThe Hooters rep maintained that the “brand of 41 years” is still “highly resilient and relevant.”\n\nThe company has been opening new locations both in the US and internationally, as well as adding Hooters-branded frozen food to grocery stores.\n\n“We look forward to continuing to serve our guests at home, on the go and at our restaurants here in the US and around the globe,” the spokesperson told the Post.\n\nHooters’ closures come as other popular chains close their doors.\n\nSeafood chain Red Lobster shuttered 93 locations last month before filing for bankruptcy, while Applebee’s, TGI Fridays, Boston Market and California Pizza Kitchen also recently closed restaurants.\n\nCracker Barrel’s CEO recently admitted the chain is “just not as relevant” as it used to be as its stock has been in freefall.\n\nOverall, restaurant spending has slowed amid high dining costs, falling in four of the past six months, according to Census data as reported by NBC.\n\nSales totaled $93.6 billion in May, the lowest monthly sales volume since October 2023, according to the Nation’s Restaurant Association."
