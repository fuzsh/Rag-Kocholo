        "text": "MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. - Hooters of America Inc. Chairman Robert Brooks, who was found dead in his home here, died of natural causes, the Horry County coroner's office said Monday.\n\nBrooks, 69, was found dead Sunday by his wife and a neighbor after he failed to show up at their usual Sunday breakfast, Coroner Robert Edge said.\n\nEdge would not say what killed Brooks, but called it a \"natural death.\" Brooks had diabetes and suffered a stroke in the 1980s, The (Myrtle Beach) Sun News reported Monday.\n\nBrooks broke into the food business by creating a milkshake formula and gained fame selling chicken wings served by scantily clad waitresses at his Hooters restaurants.\n\nSince opening its first store in Clearwater, Fla., in 1983, Hooters of America expanded across the United States and into more than a dozen foreign countries ranging from Taiwan to Venezuela. Hooters has about 61 million annual visitors to its some 425 restaurants.\n\nBorn on a tobacco farm outside Loris near Myrtle Beach, Brooks graduated from Clemson University with a degree in dairy science. According to a Newsweek article in June 2005, Brooks broke into the food industry with a milkshake formula that was used by restaurant chain Burger King.\n\nIn 1966, he founded Eastern Foods Inc., which started off selling nondairy creamer to airlines and now makes dressings and sauces as Naturally Fresh Foods. He continued as chairman of the company that has more than $100 million in sales each year.\n\nHe also had a few other businesses, including the White Water Country Club in Fayette County, Ga.; the Super Sports Co., which makes merchandise sold in Hooters restaurants; and, the World Business Center, a land development company in Atlanta.\n\nHe owned speedways in Lakeland, Fla., Jefferson, Ga., and Hudson, N.C., and was co-owner of video production company, Hallbrook Productions. The company produces commercials for his restaurants and other ventures.\n\nBut he's best known for his Hooters restaurants. In 1984, he and a group of Atlanta investors bought expansion and franchise rights for the Hooters chain. He eventually bought majority control and became chairman.\n\nBrooks was named Entrepreneur of the Year by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce in 1996, according to the company's Web site.\n\n\"He was a wonderfully gifted businessman,\" said Brad Dean, president of the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. \"He understood business, a lot more than just how to sell chicken wings.\"\n\nHe tried to parlay the restaurant chain's success into a Myrtle Beach-based airline in 2003. At its peak, Hooters Air flew to 15 destinations from Newark, N.J., to the Bahamas. But the company racked up debt and stopped commercial flights earlier this year. The company now flies charters.\n\nLocal business leaders remembered Brooks as a sharp businessman with a down-home flair, who never forgot where he came from.\n\n\"For what he had achieved in the global business world, you would never have known it. You could approach Mr. Brooks, sit down and talk to him. He was very down to earth,\" said Mickey McCamish, president of Myrtle Beach Golf Holiday, a marketing firm that worked with Brooks on flight destinations for Hooters Air.\n\nBut despite boarding about 63,000 passengers in Myrtle Beach last year, the airline couldn't survive.\n\n\"What I admired most about Mr. Brooks was that he tried it. He tried it because this community needed it,\" McCamish said. \"He was willing to take that financial risk.\"\n\nHe shared his wealth with his hometown, giving $2 million to Coastal Carolina University for its first football stadium, which was named Brooks Stadium in 2003."
