        "text": "In a toast to innovation and excellence, Hooters of America was recently honored with the prestigious “Best Beer Program 2024” award at Questex’s Vibe Conference, the premier on-premise beverage conference for executives. The Vibe Conference applauds organizations demonstrating leadership through the creation, training, execution, management and ongoing positive results of beverage programs.\n\nHooters’ acclaimed beer programs, which span the calendar year, cater to both everyday occasions and special events, especially those tied to televised sports on the restaurant’s iconic big screens. These programs have significantly contributed to Hooters’ reputation as a leading destination for sports fans and guests seeking a fun dining experience.\n\nHooters has led the industry with relevant and active social media presence via national and local Facebook pages, Instagram and Twitter accounts. All of the restaurant’s beverage components have been featured on the company’s QR SmartMenu through a partnership with BeerBoard, many of which have videos customers can view to learn more about the products directly from a Hooters Girl. The company has been a pioneer and award winner in name, image and likeness (NIL) promotions as well for fans of college football.\n\nHooters has also used a blended approach to server training around beverages, with classrooms and hands-on training in restaurants. The company’s learning management system (LMS) provides modules and videos Hooters Girls leverage to become well-versed on the restaurant’s beverage offerings. The program also addresses responsible alcohol service, covered both in classrooms and in training manuals.\n\n“We give customers so many reasons to enjoy drinking responsibly in our environments, and many of these creative programs are why people come back again and again to experience Hooters as a home away from home,” said Bruce Skala, Hooters Chief Marketing Officer. “In winning this award, we salute both our beverage partners as well as our staff and guests who help make Hooters a place of such community and camaraderie.”\n\nTo learn more about Vibe Conference, visit: https://www.vibeconference.com.
