        "text": "The Philadelphia band that opened Live Aid will play two shows at the Glenside theater in November.\n\nGLENSIDE, PA —The Hooters —the legendary Philadelphia that opened Live Aid —will perform for two shows at the Keswick Theater in November.\n\nThe Keswick Theater announced that the band will play at 8 p.m. on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 with tickets going on sale Friday.\n\nIn 1980, The Hooters burst onto the Philadelphia music scene as a new and different kind of rock band, formed by co-leaders and songwriters Rob Hyman (vocals, keyboards, accordion) and Eric Bazilian (vocals, guitars, mandolin, mandola, harmonica, saxophone).\n\nThe other members include original drummer David Uosikkinen, John Lilley (guitars, mandolin), Fran Smith, Jr. (bass, vocals) and Tommy Williams (guitars, mandolin, vocals).\n\nTheir unique blend of ska, reggae, and rock was a fresh sound in the clubs and on Philly radio, and in 1983, The Hooters released their first independent album Amore to great local success. The album also featured the “hooter,” or melodica, as part of their special sound and namesake.\n\nThe Hooters' strong and powerful presence, as performers and as songwriters, led to their first major record deal in 1984 with Columbia Records. Their 1985 debut release \"Nervous Night\" quickly achieved Gold and Platinum status in the USA, Australia and Canada with the hits “And We Danced”, “All You Zombies”, “Day By Day” and “Where Do The Children Go”.\n\nRolling Stone magazine named The Hooters the \"Best New Band of the Year\" in 1985, and in July of that year, the group was chosen to open the historic Live Aid concert in Philadelphia.\n\nBy 1986, they had been touring the US and Canada almost non-stop, and that summer The Hooters were sharing the stage at the Amnesty International Concert at Giants Stadium with acts such as U2, The Police, Miles Davis, Lou Reed, Fela, Santana and Peter Gabriel.\n\nIn 1987, the group released their second album, One Way Home, again achieving Gold and Platinum status in the US as well as opening up new touring opportunities in Japan and Europe. With songs like \"Johnny B\", \"Satellite\", and \"Karla With A K\", David Fricke (Rolling Stone) wrote, \"The Hooters have made airwave magic with unconventional ingredients.”\n\nRob and Eric have also contributed their musical and songwriting assistance to other artists including Cyndi Lauper, Joan Osborne, The Band, Carole King, Mick Jagger, Willie Nelson, The Chieftains, Jon Bon Jovi, Robbie Williams, The Scorpions, Dar Williams and Taj Mahal, among others.\n\nIn 2009, The Hooters released Both Sides Live, a double-album set featuring all the band’s greatest hits in both full-tilt electric and unique acoustic versions. And in 2010, their EP 5x5 was released, featuring the uplifting single “Silver Lining” as well as versions of the hits “Time After Time” and “One Of Us”.\n\nThose two songs had previously earned Rob and Eric Grammy nominations for “Song Of The Year”, which they had written and recorded for Cyndi Lauper and Joan Osborne respectively.\n\n2017 brought Give The Music Back, a new double-live album recorded at the legendary Keswick Theater, near their hometown base of Philadelphia. This compilation CD and subsequent international tours continue to reflect their strong collaborations in the studio, their passionate energy onstage, and their long-time friendship on the road and off.\n\nAnd in October 2019, the group was inducted into Philly’s “Walk Of Fame” with their own sidewalk plaque on the Avenue of the Arts.\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
