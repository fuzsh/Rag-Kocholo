        "text": "At first glance, the name Hooters doesn’t necessarily inspire words like family or loyalty. But as is usually the case, first appearances can be deceiving. Devoted fans of the 450-unit, Atlanta-based dinnerhouse chain already know as much and keep coming back for more fun, especially during these tough economic times.\n\nCoby Brooks, the company’s president and chief executive, says Hooters, which once was associated more with breasts than, well, wings, continues to grow in popularity because of its ever-expanding, loyal customer base and its core dedication to always enhancing the guest experience.\n\nHow has Hooters been able to develop and maintain such a loyal fan base, particularly during the economic downturn?\n\nIt really goes back to the inception of the concept. I think it’s because we tell our customers: “Lose your worries and enjoy yourself.” We continue to treat our guests the same way we did when they first walked through our doors. We tell every employee that our customers are no less important than they are, so treat them exactly how they want to be treated. No one is exempted from stress; everyone has problems. So we want to treat them extremely well. You have to treat your customers even better than you did before.\n\nSo why do you think they keep coming back?\n\nWe’ve touched so many people for such a long time. In 26 years, we’ve never changed what we’re about. Some people won’t come to us for any reason because of religious beliefs or whatever. But those people who know us know they are welcome all the time at any time of the day, and we will never waver on that part of our culture.\n\nWe really are a family-type establishment, and that translates right down to the store level. I’ve seen the same people for 17 years, and they keep coming back. When they see us, they come up and chat. It happens all over the world. We have stores in 26 countries, and we hear the same stories in every place.\n\nBONUS POINTS\n\n“I first started going to Hooters when I was 26. Now I’m 47. So far I’ve been to [hundreds] of restaurants. I’m a sucker for pretty girls; that’s pretty much the key right there. The Hooters Girls are really pretty, and the food and beer are pretty good, too.”—Mike “Hooters” Herbst, Hooters’ No. 1 fan, Greenfield, Wis.\n\nHow do you see the Hooters fan base changing and growing over the next few years?"
