        "text": "Now known as the “Hooters Six,” founders L.D. Stewart, Gil DiGiannantonio, “Uncle Billy” Ranieri, Ed Droste, Dennis Johnson, and Ken Wimmer originally opened Hooters restaurant in Clearwater, FL, as a joke. No one in the group had any restaurant experience, and, according to the company website, they were “arrested for impersonating restauranteurs” when they made their plans for the establishment known.\n\nThe group was so sure that their business model - selling wings served by scantily clad waitresses at a sports bar - would fail that they incorporated their endeavor on April Fools' Day in 1983. When the restaurant opened that October, the six chose to make a graveyard on the property for all of the previous restaurants that had failed in the location, expecting theirs to follow quickly.\n\nOscar-nominated actress Amy Adams got her first gig working at Hooters in 1993. She was initially hired as a hostess, making twice the minimum wage at $7 an hour. Because she was only 17, she was allowed to wear a tennis outfit as she waited for her promotion to waitress on her 18th birthday. Adams admitted to Vanity Fair that she hadn't truly understood the brand's concept:\n\nI hate to sound so innocent but… where I grew up, what was being sold to us was far less sexualized than what’s being sold to kids now… So there was definitely an innocence to my interpretation of what Hooters was about. Though I did learn, quickly, that short shorts and beer don’t mix! The nicest guy walking in is not necessarily the nicest guy after two pitchers of beer.\n\nThree weeks into the gig, she had earned enough to purchase her first car and left.\n\nThe chain famous for its low-cut tanks with owls on them can thank comedian Steve Martin for the brand's inspiration. Just as the restaurant was opened as a joke, the name \"Hooters\" came from a punchline in one of Martin's Saturday Night Live monologues. On May 17, 1980, he quipped:\n\nI believe it's derogatory to refer to a woman's breasts as “boobs,” “jugs,” “winnebagos,” or “golden bozos”… and that you should only refer to them as “hooters.”\n\nThe Hooters Six found the joke so humorous that they remembered it three years later, believing it to be a great fit for their company's name.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1995, Hooters had its own time slot on cable television. Hosted by the very first Hooters Girl, Lynne Austin, the show began as a way to promote the restaurant by allowing Hooters girls to introduce a different movie each week.\n\nSoon, the content expanded to allow for SNL-type skits and political banter. The show was offered in 13 different markets and went through two name changes: Hooters Nite Owl Theater and Hooters Movie of the Week.\n\nBy 2002, Robert Brooks had taken ownership of both Hooters of America and Pace Airlines. Realizing the opportunity to promote both of his ventures, he commissioned some of the Pace Airlines planes to be revamped as flying billboards for Hooters.\n\nPassengers were promised exceptional service from traditional flight attendants as well as entertainment from Hooters Girls, who were not trained to work on a plane, and therefore had little to do other than engage passengers in conversation. Other passenger perks included free meals and drinks for any flights over one hour, an unusually spacious 34-inch seat, and competitive airline rates that mimicked the most cost-efficient flights from competing airlines.\n\nHooters Air had to suspend flights in 2006 when the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita drove up gas prices beyond the brand's means. The company lost $40 million in the venture.\n\nFor Hooters, bringing its “delightfully tacky, yet unrefined” business model to Las Vegas seemed like a natural progression. In 2006, the restaurant chain opened the doors to Hooters Hotel and Casino, located across the street from the MGM Grand near the Strip. The property boasted 696 rooms and nine restaurants/bars for the company's target market, married men from ages 25 to 54, to drink, dine, and gamble. Believing that lower rates would attract more young, blue-collar customers, the company went $125 million into debt remodeling the building to match the Hooters brand.\n\nUnfortunately for Hooters enthusiasts who love to gamble, the chain closed its doors in 2020, selling to an India-based company, OYO."
