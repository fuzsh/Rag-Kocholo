        "text": "At least six Hooters restaurants in Texas suddenly joined the growing list of restaurant closures over the weekend, and more could follow.\n\nIs Hooters closing?\n\nA handful of Texas Hooters locations have been listed as \"permanently closed\" on Google, and officials with the national sports bar chain have confirmed the closure. U-Haul moving trucks were spotted being loaded outside of Lubbock's Hooters, which was among the Texas locations to permanently close.\n\nHooters employees also shared that the closure is the most recent of around 40 locations that have shuttered across the U.S. In addition to the Texas locations, Florida also saw the closure of a Hooters over the weekend.\n\nFlorida Hooters shutters: Hooters South Lakeland location, the 2nd in the chain, among dozens closed on Sunday\n\n\"Like many restaurants under pressure from current market conditions, Hooters has made the difficult decision to close a select number of underperforming stores,\" the company stated in an email. \"Ensuring the well-being of our staff is our priority in these rare instances. With new Hooters restaurants opening domestically and internationally, new Hooters frozen products launching at grocery stores, and the Hooters footprint expanding into new markets with both company and franchise locations, this brand of 41 years remains highly resilient and relevant.\"\n\nLubbock joins Hooters closures: Lubbock Hooters among 40 suddenly closed in company decision\n\nHooters locations closing in Texas\n\nThe following Texas locations appear to be permanently closed:\n\nBryan: 960 N. Earl Rudder Freeway\n\nLubbock: 4950 S. Loop 289\n\nMcAllen: 410 E. Expressway 83\n\nSan Angelo: 4384 Sherwood Way\n\nSeabrook: 1818 NASA Road 1\n\nWichita Falls: 3701 Call Field Road\n\nWichita Falls joins Hooters closures: UPDATED: Well-known chain restaurant in Wichita Falls permanently closes\n\nThe end of an era at Hooters\n\nHooters is a sports bar started by six Clearwater investors in 1983. The chain became popular and widely known for its chicken wings served by scantily clad waitresses. It inspired a trend in the restaurant industry sometimes called \"breastaurants,\" with competitors including Twin Peaks and the Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery.\n\nUSA TODAY reporters Alana Edgin and Sara-Megan Walsh contributed to this report."
