        "text": "The Hooters are an American rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The band combines elements of rock, reggae, ska, and folk music to create its sound.\n\nThe Hooters first gained major commercial success in the United States in the mid-1980s due to heavy radio airplay and MTV rotation of several songs, including “All You Zombies,” “Day by Day,” “And We Danced,” and “Where Do the Children Go.” The band played at the Live Aid benefit concert in Philadelphia in 1985. In Europe, the Hooters had success with the singles “All You Zombies” and “Johnny B,” but the band’s breakthrough across Europe came with the single “Satellite.” The band played at The Wall Concert in Berlin in 1990.\n\nThe Hooters have staged successful tours in Europe. In 2007, the band released its first album of new material since 1993, Time Stand Still. The band’s most recent release was Rocking & Swing, released in 2023."
