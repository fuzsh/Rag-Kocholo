Previous owner of the Bay City Hooters, Art Dore, sold the Hooters name back to the Franchisee.\n\n(Amanda Ray | MLive.com)\n\nBAY CITY, MI -- Hooters restaurants in Bay and Saginaw counties, known for wings and waitresses in orange shorts, are closed for remodeling, after Bay City businessman Art Dore and the Dore family turned the restaurants back over to corporate.\n\nDore, owner of the buildings and former franchisee of the two restaurants, said corporate took over Monday, Feb. 2.\n\n\"We have leased the Bay City and Saginaw locations to Hooters corporate,\" he said.\n\n\"They're going to be closed for (about) three weeks and then open up bigger and better.\"\n\nThe restaurants, located at 966 E. Midland St. on Bay City's West Side and 5538 Bay Road in Saginaw County's Kochville Township, are expected to reopen later this month.\n\nWhen asked what prompted the decision, Dore replied, \"We just had too much going. The restaurant business is not one of my favorite things.\"\n\nAtlanta-based Hooters of America LLC is the operator and franchiser of more than 430 Hooters locations in 28 countries, according to the company's website. The privately-held corporation owns 160 units.\n\nThe self-described \"casual, beach-themed establishments\" serve up chicken wings, seafood, sandwiches, burgers and salads.\n\nThe restaurant chain arguably is known best not for its food but for its \"Hooters Girls.\"\n\n\"Hooters Girls are the very essence of Hooters,\" the company's website reads. \"Trained to excel in customer service, they provide the energy, charisma and engaging conversation that keep guests coming back. Much more than just a pretty face, Hooters girls have game. They're intelligent and attentive -- using their energy, experience and personalities to serve guests everywhere to live in the moment and take a break from the outside world.\"\n\nMark Whittle, senior vice president of global development at Hooters of America, said the restaurants in Bay and Saginaw counties currently are undergoing remodeling.\n\n\"Hooters of America is currently leasing the Saginaw and Bay City Hooters locations,\" he said in a statement. \"Both restaurants are undergoing part one of two remodels, after which customers can expect major facility enhancements, including a new audio visual package, refreshed bar area, and upgrades to our furniture, restrooms and exterior facade. Part two of the remodels will occur later this year.\n\nRelated: Hooters girl from Saginaw County restaurant to appear on national TV in swimsuit pageant\n\n\"As always, customers can expect a friendly welcome and our famous Hooters Girl hospitality when Saginaw reopens Feb. 10 and Bay City reopens on Feb. 24.\"\n\nDore still owns the Hooters in Traverse City. He and his family own a slew of other businesses, including Lumber Barons Brewery, Stables Martini & Cigar Bar, Bay City Country Club and Dore & Associates Contracting Inc.\n\nDore said Dore & Associates, a demolition, abatement and remediation contracting firm, is very busy elsewhere in Michigan and in other states.\n\n\"That's our flagship,\" he said."
