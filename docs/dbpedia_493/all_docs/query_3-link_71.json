        "text": "Hooters is set to close dozens of stores over the next few months.\n\nThe restaurant chain known for its chicken wings, cold beer, and of course, the Hooters girls abruptly shuttered nearly 40 restaurants around the country, including at least two in Alabama.\n\nThe company confirmed the closures to Nation’s Restaurant News on June 24 in a statement:\n\n“Like many restaurants under pressure from current market conditions, Hooters has made the difficult decision to close a select number of underperforming stores. Ensuring the well-being of our staff is our priority in these rare instances. With new Hooters restaurants opening domestically and internationally, new Hooters frozen products launching at grocery stores, and the Hooters footprint expanding into new markets with both company and franchise locations, this brand of 41 years remains highly resilient and relevant. We look forward to continuing to serve our guests at home, on the go and at our restaurants here in the U.S. and around the globe.”\n\nYou can see a complete list of Hooters locations that have closed here.\n\nHooters joins a growing list of restaurant chains that are closing underperforming locations. In May, Red Lobster abruptly closed 50 stores. At the beginning of April, Cracker Barrel closed four restaurants located in California, Oregon, and South Carolina. The central Florida-based restaurant chain Tijuana Flats filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month and will be closing 11 of its restaurants, according to a release from the company."
