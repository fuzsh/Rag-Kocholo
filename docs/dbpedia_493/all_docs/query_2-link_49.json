        "text": "Hooters is the latest restaurant chain to close dozens of locations nationwide because of economic challenges such as increasing food and labor costs.\n\n“Like many restaurants under pressure from current market conditions, Hooters has made the difficult decision to close a select number of underperforming stores,” Hooters told MassLive in an email statement Wednesday.\n\nWhile the company did not release a list of affected stores, USA Today reported that at least 44 “underperforming” Hooters restaurants have been permanently closed in 14 states, including Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.\n\nWith locations in Dedham, Saugus, West Springfield and Shrewsbury, no Hooters closings in Massachusetts have been reported.\n\nHooters is a casual restaurant typically associated with beer, wings and servers wearing tight tank tops. Despite the closures, Hooters said the 41-year-old brand “remains highly resilient and relevant” with plans to open new restaurants domestically and internationally as well as the launch of new Hooters frozen products at grocery stores.\n\n“We look forward to continuing to serve our guests at home, on the go and at our restaurants here in the U.S. and around the globe,” the company said.\n\nHooters’ menu prices increased 0.4% at restaurants from April to May, CNN reported, citing inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The increase in prices has pushed customers to stop eating out and has negatively impacted the food service’s reputation for affordability.\n\nHooters is not the only restaurant chain that has suffered the consequences of higher expensives. Applebee’s, TGI Fridays, bankrupt Red Lobster have all closed restaurants this year, as well."
