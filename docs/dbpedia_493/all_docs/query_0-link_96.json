        "text": "San Antonio, TX – June 24, 2024 – Hooters at the RiverWalk’s Shops at the River Center unexpectedly closed its doors on Sunday, June 23, 2024. The closure is part of a nationwide strategy by the restaurant chain, which will see 40 underperforming locations shut down across the United States.\n\nIn a statement released by the company, Hooters cited underperforming metrics as the primary reason for the closures. Additionally, rising food and labor costs have contributed significantly to the decision. These economic pressures have made it difficult for the chain to sustain operations at certain locations.\n\n“While it is always a difficult decision to close any location, these measures are necessary to ensure the long-term health of our business,” a Hooters spokesperson stated. “We are committed to providing our customers with the best experience possible and will continue to focus our efforts on our remaining locations.”\n\nDespite the closure of the popular downtown spot, Hooters will continue to serve its San Antonio patrons at four other area locations. These include:\n\n– Hooters North Star, located at 9803 San Pedro Ave\n\n– Hooters Medical Center, located at 8503 Broadway St\n\n– Hooters Ingram Park, located at 6030 NW Loop 410\n\n– Hooters Live Oak, located at 13122 I-35 North\n\nThe downtown location at the RiverWalk had been a favorite among both locals and tourists, known for its vibrant atmosphere and scenic views of the river. Its sudden closure has left many regular customers surprised and disappointed.\n\n“Sunday brunch at Hooters on the RiverWalk was a tradition for us,” said local resident Maria Sanchez. “It’s sad to see it go, but I understand the reasons behind it.”\n\nThe company has assured that employees affected by the closure will be offered positions at other nearby Hooters locations where possible. They also expressed gratitude to the staff and customers for their continued support and understanding during this transition.\n\nHooters, founded in 1983, has long been a staple in the casual dining sector, known for its signature wings and laid-back environment. As the company navigates these challenging times, it remains focused on maintaining quality service and food at its remaining establishments.\n\nFor more information on the closures and to find the nearest Hooters location, visit the company’s official website.\n\nContact:\n\nHooters Public Relations\n\nPhone: (800) 601-7883\n\nEmail: info@hooters.com\n\nAbout Hooters:\n\nHooters of America, LLC, is the franchisor and operator of over 400 Hooters restaurants in 28 countries. The first Hooters opened its doors in Clearwater, Florida, in 1983. The company is known for its iconic brand, casual beach-themed ambiance, and signature chicken wings."
