        "text": "Hooters announced that it is closing dozens of restaurants, with several \"underperforming\" locations shutting down permanently. Are the Ohio restaurants safe? Here's what we know.\n\nHooters closes dozens of locations nationwide\n\nAbout 40 restaurants have closed, according to Nation's Restaurant News. The sports bar and grill chain, known for its chicken wings and Hooters Girls, has been around for more than four decades and operated more than 290 Hooters restaurants in 35 states at the end of 2023.\n\nEven with its broad reach, some restaurant goers across the country will have to bid farewell to their local chain for good.\n\nWhile the company did not specify exactly which locations are shutting down or when it would take place, it did note that a \"select number\" of restaurants will close because of the \"pressure from current market conditions,\" the chain said in a statement to USA TODAY. Restaurants in Texas, Florida, Kentucky and Indiana are among the growing number of locations that are on the chopping block.\n\nWave goodbye to wings: Hooters restaurants closing without warning across US, including these 4 in Florida\n\nOhio Hooters locations are safe for now. Where are they?\n\nDespite the downsizing, the handful of Hooters locations in Ohio show no signs of shutting down. Each of the four Ohio locations remain operational and have not been labeled as \"permanently closed\" by Google.\n\nHere are the four Ohio Hooters locations still in operation as the chain downsizes:\n\nDayton: 6851 Miller Lane\n\nMason: 9890 Escort Drive\n\nSpringdale: 12185 Springfield Pike\n\nToledo: 4782 Monroe St.\n\nTwo Hooters in Northern Kentucky also remain operational:\n\nFlorence: 7200 Houston Road\n\nNewport: 301 Riverboat Row\n\nWhere else are Hooters restaurants closing?\n\nOf the 40 Hooters locations nationwide that are closing so far, at least six restaurants have closed in Texas, along with four in Florida, and a few in Kentucky and Indiana.\n\nData platform Technomic Ignite shows that Hooters had 293 restaurants by the end of 2023, a 1.3% decrease from 2022, as reported by Nation's Restaurant News. Not all hope is lost, as the company announced \"new Hooters restaurants opening domestically and internationally, and new Hooters frozen products launching at grocery stores.‚Äù"
