        "text": "The Villages of Florida is about to get a whole lot hotter as Hooters, renowned for its spicy chicken wings and strategically placed owls, has announced the first of three new locations planned for the active adult community.\n\nWith a grand opening planned for early 2025, in a post on LinkedIn, Geno Jarquin, the community’s development director, confirmed the lease has been signed for the first new Hooters in Lake Deaton Plaza at 695 Kristine Way, where it will join Publix, Walgreens and several other eateries already in place.\n\n“The rumors are true,” Jarquin shared to social media. “HMC Hospitality Group is working on due diligence and permitting to build a 4,700 SF restaurant in our shopping center. Excited to see how well they will perform in our market.”\n\nStories by Jennifer Torres\n\nAmid Medicare rift, US Sen. Rick Scott will headline GOP event in The Villages of Florida\n\nFlorida’s $37 billion man joins battle against recreational marijuana\n\n1,000 golf carts reportedly rally for Trump in The Villages of Florida despite tropical tempest\n\nFlorida activates price gouging hotline as tropical threat looms\n\nLast year, the restaurant chain’s original founders, now known as Hooters Management Corp., secured a deal to open three new locations in The Villages and three others in Las Vegas.\n\n“Expanding in states where we have repeated success while entering new prime markets is our recipe for success,” Neil Kiefer, CEO of Hooters Management Corp., said in a statement. “Florida has been a tried-and-true state for many years — the people in The Villages have asked for Hooters, and we are here to deliver. HMC created this brand, evolved it over the last 40 years, and will remain bullish as we grow alongside it.”\n\nThe announcement comes despite reports that Hooters recently shuttered approximately 40 locations across the country, including four Florida restaurants in Gainesville, Lakeland, Orange Park and West Palm Beach.\n\nHowever, those locations were operated by Hooters of America, a separate entity from HMC Hospitality Group, which owns the new Hooters coming to The Villages.\n\nSpecific locations for the two other Hooters set to open in The Villages have yet to be announced."
