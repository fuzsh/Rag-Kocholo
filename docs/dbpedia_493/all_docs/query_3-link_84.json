        "text": "We were already pumped up. Our second album, One Way Home on Sony Records, had a couple of hit singles in the UK, and the venue was packed! We met Roger after the show, and he told us that he was a big fan of our latest records, Nervous Night and One Way Home. He even gave me his phone number and told me to call him any time.\n\nWhen we were back in London three months later, I called Roger and invited him to our gig. Unfortunately, he said he couldn’t come because he was rehearsing for his epic concert, The Wall in Berlin. He told us when we first met that if the Berlin Wall were to come down, he’d play his album, The Wall, at the Potsdamer Platz. I told him that if he needed an opener, he could count on The Hooters. I knew it was a long shot. But what did I have to lose?\n\nAs we all know, 1989 was a year of massive change in Germany. The East and West were to be united. And low and behold, his people called our people three weeks later! He invited us to open and we became a part of the legendary concert and film. You can even see us in the YouTube video. I remember our manager at the time took credit for getting us on the show. I don’t know if my call had anything to do with it. But I was fine with all of it. It was an amazing experience that I will never forget."
