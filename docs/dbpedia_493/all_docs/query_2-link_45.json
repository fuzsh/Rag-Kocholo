For other uses, see Hooters (disambiguation).\n\nHooters is the registered trademark[3] used by two American restaurant chains: Hooters, Inc., based in Clearwater, Florida, and Hooters of America, Inc. based in Atlanta, Georgia, and owned by the private investment firm Nord Bay Capital (with TriArtisan Capital Advisor as its advisor).[4] The Hooters name is a double entendre referring to both a North American slang term for women's breasts and the logo (a bird known for its \"hooting\" calls: the owl).[5]\n\nQuick Facts Company type, Industry ...\n\nClose\n\nThe waiting staff at Hooters restaurants are primarily young women, usually referred to simply as \"Hooters Girls\", whose revealing outfits and sex appeal are played up and are a primary component of the company's image. The company employs men and women as cooks, hosts (at some franchises), busboys, and managers.[6] The menu includes hamburgers and other sandwiches, steaks, seafood entrees, appetizers, and the restaurant's specialty, chicken wings. Almost all Hooters restaurants hold alcoholic beverage licenses to sell beer and wine, and where local permits allow, a full liquor bar. Hooters T-shirts, sweatshirts, and various souvenirs and curios are also sold."
