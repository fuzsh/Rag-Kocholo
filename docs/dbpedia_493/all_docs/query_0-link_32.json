        "text": "Miami Vice Performer\n\nMembers\n\nEric Bazilian (born 1953, lead vocals/guitar/instrumentals)\n\nRob Hyman (born 1950, lead vocasl/keyboards/melodica)\n\nDavid Uosikkinen (born 1956, drums)\n\nJohn Lilley (born 1954, guitar)\n\nFran Smith Jr. (bass)\n\nTommy Williams (guitar/vocals)\n\nActive\n\n1980-1995\n\n2001-present\n\nThe Hooters are an American rock band whose song \"Satellite\" appeared in the episode \"Amen... Send Money\" of the series Miami Vice.\n\nCareer[]\n\nThe Hooters were formed in 1980 with original members Eric Bazilian, Rob Hyman, David Uosikkinen (drums), Bobby Woods (bass) and John Kuzma (guitar), performing their first concert on July 4, 1980 in their home town of Philadelphia. They got a boost from their music being played on their local radio station, WMMR, and played clubs and high schools in the area for nearly three years, culminating with a gig during The Who's farewell tour in 1982, joining Santana and The Clash as opening acts. In 1983 Hyman and Bazilian collaborated with Cyndi Lauper on her debut album, She's So Unusual, resulting in Hyman writing the hit single \"Time After Time.\" Her album became a multi-platinum smash, and the success filtered down to The Hooters, who were picked up by Lauper's record label.\n\nThe group's second album Nervous Night (1985) was a big success and included three Billboard Top 40 singles, \"Day by Day\", \"And We Danced,\" and \"Where Do The Children Go.\" Their opening performance on the Philadelphia stage of the 1985 benefit concert Live Aid brought them international recognition.\n\nTheir third album, One Way Home, featured new members Fran Smith, Jr. (replacing King) and John Lilley (replacing Kuzma) and the hit single \"Satellite.\" In 1989, their third album, Zig Zag, saw little commercial success in the U.S., but their European popularity continued to thrive. In 1990, the band appeared in The Wall Concert staged by Pink Floyd singer Roger Waters (with Sinead O'Connor) and recorded another album, Out of Body, before going on a six-year hiatus in 1995.\n\nIn 2001 the band reformed for what was to be a one-off performance in Philadelphia, celebrating the 20th anniversary of legendary Philadelphia DJ Pierre Robert at WMMR. They returned to touring in Germany in 2003, got together for VH-1 Classic's Decades Live Rock program with Lauper, and recorded a new album, Time Stands Still in 2007. The band continues to tour Europe and play shows in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Hooters released a new album in 2023, supported by a tour of the United States (their first in nearly 30 years) with Rick Springfield."
