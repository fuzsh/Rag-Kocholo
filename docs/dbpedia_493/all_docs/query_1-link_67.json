        "text": "The first Hooters restaurant was opened on October 4, 1983, in Florida. Over the course of 27 years, more than 450 Hooters restaurants have been opened in 29 countries on all continents (except Antarctica), including 7 European countries (the Czech Republic, Austria, Germany, Greece, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). The number of restaurants multiplies rapidly due to franchising – individual franchisees can successfully develop an established concept in the areas known to them. Thanks to this system, Hooters restaurants have currently 25,000 employees and annual revenue of more than $ 1 billion.\n\nIn Hooters restaurants, visitors can enjoy a relaxed atmosphere, it is an ideal setting for watching sports events. The famous chicken wings served with a wide selection of hot sauces are the key to the concept’s global popularity. Our visitors can also look forward to trying other specialities such as burgers, shrimps, grilled meats, popular steaks, traditional soups and fresh salads. Additionally, they can order Pilsner Urquell beer tapped directly from tanks. Besides quality food, drinks and a relaxed atmosphere, Hooters restaurants are defined by the so-called Hooters Girls, our pride and base of the unique environment."
