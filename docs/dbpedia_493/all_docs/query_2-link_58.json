        "text": "It’s no secret that we have some of the best dining options in the Tampa Bay area. And it seems like more and more companies are expanding to the southeast/Florida in general. But there are a handful of really great restaurants that are missing in our area. Whether it’s fast food or a sit-down restaurant, we think these restaurants need to make their way to Tampa.\n\nOne honorary mention that we left off the list is Del Taco. There’s a location in Orlando that we always stop at whenever we go to the theme parks or a concert. Earlier this year the news broke that the Tampa Bay area could possibly be getting several Del Taco locations. But things have been quiet since a press release went out earlier this year. Other big chains that have made their way to Tampa include Dave’s Hot Chicken, Dutch Bros (coming soon), Raising Cane’s, and a few others.\n\nWhen you travel to other states do you try to stick with restaurants you know? Or are you willing to try something new? We’ve tried all the places on our list and have wished we would see a Tampa location open ever since. Even though we always try to eat at local restaurants in Tampa, sometimes it’s easier to order takeout or visit a drive-thru. One of the biggest requests in the Tampa area is In-N-Out. Although some may see the burger chain as over-hyped, we think a Tampa location would do really well. Any places we missed on our list? Feel free to shout it out on social media and maybe we’ll add it! We got our inspiration from Creative Loafing after we noticed a few places on their list have made it to Tampa.\n\nHere Are 5 Restaurants That Need To Open Locations In The Tampa Bay Area"
