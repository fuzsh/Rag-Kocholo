        "text": "For fans seeking Hooters at all hours of the day and night, the crave is over. For the first time ever, Hooters has introduced a line of frozen appetizers and snacks, allowing consumers to bring the iconic taste of Hooters home. Available at Publix Super Markets nationwide, these four new frozen products give fans the opportunity to have Hooters’ world-famous food at their fingertips.\n\nHooters has licensed an impressive selection of wing and boneless chicken styles to suit every taste, complete with Hooters’ signature breading and iconic sauces fans love. These products include:\n\nBBQ Smoked Wings: Smoked chicken wings basted in a rich, smoky BBQ sauce\n\nDry Rub Smoked Wings: Smoked chicken wings basted in a bold Texas-style BBQ rub\n\nBuffalo Style Boneless Wingz: Breaded chicken in a tangy buffalo style sauce\n\nBuffalo Style Popcorn Chicken: Breaded chicken in a tangy buffalo style sauce\n\nHooters’ licensed food partner, Golden West Food Group, is launching these first four offerings in the frozen food section of Publix Super Markets, one of the largest supermarket chains in the U.S., with 1,376 stores in eight states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nPublix Super Markets and its Instacart affiliates will offer these four consumer packaged products for in-store shopping and local delivery. These items can be easily heated in home ovens or air fryers to replicate several favorite dishes of the restaurant experience. The suggested retail price of each product, ranging from 12 oz. to 16 oz., varies from $7.49 to $8.99.\n\n“Whether it’s an easy meal at home, or planning food on the go, consumers now have another way to enjoy the world-famous taste of Hooters, with these new frozen appetizers and snacks,” said Hooters of America CMO Bruce Skala.\n\nAdditional retail chains are expected to distribute Hooters’ frozen appetizers and snacks later this year, with a total of eight branded licensed products anticipated to be available by the end of 2024."
