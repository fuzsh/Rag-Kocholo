        "text": "HOOTERS has gained itself a controversial reputation since opening up its first restaurant over four decades ago.\n\nThe Atlanta-based sports bar chain is infamous for its use of female servers in racy outfits but it has recently been forced to shut down a number of \"under performing\" stores - here's the full list of closures.\n\nWhen are Hooters restaurants closing?\n\nHooters announced they were abruptly closing down a huge number of stores this week across the US.\n\nSome of the restaurants had already been shut down prior to the official announcement.\n\nSeveral more locked their doors for the final time over the weekend.\n\nIt is unclear on the exact timeline of when any more will close.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to serve our guests at home, on the go and at our restaurants here in the US and around the globe\n\nHooters spokesperson\n\nThe company has also been opening up a number of new locations across the US and internationally.\n\nThey have also focused a lot of time and cash into producing stay-at-home frozen goods for hungry shoppers.\n\nThe Hooters-branded frozen food has taken over grocery stores in the US in recent months.\n\nA Hooters spokesperson told the New York Post: “We look forward to continuing to serve our guests at home, on the go and at our restaurants here in the US and around the globe.\"\n\nWhich Hooters restaurants are closing?\n\nAn exact figure hasn't been announced but reports say up to 45 stores have closed or are set to close in the coming weeks.\n\nHooters, who have over 300 stores worldwide, announced the US closures would take place in over 14 states.\n\nThese include Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Missouri and Georgia among others.\n\nSeveral other states are also facing scrutiny from the Hooters' management looking to cut back on spending.\n\nThe full list of closures can be found below.\n\nThe number of Hooters have dropped by 12% since 2018, according to restaurant consulting firm Technomic.\n\nRepresentatives from Hooters said the closures didn't reflect the chain's decline in quality or popularity.\n\nThey maintained the “brand of 41 years” is still “highly resilient and relevant”.\n\nWhy are some Hooters restaurants closing?\n\nHooters announced they are closing a range of “under performing stores” as inflation continues to batter the US with restaurants reportedly facing heavy losses.\n\nThe famous chain said “pressure from current market conditions” was behind the touch decision to close the unspecified number of stores.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “Like many restaurants under pressure from current market conditions, Hooters has made the difficult decision to close a select number of under performing stores.”\n\nInflation has rocked the restaurant industry in recent years with around one-third of all branded restaurant chains coming out of 2023 with less stores than they started with, according to National Restaurant News.\n\nA recent survey by consultant group KPMG found that 41 per cent of consumers plan to spend less on restaurants this summer compared to last summer.\n\nJust 21 per cent said they would spend more.\n\nDuleep Rodridgo, KPMG’s US consumer and retail sector leader, said in the study: “Consumers are tightening their belts another notch as they hunt for discounts, and even some essentials are being impacted.\n\n“We have already seen a few retailers lower prices, as they look to maintain the balance between their margins and demand.”"
