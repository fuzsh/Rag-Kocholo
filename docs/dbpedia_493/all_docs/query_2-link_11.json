        "text": "Hooters of America (HOA), the parent company of Hooters and Hoots Wings, has further expanded its international footprint by four new restaurants year-to-date.\n\nHOA, a franchisor, and operator of more than 360 Hooters restaurants, has opened two locations in Mexico this year, as well as in Durban, South Africa, and another one in Guatemala.\n\nThe company said that the opening of these new restaurants is part of its overall growth strategy.\n\nHOA Brands chief development officer Michael Arrowsmith said: “We have more than 27 years of international experience, let alone 40 years of being leaders within our industry.\n\n“Our unaided brand awareness is one of the highest in the restaurant industry – there is nobody who does it quite like we do. From being a sought-after destination to offering flexible store models, and simple operations, our franchise opportunity is truly one-of-a-kind.”\n\nThe restaurant brand added that it has two more in development, which are set to open by the end of the year.\n\nKnown for its Hooters Style chicken wings, Hooters currently has a presence in 17 countries across the globe.\n\nThe company noted that its global locations also provide localised offerings on each menu.\n\nIn May this year, Hooters signed a six-unit agreement with the brand’s original founders, which is now called Hooters Management Corporation (HMC).\n\nUnder the agreement, three units were planned for the Las Vegas area and another three for The Villages neighbourhood in Central Florida."
