        "text": "The sports bar known for its cropped white shirts and orange hot wings is closing locations nationwide, including the Capital City.\n\nHooters on Horizon Drive in Springfield shuttered its doors Sunday morning, joining 39 other locations which closed across the U.S. in a massive company downsize, according to The U.S. Sun.\n\nThe restaurant is listed online now as permanently closed, has been removed from the official Hooters website and the local Facebook page for the bar is gone.\n\nIt is unclear how many jobs were impacted at the Springfield location.\n\nMore: Fruit flies, expired condiments, mold found in Springfield-area kitchens in May\n\nAccording to Hooters, the brand operates more than 420 locations across 29 countries, with 294 locations before the end of last week—making these closures a 13.6% decline in stores.\n\nAll remaining locations in Illinois are listed on Hooters’ website, so fans of the saucy wings can still find a location, even if the closest is technically in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nLatest corporate closing\n\nHooters joins other chain brands like Red Lobster, who filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, in this recent go of corporate closings; the restaurants are suffering from lower in-person traffic to locations while managing rising food and operating costs.\n\nOne of the multiple reasons leading this round of corporate closures is foot traffic. Post-COVID, app culture for delivery has become normal for many consumers who used the phone applications to order food straight-to–door during the pandemic.\n\nThe apps were a vital lifeline for businesses who had to shut doors initially, but over time the business model of multi-billion dollar apps like DoorDash and Grubhub which charge a punitive 20 to 30 percent commission rates for every order.\n\nThe apps defer fees to restaurants instead of waiving them, while affecting the amount of foot traffic coming through doors into sit-down restaurants.\n\nClaire Grant writes about business, growth and development and other news topics for the State Journal-Register.
