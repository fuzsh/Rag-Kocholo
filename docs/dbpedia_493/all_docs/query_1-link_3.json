To date, Hooters has raised more than four million dollars to benefit the V Foundation and the fight against breast cancer.\n\nIn addition, the Hooters Community Endowment Fund raises money for important local and national charities like the Make-A-Wish Foundation, U.S.O., Special Olympics, American Diabetes Association, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association."
