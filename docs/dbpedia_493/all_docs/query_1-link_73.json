        "text": "Hooters restaurants were once scattered throughout Michigan, but unfortunately, that is no longer the case.\n\nSee Also: When Will Michigan See the Rollout of Automated Speeding Tickets?\n\nWhile Hooters thrives in certain states, Michigan is not among them. Over the past decade, the Hooters franchise has bid farewell to cities across the state. The Grand Rapids location shut its doors in 2012, followed by the Lansing branch in 2019, and most recently, the Roseville Hooters closed its doors for good in 2021.\n\nHow Many Hooters Restaurants Are Still in Michigan?\n\nMichigan has only three open and operational Hooters locations.\n\nMichigan Hooters Locations:\n\nHooters - Miller Road in Flint\n\nHooters - Bay Street in Saginaw\n\nHooters - Eureka Road in Taylor\n\nI was convinced that the Flint location wouldn't make it through the pandemic, but surprisingly, they managed to overcome the many challenges. I hit up Hooters in Flint every once in a while. It's always fun to grab the guys and drop by every now and then.\n\nHow many Hooters locations are there in the United States in 2023?\n\nIn 2023, slightly over 300 Hooters locations remain operational, marking a notable decrease from the 2018 count of over 400. The majority of Hooters establishments are concentrated in Texas (54), Florida (49), and Georgia (20).\n\nAccording to Global Franchise, Hooters has 91 restaurants outside the United States in places like Europe, South Africa, Russia, Central and Latin America, Australia, and Asia. In 2017, they opened new restaurants in four countries: Lithuania, Spain, Indonesia, and Bolivia."
