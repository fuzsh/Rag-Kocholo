Here's the national list\n\nWhy are Hooters locations closing?\n\nIn an emailed statement to The Sun, Hooters attributed the closing to the \"current market conditions.\"\n\n\"Ensuring the well-being of our staff is our priority in these rare instances,\" the email read. \"With new Hooters restaurants opening domestically and internationally, new Hooters frozen products launching at grocery stores, and the Hooters footprint expanding into new markets with both company and franchise locations, this brand of 41 years remains highly resilient and relevant. We look forward to continuing to serve our guests at home, on the go and at our restaurants here in the U.S. and around the globe.\""
