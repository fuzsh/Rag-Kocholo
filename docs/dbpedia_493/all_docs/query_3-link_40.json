        "text": "By Tara Lynn Johnson\n\nTo them, I'm a blurry face among thousands they've played for. To me, they're my first true love.\n\nThe Hooters are a Philadelphia rock band best known for opening Live Aid in 1985 and for pop hits such as \"And We Danced\" and \"All You Zombies.\" They're my Beatles.\n\nThey enveloped my ears with their happy melodies and catchy lyrics. And they were cute!\n\nI thought of nothing else for years. My obsession, uh, dedication led me to buy every album on vinyl, cassette, and CD; join the fan club; buy every magazine they appeared in; attend every local concert; and memorize minutiae.\n\n\"Where was David born?\" I quizzed my friend Jen.\n\n\"Cheltenham,\" she dutifully answered.\n\n\"Where did Eric and Rob meet?\"\n\n\"University of Pennsylvania,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Aren't they incredible?\" I gushed.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"Gotta go.\"\n\nI wrote them letters, many to my favorite, drummer David Uosikkinen. David, Hi. I play the drums, too. I love you guys, Tara. He answered! Tara, That's cool you play the drums. Thanks for being a fan. Rock on, David.\n\nThey were scheduled to play a local radio station's fourth anniversary. Listeners were invited to send a postcard to win tickets.\n\n\"I'd like some postcards,\" I said to the postal clerk.\n\n\"OK, hon,\" she said and reached for the stack. \"How many?\"\n\n\"Seventy-five,\" I said - the most my $15 weekly allowance would buy.\n\nLicking and sticking my pink address labels and enduring countless tongue paper cuts, I scribbled the station's address 75 times. Mom listened during the day; I glued my ear to the boom box after school.\n\nFor a week, the DJ called someone else's name. Then, one day: \"Tara Johnson, claim your tickets to see the Hooters.\"\n\nI froze. What to do? Call! I grabbed my Princess Phone and pushed the digits as fast as I could.\n\n\"98-FM,\" said the DJ's voice, now in my ear.\n\n\"This is Tara Johnson,\" I said breathlessly.\n\n\"Congratulations, you won! How does that sound?\"\n\n\"Awesome!\" I shrieked.\n\nI walked on air until the day of the concert - my first. When the Hooters bounded onto the stage, my scream melded with a cacophony of other girls' voices, like a zoo of squawking birds and screeching monkeys. I sang with the band all night long.\n\nWeeks later, I went to see them at a record-store event. Mom and I shivered in the November air for hours as the line moved with all the speed of the Schuylkill during rush hour. I thought of what I'd say. \"I love you\" - obviously. \"Your music's amazing\" - positive feedback. \"You're so cute\" - but every girl would say that. \"I'm a musician, too\" - credibility.\n\nWhen security motioned me in, my eyes widened, my heart swelled, and the butterflies in my stomach flapped spastically.\n\n\"Hi, how are you?\" David asked.\n\n\"Fine,\" I said.\n\nI showed him my Hooters scrapbook.\n\n\"Cool,\" he said, and signed it. \"Thanks for coming.\"\n\nI half-waved and grinned goofily. I moved on to Andy King, the bassist and my other favorite, handing him a concert picture that my brother took.\n\n\"Cool,\" he said. \"Is this for me?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Sign.\" Vocabulary, why did you abandon me?\n\n\"OK,\" he said. \"Send me one?\"\n\nAndy wanted mail - from me.\n\n\"Sure,\" I said.\n\n\"Thanks for your support.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, a skipping record.\n\nSoon I found myself in the sunlight. Was it a dream?\n\n\"I met the Hooters,\" I told Mom.\n\n\"Yes, dear. I was there.\"\n\nI met Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman a year later at Charlie's Pizzeria. I had found out they ate there on Tuesdays. The stakeout took a week, and when I finally met them, I managed to form four complete sentences.\n\nIn 1990, I met them all (including their new bassist, Fran Smith Jr.) at a sound check for the Fourth of July concert on the Parkway. As I slid my arm around David's waist for a photo, he put his arm around my shoulder and tangled his fingers in my hair. Swoon.\n\nNow I'm the age the Hooters were when I was young - and thought they were old. Their older songs remind me of who I used to be, and I appreciate the newer ones for their wisdom: \"It's a beautiful day, and I'm happy to say I'm alive.\"\n\nFriday night the Hooters celebrate 30 years together with a concert at the Electric Factory. I can't wait. I and my inner 13-year-old will be there, enjoying the remembrance of a past me and what the band still means to us. If I met them again, I bet I could string a whole paragraph together."
