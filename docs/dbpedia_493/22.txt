Hooters has made the decision to close several stores across the US due to "underperformance", much to the disappointment of customers who are fans of the chain.

Hooters, which has 400 locations across over 30 states in the US, offers famous wings, beer, and other bar-style foods. You will likely be aware that it's also known for its waitresses' revealing uniforms

“Like many restaurants under pressure from current market conditions, Hooters has made the difficult decision to close a select number of underperforming stores. Ensuring the well-being of our staff is our priority in these rare instances,” the company told Nation’s Restaurant News.

“With new Hooters restaurants opening domestically and internationally, new Hooters frozen products launching at grocery stores, and the Hooters footprint expanding into new markets with both company and franchise locations, this brand of 41 years remains highly resilient and relevant. We look forward to continuing to serve our guests at home, on the go and at our restaurants here in the US and around the globe."
