A partir dos dados subministrados pela sua biografia pessoal e da sua trajetória política, assim como da análise de algumas das suas propostas doutrinais, conclui-se que a sua escolha se explica por uma visão de como queria que fosse a sociedade que o rodeava.

        "text": "1. Ibn Ḥazm: Political Problems, Legal Solutions\n\n2. The Emergence of Charisma in al-Andalus: The Religious, Political, and Military contexts\n\n3. The Law and the Qāḍī\n\n22The qāḍīs who gained power during the transitional period between the Almoravids and the Almohads had a precedent in the 5th/11th-century qāḍīs who not only gained power during the disintegration of the Umayyad caliphate (fitna) but even in some cases established local dynasties that were relatively long-lasting, as happened in Silves, Toledo and especially Seville. Let us take a brief look at these two cases, whose protagonists were contemporaries of Ibn Ḥazm and, in the case of Seville, might even have met him in person.\n\n24As for Seville, during the period of Hammudid control, the city’s qāḍī was Abū l-Qāsim Muḥammad b. ʽAbbād (d. 433/1041), whose father, Ismāʽīl (d. 410/1019), had been appointed qāḍī by Almanzor and was a member of a family said to own a third of the lands in Seville. In 414/1023, when the caliph al-Qāsim b. Ḥammūd sought refuge in Seville after having failed in his attempt to take Córdoba, he was denied entry, and the judge Abū l-Qāsim seized power, at first sharing it with other prominent citizens. Later, in 418/1027, a member of the Hammudid dynasty, Yaḥyā b. ʽAlī b. Ḥammūd, tried to capture Seville, and its inhabitants opted not to resist and instead agreed to pay him a large sum of money and recognize his sovereignty in exchange for a promise not to allow the Berbers to enter the city. The Hammudid caliph accepted these terms and requested hostages. The qāḍī Abū l-Qāsim was the only person to respond to this request and handed over his son ʽAbbād, which only enhanced his popularity. The caliph named him governor of Seville, and the city’s inhabitants agreed to obey him. From that point on, he was the true master of the city and stripped power from those who had previously shared it with him, in some cases even expelling them from Seville and confiscating their property. The monies that were no longer paid in tribute to Córdoba were used to raise a mercenary army. In 427/1035, when Yaḥyā b. ʽAlī b. Ḥammūd attempted to reconquer Seville but was defeated and killed, Abū l-Qāsim b. ʽAbbād produced a false Umayyad caliph whom he tried to pass off as Hishām II al-Muʼayyad. He had the Friday sermon given in his name and tried to convince the other Taifas to recognize his rule. This was an attempt to reconstruct the system that had existed under Almanzor. Abū l-Qāsim b. ʽAbbād was succeeded by his son Abū ʽAmr ʽAbbād (433/1042–461/1068), who went by the title of chamberlain (al-ḥājib) – like Almanzor – and later by a quasi-caliphal title, al-Muʽtaḍid; both titles appear on the coins that he minted. The false Hishām died sometime during his reign and his death was kept secret until 452/1060. That year al-Muʽtaḍid ordered his own name to be declared in the Friday sermon. He was succeeded by his son Abū l-Qāsim Muḥammad (461/1068–484/1091), who reigned as al-Muʽtamid and on whose coins al-imām ʽabd Allāh amīr al-muʼminīn is mentioned, which I understand as an acknowledgement of the idea of the caliphate without making explicit which caliph is being referred to. While Ismāʼīl – the qāḍī appointed by Almanzor – had an intellectual background as a faqīh, his son Abū l-Qāsim b. ʽAbbād served in the post more for political reasons than because of his training. In contrast to what happened in Toledo, in this case wealth was more important than ʽilm. Unlike Yaʽīsh, Abū l-Qāsim b. ʽAbbād did not attempt to dictate morals and perhaps for that reason he was able to found a dynasty.\n\n4. Why Ibn Ḥazm Became a Ẓāhirī\n\n26We have seen how Ibn Ḥazm’s anti-charismatic stance can be explained by the context of his times, when the Umayyads’ greatest enemy was the Fatimids, whose caliphate was based on charismatic leadership and Messianism, and when the crisis of Umayyad legitimacy and the development of Muslim society itself encouraged a search for new political and/or religious authority figures. The allure of some of these charismatic figures was based not so much on assuring the implementation and continuity of the Law founded on the Revelation given by God to an Arab prophet – which was fundamentally the model of the Sunni Umayyad caliphate in Córdoba – as on their presenting themselves as inserted into a cosmological worldview that made them a kind of mediators between Creator and creation, as well as on the fact that they seemed to promise various means of communicating with the Divinity. That is precisely why charismatic, messianic, and/or saintly figures had potential for political leadership – as well as military leadership, on account of the devotion that they inspired in their followers – which might not ever materialize, but was always latent. We have also seen how judges – as representatives of rulers who appointed them and linked to the Divinity, since it was they who were charged with implementing a law that had been enacted by God – were also potential political figures. In contrast to the rural spheres of influence of some of the other figures (such as the saints and \"false\" prophets), the political potential of judges was strongest in urban centers, where the figure of the ʽālim– a specialist in religious learning – was also well established. In times of political fragmentation and disorder, the qāḍī of an Andalusi city could come to fill the power vacuum left by the latest failed ruler and even to found a local dynasty. These qāḍīs usually represented the prominent inhabitants of the cities, but they also succeeded in attracting the support of the general population, who saw in them protectors of a political order based on the sacred, as well as loyal enforcers of religious law (sharīʽa), which many Muslims throughout history have seen as a check against the tyranny of rulers precisely because it is a law that was not formulated by them. These qāḍīs assumed titles that were sometimes reminiscent of the caliphs, but they maintained the fiction of ruling in the name of a caliph, though the latter was absent or no one knew exactly who he was.\n\n33The result of all of this is a considerable curtailment not only of what is considered prohibited but also of the social and religious practices regulated by sharīʽa: in Ẓāhirism, the spheres of activity that are free from legal and religious regulation are more numerous than in other legal schools. This fact, in addition to the application of his methodology, often leads Ibn Ḥazm to some conclusions that conflict with other legal schools and others that are rather peculiar, as demonstrated by some of the cases that have been studied. Let us review some of those cases and as we do so I will indicate how Ibn Ḥazm’s doctrinal and legal stance can be linked to the circumstances of his biography.\n\n79 Ibn Ḥazm, Kitāb al-akhlāq wa-l-siyar, translation in M. Abu Laylah, In Pursuit of Virtue…, p. 121-1 (...)\n\n\"I have tried to find one goal, which everyone would agree to be excellent and worthy of being striven after. I have found one only: to be free from anxiety\" .\n\n36All of Ibn Ḥazm’s doctrinal positions that we have discussed conform to this goal of avoiding anxiety. Man must be anxious to gain salvation in the afterlife, but this anxiety will be more manageable the more the sphere of prohibition is minimized and the broader the categories of what is lawful or morally neutral and the greater the possibilities for forgiveness from God for transgressions. From this perspective, Ẓāhirism was an effective alternative to the tendency in Mālikism – and other schools – to widen the categories of prohibition and cause believers who were not religious scholars to be more anxious about their fate. Such believers would be overwhelmed not only by their own lack of knowledge about the minutiae of what was right and wrong but also by the fact that decisions about right and wrong had been put in the hands of a group of \"specialists\"."
