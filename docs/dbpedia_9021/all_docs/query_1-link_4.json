        "text": "They could have develop into a state like the Taifa of Zaragosa but for me the main question would derived from the very nature of the Banu Qasi.\n\nIf they feel that despiste their efforts they would be defeated by the northern Iberian christian states would they become christian again just to keep their power and whealt?\n\nAnd if they become christian again would they enforce convertion or just increase taxes on non christians but avoid practices that Otl weakened the Kingdom of Aragon like the forced displacement of the highily qualifed muslim farmers ?\n\nI my alternative history I have them conquered the southern part of the kindom of Pamplona incluiding the capital and all the modern Aragon providence plus the western part of Catalonia by 950, plus founding a knights Templar order analogue to keep their bases secured,\n\nthe christians states are unified under the kingdom of Asturias which maintain an alliance with the banu qasi for mutual benefit and the caliphate of Córdoba is stating to fracture and the kingdom of Aquitane controls a small part of southeastern Spain (rest of Catalonia) but it is losing wars against the banu qasi (the 3 wars in the last 30 Years)\n\nI my alternative history I have them conquered the southern part of the kindom of Pamplona incluiding the capital and all the modern Aragon providence plus the western part of Catalonia by 950, plus founding a knights Templar order analogue to keep their bases secured,\n\nthe christians states are unified under the kingdom of Asturias which maintain an alliance with the banu qasi for mutual benefit and the caliphate of Córdoba is stating to fracture and the kingdom of Aquitane controls a small part of southeastern Spain (rest of Catalonia) but it is losing wars against the banu qasi (the 3 wars in the last 30 Years)\n\nSomething that I almost used in some of my threads is taking advantage of Navarro-Aragonese language that was strong back then and establish some sort of Navarro - Aragonese Commonwealth that turns it's back to the Mediterranean and it's deeply connected to the Atlantic world thru the ports on the Bay of Biscay.\n\nTo the east Catalonia and latter Valencia and the Balearic islands are incorporated into the Crown of Occitania, committed to expand it's territory in western Mediterranean and eventually gaining control first over Eastern Occitania reaching Northern Italy and then over Western Occitania establishing a strong state from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean.\n\nTo the west, the Kingdom of Leon encompasses Otl Portugal, Galiza, Leon, Asturias, Castille (old and new) and western Andalucia and a succession of monarchs favors the establishment of a prestige dialect of the Astur-Leonese language as the language used the administration of the kingdom.\n\nIn eastern Andalucia and Murcia , Andalusi Romance along with Andalusi Arabic we're used and what remained of Al-Andalus became increasingly dependent and connected to the northern african kingdoms and was well on its way to become fully arabized with most of the romance speaking christians moving north and many arabized berbers migrating from Africa to areas in southeast Iberia.\n\nSomething that I almost used in some of my threads is taking advantage of Navarro-Aragonese language that was strong back then and establish some sort of Navarro - Aragonese Commonwealth that turns it's back to the Mediterranean and it's deeply connected to the Atlantic world thru the ports on the Bay of Biscay.\n\nTo the east Catalonia and latter Valencia and the Balearic islands are incorporated into the Crown of Occitania, committed to expand it's territory in western Mediterranean and eventually gaining control first over Eastern Occitania reaching Northern Italy and then over Western Occitania establishing a strong state from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean.\n\nTo the west, the Kingdom of Leon encompasses Otl Portugal, Galiza, Leon, Asturias, Castille (old and new) and western Andalucia and a succession of monarchs favors the establishment of a prestige dialect of the Astur-Leonese language as the language used the administration of the kingdom.\n\nIn eastern Andalucia and Murcia , Andalusi Romance along with Andalusi Arabic we're used and what remained of Al-Andalus became increasingly dependent and connected to the northern african kingdoms and was well on its way to become fully arabized with most of the romance speaking christians moving north and many arabized berbers migrating from Africa to areas in southeast Iberia.\n\nI have the kingdom of Aragón adopt the aragonese language and culture as way for them to differentiate from the rest of iberian kingdoms and have the banu qasi consolidate in aragon. Also they could have promoted the more lax interpretation of islam in their lands to the point that it becomes its own like for example druze or alawism to consolídate power in their territory and have amiacable relation with their Christian neighborhoods.\n\nAs for expansion they go mainly to catalonia and the balears, maybe conquering Corsica and sardinia (both are isolated in relative terms from the rest of europa and are easy enough to defend them if you get quickly there).\n\nValencia and the hinterlands of Spain are a no go as long as the Córdoba caliphate remains strong, through after it collapses is anyone guess who takes it, but the colapse would happen either in the end of the 11 century or middle 12 century.\n\nThe thing is that by the year 1000 the Banu Qasi already control the whole spanish March, except for the northern part of Navarra and all the pyrenaic region so no easy way to launch a crusade against they territories while the banu qasi can launch a jihad for the Southern parts of France much easier.\n\nOne thing that happens would be carolingians consolidating control over the modern French territory in a more centralize empire style ruling than the feudal order due to the potential expansionist threat of the banu qasi (after all they did lost the Spanish March when the kingdom fragmented upon succession before beign reunited again by the same means.\n\nWould be interesting how a much more centralized medieval French kingdom acts.\n\nWould they still make a go for Sicily and Ifriqiya like the OTL Christians once they have the Catalan/Valencian coast? These places ended up being under the Aragonese crown (Ifriqiya only briefly) OTL and both are good for being Latinized as Sicily has been OTL without giving up Islam. How about Sardinia (I don't think it was ever Muslim)?\n\nTheir Basque vassals might lend them a helping hand on settling territories beyond the \"Ocean of Darkness\" (Atlantic).\n\nDepends if they get the coast (Barcelona?) and the navy is a throw stone away\n\nProbably not, they might be more invested in peninsular politics\n\nAlso possible\n\nThat kinda depend, they mostly interact with the caliphate as an ally against the French and northern Christian kingdom, but avoid longterm entanglements if it comes fighting other muslims in the peninsula, through outside of it they are fair game for conquest like the North Africa coast.\n\nSicilia too, but Maybe the normans would a little too much, specially if they can get outside help like the Christian crusaders, the commercial routes might make it worth it through, especially if the kingdom of Aragon can act as a link between Europe and the Muslim powers in the Middle East, more so after the battle of manziker."
