        "text": "Pamplona\n\nThe city known throughout the world for its famous festivals of San Fermin features a really well preserved medieval old quarter. Its centre is the Plaza del Ayuntamiento, next to which is the tourist office and from where you can easily reach the main monuments and points of interest. The cathedral should not be missed for a number of reasons: its Gothic cloister is one of the best in Europe in its style; from the tower, you will get a unique view of the city; and if you go with children, they will love its “children's cathedral” and discovering the bells hidden in its panels. You also can visit the Museum of Navarre or, if you prefer contemporary art, leave the old town to explore the Museum of the University of Navarre.Spare some time to walk around the Renaissance walls, which extend over five kilometres. The tour of the walled enclosure unveils such beautiful places as the Rincón del Caballo Blanco viewpoint, skirts round the old town and goes on to reach two of the city's green areas: the Taconera park (the oldest in Pamplona), and the Citadel, whose fortress has become a venue for exhibitions and cultural activities. At lunchtime, you have to try the pinchos, delicious miniature morsels. In the downtown area, you will find many options and a good atmosphere in the traditional streets of Estafeta, San Nicolás, Comedias and Mercaderes. Plaza del Castillo is also another perfect place to enjoy the flavours of good Navarre cuisine.\n\nTudela\n\nJust half an hour by car from the semi-desert of Bardenas Reales, Tudela will surprise you with such great monumental heritage in a small city. Its streets, churches, palaces and other buildings show the mixture of cultures that it has experienced throughout its history. Be sure to visit its Gothic Cathedral, a mix of Gothic and Romanesque styles, with its beautiful cloister and three imposing doorways. You can also visit the best Renaissance palace in Navarre (Marqués de San Adrián) or one of the most representative examples of Romanesque style in Navarre: the church of La Magdalena. Strolling through the alleys of the Judería Nueva quarter or sitting outside the cafés at Plaza de los Fueros are other unmissable stops of a getaway to Tudela. If you are a fan of urban art, you are in luck: in Tudela, you can take a route to discover the great murals and works of important graffiti artists who have transformed some corners of the city during the Avant Garde Tudela international festival. And when it's time to sit down to eat, don't hesitate to think about vegetable dishes: artichokes, asparagus, lettuce hearts, tomatoes, stew... Vegetables are the real stars in Tudela, and have their own festivals in spring.\n\nEstella-Lizarra\n\nEstella is located just over 40 kilometres from Pamplona, and it is immediately clear that it is a city marked by the Camino de Santiago. Pilgrims, churches, symbols, palaces, bridges... In Estella-Lizarra, the Jacobean atmosphere is everywhere and forms part of its charm. Two of its most outstanding monuments, both from the 12th century, are located in the Plaza de San Martín, a key point on the route as it passes through the town: the church of San Pedro de la Rúa, with a Romanesque cloister and a wealth of sculptures, and the Palace of the Kings of Navarre, seat of the Gustavo de Maeztu Museum. Another Romanesque jewel is the church of San Miguel. At the beginning of September, it becomes the stage of the city's Early Music Festival. But there is still a lot to see, like the façade of the church of El Santo Sepulcro and the church of Santa María Jus del Castillo, where the old synagogue was located. And if you take a quiet stroll, you will find beautiful palaces, houses and stately mansions. Don't forget the Los Llanos park, the city's main green area. If walking makes you hungry, no problem. There are great dishes to choose from: seasonal vegetables, ajoarriero, white beans, lamb in chilindrón… For dessert, Idiazabal cheese or sweets such as almond-paste “alpargatas”, bonbons “rocas del Puy” and “sanchicos” filled bonbons, for the perfect end to a meal."
