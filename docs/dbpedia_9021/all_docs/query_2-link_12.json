The purpose of the research is to move beyond the conventional focus on Catharism and its attendant heresy in order to examine the martial endeavors of the northern crusaders led by Simon IV de Montfort against Raymond VI of Toulouse and the southern forces. A comparative model is applied to the discussion and analysis of a number of sieges, field battles and descriptions of atrocities committed during the crusade. Light is shed on the difficulties faced by Montfort in waging a war in hostile territory and reveals a set of contrasts and similarities between military engagements along with a shift of intent from the original aim of the expedition designed to root out heresy, to private ambitions consisting of territorial aggrandizement and the acquisition of power.\n\nDedication: I dedicate this work to my parents whose encouragement and support motivated me to return to school to pursue my education. This work is also dedicated to my lovely fiancée, Natalya, whose patience and understanding were always present even during the many days I chose to remain at home to study.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nWar was an endemic constituent of the Middle Ages. A veritable plethora of battles and sieges dotted the European landscape for centuries and the practice of war was continually refined as were the instruments used to wield it. The era of the High Middle Ages (c. AD 1000-1300) witnessed some of the most decisive and influential battles in all of history. From Hastings to Hattin and from Courtrai to Las Navas de Tolosa, the political, economic, religious and cultural aspects of Europe were forever altered.\n\nIndelibly intertwined with warfare and medieval society were religious beliefs. The Roman Catholic Church, the immovable bastion of Latin Christendom, pervaded, like war, every aspect of society from politics, to economics, to cultural phenomena. From kings to the lowliest serfs, the people of the High Middle Ages were imbued with the mores of Christianity, guided daily by its precepts and subject to the rulings and whims of the Church. Indeed, no other institution may be considered to have had as much impact upon Western society in the Middle Ages than the Catholic Church; and nowhere was this more apparent than during the age of the crusades.[1]\n\nThe High Middle Ages encapsulated, and were defined by, two centuries of religious warfare in the form of the crusades. From 1095 to 1291, the crusades were primarily directed towards the Middle East in an attempt to wrest the Holy Land from the clutches of Islam. Religious fervor fueled a crusading spirit that gripped Latin Christendom and would cause the protraction of a series of wars fought in the name of God or Allah. These wars continued beyond the period of the Middle Ages into the Renaissance and up to modern times. Today, the revival of Jihad, or Holy War, by Muslims worldwide hearkens to a period when Christian and Muslim fought valiantly for their beliefs.[2]\n\nAlthough the focus of much scholarship on the crusades in recent decades has been on those directed to the Levant, the continent of Europe was deeply imbued with crusading zeal. The Reconquista pitted the Spanish kings against the invading Muslims while the Teutonic knights brought the crusades to the doorstep of the pagans of northeastern Europe.[3] The Albigensian Crusade is one of the lesser-known crusades once sequestered to what is now present-day southern France. Akin to larger crusades to the East, the Albigensian Crusade was aimed at eradicating a population that did not conform to the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church. The Church employed its influence and the vast resources at its disposal to suppress and ultimately destroy Catharism, a heresy dating back to the first century AD. The heresy centered primarily on dualism, a concept acknowledging the existence of two separate gods as opposed to the monotheistic belief espoused by the Church. Adherents to this religion were known as Cathars, and during the crusade as Albigensians, named after the city of Albi, considered a hotbed of heresy. The monk Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay, author of one of the most valuable histories of the Albigensian Crusade, professes that “the general term ‘Albigensians’ is used…to refer to the heretics of Toulouse and other cities and towns, and their defenders, since this is the name which came to be used by outsiders to refer to all the heretics of the South.”[4]\n\nFrom 1209-1229, the Catholic Church was engaged in a war against heretics and the nobles who harbored them. This war began as a sincere attempt to cauterize the wound of heresy that had plagued the south for centuries but quickly devolved into a political war of conquest and land seizure.[5] For two decades, the Albigensian Crusade wreaked havoc on the political, cultural, and economic spheres of Languedoc, the region of present-day southern France where Catharism flourished. The noble efforts of the Catholic Church to subdue the Cathars by military means proved fruitless and the task eventually fell to the Inquisition beginning in the third decade of the thirteenth century. Curiously, the Inquisition, acting as a less violent extension of the Church’s power in Languedoc, was far more successful in rooting out and effectively destroying heresy than the crusading armies ever were.[6]\n\nThe threat of Catharism had been brewing in Languedoc since the middle of the twelfth century. Unlike the more militaristic character of northern France, Languedoc was culturally more advanced, its inhabitants endowed with “advanced education, cosmopolitan tastes, and cultural elitism” and less inclined to military endeavors.[7] Commerce flourished, the songs of troubadours filled its courts, and the native literature was ripe with stories of love and courtship.[8] Culturally, Languedoc had stronger ties to the realms of Navarre, Aragon and Italy than to the kingdom of northern France. Politically fractious, the counts and nobles of Languedoc formed a loose conglomerate of disparate brethren united by fragile alliances. Economically, the people of Languedoc prospered by trading heavily with Spain, Italy and northern France. Religiously, they formed a motley group of Catharist supporters, some of whom were members of the faith, while others were simply advocates of the religion living peacefully alongside its adherents.\n\nTo Pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216), Catharism had become more than a nuisance; it threatened the very existence, ubiquity and legitimacy of the Catholic Church and its abettors would receive no mercy.[9] Islam was a religion far removed from Christianity, politically, culturally and ethnically. Notwithstanding their presence in Spain since the early eighth century, Muslims occupied the territories of Outremer and beyond, lands where the influence of Christian thought was minimal, if entirely absent. Their skin was darker, they spoke a different language, practiced different customs and had little contact with those of the Latin West. These glaring distinctions made Muslims easy targets of the crusades. Their occupation of the Holy Land, the very heartland of Christianity and birthplace of Jesus-Christ, became anathema to Christians and acted as the impetus for the launching of these holy wars.[10]\n\nCatharism inherently presented a much more recondite and hazardous menace to the Catholic Church. Burrowed deep within the political and cultural framework of Languedoc, and protected by the nobles and seigneurs of the region, Catharism was less distinguishable and thus more difficult to extinguish than Islam. Its resemblance to Christianity and its longevity made Catharism an especially notorious enemy in the eyes of the Church-in effect, the roots of Catharism date back to the first century AD. The religion was of a Manichean nature and in many ways its followers believed themselves to be morally superior to Christians. The latter half of the twelfth century was rife with doctrinal conflict and any attempts to bring Cathars into the Christian fold and to excise the religion from Languedoc in a peaceful manner were in vain. The preaching crusades to Languedoc met with little enthusiasm and debates between Catholic and Cathar leaders over the doctrinal intricacies of their respective faiths only served to strengthen the heretics’ resolve. The futility of religious and political diplomacy coupled with the crusading zeal of the day is what set the wheels of military imperative in motion.[11]\n\nInnocent III used the opportunity afforded to him by his newly appointed pontificate to wield his powers of persuasion and raise a crusading army to eradicate heresy from Languedoc. The menace to the Church had been brewing for decades and the steady increase in the number of Cathar converts only served to undermine Innocent’s authority over the temporal and spiritual spheres of Christendom. The pope, drawing upon a biblical passage in Song of Solomon, referred to heretics as “the little foxes which are ruining the vineyard of the Lord.”[12] Despite this, Catharism never posed an organized or united threat to the Church.[13] But as supreme pontiff Innocent no doubt felt the urgency of the predicament and acted accordingly. The first decade of his pontificate was spent planning for and conducting from afar a new crusade to the Levant. The Fourth Crusade (1202-1204) ended calamitously with the sacking of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 1204. It would take another five years of impassioned preaching against Cathars in Languedoc for Innocent to finally resign himself to the use of military force.\n\nMilitary force was also necessary to subdue those who merely harbored heretics, but were not Cathars themselves. The Count of Toulouse, Raymond VI, had been the most powerful noble of Languedoc whose territories extended over a large portion of the region. His dealings with papal legates often ended in bitter dispute. Raymond considered himself a devout Catholic but saw little incentive in attempting to root out heresy from his lands. For generations, his forbears lived peacefully amongst Cathars despite the admonitions of the Church. When asked by Bishop of Fulk why the Cathars had not been expelled from Languedoc, Pons Adhémar of Roudeille, a southern knight, replied: “We cannot; we were brought up with them, there are many of our relatives amongst them, and we can see that their way of life is a virtuous one.”[14] The increasingly hostile atmosphere between the nobles of Languedoc and the pope concerning heresy needed but a spark to ignite the flame. That spark came with the death of the papal legate Peter of Castelnau in January 1208 following a meeting with Raymond VI. Although strongly suspected as an accomplice in the murder, Raymond was never convicted. Nonetheless, this proved to be the final straw for Innocent who up to this point refrained from resorting to military means. A papal bull was issued calling the Christian faithful to partake in the new crusade in Languedoc and offering them the lands of the heretics. An indulgence was promised in return for a mere forty day of required military service. This was enough to draw thousands from all over Western Europe to take up the cross. The crusaders willingly took up arms and met in northern France before marching south.[15]\n\nThe Albigensian Crusade began as a genuine attempt by the Catholic Church to subdue Cathars. Along the way, the military efforts of those involved shifted from rooting out heretics to acquiring territory and procuring political clout. The leader of the crusade was a devout French noble by the name of Simon IV de Montfort who, according to Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay, was “eager to set about a task, tireless in completing it, and totally dedicated to the service of God.”[16] Montfort had participated in the first leg of the Fourth Crusade but quickly abandoned it once it was diverted to Christian rather than Muslim lands. Montfort’s strong leadership and tenacity proved he was vital to the expedition in Languedoc as an instrument of the Church. From success to success, Montfort’s military endeavors strengthened the temporal arm of the Church in the region.[17] Heretics were sought out, burned or converted to Catholicism, and crusading forces occupied the lands of nobles who protected them. However, as time wore on Montfort’s personal ambitions began to shine through under the guise of his religious fervor. Indeed, his military successes spurred him to aggrandize his territory in Languedoc at the expense of southern nobles and with the backing of the Church. From 1209-1218, warfare was the only constant in the region of Languedoc and the religious turmoil that sparked the war had transformed into the personal agenda of one man.\n\nThe influence of the French Crown would make itself known near the end of the crusade with the involvement of Prince Louis VIII. Inadvertently, Montfort had laid the political and military groundwork for the crown to make subjugation of Languedoc a reality. Even though the Albigensian Crusade failed to destroy the heresy, the political and cultural landscape of southern France had been drastically altered, the Crown being the primary beneficiary. The crusade directly extended French royal power into Languedoc and the Mediterranean. This signaled the end of the region of Languedoc and the beginnings of a united and powerful kingdom of France in the mid-thirteenth century.[18]\n\nThe methods of warfare employed by the crusaders and the southern nobles were typical of the day. Siege warfare prevailed in the High Middle Ages prior to the widespread use of gunpowder weapons. The Albigensian Crusade aptly fit this description as it consisted mostly of sieges against fortified towns and cities throughout Languedoc. These sieges were predominantly conducted against the southern forces by the crusaders, although southerners did attempt several of their own in retaliation. The scarcity of field battles is also typical of this era. The inordinate amount of attention paid to field battles of the Middle Ages in recent scholarship often tends to downplay the efficacy and pervasive practice of siege warfare that made up the majority of military campaigns. The field battles of Hastings, Hattin, Manzikert and Bouvines were decisive and altered the course of history. Nonetheless, to relegate the study of poliorcetics (the art of siege warfare) in the High Middle Ages to a secondary role in terms of military importance is to neglect the impact sieges had on the outcome of wars of this era. The battle of Muret in 1213 is one of the most prominent field battles of the High Middle Ages and the only major field engagement that occurred during the Albigensian Crusade. It was decisive but no less significant than the myriad sieges whose outcome guided the trajectory of the crusade.[19]\n\nGiven the extensive scholarship on the Albigensian Crusade with a singular focus on the Cathar heresy, this work will approach the crusade from a military perspective within a comparative model. The heretical characteristics and doctrinal differences espoused by the Cathars have been generously documented in recent work but little has been done to bring to light the many sieges, field battles and brutal atrocities fundamental to such an expedition. These took place over two decades and left their painful imprint on the crusade. The dearth of secondary sources on the martial aspects of the crusade is intriguing in view of the high level detail concerning the military efforts of both sides provided in the primary sources.\n\nSecondary Sources\n\nThe secondary sources dedicated to the Albigensian Crusade often approach the topic from a broader perspective, seeking to encompass the entirety of the expedition and its concomitant issues. In an effort to be comprehensive, these authors have usually set their scholarly vision beyond a narrow military analysis of the crusade in order to understand the religious, political and cultural tensions that defined it. Joseph Strayer, in his book The Albigensian Crusades (1971), discusses a few of the campaigns of the crusade but devotes several chapters to the Cathar heresy, the region of Languedoc and the Inquisition. Jonathan Sumption provides a more thorough account of the expedition in his work The Albigensian Crusade (1978), but again his agenda is simply to tell the story of the crusade from beginning to end rather than to focus on the sieges and battles that occurred. In Massacre at Montségur (2001), Zoé Oldenbourg addresses some of the campaigns but consigns the military details to a very small portion of her book. A Most Holy War: The Albigensian Crusade and the Battle for Christendom (2008), written by Mark Gregory Pegg, appeared at first glance to be a work dedicated solely to the war efforts of the crusade but the author’s underlying agenda to prove that “the crusade ushered genocide into the West, changing forever what it meant to be Christian”[20] was tinged with a strong religious and moral bias. Walter L. Wakefield’s book Heresy, Crusade and Inquisition in Southern France, 1100-1250 (1974) deals with some of the military aspects of the crusade but its chronological frame of reference is much too broad and the majority of the work is taken up by a discussion of the heresy and the Inquisition.\n\nSecondary works whose focal point is solely on the Cathar heresy treat the war almost as a sideshow to the religious conflict between Catholics and Cathars. Some of these include Sean Martin’s The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages (2004) and Michael Costen’s The Cathars and the Albigensian Crusade (1997). From their titles, it is evident that the primary aim of these texts is to discuss the heresy and this is made clear as each book dedicates merely one chapter to the crusade itself. Malcolm Barber’s The Cathars: Dualist Heretics in Languedoc in the High Middle Ages (2000), Malcolm Lambert’s The Cathars (1998), Stephen O’Shea’s The Perfect Heresy: The Revolutionary Life and Death of the Medieval Cathars (2001) and Aubrey Burl’s God’s Heretics: The Albigensian Crusade (2001) all depict the centrality of heresy in the Albigensian Crusade but to the detriment of the military engagements.\n\nThere exist, however, a few articles concerned with the militaristic endeavors of the Albigensian Crusade. In The Albigensian Crusades: Wars Like Any Other?(2001), Malcolm Barber opined that the Albigensian Crusade “went far beyond the normal conventions of early thirteenth-century warfare in the scale of the slaughter.”[21] French scholars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Marcel Dieulafoy and Joseph de Malafosse devoted their articles to the battle of Muret and the siege of Toulouse, respectively. Laurence W. Marvin’s article War in the South: A First Look at Siege Warfare in the Albigensian Crusade, 1209-1218 (2001) honed in on the most pervasive martial practice of the crusade. This article influenced his seminal book The Occitan War: A Military and Political History of the Albigensian Crusade, 1209-1218 (2008). This notable work has been thus far the only study devoted to an examination of the Albigensian Crusade from a military standpoint. Indeed, this text effectively circumvents the usual Cathar heresy so typical in secondary sources to focus on the military ventures of the first portion of the crusade. Marvin refers to his book as “the history of a nine-year span, when war and all its attendant misery engulfed a region…” and goes on to say that “the Cathar heresy…plays a very small role in this account…”[22]\n\nThe similarities between Marvin’s book and this thesis are two-fold. The first is an exclusion of the religious and cultural aspects surrounding the Albigensian Crusade in order to survey the militaristic operations that played such a significant role in its development. The second is a restriction of the timeframe to the first nine years of the expedition by encapsulating the campaigns of Simon de Montfort. This timeline was chosen specifically to make better use of the three principal primary sources, two of which end following the count’s untimely demise.\n\nThis thesis takes Marvin’s idea a step further. Through an analysis of the Albigensian Crusade’s military engagements, the aim is to provide a comparative model of the military engagements and their repercussions that took place in the course of the first nine years. Indeed, only by comparing and contrasting the various methods and operations of war in this time period and under these circumstances can one fully understand the motivations and ideologies that drove its participants to such lengths.\n\nThis work should serve to further fill in a gap on the study of the Albigensian Crusade, already commenced by Laurence W. Marvin, and the multifarious military engagements that defined it. The objective is, through careful analysis of the narrative of the crusade between 1209-1218, to cast a brighter light on the modus operandi of medieval warfare within a comparative framework. Furthermore, this work should open up new avenues of research into the strategies and tactics of crusading warfare between Europeans and offer a contrast to the study of Muslims and Christians so often found in traditional books on the crusades.\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nThe methods of research utilized for this thesis include a selection of primary sources. These were supplemented by a bevy of secondary sources ranging in scope from in-depth descriptions of sieges and weapons traditionally used in medieval warfare to accounts of the political machinations of the involved parties. An amalgam of books and scholarly journal articles provided the depth and breadth of scholarly expertise needed for such an endeavor.\n\nThe primary sources offered enough pertinent details on the military ventures of the Albigensian Crusade to undertake a thorough study. However, the relative obscurity of the crusade has become somewhat of a disadvantage in terms of the volume of primary source material available. Thanks to their magnitude and popularity, the crusades to the Levant have been blessed with a veritable cornucopia of eyewitness accounts not only from Christian chroniclers but from Muslim ones as well. The history of the Albigensian Crusade, despite its duration, has been recorded by just four contemporaries in three separate texts, two of which chronicle merely the first nine-years of the crusade: Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay, William of Puylaurens, William of Tudela and his anonymous co-author. This has posed a problem for the modern day scholar. Indeed, Joseph Strayer states “one of the great problems in writing about the Albigensian Crusade is that evidence becomes abundant only in the second half of the thirteenth century, when pressures by the French royal government and by the Inquisition were transforming southern society.”[23] Papal letters provide a frame of reference, but as they are concerned more with political and ecclesial affairs, their details on the logistics of warfare during the crusade are largely absent.\n\nOther primary source accounts related to the Albigensian Crusade provide some insight. However, the authors of these works did not personally witness the events of the crusade first hand, and thus do not provide a thorough narrative of the expedition as do the three main sources. William the Breton, a French chronicler and contemporary of the crusade, wrote Gesta Philippi Augusti (the Deeds of Philip Augustus) and provides a few disparate details on the war. The son of King Peter II of Aragon, Jaume I provides a few details on the battle of Muret in Llibre del felts but his absence at the battle makes his narrative less consequential than the three primary eyewitness accounts. Jonathan Sumption mentions the three eyewitness accounts as his main narrative sources in his history of the Albigensian Crusade, referring to Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay as the ‘official historian’ of the crusade.[24] Laurence Marvin affirms the relevance and significance of the three primary sources in his book: “Of all the sources used in this study, three stand out as absolutely essential to it.”[25] These three narratives have indeed proven indispensable to the study of the Albigensian Crusade and thankfully provide enough facts and figures to grasp the intricate details of the war.\n\nThe Historia Albigense, also known as The History of the Albigensian Crusade, written by Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay furnishes a great deal of detail concerning the first ten years of the war. Written between 1212 and 1218, the narrative begins with Innocent III’s preaching campaign to Languedoc from 1203 to 1208, a campaign directed against the Cathars and Waldensians, another heretical group with closer ties to Catholicism. It ends with an account of the events that took place during the winter of 1218-1219 following the death of Simon de Montfort.[26]\n\nPeter of les Vaux-de-Cernay was a Cistercian monk from the Abbey of les Vaux-de-Cernay in the northern region of Ile-de-France. His uncle Guy was abbot of the abbey and later appointed bishop of the city of Carcassonne in 1212. In his early twenties, Peter traveled with his uncle to the south and accompanied him on several of Montfort’s campaigns. The Historia Albigense is an excellent source of reference despite Peter’s strong partisanship. He often praises Simon de Montfort, referring to him as the Athlete of Christ while castigating the heretics and all those who oppose the crusade. W.A. Sibly and M.D. Sibly, the scholars responsible for translating into English the Historia Albigense wrote of Peter, saying “[he] was a rather naïve young man, quite intelligent, but unsophisticated, a zealous believer in orthodox dogma…and glad to accept what his superiors told him without question…He belonged to the ecclesiastical aristocracy of the north, and his values and prejudices were those of that society. His writing simply reflects this.”[27] Nevertheless, from the perspective of the crusaders, Peter’s account is unparalleled in its scope and breadth of military detail.\n\nThe second primary source of equal value to that of Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay is the account of William of Puylaurens. Known simply as The Chronicle of William of Puylaurens, this narrative of the Albigensian Crusade covers the period from the late twelfth century to the middle of the 1270s. A citizen of Toulouse, William was directly involved in the crusade on the southern side. He was most likely a chaplain of Count Raymond VII of Toulouse. The treasure that is The Chronicle resides in the fact that, unlike the two other primary sources, its narrative extends well beyond the end of the crusade. Indeed, the oeuvre ends somewhere around the 1270s giving the reader unprecedented insight into the Treaty of Paris which ended the crusade in 1229, the Inquisition of the 1230s and the struggles faced by remaining Cathars in the latter thirteenth century.[28]\n\nLike Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay, William of Puylaurens was a staunch Catholic who “supported the efforts of the crusades and later of the French crown to extirpate heresy from the Midi…”[29] Unlike Peter, however, William was more moderate in his account, less critical and more objective. The Chroniclefurnishes a more balanced viewpoint of the war and its outcome. It is, like the other primary sources, a glimpse into the everyday lives of those embroiled in the crusade and its purpose “is to record the struggle to defend the Catholic Church and eliminate heresy in the South…”[30]\n\nThe final first-hand account of the Albigensian Crusade can be found in the Chanson de la Croisade Albigeoise or The Song of the Cathar Wars. Written in Old Provençal, the Chanson recounts the events of Languedoc from 1204-1219. Recorded by two different authors, the Chanson was composed as a poem and written in verse rather than prose with the intent of being performed for an audience. Entertainment value notwithstanding, the authors were still concerned with providing an accurate account of the events as they happened.[31] The author of the first section was William of Tudela, a cleric from Navarre who served in the house of Baldwin of Toulouse, brother of Raymond VI, but remained a devout Catholic and supporter of the crusade. His narrative is comparable to that of William of Puylaurens in its impartiality. His account ends in 1213 and is picked up by the second author, an anonymous southerner whose diatribe of the crusaders is similar to Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay’s polemic against the heretics. The anonymous author relates the rest of the account from a very polarized, pro-southern perspective. Ironically, this second author had a strong aversion to heresy and his only problem with Raymond VI was his unwillingness to suppress it.[32]\n\nThus the two authors of the Chanson provide alternate outlooks on the Albigensian Crusade by offering additional insight into, and often corroborating, the accounts of William of Puylaurens and Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay. The anonymous author furnishes tremendous detail concerning the last siege of Toulouse by the crusaders in 1218-1219, suggesting that he may have been a citizen of the city. The word-for-word speeches included in his narrative must be studied with a critical eye, as they were most likely embellished to render the story more entertaining.\n\nThis thesis will therefore explore the military undertakings of both the northern crusaders and the southerners between 1209 and 1218, focusing on the campaigns conducted by Simon de Montfort. With particular emphasis on the manifold sieges and the few field battles that took place, the aim will be to employ a compare and contrast template to examine the military endeavors of the first nine years of the Albigensian Crusade. This will hopefully shine new light and fill a lacuna on a set of brutal campaigns waged in the name of the Catholic Church in a war that quickly deteriorated into a struggle for political and military dominance of Languedoc.\n\nII. BACKGROUND TO CRUSADE\n\nThe context surrounding the Albigensian Crusade is crucial to its understanding. The time period in which it took place determined the course it would take and its outcome, while its inherent ideologies suffused the very sensibilities of those involved. Indeed, the Albigensian Crusade was a product of the Middle Ages from whence it came. The fusion of politics, war, and religion wove the very fabric of the crusade, a fabric wedded to the notions of God and glory that defined much of the Middle Ages. To grasp the complexities of the Albigensian Crusade, one must delve deeper into the underlying perceptions and institutions that drove the expedition. From the political idiosyncrasies fundamental to feudalism, to the temporal and spiritual powers of the Church, to the exercise of warfare and its implications in the crusading ideal, the Albigensian Crusade was an amalgam of esoteric religious and secular mores and the quintessence of the proclivities of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nFollowing the slow and painful demise of the Roman Empire beginning in the fifth century, what is now considered Western Europe emerged from the wreckage as a fragment of its once glorious past. Barbarian invasions from the north pressing against the tenuous borders of the empire, the rapid devaluation of currency, a string of weak emperors whose lives were too often cut short by their own subordinates, a gradual transfer of power to the Eastern Roman Empire, and the overextension of the its resources over a number of decades all served to bring the Western Roman Empire to its knees.[33] Invasions of the Roman capital by the Visigoths led by Alaric I in AD 410 and again in 476 by the German chieftain Odovacer signaled the end of a civilization that had lasted over one thousand years and controlled modern-day Europe, North Africa, and a substantial portion of the Near East.[34]\n\nThe Western Roman Empire lived on for another one thousand years in the form of the Byzantine Empire established by Emperor Constantine I. His capital of Constantinople founded in AD 324 carried on the legacy of Rome’s grandeur and opulence, albeit in a more eastern tradition heavily influenced by the Greeks. The Byzantine Empire maintained its hegemony of the eastern world until its fall in 1453 at the hands of Turkish Sultan Mehmet II.[35]\n\nBeginning in the sixth century, the West entered a new age known today as the Middle Ages. Lasting roughly one thousand years, the Middle Ages experienced a high level of prosperity with bursts of innovation and creativity-due in part to the cultural revivals under Charlemagne and Otto I in the ninth and tenth centuries, respectively-that would engender the Renaissance beginning in the middle of the fourteenth century. Divided into three distinct periods labeled Early (c. 500-1000), High (c. 1000-1300), and Late (c. 1300-1500), the Middle Ages constituted the necessary link between Antiquity and the Renaissance. Advances in science, medicine, astronomy, and law gave rise to the proliferation of universities in the twelfth century thanks to the intellectual outburst spawned by the crusades and the renewal of interest in Aristotle’s ideas.[36]Kept alive for over a thousand years thanks to the indefatigable efforts of monks in scriptoriums in monasteries all over Europe, the works of the ancient Greek and Roman orators, philosophers, historians, playwrights, mathematicians and scientists were carefully preserved and would later provide inspiration to the Humanists during the Renaissance.[37] Gothic cathedrals and universities proudly displayed the wealth, prestige and independence of many towns and cities that arose during the High and Late Middle Ages. Today, these structures remain a testament to the prosperity, and cultural and intellectual innovation that distinguished the Middle Ages.[38]\n\nThis period was also plagued by tremendous social, political, and economic turmoil making it one of the most fascinating paradoxes in all of history. From the Muslim and Viking invasions of the eighth to the tenth centuries, to the crusades of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, to the Black Death and the Hundred Years War of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, people who lived in the West during the Middle Ages were subject to the vicissitudes of everyday life including famine, pestilence and a state of perpetual warfare.\n\nFeudalism\n\nPolitically, the Middle Ages can be most aptly characterized by a system known as feudalism. The decline of Rome in the West and the uncertainty that accompanied it pushed many Roman nobles and affluent landowners to renounce their allegiance to the emperor, abandon the cities, and establish themselves in the many provinces as individual lords-thus severing any ties they had with the empire. Their wealth allowed them to construct fortified domiciles throughout the countryside to keep out brigands and tax collectors as well as affording them the opportunity to hire mercenaries or even private armies for their own safety.[39] This system gradually developed into the political and social concept known as manorialism in eighth-century Francia. This miniature system of government consisted of a hierarchy composed of the lord and lady of the manor whose subjects, local peasants and mercenaries, were paid and protected in exchange for various services they provided. The symbiotic relationship inherent in manorialism meant that manors were completely self-sufficient and therefore owed allegiance to no king. In effect, their autonomy made them sovereign in their own right.[40]\n\nThe petty lords and seigneurs of these manors began forming ties with one another depending on their status. In exchange for increased political influence and protection, they in turn became the subjects of more powerful barons, counts, dukes and monarchs. This complex political hierarchy included everyone from the lowliest of lords to the most powerful kings. Thus manorialism evolved into a system of government known as feudalism in the ninth and tenth centuries whereby vassals offered homage to an overlord and entered into a relationship based upon mutual obligation.[41] The overlord or king would bestow upon his vassal a fief, a plot of land, in exchange for the promise of military service when called upon. In this social organization based on patronage, kings became subordinate to more powerful kings by paying homage to them. By the start of the Albigensian Crusade, the feudal system had been established and in practice for several centuries. Simon de Montfort, for instance, paid homage to King Philip II Augustus of France as well as to King Peter II of Aragon.[42]\n\nThe Catholic Church\n\nThe feudal system of rule that typified the Middle Ages was closely linked to another product of the fall of the Roman Empire: the Roman Catholic Church. Deriving its hierarchy and canon law directly from the Roman system of government, the Church became a living extension of the Empire after its fall.[43] Throughout the Middle Ages, the Church grew in prestige, wealth and influence, its leaders often clashing with secular rulers. In light of the hardships endured by people living in this era, the Church assumed the role of protector and comforter, a bastion of hope and truth. The doctrines and decrees espoused by the Church formed the foundation of peoples’ faith. The moral compass it provided guided their every thought and action throughout the course of their lives. The cathedrals that still dot the European landscape are a testament to the Church’s authority. The pope, as Bishop of Rome, successor to the Apostle Peter and supreme head of the Church, wielded tremendous power over both temporal and spiritual affairs. The Church and the papacy molded practically every aspect of society from education, to government, to war, and beyond.[44]\n\nThe clash between secular rulers and popes had been a constant since the early days of the Church. With the rise of the Church’s power, the conflict escalated over the issue of the election and appointment of bishops, a concept known as lay investiture. Traditionally, the monarchies of medieval Europe were to elect bishops, not the Church. In 1075, Pope Gregory VII (r. 1073-1085) challenged the establishment, claiming that the Church was the only institution capable of electing its bishops. The Investiture Controversy, as it came to be known, pitted the Roman Catholic Church against Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084-1105). Gregory VII decreed the immediate termination of lay investiture, with all powers of appointment and election handed over to the Church unconditionally. It was stated that “no clergyman shall receive investiture of a bishopric, monastery, or church from the hand of the emperor, or the king, or any lay person, man or woman.”[45] This signaled a definite blow to the powers of medieval kings and emperors who often regarded popes as their subordinates. Papal authority had finally been concretized over secular rulers as a trenchant reminder of the power of the Church in the Middle Ages. The Gregorian Reforms continued to challenge the sovereign powers of medieval rulers for decades to come.[46]\n\nInnocent III\n\nJust shy of the turn of the thirteenth century, a charismatic young cardinal by the name of Lothario Conti was elected pope and took the name Innocent III. The first pope to coin the term and assume the title of Vicar of Christ, Innocent was armed with a shrewd intellect, a keen sense of the political atmosphere of his day, and therefore did not take lightly his role as head of the Church. Guided by principles of the faith, he continued in the reform-minded vein of Gregory VII and engrossed himself completely in the political and religious affairs of the early thirteenth century.[47] A strong proponent of the crusades, Innocent called, organized, and sent forth both the Fourth and Fifth Crusades. The Albigensian Crusade, a sincere attempt on his part to eradicate the heresy in Languedoc, at times became a sideshow to the larger crusades to the Levant. His calling of the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 became the largest ecclesial synod of the Middle Ages and many of the issues discussed amongst its participants involved the situation in Languedoc and the fight against heresy.\n\nTensions between secular rulers and the Holy See were not assuaged during the pontificate of Innocent III. He waged a constant battle of wills against these rulers in order to maintain his authority over them and their respective territories. Specifically, King Philip II Augustus of France (r. 1180-1223), Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV (r. 1198-1218), and King John of England (r. 1199-1216) presented particular challenges to Innocent. Their defiant attitudes and attendant actions became an ancillary burden to the pope in the midst of crusade preparations.\n\nThe thirteenth century is often considered the apex of the Church’s power. From this period on and through the eras of the Renaissance, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution, the validity of many of the Church’s claims was questioned, the result being a severe erosion of its authority. The rise of Humanism, the propagation and acceptance of scientific inquiry, and the religious reforms incited by Martin Luther all took their toll on the Church’s spiritual and earthly hegemony. Yet during the thirteenth century, Innocent III was an energetic and persuasive figure who exercised his mastery of politics and law to influence kings and emperors and become one of the most influential popes of the Middle Ages.[48]\n\nWar\n\nIf the Church presided over the spiritual affairs of everyone from kings to serfs in the Middle Ages, then the looming threat of war constantly permeated the temporal atmosphere of these people in much the same way. Kings and emperors incited conflicts by invading territory, breaking oaths of fealty, or by placing too much economic and military pressure on one another. The wars that erupted as a result could take years to resolve, often with no clear winner on either side. Victims of these wars were mostly combatants but the unarmed masses of peasants including men, women and children frequently fell prey to the devastating effects of war.\n\nWars of religion began as early as the sixth century in Europe when Clovis (r. 482-511), a powerful Frankish chieftain, converted from paganism to Christianity on Christmas Day 496. His decision to accept the Christian faith was due to his desire to expand his territorial holdings in Gaul, and to gain the backing of the nascent Roman Catholic Church and its supporters. His newly acquired position as king of the Franks compelled the disparate Frankish tribes to unite under his banner. Clovis then proceeded to extirpate, in the name of God, those who opposed his will.[49]\n\nThe rise and spread of Islam in the seventh century signaled a new era of medieval religious warfare. The threat came not from within Europe but from the distant Middle East and North Africa. The Muslim invasion of Europe began in 711 when Tariq ibn Ziyad, a Muslim general, crossed the Straits of Gibraltar-that today bear his name-from Morocco into Spain with a Muslim army of seven thousand consisting mostly of Berbers, Yemenis, and Syrians. His conquest of al-Andalus (Andalusia) and his subsequent invasion of Frankish lands brought him into sharp conflict with the Frankish military leader Charles Martel, popularly referred to as Charles the Hammer. The Muslim advance was halted at the battle of Tours in 732 but an Islamic state remained for three centuries in al-Andalus and flourished until the Reconquista in the eleventh century.[50]\n\nThe scourge of perennial warfare in the Middle Ages continued with invasions beginning in the ninth century. Vikings from the north and west ravaged the countryside of medieval Europe, penetrating deep into territory accessible only by river thanks to small and highly maneuverable ships. Despoiling unfortified monasteries and villages, the Vikings used the element of surprise, swiftly attacking easy targets that offered little resistance. From the east, Magyar horsemen conducted raids into the Italian peninsula and throughout the Holy Roman Empire while Muslims raiders from the south harassed the coasts of France and Italy. This triple-threat of invasions lasted until the turn of the millennium and wreaked havoc on all aspects of medieval society. The duration and intensity of these raids over two centuries acted as a catalyst to military progress.[51]\n\nAt the end of this period of incessant warfare, Western Europe was weary economically but not despoiled of its will to fight. The turn of the eleventh century witnessed significant alterations in defensive structures to thwart further invasions. Wooden fortifications had been built to withstand raids and proved their worth when Vikings, lacking any form of siege equipment, were forced to turn back empty-handed.[52] For the next four centuries, these simple yet effective wooden structures slowly increased in architectural complexity, evolving into the many stone castles and fortified towns and cities that still dot the European landscape today.\n\nCastra\n\nYears of crusading in the East benefited Europeans with the increased knowledge and experience to effectively wage war. Indomitable fortifications populated Europe and the Levant. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries witnessed such a boom in castle building that by the beginning of the fourteenth century practically all the castles erected during the Middle Ages had already been built. King Philip II Augustus of France possessed over one hundred castles alone.[53] Architecture soared to new heights with the addition of thicker and higher walls, subterranean tunnels, and impenetrable keeps. Contained within these walls were wells, storage facilities for food, equipment and weapons, a blacksmith, a kitchen, a chapel, sleeping accommodations and other such amenities to make the castle a fully functioning miniature city.\n\nIn Languedoc, the building of castles and fortified towns proliferated beginning at the end of the tenth century through the eleventh and twelfth centuries. These became known as castra (s. castrum), a Latin term from which the word castle is derived. A castrum defined any castle or walled town built upon a rocky precipice or on a flat plain. Those perched on hilltops and outcrops were defensively secure but, if besieged, their inaccessibility to water eventually forced the surrender of their inhabitants. The Albigensian Crusade revolved around the siege of a great number of these castra of Languedoc.[54] To counteract these formidable structures, medieval engineers built increasingly more powerful and complex siege engines. Catapults, ballistas, mangonels, petraries and trébuchets were some of the more popular and efficient engines used to batter stone walls.\n\nSieges, raids and armies\n\nSieges clearly dominated the realm of warfare in the High Middle Ages. This period was defined by a particular form of warfare in which field battles were scarce and time-consuming sieges became the de facto standard of waging war against one’s enemies. Standing armies of mounted knights were costly and therefore rare, making field battles sometimes a less enticing option than a protracted siege. When they did occur, field battles often meant high casualties and a decisive victory for one side over the other.\n\nAs a popular and less dangerous alternative to lengthy sieges, raids were frequently conducted against unfortified enemy villages. This process of attrition gradually wore down the enemy’s resources and manpower.[55] Raids were usually conducted from both sides and victims were mostly unarmed persons (inermis).[56] The martial trifecta of raids, sieges and field battles during the High Middle Ages made war a particularly devastating endeavor for both combatants and non-combatants. The Albigensian Crusade, consumed as it was by fighting, became an exemplar of the idea of total war as “the distinction between garrison soldiers and non-combatants was not one that much troubled [the crusaders] as they poured into the towns that fell to them, be they lowly common soldiers or the elite of chivalry.”[57]\n\nThe era of knighthood and chivalry was conceived as a countermeasure to the invasions of the ninth and tenth centuries. Medieval society became highly militarized at the onset of the High Middle Ages, necessitating a clear pecking order. At the top were the knightly class of kings and nobles who took vows of chivalry, mounted powerful steeds, and equipped themselves with armor and advanced weapons of the day including swords, lances, maces and battle axes. The feudal system meant that many knights were vassals of higher-ranking knights, and took oaths of fealty to prove their loyalty. Foot soldiers formed the second class in the medieval military strata. Less well equipped than a knight and lacking a horse, foot soldiers carried miscellaneous weapons and formed the infantry contingent in a medieval army: a branch of the armed forces that became a staple of armies in the thirteenth century. Armed with bows, spears and swords, they proved a formidable force against the more mobile and heavily armored knights.[58]\n\nDuring the Albigensian Crusade, citizen militias of the towns of Languedoc were instrumental in the defense of their cities against the northern crusaders. Though not as experienced or as well-equipped as knights, these militias put up fierce resistance and often met with success. Mercenaries, on the other hand, were opportunists who held no allegiance but nevertheless assumed an important role in the armies of the Albigensian Crusade. Usually bands of roving soldiers who fought for the highest pay, these routiers were so named because they were constantly moving and looking for employment. Their alternate moniker-écorcheurs (skinners)-was a term that issued from their more sinister reputation as soldiers without mercy who committed atrocities against civilians.[59] These men usually assumed a specialized task either as foot soldiers, archers, siege engine operators, or even mounted warriors and were mostly recruited from the Netherlands and northern Spain.[60] It was this specialization that made them an enviable option for a commander who could afford to hire them. Their appeal was in their reputation and in their worth “whose equivalent it was impossible to find locally amongst vassals, subjects or fellow-citizens.”[61]\n\nThere existed a set of martial laws and codes applied to combat during the High and Late Middle Ages. These laws of war were enacted in accordance with the concept of Just War propounded by St. Augustine in the fourth century who claimed that “war is waged that peace may be had.”[62] Centuries later, this notion evolved into the medieval idea insisting “that war be waged under proper authority, that of the Church against infidels, that of a prince or judge, or in self-defence [sic].”[63]\n\nThis idea also dictated the treatment of captured nobles. When captured, a knight was usually spared the sword and held for ransom as he was worth more alive than dead. This concept, though, did not apply to lesser foot soldiers and mercenaries who were mercilessly slaughtered. “The laws of war were,” according to Sean McGlynn, “in theory, designed to afford protection to non-combatants…in practice, the laws were reserved for the ruling classes.”[64] The Albigensian Crusade experienced its fair share of slaughter and in many circumstances the laws of war concerning nobles and commoners were eschewed. Sieges were also subject to certain unspoken laws of war. The defenders were given the opportunity to surrender before the siege began. They would be allowed to leave unharmed but if they chose to take their chances and endure the siege, if their fortress fell they would be given no quarter and the besiegers given the chance to indulge in rapine. The profusion of sieges during the Albigensian Crusade put these laws to the test.[65]\n\nThe Crusades\n\nThe era of the crusades fell directly within the timeframe of the High Middles Ages. This period was characterized not only by war but also by progress. The ethnic intermingling between Muslims and Christians led to some renewed discoveries of ancient works by the Christians, works thought to have been lost centuries ago. The translated ideas of ancient Greek philosophers made their way to Europe via crusader routes. In addition, Muslim advances in literature, science, philosophy and mathematics acted as a catalyst for the Renaissance that would begin a couple centuries later. Consequently, a rejuvenation of the intellectual, economic, and cultural spheres of medieval Europe resulted from two centuries of war in the Levant. Naturally, the crusades defined much of the High Middle Ages and their impact on all levels of society was pervasive.[66]\n\nCalled as a response to the plight of the Christian brethren in Byzantium in the face of the belligerent Seljuk Turks, the crusades commenced in 1095 with the Council of Clermont in France. Pope Urban II preached a fiery sermon urging the nobles of Europe to take up arms, sell their possessions and leave for the Holy Land: “Let no possessions keep you back, no solicitude for your property…Set out on the road for the holy sepulchre [sic], take the land from that wicked people and make it your own.”[67] In this manner, the pope promoted the militant reclamation of once-Christian lands. Jerusalem, Urban II said, had been defiled by the infidel and must be reclaimed for Christendom. Ergo, the crusades were defensive wars waged by Christians against Muslims. With cries of Deus le volt!! (God wills it!!), hundreds of thousands of eager and sincere peregrini Christi (pilgrims of Christ) marked themselves with the cross and became crucesignati (’those signed by the cross’).[68] Fulcher of Chartres, a contemporary of the First Crusade, referred to a practice adopted by crusaders saying “they bear arms suitable for battle; on the right shoulder, or between both shoulders, they wear the cross of Christ…”[69] Counts, dukes and barons from all over Christendom met in France to journey east. They were accompanied by large retinues of supporters as well as by hordes of peasants including women, children and the elderly. The journey to the Holy Land became a pilgrimage with the promise of an indulgence by the Church.[70]\n\nThe crusades also fulfilled a certain need for the military class. Joseph Strayer claims it was “the desire to show one’s skill and courage in armed combat, the desire to gain fame among one’s peers, [and] the desire to serve God and the Church” that urged knights and nobles to risk their lives in the Levant.[71]\n\nFour years after the call, Jerusalem fell to the crusaders and became once again a Christian city. The First Crusade was the only truly successful crusade to have met its goal amongst eight major crusades destined for the Levant. The battle of Hattin in 1187 marked the return of Muslim rule to the area after nearly a century of Christian dominance. Muslims continued to press against the fragile Christian territories until the final Christian stronghold of Acre was lost in 1291. Islamic hegemony was restored and the Christians never succeeded in retaking their lost territories, or Jerusalem.[72]\n\nThe crusade appeal was not isolated to Outremer. Crusaders hunted down heretical groups in Germany, Italy, Bosnia and in Bohemia with the Hussites between 1420 and 1431.[73] The Reconquista in Spain aimed to push the Moors beyond the boundaries of Europe and drive them back into North Africa. Wars of religion endured for many centuries thereafter but the era of the crusades remains a potent example of the harsh realities of religious intolerance.\n\nLanguedoc\n\nIn the thirteenth century, the area once known as Languedoc in modern-day France stretched from the Rhône Valley in the east to the Garonne River in the west. Its northern borders extended from Auvergne to today’s region of Rousillon in the south. The region of Languedoc was originally a Roman province of Gaul with its capital of Narbo. In 70 BC Julius Caesar conquered Narbonensian Gaul, the region south of present-day Toulouse and Lyon. By 27 BC, Languedoc had become a province of the empire with Narbonne as its capital.[74] Germanic tribes conquered the area in the fifth century with the Visigoths establishing a kingdom around the city of Tolosa, present-day Toulouse.\n\nA century later the Franks established themselves in the area under the rule of Clovis but the Muslim invasions of the eighth century destroyed the kingdom of the Visigoths in Spain and spread across the Pyrenees. Frankish leader Charles Martel halted the Muslim advance in 732 and Languedoc once again became the domain of the Franks and would remain so under his successors. Martel’s grandson, the illustrious and puissant Frankish king Charlemagne “instituted the comtal system – with appointed officials, counts and viscounts, possessing land and honours [sic] in return for undertaking governmental and defensive duties.”[75] The unified kingdom Charlemagne had created gradually eroded following his death. The counts and viscounts he had appointed grew more independent and more powerful, creating a territorial aristocracy based upon heredity.\n\nLanguedoc thus became a conglomerate of various nobles who guarded their territories vigorously and whose complex allegiances comprised a network of oaths of fealty to other nobles. The heterogeneous nature of Languedoc provided little room for central authority and gave the aristocracy the requisite leverage to wield unadulterated power within their spheres of influence. The most powerful of these southern nobles were the counts of Toulouse, named for the city from which they ruled. Through shrewd political and marriage alliances, the counts of Toulouse expanded their domains considerably in Languedoc in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The house of Toulouse’s principal rival for hegemony over Languedoc was the house of Barcelona under the kings of Aragon. These two houses spent much of the twelfth century fighting over areas of Languedoc and vying for the support of smaller families in the region. These lesser houses sporadically transferred allegiance from one house to another for political, territorial and financial gain, all while trying to maintain their own autonomy. By the early thirteenth century, King Peter II of Aragon had acquired suzerainty over the counties and viscounties of Narbonne, Béziers, Carcassonne and Foix, effectively wresting many of the territories from Count Raymond VI of Toulouse.[76]\n\nLanguedoc was not only distant politically from the more militarily and administratively unified structure of northern France, but it was also removed linguistically. Indeed, the word Languedoc is a marriage of two words: langue(language or tongue) and d’oc (of Oc)-oc being the word for yes in the south. This differentiated it from the Langue d’Oï of the French north-oï being a derivative of the modern French word oui. The language of Oc was less distinguishable to the French of the north as it drew many of its influences from Spanish and Italian, as well as Provençal. This linguistic disparity was magnified by the cultural differences between north and south. The Albigensian Crusade was not a civil war but a war fought between two distinct cultures whose language, political affiliations, and military experience were highly divergent.[77]\n\nThe Cathar Heresy\n\nThe Cathar heresy that sparked the Albigensian Crusade in the early thirteenth century had roots in many centuries past. Its ideological origins can be traced back to Manicheanism, itself a heresy of the third century. Founded by Mani, a Mesopotamian prophet, the heresy espoused many of the doctrinal points of Gnosticism and Persian Zoroastrianism. In particular, the element of dualism inherent within these early religions had a strong influence on Manicheanism, and later, on Catharism. The dualist notion sought to explain the presence of good and evil on earth. Two distinct deities, one benign and one malevolent, conceived the spiritual and material worlds, respectively. The good god who ruled over the human soul and the spiritual realm, came to be associated with the god of the New Testament. The material world had been created by the malign god, as associated with Yaweh of the Old Testament. Because the physical world in which humans lived was a product of the evil god, everything material was, by virtue, evil. Therefore, the body was considered a physical shell from which the dualists sought to depart. In the same manner, procreation, or the propagation of the species by bringing more souls into the material world, was vilified.[78] Marriage and sex, the linking of two physical bodies in perpetual sin, was also deemed immoral by dualists. Abstention from these things, as well as from the consumption of foods produced as a result of procreation-eggs, meat, cheese-was a tenet of the dualist faith.[79]\n\nOver the centuries Manichean beliefs were transmitted to Western Europe from the East. A dualist sect originating in Bulgaria, the Bogomils are credited with bringing their doctrine to the West. The Cathari, from the word pure in Greek, embraced the Manichean ideology that took firm root in Languedoc. In many ways, the Cathars professed their religion to be superior to that of the Catholic Church. They claimed to be ‘good Christians’ and even accepted many Catholic beliefs. They rejected all of the Old Testament but clung to many ideas from the New Testament. In accordance with their dualist tradition, the Cathars vehemently denied the humanity, death and resurrection of Christ, placing them at odds with the Catholic Church. They believed Christ had been merely a spiritual force on the earth and thus had not assumed physical form.[80]Furthermore, their rejection of the sacraments and of the many proprietary dogmas of the Catholic tradition caused further discord between the two faiths. The Cathars claimed the bread and wine consumed during Communion were not the physical body and blood of Christ, but rather a representation-in effect denying its sacrosanctity.[81] Furthermore, the Cathars utterly repudiated the Catholic Church as the moral determinant of medieval society and denied the pope’s authority as father of the Church. Cathars were also prohibited from taking oaths, an argument the Inquisition would later use against them to dispute their legitimacy.[82]\n\nAs a reflection of its dualist doctrine, the hierarchy of the Cathar Church separated its adherents into two distinct groups. The first group, called the Perfecti or Perfects, formed the Cathar elite. Though few in number, their influence and authority over the many lesser Cathars was unquestionable.[83]To become a Perfect, initiation necessitated participation in a rite called the Consolamentum. This ceremony consisted of the individual embracing Cathar doctrine and vowing to abide by its precepts, such as abstention from marriage and sex and dedication to regular fasting. The stringent ascetic lifestyle embraced by the Perfects presented a challenge to the clergy of the Catholic Church whose opulence and unabashed ostentation clashed with their belief system. The Church’s response to the asceticism of the Perfects came in the form of a Spanish bishop named Diego de Osma and his assistant Domingo de Gùzman, who, later renamed St. Dominic, would found the Dominican Order. Beginning in 1206, these men traveled throughout Languedoc exemplifying a life of apostolic poverty. They renounced all worldly wealth and sought to imitate, and even supersede, the austere lifestyle of the Perfects in order to gain Catholic converts among the Cathars and to persuade the Perfects of their errors.[84]\n\nThe credentes, or believers, occupied the second tier of the Cathar Church. These individuals formed the vast majority of Cathars and were not required to follow the strict code of discipline practiced by the Perfects. They were encouraged, however, to partake in the consolamentum towards the end of their life or on their deathbed, formally admitting them to the ranks of the Perfects. They nonetheless followed Cathar doctrine and were expected to bear witness to the faith. Decades later, when questioned by inquisitors about his involvement in the Cathar Church, John Textor, a Cathar believer, stated: “I am not a heretic, for I have a wife and I sleep with her. I have sons, I eat meat, and I lie and swear, and I am a faithful Christian.”[85]\n\nThe staunch faith observed by the Perfects presented an allure to those disillusioned by what many deemed the blatant hypocrisy of the Catholic Church. The unswerving orthodoxy of both faiths was a clear indicator of their respective beliefs in their own theological infallibility. This only served to strengthen the resolve of the Catholic Church in eradicating Catharism, and in turn intensified the Cathars’ resistance to Catholicism. In 1165, a formal debate was organized between Catholic bishops and Cathar representatives in an effort to settle theological contentions. The result proved fruitless as the heretics were condemned by the bishops but left unharmed. Two years later at Saint-Félix-Lauragais a meeting was convened by Cathar figures from throughout the region and as a result the official establishment of Cathar doctrine was formalized as well as that of the Cathar Church in Languedoc.[86]\n\nSeveral measures were taken by the Catholic Church to suppress or destroy the heresy during the twelfth century but the results were usually in vain. St. Bernard de Clairvaux undertook a preaching crusade to Languedoc in 1145 accompanied by Cistercian monks. He returned home having made little headway, but while the Third Lateran Council of 1179 threatened to use force against the heretics, nothing was done to enforce the decree. It was during the pontificate of Pope Innocent III that heresy would face its most formidable foe: “…he [Innocent] was determined to root out heresy throughout the church so that he could unite Christendom behind a crusade to reverse the losses suffered by the crusader states.”[87] Innocent sent legates on preaching tours to Languedoc in the early years of his pontificate and in 1200 passed the decree Vergentis in senium. This decree dealt a considerable blow to the heretics as it explicitly called for the confiscation of their property.[88]\n\nThe proliferation of Catharism in Languedoc presented not only a doctrinal challenge, but also a political obstacle to the Catholic Church. This suggested a two-fold threat. The appeal of Catharist ideology infiltrated all levels of society in Languedoc. Nobles embraced it thanks to its anti-Catholic principles that gave them free reign to live comfortable lives while appropriating Church property, thereby expanding their own dominions. The spiritual magnetism displayed by the Perfects also enticed the lower classes to join the Cathar ranks.[89] Although uneducated, the lower classes had been let down by the spiritual disingenuousness of the Catholic Church and were eager to mitigate its influence in their region. As the heresy became more ingrained in southern culture, so did a general laxity towards it on the part of the Catholic clergy living in Languedoc. Ecclesial reforms had been initiated under Pope Gregory VII in the second half of the eleventh century.[90] At the commencement of his pontificate, Innocent recognized this perennial problem and sought to address it. He assigned more competent and resolute bishops to the many bishoprics of Languedoc, ones who shared his vision of reform and would rise to the occasion to suffocate the insidious heresy.[91]\n\nThe pro-Cathar agenda championed by the southern nobles incited Innocent to apply political pressure backed by the threat of military intervention. Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, the most powerful noble of Languedoc, became the pope’s primary target. Raymond’s first wife had been a Perfect but although he claimed to be Catholic, his actions spoke otherwise. His adamant refusal to suppress Catharism in his territory led Innocent to make an appeal to Philip Augustus, king of France. Lacking a standing army of his own, the pope’s only option was to use the authority he wielded as Vicar of Christ to entice secular leaders to execute his military enterprise.[92] Despite the promise of a crusading indulgence, Philip Augustus was too engrossed in his fight against King John of England to concern himself with affairs in Languedoc. It would take a cold-blooded murder for Innocent to resort to armed conflict sans the backing of a secular king. The stage was set for the Albigensian Crusade.\n\nIII. THE ALBIGENSIAN CRUSADE FROM A MILITARY PERSPECTIVE\n\nPhase I: The Rise of Simon de Montfort\n\nCount Raymond VI of Toulouse succeeded his father Raymond V in 1194. His grandfather, Raymond IV was one of the first nobles to enlist as a crusader during the First Crusade in 1095.[93] As the most powerful noble of Languedoc, Raymond VI’s inheritance included the suzerainty of its lands as well as the homage paid to him by the many lesser nobles of the region. Although he retained an unusual sense of autonomy and privilege as Count of Toulouse, Raymond VI was himself the vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV, King Peter II of Aragon, and King Philip II Augustus of France. He received from them substantial territories in Languedoc in return for his homage. However, his vassalage and the ties of allegiance he maintained were, in theory, merely titular.\n\nIn accordance with Raymond’s recognition of his own sovereignty was his resistance to comply with the exhortations of Pope Innocent III. In 1207, the pope strongly admonished the count’s actions with reference to three issues: the presence of tolls throughout his territories, his employment of mercenaries in his private army, and his lack of zeal in rooting out heresy in Languedoc. Curiously, the issue concerning the harboring of heretics was of equal magnitude to those dealing with the presence of mercenaries and tolls. Innocent lent equal importance to all three, although the Albigensian Crusade would be summoned only as a response to the problem of heresy.\n\nRaymond’s indifference to the papal rebuke and the concomitant lack of action on his part can perhaps be attributed to two things: first, Raymond knew that the pope, a fervent advocate of the crusades, was more concerned with issues in the Levant than with the petty lords of Languedoc. The disastrous Fourth Crusade had tarnished the reputation of Christendom, and by virtue of association, that of Innocent III. The pope needed to redeem himself by quickly gathering support for the Fifth Crusade. Second, owing to the fact that the pope was at the mercy of secular rulers for military support, Raymond could rest easy knowing the only annoyance he had to contend with was the voice of the papal legate, whose words were far less damaging than the swords of knights. Innocent’s only weapon against Raymond’s antipathy was the threat of excommunication and the placement of his lands under interdict.[94]\n\nIn medieval Christendom, the imposition of punitive sanctions on secular rulers was an effective method of bringing back said rulers in line with the Church. Excommunication was a common penalty often used by popes and legates against secular authorities. It entailed a formal removal of the subject from the body of Christendom, formally prohibiting them from partaking in the sacraments of the Church. This penalty was frequently inflicted upon leaders and even entire armies during the crusades. A direct violation of the pope’s orders would unequivocally incur the wrath of the Church and subject one to the possibility of excommunication, barring them access to heaven for eternity.\n\nAccording to medieval canon law, placing one’s lands under interdict meant to deny the sacraments to all residents of a particular territory. This ecclesial technique was used to enforce the obedience of a ruler by placing the eternal fate of his subjects directly in his hands. More often than not, an interdict would succeed in bringing a ruler back to the spiritual fold. For Raymond VI, the burden of excommunication and interdict did little to dissuade him from keeping the tolls, employing mercenaries, and harboring heretics in his lands. This would prove a calamitous mistake.\n\nInnocent appealed once more to Raymond’s overlord, King Philip Augustus. Embroiled as he was with his war against King John of England over territories in Aquitaine and Normandy, Philip had no desire to send part of his army to partake in a war against his own vassal in Languedoc. The vicar’s hope for military support to combat the count fell on deaf ears. On 13 January 1208, the fiery papal legate Peter of Castelnau stood in the courts of Raymond VI and vehemently reprimanded him for his indifference to the pope’s dictates. The meeting ended with the count threatening the life of the legate. The next morning at dawn, while traveling along the Rhône, a horseman approached the legate from behind and drove a lance into his back, killing him. The assassin was later identified as a servant of Raymond although the count was never convicted. The cold-blooded murder of his legate with all fingers pointing at Raymond VI provided Innocent with the catalyst he needed to use military force against the insubordinate count. Judgment would come in the form of the Albigensian Crusade.[95]\n\nThroughout Christendom, leaders heeded Innocent’s call to arms. The majority of these crusaders issued from the nobility of northern France while others came from the Holy Roman Empire. By declaring Raymond VI’s lands and those of the heretics he harbored forfeit, Innocent stimulated a surge of crusaders who wished to establish their own territories throughout Languedoc. Similar to the crusades directed to the Levant, those who participated in the Albigensian Crusade received an indulgence, promising full remission of sins-a popular medieval notion that continued to provide the impetus for all crusades despite the relative failure of many. The military service required to receive the indulgence, however, only lasted forty days and would ultimately cause the unnecessary protraction of the crusade over many years. The Albigensian Crusade offered a special appeal to crusaders in three ways: first, the indulgence granted by the pope meant crusaders did not have to risk the dangerous journey to the Levant to receive absolution; second, the forty days of required military service signified that crusaders could campaign during the spring or summer and return home having performed their duties and gained their indulgence; third, Languedoc was a much more attractive prospect geographically and climatically than the deserts and blazing sun of Outremer and its relative proximity didn’t necessitate a journey lasting several months.\n\nThese three factors added considerable numbers to the first crusading army of the Albigensian Crusade although the primary sources do not provide accurate details. Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay is not specific about the number of crusaders, merely stating that thousands joined the northern army.[96] William of Tudela cites twenty thousand fully armed knights and over two hundred thousand others, undoubtedly a gross exaggeration.[97] William of Puylaurens makes no mention of the crusading forces that responded to the initial call while modern estimates suggest a force of around twenty thousand.[98] William the Breton doesn’t give specific statistics but claims an infinite number of people from the kingdom of France.[99] Given the lack of conclusive numbers, it is almost impossible to accurately gauge the size of the first crusader army. It was the forty-day rule that made estimates difficult. Indeed, the ebb and flow of recruits to and from the south rendered the army a fluid rather than a static entity.[100] The bulk of the army met in the city of Lyon in present-day eastern France on 24 June 1209. From there they marched south along the Rhône recruiting soldiers and welcoming the submission of small villages as they went. One of the crucial elements of the Albigensian Crusade was the constantly disproportionate size of the armies. The magnitude of the crusader force of 1209 would never again be matched and the forces of the south, much like their leaders, were prone to shifting their loyalty when it suited them.\n\nWhen Count Raymond VI of Toulouse learned of the crusade that had been summoned against him, he quickly submitted to all the demands of the Church before the papal legate Arnald-Amaury, Abbot of Cîteaux. Adamantly professing his true Catholic faith, Raymond even agreed to become a crusader and to join the expedition. This turned into a curious twist of events as now, the Count of Toulouse, the original target of the crusade, had himself become a crusader who desired nothing less than to aid the Church in its mission. After reaching the crusader army in late June 1209, Raymond received absolution after having endured a humiliating ceremony involving scourging before a throng of prelates in the church of Saint-Gilles. Although this may have been an insincere gesture according to Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay,[101] it was most likely done to preserve his territory. His reconciliation to the Church notwithstanding, Raymond was unable to halt the advance of a crusade determined to appropriate his lands. His only hope was to divert the army to the territory of rival nobles. He was able to convince its leaders to march upon the dominions of Béziers, Carcassonne and Albi, lands that belonged to his nephew the Viscount Raymond-Roger Trencavel.[102]\n\nBéziers\n\nRelatives though they were, Raymond VI and Raymond-Roger had been at odds for decades and this proved a propitious occasion for Raymond to deal his nephew a debilitating blow courtesy of the Church. The crusader army made its way east from the Rhône to the city of Béziers on 21 July 1209. Located along the Orb river atop a high hill and recognized as a stronghold of heresy, Béziers was a castrum of between ten and fourteen thousand inhabitants. The city’s geographic location, sturdy fortifications, and abundant provisions gave its citizens a sense of invincibility and the assurance of being able to withstand any siege despite the large army that spread before them.[103] According to William of Tudela, their leader Raymond-Roger had fled the city that day to fortify the city of Carcassonne. Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay, an ardent supporter of the crusade says that it was fear that prompted him to abandon his city. It is difficult to know exactly why Raymond-Roger fled but it is more likely that he had confidence in the citizens of Béziers and worried of the fall of the more strategically placed Carcassonne.[104]\n\nThe strong defenses and elevation of the city high above the river nurtured in its citizens a false sense of security. From the ramparts they jeered and fired arrows incessantly at the crusader camp to antagonize them. The first atrocity of the Albigensian Crusade occurred during a sortie from the city when one of the crusaders was hacked to pieces and his body thrown into the river.[105]Enraged at the constant barrage of insults, a group of poor crusaders (ribauds), most likely pilgrims given their lack of weapons according to William of Tudela, made an extempore assault crossing the bridge and, much to the surprise of the citizens, began battering the gates, filling the ditches and tearing down the walls stone by stone.[106] The speed and élan with which they accomplished this caught the citizen militia off guard forcing them to flee to the churches. The crusader knights, realizing what had just happened, quickly followed suit and entered the city behind the initial force.\n\nThe capture of the city was swift as was its subsequent despoliation and the senseless murder of its citizens. When asked by crusaders how to distinguish between good Catholics and heretics, the papal legate Arnald-Amaury is said to have spoken the infamous words: “Caedite eos. Novit enim dominus qui sunt eius” (’Kill them all. The Lord knows who are his own.’).[107] According to the sources, there were mass killings in the city but the number is again subject to interpretation. Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay claims that seven thousand died in one church alone[108] while the letters of the papal legates amplified the number of dead to twenty thousand,[109] an impossible number given the city’s population. Nonetheless, thousands died in a conflagration set by angry crusaders whose spoils had been confiscated by their superiors. Sadly, the knights who had entered the city after the crusaders did nothing to halt the massacre. It was only when the poor crusaders began looting that the knights, fearful they would lose their share of the plunder, quickly intervened to stop them. This reflected a policy of indifference towards the plight of the citizens and a rather unchivalrous gesture on the part of the knightly class.[110] Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay mentions, perhaps in a propagandist vein correlating with his partisanship, some of the atrocities committed by the citizens against their own priests and bishops whom they beat, disrobed and urinated upon “to show contempt for the body and blood of Jesus Christ.”[111]\n\nThe swiftness of the fall of Béziers was highly atypical and would never be repeated for the remainder of the crusade. The gates to the city were battered open, not by a charge of mounted knights, but by a contingent of crusaders “in their shirts and trousers.”[112] This suggests a lack of preparation and overconfidence on the part of the citizen militia. Furthermore, the brutality of the sack of Béziers was unusual for two reasons: first, the capture of the city did not involve a blockade or lengthy siege and thus the crusaders would not have had months of bottled up aggression needing to be unleashed upon the citizens as in later sieges; second, the medieval notion of sanctuary in which churches were deemed places of refuge was clearly violated when churches full of citizens were burned.\n\nThe capture of Béziers was an anomaly of the Albigensian Crusade. It was the first city to fall to the crusaders and thus “greatly fostered the military reputation of northerners and helped sustain much smaller crusading armies through many troubles…”[113] It also revealed to the southerners the fighting superiority of the northern forces and the brutality with which they would effect their military operations. The draconian cruelty inflicted at the sack of Béziers remained a testament to the intolerant position of the Catholic Church towards the Cathar heresy throughout the crusade. There really is no comparable event to the sack of Béziers in all of the Albigensian Crusade. It stood out as a horrific incident of unbridled bloodlust that surprised both the southerners and the northerners and would never be repeated on as grand a scale.\n\nCarcassonne\n\nWith the fresh victory of Béziers behind them, the crusaders marched forty-seven kilometers southwest to Carcassonne, the seat of the Trencavel viscounts. Located along the Aude river, the northern army reached the castrum by 1 August 1209. With a population of over nine thousand, Carcassonne wasn’t as large or as defensible as Béziers but was considered in those days the heart of the Cathar resistance, and thus vital to the crusading movement.[114] The city’s main fortifications consisted of a single set of walls and ditches. It was surrounded by a total of three suburbs: St. Vincent, the bourg St. Michel and the Castellar [115], the latter two being lightly fortified. Viscount Raymond-Roger Trencavel intended to withstand the crusader siege supported by a substantial contingent of four hundred southern knights. According to Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay, the crusader army, thanks to their numbers, were able to effectively surround the entire city as well as its suburbs.[116] It is at the siege of Carcassonne that, for the first time, Count Simon IV de Montfort is mentioned in the Historia Albigensis.[117] Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay continues to lavish praise upon the count whom he often refers to throughout his narrative as the Athlete of Christ.\n\nThe crusader force attacked the St. Vincent suburb located west of the main city early on 3 August. The lack of fortifications surrounding this suburb did not necessitate the use of siege engines and thus was quickly taken by Montfort and his men. The suburb was burned and William of Tudela states that the crusaders cut off the city’s water supply from the river.[118] A successful siege in the Middle Ages was contingent upon cutting off the water supply to a castrum and/or by starving out the defenders. During the rainy season, this was less of an issue as cisterns were constantly being filled, replenishing the militia’s water supply and thereby protracting the siege.[119] Blocking access to the water supply in this case became essential, as the rainy season would not have begun for several months.\n\nHaving established a secure foothold between the main city and the Aude, the crusaders decided to attack the bourg. The presence of ditches and walls around the suburb halted their advance, as did a barrage of stones being thrown from the walls. This necessitated the building of siege engines according to the standard practice of siege warfare. The presence of siege engines in the Albigensian Crusade is first mentioned during the siege of Carcassonne by Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay who relates that the crusaders “quickly built siege-engines of the type known as petraries to knock down the wall of the suburb.”[120] William of Tudela adds the use of “mangonels and catapults [that] battered the length and breadth of the ramparts day and night.”[121]\n\nThe terms mangonel, catapult and petrary refer to medieval siege engines whose origins date back to the Roman period. Although differing in size and shape, these engines-or machines as they were sometimes called-were built to throw stones against and over the walls of a city. They were operated by means of torsion by twisting rope to the point where it acted as a spring to propel an object in a sling or cup placed at the end of an arm. Their placement in battle was crucial to their efficiency. Care was taken to place them at the proper height and angle to maximize their destructive properties. Dead bodies riddled with disease or severed limbs and heads of enemies hurled over a city’s walls proved an effective means of conducting early biological and psychological warfare.[122] Beehives were sometimes lobbed over the walls to cause confusion and disorder.[123]\n\nThe siege of the bourg took several days despite the presence of perfunctory walls and ditches surrounding it. To aid in the process, the crusaders built another typical siege engine called a cat (chatte). Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay refers to it as a four-wheeled wagon covered in oxhides[124] and William of Tudela properly refers to them as “cats built both large and small.”[125] Also dating back to Roman times, a cat was a mobile wooden tower sometimes constructed with several levels and protected by animal skins to shield it from flaming missiles and stones. These structures were wheeled up to a wall allowing sappers, miners and engineers to undermine them. In the event that a stone-throwing siege engine could not breach the walls, the cat was used as a second recourse. Like stone-throwing engines, cats were built in different sizes according to the task at hand and labeled appropriately sows (truies), pent-houses (vinae), weasels (belettes) and sentry-boxes (guerites).[126]\n\nOn 8 August, the crusaders breached the walls of the bourg and the suburb was taken. Oddly, the crusader garrison guarding the bourg was insufficient and a sortie from Carcassonne successfully set fire to the suburb before retreating into the city, leaving the crusaders empty-handed.\n\nWhile the siege of the bourg was underway, King Peter II of Aragon had arrived in Carcassonne with a contingent of men. As overlord of Carcassonne with a vested interest in the city as well as in his vassal Raymond-Roger Trencavel, his wish was to act as mediator between northern and southern forces. William of Tudela’s account is the only primary source that speaks of the diplomatic intervention of Peter II. The Aragonian monarch, accompanied by a small escort and upon witnessing the massive army of northern crusaders before him, did not wish to come to the aid of his vassal. Instead, he dined with Raymond VI in the crusader camp and then made his way into the city to speak to the young viscount. The absurd demands put forth by the typically unyielding papal legate Arnald-Amaury were unacceptable to Raymond-Roger who retorted by saying “he would defend himself inside Carcassonne to the utmost of his power.”[127]Aware of the futility of the situation, Peter left his vassal and the citizens of Carcassonne to their own devices and returned to Aragon.\n\nThe already dire situation in Carcassonne had become even more dreadful as days passed. The influx of refugees from Béziers and the surrounding villages had placed a considerable strain on the city whose water supply and victuals were rapidly dwindling. Intense summer heat coupled with the poor living conditions of livestock and humans packed closely together rendered conditions intolerable.[128] Dysentery and heat had already caused the death of many in the city while crusaders were enjoying access to water and the abundance of the surrounding villages. Both Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay and William of Tudela mention the plentiful availability and reasonable price of bread “sold at thirty loaves for a penny.”[129]\n\nAround 15 August, the crusaders offered Raymond-Roger a chance to discuss terms. He accepted and made his way into the crusader camp escorted by a hundred knights. Unexpectedly, the viscount placed himself at the complete mercy of the crusaders. The sources do not disclose the reasons “he deliberately and of his own free will made himself a hostage.”[130] They do reveal, however, the deplorable conditions by which the citizens of Carcassonne were to leave the city. They were to do so “in their shifts and breeches, and allow the crusaders to take possession of it, whilst the viscount himself should remain as a hostage until the conditions agreed were fulfilled.”[131] Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay alludes to the religious nature of the crusade saying “all the inhabitants came naked out of the city, bearing nothing but their sins.”[132]Raymond-Roger Trencavel was imprisoned in Carcassonne and died later that year of dysentery.[133]\n\nThe taking of Carcassonne by the crusaders offers a compelling contrast to that of Béziers just a few weeks prior. Carcassonne was taken by traditional siege methods, not by surprise. The conventions of medieval warfare dictated a certain modus operandi by which the attackers would attempt the capture of the city and by which the besieged would strive to defend it. At Carcassonne the crusader army was large enough to surround the entire city making ingress and egress impossible for its citizens. The water supply to the city, the determining factor in many sieges, was quickly cut off by the crusaders. The northerners made good use of siege engines against the weak fortifications of the suburbs with the added expertise of miners and sappers. The summer heat and the sudden overpopulation of the city expedited the French victory. As martial custom dictated, terms were offered to the defeated.\n\nIn contrast, the burning of Béziers was beneficial as it instilled fear in the hearts of any southern towns that contemplated forming a resistance. But it was also damaging to the crusaders because of the loss of a wealthy city from which to establish a base of operations. Carcassonne would not meet the same fate because “if the city were altogether destroyed, there would not be found a nobleman of the army who would undertake the government of the country.”[134] Thus Carcassonne escaped the flames and became the crusaders’ headquarters for the remainder of the Albigensian Crusade while the evidence points to the preservation of the city being done for strategic and pecuniary reasons.\n\nWhat sets the siege of Carcassonne apart from subsequent ones in the Albigensian Crusade is the treatment of its citizens. In the majority of sieges, if the besieged surrendered, their lives would be spared but they would be forced out of the city. The public humiliation endured by the citizens of Carcassonne was rather atypical. There is no clear answer as to why they were told to leave barely clothed. Was this was retribution for their truculence? Did it have a deeper connotation as Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay suggested? Were they stripped of their garments to expose their sins as heretics? Conjecture remains plausible as the sources do not mention the reasons.\n\nSimon IV de Montfort\n\nThe pillage of Béziers still fresh in their mind and wishing to avoid a repeat of the calamitous event, the crusade leaders gathered with the legate Arnald-Amaury to discuss the necessity of electing a leader for the crusade to whom all the wealth of the city would be given. The flame of heresy had not been stifled despite the victories at Béziers and Carcassonne. A secular noble dedicated to the Church and to its mission would need to be chosen to spearhead the expedition for the months and years to come. Uprooting the deeply embedded heresy required a crusade leader willing to remain in Languedoc until the issue would be resolved to the Church’s satisfaction. Sufficient compensation was therefore needed to entice a secular leader to accept this precarious task. The legates “could not have predicted…that by giving the noble extensive properties and the incentive to acquire more from those deemed guilty of heresy or of protecting heretics, [they] in fact set the stage for an endemic war with political rather than religious objectives.”[135] Several lords declined the offer but one name in particular stood out, the French noble Simon IV de Montfort, the titular Count of Leicester.\n\nMontfort was urged to join the crusade in Languedoc at the behest of the abbot Guy of les Vaux-de-Cernay. He declined the papal legate’s offer on several occasions but finally succumbed to the pressure by his peers who promised him lifelong support as well as the full backing of the pope and of the Church.[136]Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay, William of Tudela and William of Puylaurens all affirm the strong physical and leadership qualities of Monfort. The sycophantic Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay describes him as tall and handsome with an excellent physique and commends his eloquence of speech, his congeniality and chastity, wisdom and humility.[137] Moreover, the sources agree that Montfort was dedicated to God, was of noble birth and already possessed an illustrious military career.\n\nMontfort’s devotion to the Church was made manifest by his behavior during the Fourth Crusade at the beginning of the thirteenth century. Pope Innocent III’s Fourth Crusade was sent forth from Europe to retake the Holy Land by way of Egypt. After eighty-eight years of Christian rule, the Sultan Saladin had conquered the crusaders and reclaimed Jerusalem for Islam. Innocent, whose heart was set on the retaking of Jerusalem, believed the whole of Christendom should be mobilized for the effort. He organized the expedition but maintained little control over it once the Christian armies set sail.[138] Broken promises, a lack of funds, and a personal vendetta harbored by the Doge of Venice helped to divert the crusade as soon as it had begun. Years earlier, the Venetians had lost the port city of Zara on the Dalmatian coast. Although it remained a Christian city under the rule of Emeric of Hungary, a crusader king and papal vassal, the doge convinced the crusader army to attack it. A group of crusaders led by Simon de Montfort disapproved forcefully of this diversion but were overruled by a majority vote.[139] Montfort believed the diversion to be a flagrant perversion of the crusade and attacking Christians was not the goal of the expedition. He returned home with his entourage before the city fell in November 1202.[140]\n\nMontfort’s piety was matched by his political ambitions. The honor bestowed upon him as leader of the crusade would fulfill three of his desires: first, as a low-ranking noble with little land, the territories he acquired throughout Languedoc would be added to his own to enlarge the patrimony for his family; second, his spiritual duties would be met under the aegis of the Church; third, his desire for worldly wealth would be fulfilled as a result of his southern conquests. As a crusader noble living in the thirteenth century, these aspirations drove Montfort in Languedoc as they did many others in the Levant.[141] Monfort was forty-four years of age when he became leader of the northern forces in the Albigensian Crusade in 1209 and he occupied this position until his death nine years later. The challenges that stretched before him were riddled with frustration due to lack of promised support and perpetually meager funds. Although he met with much success throughout his career in Languedoc, he was plagued by constant rebellions by southern towns he had previously subdued, a lack of decisive direction and guidance from the pope, and the constant and exasperating departure of northern forces once their forty-days of required service had ended.\n\nAs crusade leader and newly appointed Viscount of Béziers and Carcassonne in place of Raymond-Roger Trencavel, Montfort’s objective was to subdue as many castra as he could and to place crusader garrisons in each one before moving on to the next. Their forty-days having come to an end and their indulgence having been fulfilled according to ecclesial decree, a substantial portion of the army left Montfort and headed home after the capitulation of Carcassonne. This placed the new leader in a serious predicament. The few that remained with him were not enough to garrison the cities they had already captured while laying siege to new ones. In ideal campaigning conditions, cities would surrender quickly to a large army. In this case, with the cold season approaching and a dearth of crusading personnel, these southern towns quickly rebelled against their new lord.[142] The manifold personal letters Montfort sent to Innocent III assured the vicar of his commitment to remain in the south until heresy was eradicated. They also included requests for money to be sent to convince the few crusader knights to remain with him. There are no concrete figures for the army that stayed with Montfort but William of Tudela mentions a number of nobles who would become some of Montfort’s most trusted men and stay loyal to him until the end.[143] These nobles must have been accompanied by their own contingents so it can be surmised that the chief crusader had an army of several hundred men including the mercenaries he personally paid. At any rate the size of the remaining army would have been a fraction of the original one that fought at Béziers and Carcassonne.\n\nThe remainder of 1209 was spent marching through the territories of Languedoc subduing fortified towns through intimidation.
