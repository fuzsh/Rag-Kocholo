        "text": "I’d circled this building 3 times. There was no signage, no Spanish shield, not even a Spanish flag welcome mat. I finally asked the doorman of the supposed address and he indicated me to the 500th floor or so in the Chicago office. After getting off the elevator I was face to face with a singular 16×20 picture of the King of Spain hung on a white wall, staring through a glass door. I’d either found the consulate or a lazy shrine to Felipe VI. I opened the door and zeroed in on the counter, sliding the neatly organized documents through the window and backed away slowly. Applying to live in Spain felt like Cameron Diaz-ing my way through a laser sensored safe room: either I land the backflip, grab my visa, or I’d slip, set off all the lasers in my life, and get stuck looking for a way out.\n\nIn the elevator I sought the cold refuge of the metal walls. Leaning my head back and closing my eyes, just then my elevator neighbor asked me if I was going to Spain. I lolled my head and looked up at him under my brow, “Yes.”\n\n“Where are you going?” He was curious.\n\n“Tudela.”\n\n“Buah, they have the best asparagus there.” He said and got off the elevator.\n\nAt the time I was vegan and hoping to continue that trend in my new city, so hearing about the asparagus was a relief, but most importantly it reminded me that I hadn’t done any research on the city I was about to live in for the next year. I got home and googled “Tudela.” The first thing that came up was an article about Game of Thrones being filmed there. Satisfied, I opened the article, scrolled through the images, nodded, and went on with my tight schedule before departure.\n\nSurprisingly, my scroll didn’t delve much into the city itself. Besides the Dothraki desert some 20 km outside of the city, the actual culture and demographics were unknown to me. After more research and living there for a year, I’ve learned that Tudela is an ancient city nestled between a surreal desert, the Iberian mountain range, and the widest river in Spain. In the south of Navarra and on the border of La Rioja, Tudela shares a border with Basque country and the third largest city in Spain, Zaragoza. At the far South of Navarra, Tudela is not characteristic of Basque country, in culture nor in nature, but the otherworldly nature that surrounds this city is full of miraculous differences.\n\nThe Bardenas Reales, a expansive desert cousin of the Grand Canyon, lies about 20 kilometers outside of the city limits. You have to go there by car. There is no bus. I’ve checked, multiple times. Dropping hints in the break room atwork will eventually get you a ride out there, and the dry golden space releases a silence sought after by many. Climbing up the mountains forms you can see the wind and water shaped rocks, and on a particularly dry day you can descend into the thirsty creeks that run beneath. If you’re lucky, you may even see the shadow of a sheep heard ambling through.\n\nOn the other side of Tudela, Moncayo rolls calmly, snow capped in the winter. Another daydream for us without cars, use the break room technique for the same effect. The tallest peak of the Iberian mountain range, Moncayo is a green refuge away from the dusty parks within the city. Trees, moss, and plants grace various paths, from deep forests to dirt paths you can make your own adventure at the mountain.\n\nFinally, running along the edge of the city is the widest river in Spain, the Río Ebro. A vital part of the city’s history and a source for their rich soil, us carless peasants can actually walk to this wonder. Although not as beautiful as the Río Guadalquivir in Sevilla, and with less sunbathing students, the river offers a peace minutes from the city center.\n\nSilence in the city is not hard to find, besides the further escapes to the mountains or the desert, the Corazón de Jesus and Santa Quiteria, are pine covered hills to admire the sunset or take a stroll. The Corazón de Jesus is one large hill with a statue of Jesus at the top, looking out over the Bardenas or Moncayo depending on the side. Santa Quiteria is the closest to a forest that Tudela has, with bare legged short pines and plenty of colorful stones. At both places you can find colonies of snails climbing up the sharp stick bushes.\n\nAside from the nature around and in Tudela, the history ancient and varied. There is evidence of inhabitants in this zone from the Neolithic period, and significant Roman remains have been unearthed, such as well preserved mosaics, and it began to grow as an important Moorish city in the 9th century. Tudela is now known as “La ciudad de tres culturas” or “the city of three cultures” for its history of muslims, jews, and christians all living in harmony in the same city. I had the opportunity to visit the archives of the city and look through the oldest documents from Tudela. Speaking with one of the archivists she assured me that “living in harmony” really meant living separately and tolerating each other. Despite the accuracy of the harmony, the city still values this culture and houses many moorish, jewish, and christian architecture that are remarkable.\n\nThe “puente del ebro” or the Ebro bridge was built in the Middle ages and crosses the river with 17 arches of different shapes and sizes. Coming into the city from this bridge you will encounter surrounding “murallas” or defensive walls built in the moorish reign, protecting the city from attack. Amongst many churches, the cathedral of Tudela is unique and located in the Plaza Nueva. Tucked in a corner street beside the archives is one entryway, where an archivolt depicts the last judgement above the Puerta del Juicio, or Door of Judgement. The images are separated into those who will enter into the gates of heaven on the left, and those who will descend into hell on the right. Those on the right are subhuman and grotesque, with animal parts and distorted features. Those on the left, saintly, in robes. The peculiarity of the entrance is amplified by the 8 rows that make up this archivolt. As you enter, you pass beneath this wide arch of faces and demons, descending in the dark, cool Cathedral. As you leave, you can wander through the narrow streets and run into the main route for bars. Bars in Spain are like fast food to the US, you can’t go more than a block without running into one. The bar culture here is not left at the door, as most people stand in the streets outside of the bar, laughing, talking, and moving from bar to bar throughout the night.\n\nStereotypes of culture in the north are of people as cold and isolating as the winters. They are obviously not the real experience of northern Spain, but do touch Tudela in small ways. What I have experienced, and something that is reflective in Tudela, is the tight-knit friend groups, or cuadrillas, that exist in northern Spain. Their closeness can leave an outsider feeling lost on how to relate, how to enter into a group that has known each other since first grade, particularly as a foreigner. I was extremely lucky to meet an incredible group of people who weren’t just my friends because we wanted to practice languages, or because I desperately needed to get out of the house. Not everyone has this fortune, many friends of mine have relayed their trouble finding groups of friends in Pamplona, Zaragoza, and even Madrid.\n\nAt first I felt this way, worried that I would never find a group I fit in with. My only other experience in Spain was the time that I felt I most easily made friends. After 2 months of being in Sevilla, due to their general in-the-street lifestyle and tendency to strike up a conversation with even the worst Spanish speaker, I had a solid group of friends, who I’m still friends with today. In Tudela it took me about 4 months to meet a group that I genuinely felt a connection with, and after that it took a few more months to solidify my position in the group. Despite the slightly longer interview period, my experience in Tudela has overall been that people are open, friendly, and charming. My coworkers are truly a family, a support system that makes living abroad so much easier, knowing you have people interested in your well being and even your day to day life. Tudela truly is every auxiliar’s dream placement, it is an authentic Spanish city with incredible traditions, history, and daily life that allows you to learn Spanish in the streets and feel apart of the city and the culture.\n\nThe modern culture that I feel apart of now is much like the one in Sevilla, minus the stellar weather year round. We go out every Saturday, sometimes until 3 or 4…or 8… Walking home with the morning joggers is an episode of the Twilight Zone for drunks, one that I only like to re-watch occasionally. It gets a little trickier during the Fiestas of Santa Ana or any other festival where the peñas open up to the public. Peñas are a type of social club that own bars throughout the city, and the preferred party location if available. Normally private, the members are paid by the local government to open up during festivals. At the peñas the drinks and food are cheaper, and the atmosphere is more communal than any bar. In order to find people you have to know where the peñas are, most of which are also within 5 minutes of each other, but may be tucked away in the skinny streets.\n\nAside from the ease of getting around Tudela, the main attraction and world wide fame comes from the vegetables that grow here,and the dishes that Tudelanos have elaborated over years and years of rich soil bliss. Due to the Mejana, an island that formed in the Rio Ebro, and the climate and geography, Tudela is able to grow a vast variety of vegetables, practically all year long. The vegetables most known from Tudela are:\n\nCogollos: A small buttery lettuce that is often served quartered with tuna, red peppers, hard boiled eggs, asparagus, oil and vinegar. A baby romaine, if you will.\n\nAlcachofas (Artichokes): A versatile vegetable, typically the hearts are the main star of the plant, cooked stove top or even eaten raw.\n\nBorraja (Borage): This vegetable I had never heard of until arriving to Tudela, and it is my favorite discovery I have made since. Shaped similarly to Swiss Chard, but with thinner shoots and smaller, darker leaves, borraja is typically served as just the shoots, with the hairs carefully sliced off before steaming. When I first moved here I lived with a Tudelana and she taught me the way her mother would make borraja. She said it isn’t necessary to peel the hairs off, and that the leaves add extra flavor and texture. By slicing the shoots in half to fit into a medium size pot, she threw all the pieces in without water or oil and let the water from the plant steam itself for about 5 minutes. Serve with raw olive oil and a bit of salt and it will melt in your mouth.\n\nEspárragos (Asparagus): Not the typical skinny green stalks we all know and love, but thick white stalks that are typically served cold. Extremely juicy and flavorful, typically an asparagus plate is eaten with mayonnaise, but they are also feature guests in salads and menestras.\n\nTomate Feo de Tudela (Ugly Tomato from Tudela): The most beautiful, decadent tomatoes the size of a soft ball.\n\nThese are only the most characteristic vegetables of Tudela, the wealth of vegetables and fruits available in this town is extensive and the quality is the richest I’ve ever had. With these vegetables there is one very important dish that Tudela is known for, and that is the menestra. A delicate process of precooking then incorporating artichokes, asparagus, peas, beans, with ham, olive oil, and garlic, this is vibrant with the sweetness of each vegetables. Navarra in general is known for this dish, as well as their pinchos or pintxos, which consist of a small portion of food on top of or accompanied with a slice of a baguette. Typical pinchos are combinations or single servings of tortilla de patata (Spanish omelettes), txistorra (a spicier sausage), jamón serrano (prosciutto style ham), croquetas (fried potato balls), fritos (fried food), patatas bravas (potato wedges with mayo and a “spicy” tomato sauce), as well as unique and eclectic pintxos from individual bars.\n\nAs a vegetarian in Tudela it breaks my heart so often that I have a difficult time eating out. Any pincho that has a vegetable is usually accompanied by ham. Ham is so ingrained as a food staple that when I tell people I am a vegetarian their question is always “Y el jamón?” The ham is fantastic in Spain, I have tried is as I am not a lifelong vegetarian. But the vegetables are more noteworthy. Artichokes are bought by the dozen. Asparagus sold as long as my forearm. In the local market open everyday except Sunday, you can buy a weeks worth of vegetarian meal supplies for less than 10 euros, including fruit and even a bag of homemade olives. In almost all of Spain the fresh vegetable selection is lightyears ahead of the US, but in Tudela particularly so. Wherever you go you encounter conversations on the vegetables served in a meal. I counted the times I heard a conversation specifically about an artichoke one week, and all 7 days I overheard, in the streets, in a bar, at school, someone discussing artichokes. The surprise ending was on my way down the street I passed a family and the father pushing a baby in a stroller. In that stroller, clutched in the boy’s tiny palm like a security blanket, was an artichoke.\n\nThe only other time I’ve seen people this devoted to food was that one time I lived in the faraway land of Sevilla. Practically a different country, according to the locals, the South and North of Spain vary in food, climate, traditions, but come together on one topic. The love that breaches haircuts and joins together flamenco dancers and jota dancers alike, is the jamón. The fruits of the Spanish inquisition, jamón is the favorite child of Spain, and to deny its excellency is blasphemy. During the Inquisition, bars and families began to hang up legs of ham in the windows so that onlookers would see how not Jewish they were. Eventually they grew to enjoy the convenience and pleasing decoration and kept the tradition, where many families will have an entire leg of ham, in a special leg of ham holder, sitting on their kitchen counter.\n\nTudela is not all celebration and food, pintxos and partying. Living in Tudela awoke me to the notion that living in a different country is not unlike living in your own. Living here is starting a new life, creating new responsibilities for myself. I volunteer, I go to dinners when I don’t feel like it, I don’t travel every weekend because it’s a friends birthday or I have to clean the kitchen because seriously. I live an incredibly boring life sometimes and I couldn’t be more grateful. Living abroad is portrayed as a grand adventure, something you can only do once and while you’re young and don’t hate everything. People tell you to seize every travel opportunity you can before it slips through your quickly aging fingers. Travel is essential to my time here, but sitting around with my friends talking is more essential. Without a community of support, all I would have would be my own outside experiences. The friends I have made here are friends I will have for the rest of my life. I have seen what their lives are like, lived what they live, and discovered what makes this city so wonderful thanks to them. Living here means that I have one more home to visit for the holidays."
