        "text": "Abstract\n\nIn course of the early centuries of Arab rule Andalus had been steadily Arabicied and Islamicized. But even in the latter half of the ninth century the Arabs and the muwalladun, the Muslim indigenous people, had not yet lost their identity and hated each other. On the other hand the muwallad noblemen, who had concluded treaties with the Arabs at the time of their conquest, largely preserved their traditional prerogatives over their men and continued to rule their vast domains on condition that they should pay tributes to the Arab authority in token of the allegiance. Sometimes they stopped paying tributes and attacked cities, villages, and highways under the governmental rule. Under the rather strong rule of Hakam I and Abd al-Rahman II. helped by the foreign mercenaries and the muwallad noblemen incorporated in the governmental army, the Umayyads steadilv strengthened their rule over the muwallad noblemen and threatened their traditional status. Many muwallad noblemen reacted by taking arms against the Umayyads. Among them were Banu Qasi of Tudela, Banu Marwan of Merida, Daysam b. Ishaq of Tudmir, and Umar b. Hafsun of Reiyo. Umar succeeded in gainig support of his men and the indigenous people of the adjacent regions, both muwalladun and Christians, by appealing to their anti-Arab feeling. He armed them and settled them in the forts on tops of the mountains. Many other muwallad noblemen imitated him and allied with him. Thus Umar succeeded in founding a rather large state and even planned to supplant the the Umayyads for a while. On the other hand the Islamicization and the mingling of Arabs and muwalladun completed in the capital Cordoba and its environs. They had demanded the Umayyad amirs to respect Islam and shari a and even rioted against Hakam I. Later in the amirate of Abdullah the Umayyads succeeded in embodying themselves as Islamic State and began to gain the support of all the Muslims, both Arabs and muwalladun, Even Umar's muwallad men began to waver. Umar increasingly had to rely on the Christians. This is why he converted to Christianity. His conversion in its turn led to the defection of his muwallad men. After Abd al-Rahman III destroyed his state he took the title of the caliph, and thereby completing the Islamicization of the State."
