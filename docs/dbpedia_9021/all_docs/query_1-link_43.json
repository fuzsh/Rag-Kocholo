        "text": "Medieval Hispano-Roman Muslim dynasty in Iberia\n\nThe Banu Qasi, Banu Kasi, Beni Casi (Arabic: بني قسي or بنو قسي, meaning \"sons\" or \"heirs of Cassius\"), Banu Musa, or al-Qasawi were a Muladí (local convert) dynasty that in the 9th century ruled the Upper March, a frontier territory of the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba, located on the upper Ebro Valley. At their height in the 850s, family head Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi was so powerful and autonomous that he would be called 'The Third Monarch of Hispania'. In the first half of the 10th century, an intra-family succession squabble, rebellions and rivalries with competing families, in the face of vigorous monarchs to the north and south, led to the sequential loss of all of their land."
