        "text": "Medieval Europe certainly saw its fair share of unique and interesting characters, and Portugal, created in the 9th century though more involved with the Reconquista than with the dealings north of the Pirenees, was no exception. Here are five personalities whom I consider to be the some of the most interesting of medieval Portugal.\n\nCount Sisnando of Coimbra: Sisnando Davides ruled the County of Coimbra, south of the County of Portugal and separate from it, as a vassal of Leon between 1064 and 1091, though he often signed as, and was addressed by various titles, such as \"count\", \"consul\" and \"vizier\". What's interesting is that he was raised at the court of Cordoba, where he met Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (El Cid) and later served the Muslim administration at Seville. He was the one who encouraged Ferdinand I of Leon to capture Coimbra (which was then attributed to him). He married the daughter of the Count of Portugal Nuno Mendes. A culturally arabic Christian, he was therefore a mozarab, and one of those people who existed \"between two worlds\" so to speak, but apparently not at all inconvenienced by it, which is why I find him so interesting. He was reputed as a \"judge-like\" figure and a fair one at that.\n\nAfonso I - The first King of independent Portugal, Afonso was the grandson of King Alfonso VI of Leon, Galicia, Castille, and Emperor of Hispania; his mother was the emperors bastard daughter Teresa, married to a Burgundian knight, Henry, third son of Duke Robert I of Burgundy. As the heir to the county of Portugal, Afonso was encouraged by the Portuguese nobles to take the reigns of governance from her mother and her Galician supporters, defeating them at the Battle of São Mamede in 1128, which did not mean independence, since they were still vassals to Afonso VII of Leon. Later he took the title of \"rex\" at the Battle of Ourique in 1139 - which did not necessarily mean independence either, since even as a \"king\" he was still a vassal to the \"Emperor of Hispania\". It was only in 1140 that he finally rebelled against Afonso VII, and formally acquired independence and recognition as king after the Battle of Valdevez, seemingly more of a limited clash involving only the nobility on either side. The Pope recognized his claim to kingship in 1179.\n\nFor a medieval monarch, Afonso was extremely long-lived, having ruled till his death in 1185 yet in every aspect he was a \"warrior-king\". He fought the Galicians, Leonese, captured Lisbon and various other cities from the Muslims and personally led various raiding expeditions deep into Muslim territory, which made him extremely wealthy also. He was popular with his Christian subjects and fair towards the Jews and Muslims living in his territory. He does not seem to have been a \"details man\" however: upon returning to Coimbra from a successful raid on Muslim lands, the the bishop of that city had to tell him that the \"moors\" he captured, even though they spoke Arabic and dressed in Muslim fashion, were, infact, mozarabs.\n\nGeraldo Geraldes \"the Fearless\": Frequently compared to El Cid due to their similar lifestyles, Geraldo Geraldes was something more of a bandit warlord who lived in the frontier with a band of warriors that raided Muslim territory, and reserved whatever little loyalty he had to Afonso I of Portugal. A highly independent and unpredictable fellow, very much outside the usual noble society sorrounding King Afonso, he captured various castles in the Alentejo and Spanish Extremadura, and captured the city of Évora, which he gifted to Afonso. He captured cities using a tactic popular in the Reconquista (which Afonso also made use of): scaling the walls at night and taking the garrison unawares. He later joined the Almohads out of necessity, but was sent to Morocco and executed when he was caught trying to play double-game with Afonso.\n\nDom Yahia ben Yahia \"the Black\": Perhaps the most obscure and surprising character in this list, Yahia ben Yahia was the rabbi of the Jewish population of Santarém when that city was captured by the Christians in 1147. He participated in the taking of Lisbon that year, and King Afonso nominated him his superintendent of finances and chief-rabbi of his kingdom, and granted him him not only the noble title of \"Dom\" (\"lord\") but also a coat of arms - which had the shape of a black head on a field of silver - and even land. He was dubbed O ..... (\"the Black\") not because of his skincolour but because of the village he was the lord of, called A dos Negros (\"Village of the Blacks\") near Óbidos. He was the first member of a dynasty of Jewish lords that served the Portuguese kings as chief-rabbis and finance ministers.\n\nIbn Qasi - The most unusual in this list, infact probably few characters in the entire history of the Reconquista were as bizarre as Ibn Qasi. Born at Silves to a distinguished muladi family, Abu Ibn Qasi was probably one of the few people in Medieval Europe to still claim a Roman lineage outside Constantinople, though his connection to the Banu Qasi clan (literally, \"Sons of Cassius\", which in the 9th century enacted a revolt against the Emirate of Cordoba) is unclear. He served as tax-collector of his home city, yet Islamic sources suspiciously describe him as \"prodigal\". He experienced a religious epyphany, roamed the Andalus in pilgrimage and later donated all his assets to open a small sufi monastery. With his followers, dubbed Muridun, he organized a massive rebellion against the Almoravid dynasty, that succeeded in taking over the entire Gharb al-Andalus south of the Tagus river. Betrayed by the qadi of Évora however, he fled to the side of the Almohads, which took him in and placed him as their governor of Silves... until he rebelled against them too. He was murdered in his home in 1151 when he attempted to strike an alliance with Afonso I of Portugal.\n\nMedieval Europe certainly saw its fair share of unique and interesting characters, and Portugal, created in the 9th century though more involved with the Reconquista than with the dealings north of the Pirenees, was no exception.

The major problem is that for the 12th century the sources are really scarce in more personal details. From the list above the one that we know better is, naturally, D. Afonso Henriques. Even so…\n\nThe last sentence that you wrote about him was already mentioned in this forum. The story is taken form the hagiography \"Vita Sancti Theotonii\".\n\nMedieval Europe certainly saw its fair share of unique and interesting characters, and Portugal, created in the 9th century though more involved with the Reconquista than with the dealings north of the Pirenees, was no exception.

He was murdered in his home in 1151 when he attempted to strike an alliance with Afonso I of Portugal.\n\nCondado de Portugal formed delineated in 868 I believe, as the land between the Douro and the Minho?\n\nThe Almoravid dynasty collapsed anyway, everybody was rebelling all over. It must have been at the very end, as exhibited by the Almohads being present in Portugal.\n\nThe Banu Qasi were Visigothic, one of many such clans ruling in the chaos of 8th and 9th century Al Andalus. People like Cassius, Paulus were Dux under the Visigoths, so not necessarily Roman at all. Current thinking is that they were Gothic.\n\nThe timeline of events of the Reconquista, let alone the Andalus, can be confusing. Regarding the Almoravids, the beginning of their end started with Ibn Qasi. \"Everybody was rebelling all over\" because the \"revolt of the Muridun\" caused the edifice to implode in Iberia, it was far from a small thing. The Almohads were not at all \"present in Portugal\", as it was none other than Ibn Qasi who approached Abd al-Mu'min in Morocco and proposed that he invade Iberia, causing an army to land in Tarifa in the spring of 1146, commanded by Berraz al-Massufi, and that dealt the finishing blow to the Almoravids.\n\nI was quoting you:\n\n\"he fled to the side of the Almohads, which took him in and placed him as their governor of Silves..\"\n\nThe Almoravids were a berber empire based in Marrakesh, their presence in Al Andalus was transient and the decadence there, imported to Morocco, contributed to their downfall. Apart from the final siege/slaughter of Marrakesh 1147, their final end, after 20 years of campaign by Abd Al Mu'min, was around Tremecen, Oran and the time of the death of Reverte and the Emir Tashufin Ibn Ali in 1145 and 1146. Spain is a poor side-show\n\nThe peak of Almoravid power in Spain came following the death of El Cid 1099, the consequent evacuation of Valencia by Castille (which opened up all the country up to the conquest of Zaragoza), the catastrophic Castillian defeat at Ucles. But they soon lost Zaragoza and never had enough troops in Spain to follow up their victories (Ucles was acheived with garrison troops from Granada and Malaga who, having opened up all the country and exposed Toledo itself, went back to their base) - they never had the respurces to exploit their wins. After the fall of Zaragoza and then Cutanda (against Aragon and local muslims), it was all downhill and the emergence of the Almohads meant less and less troops could be held in Spain. At some point each governor had to decide whether to jump ship and the 2nd Taifa period was upon Spain. By then Almoravid power was long gone, except in the Balearics, where the Banu Ganiya ruled for another nearly 60 years until finally conquered by Ali b Reverter, son of Reverter, who himself fought for the Almohads as a hero.\n\nIn retrospect the Almoravids were a sort of poor man's prototype for the Almohads and Ibn Tumart El Mahdi. Their respective declines were similar, though the Almohads took longer.\n\nAs far as your Portugal is concerned (I thought the sayyid Yusuf landed at Tavira around 1146 - may have been earlier) there was nothing joined up at all in the Almoravids by then - it was every man for himself as far as the governors were concerned. Portugal especially took advantage of the vacuum between the Almoravid collapse and the time it took the Almohads to clean up Ifriqiya and be able to project large force into Spain, to expand it's frontiers. Castille and Leon less so and the others not much, due to the large and rich kingdom of Ibn Mardanish, El Rey Lobo, who kept the Almohads at bay for decades from progress to the east and north.\n\nAbd Al Mu'min was an incredibly cruel and dedicated leader, allegedly with a look that could turn anyone to a dribbling wreck. Even though great Caliphs like Yaqub Al Mansur were very cruel, at least he had relaxed a bit on the cultural front!\n\nPretty sure I wouldn't have popped over to see him in Marrakesh!!\n\nMust admit I can't recall your man Ibn Qasi, who is obviously a bit of a hero around Silves - although so many names pop through your head. Wiki merely tells us this:\n\nAbūʾl-Qāsim Aḥmad ibn al-Ḥusayn ibn Qasī (died 1151) was a Sufi, a rebel leader against the Almoravid dynasty in Al-Garb Al-Andalus and governor of Silves for the Almohads. The main sources for his life are Ibn al-Abbār, Ibn al-Khaṭīb and ʿAbd al-Wāḥid al-Marrakūshī. The last is the source for his biography in the biographical dictionary of al-Ṣafadī.[1]\n\nHe was of native Iberian stock, rūmī al-aṣl in the words of Ibn al-Abbār. He was born at Silves, but the date of his birth is unknown. His name sustains the possibility that he was a descendant of the Banu Qasi, that had once staged a rebellion against the Emirate of Cordoba.[2] According to Ibn al-Abbār, he was a minor government official at Silves, while Ibn al-Khaṭīb describes him as a spendthrift. He eventually sold all his goods, gave the money to the poor and became a murīd. He studied under Khalaf Allāh al-Andalusī and Ibn Khalīl in Niebla, although he may also have met Ibn al-ʿArīf in Almería. His main influences were the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity (Ibn al-Abbār) and the works of al-Ghazālī (Ibn al-Khaṭīb).[1]\n\nIbn Qasī wrote a treatise \"the Removal of the Sandals\", this book revolves around Ibn Qasi's Philosophy, Sufism and History. Ibn Arabi has written a commentary on some parts of this treatise.\n\nHe was also an ally and friend of Afonso Henriques, first king of Portugal, and this association eventually led to his assassination at Silves in 1151.\n\nI don't think he looms large in the overall history of the berber empires if I'm honest"
