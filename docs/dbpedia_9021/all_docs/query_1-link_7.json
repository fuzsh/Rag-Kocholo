        "text": "Name seen as Oria (Aurea) Bint Ibn Musa Banu Qasi. She was the wife of Fortún Garcés el Monje, rey de Pamplona\n\nAuria—also known as Oria—was an early consort of Pamplona. She is known from a single historical source, the Códice de Roda, which only gives her name and not her parentage. Historian and professor Antonio Rei has put forward the hypothesis that she could have been the granddaughter of Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi,[1] while genealogist Christian Settipani suggested this and two other alternatives when addressing her possible parentage.[2]\n\nBiography\n\nFortún Garcés of Pamplona (Wikipedia)\n\nFortún Garcés (Basque: Orti Gartzez; died 922) nicknamed the One-eyed (el Tuerto), and years later the Monk (el Monje), was king of Pamplona from 870/882 until 905. He appears in Arabic records as Fortoûn ibn Garsiya (فرتون بن غرسية). He was the eldest son of García Iñíguez and grandson of Íñigo Arista, the first king of Pamplona. Reigning for about thirty years, Fortún Garcés would be the last king of the Íñiguez dynasty.\n\nFortún was born at an unknown date, being the eldest son of García Íñiguez,[1] king of Pamplona, and a woman named Urraca, who could have been the granddaughter of Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi, the leader of the Banu Qasi clan.[2]\n\nFortún Garcés permanently retired to the Monastery of Leyre in 905,[6] where he died in 922.[7]\n\nFortún was married to Auria, whose undocumented origin has been subject to conflicting speculation,[8][9] to whom the Códice de Roda assigns the following children:[10]\n\nÍñigo Fortúnez, married to Sancha Garcés, daughter of García Jiménez of Pamplona and Onecca 'rebel of Sancosa'.\n\nAznar Fortúnez; little is known about him.\n\nVelasco Fortúnez, who had three children: Jimena, wife of Íñigo Garcés, son of García Jiménez of Pamplona.\n\nLope Fortúnez\n\nOnneca Fortúnez, according to the Códice de Roda first married to Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi of Córdoba[11] and later to Aznar Sánchez of Larraun, with whom she had three children, including Queens Toda and Sancha of Pamplona.[1] However, the order of Onneca's marriages has been questioned, as has the identity of Fortún's daughter as the Onneca who married Abdullah.[12]\n\nThere is a huge inaccuracy on this page in the lowest parts of the text written by someone adding information earlier sometime, because :\n\nThe Banu Qasi were NOT a christian family who converted to islam, they were descendants of ONE visigoth who converted to islam and whose family largely remained muslim, for the exception of a few later members that converted to christianity. This means they were not at large european christians who just practiced islam, but they would have also mainly been married to other muslims, despite of also having married into the royal families of the christian kingdoms -which makes a big difference in how this family is presented in the lowest part of this textpage.\n\nHere is a proper source in its original form:\n\n\"ORDO NVMERVM REGVM PAMPILONENSIVM\n\n1.

IX] Queen consort of Pamplona, wife of Fortún Garcés. Also called Oria or Golden\n\nAwriya bint Lubb was probably the daughter of Lubb ben, the son of M.T. ben, of the Ban Qas, and of Ayab al-Bulatiyya.\"\n\n( https://www.condadodecastilla.es/personajes/awriya-ben-lubb-u-oria/ )\n\nThere is no reason to question these conclusions, large part of the land that is now Spain and Portugal, was in moorish control and called Al Andalus. Awriya is definitely an arabic sounding name and the Auria/Oria is most likely just a spanification of that name, not the other way around. Most is not all spaniards and portuguese people living today, and also many people descending of these lines present guanche, north african and moorish(mixture of north african and arabic) dna-markers and clearly match ancient north african and moorish ancient samples from the time of Al Andalus -additionally to having actual arabic markers present.\n\nHere MedLands about\n\n\"BANU QASI FAMILY\n\nDescendants of a Visigoth who converted to Islam and assumed the name \"Qasi\" soon after the Moorish invasion in 711/12, this family rose to considerable prominence during the 9th and early 10th centuries in north-western Spain in the area adjacent to the Carolingian \"March\" of Spain. The sources which are quoted below show participation by the Banu Qasi family in various conflicts with their Carolingian neighbours, and it is likely that such talented local Muslim leaders represented the best hope of the emirate of Córdoba for further territorial expansion to the north. Indeed, the Muslim historian Al-Udri records that at one time (probably dated to the 850s) Muhammad Emir of Córdoba appointed Musa ibn Musa, great-grandson of the original Qasi, as \"gobernador de la Marca\", implying wide territorial responsibility[384], although the appointment was later withdrawn and was not repeated among Musa´s descendants. This passage should, however, probably not be taken as indicating that the emirate of Córdoba established its own \"March\" on the northern borders of its territories. Al-Udri´s works were written some two centuries after these events and, as a resident of Zaragoza, he must have been familiar with the local concept of \"la Marca\", probably using it in his writing as a convenient geographical descriptive term rather to indicate an established political entity on the Muslim side of the divide.\n\nVarious members of the Banu Qasi family were appointed as \"wali\" (governor, but sometimes translated as king, in the sense of \"local\" king) of the cities of Tudela and Zaragoza by the emirs of Córdoba during the second half of the 9th and early 10th centuries. However, they were unruly vassals, and the sources reveal numerous rebellions against the central authority of the emirate, especially by Musa ibn Musa and, after his death, his sons. The sources also show temporary alliances agreed, throughout the same period, between the Banu Qasi and the local Christian magnates to fight the emir or other rival local Muslim leaders. As will be seen below, these alliances were confirmed by several marriages, mainly with the family of the rulers of Pamplona, but also including single cases of intermarriage with the kings of Asturias and the counts of Pallars/Ribagorza.\n\nThe Arabic sources record four cases of members of the Banu Qasi family converting back to Christianity in the early 10th century: Fortun ibn Lubb, Fortun ibn Abd Allah, and the brothers Abd Allah and Ismail ibn Mutarif. There is no information on their descendants, but it is likely that some or all of these individuals were ancestors of nobility in the kingdom of Navarre. In this respect, the names \"Fortun\" and \"Lubb\" are particularly significant, the former being recorded frequently among Navarrese nobility and the latter presumably being transformed into the equally common \"Lope\" and its Basque equivalent \"Ochoa\" (see the document NAVARRE NOBILITY).\n\nNumerous references to the Banu Qasi family are found in the works of 10th to 13th century Muslim Spanish historians, corroborated by passages in Christian sources such as the Chronicle of Alfonso III, the Chronicon Sebastiani, the Chronicon Albeldense, and the Codex de Roda. The main primary source for reconstructing the family is the 11th century historian al-Udri. The family was studied in detail in 1980 by Alberto Cañada Juste, who compares the information extracted from all relevant sources and places the Banu Qasi in their proper historical context[385]. The recent work by Jesús Lorenzo Jiménez includes a useful appendix of Spanish translations of relevant extracts from Arabic language sources, some of which are difficult to obtain elsewhere.\"...\n\n(http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/MOORISH%20SPAIN.htm#AwriyaMGarcia)\n\nAbove text added 26th march 2024\n\nEarlier written text starts from here:\n\nAuria/Oria de Pamplona\n\nAuria [or Oria] de Pamplona of the 9th century, was the wife of Fortún Garcés.

The Codex de Roda names \"domna Oria filia de ---\" as wife of \"Furtunio Garseanis\"[99].\n\nOria (Auria, Awriya), the wife of Fortún Garcés, is known only from the Códice de Roda, which names domna Oria filia de --- (lady Oria, daughter of ---) as the wife of Furtunio Garseanis (Fortún Garcés). This codex probably dates from the late 10th century with additions for the 11th century, so it is approximately 100 years or more after her lifetime.\n\nThere is no contemporary indication of her parentage, but there several theories about her possible ancestry:\n\nAccording to the Andalusian historian Ibn Hazm (994-1064), she was married to \"Garcia, King of the Basques, from which Musa ibn Garcia was borned\" (which would make this Oria the same person as Awriya binti Musa).\n\nHistorian and professor Antonio Rei suggested she might have been a granddaughter of Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi (Rei, 44–45) (which would make this Oria a niece of the aforementioned Awriya binti Musa). The Banu Qasi were a Christian family who converted to Islam - see Conde Cassius (Qasi).)\n\nHistorian and genealogist Christian Settipani suggested she might have been a daughter of the aforementioned Awriya binti Musa and Garcia, King of the Basques. The latter would be a son of García Galíndez the Bad and his first wife Matrona, daughter of Aznar I Galíndez, count of Aragon (Settipani, 114)\n\nSettipani also suggested she might have been a daughter of García Galíndez the Bad and another Aurea (who is usually named Nunila), his second wife, the daughter of Eneko Arista (Íñigo Íñiguez \"Arista\" of Pamplona) and sister García I of Navarre (Settipani, 114).\n\nSettipani also suggested she might have been a daughter of Galindo I Aznárez, count of Aragon, and a granddaughter of Aznar I Galíndez and a third Aurea, who could be the daughter of the Duke Lupo II of Gascony and a sister of Oneca or Iniga, the mother of Eneko Arista (Íñigo Íñiguez \"Arista\" of Pamplona) and Musa Ibn Musa lbn Qasaw, Walí de Tudela, Huesca y Zaragoza (Settipani, 115).\n\nSpanish Wikipedia (citing Rei) supports the theory she was daughter of Lubb ibn Musa (Lope ibn Musa) and Ayab al Billatyya, and a granddaughter of Musa ibn Musa and Assona Iniguez but says in a footnote that her parentage is not documented. Unsourced Internet genealogies most often identify her thusly.\n\nfamily\n\nShe married [845] King Fortún Garcés of Pamplona, who died in 922. They were the parents of:\n\nÍñigo Fortúnez\n\nAznar Fortúnez\n\nVelasco Fortúnez\n\nLope Fortúnez\n\nOnneca Fortúnez, who married firstly Abdallah ibn Mohammed, Emir of Córdoba, and secondly her cousin Aznar Sánchez of Larraun, grandson of king García Íñiguez, becoming the mother of the future queens Toda Aznárez, wife of Sancho Garcés, and Sancha Aznárez, wife of king Jimena Garcés.\n\nSources"
