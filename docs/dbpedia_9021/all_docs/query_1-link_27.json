        "text": "The Umayyad conquest of Hispania occurred from 711 to 718 AD when the Arab and Berber armies of the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate invaded and conquered the Iberian Peninsula from the Germanic Visigothic Kingdom and established the province of al-Andalus. The Umayyad conquest was halted at the 718 Battle of Covadonga, leading to the establishment of the Visigothic rump state of the Kingdom of Asturias, which would eventually mount a centuries-long campaign to reconquer Iberia in the name of Christianity in the Reconquista.\n\nBackground[]\n\nIn 710 AD, following the death of the Visigothic king Wittiza, the nobles elected Roderic as the new king in defiance of the late King Witiza, whose son Achila claimed the throne for himself. Achila fled to northeastern Spain and raised the banner of civil war, while seeking outside help in his struggle against the usurper Roderic. He and the Byzantine Exarch Julian of Ceuta persuaded the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate to send an army to intervene, and, in July 710, the first 400 Muslims from North Africa arrived in Iberia on a reconnaissance mission. Having faced no resistance, they reported on the ease of their foray to the Governor of Tangier, Tariq ibn Ziyad, who led an army of 7,000-12,000 Berbers into Iberia the following spring. His camp at the base of the Roman Mons Calpe was named Jebal al-Tariq (\"Hill of Tariq\"), or \"Gibraltar\". Roderic hurried from the north with his army to meet the invaders, but he was slain during the disastrous Battle of Guadalete, and effective resistance to the Islamic invasion collapsed.\n\nTariq then sent troops toward Cordoba, where they defeated a remnants of the Visigoths on the way and took the city after a long siege. Tariq accepted the allegiance of disaffected groups such as the local Jewish communities, who had been oppressed by their Visigothic overlords. Tariq himself moved on the Visigothic capital of Toledo, which fell with ease. His overlord Musa ibn Nusayr, Governor of Northwest Africa, then arrived in Spain with a force of 18,000 Umayyads (mostly Arabs), and he conquered Carmona, Seville, and Merida. Tariq and Musa rendezvoused in Toledo and wintered there, and, in 712, Tariq went to the northwest while Musa secured the Ebro valley with the help fo the conversion to Islam of two prominent Christian families, the Banu Qasi and Banu Amrus. Musa advanced on Narbonne beyond the Pyrenees, while, in Orihuela in the south, Duke Theodemir made a favorable treaty with the Muslims which allowed for him to retain his autonomy in exchange for tribute. In 714, the Caliph in Damascus recalled Musa and Tariq to report on their conquests, leaving Musa's son Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa in command. Abd al-Aziz extended Muslim power in eastern Iberia, and, by early 716, the Muslims had conquered most of the peninsula with the exception of the far northwest and the mountainous regions of the north. Within the rest of Spain, small pockets of resistance and areas of only nominal allegiance held out, but the Muslims established a stronger rule than the Visigoths. The new Islamic province, al-Andalus (named for the former Vandal inhabitants of the region), was ruled by the Umayyad caliph in Damascus, and, in 716, the Caliph made al-Andalus part of the Governor of Tunisia's domain.\n\nFrom 716 to 756, twenty governors served in al-Andalus, although their tenures were short, makin git impossible for them to quell rising infighting among the varying factions of the leadership. When local Visigothic and Hispano-Roman landowner fled their property, Arab warriors received the best lands and Berber warriors received the wort; this practice occurred in Spain until 750. From 719 to 721, the Muslims conquered Narbonne, but they failed to advance up the Rhone in 725, took Bordeaux in 732, and were defeated by the Frankish lord Charles Martel at the decisive Battle of Tours in October 732, marking the high point of the Islamic advance in Western Europe. By 759, Charles Martel and his sons had pushed the Muslims from France and had contained them in Spain.\n\nBack in Spain, the ruling Arabs were split into rival factions such as the Qaysites and Kalbids, and friction between the Arabs and more recent converts to Islam also grew. The Arabs took pride in being the original Muslims, causing resentment among the Syrians and, especially, among the Berbers, who made up the majority of the invaders of Spain. The Berbers rebelled against the Arabs in Morocco in 740, and the Caliph sent a contingent of Syrians to Morocco to calm the unrest, but only 7,000 of 30,000 Syrian soldiers survived their defeat, and the remaining 7,000 were transferred to Spain, where they dispersed the Berbers there and remained in Spain. Overall, relatively few Muslims went to Iberia, as Tariq had commanded 12,000 Arabs, Musa 18,000 Arabs, and the Syrian contingent numbered 7,000 in 741 AD; meanwhile, the Iberian population stood at between 4 and 8 million, mainly Christian but with important Jewish communities in the larger cities. Conversions to Islam increased over time, coming from the members of the Visigothic royal house, high nobles, and influential families who converted for political expediency, as well as from lowly Visigoths and Hispano-Romans. Many Christians in al-Andalus retained their faith while adopting Muslim customs and the Arabic language, becoming known as Mozarabes, or \"Muslim-like\"."
