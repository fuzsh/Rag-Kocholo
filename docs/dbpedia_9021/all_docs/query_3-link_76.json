        "text": "Tudela, for the historical importance and for its character as a city in which different cultures coexisted in the Middle-Ages, becomes a place with an enviable monumental wealth, in both civil and religious buildings. The Cathedral is the main monument in the city and one of the most notorious in Navarra.\n\nThe church was conceived as a Collegiate of Saint Mary until 1783, year when it was raised to the dignity of Cathedral by Pius VI, at the request of King Carlos III.\n\nIt was declared a National Monument in 1884 for its historical and artistic importance.\n\nConstruction began at the end of XII century, at the same time that the Mosque located in this space was destroyed; so part of its architecture is Romanesque and as the works progressed in the thirteen century with the new Gothic style imposed and give a new vision to this temple.\n\nThe building follows the trends of the Spanish-Languedoc architecture, made under the precepts of the Cistercian order. It was constructed with well squared ashlar stone, on the remains of the old main mosque. By the year 1188 the works would be advanced enough to use it. The Archbishop of Tarragona, Don Raimundo de Rocabertí, consecrated the ara of the altar in 1204."
