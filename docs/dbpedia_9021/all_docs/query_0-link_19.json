In the context of Navarrese architectural history, however, the presence of cross-cultural forms is usually considered an anomaly or even impossibility. To come to terms with this anomaly, it is the objective of this paper to re-contextualise Santo Sepulcro geographically in order to postulate how those who built and visited the church in the 12 th century may have interpreted certain architectural elements, such as these interlacing ribbed vaults.\n\n1 I would like to thank all those who offered suggestions and encouragement at the conference. I am especially indebted to Jerrilyn Dodds, who suggested that I should focus on geography, and to Francine Giese, who kindly shared some of her extensive knowledge on interlacing ribbed vaults.\n\nImage 1. Map indicating location of Santo Sepulcro.\n\nSource: Map created by the author using Scribble Maps,https://www.scribblemaps.com/ [consultedNovember 1, 2016].\n\nFounded by the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre and dedicated to the eponymous Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, Santo Sepulcro in Torres del Río was built between 1160 and the 1180s. 2 Judging from its exterior, the building easily fits into the architectural landscape of Navarra, where there is an impressive number of churches that display what may be called a «Romanesque» architectural vocabulary. Its beauty is more characterised by its subtlety and geometric proportion than by its decoration. The plan and elevation of Santo Sepulcro were designed in conformity with an established system of proportions, according to which the circumference of different-sized circles determined the scope of the apse. In addition, these proportions were related to the whole octagonal body of the church, the height of its stories,\n\n2 Although there is no documentation that attests to the construction of Santo Sepulcro, there is ample evidence supporting the assumption that the church was built between 1160 and 1180. The Knights of the Holy Sepulchre were active patrons of architecture in the region in the middle of the 12 th century. Therefore, it is likely that Santo Sepulcro was constructed at the height of their building activity in the region during the second half of the 12 th century. The first known document confirming the existence of Santo Sepulcro dates from 1215 and thus provides an indisputable ante quem. Stylistic similarities between the architectural sculptures at Torres del Río and San Prudencio de Armentia, San Miguel de Estella, and the apse of the monastery of Santa Mara de la Oliva, which all date back to the 1160s to the 1170s, suggest that Santo Sepulcro is a contemporaneous monument. For a more thorough discussion of the historical and art historical evidence supporting this dating, see Javier Martínez de Aguirre and Leopoldo Gil Cornet (2004). Torres del Río, iglesia del Santo Sepulcro. Pamplona: Gobierno de Navarra, pp. 98-100. Martínez de Aguirre and Gil Cornet postulate the 1170s as the decade when Santo Sepulcro was constructed.\n\nas well as to the correct positions and sizes of the windows. 3 The church follows a rigid and emphatic octagonal plan, but at the same time shows a distinct east-west axis delineated by the rounded apse on the east and a round stair tower on the west. Columns with carved capitals and rounded arches frame seven small windows punctuating the octagonal sides on the upper story. Two additional windows flank the apse. On top of the main structure an octagonal aedicule was mounted, whose original function remains a mystery.\n\nInside, an interlacing ribbed vault dominates this small, intimate church. Thick rectangular stone ribs spring from pairs of corbels set closely to each other in the middle of each octagonal side. Together they form an eight-pointed star with a central octagon. Squeezed into tiny spaces between the ribs, small windows illuminate the interior. They are clearly visible from the outside but appear dwarfed from the inside due to the dominance of the ribs. The apertures are filled with stone grilles and crowned with non-figurative, architectural sculptures consisting of two elements, a lobed arch and turrets. The dome is perhaps the most intriguing feature of Santo Sepulcro. The best-known example of vaults with interlacing ribs are found in the Great Mosque of Córdoba, and the identification of interlacing ribbed vaults with Islamic architecture is strong among art historians.\n\nImage 2. Santo Sepulcro vault.\n\nPhotography: Robin Haedong Kim.\n\n3 Ibídem, pp. 41-46.\n\nTherefore, most scholarship on Santo Sepulcro so far falls into two camps. The first camp describes the structure as «mudéjar», but offers little to no commentaries exceeding this stylistic assignation, which furthermore conflicts with standard histories of the region. 4 The other camp seeks to revoke the possibility of any Muslim legacy in Navarra by offering an iconographical reading rooted in Richard Krautheimer’s theory of iconography. According to this strand of interpretation, the dome is regarded as an architectural reference to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. 5 Yet both interpretations are those of modern scholars trained in categorising architecture either as Romanesque, Christian, Islamic or Mudéjar. In contrast, this paper is concerned with how people in the 12 th century might have perceived their architectural environment. This calls for a different type of contextualisation that exceeds the geographical parameters by which the church is localised today. In the end, this will result in the development of a method that should bring us closer to medieval conceptions of the region. 6\n\nThe «Comunidad foral de Navarra»\n\nStandard histories of Navarre emphasise the function of the medieval Kingdom of Navarra as a Christian stronghold, which is why they assume that its culture and society were completely unaffected by Islamic influences detectable in other areas of the Iberian Peninsula. In the field of art history, this translates to a general denial of any Mudéjar presence in Navarra. However, Santo Sepulcro is not the only monument suggesting that Navarrese visual culture of the 12 th century was much more complex than once believed. To begin with, there are three churches located between Estella and Puente la Reina with entrance portals crowned by poly-lobed arches in lieu of\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 Georgiana Goddard King and Serapio Huici thoroughly expand on Islamic influences on the dome of Santo Sepulcro. Yet their studies were published nearly a century ago; cp. Georgiana Goddard King (1918). «Three Unknown Churches in Spain», American journal of Archaeology, 22/2, p. 162; Georgiana Goddard King (1920). The Way of Saint James, vol. 1. New York and London: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, pp. 319-320; Serapio Huici (1923). «Iglesia de templarios de Torres del Río», Arquitectura, 5, pp. 253-259. More recently, Juan Plazaola and Juan Carlos Ruiz Souza have briefly mentioned Santo Sepulcro as an example of cross-culturality in Navarre. Neither author employs the prevailing interpretations in Navarrese scholarship in denial of Islamic influences. See Juan Plazaola (2002). «El arte románico en Euskal Herria», Revista internacional de los estudios vascos, 47, p. 127, and Juan Carlos Ruiz Souza (2006). «Architectural languages, functions, and spaces: the Crown of Castile and Al-Ándalus», Medieval encounters, 12/3, p. 373.

Imágenes y promotores en el arte medieval: miscelánea en homenaje a Joaquín Yarza Luaces. Barcelona: Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, pp. 153-165. Glaire Anderson has recently shown how such shifts in geographical perspective can change our understanding of single monuments and the development of Islamic architecture in general. See Glaire Anderson (2014). «Integrating the medieval Iberian Peninsula and north Africa in Islamic architectural history», The journal of north African studies, 19, pp. 83-92.\n\ntympana. These churches are San Román in Cirauqui, San Pedro de la Rúa in Estella, and Santiago in Puente la Reina. Bereft of figural imagery, they employ geometrical and vegetal patterns on tiered round arches. Instead of receding from the plane of the façade to the entryway, all tiers appear as if located on the same vertical plane. The effect of the repeated geometrical patterns is a reduction of the portal’s depth, due to which it appears as if two-dimensional. The effect is similar to artistic forms of the Islamic regions on the Iberian Peninsula and, as we will see, the geographic sphere of influence to which Santo Sepulcro used to belong.\n\nArt historical analysis conducted in Navarre provides explanations for these challenges to the prevailing narrative of the regional art history. In the case of Santo Sepulcro, iconographic methods are applied to compare the church with formal aspects of monuments in Jerusalem instead of with buildings on the Iberian Peninsula, especially from its former Islamic areas. Accordingly, these art historians, for example, describe the poly-lobed arches near Estella usually as imports from France. Moreover, they date the mentioned churches to the second half of the 13 th century so that they comply with a chronology according to which poly-lobed arches were first adopted in France and then re-imported to the Iberian Peninsula. 7\n\nSome historians need such explanations to guarantee that the monuments still coincide with modern concepts of medieval Navarre, which claim that the Christian/Muslim duality defined social and cultural interactions, or rather, as in this case, the lack thereof. Conventional research on the history of Navarre thus maintains Francisco Abbad Ríos’s assertion that –after numerous changes in dominion– Pamplona had already been under permanent Christian control since the 10 th century, and therefore did not have any Mudéjar tradition. 8 The architectural landscape of Navarre today does indeed show more examples of buildings whose styles rather relate to forms classified as Christian or Romanesque than to those labelled Mudéjar or Islamic. It thus seems to indeed support conventional narratives. However, it is worth pausing here for a moment in order to reflect on Juan Carlos Ruiz Souza’s observation that the «modern period has witnessed something of an aesthetic reversal, in which the familiar has been rendered the “other” and the foreign the “familiar”», and how this might relate to architecture in Navarre. 9\n\nThere was an unprecedented building boom in the Kingdom of Navarra from the late 12 th to the 13 th century. More and more pilgrims bound for Santiago de Compostela traversed the northern parts of the Iberian Peninsula. As a result, many new cities were founded\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 Asunción de Orbe Sivatte and Javier Martínez de Aguirre (1987). «Consideraciones acerca de las portadas lobuladas medievales en Navarra: Santiago de Puente la Reina, San Pedro de la Rúa de Estella y San Román de Cirauqui», Príncipe de Viana, 48, p. 45.

Cit., p. 364.\n\nalongside the route with the intent to take advantage of the economic opportunities that came with the influx of pilgrims requiring supplies, lodgings, and food. The area around Estella (approximately 26,6 kilometres northwest of Torres del Río) was a zone with an especially high building activity. In his study of lesser-known monuments in the rural areas surrounding Estella, Carlos J. Martínez Álava informs us that during the last years of the 12 th century and almost through the entire 13 th century there was more construction work going on in Estella and its environs than in any other part of the Kingdom of Navarra. 10 The pilgrimage to Santiago remains popular until this very day, with the influx of tourists still ensuring the preservation of the old towns and churches along the route.\n\nHowever, at the time when Santo Sepulcro was built, that is, during the 1160s and 1180s, many regional buildings that today show a Romanesque vocabulary had in fact not been completed nor even begun. Moreover, Martínez Álava points out that many of these churches show simple designs and continued the employment of Romanesque architectural features way into the 13 th and even parts of the 14 th century. This was the result of pragmatic considerations and the liturgical needs of the small communities and their limited resources. If one furthermore takes into account that many buildings and artefacts with features today considered Islamic or Islamicate were destroyed in the 16 th century, 11 it may not be too far-fetched to say that the architectural landscape of Navarre appears more Romanesque now than it did when Santo Sepulcro was built.\n\nThe Ebro rive r Valley\n\nAs already said, here I want to propose an alternative contextualisation of the geographical region where Santo Sepulcro is located today, which is apart of the Ebro Valley extending from Zaragoza to Logroño. That the Greeks named the entire Iberian Peninsula after the great River Ebro is a testament to the river’s significance: Iberia comes from Ibēria, a name derived from the river Ibēros. The Ebro Valley expands vastly across the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula and incorporates land that today belongs to seven of Spain’s altogether seventeen autonomous communities. Apart from that, the histories of the different regions of the Ebro Valley have much in common due to the countless social and cultural interactions that took place alongside the river. The Ebro and its many tributaries have been routes of exchange since the Iron Age. 12 It has always been a multicultural area with agriculture and trade facilitated by the river, and nothing in the literature suggests that\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Carlos J.

However, studies on medieval architecture in Navarre tend to limit their geographical parameters to the present-day Comunidad foral de Navarra and to exclude the area around Tudela, which was under Muslim control until 1119.\n\nImage 3.

Pérez and Scribble Maps, https://www.scribblemaps.com [consulted August 1, 2015].\n\nLa Rioja, Tudela and other areas along the Ebro Valley form a geographical and cultural context especially important for the church in Torres del Río. The Knights of the Holy Sepulchre first established themselves on the Iberian Peninsula in Calatayud, Aragón, between 1146 and 1156. Alfonso VII, king of Castile and León between 1126 and 1157, is credited for having brought the order to northern Spain. They travelled along the Ebro Valley to Logroño, where Alfonso donated the church of Santa María de Palacio to the knights, which became their first chapter in Castile. 13 Branching out from the two main\n\n13 le.

Today nothing remains of the first church built by the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\ncentres in Calatayud and Logroño, other dependent subchapters were soon established, including one in Torres del Río. The workers who constructed Santo Sepulcro probably lived in the communities alongside the Ebro Valley and were therefore familiar with the order. 14 A map indicating the locations of «morerías» alongside the Ebro Valley makes it plausible that Islamicate buildings may once have existed in the region between the two main headquarters. The neighbourhoods of these «morerías» certainly had own mosques with architectural elements of a vocabulary once shared among the various regions of the Ebro Valley. 15 It therefore is worthwhile to take a closer look at architectural examples from La Rioja, Tudela and Aragón that help better understand the architectural landscape during the times of the medieval Kingdom of Navarra. After discussing these examples, I will return to the area around Torres del Río and Santo Sepulcro.\n\nLa Rioja\n\nLa Rioja had once been a very important part of the Kingdom of Navarra. King Sancho el Sabio (king of Navarre from 1150 until 1194) had regain edit from Castile in the 1160s. Torres del Río was part of this recaptured territory, which had belonged to Castile since 1076. 16 Although Nájera today is a small town in La Rioja with a population of approximately 8400 people, it once used to be the de facto capital of the Kingdom of Pamplona. It presumably played this role from the time when AbdarRahman III (r. 912-961) attacked Pamplona in 924 to when Castile gained control over the area after its victory in the Battle of Atapuerca (1054). 17 Unfortunately, nothing has survived of the 10 th century castle or the expansions that transformed Nájera from a semi-rural royal residence to an important economic, cultural and political hub of the 11 th century. As Nájera used to belong to the Kingdom of Navarra, the churches of this region therefore should be discussed as a part of Navarrese architectural history.\n\nThe church of Santa María de los Arcos in Tricio (La Rioja), for example, is located approximately 46 kilometres southwest of Torres del Río. Probably constructed during the middle of the 10 th century, one of its most striking features is the reuse of giant\n\n14 15\n\n16\n\n17 Georgiana Goddard King (1918). «Three Unknown Churches in Spain».

Unfortunately, there have not been any archaeological attempts so far for excavating Sancho el Mayor’s and his son García Sánchez III’s (called «de Nájera») city. Nonetheless, Javier García Turza reconstructed the medieval city through a careful analysis of historic documents and in this way was able to prove that it had been a thriving regional metropolis.\n\ncolumn drums\n\n(spolia) for its interior that allegedly date back to the Roman era. 18 Whereas most columns do not have any capitals, the shafts in greatest proximity to the apse do. The number of drums per column becomes increasingly smaller towards the west end until the columns eventually only consist of the middle parts of longer shafts. This highlights how much the builders had wanted to accentuate the eastern part of the church. However, even the shafts of columns with capitals are incomplete, for all capitals lack impost blocks.\n\nThe various states of completion and the incongruities between the capitals indicate that they had not originally been crafted for the church. Instead, their use was a solution to the practical problem that the construction of a church consumed many resources. Since they are large and support the weight of the structure, the column drums were considered valuable. 19 Hence, the motives for their use were mostly of a practical nature. They prove the existence of a cultural atmosphere where old and new elements could coexist side by side. Due to the many modifications of the 13 th and 18 th century, it is difficult to imagine today what the church might have looked like in earlier centuries. Archaeologists have discovered fragments of a mosaic with Islamicate geometric patterns in the location of today’s apse, which suggests that during the 10 th century parts of the decoration of Santa María de los Arcos must have contained a mix of Roman, Ibero-Christian, and Islamicate designs. 20\n\nTudela\n\nAlthough Tudela had been incorporated into the Kingdom of Pamplona as early as 1119, it enters the narrative of architectural history in medieval Navarra not before the end of the same century, in connection with the construction of the cathedral of Santa María. 21 What is most striking here, however, is that this period is left out in art historical debates, even though Tudela had already belonged to Navarre nearly eighty years before the construction of the cathedral began. Correspondingly, rarely any mention is made of\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20 21 The church of Santa María de los Arcos has been dated back to as early as the 8 th century. However, it seems more likely that the church was built after the Christians had captured Nájera and Viguera in 923; see Sebastián Andrés Valero (1983). «Excavaciones en Santa María de los Arcos, Tricio (La Rioja)», Cuadernos de investigación: historia, 9, pp. 113-126; María de los Ángeles Agudo et al. (2003). «Santa María de los Arcos de Tricio (La Rioja), Santa Coloma (La Rioja) y la Asunción de San Vicente del Valle (Burgos): tres miembros de una familia arquitectónica», Arqueología de la Arquitectura, 2, pp. 81-86. Scholars have been confused by the reuse of Roman elements in the church ever since. During the Roman Empire Tricio was a manufacturing centre for pottery.

Its power was even augmented during the reign of Mundir I, i.e., presumably between 1018 and 1021. At that time, Tudela was one of the most important cities of the Upper March. By modifying the mosque, Mundir I wanted to demonstrate his independency from Córdoba. It therefore served as a propagandistic tool for reinforcing and confirming the legitimacy of his rule. 23 Moreover, Tudela’s population was growing at the time, and it is likely that extending the space had become necessary for accommodating more people.\n\nIn its final phase, the Great Mosque of Tudela was 71 metres long and 32 metres wide. These proportions are similar to those after the amplification of the Great Mosque of Córdoba during the reign of al-Hakam II (r. 961-976). 24 Excavations on location of the Great Mosque of Zaragoza, commissioned by Mundir I around 1020, revealed that the very same proportions had been used for its amplification as well. 25 Yet this is not that surprising given that the mosques of Tudela and Zaragoza were intended as copies of the Great Mosque of Córdoba. It is very likely that the designs and dimensions of both mosques stood somewhere between the opulent brilliance of Córdoba and the small private mosque of Bab al-Mardum in Toledo, known as Cristo de la Luz today. Jerrilyn Dodds has argued that the mosque of Bab al-Mardum, built in 999, demonstrates that Andalucía had already developed its own version of Islamic art by the 10 th century. This style is characterised by a combination of a nostalgia for the Ummayyad capital of Damascus and an adaptation of local building traditions often referred to as «visigothic». 26 According to Dodds, this particularly «Andalusian» style became both a model for buildings in other parts of Islamic Iberia and a visual manifestation of the multicultural blend of the Christians, Muslims and Jews coexisting on the Peninsula.\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24 25 26 Manuel Gómez-Moreno (1945). «La Mezquita mayor de Tudela», Príncipe de Viana, 6, pp. 9-27; Basilio Pavón Maldonado (1978). «Tudela: ciudad medieval.

Built during the last half of the 11 th century by the Banu Hūd, who ruled the taifa of Zaragoza from 1039-1110, this private palace is a key building for contextualising Santo Sepulcro in Torres del Río. The architectures of buildings outside Córdoba during the taifa period were often very magnificent and refined. The rulers of the taifa kingdoms were fervent to express their independence and power. Furthermore, their resources were no longer funnelled through a far away caliphal capital. The mosque of the Aljafería provides a useful comparison to the church in Torres del Río. It consists of a small two-storied, octagonal chamber crowned with an impressive interlacing ribbed vault. Although the current condition of the vault is the result of 20 th -century restorations, it is as good as certain that the 11 th -century original had already consisted of an interlacing ribbed construction. 27\n\nWhat I am not trying to suggest here is that the mosque of the Aljafería was an immediate model for Santo Sepulcro in Torres del Río. However, as a surviving example of Islamic architecture in the Ebro Valley, it allows us to surmise what Islamic architecture in areas with a previously Muslim population, such as Tudela or Calahorra, might have looked like. At the time when Santo Sepulcro was built, the Great Mosque of Tudela was perhaps the most magnificent building for Christian worship in the Kingdom of Pamplona. Julie Harris’s research on mosque-to-church conversions in the Iberian Peninsula does not only demonstrate that mosques were later on reused by Christians, but that they often left them mostly unmodified until repairs were needed. 28 Hence, it is likely that interlacing ribbed vaults, as employed in Córdoba and Toledo, were commonly used. Moreover, it is indeed possible that masons built an interlacing ribbed vault for the new mosque in the «morería» of Tudela after Christians had taken over the Great Mosque in 1121.\n\nThe mediev al Kingdom of Navarre\n\nExtending the geographical parameters for contextualising Navarrese monuments classified as anomalies by modern scholars has shown that the interlacing ribbed vault of Santo Sepulcro and the poly-lobed arches found between Estella and Puente la Reina may not have been that unusual with regard to medieval standards. Throughout the Aljafería in Zaragoza, poly-lobed arches were used for delineating entrances. 29 The Northern salon, or Salón de Oro, of the palace contains arches carved in «impossible» configurations:\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29 Bernabé Cabañero Subiza, Carmelo Lasa Gracia and José Luis Mateo Lázaro (2006). «La Aljafería de Zaragoza como imitación y culminación de la mezquita aljama de Córdoba», Artigrama, 21, pp. 243-290. Julie Harris (1997). «Mosque to church conversions in the Spanish Reconquest», Medieval encounters, 3, pp. 158-172. See Cynthia Robinson (2002).

Leiden: Brill, pp. 31-36 and 197-198 for discussions of the arcades.\n\nalthough they in fact overlap and intersect, they appear as if the arches were situated on the same plane. The spaces between the arches are filled with foliate designs, which are furthermore flattened so that they seem two-dimensional, an effect very similar to the one observed in the entrance portals of San Román and San Pedro de la Rúa.\n\nGiven the presence of Muslim communities and of Islamic architecture in this northern region, there certainly will have been poly-lobed arches in 12 th -century Tudela and may be even further north the Ebro Valley. In contrast, Navarrese art historians usually claim that the development of poly-lobed arches in Islamic architecture was completely independent and detached from their later use in Romanesque churches («todo ello alejado de su utilización posterior en Iglesias románicas»). 30 Instead, the alternative narrative proposed here is that they may be representatives of a regional aesthetics that once extended from the Muslim palace in Zaragoza to the curved adornments above the windows of Santo Sepulcro. As for this particular church, the poly-lobed arches seem to have evolved in a way that exceeded their Islamic models, since their shapes resemble trefoil and quatrefoil patterns common in Romanesque and Gothic architecture. A similar metamorphosis seems to have happened with respect to the dome, where interlacing ribs, which are typical for Islamic buildings, are combined with grilles and turrets similar to forms found in western medieval art and architecture.\n\nEvevn though Santo Sepulcro’s location on the path to Santiago de Compostela ensured that many visitors would come from regions not influenced by Islamic visual culture, this does not mean that the church appeared unusual in relation to the contemporary architectural landscape. As stated further above, it is very likely that the Ebro Valley once contained more remnants of its Islamic past so that features such as interlacing ribbed vaults or poly-lobed arches used to be essential for the regional architectural vocabulary. Therefore, Santo Sepulcro in Torres del Río is a good reminder that today’s political borders do not account for reliable criteria for assessing medieval monuments. On the contrary, today’s geographical perceptions and conceptions can in fact impede our capability of interpreting medieval monuments in correspondence with their historic standards.\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTOR Robin Haeodong Kim works on medieval art, architecture and civilisation, primarily focusing on the visual culture of the Iberian Peninsula in the Middle Ages and its relationship to the rest of the Mediterranean.

Its location in Navarra, a Spanish region generally considered shielded from Islamic influence, divides scholarship on the church into two different interpretive camps. Accordingly, it is either labelled Mudéjar, or Islamic influences are denied altogether. The latter interpretation is the result of iconographical readings according to which Santo Sepulcro was intended as an imitation of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. In contrast, I want to propose a shift of the geographical parameters usually used for contextualizing the church that can offer a new direction for understanding its medieval reception. Thus, the Santo Sepulcro can be understood as a representation of a local aesthetic that integrates elements modern art historians would usually categorise as either «Christian» or «Islamic»."
