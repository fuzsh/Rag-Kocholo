[1][2]\n\nThe name Fortunius, currently his \"LNAB\" has not been identified.\n\nAs the sources are limited, we know little about this count.[3]\n\n685 Birth Year Estimation\n\nSince he converted to Islam in 714, assume he was already ruling and aged 30 or so at the time, therefore born, say, 685.\n\nChristian Count in Ebro Valley\n\nA Christian Count named Casio who lived in the center of the Ebro valley was the origin of the Banu Qasi. [3]\n\nIbn Hazm stated that Casio was \"Count of the Goths\" [3]\n\n714 Umayyad Conquest and Conversion to Islam\n\nAccording to the tenth century Gothic Muwallad historian Ibn al-Qūṭiyya, Count Cassius converted to Islam in 714, shortly after the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, as a client (mawali) of the Umayyads; his family came to be called the Banu Qasi (بنو قَسِىّ, the \"sons [or descendants] of Cassius\").\n\nCassius had converted at the hands of the Arab, Hassan ibn Yassar al-Hudhali, qadi in Zaragoza at the time of Abd ar-Rahman's arrival in the peninsula, as a means to preserve his lands and political power.\n\nCassius joined forces with Musa ibn Nusayr and Tariq ibn Ziyad, and is reported to have travelled to Damascus to personally swear allegiance to the Caliph Al-Walid I.[4]\n\nCasio helped Musa and Tariq, who headed the Muslim forces of the Emir, between the end of 713 - and early 714. He then traveled to Damascus to adopt the Muslim religion.[3]\n\nReign\n\nAt the time of the Muslim arrival and after, Cassius ruled an area comprising Tudela, Tarazona, Borja, and, probably, Ejea. [4]\n\nThe Banu Qasi domain and its rival, the Kingdom of Pamplona, in the 10th century, after they were deprived of most of the Upper March. The Banu Qasi, Banu Kasi, Beni Casi (Arabic: بني قسي or بنو قسي‎, meaning \"sons\" or \"heirs of Cassius\") or Banu Musa were a Muwallad dynasty that ruled the upper Ebro valley in the 9th century. [2]\n\nThey were loyal to commercial relations with Abd al-Rahman Ia Omei and Hisham I (788-796) with their son, who did not join the rebels in Zaragoza. [3]\n\n705 Marriage and Issue\n\nIf Cassius was born in 685 and married at the age of 20, he would have had a wife by 705 and children born in the following year. Any who were born before 714 would have had \"Christian\" names. Those who were born afterwards would probably have had names with Arabic patronymics, ibn for boys and bint for girls.\n\nHis oldest child appears to have a Christian name. Children 2 and 3 are known not with their own name, but as fathers of their sons. Children 4 and 5 appear to have Arabic language versions of Jonah and John. [5]\n\nOne could conjecture a younger man whose children were primarily born after his conversion. The logic of making him an older man is that with a wife and children and lands, he had more at stake which made his conversion personally desirable.\n\nOn the other hand, once he converted, he could have taken on a subsequent or additional Muslim wife. Any wife that he married after 714 would be expected to have a Muslim name.\n\nA genealogy made up of the historian Ibn Hazm is the only trace of them. According to this, we know that Fortun, Abu Tawr, Abu Salama, Yunus and Yahya were among the sons of Qasi family. It is striking that among so many Muslim names, one-probably the son's son-is a Christian name.[3]\n\nThe eleventh century Arab historian Ibn Hazm attributed five sons to Cassius:\n\nFortun. Cañada Juste says that the Banu Qasi dynasty descended from Fortun, the eldest son[6]\n\nAbu Tawr, Cañada Juste indicates that the second son may have been the Abu Taur of Huesca who invited Charlemagne to Zaragoza in 778 [6] Note: \"Abu Tawr\" means \"Father of Tawr\"\n\nAbu Salama, Cañada Juste suggests that the Banu Salama, a family that ruled Huesca and Barbitanya (Barbastro) in the late tenth century, may have descended from Abu Salama[6] Note: \"Abu Salama\" means \"father of Salama\"\n\nYunus, (Jonah)\n\nYahya. (John)\n\nDescendants\n\nThe Banu Qasi became an important Muslim family located in the Ebro Valley, between the eighth tenth centuries. [3]\n\nThe heirs of Casio had a prominent role in the Ebro Valley in the middle of the nineth century. [3]\n\nIn the eight or ten generations of this lineage, the name Muza repeated so much, no doubt, in honor of the Arab leader, the Count of Casio. Similarly, other family members, such as Fortun and Lope, say that they were also twinned with the lineage that prevailed in the region of Pamplona.[3]\n\n714-839 First Period in Family's History\n\nThree periods can be distinguished in this family's history. The first one last until 839. [3]\n\nIn June 788, Musa Ibn Fortun defeated Said ibn al-Husayn, the rebel Yahya Ansari from Zaragoza, who rebelled against Hisman I and took possession of the city. In this way, he became prominent at the Córdoba court. [3]\n\nThe Banu Qasitar signed a treaty with the Eneko family. According to this agreement, Mutarrif ibn Musa Ibn Fortun was governor of Pamplona (798-799) and Tudela took a short time (803), among others. While fighting with the elders of the family of the Eneko family, Banu Qasitarra was confronted with the governor of the border Amrus ibn Yusuf.[3]\n\nThis alliance was strengthened with fraternal relations. It seems that Oneka, the mother of Eneko Aritz, married Musa ibn Fortun. Their son Musa ibn Musa later became the most important leader of the family. [3]\n\n839-907 Second Period in Family's History\n\nThe second era begins in 839, with Musa ibn Musa, the most important leader of the lineage, and ends in 907 when Lubb Ibn Muhammad's son died. [3]\n\nAccording to Musa ibn Musa's first news (839), the al-Andalus Upper Mugan government had a significant change, and Banu Qasitares never achieved a leading role in the region, which lasted until the first decade of the 10th century.[3]\n\nThe close alliance between Aritza and Banu Qasi protected the Muslims from Muslim attacks. On the contrary, as a result of this relationship, they depended on the political ups and downs of the Arab family, and from 840 onwards, it will begin to be felt. In fact, at that time, Musa ibn Musa began to move away from the emirate, as they were the ones who had been called by the governors of Zaragoza and Tudela.[3]\n\nIn 841, they also moved to Musa Borja, they had to take Tudela and return to Arnedo. Garzia Iñigez, brother-in-law , son of Eneko Aritzaren, asked for help from Harit Zaragoza's wali , and they prepared an embassy to harit Harit. Abd al-Rahman II attacked Pamplona in 842 to punish the defeat and punish Irun for his help. Probably, they agreed to the Musa's mother -in-law, for the wali of Arnedo . Musa released Harit. Likewise, they agreed to Eneko Aritza's mother .[3]\n\nThe following year, Musa broke the treaty and, as a result, Abd al-Rahman II attacked them with violence. He defeated them and Musa and Eneko Aritza were wounded by the attack. In 844, there was a third attack against Musa and its allied rivals. In Tudela, Musa ibn Musa was defeated and from there they went to Pamplona.[3]\n\nAfter the death of Eneko Aritza (851), the elders tightened their relations with the kingdom of Asturias, and in some cases they protected their policies, partly because of the family Banu Qasi. Meanwhile, Musa Title wali was named, and Zaragoza, as well as the governor of the whole brand. Thus, he increased the loyalty to the Emir. In 854, the Asturian king Ordoño sent troops to help the rebellious Toledo. Musa helped the Emir, and \"the king of Vascones\", while the Spaniards. In order to punish this aid, the Emir sent an army under the guidance of the Musa and sacked the lands of Alava.[3]\n\nIn the year 86, Musa ibn Musa was killed in a fight against suicide. With him, one of the most significant characters of the time disappeared. According to the report of Alfonso III, \"The Third King of Hispania\" was known by its successes. When he died, Fortun's son promised a lot of obedience to the Emir. He did not have his father's role, however, and he was not as important as his political and military role.[3]\n\nIn 872, Musa ibn Musa's sons raised new uprisings in the Ebro Valley. In eight days, Musa's sons (Fortun, Lubb, Mutarrif and Ismail) took Tudela, Zaragoza, Huesca and Monzon. Although they were an amazing event, they had little time to defend these cities. By the year 875, all the sons of Musa were deceased, except Ismail, who was captive. All the cities were once again in the hands of the Emir, and immediately established their governors. King Gartzia Iñigez and other Basque families supported the uprisings of Banu Qasitar. This caused the anger of the Emir, and again attacked Pamplona and Araba.[3]\n\nAt the end of the century, there were major changes in the region. Fortun Gartzes was king of Pamplona, ​​the al-Andalus internal strife began, and around 880, he became the head of the Banu Qasi family, Muhammad ibn Lubb.[3]\n\nUntil 880, Ismail, who was the last of the Musa's sons, began to take refuge in the surrounding major cities, and Muhammad was raised against the emir, making Zaragoza. In order to fight it, the Emir sent an army under Muhammad ibn Lubb. He was the niece of the Revolver, and when his father Lubb ibn Musa died, he was abandoned. In a fight in Kalagorri (882), Ismail's uncle and cousins-Fortun's sons-were taken prisoner. In this way, he became the absolute leader of the lineage and acquired all the family heritage (Zaragoza, Tudela, Arnedo, Valtierra and San Esteban castle), increasing his territory. In return for the aid he received from the Emirates, the muladian, unwillingly, gave Zaragoza.[3]\n\nWhen Muhammad ibn Lubb took up the lineage of the lineage, the family was fully consolidated and had a great heritage, which was very important, bearing in mind that there were great conflicts in Cordoba. Because the emir of Upper Mugan had no power set, local powers struggled together, in a strong competition for most of the lands. When attacked, the family Banu Qasi did not take into account the religious beliefs of the enemies, and therefore, Muslims and Christians-especially their leaders-.[3]\n\nHe built a large number of Muhammad strongholds and struggled with the kingdom of Pamplona, ​​causing great damage to his dependents and Arabs. He was a tribe, and the Emir was appointed governor of Arnedo and Tarazona. It was built in Monzone and Lleida, it rebuilt the castles of Naiara and Vigueras and was built by Faltzes and Caparroso. He was probably betrayed by fame and power (898), and sent himself to Cordova.[3]\n\nHowever, the death of Muhammad ibn Lubb did not bring peace to the Basque provinces. In fact, Lubb ibn Muhammad, his son and heir, kept clashes when he became the head of the lineage. Lubb showed that he was a well-deserved successor, because his father followed his path completely. He defeated the Iruñea and the Asturian army by Borjan (900). Toledo asked for help and offered the city authority. Lubb sent Mutarrif, and was appointed as the lord of Toledo (903). Shortly afterwards he conquered an Arab castle, namely Baiá (903).[3]\n\n907-924 Third and Last Period in Family's History\n\nThe third era was between 907 and 924, with the political and military disappearance of the Banu Qasi family.[3]\n\nMeanwhile, a change of dynasties occurred in Pamplona (905): the family Ximena took over the inheritance of the Eneko family. In 907, Lubb established defensive places to be included in the mark of Sancho Garcés I of the new royal king of Pamplona. On the contrary, he made several embassies, and one of them died, along with many followers. When Lubb died, the tribe began to decline, since they had lost their territories since then. The leadership of the lineage did not take children, but Abd Allah's brothers. However, they lost some part of the territory, against Sancho Garcia I. In 915, Antso captured Abd Allah, governor of Tudela. He relinquished Falces and Caparroso. This conquest dynamics, however, reached Abd el-Rahman III in 920.[3]\n\nIn view of the success of this campaign, Muhammad ibn Abd Allah - who ruled in Tudela, Naiaran and Vigueran - organized an attack; But the king of Pamplona opposed him and conquered Viguera (922). Iruinseme took Muhammad captive, and he soon passed away. Due to the continuous failures of two decades, the tribe was completely weakened, and losing almost all land, Abd el-Rahman III lost interest in the field. Thus, in 924, the family moved to Córdoba, where they remained forgotten.[3]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nContested Existence\n\nHis actual existence has been contested on the grounds that embellishing stories related to Gothic ancestry were rather popular during the Caliphate of Cordova. The name is anachronistic, and no Banu Qasi is attested until Mutarrif ibn-Musa during the 780s, but he is identified with just his father's name and not explicitly linked to Cassius or the Banu Qasi.[7]\n\nHistorians point out that the origins of the Banu Qasi, as recounted by Ibn al-Qutiyya, could be a product of the spurious antiquarianism of the later Umayyad period rather than reliable genealogy, satisfying the need for stories which bridged the conquest.[8]\n\nDubious Wife\n\nHe has been shown with a wife named Abd Al Aziz ibn Muza Muza (abt. 0685 - 0717) This is a man's name, and therefore this person has been de-linked.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Roger Collins, The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710-797, (Blackwell Publishing, 1994), 191, 204.
