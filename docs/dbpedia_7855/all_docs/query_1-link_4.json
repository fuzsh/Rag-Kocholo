        "text": "Body Odor / ABCC11\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere are two kinds of sweat glands: eccrine sweat glands, which are found throughout the skin, and apocrine sweat glands, which are found in the armpits and groin. Eccrine sweat glands produce sweat that is mostly water and salt, and it does not contribute very much to body odor. Apocrine sweat contains proteins and lipids; when bacteria on the skin metabolize apocrine sweat, they produce body odor. The earwax glands (ceruminous glands) are a form of apocrine gland. (…) Some people have earwax that is wet, sticky and yellow or brown; other people’s earwax is dry, crumbly and grayish. Variation at a single gene determines which kind of earwax you have; the allele for wet earwax is dominant over the allele for dry earwax. The allele for dry earwax appears to have originated by mutation in northeastern Asia about 2,000 generations ago, then spread outwards because it was favored by natural selection. It is very common in eastern Asia, becomes much less common towards Europe, and is rare in Africa. Earwax type is not used very often to illustrate basic genetics, but unlike most human characters that are used (tongue rolling, attached earlobes, etc.), it really is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. .

(2010) performed chemical analysis of axillary sweat samples from 25 individuals with different ABCC11 538G-A genotypes, including 18 Asian participants (11 AA homozygotes, 5 AG heterozygotes, and 2 GG homozygotes) and 7 Caucasian participants (2 AG heterozygotes and 5 GG homozygotes). Levels of 3 glutamine conjugates that are precursors for key body odorants were below detection limits in all participants with the AA genotype but were present in all AG and GG individuals, indicating that ABCC11 is essential for secretion of amino-acid conjugates of relevant axillary odors.\n\n~\n\nMapping of Apocrine Gland Secretion\n\nBy a functional assay, Yoshiura et al. (2006) determined that cells with allele A showed a lower excretory activity for cGMP than those with allele G. The allele A frequency showed a north-south and east-west downward geographic gradient; worldwide, it was highest in Chinese and Koreans, and a common dry-type haplotype was retained among various ethnic populations. These results suggested that the allele A arose in northeast Asia and thereafter spread through the world. The 538G-A SNP was the first example of DNA polymorphism determining a visible genetic trait.(…)\n\nRead the full text online here or download pdf there.\n\n(both retrieved 21.02.2015 at http://www.omim.org/entry/117800)\n\n~\n\nWorld Overview ABCC11\n\nRead the document online here or download full pdf there.\n\n(retrieved 20.01.2013 at http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=das%20ohrenschmalz%20als%20rassenmerkmal%20und%20der%20rassengeruch&source=web&cd=11&ved=0CDAQFjAAOAo&url=http%3A%2F%2Fge.tt%2Fapi%2F1%2Ffiles%2F50GjGkI%2F0%2Fblob%3Fdownload&ei=FK77ULKmLo_otQaVvoCgBg&usg=AFQjCNEG–tL)\n\n~\n\nAdditional Material\n\nHuman Olfactory Communication\n\nAbstact:\n\nNonhuman animals communicate their emotional states through changes in body odor.

Chinese language is ruled by man.”\n\n~\n\nThe Basics about Chinese Language\n\nFormation of Chinese characters\n\nThe origin of the Chinese antique script is very long and there are not enough documentary resources about its history. Chinese characters can be traced to a time when people made records in their daily life by tying knots in ropes or strings. The most accepted legend is that the inventor of Chinese writing was a minister named Ts’ang Chieh, who recorded the history in the court of Emperor Huang Ti, the first king of China.\n\nPeople in different regions of China speak differently, including such dialects as Mandarin, Min Nan, Hakka, Cantonese, etc. But while certain characters may be pronounced differently depending on the dialect, the meaning and the written Chinese language is the same for everyone. Mandarin is the official spoken language of the People’s Republic of China.\n\nThere are three elements in a Chinese character: image (form), sound, and meaning. There are also six principles that used to define and explicate the characters:\n\n1. Pictograms (象形)\n\nPictograms are words formed from things which can be drawn (such as animals, a person, or objects.)\n\n2. Simple Indicatives (指事)\n\nSimple indicatives are words formed from things that cannot be drawn (such as directions or numbers.)\n\n3. Compound Indicatives (會意)\n\nCompound indicatives are words formed to be understood easily after the pictograph and indicatives are formed.\n\n4. Phono-semantic Compound Characters (形聲)\n\nA phono-semantic compound character represents a word that is formed from another word to which it is similar, with additional signs or characters added to make the new character. The word is pronounced like one of the original words.\n\n5. Borrowed Characters (假借)\n\nA borrowed character was originally borrowed from another word that was pronounced the same (a homophone).\n\nFor example, the character 來 lái depicts the wheat plant and meant wheat in ancient times — it was a pictogram. Because the words for wheat and to come were pronounced the same, the character 來 was then borrowed to write the verb to come. The pronunciation of the original word meaning wheat has changed in modern times to mài (now written 麥), and the original homophony between the two words has disappeared.\n\n6. Derived characters (轉注)\n\nDerived characters represent words that share the same root word or meaning.\n\nFor example, the characters 老 lǎo (old) and 考 kǎo (a test) are the most commonly cited examples of derived characters, which come from a common etymological root but differ in that one part is changed to indicate a different pronunciation and meaning.\n\n6. Derived Characters (轉注)\n\nDerived characters represent words that share the same root word or meaning.\n\nFor example, the characters 老 lǎo (old) and 考 kǎo (a test) are the most commonly cited examples of derived characters, which come from a common etymological root but differ in that one part is changed to indicate a different pronunciation and meaning.\n\n(retreived 07.10.2016 at http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/mandarin1/4535)\n\nRead more online here or download pdf here.\n\n~\n\nRadicals\n\nEvery Chinese character has a radical or is itself a radical. There are 214 radicals today.\n\nFor example, 女 is the character for woman. It is also the radical for many female things: 姐姐 = little sister, 妈妈 = mamma, etc.\n\nRadicals are used to tell something about the meaning of the character, such as is made of metal, is tall, etc.\n\nRadicals are also used to look up characters in a dictionary. To find a character you look for the radical in a radical list. When you have found your radical you count the remaining number of strokes in the character. With this information it is now possible to find the character.\n\n(retreived 07.10.2016 at http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/mandarin1/4537)\n\nRead more online here or download pdf here.\n\n~\n\nStrokes and stroke order\n\nAll Chinese characters build up from basic strokes. The simplest ones have only one stroke while the more complex ones can have more than 20–30 strokes. The strokes are to be written in the right order and in the right way. It is important to follow these rules.\n\n(retreived 07.10.2016 at http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/mandarin1/4538)\n\n~\n\nThe strokes are to be written in a certain order. There are very few rules but it is important to spend time learning them since they make it easier to remember the character. Your characters will also look better if you write them correctly. In China calligraphy is a highly regarded art form.\n\nNote that there are additional rules when rules conflict. For example, rules may conflict when one stroke is to the bottom and left of another. Also, the last rule may conflict with other rules, however the overriding rule is top to bottom.\n\n(retreived 07.10.2016 at http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/mandarin1/4539)\n\n~\n\nMaterial above copied from an online learning textbook http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/mandarin1/cover produced by the UNC School of Education http://www.learnnc.org.\n\n~\n\nMost Common Chinese Words\n\n1.的\n\n[de] grammatical particle marking genitive as well as simple and composed adjectives; 我的 wǒde: my; 高的 gāode: high, tall; 是的 shìde: that’s it, that’s right; 是…的 shì…de: one who…; 他是说汉语的.

So I decided to learn Chinese language… My first words were 八 (bā – eight) and 〇 (líng). We were unloading a container and had to sort the boxes according to the numbers written on. My boxes were number 8 and 0. It took me about a year to understand, that those “misunderstandings” were not about the language – it was all about the culture.\n\nBut the more I learned from Asian cultures, the more I was aware that the language is a key to a culture. So I got a self-learning book and began to learn Chinese language. Soon I found out, that intonation plays a key role in the meaning of words. I went out and bought another book, this time with a CD inside.\n\nFirst encounter with learning Chinese language (self-learning)\n\nIn the mornings, when I was sitting in the bus to my working place, I listened to the recording and improved my intonation (I am a Laofutze, my dad is a Laofutze and we do not care for appearing stupid in public – except for the only aesthete of the family). And after a full working day with great Chinese business partners I simply was too tired of anything Chinese.After about six months my efforts in learning Chinese language faded out.\n\nSecond encounter with learning Chinese language (language-tandem)\n\nSince we have a certain amount of Chinese citizens in the town I live in, it was easy to find a Chinese person, who would like to exchange language skills. After several attempts I gave up due to the inefficiency. Teaching a language requires more than speaking it.\n\nThird encounter with learning Chinese language (learning Chinese online)\n\nI came in contact with Ms. Clary Xue, who did an academic research on learning Chinese online. Unfortunately I was too late to take part on this research, but we kept contact. After some months I booked an introduction to Chinese learning InspiringChinese.com . Since Ms. Xue is located in Beijing, we communicated on different online based platforms. The online interactive whiteboard is a great help.\n\nBTW: got a tablet meanwhile. Improves my life.\n\nLesson 1\n\nMs. Xue checked my skills first. Guess she found some basic ideas about intonation and Pinyin. After one lesson I had a set of vocabularies to cover the first words on a formal encounter. For communication we used VOIP and an interactive online whiteboard. The lesson included “homework” and documentation, which I received a few hours later by email.\n\nLesson 2\n\nAfter repeating the previous lesson we started with new words. Ms. Xue has a defined curriculum and enlarged my vocabulary to the first sentences. Now I can introduce myself as well as other people. Chinese obviously people like relations, so often a title is attached to the family name (“laoshi Xue” for “teacher Xue”).\n\nThere are words for each member of the family, like younger brother “didi” or older sister “jiejie”. In the internet I even found the word “xiaojiuzi” for “younger brother of the wife”.\n\n~\n\nHappy Chinese New Year!\n\nhttp://chinese-new-year-cards.blogspot.com\n\n~\n\nLessons 5 & 6\n\nIn these lessons Ms. Xue had a hard time with me. Due to personal circumstances I could not focus well on the lessons. Some days later I received an audio file as a review of the previous lessons.\n\nLesson 7\n\nAs a customer of Deutsche Telekom (which provides my telephone and internet line), I sometimes can make phone calls and surf the internet. In trying to improve this state, an engineer of the Deutsche Telekom began his job shortly before the lesson and interrupted it later on.\n\nToday we went through simple conversations. I learned how to invite someone and to make an appointment. Ms. Xue introduced me to the word “le”, which indicates a completion of an action.\n\nLesson 8\n\nOne of my favourite words: xǐhuan – to like…\n\n~\n\n~\n\nLesson 9\n\nNow I got a little further in conversation.\n\n~\n\nOne year later…\n\n历史 的 茶 在 德国\n\n在 德国 我们 知道 茶 250 年 以前. 中国人 在 Java 卖 茶 给 荷兰人。 25０ 年 以前 啤酒 最 safe drink。 1750 年 茶 也 是 safe drink。开水 对 身体 很好。 德国的 政府 不 喜欢人们 喝 茶。 钱 去 在 荷兰 和 中国。\n\nFrederick / Friedrich II 岁 68)\n\n他的 外祖父 去 英国。 他 married 王后 Anne 也 是 国王。 他的 名字 George I.\n\n1750 也 土豆 在 德国 去。 这个 时间 是了 beginning of industrialization (The „Königlich Preußische Asiatische Compagnie in Emden nach Canton und China – Imperial Prussian Asian Company in Emden/Germany to Guangdong and China” founded in 1751 already was 股份 公司！一半 shareholders 是了 荷兰人。\n\n词 “tea” (德语 “Tee”) 去 广东语 (caa4/taa4)。 欧洲人 说 “tea” 即使 我们 卖 给 广东。 “Tea” 去 跟 船。 别的 国 卖 茶 在 丝绸之路 (silk road)。 俄国人 也 阿拉伯人 说 “Chai” (Tshai). 他们 卖 给 中国 北方。 中国 北方人 说 茶叶 [茶葉] cháyè (tea leaves).\n\n(Europeans transported the tea by ship from southern China, so they also took the Cantonese “taa4”.

The present study, in which recent data from 9 countries and 4 continents was collected, is a re-examination of his country classifications. The results suggest that many shifts have occurred since Hofstede’s study in 1980. These shifts are related to some of the major environmental changes that have occurred.\n\n(…)\n\nDiscussion: Overall, the findings of the present study suggests that there have been significant shifts in value classifications in some countries since Hofstede conducted his original study. Many of the countries examined in the present study showed a shift in ranking when compared with Hofstede’s original data. This finding underscores the fact that, although a nation’s work-related values are deep-seated preferences for certain end states. they are subject to change over the years as external environmental changes shape a society. Managers and scientists should use caution before attempting to use work-related values to understand human behaviour in organisations. At the least, managers should make an effort to determine the values currently prevailing and not rely on classifications or labels placed on cultures by researchers.\n\nD. R. Fernandez, D.S.

For one thing, all Chinese names have a literal meaning, which is to say the characters that comprise a Chinese name have common meaning in the language. Most Western names do not have any actual or literal meaning and cannot be translated as such. Many of my Chinese students will ask me to suggest an “English name” for them and, then, upon hearing it, will immediately ask “What does it mean?” Unfortunately, the answer to that question is usually “It doesn’t mean anything!” (…)\n\nDownload the whole pdf here or here.\n\n.\n\n~\n\nPhoto retrievet 18.11.2012 at http://onionjuggler.wordpress.com/2012/11/18/the-naming-of-students/dsc_0474/\n\n~\n\nSee the full post at Force Feeding Duck Style about the naming os students.

But obviously language is more than grammar, and so conclusions about language in general cannot be drawn from studies which deal only with questions of grammar. (…)\n\nWilhelm von Humboldt (* 22. Juni 1767 in Potsdam; † 8. April 1835 in Tegel)\n\n(…) Man lives with objects [around him] mainly, or rather — as feeling and action depend on the ideas which he entertains about the objects — exclusively in the way in which language presents them to him. The very activity by which he spins language out from within himself eventually gets himself entwined in it, and every language draws a circle around the nation to which it belongs, and which one can only leave to the extent that at the same time one enters the circle of another. (…) Humboldt’s German is difficult to translate. By “lives” here he means “experiences life” and by “objects” he means items of objective reality or noumena in the Kantian sense. The sentence in the original German reads as follows: Der Mensch lebt mit den Gegenständen hauptsächlich, ja, da Empfinden und Handlen in ihm von seinen Vorstellungen abhängen, sogar ausschließlich so, wie die Sprache sie ihm zuführt. Durch denselben Akt, vermöge dessen er die Sprache aus sich herausspinnt, spinnt er sich in dieselbe ein, und jede zieht um das Volk, welchem sie angehört, einen Kreis, aus dem es nur insofern hinauszugehen möglich ist, als man zugleich in den Kreis einer andren hinübertritt.

Mai 1806 in Pentonville; † 8. Mai 1873 in Avignon)\n\n(…) Names [i.e. nouns] are impressions of sense, and as such take the strongest hold on the mind, and of all other impressions can be most easily recalled and retained in view. They therefore serve to give a point of attachment to all the more volatile objects of thought and feeling. Impressions, that when past might be dissipated for ever, are, by their connexion with language, always within reach. Thoughts, of themselves, are perpetually slipping out of the field of immediate mental vision; but the name abides with us, and the utterance of it restores them in a moment. Words are the custodiers of every product of mind less impressive than themselves. All extensions of human knowledge, all new generalizations, are fixed and spread, even unintentionally, by the use of words.

People’s ideas of time differ across languages in other ways. For example, English speakers tend to talk about time using horizontal spatial metaphors (e.g., “The best is ahead of us,” “The worst is behind us”), whereas Mandarin speakers have a vertical metaphor for time (e.g., the next month is the “down month” and the last month is the “up month”). Mandarin speakers talk about time vertically more often than English speakers do, so do Mandarin speakers think about time vertically more often than English speakers do? Imagine this simple experiment. I stand next to you, point to a spot in space directly in front of you, and tell you, “This spot, here, is today. Where would you put yesterday? And where would you put tomorrow?” When English speakers are asked to do this, they nearly always point horizontally. But Mandarin speakers often point vertically, about seven or eight times more often than do English speakers.\n\n(..)\n\nDoes treating chairs as masculine and beds as feminine in the grammar make Russian speakers think of chairs as being more like men and beds as more like women in some way? It turns out that it does. In one study, we asked German and Spanish speakers to describe objects having opposite gender assignment in those two languages. The descriptions they gave differed in a way predicted by grammatical gender. For example, when asked to describe a “key” — a word that is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish — the German speakers were more likely to use words like “hard,” “heavy,” “jagged,” “metal,” “serrated,” and “useful,” whereas Spanish speakers were more likely to say “golden,” “intricate,” “little,” “lovely,” “shiny,” and “tiny.” To describe a “bridge,” which is feminine in German and masculine in Spanish, the German speakers said “beautiful,” “elegant,” “fragile,” “peaceful,” “pretty,” and “slender,” and the Spanish speakers said “big,” “dangerous,” “long,” “strong,” “sturdy,” and “towering.” This was true even though all testing was done in English, a language without grammatical gender. The same pattern of results also emerged in entirely nonlinguistic tasks (e.g., rating similarity between pictures). And we can also show that it is aspects of language per se that shape how people think: teaching English speakers new grammatical gender systems influences mental representations of objects in the same way it does with German and Spanish speakers.

Sorry for this.\n\nIt is made of 3 layers around a core. The core stands for the values of a certain culture, which is not moving a lot. It mostly remains the same. Even if something seems to be outdated, it still can subconsciously play a role in the present. That includes individuals as well as groups.\n\n~\n\nThe first layer around the core is described as rituals. A ritual can be the way of personal hygiene (most Asians shower in the evening, Europeans in the morning). German people like to shake hands often, Malay tenderly touch the fingertips and then point it to the heart. Those rituals are changing slowly.\n\n~\n\nThe second layer around the core are the „heroes“. A hero can be a fictive person, but has influence on the culture. A nice example is Dracula (written by Bram Stoker, published 1897). Since this book was published, many people in Western world developed a fear about Vampires, even if it never existed in their culture before. It also can be national heroes, photo-models or scientists – all people, who play a role-model in that society.\n\n~\n\nThe third layer is about the symbols. Nowadays most symbols appear as brands like BMW, Apple or Louis Vuitton. Those symbols usually move according to the momentary fashion.\n\n~\n\nAll three layers can be trained and learned through practices except for the core: the inner cultural values (Good vs. Bad, dirty vs. clean, ugly vs. beautiful, unnatural vs. natural, abnormal vs. normal, paradoxical vs. logical, irrational vs. rational).\n\nFor further information about the core, please refer to The Core of Hofstede’s Onion Model.\n\n~\n\nHofstede also developed the Model of the 5 Cultural Dimensions https://laofutze.wordpress.com/2010/01/09/hofstedes-cultural-dimensions-2/\n\nDownload an introduction to Hofstede`s theories as pdf here or see further info about Hofstede at https://laofutze.wordpress.com/category/hofstede/\n\nPractical approaches of Hofstede’s theories see at https://laofutze.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/applications-of-hofstedes-theories/\n\n.\n\nreviewed 13.09.2013\n\nHigh Context Communication and Low Context Communication\n\n.\n\nThe Context\n\nThe context gives additional information, which is necessary to encode the whole situation / background of a given information.\n\n(retrieved 10.05.2014 at http://my.ilstu.edu/~jrbaldw/372/Values.htm)\n\n.\n\nHigh Context\n\nAn example for High Context Communication would be the question, where my (the editor’s) black pepper is. A high context information would be: above my micro-wave. Those people, who know me, my apartment and my kitchen can immediately find the pepper. Their context is to know who I am, where I live, where my kitchen is and where micro-wave. Without the context (additional information) there is not enough information to encrypt the proper meaning.\n\nIn high context communication an information can have different meanings according. It needs additional information to encode (understand). Speaking in examples is also a high context information.\n\nLess verbally explicit communication, less written/formal information\n\nMore internalized understandings of what is communicated\n\nMultiple cross-cutting ties and intersections with others\n\nLong term relationships\n\nStrong boundaries- who is accepted as belonging vs who is considered an “outsider”\n\nKnowledge is situational, relational.\n\nDecisions and activities focus around personal face-to-face relationships, often around a central person who has authority.\n\n(quoted from Culture at Work http://www.culture-at-work.com/highlow.html)\n\n(retrieved 12.09.2013 at http://www.culture-at-work.com/highlow.html)\n\n.\n\nHigh Context Communication is also common in many Western countries\n\n“The table sheds light on just how difficult it can be for a foreigner to understand what the British really mean when they’re speaking – especially for those take every word at face value. Phrases that prove the trickiest to decipher include ‘you must come for dinner’, which foreigners tend to take as a direct invitation, but is actually said out of politeness by many Britons and often does not result in an invite. The table also reveals that when a person from Britain begins a sentence “with the greatest respect …’, they actually mean ‘I think you are an idiot’.” (Alice Philipson in The Telegraph 02 Sep 2013)\n\nWHAT THE BRITISH SAY WHAT THE BRITISH MEAN WHAT FOREIGNERS UNDERSTAND I hear what you say I disagree and do not want to discuss it further He accepts my point of view With the greatest respect You are an idiot He is listening to me That’s not bad That’s good That’s poor That is a very brave proposal You are insane He thinks I have courage Quite good A bit disappointing Quite good I would suggest Do it or be prepared to justify yourself Think about the idea, but do what you like Oh, incidentally/ by the way The primary purpose of our discussion is That is not very important I was a bit disappointed that I am annoyed that It doesn’t really matter Very interesting That is clearly nonsense They are impressed I’ll bear it in mind I’ve forgotten it already They will probably do it I’m sure it’s my fault It’s your fault Why do they think it was their fault? You must come for dinner It’s not an invitation, I’m just being polite I will get an invitation soon I almost agree I don’t agree at all He’s not far from agreement I only have a few minor comments Please rewrite completely He has found a few typos Could we consider some other options I don’t like your idea They have not yet decided\n\n(retrieved 30.09.2013 at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/10280244/Translation-table-explaining-the-truth-behind-British-politeness-becomes-internet-hit.html)\n\n.\n\nLow Context\n\nA good manual is an example of low context communication / information. No other information is necessary to understand it. In low context communication an information has only one single meaning. No additional information is necessary to encode (understand) the meaning.\n\nRule oriented, people play by external rules\n\nMore knowledge is codified public, external, and accessible.\n\nSequencing, separation–of time, of space, of activities, of relationships\n\nMore interpersonal connections of shorter duration\n\nKnowledge is more often transferable\n\nTask-centered. Decisions and activities focus around what needs to be done, division of responsibilities.\n\n(received 10.05.2014 at http://www.culture-at-work.com/highlow.html)\n\n~\n\nHigh Context vs. Low Context\n\nTake a look how members of high and low contextual cultures see themselves and their opposites:\n\nHigh Context Communication\n\npolite\n\nrespectful\n\nintegrates by similarities/harmony\n\nnot direct\n\nLow Context Communication\n\nopen\n\ntrue\n\nintegrates by authenticity\n\ndirect\n\nHigh Context claims Low Context\n\nimpolite\n\n“cannot read between the lines”\n\nnaïve\n\nno self discipline\n\ntoo fast\n\nLow Context claims High Context\n\nhiding information\n\nnot trustable\n\narrogant\n\ntoo formal\n\ntoo slow\n\nFor an example how a low context culture interacts with a high context culture as the Chinese, please visit GlobThink: http://globthink.com/2009/06/24/indirect-communication-and-indirect-leadership-in-asia/ Unfortunately this link is broken / not existing anymore (reviewed 12.12.2012)\n\n~\n\nApplications of Hall`s Theories about the Context\n\nWebsite Design in High and Low Context Cultures\n\nParameter: Tendency in HC Cultures Tendency in LC Cultures Animation High use of animation, especially in connection with images of moving people Lower use of animation, mainly reserved for highlighting effects e.g., of text Promotion of values Images promote values characteristic of collectivist societies Images promote values characteristic of individualistic societies Individuals separate or together with the product Featured images depict products and merchandise in use by individuals Images portray lifestyles of individuals, with or without a direct emphasis on the use of products or merchandise Level of transparency Links promote an exploratory approach to navigation on the website; process-oriented Clear and redundant cues in connection with navigation on a website; goal-oriented Linear vs. parallel navigation on the website Many sidebars and menus, opening of new browser windows for each new page Few sidebars and menus, constant opening in same browser window\n\nLink to the current Mc Donald’s Website in China\n\n.\n\nHigh Context Cultures\n\nJapan Arab Countries Greece Spain Italy England France North America Scandinavian Countries German-speaking Countries\n\nLow Context Cultures\n\nLink to the current website Mc Donad`s Germany\n\n~\n\n(…) Meanwhile, it’s rolling out a new social media campaign, asking consumers to share favorite moments at the store, and it made a massive ad buy on Baidu, China’s main search engine, this weekend.

His most recent trip takes him to China,where he is scheduled to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Patrick Chang.\n\nMr. Rosen and his training team arrived in Beijing three days ago for a scheduled appointment with Mr. Chang. However, Mr. Chang has not yet met with Mr. Rosen or his team. Finally, a call to Mr. Rosen’s hotel room indicates that Mr. Chang is prepared to meet with him. When Mr. Rosen arrives at the location, he is asked to wait outside Mr. Chang’s office. As he waits, he notices many people entering and leaving Mr. Chang’s office at a very quick pace. The hallways of this building are a hustle and bustle of activity, with people shuffling in and out of many rooms. Finally, after several hours, Mr. Rosen is called in to meet Mr. Chang.\n\nMr. Rosen: Ah, Mr. Chang, it’s so good to finally see you. Gosh, I’ve been waiting for days. Did you forget our appointment?\n\nMr. Chang: Hello, Mr. Rosen. Please sit down. Everything is fine?\n\nMr. Rosen: Actually no … (Phone rings) … the problem is …\n\nMr. Chang: Excuse me … (Takes the phone call and speaks in Chinese. After several minutes he concludes the phone conversation) Yes, now … everything is fine?\n\nMr. Rosen: Well, actually, I’ve got a small problem. You see, the computer equipment you ordered…(A staff person enters the room and hands Mr. Chang something to sign.)\n\nMr. Chang: Oh, excuse me… (signs the document) Yes, now, everything is fine?\n\nMr. Rosen: As I was saying … all of the computer equipment you ordered is just sitting on a ship at the dock. I need your help in getting it unloaded. I mean, it’s been there for two weeks!\n\nMr. Chang: I see … This is no problem.\n\nMr. Rosen: Well, if it sits in the heat much longer, it could be damaged. Could I get you to sign a worksgroups to have it unloaded by Friday?\n\nMr. Chang: There is no need for that. The job will get done.\n\nMr. Rosen: Well, could we set up some kind of deadline? You see, I have a staff of people here waiting to train your people on the equipment. I need to let them know when it will be ready. How about this Friday? Could we do it then? My people are here now, and they’re waiting to begin training.\n\nMr.Chang: Dont worry. We have been living quite well without those equipment for years. If necessary, we could wait for several weeks. That’s not the problem.\n\nThere is little chance that Mr. Chang will sign any kind of workgroups for Mr. Rosen. Mr. Rosen is also distressed by the constant interruptions. To Mr. Chang, Mr. Rosen is in too much of a hurry. Mr. Rosen is monochronic, whereas Mr. Chang operates from a polychronic time orientation.\n\nGet the full pdf here or visit the website.\n\n~\n\nProxemics\n\nProxemics is the theory, that people from different cultures have different (imaginary) spaces around them.

EA observers exhibited a significant deficit in categorizing ‘‘fear’’ and ‘‘disgust’’ compared to WC observers. Also, WC observers distributed their fixations evenly across the face, whereas EA observers systematically biased theirs toward the eye region. A model observer revealed that EA observers sample information that is highly similar between certain expressions (i.e., ‘‘fear’’ and ‘‘surprise’’; ‘‘disgust’’ and ‘‘anger’’). Despite the apparent lack of diagnostic information, EA observers persisted in repetitively sampling the eye regions of ‘‘fear,’’ ‘‘disgust,’’ and ‘‘anger.’’\n\nDownload the .pdf here or online here.\n\nCultural Confusions Show that Facial Expressions Are Not Universal\n\nCultural Confusions Show that Facial Expressions Are Not Universal – Rachael E.

When the name of a color (e.g., “blue,” “green,” or “red”) is printed in a color not denoted by the name (e.g., the word “red” printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop who first published the effect in English in 1935. The effect had previously been published in Germany in 1929. The original paper has been one of the most cited papers in the history of experimental psychology, leading to more than 700 replications. The effect has been used to create a psychological test (Stroop Test) that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.\n\n(Wikipedia, retrieved 08.01.2011)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nStroop Effect on Morphosyllabic and Alphabetical Readers\n\n.\n\n~\n\nTwenty-three Chinese and 24 German undergraduate students were tested in a Stroop paradigm with the following stimuli: color patches, color-neutral words (e.g., friend printed in yellow), incongruently colour-associated words (e.g., blood printed in blue), and incongruently colour words (e.g., yellow printed in blue). Results revealed no differences in German and Chinese students’ response times to colour patches. Chinese participants, however, showed longer colour naming latencies for neutral words as well as for colour words and colour-related words. No differences between German and Chinese participants were found when print colour latencies for neutral words were subtracted from print colour latencies for colour words and colour-related words. This result does not support theories which suggest that for morphosyllabic readers there is a direct route from orthography to the semantics of a word. We rather argue, with reference to dual route models of reading, that access from print to phonology is faster for morphosyllabic than for alphabetic readers, and therefore interference caused by conflicting phonologies of colour name and written word will be stronger in Chinese readers than in German readers.\n\nHENRIK SAALBACH and ELSBETH STERN / Psychonomic Bulletin & Review 2004, 11 (4), 709–715 / Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany\n\nDownload the full pdf here.\n\nSee “How Language influences our Thinking” or “Choosing a foreign Name” or search the Category “Language“.\n\n.\n\nUpdated 14.01.2011\n\nMIT imaging shows culture\n\ninfluences brain function"
