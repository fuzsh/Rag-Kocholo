A Domain Authority score ranges from 1 to 100, with higher scores corresponding to a greater ability to rank. Domain Authority is calculated by evaluating multiple factors, including linking root domains and number of total links, into a single DA score. This score can then be used when comparing websites or tracking the \"ranking strength\" of a website over time. Domain Authority is not a metric used by Google in determining search rankings and has no effect on the SERPs.\n\nMoz PA(Page Authority): This value show the root page of this domain's Page Authority/ Page Authority (PA) is a score developed by Moz that predicts how well a specific page will rank on search engine result pages.

Basically more content and more indexed page is always better.\n\nAlexa Rank:Alexa Global Rank. Alexa is one of the most common website tracker.
