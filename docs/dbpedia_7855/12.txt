I haven’t taken a closer look at this yet, but it’s an interesting approach. Seems a bit sleazy perhaps to show women in lingerie to teach Chinese, but I’m not one to judge. ;)

Pinyin tone mark placement mnemonic

This seems like something you would pick up automatically over time, but somehow it’s not. At least on my part, I kept having problems with remembering it. There’s different ways of putting the rules, but what works best for me is:

The tone mark goes on the vowel that’s first in this sequence: a o e i u (ü)

Except for -iu, where it goes on the u

Alternative mnemonic: All vowels in use

I say, I say, I say…

甲: 昨天我在舞場舞得正酣 • 忽然有人將我拖我出去

乙: 是巡捕麼 ?

甲: 不！是我的老婆
