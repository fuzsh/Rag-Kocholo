Moroccan Tea (Moroccan in Qatar)

Just arrived into Doha, Qatar from Hong Kong. Never experienced such a hot weather. No one even walks on the road! Stupidly I asked to be seated outside the Sharq Village and Spa terrace, they looked at me strange and after 3 minutes, I came in as a lobster! First cuppa tea was moroccan tea with some Qatari delicacy.

A TA GUELE (BELGIAN IN TOKYO)

Care for some Creme Brûlée?

We were looking for a restaurant that serves game meat and we ended up at this one. The chef used to serve the Japanese Ambassador to Belgium. The food was French/Belgium and spectacular food! One thing that put me off was the game birds hung outside the restaurant and the French wines, which usually give me a big headache. Best of all was the Creme Brûlée with a thick layer of caramelized sugar on top. Truly amazing. Just make sure you reserve this restaurant as it is always fully booked!
