        "text": "A knowledge graph represents a finite set of linked triples and illustrates the relationships between them. The information is stored in a graph database and visualized as a graph structure. The entities and relationships that form the linked triples must be created using formal semantics, contribute to one another, and represent diverse data connected and described by semantic metadata. A knowledge graph is similar in structure to a property graph, but it has formalized schemas and other more sophisticated structures that extend its utility across different platforms and with diverse datasets.\n\nWC3 (2014) RDF 1.1 Primer: The following diagram depicts an informal graph of simple triples.\n\nPermitted with W3C license."
