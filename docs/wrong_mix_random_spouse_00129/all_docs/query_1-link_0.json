        "text": "Dr. Jeffery C. Allison passed away on Monday, July 22, 2024 at Mercy Health-St. Rita’s Medical Center, Lima.\n\nJeff was born September 27, 1948 in Altoona, PA, to the late John and Charlotte (Lynn) Allison.\n\nHe is survived by his children: Scott (Arlene) Allison of Ada and Shari (Patrick) Gibson of Johnstown; five grandchildren: Rob, Grace, Jillian, Lydia and Joey; and two brothers: Bruce (Janet) Allison and John (Roland) Allison. He was previously married to Nancy Wood Allison.\n\nCONTINUES\n\nBy Cort Reynolds\n\nHARROD__By the time she graduates next spring, Allen East three-sport standout Rilynn Jones will be one, if not the most decorated female high school athlete the area has ever produced.\n\nIt is highly possible that Jones could make all-state in all three sports. She already has achieved that lofty goal in track and soccer, with basketball being the third and hardest All-Ohio team she has yet to crack.\n\nAchieving such a triple crown would be a singular accomplishment. Ohio expanding its number of divisions for high school sports should help, too.\n\nCONTINUES\n\nThe Allen County Department of Health has shared the following message from the Centers for Disease Control:\n\nLISTERIA OUTBREAK:\n\n28 people are sick, with 2 deaths, in 12 states. Do not eat meats you get sliced at any deli counter, unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot. Investigators are collecting as much information as possible to figure out which deli meats are contaminated. https://bit.ly/4cPl2dO/"
