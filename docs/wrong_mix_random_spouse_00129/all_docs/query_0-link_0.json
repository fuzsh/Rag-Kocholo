We met last summer and became friends. When I met Terrance he was employed by the United States Army and was stationed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG). He worked for the CHPPM department in the Edgewood Area of APG. (His old e-mail address used to be Terrance.Blackwesll@APG.AMEDD.Army.Mil). When we met he explained that he would be transferred in November to Italy and we always promised to keep in touch. A family emergancy arouse with my grandmother in Philadelphia so I had to leave town to tend to her needs. When I returned I tried to contact Terrance on his cell phone number but was unable to reach him. On the day that I called his mother answered his cell phone and said he was called away suddently and she was not exactly sure where he was going or when he would be back she sounded very sad and at the time so was I knowing the conditions the wo! rld was in at the time. I later tried to call the cell number again, but the number was no longer in service. I do not have Terrance's mother's phone number so I have not been able to follow-up with her regarding his whereabouts and his safety. I am very worried at this point because it is not like him to not keep in touch. I am not sure if he still went to Italy or if he is defending the country somewhere; I hope and pray to God he was not involved in a casualty. I am not sure what can be done in this instance, but just knowing that he is safe and sound would take a huge weight off of me. Is there anything you can do to assist?
