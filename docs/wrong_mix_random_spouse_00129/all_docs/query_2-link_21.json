Like when all someone needs to do is type my name into google and see the spotify attached to the knowledge graph.\n\nSolved! Go to Solution.\n\nI did but the devs over at Google told me it's spotify who is the only one's who can do it for me.\n\nAnd to refer them to this\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/\n\nI had a similar issue, but just got the message below from Spotify. They are not incredibly helpful. Back to square one. Would appreciate any advice or feedback.\n\nThanks for reaching out.\n\nIt’s currently not possible to link your Spotify artist profile to your Google API key.\n\nOur product teams are always looking at new ways to improve the artist experience on Spotify.\n\nWe can’t make any promises, but we really appreciate your feedback on this.\n\nWe recommend getting in touch with Google. They're the best folks to help!\n\nIf there's anything else, Just shout.\n\nTake care,\n\nRohan\n\nNow I am mystified.... Why would they help one user, and not help another one with precisely the same issue? Especially since Google refers me to them.\n\nI just wrote to Spotify Artist Support team again, hopefully this time around they'll be able to help out.\n\nM"
