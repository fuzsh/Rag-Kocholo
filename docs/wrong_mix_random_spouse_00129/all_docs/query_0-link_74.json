Born on January 26, 1925, in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Newman's interest in theater began at a young age. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he embarked on his acting journey, enrolling at the Yale School of Drama and later studying under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York City. Newman's career took a monumental turn when he starred in the film Somebody Up There Likes Me in 1956.

Beyond the world of entertainment, Newman had a passion for auto racing, a hobby he picked up while filming the 1969 movie Winning. Proving his prowess on the racetrack, Newman won several national championships as a driver in the Sports Car Club of America. He combined his love for racing with his dedication to giving back, co-founding the nonprofit Newman's Own, which donates all post-tax profits to charity.\n\nAge : Dec. at 83 (1925-2008)\n\nBirthplace : Shaker Heights, Ohio, USA\n\nProfession : Activist, Businessperson, Entrepreneur, Film Producer, Racing driver\n\nCredits : Cool Hand Luke, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, Cars\n\nWalt Disney, born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois, was a pioneering figure in the field of animation. His creative vision and relentless innovation transformed the entertainment industry and made him a cultural icon. From humble beginnings as a cartoonist, he went on to co-found The Walt Disney Company with his brother Roy O. Disney, establishing a multimedia empire that endures to this day. Disney's journey to success began with his first venture, Laugh-O-Gram Studio, which went bankrupt. Undeterred, he moved to Hollywood and created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. After losing the rights to Oswald due to a contract dispute, Disney came up with a new character- Mickey Mouse. The debut of Mickey Mouse in \"Steamboat Willie\" in 1928 marked a critical turning point in his career. The innovative use of sound in this short film set a new standard for animated cartoons. Over the years, Disney continued to push the boundaries of technology and storytelling. He introduced the first feature-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in 1937. This was followed by other classics such as Cinderella, Peter Pan, and The Lion King. He also ventured into television with shows like The Mickey Mouse Club and Zorro. However, his most ambitious project was the creation of Disneyland in 1955, an amusement park that brought his imaginative world to life. Disney passed away in 1966, leaving behind a legacy of creativity and innovation that continues to inspire generations.\n\nAge : Dec. at 65 (1901-1966)\n\nBirthplace : Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\nProfession : Businessperson, Television producer, Film Producer, Actor, Animator\n\nCredits : Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, Peter Pan, 101 Dalmatians, The Skeleton Dance\n\nGeorge Harrison, widely recognized as the lead guitarist of the Beatles, was born on February 25, 1943, in Liverpool, England. From a young age, he showcased an affinity for music, particularly for guitars, which later propelled him to international stardom. Despite his humble beginnings, his talent and determination led him to become one of the most influential guitarists in the history of rock music. His work with the Beatles, from their formation in 1960 until their disbandment in 1970, brought forth a new era in music, with songs like \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" \"Something,\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\" standing as timeless classics. Harrison's role in the Beatles, however, was not limited to his guitar playing. He also contributed significantly to the band's songwriting, often exploring themes of spirituality and introspection. His interest in Hinduism, Indian culture, and Eastern musical influences were evident in many of his compositions. This distinct flavor added another dimension to the Beatles' music, making it more diverse and eclectic. Post-Beatles, Harrison embarked on a successful solo career, releasing several acclaimed albums like All Things Must Pass and Living in the Material World.
