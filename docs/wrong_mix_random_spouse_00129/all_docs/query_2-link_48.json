You can observe the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches in ORKG comparisons, visualizations and leaderboards.\n\nConvince peer-reviewers\n\nWhen you accompany your research with an ORKG comparison showing how your approach compares to the state-of-the-art you help peer-reviewers to understand the merits of your work and chances your paper will be accepted increase.\n\nProvide a key service to your community\n\nResearcher like you are craving for obtaining an overview on the state-of-the art in your field. By organizing the research as comparisons and visualizations you will help many in your field to stay atop of the paper flood.\n\nKnowledge base for science\n\nWe are flooded with new publications in research every day and it is increasingly challenging to keep up with the information overload. By organizing research contributions in the ORKG you help yourself and others in your field to keep oversight over the state-of-the-art.\n\nGet more visibility\n\nWe prominently acknowledge all contributions to the ORKG. Other researchers in your field will appreciate the service you are doing."
