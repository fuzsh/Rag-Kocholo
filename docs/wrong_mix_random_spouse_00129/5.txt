[NOTE by Chet Snow: Although I disagree with this source's arrangement of earlier generations in England, it seems to describe the 17-18 Century Delmarva Prettyman family well. No one seems to know much about the Prettyman wives, however. One family tree says there is a record of John II's wife: "Mary Prettyman" in 1671 but it could have been John II's mother.

In 1676 the names of William and John, Jr. appear in the list of tithables for Accomack County, Virginia. They apparently had just started out to farm that year and no doubt were the sons of John, Sr. In 1683 John, Jr's name appears for the last time among the tithables. He must have taken over the business of his father for that same year John, Jr. acting as attorney for his father, of "Messongoe", sold 450 acres to Thomas Barton. During the period from 1663 to 1686 John, Jr. and his father acquired 3040 acres of land and sold 2790 acres of it. In 1671 his wife's name Mary appears, for the first and last time, in the transaction of the sale of 400 acres to George Dewey. P. 40-41, The Prettyman Family, by Rev. Prettyman, in the Prettyman File.

[NOTE by Chet Snow: This seems the best overall source for Prettyman history but it is sometimes hard to read. Only an "Unsourced Ancestry.com Tree" has any data about John Prettyman II's first wife, whom dates would indicate was mother of all his children. Mary, widow of Richard Marriner, could only have married John Prettyman II after March 1690. The source of the information below is from: - "The Prettyman Files".

PRETTYMAN GENERATION TWO:[1]

P28. JOHN (2) PRETTYMAN, [(JohnA-1, RobertB, ThomasC, JohnD, JohnE, WilliamF, WilliamG, WilliamH, JohnI)], b ca 1653 [83] Northampton Co., VA, d bet 24 Mar 1724 and 31 Mar 1724 m. 1st: Unknown _____; m. 2nd: bet 17 March 1690/91 and 20 Sep 1693: Mary Marriner b ca 1649. apparently the widow of Richard Marriner. Mary Marriner was sued in Accomack County, VA on 20 Sep 1693, but because she was married to John Prittiman the suit was dismissed.85 Mary Marriner testified in court on 19 May 1675 that she was aged about 26 years.86 Richard Marriner and Mary Marriner deeded their interest in land of Henry Sudbury in 1678.87 It appears that Richard Marriner died by 17 March 1690/91 as he was sued in Accomack County and could not be found by the sheriff.88 Richard Marriner sued on 17 Oct 1664 in Accomack County for his freedom, and he testified he was imported as servant 5 years before [1659].89 On 21 November 1694, John Prettiman sued John Bloxsom for 520 pounds of tobacco.90 Giving a deposition in this case on 20 March 1694/95 was George Mariner. George, aged about 23 years, stated sometime in October 1693, He was at the house of Jon. Prettiman, his "father-in-law" [step-father], when John Bloxum agreed to pay 30 pounds of tobacco per head to winter cattle. Another deposition given in support of Prettyman was by Edward Moore, aged about 56 years. The court found that in 1693 John Bloxum Sr., pastured 15 head of cattle on Prettiman’s plantation at Messango, and awarded Prettiman 420 pounds of tobacco.[91][2]

Robert Burton, on 16 February 1691/92 petitioned the Accomack Court to be discharged from the office of constable as he had served three years. John Prettiman was appointed in his place.118 As Mr. John Prettiman he served on the Accomack County jury 18 February 1691/92 to 20 December 1693.119 Constable John Prettiman on 22 March 1692/93, complained to the court that John Bloxum had "violently and insolently demeaned himself towards him" while he was executing a warrant issued by Mr. William Anderson. The court considered tht the action was done in contempt and fined Bloxum 400 pounds of tobacco, court costs and he was to be taken into custody till giving bond for his good behavior.120 On behalf of himself and his neighbors, John Prettiman, on 2 October 1693, petitioned the court that all of the roads between Muddy Creek and Messango were very foul and much required clearing which was neglected by the remissness of the overseers in those precincts. The roads between Messango and Pocomoke and also between Assawamon and Samuel Tayler’s bridge on the sea had also been neglected. It was ordered that the surveyors in the above precincts clear the highways and repair the bridges before the next court,and sheriff was to give them the order.121 Henry Brookes, on 18 December 1693, as surveyor of the highways in the upper precincts of the county, petitioned the court that he had obtained a warrant from Mr. William Burton, Justice of Peace, for Constable John Prittiman to notify all tithable persons to clear the highways. Prittiman did not do it, so it was ordered that he be summoned to the next court.122 John Bloxum, in May 1694, accused Elizabeth Morris of illegally taking a calf belonging to Bloxum. Constable John Prettiman on a warrant made a search and found the calf in Elizabeth’s possession.123 John Kelly sued John Prettiman for assault and battery, and Prettiman confessed the fact. The Court, on 20 June 1694, ordered that Prettiman pay Kelly 25 pounds of tobacco.124 On 18 September 1694, John Prettiman sued John Bloxum for 420 pounds of tobacco, and Bluxom had obtained a nonsuit against Prettiman. Prettiman presented 52 pounds of tobacco to Court in payment of the fine on 20 February 1694/95.125 John Morris and John Prettiman sued each other in November 1695 and the suits were dismissed. Prettiman failed to appear on his suit on 18 December 1695.126 On 18 December 1695, Sheriff Capt. George Parker brought action against John Prettiman for 1718 pounds of tobacco, but the case was dismissed because Parker failed to appear to prosecute.127

John’s son, John, testifying in the Maryland and Pennsylvania border dispute stated "that his father about 43 years ago [1696] removed from Virginia and came into the Inlet near Fenick’s Island, and loaded his goods upon the same Island; and that he this Deponent resided on the said Island and in the neighborhood thereof for a month or six weeks."128 It appears that John may have moved to Sussex County, Pennsylvania [Delaware] in 1695. There was filed with the Accomack County Court a list of the cattle that John took out of a pen on Messongo and transported out of Accomack County on 5 September 1695. The livestock he took out of the county was two black horses six years old; four cows and calfs; three cowes with a yearling; one four year old bull; one two year old steer and three two year old heifers.129 James Davis, George Gwine, Joseph Glading and Ingold viewed the cattle before they were taken out of the county. That he moved to Sussex County in 1695 is further indicated by Accomack County Court records on 19 December 1695. Capt. Thomas Welburene sued John in Accomack County for 565 pounds of tobacco, but Prettiman could not be found. Attachment was granted against Prettiman’s estate to pay the debt and court costs.130 By 1 March 1697/8 John was overseer of the highways to the Indian River in Sussex County as he was presented to the court for not mending the bridges and clearing the roads.131. In 1698 he was on the Grand Jury for Sussex.132 On 5 September 1699, John served on jury, and in 1709 was on the Grand Jury with his son John.133

On 2 March 1696/7 John Prettyman purchased 250 acres of land from John Stuckbury called "Hooknorton" on North side of Indian River in Sussex County, Delaware.134 Then on 8 December 1697, John Prettyman purchased 200 acres of the 400 acres of land called "Tower Hill" from James Peterkin on Pagan Creek in Sussex County.135 On 2 September 1701 as John Prittiman Sr, Yeoman, he deeded for 50 pounds 250 acres of "Hook Norton" to John Prittiman Jr Planter.136 The deed describes the land in Sussex County as back in the woods on north side of Indian River and land beginning on a branch of Back Creek and near the tract of land called "Shotton Hill".

We have found no record of the name of John’s first wife, but we believe she is the mother of all his children. We have based the ages of John’s sons on when they first performed jury service in Sussex County. John’s son, John, first served on a jury in 1699 when he was 22 years old. We have assumed that a man started service on a jury at age 21, and for William we have also used the fact that he owned land in 1701. We have given John the title John II. John made his will on 24 March 1723/24 and it was probated on 31 March 1723/4.

"In the Name of God Amen I John Prettyman Senr of this County of Susex being in Great misery of body but of Sound and perfect mind and Memory praise be therefore given to Almighty God do make and Ordain this my present Last will and Testament in manner and form Following that is to Say First and principally I commend my soul into the hands of Almighty God hoping Through the merrits death and passion of my Savour Jesus Christ to have full and free pardon and forgiveness of all my sins and to Inherit Everlasting Life and my body I Commit to the Earth to be decently buried at the Discreation of Executors hereafter named and as Touching the Dispossition of all Such Temporal Estate as it hath pleased Almighty God to bestow upon mee I Give and Dispose thereof as Followeth

In his will John did not mention his sons, Robert and Thomas, who died before he did. The will of Thomas Prettyman Sr made on 24 December 1719 and probated on 17 July 1719 mentions his brothers William, Robert and John Prettyman.138 Who is the grand daughter Ann West mentioned in John’s will? It appears that she could not be a daughter of one of John’s sons. We feel that she was probably the daughter of a deceased daughter of John.

Biography

"PRETTYMAN GENERATION ONE AND TWO:"[1]

JOHN (A-1) PRETTYMAN, [(Robert (B), Thomas (C), John (D), John (E), William (F), William (G), William (H), John (I)], chr. 1 Jan 1609/10 Branston, Lincolnshire, England; d bet 7 Mar 1688 and 21 Mar 1688 in Accomack Co., VA. m Mary____ (Unknown) No date given.

John Prettyman [Sr.] was in Maryland by 21 February 1638/9 and in Virginia by 31 August 1643. In Maryland he was on a trading voyage to Susquehannock Indians when his leadership saved the boat and men from destruction by the Susquehannocks. In Virginia he went on a trading trip to the Swedes in present day Delaware. He tried his hand at farming during the early years, but he was not very successful. On 10 March 1646, he was a witness to the will of Edward Ginkins in Northampton County, Virginia. On 25 May 1651 John Savage deeded to "John Prittiman" in Northampton County a cow and a bull calf, and the deed was filed on 23 November 1653.32 Witnesses to this deed were Samuel Sond and Robert Lingo. The next record of John according to Rev. Prettyman was when he witnessed the will of William Satham in court in 1657.

The area where John moved to in Virginia was the Eastern Shore. The first county on the Eastern Shore was established in 1634 as Accawmack County. The name was changed to Northampton in 1642/3. In 1663 the northern half was cut off to form Accomack County and Northampton then attained its present boundaries. The first tithables list for Northampton County in existence is the one for 1662 and John is on the list with no tithables listed. John is not on the lists of Northampton for 1663-1677. On 19 August 1665 in Northampton County, he served on the Inquisitions on Eschewed Land. John is on the 1663 tithables list for Accomack County, Virginia, with two tithables. In Accomack, he was sued by William Blake for stealing a sow, but the jury found him not guilty on 18 August 1663. "He was delinquent at muster of militia on 15 April 1664." On 18 October 1664, "Isaac Foxcroft complained that Major John Tilney had blocked the highway by Tilney’s little house by branch as was also sworn by Jeffrey Minshall and John Prettyman." "The Court ordered that Minshall, Prettyman and the surveyor investigate and have the road unblocked if necessary."

He [John] is on the 1664 to 1670 tithables list for Accomack County with one tithable In 1671, John again has two tithables. In 1674, he is listed with two tithables, and in 1675, as "John Prettiman Sr," he is listed with four tithables. In 1676, there is only listed a "Jon. Prettiman Jr," with one tithables, and also listed in 1676 with one tithable is William Prettiman. John Prettyman served on the Accomack grand jury on 20 April 1676. In 1677 John Prettiman is listed with three tithables. In 1678, only John Prettiman Jr with one tithable is listed. John Sr and William were still in Accomack County as in July 1679 the Court listed them as being delinquent in their tithables for 1678. "John Prettiman, Wm Aillworth and other inhabitants of Messengo complained against Tobias Bull for stopping and necessary."

He is on the 1664 to 1670 tithables list for Accomack County with one tithables In 1671, John again has two tithables. In 1674, he is listed with two tithables, and in 1675, as John. Prettiman Sr he is listed with four tithables. In 1676, there is only listed a Jon. Prettiman II, with one tithables, and also listed in 1676 with one tithable is William Prettiman. John Prettyman served on the Accomack grand jury on 20 April 1676. In 1677 John Prettiman is listed with three tithables. In 1678, only John Prettiman II with one tithable is listed. John Sr and William were still in Accomack County as in July 1679 the Court listed them as being delinquent in their tithables for 1678. "John Prettiman, Wm Aillworth and other inhabitants of Messengo complained against Tobias Bull for stopping and fencing the road or Church Path to the court on 16 April 1678.

In 1679, John Pretiman Sr, is listed with three tithables, and William Pretteman is listed with one tithable. In 1680 and 1681, John Sr and William Jr, are each listed with one tithable. In 1682, John is listed with two tithables, and in 1683 John Sr and John II are listed with one tithable each. In 1684, John Prettiman is listed with two tithables. In 1685 there is no Prettyman on the list. In 1686 John Pretteman is listed with one tithables. In 1687 there is no Prettyman on the list.

On 18 November 1671, as John Prettyman of Northampton County, Planter, he appointed Thomas Brown as his attorney to sell land. This deed by Prettyman was recorded in Accomack which was then known as Upper Northampton. Then on 16 February 1671/2 as John Prettyman, of Nassattox Creek in County of Northampton, he disposed of the land. It appears that John was living in Northampton County, but he was not as in 1670 due to conflicts in County Court the Governor of Virginia disbanded Accomack County and it was known as Upper Northampton until January 1673/4.

On 14 July 1681, Mary Raythwell [Wreathwell], widow and administratrix of William Raythwell [Wreathwell] sued John Prettiman, Sr. This suit was still active on 16 March 1681/82 when William Chace, who had married the widow, was the administrator of the estate. On 18 August 1682, John Cole sued John Prettiman but a nonsuit was granted against Cole and he had to pay the court costs. Then on 21 Feb 1682/3, John Prettiman admitted owing 2000 pounds of tobacco to John Barnes, and the court ordered that Prettiman pay the debt and court costs. John was selected on 15 June 1683 to serve on the Accomack County Grand Jury for the following year.

William Sevens sued John Prettiman, Sr, on 14 November 1683 for 1600 pounds of tobacco, but Prettiman failed to appear, and if he did not appear at next court the sheriff would have to pay the debt. John Prettiman II, on 1 January 1683/4 appeared as bail and admitted judgment for the debt on behalf of John Prettiman, Sr, and it was ordered that Prettiman pay the debt and court costs. John Sr was served on 14 May 1683.

John Prettyman first acquired land on 4 September 1664 when as John Prittiman he patented (was granted) 200 acres being neck of land near the seaboard side in Accomack County for the transportation of Edward Kinastone, Joan Shaw, George Weld and Thomas Beck. The land was bordered on the west by a branch parting this from land of Major John Tilney and on the south by another branch parting this land from land of Thomas Bacon Sr. There is no record in Whitelaw of this land in the name of John Prettyman, and I have found no record of this land being sold. He patented (was granted) 200 acres at "Matchepungo" in Accomack County bordering lands of Thomas Browne, bounded on south by land of William Robinson and on north by land of Major John Tilney. He was granted this land as a result of transporting James Boone, John Kendall, Jane Shepard and Thomas Ayres.

It is also interesting that he transported individuals and was granted land but he never used his own headright and there has been found no record that someone else used his headright. John showed some of the same characteristics as he had in Maryland when on 17 January 1665/6 he was delinquent in Accomack County to Timothy Coe surveyor, and also like John of Maryland he signed his name to the 1671 power of attorney. This debt was apparently incurred for the survey of land John was granted on 5 April 1666 in Accomack County. This land per Whitelaw was in Northampton County, but when Thomas Browne as attorney for John Prettyman, Planter, sold the land to Richard Hinman the transaction is recorded in the Accomack County Court Orders on 17 November 1671. Witnesses to the deed were John Michael, John Hudson, and Nicholas Lawrence. The land was bordered by Major John Tilney and Thomas Bacon, and Major Tilney purchased the land from Hinman on 24 November 1671. The land was north of Nassawadox and between Greens Creek and Upshur Creek on the east coast of the Eastern Shore. In 1665 John acquired 400 acres of land from Daniel Quillon and his wife Lidia in Northampton. This land was also north of Nassawadox and southwest of the 1665/66 tract of land.

In 1671 John Prettiman Sr. and his wife: Mary (Unknown) Prettyman, sold this 400 acres to George Dewey. This land was west of Franktown and was on the west coast of the Eastern Shore. On 17 Nov 1671, John acquired 500 acres in Northampton from Richard Hinman. Witnesses to the deed were Jacob Hill and Wm Collins. On 16 Jan 1671/72, as John Prettyman of Nasswattux sold 100 acres of this land to Thomas Browne and witnesses to the deed were Andrew Andrews and George Brickhouse; in 1674, as John Prettyman of Accomack County, he sold the remaining 400 acres to Thomas Teackle.

Witnesses to this deed were Jacob Abraham, John Tankard and Laurence Tiege{?}. Neighbors of John near these three tracts of land were William Kendall, Thomas Bell, Thomas Browne, Thomas Gittings, Philip Fisher, Richard and John Hinman, John Michael Jr, Daniel Foxcroft, John Hudson, William Roberts, William Smith, Major John Tilney, and Hugh Yeo. John’s neighbor, William Kendall, in 1689 and 1694, sold some of his land near John to Peter and Mary Grice. Mary Grice was the daughter of Henry Stott. Henry Stott’s daughter, Frances, married Morgan Williams. It was on Morgan Williams plantation that some of John’s cattle were being kept when he died.

Also in 1671 John Prettyman of Northampton County purchased 450 acres in Northampton County from John Hudson. Witnesses to this deed were Thomas Browne and Wm Anderson. This land had been sold by Thomas Gittins to Daniel Foxcroft who sold it to John Hudson. This land was north of Nassawadox, and it bordered land formerly belonging to Stephen Carleton, Lt. Colonel Tilney and Daniel Quillons. This land also bordered 1664 patent land and land purchased from Daniel Quillon. This land was also just south of the land "Federal Island" that John Green leased from Colonel William Kendall. It was on this leased land of Greene’s that part of John’s cattle were being kept at John’s death. Additional neighbors of John when he purchased this land were Josias Cowdry, Henry Stott, John Tankard, Phillip Fisher, Henry White, Morgan Dowell, John Crewe, Christopher Kirke and Edmund Kelly.

In 1683, John Prettyman II, as attorney for his father of "Messongo," sold the 450 acres to Thomas Barton. On 4 January 1677, Robert and Elizabeth Brecy sold to John Prettyman, Sr 750 acres of land in Accomack County on Messongo Creek. Witnesses to this deed was Edward Moore, Jr. and John Prittiman, Jr, and both signed their name, 6 March 1679/80, as John Prettiman, Planter, he sold this tract of land to John Michael Jr., and John signed his name: John Pretiman Junior and Jno Spick witnessed the deed, and it was proven in court on 2 August 1680 by John Prettiman Sr., and John Michael’s was married to Alice Tilney, daughter of John Tilney. Apparently John Michael had not paid for this land in 1684/5 as John had him arrested for debt on 4 March 1684/5.

John was known as John Prettyman of Messongo, but it appears that he only owned this land for two years. His son, John II's, activities seem to indicate that John II did live in Messongo area. The frequent land transactions by John Prettyman Sr. give the impression that he may have made a living more by buying and selling land than he did at farming. This may have meant that he was not very skilled at farming, just like John Prettyman of Maryland. We can see from the above that in 1671 he purchased 950 acres of land and sold 300 acres. It is apparent from records that John had sold his land on Messongo in 1679, but apparently continued to live in the area. He still owned land in Northampton County until 1683, but he and his son, John, from the records did not own land from 1683 to 1690.

John Prettyman Sr. died between 7 and 24 March 1687/8 as he made his will on 7 March 1687/8 and it was probated on 24 March 1687/8. His will stated:

"One Cow and calf, one mare, one fold and two pigs and 10 bushell Indian corn and a gun one cow and calf at John cobs [Cobbs], at Giles Cokes one cow, one cattle pot, one ax, one hatchet and that little pott is for the use of Mary Grice and likewise all the triffling things that I have at my at my landlord Thompson."

Witnesses to the will were William Jones and Samuel Benton. John had a daughter as the court records, on 7 October 1675, state there was a difference between Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Prettyman about accounts that is referred till 3rd day of next General Court; and then the court ordered that Mr. Prettyman make oath the goods his daughter had was upon credit and that she demand the same. It appears that Mary Grice mentioned in the will may have been the daughter of John but the will of Henry Stott shows that his daughter, Mary Stott, married Peter Grice.

John Prettyman II petitioned the court to be appointed administrator of his father’s estate on 2 April 1688, and he was appointed administrator with Henry Williams and Thomas Stockley as his securities. It appears from the will that John was living at Robert Thompson’s at the time he made his will. As Robert Thompson sued John Prettyman II, as the administrator of the estate, and John II, as administrator, sued Robert Thompson.

The suit by Thompson was dismissed on 21 December 1688 since there was no cause of action. It is also apparent from court case against John II that some of John Sr’s cattle were in Northampton County at John Greene’s and Morgan Williams' pastures. It appears that John Greene lived just south of Willis Wharf on seaboard in Northampton County.

John PRETTYMAN's Family:

Wife: Mary (Unknown) Prettyman

Married: About 1650 in Northampton, Virginia

3 Children:

John Prettyman II, b: ca. 1653 Northampton Co., VA; m. 1st: Mary (Unknown) Prettyman; married 2nd: Mary (Williams) Prettyman, widow Marriner

Unknown Daughter Prettyman, b: ca. 1656 m. Unknown

William Prettyman, b: ca. 1659 Northampton Co., Virginia

William is on the tithables lists of Accomack County. On 6 July 1680, he was a witness to the will of Griffith Savage. He was in court on 18 November 1681 having apprehended Mary Raiswell’s servant Thomas Sexton and Bridget Savage’s servant named Abel Robinson. He is mentioned again on 16 December 1681 as having planted two acres. After 1681, he is not on the tithables list which suggests he may have died.[2]

Prettymans of Delmarva by D. Mitchell Jones

I think John, son of Robert Prettyman, is the John Prettyman of Maryland and Virginia for the following reasons:

1. Proper age-no other documented John within proper age group.

2. They used spelling of Prettyman instead of normal English Pretyman on Parish Records.

3. His father is said to have died in poverty so he would welcome the opportunity to increase his fortune in the New World.

4. He came from land holding lesser gentry so would want to own land, and would have some education.

5. He would be familiar with military as the family had some military background, i.e. his grandfather, Thomas Pratyman, supported the cause against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and his family held land as Knights service to the King.

6. Association with Cornwallis family in Suffolk, England and Maryland. i.e. his great-grandfather, John Pratyman of Bacton, Suffolk, held land from Sir Thomas Cornwallis.(Inquisition on death John Pretyman 1559, pgs 286-287 Vol II Suffolk Manorial Families.) Also possible association with John Baxter, one of the gentleman adventurers in settling the colony of Maryland, as his Aunt, Mary Pratyman (Will Rachel Pretyman) married ______ Baxter.

7. Lineage uses common first names of Prettymans in Delaware, i.e. John, William, Robert & Thomas.

8. I feel he is the grandson mentioned in Rachel Pretyman's will 1626(Arch. Sudb. Register 1627 folio 2).

About Thomas Pratyman

THOMAS PRATYMAN

Muskett stated that Thomas submitted in 1588 to defence against Armada. On 9 April 1601, the inquisition on the death of Thomas Pretyman, yeoman, was held. "He held a close called "Ashemans", containing sixty acres in Gislingham; two messuages, two cotages, four gardens, sixty acres of land, twenty acres of meadow, one hundred twenty acres of pasture and four acres of wood in Bacton, Coton and Newton." By charter, dated 8 September 1600, he enfeoffed John Pretyman of Heasley, gent., and Thomas Harwel of Felsham, gent. (lands & tenements already conveyed to Fyrmin Denny, Esquire & John Pretyman, gent. being excepted) in Ashemans in Gislingham to his own use for life, and then to his heir of his body begotten; and, failing such heir, to the use of Robert Pretyman, his second son & heir of his body begotten; and failing such heir to these to John Pretyman his third son & the heirs of his body, and for lack of such, to his own use and that of his right heirs for ever.
