Knowledge graphs $G$ are represented as a collection of triples $\{(h, r, t)\}\subseteq E\times R\times E$, where $E$ and $R$ are the entity set and relation set. The task of Knowledge Graph Completion is to either predict unseen relations $r$ between two existing entities: $(h, ?, t)$ or predict the tail entity $t$ given the head entity and the query relation: $(h, r, ?)$.
