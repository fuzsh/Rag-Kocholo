My Question or Issue

I am on google as an artist here is my knowledge graph-

But only my youtube and deezer account appear which is odd because i am also on Spotify

So how do i add my Spotify to the google knowledge graph? or better yet if an admin knows suggest the edit to google for me, please get my spotify linked it will make my Spotify easier to search. Like when all someone needs to do is type my name into google and see the spotify attached to the knowledge graph.

Solved! Go to Solution.

I did but the devs over at Google told me it's spotify who is the only one's who can do it for me.

And to refer them to this

https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/

I had a similar issue, but just got the message below from Spotify. They are not incredibly helpful. Back to square one. Would appreciate any advice or feedback.

Thanks for reaching out.

It’s currently not possible to link your Spotify artist profile to your Google API key.

Our product teams are always looking at new ways to improve the artist experience on Spotify.

We can’t make any promises, but we really appreciate your feedback on this.

We recommend getting in touch with Google. They're the best folks to help!

If there's anything else, Just shout.

Take care,

Rohan

Now I am mystified.... Why would they help one user, and not help another one with precisely the same issue? Especially since Google refers me to them.

I just wrote to Spotify Artist Support team again, hopefully this time around they'll be able to help out.
