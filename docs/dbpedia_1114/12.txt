Concerning the repetition: Lines that repeat should be performed with the same inflection and tone each time – these are not characters repeating the same lines because other characters are not understanding them, these lines are being spun back and replayed, spun back and replayed, spun back and replayed, spun back, spun back, spun, spun, spun and replayed by Selector.

The Drowsy Chaperone is a musical with book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar and music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert andGreg Morrison. It is a parody of American musical comedy of the 1920s. The story concerns a middle-aged, asocial musical theatre fan; as he plays the record of his favorite musical, the (fictional) 1928 hit The Drowsy Chaperone, the show comes to life onstage as he comments on the music, story, and actors.

During the act one finale, the musical theatre fan accidentally bumps the record player, causing the performers, music, and dance to repeat. Below are a few examples of this moment.
