And so, what better way to entertain ourselves than by watching television all day. And for the first time, I watched enough TV this year that I finally have enough entries to put a list together!\n\nThese are the 10 best series of television (that I watched) from 2020. Entries need to have premiered this year, and presented as a season. So anything that has a 2020 release date, you’re in the running.\n\nAs a bonus, I also have included some TV shows that did not premiere this year, but I finally got around to finishing this year. Just so you can laugh at me for missing out on these shows the first time around.\n\nNow, I’m not gonna lie, you’re probably going to see a lot of Netflix on this list. It’s the one streaming service I have access to that is fully funded by me, and I’m too afraid to ask the people who own the Hulu, Prime, and HBO Max accounts if I can watch a series on those sites. That, and Netflix is just better when it comes to TV, in my opinion. Those other sites might have one or two good shows, but there are PLENTY on Netflix.\n\nBy the way, MAJOR spoilers ahead, if you haven't seen any of these yet.\n\nHere's some stuff I watched that didn't come out this year, but I certainly enjoyed myself watching this ​year:\n\n​\n\nThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\n\nI have to admit, I enjoyed The People vs. OJ Simpson better than I enjoyed The Assassination of Gianni Versace. But that is not to say that the miniseries (another Ryan Murphy creation) is bad. Darren Criss’ role as Andrew Cunanan is a masterful portrayal of a man with nothing left to lose. It’s a sad, sad story.\n\nEpisode highlights include “A Random Killing,” where Cunanan encounters Lee Miglin, and we get an excellent performance from his wife, played by Judith Light; “House by the Lake,” where a prolonged road trip yields devastating results, and “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” where we get two very different coming out stories. By the end, whether they like it or not, Versace and Cunanan are inextricably linked.\n\n​\n\nOver the Garden Wall​\n\nHow did I NOT know about this show prior to this year? I loved it so much, I even went as Wirt for Halloween. Cartoon Network’s 2015 miniseries follows Wirt (Elijah Wood) and Greg (Collin Dean) in their quest to get home. Along they way, they travel through a vast forest, encountering many odd creatures along the way, including a woodsman (voiced by Christopher Lloyd) and Beatrice, a bluebird (Melanie Lynskey) who helps them to find a woman called Adelaide who can help the boys find their way home.\n\nYa boy as Wirt.\n\nWhat struck me first about Over the Garden Wall is the overall aesthetic, in particular the animation style and the score. Visually, it resembles shows like The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack and Adventure Time, while also evoking early 20th century Americana, especially with its title cards. In addition, the score and soundtrack (written by The Blasting Company) gives this world (known as, well, the Unknown) the same sort of feeling. The show, early on, for me, was bordering on this line of both whimsical and creepy.\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, you start to feel this connection to the characters, right before the show hits you with an incredible twist, revealing just why and how the boys ended up in the Unknown. All of this culminates in a satisfying ending of not only saving the ones you love, but also how perseverance and being helpful (albeit unwittingly in some cases), can positively affect the lives of others you encounter.\n\nThe episodes are 10 minutes long, and there are 10 of them. You’ll be done in an hour and a half. Do yourself a favor and watch this show.\n\n​\n\nInfinity Train ​(Seasons 1 & 2)\n\nSpeaking of a show whose episodes are 10 minutes long (and also an animated series), look no further than Infinity Train. I saw the pilot episode for this show back in 2017, and when I went back to look it up out of curiosity this year, the show had put out two seasons, with a third premiering this year on HBO Max.\n\nPicture a girl on a train. Why is she there? Where is the train going and why is it so long? And why does she have this glowing green number on her hand? Infinity Train is an excellent mini-mystery series at the outset, but it also addresses issues in a way that is accessible to children. Main character Tulip (Ashley Johnson) wrestles with the effects of her parents’ divorce as she tries to figure out a way to get off the train. While on the train, she encounters a number of challenges which force her to think of ways to solve the puzzle, often forcing her to think introspectively.\n\nBook 2 two revealed that the show was an anthology series, picking up the character of Mirror Tulip (a mirror version of Tulip introduced in an episode of season one also voiced by Johnson), and her adventures aboard the train. She meets Jesse (Robbie Draymond), a boy from the real world who’s been brought onto the train to endure the same trials Tulip did. MT grapples with wanting to leave the train with Jesse, but since she is a denizen of the train, it may be impossible for her to leave.\n\nI love a good anthology series where all the parts and characters connect to each other, especially if it’s a larger “why am I here/what is this place?” narrative. Similarly, when a children’s cartoon introduces subjects about personal growth, it’s always a win. I haven’t gotten around to it yet, but I’m very excited to see what season three holds.\n\n​\n\nCommunity (Seasons 1-6)\n\nWhat can I say? Community is one the best shows of all time. Quick-witted. Meta. Absurd. Heartfelt. And believe it or not, though I’d seen the ending before, I found there were gaps in my viewing, so I’m counting this as finishing a full season of television in 2020.\n\nPlus, it gives me a chance to talk about the show.\n\nFirst, the cast. Joel McHale. Gillian Jacobs. Allison Brie. Danny Pudi. Donald Glover. Yvette Nicole Brown. Chevy Chase. Ken Jeong. Jim Rash. And even though half of them were gone by the end (namely Glover, Chase, and Brown), the show made it work. Maybe not in season four once Dan Harmon left, but definitely in seasons five and six, as cast members like Paget Brewster, Jonathan Banks, John Oliver and Keith David filled in nicely and served their purposes by the end of the show.\n\nSome favorites episodes of mine:\n\nThe Paintball Episodes (Modern Warfare, A Fistful of Paintballs, A Few Paintballs More, Modern Espionage)- References to war films, westerns, and Star Wars. Plus, an element of combat and some of the best storytelling in the series. What’s not to love?\n\n“Epidemiology”- Zombie movie + LOTS and LOTS of ABBA music.\n\n“Cooperative Polygraphy”- What starts as a polygraph test of the study group to allow Pierce to get his last words in ends up taking JUST A FEW twists and turns that has a fulfilling, if not bittersweet, ending. Plus, Walton Goggins!\n\n“Remedial Chaos Theory”- One of the more meta episodes of the series. Can rolling a die actually create alternate dimensions? Oh well. Something for your brain to chew on. I wonder how those other timelines are doing.\n\nAnd now, a look at the best TV I consumed this year.\n\n​\n\n10. Space Force (Season 1)\n\nSpace Force is an interesting show- and though it’s been renewed for season two, I’m not entirely sure what the future holds. For one thing, we’re going to have a new President come January, and I’m not entirely sure how the dynamic will change in regards to the shadow of the Trump-like POTUS that oversees the action of (in this case, the semi-fictional world of) Space Force, a department that he created. So will the show address this? At this point, we’re not sure.\n\nFor another, the show has its moments of both humor and poignancy, and we’ve been left with a lot of questions that need answering. How did Maggie Naird (Lisa Kudrow) end up in prison? What will Gen. Mark Naird’s (Steve Carell) do in response to the Chinese astronauts trashing the American astronauts’ moon base? And, in an interesting twist I did not anticipate caring about, what will be the status of the relationship between Angela (Tawny Newsome) and Chan (Jimmy O. Yang)? And will we see more parodies of currently congresspeople, namely Representative Pitosi, Senator Schugler, and Anabela Ysidro-Campos (plays on Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and AOC, respectively)?\n\nSpeaking of parodies of government people- Ben Schwartz’s character, F. Tony Scarapiducci, is a play on Anthony Scaramucci (Trump’s Director of Communication for all of 12 days). He is referred to (even by himself) throughout the series as “Fuck Tony”. So there’s that little nugget for ya.\n\nQuestions aside, the series isn’t terrible, and the actors do a fine job for some of the material they’ve been given. The dialogue (which I think could be construed as boring otherwise) is elevated by the performances of the likes of Carell and John Malkovich, the latter of the two is the SOLE reason you should watch the show.\n\nMalkovich’s character, Dr. Adrian Mallory, is the only competent person working in Space Force. That much is clear from the outset. Mallory takes orders from no one, least of all Naird, and plays by his own ambiguous rules, but always acting for the good in the name of science, exploration, and, I’m sure on a deeper level, the people. But both his eloquence and his outbursts are quintessentially Malkovich-ian, seen mostly in the various ways he destroys the idiots around him trying to tell him what to do, ranging from Sorkin-levels of monologuing to Scorsese-levels of cursing, all of which are enough to rival an enigmatic figure like Nicolas Cage. It’s all there, and it’s all brilliant.\n\nOverall, I think Space Force leaves a lot to be desired, but, like space, we still have much to explore. And I hope it only gets more exciting from here.\n\n​\n\n9. Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness\n\nThis one came in the early days of quarantine, when no one was sure exactly what to do with themselves. Enter: Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness, which took over Netflix when it premiered back in late March.\n\nDoes anyone remember what this show was even about? Or are we all still obsessed with Carole Baskin supposedly feeding her ex-husband to the tigers she keeps at her wildlife rescue preserve? Don’t forget, the real story revolves around Joe Exotic, the eccentric owner of the G.W. Zoo in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, and his feud with Ms. Baskin, which culminates in a murder-for-hire plot that landed Mr. Exotic in prison (where he is currently serving a 22 year sentence). Like, remember all the crazy shit that happens in this series? Remember Doc Antle? The guy who also runs a wildlife sanctuary… that was also some weird personality cult full of women who had to, like, worship the guy? And what about poor Rick Kirkham, who ends up running Joe Exotic TV, only to have Joe (or one of his associates) literally burn all of his footage because Joe found out he wasn’t in control of it? And then Jeff Lowe, a seedy Las Vegas playboy that Joe turns his zoo over to for legal reasons? Pretty sure this is the part where we got the legendary line: “I’m never going to financially recover from this,” wherein one of the tigers attacks a G.W. Zoo employee. And Joe’s three-way same-sex relationship with Travis and John? Oh! And Joe ran for President (of all things) in 2016, and Governor of Oklahoma in 2018- where it’s revealed that a cameraman of his actually became his campaign manager! ALL of this happened in a seven-episode docuseries.\n\nAnd then there was the whole murder-for-hire thing. Right. And it also goes without mentioning that the series implies that the animals are not treated well, and that it boils down to politics between two humans that only want to ruin each other, without any consideration for the other living beings they have come to be in charge of.\n\nI’m scratching just the tip of the iceberg about Tiger King, but this series is a microcosm of the insanity that is this quarantine. It’s a trip, and with each turn, you don’t know how you ended up where you are, or where or when you started, but you’re here now, and this is reality. Cheers to Tiger King for holding up the mirror to society, in a weird, sleazy, furry kind of way.\n\n​\n\n8. Big Mouth (Season 4)\n\nBig Mouth returned for its fourth season better than ever, packed with some cringey, gross-out moments we haven’t seen the likes of since the first season, and picking up where it left off in terms of its powerful statements about growing older and trying to figure yourself out.\n\nThe theme of this season is very much “anxiety, fuck yeah!,” where just about every character deals with some sort of stress. First is Nick (Nick Kroll), who fears that he will be replaced by both Seth (Seth Rogen- his camp best friend) and Andrew (John Mulaney- his school best friend), as the latter two hit it off during the summer. Elsewhere, the show deals with identity, particularly with Missy (Jenny Slate, and later, Ayo Edebiri), as she wrestles with embracing her Black identity and “growing up white”- the show is so meta about it that it nods to Missy being voiced by a white actor multiple times throughout the season, until Slate gives way to Edebiri in the penultimate episode, where Missy meets “Mosaic Missy,” with Edebiri permanently becoming the voice of the character. The focus of the series shifts back to Nick, as we get a glimpse into his future, where he eventually turns into Nick Starr, a successful but pompous and isolated gameshow host, whose entire life has been shaped by Nick pushing away his friends. We get this GREAT narrative of how just because you’re the way you are now, doesn’t mean you can’t change, especially when you’re only in eighth grade.\n\nJessi (Jessi Klein), in addition to learning more about menstrual cycles and becoming a woman, also deals with the stress of going to a new school and managing her depression- eventually, we meet the Gratitoad (Zach Galifianakis), who teaches Jessi about being grateful for things in her life, and teaches me about who my new favorite character is. Andrew, meanwhile, is his typical cringey self, dealing with issues from constipation to masturbation. Matthew (Andrew Rannells) struggles with coming out to both of his parents, all while Jay (Jason Mantzoukas) and Lola (Kroll) have… the best relationship the series has ever seen? We also get some interesting miniature arcs throughout the season, notably Natalie, a camper who has transitioned at the start of the season, and even Coach Steve, who shares his birthday with a particularly sad day.\n\nNot that Big Mouth was ever bad, but I’m happy it’s done a return-to-form for season 4. I haven’t had to cover my face when a prolonged and gross sequence occurred since the first or second season (the main one I speak of is in episode 3. Let’s call it the “giving birth” sequence for ambiguity purposes), and I… missed that, if that’s not weird to say. Furthermore, I have been so impressed with the show’s ability to reflect the obstacles that teenagers face when growing up. Anxiety, depression, sexuality, identity, and even things like divorce, are all things real kids face. Props to the show for facing the issues head on and making the kids relatable to even adults.\n\n​\n\n7. The Politician (Season 2)\n\nThis season of The Politician spread its wings in the only way a Ryan Murphy sitcom could, by taking, quite literally, the entire country, in its scope. Also, Bette Midler’s in it. This show is a version of Glee where the only difference is that it’s slightly more rooted in reality. But only slightly. Notice how I didn’t say there’s no singing in The Politician.\n\nMoving away from the small-town student leadership role of season 1, season 2 lands us in the middle of New York City, where Payton Hobart (Ben Platt) has just declared his candidacy for New York State Senate, a position held by longtime incumbent, Dede Standish (Judith Light). Meanwhile, his mother, Georgina (Gwyneth Paltrow) is headlong into a campaign to be Governor of California.\n\nThis season of the show really felt like it was starting to become something other than a rich-kid teen drama. The bright colors, lit by the backdrop of a bright, sunny California, are replaced by a colder, steelier atmosphere of New York City. And despite the triviality of some of the feuds between members of Payton’s campaign team, the goal remains the same: get their boy in the room.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about this season was the seamless shift of character focus that makes total sense. Out goes Jessica Lange and in comes Bette Midler as Hadassah Gold, Dede’s Chief of Staff. Bette is right at home in the role, and plays the mousy Chief of Staff role to perfection, while also showing us vulnerability after getting caught up in Dede’s three-way-marital affairs… I mean, “throuple.” (This show is one Matthew Morrison or Lea Michele appearance away from being Glee, I swear to you.)\n\nNaturally, as Infinity Jackson (Zoey Deutch) is free from her grandmother’s clutches (remember that whole “playing off of The Act” from Hulu thing from last season), she goes off to pursue her career as a writer and later environmental activist, and naturally we see her less frequently. Of course, Infinity ends up helping Payton once again… before becoming a thorn in his side (see: throwing a ballot box into the East River) once again.\n\nEven the members of Payton’s inner circle, McAfee (Laura Dreyfuss), James (Theo Germaine), Skye (Rahne Jones), Astrid (Lucy Boynton) and Alice (Julia Schlaepfer) have their moments too. Take, for example, Astrid and Alice fleeing to a hippy farm and supporting each other at a camp for expectant mothers (shoutout my former roommate Lizzy Jutila), or the little “what are YOU doing here” moment that was film at the theatre I used to work at.\n\nAnd finally, we get (although the moments are fewer this season, they’re definitely earned) some brief but meaningful moments between Payton and his visions of River, who died at the start of season one.\n\nOverall, the show feels more grown up in season two, and has a more lighthearted take on a grueling political campaign. The Politician shows us the relationship between both younger and older votes (see: “The Voters”), and how even though they may come from different backgrounds and grew up with different rules, they’re not so different when it boils right down to it. I’m not sure if there’s a season three in the works yet (and truthfully, I’d be fine if it didn’t- the ending to season two was a solid enough ending for me), but it will certainly be interesting to see where the show goes from here, should they decide to move up in the world. This is what House of Cards was missing. You have to start small and work your way up an enormous ladder to get all the way to the top. Perhaps Beau Willimon should have thought of putting his characters in a high school class president race first. Oh well. This show is ridiculous. And I absolutely love it.\n\n​\n\n6. Ted Lasso ​(Season 1)\n\nAnd now for something completely different- a series from… Apple TV+? I remember all the NBC Sports vignettes from 2013 about a college football coach helming an English Premier League team, played by Jason Sudeikis. And since I got my new iPhone (shoutout to iPhone), with it came a free year of Apple TV+. And that, kids, is how I met your soccer coach. I mean Ted Lasso.\n\nBut seriously. I was expecting a comedy about a guy who was out of his element and didn’t know the first thing about soccer, and finding his way in England. That’s essentially what Ted Lasso is about, but I didn’t expect everything else that came with it.\n\nIn the NBC vignettes, the team in question is Tottenham Hotspur. In the series, it’s AFC Richmond, who are a bottom-feeding team in the EPL, seemingly destined for relegation. But, why a college football coach? The answer is revealed very early on, as the team’s owner, Rebecca Welton (Hannah Waddingham) is left in charge of the team after her divorce from her husband (Anthony Head). In order to get back at her cheating ex-spouse by destroying the one thing she cares about, she hires Lasso in an attempt to ruin the team. Lasso’s folksy Americanism makes him come off as a rube in the first few episodes, but he eventually wins over both the owner and the team, not to mention its players, including the wily but blunt veteran Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein).\n\nThe best part about the show is that it’s funny without being low-brow. And for that reason, it is a genuinely heartwarming series. You could go so many ways with both the premise and the character of Ted Lasso, but his character just cares so deeply about people that you just can’t help but root for him. Lasso goes through a divorce during the course of the show- an unexpected twist- and he struggles with having to keep a brave face in front of his son from across the pond, despite the fact that he very much still loves his wife and having to end their marriage is tearing him up inside. His relationship with other characters in the show is always serious, but always with the most positive intentions, and it ends up being infectious toward the others around him- whether it be a reporter who is incredibly skeptical of Lasso’s presence in the EPL and is fully prepared to ruin him in the press, to Kent, who deals with relationship issues involving another Richmond ex-player, to even Welton herself, who is coming to terms with her divorce and how it’s affecting her. Lasso has this happy-go-lucky energy about him, but despite being a fish out of water, he knows what he’s about and is much smarter than he looks.\n\nThis show is, in my mind, the most underrated show on this list. The comedy is incredibly witty and the themes are relatable. The story has its twists and turns that leaves you wanting more (and more we shall have- the show was renewed for two more seasons already). The music is amazing- which was put together by Marcus Mumford of all people. If you take the plunge on Apple TV+, make this the first show you check out. Take a few hours out of your day and root for the little guy. Trust me, it’s worth it.\n\n​\n\n5. Sex Education​ (Series 2)\n\nIt doesn’t matter who gets introduced in Sex Education, I just want the best for every single one of them, because they all deserve it. The British sitcom returned for series two, and it picks up on the single lingering question from series one- just what will Otis do now that he can finally masturbate?\n\nDo it literally everywhere, is the answer to that one, much to the horror of his mother Jean (Gillian Anderson).\n\nBut more than that, season two delves deeper into the relationships between the characters at Moordale High, and reaches new emotional (and relevant) depths than ever before. But, before all that can even happen, naturally a chlamydia outbreak sets us back on the path of Otis (Asa Butterfield) and Maeve (Emma Mackey) back on the sex clinic trail.\n\nAs is a common theme throughout this list, Sex Education features more amazing character development and story arcs, with a number of them being some of the most indelible images of television from this year.\n\nI can’t talk to anyone about the show without first bringing up the Aimee (Aimee Lou Wood) story arc, which begins with a man ejaculating on her on a bus. While her reaction to the sexual assault (a shrug-off and downplaying Maeve’s intent on reporting it) feels initially set up to be a one-time thing, we find that it has more of an effect on Aimee than she anticipated. Instead, we get this amazing four-to-five episode arc of the impact it has on her life, from distancing herself from her boyfriend, to a detention session with Maeve and five other female characters from the show, wherein they discuss their separate experience with unwanted sexual harassment (later on, they destroy a car!), leading to a powerful and emotional scene where Aimee’s friends ride the bus with her, telling her that they have her back.\n\nThere is SO much to unpack in this season. Maeve’s struggle with her drug-using mother and her newfound friendship (friendship?) with neighbor Isaac; The saga of Jean as the school’s sex educator, which draws the ire of Headmaster Groff; Jackson struggling with the pressure his mothers force on him to excel in the swimming pool; and, of course, Romeo and Juliet: the musical.\n\nRelationships fall out and new ones bloom. We get more of Ola and Lily, and Jackson and Viv, as well as a complicated love triangle between Eric, Rahim and Adam. It’s all so good. And we watch these characters grow up as they come into themselves (and sometimes, each other!)\n\nFinally, there’s Otis, who gets into a lot of trouble (see: the episode with the party), but we see him grow up so much throughout the season, particularly in the aftermath of said party episode, where he has a mini pregnancy-scare arc with popular girl Ruby. He realizes the error of his father’s ways and how much of an asshole he can be, and also finally confesses his love to Maeve… via voicemail, which is, I’m sure, where season three will pick up.\n\nAgain, a show featuring the horniest teenagers on Netflix may not be everyone’s cup of tea. But what the show does best is make us realize that sex can sometimes seem like the most serious thing and the silliest thing at the same time. It’s often the physical comedy paired with the reactions of certain characters that make Sex Education truly funny (see: the S2 premiere where Jean catches Otis masturbating in the car while she’s returning from an errand) without being overly gross. It’s awkward but doesn’t induce second-hand embarrassment- it’s just all a part of growing up.\n\n​\n\n​4. The Mandalorian​ (Season 2)\n\nI don’t remember if I said it on this blog or not, but I have previously stated somewhere in my life that Disney was perhaps the best thing to ever happen to the Star Wars franchise. After seeing The Rise of Skywalker, and watching it tear down everything they had built in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi in exchange for woefully obvious fan service, I had to rethink my stance. Maybe Disney’s involvement in the saga wasn’t the best thing, after all. In the age of social media, nothing can ever be what it is anymore- it has to serve or relate to someone or something. Did Disney… ruin Star Wars for me? For the better part of 10 months, I wasn’t sure of anything anymore.\n\nBut then the second season of The Mandalorian came out. Everyone’s favorite space dad and the brilliant, caring creative minds that crafted his story reminded me once again why I love this story- and this franchise- so much. Tasked with bringing The Child (or, as we now know him, Grogu) back to his kind, the second season picks up right where the first season left off. While the first half of the season sticks very much to its “space errands” formula, the major plot lines are never forgotten about, and carefully crafted to make sure that super important things, like the re-introduction of some familiar faces (Rosario Dawson and Temeura Morrison, for example), have their place in contributing to the main goal of the series. In what might be perceived as an ambitious move for the series, creator Jon Favreau has also masterfully weaved in characters and subplots from other places in the Star Wars catalogue (even including things thought to not be canon in the first place) and officially making them part of the “canon” of the series. He does it without it ever feeling forced. It feels earned. And because Mando is able to shift away from each of these things he encounters with every passing episode, the series doesn’t dwell on them for too long- leaving us always wanting to know what’s next.\n\nStepping away from plot devices, let’s talk about the TEAM behind this. Favreau has once again gathered a crack team of directors to tell each episodic story, and each one encapsulates both their particular directing style- and the mood of the franchise- perfectly. Dave Filoni (of Clone Wars notoriety), gives us “The Jedi,” which is set up like a suspense thriller in a desolate forest. Robert Rodriguez gives us one of the best action sequences in the series with “The Tragedy.” Bryce Dallas Howard with “The Heiress” proves she has more of a grasp on this series than her father ever could- and delivers some of the juiciest plot points of the series in her 36-minute episode. Peyton Reed brings us “The Passenger,” which lands us on desolate ice planet Maldo Kries, not to mention some giant spiders and tons of despair.\n\nThis series is breathtaking, both in its artistic and plot development, as well the sheer gravitas of the names attached to it. There are guest roles from Timothy Olymphant, Katee Sackhoff (reprising her role as Bo-Katan from Clone Wars and Rebels), WWE wrestler Sasha Banks (!!!), and Bill Burr, among others. Directors like Peyton Reed, Carl Weathers, and Rick Famuyiwa add their specific tastes to the series as well. Season two is even more evidence that The Mandalorian is put together by people who deeply care about Star Wars. They want the best for it; they want it to be reminiscent of the series they grew up with, while also keeping in mind what has been established already, while giving us a fresh storyline that is a breath of fresh air. I’m not sure about what’s going to happen in the future with all these new Disney+ shows that are coming out, but I can only hope they’ll be as good as this one, which is, in my opinion, the next great TV space western series. I hope you enjoyed this literal essay on what makes Star Wars great.\n\n​\n\n3. Bojack Horseman (Season 6, Part 2)\n\nHow do I top The Mandalorian? With a cartoon horse and TONS of despair, that’s how!\n\nEveryone’s favorite washed-up, trainwreck anthropomorphic horse returns for the second half of his final season on Netflix. When we left Bojack in October of 2019, we were left with the episode “A Quick One, While He’s Away,” where, just as it appears Bojack is beginning to reconnect with loved ones and potentially turn his life around, we see an episode featuring none of the five main characters- as we see the ripple effect Bojack’s actions have had on everyone around him, ending with his half-sister, Hollyhock, discovering Bojack’s near-encounter with Penny and Charlotte back in New Mexico, as well as reporters nearing the verge of the truth about Sarah Lynn’s death (as well as Bojack’s involvement).\n\nAnd we were left with THAT cliffhanger for almost four months.\n\nPart 2 sees Bojack begin a professorship at Wesleyan, where, although he tries his best, ends up watching his relationship with Hollyhock dissipate. This is in no small part to the issues we were reminded of in “A Quick One, While He’s Away,” closing in around him. As his past catches up to him, we see him making an attempt at reconciliation with his actions, but, in true Bojack form, sometimes you can’t get out of your own way enough. After a softball interview about the instance in New Mexico and his involvement in Sarah Lynn’s death, Bojack gives into his own hubris for a second interview, and botches it, becoming the most reviled celebrity in all of Hollywoo. One thing leads to another, and without his support system (we’ll get to why that might not be the worst thing), we (nearly) see Bojack tumbling down a hole we can’t follow him into.\n\nAs such, the penultimate episode, “The View from Halfway Down” might be one of the best episodes of television from this year. I can’t even bring myself to describe that acid trip of an episode, but it packs quite possibly the largest emotional punch of the entire series.\n\nAnd, there’s the finale, “Fun While It Lasted.” Even though it was the “ending” that Netflix wanted for the series, is poignant and stripped down, with only the five main characters speaking during the episode. Pair it with the former episode, and we get not one, but TWO endings fitting of this roller-coaster of a series.\n\nJust like the previous five and a half seasons, the character development remains stellar. We see those close to Bojack realize that maybe it’s high time they stopped putting their lives on hold for him. We see this particularly in Diane- who fittingly ends the series in a scene with Bojack- as she finally breaks through on writing her novel, though it’s nowhere near the topic she thought it would be - “Good Damage” is an excellent and accurate depiction of the writing process, by the way. We feel so happy for her that her writer’s block has ended, but also that she’s found the right guy (jokes) for her, who is a new, more positive support system. She makes peace with the fact that our damage doesn’t make us special- sometimes it just is something that exists, and that no good will come of it, and that’s okay.\n\nMoving onto Princess Carolyn, Todd and Mr. Peanut Butter: all three find their own way even without Bojack in their lives. Despite breakups, miscarriages and bankruptcies, Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet. And we see her finally get everything she deserves- a baby (her adorable adopted hedgehog, Ruthie), a revival of her flailing career, and her dream wedding to Judah, the perfect partner in terms of both personal and professional life. We see Todd struggle with his relationship with with estranged mother, and we learn that what Todd lacks in IQ, he makes up for in EQ, or Emotional Quotient. His point about “turning yourself around” being really what the Hokey Pokey is all about is both dumb and incredibly poignant at the same time. And finally, there’s Mr. Peanut Butter, who finally realizes that being on your own isn’t the worst thing in the world. He embraces this change with the same optimism he’s known for. Also, he’s responsible for turning Hollywoo into Hollywoob. So there’s that.\n\nYou want to talk about criminally underrated shows? Look no further than Bojack Horseman. And I’m not even horsing around here (more bad jokes). Those rough first six episodes were worth something. Creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg doesn’t get enough credit for how carefully crafted this show is, with each moment perfectly encapsulating the feelings we feel every day, and perfectly illustrating the human experience. Thank you for six wonderful seasons, Bojack.\n\n​\n\n2. The Queen's Gambit​\n\nI love Anya Taylor-Joy so goddamn much.\n\nI also love chess now?\n\nThis brilliant adaptation of Walter Tevis’s 1983 novel of the same name features Anya Taylor-Joy as Beth Harmon, a chess prodigy who rises to the top of the chess world while dealing with emotional problems and substance abuse.\n\nThe series title definitely sounds British. Try it with your best English accent. The Queen’s Gambit. It does, right?\n\nIt’s not, the show takes place mainly in Kentucky. But, just about everyone in it is British, which is hilarious to me. Look! There’s Dudley from Harry Potter! And look over there! It’s the little boy from Love Actually dressed up as Indiana Jones playing chess!\n\nFor real though, this show is a masterwork of storytelling. We’re introduced to Beth Harmon waking up hungover and late for a match with Vasily Borgov in Paris. The rest of the story is entirely in flashback (and eventually catches up to the present). We find, in the early episodes, a newly orphaned Beth arrives at Methuen Home, meets Mr. Shaibel, learns how to play chess, and is introduced to tranquilizing pills. As the series progresses, we learn just how hungry Beth is to win at chess, and is clearly striving to be the best chess player in the world.\n\nOne of the best things about the series is the turnabout each character makes from foe to ally in Beth’s life. The first example of this is Alma Wheatley (Marielle Heller), who, despite having a rocky relationship with her husband- and seems into Beth’s chess success only for the financial benefits- ends up being a strong maternal figure for her, even if she essentially passed on her alcohol addition in the process. It also comes in the form of Beth’s various opponents, including Harry Beltik (Harry Melling), Townes (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd), and Benny Watts (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), as each one teaches her the finer points of the game, and how sometimes it takes a team to win a single player game. They recognize that Beth will hang herself out to dry if she tries to go at this game (not even chess, but life) alone. A moment toward the end of the series where Beth, Harry, and Benny are working through a chess problem together is truly heartwarming.\n\nThe other best thing about the series is the clarity of it. Chess is a complicated game at the outset. And once you understand how all the pieces work and how they move around, there are different strategies and angles to look at the game through. There are seemingly endless possibilities and routes to success in this game. The Queen’s Gambit makes chess accessible to people who don’t know much about it. This is evident in the resurgence of public interest in the game, with chess sets at an all-time high in the wake of the series premiere. Because the show makes you understand what’s happening on a fundamental and technical standpoint, it allows the drama to establish itself within the game. You feel the weight of each decision to move each particular piece- for me, it was the little nugget early on in the series where Beth learns that if you touch a piece, you have to move it- and how each move could potentially be life or death.\n\nFrom the opening moves, to the mid-game, all the way to the end game, The Queen’s Gambit is riveting. Ride the wave while you can and immerse yourself in that world, and fast.\n\n​\n\n1. The Last Dance​\n\nEarly on, the pandemic took away my sports.\n\nAnd I took that personally.\n\nAnd then, The Last Dance came to save us all. ESPN and Netflix’s joint venture to tell the story of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls teams of the 1990s was downright epic, both in scope and in storytelling.\n\nThe backstory here is that the Bulls hired a camera crew to document their 1997-98 season, which would eventually lead to the team’s sixth NBA championship in eight years. All the while, the footage from the season is intercut with the backstories of what is a who’s who of names and faces from that era of the franchise. Phil Jackson, Jerry Krause, Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippin, Steve Kerr- the list goes on. But everyone knows from the outset that the story is really about Michael Jordan, his history and his legacy- from his days at North Carolina, to the early years of carrying the Bulls through the playoffs of the late 80s and early 90s, to cementing his status as a cultural icon, to the death of his father and his subsequent first retirement- The Last Dance manages to capture so much history in just 10 episodes.\n\nStill, The Last Dance gives the spotlight to each member of the organization and lends their story as parts to an overall whole. From the early days of the Jordan-Pippen dominance, and how an injury to Michael led the Bulls to hire Phil Jackson, who has his own unique philosophy about the game of basketball; which in turn lends itself to letting Dennis Rodman go out and miss four days of practices to hang out in Vegas, all while GM Jerry Krause continues to drive wedges between them all- for what seems like no apparent reason- it is a brilliant setup.\n\nAnd on an even more fundamental level than that, it’s about a basketball team overcoming obstacles on the court. Jordan’s battles with Larry Bird and the Celtics, to some brutal fights with the “Bad Boys” Detroit Pistons, which leads into the selection of the dream team and the snubbing of Pistons point guard Isiah Thomas- for reasons Thomas still disputes to this day- and then the ultimate goal of winning as many championships as possible; The Last Dance connects the personal stories happening off the court to the story the people are more familiar with on the court. The whole time, no matter what, you’re left with the feeling that you know what happens in the end, but you’re still looking forward to what comes next; holding your breath in suspense at the game presented to you, or being left in awe of the athletic magic you just witnessed from a particular highlight of Jordan’s illustrious career.\n\nIt’s hard for me to critique a documentary series, at least from a filmmaking standpoint, outside of, maybe, editing. How do I argue with what actually happened in history? In the case of a sports documentary- sports being a subject I am fairly well-versed in- you simply can look at the bigger picture and ask yourself, why? Why did this team simply stop existing after this series ends? And will we ever see anything like it ever again?\n\nIn regards to the series, I doubt we’ll see anything quite like this again (sorry, Tom Brady- I’m not sure how your upcoming series will compare). The fact that the footage shot by the camera crew was kept unseen for over 20 years, especially when we sports fans clamor for any and every piece of media we can get, is astounding. The scope of it all is magnificent, and it culminates with this celebration of joy and greatness. This was the television we needed for this pandemic. A sports soap opera the likes of which we may never have the pleasure of seeing again.\n\nWhat TV did you enjoy this year? What were you bingeing?

Initially it was though that only the plays were going to stand out this year, with the likes of To Kill a Mockingbird, Network, The Ferryman, Choir Boy, The Waverly Gallery, Gary, andWhat the Constitution Means to Me all having standout spots on Broadway this year, many of which either announced or premiered in 2018.\n\nBut the musicals, never to be counted out, had a serious charge in the spring. Shows like Ain’t Too Proud, Beetlejuice, Tootsie, Hadestown, Oklahoma!, and even The Prom, which still continues to stay strong despite the onslaught of shows opening after it.\n\nThe performances were strong as well. Movie stars and veteran stage actors alike gave fantastic performances. Bryan Cranston, Jeff Daniels and Adam Driver, along with Paddy Considine and the incomparable Jeremy Pope highlight the Best Actor in a Play category, while the women have SIX nominees, including the likes of Laurie Metcalf (who we’ve never seen before), Janet McTeer, Elaine May (at the age of 87), and Annette Bening.\n\nOn the musical side, we saw spectacular musical performances this year… and dare I say there were too many to count?\n\nThe entire cast of Hadestown, including Eva Noblezada, Andre De Shields, Amber Gray, and Patrick Page.\n\nThe cast of The Prom: Caitlin Kinnunen, Beth Leavel, and Brooks Ashmanskas- even with fabulous supporting performances from Christopher Sieber, Angie Schworer and Michael Potts.\n\nCareers could be made this year. Santino Fontana in Tootsie. Stephanie J. Block in The Cher Show. Ali Stroker in Oklahoma!. Ephraim Sykes in Ain’t Too Proud.\n\nThere were even performances from this year that didn’t get nominated (although why, I’m not sure). Bonnie Milligan in Head Over Heels stands out. Stephanie Styles in Kiss Me Kate does too. Tracy Letts in All My Sons. And countless more.\n\nThis was a really good year for Broadway, all things considered. And since the Tony Awards are on Sunday, let’s take a look at who’s walking home with those shiny little spinner things.\n\n​\n\nBest Musical\n\nReeve Carney and Eva Noblezada star in \"Hadestown.\"\n\nThe nominees:\n\nAin’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations\n\nBeetlejuice\n\nHadestown\n\nThe Prom\n\nTootsie\n\nFor the first time in quite a while, we have a very likeable group of Best Musical nominees that I would be happy if any of them won.\n\nHadestown is the clear favorite, which means it’s Rachel Chavkin and Anaïs Mitchell’s New Orleans jazz/Greek tragedy fusion piece to lose. The show really is that good, and it’s worth every dollar (and trust me, some of these tickets may cost you every dollar you have) to see. Hadestown features an eclectic cast of actors including the Amber Gray, Patrick Page, Andre De Shields, Eva Noblezada, and Reeve Carney. The score is this really interesting jazz/folk/songwriter blend, with songs that you can actually (gasp) walk away singing? What a concept. And then there’s the stagecraft- absolutely brilliant lights, sound, costumes and set reminiscent of Rachel Chavkin’s previous endeavor, Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812. And despite it being a story everyone knows (Orpheus and Eurydice), it still holds up as a brilliant retelling of an old classic, with twists and turns that still hit home. It’s the favorite for a reason, and I certainly thought the same when I saw it.\n\nChristopher Sieber, Angie Schworer, Beth Leavel, Brooks Ashmanskas, Josh Lamon, and the company of \"The Prom.\"\n\nAnd then I saw The Prom.\n\nAs a preface, it is very difficult for me to cry while watching live theatre. So much has to go right, and if something ruins it for you (like a hearing aid going off throughout the entire second act of Hadestown), you feel like your money was wasted a little bit, and it’s unlikely you’ll be able to dish out another hefty sum of money to see something again. The show really has to take you to another place. It wasn’t until I saw Waitress with Sara Bareilles that I experienced such a thing.\n\nSo when I was a hot mess at the end of The Prom, even though I was sitting in the balcony, that showed me that I was seeing something special.\n\nI went on a journey seeing this show. I went from really not being into it for the first 15 minutes or so, to the show literally sitting me down and saying “HEY. This is the reason why we go to the theatre. Give your critical eye a rest for two goddamn seconds and have FUN.” The twists. The turns. The emotions. The TEARS. What I see in this show is so much love, so much joy, so much “love is a good thing that we should be celebrating.” I see a lot of Head Over Heels in The Prom (it’s just done a lot better, sorry, Hudson family). I truly wanted to live in that world when I was watching it. And, funny enough, it has the fewest nominations of any of the Best Musical nominees (7).\n\nThe Prom is the right story for Tony voters to select it as Best Musical.\n\nThe other shows in this category are also formidable; props to the Wing for getting this category correct. Ain’t Too Proud has 12 Tony nominations, Tootsie, 11. Beetlejuice has 8. These shows are not here by accident.\n\nI tend to overanalyze these things based on what the best-looking scenario is on paper. So, I’m going with my gut. Hadestown is not the next Hamilton (nor is it close), but it’s sure blowing up like it’s the next Evan Hansen, and that’s good enough for me. But trust me- Hadestown isn't going to run away with these awards like many thought it would.\n\nAnd if there’s some kind of shocking twist, you can bet The Prom will best next in line for the crown.\n\nWill win: Hadestown\n\nShould win: Dare I say… The Prom?\n\nCould win: Tootsie\n\n​\n\nBest Play\n\nPaddy Considine (center) and the cast of \"The Ferryman.\"\n\nThe nominees:\n\nChoir Boy by Tarell Alvin McCraney\n\nThe Ferryman by Jez Butterworth\n\nGary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus by Taylor Mac\n\nInk by James Graham\n\nWhat the Constitution Means to Me by Heidi Schreck\n\nThe biggest shock to this category was the exclusion of both To Kill a Mockingbird and Network, two plays that many surely considered locks, and potentially even contenders to win. But since those two are out, we have to deal with what we’re left with, which leaves the race pretty much wide open. One of the current favorites has to be Heidi Schreck’s What the Constitution Means to Me, which earned itself a nomination for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. I think based on what the Tony Awards are, which is an enormous advertisement for Broadway so that tourists will come to New York and keep it afloat, giving Constitution the win seems like the obvious move. It’s political. It’s emotional. It’s timely. It is yet another “fuck you” from the theatre community to the American political machine. Which is why I think it would be an easy, relatable, safe choice to make. I’m not knocking What the Constitution Means to Me, but the praise that has been heaped on it and its Pulitzer Prize nomination signal that everyone’s riding that wave right into the Tony Awards.\n\nBut in my opinion, the Best Play of this category (and of this year) was The Ferryman. Despite changing casts midway through the run, it earned tremendous praise, including a Critic’s Pick from The New York Times. And just when I thought it had run out of momentum and Constitution was a lock to win, Ferryman picked up Best Play awards at the Drama Desk, Outer Critics’ Circle, and Drama League Awards, defeating Constitution at all three turns.\n\nI’ve gone back and forth with this selection. Initially, and for the longest period of time, I had Heidi Schreck and Constitution pulling the upset. But now I’m going with my gut. Ferryman forever.\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nWill and should win: The Ferryman\n\nCould win: What the Constitution Means to Me\n\n​\n\nBest Revival of a Musical\n\nThe intimate revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\" at Circle in the Square theatre.\n\nThe nominees:\n\nKiss Me, Kate\n\nOklahoma!\n\nTwo extremely traditional shows received revamps this year. One of them was your typical, run-of-the-mill-revival- a squeaky-clean, Roundabout Theatre Company-subscriber-friendly remounting. The other was a complete re-imagining of an American classic, stripped down from its big Broadway roots of the 1930s and rebuilt “for the 21st century” in a small, intimate environment. The question is: which show will resonate with Tony voters more? I think because it tried to go to such great lengths, and to have a lot of it work, Oklahoma! will stand out further than Kiss Me, Kate will.\n\nWill win: Oklahoma!\n\nCould win: Kiss Me, Kate\n\n​\n\nBest Revival of a Play\n\nThe revival of \"The Boys in the Band.\"\n\nThe nominees:\n\nAll My Sons by Arthur Miller\n\nThe Boys in the Band by Matt Crowley\n\nBurn This by Lanford Wilson\n\nTorch Song by Harvey Fierstein\n\nThe Waverly Gallery by Kenneth Lonergan\n\nThis category is tough, because only two of the shows nominated are currently running. The other three were all early season shows that closed either before or shortly after January 2019. Of those two that are still running, Burn This is the better production (and I’m not just saying that because I work there- I work at Roundabout too, and I’ve seen All My Sons), but it all depends on which show resonates with voters more, or which ones the Wing chooses to remember the fondest. The Waverly Gallery has Elaine May and a Kenneth Lonergan nomination from last year going for it. Torch Song closed early, but garnered favorable reviews. The Boys in the Band was the first show to open in the 2018-19 season, but thanks to Ryan Murphy, will be getting a Netflix special made from it, reminding voters that it exists. I think, of the major production awards, this one is shrouded in the most mystery. Early on, The Waverly Gallery was the favorite, and I think that remains true heading into June. But don’t be surprised if The Boys in the Band or Burn This pull the upset.\n\nWill win: The Waverly Gallery\n\nCould win: The Boys in the Band or Burn This\n\n​\n\nBest Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\n\nSantino Fontana stars as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels in \"Tootsie.\"\n\nThe nominees:\n\nBrooks Ashmanskas, The Prom\n\nDerrick Baskin, Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations\n\nAlex Brightman, Beetlejuice\n\nDamon Daunno, Oklahoma!\n\nSantino Fontana, Tootsie\n\nFive men, five vastly different stories. There’s been some controversy surrounding Tootsie, but if I could stick my nose where it might not belong for two seconds, Michael Dorsey is supposed to a terrible person. He’s so despicable that obviously folks are going to hate him for dressing up as a woman to try to get a role. I think that might be the point. Still, I think Santino’s got it in the bag, since he’s got to carry the show. The other four nominees are matched (or overshadowed) by others in their cast, so I think we’ll see the “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” actor take home his first Tony.\n\nWill win: Santino Fontana, Tootsie\n\nCould win: Alex Brightman, Beetlejuice or Damon Daunno, Oklahoma!\n\n​\n\nBest Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical\n\nThe three \"Chers\": Teal Wicks, Stephanie J. Block, and Micaela Diamond.\n\nThe nominees:\n\nStephanie J. Block, The Cher Show\n\nCaitlin Kinnunen, The Prom\n\nBeth Leavel, The Prom\n\nEva Noblezada, Hadestown\n\nKelli O’Hara, Kiss Me, Kate\n\nEvery year seems like it will be THE year for Stephanie J. Block. It’s interesting that people say that, considering she’s only been nominated twice previously for Tony Awards. But her competition isn’t as strong this year. Caitlin Kinnunen and Beth Leavel likely will cancel each other out, as both are equally strong in The Prom for different reasons. Eva Noblezada gets swallowed up in the vast cavalcade of talent that is Hadestown, and I don’t think Kiss Me, Kate is strong enough as a production for Kelli O’Hara to carry it on her back (even though she carries that entire show on her back). Cher is a generational talent, and Stephanie J. Block’s turn as Star Cher will likely make her stand out from the group. It’s finally her time, guys!\n\nWill and should win: Stephanie J. Block, The Cher Show\n\nCould win: Beth Leavel or Caitlin Kinnunen, The Prom\n\n​\n\nBest Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play\n\nBryan Cranston stars in \"Network,\" directed by Ivo van Hove.\n\nThe nominees:\n\nPaddy Considine, The Ferryman\n\nBryan Cranston, Network\n\nJeff Daniels, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nAdam Driver, Burn This\n\nJeremy Pope, Choir Boy\n\nThis is another interesting category shrouded in some mystery. It appears to be the big three film and TV stars in the front of the pack: Bryan Cranston’s Howard Beale from Network, Adam Driver’s portrayal of the hyperactive Pale in the Burn This revival, and Jeff Daniels’ turn as the iconic Atticus Finch in Aaron Sorkin’s To Kill a Mockingbird. Cranston has this very unique ability to play to both a live camera and a live audience at the same damn time. That has to count for something. He also won the Olivier for his performance in Network, and he’ll be competing against Paddy Considine, who was also nominated for The Ferryman once again. But Cranston seems to have lost a lot of momentum, and his inclusion with this very strong group of equally good actors could split his chances. Jeff Daniels has the mighty task of playing Atticus Finch… but dare I say that any other actor of his stature in that position could play the brilliant orator that is Atticus? Let me hit you with that third option- Adam Driver. Pale is not a role that anyone could play. It’s a roller-coaster of a time on stage. He’s full of so many emotions- and all of them begin at a 10 and seem to just spiral out of control. Rage, grief, love, frustration, confusion- it’s all there to the “volcanic” (as the Times put it) Driver. In a late surge of momentum, The Wing awards the Tony to one of Hollywood’s best young actors. Driver wins in something of an upset.\n\nWill and should win: Adam Driver, Burn This\n\nCould win: Bryan Cranston, Network or Jeff Daniels, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\n​\n\nBest Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play\n\nJanet McTeer (right) stars in \"Bernhardt/Hamlet.\"\n\nThe nominees:\n\nAnnette Bening, All My Sons\n\nLaura Donnelly, The Ferryman\n\nElaine May, The Waverly Gallery\n\nJanet McTeer, Bernhardt/Hamlet\n\nLaurie Metcalf, Hillary and Clinton\n\nHeidi Schreck, What the Constitution Means to Me\n\nEverybody’s been on the Elaine May train since The Waverly Gallery opened. The 87 year-old would be receiving her first Tony nomination, and a win would make her the oldest Tony Award winner ever for an acting category. In her way are five other brilliant nominees. I really love that they nominated Janet McTeer for Bernhardt/Hamlet, a super underrated performance in this blogger’s opinion. If I were running the Tony’s, Laura Donnelly would win for her powerful performance in The Ferryman. That play is not about Quinn or any of the kids, it’s about Caitlin, and thanks to Donnelly, that becomes blatantly clear over the course of the show. But I haven’t been given any reason to think she’ll win, considering Ferryman changed their cast over about midway through the run. We’re going with Elaine May, who hasn’t had any doubt challenge her this season.\n\nWill win: Elaine May, The Waverly Gallery\n\nShould win: Laura Donnelly, The Ferryman\n\nCould win: Janet McTeer, Bernhardt/Hamlet or Laurie Metcalf, Hilary and Clinton\n\n​\n\nBest Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical\n\nThe main company of \"Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations.\"\n\nThe nominees:\n\nAndre De Shields, Hadestown\n\nAndy Grotelueschen, Tootsie\n\nPatrick Page, Hadestown\n\nJeremy Pope, Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations\n\nEphraim Sykes, Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations\n\nWhen I saw Hadestown, I was more impressed with Patrick Page than I was with Andre De Shields. Still, Andre was playing Andre, which should fare well with Tony voters. The inclusion of both Ephraim Sykes and Jeremy Pope (who is being nominated for two different acting categories this year) certain makes things interesting as well. Will the Wing honor his fantastic achievements in both Ain’t Too Proud and Choir Boy in this category? I think we’re going with tradition here and picking Andre De Shields, further bolstering Hadestown’s bid for Best Musical.\n\nWill win: Andre De Shields, Hadestown\n\nShould win: Ephraim Sykes, Ain’t Too Proud\n\nCould win: Patrick Page, Hadestown or Jeremy Pope, Ain’t Too Proud\n\n​\n\nBest Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical\n\nAli Stroker plays Ado Annie in \"Oklahoma!\"\n\nThe nominees:\n\nLilli Cooper, Tootsie\n\nAmber Gray, Hadestown\n\nSarah Stiles, Tootsie\n\nAli Stroker, Oklahoma!\n\nMary Testa, Oklahoma!\n\nIt’s Amber Gray against Ali Stroker. Both are fantastic and both deserve to win. But the real story is the exclusion of Bonnie Milligan from Head Over Heels, who made a noteworthy debut on Broadway to hardly any fanfare. If anyone deserved to be here most, it was her. I don’t think Mary Testa’s inclusion in the category hinders Ali Stroker’s chances of winning, and in fact, I think she’s got this one locked up.\n\nWill and should win: Ali Stroker, Oklahoma!\n\nCould win: Amber Gray, Hadestown or Sarah Stiles, Tootsie\n\n​\n\nBest Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play\n\nBrandon Uranowitz (left) embraces Keri Russell (right) in the revival of Lanford Wilson's \"Burn This.\"\n\nThe nominees:\n\nBertie Carvel, Ink\n\nRobin de Jesus, The Boys in the Band\n\nGideon Glick, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nBrandon Uranowitz, Burn This\n\nBenjamin Walker, All My Sons\n\nMy gut is to pick Brandon Uranowitz for this category, and not just because I work at Burn This. I firmly believe he gave the best performance out of these five. People are still talking about Bertie Carvel’s turn as Rupert Murdoch from Ink, but I think if Burn This gets any kind of award at the Tony’s, it’s for Uranowitz’s brilliant turn as Larry in the Lanford Wilson revival.\n\nWill and should win: Brandon Uranowitz, Burn This\n\nCould win: Bertie Carvel, Ink\n\n​\n\nBest Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play\n\nCelia Keenan-Bolger plays the precocious Scout Finch in Aaron Sorkin's play \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\nThe nominees:\n\nFionnula Flanagan, The Ferryman\n\nCelia Keenan-Bolger, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nKristine Nielsen, Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus\n\nJulie White, Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus\n\nRuth Wilson, King Lear\n\nThere’s not much of a contest here. Ever since casting was announced for To Kill a Mockingbird, Celia Keenan-Bolger has been mentioned right along with Jeff Daniels every step of the way. Scout is a hefty part of the book, with some even considering her to be the central character of Harper Lee’s iconic novel. Kristine Nielsen replaced Andrea Martin before Gary started previews, so her role has to be a juicy one as well. But Celia is as close to a leading character as you can get in this one. No contest. CKB wins her first Tony.\n\nWill and should win: Celia Keenan-Bolger, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nCould win: Kristine Nielsen, Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus\n\nBest Book of a Musical\n\nThe nominees:\n\nDominique Morisseau, Ain’t Too Proud\n\nScott Brown and Anthony King, Beetlejuice\n\nAnaïs Mitchell, Hadestown\n\nChad Beguelin and Bob Martin, The Prom\n\nRobert Horn, Tootsie\n\nI want to make this clear- Hadestown doesn’t really have a book. And if it does, it’s not spectacular in comparison to the others it’s going up against. The two that I think have the best chance are Tootsie and The Prom. Tootsie because it’s one joke after another, and in comparison to the score, it’s the stronger of the two; The Prom because it’s just so pure, full of wit and full of love written by people who clearly love the craft they’ve dedicated their lives to. If The Prom steals one here, I wouldn’t be mad- nor would I be shocked, considering Bob Martin won a Tony for writing The Drowsy Chaperone. But I’m picking Tootsie here.\n\nWill and should win: Robert Horn, Tootsie\n\nCould win: Chad Beguelin and Bob Martin, The Prom\n\n​\n\nBest Original Score\n\nThe nominees:\n\nJoe Iconis, Be More Chill\n\nEddie Perfect, Beetlejuice\n\nAnaïs Mitchell, Hadestown\n\nMatthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin, The Prom\n\nAdam Guettel, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nDavid Yazbek, Tootsie\n\nNow we get into the strong suit for Hadestown- the score. It started as a concept album, but Anaïs Mitchell’s music has evolved into a musical phenomenon. As I mentioned before, it’s this really cool jazz/indie/folk/singer-songwriter fusion that is extremely catchy, and while the first act has all the bops, the second act uses those bops to sew the story all together. Hadestown’s biggest competition is The Prom, once again, as Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin deliver another potential winner, also full of earworms and inspirational tracks. Also, I want to deliver the biggest applause ever to Be More Chill, who are obviously going to hang onto this one nomination they have for years to come.\n\nWill and should win: Anaïs Mitchell, Hadestown\n\nCould win: Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin, The Prom\n\n​\n\nBest Orchestrations\n\nThe nominees:\n\nMichael Chorney and Todd Sickafoose, Hadestown\n\nSimon Hale, Tootsie\n\nLarry Hochman, Kiss Me, Kate\n\nDaniel Kluger, Oklahoma!\n\nHarold Wheeler, Ain’t Too Proud\n\nI personally think the orchestrations for Oklahoma! are brilliant. Daniel Kluger takes Rodgers and Hammerstein’s iconic score and reworks it for a more modern, jamboree, bluegrass-type feel. But I feel like Hadestown’s got it locked up. It’s got fascinating instrumentation (violin, cello, trombone, guitar, bass, piano, drums) to achieve this sort of hollowed-out, thrown together feel, but it also has the ability, along with the strength of the vocal arrangements, to create this gorgeous wall of sound. Hadestown has it.\n\nWill and should win: Michael Chorney and Todd Sickafoose, Hadestown\n\nCould win: Daniel Kluger, Oklahoma!\n\nBest Direction of a Musical\n\nThe nominees:\n\nRachel Chavkin, Hadestown\n\nScott Ellis, Tootsie\n\nDaniel Fish, Oklahoma!\n\nDes McAnuff, Ain’t Too Proud\n\nCasey Nicholaw, The Prom\n\nAny of these people could win a Tony for Best Director of a Musical and I would not be upset. All five have done incredible work with this respectable set of musicals. However, since Hadestown is the favorite, and because Rachel Chavkin was not honored for her work on Great Comet, she takes home the Tony for her work on Hadestown.\n\nWill and should win: Rachel Chavkin, Hadestown\n\nCould win: Hadestown has the best chance, but literally anyone could win and I wouldn't be mad.\n\n​\n\nBest Direction of a Play\n\nThe nominees:\n\nRupert Goold, Ink\n\nSam Mendes, The Ferryman\n\nBartlett Sher, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nIvo van Hove, Network\n\nGeorge C. Wolfe, Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus\n\nScott Rudin pissed a lot of people off when he forced several regional and community theatres to give up the rights to other versions of To Kill a Mockingbird, before giving those theatres the rights back, on the condition that they perform exclusively Aaron Sorkin’s version. This debacle was a terrible PR move, and a lack of a nomination for Best Play was probably the Wing sticking it to Rudin. However, if there’s any consolation prize, it’s for Bartlett Sher, who directed the piece. Scott Rudin might not be winning a Tony this year, but at least they’re honoring this gigantic achievement of a play.\n\nWill win: Bartlett Sher, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nShould win: Sam Mendes, The Ferryman\n\nCould win: Ivo Van Hove, Network\n\n​\n\nBest Choreography\n\nThose JUMPS, though.\n\nThe nominees:\n\nCamille A Brown, Choir Boy\n\nWarren Carlyle, Kiss Me, Kate\n\nDenis Jones, Tootsie\n\nDavid Neumann, Hadestown\n\nSergio Trujillo, Ain’t Too Proud\n\nThere’s one show that has this award locked up and one show only. It’s Kiss Me, Kate, obviously. That “Too Darn Hot” is LIT. Warren Carlyle takes home his second Tony Award.\n\nWill win: Warren Carlyle, Kiss Me, Kate\n\nCould win: David Neumann, Hadestown or Sergio Trujillo, Ain’t Too Proud\n\n​\n\nBest Scenic Design of a Musical\n\nThe nominees:\n\nAin’t Too Proud- Robert Brill and Peter Nigrini\n\nBeetlejuice- David Korins\n\nHadestown- Rachel Huack\n\nKing Kong- Peter England\n\nOklahoma!- Laura Jellinek\n\nI am curious as to how they’ll recognize King Kong’s enormous ape puppet this year, considering the puppetry team is receiving an honorary award for their work. I am also curious to see how the enormous house set for Beetlejuice stacks up against Hadestown's intricate, moving set. I'm going to give the edge to Rachel Huack. I enjoy the use of turntables and trapdoors.\n\nWill win: Hadestown- Rachel Huack\n\nCould win: Beetlejuice- David Korins\n\n​\n\nBest Scenic Design of a Play\n\nThe nominees:\n\nThe Ferryman- Rob Howell\n\nGary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus- Santo Loquasto\n\nInk- Bunny Christie\n\nNetwork- Jan Versweyveld\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird- Miriam Buether\n\nAnother question is video and projection design, which is heavily utilized by a play like Network, using live cameras, cutaways, glass, and even the outside world as a set, in true Ivo Van Hove style. I think Network wins because of this, even though both sets for Gary and The Ferryman are impressive, but I feel like we should have more awards for impressive technical specs like projections. Hopefully changes (or at least more specific rulings) to the awards are coming as technology in Broadway shows is becoming more advanced.\n\nWill win: Network- Jan Versweyveld\n\nCould win: Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus- Santo Loquasto or The Ferryman- Rob Howell\n\n​\n\nBest Costume Design of a Musial\n\nThe nominees:\n\nAin’t Too Proud- Paul Tazewell\n\nBeetlejuice- William Ivey Long\n\nThe Cher Show- Bob Mackie\n\nHadestown- Michael Krass\n\nTootsie- William Ivey Long\n\nBeetlejuice’s costumes are spectacular: an eclectic array of monsters and ghouls. Because, you know, it’s a show about death. The next closest challenger would probably be The Cher Show, because Cher is, well, Cher. For all I know Hadestown could probably steal this one too.\n\nWill win: Beetlejuice- William Ivey Long\n\nCould win: The Cher Show- Bob Mackie or Tootsie- William Ivey Long\n\n​\n\nBest Costume Design of a Play\n\nThe nominees:\n\nBernhardt/Hamlet- Toni-Leslie James\n\nThe Ferryman- Rob Howell\n\nGary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus- Ann Roth\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird- Ann Roth\n\nTorch Song- Clint Ramos\n\nIn this next round of arbitrarily picking Tony winners, we have Best Costume Design of a Play. I’m picking Mockingbird because I really hope there’s a ham costume that Scout wears.\n\nWill win: To Kill a Mockingbird- Ann Roth\n\nCould win: Bernhardt/Hamlet- Toni-Leslie James\n\n​\n\nBest Lighting Design of a Musical\n\nThe nominees:\n\nAin’t Too Proud- Howell Binkley\n\nBeetlejuice- Kenneth Posner and Peter Nigrini\n\nThe Cher Show- Kevin Adams\n\nHadestown- Bradley King\n\nKing Kong- Peter Mumford\n\nTHE SWINGING LIGHTS OF HADESTOWN. That is all. Beetlejuice would be a close second.\n\nWill and should win: Hadestown- Bradley King\n\nCould win: Beetlejuice- Kenneth Posner and Peter Nigrini\n\n​\n\nBest Lighting Design of a Play\n\nThe nominees:\n\nThe Ferryman- Peter Mumford\n\nGary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus- Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer\n\nInk- Neil Austin\n\nNetwork- Jan Versweyveld and Tal Yarden\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird- Jennifer Tipton\n\nI can see Network winning here. I can see Gary winning. I can also see The Ferryman winning. Something about that incredible show has to be honored for creating the sinister mood that is prevalent throughout the show. In a purely random call, Peter Mumford wins for The Ferryman.\n\nWill win: The Ferryman- Peter Mumford\n\nCould win: Network- Jan Versweyveld and Tal Yarden or Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus- Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer\n\n​\n\nBest Sound Design of a Musical\n\nThe nominees:\n\nAin’t Too Proud- Steve Canyon Kennedy\n\nBeetlejuice- Peter Hylenski\n\nHadestown- Nevin Steinberg and Jessica Paz\n\nKing Kong- Peter Hylenski\n\nOklahoma!- Drew Levy\n\nSound design in musicals is tough. I suppose it’s how well created sounds blend with existing music. If that’s the case, I could see Beetlejuice winning here, as there are LOTS of extra sounds in addition to the music. But it could also be how well the sound is transferred around the theatre, where the advantage would favor Hadestown and especially Oklahoma!, where interesting orchestrations and different theatre spaces might yield an award. All of these are reasons why I have zero clue what I’m talking about. Hadestown for the win. Again.\n\nWill win: Hadestown- Nevin Steinberg and Jessica Paz\n\nCould win: Beetlejuice- Peter Hylenski or Oklahoma!- Drew Levy\n\n​\n\nBest Sound Design of a Play\n\nThe nominees:\n\nChoir Boy- Fitz Patton\n\nThe Ferryman- Nick Powell\n\nInk- Adam Cork\n\nNetwork- Eric Seichim\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird- Scott Lehrer\n\nFor plays, I can understand it a little bit better. I can see Network taking home yet another tech award for its pretty similar replication to the movie. I think it’s a pretty safe bet.\n\nWill win: Network- Eric Seichim\n\nCould win: The Ferryman- Nick Powell or To Kill a Mockingbird- Scott Lehrer\n\nAnd thus ends another round of completely random, logic-based Tony predictions.\n\nWho's your pick to win Best Musical? Leave a comment down below.\n\n​\n\nTune in to the 73rd Annual Tony Awards on Sunday, June 9th at 8:00pm only on CBS.\n\nShare\n\nEvery Episode of \"Black Mirror,\" Ranked\n\nI want to begin by saying that I don’t think there is a bad episode of Black Mirror… but there is a hierarchy that exists within the series, and we’re here to find it.\n\nCharlie Brooker’s either a really intuitive guy wary of the dangers of technology, or he’s a tech-less hermit and just absurdly paranoid. Regardless, the guy knows how to make us think twice about our futures, and these technological cautionary tales give us a glimpse into how our lives could be 10 years from now, or, in some cases, 10 minutes from now.\n\nThey’ll make you feel. They’ll make you think. They’re scare you. They’ll empower you. Brooker’s done his job if Black Mirror drives home a point on you. So, with 18 episodes, a Christmas special and a movie under its belt, and since season 5 is coming out tomorrow, let’s rank every single installment, shall we?\n\nThis is your one warning before you read. If you haven’t seen Black Mirror- Spoilers lie ahead. ​\n\n20. \"Black Museum\"\n\nSeason 4, Episode 6\n\nThe most recent episode of Black Mirror, in my opinion, is the biggest dud. Letitia Wright and Douglas Hodge give great performances, Wright in particular, who pulls the rug out from under Hodge’s Rolo Haynes in the episode’s final act, but I thought the stories were as a whole fairly uninteresting, and the plot twist at the end didn’t pack much of a punch. Overall, the episode is just flimsy. Shout out to Penn Jillette, though, whose short story “The Pain Addict” serves as inspiration for the first of the three stories in the episode. Fun fact, though: “Black Museum” actually contains multiple easter eggs, with a reference to every previous Black Mirror episode present in the season 4 finale. ​\n\n​\n\n19. \"Men Against Fire\"\n\nSeason 3, Episode 5\n\nFor me, this one was forgettable. It’s an interesting idea, the thought of military implants making soldiers think the enemy is some deformed, savage beast, but that’s really as far as the idea stretches: that the reality of wars here on Earth are as simple as humans killing other humans. Malachi Kirby’s performance as Stripe leaves a bit to be desired, although his moment at the end where he thinks he sees a lover, only to discover that neither she nor the life he used to have exists. Michael Kelly’s inclusion in this episode obviously stems from his involvement in House of Cards, and his performance as Arquette is solid, but nothing more than Douglas Stamper with his foot off the gas.\n\n​\n\n18. \"The Waldo Moment\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 3\n\nI will give this episode credit for preceding the political climate America finds itself in today, but I think “The Waldo Moment” is a bit too on the nose. Oversaturation of news and the subsequent analysis done by both journalists and comedians alike can certainly cause us to think outside the box when it comes to determining leadership. And so, when Daniel Rigby’s Jamie Salter tries to flip the system, we find it logical for him to do so. It’s just… the Bear, Waldo, itself, is just ridiculous. And if I have to listen to him say “Hey! Mr. Monroe!” One more time, I’m gonna jump through a table. “The Waldo Moment” does beg the question, however, while we’re on the subject of electing fictitious people as leaders, there’s some clause in the Constitution that says Mickey Mouse can’t be President, right? Asking for a few hundred million friends. ​\n\n​\n\n17. \"Arkangel\"\n\nSeason 4, Episode 2​\n\nThis episode didn’t really go anywhere for me. It had a cool concept, similar to what we see in “The Entire History of You,” but opts to focus more on the family aspect instead. Rosemary Dewitt’s performance as Marie is effectively and increasingly agitating, albeit heartbreaking, as she wrestles with being a helicopter parent to Sara (Brenna Harding). I can certainly understand where both parties are coming from here. But there are plenty of plot holes to distract me from their relationship. Like, why doesn’t Owen Teague’s character Trick call the police on Marie when she confronts him about sleeping with Sara, since the Arkangel program was deemed illegal in America? Why does Sara have to beat the shit out of Marie with the damn tablet instead of throwing it away? Have Marie and Sara never had the talk about individuality and helicopter parenting? It’s got some cool twists and some shocking moments, but overall, I see some wasted potential here with “Arkangel.”\n\n​\n\n16. \"Fifteen Million Merits\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 2\n\nA lot of people really like Daniel Kaluuya’s monologue at the end of “Fifteen Million Merits.” And I do too. It’s an impassioned, rambling speech about authenticity. But at the same time, it’s about what we’ve already known in after watching for the last hour- that absolutely nothing is real in the world of “Fifteen Million Merits.” I felt like this episode is so far out of left field in comparison to the episode before it (“The National Anthem”) and just about every episode after it. It tries to do too much with all of its concepts layered on top of each other, that we’re not sure what to focus on. This is the first episode to feature the song “Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)” by Irma Thomas, so it’s got that going for it. ​\n\n​\n\n15. \"White Christmas\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 4​\n\n​I love Jon Hamm, I really do. Hamm’s character in the first sub-story of “White Christmas” is quintessentially Hamm-ian, as he works as a torturer by day, and a seduction coach by night, being so suavely pleasant all the way. But Rafe Spall steals the show here. We see the full depth of his grief, seeing as he’s handled his divorce in… let’s say a very sub-par way. When he sees his child for the first time, it’s truly heartbreaking. The strength of “White Christmas” comes from its major plot twist, though, as the tales of deception and murder come full circle back into the present. Both characters are terrible people, but they gain our sympathy, and we end up feeling bad for them as both of their lives ultimately crumble by the end of this twisty-turny episode. Post-episode funks are the gifts that keep on giving in Charlie Brooker’s world. Merry Christmas?\n\n​\n\n14. \"Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\"\n\nInteractive Movie​\n\nBlack Mirror’s first “movie,” as it were, is extremely creative in its premise. The “choose your own adventure” narrative is genius. I just wish it were a little more fine tuned. The acting is great, with Fionn Whitehead and Will Poulter (who I still can’t get over being British) leading the charge, and the story is creative enough, as an amateur game designer struggles to get his idea off the ground after being hired by a video game company. I just can’t help but feeling pigeonholed by the choices laid out for me. Black Mirror is a show that has its intense and overwhelming moments, forcing you to be uncomfortable as you watch ordinary people come to terms with the terrors of technology. But when given the choice to guide a character, most ordinary people aren’t going to love options that are: “A. Bad.” and “B. Bad but in a different way,” because that’s not what their nature as humans favors. Getting to compare endings with your friends is a lot of fun, and hopefully we get to see more “user-directed” projects in the future, perhaps even away from Black Mirror. This is a really valiant first attempt. The first one through the wall always gets bloody, though.\n\n​\n\n13. \"Metalhead\"\n\n​Season 4, Episode 5\n\n“Metalhead” exists in the same vein as The Terminator franchise, in that we’ve got humans running away from machines that are trying to kill them. It’s shot entirely black and white, and despite having the shortest run time in the entire series (41 minutes), it manages to pack in as much intensity as any long-form Black Mirror episode. The setup is simple: Bella (Maxine Peake) attempts to shake a killer robot “dog” that has tracked her. For an episode with a premise as basic as it is, the intricacies of “Metalhead” shine through, from Maxine Peake’s excellent performance, to the horrifyingly real design of the dogs, whose weapons only scare the viewer even more as they get more and more sinister. The cat and mouse (dog and mouse?) game runs swiftly through the gorgeous countryside, with the human consistently trying (and in some ways, brilliantly succeeding) to outsmart the pursuing machine. It only gets scarier when you learn that the dogs in question are based off the robotic dogs created by Boston Scientific that can pull a damn truck. Now, what do teddy bears have to do with any of this?\n\n​\n\n12. \"Crocodile\"\n\nSeason 4, Episode 2\n\n​I approve of the decision to move filming of this episode from Scotland to Iceland. The visuals of this episode stand out more than any other, with shots of stunning landscapes serving as the backdrop for this intriguing “memory heist” story. Andrea Riseborough really makes us wonder what “Crocodile”’s title really implies, and whether or not she truly feels remorse for any or her actions, and because all of her actions make sense, it is easy for us to go back and forth on wanting her to escape and wanting her to get caught. The finale of the episode is heartbreaking. She should have checked on the fucking guinea pig. THE GUINEA PIG.\n\n​\n\n11. \"Be Right Back\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 1\n\nThe first two seasons of Black Mirror go back and forth with episodes that are an in-your-face kind of allegorical, and episodes that make you take a few minutes and think on what you just saw. “Be Right Back” is one of those. For the first time, we see some big-name actors (Domhnall Gleeson and Hayley Atwell) featured in a Black Mirror episode, as Ash and Martha, the latter of whom attempts to regenerate the former in an experimental recreation method. “Be Right Back” is brilliant in that is far more “big picture” than all other episodes that came before it. We see Hayley Atwell’s character struggle mightily with the balance of physical presence and actual humanity, and how our online selves are just that- they’re not the whole version of us, they’re just what is most likely the cleanest version of us. The ending of this episode is a lot like “The National Anthem,” where we expect one course of action to take place, only to have a slight diversion at the very end leave a bitter taste in our mouths. PSA: Don’t text and drive, everyone.\n\n​\n\n10. \"The National Anthem\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1\n\n​Black Mirror’s premiere episode is technology at its simplest- in that there’s no technology we don’t already have as the primary focus of the episode. Rory Kinnear’s Prime Minister Michael Callow wakes up to find Princess Susanna has been kidnapped by an unknown party, and in order to ensure her safety, will have to have sex with a pig live on British television. It’s the ultimate “will he, won’t he?”, as you want to know what’s going to happen next, but certainly don’t want to watch this guy have sex with a pig. As the drama unravels, we learn how dangerous public opinion can be, as the world suddenly and sharply turns on Callow, seemingly without knowing the full story. In many episodes of Black Mirror that involve omnipresent unseen antagonists, I am constantly impressed by their ability to remain one step ahead of the good guys.\n\n​\n\n9. \"Shut Up and Dance\"\n\nSeason 3, Episode 3\n\nUpon first watch, I wasn’t a big fan of “Shut Up and Dance.” I thought it was too formulaic, and the ending wasn’t as satisfying as I wanted it to be. But after consideration, sometimes there’s nothing wrong with formula if it is done well... and you're in the right mindset to watch this episode- truthfully, I binged \"Nosedive,\" \"Playtest\" and this one in a row and was clocked out from being beaten over the head by allegories. Alex Lawther’s Kenny is blackmailed into following seemingly aimless directions after he is caught on camera masturbating to images on his computer, with the assumption that if Alex completes his instructions, his act will not be broadcasted to his friends and family. He is plunged into a tense game of follow-the-leader, and gets entwined with Hector (Jerome Flynn), another man being blackmailed by the same group. Of course though, in true Black Mirror style, we find that no one can truly outrun their sins. The final moments of the episode, specifically Alex’s final emotional state, the slow motion camera work, and the music (Radiohead’s “Exit Music (For a Film)”) are chilling. ​\n\n​\n\n8. \"Playtest\"\n\n​Season 3, Episode 2\n\n​Note to everyone: when your mother calls, answer the phone. Entering the world of video games for the first time, “Playtest” shows how far some developers are willing to go to elicit fear on a deep psychological level- and how cockiness could probably get you killed. Wyatt Russell plays Cooper, an American traveler strapped for cash, who ends up participating in a beta test for a new augmented-reality horror video game designed by Shou Saito (Ken Yamamura). He also has this glaring character flaw- in that he won’t pick up his phone when his mom calls. What I love about “Playtest” is that the consequences are blatantly avoidable, and yet it’s a great commentary on how we think we’re in control of what’s right in front of us- like in a video game. But it’s only when we realize we’re past the point of no control that we try to reach out for something that’s not there.\n\n​\n\n7. \"The Entire History of You\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 3\n\nWhat if you could see everything you’ve ever done? Pretty cool for figuring out where you may have gone wrong with something, like a job interview, or for winning an argument to prove your point, right? Well, because this is Black Mirror, we see the relationship Liam (Toby Kebbell) and Ffion (Jodi Whittaker) spiral into oblivion in a matter of hours. Liam uncovers the mystery of his cheating wife just by using the finest of details to devastating and heartbreaking results, and we’re left to wonder (although it is shadowed early on by another character with no Grain implant) if seeing all our memories really is a good thing or not. My one qualm with the episode is this: the “cereal monogamist” line delivered by Jonas (Tom Cullen) that Liam nitpicks as not being funny is actually… pretty funny. Still waiting on the feature film that Robert Downey, Jr. bought the rights to.\n\n​\n\n6. \"Nosedive\"\n\nSeason 3, Episode 1\n\n​When you’ve got a script written by Michael Schur and Rashida Jones, you know you’ve got something special (and you also know your show has crossover appeal). The idea of a social class system determined by the ratings you receive from your peers is a potentially terrifying idea (even though it’s already being toyed with with apps like Peeple and experimented with in China), but the idea of everyone acting blatantly fake towards you sounds even more off putting. Bryce Dallas Howard does an excellent job as Lacie, who struggles to make it to her “friend” Naomi’s (Alice Eve) wedding, as she experiences a series of social miscues that send her social rating into a nosedive (that’s the title of the episode. Wild.). Cherry Jones makes a surprise appearance as Susan, a truck driver who had a luxurious life as a 4.8, but plummeted after her husband died. A major feature of this episode is its production design, a brilliant display of clean, pastel colors, hiding the gross, fake interior that lies below it. Still, with Schur and Jones behind the script, “Nosedive” has a lighter tone than some (all) of the other episodes that came before it. I credit this episode for unfreezing Charlie Brooker’s heart a little bit. You might want to chuck your iPhone into the sea for precautions, though.\n\n​\n\n5. \"USS Callister\"\n\n​Season 4, Episode 1\n\nThis episode will be forever known as “the Star Trek one,” as it pays excellent homage to the classic TV space epic of yore. In the fashion of the show, though, nothing is what it seems. We’re not even sure if Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) is the hero of this thing. Of course, we find that he’s not- he’s the villain- and we don’t find this out until we meet Natalie Cole (Cristin Milioti), and we discover Daly is just another tormented victim at his day job (he’s the COO of an augmented reality video game developer) that has taken cyber bullying to another level. “Callister” is a return to form for the series, as we’re taken through the world of pop culture fandoms and given a critique on the hyper-masculine, misogynistic, insecure people that populate it and control it. “USS Callister” also does just enough to keep us from feeling totally depressed, utilizing cheesy dialogue and ironic humor, colorful and creative production design, and intense, nail-biting heist sequences. This episode also won an Emmy for Best Television Movie, and rightfully so.\n\n​\n\n4. \"Hang the DJ\"\n\nSeason 4, Episode 4\n\nAs someone who shamelessly utilizes online dating apps, this episode struck a chord with me. The simple but brilliantly designed premise of people being matched by a Siri-like assistant (“Coach”) for a predetermined amount of time, as part of a grander attempt to find an “ultimate compatible other” is played out to a delightfully surprising ending by Georgina Campbell and Joe Cole. You can feel the ups and downs that people looking for love experience- the highs of being with and having fun with someone in a spontaneous moment of bliss, as well as the bitter feeling of loneliness that everyone has experienced at one time or another. And with a brilliant score by Sigor Ròs, it only elevates the experienced further. Man, if only Tinder was like this. The system would truly never be wrong. ​\n\n​\n\n3. \"Hated in the Nation\"\n\nSeason 3, Episode 6\n\nThe final episode of season 3 gave us this long-form buddy cop drama. We’ve got Kelly Macdonald as Karin Parke, the wise-cracking and insult-hurling Scottish veteran cop, contrasted by her partner, the green but intuitive Blue Coulson, played by Faye Marsay. After the death of a journalist at the center of a social media onslaught, Macdonald and Coulson uncover an even more sinister plot- killer robotic bees. Under the prologue’s guise of “something bad has just gone down, here’s what happened,” we learn that social media instigators are just as bad as people who piss them off… because robotic bees will enter your skull and eat your brain from inside, akin to the beetles from The Mummy. The brutal and bloody images from “Hated in the Nation” will leave you shaken. The fallout will leave you heartbroken. The epilogue will leave you shaking. Just watch this one if you’re not familiar. Or even if you are. More long-form content, Black Mirror, please.\n\n​\n\n2. \"San Junipero\"\n\nSeason 3, Episode 4\n\nIf you’re watching Black Mirror for the first time, you have to earn watching “San Junipero,” because it is by far the most emotional installment in the entire catalogue, and skipping everything that precedes it in favor of watching it will ruin the rest of it for you. In what begins as a romantic drama set in a bustling seaside town, a chance encounter between party girl Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis) becomes a heart-wrenching love story that stretches across the years. In “San Junipero,” we deal with the freedom of being able to live out (or even relive) the best years of our lives, but also the impending future, and what it might mean to be stuck there, and how our relationships form, grow, and perhaps even become strained because of it. Acting and story aside, the technical construction of the episode is immaculate. There’s something that can become extra cheesy when dealing with 80s scenic and costume design, but nothing about “San Junipero” seems over the top. Interwoven with 80s pop songs (lookin’ at you, Belinda Carlisle) and a brilliant score from Clint Mansell (The Fountain, another film to check out if you liked “San Junipero”), we clearly know that San Junipero and “Heaven is a Place on Earth” go hand in hand. Like “USS Callister” after it, “San Junipero” thrust Black Mirror into the mainstream awards scene, winning two Primetime Emmys, one for Best Writing of a Television Movie or Limited Series, and Best Television Movie.\n\n​\n\n1. \"White Bear\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 2\n\n“White Bear” pulls the classic twist “the good guy was really the bad guy all along!,” as we find that Lenora Crichlow (Victoria Skillane) is a horribly shitty person after the credits begin to roll on the episode. What brings “White Bear” to the top of this list is the shock factor. It is the 5th episode released of the series, and while “The Entire History of You” gives us plenty of heartbreaking moments, “White Bear” misleads you for 40 minutes and then pulls the rug out from underneath you. With “White Bear,” we also get an interesting social critique about how we view violence as entertainment, and, in a sense, how we’ve become desensitized to it. We think we’re empathizing with Lenora, until we’re caught in the metaphorical bear trap right along with her. Then, it’s anyone’s game. If it wasn’t evident that Black Mirror takes major inspiration from The Twilight Zone, “White Bear” certainly drives that point home. Just for the shocking twist alone, “White Bear” reaches the number one spot on this list. I’m truly still reeling.\n\nWhich episode of Black Mirror is your favorite?

Season 5 premieres on Wednesday, June 5th, also on Netflix.\n\nShare\n\nThe Wrap Sheet, February 2019\n\nA monthly airing of thoughts and grievances\n\nCorgi Wink!\n\nI think I really hate February.\n\nIt’s too short. All of a sudden it’s March and we’re left saying: “wait, where are the extra two or three days of my month?” or “Shit, I have to pay all these bills super early!”\n\nThere are also things like false spring that typically occur in February that give me false hope before plunging me back into the despair of winter.\n\nBut the Groundhog didn’t see his shadow this month! So maybe our dreams of an early spring really might come to fruition?\n\nDespite a short month, February was jam-packed with headline news. Here’s your monthly wrap-up for February.\n\nWe begin in Atlanta, Georgia, the site of Super Bowl LIII between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThis game feels like it took place ages ago.\n\nI won’t get into it too much, because you can find my fully-fleshed out piece on the Super Bowl by clicking here, but I can certainly sum up the contest in a few words.\n\nSo, basically, the Patriots left Atlanta with their sixth Super Bowl championship, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for most all-time by a franchise. The difference is, it took the Steelers 40 years to win 6. It took the Patriots half that time.\n\nFor most football fans, this game was incredibly boring, and that mindset probably wasn’t without just cause. It was 13-3, the lowest scoring Super Bowl of all time, and one year removed from one of the best offensive Super Bowls of all time, a 74-point, 1,000-yard-plus showcase with a satisfying ending of the underdog defeating the Goliath.\n\nThis was the opposite of that.\n\nOr, it was a defensive feast, if you appreciate both sides of the game of football.\n\nThe Rams punted on their first 8 possessions of the game before scoring points. The first touchdown of the game came in the 4th quarter, as the Patriots finally managed to string together some passes to put them in the red zone, before Sony Michel punched it in from two yards out to give New England a 10-3 lead.\n\nBill Belichick was the hero of the game for New England. His defensive game plan stifled the Rams’ potent offense, and Sean McVay’s squad failed to make any kind of adjustments, as the Patriots defense slowly wore them down.\n\nNew England’s defense came up big a number of times, including Kyle Van Noy’s long sack of Jared Goff on third down, a huge pass breakup by Jason McCourty on Brandin Cooks in the endzone, in which McCourty came from the other side of the field to make the play after the first defender blew his coverage; the play kept the Rams out of the end zone and kept the Patriots in front.\n\nBut there was no bigger play than the one made by Stephon Gilmore. The defensive back has quietly turned into one of the premiere shutdown corners in football, and his performance erased any doubt of his ability to perform well, as his interception of Jared Goff on the Rams’ final drive sealed the victory for the Patriots.\n\nJulian Edelman was named the game’s MVP, as his offensive production was the best of any player on the field- 10 catches, 141 yards. The game could have had a number of players named MVP, but Edelman was borderline unstoppable for most of the game.\n\nIn what was a month of highs and lows for the Patriots (we’ll get to the low ones later), earning a Super Bowl victory when everyone doubted their chances mere months ago had to be one of the sweeter moments in the franchise’s history.\n\nIn other sports news…\n\nI WENT TO THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW!\n\nFor those of you who don’t know, I do a sports podcast every Monday with my partner Kata Stevens called Under Further Review. We drink different adult beverages and talk about sports.\n\nAnd somehow, our little show managed to get media credentials to the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden before.\n\nNow, I have never been to MSG before.\n\nI have a habit of going to sports arenas to see events that are not the primary sport of the arena. I have been to Gillette Stadium for lacrosse, ice hockey, and soccer, but never football. The first time I went to Barclays Center, it was for boxing. And now, my first time at the World’s Most Famous Arena was spent watching puppers prance up and down a field of AstroTurf.\n\nBut hey. There were dogs, and boy do I love dogs.\n\nOne of our main questions for the podcast was: “Is dog showing a sport?”\n\nInitially my answer was “no,” but I suppose I was quickly proven wrong. Every dog we saw backstage at the show was being groomed akin to how an athlete prepares for a game- obsessively, furiously, and intricately. One of the handlers even had me feel her dog’s hind leg muscle. So… strength training, I guess.\n\nWe interviewed a number of dogs and their handlers, including one Kiera Karlin, a 16-year old Junior Handler from Atlanta, and her Finnish Lapphund, Dusky. This is Kiera’s third year at Westminster. Here’s Kata’s interview with the pair:\n\n​I also met my new favorite kind of dog: the Norwich Terrier.\n\nIsn’t she the cutest thing you’ve ever seen? Her name is Belle, and she is not unlike if a chicken nugget were a dog.\n\nBelle was one of a number of fan favorite dogs at the event.\n\nSpeaking of fans, the arena was packed on the second night of the show- like, I could not find a seat, even with my media pass. Eventually, some seats did open up and I got myself a great view of the arena.\n\nI didn’t expect the crowd to be so into it, but every dog that was introduced on the Jumbotron was met with a loud reaction that was a mix of an “aww,” a cheer, and an “oh my god”-esque gasp.\n\nAnd when these dogs walked the promenade, the place got LOUD.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with how the dog show works, let me break it down quickly:\n\nThere are hundreds of breeds of dogs. Every entry for a given breed competes to win “Best of Breed.” So, the best, say, golden retriever, will then compete in their group stage.\n\nThere are seven groups: Working, Sporting, Non-sporting, Toy, Hound, Herding, and Terrier.\n\nThe best of breeds compete for best group based on poise, grooming, and presentation. The judge picks his or her top eight, which do another round of judging. At this point, the judge will select his top four, the first of which wins the group and advances to compete for Best in Show.\n\nThe Best in Show is judged exactly the same way, with the winners of each of the seven groups going through a round of judging to determine Best in Show.\n\nBelle, the Norwich Terrier from earlier, was a fan favorite, and drew many cheers from the crowd as she pranced across the floor. She was even picked for the top eight of the terrier group, to which the crowd erupted.\n\nHowever, the Norwich was not selected for the top four. This drew the ire of the crowd, and they booed the judge’s decision.\n\nThere was booing. At a dog show.\n\nGood for people for being passionate about their favorite dogs.\n\nFor Best in Show, there was even more controversy, as one of the handlers and her Schipperke were disqualified before judging could even take place. A conflict of interest- the judge had co-owned dogs with one of the Schipperke handler’s co-owners- had elicited confused groans from the crowd.\n\nI just wonder why either the judge wasn’t replaced or the Schipperke handler wasn’t replaced or disqualified in a prior round. I feel like this issue could have been avoided altogether with a little thinking ahead.\n\nAs for the remaining six dogs, two stood out: A "
