        "text": "A sell-out audience at the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation Theatre at ArtsEd in Chiswick saw final-year musical theatre students put on a lively and enthralling production of The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nDirected by Philip Wilson, this excellent production showcased the students’ skills and hard work, and featured a unique double-cast that adds diverse flair to each performance.\n\nOriginally opening on Broadway and running for over 670 performances, The Drowsy Chaperone won five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, and is a tribute to the Jazz Age musical, filled with laugh-out-loud comedy, show-stopping numbers, and captivating music by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison.\n\nLynne and Land Foundation trustee and noted actor/singer Robert Meadmore came to see the students’ wonderful performance and particularly to watch Foundation Bursary scholar Alex Gavin, who was superb playing a lead role of Man in Chair - Alex can be seen in the photos below.\n\nThe week-long show was sold out and was a testament to the ArtsEd students and the creative/production team, providing a great experience for the final-year group as they approach graduation in the spring and look to embrace professional opportunities in the arts and entertainment world."
