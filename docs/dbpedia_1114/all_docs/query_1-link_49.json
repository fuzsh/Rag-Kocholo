        "text": "The Waterfront Playhouse will present the Tony Award-winning musical, “The Drowsy Chaperone,” running March 7 to March 30, with low-priced previews March 5 & 6. This “musical within a comedy” is the hilariously clever show that took Broadway by storm and had critics raving. The splashy Waterfront production of “Chaperone” will feature over 250 costumes, an ornate set and a stellar cast of 18 that includes a line-up of Key West’s most impressive musical theater talent. The New York Observer called “Chaperone” ‘Smashing, witty and brilliant. I loved every mad minute of it!’”\n\nThe opening night of March 7th will feature a gala after-party sponsored by Gordon Keiser. The production is sponsored by Preferred Properties Coastal Realty, Inc. Season sponsors are Digital Island Media, Royal Furniture and Wodu Media.\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone” is a modern day spin on musicals of old. It pays tribute to the Jazz-Age shows of the 1920’s and their power to transport audiences and lift spirits in hard times. The show begins with a reclusive musical theater fan, who chases the blues away by playing the album of his favorite musical, the 1928 hit “The Drowsy Chaperone.” When he drops the needle on the record, the show literally bursts to life in his drab apartment, morphing into a lavish Broadway musical.\n\nThis fictional musical of “The Drowsy Chaperone” tells the tale of a Broadway starlet who must decide between her stage career and her true love. Mix-ups, mayhem and a gay wedding (in the old-fashioned sense of the word) mark the hijinks of what follows. The show also features a roster of hilarious 1920’s musical character-types: the starlet’s debonair groom, a Latin lover, a ditzy chorine, a Broadway impresario, gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a befuddled dowager, her English butler and a chaperone who isn’t so much drowsy as she is tipsy. (“Drowsy” was a euphemism for “tipsy” during Prohibition.)\n\n“Chaperone” won the Tony Award for Best Book (Bob Martin & Don McKellar) and Best Score (Lisa Lambert & Greg Morrison), as well as the Drama Desk for Outstanding Musical. The show is a rare combination of originality and blinding talent as it addresses the deep desire in all of our hearts: to be entertained. This 95-minute, intermission-less show delivers multiple shows stoppers and an evening of entertainment guaranteed to set your spirit soaring.\n\nThe amazing cast includes some Key West’s brightest stars, as well as new talent: David Black, Laurie Breakwell, Carolyn Cooper, Jeffrey Harwell, Andrew Hodge, Rhett Kalman, J. B. McLendon, Kristen Michelle, Bruce Moore, Michael Pallansch, Kyla Piscopink, Heather May Potter, Vicki Roush, Marjorie Paul Shook, Philip Griffin Tabb, Chris Tanner, Willie Alsedec and Danny Weathers.\n\nThe creative team includes director Danny Weathers, musical director Michael Fauss, choreographer Penny Leto, with assistance from Carolyn Cooper, set by Michael Boyer, lighting by Kim Hanson, props by Carmen Rodriguez and stage management by Trish Manley. The gorgeous 1920’s style costumes have been rented from Maine State Music Theater and designed by Kurt Alger. Leigh Hooten with assistance from Ruth Cahoon and Carmen Rodriguez will make sure the 1920’s period costumes fit and look dazzling.\n\nThe orchestra will include Michael Fauss (keyboards), Nancy 3 Hoffman (synthesizer), Jim Wist (bass) and Maxwell Zemanovic (percussion.)\n\nFor tickets, go to WaterfrontPlayhouse.org for our online ticketing service, plus information on shows including videos, photos and social media.
