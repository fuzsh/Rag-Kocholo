        "text": "Publishing student reviews of high school theater is the cornerstone of a new service from Florida Theater On Stage and the South Florida Critics and Awards Program, better known as The Cappies.\n\nNow in its 19th year, the Cappies enrolls theatre and journalism students, trains them as critics and assigns them to attend shows at 25 schools in Broward and Palm Beach counties. The student write reviews under the mentorship of teachers and volunteers.\n\nFor more information about the Cappies, visit www.cappies.com/sfc/Home.aspx\n\nThe most recent reviews will be at the top of the page, but all of them will appear here all year.\n\nReviews of It’s a Wonderful Life at West Broward High School on Friday, 12/13/2019.\n\nBy Caroline Eaton of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\n\nAs of today, this hour, this minute, this second, the world continues to cope with the harping effects of depression, too often leading to suicide. “It’s a Wonderful Life’s” story of making one realize their immense worth in this society remains prevalent. West Broward’s production of “It’s a Wonderful Life” brought to life the story that keeps on giving, even almost a century later.\n\nOriginally produced as a movie in 1939, this play follows the story of a young man who is in the midst of contemplating life or death when, suddenly, an angel appears. The angel is sent by God to show this man that his life is of too much value to be wasted, making him look back upon his life to understand his impact on not only his own small town, but the domino effect he has enacted on a much larger level.\n\nPlaying the altruistic George Bailey was Noah Levin. With animated character movements and energy that reached the stars, Levin led this production with sheer confidence. As he watched his life before his own eyes, Levin believably showed the true sorrow he felt having to relive his pain once again. As the malicious Henry Potter, Matthew Cleveland nicely foiled Levin’s idealistic attitude with nasty sneers and glaring eyes. Cleveland’s clear resentment for Levin persevered as the story progressed and continued to be seen through each of their interactions.\n\nAs the awe-inspiring angel, Clarence, was Rhema Hooper. Her all-knowingness attitude proved infatuating as she enticed each listener with her exceptional storytelling techniques. She masterfully set the scene for each flashback scenario, undeniably creating a sense of reality to satisfy George Bailey’s need for clarification. Hooper showed an impressive change in stature between her more grounded human form, and her angelic appearance after finally receiving her long-desired wings. Victoria Manzato (Mary Hatch) exemplified an unwavering optimistic aura throughout the show, especially when countering the few times George Bailey needed a stable ground to stand on. Manzato stylistically captured the persona of a 1930s woman, with her evident, old-American movie inflections that created an impression of the time period in which the story took place.\n\nYoung George, played by Virgil Thompson, especially stood out in his small, yet enhancing performance of a crucial memory in George Bailey’s past. He exceptionally captured George’s charismatic tendencies that formed his character into the adored man he grew up to be. The Townspeople added a superb element to the production as they created efficient background chatter and movement without taking away too much attention from the scene. Each featured ensemble member made distinct character choices, showing incredible individuality.\n\nThe technical elements of the show were executed extremely well. Most notably, the stage management crew carried out smooth transitions to effectively move along the scene breaks and set pieces without creating any unnecessary or awkward moments.\n\nIn a time where suicide and depression is unfortunately a constant, West Broward’s production of “It’s a Wonderful Life” continues to ring true today, bringing light to the truth that every life is worth living. Whatever your life’s purpose may be, it is a purpose that deserves to be fulfilled\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Nick Vela of J.P. Taravella High School\n\nAs the famous American novelist and playwright Edna Ferber once said, “Christmas isn’t a season. It’s a feeling.” The true meaning of Christmas has been debated endlessly throughout the entirety of the cherished holiday’s existence, as demonstrated through countless films and writings. However, as Ferber so beautifully expresses, many brilliant minds have all come to a similar conclusion: the selflessness and gratefulness found at the core of the holiday season is precisely what Christmas is all about. West Broward High School’s touching production of “It’s a Wonderful Life” embodies these underlying messages of Christmas exquisitely, making for a “wonderful” performance filled to the brim with Christmas spirit.\n\nBased on the beloved American film by Frank Capra and the classic story by Peter Van Doren Stern, James W. Rodgers’ “It’s a Wonderful Life” was first performed at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School on December 15, 1993. Following the everyday life of one average man in Bedford Falls, the play begins with George Bailey’s serious contemplation of suicide driven by his failed pursuits at escaping the insignificance of his small town life and success. Thus appears his caring guardian angel, Clarence, in hopes to show him the true value of the friends and family that surrounds him by revealing a world where George was never born.\n\nLeading the production, Noah Levin did a commendable job taking on the iconic role of George Bailey. While exhibiting unfaltering energy and expressive facials, Levin also managed to demonstrate clear character development as the play’s story progressed. Accompanying George as his charming wife, Victoria Manzato delivered an endearing and sweet performance as Mary Hatch. Manzato displayed a poised and graceful physicality, which was exactly what her role demanded. Commanding the stage, Rhema Hooper showcased a boundless vitality and remarkable stage presence through her captivating portrayal of Clarence, George Bailey’s very own guardian angel. Hooper’s lively vocal delivery and exuberant characterization acted as the prominent driving force of the production.\n\nDespite some minor inconsistencies in the production’s vocal clarity and build to climactic moments, the cast as a whole gave an enjoyable performance. The ensemble’s constant dedication, prevalent relationships, refined vocal transitions, and distinct shifts in character when entering George’s alternate reality added tremendously to the production.\n\nOverall, the technical elements of the production illustrated a well-executed and cohesive sense of collaboration. The lighting and sound’s fluidity and seamlessness, along with the costumed stage crew contributed greatly to the uninterrupted flow of the performance. The time-period appropriate costumes, hair, makeup, and props allowed for an authentic and accurate representation of the setting of the story, as well as being visually pleasing.\n\nTelling a tale audiences need to hear, West Broward High School’s inspiring production of “It’s a Wonderful Life” illustrates the magnitude and impact one man’s life can have on those around him. Teaching us, once again, how one man can truly touch so many lives\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Abbey Alder of Calvary Christian Academy\n\nHope can be found in the most unlikely of places, even for those who have forgotten the feeling and need someone to remind them. Who better to show what a life is worth than a guardian angel as depicted in West Broward High School’s production of “It’s a Wonderful Life”?\n\nSince premiering in 1993 at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, James W. Rogers’s stage adaptation of It’s a Wonderful Life has been performed across the nation. The 1946 film, directed by Frank Capra, and written by Phillip Van Doren Stern, revolves around the fictional small town of Bedford Falls. The show opens on Christmas Eve as George Bailey, a local businessman who’s down on his luck, teeters at the edge of a bridge. A guardian angel, in the hope of earning wings, reminds George Bailey how impactful a single life can be. The angel, Clarence, takes George Bailey through time and demonstrates the lonely life that George, and those close to him could have led. Though the story began on the bridge of despair, George’s outlook renews to valuing his life.\n\nIn the role of George Bailey, Noah Levin was undeniably bold with his approach to the character. Noah’s captivating vocal range gave the show life. Carrying the show on her wings, Rhema Hooper played the angel, Clarence. Hooper’s entrances were always powerful and instantly commanded the stage. Together, their relationship showed compassion even amid their different viewpoints.\n\nVictoria Manzato, who portrayed Mary Hatch, exuded an old-timey movie glamour. Playfully singing, “Buffalo Gals (Won’t You Come Out Tonight),” Manzato exhibited her enduring love for George from girlfriend to wife. Another actor worth noting was Virgil Thompson, who played Young George, setting up the mannerisms and lifestyle of the older George Bailey. Despite sometimes overpowering the primary actors, the ensemble of townspeople brought a glow of holiday spirit within each scene, carol, or transition.\n\nThe charming atmosphere of Bedford Falls was conveyed by details in lighting, props, and the costumed stagehands. Particularly in the second act, the lighting evoked the power behind the actors’ dialogue. This showed a coherent relationship between technical and performance elements. Most sound components fit accurately, and the lighting usually encompassed all of the actors. Some sound throughout the show appeared jarring due to the high volume, but stage management, led by Gabriella Scott, was executed to near perfection.\n\nThe life-affirming production of It’s a Wonderful Life by West Broward High School offered a fresh perspective on the beloved holiday classic. Whether in the form of an unseen hero, a stranger, or a close friend, look for guardian angels and do not let a wonderful life go to waste.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Emma Sugarman of J.P. Taravella High School\n\n“Each man’s life touches so many other lives. When he isn’t around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn’t he?” West Broward High School’s riveting production of “It’s A Wonderful Life” follows the journey of a man drowned in self-despair. The joyful essence of this emotional tale proves the vast impact of one man’s life while encompassing the true meaning of the holiday season.\n\nBased on Frank Capra’s classic film, James W. Rodgers’s stage adaptation follows George Bailey, a generous banker, who’s life is halted by thoughts of suicide after finding himslef in debt and entangled in the self-regarding schemes of a millionaire. However, on Christmas Eve, 1946, when George’s distress has reached its peak, a guardian angel descends to awaken George to the light in his life. The angel shows George the positive impact he has had on the world by displaying a parallel reality in which he was never born.\n\nGeorge Bailey’s charismatic, yet dejected, demeanor was captured by Noah Levin. Levin showcased a captivating vocalization characteristic to the time era and consistently displayed his emotions through his expressive facials and physicality. Levin’s commendable performance was aided by his enthralling energy and clarity in each action.\n\nPlaying Mary Hatch, George’s wife, Victoria Manzato displayed endearing mannerisms and genuine expressions. Manzato’s impeccable distinction between her primary and alternate persona added an intriguing quality to the entire production. Clarence, the novice angel, was embodied by Rhema Hooper. With each entrance, Hooper lit up the stage with her grand presence. Hooper’s exemplary dialect was consistent, period appropriate, and produced a continuously alluring performance.\n\nThe production’s cohesive ensemble brought each scene to life with their various reactions, developed relationships, and well-maintained energy. Their perfectly unison and harmonious carols accented the production by adding a sense of joy throughout the commotion. Although some cast members periodically lacked motivation, the overall unity of the cast made up for any faults.\n\nThe technical aspects of the production were effective and executed nearly flawlessly. Scene transitions were efficient and remained immersive by having all stage hands dressed in period appropriate costumes. The lighting was appropriate in each scene and minor sound inconsistencies were accommodated for by the cast members’ projection. All costumes and props were suitable for the setting which created a constantly engaging visual.\n\n“Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.” Much like West Broward High School’s heart-warming production of “It’s A Wonderful Life”, this celebrated quote has resonated in the hearts of many. Through this timeless narrative, themes of stress and strife are conquered by faith, hope, and family; the ingredients for a truly “wonderful” life.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Madison Winkler of American Heritage School\n\nWhile the majority of Bedford Falls illuminates the streets with Christmas spirit and cheer, the same cannot be said about protagonist George Bailey. Alone, clinging to the railing of the town’s icy bridge, Bailey contemplates taking his life, yet is whisked away by a reassuring guardian angel, who plans to show him how truly wonderful life is in West Broward High School’s production of “It’s a Wonderful Life”.\n\nThe play’s title “It’s A Wonderful Life” rings a bell in one’s vast memory via the 1946 Frank Capra movie “It’s A Wonderful Life”, further inspired by the short story, “The Greatest Gift”, written and published in 1943. The timeless Christmas tale ventures George Bailey through his own life, opening his and the town’s eyes to how “each man’s life touches so many other lives”. Adapting this priceless story to the stage, it is remarkable to witness how the play’s morals and beauty still apply to society today.\n\nLeading man, Noah Levin, in his portrayal of Mr. George Bailey was successful in providing an intriguing character worth following in the highs and lows of his unpredictable life. Levin excelled in his clear delivery of dialogue and expressions to provide clarification of the tale. Complimenting Bailey was the holy answer to his prayers, the glorious Angel Second Class, Clarence, played by actress Rhema Hooper. Hooper was easily one of the most loveable characters to grace the stage, with consistent energy through her physicality and dialect. Ranging from a “human” guide to a flowy angel granted her wings, she claimed the stage with such dominant body language and presence, additionally possessing natural cadence and inflection in her voice.\n\nSimilar to the above personas, other cast members gave notable performances worth commending. Playing the immobile, hard headed Henry Potter, Matthew Cleveland demanded the stage with maturity and created a “Scrooge-like villain” to challenge the struggling George Bailey, specifically in his financial issues. Causing the monetary crash that spiraled the town into financial ruin, Uncle Billy (Anthony Mejias) also stood out in his comedic timing to highlight the craze of life.\n\nThe townspeople of both Bedford Falls and the alternate dimensional town, Pottersville, developed distinct, distinguishable characters that brought complexity to the production. With an added musical element of caroling, the cast worked cohesively to build relationships between principal and ensemble characters, bringing truth to a small town where everyone knows each other.\n\nTechnically speaking, the show was crisp and executed to a tee. Utilizing availability of lighting, Maria Carreno and Jasmine Farfan use different effects and color schemes to differentiate towns, as well as providing light that could effortlessly be found by the performers. The set changes of the show involved the townspeople which allowed a connected piece even when transitioning to a different moment.\n\nAll in all, West Broward High School collaborated to create a piece of art that captured the essence of the holidays and the inspiring theme of recognizing the impact of a life. While the show did lack in overall diction and holistic character progression, the cast revealed how truly wonderful life can be when surrounded by love.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of The Diary of Anne Frank at Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy High School on Sunday, 11/24/2019.\n\nBy Phoebe Zucker of David Posnack Jewish Day School\n\nThe Holocaust is one of the hardest pieces of history to confront. The idea of people being systematically murdered for their beliefs is inconceivable. Many hid, many fled, and millions were taken to concentration camps. In the play “The Diary of Anne Frank” by Francis Goodrich and Albert Hacket, adapted by Wendy Kesselman, we are given a peek into what it was like living in Nazi-occupied Europe with the fear of capture looming over head. The Frank family and the Van Daan family hide above Otto Frank’s work office for over a year and a half. The Maverick Players at Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy High School invites us into this intimate and deeply impactful annex in their rendition of “The Diary of Anne Frank.”\n\nWhat a performance Erica Gouldthorpe gave! Gouldthorpe, (Anne Frank), transported us into the light-hearted mind of the 13-year-old aspiring writer. Gouldthorpe contrasts the anxiety-ridden Annex residents in such a stark and beautiful manner, expressing a wide range of depth and emotions. Gouldthorpe’s stage father, Justin Cook, was equally beautiful to follow through the story. Cook, (Otto Frank), was a grounded anchor for the characters around him. He was magnetic! The calming, level-headed presence Cook provides makes the audience believe there is hope for the residents of the annex. Christopher Muston, (Peter Van Daan), built such excellent chemistry with Gouldthorpe. Muston handles Peter’s world with such care and brought a great deal of detail to his character. We got a glimpse into this when props fell accidentally out of place, Muston was careful to treat the prop’s repositioning while remaining in character. The level of professionalism which with the cast performed was refreshing and admirable.\n\nRunning the technical side of the annex, Britni Barcelo’s stage management was impeccable. Every light and sound cue fell into place perfectly and never distracted from the actors’s performances. While exquisite lights and sounds tie the intimate annex together, Barcelo’s ability to juggle these technical elements cannot go unnoticed.\n\nCongratulations to the Maverick Players on their phenomenal presentation of “The Diary of Anne Frank”!\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Emma Gidlow of Cardinal Gibbons High School\n\nArchbishop McCarthy High School’s production of The Diary of Anne Frank explores the great difficulties and small triumphs of living in a secret annex during Nazi rule.\n\nTaken directly from Anne Frank’s diary, The Diary of a Young Girl, the worldwide phenomenon has taken the world on the hopeful child’s journey during such a trying and devastating child. Through the perspective of a young child, The Diary Of Anne Frank, tells the true story of a family during their desperate escape from the Nazi invasion of Amsterdam. Living among another family and a refuge dentist, the eight people must live in secret in order to survive.\n\nWith an enticing portrayal of the title role, Erica Gouldthorpe led the show. Her physicality and tone of voice was the perfect embodiment of a young and hopeful child. Gouldthorpe showed a strong acting range with her impeccable comedic timing and deep, emotional acting. Similar to Anne, Otto’s character is one of hope and optimism. Justin Cook, Otto Frank, was nothing short of phenomenal. Cook’s performance captivated the audience with his earnest and mature portrayal. His final monologue, that concluded the play, exceeded the expectations of a high school student.\n\nThe undeniable chemistry between Anne Frank and Peter Van Daan, Christopher Muston, mirrored that of a youthful romance. The two worked together perfectly, showing strong character development as they grew closer overtime. The contrast between the personality of Anne and her older sister Margot, Mariangeli Collado, was remarkable. Anne’s optimistic and youthful tendencies contrasted Margot’s fear and hopelessness. The trio, Muston, Collado, and Gouldthorpe, worked together seamlessly. They brought a necessary sense of light and youthfulness to the dark show.\n\nBritni Barcelo’s superb stage management is deserving of the highest praise. Barcelo was exactly on time for each individual cue and led an excellent technical crew. The production had a brilliant use of lighting and sound that tied together perfectly. The combination of the two brought many chilling moments. Maria Soto also deserves to be commended as the hair stylist. Soto’s evident research and intelligent plan to clip up long hair in order to give off the illusion of a short haircut was flawless.\n\nWhile there may be many social injustices in today’s society, Archbishop McCarthy’s production of The Diary of Anne Frank reminds its audience of the importance to be hopeful for a positive future. It keeps the human spirit alive.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Emma Sugarman of J.P. Taravella High School\n\nAmsterdam, July 1942. Anne Frank’s father guides his family into a secret annex above his old workplace. The Jewish family has gone into hiding due to fear of Nazi persecution. From the moment the family arrives, Anne’s tireless optimism and positive outlook shines through the overbearing gloom outside the attic walls. Archbishop McCarthy High School’s captivating production of “The Diary of Anne Frank” revitalizes the most innocent account of the immoral tragedies of World War II.\n\nBased on the book “The Diary of a Young Girl” by Anne Frank, the stage adaptation, written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, revisits the pages of Anne Frank’s documentation of her journey during the Holocaust. Trapped in the secret annex, the Franks, accompanied by the Van Daan family, attempt to maintain an essence of normalcy with the underlying fear of being discovered plaguing each day.\n\nEmbodying the bubbly and bright Anne Frank, Erica Gouldthorpe captured the lively spirit of her character through her unwavering energy and impeccable comedic timing. Gouldthorpe’s clear development from a bright-eyed child to a valiant young woman emerging into adolescence symbolized the incessant confinement and its effects on the annex’s residents. Justin Cook portrayed Otto Frank, Anne’s pragmatic father. Cook’s sensible and patient air, along with his expressive facials and grounded nature, produced an enthralling performance especially visible in his last monologue.\n\nEdith Frank, Anne’s devoted mother, was played by Sophie Vega. Vega depicted the maternal and protective disposition of her character through her tender intonation and warm physicality. Mrs. Van Daan, the extravagant and sentimental mother of the Van Daan family, was embodied by Bianca Weston. Weston’s brilliant moments of comedic relief accompanied by her bold characterization formulated a multidimensional performance.\n\nThe cast of this production presented the severe content beautifully and with sensitivity. The cohesive ensemble’s well-executed stage business enhanced the performance’s sense of realism. The cast’s raw emotions and vulnerability alluded to the actors sense of experiencing each moment for the first time. Every actor developed a dynamic relationship with their fellow castmates that contributed to the production’s overall authenticity.\n\nThe technical aspects of this production accurately conveyed the solemnity of the environment. The magnificent set accurately conveyed the cramped nature of the annex which contributed to the development of the characters’ frustration and longing for the outside world. The innovative lighting design supported this concept while visibly distinguishing between the contrasting radio reports. The use of hair, makeup, and costumes supported the individualistic personas of each character while accurately representing the show’s time period.\n\nNovember 2019. The story of Anne Frank has provided the 21st century a glimpse into the catastrophic devastation of the Holocaust. Paying tribute to Anne Frank’s resolute sense of hope, Archbishop McCarthy High School’s gripping production of “The Diary of Anne Frank” realizes the young girl’s dream that her story would forever live on.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Cameron Miller of David Posnack Jewish Day School\n\nDuring a time in which the face of humanity had turned against itself, all seemed lost. Yet, a glimmer of hope still prevailed through the eyes of a child named Anne Frank.\n\nAdapted from Anne’s own diary written during World War II, The Diary of Anne Frank was originally dramatized by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, and later revised by Wendy Kesselman in 1997. The play brings to life the struggle of two Jewish families in Amsterdam, as they hide in an annex while Nazi terror consumes the world around them. Through the eyes of a vivacious young woman, The Diary of Anne Frank graces the world with a testament to the bravery and tenacity of the human spirit.\n\nTo take on a story of such poignant historical significance is no easy feat– yet, through their understanding of the script, emotional commitment, and natural chemistry, the young cast excelled in delivering an unbelievably compelling, heartbreaking, and resonating performance.\n\nAs Anne Frank, Erica Gouldthrope brought an unparalleled exuberance that flooded the stage. Gouldthorpe melted into Anne’s characteristic vitality and optimism! She skillfully contrasted aspects of Anne’s development, like her thirst for childlike fun, and outbursts of agony.\n\nIn a heroic portrayal of Otto Frank, Justin Cook served as a grounding presence on the stage, playing off other characters brilliantly and conveying poignant emotion. As the only surviving resident of the annex, he eulogizes the deaths of his dearest family and friends in a final monologue delivered with unbelievable power and emotion.\n\nMrs. Van Daan, portrayed by Bianca Weston, lightened the play, adding an aspect of comedy with her snooty quips and sarcastic comments. Her son, Peter van Daan (Christopher Muston), expertly conveyed his character arc. Muston had an outstanding approach to Peter’s awkwardness and unmistakable chemistry with Anne, his role bolstered the play to a degree of brilliance.\n\nThe final layer of the show’s excellence lay in its flawless technical execution. The stage manager of the production, Britini Barcelo enveloped the stage in Anne’s story, accomplishing every sound, light, and technical cue flawlessly.\n\n“I want to go on living even after my death!” declared Anne Frank’s eternal voice of optimism. In Archbishop McCarthy’s rendition of The Diary of Anne Frank, Anne’s wish was brought to fruition. Despite its tragic ending, the story of Anne Frank is one of hope, tenacity, and optimism that pertains relevance to today’s issues and will continue to echo throughout history\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Rylee Berger of Cooper City High School\n\n“History cannot be written on the basis of historical decisions and documents alone,” declared a Dutch minister in a 1944 broadcast for the BBC. These words would inspire a young girl to refine her diary, a journal that would become, arguably, the most iconic piece of writing from the Holocaust. Archbishop McCarthy High School’s production of “The Diary of Anne Frank” was beautifully cathartic and raw, providing a glimpse into the despair and difficulties plaguing a small annex in Amsterdam.\n\nBased on Anne Frank’s “The Diary of a Young Girl,” the play was adapted for the stage by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett in 1955. It would go on to win the Tony Award for Best Play as well as the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Revised by Wendy Kesselman in 1997, the show has been widely produced by professionals and amateurs alike. The play follows Anne Frank (Erica Gouldthorpe) as she and her family go into hiding to escape Hitler’s regime. In the small, cramped annex, we see Anne laugh, cry, mature, and fall in love.\n\nGouldthorpe led the cast with fitting precociousness and candor; her performance showcased her wide range of expression and breathtaking acting abilities. Gouldthorpe was captivating both in joyful, innocent moments with her family and in her anguished, fearful deliveries when alone. Her comedic instincts were strong and her maturation into a young woman throughout the show was convincing. Though Gouldthorpe created believable relationships with the entire cast, her relationship to her father, Otto Frank (Justin Cook), stood out for its natural ease and touching subtleties. Cook himself provided a precise and compelling depiction of Mr. Frank, encompassing his paternalistic tendencies with great ease.\n\nGouldthorpe also built an adorably awkward and innocent relationship with love interest Peter Van Daan (Christopher Muston). Muston was equally invested in the bond, delivering genuine reactions and endearing clumsiness. Portraying the extravagant and good-humored Mrs. Van Daan, Bianca Weston demonstrated her theatrical prowess and ability to make bold acting choices.\n\nThe entire cast had authentic dynamics and illustrated the challenge of living with seven other people in a confined space. The company remained in character throughout the piece, accentuating their dialogue with specific gestures and stage business that, rather than distracting from the central action, added a layer of validity. The actors’ mastery of the script was evident, especially in the play’s climactic scene when their terror and desperation was on full display.\n\nThe technical elements were well-suited to the production; the precise cues aided in the delivery of moving moments. These stood out in Otto Frank’s moving final monologue during which the lights dimmed one by one as he revealed the passing of his loved ones.\n\nArchbishop McCarthy’s supremely heartfelt production of “The Diary of Anne Frank” leaves us awestruck at the resilient spirit of a young girl and the love she was surrounded with, proving that hope prevails, even in the most unthinkable situations.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of Driving Miss Daisy at Deerfield Beach High School on Saturday, 11/23/2019.\n\nBy Reese Abrahamoff of Cooper City High School\n\nLock the car, start your engine, and get ready for a road trip to the 1900s! On your way to the Deep South, you’ll find Deerfield Beach High School and their heartfelt production of “Driving Miss Daisy” as they delve into themes of human dignity and the importance of friendship.\n\nThe play, written by Alfred Uhry, made its debut in 1987 at the Playwrights Horizons Studio Theatre. The show opened on Broadway in 2010 after two National Tours and a 1989 film adaption, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In the backseat of a 1949 Hudson Commodore, you’ll find Daisy Werthan, a Jewish, crotchety, white Southern woman with no intention of making friends. Enter Hoke Coleburn, a dignified, soft-spoken African American in desperate need of a job. When an unlikely friendship is formed, we are taken through twenty-five years of learning and enlightenment where we come to understand that companionship is, simply put, more important than societal expectations.\n\nLeading lady Sarah Mellinger did a lovely job as the irritable Daisy Werthan. Mellinger’s olden physicality and constant state of dissatisfaction worked extremely well with her character’s grouchy tendencies and close-minded persona. From ridiculous accusations to subtle temper tantrums, Mellinger never faltered in showcasing the stubborn mannerisms of an elderly woman, which allowed for refreshing moments of comedy in a rather serious show. Alongside Mellinger was Chad Chambers as Hoke Coleburn. With clear motivations and a crisp southern dialect, Coleburn’s charismatic nature complemented his ability to play off of Daisy and her headstrong attitude. Together, Chambers and Mellinger demonstrated proper character development as time progressed, allowing for a sincere discovery of solace within each other.\n\nInitiating the relationship between Daisy and Hoke was Alan Halaly (Boolie Werthan), Daisy’s insistent and loving son. With substantial energy and lively expression, Halaly’s sense of loyalty to his mother and her safe-keeping was evident throughout the entirety of the production and led to a truly genuine performance. In such a small cast, it can be easy to lose motivation and purpose. While certain lines seemed to be anticipated by the cast, the actors’ intimacy and character commitment allowed the audience to remain connected to the show and its mature themes.\n\nThe technical aspects of the show were outstanding, especially in reflecting the production’s passage of time. With the use of audible transitions throughout scene changes, such as snippets of Christmas music and, later, published songs, sound excelled in showing the character’s change in age as well as their understanding of life. The hair and makeup team, with the inclusion of sublime old-age makeup, accurately represented the maturity of the characters and presented remarkable attention to detail.\n\nOn the drive back to each of our own destinations, we are left to contemplate the true meaning of friendship. Upon the closing of the curtain, Deerfield Beach High School’s “Driving Miss Daisy,” leaves us with one thought; the road you travel on doesn’t always lead you to the destination you had hoped for, but if you can look back on your journey and smile, then it was worth it.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Kaitlyn Tully of Calvary Christian Academy\n\n“Driving Miss Daisy” premiered off-Broadway in 1987 and made it onto Broadway in 2010. It won the Pulitzer prize in 1988 and was adapted into a popular movie in 1989. It follows a 72-year-old woman named Daisy whose son believes she needs a chauffeur, despite her adamant protestations that she does not. For the first week, she refuses to let the chauffeur, Hoke, transport her anywhere. When she finally allows him to drive her, they begin to become friends, caring deeply about each other.\n\nThe raw nature of this friendship shone through in the chemistry between Daisy (Sarah Mellinger) and Hoke (Chad Chambers). As their friendship blossomed, so did their interactions, leaving in their wake a friendship that would hold them together even when times grew difficult. Their comedic timing added a lighthearted air to the play, creating a sense of beauty in their friendship. Their accents increased the believability, making one feel as though one truly was in Atlanta. Sarah Mellinger’s ability to appear old added to this believability as she would shuffle down stairs and hold her hand to her back. However, other actors seemed to struggle slightly with the nuances of acting elderly. Despite this, the actors did manage to appear older at the end of the show, with Chad Chambers leaning on his cane like it was the only thing holding him up. And somehow, one felt that it was, that without Daisy to hold him up he was near collapsing.\n\nThe technical aspects of the show dropped one straight into 1948, allowing one to truly understand the context of the play. Props by Jennifer “Blue” Moore and Yeva Ilyankova became integral in establishing the setting, with magazines from the 1940s and rotary phones. Their attention to detail was incredible as they had real liquid in the teapot and real pie at the end. However, as the time period changed, the props did not, resulting in Daisy reading the same magazine in the 1960s as she did in the 1940s. Fortunately, sound by Michael Hahn also worked in establishing the time period, using classic songs in the transitions to create a sense of the passage of time. The timing of the sound cues was impeccable, making the play even more believable.\n\nDeerfield Beach High School’s production of “Driving Miss Daisy” reminded one that friendship is what holds people together, even in the most difficult of times. It becomes the thing that is most important even as time passes and people change. And eventually, friendships are what allow us to become who we are meant to be.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Levi Cole of NSU University School\n\nAs people age, they are often distressed by their loss of independence. Deerfield Beach High School’s Production of “Driving Miss Daisy” tells the story of taking a step back and letting someone else take the wheel.\n\nAuthored by Alfred Uhry, Pulitzer Prize winning “Driving Miss Daisy” is the first of Uhry’s Atlanta Trilogy, which details the life of Jewish-Americans in Atlanta. The play first premiered Off-Broadway at the Playwrights Horizons Studio Theatre in April of 1987. Eventually, the production made its Broadway debut in 2010. Set over a 25 year period from the late 1940’s to the early 70’s, the narrative follows Daisy Werthan, an entitled, elderly Jewish woman, and her son Boolie. When Daisy’s age begins to degrade her driving ability, Boolie decides hire a chauffeur for Miss Daisy, an African-American man named Hoke. Initially, Daisy is hesitant, but, over time, Miss Daisy and Hoke develop an incredible bond.\n\nAs Miss Daisy, Sarah Mellinger displayed excellent characterization, physicality, and mannerisms throughout the performance, allowing her to portray a convincing elderly woman. Mellinger’s consistent Atlanta accent and delivery furthered the believability of her character and enhanced the production tremendously. Mellinger also exhibited laudable comedic timing, adding humor to the production. Chad Chambers demonstrated strong commitment and characterization as the sarcastic and wise chauffeur, Hoke. Similar to Mellinger, Chambers maintained a consistent accent and speech pattern, boosting his character further. Mellinger and Chambers possessed a wonderful chemistry onstage, adding to the believability of their roles and entertainment of the show. Portraying Miss Daisy’s protective son, Boolie, was Alan Halaly. Demonstrating strong diction and delivery, Halaly brought commendable energy and commitment to the stage.\n\nCollectively, the cast worked very well together, developing realistic and believable relationships and entertaining dynamics. Despite lack of facial expressions at times, or occasionally fading out of accents, the cast brought excellent energy and engagement to the production. This play was staged in a black box setting, adding to the intimacy of the production.\n\nThe minimalistic technical elements of the play are also to be commended. The sound design by Michael Hahn is to be noted, as the timing of the sound effects was in sync with the actors. Notably, the hair and makeup team effectively showed the age of the characters as well as styling Miss Daisy’s wig realistically. Despite some awkward and lengthy transitions, overall, the tech components boosted the show’s enjoyment in an abundance of ways.\n\nTelling the heartwarming story of a developing emotional bond between two differing personalities, Deerfield Beach High School’s production of “Driving Miss Daisy” captures the transition from unlikely acquaintances to best friends.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Leah Tomas of J.P. Taravella High School\n\nIn the midst of evolving race relations in America during one of the greatest social reform movements in the history of the United States, an unlikely friendship is flourishing. Travel back to the Deep South for a story of friendship against all odds with the cast of Deerfield Beach High School’s production of “Driving Miss Daisy.”\n\n“Driving Miss Daisy” was written by Alfred Uhry. The play premiered at the Playwrights Horizon Studio Theatre in 1987, and made its Broadway debut at the John Golden Theatre in 2010. The play won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and the Broadway production received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play. The story follows Daisy Werthan, a 72-year-old Jewish woman, and her son Boolie Werthan, over the span of 30 years. When a car accident forces Miss Daisy to give up driving, Boolie decides to hire a driver, much to her chagrin. However, an unlikely friendship grows between Miss Daisy and her chauffeur, an African-American man named Hoke Coleburn.\n\nSarah Mellinger (Daisy) demonstrated mastery of physicality and vocal inflection to convey the old age of her character. Mellinger made excellent use of ad-libbed lines to create comedic effect, and developed a wide range of expression throughout her performance. Chad Chambers (Hoke) utilized vocal inflection to convey emotional meaning in each of his lines, and demonstrated superb execution of a Southern dialect. The playful banter between Mellinger and Coleburn provided comedic relief, and the two actors developed endearing and sincere chemistry throughout the production.\n\nAlan Halaly (Boolie) portrayed his character with boundless energy and clear diction. Halaly developed strong relationships and characterization throughout the production, and did an excellent job portraying an older role.\n\nThe cast as a whole demonstrated great diction and energy, and each character was well-developed with a unique emotional arc. Though brief inconsistencies in the execution of a Southern dialect were prevalent, the accent was overall believable, and established the time and location of the story well. The cast often experienced difficulties creating consistent pantomime, some blocking appeared to lack motivation, and the combination of upstage-facing actors along with the decision to omit microphones from the performance resulted in inconsistent volume at times. Overall, the cast did an excellent job portraying older characters during distinct time periods, and delivered an engaging performance.\n\nThe technical elements of this production were well executed. The experience was increasingly immersive as the audience was located onstage to create an arrangement similar to a black box theatre. The sound design skillfully represented the passage of time through audio clips, and all set pieces, costumes, and props were time-period appropriate. Makeup effectively conveyed the age of each actor. However, over the passage of time, set pieces and props did not change to become appropriate for new time periods, and actors did not appear to age gradually.\n\nIt can be difficult to overcome our differences and create friendships with those we consider different from ourselves. Deerfield Beach High School’s production of “Driving Miss Daisy” is a heartwarming representation of the friendships that prosper when differences are set aside, and unbreakable bonds are forged..\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Cristian Velasquez of Cypress Bay High School\n\nWith the delicate depiction of the passage of time and the experience of aging, Deerfield Beach High School’s tender production of “Driving Miss Daisy” tells the story of the budding friendship between a stubborn elderly Jewish woman and her colored chauffeur.\n\n“Driving Miss Daisy” was written by American playwright Alfred Uhry. The Off-Broadway production premiered at the Playwrights Horizons Studio Theatre in 1987, where it ran for three years and was later staged on Broadway in 2010. Set in 1948 Atlanta, “Driving Miss Daisy” tells the saccharine tale of Daisy Werthan, who’s son Boolie hires an elderly man, Hoke Coleburn, to be her driver after she gets in an accident. Despite their initial wariness of one another, over the years, they form a long-lasting bond that defies the struggles that come with old age.\n\nPerformed with the audience sitting on the stage, Deerfield Beach High School’s heartwarming rendition of the production added a unique element of intimacy to the performance, which transports the audience to the world of “Driving Miss Daisy.”\n\nLeading the show with poise was Sarah Mellinger as the bashful Daisy Werthan. From Mellinger’s physicality to her mannerisms to her intonation, she created a bold depiction of a stubborn elderly woman. Her dynamic character arc demonstrated the vastness of Mellinger’s expressiveness, especially during the decline into Miss Daisy’s old age. Portrayed with integrity was Miss Daisy’s “best friend” Hoke Coleburn, played by Chad Chambers. Mellinger and Chamber’s exceptional chemistry established a believable relationship between the two characters, as the tension between them faded over time and grew into a playful friendship.\n\nAnother notable performance was that of Alan Halaly, portraying Boolie Werthan. Halaly remained consistent in his accent and his physicality, which contributed to the enthrallment of his character through the show’s entirety. At times, throughout the production, the actors wouldn’t pantomime the opening of the house and car doors, but their impeccable emotional delivery and chemistry of the cast immersed the audience into the narrative once again.\n\nThe progression of time throughout the production is wonderfully portrayed through the song choices played during the scenic transition, despite being very abrupt. The sound effects played, such as the car horn and the phone ringing, were remarkably accurate, which stage management must be commended for. The props team must additionally be credited for utilizing items that aptly fit the time period; however, some props that needed to change over time did not. Accurately executing the old ages of Miss Daisy and Hoke, the hair and makeup team should be acknowledged for their attention to detail.\n\nDeerfield Beach High School’s charming production of “Driving Miss Daisy” demonstrates how the power of friendship defies the passage of time, despite Miss Daisy and Hoke’s differences.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of 26 Pebbles at South Plantation High School on Friday, 10/22/2019.\n\nBy Leah Tomas of J.P.

Bright Star premiered at San Diego’s Old Globe Theatre in 2014. The musical opened in 2016 on Broadway at the Cort Theatre and ran for 139 performances.

Greenblatt established a believable character and created a genuine connection with Silverman. The two were best showcased together in their heartbreaking duet “I Had A Vision”. Another notable performance was that of Cameron Relicke as the passionately persistent Billy Cane. Relicke ably brought the wannabe writer to life, portraying the youthful and wide-eyed optimistic character with great charisma. Relicke developed a tender relationship with Juliana Rios as Margo. Jimmy and Margo’s playful, budding romance contrasted delightfully with the darker more developed relationship between Alice and Billy.\n\nBringing comedy and vibrance to the stage were Amber Arevalo and Wes Morby as the dynamic magazine office duo Lucy and Daryl. Arevalo excellently portrayed the sassy southern bell and showcased her great dance and vocal abilities in her song “Another Round”. With tight harmonies and knee-slapping choreography, the show’s ensemble enhanced the down-home charm of the show, helping to propel and tell the entrancing story of Bright Star. A standout among them, showcasing elegance and grace with every step, was Beatriz Arevalo.\n\nFrom the denim overalls and period men’s suits to the floral printed dresses and flower-adorned hats, the costumes beautifully fit the country feel and complemented each of the scenes in the show. The quick changes were seamlessly executed, most notably, Alice’s onstage hair and costume change to her younger self.

Silverman’s depiction of Alice in alternating time frames, consisting of her teenage self and the accomplished woman she has grown to be two decades later, was commendable. Playing Jimmy Ray Dobbs, Alice’s love interest, Parker Greenblatt effectively relayed the complex emotional journey of his character. Silverman and Greenblatt displayed nice chemistry throughout the production and skillfully adapted the maturity of their relationship as they aged.\n\nBilly Cane, the eager young writer, was played by Cameron Relicke. Relicke displayed his character’s optimistic outlook through his lively vocals and exuberant energy. Playing Margo, the bookstore owner dreaming of a romance with Billy, Juliana Rios captured the sweet nature and hopeful spirit of her character. Relicke and Rios exhibited lovely development of their relationship, especially in their charming duet “Always Will.” Amber Arevalo, playing Alice’s spunky coworker, showcased terrific dance abilities and consistent characterization throughout the musical. She led the massive number, “Another Round,” with tremendous energy and bold vocal delivery.\n\nWhile the orchestra did occasionally overpower the actors, the powerful melodies provided substantial energy that was expressed through their lively dancing and crisp harmonies. Although occasionally lacking facial expressions, the entire cast conveyed the folksy style of the score, creating a unique flavor of sound and accentuating the bluegrass allure of the storyline.\n\nThe quality technical elements aided the transitions of time throughout the story. The set, costume, and hair changes, specifically for Alice, were well-executed and did not distract. The set did occasionally obstruct the audience’s view of the action onstage, most notably at the end of Act One on the train. The colorful lighting and the image of the moon helped to establish the mood shifts and created a visually appealing landscape.\n\nCardinal Gibbons’ uplifting production of “Bright Star” explored the depth of heartbreaking loss, the power of redemption, and the pure dominance of love.

The other follows a similar name, just younger and more adventurous. Telling the story of this transformation and beyond, “Bright Star” invites us to explore untaken paths and challenge the idea of love.\n\nLeading lady Darby Silverman did a wonderful job as Alice Murphy. Silverman excelled in demonstrating the contrast between her past and present life while also showcasing a wide range of emotions amongst both personas. With effortless vocals, Silverman grounded her performance through numbers like “So Familiar/At Long Last,” and “Please Don’t Take Him,” which certainly left a lasting impression. Alongside Silverman was Parker Greenblatt as Jimmy Ray Dobbs. Showing progression both vocally and emotionally, Greenblatt did a great job depicting his change from youth to maturity while also growing with Silverman in their own self-discovery.\n\nJuliana Rios portrayed the role of Margo, the sweet and loving owner of the town’s local bookstore. With consistent energy and a lovely voice, Rios captured the hearts of the audience as well as Cameron Relicke (Billy Cane). Both Rios and Relicke established genuine connections and allowed each other to shine both together and individually, whether it be through voice or stage presence alone. An additional standout was Amber Arevalo as the sassy and strong-willed secretary, Lucy. With bold choices and precise comedic timing, Arevalo continuously livened the stage, most notably in the show-stopping number “Another Round.”\n\nThe ensemble as a whole was quite remarkable. From chilling harmonies to a constant southern dialect, the cast had clear motivations that never faltered throughout the production. While the cast overall had trouble staying together with choreography, Beatriz Arevalo showcased proper dance technique and told her own story through movement, which should certainly be recognized. The technical aspects of the production were executed very nicely. Stage Management allowed for a continuously flowing production with minimal faults and clean transitions. Costumes did an exceptional job differentiating the character changes as well as distinguishing the two time periods throughout the show.\n\nTelling the true story of the life of Alice Murphy, Cardinal Gibbons High School’s production of “Bright Star” transports us into the harsh reality of the early 1900s where they proved that with a little bit of optimism, the “Sun’s Gonna Shine.”\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Caroline Eaton of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\n\nThrough every wrong path taken, there will always be an unpaved road just dying to be walked upon, so why not be the one whose footprints are set in stone? Cardinal Gibbons High School’s production of “Bright Star” shows audiences that you are the only one who can tell your story, and tell it truthfully.\n\nWritten by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, “Bright Star” uses the story-telling effects of folk music to fully take the show back in time to the hick town of Blue Ridge, North Carolina, when banjos and cowboy boots were a thing of the present. The powerful story follows a teenage girl, Alice Murphy, and her life following a teen pregnancy, heavily frowned upon by her small town community. Observing her life through her adolescent eyes versus her adult perception provides a one-way ticket into Alice Murphy’s progression through life.\n\nPlaying the strong-willed and tenacious Alice Murphy, Darby Silverman embodied Murphy’s extensive capacity for love and vitality. With the challenge presented to her to shift between two different points in Murphy’s life, Silverman provided seamless transitions from her adult self back to her careless and free-spirited teenage years. Along with her brilliant take on the effervescent Alice Murphy, Silverman’s magnificent vocals enveloped the theatre in her rendition of each folk-themed song, most outstanding in “Please Don’t Take Him”. Accompanying Silverman’s compelling stage presence was the equally emotive Parker Greenblatt (Jimmy Ray Dobbs). Greenblatt ably supported his love interest, showing his complete devotion to Silverman throughout the production. Silverman and Greenblatt’s believable chemistry made for a convincing and heart-throbbing performance, especially conveyed in their reunification melody, “I Had A Vision”.\n\nAs the effervescent and light-hearted Billy Cane was Cameron Relicke. Relicke’s sprightly personality captured his character’s youthful persona. Relicke exhibited his impressive versatility on the stage, whether breaking it down on the dance floor or confessing his everlasting love through song to his long-time sweetheart, Margo, played by Juliana Rios. Rios and Relicke’s buoyant and young relationship perfectly juxtaposed the fierce and adult love between Silverman and Greenblatt.\n\nAlso worth mentioning was the comedic duo consisting of Amber Arevalo and Wes Morby (Lucy and Daryl, respectively). Between the most melancholy instances, Arevalo and Morby appropriately provided moments of comedic relief, never failing to appreciate an occasion of potential laughter. In addition, the ensemble of townspeople added immense energy and liveliness to each scene and musical number in which they appeared, managing to exceptionally execute the difficult choreography and harmonies given. A most notable performance in the ensemble was Beatriz Arevalo, displaying stunning technique and illuminating the stage with each stride.\n\nTechnically, the production was executed with extreme efficiency and professionalism. The costumes team, Megan Price and Madison Mishkin, exemplified a clear understanding of the specific color scheme and 1920s-40s time period, exceptionally taking an ordinary stage and transforming it into a world of color.\n\nAs life moves on, one encounters just about everything: the troubled times along with the joyous moments. It is important to understand that all of those moments are what makes your story your own, and Cardinal Gibbons High School’s cast and crew of “Bright Star” told every piece of this story as if it was their own.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of Brighton Beach Memoirs at Coral Glades High School on Friday, 11/15/2019.\n\nBy Roie Dahan of American Heritage School\n\n1937 America was in turmoil; the Great Depression was at its height, drying out the economy and citizen’s jobs and incomes, and tensions in Europe escalated to the peak of World War II. In Coral Glades’ production of “Brighton Beach Memoirs”, the problems the Jerome and Morton families faced were commendably played out, incorporating the broader historical dilemmas of the time.\n\nWritten by Neil Simon, “Brighton Beach Memoirs” tells the story of Eugene Morris Jerome and his family in their home on Brighton Beach, where they are not too short of familial and fiscal predicaments; not to mention Eugene’s own confusion about his new feelings. Simon wrote the play in a semi-autobiographical style, so many of his own adolescent experiences are woven into it. Opening in 1982 in Los Angeles, the show has since been on Broadway twice, won two Tonys, and made into a motion picture.\n\nPlaying Eugene, Matthew Dell-Hak brought an air of optimism and laughter onto the stage amidst the family’s tough situation. His impeccable comedic line delivery and fluctuations of speech brought a nice contrast to the heavy themes of the play, emulating Simon’s intentions of embedding comedy into hardship. Although Eugene gradually matured throughout the show, Dell-Hak was consistently able to implement his childlike demeanor and sense of wonder. Tai Beasley upheld the role of the brazen Kate Jerome with distinct poise and strength, which enhanced her eventual meltdown, helping to create a full character arc. She maintained a robust yet motherly presence that increased the believability of her character and had seemingly genuine connections with her fellow family members.\n\nJoshua Flynn played Eugene’s pragmatic yet disheveled brother Stanley Jerome with a charismatic charm that gave way to a vulnerable, anxious center. He had a profound connection with Eugene, particularly when he taught him about the wonders of puberty. His calm yet distressed temperament was enhanced by strong characterization choices that showed pronounced shifts in his personality. Playing the spunky Nora Morton, Julyette Vargas was always present on stage, showcasing Nora’s boldness and fierce independence. Her distinct intonation and understanding of her situation played into the credibility of her character and intensified her motivations and reactions .\n\nDespite having some issues with momentum and heightened stakes during climactic scenes, the company was nevertheless able to present an engaging and heartfelt performance. Their notable chemistry with one another elevated the story, exhibiting a true family dynamic. Implementing the Mezuzah was a great way to encompass the family’s Jewish traditions.\n\nTechnically, the show must be commended for the amount of student input and historical accuracy, most prominent in hair, makeup, and costumes. They successfully emulated the style of the period with pin-up hairdos and colorful patterned dresses. Although somewhat lackluster in detail, the concept of the set’s design and construction served the flow of this production effectively.\n\nCoral Glades’ production of “Brighton Beach Memoirs” presented the complications of late 1930’s America while resonating with real family issues still being dealt with in today’s world.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Rylee Berger of Cooper City High School\n\nMoney is tight, war is brewing, families are fighting, jobs are hard to come by, and – perhaps worst of all for Eugene – he’s going through puberty. Thus sets the stage for Coral Glades High School’s hilarious and heartfelt production of “Brighton Beach Memoirs.”\n\nWritten by Pulitzer-prize-winning playwright Neil Simon, the semi-autobiographical play is the first chapter in his Eugene Trilogy. After productions in California, “Brighton Beach Memoirs” opened on the Great White Way in 1983, where it enjoyed a three-year run, becoming the last non-musical play in Broadway history to have over 1,000 performances. Following the girl- and baseball-crazed Eugene, the coming-of-age comedy concerns his unusually hectic Brooklyn, NY household as they navigate changing family dynamics, the Great Depression, and world-wide political turmoil.\n\nMatthew Dell-Hak delivered an energetic and memorable performance as the sassy-yet-sincere Eugene. His powerful performance showed great range and impressive development of his character’s arc. As the character also serves as the narrator of the play, Dell-Hak did an exceptional job differentiating between dialogue with other actors on stage and his asides to the audience. His clear commitment to his character shone through his choices in physicality and vocal delivery; his ability to allow his character to believably mature throughout the show was commendable.\n\nDepicting Eugene’s worrisome, superhero of a mother, Tai Beasley (Kate) embodied her role with grace. Beasley balanced the mannerisms of a busy caretaker while still creating a character that, when pushed to her breaking point, delivered a persuasive and heart-wrenching performance. As Jack, the workaholic father who wants only for his family to be provided for, Caleb Ramey portrayed a highly convincing paternalistic physicality and authority when interacting with the other characters. His ability to evolve his relationships with his sons, especially Stanley (Joshua Flynn), was noteworthy. Flynn himself did an excellent job establishing a powerful and multilayered relationship.\n\nOverall, the entire cast did a stellar job in creating authentic family dynamics. Each relationship was distinct from the next. This was especially prevalent in scenes where the characters would argue with each other, showcasing their understanding of these complex relationships. Moreover, the pacing of the play was remarkable and transitions between the show’s several serious and silly situations were smooth. Though some actors’ facial expressions were lost, the blocking was clearly motivated and was fluid throughout.\n\nThe technical elements of the play were well-designed. The set provided a nice playing space for the actors and the props were believable and paid great attention to detail. However, the costumes could have better demonstrated the family’s economic status and the hair and makeup could have more sharply differentiated characters’ age. There were occasional microphone errors but the sound effects, however minimal, were effective.\n\nWith genuine acting and astonishing familial dynamics, Coral Glades High School’s production of “Brighton Beach Memoirs” shows masterful balance between tragedy and comedy, accentuating that, even when it hurts, laughing is always the best medicine.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Savannah Correa of West Broward High School\n\nGrowing up is hard to do, especially as a 15 year old Polish-Jewish American boy in 1937 Brooklyn. In Coral Glades Drama’s production of Brighton Beach Memoirs, we follow Eugene Jerome (Matthew Dell-Hak) in Neil Simon’s semi-autobiographical play based on his early teen years as he documents the trials and tribulations of all things awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nBrighton Beach Memoirs is the first part of playwright Neil Simon’s autobiographical trilogy. In this coming of age comedy, we see the world from our main character Eugene’s perspective in his day to day life with a booming family of seven: strict mother Kate (Tai Beasley), widowed aunt Blanche (Shelby Stott), overworked father Jack (Caleb Ramey), older brother Stanley (Joshua Flynn), and cousins Nora (Julyette Vargas) and Laurie (Heidi Gruenbaum). It debuted on Broadway March 27th, 1983 at the Alvin Theatre, and was picked up once again in 2009 in the Nederlander Theatre. The play is the winner of Tony Awards including Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play and Best Direction of a Play.\n\nThe actors in Coral Glades’ production of Brighton Beach Memoirs had a great sense of sibling dynamics, however the relationship between Stanley and Eugene was the most entertaining to watch unfold. Duet scenes with these two characters played an essential part in some of the most important parts of the story, but was also essential in Eugene learning about less family friendly topics his other family members would not be able to comfortably talk to him about. Dell-Hak’s portrayal of Eugene was more than immersive, providing most of the comedy in the show and was very convincing as a 15 year old boy. As the storyteller it is important to keep your audience intrigued and help the plot move along smoothly, and he did just that.\n\nAs for our supporting characters, Caleb Ramey was very convincing as his role of a father figure, from the authoritative tone in his voice to his mannerisms. Eugene’s father/Uncle Jack is a character the other family members appreciate and look up to due to his kind, hardworking, and generous nature, and Ramey did more than a good job of emphasizing those loving qualities. Kate (Tai Beasley) was extremely convincing as not only a mother, but as an overprotective older sister. One scene in particular that really showcased their ranges was a heated argument involving the three. The actors maintained their intensity with great pacing and physicality, as well as with minor details such as shaking hands and legs, and fidgeting.\n\nFor technical aspects, hair and costumes were very much time accurate. Though there could have been more costume changes to pinpoint economic status and indicate when time has changed, they still managed to add to the plot and their characters and made the setting more believable. Sound was inconsistent at times, but actors powered through with great projection.\n\nNeedless to say, Coral Glades’ production of Brighton Beach Memoirs was a home run. Tune up the radio and get ready to listen to a story you’ll never forget, and prepare to be entertained.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Max Hsu of NSU University School\n\nIn the words of Neil Simon, “If you can go through life without experiencing pain you probably haven’t been born yet.” Coral Glades’ production of Simon’s Brighton Beach Memoirs brilliantly brings to life the struggles and pains of a poor Jewish family in the Great Depression, while contrapuntally telling the coming of age story of a young boy discovering himself as he goes through puberty.\n\nBrighton Beach Memoirs is the first of three quasi-autobiographical plays by acclaimed playwright Neil Simon. First taking the Broadway stage in 1983, it takes place in Brooklyn, New York amidst the Great Depression of the 1930s. The story centers around Eugene Morris Jerome, a teenager who is forced to juggle the insecurities and uncertainties of puberty with the hardships of the pre-war era. As he grows up, his family breaks down, and with a head full of fantasies of naked girls, playing for the New York Yankees, and being a professional writer, he learns to cope with the monotony of life.\n\nThe relationships between the cast as a whole felt incredibly real, as if these characters really were a family with years of history. In moments where the scene focused on one or two characters, those in the background remained in character, helping to immerse the audience into the world. Despite many issues with sound, such as recurring feedback throughout the show and issues with microphones, the cast handled it professionally such that it did not break the audience’s immersion.\n\nMatthew Dell-Hak expertly portrayed the role of Eugene with all the innocence and curiosity that the role demands. While many actors in comedic plays tend to sacrifice believability in favor of humor, Dell-Hak perfectly balanced genuine teenage awkwardness with over the top hilarity. Dell-Hak must also be commended for the growth that he portrayed in his character, as it was evident that each event of the story made an impact on Eugene.\n\nTai Beasley as Eugene’s mother Kate brought a motherly sincerity to the role which helped to counteract the comedy of Eugene. Joshua Flynn (Stanley) displayed impressive range in his acting, having some of the funniest moments in the show as well as some of the most emotional. Caleb Ramsey as Eugene’s father Jack balanced cool-tempered maturity when talking to Stanley with fiery anger in scenes with Kate and Blanche. As Nora, Julyette Vargas had such a contagious enthusiasm that the audience could not help but root for her success.\n\nJamie Metoyer must be commended for her work on costumes, the period correct costumes were crucial to creating the environment of 1930s New York. The use of real food and real lit matches on behalf of props designer Brielle Bickford also helped to draw the audience in, and the student-designed set included some nice touches like a mezuzah on the door frame. The layout of the set was well thought out to serve the purpose of the story.\n\nWhether two brothers are discussing their pubescent sexual awakenings or two sisters having a heated argument about the man across the street, Coral Glades production of Brighton Beach Memoirs remains consistent in its energetic, intimate, and thoroughly hilarious performance.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Jaime Happel of J.P. Taravella High School\n\nEveryone has problems, but when we are blinded by our own troubles, sometimes it is easy to forget that we must take others into consideration. Amidst all the chaos, sometimes blaming those who surround us becomes easier than deciding to do the right thing. Coral Glades Drama’s production of the timeless classic, “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” beautifully balances the harsh realities of life with glimmers of love and playful humor.\n\n“Brighton Beach Memoirs,” a semi-autobiographical play by Neil Simon, dissects the familial struggles of a financially unstable Jewish family residing in New York during the 1930s. The comedy had its Broadway debut in March of 1983 at the Alvin Theatre, and won two Tony Awards later, that same year. The play is the first chapter of what is known as the Eugene trilogy – which also included Simon’s “Biloxi Blues” and “Broadway Bound.” Each play in the trilogy attests to Simon’s unique experiences throughout his early career and life.\n\nMatthew Dell-Hak portrayed Eugene Jerome, a hormonal teen and dedicated Yankees fan that aspires to become a writer. Dell-Hak’s committed character choices, such as his quirky physicality and varying vocal inflection, made him an endearing narrator for Neil Simon’s memoirs. His strong comedic timing elevated interactions between Eugene and his family members, especially with his brother, Stanley (Joshua Flynn). The camaraderie between Flynn and Dell-Hak produced a believable sense of brotherhood that was both heartwarming and relatable.\n\nTruly emphasizing the tension within the Jerome family is Eugene and Stanley’s mother, Kate (Tai Beasley). While Beasley’s captivating character develops throughout the production, her motherly intonation remains a pleasant constant. Kate’s sister, Blanche (Shelby Stott), and husband, Jack (Caleb Ramey), both exhibited powerful emotions accompanied by mature mannerisms in order to authentically distinguish themselves in terms of age. Julyette Vargas and Heidi Gruenbaum depicted Eugene’s cousins, Nora and Laurie respectively. Vargas’ bright energy drove each scene, and Gruenbaum’s demur demeanor complimented her honest character well.\n\nThe cast commendably functioned as a singular unit; even when their characters may have been consumed with their own conflicts, the strength of the family was still evident. The distinct relationships created between each pair of characters were furthered by their interactions in the background of scenes; the ensemble proved that they had a clear understanding of their roles and helped to communicate the riveting complexities of the characters’ family dynamic. There was a great attention to detail from both cast and crew. With the exception of some microphone issues, the show ran rather smoothly. While, at times, there was a lack of variation in lighting, the space was well utilized to invent both an indoor and outdoor environment and the overall atmosphere of the production was enhanced by clean, time-period-appropriate, student-made costumes.\n\nCoral Glades Drama’s production of “Brighton Beach Memoirs” reminds us that although sometimes the hardest decisions may be the most important to make, growing up may be confusing, and life may bring unexpected complications, through it all, family will always be there.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nReviews of Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure at NSU University School on Saturday, 11/09/2019.\n\nBy Cristian Velasquez of Cypress Bay High School\n\nThe responsibilities of an adult are, at times, burdensome and taxing. The temptation of never growing up and being cared for by your mother seems alluring. These themes of growing up and responsibility are addressed beautifully in NSU University School’s whimsical production of “Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure.”\n\nWith music by George Stiles and lyrics by Anthony Drewe, “Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure” opened in Copenhagen in 1996. Based on J. M. Barrie’s play “Peter Pan,” the musical illustrates the importance of motherhood and family as Wendy takes on the task of caring for the Lost Boys. Meanwhile, Peter continues to satisfy his constant craving for adventure, as he ignores the adversities of leaving your childhood behind him and growing up.\n\nIn his portrayal of the fervent Peter Pan, Evan Eiglarsh remarkably embodies the youthful spirit and infectious energy of his character. Eiglarsh’s impeccable comedic timing made his overall performance all the more compelling. Charmed by Peter’s charismatic disposition, Nicolette Nunziato must also be commended for her exceptional performance as the motherly Wendy Darling. Nunziato’s crisp vocals shone through wonderfully in her stunning rendition of “Just Beyond the Stars (Reprise).” Her characterization choices and consistency in her accent further immersed the audience into the world of Peter Pan.\n\nPortraying the infamous Captain Hook, Anthony Langone’s impressive vocal range, demonstrated in his musical numbers, contributed considerably to his dynamic temperament. Langone flawlessly executed Hook’s physicality and intonation, vividly bringing his character to life. Gabriel Feldenkrais, portraying Smee, brought an infectious comedic aspect to the production in contrast to Langone’s generally serious disposition. Feldenkrais delivered a humorous interpretation of the character through his over the top gestures and comical dancing. The chemistry between the two rapscallions was especially prevalent in the song “A Pirate With a Conscience.”\n\nAn outstanding ensemble amidst the production was the Lost Boys of Neverland. Their primitive physicality complemented their boisterous natures, especially in their song “The Lost Boys Gang,” which the female ensemble must be commended for, as they sang it in the male key. A particularly notable performance was that of Alina Macaulay, the Storyteller, who commanded the stage with her excellent stage presence and clear delivery of her lines. Although energy was lacking at times, the chemistry between the ensemble members boosted it anew.\n\nAlong with the performance aspects, the technical aspects of the performance worked together remarkably as well. The costume and makeup designers must be accredited for their research on Native American culture, as their interpretation of the costumes and makeup for the Braves modernized the stereotypical portrayal of Native Americans in earlier productions of this show. The crew and stage management must also be recognized for their fluid scenic transitions and accuracy on the numerous lighting and sound cues in the production, despite minor sound discrepancies.\n\nNSU University School’s production of “Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure” discusses the difficulty of letting go of your childhood and taking on the responsibilities of an adult through two hours of sheer entertainment and a journey “Just Beyond the Stars.”\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Rylee Berger of Cooper City High School\n\nClose your eyes – close them tight – and imagine. Imagine a world full of fairies, of sirens, of pirates and captains. Of the spunky young girl and the lost little boys as they set off in adventurous fashion. Find yourself at NSU University School’s production of “Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure,” a noteworthy and original production filled with high-flying performances.\n\nBased on J.M. Barrie’s beloved tale, the show opened in Copenhagen in 1996. It was later broadcast by the BBC and earned poor reviews until its well-received 2007 revision. Written by Willis Hall with music and lyrics by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, the musical follows the title character (Evan Eiglarsh) and Wendy (Nicolette Nunziato) as they navigate their new friendship, Neverland, and the adventure of growing up.\n\nAs Peter, Eiglarsh embodied the iconic character with grace, showing vocal and emotional range. Eiglarsh had stellar comedic timing, bringing mischievous youthfulness to the boy who wouldn’t grow up. He had a commanding stage presence and clear commitment to his character which was showcased in numbers like “Never Land” and “The Cleverness of Me.” His spectacular chemistry with Wendy and the Lost Boys added a layer of believability to his already stellar performance. Nunziato’s Wendy was played with an unmatched conviction. Her outstanding vocals and clear understanding of her character shone, making for a remarkable performance. Both Eiglarsh and Nunziato were required to perform while being flown, a commendable feat accomplished with ease.\n\nDynamic duo Captain Hook (Anthony Langone) and Smee (Gabriel Feldenkrais) did not disappoint, adding hilarity and support to the production. Langone’s impressive vocal range was showcased in the song “When I Kill Peter Pan,” and his charisma was apparent throughout his portrayal of the pirate. Feldenkrais quickly established his relationship to Hook, creating a character with unparalleled energy and precision. His dance skills stood out in “A Pirate with a Conscience;” his commitment to his character was evident. Additionally, Peter Koltis’ portrayal of Gentleman Starkey deserves note for its focus and believability.\n\nAs a whole, the cast did an outstanding job in creating the whimsical, storytelling tone that is so necessary for such a production. The ensembles were distinct in their movements and motivations, providing entertaining and easily distinguished performances. This was aided by choreographer Bailey Busher’s use of movement motifs for each character group. Despite vocals that were occasionally inconsistent, the ensemble was focused and engaged, helping to create the magical world of Neverland.\n\nFurther contributing to this were efforts from the technical teams. Though all of the design elements were well-thought-out, the props team deserves specific praise for their attention to detail and innovation. The stage management team ran cues flawlessly and the seemingly effortless transitions added to the quality of the show.\n\nNSU University School brings new life to a classic story in their not-to-be-missed rendition of “Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure,” a production filled with extraordinary performances and original designs that is sure to remind you that life really is “One Big Adventure.”\n\n*** *** ***\n\nBy Dylan Jost of North Broward Preparatory School\n\n“Second star to the right and straight on ’til morning,” off to Neverland! Filled with swampy lagoons, underground hideouts, and towering pirate ships, NSU University School’s production of “Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure” brought to life a land of mirth and fantasy.\n\nWith a captivating book by Willis Hall and dazzling music and lyrics by Geroge Stiles and Anthony Drewe, “Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure” opened in Copenhagen in 1996. Based on J.M. Barrie’s classic play, the musical chronicles the story of the mischievous Peter Pan and sweet Wendy Darling, recruited by the former to nurture a gaggle of kooky Lost Boys. On their journey through magical Neverland, the heroes must work together to navigate the dangers presented by the malicious Captain Hook and his crew and, ultimately, address the omnipresent part of childhood – growing up.\n\nIn the titular role, Evan Eiglarsh delivered a solid performance as the spirited Peter Pan. Encapsulating the naivety of his character, Eiglarsh’s voice was laced with youthful innocence as he spoke with clarity. His stage presence was graced with boundless energy epitomizing Peter’s state of eternal childhood. Nicolette Nunziato was wholly convincing in her portrayal of the kind and gentle Wendy Darling. She provided a calming presence, all the while maintaining an air of authority over her charges. Nunziato’s vocals were also commendable, particularly in “One Big Adventure.”\n\nA performance that must be mentioned is that of Anthony Langone as Captain Hook. Langone seamlessly alternated between brutal buccaneer and whimpering coward, with mannerisms that were appropriately exaggerated and highly entertaining. Langone’s vibrato and timbre were engaging and memorable, particularly in “A Pirate with a Conscience.” Alongside Langone was Gabriel Feldenkrais as Smee, Hook’s sentimental and often mistreated first mate. Feldenkrais mastered the use of physical comedy through his hilarious portrayal of the bumbling Smee, w"
