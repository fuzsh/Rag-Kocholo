        "text": "A Marriage Made In Heaven\n\nBob Martin, The Drowsy Chaperone and The National Alliance of Musical Theatre (NAMT)\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone's origins are the makings of modern musical legend. It all started when Second City, (Toronto based sketch comedy and improv company) performers Bob Martin and Janet Van De Graaff fell in love, got engaged and asked their songwriter friend Lisa Lambert to be a best man at their wedding. Instead of the traditional stripper-laden bachelor party Lampert enlisted Don McKellar, Greg Morrison and a team of theatrically-minded colleagues to create and perform a 40-minute original musical called The Drowsy Chaperone and named the lead characters ‘Bob Martin’ and ‘Janet Van De Graaff’ (the show’s bride and groom). After the presentation, Bob joined his cast of friends on stage and, now famously, quipped: “What a wonderful show. I have some notes.” Those notes would be the beginnings of the “Man in Chair,” the character who sets the framework for, The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nWith no source material for their story-within-a-story to provide a template for them, except for the early Marx Brothers or Fred and Ginger movies that they loved, the four writers developed their totally original “musical within a comedy” at the Toronto Fringe Festival. It was an instant hit. When New York producer Roy Miller saw it, he immediately secured the rights. However, when he tried to share the script with his colleagues, no one would read it because of the title. So, Miller decided to present a staged reading in New York at NAMT (National Alliance for Musical Theatre).\n\nThe National Alliance for Musical Theatre, is a national organization dedicated to advancing musical theatre by nurturing the creation, development, production and presentation of new musicals. The Ogunquit Playhouse is among the 150 members that include some of the leading producers of musical theatre throughout 34 states and abroad. Once a year, these industry leaders come together in New York to shape the future of musical theatre – part of this process is the Festival of New Musicals. Among the many musicals launched by the annual Festival are Thoroughly Modern Millie, Children of Eden, Honk!, Songs for a New World, I Love You Because, Vanities and of course, The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nMiller invited Kevin McCollum and other colleagues to the NAMT Festival of New Musicals to witness Bob Martin’s show. It sold them! Later that night Miller and McCollum were having dinner with Martin, Don McKellar, Greg Morrison and Lisa Lambert to talk about the hilarious show with the terrible title. For the next several months, they searched for a directors. McCollum suggested Casey Nicholaw, whom he had worked with before and who was busy choreographing Spamalot. Once Spamalot opened on Broadway, Nicholaw joined the team with a completely fresh and newly energized take on the show.\n\nThe material was really entertaining, said Nicholaw. But we all realized it was about fleshing out the show-within-a-show a little bit more. We knew that Man In Chair’s material was strong, but we needed to work out the numbers and make the show dance more…We wanted the show to seem less like a sketch and more like a full-blown musical – to bring to Broadway.\n\nThe show opened on Broadway on 1 May, 2006 at the Marquis Theatre and went on to win the most Tony Awards of any musical that year!\n\nAccording to McCollum, “A musical should start on the earth and end in the heavens.” With The Drowsy Chaperone, it does exactly that. A show that began as a celebration of love, that in turn celebrates the love of musical theatre - it’s no surprise that audiences are laughing, cheering and, in the end, being moved as well.\n\nCARSON KRESSLEY (Man in Chair) Designer/Author/Actor. Emmy-winning television star, celebrity stylist, author and fashion designer, Carson Kressley is out to make over the world! Kressley earned a prime-time Emmy, television's highest honor, for his work on the break out Bravo network hit, \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" as well as critical acclaim as Host and Co-Executive Producer of Lifetime's highest rated debut reality show, \"How to Look Good Naked,\" and this summer he can be seen starring in ABC's \"True Beauty.\" Kressley has also been the star of the WB series \"Crowned\" and co-starred in Universal Films major studio release, \"The Perfect Man\" and opposite John Goodman in NBC's \"The Year Without A Santa Claus.\" In addition to his work in television, Kressley was the host of the 2008 True Colors Tour with Cyndi Lauper and the B52's. The tour was created to raise awareness and promote equality for the GLBT community. He is also a New York Times best-selling author with three books to his credit, including \"You're Different, And That's Super!\", a kids book promoting diversity and tolerance. A strong supporter of many philanthropic causes, Kressley uses his celebrity to advance many different concerns such as The Trevor Project, The Human Rights Campaign, The Empire State Pride Agenda, LIGALY, GLSEN, AIDS WALK, and the Al D. Rodriguez Liver Foundation.

This new musical comedy was the darling of the Tony Awards, winning the most statues in 2006, including Best Sets and Costumes - the very same sets and costumes will be featured in the Ogunquit Production! This uproarious musical is starring Bravo’s top-rated star, Carson Kressley as the Man in Chair, alongside Georgia Engel, Georgette from the smash TV hit “The Mary Tyler Moore Show.” Engel is reprising the role of Mrs. Tottendale, the role she created for the original Broadway production. Broadway veteran Liz Larsen also joins the cast as The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nThis show-within-a-show begins when a die-hard musical fan, Kressley, imagines performers coming to life in his shabby apartment whenever he plays his favorite cast album, a 1928 hit called \"The Drowsy Chaperone.\" Throughout the performance the musical bursts to life as the Man in Chair continuously brings the audience in and out of the fantasy. Audiences are instantly immersed in the glamorous, hilarious tale of a celebrity bride and her uproarious wedding day, complete with thrills and surprises that take both the cast and the audience soaring into the rafters.\n\nHelming the Ogunquit production as Director is Casey Hushionwho worked under Casey Nicholaw on the original Broadway show. Among her many Broadway and national credits, she is the Assistant Director of In The Heights, winner of 4 Tony Awards including Best Musical, for both the Broadway and the National Tour. Casey is currently the Associate Director of the Broadway workshop of Elf and recently worked as Associate Director of the new musical Minsky’s at the Ahmanson Theatre. She is also currently the Artistic Director of the North Carolina theatre.\n\nCarson Kressley is probably best known for his Emmy Award winning work on the breakout Bravo network hit, \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" as well as for hosting Lifetime's highest rated and critically acclaimed reality show, \"How to Look Good Naked.\"\n\nGeorgia Engel is best known to audiences as Georgette Baxter from the “Mary Tyler Moore Show,” for which she received two Emmy nominations. Georgia launched her theatrical career playing Minnie Fay in Hello, Dolly! with Ethel Merman and has gone on to a very successful Broadway and Television career. In addition to “MTM” she starred in four more television series, most notably as Shirley Burleigh in the ABC comedy, “Coach.”\n\nLiz Larsen was last seen in Ogunquit as Miss Adelaide in the smash hit Guys and Dolls. This Tony Award, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle nominated actress has appeared in many Broadway productions including Damn Yankees, A Little Night Music and Fiddler on the Roof. Her television appearances include “Law and Order, Special Victims Unit,” “Third Watch,” “Sopranos” and “Sex and the City.”\n\nThe Ogunquit Playhouse season continues with The Sound of Music, starring Rex Smith, June 30 through July 24; Sunset Boulevard, July 28 through August 14; Monty Python's Spamalot, August 18 through September 11; Chicago, wraps up the Playhouse season, September 15 through October 24 featuring Sally Struthers in the roll of Matron “Mama” Morton.\n\nThe Man in Chair, a mousy, agoraphobic Broadway fanatic, seeking to cure his \"non-specific sadness\", listens to a recording of the fictional 1928 musical comedy, The Drowsy Chaperone. As he listens to this rare recording, the characters appear in his dingy apartment, and it is transformed into an impressive Broadway set with seashell footlights, sparkling furniture, painted backdrops, and glitzy costumes. Man in Chair provides a running commentary throughout the show.\n\nIn the opening number, \"Fancy Dress\", the premise and characters of the show are introduced: it's the day of the wedding of oil tycoon Robert Martin and Broadway star Janet Van De Graaff, who plans to give up her career for married life. Those in attendance include aging hostess Mrs. Tottendale; her loyal employee known only as Underling; Robert's best man, George; Broadway producer Feldzieg, who is hoping to persuade Janet to forgo marriage and continue starring in Feldzieg's Follies; ditzy flapper Kitty, who hopes to take Janet's place in the Follies; two gangsters disguised as pastry chefs; self-proclaimed famed Latin lover Aldolpho; Janet's alcoholic Chaperone, who is supposed to keep her away from Robert until the wedding; and Trix, a female aviator.\n\nThe gangsters reveal to Feldzieg that their boss has invested in the Follies and wants to make sure the show is a financial success, which it presumably will not be without Janet. They tell Feldzieg that he must sabotage the wedding and make sure Janet stays in show business. Feldzieg enlists the vain, easily manipulated Aldolpho to seduce Janet and spoil her relationship with Robert. Meanwhile, in his room, Robert realizes that he is nervous about the wedding. To get rid of his \"Cold Feets\", he tap dances, and George, who is also nervous, joins in the dance. George notes that tap dancing could be injurious, so he suggests that Robert go roller skating in the garden instead, while wearing a blindfold to keep him from seeing Janet. Outside by the pool, Janet tells reporters that she is happy to be getting married and obstensibly doesn't want to be an actress anymore (\"Show Off\"), but her song evolves into a big production number.\n\nIn Janet's room, Janet is having doubts about whether Robert really loves her, and she asks the Chaperone for advice. The Chaperone responds with the extemporaneous \"As We Stumble Along\", a \"rousing anthem to alcoholism\", which, Man in Chair explains, the original actress playing the Chaperone insisted on including in the show. More helpfully, the chaperone tells Janet that she is feeling \"drowsy\" and must take a nap, giving Janet the opportunity to ask Robert if he loves her. Janet leaves for the garden, and Aldolpho enters, mistaking the Chaperone for Janet. The Chaperone happily pretends to be Janet and allows Aldolpho to \"seduce\" her (\"I Am Aldolpho\"). Janet meets the blindfolded and roller-skating Robert in the garden, and she pretends to be a French woman, \"Mimi\". She asks Robert how he met his bride, and he describes their lovestruck first meeting (\"Accident Waiting to Happen\"). Carried away by his emotions, Robert kisses \"Mimi\" because she seems just like Janet. Janet furiously storms off because Robert has \"kissed a strange French girl\".\n\nKitty, hoping to take Janet's place in the Follies, tries to demonstrate her mind-reading talents to Feldzieg, but he is unimpressed. The gangsters confront Feldzieg, threatening him with a murderous \"Toledo Surprise\" because he has not yet succeeded in cancelling the wedding. Feldzieg distracts them by insisting that they actually have singing and dancing talent, and they turn \"Toledo Surprise\" into an upbeat dance number. Aldolpho, with the Chaperone on his arm, announces that he has seduced the bride and the wedding is therefore cancelled, but Feldzieg angrily tells him he has seduced the wrong woman. Janet announces that she is cancelling the wedding, and Robert protests in vain that he only kissed \"Mimi\" because she reminded him of Janet.\n\nMan in Chair announces that this is the end of the first act and the first record of the two-record set. He puts on another record, saying that the audience can listen to the opening of the second act of The Drowsy Chaperone, and leaves for the restroom. A scene set in an oriental palace appears onstage, with characters in stereotypical oriental costumes and the chaperone costumed as an Englishwoman in a hoopskirted dress (\"Message from A Nightingale\"). Man in Chair hurriedly stops the record, explaining to the audience that that was the wrong record—it was the musical The Enchanted Nightingale, not the second act of The Drowsy Chaperone. He finds the right record, and The Drowsy Chaperone continues.\n\nIn a musical dream sequence, Janet laments her lost romance and decides to return to the stage (\"Bride's Lament\"). Mrs. Tottendale tells Underling that the wedding will proceed as planned because \"Love is Always Lovely\" in the end. She reveals to Underling that she is in love with him. The Chaperone announces that there will be a wedding after all: she and Aldolpho are getting married. Mrs. Tottendale announces that she and Underling are getting married as well. Robert tells Janet that he loves her, and she admits that she was really the French girl and agrees to marry him. To appease the gangsters, Feldzieg tells them that he has discovered a new star: Kitty. He asks her to demonstrate her mind-reading talent, and when she \"reads Feldzieg's mind\", she announces that he is asking her to marry him.\n\nGeorge, now best man for all four weddings, realizes that he has failed at his most important task: finding a minister. Trix lands her plane in the garden, announcing she is about to depart for Rio. Because a captain on board a ship can perform marriages, everyone rationalizes that Trix, as a pilot, can perform marriages on board a plane, and she can fly them all to Rio for their honeymoons (\"I Do, I Do in the Sky\").\n\nAs the record is about to play the show's final chord, the power goes out in Man in Chair's apartment, and a Superintendent arrives to check the circuit breakers. The power returns, and the final chord plays. Alone in his apartment, a disappointed Man in Chair begins singing \"As We Stumble Along\" and is gradually joined by the cast of The Drowsy Chaperone, who cheer him (\"As We Stumble Along (Reprise)\").\n\n- From Wikipedia"
