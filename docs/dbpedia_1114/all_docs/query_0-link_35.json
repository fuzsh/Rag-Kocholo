        "text": "ELEPHANT\n\nBENCHMARK THEATRE: 10/8-10/30\n\nA world premiere Devised Work, Developed by Abner Genece, Candace Joice and Neil Truglio\n\nL-R: Dan O'Neill and Nnamdi K. Nwankwo\n\nLet me just say at the get-go that Benchmark Theatre’s ELEPHANT is the most important new work to have been seen by this reviewer in memory.\n\nUsing a timely truism, Benchmark builds a metaphor for racial bigotry upon the current expression: “elephant in the room.”\n\nHanging loosely upon the armature of your memories of the play/movie, “The Elephant Man,” the contrasts in this production outweigh the comparisons by far.\n\nThe Merrick of this play is not misshapen or disfigured in any way. Indeed, he is a tall, handsome, muscular black man. Articulate and dignified in his speech and demeanor, he is seen to have more knowledge of Shakespeare and the Bible than either the self-aggrandizing Frederick Treves or the publicity-seeking Madge Kendal.\n\nNnamdi K. Nwankwo’s performance as John Merrick is utterly and brilliantly natural.\n\nNew to this reviewer, Courtney Esser is luminous as the hypocritical socialite Madge Kendal.\n\nDan O’Neill exhibits the onstage excellence we have come to expect of him as know-it-all Frederick Treves, doctor and intellectual a la side show hawker.\n\nBoth Mr. O’Neill and Ms. Esser perform their characters in such a way as to hold up the mirror to the appalling, nightmarish nature of white supremacy regarding the abuse, negligence and exploitation of black people. Their performances illuminate the ignorant ‘unnaturalness’ of those who have sometimes been referred to as “the deplorables.”\n\nYou don’t have to be a student of neuro linguistic programming to recall what a shock to the nervous system it is to see the swirl of red and blue lights in the rear-view mirror accompanied by a wailing siren. The nervous system goes on high alert accompanied by a clenched stomach. Why? No one likes to get a speeding ticket. And what if you had a glass of wine with dinner? Additional stress.\n\nNow imagine the exponentialized stress a black man or woman experiences with the lights and siren, when the possibility of death hangs in the balance.\n\nIt is this degree of awareness that ELEPHANT drives home in multiple ways; not the least of which is the excellence of its sound (Marc Stith) and lighting designs.\n\nElephant asks us not only to observe these atrocities, but to feel them, and to engage in creating change.\n\nThis is a rich work that makes a reviewer hold back from unleashing spoilers and describing this new work in too great of detail. You deserve the freedom to experience it for yourself.\n\nELEPHANT is powerful social commentary and what this reviewer regards as Great Art. It was an honor to see it.\n\nBenchmark Theatre is located at 1560 Teller Street in Lakewood. For tickets call 303-519-9059 or go online at www.benchmarktheatre.com\n\nFive Guys Named Moe\n\nVintage Theatre: August 13-29\n\nThe cast of Five Guys Named Moe (Photo credit: RDG Photography)\n\nRUN TO GET TICKETS FOR “FIVE GUYS NAMED MOE,” AND LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!!!\n\nVintage Theatre’s exhilarating production of “Five Guys Named Moe,” is the perfect antidote for the depression brought on by the five o’clock news, the pandemic and the political state of the world.\n\nThis revue showcases the work of American jazz saxophonist, band leader and composer, Louis Jordan. In the 1940s and early 50s, Jordan’s Rhythm and Blues classics paved the way for what would soon be known as rock n’ roll.\n\nKnown as “the King of the Jukebox,” just a few of the twenty some Louis Jordan songs you'll fall in love with in this astonishing ‘juke box musical’ are: “Let the Good Times Roll,” “Choo Choo Ch’Boogie,” “Caldonia,” and “Ain’t Nobody Here But Us Chickens.” By the time this talented ensemble gets to “Is You Is, Or is You Ain’t My Baby?,” your bones will be movin’ around in your seat so much, you may just be tempted to get up and start boogeyin’ in the aisles.\n\nAS the story goes our hero Nomax (Micah Lawrence), is up drinking and trying unsuccessfully to reach his paramour by phone in the wee hours of the morning. Nomax falls deeper into depression until suddenly out of his radio appear: Big Moe (Michael Batemen), Eat Moe(Josiah Peters), Little Moe(Ronald McQueen), Four-Eyed Moe(Jalen Gregory) and No Moe(Kenyan James Bernard.) They all have ideas for what will make him succeed better with his girlfriend…and with life in general. Every one of these actors is a brilliant singer/dancer!!!\n\nChristopher Page-Sanders unleashes a dazzling display of choreography the likes of which we have not seen in ages! Page-Sanders also co-directs the show with Denver favorite Lee Ann Scherlong! How does it get any better than that?\n\nA tip of the hat to Dr. Michael Williams, who is not only responsible for the excellent music direction but produces some virtuosic tickling of the keys as well.\n\nFive Guys Named Moe won Olivier Awards for Best Entertainment and Best Choreographer in 1991 and was nominated for Tony Awards for Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical the following year.\n\nVintage Theatre presents\n\n“Five Guys Named Moe”\n\nA musical featuring the works of jazz legend Louis Jordan.\n\nAugust 13 – Aug 29\n\n$20 - $38\n\n303-856-7830 or online at www.vintagetheatre.org\n\nVintage Theatre, 1468 Dayton St., Aurora 80010\n\nRunning time 2 hours with intermission.\n\nRecommended for all ages.\n\nRIGOLETTO\n\nL-R: ALISA JORDHEIM and ALEKSEY BOGDONAV ( Photo credit: Amanda Tipton)\n\nCENTRAL CITY OPERA\n\nat Hudson Gardens\n\n(Playing in repertoire with Rodgers and Hammerstein’s CAROUSEL now through August 1)\n\nCentral City Opera’s production of RIGOLETTO is an engrossing, ear-pleasing evening of Grand Opera!\n\nALEKSEY BOGDANOV’s astonishingly powerful baritone gives us a RIGOLETTO that’s astounding!!!\n\nAs the Duke of Mantua, GALEANO SALAS’s sensational rendition of “La Donna e mobile” will resound in your head for days.\n\nSoprano ALISA JORDHEIM delivers GILDA’s arias in such a way as to intoxicate us with auditory champagne.\n\nJOHN PAUL HUCKLE’s performance in the role of the assassin, SPARFUCILE, chills us to the bone.\n\nRIGOLETTO, Verdi’s three-act opera, debuted in Venice in 1851. The libretto is by Francesco Maria Piave, and based on Victor Hugo’s “Le Roi s”Amuse.” Rigoletto is significant in that it is the opera in the composer’s ‘middle period,’ that proves a turning point in Italian opera history. In this finest music-drama since the days of Monteverdi, the title role is considered by many to be the most demanding ever penned for a baritone. Breaking through the operatic conventions of its time, RIGOLETTO was an immediate success.\n\nSet in 16th century Mantua, the hunchbacked court jester Rigoletto makes fun of the rage of the old Count Monterone, whose daughter has been seduced by the devious Duke.\n\nMonterone curses Rigoletto, and the courtiers who hate Rigoletto, discover that he has a young lady who’s hidden in his home.\n\nNot realizing that Gilda is the court jester’s daughter, they abduct her, and the duke, posing as a poor student, seduces her. When Rigoletto hires the assassin Sparfucile, to get his revenge, Gilda, who is in love with the duke, maneuvers herself into a place in which she is killed in his stead.\n\nDirector Jose Maria Condemi has done a great job in casting and pacing this production of Verdi’s opera for the most part. However…one might wish that he had cast an actor who appeared to be much older than Phillip Lopez in the role of Count Monterone, the man who curses Rigoletto.\n\nWhat to expect: Powerful vocals, superb conducting by Maestro JOHN BARIL of the outstanding Central City Opera Orchestra, and minimalism on the technical end of things. There is a contemporary costume design by EDINA HISER, a minimalist set design by Steven C. Kemp suggestive of a present-day country club, and mostly ambient lighting due to the show being presented in an outdoor setting. (One can’t wait to once again experience Master Lighting Designer David Martin Jacques’ exquisite Art ‘inside’ next year when the Central City Opera House opens its doors once again.)\n\nRun to get tickets!!!\n\nCall 303-292-6700 or go online at centralcityopera.org\n\nThe 2021 Central City Opera Summer Festival\n\nMake History and discover unforgettable performances with Central City Opera in the Gardens!\n\nThe 2021 Central City Opera Summer Festival is happening this year at Hudson Gardens.\n\nIn a recent phone call, Pat Pearce, Central City Opera’s General/Artistic Director, spoke about the wonderful opportunity we have in getting to see and hear the 2021 Central City Opera Summer Festival at the Hudson Gardens on South Santa Fe Drive in Littleton.\n\nMost people are aware that Hudson Gardens will usually seat 3200 people. At present only 500 will be allowed inside the Gardens for the operas due to Covid. Hopefully, as restrictions ease, more seats might become available.\n\nThe shows run 90 to 110 minutes with no intermission to make sure that people do not gather in large groups.\n\nPearce said that “National Jewish Hospital is helping with instructing the management at the Gardens in how best to keep everyone safe. There will be social distancing and masking.”\n\nPearce went on to say, “the orchestra will be situated behind the stage, socially distanced and behind plexiglass.\n\nFrom staging to seating this outdoor production, we had to rethink everything about how to safely present the show. Everyone onstage will be vaccinated.\n\nThey’re setting up chairs for Section A. Sections B and C will be basically on lawn with blanket or patrons will have brought their own lawn chairs.\n\nThey have been doing everything possible to keep musicians, singers and audience safe with regard to transmission via aerosol. A whole protocol has been put into place. There will be “a moat” between the audience and the stage.”\n\nThe instruments and singers will be amplified this year. That is to say they will be ‘miked’ due to being outside.\n\nGiuseppe Verdi’s “Rigoletto” will be sung in Italian, with surtitles embedded above the actors/singers, atop the physicality of the set.\n\n“Rigoletto” is chock full of mistaken identity, revenge, and signature arias, such as ‘La donna e mobile.’\n\nPearce gave high praise to the actors and directors who will be involved in this history-making summer festival.\n\nIn speaking of baritone Alexey Bogdanov, who will portray Rigoletto, Pearce said, “Over the years I’ve gotten to hear a lot of people sing the role. It’s been a tour de force for the great baritones ever since Verdi wrote it, a century and a half ago. It really allows them to show off. I heard Alexey sing for me in New York at an audition and he was spectacular. He has the kind of instrument that has a lot of color and bite. That’s the kind of thing a singer needs to have in his arsenal for singing Verdi. He also has the look and the swagger.\n\nAlisa Jordheim is Gilda. She’s a wonderful soprano who was in the training program at Central City and also played the sister of the young boy in “The Turn of the Screw.” Petite and beautiful, she’s very talented vocally and a very good actor into the bargain.”\n\nGaleano Salas gets to unleash his great tenor on those spectacular arias Verdi wrote for the Duke of Mantua. John Paul Huckle will portray the assassin, Sparafucile.\n\nIt looks like “Rigoletto”’s going to be old home week since the Duke, Gilda and Sparafucile are all past apprentices.\n\nJohn Baril is the music director/conductor for Rigoletto.\n\n“Rigoletto”’s stage director will be Jose Maria Condemi, who directed Emily Pulley the last time she was here in “Carmen,” as well as directing “Florencia en el Amazonas” for Opera Colorado. Jose spends a good deal of time at San Francisco Opera Conservatory.\n\nKen Cazan will direct Carousel. Ken loves this period. He was a great success directing Oklahoma, A Little Night Music and West Side Story. Cazan’s direction of Benjamin Britten’s Billy Budd in 2019 was enormously successful due to his being able to tell the story with a sort of deep clarity.\n\nAnna Christy is Julie Jordan in Carousel. She’s a really great actor as well as singer. Having debuted as Titania in the 2002 production of Benjamin Britten’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream, she played Emily in “Our Town.” She also starred in the most recent production of “The Ballad of Baby Doe.”\n\nPhyllis Pancella will play Nettie Fowler in “Carousel.” Featured in the casts of “Our Town” and “Rinaldo,” she was also Nerone in Monteverdi’s “The Coronation of Poppea,” as well as the superb Lucretia in the CCO production of Britten’s “Rape of Lucretia.”\n\nThis will be Steve LaBrie’s Central City Opera debut as Billy Bigelow in “Carousel.” LaBrie is a young up-and-coming baritone, who also sings Verdi. He had been put on hold for something before Covid, so when this opportunity arose, he was cast.\n\nJennifer DeDominici portrays Carrie Pipperidge in “Carousel.” She has great presence and can really build a memorable character.\n\nDavid Jacques designed the set for “Carousel” as well as the lighting. His incredible lighting, which takes a front seat with us, is going to be a lot more challenging and “interesting” with daylight.\n\nIn answer to a question about the look of the show, Pearce said,”We have created a unit set with several levels in order to have multiple playing spaces in which to present the shows.\n\nRigoletto has basically moved in time. It could be contemporary or possibly the 1970s. Something along those lines. Carousel is non-time specific. Here the focus is on clear storytelling using Rodgers’ glorious music to enhance it.”\n\nDon’t forget that “Dido and Aeneas” is being presented in the gardens outside the opera house in Central City this summer. So, everything is outside this year.\n\nThe opera company is currently in the process of creating how things will be if there is inclement weather. They’ll be handling things in much the same way as Red Rocks and other outdoor concert venues with regard to when it would be necessary to “call” the show.\n\nNext year will be Central City Opera’s 90th Anniversary. Pearce promises to let us know as soon as the board makes a solid decision on the operas they’ll be producing then.\n\nThe suggested arrival time is at least thirty minutes before showtime so people will have plenty of time to select their seats. Doors will open one hour before the performance.\n\nFree parking is available on a first come, first serve basis, and is only a short walk to the performance area. Limited reserved parking can be purchased for five dollars (based on availability.) ADA parking is also available. Please contact the Box Office for more information.\n\nPeople will be allowed to bring food and non-alcoholic beverages into the venue.\n\nAnd don’t forget that Hudson Gardens is located near lots of great restaurants for pre and post-show cocktails and meals.\n\nSee you at the Opera!!!\n\nINTERMISSION IS OVER AT BDT STAGE!\n\nBDT STAGE is slated to reopen on April 2, 2021. Michael J. Duran has declared that “intermission is over, and everybody may return to their seats.” It’s been a year since “Ragtime” opened and closed on the same evening due to COVID -19.\n\nSince COVID numbers are looking good in Colorado and the vaccine is getting injected into people’s arms, the BDT Stage family is ready and raring to do what they do best.
