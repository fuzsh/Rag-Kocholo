        "text": "Directed by Matt Crowle\n\nMusical Direction by Valerie Maze\n\nSponsored by Alibi Marina & Harbor Guest House with support from The Cordon Family Foundation\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is a delightfully smart and funny Jazz Age musical with show-stopping song and dance numbers.\n\nThis musical comedy spoofs, but still pays loving homage to, the frothy American musicals of the Jazz Age. A musical theater uber-fan seeks to cure his melancholy by listening to a rare recording of his favorite show, a fictional 1928 musical comedy, The Drowsy Chaperone. As the album plays, his sparse apartment transforms into a glittering Broadway set, and he is, himself, gleefully transported into the musical. As the orchestra plays, we meet an attractive young couple on the eve of their wedding, a harried best man, a Broadway impresario, an absent-minded dowager, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a ditzy chorus girl, a very misguided Don Juan and a tipsy chaperone. Sit back and enjoy this smart, silly, bubbly and entertaining fictional gem from the Golden Age of musical theater.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is the winner of five Tony Awards (including Best Book and Best Original Score) and seven Drama Desk Awards."
