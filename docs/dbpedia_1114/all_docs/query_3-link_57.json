        "text": "May 9, 2011\n\nI just saw my local community theatre's performance of this this weekend. Wonderful! I didn't know anything about this show, and assumed it was a dusty old dated farce revived simply for its pure silliness. I was almost right. It is in fact new (2007), and it is a deeply resonant examination of the draw of all those old, silly stereotyped mid-century musicals to a disenfranchised (i.e. gay) audience. Man in Chair entertains us with an invitation into his New York City apartment and a listen to one of his favorite records (yes, records) of the fictitious 1928 musical comedy, The Drowsy Chaperone. He skips through to his favorite scenes, all of which are utterly politically incorrect, trite, or just plain ridiculous, and explains why he loves them anyway. Of course we have the ubiquitous torch song by the aging diva, singing a tribute to alcoholism (hello, Judy, Ethel!), the overly-sentimental ballad to lost love (kiss kiss, Tallulah!), the flaming homosexual playing the lead male love interest (hey there, Billy Haines!), and we even get a visit from lesbian Trix the Aviatrix (Is that you, Amelia?) Man in Chair peppers the performance with laugh-out-loud commentary, both on the action of the musical and a current interpretation of it. With tongue in cheek, Man says, \"Theatre was the only place that dumb people could make a living -- before television.\" This show had me both laughing giddily and understanding a bit better just what it is about musical comedy, actors, and the theatre itself that I treasure so much.\n\nDecember 1, 2011\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone takes place in a man’s modern-day apartment. It starts out with him talking about his non-specific sadness, a state that he calls “blue”. He gets away from his sadness and anxiety by listening to his music. He is very old fassioned in character and enjoys listening to old records. He talks about his favorite record called The Drowsy Chaperone which involves “mix-ups, mayhem, and a gay wedding!” He plays the record, and the musical comes to life in his apartment with the man making comments and singing along throughout. Because it is just a sound recording, the whole musical is interpreted through his imagination. The Drowsy Chaperone (the play that the man is listening to) is about a big Broadway star, Janet Van De Graff, getting married to Robert Martin. Janet says that when she gets married, she is going to give up her life on the stage. Her producer, Mr. Feldzieg knows that when he loses his leading lady, “Feldzieg’s Follies” is not going to exist anymore. He hires Aldolpho, the Latin “King of Romance” to seduce Janet so that the wedding will get called off. Janet, wondering if Robert really loves her, leaves the bridal suite looking for him. Aldolpho runs into the bridal suite searching for Janet, but the only one in the room is the constantly drunken chaperone who tricks Aldolpho into thinking that she is the bride thus Aldolpho makes love to the wrong woman. Throughout the show, Robert and Janet’s wedding is constantly being called off then called back on. Everyone ends up getting married at the end. The show ends, and the man is sitting in his chair and talking about how a musical can take you away from the horrors of everyday life.\n\nI rated it 5 stars because I would still laugh my head off after reading the script, and performing it multiple times. “The point of a musical is to take you away to a place that always works out well in the end.” This quote is said by the man at the end of the show after talking about the flaws and lame-ness of the show. This quote shows the hidden desire of the man and how he can feel like everything is fine when he listens to his musical records.\n\n“Aldolpho will make love to the bride! That will show people Aldolpho is no scoundrel!” This quote is said by Aldolpho near the beginning of the show. This quote shows the silliness of the show.\n\nThis show will make you tear up from both the comedy, and tear up from the deepness of his monologues and reflections.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers."
