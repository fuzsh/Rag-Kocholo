        "text": "While a sad and antisocial musical theatre fan puts on the records of his favorite, fictional, 1928 hit musical The Drowsy Chaperone, the play comes to life. The characters from the play appear in his apartment and suddenly the set changes from his drab home to a glitzy, glamorous Broadway set. This musical within in a comedy offers twists, turns and laughs as the man in the apartment offers commentary throughout the entire play. The play is approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes.\n\nSpecial guests will be featured at each of the performances.\n\nGuests include university officials, characters from past Theatre UCF productions, and community members. For patrons looking to see which guest will be featured at each performance, the box office has a list of guests and the dates they will appear.\n\nTheatre UCF will be partnering with students and faculty from Valencia Collegeâ€™s Sign Language Interpretation program for the Saturday, November 2 performance. Patrons wishing to sit near the interpreters should make the request when purchasing their tickets. Group prices are available for ten or more people.\n\nShowings will be on Thursays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 8 pm, and on Sunday at 2 pm.\n\nThe 10/26 performance is during a home game, so please allow time for getting to the theater. During home games, Theatre UCF visitors must park in Lots B4 or B6. The theatre will email a parking permit that you need to print and display on your dashboard. A shuttle will take people from the lot to the theatre."
