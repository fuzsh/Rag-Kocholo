        "text": "Music & Lyrics by LISA LAMBERT and GREG MORRISON\n\nBook by BOB MARTIN and DON MCKELLAR\n\nOriginal Broadway production of The Drowsy Chaperone produced by Kevin McCollum, Roy Miller, Bob Boyett, Stephanie McClelland, Barbara Freitag and Jill Furman.\n\nWinner of five Tony Awards (including Best Original Score) when it hit Broadway in 2006, The Drowsy Chaperone is for people who both love and hate the American musicals of the Jazz Age. The show’s narrator — a mousy, agoraphobic Broadway fanatic seeking a cure for the blues — listens to a recording of an obscure 1928 musical comedy: The Drowsy Chaperone. As he listens, he and the audience are transported into the musical. The characters appear in his dingy apartment, his cold-water flat is transformed into an impressive Broadway set, and both the narrator and the audience are taken on a 90-minute roller coaster ride of song, dance and laughter."
