The recording comes to life and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.\n\nThursday, Jul 11th @ 7:00pm\n\nTickets Will be Available at 06/09 at 6:00pm!\n\nFriday, Jul 12th @ 7:00pm\n\nTickets Will be Available at 06/09 at 6:00pm!\n\nSaturday, Jul 13th @ 2:00pm\n\nTickets Will be Available at 06/09 at 6:00pm!\n\nSaturday, Jul 13th @ 7:00pm\n\nTickets Will be Available at 06/09 at 6:00pm!"
