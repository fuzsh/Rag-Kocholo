If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will most likely love The Drowsy Chaperone, a musical comedy featuring songs by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison. The show revolves around one musical theatre fan’s obsession with a fictional show from the 1920s – The Drowsy Chaperone. As he listens to the recording, the characters come to life in his apartment. This story follows Broadway actress, Janet Van De Graaff, who wants to marry debonair Robert Martin and give up her stage career. Janet’s producer, Mr. Feldzieg, must stop the wedding because if she quits show business, he will lose his job. In addition, gangsters threaten Mr. Feldzieg, as they fear that they will lose their investment if Janet quits. Delaware All State Theatre will perform in this specific production of The Drowsy Chaperone. Two of its performers include WFS students, Wyatt Thompson ’15 and Eliza Durham ’14.
