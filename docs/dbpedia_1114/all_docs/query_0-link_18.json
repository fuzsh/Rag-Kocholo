It is a parody of American musical comedy of the 1920s. The story concerns a middle-aged, asocial musical theatre fan; as he plays the record of his favorite musical, the (fictional) 1928 hit The Drowsy Chaperone, the show comes to life onstage as he comments on the music, story, and actors.\n\nDuring the act one finale, the musical theatre fan accidentally bumps the record player, causing the performers, music, and dance to repeat. Below are a few examples of this moment.\n\n(Pardon video quality…)\n\nSkip section starts at 6:40:\n\nSkip section starts at 5:50:"
