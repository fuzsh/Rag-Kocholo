        "text": "It’s a romp, a riot, a musical within a musical, and a rollicking display of extraordinary Taft talent. It’s The Drowsy Chaperone, on stage on in Bingham Auditorium.\n\nThe story unfolds as the “man in the chair,” played by Sijie Yan, plays an old album of his favorite musical, the fictional 1928 show The Drowsy Chaperone. As the record plays, the show—a parody of 1920s American musical comedy—comes to life onstage, as the man wryly critiques the music, story and actors.\n\nCatch the timeless musical comedy Friday, 10/21 at 7:30 pm, Saturday, 10/22 at 2 pm, Wednesday, 10/26 at 2 pm, or Friday, 10/28 at 7:30 pm. ⁠\n\n⁠\n\nEnjoy a full gallery of photos from the show here.\n\nStarring:\n\nMan in the Chair: Sijie Yan\n\nMrs. Tottendale: Elle Smiley\n\nUnderlingL Nam Dao\n\nRobert Martin: Isaac Obeng\n\nGeorge: Jabari King\n\nFeldzieg: Jackson Almasian\n\nKitty: Marina Tanaka\n\nGangster #1: Daniel Kaminju\n\nGangster #2: Hannah Englander\n\nAldolpho: Vincent Chen\n\nJanet: Claire Roberts\n\nDrowsy Chaperone: Kyla O'Byrne\n\nTrix: Sabrina Moffa\n\nSuperintendant: Sally Higgins\n\nWith the talented vocals and footwork of:\n\nGrace Deng (Captain), Ruby Dawson, Alex He, Heidi Li, Sarah Li, Melissa Maselli, Ava Payne, Natalie Shyika, Eden Thompson, Yolanda Wang.
