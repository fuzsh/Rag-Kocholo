        "text": "Elements straight out of some classic musical comedies — a Broadway impresario, bumbling gangsters, a loyal butler, a ditzy starlet and much more — are present in abundance in the next show coming to the Croswell Opera House stage, “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nThe musical opens at 8 p.m. Friday, Aug. 12, with additional performances at 8 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 13; 2:30 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 14; 8 p.m. Aug. 19 and Aug. 20; 2:30 p.m. Aug. 21.\n\nTickets range from $15 to $35 and are available by calling 264-7469 or online at croswell.org.\n\nBecause the front of the Croswell is under construction, patrons are encouraged to park in the lots behind the theater.\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone” uses a show-within-a-show concept that begins with a lonely musical theater fan, identified only as “Man In Chair,” sitting alone in his New York apartment. He tells the audience that when he’s feeling blue, he likes to listen to his favorite album: a cast recording of a 1928 musical called “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nAs he speaks, his apartment transforms into a 1920s Broadway theater and “The Drowsy Chaperone” comes to life before the audience’s eyes.\n\nIn the fictional musical that unfolds, an actress named Janet Van De Graaf is about to give up her stage career to marry a business tycoon, Robert Martin. Her producer, Feldzieg — a spoof of the real-life Florenz Ziegfeld, the impresario responsible for Ziegfeld’s Follies — wants to stop the wedding because he wants her to stay in his show (which of course is named Feldzieg’s Follies). And so, he hires two inept gangsters to derail the nuptials.\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone” was created in 1997 by a group of friends for the stag party of a real-life couple named Bob Martin and Janet van de Graaf, two Canadian improv comics. The show eventually ended up on Broadway — with Martin himself playing Man in Chair — where it won numerous Tony and Drama Desk awards.\n\nMark DiPietro directs the Croswell’s production. To him, the show is not only “extremely funny,” with “good, catchy” music, but it’s also relatable in its own way.\n\nThe Man in Chair “is a man who’s lonely and wants to share his records with us,” he said. “It’s for all of us who have taken solace in a favorite record or a favorite movie.”\n\nAnd, because the show spoofs everything from “The King and I” to “The Music Man” and everything in between — “shows from the golden age of musical theater,” DiPietro said — audiences can have fun trying to pick out the various references in the midst of a comic romp that, at about two hours with intermission, moves along very quickly.\n\n“It’s a show that doesn’t take itself too seriously,” DiPietro said. “And there are a lot of fun character roles. We’ve had a blast working on it.”\n\nThe role of Man in Chair is played by Patrick Toth of Holland, Ohio. Janet Van De Graaff is played by Franny Kromminga of Muskegon, while Martin is played by Matthew Pecek of Concord, Ohio. Jared Hoffert of Ann Arbor plays Feldzieg and the gangsters are played by Pete Stewart of Adrian and John Bacarella of Monroe.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone herself is played by Adrian native Erica Wyman, now of San Francisco.\n\nWyman got her theatrical start at the Croswell and went on to a career in professional theater, currently as the conservatory director at the Hillbarn Theatre in the Bay Area. She recently directed “Sweet Charity” and is preparing to direct “Cabaret” when she returns to California.\n\nWyman jumped at the opportunity to return to the Croswell again, as she has periodically over the years since becoming a professional actress, director and more.\n\n“It’s the Croswell. It’s my home,” she said. “This place — the theater, the people, the environment — gave me all the tools to believe I could go out and do it. I would come back any time they asked.”\n\nWhy would the longtime stage veteran want to play a role like this one? “Who wouldn’t?” she said. “It gives me a chance to just go out (onstage) and be a presence, to go out and do what I do best and have fun.”\n\nAnd the show itself, she said, is just enjoyable. “The writers took every piece of what we love about musicals and put it all into one quick show. It’s got everything — good music, a good script. If people miss it, they’ll be missing out on something everyone will be talking about.”\n\nAs for the show’s other cast members, the hostess for the wedding is Suzanne Smith of Temperance, and her long-suffering servant, known in the show only as “Underling,” is Steve Kiersey of Brownstown.\n\nJoseph Ball of Perrysburg plays the best man, George; Jamie Buechele of Ypsilanti plays Kitty, a starlet who hopes to get Janet’s job after she marries; Bruce Hardcastle of Brooklyn plays Aldolpho, an over-the-top Latin lothario who sets out to seduce the bride; and Lori MacDonald of Adrian and William McCloskey of Monroe play Trix the Aviatrix and the Man in Chair’s apartment superintendent, both of whom play a role in the show’s climax.\n\nAlso in the cast are Jacob Adams, Jessica Adams, A.J. Howard, Emily Hribar, Cameron Kuhn, Wesley Richard and Xavier Sarabia, all of Adrian; Logan Balcom of Hillsdale; Joanna Bacarella of Monroe; Abby Dotz of Saline; Meg Grzesczak of Sylvania, Ohio; Meg McNamee of Tecumseh; and Jessica Miorelli of Ypsilanti.\n\nThe choreographer is Delle Clair and the music director is Jonathan Sills. Scenic design is by Doug Miller, with costumes by Emily Gifford and Pam Krage."
