Seeing potential in the show, it was then taken and reworked for the Toronto Fringe Festival the following year, and featured Bob Martin as Man In Chair.\n\nChaperone was such a success, that it was moved to the Theatre Passe Muraille that fall, and then reworked and moved to the Winter Garden theatre in 2001. Following sold-out runs at the Winter Garden, the show was featured as part of the New York's National Alliance for Musical Theatre's Festival in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, a pre-Broadway run performed, once again to sold-out audiences, at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nThe show then transferred to the Marquis Theatre in New York, beginning previews on April 3, 2006 and opening officially on May 1, 2006.\n\nSypnosis[]\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone displays a fictional musical of the same name, sprung to life in the living room of Man In Chair as he plays the original cast recording of the show.
