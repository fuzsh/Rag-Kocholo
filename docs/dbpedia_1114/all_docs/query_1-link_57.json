        "text": "Welcome back to my 'And the Tony Almost Went to...' series, where I take a deep dive into a show that was the (likely) runner-up in the Best Musical race of any previous Tony Awards year. Tonight marks the opening of a new Broadway musical called The Prom​, which features Beth Leavel in the cast, with a book co-written by Bob Martin, and is directed & choreographed by Casey Nicholaw. Today, we'll be looking back at the show that marked the very first time all those talents got to work together as well as its success at the Tonys.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is a parody of American musical comedies of the 1920s. The story concerns a middle-aged, asocial musical theatre fan. As he plays the record of his favorite musical, the (fictional) 1928 hit The Drowsy Chaperone, the show comes to life onstage as he wryly comments on the music, story, and actors.\n\nThe musical itself began in 1997 when Don McKellar, Lisa Lambert, Greg Morrison, and several friends created a spoof of old musicals for the stag party of Bob Martin and Janet van de Graaf. They loved it so much, that they knew they had to do something with the material. Martin then collaborated with McKellar on the book to create a full-length musical, including a central lead who served as a narrator known as The Man in the Chair.\n\nAfter having gone through so many iterations, The Drowsy Chaperone finally came to Broadway with very little buzz, opening at the Marquis Theatre on May 1st, 2006. The original cast included Bob Martin as The Man in the Chair, Sutton Foster as Janet van de Graaff, Beth Leavel as The Drowsy Chaperone, Danny Burstein as Aldolpho, Troy Britton Johnson as Robert Martin, Eddie Korbich as George, Georgia Engel as Mrs. Tottendale, Edward Hibbert as Underlining, Lenny Wolpe as Feldzieg, Jennifer Smith as Kitty, Kecia Lewis-Evans as Trix, Jason Kravitz as Gangster #1, and Garth Kravitz as Gangster #2.\n\nThe production received 13 Tony Award nominations for Best Musical, Best Lead Actor in a Musical (Bob Martin), Best Lead Actress in a Musical (Sutton Foster), Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Danny Burstein), Best Featured Actress in a Musical (Beth Leavel)*, Best Direction of a Musical (Casey Nicholaw), Best Book of a Musical (Bob Martin & Don McKellar)*, Best Original Score (Lisa Lambert & Greg Morrison)*, Best Choreography (Casey Nicholaw), Best Orchestrations (Larry Blank), Best Lighting Design of a Musical (Ken Billington & Brian Monahan), Best Scenic Design of a Musical (David Gallo)*, and Best Costume Design of a Musical (Gregg Barnes)*.\n\n*denotes an award it won.\n\nGoing into the Tonys that year, industry insiders and voters were all over the place with their predictions/votes. The Drowsy Chaperone had the benefit of being the only original musical of that season, and not an adaptation of any pre-existing source material. Yet, despite winning the most awards of the night on the musical side, it still couldn't overcome the smash hit of the season that was..."
