        "text": "October 5, 2022\n\nThe Hartt Theatre Division is putting on the production: The Drowsy Chaperone, an homage to American musicals of the Jazz Age. The production will be directed and choreographed by the dynamic long-time faculty member Ralph Perkins. The show will take place in Roberts Theater on October 13-15 at 7:30 pm and October 16 at 3 pm. All seats are $10 and University faculty, staff, and students can receive one free ticket if they log in to the box office with their UHart email address. Tickets will not be available at the door but may be purchased via the link: https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?show=143911.\n\nThe production examines the effect musicals have on the fans who adore them. The show is about a mousy, agoraphobic Broadway fanatic seeking to cure his “non-specific sadness.” He listens to a recording of a fictional 1928 musical comedy, The Drowsy Chaperone. As he listens to this rare recording, he is transported into the musical. The characters appear in his dingy apartment, and it is transformed into an impressive and magical world of a Broadway show. The Drowsy Chaperone is the winner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score."
