        "text": "About the Show\n\nWinner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, The Drowsy Chaperone is a loving send-up of the Jazz Age musical. The Man in Chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical, and it comes to life! Hailed by New York Magazine as “The Perfect Broadway Musical,” The Drowsy Chaperone is a masterful meta-musical, poking fun at all the tropes that characterize the musical theatre genre."
