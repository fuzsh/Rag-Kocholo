        "text": "1. John Henry was a railroad man,\n\nHe worked from six ’till five,\n\n“Raise ’em up bullies and let ’em drop down,\n\nI’ll beat you to the bottom or die.”\n\n2. John Henry said to his captain:\n\n“You are nothing but a common man,\n\nBefore that steam drill shall beat me down,\n\nI’ll die with my hammer in my hand.”\n\n3. John Henry said to the Shakers:\n\n“You must listen to my call,\n\nBefore that steam drill shall beat me down,\n\nI’ll jar these mountains till they fall.”\n\n4. John Henry’s captain said to him:\n\n“I believe these mountains are caving in.”\n\nJohn Henry said to his captain: “Oh, Lord!”\n\n“That’s my hammer you hear in the wind.”\n\n5. John Henry he said to his captain:\n\n“Your money is getting mighty slim,\n\nWhen I hammer through this old mountain,\n\nOh Captain will you walk in?”\n\n6. John Henry’s captain came to him\n\nWith fifty dollars in his hand,\n\nHe laid his hand on his shoulder and said:\n\n“This belongs to a steel driving man.”\n\n7. John Henry was hammering on the right side,\n\nThe big steam drill on the left,\n\nBefore that steam drill could beat him down,\n\nHe hammered his fool self to death.\n\n8. They carried John Henry to the mountains,\n\nFrom his shoulder his hammer would ring,\n\nShe caught on fire by a little blue blaze\n\nI believe these old mountains are caving in.\n\n9. John Henry was lying on his death bed,\n\nHe turned over on his side,\n\nAnd these were the last words John Henry said\n\n“Bring me a cool drink of water before I die.”\n\n10. John Henry had a little woman,\n\nHer name was Pollie Ann,\n\nHe hugged and kissed her just before he died,\n\nSaying, “Pollie, do the very best you can.”\n\n11. John Henry’s woman heard he was dead,\n\nShe could not rest on her bed,\n\nShe got up at midnight, caught that No. 4 train,\n\n“I am going where John Henry fell dead.”\n\n12. They carried John Henry to that new burying ground\n\nHis wife all dressed in blue,\n\nShe laid her hand on John Henry’s cold face,\n\n“John Henry I’ve been true to you.”"
