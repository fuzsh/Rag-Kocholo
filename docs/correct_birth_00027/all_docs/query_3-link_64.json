        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Apple TV+‘s The Morning Show has added Aaron Pierre (Genius: MLK/X, The Underground Railroad) to its Season 4 cast in a major recurring role. Production on the drama is currently underway.\n\nPierre will play ‘Miles,’ an acclaimed visual artist who moves through the circles of the New York elite.\n\nThe Morning Show explores the cutthroat world of morning news and the lives of the people who help America wake up in the morning. Season 3 left the fate of UBA once again up in the air after Alex (Jennifer Aniston) manages to take down Paul Marks (Jon Hamm) by logjamming the sale of UBA to his tech company, Hyperion. But now, it appears UBA will be merging with another media company to keep the network afloat, which could spell layoffs and restructuring in Season 4.\n\nReese Witherspoon, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Greta Lee and Nicole Beharie also star. Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons will make their debut in Season 4.\n\nWitherspoon and Aniston executive produce The Morning Show—developed by Kerry Ehrin— alongside director Mimi Leder (under a multi-year overall deal with Apple TV+) and Michael Ellenberg; Media Res is the studio alongside Hello Sunshine, a Candle Media company, and Echo Films. Charlotte Stoudt, who has a multi-year overall deal with Apple TV+ for scripted television series, serves as showrunner and EP.\n\nPierre was most recently seen leading the NatGeo series Genius: MLK/ X, as civil rights leader Malcolm X and Garth Davis’ Foe in a lead role alongside Paul Mescal and Saoirse Ronan. Up next, he will lead Jeremy Saulnier’s thriller Rebel Ridge for Netflix and Mufasa: The Lion King in Barry Jenkins’ upcoming prequel story for Disney voicing the titular lion.\n\nRELATED: ‘The Morning Show’ Season 4: Everything We Know So Far\n\nPrior credits include Clement Virgo’s Brother; the role of “Caesar,” a Virginia slave in Barry Jenkins’ award-winning limited series The Underground Railroad; and M. Night Shyamalan’s Old, in which he played a rapper, and recorded his own song.\n\nHe is repped by WME, Anonymous Content, Hamilton Hodell and Sloane Offer Weber & Dern."
