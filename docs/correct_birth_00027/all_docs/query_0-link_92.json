        "text": "THE CANADIAN PRESS\n\nSHANGHAI, China â Canada's Daniel Nestor and partner Mark Knowles of the Bahamas concluded their decade-plus partnership on a high note Sunday, winning the year-end title at the Masters Cup.\n\nThe veterans, who are wrapping up their collaboration after 13 years on court and 40 titles, went out winners in a 6-2, 6-3 victory over US Open-champions Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Austrian Julian Knowle at the Qi Zhong stadium.\n\nThe pair of veterans who will play next season with new partners â Belgrade-born Nestor has already earned a trophy this autumn with Serb Nenad Zimonjic â went out in style.\n\nVictory took just 65 minutes.\n\n\"We played a great match,\" said Toronto's Nestor, who has lifted 40 titles alongside Knowles. \"Everything was clicking today â serves, returns."
