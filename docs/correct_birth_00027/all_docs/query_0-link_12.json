        "text": "York University conferred an honorary doctor of laws to Canada’s most decorated tennis athlete, world champion, 2000 Olympic gold medalist and 2012 Olympian Daniel Nestor. The honorary degree was awarded to Nestor in recognition of his achievements and commitment to sport, the community and health science.\n\n“Daniel’s contributions to the sport of tennis and the broader community are truly inspiring,” said York University President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri. “His distinguished career as a highly-respected athlete in tennis, his devotion to Canada, as well as his dedication to the community serves as a model worthy of emulation by our students.”\n\nIn celebration of Nestor’s most recent achievement, Shoukri hosted a special ceremony yesterday at the University’s Keele campus. The ceremony was attended by student athletes and members of the community.\n\n“York’s leadership in supporting Canadian Tennis makes this recognition particularly special. I am honoured to be part of their commitment to athletic and academic excellence,” said Nestor. “The University is a leading centre in the study and promotion of sport and health science.”\n\n“We are proud to welcome Daniel home for the first time as the newest member of the York family,” added Shoukri.\n\nBorn in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Nestor immigrated to Canada in 1976 with his family. Always a sports and health enthusiast, he started early with special sports programs, attending Earl Haig Secondary School where he was in a gifted program for athletes.\n\nNestor achieved international success as a doubles champion. He has won countless men’s doubles titles and Grand Slam titles. In fact, he has competed in every summer Olympics since 1996.\n\nHe achieved the world number one ranking for a doubles player in August 2002 and again in May 2012. He is also Canada’s first-ever Wimbledon champion having won in both 2008 and 2009.\n\nNestor is not only a talented athlete, he has contributed his time and name to support numerous organizations, including the Toronto-based community service organization Project Engagement, and hosting The Nestor Event on behalf of the North York General Hospital Foundation.\n\nFor his many achievements, Nestor was awarded the Order of Canada in 2010."
