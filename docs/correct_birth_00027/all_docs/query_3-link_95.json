        "text": "Colombia are eyeing their second Copa America title.\n\nNestor Lorenzo’s Colombia have booked their place in the Copa America 2024 final after a hard-fought 1-0 win against Uruguay in the semifinal stage, extending their unbeaten run in the competition.\n\nIn a fiercely contested battle, Colombia broke the deadlock in the 39th minute through midfielder Jefferson Lerma’s expertly placed headed goal off a James Rodriguez assist, taking a vital 1-0 lead. However, the joy of the Colombian faithful was short-lived as right-back Daniel Munoz was controversially sent off following his physical altercation with Uruguay’s Manuel Ugarte towards the end of the first half.\n\nDespite the flurry of Uruguayan chances in the second period, 10-man Colombia incredibly held on to their slender advantage to win the match 1-0 and make it to their first Copa America final in 23 years.\n\nLos Cafeteros finished the group stage as Group D table-toppers, beating the likes of Costa Rica and Paraguay and registering an impressive draw against Brazil, with a record of two wins, one draw, seven points, six goals scored, and just two goals conceded.\n\nDuring the knockout rounds, Nestor Lorenzo’s side dismantled a hapless Panama 5-0, courtesy of a playmaking masterclass by James Rodriguez, who bagged a goal along with two assists to complete a dominating display in the quarterfinals.\n\nAlso read: Copa America title winners\n\nOn July 15, the 2001 Copa America champions are set to lock horns with Argentina at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida for the grand finale of Copa America 2024. One of the clear frontrunners for the golden ball this summer, James Rodriguez is the top assister in the tournament so far with a record-breaking six assists.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, only if a player receives a red card in the semifinal will he miss the Copa America final.\n\nIn their five matches of the tournament, Colombia have had their fair share of player injuries and suspensions. As previously mentioned, star right-back Daniel Munoz is set to miss the Copa America final due to his sending off for violent conduct in the semifinal clash against Uruguay, activating an automatic one-match suspension.\n\nTo make matters worse, talented midfielder and one of Colombia’s standout performers this summer, Richard Rios, could also potentially miss the final after sustaining a leg injury against Uruguay, making the semifinal triumph a bittersweet moment for Nestor Lorenzo’s side.\n\nPrior to this, at the very start of the tournament, defender Jhon Lucumi had gone down with an injury in Los Cafeteros’ opening match of the campaign, which kept him on the sidelines."
