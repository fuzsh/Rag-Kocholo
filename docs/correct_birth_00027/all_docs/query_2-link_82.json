        "text": "Toronto isn't known for producing athletes in the same way it produces great bands, amazing authors and compassion (with an accompanying hashtag) for a little raccoon who left us far too soon. There are, however, a handful of athletes who, with their fame and athletic prowess, make Toronto look like an incubator for sporting glory.\n\nHere are my picks for the top athletes from Toronto of all time.\n\nAngela James\n\nHockey superstar Angela James was born in Toronto in 1964. Known as the Wayne Gretzky of women's hockey, James led Team Canada to four world championships and was the first openly gay player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nJamaal Magloire\n\nMagloire was born in Toronto, attended Eastern Commerce High School, and scored some impressive points for various NBA teams before being the first Canadian-born player to play for the Toronto Raptors. This star center is currently assistant coaching the Raptors as well as consulting and acting as a brand ambassador.\n\nDaniel Nestor\n\nTennis pro, Order of Canada recipient and Earl Haig alum, Daniel Nestor wasn't born in Toronto, but grew up here. Nestor has won 87 men's doubles titles, including a medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics, 4 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles, and the hearts of tennis fans everywhere.\n\nKen Dryden\n\nTalented goaltender Ken Dryden grew up just outside of Toronto and currently resides here. With a Wikipedia page that makes overachiever James Franco look lazy, Dryden boasted incredible stats before leaving the NHL to get an Ivy League education, attend law school, write several books, and serve as a Member of Parliament.\n\nBrendan Shanahan\n\nCurrent Maple Leafs President Brendan Shanahan grew up in Mimico and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2013. Shanahan shone as a Detroit Red Wing, winning three Stanley Cups, and was a member of the gold medal-winning Team Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nElvis Stojko\n\nFigure skater and sexual awakener for girls and boys everywhere, Stojko is a two-time Olympic silver medalist. Currently residing in Toronto, Stojko was the first man to land a quadruple jump in combination and was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nGeorge Chuvalo\n\nLegendary boxer George Chuvalo is a five-time Canadian heavyweight champion and two-time world heavyweight title challenger. A graduate of St. Michael's College School, Chuvalo was never knocked down in his 93 fight career.\n\nMilos Raonic\n\nRaonic was born in Montenegro but moved to Toronto when he was three. At 24, this tennis badass has already played in four Grand Slam tournaments, represented Canada in the 2012 Summer Olympics and has one of the strongest serves in the world.\n\nJoey Votto\n\nFirst baseman Joey Votto grew up in Toronto and currently plays for the Cincinnati Reds. Winner of the National League MVP Award, the Lou Marsh Trophy, the National League Hank Aaron Award and the Gold Glove Award, Votto has an insane on-base percentage.\n\nPK Subban\n\nToronto-born PK Subban is a current Canadiens defenseman and longtime NHL heartthrob. Winner of the James Norris Memorial Trophy, Subban also helped Team Canada score a gold medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWho did I miss? Leave your picks (and burns about my athletic knowledge) in the comments."
