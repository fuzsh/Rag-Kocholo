We sought to define a methylation signature to identify newly diagnosed individuals at high risk for developing metastasis. Methylation profiling was performed on 41 patients with pUM with stage T2–T4 and at least three years of follow-up using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (N = 24) and the EPIC BeadChip (N = 17). Findings were validated in the TCGA cohort with known metastatic outcome (N = 69). Differentially methylated probes were identified in patients who developed metastasis. Unsupervised consensus clustering revealed three epigenomic subtypes associated with metastasis. To identify a prognostic signature, recursive feature elimination and random forest models were utilized within repeated cross-validation iterations. The 250 most commonly selected probes comprised the final signature, named MethylSig-UM. MethylSig-UM could distinguish individuals with pUM at diagnosis who develop future metastasis with an area under the curve of ~81% in the independent validation cohort, and remained significant in Cox proportional hazard models when combined with clinical features and established genomic biomarkers. Altered expression of immune-modulating genes were detected in MethylSig-UM positive tumors, providing clues for pUM resistance to immunotherapy. The MethylSig-UM model is available to enable additional validation in larger cohort sizes including T1 tumors.

(2) Methods: An online survey was advertised publicly on the social media platform Instagram between 25th February 2021 and 11th March 2021. (3) Results: In total, 415 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. The majority of HCPs discussed FP techniques either never 39.5% (n = 164), once a year 20.7% (n = 86) or once a month 17.8% (n = 74). The majority rated their knowledge of each type of FP method as ‘very poor’ or ‘poor’ and strongly disagreed 14.2% (n = 59) or disagreed 42.2% (n = 175) with the statement they ‘felt confident to counsel a patient on FP’. The majority either agreed 37.8% (n = 157) or strongly agreed 22.2% (n = 92) that it was their responsibility to discuss FP and 38.1% (n = 158) agreed or strongly agreed 19.5% (n = 81) they considered the desire for future fertility when planning treatment. The majority 87.2% (n = 362) had not experienced formal training on FP. (4) Conclusions: Discrepancies in knowledge remain regarding techniques of FP, referral pathways, awareness of facilities offering services and existing educational resources. Many HCPs recognise the importance of FP and their responsibility to initiate discussions. The knowledge that FP may not delay the treatment of cancer has also improved; however, training in FP is scarce.

This multicenter retrospective cohort study aimed to identify predictive factors for the efficacy of EV therapy and prolonged overall survival (OS) of patients in clinical practice. This study included patients with la/mUC who received ICI treatment. Patients who subsequently received EV treatment, those who received non-EV chemotherapy, and those who received no treatment were defined as EV, non-EV, and best supportive care (BSC) groups, respectively. The median OS was 20, 15, and 7 months in the EV, non-EV, and BSC groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Patients with la/mUC who had a complete or partial response after EV treatment had a significantly prolonged OS compared with those with stable or progressive disease. Univariate analysis showed age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), dysgeusia, and rash as independent predictors of OS improvement. NLR and dysgeusia were independent predictors of OS after EV in multivariate analysis. Patients without these factors had a significantly prolonged OS compared to those with both factors. In real-world practice, EV therapy is an effective treatment for patients with la/mUC after ICI treatment.

This study included 61 patients (36 with EC and 25 with MMMTs) and analyzed various radiomic features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features. These variables and patient clinicopathologic characteristics were compared between EC and MMMTs using the Wilcoxon Rank sum and Fisher’s exact test. The area under the curve of the receiving operating characteristics (AUC ROC) was calculated for univariate analysis in predicting EC status. Logistic regression with elastic net regularization was performed for texture feature selection. This study showed that skewness (p = 0.045) and tumor volume (p = 0.007) significantly differed between EC and MMMTs. The range of cluster shade, the angular variance of cluster shade, and the range of the sum of squares variance were significant predictors of EC status (p ≤ 0.05). The regularized Cox regression analysis identified the “256 Angular Variance of Energy” texture feature as significantly associated with OS independently of the EC/MMMT grouping (p = 0.004). The volume and texture features of the tumor region may help distinguish between EC and MMMTs and predict patient outcomes.

Its rarity, together with the characteristic histological heterogeneity and the historically poor response to systemic treatments, has prevented the establishment of widely accepted treatment criteria with curative intent. In this sense, radical cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with peritonectomy procedures and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), widely used in peritoneal carcinomatosis with excellent results, have not had the same evolutionary development in patients with peritoneal sarcomatosis. A multidisciplinary working group of experts in sarcomas and peritoneal oncological surgery established a series of recommendations based on current scientific evidence for the management of peritoneal sarcomatosis, taking into account the different histological subgroups of abdominopelvic sarcomas that can cause it depending on their origin: retroperitoneal sarcomas, uterine sarcomas, and visceral/peritoneal sarcomas of GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor) and non-GIST origin. This article shows the results of sarcoma experts’ voting on the recommendations presented during the I Ibero-American Consensus on the Management of Peritoneal Sarcomatosis, which took place during the recent celebration of the III Hispanic-Portuguese Meeting for Updates on the Treatment of Sarcomas.

The field of immune oncology has generated promising immunomodulation therapies and opened up new ways of treatment. Methods: Our retrospective study included 102 patients diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell cancer (LSCC). Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of PD-L1 and tumor microenvironment cells (CD4, CD8, CD68 and CD163). Results: PD-L1 expression showed statistically significant positive correlations with all examined tumor microenvironment cells. Patients with high CD68 and CD163 expression intratumorally (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.006, respectively) had statistically significant shorter disease-specific survival. Moreover, a statistically shorter time to recurrence was found in patients with high CD68 intratumoral and CD8 overall counts (p = 0.049 and p = 0.019, respectively). Also, high CD8 overall (>23%) and CD68 intratumoral (>2.7%) expression were statistically significant predictors of recurrence (p = 0.028, OR = 3.11 and p = 0.019, OR = 3.13, respectively). Conclusions: Higher CD68 and CD163 expression represented significantly worse prognosticators for clinical outcomes in patients with LSCC. In order to determine which LSCC patients will benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, it is crucial to elucidate the relationship between PD-L1 expression, immune cell distribution and prognosis in LSCC patients.

A multicenter MRI study with standardized imaging protocols, including DCE-MRI and DKI data of 81 patients with WHO grade 2–4 gliomas, was performed at six centers. The DCE-MRI and DKI parameter values were quantitatively evaluated in ROIs in tumor tissue and contralateral normal-appearing white matter. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to differentiate between high-grade (HGG) vs. low-grade gliomas (LGG), IDH1/2 wildtype vs. mutated gliomas, and high-grade astrocytic tumors vs. high-grade oligodendrogliomas. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for each parameter and for the regression models to determine the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Significant differences between tumor groups were found in the DCE-MRI and DKI parameters. A combination of DCE-MRI and DKI parameters revealed the best prediction of HGG vs. LGG (AUC = 0.954 (0.900–1.000)), IDH1/2 wildtype vs. mutated gliomas (AUC = 0.802 (0.702–0.903)), and astrocytomas/glioblastomas vs. oligodendrogliomas (AUC = 0.806 (0.700–0.912)) with the lowest Akaike information criterion. The combination of DCE-MRI and DKI seems helpful in predicting glioma types according to the 2021 World Health Organization’s (WHO) classification.

There are three main histological types of lung cancer, and it is more important than ever to accurately identify the subtypes since the development of personalized, type-specific targeted therapies that have improved mortality rates. Traditionally, the gold standard for the confirmation of histological subtyping is tissue biopsy and histopathology. This, however, comes with its own challenges, which call for newer sampling techniques and adjunctive tools to assist in and improve upon the existing diagnostic workflow. This review aims to list and describe studies from the last decade (n = 47) that investigate three such potential omics techniques—namely (1) transcriptomics, (2) proteomics, and (3) metabolomics, as well as immunohistochemistry, a tool that has already been adopted as a diagnostic adjunct. The novelty of this review compared to similar comprehensive studies lies with its detailed description of each adjunctive technique exclusively in the context of lung cancer subtyping. Similarities between studies evaluating individual techniques and markers are drawn, and any discrepancies are addressed. The findings of this study indicate that there is promising evidence that supports the successful use of omics methods as adjuncts to the subtyping of lung cancer, thereby directing clinician practice in an economical and less invasive manner.

However, in the cases of advanced lung cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT), the role of VATS is still questionable, with concerns about safety, technical feasibility, and oncological completeness. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of nCT on patients who had undergone uniportal VATS (U-VATS) anatomic lung resections for lung cancer, by comparing the short-term outcomes of patients after nCT with case-matched counterparts (treated by surgery alone). Methods: We performed a retrospective, comparative study enrolling 927 patients (nCT: 60; non-nCT:867) who underwent U-VATS anatomic lung resections from 2014 to 2020 in two centers. Data were collected in a shared database with standardized variables’ definition. Propensity score matching using 15 baseline preoperative patients’ characteristics was performed in order to minimize selection-confounding factors between the two groups, which then were directly compared in terms of perioperative outcomes. Results: After propensity score matching, two groups of 60 patients had been defined. The nCT-group had a higher conversion rate compared to the control group (13.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.003) without an increase in operation time or cardiopulmonary complications. In addition, no differences between the two groups were recorded in terms of prolonged air leaks, length of stay, and readmission. Conclusions: U-VATS after nCT is a feasible approach, showing a similar rate of cardiopulmonary complications and length of stay when compared with the control group. However, it remains a challenging surgery due to its great technical complexity as well as the clinical status of the patients.

Its rarity makes characterization challenging, although colonic ASC is believed to present at more advanced stages and have worse outcomes versus adenocarcinoma. This study aims to characterize the clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes of colonic ASC. (2) Methods: This is a single-center, retrospective review of patients diagnosed with colonic ASC from 2000 to 2020. Data extracted included patient demographics, staging at diagnosis, tumor clinicopathologic and genetic characteristics, and clinical outcomes. (3) Results: Among 61,126 patients with colorectal cancer, 13 (0.02%) had colonic ASC, with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.7 years. The cecum/ascending colon was the most common primary site (6/13, 46.2%), and all except one patient was diagnosed with Stage III or IV disease. Among the eight patients with mismatch repair genetics available, only one was mismatch repair deficient. Eleven patients (84.6%) underwent surgery, and 11 likewise received some form of chemotherapy. Recurrence occurred in 7 of 13 patients (53.8%), and the overall five-year survival rate was 38.5%. The median survival rate was 39.4 months overall (30.5 months for Stage III, 23.7 months for Stage IV). (4) Conclusions: Overall, colonic ASC is rare, and this cohort of colonic ASC patients demonstrated advanced stage at diagnosis, frequent recurrence, and poor overall survival. Additional research remains to compare these characteristics with those of comparably staged adenocarcinoma and to develop specific management recommendations.

Methods: The study group included 2303 children receiving intensive chemotherapy for ALL. The group was divided into patients with at least one episode of AP and those who did not develop AP after treatment for ALL. Results: The cumulative incidence of AP in the study group was 4.08%. Older age was an independent risk factor for the development of AP (OR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.006–1.098; p = 0.03). The overall mortality associated with AP was 2.13%. The probabilities of disease-free survival (p-DFS) and event-free survival (p-EFS) in both subgroups were 0.84 vs. 0.86, log-rank p = 0.65 and 0.75 vs. 0.80, log-rank p = 0.12, respectively. A total of 22 out of 94 patients (23.4%) with AP were re-exposed to asparaginase (ASP) during the subsequent treatment phases. Only one patient re-exposed to ASP (4.5%) developed a second episode of AP. There were no significant differences in p-DFS and p-EFS between patients re-exposed and not re-exposed to asparaginase (0.78 vs. 0.86, log-rank p = 0.27 and 0.63 vs. 0.79, log-rank p = 0.09, respectively). Conclusions: The incidence of AP in children with ALL is low and related to patients’ age. The development of AP does not seem to influence p-DFS and p-EFS in children with ALL. Recurrence of AP after re-exposure to asparaginase in patients with ALL and a history of AP is low (4.5%). Re-exposure to asparaginase after the first episode of AP does not improve either p-DFS or p-EFS in children with ALL.

To date, 16α-[18F]fluoroestradiol (FES) is the only FDA-approved imaging probe for the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer. However, FES has the drawback of a high retention in the liver. Therefore, the aim of this study was the development and preclinical evaluation of estradiol (E2) derivatives with different lipophilicity. Three 18F-labeled prosthetic groups (two glycosyl and one PEG azide) were chosen for conjugation with ethinyl estradiol (EE) by 18F-CuAAC (Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition). The cellular uptake in ER+ MCF-7 tumor cells was highest for the less hydrophilic derivative (18F-TA-Glyco-EE). In nude mice bearing different breast tumors (ER+ MCF-7 and T47D versus ER− MDA-MB-231), 18F-TA-Glyco-EE revealed a high uptake in the liver (13%ID/g, 30 min p.i.), which decreased over 90 min to 1.2%ID/g, indicating fast hepatobiliary clearance. The statistically significant difference of 18F-TA-Glyco-EE uptake in T47D compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors at 60–90 min p.i. indicated ER-specific uptake, whereas in vivo PET imaging did not provide evidence for specific uptake of 18F-TA-Glyco-EE in MCF-7 tumors, probably due to ER occupation by E2 after E2-dependent MCF-7 tumor growth in mice. However, in vitro autoradiography revealed a high specific binding of 18F-TA-Glyco-EE to ER+ tumor slices. We conclude that 18F-TA-Glyco-EE, with its increased hydrophilicity after deacetylation in the blood and thus rapid washout from non-target tissues, may be a viable alternative to FES for the PET imaging of breast cancer.

Despite standard-of-care treatment, which includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, mortality rates are high, underscoring the critical need for advancing GBM therapy. Over the past two decades, numerous clinical trials have been performed, yet only a small fraction demonstrated a benefit, raising concerns about the predictability of current preclinical models. Traditionally, preclinical studies utilize treatment-naïve tumors, failing to model the clinical scenario where patients undergo standard-of-care treatment prior to recurrence. Recurrent GBM generally exhibits distinct molecular alterations influenced by treatment selection pressures. In this review, we discuss the impact of treatment—surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy—on GBM. We also provide a summary of treatments used in preclinical models, advocating for their integration to enhance the translation of novel strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes in GBM.

However, its implementation throughout hospitals is hard to obtain due to its fragile economical sustainability. A retrospective health economic analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the cost of hospitalization for patients undergoing PIPAC treatment at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli, IRCCS, in Rome. The average cost of a PIPAC procedure was defined based on the cost of surgery (cost of surgical material, operating room, intraperitoneal chemotherapy), hospital stay, diagnostic examinations, and drugs used during the stay. A total of 493 PIPAC procedures were performed on 222 patients with peritoneal metastases or primary peritoneal cancer from 2017 to 2023. Since the mean remuneration for each PIPAC hospitalization is €5916 and the mean expenditure per hospitalization is €6538, this results in an operating profit per PIPAC hospitalization of −€622. The reimbursement of PIPAC treatment by the Italian National Health System currently only partially covers the hospital’s costs. Development of specific codes and adequate reimbursement for PIPAC by recognizing this procedure as a proper treatment for peritoneal carcinomatosis is essential.

Knocking down or blocking the GH receptor has been shown to sensitize the tumor cells to chemotherapy. Extensive studies have demonstrated that exosomes, a subset of extracellular vesicles, play an important role in drug resistance by transferring key factors to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. In this study, we explore how GH modulates exosomal cargoes from melanoma cells and their role in drug resistance. We treated the melanoma cells with GH, doxorubicin, and the GHR antagonist, pegvisomant, and analyzed the exosomes released. Additionally, we administered these exosomes to the recipient cells. The GH-treated melanoma cells released exosomes with elevated levels of ABC transporters (ABCC1 and ABCB1), N-cadherin, and MMP2, enhancing drug resistance and migration in the recipient cells. GHR antagonism reduced these exosomal levels, restoring drug sensitivity and attenuating migration. Overall, our findings highlight a novel role of GH in modulating exosomal cargoes that drive chemoresistance and metastasis in melanoma. This understanding provides insights into the mechanisms of GH in melanoma chemoresistance and suggests GHR antagonism as a potential therapy to overcome chemoresistance in melanoma treatment.

Its amplification is linked to poor clinical outcomes. At the genetic level, HER2 is encoded by the ERBB2 gene (v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2), which is frequently mutated or amplified in cancers, thus spurring extensive research into HER2 modulation and inhibition as viable anti-cancer strategies. An impressive body of FDA-approved drugs, including anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), and HER2-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have demonstrated success in enhancing overall survival (OS) and disease progression-free survival (PFS). Yet, drug resistance remains a persistent challenge and raises the risks of metastatic potential and tumor relapse. Research into alternative therapeutic options for HER2+ breast cancer therefore proves critical for adapting to this ever-evolving landscape. This review highlights current HER2-targeted therapies, discusses predictive biomarkers for drug resistance, and introduces promising emergent therapies—especially combination therapies—that are aimed at overcoming drug resistance in the context of HER2+ breast cancer.

Individuals with CH have a higher risk for hematological and non-hematological diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, and have an overall higher mortality rate. Originally thought to be restricted to a small fraction of elderly people, recent advances in single-cell sequencing and bioinformatics have revealed that CH with multiple expanded mutant clones is universal in the elderly population. Just a few years ago, phylogenetic reconstruction across the human lifespan and novel sensitive sequencing techniques showed that CH can start earlier in life, decades before it was thought possible. These studies also suggest that environmental factors acting through aberrant inflammation might be a common theme promoting clonal expansion and disease progression. However, numerous aspects of this phenomenon remain to be elucidated and the precise mechanisms, context-specific drivers, and pathways of clonal expansion remain to be established. Here, we review our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms driving CH and specifically focus on how pro-inflammatory factors affect normal and mutant HSC fates to promote clonal selection.

To this primacy contribute both non-oncogene addicted and advanced NSCLCs, in which conventional therapies are only partially effective. The adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon has revealed antiproliferative action in different cancers, including osteosarcoma and pancreatic cancer. Herein, we investigated its potential anticancer role in NSCLC for the first time. We proved that AdipoRon strongly inhibits viability, growth and colony formation in H1299 and A549 NSCLC cells, mainly through a slowdown in cell cycle progression. Along with the biological behaviors, a metabolic switching was observed after AdipoRon administration in NSCLC cells, consisting of higher glucose consumption and lactate accumulation. Remarkably, both 2-Deoxy Glucose and Oxamate glycolytic-interfering agents greatly enhanced AdipoRon’s antiproliferative features. As a master regulator of cell metabolism, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated by AdipoRon. Notably, the ablation of AdipoRon-induced AMPK phosphorylation by Compound-C significantly counteracted its effectiveness. However, the engagement of other pathways should be investigated afterwards. With a focus on NSCLC, our findings further support the ability of AdipoRon in acting as an anticancer molecule, driving its endorsement as a future candidate in NSCLC therapy.
