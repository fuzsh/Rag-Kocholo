        "text": "1931 Â· The Prehistoric Minnesota Woman\n\nThe Minnesota Woman was the name given to the skeletal remains of a woman thought to be 8,000 years old found near Pelican Rapids. The bones were brought to the University of Minnesota for more study. Later, Dr. Albert Jenks identified them as the bones of a 15 or 16 year old woman. Scientists now recognize the girl as someone whose ancestors were Paleo-Indian and now her skeletal remains have been reburied in South Dakota, not available for further study.\n\n1942 Â· The Japanese American internment\n\nCaused by the tensions between the United States and the Empire of Japan, the internment of Japanese Americans caused many to be forced out of their homes and forcibly relocated into concentration camps in the western states. More than 110,000 Japanese Americans were forced into these camps in fear that some of them were spies for Japan."
