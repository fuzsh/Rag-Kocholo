        "text": "Tennis Canada announced that Daniel Nestor and Aleksandra Wozniak have been inducted into the Rogers Cup Hall of Fame to highlight the undeniable mark that these Canadians have left on the Rogers Cup presented by National Bank and in the hearts of tennis fans.\n\nWozniak and Nestor will be inducted on Centre Court at IGA Stadium during the Rogers Cup in Montreal on the night of Tuesday, August 6 and Thursday, August 8, respectively.\n\nWozniak undoubtedly made her mark on Canadian tennis history. In 2009, the Quebec native reached a career high ranking of world no. 21, a feat that earns her the fourth spot among the best ranked Canadian players in history. One year prior, in 2008, she became the first Quebec born player to win a WTA title when she was crowned champion at a tournament in Stanford, defeating Francesca Schiavone, Samantha Stosur, Serena Williams and Marion Bartoli. It was at the French Open that she achieved her best results at a Grand Slam. She reached the fourth round in 2009 and the third round on three other occasions.\n\nDuring her career, she took part in the Rogers Cup presented by National Bank a total of 13 times, reaching the quarter-finals in 2012 by eliminating Daniela Hantuchova and former World No. 1 Jelena Jankovic.\n\nNestor’s achievements make him one of the most decorated doubles players in the history of the sport. Nestor was actually inducted into the Canadian Tennis Hall of Fame in 2018. In 2009, he became the first player – singles or doubles – to win all four Grand Slams as well as the nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments. He won 12 doubles titles at Grand Slams, took part in six Olympic games – taking home a gold medal – and represented Canada during 52 Davis Cup ties.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2018, Nestor did not miss a single edition of the Rogers Cup. Throughout his time at the tournament, he was notably crowned doubles champion on two occasions in 2000 and 2008, reached the final three times – the last time being in Montreal in 2015 – and the semi-finals on eight other occasions. At the start of his career, Nestor also had some good success in singles. In fact, he managed to move past the first round five times. His best results came in 1996, in Toronto, when he reached the third round by defeating Austrian Thomas Muster, then world no. 2.\n\nThese two Canadian tennis legends retired from the sport in 2018."
