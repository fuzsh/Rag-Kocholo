        "text": "This week marks one year since left the #SanFrancisco Bay Area to explore new horizons in #Switzerland. While we may not be in SF anymore, the Bay remains very near as a way of #thinking and #living. In this spirit, its been a pleasure contributing to the Geneva Graduate Institute | Executive Education 2024 Summer School on International Affairs with a session on #Diplomacies in the Bay. The session gave students a brief overview of #SiliconValley, its #history, model and #mindsets. We then considered how foreign #governments engage in this dynamic environment, the #swissnex model from 2003 onwards, as well as the recent emergence of #technology #diplomacy. We then #brainstormed about the type of #synergies and #bridges that could be built between Geneva and the Bay Area. From creating a policy #hackathon on misinformation and disinformation, the organising of a #conference on responsible innovation, organising tech policy #studytours in the two regions, to better documenting and anticipating tech policy #trends, the session produced many relevant #ideas. Overall this session once again made the point that #Geneva and #SiliconValley should be seen as two #complementary ecosystems that can uniquely contribute to tackling the global #challenges we face. Thanks to all the students for their proactive engagement and JÃ©rÃ´me Duberry for the invitation.\n\nWhat a week ! We gathered representatives from countries where Giga is active for an intense program centered around #knowledge-sharing, #community-building and #networking. Giga's vision of connecting every #school in the world by 2030 is not only a #technical challenge. It requires new ways of #collaborating and #working together across sectors. That's what the very first Giga Connectivity Forum tried to achieve. Sessions on blended finance, infrastructure investment, school mapping and capacity development, as well as device affordability and child online protection, served a catalyst for #reflexion, #strategy and #collaboration towards meaningful universal #connectivity and sustainable digital #transformation. Much more they allowed participants to exchange on #bestpractices, #challenges and #priorities when implementing school connectivity. Showcasing the vibrant #Swiss and International Geneva #ecosystem was also a key part of the agenda. From a spotlight session featuring Tim Smith from CERN, an opening reception hosted at FER GenÃ¨ve to an official reception hosted at the Residence of the Swiss Ambassador to the United Nations, we had time to connect with relevant actors working on global challenges from Geneva to the World. Together with Konstantinos Komaitis, PhD, we also gathered the Geneva digital policy network for an informal happy hour in front of the Jet-d-eau. A big thank you to the Giga team and every #ITU and #UNICEF colleagues that contributed making this event a success. A special cheers to my #coMCs Paula de la Cal FlorÃ­a and Nobuntu N. for the excellent #collaboration. It's been great trying to stir this big ship to its intended #destination. Can't wait for the next Forum! Pictures credit: https://lnkd.in/eVTfgJ5h\n\nA big week ahead with the inaugural Giga #Connectivity #Forum hosted by International Telecommunication Union and UNICEF. The forum brings together for the first time #ministries of education, telecommunications and regulators, alongside Giga #partners and representatives from #International #Geneva to further accelerate efforts to connect all #schools to the internet by 2030. Connecting schools of the world is not only a #technical #challenge. It has to do with enhancing #collaboration, #knowledge exchange and #community building. I look forward to an engaging event! PS If you are in #Geneva working on internet/digital policy issues, we are hosting an informal happy hour with Konstantinos Komaitis, PhD and the Atlantic Council's Democracy and Tech Initiative this Wednesday evening. PM me to get your invite.\n\nYesterday, I had the pleasure of virtually joining DiploFoundation's #TechnologyDiplomacy course with Pavlina Ittelson and 20 engaging students. During our hour together, I shared some #lessonslearned from my #experiences building #bridges between sectors with the ICRC and the Swiss government in Silicon Valley. Building on the excellent content provided by Martin Rauchbauer, Patricia Gruver-Barr, Eric Loeb, Eugenio V Garcia ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and Jovan Kurbalija, I highlighted many key insights for a fruitful engagement with the tech sector in the BayArea and beyond. Three of them stand out in my view: - Instead of going alone, go with others. #Multistakeholder platforms focusing on specific issues are emerging as unique catalysts for synergies, ensuring that tech diplomacy leads to tangible outcomes. - Be Strategic. Governments need #longterm, #transversal #strategies that foster trust and mutual understanding with the private sector. Collaboration across various administrative sectors is essential. - Understanding #mindsets and the #informal social norms of the ecosystem you are engaging with is crucial for effective collaboration. While these insights may not be new, they serve as valuable #guiding #principles for bridging the gap between technology and governments. Thanks again Diplo for having me, and looking forward to next year https://lnkd.in/g-w6Jvhe\n\nDay 3 at #WSIS marked the beginning of ITU's #AI4Good Summit. As the world convened to discuss #artificial #intelligence, its promises, opportunities and risks, it was good to start the day with a #realitycheck : the digital #divide is growing and countries around the world are working hard to bridge it. In this spirit, we convened high-level representatives from countries where Giga is implemented to exchange best practices and connect with each other. ITUs Secretary General called on them to (a) share their #data for public use through Giga, (b) #mentor a country (c) share their #experiences. If connectivity is surely a key SDG enabler, some calling it #SDG0, bridging the digital divide requires leadership and collaboration. A great reminder! https://lnkd.in/gYjPanfm\n\nMy highlight of day 2 at #WSIS happened in the margins of the main event at the Geneva Graduate Institute | Executive Education. Building on #introductions I made, I joined a fascinating session on #techdiplomacy and the future of #diplomacy. What were my takeaways? I realised how much techdiplomacy, as first coined by Denmark in 2017, is not a new phenomenon. Governments have often been #strategically #positioned in places where great #changes are taking place. Beyond hypes, techdiplomacy can be seen as the #continuation of diplomacy through different means and tools. Yet it takes #strategy to make something out of it, particularly when engaging in places like #SiliconValley. Technology diplomacy can also be seen as through the lenses of #multistakeholder engagement, where governments and tech firms collaborate on common priorities and challenges. Two elements comes to mind in this endeavour: the importance of building a trusted #dialogue and the different #skillset it takes to make collaboration productive for both sides. In my view, one of the main #challenge in the practise of technology diplomacy remains navigating the tension between #pushing and #pulling. On one hand we must collaborate to bridge the digital divide and ensure everyone can access the benefits offered by the internet. Yet on the other, we must ensure that technology is used #responsibly. Discussions like these offered by practitioners surely help us navigate this tension effectively. With this, off to Day 3.\n\nThe first day of the World Summit on the Information Society (#WSIS) offered us a 360 degree glimpse on key issues pertaining to the #governance of #technologies. What did I get back home with? As a first-time WSIS attendee, I was particularly surprised by the level of attention given to \"basic issues\", like digital #connectivity and building the #infrastructure to make it possible. Connectivity is indeed emerging as a crucial #SDG enabler. There also seem to be a #consensus about the role of multi-stakeholder #alliances in creating more #opportunities for the third of humanity still not connected to the internet. No government or company can make it without #collaborating across different sectors and industries. This new way of thinking and working is not #given but require #intentionality. In this sense, I have been pleased to see how transversal #capacitybuilding is emerging as a meaningful connectivity #multiplier. Beyond Summits and Conferences, we need more learning #safespaces to make sure digital transformation leaves no one behind. Now, off to day 2!"
