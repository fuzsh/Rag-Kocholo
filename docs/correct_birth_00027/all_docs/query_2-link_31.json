        "text": "SYDNEY, Australia — Canada's Daniel Nestor has become the first player in ATP Tour history to record 1,000 doubles victories over his career.\n\nNestor reached the milestone Monday when he teamed with Marcelo Melo of Brazil for a 6-4, 6-4 win over France's Jeremy Chardy and India's Leander Paes in men's doubles play at the Apia International Sydney.\n\nThe 43-year-old Nestor, who turned pro in 1991, has won 88 men's doubles titles on the ATP Tour. He also teamed with Sebastien Lareau to win gold for Canada at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNestor is just the fourth player to reach the 1,000-win plateau. The others — Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and Roger Federer — all did it in singles play.\n\n\"It's really special making it to 1,000 especially having my family here with me,\" Nestor said after the win. \"They made the long trip to Australia kind of for this reason. A special moment like this, it's really important to share it with others, the people that have been with me through thick and thin and through most of the victories.\"\n\nNestor won the Apia International Sydney tournament last year for the fifth time, giving him at least one men's doubles title per year for 22 straight years. He has played with 33 different partners over 24 years and is now 1,000-412 over his pro doubles career.\n\nNestor has won eight men's Grand Slam doubles trophies and four mixed doubles major championships. Combined with his Olympic title, Nestor is one of 12 players, in singles or doubles, to have won a career Golden Slam (all four majors plus Olympic gold).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is fifth all-time for weeks at No. 1 with 108 and remains the oldest player to have held the top spot on the ATP World Tour rankings. Nestor said he has had several memorable victories over his long career.\n\n\"The gold medal for sure was probably the initial highlight, winning here in Sydney in 2000 against (Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde) and their hometown crowd,\" he said. \"It was a very tough match and we were able to pull through and that was my first major title. My first Grand Slam also here in Australia. That was a little getting the monkey off my back because I'd lost a few finals, so that was important.\n\n\"And for sure the Wimbledon title. Wimbledon is the most prestigious tournament we have, and being able to win it with all the tradition, that's always been a dream of mine. I'm fortunate to have those moments.\"\n\nNestor, from Toronto, is one of just five tennis players to participate in five straight Olympic Games (Atlanta, Sydney, Athens, Beijing, and London). He also holds nearly every record in Canadian Davis Cup play including the marks for most appearances, victories, doubles wins and years played.\n\nNearly half of Nestor's victories came with Mark Knowles (464 wins, 40 titles). He also enjoyed successful runs with former partners Nenad Zimonjic (227 wins, 27 titles), Max Mirnyi (90 wins, eight titles) and Lareau (60 wins, five titles).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNestor also has a career record of 85-118 in singles play."
