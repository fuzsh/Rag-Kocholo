        "text": "In his later career, Mr. Sanchez was a deputy assistant secretary of defense for Latin American affairs during the Reagan administration. He specialized in providing Central American countries with U.S. military aid and funding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time of his retirement, Mr. Sanchez was said by federal investigators to have been linked to illegal U.S. arms deals to the so-called “contras,” anti-Sandinista rebels who were fighting the left-wing government in Nicaragua.\n\nIn the ensuing scandal, which came to be known as the Iran-Contra affair, Mr. Sanchez said that he was aware of the arms shipments but that he didn’t know their origin. He was never accused of wrongdoing.\n\nMr. Sanchez joined the CIA in 1952. His first assignment for the agency was as a field intelligence officer during the Korean War, where he recruited defectors to infiltrate North Korea.\n\nA New Mexico native and fluent Spanish speaker, Mr. Sanchez was sent to Central America to help engineer the 1954 coup against the left-leaning Guatemalan government of Jacobo Arbenz Guzman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeginning in the early 1960s, Mr. Sanchez sharpened his focus on CIA operations in Cuba.\n\n“It is obvious that the Soviets and Cubans are attempting to spread the malaise of Marxism to other countries, especially in Latin America,” Mr. Sanchez once said, defending U.S. actions against the small tropical country. “They would impose dictatorships, economic decline and human suffering on the people.”\n\nMr. Sanchez worked as the case officer in charge of Rolando Cubela, a Cuban CIA asset. Cubela was an officer in the Cuban army who had become disenchanted with Castro’s leadership. At one point, Cubela asked Mr. Sanchez to provide him with a high-powered rifle equipped with a silencer and zooming scope.\n\nInstead, on Nov. 22, 1963, Mr. Sanchez gave Cubela a hypodermic syringe filled with poison and camouflaged as a writing pen. But the assassination attempt never took place, and CIA officials later suspected that Cubela was a double agent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Sanchez later worked in Venezuela, Guatemala, Colombia and Spain before retiring from the CIA as chief of the Latin American division.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1987, Mr. Sanchez served as a senior official in the Department of Defense. An ardent anti-communist, he advocated for millions of dollars in Defense funding to aid the development of Latin American armies, especially in El Salvador.\n\n“We understand the concern of those who remember the specter of Vietnam that the war in El Salvador is being ‘Americanized,’ ” Mr. Sanchez said in 1983. “But Vietnam was 10,000 miles away. El Salvador is a contiguous region right at our doorstep. San Salvador is closer to Washington, D.C., than is San Francisco.”\n\nNestor Daniel Sanchez was born July 28, 1927, in Magdalena, N.M. He grew up on a cattle ranch.\n\nHe was 1950 graduate of the New Mexico Military Institute and later received a master’s degree in geopolitics from Georgetown University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom 1955 to 1959, Mr. Sanchez was posted to Morocco under State Department cover, where he oversaw intelligence gathering operations from a small base in Casablanca. During his time there, Mr. Sanchez married Joan Russell, a fellow CIA employee working undercover in Casablanca. She died in 2008.\n\nSurvivors include four sons, John Sanchez of Crofton, Patrick Sanchez of Philadelphia, Tom Sanchez of Williamsburg and James Sanchez of McLean; two sisters; seven grandchildren; and one great-grandson."
