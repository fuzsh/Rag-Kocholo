The current belief is that Jacob was brought from Germany to America by his father to help establish a new life in Pennsylvania. His father returned to bring Jacob's mother to the new home, and was never heard from again. Jacob fought in the American Revolution and was given a tract of land in what is now Barbour County WV as payment for his service. He is buried near the town of Nestorville WV.\n\nA different family tradition communicated to C. F. Nestor by Jacob's great grandson, George Miller, Jacob \"was eight years old when he came to America, and [Jacob's] last remembrance of his mother was at sea on night when she was 'wrapped in white and laid up.' He said his mother was French. His father stayed in America about three years and then returned to Germany to settle up some business. [The father] was supposed to return on a certain voyage, but did not, nor was he ever heard from again. It was presumed that he too was lost at sea on the return to America.\"[1]\n\nJacob Nestor served with Berks County Militia, Pennsylvania Militia during the American Revolution.\n\nMilitary service: \"enrolled sometime during the period 1777-1778 as a Private, First Class, Captain Ferdinand Ritter's Eighth Company, Third Battalion, Berks County Militia, according to the evidence of the Fine Book of Berks County, page 35.\" [2]\n\nNotes\n\nFind a Grave Memorial 49677045 cites 14 Mar 1761 as DOB.[3]\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"Descendants of Jacob Nester, 1761 - 1844\" Unpublished manuscript by Carl K.
