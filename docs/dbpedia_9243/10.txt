The wife of Jneiro Jarel has set up a GoFundMe after the hip-hop producer suffered a â€œmassive, ischemic stroke" during a stay in Costa Rica, as Pitchfork points out.

In the GoFundMe description, Jarel's wife writes: "Jarel is thankfully (but slowly) on the road to recovery but is still not ambulatory, and requires 'round the clock, skilled nursing assistance at this time." She goes to say that Jarel's insurance provider is only providing funds for an 11 day hospital stay in Costa Rica, and has not communicated with the family about transportation back to the United States. "We are in desperate need of whatever contributions we can get to help cut costs, and get Jarel back to the United States as quickly as possible."
