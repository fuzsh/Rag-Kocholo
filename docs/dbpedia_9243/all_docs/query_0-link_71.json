        "text": "Out now, and taken from his forthcoming After a thousand years album, out later in the year on Far Out Recordings, is ‘Banana Peel’, the new single Brooklyn producer Jneiro Jarel.\n\nIt’s been a long road for Jarel, who had an ischemic stroke while living and working in Costa Rica, shortly after signing the deal with Far Out. Thanks to the generosity of his friends and fans, he was able to get special medical transport back to the United States to begin his treatment and recovery.\n\nThe track is a gorgeous mix of beats, Brazilian influence (taken from Jarel’s vast collection), Costa Rican folk and a splash of his own New Orleans Jazz, into something that swings as well as it wraps around you with its beats.\n\nCheck it out, here"
