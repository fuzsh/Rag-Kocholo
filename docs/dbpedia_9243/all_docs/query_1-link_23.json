        "text": "Jneiro Jarel is currently recovering in hospital after suffering \"a massive, ischemic stroke\" in Costa Rica. His wife writes, \"Jarel is thankfully (but slowly) on the road to recovery but is still not ambulatory, and requires 'round the clock, skilled nursing assistance at this time.\"\n\nAs they are seeking medical help in Costa Rica, Jarel's medical insurance only covers costs for 11 days. Jarel's wife explains, \"After having had multiple phone conversations with myself, the Costa Rican hospital's Director of International Insurance, and Air Evac International, there has still been no resolution with our insurance company to facilitate his transportation back to the US; it has now been seven days and counting.\"\n\nHis wife urges, \"We are in desperate need of whatever contributions we can get to help cut costs, and get Jarel back to the United States as quickly as possible. Continuing to stay here in Costa Rica, with no further assistance from our health insurance provider, is no longer an option. No donation is too small. Thank you in advance for your help!\"\n\nJneiro Jarel is most famous for his collaborations with MF DOOM under the name JJ DOOM. Their last project together was 2014's Bookhead EP."
