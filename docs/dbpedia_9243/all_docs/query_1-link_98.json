        "text": "DOOM,JJ - KEY TO THE KUFFS\n\nPrice: â‚¬27.99\n\nFormat: LP\n\nAvailability: Immediate Dispatch\n\nWhile in exile in England, DOOM teamed up with producer Jneiro Jarel for a\n\ncollection featuring Damon Albarn and Portisheads Beth Gibbons, among\n\nothers. Showing that he was nothing if not adaptable, and his sense of humor\n\nwas always present, even when there was good reason to be disillusioned.\n\nOn paper, a full collaborative album from Doom and space age production from Jneiro Jarel\n\ncant fail. In practice its even better. Doom is in the form of his life here. JJ produced all the\n\ntracks, Doom provided the bulk of the vocals and compiled the cut and paste skits. Doom\n\nrecorded the album while banished from the States and back living in london. He references\n\nBritish culture throughout the album, name dropping British institutions, and possibly being\n\nthe first emcee to reference My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. Jneiro recording the beats in the dirty\n\nsouth, got into a UK state mind, and turned in heavy hip hop production that leans towards\n\ngrime, dubstep and British techno. The album will appeal to fans of classic Doom material.\n\nJJs tough, far out hip hop production will appeal to fans of Dilla, Flying Lotus and el-p. It also\n\nfeatures guest appearances from Beth Gibbons, Damon Albarn and Khujo (goodie mob).\n\nAlbum artwork is by graffiti artist Steve Powers aka Espo.\n\nTracks:\n\n1. Waterlogged\n\n2. Guvnor\n\n3. Banished\n\n4. Bite The Thong feat. Damon Albarn\n\n5. Rhymin Slang\n\n6. Dawg Friendly\n\n7. Borin Convo\n\n8. Snatch That Dough\n\n9. GMO feat. Beth Gibbons\n\n10. Bout The Shoes feat. Boston Fielder\n\n11. Winter Blues\n\n12. Still Kaps feat. Khujo Goodie\n\n13. Retarded Fren\n\n14. Viberian Sun Part II\n\n15. Wash Your Hands\n\nCategories"
