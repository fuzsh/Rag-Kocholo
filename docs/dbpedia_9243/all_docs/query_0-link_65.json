They’ve all worked with the American music changer Jneiro Jarel, and come out the other side all the musically better for it.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, this artist, music producer, composer and DJ has worked a sound that meshes his early influences of jazz and hip hop with contemporary rock and electronica – it’s a little boppy, a little techno and very unpredictable. He’s upstaged JK Rowling by working under more than four pseudonyms – Dr. Who Day?, Shape of Broad Minds, Capitol Peoples etc. – and has become somewhat music royalty in the Brooklyn underground creative exchange."
