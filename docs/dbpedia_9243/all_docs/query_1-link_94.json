        "text": "Dumile Daniel Thompson (July 13, 1971 - October 31, 2020) was a British rapper and record producer. He is known for his \"super villain\" stage persona and unique lyrics. Thompson used several stage names throughout his career, most notably as MF DOOM.\n\nThompson was born in London and moved to Long Island, New York, when he was a child. He began his musical career in 1988 as a member of KMD and performed under the name Zev Love X. The group disbanded in 1993 upon the death of member DJ Subroc, who was Thompson's brother. After a hiatus from music, Thompson reemerged in 1997 when he began performing at open mic events while wearing a metal mask resembling that of Marvel Comics supervillain Doctor Doom. He adopted the persona of MF DOOM and subsequently rarely made unmasked public appearances.\n\nThompson's most prolific period was in the early-mid 2000s, when he released four studio albums and two collaborative albums with the MF DOOM moniker as well as King Geedorah and Viktor Vaughn. His sixth and final solo studio album, Born Like This, was released in 2009. Thompson never gained American citizenship and was refused entry into the United States after an international tour in 2010. Thompson settled in London during the 2010s, where he mostly worked in collaboration with other rappers.\n\nThompson frequently collaborated with other record producers and rappers on full-length projects. His most notable collaboration was with Madlib under the moniker Madvillain; their 2004 album Madvillainy received acclaim and was cited as Thompson's magnum opus. Thompson's other full-length collaborators included MF Grimm, Ghostface Killah (as DOOMSTARKS), Westside Gunn, Danger Mouse (as DANGERDOOM), Jneiro Jarel (as JJ DOOM), Bishop Nehru (as NEHRUVIANDOOM), Czarface and Trunks.\n\nOn October 31, 2020, Thompson died at the age of 49. His death was announced on December 31, 2020, but his cause of death was angioedema.
