        "text": "Inspired by his album \"Fauna\", Jneiro Jarel made some custom designs of some of his favorite animals from the rainforest. Bringing awareness to the beautiful animals is one of his missions! Unfortunately, some of these animals are endangered.\n\nStructured, six-panel, high-profile cap\n\n80% acrylic, 20% wool;\n\neight-row stitching on flat visor; 3\" crown;\n\nhard buckram backed front panels; six sewn eyelets;\n\nGreen undervisor; plastic adjustable closure;\n\nHead Circumference - 21 5/8“ to 23 5/8“\n\nAvailable in one adjustable size for a comfortable and tailored fit.\n\nAbout: Great green macaw\n\n“With so few left in Ecuador, the Awacachi Corridor, between Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the Awá Ethnic Reserve, may be an extremely important stronghold for the species.\n\nFFI is proud to have safeguarded the Corridor and to be actively supporting its conservation to this day.”\n\nBerry Mulligan\n\nFFI Americas & Caribbean Programme Officer\n\nAn image relating to Great green macaw\n\nThe image of a tropical rainforest wouldn’t be complete without a gaggle of squawking parrots. The great green macaw is one of the larger and more colourful parrots in South and Central America’s forests.\n\nSadly, as their habitat disappears, so do they. As little as 30% of its original range may remain. Fauna & Flora International (FFI) is working to save threatened Chocó rainforest in north-western Ecuador, one of the last places the bird survives in the country.\n\nGreat green macaw facts\n\nOne of the world’s largest parrots – adults can reach 85–90 cm long\n\nIntelligent, social birds that often gather in large noisy flocks\n\nMacaws boast large, powerful beaks that easily crack nuts and seeds. There is some evidence to suggest that orchids form an important part of their diet in Ecuador\n\nMacaws typically mate for life, sharing food and mutually grooming each other\n\nLives in small, highly fragmented populations from Honduras to north-western Colombia, and into western Ecuador\n\nLess than 2500 individuals remain, with roughly 60-90 individuals in Ecuador\n\nThreats include habitat loss from urbanisation and agricultural expansion, hunting, illegal capture for the bird trade"
