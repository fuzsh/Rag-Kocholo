        "text": "A couple of weeks back we were able to post a video that helped you to get to know a bit more about underground rap hero, (MF) DOOM, half of JJ DOOM who are performing here on Thursday 13th June. Well, today we came across a couple of short documentaries that introduce the other person in that particular partnership - the JJ in JJ DOOM - Jneiro Jarel (pictured above right). Much like DOOM, Jarel's put music out under a number of different aliases over the years. From his early work under his own name on the Kindred Spirits label and throughout his Dr Who Dat? and Shape of Broad Minds albums on London's LEX Records imprint, he's explored the outer realms of the hip hop genre. Toying with elements of acid jazz, broken beat and other, more far out musics, he's an incredibly stylistic producer, a certified collaborator and a real driving force behind the boards, so watching these clips and diving further into his world has given us a great pleasure on this slightly hungover Friday... Catch JJ DOOM performing in Room One on Thrusday 13th June. Info/tickets here. Photo: Klaus Thymann"
