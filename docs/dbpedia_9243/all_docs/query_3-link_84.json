I ended up going and fell in love with the place,\" says the nomadic producer Jneiro Jarel (also known as Dr. Who Dat?). Thus came about \"Cahuita,\" Jarel's ode to the Costa Rican beachy paradise. A slice of experimental hip-hop made of live instrumentation and sampled bird calls, the track carries the grooves of LA's beat community, where Jarel spent several years collaborating with artists like Flying Lotus and Daedelus.\n\nCheck out the resulting Track: \"Cahuita\"\n\nWa' apin, man?
