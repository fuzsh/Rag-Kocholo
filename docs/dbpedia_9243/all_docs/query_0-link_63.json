        "text": "Jneiro Jarel – After a Thousand Years\n\nYo! The homie Jneiro Jarel is back! In 2018 he signed a record deal with Far Out Recordings. After putting the final touches on the record back then he suffered an ischemic stroke while living and working in Costa Rica. This obviously put a halt to the release of that record. He has been able to get the care he needs and is on the long road to recovery. In 2020, Far Out Recordings is now releasing that record called After A Thousand Years. We’ve known Jneiro well since he first lived in Philly and NY. His music has always been ahead of its time. This album is in the same tradition. Pulling from the soundscapes of Central and South America Jneiro creates a lush score to an exciting and romantic love affair with the culture and vibes that are warm and vivacious. He usually aliases Dr. Who Dat? and Capital Peoples but collaborations with Bill Summers, Masauko Chipembere, Scott Burton and Cafe, Micröclimate round out this album nicely. It seems like a thousand years, but well worth the wait. Hopefully we can snag a copy on vinyl before they're gone."
