        "text": "Update 2019: Indigo Eden is probably my favorite of the pre 2011. This is still one of my favorite paintings I did of this era of music inspired portraits.\n\nHere’s my original post of Jneiro typography. Some songs of his I didn’t mention in that one are: Brooklyn mood, Nights over Nantes, and Viberian Sun . Why’d I put down this due? Because there is something vibrant, funky, and experimental in his music. I hear it."
