        "text": "Producers who are well ahead of the game often don’t get honored as highly as those who copped their ideas. For twenty years Jneiro Jarel has been dropping science on the electronic and hip hop game. Always light years ahead of everyone else, his work with MF Doom under JJ Doom alone is on another level. On his new full length After a Thousand Years Jarel ticks up things a bit more and extends how far ahead he is from the rest of the music industry.\n\n[bandcamp width=350 height=470 album=256010212 size=large bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 tracklist=false]\n\nThe album opens with “If I Could See Heaven Without Dying (feat. Scott Burton),” the producer takes your ears on a journey of string based delight. Here the song as with the rest of the album, a rhythmic presence plays out. Jarel uses symphonic tones and an acoustic guitar to offer a blissful sound that washes over you like warm air. This is followed up by “Ce-les-tial” where the producer uses a more South American vibe. By chopping an acoustic and making it the beat, he turns what sounds traditional on its ear to create one of the most forward tracks you’ll hear all year.\n\nWhile that continues throughout, there’s just a whole new way of thinking here. The nomadic producer has never rested which may explain this new charge in direction. On “Just A Little While Longer” he stares into the face of modern music with quick bpm of jungle beats, with “Broken Arted” he employs Eastern instrumentation with tropical vibes to hone in on a sound that comes across like nothing you’ve heard before and on “Banana Peel-Cascara-de-Platano (feat. Masauko Chipembere)” he takes that rhythm and re-imagines what rhythm can be.\n\nBut the favored song here comes on “Let the Cuica Play (feat. Cafe, Microclimate).” Bringing in jazz against Tropicalia, Jarel extends by genres by placing them together with a hip hop pacing. It’s so ahead of everything in that it takes old world styles and reinvents how they can sound. It’s remarkable and future, like everything the producer touches.\n\nAfter a Thousand Years can be purchased on various formats directly from Far Out Recordings. The album is also available to stream on all services or it can be purchased digitally wherever you download music."
