        "text": "Inspired by his album \"Fauna\", Jneiro Jarel made some custom designs of some of his favorite animals from the rainforest. Bringing awareness to the beautiful animals is one of his missions! Unfortunately, some of these animals are endangered.\n\nStructured, high-profile, 6-panel cap\n\n15% Wool 85% Acrylic\n\nFirm Front Panel\n\nSeamed Front Panel with Full Buckram\n\n6 Embroidered Eyelets Matching Crown Color\n\nPro Stitch on Crown\n\n8 Rows Stitching on Visor\n\nGray Undervisor\n\nPlastic Snap Closure\n\nHead Circumference - 22“ to 24“\n\nAvailable in one adjustable size for a comfortable and tailored fit.\n\nThe green basilisk lizard is also called a plumed or double-crested basilisk; but its amazing ability to run on water gives this species its most recognizable moniker: the Jesus Christ lizard.\n\nAbundant in the tropical rain forests of Central America, from southern Mexico to Panama, green basilisks spend much of their time in the trees and are never far from a body of water. When threatened, they can drop from a tree into the water and sprint, upright, about 5 feet (1.5 meters) per second across the surface.\n\nTo accomplish this, they have long toes on their rear feet with fringes of skin that unfurl in the water, increasing surface area. As they rapidly churn their legs, they slap their splayed feet hard against the water, creating a tiny air pocket that keeps them from sinking, provided they maintain their speed. They can move along the surface like this for 15 feet (4.5 meters) or more. When gravity eventually does take over, the basilisk resorts to its excellent swimming skills to continue its flight.\n\nPart of the iguana family, green basilisks grow to about 2 feet (61 centimeters) in length, including their long, whip-like tail. Males have distinctive, high crests on their heads and backs, which they use to impress females.\n\nPregnant females prepare a shallow trench where they lay up to 20 eggs. The mother then leaves the eggs to hatch on their own. Hatchlings are born with the ability to run (on land and water), climb, and swim.\n\nGreen basilisks are omnivores, surviving on a diet of plant material, insects, fruit, and small vertebrates. They are common throughout their range and have no special status, but abundant natural predators like snakes and birds keep these amazing lizards on their toes\n\nSource\n\nhttp://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/green-basilisk-lizard/"
