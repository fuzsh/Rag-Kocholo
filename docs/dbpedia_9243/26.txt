Jneiro Jarel is seeking help with medical funds after suffering a “massive, ischemic stroke” in Costa Rica. The producer and MF DOOM collaborator’s wife, the actor Indigo, has launched a GoFundMe following difficulties with Jarel’s insurance provider. “Due to the urgency of our current circumstances, I have decided to go public,” Indigo writes, adding that Jarel “is still not ambulatory and requires ’round the clock, skilled nursing assistance.” They’re raising funds to fly him back to the United States for “his required inpatient treatment and post stroke rehabilitation.” Donate here.
