        "text": "Ludovica and her two daughters set off to Bad Ischl in August of 1853 and arrived late. Still in their mourning clothes (they were mourning the death of their Aunt Sophie, not the Austrian Archduchess but another aunt by the same named), they were presented to Sophie and Elise, Helene and Elisabeth's aunt. Helene was introduced to the Emperor Franz Josef who was somewhat taken with her but at a dinner one night Franz Josef happened to glance away from Helene, who was seated right next to him, and noticed Elisabeth, sitting far away from him as the seats were set up according to titles and positions. Although Franz spent a lot of time courting Helene, he soon started to notice Elisabeth more and more until finally at a small ball one night he asked Elisabeth to dance and was smitten with her. Within days the news was announced that Franz Josef had told his mother, Sophie that he planned to marry Elisabeth instead of Helene.\n\nFranz began to court Elisabeth in the way he had Helene and showed her the many splendors of his life. Sophie in did not approve of Elisabeth, nor did Ludovica, who was somewhat embarrassed by this match for she knew how immature and unprepared Elisabeth was for the role of Empress of Austria.\n\nElisabeth, her disappointed mother, and her depressed sister left Bad Ischl on August 31, 1853. As soon as she had arrived home, Elisabeth was consumed into lessons on how to be an empress. She studied the strict etiquette of the court, the fashions, the people who would have roles in her life, and the languages and history of her new country. Painters, designers, and jewelers flocked to the once calm and serene Possenhofen. Elisabeth even once described herself as a hive and all of these people were bees flocking to her.\n\nFranz Josef paid a visit to his fianc√©e around Christmas of 1853, after 3 months of love letter writing. He only managed to stay for a few days as his duties in Vienna called him away from Elisabeth, but she was content and returned to the end of her studies and the beginning of the packing of her trousseau, which included 358 dresses, clothes, shoes, combs, and many other fashion items.\n\nOn April 20, 1854, Elisabeth left with her mother and sister for Vienna, saying goodbye to her brother, sisters, her father, her pets, and Possenhofen forever. The Emperor met her at Linz, Austria on April 21 and the next morning they left for Vienna onboard of a barge. When Elisabeth arrived in Vienna, Archduchess Sophie introduced her to the court at Schloss Schonbrunn and her new entourage, including her handmaidens, ladies-in-waiting, and personal servants."
