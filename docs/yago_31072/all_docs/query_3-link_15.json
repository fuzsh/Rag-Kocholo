As his eldest daughter, Sophie would have stood to inherit the Bavarian throne. However, King Franz issued letters patent excluding Sophie and her children from the line of succession to prevent Liechtenstein and Bavaria coming under joint rule. In a statement from the princely court, Sophie confirmed that she supported her uncle's decision.\n\nMarriage and Issue[]\n\nOn 23 February 1993, Sophie's engagement to Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein was announced. Alois and Sophie were married on 3 July 1993 in Vaduz. The couple have four children - Joseph Wenzel, Marie-Caroline, Georg, and Nikolaus.\n\nResidences[]\n\nSartorial Information[]\n\nTiara Collection[]\n\nAs First Lady of the Court, Sophie has access to the entirety of the Liechtenstein Tiara Collection.
