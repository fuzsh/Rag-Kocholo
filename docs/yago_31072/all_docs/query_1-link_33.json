        "text": "We pay a visit today to Maria José of Braganza, who was the second wife of Karl Theodor of Bavaria, brother of Empress Sissi, and grandmother of Maria José of Savoy, the last queen of Italy.\n\nLet us therefore go back to the second half of the 19th century and discover together the history of this noblewoman.\n\nThe Infanta Maria José of Portugal (1857-1943), sometimes known as Maria Josepha, was a Portuguese infanta, fourth child and third female of King Miguel I of Portugal and his wife Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Her sisters included Maria Ana, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and Maria Antónia, Duchess of Parma. His only brother was Miguel, Duke of Braganza.\n\nAt the age of 17 Maria José met Karl Theodor of Bavaria, a descendant of the cadet branch of the Wittelsbach family. Karl Theodor was the son of Princess Ludovika of Bavaria, but more importantly he was the brother of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, known as Sissi.\n\nKarl Theodor was the widower of Princess Sophie of Saxony and by her he had a daughter, Maria Amelia. Despite the considerable age difference between the duke and the Infanta Maria Josè, around 18 years old, Karl Theodor fell in love with Maria Josè as she showed an intelligence and maturity beyond her age.\n\nThe couple married on 29 April 1874 and their marriage was a rare example of marital harmony and happiness.\n\nShe was attracted by the charismatic personality of her husband, a very cultured and refined person, and also a talented musician, appreciating above all his intelligence. Karl Theodor was never interested in politics and his whole life was dedicated to medicine. A renowned ophthalmologist, he founded numerous clinics that still bear his name today, where he treated needy people from all walks of life free of charge.\n\nThe marriage of Karl Theodor and Maria José was blessed by the arrival of five children: Sophie Adelheid born in 1875; Elisabeth born in 1876, future queen of Belgium and mother of the last queen of Italy; Marie Gabrielle born in 1878; Ludwig Wilhelm born in 1884 and finally Franz Joseph born in 1888.\n\nMaria José brought so much warmth and spontaneity to her new family. She was able to understand, with the innate tact she possessed, the mentality of her husband’s family members, who were both romantic and eccentric.\n\nDeeply religious and practising, she strictly supervised her daughters’ education, trying to inculcate in them a strong sense of duty and respect for traditions and social conventions. With her sons, on the other hand, she was more lenient.\n\nWidowed since 1909, Maria José died on 11 March 1943, during the Second World War, in Possenhofen, the family home where Hitler, by an exceptional concession, had allowed her to live in the last years of her life.\n\nNow it is your turn, which image of this duchess do you like best?"
