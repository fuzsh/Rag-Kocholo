        "text": "I would want the third child to be a Princess after two Princes.\n\nAs for the name, Estelle, Silvia, Ewa, Mary, Leonore, Lilian, Maria, Adrienne, Josephine and Alice have all been used. I would suggest Louise, Eugenie and Charlotte. I would want Louise to be the tilltalsnamn as Eugenie and Charlotte are too associated with the British Royal Family.\n\nFor a Prince, Nicolas, Paul, Gustaf, Oscar, Carl, Olof, Alexander, Erik, Hubertus, Bertil, Gabriel and Walther have all been used. I would suggest Eugen, Ludvig, Sigvard, Lennart, Folke and Johan.\n\nAs for the dukedom, since the Prince Couple's dukedoms are all in Svealand (Värmland for Carl Philip, Södermanland for Alexander, Dalarna for Gabriel), I would expect it to be Västmanland (last held by Erik, 1889-1918), Närke (last held by Eugen, 1865-1947), Uppland (last held by Sigvard, 1907-2002, whose spouse is still alive. Dukedom officially stripped in 1934.). Since Västmanland has the longest period of inactivity, I would suggest Västmanland to be the dukedom.\n\nSo, in short, I'm going for Princess Louise Eugenie Charlotte, Duchess of Västmanland.\n\nHalland would indeed be a beautiful nod to prince Bertil's heritage.\n\nAnd I agree that a Duchy cannot be taken for granted but I don't think that the king would want this grandchild to be the only one without a ducal title (and especially not one in the male line), so my expectation is that this grandchild will also receive a duchy like his/her brothers and cousins.\n\nYes, that's a good point. I mainly wondered whether his lawyers might believe he is pushing the boundaries by granting a duchy outside the Royal House for the first time in modern times, but since no one cared enough to object to the ex-members of the Royal House keeping their duchies, it is very unlikely to be an issue.\n\nI agree that the King has shown special favor for his male descendants in male line, including on the subject of duchies (as Somebody and I discussed recently in Titles of the Swedish RF and Changes 2019), but it's doubtful he would have the same sentiments for female descendants in male line. That is why I think Halland may be likelier for a son than a daughter.\n\nLooked up the full names of their sons:\n\nAlexander Erik Hubertus Bertil\n\nAlexander: personal preference?\n\nErik: Sofia's father\n\nHubertus: one of Carl Gustav's middle names\n\nBertil: CP's godfather and one of his middle names\n\nGabriel Carl Walther\n\nGabriel: personal preference?\n\nCarl: first name of both Gabriel's father and paternal grandfather and CP's maternal grandfather (although he was known by his third name)\n\nWalther: (third) name of CP's maternal grandfather\n\nSo, I'm guessing probably 3 names again with the first name based on personal preference and middle names more traditional and in reference to family members.\n\nBoy: Ferdinand Andreas Gustaf\n\nFerdinand as the unexpected -but still rather traditional- first name (I also liked the idea of a prince Lars but that would be rather short in comparison to his brothers; both Lars and Ferdinand can be found in Sofia's family tree but only once). Andreas in reference to both CP's godfather and Sofia's great-grandfather. Also hoping for a Gustaf this time; so, all three are named after the king... If they'd like to be a little more original they could pick 'Folke' instead - but that would be two names with an F. I doubted about including Oskar (or Oscar) in the name as it would fit nicely with both sides of the family but as there already is a cousin Oscar, it's probably not the most likely pick.\n\nGirl: Ingrid Renate Britt\n\nIn both cases the grandmother's second name; 'Britt' is also the name of Sofia's maternal grandmother; Estelle is already used Silvia, so I figured that Renate might be nice instead, although I wouldn't surprised if they use Silvia none the less) - as I've no idea what they might pick as a first name (I would never have guessed 'Gabriel' to go with 'Alexander') I decided to stick with Ingrid which is a name that can be found in the larger family tree of CP and of Sofia (with both Ingrid and Ingegerd - which to me look a lot a like but maybe that's not the way it is perceived in Sweden).\n\nFor those interested in the family names on Sofia's side of the family (information taken from link (website seems a bit sketchy but the information seems legit). Names that occur more than ones (in whichever spelling are in bold).\n\nPaternal side:\n\nFather: Erik Oscar\n\nPaternal grandfather: Stif Ingvar\n\nPaternal grandfather's parents: Erik Andreas Emanuel & Frida Kristina\n\nGreat-grandfather's parents: Anders Fredrik & Anna Charlotta\n\nGreat-grandmother's parents: Joel Fredrik & Johanna\n\nPaternal grandmother: Ingrid Ann-Marie\n\nPaternal grandmother's parents: Oskar Petrus & Lily Kristina\n\nGreat-grandfather's parents: Karl Ferdinand & Hedda Vilhelmina\n\nGreat-grandmother's parents: Carl August & Emma Helena\n\nMaternal side:\n\nMother: Marie Britt\n\nMaternal grandfather: Janne Herbert Ribbe\n\nMaternal grandfather's parents: Lars Gotthard & Maria Elisabet\n\nGreat-grandfather's parents: Jan Persson & Anna\n\nGreat-grandmother's parents: Per Johan & Gum Anna Maria\n\nMaternal grandmother: Britt Ingegerd\n\nMaternal grandmother's parents: Per Gustaf & Grund Anna Maria\n\nGreat-grandfather's parents: Per Gabrielsson & Hilma Maria\n\nGreat-grandmother's parents: Grund Erik Johan & Knif Ida Maria\n\nIf a boy : Edmund Gustaf Stig Janne\n\nIf a girl : Lilian Silvia Marie\n\nNot sure wether they will go for 4 or 3 names as Alexander has 4 and Gabriel has 3.\n\nDukedom : Norrbotten. I think they will opt for Northern Sweden but not Västerbotten. For King Carl XVI Gustaf, the Duke and Duchess of Västerbotten are very much still his parents, like he repeatedly has said that he still views himself as the Duke of Jämtland, even though a King doesn’t really have any need for a dukedom... The residential city of Norrbotten is the beautiful city of ”Luleå”. I am sure it would be most appreciated.\n\nShould they go for a southern region i think Småland has a pretty good chance. Or perhaps Småland and Öland (where Solliden Palace is) as a double dukedom.\n\nI doubt we will see anything like Bertil, Johan, Folke or such.\n\nWith their first two they chose to pick names with no family connection, simply ones they liked. And then honored the family in the middle names. I don't see them changing paths with their third child. Maddie and Chris did the same.\n\nThe siblings also have avoided repeating names. Except Carl which both Oscar and Gabriel have in their names.\n\nI think we will get a more popular name first, and then some family names.\n\nboys:\n\nTheodore Edmund Janne\n\n-Theodore is a popular name for Swedish babies, a long name like his brothers\n\n-Edmund for the king's father who went by his last middle name in the family\n\n-Janne for Sofia's paternal grandftaher\n\nElias Leopold Stif\n\n-Elias as a popular baby name\n\n-Leopold in honor of CP's godfather Prince Leopold of Bavaria\n\n-Stif in honor of Sofia's grandfather\n\nMatteo Edmund Lars\n\n-popular name\n\n-king's father\n\n-Lars Sofia's grandfather\n\nDaughter. I'd be shocked if there isn't a nod to both mothers in the name.\n\nLilly Renate Britt\n\n-popular girls name, slight nod to Lilian but still her own name\n\n-Renate for the queen as Estelle already has Silvia\n\n-Britt for Sofia's mother's middle name\n\nOlivia Marie Renate\n\n-popular girls name\n\n-Marie for Sofia's mother\n\n-Renate for the queen\n\nLinnea Silvia Marie\n\n-popular name\n\n-the queen (though I am not sure they will use her first)\n\n-Sofia's mom\n\nFreja Sibylla Marie\n\n-popular name\n\n-king's mother\n\n-Sofia's mother\n\nDukedom : Norrbotten. I think they will opt for Northern Sweden but not Västerbotten.

The residential city of Norrbotten is the beautiful city of ”Luleå”. I am sure it would be most appreciated.\n\nIf I remember correctly, there has never been a Duke of Norrbotten in Swedish History, but I prefer this dukedom to be reserved for Estelle's child if Carl XVI Gustaf can live to see his great-grandchild, so that the heir apparent to the heir apparent to the heir apparent can be the first duke/duchess of a Norrland province (as it has been so for Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten and Carl Gustaf, Duke of Jämtland.). Prior to Gustaf Adolf, no dukedom in Norrland has ever been granted.\n\nStill, I think that Härjedalen is a good choice for Grandchild No.8 if they opt for a dukedom in Northern Sweden, as this dukedom is quite a minor one compared to the others.\n\nI'm a bit back and forth on whether I think the baby will receive a heavy-weight dukedom or a new one will be created. I think the case can be made for either but considering CG's feelings towards CP, I'm leaning towards a historical duchy – regardless of whether it's a boy or a girl. I'm thinking Västerbotten or Halland.\n\nSödermanland is indeed a historical duchy, but after the dukedom of Skåne was first created in 1826, I get a feeling that the Dukedom of Södermanland is now instead granted to someone who plays the second fiddle to the Duke of Skåne (e.g. Wilhelm vs his great brother Gustaf VI Adolf, and now, Alexander vs his higher-in-line cousin Oscar).\n\nAs for Dalarna, it isn't as historical as it sounds, as it was first granted to August, Carl XIV Johan's youngest grandson, in 1831. The second Duke of Dalarna was Carl Johan, Gustaf V's fourth grandson in line to the throne, born 1916.\n\nI think that Västmanland is quite historical, as it was first used for Gustavus II Adolphus and then for Erik, the third son of Gustaf V.\n\nSödermanland is indeed a historical duchy, but after the dukedom of Skåne was first created in 1826, I get a feeling that the Dukedom of Södermanland is now instead granted to someone who plays the second fiddle to the Duke of Skåne (e.g. Wilhelm vs his great brother Gustaf VI Adolf, and now, Alexander vs his higher-in-line cousin Oscar).\n\nAs for Dalarna, it isn't as historical as it sounds, as it was first granted to August, Carl XIV Johan's youngest grandson, in 1831.

Many ”traditionalists” still views it as a part of Västerbotten wich it was until 1810\n\nHärjedalen would be interesting. Though i suspect they will stick to regions with their own residential city as they have done so far... Härjedalen is a part of the Jämtland-Härjedalen region and it’s residential city is Östersund in Jämtland.\n\nBut who knows I am quite sure that at least Halland won’t be used. The Duke and Duchess of Halland is still very much Prince Bertil and Princess Lilian in the minds of almost every swede."
