        "text": "I've been thinking about this scenario and what the ramifications could be if Louis XV had been less picky/cared more about his daughters getting married lol. Especially if any can manage to become Queen/Duchess somewhere (I know he probably wanted them all as Queens or nothing, but there's only so many to go around realistically). What alliances might he make and which daughters would he marry to who? Perhaps into Spain or Austria? I'm also interested to see how this affects the marriages of Maria Theresa's offspring, assuming it doesn't butterfly any of them away (for simplicities sake we can say it doesn't, and I am hoping to see some of Maria's other children survive like Maria Johanna and Maria Josepha)\n\nWhat alliances might he make and which daughters would he marry to who? Perhaps into Spain or Austria?\n\nI discussed this with @VVD0D95 a few years ago that \"basically\" the way to \"ensure\" this is to kill Friedrich Christian of Saxony in infancy. His mom wanted him to either abdicate his rights to the throne (and retire to a monastery) or only inherit Saxony, leaving Poland to her \"favourite\", Prince Xaver. When the topic of the dauphin's second wife was broached with Saxony, there was a suggestion of a double match (much like there had been with Spain): the dauphin would marry Maria Josepha, and Prince Xaver would marry Madame Adélaïde (conditional on Friedrich Christian renouncing his rights to Poland so Xaver could be king). Friedrich Christian refused and the idea died in the water.\n\nThe schema that we came up with:\n\nLouise Élisabeth to her OTL husband\n\nHenriette to a restored Bonnie Prince Charlie\n\nAdélaïde either to Xaver of Saxony (if his brother dies) or Max III Joseph of Bavaria (if Friedrich Christian doesn't)\n\nVictoire to Max III of Bavaria (if Adélaïde doesn't marry him) or Xaver of Saxony\n\nSophie is a bit of a wild card that ICR where we decided she ended up\n\nCourse, there are other combinations as well:\n\nBarbara of Portugal dies earlier, and Henriette marries Fernando VI like her sister was intriguing\n\nMaria Teresa Cybo's Savoiard husband isn't killed, so Ercole III needs a different wife\n\nMaria Antonietta of Spain marries Friedrich Christian/Xaver of Saxony, so the duke of Savoy needs a new wife\n\nElisabeth Auguste of Sulzbach dies in childbed with a wedding night baby, so Karl Theodor needs a new wife\n\nThe duke of Württemberg's mother (Auguste of Thurn und Taxis) accomplishes it that Maria Theresia backs the duke's sister as an Austrian proxy for either the dauphin or some French prince du sang, and one of Louis XV's daughters winds up in Stuttgart instead*\n\n*we discussed this when looking for a second wife for Bonnie Prince Charlie after Henriette died, that Frederick the Great would likely offer his sister (Anna Amalie) or his niece (Elisabeth of Bayreuth) as a potential wife for Charlie like he did OTL. In which case, if Maria Theresia still refuses the duke's request to marry Maria Elisabeth of Austria, Karl Eugen needs a new wife.\n\nLots of stuff to play with\n\nTo be fair, it wasn’t necessarily Louis XV being picky—he had the misfortune of having a vast number of daughters at time with lots of other royal families also had a lot of daughters. There was sort of an explosion of the number of surviving princesses/princes within Europe’s royal families at this time. There was a dearth of princesses and simply not enough princes for them all.\n\nLouis XV’s own daughters were also… quite the characters. Given the dearth of daughters that the king had, Cardinal Fleury convinced the king that it would be too expensive for the youngest princesses to be raised at court, and suppressed their household. They were sent to the Abbey of Fontevraud. Those that were sent to the convent had their educations badly neglected.\n\nI’d say that some of his daughters were more finicky or picky than the king himself. His daughter Adelaide, for instance was suggested as a bride for Francis Xavier of Saxony and the Prince of Conti—but both matches were considered inferior; the Saxon Prince was a second (surviving) son, while Conti was a Prince du Sang.\n\nFor some of the princesses, remaining an unwed Fille de France and maintaining their rank which they held since birth at Versailles was considered better than marrying a man of lesser rank. Of course, not all of them were like this; Henriette fell in love with Louis Philippe, heir to the Duke of Orléans and wanted to marry him. Louis XV initially agreed, but then changed his mind—iirc Louis XV was somewhat prejudiced towards the House of Orléans and feared that their influence might increase further if the heir of Orléans married one of his daughters.\n\nEven when Adelaide finally had the chance to snag a king in the 1760s when the Queen of Spain died, she still refused—allegedly she saw Charles III’s portrait and refused to marry him. The Mesdames are all quite a bunch of interesting characters!\n\nTo be fair, it wasn’t necessarily Louis XV being picky—he had the misfortune of having a vast number of daughters at time with lots of other royal families also had a lot of daughters.

There was a dearth of princesses and simply not enough princes for them all.\n\nfair point, I wasn't sure if it was him not caring or just having too many daughters, I hadn't considered other royals had too many daughters as well, but it makes sense and explains why most of them stayed unmarried, I guess I was just shocked looking at his wikipedia page and seeing that out of 6 daughters only one got married; I understand them not all getting married but only 1? But I'm probably being too harsh on old Louis lol, especially if his daughters were the ones being picky\n\nthats fair, but they did marry a few french princesses and I think Victor's grandmother was a d'Orleans, iirc\n\nIndeed. Victor Amadeus II was married to Anne Marie d'Orléans.\n\nHis son, Charles Emmanuel was fairly fluid in his alliances: fought alongside France in the War of the Polish Succession, supported Maria Theresa in the War of the Austrian Succession, sat out the Seven Years War. His son, Victor Amadeus III better relations with France: his son married Marie Clotilde, and then two of his daughters married Louis XVIII and Charles X respectively. Given that Victor Amadeus III married a Spanish princess primarily to heal relations between Turin + Madrid after the War of the Austrian Succession, there is no reason why he might not wed a French princess instead.\n\nHis son, Charles Emmanuel was fairly fluid in his alliances: fought alongside France in the War of the Polish Succession, supported Maria Theresa in the War of the Austrian Succession, sat out the Seven Years War.

She's 8 years younger than him, but if they marry when she's 15 in 1751 it will only be a year after his otl marriage to Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain\n\nif some of Maria Theresa's children's deaths by smallpox are butterflied away (namely Charles Joseph and Maria Josepha, and perhaps the scarring of Maria Elisabeth is also butterflied as well), who might they marry? Currently all their siblings are to their otl spouses, assuming all the changing marriages in France doesn't change anything drastically (I'm not sure if it would or not, I'm not as knowledgeable on 1700s politics).\n\nI also have for Louis XV's daughters:\n\nLouise Elisabeth to her otl husband Philip of Parma\n\nAnne Henriette to Charles Stuart, who is put on the throne as Charles III (I haven't figured out the how yet)\n\nLouis to his otl wife Maria Josepha of Bavaria\n\nMarie Adelaide to Francis Xavier of Saxony, who becomes Elector instead of his brother, who dies in infancy\n\nVictoire to Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria\n\nSophie to possibly Victor III Amadeus of Sardinia\n\nLouise-Marie to no one, and she still becomes a Prioress as otl\n\nif some of Maria Theresa's children's deaths by smallpox are butterflied away (namely Charles Joseph and Maria Josepha, and perhaps the scarring of Maria Elisabeth is also butterflied as well), who might they marry?

If Maria Elisabeth is not scarred she would most likely end as second wife for Louis XV. If Maria Josepha of Austria lived she would marry Ferdinand IV of Naples, with Carolina ending likely in Parma and leaving Maria Amalia free"
