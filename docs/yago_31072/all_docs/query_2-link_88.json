        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2016\n\nKingdom of Bavaria: The House of Wittelsbach ruled as Dukes, Electors, and Kings of Bavaria from 1180 until 1918. Today Bavaria is a landlocked federal state of Germany, occupying its southeastern corner. Maximilian IV Joseph, Prince-Elector of Bavaria allied his electorate with Napoleon and adopted many of the French beliefs of the Enlightenment. It was this loyal service to Napoleon through which Maximilian’s electorate was created the Kingdom of Bavaria with Maximilian at its king. He officially became the Maximilian I Joseph, the first King of Bavaria on January 1, 1806. On November 13, 1918, King Ludwig III would be the first monarch in the German Empire to be deposed at the end of World War I, bringing an end to 738 years of rule by the Wittelsbach dynasty.\n\n********************\n\nKing Ludwig I of Bavaria (Ludwig Karl August) was born on August 25, 1786, at the Hôtel des Deux-Ponts in Strasbourg, France. He was the eldest son of the future King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his first wife, Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, and was named for his godfather King Louis XVI of France.\n\nLudwig had four full siblings:\n\nPrincess Augusta (1788-1851) – married Eugène de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg, had issue\n\nPrincess Amalie (1790-1794) – died in childhood\n\nPrincess Caroline Augusta (1792-1873) – married (1) the future King Wilhelm I of Württemberg, no issue; (2) Emperor Franz I of Austria, no issue\n\nPrince Karl Theodor (1795-1875) married (1) Maria de Pétin, had issue; (2) Henriette Schöller, no issue\n\nLudwig had seven half-siblings from his father’s second marriage to Caroline of Baden:\n\nPrince Maximilian (1800-1803) – died in childhood\n\nPrincess Elisabeth Ludovika (1801-1873) – married King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, no issue\n\nPrincess Amalie Auguste (1801-1877) – married King Johann I of Saxony, had issue\n\nPrincess Sophie Friederike (1805-1872) – married Archduke Franz Karl of Austria, had issue\n\nPrincess Maria Anna Leopoldine (1805-1977) – married King Friedrich August II of Saxony, had issue\n\nPrincess Ludovika Wilhelmine (1808-1892) – married Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria, had issue\n\nPrincess Maximiliana (1810-1821) – died in childhood\n\nWhen Ludwig was born, his father was serving with the French army stationed at Strasbourg. By the time he was 13, his father had become Duke of Zweibrücken, and then Elector of Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine. On January 1, 1806, Ludwig became Crown Prince when his father became the first King of Bavaria.\n\nLudwig studied with Johann Michael Sailer at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Landshut (now in Munich), and the University of Göttingen, and became proficient in several languages, including French, Italian, Spanish, and Russian. He also received a strong religious education from the Catholic priest Joseph Anton Sambuga.\n\nAs was expected at the time, Ludwig also pursued a military career. Despite being against his father’s alliance with the French Emperor Napoleon I, he fought with the allied Bavarian troops in the French wars. He served as commander of the 1st Bavarian Division in VII Corps and led his division into the Battle of Abensberg in 1809. At the Treaty of Ried in 1813, Bavaria left the Confederation of the Rhine and joined the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon. Just days later, Bavaria formally declared war against France, a move Ludwig strongly supported.\n\nLudwig served briefly as governor-general of the Duchy of Salzburg and spent much of the next 10 years in Würzburg and at Villa Malta, his home in Rome. During this time, he was an ardent supporter of the Greek War of Independence, even providing a loan of 1.5 million florins from his personal funds for the effort. Years later, his generosity would be rewarded when his second son Otto was named King of Greece.\n\nOn October 12, 1810, Ludwig married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, the daughter of Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen (later Duke of Saxe-Altenburg) and Duchess Charlotte Georgine of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The wedding was held in a large outdoor space called the Theresienwiese in Munich. Named for his bride, Theresienwiese is the site of Oktoberfest, held every year to commemorate the wedding.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Oktoberfest’s Royal Connection\n\nLudwig and Therese had nine children:\n\nKing Maximilian II (1811-1864) – married Princess Marie of Prussia, had issue\n\nPrincess Mathilde Caroline (1813-1862) – married Ludwig III, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, no issue\n\nPrince Otto, later King Otto I of Greece (1815-1867) – married Duchess Amalie of Oldenburg, no issue\n\nPrincess Theodelinde (1816-1817) – died in infancy\n\nLuitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria (1821-1912) – married Archduchess Auguste of Austria, had issue\n\nPrincess Adelgunde (1823 -1914) – married Francesco V, Duke of Modena, had issue\n\nPrincess Hildegard (1825-1864) – married Archduke Albert of Austria, had issue\n\nPrincess Alexandra (1826-1875) – unmarried\n\nPrince Adalbert (1828-1875) – married Infanta Amelia Philippina of Spain, had issue\n\nLudwig became King of Bavaria upon his father’s death on October 13, 1825. His reign saw the reorganization of the administrative regions of Bavaria and the establishment of the city of Ludwigshafen. The King established the Ludwig Canal between the Main and Danube rivers, and in 1835, the first German railway was constructed between the cities of Fürth and Nuremberg.\n\nHowever, his previous liberal policies became more repressive after the July Revolution of 1830. Several years earlier, he had reinstated policies of strict censorship greatly opposed by the population. In 1837, he saw the Ultramontanes, backed by the Roman Catholic Church, gained control of Parliament and begin making drastic changes to the constitution, including the removal of civil rights granted to Protestants. Ludwig himself was a strong opponent of Protestantism, but his views changed in 1841 following the funeral of his Protestant stepmother Queen Caroline. Catholic factions held large demonstrations and King Ludwig, who had a very close relationship with Queen Caroline, was greatly disturbed by the disturbances.\n\nIn 1846, Ludwig met Lola Montez, an Irish dancer and actress, who had come to Munich, and she quickly became his mistress. She was very unpopular with the Bavarian people, because of her influence over the King, and became even more so when they found out that she was trying to become a naturalized citizen. The Ultramontanes fought strongly against the naturalization, resulting in the King removing them from power. The following year, after becoming naturalized, the King granted her the title Countess of Landsfeld along with a large annuity.\n\nBy 1848, Ludwig’s reign was coming to an abrupt end. Facing protests and demonstrations by students and the middle classes, the King had ordered the university closed. Shortly after, the crowds raided the armory on their way to storm the Munich Residenz. Ludwig’s brother Karl appeased the protesters, but the damage was done. The King’s family and advisors turned against him, forcing him to sign the March Proclamation, giving substantial concessions toward a constitutional monarchy. Unwilling to rule this way, King Ludwig I abdicated on March 20, 1848.\n\nKing Ludwig spent the rest of his life in Bavaria, devoting his time to supporting and fostering the arts. He published several books of poems during his reign and translated several plays. On February 29, 1868, King Ludwig died in Nice, France, aged 81, having survived his wife and five of his children. He was buried at St. Boniface’s Abbey in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria, now in Bavaria, Germany. Keeping with tradition, his heart was entombed at the Shrine of Our Lady of Altötting in Altötting, Kingdom of Bavaria, now in Bavaria, Germany.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
