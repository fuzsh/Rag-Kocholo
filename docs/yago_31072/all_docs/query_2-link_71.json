        "text": "The duke [Maximilian in Bavaria] preferred to spend time in the private flat on the ground floor of the Palais Max, even in winter. Since the entrance faced the street, he could come and go without being noticed by the family. For example, when young Elisabeth was asked by the housekeeper if she had seen her father, who had just returned from a long journey, she replied: “No, but I heard him whistling”. Their contemporaries reported that Max and Ludovika often lived under the same roof for days without meeting. If the woman and the children wanted to see the duke, they would have to announce themselves to the servants. This distance was common in royal circles – the couple did not enter each other's flats, but had the chamber staff announce themselves. In the duke's case, it was a demonstration of how disruptive meeting his wife and children was to his daily routine.\n\nMax seemed to repeat with his children what he had suffered with his father. He showed no interest in his offspring and with such clarity that his wife's relatives were horrified. Ludovika's sister, Archduchess Sophie, wrote that the fact that her brother-in-law was “not at all occupied with his wonderful treasure”, i.e. their first-born son, was evidence of frivolity and an “almost mute heart”. Elisabeth's brother, Carl Theodor, was no less severe: he called him “egoism made flesh”.\n\nElisabeth, who as a child was called Elise by her family, grew up under her mother's wing. Ludovika's childhood had been very different from her husband's, and equally different was the attention the two devoted to their children as parents.\n\nThe duchess also repeated her childhood experiences: for her, children were the centre of everything. If her parents already considered time spent with them a desirable family happiness, Ludovika also found fulfilment in looking after her offspring. One of her daughters-in-law even described her as “a distinctly maternal being”, seeing in her a woman who lived entirely for her children. Decades later she herself would tell her granddaughter Amalie von Urach that a woman only has her children “when men go their own way”. Despite Max's lack of interest in family life, the question of whether or not to bring offspring into the world was never questioned – as the old duchess put it, “never interfere with God's plans”. Ludovika's great commitment to her children, her passionate devotion to the role of mother at that time unusual for a woman of her status regardless of any maternal feelings, was also a compensation for the lack of attention within the marriage. Max was as disinterested in her as he was in his children, and offered her little more than a few acts of kindness. There was no relationship between the two, said Ludovika's sister Sophie, who protested: “Such indifference cannot even be imagined!”\n\nIf one investigates the reasons for Max's indifference not only towards Ludovika and the children, but also towards the judgement of those around him, one must take into account not only his sad childhood, but also the unique position he occupied within the Wittelsbach dynasty. Thanks to his family constellation, he was a very special lord of the majorat: not only did he inherit the entire family fortune, but at a young age he was never subject to any restrictions from the older and higher ranking members. Duke Max could do whatever he wanted, in the true sense of the word. Consequently, as well as displaying a strong individualism from a young age, he also developed a self-centredness that left no room for complacency towards others. Ludovika's family certainly perceived his behaviour as pure disrespect, but who was supposed to tell the duke what to do? The Bavarian king, Ludovika's half-brother, so outraged by Max's behaviour, was often on the verge of lecturing him, but for some reason he always spared him. It was he – and he alone – who was in control of the house, yet he was careful not to intervene.\n\nWinkelhofer, Martina (2022). Sissi. La vera storia. Il camino della giovane imperatrice (Translation done by DeepL. Please keep in mind that in a machine translation a lot of nuance may/will be lost)\n\n@ketrindoll Nope, being a lady-in-waiting was beneath the status of an archduchess (being a paid job and all). Archduchesses had their own hofdamen and chambermaids, although how big their household was varied greatly.\n\nFor instance, this was the household of archduchess Mathilde, archduke Albrecht's daughter, in 1866. She had an Oberhofmeister, an Oberhofmeisterin, two hofdamen and two chambermaids.\n\nNow compare it with the household of archduchess Maria Annunziata, wife of archduke Karl Ludwig and therefore sister-in-law of the emperor. She had an Oberhofmeisterin, a hofdame and a chambermaid.\n\nAt that time Annunziata was one of the highest-ranking archduchesses in the empire, meanwhile the Habsburg-Teschen branch which Mathilde belonged to were the lower ranking archdukes, but because of their wealth they were completely financially independent from the emperor and chose and paid for their own staff. Now I don't know if Annunziata's smaller household was a personal decision or if they really couldn't afford one as big as Mathilde's, but my point is that the number of ladies serving an archduchess didn't had to do with her rank.\n\nThe only exemple of nobles closely related to the Habsburgs that served at court that I can think of were the descendants of Empress Marie Louise and her second husband Count Neipperg, the Princes of Montenuovo. The Montenuovos were a really interesting case, because they not only had been morganatic but also illegitimate, and in the eyes of court society this was unforgivable. And yet, unlike the aristocrats, they had Habsburg blood, which for the Montenuovos placed them above all the noble families. In 1909, Marie Louise's grandson Prince Alfred of Montenuovo became the last Oberhofmeister of emperor Franz Josef (who was his first cousin once removed, but of course they never treated each other as such), the highest-ranking and most important position a noble could aspire at court. Alfred was very unpopular among the nobles and made a personal enemy of the heir archduke Franz Ferdinand, but among his officers and servants he was appreciated."
