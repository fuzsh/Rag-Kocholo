        "text": "Duke Franz Joseph in Bavaria, full German name: Franz Joseph Michael Karl Maria Evaristus Quirinus Ottokar Herzog in Bayern (23 March 1888, Schloss Tegernsee, Kingdom of Bavaria – 23 September 1912, Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria) was a Duke in Bavaria and member of the House of Wittelsbach.\n\nFranz Joseph was the fifth and youngest child of Duke Karl Theodor in Bavaria, the son of Duke Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria; and his second wife Infanta Maria José of Portugal, the daughter of Miguel I of Portugal and Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein.\n\nFranz Joseph had one brother, Duke Ludwig Wilhelm in Bavaria and four sisters; Duchess Amalie in Bavaria, Duchess Sophie Adelheid in Bavaria, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria, Duchess Marie Gabrielle in Bavaria, and half-sister Duchess Amalie in Bavaria, from his father's previous marriage to Princess Sophie of Saxony.\n\nMilitary Career[edit]\n\nDuke Franz Joseph in Bavaria was a first lieutenant in Kaiser Wilhelm's own regiment of Uhlans, and a special instructor in the royal military riding academy in Munich. His horsemanship won him many prizes in German riding competitions.[1]\n\n1910 Visit to America[edit]\n\nDuke Franz Joseph in Bavaria visited the United States in 1910, travelling with a small party across from New York to San Francisco, before returning to the East Coast for his eventual departure home. Franz Joseph accompanied the party hunting grizzly bears though the US, meanwhile the press speculated on a possible American match for the young Duke (not uncommon for the time). The speculation was furthered when Franz Joseph himself commented on the American bride of his cousin (Prince Miguel), the lovely Anita Stewart. He also told the press that nothing would \"stand in the way\" of his American match, though that wasn't the purpose of the visit.\n\nDuke Franz Josef spent time in New York City in 1910, where he lodged at the Plaza, quickly becoming the \"most-talked-about nobleman\" to visit the US since Prince Henry of Prussia in 1902. Franz was young and did not stand on ceremony. He liked to stroll about the city without his \"suite of servants.\" His interests ranged from attending boxing matches, to catching \"a look behind the scenes in the leading Broadway comic operas.\" He also commented as to being \"highly pleased\" with American chorus girls. Before heading out west, he was widely feted in East Coast society. The local press hailed the Duke as \"the most democratic nobleman that had ever landed in New York.\" Franz Josef was introduced to numerous American debutantes, but left the country without his own 'tale of romance.' He explained that he could not marry an American \"unless he chose to lose his standing in the ducal family at home.\"\n\nPersonal Life[edit]\n\nThe young Duke Franz Josef had remained unmarried until his death in 1912, at the age of just 24 years old.\n\nHowever, through his relationship with Caroline \"Lilly\" Stockhammer, he became the progenitor of the von Plottnitz-Stockhammer family, with descendants now prominent in politics, education, and the arts. He is the grandfather of the German politician Rupert von Plottnitz (Franz-Joseph Rupert Ottomar von Plottnitz-Stockhammer), born in Danzig on 4 July 1940.\n\nDeath[edit]\n\nFranz Joseph died of polio on 23 September 1912 in Munich, the very same year as two of his sisters, Marie Gabrielle and Amélie. With the loss of three children, 1912 was remembered as an \"annus horribilis\" [\"a terrible year\"] for the Wittelsbach family. Duke Franz Joseph in Bavaria was just 24.5 years old at the time of his death.\n\nAncestry[edit]\n\nTemplate:Ancestors of Duke Franz Joseph in Bavaria\n\nTitles and styles[edit]"
