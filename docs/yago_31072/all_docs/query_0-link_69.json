        "text": "Thank you Kasumi. This interview gives us a wonderful insight into the thinking of Prince Ludwig.\n\nI read it with great interest and have made a couple comment about the dialog.\n\nI felt the Prince was badgered about the death of King Ludwig II. The media person asked several inflammatory questions that I thought were totally inappropriate. The Prince did a very good job of handling the media traps:\n\nBut an autopsy would shed light on many questions.\n\nThere was then an autopsy in more than ten doctors, and several officers were present and the autopsy reports are received in full. At that time the body was dissected and written down every detail. The credibility of these documents, given the high number of eye witnesses, no serious doubt.\n\nWo sind die Berichte? Where are the reports?\n\nAs one can accuse my family really is no secrecy. Death Ludwig II in 1986 there was an extensive investigation by a former prosecutor, judges and experts in criminology. Received a financing our then family head, Duke Albrecht, even the secret archives of the House fully available. This study found on balance that a suicide was most likely. Still be free to anyone who form their own opinion on this mystery.\n\nI was involved in the exhumation and reburial of the Confederate soldier and pop icon, Jesse James. There was a forensic autopsy by eminent scholars but it did not put to rest all the questions surrounding the assassination.\n\nI thought the answer to this question was particularly well done:\n\nWhat is the role of the Chapter or for Bayern?\n\nI find it difficult to give a good answer to this question, one should, after all, not even rate. Our family head Franz Herzog's philosophy is that it is the duty of every responsible citizen to fully work for his country. In this way he has through personal involvement, especially in the cultural field, helped many projects to success.\n\nDon’t we wish that our politicians today were as articulate as Prince Ludwig?\n\nI had a lovely time in Munich indeed, sadly it was too short (3 1/2 days).The city was quite quiet, not too many tourists, a very good public transport system and everything is very clean. The Alte Pinakothek was amazing, as was Schloss Nymphenburg. I attended the Pentacost mass of cardinal Reinhard Marx (with parts of Mozarts coronation mass) and a Robert Schumann concert in the Prinzregenttheater. I also went jogging in the Englischer garten in the morning, which was quite nice, esp. the monopteros. But there are so many things to see in and around the city that I hope to go back soon. Sadly I forgot to look for a good book about the Bavarian kings/dukes.\n\n------\n\nTo Kataryn: I was at loss how to call her.Does anybody know what her background is btw? Was the marriage approved immidiately (in 1979 by Duke Albrecht?) or later?\n\n---\n\nAn article from the suddeautsche zeitung with a picture gallery. On the picture shown you can see prince Rasso (thanks Stefan!) greeting duchess Elisabeth:\n\nLudwig II.: Gedenkfeier - Ein Gebet für den Märchenkönig - Bild 8 - Starnberg - sueddeutsche.de\n\nAnother article: Gedenkfeier für Ludwig II. - \"Wir sehen unsere eigenen Träume\" - Starnberg - sueddeutsche.de It says that princess Ursula was also there.\n\n---\n\nAn article from Merkur.de:\n\nLudwig II.: Hunderte erinnern an Märchenkönig - Berg - Kreis Starnberg - Lokales - merkur-online\n\nAnd a picture, showing duchess Helene in Bavaria behind her parents:\n\nhttp://www.merkur-online.de/bilder/2011/06/13/1281889/1869460692-25224417.9.jpg\n\nAnd here behind the duchess in Bavaria, you can see prince Ludwig, eldest son of prince Luitpold and probably the future duke: http://www.merkur-online.de/bilder/2011/06/13/1281889/1348202414-25224426.9.jpg\n\ngroup photo: http://www.merkur-online.de/bilder/2011/06/13/1281889/1900474330-25224455.9.jpg\n\nThe royal family had to share the caption with the others, so they are identified as 'fans of Ludwig II' .\n\nI had a lovely time in Munich indeed, sadly it was too short (3 1/2 days).The city was quite quiet, not too many tourists, a very good public transport system and everything is very clean. The Alte Pinakothek was amazing, as was Schloss Nymphenburg. I attended the Pentacost mass of cardinal Reinhard Marx (with parts of Mozarts coronation mass) and a Robert Schumann concert in the Prinzregenttheater. I also went jogging in the Englischer garten in the morning, which was quite nice, esp. the monopteros. But there are so many things to see in and around the city that I hope to go back soon. Sadly I forgot to look for a good book about the Bavarian kings/dukes.\n\n------\n\nTo Kataryn: I was at loss how to call her.Does anybody know what her background is btw? Was the marriage approved immidiately (in 1979 by Duke Albrecht?) or later?\n\nSo you have a reason tio come again to Munich.\n\nAs for Princess Beatrix. The marriage was a morgantic a first but she did become Princess Beatrix but not HRH. In 1999 this marriage (and the marriages of Prince Poldi and his brother Adalbert) where approved by a Family Council and the 3 Princesses and thir children became HRH.\n\nThank you for sharing the video. The gentle grace and infectious smile displayed by Duke Franz (King Francis II) is remarkable. While I watched the tape I had an odd prescient feeling. I could not put my finger on it so I watched the video again.\n\nAs an artist one learns to pay attention to details and nuance. When I carefully viewed the video I remembered another image that I had recently worked with. Coincidentally, we have been publishing a series of essays about cultural history. In the latest article we used the exquisite Maurice de la Tour portrait of Charles Edward Stewart (Bonnie Prince Charles) as the introductory illustration (click here).\n\nReviewing the video I thought I saw a certain similarity between the two images. But when I analyzed some of the images frame-by-frame I saw something I thought was remarkable. Although there were other places; at the 3 min/09 or 10sec point the sight was extraordinary.\n\nThere are some problems comparing the portrait of Prince Charles Edward and the video of his relative Duke Franz. Of course the age of the man in the portrait and the man in the video is quite different and Prince Charles is not wearing eyeglasses and Duke Franz is not wearing a wig. However, the similarity in facial expression, likeness, and the more intangible projection of personality and regal bearing is unmistakable to me. Even after some 260 years something ethereal seems to lace the two images together that transcend genetics.\n\n'A bit of a love story, a bit of a mystery'\n\nFor almost 500 years their love has been frustrated, their desire to be together thwarted by politics, parents and, most recently, by provenance. Now they are together again, only briefly, at the National Gallery of Canada, where a mystery that helped to keep them apart has finally been settled by technology and some curatorial detective work.\n\nThey are Ursula von Weichs and her lover, Duke Ludwig X of Bavaria, and they were painted by German artist Barthel Beham in 1531. The paintings hung side by side in the duke's palace and then, after his death in 1545, their trail was lost. At some point they re-entered art history and came into the collection of the royal family of Liechtenstein, where they remained until just after the Second World War, when the prince of Liechtenstein decided to sell some of the family's vast collection. The prince kept the portrait of Duke Ludwig, and sold the portrait of Ursula to the National Gallery in Ottawa.\n\nA funny thing happened on the way to Canada: Poor Ursula lost her identity, and for many years, perhaps centuries, was thought to be a man. Oh, the indignity.\n\nHowever, the similarity in facial expression, likeness, and the more intangible projection of personality and regal bearing is unmistakable to me. Even after some 260 years something ethereal seems to lace the two images together that transcend genetics.\n\nDifficult thing, this. Because how much Stuart is in Bonnie Prince Charlie and how much in Duke Franz? Is it the Stuart side after all which defines the type of men they are?\n\nMary Queen of Scots was half-French, a quarter Stuart and a quarter Tudor.\n\nHer only son brought more Tudor-blood into the mix due to his father's ancestry. He married a Danish princess. Their two surviving children Charles I. and Elizabeth of the Palatinate, queen of Bohemia gave 19! children to Mary Queen of Scots as grandmother.\n\nBoth Franz and Bonnie Prince Charlie came from the line of Charles I.\n\nToday Franz is the most senior Catholic descendant of Mary Queen of Scots and her son James I./VI.while the Queen (who is a descendant of Elizabeth Stuart/ of the Palatinate/of Bohemia) is the most senior Protestant descendant according to the rules of succession to the English and Scottish thrones.\n\nBut when we look for bloodlines, I have yet to see a current living European Royal except maybe the Russians who has no blood connection to James I/VI. and thus to the Stuarts. Eg. the Bourbons: the Orleans-line is descended from Elisabeth Charlotte of Orleans, who was great-granddaughter of James I./VI. (via Elizabeth Stuart) as a princess of the Palatinate. Her uncle's (himself a grandson of James I./VI of the Palatinate) daughter married into the next senior Bourbon-line, the Condés/Contis.\n\nAnother line is the Habsburg-Lothringen: each and any of them has a senior Catholic claim to the British throne (but then Duke Franz of Bavaria is first), as their ancestor Franz of Lorraine was a Stuart descendant. As were the female descendants of Emperor Joseph I (of Habsburg) due to his marriage to a Stuart descendant which in the end led to most of Saxony's Royalty being descendants of Mary Queen of Scots.\n\nYou get the picture....\n\nIn the end, I guess is simply chance if shared genetics lead to shared features. Or so.\n\nBut when we look for bloodlines, I have yet to see a current living European Royal except maybe the Russians who has no blood connection to James I/VI. and thus to the Stuarts.\n\nEvery member of Russian Imperial House living today is descendant of Queen Mary of Scots...Sophia Dorothea von Wuerttemberg,wife of Emperor Paul is a descendant of James I via his daughter Elizabeth and since all her descendants were members of the Imperial House,they are connected to the Stuarts,descended from them in precise...\n\nHere is the line\n\nKing James I/VI of England-Scotland (1566-1625)\n\nI\n\nPrincess Elizabeth of England (1596-1662)\n\nI\n\nPrincess Sophie von der Pfalz (1630-1714)\n\nI\n\nPrincess Sophia Charlotte von Hannover (1668-1705)\n\nI\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm I in Prussia (1688-1740)\n\nI\n\nPrincess Sophie of Prussia (1715-1765)\n\nI\n\nPrincess Sophia Dorothea von Brandenburg-Schwedt (1736-1798)\n\nI\n\nPrincess Sophia Dorothea von Wuerrtemberg (1759-1828)\n\nI\n\nMembers of Russian Imperial Family including Emperoros"
