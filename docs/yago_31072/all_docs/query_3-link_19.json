        "text": "Stop the royal presses: Another royal couple has welcomed a baby.\n\nOn August 6, it was announced that Prince Ludwig and Princess Sophie of Bavaria welcomed a baby boy together. A new image shared on the royal family’s Instagram account shows a stork carrying a blue baby blanket.\n\nThe caption reveals the name of their first child: Prinz Rupprecht Theodor Maria. “Mother and child are in excellent health, the young family is now enjoying their first days together,” it reads.\n\nAccording to People, Prince Ludwig is first in line of succession for the House of Wittelsbach. And now, his newborn son is second in line for the throne.\n\nPer House of Names, Prinz Rupprecht originates from the German terms hrōd and berht, which mean “bright” and “fame.” In fact, Rupprecht was a name that also belonged to their late ancestor, Crown Prince Rupprecht, who was the oldest child of Ludwig III and the last crown prince of Bavaria.\n\nThis exciting news comes over a year after Prince Ludwig and Sophie tied the knot in May 2023. Sophie-Alexandra, who currently has a Bachelor’s degree in Politics and East European Studies from University College London (UCL) in addition to a Masters in Science from the University of Oxford, married Prince Ludwig at Theatiner Church in Munich, Germany.\n\nKarl-Josef Hildenbrand/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nOn their wedding day, It was reported that Sophie fainted during the church ceremony. “A spokesperson confirmed that Princess Sophie fainted during the wedding this morning. After a drink she was fine again and the ceremony continued,” a royal blogger named ChristinZ wrote on X (formerly Twitter) after it happened.\n\nIf you didn’t already know, Prinz Rupprecht Theodor Maria is just one of three royal babies to arrive in the last few weeks. Earlier this month, Crown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa welcomed their first baby and shared a gorgeous video of the proud dad holding his little girl in his arms. And back in late July, Prince Ernst August Jr. and Princess Ekaterina of Hanover also welcomed their fourth child and revealed the name of their newborn daughter: Princess Margarita.\n\nCongrats to the happy couple!\n\nRoyal Princess’s Growing Baby Bump Is on Full Display During Latest Outing"
