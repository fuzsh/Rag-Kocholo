        "text": "From the Emperor’s Desk: There is not a lot written about today’s subject so I added to the information by drowning the post in genealogy and information about her other relatives.\n\nPrincess Margaretha of Saxony, Duchess of Saxony (May 24, 1840 – September 15, 1858) was the eighth child and fifth eldest daughter of King Johann of Saxony and his wife Princess Amalie Auguste of Bavaria who was the fourth child of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his second wife Caroline of Baden.\n\nPrincess Margaretha of Saxony was born in Dresden, then in the Kingdom of Saxony. She was the younger sister of King Albrecht of Saxony and King Georg of Saxony and Princess Sophie of Saxony.\n\nSisters Princess Margaretha and Sophie of Saxony would have many connections with the House of Wittelsbach of Bavaria and the House of Habsburg-Lorraine through thier mother, Princess Amalie Auguste of Bavaria who was one of the famous Bavarian royal sisters that made prominent royal marriages.\n\nHere they are as follow:\n\nPrincess Amalie Auguste of Bavaria was the identical twin sister of Princess Elisabeth Louise of Bavaria, later Queen of Prussia as the wife of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia.\n\nAnother sister, Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria married King Friedrich August II of Saxony, the brother of King Johann of Saxony and the father of Princess Margaretha of Saxony the focus of this blog post!\n\nAnother sister was Princess Sophie of Bavaria the wife of Archduke Franz Charles of Austria. Thier younger son was Archduke Charles Ludwig of Austria the husband of Princess Margaretha of Saxony the focus of this blog post! Thier older son was Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria.\n\nAnother sister was Princess Ludovika of Bavaria who married her cousin Maximilian Joseph, Duke in Bavaria the parents of Elisabeth in Bavaria, who was married to Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, brother of Princess Margaretha of Saxony’s husband, Archduke Charles Ludwig of Austria.\n\nPrincess Elisabeth in Bavaria’s brother was Duke Charles-Theodor in Bavaria who was married to Princess Sophie of Saxony, the sister of Princess Margaretha of Saxony the focus of this blog post!\n\nThat will make your head spin!\n\nPrincess Margaretha married her first cousin Archduke Charles Ludwig of Austria, on November 4, 1856 in Dresden. The marriage was happy, but only lasted two years and remained childless.\n\nHere is a little more background on Princess Margaretha’s husband, Archduke Charles Ludwig of Austria.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Archduke Charles Ludwig of Austria (July 30, 1833 – May 19, 1896) was born at Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, the son of Archduke Franz Charles of Austria (1802–1878) and his wife Princess Sophie of Bavaria (1805–1872). He was the younger brother of both Franz Joseph I of Austria and Maximilian I of Mexico.\n\nThrough her marriage to Princess Maria Annunciata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies Princess Margaretha became a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and an Archduchess and Princess of Austria and Princess of Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, and Tuscany.\n\nDeath\n\nOn a trip to Italy, Margaretha contracted typhoid. She died on September 15, 1858 at the age of 18 in Monza. Her heart was interred in the Hofkapelle in Innsbruck.\n\nPrincess Margaretha’s sister, Princess Sophie, didn’t fair much better either. Childbirth caused severe respiratory problems for Sophie, which progressively weakened her, although she managed to recover. However, a year later she contracted a severe case of influenza that she could not overcome. Sophie died shortly before her 22nd birthday on March 9, 1867 and was interred at Tegernsee Abbey.\n\nArchduke Charles Ludwig remarried.\n\nArchduke Charles Ludwig’s second wife, whom he married by proxy on October 16, 1862 at Rome, and in person on October 21, 1862 at Venice, was Princess Maria Annunciata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1843–1871), daughter of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies (1810–1859) and Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria (1816–1867) the eldest daughter of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg.\n\nThrough this second marriage Archduke Charles Ludwig was the father of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este (1863–1914) whose assassination ignited World War I. His grandson, was the last Emperor of Austria, Charles I-IV, King of Hungry, Bohemia and Croatia.\n\nPrincess Sophie of Saxony’s widowed husband also remarried. Duke Charles-Theodor in Bavaria second wife was Infanta Maria José of Portugal (March 19, 1857 – March 11, 1943), the fourth child and third daughter of King Miguel I of Portugal and his wife Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg.
