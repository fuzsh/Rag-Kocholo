        "text": "Albert was married in Munich on 2 October 1900 to Bavarian Duchess Elisabeth Gabrielle Valérie Marie, a Wittelsbach princess whom he had met at a family funeral. A daughter of Bavarian Duke Karl-Theodor, and his second wife, the Infanta Maria Josepha of Portugal, she was born at Possenhofen Castle, Bavaria, Germany, on 25 July 1876.\n\nThe civil wedding was conducted by Friedrich Krafft Graf von Crailsheim in the Throne Hall, and the religious wedding was conducted by Cardinal von Stein, assisted by Jakob von Türk, Confessionar of the King of Bavaria.\n\nhttps://crossoflaeken.blogspot.com/2009/10/wedding-of-albert-elisabeth.html?m=1\n\nhttps://royal-magazin.de/belgium/be...edding-jewels-gift-royal-marriage-belgian.htm\n\nPhotos:\n\nhttps://c2.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/G6b1733e3/22350749_nOe9a.jpeg\n\nhttps://c2.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/G2c181c8f/22350750_kdffb.jpeg\n\nI figured it would be different since Albert was the heir to the throne. (Leopold and Astrid had their religious ceremony in Belgium. Presumably because the Belgians wanted a wedding.)\n\nLeopolds I and II also married in Belgium, I believe.\n\nLeopold I. married in Compiegne, France. Only Leopold II. married in Brussels.\n\nanother exception was also when their daughter Marie José married the future King Umberto II. of Italy. The Wedding then did not take place in the home country of the bride but in Rome.\n\nI figured it would be different since Albert was the heir to the throne. (Leopold and Astrid had their religious ceremony in Belgium. Presumably because the Belgians wanted a wedding.)\n\nLeopolds I and II also married in Belgium, I believe.\n\nNowadays, I assume they would indeed have picked the country of the heir (for example Guillaume and Stephanie got married in Luxembourg and not in Belgium) but in earlier times - when they always married foreign princesses - it seems the tradition of marrying in the bride's home country/town was the custom even for heirs to the throne. For example, the wedding of crown prince Frederik of Denmark and princess Ingrid of Sweden in 1935 also took place in Stockholm. The crown prince would present his bride/wife to his people when travelling home after the wedding.\n\n]\n\nIn 1905 Albert's father died and he became heir to the throne,I don't think we was ever made Count of Flanders or Duke of Brabant?[\n\nIntesting question :\n\nThe Tittles were given by birth as his Father.\n\nIn 1905 he was still Son Altesse Royale le Prince Albert de Belgique, Duc de Saxe Prince de Saxe Cobourg et Gotha\n\nIn 1909 He was Sa Majesté Albert Ier Roi DES BELGES ,\n\nNowadays, I assume they would indeed have picked the country of the heir (for example Guillaume and Stephanie got married in Luxembourg and not in Belgium) but in earlier times - when they always married foreign princesses - it seems the tradition of marrying in the bride's home country/town was the custom even for heirs to the throne. For example, the wedding of crown prince Frederik of Denmark and princess Ingrid of Sweden in 1935 also took place in Stockholm. The crown prince would present his bride/wife to his people when travelling home after the wedding.\n\nIt still seems to vary a bit; Leopold II married his wife in Belgium — not Austria.\n\nI thought his uncle had at least one candidate in mind and Albert said no to her and told his uncle he wouldn't marry anyone he didn't love? Then he met Elisabeth at her aunt's funeral...\n\nIt has always felt like getting married in Munich was very handy for staying out of Uncle Leopold's way."
