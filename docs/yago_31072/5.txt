Duchess Amalie in Bavaria (24 December 1865 – 26 May 1912)

Illness and death

Childbirth caused severe respiratory problems for Sophie, which progressively weakened her, although she managed to recover. However, a year later she contracted a severe case of influenza that she could not overcome. Sophie died shortly before her 22nd birthday on 9 March 1867 and was interred at Tegernsee Abbey.
