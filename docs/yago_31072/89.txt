Biography

Duke in Bavaria, a member of the House of Wittelsbach, and a professional oculist. He was the brother of the Empress Elisabeth of Austria, and father of Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians.

Carl-Theodor was the third son of Duke Maximilian in Bavaria and of his wife, Princess Ludovika of Bavaria.

At the age of fourteen Carl-Theodor joined the Bavarian Army. In 1866 he fought in the Austro-Prussian War. In the Franco-Prussian War he served as a proprietary colonel of the 3rd Bavarian Light Horse.

On 11 February 1865, at Dresden, Carl-Theodor married his first cousin Princess Sophie of Saxony (1845–1867), daughter of King Johann of Saxony and his maternal aunt Princess Amalie Auguste of Bavaria. They had one child: Duchess Amalie in Bavaria (1865–1912) who married Wilhelm, Duke of Urach.

On 29 April 1874, at Kleinheubach, Carl-Theodor married Infanta Maria Josepha of Portugal (1857–1943), daughter of exiled King Miguel I of Portugal and Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. They had five children.

In 1877 Carl-Theodor began practising medicine in Mentone on the Côte d'Azur, often assisted by his second wife Maria Josepha. In 1880 he opened an eye-clinic in his castle at Tegernsee. In 1895 he founded the Augenklinik Herzog Carl Theodor (English: Duke Karl Theodore Eye Clinic) in Munich; the clinic in the Nymphenburger Strasse remains one of the most respected eye clinics in Bavaria to the present day. Between 1895 and 1909 Carl Theodor personally carried out more than 5,000 cataract operations as well as treating countless other eye disorders.

Carl-Theodor died on 30 November 1909, aged 70, in Kreuth, Bavaria.
