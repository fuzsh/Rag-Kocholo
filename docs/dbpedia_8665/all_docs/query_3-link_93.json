Darnton's works have been translated into French, Italian, German, Japanese, Hungarian, Korean, Dutch, Swedish, and Portuguese.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: Robert Darnton, a Princeton University professor of history, has established himself as an authority on the French Revolution and the Enlightenment. Often discussing the relationship between the two, he has, according to Lynn Hunt in the New Republic, \"always taken a sensible middle-of-the-road position on the influence of the Enlightenment\" on the revolution. His interest, instead, has led him to explore the less-trod ground of figures often less wellknown than luminaries like Voltaire and Rousseau, and he has especially written a considerable volume of material on Jacques-Pierre Brissot, as well as the popular literature in France of the time that shunned such now-famous works as Emile in favor of everything from antigovernment pamphlets to pornography. Considered by many to be, as Hunt put it, \"one of the pioneers of 'the history of the book,'\" Darnton has researched eighteenth-century France by examining police reports, book circulation figures, and the popularity of songs, creating histories that identify the culturally significant in the apparently tangential.\n\nIn his first book, Mesmerism and the End of the Enlightenment in France, Darnton studies the influence of eighteenth-century Viennese physician Franz Mesmer on the two decades immediately preceding the French Revolution. Mesmer, who developed the theory of animal magnetism, believed that magnetic forces could be used to heal physical ailments. He credited the force of his own magnetism with the results that he achieved through hypnotizing his patients. This hypnotic healing, or \"mesmerism,\" as it was called during the eighteenth century, forms the basis for Darnton's book, which the Virginia Quarterly Review deemed \"a skillful exploration of the various psychological factors that made mesmerism a widely accepted attitude during [the Enlightenment].\"\n\nDarnton's next book, The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the \"Encyclopedie,\" 1775-1800, grew out of the author's research in the Neuchâtel Archives in Switzerland, where he unearthed letters and documents dating back to the eighteenth century that pertained to the way books were written, published, and distributed at that time. Among these records, Darnton found the papers of the Societé Typographique de Neuchâtel, the Swiss publishing house that collaborated during the late eighteenth century with French entrepreneur Charles Joseph Panckoucke to revise, print, and distribute popularly priced editions of Denis Diderot's famed Encyclopedie.\n\nThe Encyclopedie was an encyclopedic series that furnished, in systematic fashion, scientific, factual information infused with progressive philosophic and political doctrine. It is generally considered an influential organ of the Age of Enlightenment, the term \"Enlightenment\" referring to a movement in late-eighteenth-century Europe to publicly promote reason and science as tools to resolve social, political, and economic issues; proponents of the Enlightenment sought to end unquestioning reliance on traditional religious and political authorities. This movement is often cited by historians as one of the forces behind the dissatisfaction and demands for social and economic reform that culminated in the French Revolution.\n\nThe philosophes, those responsible for spreading the attitudes and theories of the Enlightenment to the general populace, were condemned by most French political and religious leaders, who considered their progressive ideas seditious. And, as J. M. Roberts explained in his New York Review of Books critique of The Business of Enlightenment, as \"early as 1759 the Parlement of Paris saw behind the Encyclopedie a plot against church—indeed, religion—and the state; a royal prohibition (the second) on publication followed. In the same year came the special cachet of Papal condemnation.\" Darnton does not discuss these early years of the Encyclopedie when Diderot and his colleagues—among them such literary giants as Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Rousseau—worked on the book's production as an expensive in folio publication. Rather, Darnton focuses on the history of the Encyclopedie's publication under the direction of Panckoucke, who acquired the publication rights to the encyclopedia in 1768 and during the 1770s worked to publish revised, less expensive (and thus more accessible) editions of Diderot's work. Nonetheless, the Encyclopedie was still outlawed in France, and much of what Darnton's book reveals concerns Panckoucke's various methods of evading this prohibition.\n\nIn his review of the book, Roberts described The Business of Enlightenment as \"an immensely rich and complicated story which can be read with profit in many different ways. One way is simply for the economic and social realities of publishing history which are uncovered in astonishing detail, showing us who did the printing, made the paper, distributed the books, and how they did it.\" Among the practices revealed by Darnton's book are those of bribery, embezzlement, smuggling, promoting books through false advertising, pirating books, arranging collusive agreements among publishers, and soliciting favors from nobles and officials able to circumvent publishing regulations. As Roberts commented, \"Publishing history, as told by Professor Darnton, turns out to be much meatier and livelier than might be expected, although without his wide-ranging scholarship the story might have become mere bibliography and antiquarianism.\"\n\nIn discussing the publication and distribution of the Encyclopedie, Darnton also illuminates the issue of who might have read the Encyclopedie and how they might have been influenced by it. According to Roberts, as \"described by Darnton, the impact of the Encyclopedie turns out to be more complicated and qualified, and much less easy to summarize than the traditional mythology allows.\" For instance, the often conservative bent of the editorial revisions made to the various editions of the Encyclopedie to some extent mitigate its status as an anticlerical, antiestablishment publication. Moreover, Darnton's research shows that the majority of subscribers to both the initial and later editions were members of the French Old Regime's sociopolitical elite or those who aspired to elite status, rather than members of the merchant or industrial classes commonly associated with eighteenth-century progressive politics and beliefs. Part of the reason for this, according to The Business of Enlightenment, was that the publishers of the Encyclopedie appealed to its aristocratic subscribers by claiming to provide allencompassing knowledge in a systematic fashion, and it thus became a symbol of intellectual taste among the upper classes.\n\nIn response to the idea that Darnton's book challenges the Encyclopedie's reputation as a major force in the Enlightenment's education of the general populace and, as such, as a contributor to the revolutionary movement in France, Roberts asserted that there is another way to read Darnton's findings: \"What we need to do, perhaps, is to make an adjustment in our conception of the readiness and receptiveness of the world which awaited [the Enlightenment] and to grasp that the 'Enlightenment' had more than one message. That it was faith in systematic knowledge rather than skepticism which was important now seems clear. This is perhaps the most general of the conclusions which this study of publishing history supports and the one which takes the reader furthest away from its rich and fascinating detail.\" Commenting that Darnton's \"seemingly limited approach\" to the history of the Encyclopedie \"reveals more of the scope and limits of the Encyclopedie's influence than any other has done,\" Roberts concluded that Darnton's Business of Enlightenment \"is a major achievement of American scholarship and in the first rank of those which have been transforming our view of French history during the last twenty years.\"\n\nLike The Business of Enlightenment, Darnton's The Literary Underground of the Old Regime draws on the resources of the Neuchâtel Archives to illuminate certain aspects of publishing in the late eighteenth century—the Age of Enlightenment. But The Literary Underground also relies on police records and the archives of the Parisian printers' and booksellers' guild, and rather than focusing on the history of one prohibited publication, Darnton's third book is concerned with the illegal book trade as a whole in prerevolutionary France. In particular, Darnton discusses in this book the clandestine writing, publication, and sale of works that were censored or prohibited by France's Old Regime and the relationship between the illicit book trade and the fall of the Old Regime in 1789. He does this in six chapters—five of which were previously published as essays and one of which was originally a lecture. In the first chapter of The Literary Underground of the Old Regime, titled \"High Enlightenment and the Low Life in Literature,\" Darnton delineates the differences between such established, wellknown eighteenth-century authors as Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau and what Darnton calls the \"Grub Street\" writers of Paris—those who came to the French capital in the late-eighteenth century determined to achieve the literary success of a Voltaire or Rousseau but who finally, after failing to gain a livelihood through legitimate literary endeavors, resorted to performing hack work. According to Darnton the disappointment and degradation of these hack writers made them bitter toward the literary and political entities that rejected them. The disappointment of these Grub Street writers also made them likely to embrace subversive views, not out of ideological conviction but out of vengeance. Concluded Darnton, \"It was from [Grub Street's] visceral hatred, not from the refined abstractions of the contented cultural elite, that the extreme … revolution found its authentic voice.\"\n\nIn the next four chapters of The Literary Underground of the Old Regime, Darnton develops his idea that the disaffected writers and publishers, disillusioned by their exclusion from the restricted, privileged world of legitimate French publishing, acted as a force in the French Revolution through the French literary underground, by lampooning the Old Regime and promoting the revolutionary ideals of liberty and equality. Darnton illustrates this proposition by examining the lives of four individuals who participated in the literary underground. One of them, Jacques-Pierre Brissot, was a journalist who, according to documentation discovered by Darnton, turned police informer in 1784 after serving time in the Bastille prison for allegedly publishing pornography. Darnton explains in The Literary Underground that Brissot's imprisonment in Paris and employment as a police spy pushed him to become a leader in the Revolution: \"It corrupted him, and in the corrupting it confirmed his hatred of the Old Regime. How he must have hated it! How he must have raged inwardly against the system of arbitrary power that first struck him down and then enlisted him in its service. How he must have reviled the men in control of the system, who first blocked his attempts to win honor for himself and then dishonored him by making him their agent.\" Darnton's other illustrative studies focus on the careers of an underground bookseller, a printer, and a hack pamphleteer. And Darnton's closing chapter, titled \"Ready, Writing, and Publishing,\" addresses the issue of what was read by whom in the years just prior to the French Revolution.\n\nCritical reception of The Literary Underground of the Old Regime as a whole was positive, although some critics questioned a few of Darnton's methods and conclusions. Raymond Birn, who critiqued the book in the American Historical Review, expressed concern that Darnton \"may fit writers … too neatly into defined social categories, and at times … substitutes what writers 'must have felt' for what they actually wrote.\" Norman Hampson voiced similar concerns in his New York Review of Books critique of The Literary Underground of the Old Regime and further noted Darnton's dependence on the production and sale of books as indications of their import: \"He is generally content to treat books as commodities rather than as expressions of ideas…. [An] examination of what people like Brissot … actually wrote might have changed his views about what they 'must have' felt.\" Moreover, Hampson continued, when it comes to \"Darnton's conclusion that by 1789 the literary underworld had made a significant contribution to undermining the old order … everyone is on dangerous ground since we still do not know with any precision what books were sold or who bought them.\" And even if scholars did know, concluded Hampson, \"we might still be a long way from understanding their effects.\"\n\nHampson conceded, however, that to \"suggest that things were rather more complicated and untidy\" than Darnton depicts in The Literary Underground \"is not to imply that Darnton is wrong, merely that one must bring in factors that he excludes and that his truths have to coexist with others.\" This said, the New York Review of Books critic deemed the book \"splendid historical writing\" and remarked of Darnton: \"His imaginative reconstruction of the [Parisian] Grub Street world, and its enforced subordination of principle to the need for survival, illuminates the later revolutionary press, whose editors came mostly from the literary underground. All this has earned Darnton a well-justified reputation as one of the most original contributors to our understanding of life in prerevolutionary Paris.\" Margaret Peters similarly commented in the New York Times Book Review: \"The reader who wants a glimpse of the world behind a very unusual literature and an enlightening look at a famous time in history will get an eyeful in this surprising and entertaining volume.\" With regard to Darnton's use of the Neuchâtel Archives, Hampson noted, \"He has an enviable gift for reading between the lines, extracting meaning and life from unpromising material, and finding relations between things that have no obvious connection with each other. Whatever he writes is stimulating to read.\" In his American Historical Review critique, Raymond Birn deemed Darnton a \"superb storyteller\" and remarked of The Literary Underground that \"Darnton has clearly unearthed a human, multifaceted Enlightenment. What lies ahead is a systematic, compelling book on the cultural origins of the Revolution. Darnton surely possesses the vision to write it.\" And Hampson concluded that Darnton \"has made good use of his gold mine [of documents] and left us all greatly in his debt. Thanks to him we know a good deal more about the ecology of ancien regime society…. The French Revolution was a continuous conflict between people, as well as a battle of ideas, and anyone who wants to understand the people had better start with the work of Robert Darnton.\"\n\nDarnton examines an even more specialized literary genre in The Forbidden Bestsellers of PreRevolutionary France and its companion volume, The Corpus of Clandestine Literature in France, 1769-1789, both published in 1995. Clandestine books, ranging in subject matter from futuristic utopian novels and pornography to unauthorized biographies of wealthy and influential members of the aristocracy, influenced the common people of prerevolutionary France far more than did the high-minded Encyclopedie, according to the historian. Lumped with works by Voltaire and Rousseau into a censored classification called livres philosphiques—books that undermined the authority of Church, the King, or of commonly held moral values—were such volumes as the lascivious Memoirs about the Affair between Father Dirrag and Mademoiselle Eradice and other pornographic novels, as well as Louis-Sebastien Mercier's forward-looking The Year 2440: A Dream If Ever There Was One. Smuggled into France by various means—including a method called \"larding\" whereby pages of a non-censored book were interleaved with pages of a censored \"philosophical\" tract—these books became commonplace throughout the country despite their prohibition. Out of a list of 720 titles in circulation during this time (analyzed at great length in The Corpus of Clandestine Literature), Darnton's list of the thirty-five best-selling volumes of the period shows Mercier's book in top place, followed by a risque biography of Madame du Barry; interestingly, Voltaire's Questions about the Encyclopedie holds up surprisingly well at eleventh, even a notch or two above the translation of Cleland's Fanny Hill.\n\nThrough his continuing research at Neuchâtel, Darnton has become fascinated with the relationship between this literature, which had a heavy demand, despite the fact that it had to be smuggled into the country. Determining, as he did in The Businesss of the Enlightenment, that the Encyclopedie and other heavily politicized works circulated mainly within the socioeconomic class that the revolution ultimately sought to overthrow, the question remains, as Peter Brooks noted in the New Republic: \"Do books make revolutions? If so, how?\" Darnton \"wants to answer yes, books do make revolutions,\" added Brooks. \"But that is true, he wishes to show, only if one extends the list of books, beyond those the historians normally hold responsible for creating a fire in men's minds … [to] the true best-sellers.\" While finding Darnton's premise fascinating—particularly the historian's assertion that in eighteenth-century France the concept of \"liberty\" was closely linked to that of \"libertinism\"—Brooks expressed concern that the historian's purposes may have masked the larger fascination: that such serious philosophes as Voltaire, Rousseau, and d'Holbach were almost as widely read as \"frivolities\" in a society whose lower classes so greatly outnumbered the ancien regime. However, Frederic Tuten maintained in his appraisal of Forbidden Bestsellers in the Los Angeles Times Book Review that Darnton correctly gauges the \"living network of the culture's sentiment,\" of which such books were a part. \"What he finds in the literature,\" Tuten explained of Darnton, \"is a growing disaffection from the monarchy from the time of Louis XV, a disaffection which by 1789 led some to lose faith in the legitimacy of the monarchy itself.\" John Sturroch added in the New York Times Book Review that \"Darnton makes good on his case that 'dangerous' literature cashed in on attitudes more than it create them, and that it supported an informal confederation of the potentially subversive.\"\n\nDarnton would further contribute to the discussion of the role of books in the French Revolution in Revolution in Print: The Press in France, 1775-1800, which he edited with Daniel Roche. Designed to accompany the Bicentenary exhibit \"Revolution in Print\" that was held at the New York Public Library in 1989, the book is comprised of essays on bookmaking and distribution, the production of pamphlets and newspapers, and other aspects of the publishing trades prior to and during the French uprising. Containing numerous illustrations, the volume also includes a discussion of such issues as freedom of the press, written in a manner that is \"scholarly without being in the least arcane,\" according to Times Literary Supplement reviewer Allan Forest.\n\nIn The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History, Darnton delves even further back into historical records to examine the attitudes of people living in pre-Enlightenment France. As Darnton, quoted in the New York Times Book Review, explained, \"The human quest underlying the tales in this book\" was \"how other people were thinking two centuries ago.\" And in introducing The Great Cat Massacre Darnton elaborated on his aim, stating: \"This book investigates ways of thinking in eighteenth-century France. It attempts to show not merely what people thought but how they thought—how they construed the world, invested it with meaning, and infused it with emotion.\" He does this by investigating the accounts given of their era in police dossiers, letters, and other documents by individuals alive in the early eighteenth century, as well as the literature and folklore produced at the time.\n\nTwo of the essays in The Great Cat Massacre concern the folklore of pre-Enlightenment France. In the title essay Darnton studies printer Nicolas Contat's recollection of a mock trial and slaughter of cats that occurred while he was a printer's apprentice in Paris during the 1730s. Two of Contat's fellow apprentices, frustrated by the overwork and poor living conditions imposed by their master, gleefully turned permission given by their master to eliminate some of the stray cats who disturbed the apprentices' sleep into a license to conduct a mass round-up, mock trial, torture, and hanging of the animals. Particularly cruel was their torture and execution of the mistress's favorite cat, whom the master had specifically ordered the apprentices to exempt from their purge. According to Stanley Hoffman, reviewing The Great Cat Massacre in the New Republic, this essay on Nicolas Contat's remembrance is one of the chapters in Darnton's book that tells us \"mainly about the differences between Frenchmen then and Frenchmen now. Nobody today would find a slaughter of cats funny, unlike the printing apprentices of the rue Saint-Severin. As Darnton tells us the story, it is a gruesome case of workers' revenge against the master and his wife, a symbolic sexual violation of his wife (a cat lover), a humiliation of the boss … an expression of 'working-class militancy' within the confines of artisinat (craft) and artisanal culture: 'a popular rebellion, though it remained restricted to the level of symbolism,' insofar as human beings were concerned.\" And writer Eve Drobot, critiquing The Great Cat Massacre for Toronto's Globe and Mail, remarked: \"The point of the [cat massacre] incident, in Darnton's account, is not that dissatisfied workers revolted against their masters, but that they found the whole experience utterly hilarious. The massacre lives on in the annals of the printing shop where it was repeated endlessly in mime and ritualized in story telling. 'Yet,' Darnton writes, 'it strikes the modern reader as unfunny, if not downright repulsive.' The discrepancy in perception is precisely his territory, and one that he mines most effectively 'When you realize that you are not getting something—a joke, a proverb, a ceremony—that is particularly meaningful to the natives, you can see where to grasp a foreign system of meaning in order to unravel it.'\"\n\nIn the next essay, Darnton reinterprets traditional French fairy tales, stripping away the glosses and alterations that have accumulated during the past two hundred years to reveal the tales—as nearly as possible—as they were first told. Among the tales examined by Darnton is one known today as \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" although in its original form the heroine's hood is not red, a revelation that challenges certain modern analyses of the tale that are based on the hood's redness as a symbol for menstruation and puberty. Another difference between the version revealed by Darnton and the modern-day version of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" is that the modern tale ends happily with the heroine alive and well, while in the original the girl is eaten by the wolf. This reflects what Darnton shows to be a general tendency—that the original French fairy tales were harsher than those that have evolved out of them, and the originals stressed the need for people to be cunning and resourceful in order to survive the brutal conditions of peasant life in eighteenth-century France. As Mavis Gallant explained in New York Times Book Review, \"The bare bones of the fairy tales that reach us … are nearly all we can know about 'the mental world of the unenlightened during the Enlightenment.'\" And what they convey is \"a dark world without warmth or compassion, in which families starve and children are a burden to be deserted when they cannot be fed. Dupery and cunning, not love or justice, are to be relied upon and practiced, for they are the only props of the poor. Generations of the illiterate and the dispossessed learned—from a small core of stories that were told aloud—how to 'live mistrustfully ever after.'\"\n\nDarnton's third study in The Great Cat Massacre relates an anonymous bourgeois's description of the social order of his hometown of Montpellier, France, and is followed by what Drobot described as the \"wittiest chapter in the book.\" This latter looks at the files of an eighteenth-century police inspector charged with the responsibility of keeping records on the literary community of Paris between 1748 and 1753. His files include more than five hundred dossiers on both prestigious and hack writers. In the dossiers the inspector evaluates the style and content of the writers' works, the writers' private lives, their sources of financial support, and their physical appearance. He also provides anecdotes and gossip that circulated about the writers at the time.\n\nDarnton's next essay analyzes the editorial strategies used by Denis Diderot and his colleague Jean Le Rond d'Alembert in propagating through their Encyclopedie ideas that would come to characterize the Enlightenment. And in the final episode of The Great Cat Massacre, Darnton relates the contents of a cache of forty-seven letters and book orders sent to a Swiss publisher and printer by a French merchant with a passion for the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Darnton discovered these letters in Swiss archives and used them to show how the writings of Rousseau influenced the lives of the merchant, his family, and others.\n\nWinner of the 1984 Los Angeles Times Book Prize, The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History prompted William S. McFeely to commend Darnton in the Washington Post Book World, where he noted: \"The job description for the historian is simple; he must read well. Darnton does. He will read anything, take it seriously, and, applying a fertile imagination, write beautifully about what he has learned.\" Hoffman similarly praised Darnton's work in the New Republic: \"Robert Darnton has the inquisitiveness of a first-rate investigative reporter, the thoroughness of a rigorous scholar, and the sensitivity of a novelist. Rarely have these very different gifts been so deliciously combined.\" And of Darnton's essays in The Great Cat Massacre, Hoffman concluded: \"Each one of his stories is a gem,\" together comprising a \"most rewarding book … for those of us who like to study France, and whose enjoyment of social science is at its peak whenever the gap between it and good literature is at its narrowest.\"\n\nIn The Kiss of Lamourette: Reflections on Cultural History, Darnton steps back and views the role of historians in understanding, interpreting, and using history to educate in the present. Spreading his inquiry from France during the age of revolution to the modern day, his essays cover such things as the history of reading and history's relationship with other sciences, such as anthropology and psychology. Informed by his early work as a journalist, he meshes the media of today with the Terror of the eighteenth century, a Terror that was stilled only by brief moments of \"fraternite,\" such as that from which the book draws its title. Speaking before the revolutionary Assembly in 1782, Antoine Adrien Lamourette's suggestion that political troubles could be solved through affection was followed by what Los Angeles Times Book Review critic Scott Mahler deemed \"one of the most improbable scenes from European political history\"—assemblymen rising to their feet and hugging and kissing their fellow legislators. \"Darnton daydreams about history the way other people daydream about taking a vacation or finding true love,\" wrote Mahler, who found the volume to be the product of \"a rich intelligence.\" \"Whether exploring the high plains of scholarly debate or the fertile lowlands of popular culture, he makes an excellent guide for all.\"\n\nIn an uncharacteristic change of pace, Darnton the cultural historian turns journalist in Berlin Journal, 1989-1990, a record of an academic year spent in Germany for a German think tank. He had intended to immerse himself in the study of the eighteenth century, but, as Gordon A. Craig explained in the New York Review of Books, \"unexpectedly … found himself in the middle of something that looked like a revolution and decided to try to produce a journalistic account of events as they occurred.\" Traveling from his base in West Berlin into communist East Germany after the Berlin Wall came down in November of 1989, the historian records the details of his interactions with the people he meets on his travels: \"His reportage of changing moods, conversations, arguments, and above all, people in particular situations, is direct and vivid,\" noted Steven Lukes of Darnton's book in the Times Literary Supplement, while adding that Darnton the historian is never far behind Darnton the journalist, asking questions and \"drawing analogies and disanalogies\" with revolutionary France, and possessing \"a keen eye for the strange significance of books under communism.\" Craig praised the volume as \"an attractive and highly readable book,\" although he later added that \"one is left wondering why a 'Berlin journal' should say so little about the western half of the city.\" Berlin Journal is \"not without repetition,\" Anthony Ailey stated in New York Times Book Review, but he added that the volume \"makes us appreciate something of what it felt like for Germans East and West as [their formerly bisected] world ended.\"\n\nDarnton added to his oeuvre on the Enlightenment with the 2003 publication of his essay collection George Washington's Teeth: An Unconventional Guide to the Eighteenth Century. The subtitle seems to indicate a broader scope, though the historian mostly focuses on his favorite subject, France in the years before the revolution. However, he does spend time discussing the influences of what was happening in France upon the American colonies, as well as his usual romps through bits of cultural trivia that bring the eighteenth-century to life. As Hunt, writing in the New Republic, noted, \"Darnton has a knack for breaking open an old chestnut and finding the meat still clinging inside.\" Although Hunt became frustrated with the book because it refuses to adequately connect the Enlightenment with the French Revolution—or, on the other hand, take the position that they were not strongly connected, the critic maintained that George Washington's Teeth \"is good history, because it is so richly documented. It is also captivating history.\" Marie Marmo Mullaney, writing in Library Journal, seconded that opinion, declaring Darnton's book \"a refreshing and stimulating collection of essays by one of the preeminent historians of the eighteenth century.\"\n\nHunt, summing up the historian's contributions to the discipline, noted that \"Darnton never focused on the ideas of the Enlightenment itself. He wanted to show how those ideas diffused outward and downward, and above all he was fascinated by the low life of literature, the publishers and the smugglers of forbidden books, the pamphleteers and the pornographers who gnawed away at the beams holding up the ancien regime. Darnton has done more than anyone else to illuminate this story and to show how it matters. The Business of Enlightenment and The Forbidden Bestsellers of Pre-Revolutionary France are rightly considered classics in the field.\"\n\nDarnton once told CA: \"I write history books, so my publications express a continuing process of archival research and a commitment to a professional vocation. Still, I attempt to write the books in such a way that they could interest the general educated reader. That attempt has not succeeded as well as I would hope in the United States, but I do find it possible to reach a 'grand public' through translations in Europe.\" Regardless of the readership, Darnton has enjoyed his excursions into history, especially his delvings into the Societé Typographique de Neuchâtel's papers. Calling himself an \"archival historian,\" he revealed to Publishers Weekly writer Gary M. Kramer, \"What really excites me as a historian … is how to get inside the mental world that existed hundreds of years ago, to roam around and understand how people made sense of things.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nperiodicals\n\nAmerican Historical Review, October, 1969; October, 1980; June, 1983.\n\nAtlantic Monthly, February, 1984.\n\nBusiness History Review, winter, 1981.\n\nContemporary Review, January, 1997, Linda Kirk, review of The Forbidden Bestsellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, p. 49.\n\nDetroit News, December 13, 1984.\n\nGlobe and Mail (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), April 21, 1984.\n\nHistory Today, February, 1982.\n\nInsight on the News, July 3, 1995, Stephen Goode, review of The Forbidden Bestsellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, p. 29.\n\nJournal of Interdisciplinary History, spring, 1984.\n\nJournal of Modern History, September, 1970; June, 1981; March, 1997, Jeremy D.
