The Great Cat Massacre by Robert Darnton examines a 1730 incident where two apprentice printers in France staged a trial and execution of their employer's cats. Darnton uses this event as a lens to study cultural occurrences in early modern France. He analyzes folklore, police records, and literature to understand the mindsets of different social classes at the time. The apprentices resented the special treatment of the cats compared to their poor working conditions. Killing the cats was a form of protest and also carried symbolic significance as cats represented the power dynamic between masters and servants. The work provides insights into cultural history through this unusual historical example.",
