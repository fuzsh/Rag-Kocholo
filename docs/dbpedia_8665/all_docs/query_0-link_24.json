Also that the space and time for the LC system, the function is only a basic framework and the division of visual arts are a medium in fundamental antiquarian. Robert’s defense is Arnaldo Momigliano perspective upon early-modern antiquarian to modern historian which is most historian would write in chorological order while antiquaries write in a systematic way. The other perspective is Historian find facts to discover and explanation in multiple ways and an antiquarian examines a research relations connected to the exact subject (The Map of Art History, 32). Overall Robert’s essay was really persuasive to me and it provide enough strong evidence where it convince me to agree with the idea of having art history and disciplines also societies to represents itself through order and classification.\n\nThe Use of Signboards and Watteau's Painting, Enseigne de Gersaint\n\n2499 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn the Enseigne, art is also shown to serve a function that it has always fulfilled in every society founded on class differences. As a luxury commodity it is an index of social status. It marks the distinction between those who have the leisure and wealth to know about art and posses it, and those who do not. In Gersaint’s signboard, art is presented in a context where its social function is openly and self-consciously declared. In summary, Watteau reveals art to be a product of society, nevertheless he refashions past artistic traditions. Other than other contemporary painters however, his relationship to the past is not presented as a revolt, but rather like the appreciative, attentive commentary of a conversational partner.\n\nRepresentations of Madness in \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" and \"The Black Cat\"\n\n632 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman is the story of a woman spiralling into madness whilst her physician husband refuses to acknowledge that she has a \"real\" problem. On the other hand The Black Cat by Edgar Alan Poe is about a man who is initially fond of cats however as the plot progresses he becomes an alcoholic making him moody and violent, which lead him to torture and kills the animals and eventually also his wife. In Edgar Allan Poe’s \"The Black Cat,\" symbolism is used to show the narrator’s capacity for violence, madness, and guilt .The recurring theme present in both these stories is that the main protagonists claim that they suffer or have been taken over by a form of madness. In this essay I shall examine the various symbolism used by the writer's to represent madness.\n\nViolence in the Suburbs of Paris\n\n2074 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThe amount of violence prevalent in the suburbs of Paris is never glossed over in “La Haine” and Tea in the Harem.

Robert Darnton looks at the writings of the peasant’s, and traces them to their origins and compares them to other texts of similar origins and texts, to create credible accounts or views of particular topics of the people during the era. In this review you’re going to see a summary of the book, describing the various subjects of this book. After that I will comment on Mr. Darnton’s on some topics like his organization, writing style, and fairness to his subject material, then discuss the historical importance of the topics that Robert Darnton mentions in his book and give you my personal opinion of the book itself. Next I will discuss with you a battery of topics like why I chose the book, is the book controversial, what was the authors purpose for writing the book, what were some of the major themes, who or what Darnton’s sources were?\n\nMeursault Justifies Murder\n\n1096 Words | 3 Pages\n\nWhile coming to terms with the absurd was a gradual process for Meursault, his final days and his heated conversation with the chaplain, and his desire for a hateful crowd of spectators show that he was able to accept the absurdity, and revel in it, finding satisfaction in spite of those around him and justifying his murder. His ego had reached an all-time high as he neared his execution, and his satisfaction left him prepared for the nothingness awaiting him. This process was a natural psychological response to his mortality, for his peace of mind. Therefore, Meursault is not the Stranger, an alien to society, but a troubled man seeking meaning and satisfaction in a life and a world that was overwhelming unsatisfactory and absurd.\n\nThe Village Of Cannibals Analysis\n\n1227 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIt is no surprise then that with such heavy issues weighing on the minds of the peasantry, that there was such a surge of violence with the murder of Monéy. When the town of Hautefaye began to celebrate the commemoration of the First Empire on August 15th, drinking became the main activity causing the celebration to become a likely place for violence. Corbin suggests that what makes the murder of Monéy distinguishable from other acts of violence, was that the event was past the French period where such violence was common, as well as it was unusual for the crime to take place at the time of day that it did. Ultimately, given the amount of heavy issues weighing on the minds of the peasantry at a time when France was in such turmoil, it’s logical that a surge of violence occurred within the town of Hautefaye.\n\nOn the Cannibals by Michel de Montaigne\n\n1683 Words | 4 Pages\n\n...er” becomes the Barbarians. If the strangers were the Cannibals, then the status quo of the French society is preserved and the cannibalistic behaviors of the foreigners become unconventional. This is assuming the belief that the Europeans are the norm. By identifying the “self” and the “other”, he first sets the differences between the two and then blurs them to state that the universal human posses characteristics of both societies and that one is not necessarily more civilized than the other. As the essay progresses, the coming together of the Barbarian and the European suggests that the Cannibals are closer to the operations of Nature but will eventually progress toward the same society structure as the one present in Europe. He therefore addresses the universal human by examining both societies but not offering an absolute standard for which is more barbaric.\n\nColonialism In The Stranger By Albert Camus\n\n1262 Words | 3 Pages\n\nMeursault’s apathy towards his mother’s death, his girlfriend, Marie Cardona, and the Arabic man symbolize a cruel French colonist. The first sentence of “ The stranger”, “Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can’t be sure”(4), appalls reader by showing Meursault’s unconcern about his mother’s death date. At the funeral, Meursault behaves indifferently which contrasts with the old Perez, “who put on and put off his hat again and again”(11). Conversation between Meursault and his girlfriend also shows Meursault aloofness. “Marie came that evening and asked me if I’d marry her. I said I didn’t mind; if she was keen on it, we’d get married. Then she asked me again if I loved her. I replied, much as before, that her question meant nothing or next to nothing- bu...\n\nLynn Hunt On Human Rights\n\n1973 Words | 4 Pages\n\nAnother aspect of her novel that took on the context of empathy but in an entirely different way. This persuasive discussion of Hunt introduces the topic of torture and the speedy reduction it faced in terms of the techniques and frequency throughout Europe as form of empathy, which is needed for the context of human rights. Hunt is able to argue that torture devices known as “the wheel” and “the iron collar” were able to be slowly pushed out of the French judicial system because of the changing cultural attitudes. It is necessary to state that prior to the changing minds, the view of torture was that “the pains of the body did not belong entirely to the individual condemned person… bodies could be mutilated in the interest of inscribing authority, and broken or burned in the interest of restoring the moral, political, and religious order” (Hunt, 94). People were subjected to torture instantaneously without ability to reason or justify, and many of the times faced death without even being able to plea for their innocence."
