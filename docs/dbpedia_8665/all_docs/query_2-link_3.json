        "text": "Sadistic violence against innocent cats? A symbolic gesture of class resistance? The funniest thing that ever happened in 1730s Paris – or even all three? In this article our Deputy Editor Sarah Jones looks at Richard Darnton’s seminal essay on The Great Cat Massacre to think about what it can tell us about understanding the past through an interpretation of the social, political and cultural landscapes that they took place in.\n\nHogarth, The First Stage of Cruelty (1751)\n\nKilling Cats in eighteenth-century Paris\n\nIn the late 1730s, on the rue Saint-Séverin in Paris, a printmaster’s apprentices killed a host of cats in a pseudo-trial of the poor animals. Not only that, but the episode was repeated time and time again by the apprentices and their neighbours, as it was considered to be the funniest thing that had ever happened in Paris. You are probably asking yourself, ‘how are this possible’ or ‘how could this ever be considered funny.’ For the historians amongst you, you might also be thinking ‘how could this happen in the Age of Enlightenment, when reason and logic were considered to be central to humanity’s ascendancy.’ Of course these questions are perfectly valid, but only in the sense that their context is as equally historically and culturally contingent as are the hilarity that the original situation was deemed to have provoked. Very little is innate to human spirit or nature; and it seems that comedy and violence negotiate the difficult line between what it is entertainment and what is sadistic humour.\n\nNicolas Contat wrote about the event in his 1762 account of his apprenticeship with Jacques Vincent, a printer on the rue Saint-Séverin in the Latin Quarter of Paris. In the account there are two main apprentice-actors, Jérôme and Léveillé; the former is probably a fictionalised version of Contat. Apprentices in the eighteenth-century were badly treated: Contat testifies that they were left only the scraps from their masters’ plates to eat, which the chef took for himself, leaving the apprentices only rotten meats that even the cats turned their noses up at. Tough conditions for any worker. These were worsened by the injustices that the apprentices perceived were further done to them. Cats had become the pet du jour for the petty bourgeois in Paris. Vincent’s family was no exception; his wife adored the creatures and la grise was her favourite. One night Léveillé scaled the walls of the printers to the roof, where he howled and screeched and meowed all night to disturb his masters’ sleep. In the morning the apprentices were instructed to dispose of the cats, leaving none except for la grise.\n\nThe next day, Léveillé smashed the spine of la grise with an iron bar: Jérôme did the honours of ending its miserable life and then hid the body in a gutter. They chased, captured and bludgeoned the remaining cohort of cats, before dumping them in the courtyard. The workers then gathered round the heap, staging a mock trial in which they found the cats coupables of the charges held against them (stealing their food), administered the last rites, and hanged them on a set of improvised gallows. Once she arrived on the scene, Vincent’s wife was horrified that one could be la grise, but the workers assured her it wasn’t. Vincent himself was outraged at the stoppage of work, but overall, from Contant’s account, it looks like the workers had got away with it. Not only did they get away with it, but the workers recreated the event at least twenty times, making the scene into a copie, a pamphlet that was circulated as entertainment amongst working class men. The aim of a copie was to prendre la chèvre (get the goat of, take the piss out of) of the boss of the workshop whilst the workers rolled around with laughter.\n\nComedy and Time\n\nRobert Darnton in The Great Cat Massacre is surely right to suggest that our inability to laugh at this once magnificent joke, and indeed our disgust at it, demonstrates how we are separated from our ancestors through the gulf of history. Darnton’s study of the case espoused the idea of an ethnographical or anthropological approach to history: that historical documents, rather than being transparent testimonies of the past, are complex webs that reveal the power relationships that produced them. As such historians must, according to Darnton, reconstruct all of what texts actually say through a lot of what they don’t say. This is most clear in Darnton’s acknowledgement of the apprentices’ understanding of the injustices done to them as well as of the conscious selection of cats as the ultra-symbol through which they could rebel. This is based on two principles. Firstly, although we cannot be sure that Cantot’s text is not fictional, the text nevertheless demonstrates how symbols could be manipulated as an expression of power (even if the event did not actually happen, the fact that Cantot recounts the story is in itself an expression of resistance to the masters’ power). Secondly, Darnton relies on the belief in a ‘universal’ symbol. This has been challenged by Roger Chartier in ‘Text, Symbols, and Frenchness’ who argues that French society was so fractured by class and métier, and lacked the modern-day unification granted by the mass media, that it would have been impossible for one symbol to have stood for all the workers’ grievances. My response to Chartier would be that the massacre of the cats was not intended as a universal symbol; the charade had a very select primary audience (the workers) as well as a secondary audience (the boss). Therefore the episode does offer a significant insight into the lives and thoughts of Parisians at that time.\n\nA more sustainable criticism of Darnton is perhaps that violence-against-cats is part of a wider phenomenon of cruelty directed towards animals. Think of cock-fighting or bear-baiting; fox-hunting is considered as form of sport by many, despite the Hunting Act in 2004. William Hogarth’s The First Stage of Cruelty in The Four Stages of Cruelty (1751) depicts a young man’s decline into violence, which is begun by the act of abusing a dog. In the same plate Hogarth depicts cock-fighting as well as the hanging of two cats. By The Second Stage of Cruelty the protagonist has moved on to beating a horse; in The Third Stage of Cruelty he has descended to robbery and murder, in the final plate he has ended up on the surgeon’s dissecting table. It is not that killing cats is inherently funny, or that human societies are inherently cruel to animals, but that what can be defined as funny is constantly in flux as it always depends on variable tastes and morals. In the same category we might include the minstrel show, and maybe one day we will be judged for our persistent use of dwarves in pantomime. Hogarth’s prints also demonstrate that, even if a practice is commonly found as funny and socially acceptable, there may also be resistance to it as the plates were generally intended as cautionary tales. The un-funniness of the Great Cat Massacre does more than show how comedy can fail to traverse across time; it also reveals how everything of what we value is subject to change.\n\nHogarth, The Second Stage of Cruelty (1751)\n\nIf you’re interested in writing about French or Francophone history, please get in touch with our French Content Editor, Sarah, at glossa.french@gmail.com\n\nPhoto credit: wikimedia.org"
