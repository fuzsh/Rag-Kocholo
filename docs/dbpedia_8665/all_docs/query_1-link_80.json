        "text": "Do books have a future? We're used to being told that a digital age will make them redundant, yet they don't seem to be fading away. The number of new titles published each year will soon reach a million. In this motley collection of essays on the history and future of the book, Robert Darnton points out that they have many practical advantages. Portable and accessible, they require no power supply. They have proved their durability, while today's advanced tools for storing data will be tomorrow's dinosaurs. A new technology does not always replace an older one. The internet has not yet obliterated newspapers. The printed page is not about to disappear.\n\nYou may well be reading this review online, rather than on paper. Communication has been transformed by electronic media and the pace of change is accelerating. Darnton is happy to concede the point – \"Whatever the future may be, it will be digital\". In some respects, he is enthusiastic about the modern information landscape. He is a historian of the 18th century and shares the Enlightenment's faith in \"the power of knowledge\". A digital revolution could make learning available to all.\n\nDarnton has long been a champion of the publication of research and scholarly resources on the web. As the director of Harvard's magnificent library, he has encouraged the development of new methods of collaboration that will eventually lead to an immense, international electronic collection of books. It will benefit all who want to use it, for whatever reason.\n\nDarnton, then, is no Luddite. But his book is riddled with uncertainties and anxieties about what this transformation might imply. Google's bid to digitise great research libraries is an example of the developments that excite and alarm him. He worries about Google's \"monopolistic tendencies\" and the risk that greed for private gain will block any aspiration to public good. How are the interests of authors and publishers to be protected? Should Google be seen as a publisher? How might research libraries fit into the operations of Google Book Search? Will we lose irreplaceable details in the rush to transform volumes into bytes?\n\nHe identifies more questions than he is able to answer. But he is eloquent on the dangers of digitisation – for instance, that the dizzying expense of subscribing to electronic versions of leading science journals (often more than $20,000 a year) has had such an effect on accession budgets that university libraries now find it hard to buy books in other fields.\n\nThe challenges are huge and demand a coherent response. Darnton's thoughts are provocative, but his assemblage of essays, reviews and scholarly articles, many previously published in the New York Review of Books, doesn't quite measure up to the task. Some of the material is very recent, some was first published in the 1980s. As Darnton confesses, these pieces were \"fired off, scattershot\". The same concerns emerge over and over, with an insistence that comes to seem obsessive. In the final part of the book, essays on subjects such as the history of the commonplace book or the complex origins of Shakespearean bibliography unexpectedly appear. They are intriguing and accomplished, but the investigation of such matters is unlikely to interest readers eager to learn about the pressing consequences of Google's imperialism or the changing prospects for e-texts. Darnton is not clear about who should read this book and why. The result is a muddle.\n\nNo doubt the confusion is partly a product of pressure. Busy academics are inclined to construct new work from an amalgam of older publications and the process of assimilation is often incomplete. Darnton's disarray is exasperating, but it is also fruitful, reflecting, as it does, the tangled contradictions clinging to the questions that he addresses. His historical analysis confirms that the difficulties are longstanding. Information is never stable and a period of thoughtful digestion is needed before it can become knowledge, or even wisdom.\n\nIn his final essay, Darnton remarks that \"reading remains mysterious\", despite the burgeoning debates surrounding the production, preservation and interpretation of texts. The practice of reading shifts in every generation. No commercial or political process has yet succeeded in controlling its evolution and nothing suggests that its unruly energies are likely to diminish in a digital world.\n\nDinah Birch is professor of English literature at Liverpool University and editor of the latest edition of The Oxford Companion to English Literature"
