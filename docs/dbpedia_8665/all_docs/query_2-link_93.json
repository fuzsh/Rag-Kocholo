Originally an introduction to the history of mentalités, the course developed into a seminar on history and anthropology, thanks to the influence of Clifford Geertz, who has taught the course with me for the last six years and in doing so\n\nhas taught me most of what I know about anthropology. I should like to express my gratitude to him and to our students. I also owe\n\na great deal to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where I began writing this book as a member of a program on self-\n\nperception and historical change financed by the Andrew W. Mel- | lon Foundation. And finally, I would like to thank the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation whose award of a prize fel-\n\nlowship made it possible for me to suspend my normal work in |\n\nenterprise. |\n\norder to follow up and finish what must have appeared to be a risky\n\nxi\n\nBLANK PAGE\n\nPREFACE TO THE : REVISED EDITION\n\nOF THE GREAT | CAT MASSACRE\n\nTHIS NEW EDITION of my book gives me an opportunity to address\n\nnew readers, and I am happy to take advantage of it. Publishing a book is similar to throwing a stone down a deep well: you wait and wait, expecting to hear a splash, but sometimes you hear nothing. Of all the books I have written, The Great Cat Massacre made the greatest splash—perhaps, as some have said, because it has a catchy title. When the title caught their eye, readers apparently were intrigued. Why, they asked, should a serious historian occupy himself with such a bizarre event as the ritual slaughter of cats in an obscure neighborhood of eighteenth-century Paris? I hope that question will draw readers into the text and, more importantly, into a new kind of history. In the 1960s, when everything new seemed to originate on the Left Bank of Paris, this history was heralded as histoire des XV\n\nPreface to the Revised Edition\n\nmentalités—the history of mentalities, or the study of the mental universe of ordinary people. Before then, historians had concentrated on the intellectual life of the elite, but they could not deny that peasants and workers had ideas, too. If some way could be\n\nfound to penetrate into the worldview of the masses and study the values and attitudes of people in the bottom ranks of society, a whole new dimension of history would open up. But the problems posed by this kind of research seemed to be insurmountable. Most Europeans were illiterate before the nineteenth century. How could a historian find traces of mental activity by people who had left no written record of it? The first attempts to find a solution to this problem produced some inferences but little in the way of rigorous argument. Historians studied chapbooks that were read aloud to peasants. They compiled statistics from wills, which suggested how the poor imagined the afterlife. They investigated exotic subjects like witchcraft, magic, banditry, and folk medicine. But they did not make systematic advances into this field of study until they began borrowing concepts\n\nand methods from a neighboring discipline, anthropology. | Anthropologists had made the worldviews and value systems of illiterate people a principal subject of their research since the beginning of the twentieth century. To be sure, they divided into\n\n| rival camps and disagreed among themselves just as heartily as historians do, so their concepts could not be imported wholesale into history. But by the 1990s historians were making such effective use of so many varieties of anthropology that even the\n\nFrench abandoned their trademark notion of the history of mentalities and took up anthropological history.\n\nThe Great Cat Massacre, first published in 1984, is an early attempt to write history in this vein. I intended it for the general reading public as well as for scholars, so I did not include much in the way of theoretical discourse. I wanted to show how anthropological history could work by writing it instead of writ-\n\ning a treatise on how it should be written. I also adopted a : particular strategy in my mode of exposition. I began with the general stock of folk tales, which existed everywhere and reached everyone, among the elite as well as the peasants, through the many dialects that proliferated in eighteenth-\n\nxv |\n\nPreface to the Revised Edition\n\ncentury France. By systematically studying and comparing the,\n\nversions recorded by folklorists in the nineteenth century, I thought it possible to characterize an oral tradition that expressed a general orientation to the world—not a national spirit, : as some of my critics have claimed, but a pattern of culture that existed on a national scale, despite regional variations. Having established this pattern as a general background, I went on in\n\nthe succeeding chapters to produce a series of case studies, : which covered different social groups and led ultimately to the intellectual elite among writers and readers. By proceeding in this manner, I attempted to write cultural history “from below,”\n\njust as earlier historians had treated social and economic history—that is, | began in the world of peasants and artisans and worked up into the world of the Enlightenment. But I did not try to integrate everything into a single, seamless account of eighteenth-century French culture because I do not believe that any such thing existed. Like many modern or postmodern writers, I did not worry about presenting my work in a fragmented and nonholistic way. But I did fret over the need to be rigorous—to deploy evidence in a manner that supports a compelling interpretation. I stress interpretation because I understand history, like all the\n\nhuman sciences, to be interpretive by its very nature. It makes sense of how other people made sense of the human condition. To study a cultural episode like the massacre of cats is similar to _ going to a play: you read the actions of the actors in order to understand what they are expressing. You don’t reach a conclusion comparable to the bottom line of a bank account or the verdict of a judge, because interpretive history is necessarily open-ended,\n\ncapacious enough to admit many nuances. But open-endedness does not mean that anything goes or that an interpretation cannot be wrong. To interpret Hamlet as a slapstick comedy is to get\n\nit wrong, even though other interpretations can be both valid and divergent—those, for example, that construe Hamlet as a play\n\nabout psychological forces as opposed to those that see it as a drama about power in the body politic. I have borrowed these ideas from Clifford Geertz, a master anthropologist with whom I taught a seminar on history and XVI\n\nPreface to the Revised Edition\n\nanthropology for twenty years. But they also fit the views of Victor Turner, Mary Douglas, E. E. Evans-Pritchard, and younger\n\nscholars such as Keith Basso and James Clifford. For all their differences, these anthropologists stress the multivocal character _ of symbols, and they understand rituals as complex patterns of behavior, which express multiple meanings. I stress the complexity and multiplicity inherent in symbolic expression because some of my critics have failed to take account\n\nof that fundamental point. Roger Chartier, for example, argues that symbols link signifier to signified in an unambiguous, linear manner, as in an example he took from an eighteenth-century dictionary: the lion is the symbol of valor. I would agree that the figure of a lion can suggest valor, but it can also convey strength, ferocity, royalty, and other qualities, including various combinations of them, all at the same time. Anthropologists have demonstrated again and again that ordinary people manipulate symbols in this manner. So there is nothing extravagant about the notion that cats symbolized witchcraft, sexuality, and domesticity—or that the ritual murder of them was meant simultaneously as a trial, a gang rape, a rebellion of the workers against their boss, and a carnivalesque kind of street theater, which the workers later\n\nrepeated in the form of pantomime. Not all of the men who staged the massacre understood it in the same fashion. It had a wide range of meanings that could be construed and combined in several ways. To reduce them to one conclusion, as in the ending of a whodunit mystery story, is to misunderstand the way humans make meaning in general and how workers were able to twit their bosses in the eighteenth century.\n\nPut so abstractly, the issue may sound like what we call an academic question—one of those debates that interest academics but have little to say to ordinary persons in the workaday world.\n\nBut I believe that the cat massacre and the attempt to decipher its meanings can interest everyone outside of academia who is curious about the human condition and the way human beings construe it. One way is through joking. Although it seems strange to us—and downright repugnant to the cat lovers among us—the\n\ncat massacre was the funniest thing that ever happened to the workers in the rue Saint-Séverin. If we can get the joke, we XVII\n\nPreface to the Revised Edition\n\nshould be able to shed some of our modern worldviews and enter into the alien mental world of ordinary persons who lived two centuries before us. That kind of contact is an experience that makes this kind of history rewarding. If my readers enjoy this experiment in anthropological history, I hope they will pur-\n\nsue it further, for history and anthropology have continued to reinforce each other, and now, a quarter of a century after The Great Cat Massacre first appeared, they have combined to create a fertile field of study that looks more promising than ever.\n\n: , XIX\n\nBLANK PAGE\n\nThe Great Cat Massacre And Other Episodes in French Cultural History\n\nBLANK PAGE\n\n— INTRODUCTION\n\nTHIS BOOK investigates ways of thinking in eighteenth-century France. It attempts to show not merely what people thought but\n\nhow they. thought—how they construed the world, invested it , with meaning, and infused it with emotion. Instead of following the high road of intellectual history, the inquiry leads into the unmapped territory known in France as [’histoire des mentalités. This\n\ngenre has not yet received a name in English, but it might simply be called cultural history; for it treats our own civilization in the same way that anthropologists study alien cultures. It is history in the ethnographic grain. Most people tend to think that cultural history concerns high culture, culture with a capital c, The history of culture in the lower case goes back as far as Burckhardt, if not Herodotus; but it is still unfamiliar and full of surprises. So the reader may want a word of explanation. Where the historian of ideas traces the filiation of formal thought from philosopher to philosopher, the ethnographic historian studies the way ordinary people made sense of the world. He attempts to uncover their cosmology, to show how they organized reality in their minds and expressed it in their behavior. He does not try to make a philosopher out of the man in the street but 3\n\n| THE GREAT CAT MASSACRE to see how street life called for a strategy. Operating at ground level, ordinary people learn to be “‘street smart””—and they can be as intelligent in their fashion as philosophers. But instead of deriving logical propositions, they think with things, or with anything\n\nelse that their culture makes available to them, such as stories or ceremonies.\n\nWhat things are good to think with? Claude Lévi-Strauss applied that question to the totems and tatoos of Amazonia twentyfive years ago. Why not try it out on eighteenth-century France? Because eighteenth-century Frenchmen cannot be interviewed, the\n\nskeptic will reply; and to drive the point home, he will add that archives can never serve as a substitute for field work. True, but the archives from the Old Regime are exceptionally rich, and one can always put new questions to old material. Furthermore, one should\n\nnot imagine that the anthropologist has an easy time with his native informant. He, too, runs into areas of opacity and silence, and he must interpret the native’s interpretation of what the other natives think. Mental undergrowth can be as impenetrable in the bush as in the library. But one thing seems clear to everyone who returns from field work: other people are other. They do not think the way we do. And if we want to understand their way of thinking, we should set out with the idea of capturing otherness. Translated into the terms of the historian’s craft, that may merely sound like the familiar injunction against anachronism. It is worth repeating, nonetheless, ’ for nothing is easier than to slip into the comfortable assumption that Europeans thought and felt two centuries ago just as we do today—allowing for the wigs and wooden shoes. We constantly need to be shaken out of a false sense of familiarity with the past, to be administered doses of culture shock. There is no better way, I believe, than to wander through the archives. One can hardly read a letter from the Old Regime with-\n\nout coming up against surprises—anything from the constant dread of toothaches, which existed everywhere, to the obsession\n\n4;\n\nwith braiding dung for display on manure heaps, which remained confined to certain villages. What was proverbial wisdom to our ancestors is completely opaque to us. Open any eighteenth-century __ book of proverbs, and you will find entries such as: ‘‘He who is ©\n\nIntroduction\n\nsnotty, let him blow his nose.”” When we cannot get a proverb, or a joke, or a ritual, or a poem, we know we are on to something. By picking at the document where it is most opaque, we may be able to unravel an alien system of meaning. The thread might even lead into a strange and wonderful world view.\n\nThis book attempts to explore such unfamiliar views of the world. It proceeds by following up the surprises provided by an unlikely assortment of texts: a primitive version of “Little Red Riding Hood,” an account of a massacre of cats, a bizarre description of a city, a curious file kept by a police inspector—documents that cannot be taken to typify eighteenth-century thought but that provide ways of entering into it..The discussion begins with the most vague and general expressions of world view and becomes increasingly precise. Chapter 1 provides an exegesis of the folklore that was familiar to nearly everyone in France but was especially pertinent to the peasantry. Chapter 2 interprets the lore of a group of urban artisans. Moving up the social scale, chapter 3 shows what urban life meant to a provincial bourgeois. The scene then shifts to Paris and the world of the intellectuals—first as it was seen by the police, who had their own way of framing reality (chapter 4), then\n\nas it was sorted out epistemologically in the key text of the Enlightenment, the Discours préliminaire of the Encyclopédie (chapter\n\n5). The last chapter then shows how Rousseau’s break with the Encyclopedists opened up a new way of thinking and feeling, one that can be appreciated by rereading Rousseau from the perspective of his readers. The notion of reading runs through all the chapters, for one can read a ritual or a city just as one can read a folktale or a philosophic text. The mode of exegesis may vary, but in each case one reads for meaning—the meaning inscribed by contemporaries in whatever survives of their vision of the world. I have therefore tried to read my way through the eighteenth century, and I have appended texts\n\nto my interpretations so that my own reader can interpret these texts and disagree with me. I do not expect to have the last word and do not pretend to completeness. This book does not provide an\n\ninventory of ideas and attitudes in all the social groups and geographical regions of the Old Regime. Nor does it offer typical case studies, for I do not believe there is such a thing as a typical peasant 5\n\n: THE GREAT CAT MASSACRE or a representative bourgeois. Instead of chasing after them, I have pursued what seemed to be the richest run of documents, following leads wherever they went and quickening my pace as soon as I stumbled on a surprise. Straying from the beaten path may not be much of a methodology, but it creates the possibility of enjoying some unusual views, and they can be the most revealing. I do not\n\nsee why cultural history should avoid the eccentric or embrace the. | average, for one cannot calculate the mean of meanings or reduce symbols to their lowest common denominator. This confession of nonsystematism does not imply that anything . goes in cultural history because anything can pass as anthropology. The anthropological mode of history has a rigor of its own, even if it may look suspiciously like literature to a hard-boiled social scien-\n\ntist. It begins from the premise that individual expression takes place within a general idiom, that we learn to classify sensations and make sense of things by thinking within a framework provided by our culture. It therefore should be possible for the historian to\n\ndiscover the social dimension of thought and to tease meaning from documents by relating them to the surrounding world of significance, passing from text to context and back again until he has cleared a way through a foreign mental world. This kind of cultural history belongs to the interpretive sciences. It may seem too literary to be classified under the appellation contr6lée of “science” in the English-speaking world, but it fits in nicely with the sciences humaines in France. It is not an easy genre, and it-is\n\nbound to be imperfect, but it should not be impossible, even in English. All of us, French and “Anglo-Saxons,” pedants as well as peasants, operate within cultural constraints, just as we all share\n\nconventions of speech. So historians should be able to see how cultures shape ways: of thinking, even for the greatest thinkers. A poet or philosopher may push a language to its limits, but at some\n\npoint he will hit against the outer frame of meaning. Beyond it, madness lies—the fate of Holderlin and Nietzsche. But within it, great men can test and shift the boundaries of meaning. Thus there should be room for Diderot and Rousseau in a book about mentalités\n\nin eighteenth-century France. By including them along with the peasant tellers of tales and the plebeian killers of cats, I have abandoned the usual distinction between elite and popular culture, and 6\n\nIntroduction\n\nhave tried to show how intellectuals and common people coped _ with the same sort of problems. I realize there are risks in departing from the established modes of history. Some will object that the evidence is too vague for one ever to penetrate into the minds of peasants who disappeared two ‘centuries ago. Others will take offense at the idea of interpreting a massacre of cats in the same vein as the Discours préliminaire of the\n\nEncyclopédie, or interpreting it at all. And still more readers will recoil at the arbitrariness of selecting a few strange documents as points of entry into eighteenth-century thought rather than proceeding in a systematic manner through the canon of classic texts. I _ think there are valid replies to those objections, but I do not want\n\n- to turn this introduction into a discourse on method. Instead, I would like to invite the reader into my own text.
