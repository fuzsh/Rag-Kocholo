His work has long been indispensable for all those who ponder the role of the book in that history. By the mid 1990s, however, it was apparent that Darnton’s far-reaching conclusions on the relationship of the Enlightenment to the Revolution merited a comprehensive debate on his œuvre. The essays collected in this volume initiate that debate. Written by established Enlightenment scholars, they present a spectrum of opinions on Darnton’s work – opinions that Darnton responds to in a vigorous closing essay that includes insights and information not previously published.\n\nContributors: Bell, David A.; Eisenstein, Elizabeth L.; Gordon, Daniel; Hesse, Carla; Kaiser, Thomas E.; McKenzie, D.

It is more like a half-time commentary on the impact on his chosen field of an original mind and a distinguished stylist. Published in a superb but expensive series, it might not have reached the audience it deserves. But the Voltaire Foundation has recently begun to bring out some of its less specialist titles simultaneously in cheaper paperback editions. It is in every way fitting that this should be one of the first.\n\nThe cookie settings on this website are set to \"allow cookies\" to give you the best browsing experience possible.
