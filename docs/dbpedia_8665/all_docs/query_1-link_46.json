        "text": "THE REVOLUTIONARY TEMPER: Paris, 1748-1789, by Robert Darnton\n\nThis year, for the better part of winter, spring and summer, people in France engaged in a proud national tradition: mass demonstration. Protesters demanded a reversal of a government measure to raise the country’s retirement age from 62 to 64. At issue was not only a policy but a perception. President Emmanuel Macron had ignored the wishes of his electorate. Leaflets and placards showed Macron’s face superimposed onto a portrait of Louis XVI, the king overthrown by French revolutionaries in September 1792 and beheaded four months later. “Louis XVI, Louis XVI, on t’a décapité,” one ubiquitous chant warned; “Macron, Macron, on peut recommencer.” Translation: Louis XVI, Louis XVI, we decapitated you; Macron, Macron, we can get you, too.\n\nThe protest culture that arose in France in the turbulent final decades of the ancien régime has never left the minds of the Parisian citizenry, nor, one imagines, the mind of the Harvard historian and librarian emeritus Robert Darnton, who has newly chronicled it in “The Revolutionary Temper: Paris, 1748-1789.” In this illuminating study, he presents the outbreak of the revolution in Paris in 1789 as the culmination of 40 years’ worth of political scandals and cultural polemics, which — fueled by a barrage of real and fake news from a diverse range of sources — fostered in the public “a revolutionary temper that was ready to destroy one world and construct another.”\n\nBy “temper,” Darnton means “a frame of mind fixed by experience in a manner that is analogous to the ‘tempering’ of steel by a process of heating and cooling.” It is “another name,” he writes, for the “collective consciousness” in pre-revolutionary Paris, a putative groupthink or “general sentiment” that was galvanized, and ultimately radicalized, by the media that flourished in that city as the absolutist Bourbon monarchy slid ever closer to its doom.\n\nThe author of many important scholarly works on 18th-century French print culture, Darnton examines this development with not only erudition but writerly flair. He organizes his material into brief, chronologically ordered chapters with snappy titles like “A Prince Is Mugged by Order of the King,” “Saints Are Sent to Hell” and “Beaumarchais Has the Last Laugh.” Each chapter tracks the eruption of an “information war” that spread — through pamphlets, engravings, gazettes, letters, chants, poems and coffee shop chatter — with far-reaching results.\n\nDarnton’s book focuses on ordinary Parisians and eschews “ministerial intrigues that took place beyond their range of vision,” unless such intrigues spread as rumors among the broader public. The French police were focused on these rumors too. Three centuries ago, Paris was a place where the authorities ordered cafe owners to forbid certain topics on their premises. And to no avail. The “bons mots,” Darnton notes, “could not be contained.”\n\nContemporary readers may already be familiar with some of the episodes that made the rounds in 18th-century France, whether it’s the Calas Affair of the 1760s, in which Voltaire stirred anticlerical outrage in his efforts to prove the innocence of Jean Calas, a Protestant merchant who was tortured and executed by a religiously intolerant Catholic state on the charge of murdering his own son, a Catholic convert; or the slightly less complicated Diamond Necklace Affair of the 1780s, a sensational case of identity theft that both targeted Marie Antoinette and tarnished her reputation.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
