        "text": "This time, the crime occurred in the small town of Montreuil-Juigné near Angers in western France’s Loire Valley, where more than 40 cats disappeared over the holidays as the shocked inhabitants suspected a serial “tueur de chats” — cat killer — in their midst.\n\nFor weeks in this town of 7,000 residents, police fielded several reports of the disappearance of feline pets — some of which were then found dead either by poisoning or brutal beating.\n\nForbesThe Funniest Pets In Photos, Finalists Of Comedy Pet Photography Awards\n\n“When the number of missing cats rose, the local gendarmerie launched an investigation and animal shelters issued alerts, warning cat owners to keep their pets indoors,” reports The Telegraph.\n\nEarly this month, a man in his twenties was identified and arrested thanks to a video surveillance camera installed in the wall of a house that, on December 22, filmed him in the act, bringing an end to the month-long crime spree.\n\nForbesBest Ever Funny Wild Animals In Photos By Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards\n\n“My neighbor’s pet had disappeared a few days before Christmas,” the video-camera-endowed pet owner told Paris Match. “He was found dead in a trash can. Then, we see the man arriving around 2:30 a.m. with a flashlight. He calls our cat and as soon as she is at his feet we see him pick her up and put her in a bag. Our cat was found at this man’s house. She had been beaten to death with a board.”\n\nThe suspect, who lives in the town, confessed to killing some 20 cats in Montreuil-Juigné. He now faces five years in prison and a fine of €75,000.\n\nAccording to local newspaper Sud Ouest, “he had been rampant in the (area) for several months” as mysterious disappearances of cats kept happening in the region.\n\nThe investigation is still underway.\n\nThe Great Cat Massacre\n\nThe case of Montreuil-Juigné’s cat killer is far from isolated. Similar cases have been reported across France and, in fact, in other European countries, with some infamous “serial cat killers” becoming symbols of other French social issues and inspiring art works.\n\nForbesBest Wildlife Photography Of The Year: 25 Photos To Vote For Your Favorite\n\nThe Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History, for example, is a well-known book of essays by American historian Robert Darnton first published in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe book's title comes from its most famous chapter detailing the \"massacre\" of cats by two apprentice printers living and working in appalling conditions while numerous cats, intended to prevent mice from eating paper supplies, were well treated and fed on Rue Saint-Séverin in Paris in the late 1730s.\n\nFor some historians, that episode of cat slaughter serves as an early example of a workers’ protest over the condition of their labor and can be seen as a precursor to the French Revolution.\n\nCat killers in the villages\n\nFrom mass poisonings at a southwestern seaside resort in 2017 to the conviction of a man in 2020 for the theft, torture and murder of cats, the issue is a persistent problem, not only in France but elsewhere in Europe.\n\nAround the same time of the cat killings in the Loire, on December 31 in Spain — a country suffering in many regions from feral cats — an uproar ensued after the discovery of the bodies of more than 50 street cats apparently poisoned at the local dump where the colony was based in La Carlota, a village just outside the southern city of Cordoba.\n\nIn what has been called “envenenamientos recurrentes” — recurrent poisonings — in social media in Andalucía, half the population of 500 cats registered in La Carlota and surroundings have already “disappeared,” according to ABC de Cordoba.\n\nMeanwhile, in early December a female resident of Arleux, a small town in northern France, found eight cats poisoned to death in her garden, according to La Voix du Nord.\n\nFor cat owners whose pets mysteriously disappeared in Bray-les-Mareuil, a small town near Abbeville in northern France’s Somme region, the problem lies with fellow residents who clearly don’t like cats.\n\nFor several months, some 20 domestic felines have died or disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Many residents interviewed by local media believe they have neighbors hunting cats. “When they see a cat, they shoot it!,” one told Actu France. “In Bray, they don't like cats,“ he added. Some dead cats have been found with bullet marks.\n\nOver three weeks in 2022, the town of Citry in Seine-et-Marne lost nine cats, spurring locals to hang warning signs that read “Be careful, a cat killer lives in the village,” and calling for police to investigate, The Telegraph reported.\n\nIn 2020, a 39-year-old man from Vesoul in eastern France was convicted for stealing, torturing and killing local cats. The cat killer, a known drug user, admitted to stealing cats using a leash then stabbing them repeatedly or beating them to death with an iron bar or by throwing them against a radiator.\n\nIn 2017, more than 200 stray as well as pet cats at the seaside resort of Saint-Pierre-la-Mer in Aude in southwestern France were killed over several weeks in an apparent mass-poisoning campaign, leaving the cats’ tongues blue and local residents in shock.\n\n“With the loss of animals which affects so many owners, the climate has become detestable; everyone is suspicious of everyone,” a resident told the local Le Vert. “We are all afraid that a child will one day ingest this poison about which we know nothing.”\n\nCats’ prey and predators: the polemic\n\nAs the cases abound, so do the controversies.\n\nThe impact of cats living outside in cities and towns is enormous for the planet’s biodiversity. Recent studies confirm the definition of the pets as “super predators” threatening many species, particularly small birds.\n\nSome countries have taken radical action to control them. Australia, for example, has decided to use new technology that fires toxic gel at feral cats as an element of the strategy to eradicate them. Killer robots identify feral cats from their silhouette and their gait, and fire poison at them.\n\nFrance has a cat population numbering an astonishing 14 million and their existence pose many ecological challenges, with the scientific community concerned about their impact on wildlife.\n\nA new compilation of data from more than 500 studies published on the diet of domestic or abandoned cats shows that a total of 2,084 different species of small animals could have been eaten by cats. Among them are 47% birds, 22% reptiles, 21% small mammals, a significant number of insect (6%) and amphibians (3%)."
