        "text": "To get them clear in my head and to reinforce previous readings, I am going to summarize the introductory readings I have assigned my class for this week. I am going to start with: Robert Darnton, “What is the History of Books?’ Revisited,” Modern Intellectual History 4 (2007): 495-508. The others will follow over the course of the next day or two.\n\nIn this article, which provides Darnton’s thoughts on his seminal article “What is the History of Books?” published in 1982 and subsequently reprinted many times, Darnton takes a modest stance, claiming that he never thought he was telling people how to do book history. He did not create a model that would provide answers for every question, but he tried to offer a way to manage the specialization and differentiation that he saw in book history in the early 1980s. His answer was the communication circuit, which traced the social history of a book from producer, printer, shipper, sellers, readers, and back to the author.\n\nThe genesis for the article emerged from his work in the archives of the Swiss publishing firm Société typographique de Neuchâtel (STN), which began in 1965. (See the STN Online Database Archive) At first he was simply searching for information on publication of works by Jacques Pierre Brissot, but he discovered he could recreate a vibrant world of the variety of book workers in pre-Revolutionary France through a huge cache of 50,000 letters in the archive. He found a very complex business system that required great dexterity and flexibility. Book workers wold not focus on one part of their business because all parts were interconnected.\n\nPaper: it made up about half the cost of book; printers bought paper for specific jobs and hired help based on specific delivery dates; payment was difficult because of the lack of specie and unpredictable value of bills of exchange; paper was a huge part of negotiations of any publisher; people noticed quality of paper in 18th cen., something we have lost.\n\nSmuggling: With censorship in 18th cen. France, publishers worked with smugglers, the most sophisticated of whom were called “insurers.” These insurers would offer to take books over the mountains for a percentage of the wholesale cost of books. They hired local villagers to haul the books in 50-60 lbs. packs. If the villager was caught, the insurer would pay the the full cost of the books to the publisher and the villager would go to the galley prisons for a decade.\n\nDistribution and Sales: All major firms used representatives to sell books, collect bills, arrange shipping, and inspect shops. These reps often crossed paths and traded gossip in inns and taverns. Their work supplemented recommendations from businessmen and allies and helped publishers like STN make better decisions.\n\nLiterary Agents: They did not help authors, but helped publishing firms in the provinces. They wrote reports on the reputation of authors, books that sold well, and offered up information the state of the trade.\n\nPiracy: France was surrounded by firms that would pirate any best-seller. Darnton estimates that more than 1/2 of book in France before the Revolution were pirated. There was no copyright, like in Britain, but privileges did exist, which gave the right of a printer to produce a text inside the jurisdiction of the sovereign who gave privilege. Printers often worked together in “treaties” to manage how they would release books.\n\nSwapping: The alliances mentioned above led to book swaps too. Usual print runs were around 1,000 and of that, around 100 were reserved for trading with other firms to guarantee a diverse stock. Trades involved detailed negotiations over paper quality, denseness of type, and demand.\n\nDemand: Everyone raced to the market when a best-seller emerged. Best-sellers were usually printed in small editions by many firms, unlike today. If late to the game, or if a printer over-produced a book of only mid-level demand, the financial consequence could be nasty. This meant publishers took great efforts to gather intelligence on markets.\n\nPolitics: Publishers had to know the activities and policies of censors, police, and inspectors, which varied by place and year. A book historian can find references to provisions of government policy in books, but to understand their effects, one has to examine correspondence."
