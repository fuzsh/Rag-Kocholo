        "text": "There are several famous mice that can be found throughout the classic animated Disney films and shorts. However, this week we are featuring one of the lessor known mice in a full length animated feature that is often overlooked. The Aristocats debuted on December 24th, 1970 and was the first animated feature to be made by the Disney studios after Walt Disney’s death. It is in this film that we find Roquefort, the polite and loyal house-mouse who lives in Madame Bonfamille’s chateau.\n\nUnlike the cat and mouse fights we see in other well known Disney classics such as Cinderella, Roquefort and the house cats are great friends. In fact, the kittens love Roquefort so much that they even share their food with him. It is on one unfortunate afternoon that Edgar, the house butler, drugs the food that is meant for Duchess and the kittens but in the process he drugs Roquefort as well. Edgar knows that Madame Bonfamille will leave her entire estate to the cats so he decides to take them to the countryside and leave them alone so they can never find their way back. Roquefort is left at the mansion alone until he awakes to find that Duchess and the kittens are missing. He searches frantically for them and is filled with great sadness that he may never see his beloved friends again. Near the end of the story, Duchess and the kittens finally make their way back to Madame Bonfamille’s with a little help from Thomas O’Malley, an alley cat they meet along the way. Roquefort hears the cats coming and realizes that Edgar is going to catch them again. He tries to warn them but it is too late and Edgar snatches them up once again in a sack. Roquefort runs to find O’Malley and is instructed to go fetch Scat Cat and his gang of alley cats. It is at this moment that we truly see Roquefort’s bravery as he has never met a gang of alley cats before and will certainly meet his death if he fails to convince them he is a friend of O’Malley and Duchess. With Roquefort’s help, the alley cats reach the house and help O’Malley save Duchess and the kittens from Edgar. He is truly a hero despite how small he might be."
