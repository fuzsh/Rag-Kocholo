        "text": "Sterling Price Holloway, Jr. (January 4, 1905 – November 22, 1992) was a character actor who appeared in over 150 films and television shows, as well as a perennial voice actor for the Walt Disney Studios.\n\nHolloway was named after Confederate General Sterling \"Pap\" Price. He was born in Cedartown, Georgia in 1905. After attending the Georgia Military Academy in College Park, he attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Holloway made his way through the Theater Guild to appear in the first joint venture of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, Garrick Gaieties, a series of revues in the 1920s. With his light tenor voice, young Holloway made a foray into a professional singing career. He introduced the Rodgers and Hart standard \"I'll Take Manhattan\" in 1925, and in the 1926 edition of Garrick Gaities where he introduced their \"Mountain Greenery\" (\"... where God paints the scenery\").\n\nIn 1926, Holloway moved to Hollywood to begin a movie career that was to last for almost fifty years. Though he was one of the busiest character actors in the movies (and an excellent athletic dancer), he soon found his niche as a voice actor.\n\nHolloway served in World War II as a member of the Army's Special Services unit. He produced a show for servicemen and toured with it near the front lines in North Africa and Italy. In 1941, Holloway's unique voice was heard in his first Walt Disney animated film, Dumbo, where he was the voice of \"Mr. Stork.\" He was the voice of the adult \"Flower\" in Bambi, the narrator of the Antarctic penguin sequence in The Three Caballeros, and the narrator in the Peter and the Wolf sequence of Make Mine Music. He also voiced Drake Mallard the duck in Darkwing Duck, Kaa in The Jungle Book, Roquefort the mouse in The Aristocats, and the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland. His greatest fame was achieved as the voice of the title character in Disney's Winnie-the-Pooh featurettes, a role that he voiced until his retirement in 1979. Disney honored him as an official Disney legend in 1991. Holloway also voiced the original Cheerios Honey-Nut Bee. His last voice acting credit was as the Narrator in the Moonlighting episode Atomic Shakesphere.\n\nRadio[]\n\nHe also brought his distinctive voice to radio, where he was heard on such shows as The Railroad Hour, The United States Steel Hour, Suspense and Lux Radio Theater.\n\nTelevision[]\n\nSterling Holloway had a long career as a character actor in live-action films as well, with his memorably comic face, tousled sandy hair and squeaky voice. On TV, he had a recurring role as the lovable Uncle Oscar, an eccentric inventor in the Adventures of Superman series, and also had a recurring role on The Life of Riley. He guest-starred in such TV shows as The Untouchables, Hazel, The Twilight Zone, Gilligan's Island, The Andy Griffith Show, and Moonlighting (his final appearance on film, narrating a Shakespeare-themed episode). Holloway took on the unlikely role of a Mafia hitman in his last film Thunder and Lightning (1977).\n\nIn later years Holloway amassed a major collection of modern art, and was an occasional lecturer on the subject. He died in 1992 from a cardiac arrest at age 87.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFeatures:\n\nAmerican Madness (1932)\n\nBlonde Venus (1932)\n\nFaithless (1932)\n\nRockabye (1932)\n\nLawyer Man (1932)\n\nHard to Handle (1933)\n\nBlondie Johnson (1933)\n\nFast Workers (1933)\n\nHell Below (1933)\n\nElmer, the Great (1933)\n\nPicture Snatcher (1933)\n\nAdorable (1933)\n\nInternational House (1933)\n\nGold Diggers of 1933 (1933)\n\nProfessional Sweetheart (1933)\n\nWhen Ladies Meet (1933)\n\nWild Boys of the Road (1933)\n\nDancing Lady (1933)\n\nAdvice to the Lovelorn (1933)\n\nGoing Hollywood (1933)\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1933)\n\nTomorrow's Children (1934)\n\nThe Cat and the Fiddle (1934)\n\nStrictly Dynamite (1934)\n\nOperator 13 (1934)\n\nMurder in the Private Car (1934)\n\nThe Back Page (1934)\n\nDown to Their Last Yacht (1934)\n\nGift of Gab (1934)\n\nThe Merry Widow (1934)\n\nGirl o' My Dreams (1934)\n\nA Wicked Woman (1934)\n\nTomorrow's Youth (1935)\n\nThe Lottery Lover (1935)\n\nLife Begins at Forty (1935)\n\nDoubting Thomas (1935)\n\nI Live My Life (1935)\n\n1,000 Dollars a Minute (1935)\n\nRendezvous (1935)\n\nPalm Springs (1936)\n\nCareer Woman (1936)\n\nJoin the Marines (1937)\n\nMaid of Salem (1937)\n\nWhen Love Is Young (1937)\n\nThe Woman I Love (1937)\n\nVarsity Show (1937)\n\nBehind the Mike (1937)\n\nOf Human Hearts (1938)\n\nDr. Rhythm (1938)\n\nHeld for Ransom (1938)\n\nProfessor Beware (1938)\n\nSpring Madness (1938)\n\nSt. Louis Blues (1939)\n\nNick Carter, Master Detective (1939)\n\nRemember the Night (1940)\n\nThe Blue Bird (1940)\n\nHit Parade of 1941 (1940)\n\nStreet of Memories (1940)\n\nLittle Men (1940)\n\nCheers for Miss Bishop (1941)\n\nMeet John Doe (1941)\n\nNew Wine (1941)\n\nTop Sergeant Mulligan (1941)\n\nDumbo (1941) (voice)\n\nLook Who's Laughing (1941)\n\nDon't Get Personal (1942)\n\nThe Lady Is Willing (1942)\n\nBambi (1942) (voice)\n\nIceland (1942)\n\nHere We Go Again (1942)\n\nStar Spangled Rhythm (1942)\n\nThe Three Caballeros (1944) (voice)\n\nWildfire (1945)\n\nA Walk in the Sun (1945)\n\nMake Mine Music (1946) (voice)\n\nDeath Valley (1946)\n\nSioux City Sue (1946)\n\nHer Wonderful Lie (1947)\n\nTrail to San Antone (1947)\n\nTwilight on the Rio Grande (1947)\n\nSaddle Pals (1947)\n\nRobin Hood of Texas (1947)\n\nThe Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend (1949)\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1951) (voice)\n\nKentucky Rifle (1956)\n\nShake, Rattle and Rock!
