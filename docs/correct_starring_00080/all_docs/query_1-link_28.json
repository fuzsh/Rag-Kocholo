Walt Disney was really enamored with him.”\n\nHolloway appeared on screen initially in “Casey at the Bat” in 1927, followed by “Elmer the Great,””Gold Diggers of 1933,””Dancing Lady,””Advice to the Lovelorn,””American Madness,””Hell Below,” 1933’s “Alice in Wonderland” (as the Frog), “Strictly Dynamite,””The Merry Widow,””Life Begins at Forty,””Doubting Thomas,””Maid of Salem,””The Woman I Love,””Varsity Show,””Of Human Hearts, “”Doctor Rhythm,””Professor Beware,””Remember the Night,””Spring Madness,””Nick Carter–Master Detective,””The Blue Bird,””Little Men,””Meet Joe Doe,””Cheers for Miss Bishop,””New Wine” and “Iceland,” all prior to World War II.\n\nAfter the war, he resumed his on-screen work in 1946 with “A Walk in the Sun, “”Sioux City Sue,””The Beautiful Blonde From Bashful Bend,””Shake, Rattle and Rock,””The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,””It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, “”Batman,””Live a Little Love a Little,” and “Thunder and Lightning” in 1977.\n\nOn TV, he appeared in “The Life of Riley,””The Baileys of Balboa” and “The Andy Griffith Show.”\n\nBorn on Jan. 14, 1905, in Cedartown, Ga., Holloway graduated from Georgia Military Academy and studied at New York’s American Academy of Dramatic Arts.
