        "text": "Tag Archives: The Aristocats\n\nDisney Rewatch: The Aristocats\n\nPosted by in Disney Rewatch\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nDisney, Disney Rewatch, The Aristocats\n\nIt’s been a while since I did a Disney Rewatch post but over the weekend I watched Disney’s tale of swinging cats, originally made in 1970s. Here were my thoughts when watching this Disney Classic.\n\nI love the pencil-looking animated opening credits – very cute! Classic Disney movies all seem to have these extended opening credits and it’s always interesting to see what they do with them.\n\nFrou-Frou the horse has the best hat!\n\nPink hat, covered in daisies? Yes please!\n\nMadame and Georges are fabulous together and are probably worthy of a prequel showing how their friendship formed in their heyday!\n\nWhy does Edgar the English Butler living in Paris see dollar signs before his eyes when he hears about the inheritance? Don’t see any need for American currency in this equation!\n\nRoquefort the Mouse sounds exactly like Winnie The Pooh….*looks him up* ….oh! It is Winnie the Pooh voice actor Sterling Holloway!\n\nAlso while we are at it Napoleon the dog is also the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood.\n\nBut back to our mouse friend who runs out to help Duchess and the Kittens in an red cape and hat that I am very jealous of! Suddenly realising this could be a very subtle comic con outfit!\n\nFinally we get to meet our streetwise ally cat O’Malley! Who is also Baloo from The Jungle Book and Little John from Robin Hood. Must have been Disney’s go to guy for all round good guy who is a little rough around the edges.\n\nWhat is it about geese waddling down a lane that is instantly funny! I think it is the butt wiggle!\n\nSpeaking of hilarity – I laughed out loud when Duchess asked ‘What is a Schwinger?’\n\nAristoCats doesn’t have lots of music but it sure does have a hit with ‘Everybody Wants to be a Cat!’\n\nAnd then I promptly cried afterwards when little kitten sighs ‘Well, we almost had a Father.’ *sobs*\n\nAnother brilliant moment is when little mousey runs after the Scat Cats prompting a French man to stare in disbelief and pore away his wine!\n\nDisney has been accused of always ending their films with a happy ever after wedding but I think people are forgetting that Disney also has a film that ends with a rich elderly eccentric setting up a fund for a Cat Night Club in Paris!\n\nAll in all The Aristocats is wonderful and wild! A great addition to any Disney collection."
