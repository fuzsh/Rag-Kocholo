        "text": "It's a favorite of mine too, but I don't think it would translate well into live action.\n\nI don't understand how these Disney remakes justify their exitance creatively (obviously they make money, which is why Disney keeps doing them). I thought Jungle Book 2016 was cool, because they changed up some things to make it fresh (like Mowgli not going to the Man Village and skipping the fake-out death with Baloo). But a lot of the other ones just seem very bland. Lion King 2019 was just a straight-up remake that made everything slightly worse, and Lady and the Tramp was boring and forgettable. I'm not sure if I've seen any of the others, but I've heard almost universally bad (or at best \"meh\") things about most of them. I think they really need to start taking more creative chances. Keep the spirit of the original and some of the popular iconography, but play around with new themes, twists, or plotlines. There's no reason to give the audience the same experience twice.\n\nAs far as Aristocats goes, I see this just being another Lady and the Tramp 2019. It'll probably be a blander remake of the animated film with over-animated CGI cats. Hopefully they use real ones though...the whole fun of animal movies is seeing cute trained animals. I at least kind of look forward to seeing how they portray the butler."
