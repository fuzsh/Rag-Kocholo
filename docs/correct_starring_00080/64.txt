Films of Emil Sitka: MORON THAN OFF (1946)

by Saxon E. Sitka

For his fourteenth film role, Emil was back again at Columbia's short subjects department, making his second appearance with Sterling Holloway. The two had worked together about four months earlier in MR. WRIGHT GOES WRONG.

In MORON THAN OFF, Sterling Holloway and Monte Collins put their money together to buy a sweepstakes ticket "fifty-fifty." They even tear the ticket in two with each partner keeping one half. When they win, however, Sterling can't seem to find his half.

As the Manager of the Sweepstakes Office, this is another small "bit part" for Emil, who appears just long enough to demand the other half of the winning ticket.

Emil's diary for Monday, September 9, 1946:

Back with Sterling Holloway again. Last May we performed our great glue scene together, which is still mentioned by the studio men as "very funny.

Sterling Holloway was a busy actor in the 40's and 50's, appearing in dozens of feature films. In addition to several comedy shorts, Emil worked with him in THE BEAUTIFUL BLONDE FROM BASHFUL BEND (1949) starring Betty Grable and Cesar Romero.

Today, Holloway is remembered mostly for his distinctively mellow voice. He was in demand for animated movies and did the voice for several notable animated characters including "The Cheshire Cat" in ALICE IN WONDERLAND (1951), "Kaa the Snake" in JUNGLE BOOK (1967), "Roquefort the Cat" in THE ARISTOCATS (1970), and "Winnie the Pooh" in the four animated POOH features of the 60's and 70's.
