        "text": "MarkLogic is a multi-model NoSQL database designed to manage unstructured, semi-structured and structured data. Thanks to its flexibility and agility, MarkLogic is capable of storing, managing and integrating massive volumes of heterogeneous data, both in terms of sources and formats.\n\nThis is complemented by a multitude of services (such as metadata or ML models) to help companies build large-scale applications, develop their analytics and machine learning models.\n\nBetween its database server and its complete suite of services and applications, MarkLogic is an all-in-one solution for businesses.\n\nSemaphore, the semantic AI tool, facilitates the management of metadata. Itâ€™s possible to create and manage metadata to make available information more intelligible, and thus to make more informed decisions.\n\nHere are the main features of Semaphore:\n\nCreation and maintenance of knowledge models;\n\nCollaboration with experts;\n\nKnowledge model enrichment;\n\nMapping of models and related data;\n\nWorkflow and lifecycle management;\n\nSemantic integration and enhancement;\n\nClassification review tools;\n\nThe fact extraction framework;\n\nContextual navigation in the user interface;\n\nEtc.\n\nWhile MarkLogic is an extremely powerful data management tool, it is not sufficient on its own. Indeed, to manage large volumes of data, create web applications, develop analyses or Machine Learning models, it is essential to have high-performance tools, but also, and above all, to have the necessary skills. And that means training DataScientest helps you develop the knowledge you need through its data training courses. Come and join us!"
