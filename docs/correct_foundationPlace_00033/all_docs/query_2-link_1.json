        "text": "MarkLogic ServerDeveloper(s)MarkLogicWritten inC, C++, JavaScriptAvailable inEnglishTypeDocument-oriented databaseWebsitewww .marklogic .com\n\nMarkLogic Server is a document-oriented database developed by MarkLogic. It is a NoSQL multi-model database that evolved from an XML database to natively store JSON documents and RDF triples, the data model for semantics. MarkLogic is designed to be a data hub for operational and analytical data.[1]\n\nMarkLogic Server was built to address shortcomings with existing search and data products. The product first focused on using XML as the document markup standard and XQuery as the query standard for accessing collections of documents up to hundreds of terabytes in size.\n\nCurrently the MarkLogic platform is widely used in publishing, government, finance and other sectors.[1] MarkLogic's customers are mostly Global 2000 companies.\n\nMarkLogic uses documents without upfront schemas to maintain a flexible data model. In addition to having a flexible data model, MarkLogic uses a distributed, scale-out architecture that can handle hundreds of billions of documents and hundreds of terabytes of data. It has received Common Criteria certification, and has high availability and disaster recovery. MarkLogic is designed to run on-premises and within public or private cloud environments like Amazon Web Services.\n\nIndexing\n\nMarkLogic indexes the content and structure of documents including words, phrases, relationships, and values in over 200 languages with tokenization, collation, and stemming for core languages. Functionality includes the ability to toggle range indexes, geospatial indexes, the RDF triple index, and reverse indexes on or off based on your data, the kinds of queries that you will run, and your desired performance.\n\nFull-text search\n\nMarkLogic supports search across its data and metadata using a word or phrase and incorporates Boolean logic, stemming, wildcards, case sensitivity, punctuation sensitivity, diacritic sensitivity, and search term weighting. Data can be searched using JavaScript, XQuery, SPARQL, and SQL.\n\nSemantics\n\nMarkLogic uses RDF triples to provide semantics for ease of storing metadata and querying.\n\nACID\n\nUnlike other NoSQL databases, MarkLogic maintains ACID consistency for transactions.\n\nReplication\n\nMarkLogic provides high availability with replica sets.\n\nScalability\n\nMarkLogic scales horizontally using sharding.\n\nMarkLogic can run over multiple servers, balancing the load or replicating data to keep the system up and running in the event of hardware failure.\n\nSecurity\n\nMarkLogic has built in security features such as element-level permissions and data redaction.\n\nOptic API for Relational Operations\n\nAn API that lets developers view their data as documents, graphs or rows.[1]\n\nSecurity\n\nMarkLogic provides redaction, encryption, and element-level security (allowing for control on read and write rights on parts of a document).[2]\n\nBanking[1]\n\nBig Data\n\nFraud prevention\n\nInsurance Claims Management and Underwriting\n\nMaster data management\n\nRecommendation engines\n\nMarkLogic is available under various licensing and delivery models, namely a free Developer or an Essential Enterprise license.[3] Licenses are available from MarkLogic or directly from cloud marketplaces such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\n2003—Cerisent XQE 1.0\n\n2004—Cerisent XQE 2.0\n\n2005—MarkLogic Server 3.0\n\n2006—MarkLogic Server 3.1\n\n2007—MarkLogic Server 3.2\n\n2008—MarkLogic Server 4.0\n\n2009—MarkLogic Server 4.1\n\n2010—MarkLogic Server 4.2\n\n2011—MarkLogic Server 5.0\n\n2012—MarkLogic Server 6.0\n\n2013—MarkLogic Server 7.0\n\n2015—MarkLogic Server 8.0: Ability to store JSON data and process data using JavaScript.[3]\n\n2017—MarkLogic Server 9.0: Data integration across Relational and Non-Relational data.\n\n2019—MarkLogic Server 10.0\n\n2022—MarkLogic Server 11.0"
