        "text": "Before you work on curating your data in MarkLogic, you need a reliable way to get your data into MarkLogic. Apache NiFi, a tool developed by the NSA and released into the open source community, is a scalable, secure way to manage dataflows between systems. The MarkLogic Data Movement SDK (DMSDK) is designed to efficiently manage MarkLogic dataflows. In this lightning talk, we will demonstrate how our DMSDK-based NiFi processors allow you to create an ingest dataflow in just a few clicks.\n\nPresenter: Ganesh Vaideeswaran, VP of Product Development, MarkLogic"
