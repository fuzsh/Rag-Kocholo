They have offices in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\n\nIn February 2023, MarkLogic was acquired by Progress Software for $355 million.[2]\n\nOverview[edit]\n\nFounded in 2001 by Christopher Lindblad and Paul Pedersen, MarkLogic Corporation is a privately held company with over 500 employees[3] that was acquired by Vector Capital in October 2020.[4]\n\nThe company claims to have over 1,000 customers, including Chevron, JPMorgan Chase, Erie Insurance Group, Johnson & Johnson, and the US Army.[5]\n\nMarkLogic has gotten positive reception by multiple tech newsletters.[6][7][8]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nMarkLogic was originally named Cerisent when it was founded in 2001[9] by Christopher Lindblad, who was the Chief Architect of the Ultraseek search engine at Infoseek, as well as Paul Pedersen, a professor of computer science at Cornell University and UCLA, and Frank R. Caufield, Founder of Darwin Ventures,[10] to address shortcomings with existing search and data products. The product first focused on using XML document markup standard and XQuery as the query standard for accessing collections of documents up to hundreds of terabytes in size.\n\nIn 2009, IDC mentioned MarkLogic as one of the top Innovative Information Access Companies with under $100 million in revenue.[11]\n\nIn May 2012, Gary Bloom was appointed as Chief Executive Officer.[12] He held senior positions at Symantec Corporation, Veritas Software, and Oracle.[13]\n\nPost-acquisition, the company named Jeffrey Casale as its new CEO.\n\nFunding[edit]\n\nMarkLogic received its first financing of $6 million in 2002 led by Sequoia Capital, followed by a $12 million investment in June 2004, this time led by Lehman Brothers Venture Partners.[14] The company received additional funding of $15 million in 2007 from its existing investors Sequoia and Lehman.[14] The same investors put another $12.5 million into the company in 2009.[15]\n\nOn 12 April 2013, MarkLogic received an additional $25 million in funding, led by Sequoia Capital and Tenaya Capital.[16][17] On May 12, 2015, MarkLogic received an additional $102 million in funding, led by Wellington Management Company, with contributions from Arrowpoint Partners and existing backers, Sequoia Capital, Tenaya Capital, and Northgate Capital. This brought the company's total funding to $173 million and gave MarkLogic a pre-money valuation of $1 billion.[18]\n\nNTT Data announced a strategic investment in MarkLogic on 31 May 2017.[19]\n\nProducts[edit]\n\nFurther information: MarkLogic Server\n\nThe MarkLogic product is considered a multi-model NoSQL database for its ability to store, manage, search JSON and XML documents and semantic data (RDF triples).\n\nReleases[edit]\n\n2001 – Cerisent XQE 1.0[citation needed]\n\n2004 – Cerisent XQE 2.0[citation needed]\n\n2005 – MarkLogic Server 3.0[citation needed]\n\n2006 – MarkLogic Server 3.1\n\n2007 – MarkLogic Server 3.2\n\n2008 – MarkLogic Server 4.0\n\n2009 – MarkLogic Server 4.1\n\n2010 – MarkLogic Server 4.2\n\n2011 – MarkLogic Server 5.0\n\n2012 – MarkLogic Server 6.0\n\n2013 – MarkLogic Server 7.0\n\n2015 – MarkLogic Server 8.0: Ability to store JSON data and process data using JavaScript.[20]\n\n2017 – MarkLogic Server 9.0: Data integration across Relational and Non-Relational data.\n\n2019 – MarkLogic Server 10.0\n\nLicensing and support[edit]\n\nMarkLogic is proprietary software, available under a freeware developer software license or a commercial \"Essential Enterprise\" license.[21] Licenses are available from MarkLogic or directly from cloud marketplaces such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\nTechnology[edit]\n\nMarkLogic is a multi-model NoSQL database that has evolved from its XML database roots to also natively store JSON documents and RDF triples for its semantic data model. It uses a distributed architecture that can handle hundreds of billions of documents and hundreds of terabytes of data.[citation needed] MarkLogic maintains ACID consistency for transactions and has a Common Criteria certification security model, high availability, and disaster recovery. It is designed to run on-premises within public or private cloud computing environments like Amazon Web Services.[22]\n\nMarkLogic's Enterprise NoSQL database platform is utilized in various sectors, including publishing, government and finance. It is employed in a number of systems currently in production.[22]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nDocument database\n\nGraph database\n\nMulti-model database\n\nNoSQL\n\nTriple store\n\nMongoDB\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nFurther reading[edit]"
