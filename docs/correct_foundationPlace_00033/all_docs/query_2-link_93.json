        "text": "I was always curious of connecting MarkLogic with data scientist favorite language “Python”.\n\nI got chance to explore in one of my recent projects which I was working on.\n\nStep 1: Inserting Document into MarkLogic using python\n\nWe are using python request library for loading document.\n\nThis step will insert a document into MarkLogic default database\n\nStep 2: Reading document from MarkLogic using python\n\nIn this step we are getting document from MarkLogic by passing URI\n\nStep 3 Updating the already existing document in MarkLogic\n\nIn this step I am going to modify the already existing document which I have inserted in step 1. I will use same put method in the request.\n\nStep 4 Deleting the document present in MarkLogic\n\nIn this step I will delete the document present in MarkLogic\n\nThis was small CRUD operation which I tried to perform by using REST API of MarkLogic. This is just the tip of the large iceberg in the development world, but it is good to start with.\n\nIn future I will bring more stories related to Marklogic.\n\nReference:"
