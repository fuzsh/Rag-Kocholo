        "text": "MarkLogic 6: An introduction\n\nBy Ryan Kamauff\n\nThe latest permeation of MarkLogic (version 6) offers ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions, horizontal scaling, real-time indexing, high availability, disaster recovery, government-grade security and built-in search.\n\nMarkLogic has made application development easier with Java and REST APIs. They also added JSON support. This allows developers to use their language of choice, and eliminate the need to learn new production language. It also provides data visualization widgets. These widgets can display the shape and dimensions of data, identify trends or patterns and explore the data as a whole.\n\nVersion 6 also comes with built in database analytics. Integration with IBM Cognos and Tableau is included as well. This enables analysts to create reports, dashboards and the data. Lastly, version 6 adds the in-database MapReduce capabilities.\n\nFind out more about MarkLogic version 6 here.\n\nAnd here is more from their website:\n\nMission-critical Big Data Applications around the world are powered by MarkLogic. It is the only Enterprise NoSQL database that manages all types of data at scale in real time. It gives you the range of features you need to deliver value. It lets you leverage your existing tools, knowledge, and experience. And it provides a reliable, scalable, and secure platform for your important data.\n\nNew Feature Highlights\n\nBusiness Intelligence Tools\n\nBig Data in the enterprise needs to be accessible to everyone who could benefit from the information. To make that easier, MarkLogic now includes out-of-the-box integration with Business Intelligence tools like IBM Cognos and Tableau to allow analysts to use familiar solutions for generating reports, dashboards and data exploration results from data stored in MarkLogic.\n\nREST API\n\nIn order to enable developers to work in their language of choice, MarkLogic now includes a REST API that allows you to perform searches, create documents, read documents, update documents, and delete documents. The REST API allows you to build fully functional MarkLogic applications in any programming language. It also allows you to directly load JSON documents.\n\nMarkLogic Java API\n\nThe new Java API allows you full-featured access to MarkLogic functionality with pure Java. The MarkLogic Java API is written on top of the REST API, and has all of its functionality such as paginated search with facets and snippets, full document CRUD operations, and more.\n\nEnhanced JSON Support\n\nOur new JSON library makes it easy to store JSON documents as key-value stores, and to convert them back and forth between JSON and XML. The REST Client API and the MarkLogic Client API for Java make use of this functionality to make it easier to load and work with JSON documents.\n\nVisualization Widgets\n\nWe’ve also added Visualization Widgets so you can easily build powerful applications that help your users discover the shape and dimensions of data, quickly assess trends and patterns, and explore data more intuitively. You can access these widgets with MarkLogic Application Builder.\n\nIn-database MapReduce & User Defined Functions\n\nMany customers wanted more flexibility to develop complex, real-time analytics. We’ve extended MarkLogic 6 to let you create user-defined aggregate functions (UDFs) that take advantage of MarkLogic’s parallel-processing architecture. We call this In-database MapReduce, and it lets you create blindingly fast analytic functions with custom C++ code by writing “map” and “reduce” functions.\n\nIn-Database Analytic Functions\n\nIn order to enable customers to leverage the power of the MarkLogic platform to produce enterprise-grade analytics, we’ve included several built-in XQuery functions to perform analytic and statistical functions.\n\nMarkLogic Content Pump (mlcp)\n\nIn order to speed loading and exporting of data between databases, we are introducing the MarkLogic Content Pump (mlcp). mlcp is a command-line tool for loading content into MarkLogic Server and for migrating content from one instance of MarkLogic to another, even if they are on different platforms. If you have a Hadoop cluster, mlcp takes advantage of Hadoop to parallelize the loading. mlcp takes much of the functionality of the open source projects Record Loader and xqsync and bundles them in a single package, and allows them to take advantage of Hadoop if it is available; Hadoop is not required to use mlcp, but is used if it is available.\n\nFIPS 140-2 Cryptographic Compliance\n\nMarkLogic 6 includes the OpenSSL Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Object Module, which was evaluated by the National Institute of Standards (NIST) for FIPS 140-2 compliance. More details on the OpenSSL Object Module and on the FIPS 140-2 compliance.\n\nSearch API Enhancements\n\nWhen you’ve got a lot of data, great search is key. We’ve worked to make our search API even better with the following enhancements:\n\nStructured Search\n\nExtracting metadata at search time\n\nModify the unconstrained term behavior using <search:term>\n\nRange constraints for path range indexes\n\nAbility to return values from range indexes with search:values\n\nJSON key support\n\nPath Range Indexes\n\nIn order to enable fine-grained range indexes while maintaining the advantages of using the lexicon functions and the range query constructors MarkLogic now includes support for range index specified by a path. You can specify a subset of XPath as the definition of what goes into an index. The search API can take advantage of path range indexes to create range constraints on them. Path range indexes are also useful when setting up SQL views on data stored in a MarkLogic database.\n\nSynonym Search\n\nYou now have the option to ensure that documents that contain multiple synonyms are scored appropriately, rather than unnaturally gaining points to the search score. Learn more about how the architecture of MarkLogic works and how you can deploy it.\n\nOriginal post"
