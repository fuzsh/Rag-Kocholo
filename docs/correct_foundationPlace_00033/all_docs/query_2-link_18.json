For more information, see Run Initial SQL.\n\nSelect Sign In.\n\nIf the connection is unsuccessful, verify that your user name and password are correct and that the port number correctly identifies the MarkLogic database configured by your database administrator. If the connection continues to fail, your computer is having trouble locating the server. Contact your network administrator or database administrator.\n\n(Optional) Select the default data source name at the top of the page, and then enter a unique data source name for use in Tableau. For example, use a data source naming convention that helps other users of the data source figure out which data source to connect to.\n\nDrag the table to the canvas, and then select the sheet tab to start your analysis.\n\nUse custom SQL to connect to a specific query rather than the entire data source. For more information, see Connect to a Custom SQL Query."
