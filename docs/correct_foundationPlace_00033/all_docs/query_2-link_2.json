        "text": "Overview of MarkLogic Server\n\nMarkLogic is a database designed from the ground up to make massive quantities of heterogenous data easily accessible through search. The design philosophy behind the evolution of MarkLogic is that storing data is only part of the solution. The data must also be quickly and easily retrieved and presented in a way that makes sense to different types of users. Additionally, the data must be reliably maintained by an enterprise grade, scalable software solution that runs on commodity hardware. The purpose of this guide is to describe the mechanisms in MarkLogic that are used to achieve these objectives.\n\nMarkLogic fuses together database internals, search-style indexing, and application server behaviors into a unified system. It uses XML and JSON documents as its data model, and stores the documents within a transactional repository. It indexes the words and values from each of the loaded documents, as well as the document structure. And, because of its unique Universal Index, MarkLogic does not require advance knowledge of the document structure and adherence to a particular schema. Through its application server capabilities, it is programmable and extensible.\n\nMarkLogic clusters on commodity hardware using a shared-nothing architecture and supports massive scale, high-availability, and very high performance. Customer deployments have scaled to hundreds of terabytes of source data while maintaining sub-second query response time.\n\nThis chapter contains the following topics:"
