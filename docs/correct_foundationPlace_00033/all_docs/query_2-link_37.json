        "text": "More news of massive cash influxes as MarkLogic, a database vendor, announces another $102 million in growth funding. MarkLogic has been in existence for over a decade and delivers a NoSQL database platform. NoSQL, as opposed to regular relational databases, are better suited to unstructured data. The NoSQL approach has come to prominence with the rise of social networks and the increasing amount of unstructured data needing to be stored and processes.\n\nMarkLogic has built up a good sized business - it is headquartered in Silicon Valley but has offices globally - in Europe, across the US and in APAC. The company isn't particularly well known but has grown revenues to beyond $100 million. For such a large company, MarkLogic has only raised a modest $71 million to date.\n\nThis new funding was led by Wellington Management Company LLP and included participation from new investor Arrowpoint Partners, existing investors Northgate Capital, Sequoia Capital, Tenaya Capital, and Gary Bloom, the Company’s president and CEO. According to MarkLogic, this funding round had a target raise of $70 million but the round was oversubscribed hence the extension up to $102 million.\n\nIt terms of business performance, MarkLogic saw bookings growth of 50 percent in the last year while the customer base grew by close to 20 percent. Much of that growth was outside of the US - European business nearly doubled and APAC business set a new company record. Reference customers include FAA, Elsevier, Harvard Business Publications, and the BBC.\n\nMarkLogic sees itself as being the natural progression for customers with Oracle databases - 80 percent of the company's business comes from Oracle migrations. CEO Gary Bloom states his company's unique selling points as the ability to integrate, manage and operationalize both structured and unstructured data. As the company states:\n\nTraditional database management systems were not designed to manage the dynamic nature of new data nor integrate and access heterogeneous data that has become the norm in almost every global organization. In recent years, many open source NoSQL technologies have attempted to resolve the data integration issue and while developers liked the flexibility of these solutions, they ignored the needs of the enterprise. The lack of essential enterprise features like data reliability, transactional consistency, security and availability have kept open source technologies from being a viable alternative to traditional relational databases for mission-critical applications.\n\nThere's a lot of competition in the NoSQL space, but with this pool of money, not to mention the leverage that some 550 enterprise customers brings, MarkLogic looks set to execute upon its very real opportunity."
