        "text": "The Netherlands’ Amsterdam Schiphol Airport has selected US software firm MarkLogic as its operational flight database provider.\n\nSchiphol Airport is part of Royal Schiphol Group, which operates airports both in the Netherlands and abroad.\n\nMarkLogic will provide an underlying database for Schiphol Airport’s flight information system. The platform will feature real-time data on the logistical activities of departing and arriving aircraft, parking spaces and ground movements.\n\nThe airport will share the data in real-time with sector parties and passengers through the website, app and terminal information screens.\n\nThe data platform’s performance and capabilities will contribute in realising the airport’s Enabling Technology Outlook strategy, which seeks to make its technological foundation future-proof.\n\nThe multi-model character of MarkLogic’s technology will allow the airport to develop new architectures on the same database in the future.\n\nMarkLogic said its data platform ensures granular data protection and supports users with assigned roles and privileges by confirming the user’s rights prior to enabling access.\n\nRoyal Schiphol Group technology lead Arie van der Veek said: “In our flight information systems, data from various Schiphol partners are combined in one central environment.\n\n“With MarkLogic’s data security capabilities, we expect a reduction in the complexity of our software and an increase in flexibility. This is also in line with our Enabling Technology strategy.”\n\nFor synergy between technology suppliers, Schiphol Airport asked MarkLogic to run as a clustered database on the Red Hat OpenShift container platform, ensuring supplier support.\n\nMarkLogic chief strategy officer for manufacturing Matt Turner said: “Our technology will enable Schiphol’s growth and modernisation plans as it delivers a better experience for everyone, including service providers.”\n\nAmsterdam Schiphol Airport, which employs about 67,000 people, welcomed 71 million passengers last year and carried 1.7 million tonnes of cargo. It has 327 direct destinations around the world.\n\nSchiphol recently launched a trial to predict waiting times at security control in Departure Hall 1. The predicted information is part of a personalised itinerary offered to passengers."
