These triples are constructed by substituting variables in a set of triple templates to create new triples from existing triples.\n\nDESCRIBE Queries - A SPARQL DESCRIBE query returns a sequence of sem:triple values as an RDF graph that describes the resources found.\n\nASK Queries - A SPARQL ASK query returns a boolean (true or false) indicating whether a query pattern matches the dataset.\n\nQ12. How to execute a SPARQL Query in Query Console?\n\nAns\n\nTo execute a SPARQL query:\n\nIn a Web browser, navigate to the Query Console:\n\nhttp://hostname:8000/qconsole\n\nwhere hostname is the name of your MarkLogic Server host.\n\nFrom the Query Type drop-down list, select SPARQL Query.\n\nThe Query Console supports syntax highlighting for SPARQL keywords.\n\nConstruct your SPARQL query.
