Until you apply for and are approved for an Account, your access to the Services will be limited to those areas of the Services, if any, that Knowi makes available to the general public. You agree and represent that all registration information you provide is accurate, complete, and current, and that you will update it promptly when that information changes. Knowi may withdraw Account approval at any time in its sole discretion, with or without cause.

However, even if you opt-out, you understand that we may continue to provide you with required information by e-mail at the address you specified when you signed up for the Services or via access to a website that we identify. Notices we e-mail to you will be deemed given and received when the e-mail is sent. If you don't agree to receive required notices via e-mail, you must stop using the Services. If you provide Knowi with legal notices, you must transmit it to us via email to legal@cloud9charts.com. Any such notice, in either case, must specifically reference that it is a notice given under these Terms.\n\nNotices from You regarding Unauthorized Use.\n\nYou agree to notify us promptly in writing when you become aware of any unauthorized use of an Account, the Content or the Services, including if you suspect there has been any loss, theft or other security breach of your password or user ID. If there is an unauthorized use by a third party which obtained access to the Services through you or your Users, whether directly or indirectly, you agree to take all steps necessary to terminate the unauthorized use. You also agree to provide Knowi with any cooperation and assistance related to that unauthorized use which we reasonably request.\n\nContent.\n\nKnowi does not monitor any data transmitted or processed hrough, or stored in, the Services. You agree that you:\n\nare responsible for the accuracy and quality of all Content that is transmitted or processed through, or stored in, your Account;\n\nwill ensure that the Content (including its storage and transmission) complies with these Terms, and applicable laws and regulations;\n\nwill promptly handle and resolve any notices and claims from a third party claiming that any Content violates that party's rights, including regarding take-down notices pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act;\n\nwill maintain appropriate security, protection and backup copies of the Content, which may include (A) the use of encryption technology to protect the Content from unauthorized access and (B) routine archiving of the Content. Knowi will have no liability of any kind as a result of any deletion, loss, correction, or destruction of Content or damage to or failure to store or encrypt any Content.\n\nUse Restrictions.\n\nYou are responsible for Users' compliance with these Terms and for the quality, accuracy and legality of the Content. You will not, and will ensure that your Users do not\n\nuse the Services in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by these Terms including, without limitation, allowing Power Users to use the logins of your Business Partner Users;\n\nsell, rent, resell, lease, or sublicense the Services to any third party;\n\nmodify, tamper with or otherwise create derivative works of the Services;\n\nreverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the Services, or attempt to derive source code from the Services;\n\nremove, obscure or alter any proprietary right notice related to the Services;\n\nuse the Services to send unsolicited or unauthorized junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes or any other form of duplicative or unsolicited messages;\n\nstore or transmit Content: (A) containing unlawful, defamatory, threatening, pornographic, abusive, or libelous material, (B) containing any material that encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense, or (C) that violates the intellectual property rights or rights to the publicity or privacy of others;\n\nuse the Services to store or transmit viruses, worms, time bombs, Trojan horses or other harmful or malicious code, files, scripts, agents or programs;\n\ninterfere with or disrupt servers or networks connected to the Services or the access by other Knowi client to the servers or networks, or violate the regulations, policies or procedures of those networks;\n\naccess or attempt to access Knowi's other accounts, computer systems or networks not covered by these Terms, through password mining or any other means; or\n\naccess or use the Services in a way intended to avoid incurring fees, exceeding usage limits and the like.\n\nThird Party Services and Content.\n\nAll transactions using the Services are between the transacting parties only. The Services may contain features and functionalities linking or providing you with certain functionality and access to third party content, including Web sites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, and the Internet as a whole. You acknowledge that Knowi is not responsible for such content or services. We may also provide some content to you as part of the Services. However, Knowi is neither an agent of any transacting party nor a direct party in any such transaction. Any of those activities, and any terms associated with those activities, are solely between you and the applicable third-party. Similarly, we are not responsible for any third party content you access with the Services, and you irrevocably waive any claim against Knowi with respect to such sites and third-party content. Knowi has no liability, obligation or responsibility for any such correspondence, purchase or promotion between Customer and any such third-party. You are solely responsible for making whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any of these third parties and your dealings with any third party related to the Services, whether online or offline, including the delivery of and payment for goods and services. In the event you have any problems resulting from your use of a third party service, or suffer data loss or other losses as a result of problems with any of your other service providers or any third-party services, we are not responsible unless the problem was the direct result of our breaches.\n\nFees.\n\nYou agree to pay, using a valid credit card (or other form of payment which we may accept from time to time), the charges and fees (such as recurring monthly or annual fees) set forth in Schedule A, Taxes (as defined below), and other charges and fees incurred in order to access the Services. You will pay Fees in the currency we quoted for your account (and we reserve the right to change the quoted currency at any time). We will automatically charge your credit card or other account at the start of the billing period and at the start of each renewal period. Except as specifically set forth in this section, all Services are prepaid for the period selected (monthly, annually or otherwise) and are non-refundable. This includes accounts that are renewed.\n\nFees for Upgrade.\n\nIf you upgrade or expand consumption of the Services , additional fees may be due at Knowi's then-current pricing. If additional fees are due, those fees will be immediately charged to your credit card or other account and will apply for the entire month in which the Services Upgrade occurred. If you have paid for an annual period, Services Upgrades will be coterminous with the affected Services period.\n\nFee Increases.\n\nWe will notify you in advance, either through a posting on this Website or by email to the address you have most recently provided to us, if we increase Fees or institute new charges or fees. Any increase in Fees will take effect at the beginning of the next renewal subscription term for the Services. For example, if you pay monthly, your use of the Services will be charged at the new price when Services are renewed in the month that follows the notice. If you don't agree to these changes, you must cancel and stop using the Services.\n\nInvoicing and Payment Terms.\n\nYou agree to keep all information in your billing account current. You may change your payment method or modify your billing account information at any time by using the means provided on the Website. Your notice to us will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we reasonably could act on your request. In the event that we invoice you, then all fees will be due and payable upon receipt. We reserve the right to charge, and you agree to pay, a late fee on past due amounts. The late fee will be equal to the lesser of 1.5% of the unpaid amount each month or the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. We may use a third party to collect past due amounts. You must pay for all reasonable costs we incur to collect any past due amounts, including reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal fees and costs. In addition, we may suspend your access to the Services, or cancel the Services, if your account is past due.\n\nTaxes.\n\nFees are exclusive of Taxes and you will pay or reimburse Knowi for all Taxes arising out of these Terms, whether assessed at the time of your purchase or are thereafter determined to have been due. For purposes of these Terms, \"Taxes\" means any sales, use and other taxes (other than taxes on Knowi's income), export and import fees, customs duties and similar charges applicable to the transactions contemplated by these Terms that are imposed by any government or other authority. You agree to promptly provide Knowi with legally sufficient tax exemption certificates for each taxing jurisdiction for which you claim exemption.\n\nDescription of Confidential Information.\n\nIn connection with each party's rights and obligations under these Terms, each party (as the \"disclosing party\") may disclose to the other party (as the \"recipient\") certain of its confidential or proprietary information (\"Confidential Information\"). In the case of Knowi, the Services, these Terms and any other proprietary or confidential information we provide to you constitute Knowi Confidential Information. In the case of Customer, Content provided to Knowi by Customer constitutes Customer Confidential Information.\n\nProtection of Confidential Information.\n\nEach party as recipient agrees: (i) to exercise at least the same degree of care to safeguard Confidential Information of the disclosing party as the recipient exercises to safeguard the confidentiality of its own confidential information, but not less than reasonable care; (ii) to use the disclosing party's Confidential Information only in connection with exercising its rights and performing its obligations under these Terms; and (iii) to not disclose or disseminate the disclosing party's Confidential Information to any third party and that the only employees and contractors who will have access to the disclosing party's Confidential Information will be those with a need to know who have agreed to abide by the obligations set forth in this Section pursuant to a written confidentiality agreement.\n\nProtection of Content.\n\nWe agree to maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the Content. The third party data center providers utilized by Knowi in the provision of the Services will maintain at a minimum SSAE 16 audit certification or its equivalent. Except as requested by you in connection with customer support, we will not (i) modify Content, (ii) disclose Content except pursuant to the requirements of a governmental agency, by operation of law, to investigate occurrences that may involve violations of system or network security, or as you expressly permit in writing, or (iii) access Content except to provide the Services or to address other service or technical problems.\n\n>Exceptions to Confidentiality.\n\nInformation will not be deemed Confidential Information of either of us under these Terms if such information: (i) is or becomes rightfully known to the recipient without any obligation of confidentiality or breach of these Terms; (ii) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be secret or confidential, except through a breach of these Terms by the recipient of such Confidential Information; or (iii) is independently developed by the recipient of such Confidential Information without breach of these Terms. Confidential Information will remain the property of the disclosing party.\n\nGeneral.\n\nKnowi reserves the right to temporarily suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time in Knowi's sole discretion, with or without cause, and with or without notice, without incurring liability of any kind. For example, we may suspend or terminate your access to or use of the Services for: (i) the actual or suspected violation of these Terms; (ii) the use of the Services in a manner that may cause Knowi to have legal liability or disrupt others' use of the Services; (iii) the suspicion or detection of any malicious code, virus or other harmful code in your Account; (iv) downtime, whether scheduled or recurring; (e) your use of excessive storage capacity or bandwidth; or (v) unplanned technical problems and outages. If, in our determination, the suspension might be indefinite or we have elected to terminate your access to the Services, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you through the Services. You acknowledge that if your access to the Services is suspended or terminated, you may no longer have access to the Content that is stored with the Services.\n\nTermination for Lack of Activity.\n\nIn addition to our other rights of termination, if your Account is not currently subject to a paid subscription plan with us, we may terminate your Account if: (i) you do not engage in any activity in the Account within 30 days after registering for the Services, or (ii) you do not engage in any activity in an Account for 120 consecutive days. In the event of such termination, any of your Content may be lost.\n\nPost-Termination Obligations.\n\nUpon termination of these Terms for any reason, all of your rights to use or access the Services will cease. You agree, within five days of such termination, to destroy all copies of the Software, the Documentation, and any Confidential Information of Knowi, including any Documentation in written or electronic form and any Software stored on your servers or other systems. In addition, if requested by Knowi, you will promptly provide to Knowi a written certification signed by an authorized representative certifying that all copies of the Software and any written or electronic documentation and Confidential Information of Knowi have been destroyed. For 30 days following the expiration of the Termination of these Terms or the applicable subscription term for which you have paid, and subject to your prior written request, we will grant you with limited access to the Services solely for purposes of your retrieval of the Content. After that 30-day period, Knowi has no further obligation to maintain the Content and will delete the Content unless legally prohibited.\n\nSurvival.\n\nThe terms of any sections that by their nature are intended to extend beyond termination will survive termination of these Terms for any reason.\n\nGoverning Law.\n\nThese Terms will be construed and enforced in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to its choice of law rules. Any dispute between the parties will be brought in a court in Alameda County and each party irrevocably waives any claim that such court does not have personal jurisdiction over the party. All use of the Services is expressly governed by any applicable export and import laws, and Customer must comply with all such laws. Claims arising out or related to these terms must be filed within one year of the date on which the claim arose unless local law requires a longer time to file claims. If a claim is not filed accordingly, then it is permanently barred.\n\nGovernment Users.\n\nIf you are a U.S. government entity, you acknowledge that any Software and Documentation are provided as \"Commercial Items\" as defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, and are being licensed to U.S. government end users as commercial computer software subject to the restricted rights described in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212.\n\nIndependent Contractors; Third Party Beneficiaries.\n\nYou and we are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, employment relationship or agency. There are no third-party beneficiaries of these Terms. Knowi may subcontract portions of the Services provided that Knowi shall remain responsible for all such obligations under these Terms.\n\nWaiver.\n\nOur failure to enforce any of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of the right to enforce them. Our rights under these Terms will survive any termination.\n\nAssignment.\n\nYou may not assign these Terms or your rights and obligations under them, in whole or in part, to any third party without our prior written consent, and any attempt by you to do so will be invalid.\n\nSeverability.\n\nShould any part of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.\n\nForce Majeure.\n\nNeither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under these Terms (excluding payment obligations) if the delay or failure arises from any cause or causes beyond that party's reasonable control.\n\nPublic Announcement.\n\nKnowi reserves the right to release a press announcement regarding the parties' relationship, and to include Customer's name on Knowi's customer lists on Knowi's web site and in any other marketing materials.\n\nEntire Agreement and Changes.\n\nThese Terms, including fees for Services on the Website, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof. Knowi reserves the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time in its sole discretion. Knowi will indicate at the top of these Terms the date these Terms were last updated. Any changes will be effective upon posting the revised version of these Terms on the Services (or such later effective date as may be indicated at the top of the revised Terms). Customer's continued access or use of any portion of the Services constitutes Customer's acceptance of such changes. If Customer doesn't agree to any of the changes, Customer must cancel and stop using the Services.\n\nPrivacy.\n\nIn order to operate and provide the Services, Knowi collect certain information about Customer. As part of the Services, Knowi may also automatically upload information about Customer's computer or other device, Customer's use of the Services, and the Services performance. Knowi will use and protect that information as described in the privacy policy located on the Website (\"Privacy Policy\"). Customer further acknowledges and agrees that Knowi may access or disclose information about Customer, including the content of Customer communications, in order to: (i) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (ii) protect the rights or property of Knowi or Knowi's customers, including the enforcement of Knowi's agreements or policies governing Customer's use of the Services; or (iii) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Knowi employees, customers, or the public.\n\nDMCA.\n\nWe respect the intellectual property of others, and reserve the right to delete or disable Content that appears to violate these terms or applicable law. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the \"DMCA\") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that Content infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the Content be removed or access to it blocked. Federal law requires that your notification include the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail; (v) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
