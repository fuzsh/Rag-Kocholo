        "text": "MarkLogic is an operational and transactional Enterprise NoSQL database platform trusted by global organizations to integrate their most critical data. Designed to integrate data from silos better, faster, and with less cost, MarkLogic can help you integrate data and build your 360-degree view up to four times faster than if using a traditional database. And, you don’t have to sacrifice any of the enterprise features required for storing and managing mission-critical data.\n\nMarkLogic Database Overview: One Database. Endless Possibilities.\n\nMarkLogic is a database designed for NoSQL speed and scale, without sacrificing the enterprise features required to run mission-critical, operational applications. Using a multi-model approach, MarkLogic provides unprecedented flexibility to integrate and store all of your most critical data, and then view that data as documents, as a graph, or as relational data. You can avoid expensive and brittle ETL and better manage the entities and relationships that your business works with.\n\nWhy Multi-Model?\n\nTo bridge data silos, data management means being able to deal with heterogeneous, multi-shaped, multi-formatted data. Because MarkLogic at its core is a document database, the most flexible of NoSQL databases, it easily loads that multi-shaped data without upfront modeling. Additionally, MarkLogic lets you make associations between documents using triples. So triples, documents, and data — that’s what it means by multi-model.\n\nKey Capabilities: Enterprise Ready. Set. Go!\n\nEasy to Get Data in: Ingest structured and unstructured data as is with a Flexible Data Model that adapts to both changing data and changing data structure. MarkLogic natively stores JSON, XML, text, geospatial, and semantic triples.\n\nEasy to Get Data out: The database has built-in, lightning-fast search capabilities with an “Ask Anything” Universal Index. MarkLogic also provides APIs and other tools to enable fast application development and deployment to any environment.\n\nTrusted To Run Your Business: MarkLogic is enterprise-ready, having ACID transactions, scalability and elasticity, certified security, high availability, and disaster recovery — plus other enterprise features required to run critical business operations.\n\nMarkLogic Consulting Services: Expert Consulting Within Reach\n\nMarkLogic Consulting Services puts an exceptional focus on customer success. With vast experience solving big data challenges for some of the world’s most complex data projects, MarkLogic is committed to helping you scope and select the best application of MarkLogic technology.

They’re educated on the latest product features and the product roadmap for future releases. They work closely with Product Management, Support, and Engineering teams to maintain an exceptional focus on customer success.\n\nLow-Risk Approach\n\nThe MarkLogic Quick Start Service provides a low-risk approach to kick off your innovative, next-generation information application. This program makes it easy for you to evaluate MarkLogic’s capabilities and strengths through a working pilot that’s focused on ensuring repeatable success developing a working application with best-practice architecture.\n\nTestimonials\n\n“At the start of this project, we called that middle box (the MarkLogic piece) the Conversion Hub because we’re Oracle-based and we wanted to create a place where people could look at the data before it gets ported back over to Oracle. In that process, we got confidence with MarkLogic and said, ‘You know what? We’re grooming this data so let’s stand it up here and let’s write our application around that’ and that became the sales to finance hub with MarkLogic.”\n\nRob Maxwell, Vice President, Worldwide It, Sony Pictures Entertainment\n\n“Our legacy system took up to 30 minutes or an hour sometimes [to publish a video clip]. We compared the MarkLogic NoSQL technology to some SQL vendors, and what we got in 20 seconds on SQL took us 200 milliseconds in NoSQL — orders of magnitude faster. So we said let’s move iPlayer to this.”\n\nAllan Donald, Senior Product Manager for Editorial Metadata, BBC\n\nGreet the Leader\n\nGary Bloom, Chief Executive Officer, and President: Calling upon his extensive executive experience at Oracle and Veritas, Gary Bloom leads MarkLogic as the preeminent NoSQL database for the enterprise. Throughout his 14-year tenure as a senior Oracle executive, Gary helped organizations make the generational shift from mainframe to relational technology – the perfect experience to enable him to assist organizations today in the transformation from relational to next-generation database technology.\n\nGary earned a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo."
