        "text": "This article is part of a series, the other parts can be found at the bottom of the article\n\nAn introduction to MarkLogic, unstructured agile information management\n\nIt has been half a year since I started at MarkLogic and during that period the question I got asked the most from friends and family is; \"what is it exactly that MarkLogic does?\". MarkLogic can be a lot of things and every time I found myself taking a different avenue when explaining it, not really adding to the clarity about what it is that MarkLogic does. Therefor I decided to write a couple of short articles explaining what it is that MarkLogic does, what makes it unique and what makes me such a fan. To help the people around me understand what MarkLogic is and maybe also a little bit to organize my own thoughts around what it is that I see in MarkLogic. After putting this to paper and rewriting and re-structuring it - a lot -, I ended up with comparing several concepts that exist in, amongst other places, information management. Concepts like Unstructured vs Relational, Agile vs Waterfall and All-in-one vs Best-of-breed. Once it is clear where MarkLogic stands in all of these, I have created a little extra context around the key concepts in MarkLogic, security, multi-model, semantics, metadata, applications services, indexing and search.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nMarkLogic is a Not only SQL Enterprise Multi Model Database. I am smiling while writing this because I know many people will read this and think about throwing in the towel on this entire article. But trust me, at the end of the series, you will see the same sentence and understand exactly what it means. To understand what MarkLogic is we have to go back to when it all began. All the way back to 2001 when terrorist attacks in the US laid bare an information sharing issue in US intelligence. After 9/11 the US government tasked the intelligence community to find a better way to share information. Several great minds were approached, amongst them MarkLogic founder Christopher Lindblad, at that time working for one of the early internet search engines. Christopher believed that the solution was a combination of a search engine, a database for unstructured information and an application server. His employer at that time did not want to pursue it, therefor Christopher decided to go out on his own and build it. Now this is where most people I am trying to explain MarkLogic to, start zoning out, because I have lost them at the “database for unstructured information” part, so let's start with that.\n\nGrocery shopping (Unstructured vs Relational)\n\nIt is a Saturday afternoon and you receive a message in one of your Whatsapp groups with friends, \"anybody up for hanging out tonight?\". That is perfect, you had nothing else planned and you would have probably ended up just watching some Louis Theroux documentaries in your onesie, so you welcome the opportunity to mingle with a fun group of people. You respond right away \"YES! 20:00 at my place!!\". The moment you hit send, you realize that your quiet afternoon of doing nothing is now also shot. Your fridge is entirely empty and your friends are going to expect to have a beer when hanging out, so off to the store you go. At the store you head straight to the isle with beers and you are ready to buy some Heineken. Now, like many other brands, Heineken has thought of a very convenient way of carrying your beers home, a beer crate. A typical beer crate has 4 rows and 6 columns (or 6 rows and 4 columns, depending on how you hold it). Each cell in the crate is perfectly dimensioned to hold 1 beer bottle, with just enough space to easily slide in and out but not so much space that they are bouncing around when you transport your beers home. A pretty perfect solution you might think when you look at the purpose it was built for. Having this little internal realization, that you are in the presence of such a great invention, gives you a tingle inside as you start walking towards the register.\n\nBut then you realize that there will be people that want something else to drink. That means a quick detour through the soda isle. You grab a bottle of coke and a carton of iced tea and put them on top of your beer crate. Look at yourself, creating new purposes for the already brilliant beer crate! While you are at it, you might as well grab some chips and maybe some sweets. Slowly you start creating a pretty big unstable pile on top of your beer crate. While you are balancing your big pile your phone buzzes and with some effort you look at your watch to read what is coming in. 2 Friends seize the opportunity of not having to cook and will come early and stay for dinner. Okay, no worries, another little detour through the isle with frozen pizzas and you grab a couple of those as well. But no way that those will also fit on top of the pile. You slowly start thinking, there must be a better solution than piling all these things on top of your crate, at which point you tilt the crate a little and everything starts moving, before you know it all of your groceries are sliding through the isle…\n\nJust when you think there is no more hope, you spot a shopping crate at the checkout. Eureka! You put your soda's, chips, sweets and pizza into the shopping crate and there is even room left to put a 12 pack twist cap Heineken in, that is a more convenient amount of beers and it will save you the trouble of having to return a beer crate next time you go to the store. You say goodbye to the beer crate, thank it for its service and enter into a new life of convenience!\n\nThat was quite an introduction to explain unstructured versus relational, but we can be really quick about it now. Imagine the beer crate is a relational database, it is a great invention if you want to store information that the relational database is built for. Information that lets itself be put into rows and columns (like an Excel sheet). Real life information however does not come in the form of rows and columns, it comes in the form of documents, emails, texts, relationships, etcetera. You can try putting those on top of your beer crate, but that means you are abusing the beer crate, not using it for the purpose it was built for, leading to bad performance and a lot of bespoke solutioning. Alternatively, you can go back to Heineken and ask them to create a new beer crate that has special boxes for soda, chips, sweets and pizza or go to Lays and ask them to design chips bags in the form of a beer bottle. Heineken and Lays will probably charge you a lot of money and what happens if next time you also need to pick up some garbage bags? This last part is what we see in the database world as an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process. It is a costly and inflexible way to change a set of information to fit in the relational model.\n\nNow imagine that the shopping crate is an unstructured database, like MarkLogic. Whatever you decide to buy in the grocery store, will fit in the shopping create. You can put all your groceries for today in it and whatever you decide to buy tomorrow. In an unstructured database you load all your real-life information as you have or receive it. This gives you a lot of speed and agility in your information management. How unstructured database came to be I will explain in my next post where I will cover agile vs waterfall information management.\n\nThe concepts I am discussing in these articles are simplified representations of comprehensive subjects.
