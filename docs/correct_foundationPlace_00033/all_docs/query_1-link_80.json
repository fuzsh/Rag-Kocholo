        "text": "SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MarkLogic Corporation, the next generation data platform provider for simplifying data integration, today announced the MarkLogic® Pharma Research Hub to enable pharmaceutical companies to lower drug trial costs and accelerate research. This is achieved by helping researchers quickly and easily find, synthesize and share high-quality data – including, genetic, proteomic, drug, textual, binary and clinical trial data – within a single cloud service.\n\nThe MarkLogic Pharma Research Hub uses machine learning and other advanced technologies including semantics, fuzzy matching, relevance ranking and rich metadata to manage, organize and retrieve information. As a fully managed cloud service, the Pharma Research Hub can be set up in minutes and ingests data 10x faster than custom-developed solutions – with zero IT management burden.\n\n“Researchers using legacy technology only access slivers of the data around them, increasing the likelihood of errors and costing valuable time that can equate to hundreds of millions of lost dollars and, more importantly, lost opportunities to change lives because drugs take so long to develop,” said Bill Fox, Vice President of Vertical Strategy Group and Chief Strategy Officer of Healthcare and Life Sciences at MarkLogic. “We offer researchers a cloud-based service to easily bring together massive amounts of data, in its original form, and understand the relationships between all that data, so they can use that data to discover life-changing drugs faster.”\n\nBy working with five of the largest global pharmaceutical companies and other leaders in the healthcare ecosystem, MarkLogic has long used its Data Hub technology to help solve pharmaceutical companies’ business and data challenges by:\n\nEnabling search and visualization of relationships: View, navigate, and search the graph of connections in data by leveraging all inherent relationships. Visualizing these relationships in data, such as how a researcher is connected to institutions and peers, or how a gene, drug target and metabolic pathway are related, can lead to faster discoveries.\n\nLeveraging machine learning: Users get better search results on higher quality data. MarkLogic’s Smart Mastering feature uses machine learning to find and consolidate related and duplicate items and to construct a knowledge graph of all data. Data quality rules are applied as data is loaded. This high-quality, mastered data dramatically improves search results and enables better downstream bioinformatics and AI analysis.\n\nLoading any pharma data set: The Pharma Research Hub allows loading of any pharmaceutical information – publications, authors, drugs, genes and more – so companies can quickly access consolidated information to perform research.\n\n“Due to advances in technology that solve many data analytics challenges while also meeting the stringent regulatory requirements of the health industry, we expect substantial data management solution adoption in life science research R&D,” said Alan Louie, Life Sciences Research Director at IDC. “This new breed of industry-centric technology promises significant near-term value while also creating new best practices that will drive the industry forward for decades to come.”\n\nThe Pharma Research Hub standardizes and extends the best practices from multiple customers. The underlying MarkLogic Data Hub Platform has been used to run some of the most complex businesses for nearly two decades. The platform is built for Petabytes but can also be cost-effectively scoped to small data sets. It is governed and secure from the beginning unlike data stored in a Hadoop® data lake, which can take years to build while the business waits for results.\n\nMore information on the MarkLogic Pharma Research Hub is available here.\n\nAbout MarkLogic\n\nData integration is one of the most complex IT challenges, and our mission is to simplify it. The MarkLogic Data Hub is a highly differentiated data platform that eliminates friction at every step of the data integration process, enabling organizations to achieve a 360º view faster than ever. By simplifying data integration, MarkLogic helps organizations gain agility, lower IT costs, and safely share their data.\n\nOrganizations around the world trust MarkLogic to handle their mission-critical data, including 6 of the top 10 banks, 5 of the largest global pharmaceutical companies, 6 of the top 10 publishers, 9 of the 15 major U.S. government agencies, and many more. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, MarkLogic has offices throughout the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. For more information visit www.marklogic.com.\n\n© 2019 MarkLogic Corporation.
