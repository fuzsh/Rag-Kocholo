        "text": "It doesn't have to be a binary either/or choice. You can use JavaScript AND XQuery (and XSLT) modules.\n\nWhich language to use is largely influenced by your own preference, as well as the type of data you are mostly working with. There are pros and cons for either language, but in terms of APIs and functionality there is almost complete parity.\n\nIf you are already familiar with JavaScript and proficient, then you may find it easier and more approachable.\n\nXQuery is not as widely known or popular these days, so it is harder to find developers that are already proficient. It may take a while to get familiar with the syntax and understand what a FLWOR and sequences are.\n\nIf you have a lot of XML documents, then XQuery and XSLT would be the natural choice. Building and manipulating XML in JavaScript is kind of awful, in my opinion.\n\nBecause the JavaScript API sits on top of the V8 engine, and XQuery is native code, there are some performance differences. For instance, making a call to a MarkLogic built-in function from JavaScript is slower than if it were done in an XQuery module."
