        "text": "Khalid Ahmed\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMarkLogic brings all the features you need into one unified system as it is the only Enterprise NoSQL database. MarkLogic can bring multiple heterogeneous data sources into a single platform architecture, allowing for homogenous data access. For bringing the data we need to insert the documents. On the query console, we are able to perform the query according to requirements.\n\nBringing in the documents\n\nThere are many ways to insert documents into a MarkLogic database. Available interfaces include:\n\nMarkLogic Data Hub\n\nMarkLogic Content Pump\n\nApache Nifi\n\nREST API\n\nXQuery functions\n\nMuleSoft\n\nData Movement SDK (Java API)\n\nNode.js API\n\nJavaScript functions\n\nApache Kafka\n\nContent Processing Framework\n\nXCC\n\nWebDAV\n\nExplanation of available interfaces\n\nMarkLogic Data Hub: The MarkLogic Data Hub is open-source software that is used to inject data from different sources or from multiple sources. It is used to import the data as well as harmonize the data.\n\nMarkLogic Content Pump: It is a command line tool for bulk loading billions of documents into a MarkLogic database, extracting or copying the content. It helps us to make workflow integration very easy.\n\nApache Nifi: It is useful when someone needs to ingest data from a relational database into a MarkLogic Database.\n\nREST API: It provides a programming language agnostic way to write a document in MarkLogic.\n\nXQuery functions: When we want to write the document to a MarkLogic database then this function is used. Able to write the records from the query console or from the XQuery application.\n\nMuleSoft: The Marklogic connector for MuleSoft is Used to bring data from various other systems into the MarkLogic database.\n\nAvailable Interfaces\n\nData Movement SDK (Java API): Included in the java API, the data movement SDK provides the classes for java developers to use to import and transform documents.\n\nNode.js API: It provides Node.js classes for the developers to use to write the document to a MarkLogic database from their Node.js code.\n\nJavaScript functions: Able to write the document through the query console or by using the javascript application.\n\nApache Kafka: When we need to stream the data into the database, we can do it by using the Kafka MarkLogic connector.\n\nContent Processing Framework: A Pipeline framework for making changes to documents as they are being loaded into the database, such as enriching the data or transforming the PDF or MS office document in XML.\n\nXML Contentbase Connector (XCC): If you need to create a multi-tier application that communicates with the MarkLogic then it is useful.\n\nWebDAV: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning used to drag and drop the documents in the Marklogic Database.\n\nInserting the document using the Query Console\n\nTo insert the document using the query console javaScript or XQuery used. The xdmp.documentLoad() function. Used to load the document from the file system into a database.\n\ndeclareupdate();\n\nxdmp.documentLoad(\"path of the source file\")\n\nRunning a JavaScript expression that makes changes to a database. Need to use the declareUpdate function.\n\nThe xdmp.documentinsert() function is used to write a document into a database.\n\ndeclareUpdate();\n\nxdmp.documentInsert('/employee1.json',\n\n{\n\n'title : 'Knoldus' ,\n\n'description': 'Amazing place to work'\n\n});\n\nUniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n\nTo address any document in a MarkLogic database, it is necessary that each document has a unique URI.\n\n/products/1.json\n\nThe URI does not refer to the physical location of a document in a database. Provides a unique name for referencing the document.\n\nDeleting the documents\n\nThe clear button in the admin interface can be used to delete all the documents in a database.\n\nTo delete an individual document, the xdmp.documentDelete() function can be used.\n\ndeclareUpdate();\n\nxdmp.documentDelete('/employee1.json');\n\nAccessing a Document\n\nTo read a document in a database, use the cts.doc().\n\ncts.doc('/employee1.json);\n\nModifying Documents\n\nDocuments can be modified via various APIS and tools, including data hub, JavaScript, XQuery, etc.\n\nJavaScript functions for updating documents include:\n\nxdmp.nodeReplace()\n\nxdmp.nodeInsert()\n\nxdmp.nodeInsertBefore()\n\nxdmp.nodeInsertAfter()\n\nxdmp.nodeDelete()\n\nConclusion\n\nMarkLogic is a NoSql database with many facilities and if someone wants to insert the data then this blog is helpful. After insertion needs to access and modify the document by using some predefined functions.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://docs.marklogic.com/guide/ingestion/intro\n\nhttps://docs.marklogic.com/guide/concepts/data-management\n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/marklogic-fundamentals/learn/lecture/4793940#overview\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSuggested Article\n\nKhalid Ahmed"
