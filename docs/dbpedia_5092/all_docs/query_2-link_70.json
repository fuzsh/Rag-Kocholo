        "text": "Rankings of golfers are based on numbers. But rankings of golf movies? Not so much.\n\nType the key words into Google, and you come across a zillion purportedly authoritative lists of the “greatest golf movies” ever made, all of them rooted in . . .one writer’s opinion.\n\nEnough with the subjective sleight of hand!\n\nIn the spirit of hard science, we dived into the data.\n\nWhich is to say, we studied the film review website Rotten Tomatoes, which assigns numerical values to movies of all genres by aggregating the assessments of professional and amateur critics alike. Here, according to real live movie fans, is an absolutely, positively definitive ranking of the 13 best (and, err, not best) golf movies of all time — well, at least until the next ranking is published!\n\nNote: The audience score is the percent of users who gave the film at least 3.5 stars or better (out of 5).\n\n13. Caddyshack II (1988)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 18 percent\n\nMovies are like tee shots. No need for a second when you do the first one right. In this case, the filmmakers smoked the opener down the middle, then took a mulligan and look what happened: the cinematic version of a shank.\n\nT11. Blades (1989)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 38 percent\n\nIt’s hard to say which is more terrifying: a movie script about a demonically possessed lawnmower that turns a country club into its hunting grounds, or the fact that this film got made.\n\nT11. Spring Fever (1927)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 38 percent\n\nQuiet on the set! Believed to be the first golf feature film ever made, this comedy of class and manners is also a silent movie. It prompted mostly crickets from the Rotten Tomatoes crowd.\n\n10. Golf in the Kingdom (2011)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 39 percent\n\nIn golf, one reviewer wrote, “it takes a long time for not much to happen. By that standard, (the movie) captures the game perfectly.” Ouch.\n\n9. Who’s Your Caddy? (2007)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 59 percent\n\nWhen a rap mogul tries to join an uppity Atlanta country club, he gets pushback from the club president — but nothing like the resistance this film received from some Rotten Tomatoes reviewers.\n\nT7. The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 65 percent\n\nOf this Depression-era period piece about an enigmatic figure named Bagger Vance who coaxes a has-been golfer back to greatness, some Rotten Tomatoes raters bemoaned the film’s slow start. But largely, reviewers enjoyed it. “Severely underrated,” one wrote. “This is one of those movies that make you wonder how you’ve been dealing with life and how you should be dealing with life.”\n\nT7. Tin Cup (1996)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 65 percent\n\nTry as we might, there are two things about Tin Cup we just don’t understand: Why didn’t Roy McAvoy just lay up on the 18th hole to secure victory in the U.S. Open? And, how on earth did this fine movie earn a lower rating than Happy Gilmore?\n\n6. Tommy’s Honour (2016)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 68 percent\n\nThere’s one Tommy in the title but two in the film. As in, Old and Young Tom Morris, the father-and-son duo who cut a trailblazing path through the game.\n\n5. Pat and Mike (1952)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 69 percent\n\nIn on-course rom-com starring Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, a sports manager falls hard for a talented lady golfer, just as some reviewers fell hard for the film.\n\n4. The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 82 percent\n\nThe Greatest Game Ever Played was not the greatest golf movie ever made. But it’s up there in the algorithmic rankings, something of an upstart, not unlike its subject, the underdog U.S. Open champion, Francis Ouimet.\n\n3. Happy Gilmore (1996)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 85 percent\n\nA slapstick comedy about a former hockey player with a slap-shot swing, this Adam Sandler picture tends to polarize opinions. But it is, without a doubt, the best golf flick ever made that features Bob Barker in an on-course brawl.\n\n2. Caddyshack (1980)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 87 percent\n\nWatch this comedy classic for the 100th time, and you still might not achieve total consciousness. But you will get some laughs, which (please, forgive us) is nice.\n\nAND THE PEOPLE’S CHOICE IS…\n\n1. Dead Solid Perfect (1988)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 88 percent\n\nAnd we have a winner! An engaging film, based on a Dan Jenkins novel of the same name, about a colorfully unconventional golf pro, trying to get his life — and game — in shape in advance of the U.S. Open."
