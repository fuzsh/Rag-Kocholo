        "text": "Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) returns home from war, and doesn't feel comfortable in his surroundings, or in himself.\n\nJunuh begins a mystical journey of self-discovery when local kid Hardy Graves (J. Michael Moncrief) coaxes him into competing in a golf championship, which is organized by Rannulph¿s ex-girlfriend, Adele (Charlize Theron).\n\nAs Junuh prepares for the competition, he discovers he no longer has what it takes to play the game. He¿s about to give-up, until mysterious stranger Bagger Vance (Will Smith) comes out of nowhere, offering to help Rannulph ¿find¿ his swing.\n\nJunuh is maneuvered into accepting Vance¿s offer ¿ an offer which results in Junuh discovering many subtleties about the game of golf, and many subtleties about the game of life¿\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nNone.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nAs sophisticated and glossy as TLBV is, when all is said and done, it¿s a gimmick film, predicated on the audience accepting (and running with) the conceit that human existence can be universally equated to the sport of golf. ¿A man¿s grip on his club is just like a man¿s grip on his world¿ says Will Smith¿s Bagger Vance to lost soul Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) as the latter tries to ¿find his swing¿ after many years out of the game.\n\nThere¿s no escaping the reality that you must accept such analogies for Bagger Vance to work. And, in order to fully ¿get¿ the analogies, you must have a reasonable understanding of golf. And even with a vast understanding of the sport, TLOBV hasn¿t considered its metaphors clearly enough to give them their intended meaning or resonance. Throughout the film, there seem to be the beginnings of many profound notions, but they keep getting buried beneath the movie¿s often cold nature.\n\nFor example, Smith¿s Vance speaks pointedly about one¿s ¿authentic swing¿ (or something like that) ¿ equating it to a pure moment when we do something we were meant to do without thought, effort, or concern. Presumably, this is the sporting equivalent of ¿using The Force¿ ¿ and Damon¿s struggle to do this is very much the crux of the film. But we never get a clear sense of what this means beyond the moment. We never see how Matt Damon getting on top of the way of things really matters in any way past the immediate golfing event at hand. Lip service is paid to Damon¿s becoming better able to chase the girl through honing his golf skills, etc. ¿ but the correlations are esoteric and un-defined. The film tells us Damon is changing, but it rarely shows us how he has changed inside, and Damon¿s performance is too one-note to provide much-needed insight into what the character is going through. We don't feel the arc he is travelling, we only see him going through the motions. Which makes the ¿drama¿ in Bagger Vance much like watching a golf game when you don't really understand the sport: there's a lot of standing around, waiting for something to happen. But even when something does happen, you don't really know what the hell it means.\n\nRedford¿s treatment of the subject suggests a cosmic profundity to his ¿golf = life¿ psychology ¿ but it simply doesn't echo beyond the film. Thus, it¿s really not clear what this movie is supposed to be (the journey of Junuh? The journey of character Hardy Greaves ¿ whose older incarnation is the narrator of the piece? The journey of us all?), or what we¿re supposed to carry away from it. Maybe Redford tried to do us a favor by not being too heavy-handed with the film¿s ¿point,¿ when, in reality, we might have needed to get beaten over the head with it a little bit more. Maybe Redford simply miscalculated the movie¿s sentiments ¿ or assumed because he understood it, the rest of us would. Whichever the case, there is a definite sense TLOBV is speaking to the human condition in general, but many viewers will likely not find its ¿message¿ articulated clearly enough to warrant much consideration after the fact.\n\n(l-r) Bobby Jones (Joel Gretch), Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill) face each other (and an unforgiving golf course) in DreamWorks' The Legend of Bagger Vance.\n\nBeyond its jumbled purpose, the film¿s greater weakness is ultimately what sinks it: it¿s difficult to care for any of the people on-screen. Most performers put forth valliant effort, but The Legend of Bagger Vance is often a very cold movie. Damon is solid but uncharismatic as Rannulph Junuh, the film¿s primary character. His chemistry with Charlize Theron¿s Adele (an interaction which, in many ways, should be driving the film) is non-existent. She pines and croons and cries for him when he returns to her life after a protracted absence, but we never really know why ¿ because we don't know what he was like before he left. All we see now is a stoic and self-pitying man who wouldn't seem to inspire the emotional investment she is affording him. He swings back and forth between wanting her and not wanting her ¿ but we never get a sense of how her character is affecting him, or how her presence drives his actions (which is implied throughout the movie). Much like the concerns voiced above, there's a feeling these people understand things about each other and themselves which the audience simply isn¿t privy to ¿ making TLOBV a distancing and aloof experience.\n\nSome effort to set-up these characters and their interactions is made via a protracted opening narrative, but it¿s not enough to give us any meat to chew on ¿ it¿s only enough to help us understand what the hell is happening for the rest of the movie. We needed to know these people more before we could appreciate what they¿re going through.\n\nThis criticism is inextricably entwined with the above mentioned ¿what¿s the point¿ consideration. To have trouble figuring out what a movie is trying to say is one thing. But for an audience to be uncertain as to why they should care about what the film is trying to say¿because the film¿s characterizations are too clumsy to promote any interest in the people personifying the movie¿s message¿is a deeply fundamental and devastating flaw. A flaw from which TLOBV never recovers.\n\nMichael Ballhaus¿ cinematography is crisp and enticing, although a more ¿mystical¿ look might have better accentuated the sometimes magical nature of Junuh¿s journey, and enabled Rachel Portman¿s stunning score stick-out a little bit less (its gorgeous melody lines and lyrical nature frequently seem to clash with the movie¿s less-than-atmospheric, less than magical photography). Production design by Stuart Craig is tremendous, and actors Bruce McGill and Joel Hagen deserve honorable mention for so deftly performing Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones ¿ Junuh¿s opponents in the tournament. They are, arguably, the ¿realest¿ characters in the film. [Editor's Note: this is likely because Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones were very much real people... not to mention legendary golfers. Hagen won 11 major championships in his career, including his first at the U.S. Open in which he birdied the 18th hole each round, something no champion has done before or since. Jones, who retired arguably at the peak of his career at age 28, won 13 majors, a record that would stand for over 40 years. - BZ]\n\nRedford¿s direction is, as always, technically masterful ¿ although it is frequently miscalculated, spending too much time focusing on irrelevancies at the sacrifice of cohesion and character (as mentioned above). Sometimes he seems conflicted: there's a sense he desperately wants to feed off the same surreal ¿vibe¿ which made Barry Levinson¿s The Natural (in which Redford starred) such a timeless classic, but there's also a sense he wants us to avoid any comparison between the two. Which is difficult to do, because both films treat sports as a magical, mythological experience, and both films struggle to create a sense of larger-than-life importance about things which aren¿t inherently magic and important to many people. The Natural excels at doing so, thanks in no small part to its ambiance and atmosphere. TLOBV doesn't benefit from the same advantages. No matter how hard it tries to avoid the pitfall, The Legend of Bagger Vance simply evokes its predecessor a bit too often. And, when all is said and done, it pales pitifully in comparison¿\n\n¿ Glen wonders what this movie would be like if it were set at the local Putt-Putt golf course, which has a really cool giant dinosaur on it...\n\nThe official (and embarassing) Legend of Bagger Vance website can apparently be accessed HERE.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\nNone."
