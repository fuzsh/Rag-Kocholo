Amongst others his teachers were Karlheinz Stockhausen and Ligeti. Between 1962 and 1969 he conducted numerous orchestras including his own compositions.

Between 1969 and 1978 he worked exclusively with CAN.\n\nAfter 1978 Irmin released several solo albums - Toy Planet (with B.

He is a musical alchemist. The unusual paths Schmidt choses for his compositions were celebrated in 2010, when the prestigious Festival Ludwigsburger Schlossfestspiele presented a gala evening in his honor. Schmidt conducted the Orchestra of the Schlossfestspiele and presented a selection of his work to great critical acclaim.\n\nIn 2012 the CAN Label Spoon Records released The Lost Tapes, a 3 CD Can Box of previously unreleased Can material curated by Irmin Schmidt.

(Sounds Of Urbanity).\n\nWhat does music have to sound regarding sustainability, the new food movements, healthy and sustainable nutrition and lifestyles? (Organic Food Sounds). How do you create a sound image that depicts the regions of the world in a new and timeless way?\n\nWithout all the clich√©s and stereotypes, but with the by integrating the traditional sounds of the regions concerned.\n\nWhat are new alpine sounds? What is the new sound for stories in today's alpine region (including Southern Germany, Austria,\n\nSwitzerland, Slovenia and the north of Italy and France).\n\nCreating sounds that make the colours ring. And much more.\n\nAnother important motto: Modern Modular Motif-based Production Music.\n\nThe goal are minimal and modular structured mood tracks, which have unique and modern sounds as core element and thus on the one hand perfectly underscore fitting and not overloaded but on the other hand have strong motif expressiveness.\n\nFor each track there are several variations, which may differ in instrumentation of the motif, tempo, time signature etc., but which play around the central element (the leitmotif) in some form.\n\nAnd all this under the aspect of making it as close, touching, high quality and timeless as possible for all kinds of audio-visual productions and suitable for stories in the here and now.\n\nAlthough music is his life, he never learned to play an instrument well. He spent a few years as a drummer, but never really gained a foothold as a musician.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of it, he has immersed himself {associatively}, in what kind of images does music create, which images need which music. He finds the exploration of music exciting. And he has immersed himself in it.\n\nHe also sees himself as a diver for musical pearls in the playlists of Tonangeber. He curates and mixes them together.\n\nBACK\n\nMirjam Skal\n\nComposer and orchestrator\n\nMirjam Skal is a composer and orchestrator based in Zurich, Switzerland.
