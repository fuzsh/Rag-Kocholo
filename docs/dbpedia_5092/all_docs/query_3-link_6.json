        "text": "Rachel Portman with her Oscar\n\n\"Most of the films I've worked on have been independent in nature rather than huge box-office successes. I've really made my career out of doing projects I love.\"\n\n- Rachel Portman in 1997\n\nBorn on December 11, 1960, in Haslemere, England, Rachel Portman began using her musical talents at a young age. She started composing on piano at the age of 13, and eventually gained a formal education in composition, orchestration, and classical music at the University of Oxford. Her early career gained her considerable recognition in Great Britain, and she became known as a composer whose priorities rest with character, comedy, and drama. In 1988, Portman won the British Film Institute's \"Young Composer of the Year\" award, followed by the Carlton Television Award for \"Creative Originality for Women in Film.\"\n\nHer early career was marked by her consistent work for BBC films. She received Best Score nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for her scores to The Woman in Black and the three-part BBC drama Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit. She was honored with a third nomination for her score to Where Angels Fear To Tread. Finally, in 1996, she won the Academy Award in the United States for Emma. Although she chooses not to conduct her own scores, she employs the help of veterans David Snell and J.A.C Redford. She continues to compose her scores from her home in England\n\nShe does not make a big deal out of the fact that she is the first female composer to gain international recognition in the film music community. In 1995, she married motion picture producer Uberto Pasolini, and has two young daughters. She continues her scoring career in England, though with diminished output in the 2000's and 2010's. Although most of her early credits included an association with television productions, she later primarily focused on feature films. Along with impressive compositions for Only You and Addicted to Love, Portman composed music for song albums such as The Adventures of Pinocchio and a video sequel of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nFILMOGRAPHY & REVIEWS AT FILMTRACKS\n\n(see legend below for abbreviations and codes)\n\nTitleFR VRVT RD TRDates Notes2021:Julia***2020:Godmothered****3.39121|||2,0472018-2019:(none)2017:A Dog's Purpose****3.3584|||2,2312016:Their FinestRaceDespite the Falling Snow2015:Bessie (TV)2014:Dolphin Tale 2***2013:The Right Kind of WrongBelleStill LifeParadise2012:Private PeacefulBel Ami (co-wrote)**The Vow (co-wrote)**2.59133||1,4592011:Snow Flower and the Secret Fan***3.12164||1,7412010:Never Let Me Go***3.04277||1,3772009:Grey Gardens (TV) (AW)***2.94162||1,8712008:The Duchess***3.24371||1,210The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2***2.93121||1,9032007:(none)2006:Infamous**The Lake House***3.10187||1,3542005:Oliver Twist****3.59521|876Because of Winn-Dixie***2.51249||9362004:The Manchurian Candidate**3.16461||490Lard2003:Mona Lisa Smile***3.16389||563promotionalThe Human Stain***3.21626||6402002:Nicholas Nickleby***3.281,229|863The Truth About Charlie (co-wrote)***Hart's War****3.531,931||8862001:The Emperor's New Clothes***2000:Chocolat (AW)***3.523,170||181The Legend of Bagger Vance*****4.083,581|||236The Closer You Get***2.99194|8811999:The Cider House Rules (AW)****4.126,044||161RatcatcherThe Other Sister1998:Beloved**2.70249|1,043Home Fries1997:Addicted to Love****3.932,086||2261996:Marvin's Room***3.02167|1,336The Adventures of Pinocchio (co-wrote)***3.00173|1,041Emma (AW)***3.15459|5311995:To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!
