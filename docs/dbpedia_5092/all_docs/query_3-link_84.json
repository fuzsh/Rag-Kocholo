I will henceforth speak of myself in the third person,as is the wont of many highly paid athletes.\n\nSam McMurray was born,will live for a while, and probably die before he expects to. He has been an actor for over thiirty-five years. His parents and stepmother were actors, the mother of\n\nhis children was an actress, and his oldest daughter is an actress. Guess it couldnʼt be helped. Like any “ism”, itʼs a family disease.\n\nA Greenwich Village Idiot, he grew up in the theatre world and after college entered that world as a dues paying Equity member. He cobbled a living together from appearances on the New York stage,as well as regional theatre, the occasional commercial and TV and film roles. He is particularly fond of “Translations,” “A Soldierʼs Play,” “Savage in Limbo,”ʼ “The Taking of Miss Janie,” “KId Purple,” “Comedians,” and “Gray Spades,” to name a few. He is a long time member of Ensemble Studio Theater and a veteran of many summers at the Eugene OʼNeill Playwrights conference, where he debuted works by John Patrick Shanley, James Yoshimura and Adam Rapp, among others,as well as a regular contributor to the Seven Devils in McCall, Idaho.\n\nThe prospect of making a living wage appealed to him,so he relocated to Los Angeles in 1986. The timing was right, and he soon found work in features and on television,notably in “Raising Arizona,” “L.A. Story,” “Drop Dead Gorgeous,” “Stone Cold,” “Mod Squad” and “Dear God.” Not to mention “Slappy and the Stinkers.” He did the usual raft of guest shots on TV and appeared as a regular on “The Tracey Ullman Show,” “Likely Suspects,” “A League of their Own,” “Matt Waters,” “Medicine Ball,” “Stand by your Man,” and his favorite, “Dinosaurs.” More recently, he recurred on “King of Queens,”“Friends,”\n\n“Freaks and Geeks,” and “Breaking Bad.”\n\nAlthough technically declined, Mr. McMurray does have a computer, and is aware of online technology and the “next thing,” known as non-paying webisodes. The upside to this new venue is that he gets to do something he digs very much, with folks of voracious talent and appetite to wit, “Then We Got HELP!” This past Christmas he returned to New York in order to shoot two webisodes of the aforementioned, and had more fun doing them than anything in recent memory. Come March, Mr. McMurray will proudly link this show to anyone who wants to see something of his “work.” Itʼs a brave new world and Iʼm in it, goddammit.\n\nComposer Peter Melnick was Drama Desk-nominated for the music for Adrift in Macao, (book & lyrics by Christopher Durang). In collaboration with librettist Bill Russell, he wrote The Last Smoker in America, and musical one-acts Patter for the Floating Lady, based on Steve Martin's eponymous play, and A Bad Spell, adapted from Virginia Morricone’s short story, \"Simple Arithmatic.\" His music for dance includes the scores to Twyla Tharp's “Sextet” and Rudy Perez’s “Agenda.”\n\nMelnick is currently adapting Pete Hamill's Snow in August for Broadway, collaborating with lyricist Mindi Dickstein (Little Women) and book-writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark, the TV series Glee, and the upcoming musical adaptation of American Psycho).\n\nMelnick has contributed scores to over thirty films, television shows and documentaries.

He also studied privately with jazz pianist Jaki Byard. (Disclosure: he dropped out of Harvard one year shy of a degree in order to study music at Berklee, which he similarly abandoned seven semesters later when offered his first film scoring assignment. He does, however, have a perfectly nice high school diploma, of which he is inordinately proud.) Melnick grew up in New York, the product of an extraordinary entertainment family. His father was the late film producer Daniel Melnick (All That Jazz, Straw Dogs, Altered States, Footloose, Roxanne, That's Entertainment, and the seminal television comedy Get Smart). His mother is Linda Rodgers (composer of \"Three to Make Music,\" \"A Child's Introduction to Jazz\" and numerous popular children’s songs) and his grandfather was legendary composer Richard Rodgers.\n\nMelnick now makes his home in New York, although he continues to have strong ties to his West Coast community in Santa Barbara, California. Raised in the New York tradition of bagels-and-lox secular Judaism, Melnick has since connected with the Jewish world in a more active way. He became an adult bar-mitzvah in his thirties, and subsequently had the joy of teaching his own son how to chant Torah. He co-founded the Israel Committee of Santa Barbara, a group that fosters support for Israel through nuanced educational programs rather than propaganda, and he serves as president of the Community Shul of Montecito and Santa Barbara. Israel and its complexities are his third great passion, after family and musical theater.\n\nBrandon Michael Nase (he/him) is a multi-hyphenate currently based in New York City.
