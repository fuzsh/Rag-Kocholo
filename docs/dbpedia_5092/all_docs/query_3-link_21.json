        "text": "If \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" were a tournament golfer and not a movie about the sport, it would struggle just to make the cut.\n\nAnd while that might be fine for your ordinary, run-of-the-mill film, it's certainly not acceptable for one that features a big-name cast (including Matt Damon, Will Smith and Charlize Theron) and an A-list director (Robert Redford).\n\nCompounding the level of disappointment here is the fact that the film also comes from source material — Steven Pressfield's best-selling novel — that's loved by its fans for what they perceive as its depth of characterization and philosophical insight.\n\nHowever, it's been turned into a flat, even somewhat dull fantasy that isn't nearly as deep as it thinks it is. And despite having all the right elements in place for a great film, those parts never really come together — though some in the audience may like it simply because it's such a good-looking period piece.\n\nThe title character (played by Smith) is a mysterious stranger who appears, seemingly out of nowhere, in Depression-era Savannah, Ga. His arrival couldn't be better timed, as it turns out.\n\nThe man most in need of Bagger's help is Rannulph Junuh (Damon), a once-promising amateur golfer whose experiences in World War I have left him a bitter, broken man. Junuh hasn't golfed in years, either, which is a huge problem, because he's been entered in a two-day, 72-hole competition against two of the world's best players, Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill).\n\nAmong those rooting for him are his former flame and tournament organizer, Adele Inverwood (Theron), who needs the event to be a success if she's going to save her late father's golf course, as well as the struggling community.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that all may be hopeless, as the self-pitying hacker quickly plays himself out of contention. But Junuh's new, soft-spoken caddy seizes the opportunity to teach him to regain \"his authentic swing,\" which he seems to have lost.\n\nComing off this film and the only slightly more successful adaptation of \"The Horse Whisperer,\" you have to wonder if it's Redford himself who's lost his swing, because the whole thing is so leadenly paced and unaffecting.\n\nTo his credit, he and cinematographer Michael Ballhouse capture some striking images, but they're undermined by a surprisingly heavy-handed score (by the usually dependable Rachel Portman).\n\nNot that she's alone in the blame. In fact, the script (by \"Don Juan DeMarco\" filmmaker Jeremy Leven) is the real culprit, with its many unsuccessful story elements. Few of them work, which includes the clunky framing sequence (a lame excuse for voice-over narration by Jack Lemmon).\n\nPerhaps the weakest of these is the romantic subplot (which isn't in the novel), and the lack of chemistry between the Amazonian Theron and not exactly towering Damon certainly doesn't help.\n\nAs underwritten as his character is, Smith does give it a boost, though, as does young newcomer J. Michael Moncrief, as Junuh's biggest fan.\n\n\"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" is rated PG-13 for World War I violence (shown in flashbacks), scattered profanity, a crude sight gag and a brief, discreet sex scene. Running time: 127 minutes."
