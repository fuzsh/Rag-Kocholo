        "text": "BAFTA and the the Royal Albert Hall introduce a new series celebrating composers' work for Film, Television and Games.\n\nBAFTA and Royal Albert Hall Press Release (168.8 KB) The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and the Royal Albert Hall present , a series of three events with major composers for film, television and video games. Once a month from May to July 2012, the composers will take the stage in the Royal Albert Hall’s Elgar Room to discuss their work, illustrated with clips and including some performance element.\n\nIn the first of what is intended to be an annual series, the two major arts charities will come together to celebrate the important contribution composers offer to big and small screen media. The series is supported by PRS for Music, Asahi and Haagen Dazs and will be hosted by Tommy Pearson, a broadcaster and former BBC radio and TV host.\n\nContinuing the Elgar Room’s vision of innovative programming, this series of talks further highlights the Hall as a charity. Not only does it work on providing events that are diverse and affordable but also encouraging new audiences into the building and providing maximum public benefit through talks that are both entertaining and educational. The series is also part of BAFTA’s on-going commitment to providing audiences with access to professionals who have helped create their favourite films, television programmes and video games.\n\nOn Wednesday 9 May, BAFTA and Oscar winner Rachel Portman will open the series touching on a career that features films such as Bel Ami, One Day, Never Let Me Go, The Duchess, Emma, Chocolat, The Legend of Bagger Vance and The Cider House Rules as well HBO’s Grey Gardens starring Drew Barrymore for which she won an Emmy.\n\nOn Friday 29 June, five-time BAFTA-nominated video games composer James Hannigan will discuss his scores featuring in major games series including Harry Potter, Command and Conquer, The Lord of the Rings, Warhammer, EA Sports and Theme Park.\n\nOn Wednesday 11 July, Murray Gold, BAFTA-nominated four times for his television work on ground-breaking scores for Doctor Who, Casanova, Queer As Folk and Vanity Fair – who also scored Clocking Off and Shameless – will discuss his craft.\n\nBAFTA’s Head of Learning and Events Tim Hunter says: “BAFTA celebrates and explores excellence through both our Awards Ceremonies, and our year-round learning programme. We’re thrilled to be working with a major partner in the Royal Albert Hall, a brand also synonymous with excellence, and to be presenting talks with three composers who have been many-times recognised by their peers in BAFTA. We look forward to giving these composers a spotlight for the evening, and in the web-series that will follow on BAFTA’s web portal BAFTA Guru”\n\nLucy Noble, Head of Programming and Education at the Royal Albert Hall, says: “We are delighted to be hosting this innovative series in our Elgar Room in conjunction with BAFTA. The presentation of film continues to play a very important role in the Hall’s own programming and this collection of talks by three very talented composers is sure to captivate both film and music fans alike whilst adding another exciting strand to the Elgar Room’s diversity and providing new experiences to our audiences.”\n\nBAFTA and Royal Albert Hall’s Conversations with Composers will run from May-July 2012. All events start at 7:30pm. Tickets are £10/ £8 concession and can be booked through www.royalalberthall.com or through The Royal Albert Hall Box Office on 020 7589 8212.\n\nFor BAFTA, please contact:\n\n[email protected]\n\nFor the Royal Albert Hall, please contact:\n\nSean Carrigan: [email protected]/ 020 7959 0531\n\nAbout BAFTA\n\nThe British Academy of Film and Television Arts is an independent charity that supports, develops and promotes the art forms of the moving image by identifying and rewarding excellence, inspiring practitioners and benefiting the public.
