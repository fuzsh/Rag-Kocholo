        "text": "About the Book\n\nIn 1931 Savannah, a mesmerizing 36-hole match is taking place, in which two legends face off against a troubled former war hero. The key to the outcome lies with Bagger Vance, a caddie who carries the secret of the Authentic Swing. His mysterious powers guide the play and leave a lasting imprint on everyone around him--and on someone 60 years in the future.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nIn the Depression year of 1931, on the golf links at Krewe Island off Savannah's windswept shore, two legends of the game--Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen--meet for a mesmerizing thirty-six-hole showdown. Another golfer will also compete--a troubled local war hero, once a champion, who comes with his mentor and caddie, the mysterious Bagger Vance. It is Vance, sage and charismatic, who will ultimately guide the match, for he holds the secret of the Authentic Swing. And he alone can show his protege the way back to glory.\n\nWritten in the spirit of Golf in the Kingdom and The Natural, The Legend of Bagger Vance reveals the true nature of the game in a story that is unforgettable."
