        "text": "Who or what inspired you to pursue a career in music?\n\nI come from a large family that’s not particularly musical, so I owe a great deal to my mum who recognised a musical flame in me and sought out good local music teachers and opportunities for me to develop my music. I started focussing on composing at my school where I received encouragement from Roger Steptoe, who as a young composer had been given a period as composer in residence there.\n\nWho or what have been the most significant influences on your musical life and career as a composer?\n\nThe most significant influence on my writing is J.S.Bach whose music has been a touchstone in my life. I had a record of Yehudi Menuhin playing his violin concertos which I must have listened to a thousand times as a child. The other influence would be Maurice Ravel, whose music I discovered when I was 18 and I was bowled over by. I felt a strong desire to create music that could have such an effect.\n\nWhat have been the greatest challenges/frustrations of your career so far and how have you overcome them?\n\nThe greatest challenge in writing film music is managing the difficulties with constant picture changes, interpreting direction from directors who aren’t sure how to communicate what they want musically (!), and scary looming deadlines with too much music to write. Writing for the concert hall also has its challenges – wrestling with an idea, waiting for ideas to coalesce into something I’m happy with.\n\nHow do you work? What methods do you use and how do ideas come to you?\n\nI write and orchestrate at the piano with pencil and paper. It’s a mystery how ideas come to me. From the start I work hard and try out ideas while nothing seems quite right, but then at a certain point something good happens and I have an idea and I feel, ah that’s it. It usually happens when I get out of the way.\n\nHow would you characterise your compositional language/musical style?\n\nI find other people are much better at characterising my music than me! All I can say is my language is lyrical, tonal and often orchestral characterised by shifting harmonies. I like to write music that touches people.\n\nOf which works are you most proud?\n\nIn my film works , Never Let Me Go\n\nIn my concert works , First Morning of the World\n\nAs a musician, what is your definition of success?\n\nHaving written something that people enjoy listening to over and over, that touches them.\n\nWhat advice would you give to young or aspiring composers?\n\nFollow your creative passion with determination; no creative endeavour is ever wasted.\n\nWhat’s the one thing we’re not talking about in the music industry which you really feel we should be?\n\nI think music for film and TV is undervalued. At this time music budgets are often outrageously small and don’t reflect the huge significance the score from a skilled composer can bring to a project.\n\nWhat is your idea of perfect happiness?\n\nWalking amongst trees listening to birdsong at dawn in May.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nMy Bosendorfer grand piano.\n\nRachel Portman’s new album Beyond the Screen – Film Works on Piano is released on 3 March 2023 on the Sony Classical label\n\nBritish composer Rachel Portman became the first female composer to win an Academy Award, which she received for the score of Emma.\n\nRachel has written over 100 scores for film, television and theatre, including Manchurian Candidate (Jonathan Demme), Oliver Twist (Roman Polanski), Hart’s War (Greg Hoblit), Only You (Norman Jewison), The Legend of Bagger Vance (Robert Redford), Beloved (Jonathan Demme), Benny and Joon (Jeremiah Chechik), Life is Sweet (Mike Leigh), Never Let Me Go (Mark Romanek), Grey Gardens (Michael Sucsy), The Duchess (Saul Dibb), One Day (Lone Scherfig), The Vow (Michael Sucsy), Snow Flower and the Secret Fan (Wayne Wang), The Lake House (Alejandro Agresti), Infamous (Douglas McGrath), Mona Lisa Smile (Mike Newell), Human Stain (Robert Benton), Chocolat (Lasse Hallstrom), Cider House Rules (Lasse Hallstrom), Belle (Amma Asante), Dolphin Tale 2 (Charles Martin Smith), Bessie (Dee Rees), and Race (Stephen Hopkins).\n\nRead more\n\nImage Credit: Gregor Hohenberg"
