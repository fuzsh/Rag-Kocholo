        "text": "Golf in the Kingdom\n\nBy Michael Murphy,\n\nFrom my list on mind-body golf.\n\nBy Jayne Storey Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been fascinated by the link between golf and the Eastern arts since I heard the great Jack Nicklaus say that golf is played with the feet. This immediately struck a chord with me as my background spans over thirty years of Tai Chi training and I have understood from this art that all movement comes from the ground upwards. The early training of Nicklaus in fact echoes that of the ancient warriors who understood the link between intention and action, which is a very different approach to the modern way of over-thinking technique. The simplicity of flow cancels out the need to separate the golf swing into individual positions.\n\nJayne's book list on mind-body golf\n\nWhy did Jayne love this book?\n\nThis book is an absolute classic and should be in the library of every golfer who has ever touched those extraordinary moments we call the zone or flow. Murphy’s encounter with the enigmatic teacher Shivas Irons, has him questioning reality as he understands it with his logical mind. As their encounter unfolds, Murphy begins experiencing an opening of his perception to a deeper and more profound awareness of the forces and energies that can align to help create the perfect shot. This book shows how important it is to ‘get out of your own way’ and find your inner swing.\n\nBy Michael Murphy,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Golf in the Kingdom as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"...for golf's soul surfers, Golf in the Kingdom is holy scripture.\" -- Golf\n\nA spiritual journey, a lush travelogue, a parable of sports and philosophy-John Updike called this unique novel \"a golf classic if any exists in our day.\"\n\nPaired with a mysterious teacher named Shivas Irons, Michael Murphy is led through a round of phenomenal golf, swept into a world where extraordinary powers are unleashed in a backswing governed by \"true gravity.\" A night of adventure and revelation follows, and leads to a glimpse of Seamus MacDuff, the holy man who haunts a ravine off Burningbush's thirteenth fairway-the one…\n\nPreview\n\nDead Solid Perfect\n\nBy Dan Jenkins,\n\nFrom my list on golf fiction.\n\nBy James Y. Bartlett Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI started writing about golf years ago… I went from freelancing to working for Golfweek and pretty soon had a career! I thought I had a brilliant idea: a series of mysteries with a golf theme! Then I learned there were about 267 other golf mysteries already out there, starting with Dame Agatha’s Murder on the Links! Oops. I eventually wrote seven Hacker novels, finally getting my golf-writer-turned-sleuth through all four majors. I also published a historical novel set in Scotland (sorry, no golf) and just launched the new Swamp Yankee Mystery series, set in a small Rhode Island town remarkably similar to the one I live in!\n\nJames' book list on golf fiction\n\nWhy did James love this book?\n\nDan Jenkins (1928-2019) was a quintessential sportswriter who wrote for newspapers in his native Texas as well as for Sports Illustrated and many others. In 1974, he published this ribald classic about the pro golf tours, starring Kenny Lee Puckett, a down on his luck pro who has more luck getting in trouble with the ladies than he does making tough putts.\n\nIf you don’t laugh while reading this book, then you need a humor transplant.\n\nBy Dan Jenkins,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Dead Solid Perfect as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe legendary golf novel, rereleased in a special edition with a new foreword by the author.\n\nDon Imus said it best: \"Dan Jenkins is a comic genius.\" And nowhere is that genius more evident than in Dead Solid Perfect, his uproarious 1974 novel about life on the PGA Tour. To some, Kenny Lee Puckett, the star of Jenkins's ribald saga, is a more important figure in the history of golf than Bobby Jones himself.\n\nPreview\n\nA Month of Sundays\n\nBy John Updike,\n\nWhy did James love this book?\n\nJohn Updike, writing about golf? Well, why not? This novel, from one of America’s greatest writers, is something of a riff on Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter, in a story about a disgraced minister sent off on a sabbatical. He keeps a daily journal, which is what makes up the novel.\n\nNaturally, this being Updike, there are stories about his affairs, his drinking, his family relationships, and more. But there are also wonderful passages about his golf game. Like much of Updike’s work, this book is thought-provoking and an interesting window into the American mind of the 20th century.\n\nBy John Updike,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Month of Sundays as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nUpdike's seventh novel concerns a month of seven days, a month of enforced rest and recreation as experienced by the Reverend Tom Marshfield, sent west from his Midwestern church in disgrace.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Greatest Player Who Never Lived\n\nBy J. Michael Veron,\n\nWhy did James love this book?\n\nJ. Michael Veron is a trial lawyer and avid golfer who has written a trilogy of legal thrillers (he’s been called the John Grisham of golf) that all have a strong golf theme. The Greatest Player was the first, featuring a summer intern at an Atlanta law firm who finds an old file of correspondence between the legendary Bobby Jones (who was, when not winning most of the golf tournaments between 1920 and 1930, when he retired from tournament golf, an Atlanta attorney) and a fictional teen-aged golf prodigy named Beau Stedman.\n\nThere’s a murder mystery and a court case and a lot of golf from the Golden Age of the sport.\n\nBy J. Michael Veron,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Greatest Player Who Never Lived as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen Charley Hunter goes to work as a summer intern at a prestigious Atlanta law firm, he has no idea that his passion for golf will come into play on the job. Stumbling onto a yellowed file containing correspondence between Beau Stedman, an astonishingly talented teenage golfer, and the legendary Bobby Jones (once a partner at the firm), Hunter finds himself embroiled in a decades-old murder case–and searching for an invisible champion who won nearly all his matches with the masters.\n\nAs Hunter unravels the facts of Stedman’s case, his hunger for the truth is matched only by his deepening…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Human Stain\n\nBy Philip Roth,\n\nWhy did James love this book?\n\nI have always considered Philip Roth to be a master stylist and, even more, a brilliant author of the way that characters think and feel. This book is also wonderful for the way its ironies unfold in a story that is riveting, disturbing, and revealing.\n\nI am intrigued by the way that Roth can confront important social issues. Even though this was written several years ago, I find it to be particularly relevant to the debates about diversity that seem to concern us most as a society today.\n\nBy Philip Roth,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Human Stain as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe American psyche is channelled into the gripping story of one man. This is the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Philip Roth at his very best.\n\nIt is 1998, the year America is plunged into a frenzy of prurience by the impeachment of a president. In a small New England town a distinguished professor, Coleman Silk, is forced to retire when his colleagues allege that he is a racist. The charge is unfounded, the persecution needless, but the truth about Silk would astonish even his most virulent accuser. Coleman Silk has a secret that he has kept for fifty years. This is…\n\nPreview\n\nA Lesson Before Dying\n\nBy Ernest J. Gaines,\n\nFrom my list on books for law lovers, fairness fighters, and true crime connoisseurs.\n\nBy Karen Conti Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFrom a young age, I read and watched everything about the Jack the Rippers, Black Dahlias, and Ted Bundys of the world. I think humans are fascinated by these killers, the worst of the worst, in the same way we are drawn to the best of the best. We want to know what makes them tick. One of the reasons I became a lawyer is at a young age I wanted to be a part of making sure justice is done—for everyone, regardless of their societal status. An empathetic person, I wanted to help others, even those who made horrific life choices. The law, true crime, and fighting for fairness are my passions!\n\nKaren's book list on books for law lovers, fairness fighters, and true crime connoisseurs\n\nWhy did Karen love this book?\n\nI love the heart-breaking power of this story about a falsely accused Black man on death row in the racist 1940s South. A college-educated teacher visits him in prison and gives him some dignity before his execution happens, and in so doing, gives meaning to himself and his community.\n\nThe unfairness of what went on in this country on a daily basis with our criminal justice system is shameful. But this book compels us to rise above it and create meaning and hope.\n\nThe conversations are real and raw, and I cried real tears at the end. This book made me think, feel, and care about justice being done.\n\nBy Ernest J. Gaines,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked A Lesson Before Dying as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD WINNER • A deep and compassionate novel about a young man who returns to 1940s Cajun country to visit a Black youth on death row for a crime he didn't commit.

Everett,\n\nWhy did Daniel love this book?\n\nAny novel that shines a light on the adventures and misadventures of a fictional Seattle Mariners third baseman with a pet elephant that answers to the name Renoir is worthy of your time and attention. I’m late to the party on this but so glad I sparked to it.\n\nBy Percival L. Everett,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Suder as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nCraig Suder, third baseman for the Seattle Mariners, is in a terrible slump. He's batting below .200 at the plate, and even worse in bed with his wife; and he secretly fears he's inherited his mother's insanity. Ordered to take a midseason rest, Suder instead takes his record of Charlie Parker's \"\"Ornithology,\"\" his record player, and his new saxophone and flees, negotiating his way through madcap adventures and flashbacks to childhood (\"\"If you folks believed more strongly in God, maybe you wouldn't be coloured\"\"). Pursued by a raging dope dealer, saddled with a mishandled elephant and an abused little white…\n\nPreview\n\nWaiting to Exhale\n\nBy Terry McMillan,\n\nFrom my list on novels about romance, rejection, and betrayal that pair well with tubs of ice cream.\n\nBy Sheri Langer Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy parents split up when I was six. I escaped from my sadness by reading stories about love and relationships and exploring how others went about the business of living and coping. I married young for security and to have a big family of my own. I succeeded. I have four amazing kids, but after years of wedded chaos, I too was divorced. As a single mom, I set out in search of my own identity and went back to novels to help me find myself. Though I’ve since been fortunate to find my happily ever after, I still enjoy characters that feel like friends who offer warmth, hope, and comfort.\n\nSheri's book list on novels about romance, rejection, and betrayal that pair well with tubs of ice cream\n\nWhy did Sheri love this book?\n\nAs a white Jewish woman, I know I’m not the authority on the systemic issues inherent in romantic relationships in Black culture, but the good news is, this novel doesn’t require me to be. Bernadine, Savannah, Gloria, and Robin, four Black, thirty-something women navigating their way through love in the nineties, is a story that transcends race.\n\nAs I read about their hopes and dreams, their disappointments and pain, I recognized myself. Through McMillan’s clear voice, I was able to step into each character’s shoes and feel my way through their experiences. I also learned that a cheating guy’s car is an easy target- memorable!\n\nFlavor Pick: Cookies and Cream\n\nBy Terry McMillan,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Waiting to Exhale as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe story of four vibrant black women in their thirties.

Cosby,\n\nFrom my list on books that evoke a place and take you there.\n\nBy David Miller Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love cities, and as a former Mayor, I understand their vibrant complexity. Like all of us, I am deeply worried about planetary breakdown, but unlike most, I’ve had the privilege of seeing firsthand the great work that leading mayors are undertaking globally to address the climate crisis. It's my belief that if more of us knew what is happening in some cities, and therefore what is possible in all, we would not only see that it is possible to avoid climate breakdown but fuelled by that hope, we would demand change from those we elect. You can hear more in the podcast I lead, Cities 1.5, or read more in my occasional newsletter on substack.\n\nDavid's book list on books that evoke a place and take you there\n\nWhy did David love this book?\n\nA novel about a black Sheriff’s efforts to catch a serial killer in the fictional small town and surrounding area of Charon County, Virginia, where racism is real and visceral, and the Confederates are considered heroes by many.\n\nThe book brilliantly transports you inside the complex racial and religious realities of everyday life in a small Virginia town. Crosby’s ear for language and understanding of daily life in such a place take you there. You can picture not just the characters but also very much the place—from the town to the farms to the buildings to the rooms in them—and to the food and alcohol people drink. Small-town America is brought to vivid life.\n\nBy S. A.
