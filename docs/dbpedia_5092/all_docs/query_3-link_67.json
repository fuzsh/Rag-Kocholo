The cast is superb and I love the tone set by Redford to make this film look and feel magical. The story works really well as both a fantasy and an allegory for life and resonates for so long after watching it. The characters are developed quite well and distinctly and each has their own reachable goals in life and in golf. Wonder if the book feels as phantasmagorical as this film does. Amazing score by Rachel Portman. Highly Recommended!\n\nMovieRob’s Favorite Trivia – Originally, the lead roles were going to be played by Morgan Freeman and Robert Redford. But, after careful consideration, Redford decided that the movie would work better with younger men playing Rannulph Junuh and Bagger Vance. (From IMDB)\n\nRating – Oscar Worthy (9/10)\n\n_______________________________________\n\nCheck out my *updated* movie stats here\n\nTo see my reviews of Oscar Winning Performances check out this link\n\nTo see my reviews of all Oscar Best Picture Winners click here (now complete)"
