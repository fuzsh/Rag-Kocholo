        "text": "Academy Award winners John Williams, Hans Zimmer, and Rachel Portman will compete with Carter Burwell and Yann Tiersen for the composer of the year prize in the inaugural World Soundtrack Awards. The honor will be presented at the 28th Flanders International Film Festival in Ghent, Belgium, which runs Oct. 8-18.\n\nZimmer is nominated for his work on several films, including “Hannibal,” “Pearl Harbor,” “The Pledge,” and “An Everlasting Piece.” Portman earned her nod for “Chocolat” and “The Legend of Bagger Vance.” Burwell’s scores for “A Knight’s Tale,” “Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,” and “Before Night Falls” put him in contention. Tiersen’s nomination is for the French hit “Amelie From Montmartre.” Five-time Oscar-winner Williams is nominated for his score for “A.I. Artificial Intelligence.”\n\nFour of the composers are also nominated in the best original soundtrack category for 2000-01: Zimmer for “Hannibal,” Burwell for “Before Night Falls,” Tiersen for “Amelie From Montmartre,” and Williams for “A.I. Artificial Intelligence.” They are joined by Craig Armstrong and Marius De Vries for their score for “Moulin Rouge.”\n\nAwards — decided by an international jury of film music professionals — will also be presented in three other categories.\n\nThe nominees for best original song written directly for a film are “Where the Dream Takes You,” by Diane Warren and James Newton Howard from “Atlantis: The Lost Empire”; “Cuante cose chiare,” by Louis Crelier and Lucia Albertoni from “Azzurro”; “Soy un angelito,” by Daniel Tarrab and Andreas Goldstein from “Felicidades”; “For Always,” by Williams and Cynthia Weil from “A.I.”; and “Come What May,” by David Baerwald from “Moulin Rouge.”\n\nNominated for best original score not released on an album are “AntiTrust,” Don Davis; “Blow,” Graeme Revell; “Bridget Jones’s Diary,” Patrick Doyle; “Moulin Rouge,” Armstrong and De Vries; and “Pauline & Paulette,” Frederic Devreese.\n\nDiscovery of the year nominees are Armstrong (“Kiss of the Dragon,” “Moulin Rouge”), Jeff Beal (“Pollock”), Tan Dun (“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), Osvaldo Golijov (“The Man Who Cried”), Panayotis Kalantzopoulos (“Cheap Smokes”), and Adam Norden (“Beck: Revenge”)."
