The screenplay by Jeremy Leven is based on the 1995 book The Legend of Bagger Vance: A Novel of Golf and the Game of Life by Steven Pressfield. It takes place in the U.S. state of Georgia in 1931. The film served as the final roles of Jack Lemmon before his death the following year and Lane Smith before his death five years later.\n\nOn release, the film was a box office bomb, grossing almost $40 million worldwide — only half of its budget — and received mixed reviews; criticism was targeted by several African American commentators and reviewers for employing the \"magical negro\" stereotype.\n\nPost Production Sound Services were provided by SKYWALKER SOUND a division of Lucas Digital Ltd., Marin County, California: Gary Rydstrom served as the sound designer, supervising sound editor (with Richard Hymns), and re-recording mixer. Al Nelson and Sound Effects Editor Shannon Mills served as uncredited assistant sound designers. Dennie Thopre did foley, edited by Susan Sanford and recorded by Frank \"Pepe\" Merel.\n\nStoryline[]\n\nA disillusioned war veteran, Captain Rannulph Junuh, reluctantly agrees to play a game of golf. He finds the game futile until his caddy, Bagger Vance, teaches him the secret of the authentic golf stroke which turns out also to be the secret to mastering any challenge and finding meaning in life.\n\nSound Effects Used[]\n\nSKYWALKER EXPLOSION 01\n\nSKYWALKER EXPLOSION 13 (low volume)\n\nSKYWALKER EXPLOSION 22\n\nSKYWALKER, EXPLOSION - TANK FIRE (Heard once in low quality)\n\nImage Gallery[]\n\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)/Image Gallery\n\nAudio Samples[]"
