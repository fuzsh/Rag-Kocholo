        "text": "The city is located at 44 degrees 28 minutes longitude and 38 degrees 56 minutes latitude. The difference between Khoy city and Tehran time is 25 minutes 34 seconds i.e. at 12 p.m. in Khoy the time is 12: 25 minutes and 34 seconds in Tehran.\n\nIts scope is 1050 hectares, with a total of 1422 hectares by considering the outside surrounding area. The Khoy plain is located on the southeastern slope of the Armenian plateau and its average elevation is 1139 meters above sea level. It is inferior than all of the adjoining plains, even than Lake Urmia, that is why it is called the Khoy Chukhuri (Khoy Pit). The maximum height of the city in the west is 1150 meters and the minimum height in the east is 1080 meters.\n\nIt is located in 141 kilometers of Urmia city in the center of West Azarbaijan province, 143 kilometers of Tabriz in the center of East Azarbaijan province, 147 kilometers of Maku, and 777 kilometers of Tehran and about 32 kilometers of Turkish border.\n\nThe slope of this plain is from southwest to northeast and the city slope is generally from west to east. The maximum height of the city in the west reaches 1150 meters and the minimum in the east reaches 1080 meters. In other words, the height difference between the westernmost point of the city and the easternmost point is 90 meters.\n\nKhoy Lagoons:\n\nSiyah-Baz Lagoon:\n\nThis lagoon is located in 52 kilometers of north of Khoy and 12 kilometers of west of Bazargan Transit Road. It is 70 hectares and is divided into two sections by a canal. It became clear that due to the excessive use of groundwater, there is no water in this lagoon and the cars pass from it.\n\nGris Lagoon\n\nThis lagoon is located in the northwest of Khoy and it is next to a village named Gris. Due to the excessive use of groundwater, there isn't any water in this lagoon.\n\nHunting grounds\n\nHunting Rules and Regulations in Khoy:\n\nHunting rules and regulations at the country, provinces and towns are notified and enforced annually by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency in addition to the approved laws.\n\nHunting areas in Khoy:\n\nProhibited Hunting Area of Zorabad (Zurabad):\n\nIt acts as a winter quarter bridge or corridor and connects Marakan and Aland countryside. The hills and meadows of Clavance and Pir Anbar and Solouse with favorable species of plants, adequate water and temperate weather have the most favorable conditions and biological factors. This area covers an area of about 90,000 hectares, and at the highest point of the summit of Mountain Solouse and Pir anbar, it is 2643 meters high and Aqchai River crosses it. The rocky shores of Bastam Castle and the construction of the Ghorol Dam on the river of Aghchai and the presence of natural landscapes and numerous permanent landscapes have added to the beauty of this area. This area is located in the Safaieh district of Khoy and it is bounded by different places:\n\nfrom North: Ali Sheikh's bridge over the AghChai River to Aghbash, St. Mullah Ismail to Bastam.\n\nfrom East: Bastam Road to Kian, Kahriz Mirza Khalil Khan, Chores, Dowl, Pirkandi, Zarean, Iribujaq to Asgarabad of Khoy.\n\nfrom South: Asgar Abad to Hamzian, Sofla Road, Meidanlar to Shah Abbas Gordik.\n\nfrom West: The asphalt road from King Abbas Gordik by the crossroads of Gris to Ali Sheikh bridge.\n\nThe wildlife of the area can be described as goats, Armenian rams, wolves, cats, bears, rabbits, and all kinds of Quebec birds, hunting birds and scavengers.\n\nProtected Area of Marakan :\n\nOn 1966/ 02/ 9 it was named and protected as Yekanat and Marakan Protected Area. On 1968/ 08/ 29, Yekanat was separated from Marakan and Marakan was declared as a protected area. This area is located at 39 degrees north latitude and 45 degrees 20 minutes of east between the provinces of East and West Azerbaijan; it is managed by the General Department of Environmental Protection of West Azerbaijan in the Khoy district and covers an area of 92715 hectares.\n\nThe Marakan Protected Area with a warm climate is located on the edge of the Aras River, and it is bounded by mountains in the southern and western parts. This area is generally mountainous and is divided into two parts by the Qotur Chai River (Agh Chai), which lies in a deep valley called the Sham Valley. On the eastern and western sides of the Sham Valley, there are numerous hills and valleys that make up the major mountain wildlife habitats. On the other hand, the lowland plains are located on the east of Sham Valley (Galuj Plain), which are nothing against the dominance of the mountainous areas. This area is rich in wildlife and has habitats from which the most important ones are:\n\nSheep Habitat:\n\nImportant habitats of rams in the west of the Sham Valley include: Aghdagh, Ghara Khalil, Soltanqoli and Zoghal Chukhuri, Dalik Aghel, Kahlıq Bodagi, Arpachukhori. The habitats in the east of Sham Valley are: Kohneh kand, Mohammad Saleh, Ghosha aghel, At Aghel, Chay Kasan, Monjughlou, Mohammad Salah, Tikmeh, Ghizil Aghel Golaraj, Eli Bashif Kelid Daghi, Armani Deimi.\n\nGoat Habitat:\n\nThis habitat includes: the rocky highlands on both sides of the Sham Valley, Goy valley, Kechi castle, Halag valley, Jolfa Dashi, rocky heights overlooking the Aras river.\n\nTiger habitat:\n\nIt includes: rocky highlands on both sides of the Sham Valley, Salabord, Goy Valley, and Agh Dagh.\n\nImportant habitats of lynx:\n\nMeadows of Kohneh Kand, Moli, Yalabord, Qara khalil, Termish, mountain Key, Armenian Dily and Sarkesh.\n\nHunting facilities:\n\nBuilding:\n\nMarakan Protected Area with 6 environmental units and two guest buildings in the center of Marakan and east of Abbasi (Jolfa) with all facilities, is ready for foreign and domestic hunters.\n\nRivers\n\nQotur River\n\nQotur River is in the Aras watershed and its catchment area is 3471.9 square kilometers which is created from northwestern folds in Mountain Zagros, so that some areas have steep slopes and there are fewer flat areas. The area of the Qotur River Basin to the Border Bar is 248 km2 (entrance of Qotur River to Iran) is 290 meters high, 810 square kilometers and the length of the main waterways in Turkey is 115 kilometers. It is worth remembering that the specifications were estimated using the map 250000/1.\n\nQotur River flows through its hydrological unit from west to east after crossing into Iran. This river is surrounded by high mountains from the beginning of Khoy plain and the distance of the border bar up to the city of Khoy is 70 km. Numerous branches such as Chilik, Calendso, Avrash, Qylaliq, Serik, Ghazan, Aland and Ghudogh Boghan enter the Khoy Plain in Boylapoosh and are used and then they change their direction to the north and enter the Evogli Plain. The Zilber Chai River, after crossing this plain, enters the Qotur chai at a point after Mozaffarabad in the Evogli Protected Area. Some branches from the south of the northern slopes of Mountains Misho and Ghazan, before joining to Zilber chai and other branches from the northeast on the slopes of Qara Dagh, Agh Dagh and Ali Bash to the Qotur River, the two rivers are joined and at the end they join Agh chai in Marakan village. They are named Qotur chai (sometimes called Agh Chai), and they pass through a valley named Sham, and at the Farhadi border checkpoint lead to the Aras River.\n\nAland River\n\nThe Aland River is one of the major tributaries of the Qotur River that flows in the city of Khoy. The river originates from the border mountains of Iran and Turkey under the name of Kani Ziarat, Nazarbeik and Hajibeik. These mountains are approximately 57 kilometers from Khoy. The first tributary of this river lies in the village of Badlan which is named Badlan and enters the Aland River. This tributary originates from the Great Orian Mountains, which is the highest peak in the Aland River Basin, and it is 3622 meters above sea level. Mount Orian lies in 34 kilometers in the west part of Khoy. The water from the melted snow flows into the Badlan River and flows into the Aland River. Upon joining the tributary of Badlan, the River flows northward and enters the Khoy Plain. Up to this point, the length of Aland River is 70 kilometers and the catchment area is 712 square kilometers and in the flood and downstream of the village of Bizandeh, it enters the Qotur River.\n\nAgh Chai River\n\nThis river originates from Iran and Turkey border mountains. At first it was two tributaries, one is the Sheikh Selunaver branch, which is originated from the Sheikh-e-Selunaver Mountains with the height of 2769 meters and the other one is Ghara Dara branch at the lower part of the Kordkandi Chalderan village , which is originated from the mountains of Hajibeik, Yegmalleh, Khan, and Sadr. The river basin is 1331 square kilometers and after crossing Qorul, Gharazia-al-Din, Hajilar, Zangalan villages and the transit road axis from Evogli to Bazargan at Hosseini Abad village, it reaches Qotur river. In its path, the river irrigates the Ghara-ziya- al- din plain and the surrounding fields and joins Aras in a waterlogged area along Qotur River.\n\nZilbar chai River\n\nThis river originates from mountains Misho , Payam and Zonuz and flows from east to west (also known as Gizil chai) and joins Qotur River within the Marakan Protected Area at Mozafarabad. The water of this river is not usable for agriculture due to the mud and the salinity that passes through the saline lands. The river basin is 2650 square kilometers with discharge of 15,441 million cubic meters.\n\nWildlife:\n\nMammals\n\nKhoy has a rare ecosystem and its own topographical and climatology conditions have led to the emergence of diverse habitat conditions. Various mammals live in the city with relatively abundant species such as goats, sheep, jackals, boars, wolves, foxes, rabbits, tigers, blacksmiths, weasels, and rodents, such as bipedal rats and squirrels.\n\nBirds\n\nThe birds of Khoy city are mostly xerophilous and they are more abundant than aquatic species. Birds of the Khoy city include:\n\nHunting birds such as: Golden Eagle, Hypotriorchis, kestrel, Aquila rapax, Honey buzzard, Falco pelegrinoides, Hawk, kuku, saker Falcon; Buzzards such as Griffon vulture and vulture, and other birds such as Caspian snowcock, Partridge, Crane, small crane, golden oriole, Green bee- eater, Indian roller, different types of warbler, yellowhammer, Pallas's sandgrouse, swallow and bullfinch.\n\nAquatics\n\nKhoy city with two rivers of Qotur and Agh Chai and by connecting to Aras border river is a valuable area for aquatic life especially fish. In addition to providing protein, fish has a privileged position. On the other hand, the importance of fish in the life cycle and its role in aquatic ecosystems and important food chains is undeniable. Fishing is also a fun and popular sport besides a fresh air and beautiful natural scenery and provides mental and spiritual comfort. Below are the names of the fish that are identified in Khoy City. Gypsy fish, tail fish, sauce fish, big head fish, apricot, black fish, underwater fish, common carp, other aquatics such as blue snake, salamander and aquatic turtles and crabs ...\n\nReptiles and Amphibians\n\nReptiles and amphibians, like other animals, have their own place in the ecosystem and food chain. Amphibians are the food of snakes and they themselves are fed by insects. Reptiles play an important role in the food chain, they are the food of carnivorous birds such as weasel and so on. On the other hand, they themselves are fed by insects, molluscs, and small mammals and control these animals' populations and thereby serve an important role in agriculture. Sometimes reptiles are useful in controlling diseases caused by vector insects and help humans.\n\nVarious types of reptiles and amphibians in this city are: Common green toad, all kinds of frogs, turtles, all kinds of lizards and snakes, parsley, single snake, asphyxia, chainsaw, fire snake, black snake.\n\nIntroducing Endangered Species in Khoy City:\n\nThere are no extinct mammals listed in the Khoy city, but endangered birds include the Golden Eagle, the Hawk, Falco pelegrinoides, saker Falcon, Caspian snowcock.\n\nIntroducing Specific Animal Species in Khoy City:\n\nSpecific animal species of this area are: tiger, Armenian sheep and goat which are rarely observed in other cities.\n\nKhoy city aqueduct:\n\nThere were 75 aqueducts registered in Khoy district, which are decreased because of the excessive use of groundwater.\n\nSeven aqueducts with water discharge of 0.457 million cubic meters were exploited during 2000-2011.\n\nWells of Khoy City:\n\nThe number of deep agricultural wells in the region was 926 rings, semi-deep wells 608 rings, industrial wells 99 rings, semi-deep industrial wells 42 rings, 80 urban and rural water wells and 3 urban and rural wells. Agriculture wells produce 340.374 million cubic meters per year.\n\nSome 25.057 million cubic meters was discharged from drinking water wells and 12.227 million cubic meters was discharged from industrial wells, but according to the statistics of year, 1142 deep wells and 558 wells discharge 6868/400 and 34.499 million cubic meters respectively with a sum of 4.188 million cubic.\n\nDue to the impossibility of controlling the equipment of pumping motor during their installation, it seems that the utilization rate of different wells in the region is 30-40% more than the allowed discharge stated in the operating licenses and with the increase of utilization of groundwater resources in recent years and the inability in discharging groundwater, the level of groundwater has been drastically reduced. This decline has been noticeable in the last 10 years. Accordingly, for the sake of preventing this decrease, from 1993, the Ministry of Energy, banned the use of this water until 2001.\n\nKhoy City Springs:\n\nThere are numerous springs in the valleys and plains which are related to groundwater. The number of springs were 13 boreholes but there were 7 boreholes in 1999-2000 and the annual discharge was 3.77 million cubic meters. The springs of Aland and Qotur chai rivers flow in valleys of the current regions and flow into the Khoy plain.\n\nKhoy Mineral Springs:\n\nGhara shaban Mineral Spring, in 6 km of Khoy-Tabriz Road.\n\nNatraei Mineral Spring in a village of the same name in northwest of Khoy.\n\nVishalaq Mineral Spring in northwest of Khoy.\n\nEvogli Mineral Spring in a village of the same name in northwest of Khoy.\n\nShur Bulagh Bilawar Mineral Spring in the south of Bilawar village in northwest of Khoy.\n\nZarean Mineral Spring in northwest of Bilawar and west of Zarean village.\n\nDaste Darreh Mineral Spring in northwest of Khoy.\n\nCalawans Mineral Spring in the northwest of Khoy.\n\nShegefti Mineral Spring in the Northwest of the South Slope of Agh-Bulagh.\n\nGharenja Mineral Spring in northwest of Khoy in Gharenja village.\n\nKhan Mineral Spring in 40 km of southwest of Khoy (Qotur Valley)\n\nRazi Mineral Spring in Southwest of Khoy in a village of the same name."
