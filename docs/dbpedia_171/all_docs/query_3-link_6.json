        "text": "Southeastern Iran is a vast region that, in history, its different parts had various names. And today, the political divisions of the country include a large area in the provinces of Sistan and Baluchestan, Kerman, Hormozgan, and a small part of Greater Khorasan. This region has an undeniable role in the history and civilization of Southwest Asia, as it has shone for thousands of years as a significant part of international exchanges and cultural relations.\n\nIn the frame of the archaeological researches carried out between the 60s and the 70s of the last century in Iranian Sistan by an Italian team of IsMEO (Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente) headed by Umberto Scerrato, some trenches were excavated at the fortified citadels of Qal‛a-ye Tepe and Qal‛a-ye Sam in order to obtain data to be compared with the information which, during those years, the same team was gathering at the nearby Achaemenid site of Dahāne-ye Gholāmān. The ongoing reappraisal of the results from those still unpublished archaeological activities (to be meant as a part of “Archaeo.Pro.Di.Mu.S: Archaeological Project Digital and Multimedia Sistan”, housed at the Università degli Studi di Napoli “L’Orientale” and supervised by Prof. Bruno Genito) is centred on the re-examination and digital reorganisation of the extant documental archive concerning those two sites and on the study of the ceramic assemblage therein recovered"
