        "text": "City in West Azerbaijan province, Iran\n\nFor the administrative division of West Azerbaijan province, see Khoy County. For the village in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, see Khoy. For Serer divination ceremony, see Xooy. For other uses of a similar name, see Khoi.\n\nCity in West Azerbaijan, Iran\n\nKhoy (Persian and Azerbaijani: خوی)[a] is a city in the Central District of Khoy County, West Azerbaijan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.[6] Occupied since Median times, it shares a long history as an important Christian center.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKhoy was named in ancient times for the salt mines that made it an important spur of the Silk Route.[7] 3000 years ago, a city existed on the area where Khoy is located nowadays, but its name became Khoy only in the 14th centuries ago.[8] In 714 BC, Sargon II passed the region of which Khoy is part of in a campaign against Urartu.[8]\n\nDuring the reign of Greater Armenia this city was a part of Nor-Shirakan province (ashkar). Khoy was mentioned in the 8th century AD and was called Her by Anania Shirakatsi in \"Ashkharatsuyts\".\n\nIn the Parthian period, Khoy was the gateway of the Parthian Empire in the Northwest. During the reign of Armenian king Tigranes the Great, Khoy is mentioned as being an important settlement of the Silk Route.[8] Around the year 37 BC, Mark Antony had crossed the plain that is located between Khoy and Marand during one of the many and frequent Roman-Parthian Wars.[8]\n\nScholars such as Josef Markwart consider Khoy to be the identical to the Gobdi station mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana.\n\nOne of the important historic elements of the city is Surp Sarkis Church. Armenian documents wrote that the date of the making has to be either 332 or 333 AD.[8] In the city and its surrounding villages, churches are seen and it is reported that Armenians have always been comprising a significant amount of the city’s population.[8][page needed]\n\nBy the first half of the 11th century the Byzantine emperors were actively trying to round off their eastern territories, in an attempt to absorb the unstable Armenian dynasties. In 1021-2 emperor Basil II led his army as far as Khoy within 175 km of Dvin, and obtained the surrender of royalty from the Artsruni dynasty of Van.[10]\n\nIn 1210, the city was conquered by the forces of Kingdom of Georgia sent by Tamar the Great under the command of Zakaria and Ivane Mkhargrdzeli. This was a response to the sacking of Georgian-controlled Ani which occurred in 1208 and left 12,000 Christians dead.[11][12][13]\n\nThe city was ruled over by Malika, wife of Jalal al-Din Mangburni after his conquest of the city in the late 1220s.[14]\n\nModern period\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the wake of the demise of the Safavids, the Ottomans took Khoy on 6 May 1724, a territorial gain which was confirmed with Imperial Russia through the Treaty of Constantinople (1724).[15]\n\nUntil 1828, Khoy had a large number of Armenians; however, the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), gave the Russians the right to encourage Armenians to immigrate into the Russian Empire. Nevertheless, a small Armenian population remained living in Khoy. This was noted by an American missionary in 1834.[16] He noted further that in the villages around Khoy there were a few more, but the vast majority had migrated to the North of the Aras river following Russia's victory over Persia in 1828 and the encouraged settling in the newly incorporated Russian regions of Eastern Armenia.[16]\n\nWith the advent of the 1910s, Khoy was occupied by Ottoman troops, but they were completely expelled from the area by the Russians by 1911. Khoy was one of the many cities in Iran which garrisoned Russian infantry and Cossacks. The Russians retreated at the time of Enver Pasha's offensive in the Iran-Caucasus region, but returned in around early 1916, and stayed in the region up to the wake of the Russian Revolution. In 1918, for a final brief period, the Ottomans took Khoy until the decisive end of World War I and the Armistice of Mudros. In World War II, Khoy was again occupied by Soviet troops, who remained until 1946. After 1946 the city indefinitely became part of Iran and is located in the far northwest of the country.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the time of the 2006 National Census, the city's population was 178,708 in 45,090 households.[18] The following census in 2011 counted 200,958 people in 57,149 households.[19] The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 198,845 people in 59,964 households.[3]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nKhoy is north of the province's capital and largest city Urmia, and 807 km north-west to Tehran. The region's economy is based on agriculture, particularly the production of fruit, grain, and timber. Khoy is nicknamed as the Sunflower city of Iran. At the 2006 census, the city had a population of 178,708, with an estimated 2012 population of 200,985. Khoy is largely populated by ethnic Azerbaijanis,[20] except for the residents of the western edge of Khoy, who are mostly Kurds; The majority of the population (more than 90%) subscribes to the Shiite sect of Islam. The Kurds of this less, who live mostly in a nomadic way as opposed to the mostly settled Azerbaijanis, are largely Sunni and are composed of two independent tribes, Shakkak and Madrumi.[21]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as cold semi-arid (BSk).[22]\n\nHighest recorded temperature:42.8 °C (109.0 °F) on 26 July 2020[23]\n\nLowest recorded temperature:−30.0 °C (−22.0 °F) on 24 January 1964[24]\n\nSights\n\n[edit]\n\nKhoy is well known for the tomb of Shams Tabrizi, renowned Iranian poet and mystic.\n\ncity center square\n\nKhoy bazaar\n\nhistorical Kabiri House in Khoy\n\nKhoy Airport\n\nStone gate of Khoy\n\nKabiri House\n\nKabiri House\n\nKabiri House\n\nMahlezan church\n\nTomb of Shams Tabrizi\n\nTomb of Shams Tabrizi\n\nStone gate of Khoy\n\nFamous places\n\n[edit]\n\nTomb of Shams Tabrizi, Shams Tabrizi Tower\n\nBastam and Bolourabad Castles\n\nKhatoon Bridge\n\nOld Stone Gate\n\nOld Bazaar\n\nMotallebkhan Mosque\n\nMount Avrin\n\nGhotour Iron Bridge[29]\n\nSurp Sarkis Church\n\nPourya-ye Vali\n\nNotable natives\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a complete list see: Category:People from Khoy\n\nMullah Nasreddin, satirical Sufi.\n\nJahan Shah, was the leader of the Kara Koyunlu oghuz Turks tribal federation in Azerbaijan and Arran.\n\nJaleh Amouzgar, is an Iranologist and a university professor.\n\nBehrouz Vossoughi, is an Iranian actor.\n\nTwin towns\n\n[edit]\n\nKonya, Turkey (since 2011)[30]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nDonboli (tribe)\n\nKhoy Khanate\n\nNor Shirakan\n\nZaravand\n\nMedia related to Khoy at Wikimedia Commons\n\nIran portal\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nAtabaki, Touraj (2006).
