One of the few surviving Drum journalists of Sophiatown of the 1950s, Nkosi has been a constant, if faintly heard, voice in literary discussions, both in South Africa and abroad. As a writer, he has achieved that brave crossover from critical to creative writing, the results of which then stand to be judged by his own exacting standards. His oeuvre is unusually diverse, including as it does plays, novels, short stories, critical essays and reviews, poetry, and even a libretto. For these individual reasons, combined with a sense that there is at present in South Africa a nostalgic mood that harks back to the Drum days, and even the Sophiatown days (witness the recent film on this era, plus Lionel Rogosin’s book on the making of Come Back Africa, a film whose script was co-written by Nkosi), it appears that Lewis Nkosi’s time might finally have arrived locally. In an attempt to provide both a critical perspective on Nkosi and a sourcebook useful to researchers, the present volume contains both commissioned chapters by academics currently engaged with Nkosi’s work and a section that reprints important critical essays by Nkosi, together with an extensive bibliography and timeline for this writer. These last two sections gather together, as in a jigsaw puzzle, pieces of Nkosi’s prolific writing-output; given the scattered and ephemeral nature of many of his publications over four decades and as many continents, this has been a daunting yet rewarding task. Still Beating the Drum is not proffered as the definitive conspectus on Lewis Nkosi, but as a first step in assessing the importance of his writing over a good number of years against the tectonic shifts in South African political history – his is a voice that has been critical and criticized; it has not always been an easy one to listen to, but the fact that it has endured and continues to speak gives the literary critic ample scope for a timely consideration of what he has had to say to us collectively. HE IMPETUS BEHIND THIS BOOK\n\n\\\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction Lewis Nkosi – Inscriptions\n\nT\n\nof essays on Lewis Nkosi will appear shortly after a proposed grand reunion of Drum writers in Johannesburg is partly coincidental. Our aim is not to produce a commemorative volume, nor to honour a senior member of South African letters. Rather, what we hope to do in this collection is to draw attention to a distinctive, dissonant but always acutely perceptive critic and creative writer, who has been largely heard only in brief ‘soundbites’ – for instance, the trenchant shebeen voice in Rogosin’s Come Back Africa, and the sharp caveat on “Fiction by Black South Africans” in his early collection of essays (1965); his short stories scattered like an archipelago across numerous journals, his hard-to-find poems, his work as a radio interviewer buried in archives, and his letters, which remain uncollected. This volume is the first work to gather together commissioned articles along with selections from Nkosi’s literary criticism, previously unpublished interviews, and a bibliography of his writings. Our intention is to provide both a resource and a critical intervention, another inscription on the emergent reworking of what constitutes South African letters, such as that evident in the recent collection of essays in Poetics Today (2001). HE FACT THAT THIS VOLUME\n\nCritical Voices A feature of the South African literary scene has long been its fragmented nature – because of the long history of censorship, of political oppression leading to exile, and the centrifugal and diverse energies of a linguistically and culturally plural set of traditions. The weight of the recent history of apartheid has smothered any possibility of a unified South African voice. Among a plethora of voices, nevertheless, Lewis Nkosi’s voice has always been distinctive. A direct approach, sometimes painfully direct, has been part of that voice – in the essay by Nkosi mentioned above (“Fiction by Black South Africans”), for example, his uncompromising comments show his\n\nxvi\n\nSTILL BEATING THE DRUM\n\n\\\n\nloyalty to form and to the stringent demands of a modernist conception of art in which sloppiness and a shortage of imagination had no part: With the best will in the world it is impossible to detect in the fiction of black South Africans any significant and complex talent which responds with both the vigour of the imagination and sufficient technical resources, to the problems posed by conditions in South Africa […] To put it bluntly nothing stands behind the fiction of black South Africans – no tradition, whether indigenous, such as energises The Palm-Wine Drinkard or alien, such as is most significantly at work in the latest fiction by Camara Laye […] black South Africans write, of course, as though Dostoevsky, Kafka or Joyce had never lived. Is it not possible, without sounding either superior or unpatriotic, to ask how a fiction written by people conversant with the history of the development of modern fiction can reveal no awareness of the existence of Notes from Underground, Ulysses or such similar works? For make no mistake about this, it is not an instance of writers who have assimilated so well the lessons of the masters that they are able to conceal what they have learned; rather it is an example of a group of writers operating blindly in a vacuum.1\n\nThe young Nkosi’s comments on art are quoted at length because they show what was to become his characteristic style: he does not bow to the contingent, neither is he unmindful of the challenges to the world of letters posed by the apartheid state. Nkosi’s harsh remarks predate the debate on the limitations of black South African writing which Njabulo Ndebele and then Albie Sachs returned to in 1984 and 1990. Nkosi’s early comments were long remembered as being in some way disloyal to the black cause, as Don Mattera points out in a brief, caustic article in New Nation on the 1991 New Nation Writers Conference, termed, ironically, “At the Feet of the Nomad Gods.” Shava’s aside in his book A People’s Voice (1989), that while “Nkosi is concerned with the problem of how to write, a great number of black South African writers are concerned with what to write about,”2 is in the same vein. Almost thirty years later after Nkosi’s seminal essay was published, his stance at the 1991 New Nation conference reveals his continuing commitment to the – for him – vital issues of form and the landscape of the imagination. On what he calls “the stranglehold of naturalism” in which black South African writing was still caught in the early 1990s he offers the following: 1\n\nLewis Nkosi, Home and Exile (London: Longmans, 1965): 131. Piniel Viriri Shava, A People’s Voice: Black South African Writing in the Twentieth Century (London: Zed, 1989): 152. 2\n\n\\\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nThe answer may lie in all the things we don’t want to talk about: a poor and distorted literary education, a political criticism which favours mediocrity over quality, and exclusion from all those cultural and social amenities which fertilise the mind and promote confidence and control over literary skills.3\n\nNkosi’s love affair with the work of Faulkner, Kafka, Joyce and high modernism meant that he was able to some extent to withstand the crippling pressures of the consciousness of ‘Otherness’, what Achille Mbembe calls “the burden of the metaphysics of difference (nativism).”4 Likewise, he has always been wary, in his critical work, of the other “dead-end,” termed by Mbembe “Afro-radicalism, with its baggage of instrumentalism and political opportunism.”5 Nkosi has positioned himself, somewhat iconoclastically, outside both these positions; and he has not embraced the position of the nationalist. As an outsider figure, he is not by inclination a party follower. In a recent paper “The Republic of Letters After the Mandela Republic” (reprinted in this volume), he runs through various definitions of ‘nation’ and the concomitant links with a ‘national culture’ and notes: “Whether or not it is desirable for literary texts to be asked to fulfil such a programme, our literature has never performed this function.”6 Nationalism, especially “an exclusive nationalism that is alternately cosy and corseted,”7 is a doubtful entity in Nkosi’s writing, one to be questioned carefully. He questions the possibility of ever reaching a unified notion of ‘nation’ in South Africa: The absence of any signified that could correspond to the idea of the nation is our almost generic condition, our particular affliction, bequeathed to us by an insolite history of racial division and racial oppression.8\n\nWhile Nkosi, then, does not espouse a nationalist position, he is adept at illustrating the national South African condition, particularly in his creative writing – see, for example, his 1964 play, The Rhythm of Violence, which deals with inter-racial infatuation and revolution in Johannesburg during 3\n\nLewis Nkosi, “Land – Metaphor for literary culture,” New Nation (13 December\n\n1991): 8. 4\n\nAchille Mbembe, “African Modes of Self-Writing,” Public Culture 14.1 (2002):\n\n240. 5\n\nAchille Mbembe, “African Modes of Self-Writing,” 240.

At times appearing to relish controversy, Lewis Nkosi’s influence as both a literary critic and a writer of fiction has been profound, as numerous reviews, references to his work and interchanges with his contemporaries confirm. After his departure from South Africa and his time at Harvard, he was able to gain access to a world of letters and a public outside the country. This, together with his critical opinions of South African literary creativity, has perhaps been the reason for the imbalance between his critical recognition within the country as opposed to beyond the country’s borders, including the rest of the continent (see Lucy Graham’s essay in this volume). Within South Africa, whatever critical notice Nkosi has received has been generally cautious; scattered, not sustained. He has, however, found mention in most important critical analyses of South African literature to have emerged since the 1980s, as the following examples indicate. His opinion that, in black South African writing, “autobiography is on the whole better than fiction” is mentioned alongside James Olney’s pronouncements on autobiography.9 Mbulelo Mzamane, in a paper given at the important conference on Literature and Society in South Africa at the University of York in 1981, cites Nkosi as a writer who, along with Can Themba, Casey Motsisi and others, uses both “traditional and Western literary forms of composition.”10 He is listed by Njabulo Ndebele, in an address at the 1987 C A S A conference in Amsterdam, as having been one of the South African writers in exile to have produced “outstanding scholarly works.”11 David Attwell refers to Nkosi’s frequently quoted essay “Fiction by Black South African Writers,” noting that the argument it raises predates by almost twenty years Ndebele’s reprise of the debate in 1994; and, further, that it prompted one of J.M. Coetzee’s essays on Alex La Guma, “written in response to Nkosi.”12 In the same essay, Attwell accuses Nkosi of making “a red-eyed remark” (118) on one of Gordimer’s novels with which he disagrees 9\n\nSarah Christie, Geoffrey Hutchings & Don Maclennan, Perspectives on South African Fiction (Johannesburg: Ad.

Michael Chapman’s influential Southern African Literatures (1996) draws on Nkosi a few times. He recalls Nkosi’s forthright opinion of the character of the Revd Khumalo in Paton’s classic; and he contrasts Nkosi’s Home and Exile (1965) and Tasks and Masks (1981) with Mphahlele’s The African Image (1962) and Voices in the Whirlwind (1968), judging the latter’s work to be developing a “broader cultural project” as opposed to Nkosi’s more subjective and fragmentary style.13 Nkosi’s essay on postmodernism appears in Jolly and Attridge’s important collection Writing South Africa: Literature, Apartheid and Democracy, 19701995 (1998). Generally speaking, beyond South Africa Nkosi’s reception has been more enthusiastic and sustained, though at times it also has been mixed. Neil Lazarus, for example, writing in the Southern Review, has defined Nkosi’s writing on Negritude as remaining “reconstructive and empirical in temper, never speculative,” unable to engage with “the domain of the phenomenological” and thus become “genuinely interpretive.”14 Nkosi’s interpretation of Negritude is, in our view, nothing if not ‘speculative’. Grasping the notion of the irrational, as embedded in Negritude, Nkosi links it to the early modern artist’s desire to encounter, through the works of Freud and Jung, the world of the unconscious which provided access to “the authentic personality behind the careful surfaces of civilised life.”15 Nkosi draws an analogy “between the riotous excesses of these movements at the beginning of the century and the equally turbulent birth of negritude as a gesture of rebellion against the stranglehold of Western culture.”16 Similarly, Louise Bethlehem, writing in the issue of Poetics Today already referred to, reads Nkosi too narrowly in our view: she argues that despite Nkosi’s critique of the kind of realism employed by Richard Rive, he shows a “conflictual adherence […] to crucial presuppositions of the naïve realism he deplores.”17 Nkosi is unfailingly critical of what he takes to be bad writing, not necessarily realism per se – hence his critique of Rive, yet approval of the early work of Alex La Guma, marred 13\n\nMichael Chapman, Southern African Literatures (Harlow, Essex: Longman,\n\n1996): 245. 14\n\nNeil Lazarus, “Measure and Unmeasure: The Antinomies of Lewis Nkosi,” Southern Review 23.1 (1987): 113. 15 Lewis Nkosi, Tasks and Masks: Themes and Styles of African Literature (Harlow, Essex: Longman, 1981): 20. 16 Nkosi, Tasks and Masks, 20. 17 Louise Bethlehem, “‘A Primary Need as Strong as Hunger’: The Rhetoric of Urgency in South African Literary Culture Under Apartheid,” Poetics Today 22.2 (2001): 372.\n\nxx\n\nSTILL BEATING THE DRUM\n\n\\\n\nonly, according to Nkosi, by his persistent choice of the restrictive canvas of the short story. Where Nkosi has attracted some of the sharpest criticism has been for what a few critics have called his sexism, even racial sexism. This allegation is primarily levelled at his fictional works, particularly Mating Birds (1986). Lazarus maintains that it is “undermined by […] a virulent and structuring sexism.”18 Henry Louis Gates, Jr., while complimenting the same novel for “confront[ing] boldly and imaginatively the strange interplay of bondage, desire and torture inherent in inter-racial sexual relationships within the South African prison house of apartheid,” nevertheless criticises the black protagonist’s slavish sexual obsession which detracts from any political critique within the novel.19 For Josephine Dodd, the work “reeks strongly of sweaty old male fantasy masquerading as literary sophistication.”20 André Brink’s angry critique of Mating Birds maintains that the book is undermined by Nkosi’s “private pathology.”21 However, others have read this novel quite differently: Ashcroft, Griffiths and Tiffin (1989) read Mating Birds as a struggle over the power of the word and pen in the apartheid world; Brian Worsfold (1996) interprets the novel as having at its heart “the sad state of European spirituality”;22 Lucy Graham (see her essay in this volume) finds Brink guilty in his own writing of some of the accusations he levels against Nkosi, and offers a reading of the novel as a modernist text which yields a complex symbolic enmeshment between race and sex. Nkosi, in the preface to the new edition of the novel in 2004, dismisses these critics by saying that “South African reviewers seemed disappointed that they were not getting another ‘township’ novel” of surfaces – rather, what he had wanted in Mating Birds was “the critique of the accursed doctrine [of apartheid] to emerge automatically out of the objective social relations between two individuals.”23 In vintage style, Nkosi answers the critics who accuse him of being preoccupied 18\n\nNeil Lazarus, “Measure and Unmeasure,” 116.

Whatever the case, the variety and range of possible interpretations speaks well for the complexity of Mating Birds, listed in the New York Times as one of the best 100 books published in 1986, and winner of the Macmillan International Silver Pen Prize (Macmillan / P E N Award) in 1987.\n\nBeginnings Despite the short time Lewis Nkosi spent at Drum, it remains a defining moment, a touchstone to which commentators return. The Drum era may have been, as Nick Visser termed it, a “renaissance that failed”;24 nevertheless, it represents a time of intense production, and a flowering of a truly local black urban culture. Sophiatown was, as Ulf Hannerz reminds us, a conduit of energies that were both local and transatlantic; Sophiatown was a “global ecumene”25 – interpreting American popular culture in a local idiom and in turn circulating the music of King Kong onto the stages of the London West End and thereby signalling it to the musical aficionadoes of New York. Nkosi takes with him from his Drum period the courage, the wit and the panache that marked the group. What is frequently overlooked, however, is the apprenticeship of his earlier schooling in Eshowe and the brief period of his journalistic apprenticeship at Ilanga lase Natal [Natal Sun], where his mentors were the Dhlomo brothers, Herbert (1903–56) and Rolfes (1906–71), both editors of the paper at the time. The intellectual tradition that Ilanga itself represented sprang from J.L. Dube’s belief in the resistant and proactive power of the print media, expressed through an African language. Nkosi’s admiration for H.I.E. Dhlomo in particular is evident in the poem he wrote on the occasion of H.I.E’s death (see the commentary piece on Lewis Nkosi’s poetry in Part One below) – recently, Nkosi reminisced, “When I was at high school everybody who knew H.I.E. Dhlomo called him simply ‘H.I.E.’. He was so iconic!”26 What is clear from this formative period is that Nkosi could see himself as already existing within a strong regional tradition of black intellectuals, including the versatile Dhlomo brothers – who were both journalists and creative writers, shapers of public opinion – and the giant figure of the poet Benedict Wallet Vilakazi (1906–47). It is this time that also provides him with a 24\n\nNick Visser, “South Africa: The Renaissance That Failed,” Journal of Commonwealth Literature 9.1 (1976): 42-57. 25 Ulf Hannerz, “Sophiatown: The View From Afar,” in Readings in African Popular Culture, ed.

Such an awareness enables him to appreciate the strengths of Amos Tutuola, writing in “the best tradition of the African oral idiom”27 at a time when many of his African – in particular Nigerian – readers found his style embarrassing. This deep appreciation of the imaginative and aesthetic landscape of the genres of orality in the African and South African context, and his familiarity with modern texts (such as the poetry of B.W. Vilakazi) in his mother tongue of isiZulu, is what enables him to identify what he sees as “the only major weakness” in J.M. Coetzee’s seminal text White Writing: On the Culture of Letters in South Africa (1988). As he puts it, There is no way, for example, in which Coetzee can find answers to some of the questions he has been asking except by drawing upon the evidence of traditional oral literatures and contemporary writing of the indigenous populations – questions such as: Is the African landscape readable only through African eyes, writeable only in an African language?28\n\nHome and Exile Paul Gilroy has claimed that the problem of weighing the claims of national identity against other contrasting varieties of subjectivity and identification has a special place in the intellectual history of blacks in the west.29\n\nLewis Nkosi, together with his fellow Drum writers, Nat Nakasa, Can Themba, Bloke Modisane and Arthur Maimane, can be said to exemplify this tension in the South African context. They took this desire to be part of a wider intellectual world with them into exile, a desire already apparent in Can Themba’s declamations of Shakespeare on the street corners of Sophiatown, Modisane’s playing of Brahms in his room in Gerty Street and Nkosi’s love of jazz and his early interest in modernism. All of the above were nourished, perhaps, by cosmopolitan Johannesburg of the 1950s and its bookshops (such as Vanguard), with their links to London, Moscow and New York. The excitement, energy and confidence in their own intellectual strengths and the 27\n\nLewis Nkosi, “African Writers of Today,” The Classic 1.4 (1965): 57.

Nkosi, based in London at the Transcription Centre in Norfolk Street, wrote to Nakasa telling him of his forthcoming schedules and planned interviews in various parts of Africa: Dear Nat, I should have written to you sooner, but things here are a bit hectic at the moment. The shipping line has only sent me a letter this week notifying me of the arrival of the Classic. Next week I should be in Paris on the first leg of a trip to several African countries where I am to do television interviews for National (American) Educational Television: these are to be with leading African writers and we start with Zeke and Senghor in Paris next week; then Kampala, Uganda, Nyasaland between August 14 and 15, and then Nigeria and Ghana. We should be in Nigeria and Ghana until the end of September.30\n\nCaptured in this extract is the seed of Nkosi’s sense of himself as a writer of Africa among other writers of the African continent, both anglophone and francophone. Nkosi, based, at this point in his career, with Dennis Duerden at the Transcription Centre, was able to carry through a crucial role as link and mediator with a variety of African writers and critics. The commitment to Nakasa and The Classic remained firm. In the same letter he tells Nakasa: As for the distribution of the Classic I have arranged with two bookshops to take some copies – Better Books and Colletts. They are the best bookshops in town for avant-garde taste and off-beat writing which may include the Classic by definition.31\n\nThe sense of himself as primarily a South African writer is set within a widening circle of continental and global identity. The historic African Writers Conference at the University of Makerere, Kampala, in 1962 which Nkosi attended marked a new configuration of pan-African literary presence on the continent. Language issues were hammered out in the paper by Obi Wala, and the Nigerian poet Christopher Okigbo wrestled with the question of the writer’s commitment to art versus political activism. At least one of Nkosi’s interventions at this conference had to do with the role of the writer 30\n\nLewis Nkosi, letter to Nat Nakasa. File 2, Nakasa Papers, Cullen Library, University of the Witwatersrand, 23 July 1963. 31 Lewis Nkosi, letter to Nat Nakasa, 1963.\n\nxxiv\n\nSTILL BEATING THE DRUM\n\n\\\n\n(see the essay by Chris Wanjala in this volume) – his position urges an untrammelled role for the writer, which nevertheless is not without its seriousness. He is not in favour of icons, nor a regimentation of what is expected. Nkosi’s multiple loyalties took him in a number of directions simultaneously. Since he wrote from his London base for, among other publications, Transition, The New African, The Guardian, Présence africaine, The New Statesman, Black Orpheus, The Spectator, The Times Literary Supplement and New Society , he was never able (or allowed, perhaps) to forget that he was a “native son.”32 But he did not allow that sense of a narrowly South African identity to prescribe his wider sense of himself as a writer and critic, loyal to language, not place – “for a writer language is everything,” he wrote in his preface to The Transplanted Heart.33 Exile has, then, been a double-edged sword for Nkosi: though cut off physically from South Africa, he has had to make himself ‘at home’ in exile, make movement and displacement his friends – even sources of inspiration. Without this he might not have been the prolific writer he has proved to be. In a recent essay on the subject of “Exile as Fetish,” he acknowledges that this is the path he has had to tread: In the rhetoric of exile discourse more is known about its traumas than about its pleasures, more about its physical anguish than its precarious rewards […] there is a grey area of ambiguity where an insecure knot is tied between pleasure and unpleasure. This is a complex process of avowal and disavowal in which a fetish as substitute and compensation for an object feared lost is paralleled in the discourses of exile by an individual’s attempt to find consolation in the pleasures afforded by asylum as the twin term and alternative of mothercountry.34\n\nPart of the ‘pleasure’ of exile for Nkosi has surely been the opportunities to engage with fellow African writers and critics, and with people of letters from a variety of literary milieux and locales. An early example of this can be seen in the series of interviews and talks which he conducted with the newly published writer Amos Tutuola; the founder of Penguin Books, Walter Allen; and Ulli Beier, editor of the Ibadan journal Black Orpheus. On one occasion, at the University of Ife, Nigeria, he and the young Wole Soyinka engaged the Ghanaian philosopher William Abraham on the subject of “the artistic obliga-\n\n32\n\nLewis Nkosi, The Transplanted Heart (Benin City, Nigeria: Ethiope, 1975): vii.

(Berlin: Humboldt University, 2005). 33\n\n\\\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxv\n\ntions of African authors.”35 This early vigorous engagement with writers and critics – Nkosi’s name, for example, is righttly linked with that of James Baldwin, the black American writer with whom he had a strong relationship and held in high regard36 – has become an established pattern. He has never become an isolated recluse, hugging exile. Rather, the eclectic links established soon after his Drum period have continued. He has on many occasions been a sought-after figure invited to speak at colloquia and conferences, valued as an astute critic of South African letters in particular. In recent years in Europe, to cite some examples, he has been invited to discuss South African literature on a panel organized by the Bibliothèque Nationale at the Pompidou Centre in Paris (2002), to do a reading of his work at the Humboldt University in Berlin (2003), and to give a paper at the “Exiles and Emigrés: South African Writers Writing Abroad” Festival in Cambridge, U K (2004). Moreover, the sense of Nkosi as a respected critic and writer confident within the domain of modern African writing has been sustained: he is more and more frequently asked to speak in South Africa – as, for example, in 2003 at the Durban “Time of the Writer” Festival, where he shared a platform with the Somalian writer Nuruddin Farah, chaired by the Cameroonian critic and philosopher Achille Mbembe (see Section 14.2 in this volume for an edited transcript of this discussion). A decade into the post-apartheid era, Nkosi remains based in Europe but visits South Africa frequently, a cosmopolitan figure, primarily at home in his writing. Even in a generation of exiles, in which movement (and sometimes debilitating stasis) became the norm, Nkosi’s trajectory has been remarkable: from its start in South Africa, it has included his stint as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard in 1960–61; London and the United Kingdom, his base for a decade as broadcaster, editor and writer; his subsequent academic career, which took him to Zambia, Poland and the U S A ; and currently his sojourn in active ‘retirement’ in Europe. Since the 1990s this trajectory has increasingly brought him back to South Africa for lecture visits, besides the frequent European and British engagements. Despite this nomadic existence, throughout a period of over forty years, Nkosi has maintained a steady and varied output. This has covered political journalism, drama, literary criticism, poetry, scriptwriting and fiction published in a variety of places, from established publishing houses like Longmans to little-known African publishers like Ethiope in Benin City; and in journals both narrowly literary and broadly political all\n\n35\n\nNkosi, “African Writers of Today,” 63.

What has emerged, we argue, is the profile of a literary figure with accumulated critical gravitas. As mentioned earlier, his long absence from South Africa during the apartheid years and the literary myopia imposed by the apartheid state on its citizens have meant that until recently he has been less known within South Africa than he is in other parts of Africa and Europe, his current home – an interesting example to cite in support of this point is that in the 1970s Nkosi’s Rhythm of Violence was a set work in Nigerian schools, his critical and political essays were published there, and in East Africa his reputation as a key black intellectual was assured, whereas within South Africa his was a muted voice. Now, however, in the new millennium, his standing in his old home is strengthened with the publication of his novel Underground People (2002), a re-issue of his 1986 novel Mating Birds by Kwela (2004), and an anticipated third novel, Mandela’s Ego, to be published in 2005. Together with his ongoing occasional critical pieces published locally (see “The Republic of Letters After the Mandela Republic” reproduced as Section 15.6 of this volume), Nkosi can be understood as a writer who has consistently written both creatively and critically. In an era when South Africa is positioned in a global and continental arena, Nkosi’s chosen cosmopolitanism can now be viewed as normative, as opposed to wayward or idiosyncratic. His consistently independent stance, coupled with his demonstrable desire to publish and be a voice within South Africa at this time, should be a dynamic force in the ongoing shaping of literature and letters in the new era. The purpose of this book, then, is, in a sense, to reintroduce Lewis Nkosi, in all his facets, to academic scrutiny. \\ This book is divided into two parts, each containing a number of sections. Part One comprises academic pieces on Lewis Nkosi’s work in various genres: The first section contains critical essays on Nkosi’s work as a literary critic. This is followed by a section of essays on Nkosi as dramatist for the stage and radio, together with an introduction to his small corpus of poetry. The third section focuses on Nkosi as novelist and is accompanied by the South African Censors’ Report on Mating Birds. Part Two is intended to serve as a resource for ongoing scholarship on Nkosi and is entitled “Lewis Nkosi in His Own Voice”; it contains a section with two hitherto unpublished recent interviews with Nkosi, and another with careful, re-edited selections from his seminal critical works – pieces chosen because we regard them as representative of the past and ongoing Nkosi oeuvre. Part Three contains a complete primary bibliography of his work, bringing together hitherto scat-\n\n\\\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxvii\n\ntered and ephemeral pieces across different media. This is a valuable resource, as a complete bibliography on Nkosi has not recently been attempted; in fact, Nkosi’s peripatetic life together with his generosity in writing for many sources has scattered his more ephemeral columns and reviews like so many leaves in the wind. We have also, for those interested in tracing Nkosi’s literary influence, included selected references to critical work on Nkosi. In an effort to trace the road travelled both physically and artistically by Nkosi, which, again given his extraordinary movement across the globe in his lifetime, has been a winding one, we have constructed a timeline which pulls together place, time and work. The geographical range of the writers whose essays are included in this volume indicates the spread of interest in Nkosi scholarship at present, both in South Africa and abroad. Our intent in compiling this book is to foster yet more critical interest in one of South Africa’s most talented thinkers and writers. \\ The first section of “Writing on Lewis Nkosi” explores his contribution as a literary critic. What emerges very clearly from each of the three essays in this section by Gagiano, Wanjala and Owomoyela is the range and the temporal sweep of his astute and erudite contributions to the changing debates that have raged from the late 1950s to the early years of the new millennium, and the selection from Nkosi’s writing near the end of the volume attempts to provide some access to his long critical reach, and to what Annie Gagiano calls his “enduring contemporaneity” as a literary critic. Gagiano’s essay explores, first, the consequences of exile for Nkosi’s critical writing and argues that the early period of exile enabled him to establish a rich network of links with other African and African-American writers. She concludes that a key part of his critical role in exile was that he was able to embed South African and African literature within a wider, mainly English-speaking literary sphere. The second part of her essay is a robust discussion of Nkosi’s major literary-critical contribution in terms of the literature of the continent, and in terms of South African literature. Here she is quite prepared to point out when Nkosi did not ‘get it right’ – for instance, when he dismissed Bessie Head’s work and Modikwe Dikobe’s Marabi Dance. She notes that his comments on Athol Fugard are both “sharp and devastatingly convincing” and, turning to his later work, points to his “marvellous sureness of touch” in his piece on Robinson Crusoe, in which he touches on the ability of the canonical texts of the colonizing culture to illuminate the perspectives of the colonized – something that he does quite some time before this became a major interest\n\nxxviii\n\nSTILL BEATING THE DRUM\n\n\\\n\nof postcolonial theorists. Chris Wanjala’s essay on Nkosi’s early criticism, which is both critical and admiring, explores his tendency to despair of much of the writing of his fellow South Africans in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as witness, in particular, his harsh words on the writing of Richard Rive. Perhaps, Wanjala suggests, he was too eager to give African literature an identity “mapped by European societies.” Nevertheless, Nkosi saw the need for both commitment and art, and for Wanjala this is an enduring and major contribution to the criticism of literature in Africa. Oyokan Owomoyela, like Wanjala, notes Nkosi’s ironic stance and his ability to give his readers a devastatingly honest view of a particular gathering. Thus his comment on the historic 1962 Kampala Writers Conference was that they were, especially the younger writers, “a company of literary cut throats,” and fiercely competitive. Owoyomola, while alerting the reader to Nkosi’s regard for the francophone Negritude movement (see the essay in Part Two), is critical of other aspects of his writing such as his inability to understand Mphahlele’s decision to return home to South Africa in 1990, which for Owoyomola was not an evasion but, rather, the logical outcome of the fact that he was “always thinking of those stuck at home.” Nevertheless, Owomoyola points out, the article in the Southern African Review of Books (to which Nkosi contributed extensively in the 1990s) on Es’kia Mphahlele at 70 is yet another reminder of Nkosi’s vitality as a critic through the latter decades of the last century and into the millennium. The second section of the first part of the volume pulls together a number of essays on Nkosi as dramatist and poet. While S’khumbuzo Mngadi’s focus is mainly on the best-known of Nkosi’s plays, The Rhythm of Violence, Liz Gunner writes on Nkosi’s contribution as dramatist to the B B C , with his play “We Can’t All be Martin Luther King”; essays by Astrid Starck–Adler and Therese Steffen discuss his unpublished play “The Black Psychiatrist,” and Nkosi’s small but interesting creative output as a poet is brought to our attention by Litzi Lombardozzi. Gunner’s piece, in common with other of the earlier contributions on Nkosi’s criticism, highlights the energy and productivity of Nkosi’s London years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which included his radio work at Dennis Duerden’s Transcription Centre. The littleknown radio play by Nkosi is a witty and important contribution to debates on race and identity in the fraught racial politics of that period in Britain; moreover, the encompassing of transatlantic identity politics in the play’s ambit demonstrates once again Nkosi’s truly cosmopolitan and transnational grasp of questions of African identity and the African diaspora. Mngadi, in a careful and nuanced analysis of The Rhythm of Violence, concludes, somewhat controversially, that it is an attack not so much on apartheid as on the class-based power that accrues to a small group of inter-racial protagonists.\n\n\\\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxix\n\nThe essays by Starck–Adler and Steffen, in their focus on the “The Black Psychiatrist,” take somewhat different approaches. Starck–Adler, whose essay combines a study of the play with comments on his novel Mating Birds, concludes that both works show the power of language as counter-discourse. Both works, she claims, open up to “somewhere else”; what is created is, as it were, a foreign language which leads to a re-creation of the past and a new way of apprehending reality. Thus, Starck–Adler argues, both works compel a redefinition and re-creation of the difficult areas of social life – race, sex, repression, violation – with which the works so powerfully engage. Whereas Starck–Adler, in her discussion of Mating Birds, points to the role of memory as liberation, even if it is “a compartmentalised, fragmented memory,” Steffen’s essay on “The Black Psychiatrist” foregrounds memory somewhat differently. In her analysis – and she draws on the ideas of Stuart Hall in his work on cultural identity and diaspora – the play provides a glimpse into the continuing ‘production’ of identity, one grounded not “in the archaeology but in the re-telling of the past.” The double standards of the slyly seductive Gloria, in fact, enable the black psychiatrist to reassert his personal and professional authority. Steffen concludes that the phantasm of the past that belongs to both protagonists “turns ‘The Black Psychiatrist’ into a parable of remembering and ‘disremembering’.” Lombardozzi’s recovering of Nkosi’s poetic output is largely of interest as a valuable exercise in retrieval which allows us to enlarge our sense of his many-sided engagement with making words work; also, we have a clearer sense of the multiplicity of cultural and linguistic influences that shaped him. Of particular interest, perhaps, is his poem in honour of the writer H.I.E. Dhlomo at his death in 1955. As indicated earlier, Dhlomo, one of Nkosi’s foundational heroes and models, was an editor of Ilanga laseNatal (the Natal Sun) in the brief period when Nkosi was employed there before moving to Johannesburg. The focus of discussion falls squarely on Nkosi’s fiction in the third section of Part One. Essays by Lucy Graham, Lindy Stiebel, Andries Oliphant and Raffaella Vancini tease out and debate the possible meanings and value of his two fictional works to date, Mating Birds and the recent Underground People. Set between the essays on Mating Birds is the censor’s report on the novel, a chilling reminder of the extent of state control over the minds of its subjects in the apartheid era as late as the mid- to late 1980s. Lucy Graham’s comprehensive and subtly argued essay takes to task a range of reviewers of and commentators on Mating Birds. She chides the South African reviewers of the novel for reading it, yet again, as another realist novel by a black writer, so underscoring the critical tendency to assume that white writers can be modernist and postmodernist, but black writers are realist. After giving the reader a vivid sense of the novel’s reception history and of the flawed re-\n\nxxx\n\nSTILL BEATING THE DRUM\n\n\\\n\nsponses to it, and offering her own reading, Graham asks: what does the novel hold for the post-apartheid reader? She maintains that its reception history poses questions yet to be answered by the South African literary establishment, concluding that the novel’s “transgressive discursive strategies and its subtle reckoning with the mind of apartheid” show a rare literary engagement with the cultural imaginary. Challengingly, she claims that although bonded to sexual obsession the novel is also associated with a yearning for liberation, of which a just future for human relationships forms a key part. Space, time and apartheid in relation to Mating Birds form the frame of Stiebel’s interesting exploration of place in the novel. In a trans-temporal discussion that moves from analysis of the novel to pacing the beaches and streets of the free present with the author, Stiebel notes the way in which Mating Birds is “predicated on spaces regulated by the apartheid state.” Her study challenges us to see the writer in history as well as in the world of fiction. She also points us to the trope of the locked gaze of the two ‘lovers’, and cites Homi Bhabha’s reading of Fanon as showing the black man wanting the objectifying confrontation with otherness; yet, Stiebel remarks, there is also, in Ndi Sibiya, the desire to possess Veronica’s identity and refusing, Fanonically, to be a ‘native’ and wishing to assimilate with the colonizer. She is thus suggesting an area of deep ambivalence in the novel itself. Andries Oliphant and Raffaella Vaccini concur on the centrality of irony to Nkosi’s novel Underground People, “a novel of ironic laughter,” as Oliphant calls it. The latter calls our attention to the way in which the text covers two recent periods in South African history simultaneously, the crisis of the 1960s and that of the 1980s. Also, he points to the doubleness of its narrative, its range of oppositions based on the trope of deceit, the play between appearance and reality. The two key protagonists of the novel, the eccentric Molapo and the expatriate South African Ferguson, who returns to the country to search for Molapo, are, Oliphant claims, “tossed about by the demonic irony of the world they find themselves in.” There is no stable order of meaning, only “the shifting verbal play of ideology, theories, fantasies and deceptions.” Raffaella Vaccini’s essay provides useful details on the genesis of the novel, on how it was sketched in rough while Nkosi was studying at the University of Sussex in 1978, and outlines the tussles and contradictions between the nationalist and socialist wings of the South African liberation movement – factors that can be said to feed into the ironic treatment of ideology in the fictional world of the novel. She directs us, too, to the hidden and intimate views of character that are to be found in the folds of the irony, its layered observations of people caught in situations beyond their control. \\\n\n\\\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxxi\n\nPart Two of Still Beating the Drum, “Lewis Nkosi in His Own Voice,” provides readers with the opportunity to ‘hear’ the voice of this complex and resilient man in two recent interviews recorded in his old home of Durban. The first interview is more of a private affair, with Nkosi speaking to a single interviewer, Zoë Molver, in a session filmed by David Basckin and forming part of an exciting project, funded by the National Research Foundation, on the recording of the literary history of KwaZulu–Natal. The second interview, from the Time of the Writer Festival, in 2003, held at the (then) University of Natal (now the University of KwaZulu–Natal), was a more public occasion. Here, Lewis Nkosi speaks to – and at moments, spars with – his fellow-writer Nuruddin Farah, with the philosopher Achille Mbembe playing the role of benign ringmaster. In the first interview, Nkosi speaks movingly of how he began to think of himself as a writer, a creator. He recalls seeing a young praise-poet or imbongi perform and then weep as he finishes praising, overcome with the sense of his own creative power. Nkosi himself then began to seek models for his own path as a creator in words, and found such works as Peter Abrahams’ Tell Freedom. But, he states, “my real ancestor [is] William Faulkner.” Nkosi responds interestingly, and honestly, to Molver’s question about the effect living in Europe has had on his writing. He admits that you have to readjust your perspective “without diminishing your concerns about your own local situation.” And again, giving the reader a glimpse of how he has in one way thrived and grown in exile, Nkosi speaks warmly of the fellowship of writers; the way in which exile “releases you into a wider world where you discover new communities, new alignments and therefore you construct new identities.” His words, in a way highy topical for the present time, thus position the writer both in a specific locale and in a wider transnational flow of emergent identities. Nkosi returns, in the more public interview of March 2003, to the topic of ancestors and writers, and once more states his great love for William Faulkner. Besides models, however, Nkosi is also adamant about the need to have a sense of audience. Returning to another figure whom he greatly admires, the poet–politician Léopold Sédar Senghor, Nkosi considers that the latter’s early poetry has been insufficiently recognized for its powerful rendering of the encounter between Africa and Europe. In sum, Nkosi, discussing his work as creative writer rather than as critic, speaks with candour of his own interest in the motives of his characters, and his interest in the psychoanalytical. And, provocatively, he dismisses the idea of a single South African nation, of any shared space that one could “remotely call a nation.” He is, he claims, interested in the broader canvas of history: “What happened to us” and “Why did we become what we are?”\n\nxxxii\n\nSTILL BEATING THE DRUM\n\n\\\n\nDebating ‘home’ A further section in this part of the book which records Lewis Nkosi ‘in his own voice’ reprints important articles from various periods of his career as a literary critic.37 First comes the seminal article “Fiction by Black South Africans” from Home and Exile (1965; enlarged as Home and Exile and Other Selections) in which Nkosi laments the lack of imagination and insufficient technique in what was called ‘protest’ writing of the time in South Africa. This is probably Nkosi’s most-cited article, as the number of chapters in this book which mention this piece confirms. In “Alex La Guma: The Man and His Work” from The Transplanted Heart: Essays on South Africa (1975), Nkosi compliments La Guma, and his novel A Walk in the Night, as an example of a South African writer who escapes the critique levelled in the previous reprinted piece in this book – he is a writer who combines “stunning precision” with a “bare-limbed economy” in his prose. From Tasks and Masks: Themes and Styles of African Literature (1981), the present book reprints “Negritude: New and Old Perspectives.” This essay has been chosen for the way in which it indicates how Nkosi’s critical range extends beyond South Africa to encompass African literature more generally – reviewing various earlier approaches to Negritude (including a tough dismissal of Mphahlele’s version), Nkosi proposes his own, new perspective, which posits Negritude as part of “an old, legitimate, even respectable intellectual tradition which goes back to Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason.” \\ Of his more contemporary writings, which urgently need collecting into a single volume, three have been selected for the different perspectives they provide on South African literature and literary criticism. The first is a review essay (1989) which comments on two works by white South African writers – J.M. Coetzee’s White Writing and Nadine Gordimer’s The Essential Gesture. In each of these, Nkosi questions whether a single national consciousness can be forged in a racially divided society. He also fearlessly tackles points about Coezee’s study which strike him as inadequate. He writes, for instance, that “there is no way Coetzee can find answers to some of the questions he has 37\n\nIt should be pointed out that, in order to fit the presentation of these republished pieces into the house style of the present volume, Nkosi’s essays and articles have been thoroughly re-edited. The results include changes in layout, occasional corrections, more precise documentation within footnotes supplied in the original texts, and a large number of supplementary notes aimed at clarifying the literary-critical situation for the present-day reader.\n\n\\\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxxiii\n\nbeen asking except by drawing upon the evidence of traditional oral literatures and contemporary writing of the indigenous populations.” He remarks that landscape poetry is indeed present both in the vernacular languages and in oral poetry. And, he asks, might the prose works of writers using the African languages “give us just as valid a description of African landscape as filtered through an African consciousness?” The second piece chosen is a review (1990) of the reissue of Bloke Modisane’s Blame Me On History, a gesture Nkosi describes as not only “an act of homage but [also] of conversion.” He recalls in his introduction the Drum days with Modisane, life in Sophiatown, and the “secret and not so secret dreams of the black intelligentsia during the naughty 1950s.” The last piece looks at what Nkosi calls “The Republic of Letters After the Mandela Republic” (2002), and provides a stocktaking of what this writer sees happening in South African literature post-apartheid – divisions still in place in terms of themes and approach, with it being too early, however, to distinguish a ‘national’ literature.\n\nPart Three: Sources for Lewis Nkosi The last two sections are intended to provide the reader with useful resources on Nkosi: Section 16 is an extensive bibliography which constitutes the fullest record to date of Nkosi’s published books, articles, occasional columns, numerous articles and interviews – a resource of value in that much of Nkosi’s prodigious literary output is scattered through many obscure (and also many well-known) journals and newspapers. Similarly, the Timeline constructed in section 17 attempts to pull together the threads of Nkosi’s loosely woven life, which has shifted from South Africa to the U S A , on to the U K , back to Africa (Zambia), then to Europe (Warsaw), back to the U S A (Boston), and on to Europe (Basel) again; not to mention his recent trips back to South Africa post-1991. The Timeline, in coordinating the first and subsequent appearance of his works, both major and minor, with the stages in his life, confirms how constantly productive Nkosi has been, despite his never-quite-exiled navigation through a world away from ‘home’.

Nevertheless, in surveying the more than three decades of Nkosi’s critical writing, while one has to take cognizance of his well-established stature as a literary commentator, a merely eulogizing approach to this body of work would be inappropriate and unworthy of him. In examining the two main collections of criticism – chiefly the reissued Home and Exile [and Other Selections] (1983) and Tasks and Masks (1981) – as well as a few other uncollected pieces, my approach will be evaluative, selective and intermittently chronological, speaking from my own perspective and experience as an academic working in English studies with a strong focus on African writing in English. In all his critical writing, judicious and far-sighted as it mainly is, Nkosi remains a unique and candid personality – never adopting the grey cloak of academic ‘objectivity’. As Shakespeare several times reminds us, cucullis non facit monachem;1 by contrast, Nkosi is always open, if often controversial and sometimes pugnacious. Though he speaks with the authority of both great knowledge of and full commitment to his subject, he is the very opposite of the aloof, anonymous commentator – he involves his reader,\n\n1\n\nOR ME, THREE ASPECTS\n\nLiterally, ‘The habit does not make the monk’; metaphorically, ‘Wearing the costume does not mean one can fulfil the role / be the real thing’; cf. Shakespeare, Measure for Measure V.i. 261, and Henry V I I I III.i.23.\n\n6\n\nANNIE GAGIANO\n\n\\\n\ndemanding (always) a thoughtful response, whether one agrees or disagrees with the point/s he articulates.2 And he is articulate: one of my favourite quotations from the collected criticism is Nkosi’s description of himself, newly arrived in Johannesburg from (what is now) KwaZulu–Natal, “with new English words clicking like coins in the pockets of [his] mind.”3 There is also, I think, a quality of energy and even urgency, often, in his writing – something of the excitement of the young man tasking himself to ‘tell it like it is’ (which characterized his early years as a Drum journalist) never seems to have left him, even as his sophistication as a citizen of the world and his range of reference increased. The range of adjectives and phrases Nkosi himself uses to illustrate the mood and mode of the Drum reporters – “urbanised, eager, fast-talking and brash” – as well as the description of “eliminat[ing] the thinnest traces of self-pity [… yet remaining full of] gaiety, lust and bravery”4 illustrates the quality I refer to, although as he aged this tone became tempered with more irony and perhaps a drier wit or wryness. Nkosi as critic never sees literature in isolation from the social context of its production, and Achebe’s dictum, that “art is, and was always, in the service of man”5 is a vision he shares, I believe. In recognizing the social context as the source of the work of art, as well as the authority or reality to which it is accountable, Nkosi in his criticism appears particularly conscious of powerstructures and agencies of control as the parameters within which writers function – but he never takes the sentimental and ultimately condescending view that (what he sees as) weak or naive writing can be condoned because of political constraints or a concern for African solidarity per se. In this consistently held position he can occasionally be excessively harsh in his strictures or almost stridently dismissive, but Nkosi cannot (on the other 2\n\nCf. D.H. Lawrence’s well-known words:\n\nA critic must be able to feel the impact of a work of art in all its complexity and its force. To do so, he must be a man of force and complexity himself, which few critics are. A man with a paltry, impudent nature will never write anything but paltry, impudent criticism. And a man who is emotionally educated is rare as a phoenix. The more scholastically educated a man is generally, the more he is an emotional boor.

Occasionally he is injudicious (as I shall illustrate below), but not for the above-mentioned kind of base reason. As he requires both social relevance (or concern) and intellectual skill from the authors and their works that he assesses, he evidently expects no less of himself, as critic, in his descriptions and analyses of those works and authors. Examples of occasions where Nkosi underrates or misjudges texts are few, but would include, for instance, his failure to see the promise in Lauretta Ngcobo’s admittedly flawed first novel, Cross of Gold (1981) – a text in which there are glimpses of the talent that would blossom in the later, unforgettable novel And They Didn’t Die (1990)6 – and his dismissal of Mongane Wally Serote’s magisterial To Every Birth Its Blood (1981) as “too chaotic, too dispersed, to offer anything more solid than mere moments.”7 One may argue that Mphahlele’s The Wanderers (1972) has its faults, but, very amusing and persuasive as Nkosi is in his forcefully articulated criticism of this novel, he seems to verge on malice in some comments8 on this text. I believe, too, that some of Nkosi’s (otherwise fairly generous and just) observations on Bessie Head – such as labelling her “politically ignorant” and saying “She has only this moral fluency of an intelligent, intensely lonely individual”9 – are shortsighted, underestimating the greater reach of Head’s writing, inclusive of, but also extending ‘beyond’ politics. To establish the pattern of my discussion at this point, I shall first address the issue of exile as it can be seen to impinge on Nkosi’s literary criticism textually, by discussing initially the broad issue along with the (brief) relevant excerpts from the reissued 1983 Home and Exile collection, the first of which occurs in the Introduction to that volume. Here, Nkosi refers (in a quotation) to the “complex fate” of exile, indicating that it was by emerging from South Africa that he “discover[ed]” the “passions […] preoccupations and […] [literary] ideals” that he shared with other African writers.10 This aspect of Nkosi’s particular, fairly benign experience of exile – being taken from the embeddedness of a life at ‘home’ yet encountering a larger African solidarity 6\n\nNkosi, “South African Writers at the Barricades,” Third World Book Review 2.1–2 (1986): 43. 7 “South African Writers at the Barricades,” 45. 8 See, for example, the cutting remark that the personal vindictiveness Nkosi imputes to Mphahlele’s writing strategy (in The Wanderers) appears “designed to massage an ego that swells visibly with every self-manipulation”; Nkosi, Tasks and Masks: Themes and Styles of African Literature (London: Longman, 1981): 98. 9 Nkosi, Tasks and Masks, 99 (my emphasis). 10 Nkosi, Home and Exile and Other Selections, ix.\n\n8\n\nANNIE GAGIANO\n\n\\\n\nand even a formerly undiscovered “self”11 in the process – can be contrasted with his own recorded impression that “to most Negro [ie African-American] poets severance from Africa has not only meant exile from ‘the scenes his father loved’ but has also meant a bitter and anguished exile from the self” (104). On the whole, Nkosi’s exile seems to have been experienced, rather, as an escape from the many constraints and containments imposed by the white nationalist regime of the early 1960s in South Africa; a freedom that could be embraced and explored intellectually as well as socially and politically.12 My impression, from reading Nkosi’s essays, is that living abroad and frequenting mostly avant-garde intellectual gatherings (as he did) intensified his critical confidence – it equipped him for, and provided him with, more occasions for more varied intellectual debate; richer reading opportunities; as well as academic employment and experience.13 Exile also recontextualized South and continental-African literature for him through the wider, fuller and closer contact it gave him with metropolitan literatures. Nkosi did not ghettoize South/African literatures, but contextualized them by means of these personal opportunities. It is also likely, I venture to suggest, that the critically maturing effect of exile within the intellectually privileged spheres in which he moved intensified his resolve not to eulogize South/African texts or authors he deemed unworthy. He may (in any case) never have been inclined to mere politeness or political correctness, but exile surely strengthened the astringency, authority and scrupulousness of Nkosi’s literary criticism. If exile is an inevitable loss, then – as Nkosi acknowledges – his sense of also gaining by it was strong. He acknowledged this very frankly by declaring that “homesickness is not an emotion I frequently experience”; he likens it to “boredom.”14 Trinh T Minh-ha compares the role of the exile who remains committed to her or his original culture while being open to the new cultural context (and the opportunities for ‘spreading’ the original culture) – as Nkosi was and is – to that of a ‘translator’ from the one to the other: “Translations,”\n\n11\n\nNkosi, Home and Exile and Other Selections, ix. The liveliness of the ‘autobiographical’ essays in Home and Exile (which I mostly omit from my discussion of Nkosi’s literary-critical writing in this essay) makes one hope that he could be persuaded to write a full-length autobiography. 13 Compare Edward Said’s description: “As every situation is a new one, you start out each day anew”; Said, “The Voice of a Palestinian in Exile,” Third Text 3–4 (1988): 48, and Trinh T. Minh-ha’s reference to language as the “site of return [… of] memory,” but also as “a site of change, an evershifting ground” for the exile; Minh-ha, “Other than myself/my other self,” in Travellers’ Tales: Narratives of Home and Displacement, ed. George Robertson et al. (London & New York: Routledge, 1994): 10. 14 Nkosi, Home and Exile and Other Selections, 94. 12\n\n\\\n\nLewis Nkosi as Literary Critic\n\n9\n\nshe writes, “mark the continuation of the original culture’s life. […] The original is bound to undergo a change in its afterlife.”15 It may be with more of a feeling for other exiled writers than from any predominance of personal anguish, then, that Nkosi acknowledges both the pain and the danger of being cut off from ‘one’s people’: “a writer […] needs his people,” he writes, “in order that they should corroborate [his] vision […] or at least […] dispute [his] statements” about them.16 He knows that, in prolonged exile, “memory can no longer bear the burden of immediacy”; the writer’s “messages” to his people “begin to assume a strange unreality, if not features of a lunacy” (94, 93). Aside from “the pleasures of exile” (to appropriate George Lamming’s title, 1984), its pains are in Nkosi’s case felt to be endurable, because involving an enduring duty: although (he says) “any writer living in exile begins to wonder just whom he is addressing,” he expresses a solemn sense of writers having a “national duty” to those left behind, to be performed “by embodying the unspoken thoughts and emotions of their people.”17 His awareness of his own responsibility, “to preserve for the world the memory of [the] millions [he] left behind in South Africa” (95), is reminiscent of his compatriot and fellow-exile Arthur Nortje’s famous words: “for some of us must storm the castles / some define the happening.”18 Nortje was eventually overwhelmed, it is widely believed, by the way in which he suffered exile; by contrast, Nkosi (as long ago as 1980) robustly foresaw the post-liberation period when “writers [who] share[d] a community of interest with the vanguard party and the people” would (he then imagined) be seen as “making the unwarranted intervention between the government\n\n15\n\nTrinh T.

Cf: “as writers we must continue to be the unsilenced voice of the repressed millions of South Africa” (95). Unfortunately, Nkosi’s collection of essays titled The Transplanted Heart (1975) was unavailable when this essay was being written; among the literary figures it deals with are Can Themba (in an obituary) as well as La Guma and Herman Charles Bosman. Home and Exile does, however, reprint a number of the essays from the 1975 text. 18 Arthur Nortje, Anatomy of the Dark: Collected Poems, ed. Dirk Klopper (Pretoria: U of South Africa P, 2000): 361. It would be a fascinating study to compare the careers in exile of Nkosi (who may be said to have flourished) and of Nortje (who declined to the point of – probable – suicide), or of Nat Nakasa (who jumped to his death in New York). 16\n\n10\n\nANNIE GAGIANO\n\n\\\n\nand the people”19 – a point resembling Fanon’s warning against the postliberation “Pitfalls of National Consciousness.”20 Trinh Minh-ha’s poetic evocation /analysis of exile’s complexities can serve to conclude this section of my essay. Of the exile’s journey, she says (in words deeply applicable to Nkosi’s role outside South Africa): Every voyage is the unfolding of a poetic. The departure, the cross-over, the fall, the wandering, the discovery, the return, the transformation. […] The complex experience of self and other (the all-other within me and without me) is bound to forms that belong but are subject neither to ‘home’, nor to ‘abroad’; and it is through them and through the cultural configurations they gather that the universe over there and over here can be named, accounted for, and become narrative.21\n\nNkosi, I believe, through the particular way(s) in which he responded to the conditions of his exile – in what he made of it – played an important part in linking South / African literature into the larger (mainly English-speaking) literary sphere. \\ In the next section of this essay, I wish to discuss how and to what extent Nkosi can be seen as having succeeded, in his literary-critical contributions, in combining “the ideals of creating a literature for the continent that would be judged on its own terms,”22 with the aim of “preserving the best from [his people’s, or South / African] tradition and absorbing the best from outside.”23 As the above quotations indicate, I shall in this section be drawing mainly on the essays collected as Home and Exile and Other Selections (dated 1983, though it contains a number of essays that were written from the 1960s on) and the more cohesive text that I shall be considering, Tasks and Masks: Themes and Styles of African Literature (1981). The forceful style and forthright tone that will remain hallmarks of Nkosi’s critical writing are evident already in his early essays. He describes Alan Paton’s then almost universally celebrated novel Cry, the Beloved Country (1948) as “a powerful, if sentimental, plea for racial justice and peace” –\n\n19\n\nNkosi, Home and Exile and Other Selections, 162.

Long before Homi Bhabha came to identify the “sly civility” of the colonized towards the colonialists,25 Nkosi outlined “the ever-present irony beneath the mock humility” of most black South Africans – in contrast to Paton’s pious, ever-courteous Stephen Kumalo (5). Nkosi’s engagement with South African texts, unsurprisingly, features prominently in his criticism. It is predictable that he should discuss Es’kia Mphahlele’s work as extensively as he does, both because of Mphahlele’s prominence on the South African cultural scene and because he had got to know him so well when they were fellow-reporters on Drum. It is equally clear, even though Nkosi’s analysis of the Mphahlele phenomenon is generally highly interesting and enlightening, that there is something like a disjuncture of personalities between these two influential presences on the ‘international African stage’. Even so, in the earlier references to Mphahlele’s writing (in Nkosi’s criticism), he accords him a great deal of respect, setting Mphahlele off, for instance, from “the other black South African writers” in his recognition that the local racial-political scenario, far from being a “gift” (as ideal subject-matter) to aspiring authors, presented very tricky material indeed (133). He pays tribute to Mphahlele for “saying something positive about black experience in South Africa” instead of presenting black citizens as mere victims of oppression (133). He recognizes that Mphahlele is doing interesting things, linguistically, in the way he uses English to reflect the black voice and vocabulary in his short stories, although these developments are contrasted (by Nkosi) with what he judges to have been rather dull and turgid earlier writing by Mphahlele; what Mphahlele is developing by the late 1960s, in Nkosi’s estimation, amounts to successful resistance to the “melodramatic [nature of the] situation” in which black South Africans find themselves (135). The tone Nkosi adopts in early comments on Mphahlele’s cultural-philosophical position (dating from 1962) combines empathy – “to be a black South African is to be both unspeakably rich and incredibly poor; and also […] to live in perpetual exile from oneself” – with acerbic irony: he refers, for instance, to Mphahlele’s “sometimes too joyous […] affirmation […] that 24\n\nNkosi, Home and Exile and Other Selections, 5.

In Tasks and Masks, Nkosi includes a much fuller account (in the chapter “Negritude: New and Old Perspectives”26) of Mphahlele’s arguments with the proponents (mostly but not exclusively from West Africa) of the philosophy of Negritude. Acknowledging that explaining its central ideas is an “onerous” task, Nkosi does so with telling wryness – it “require[s],” he says, “an amount of patience, fairness and impartiality that is often beyond the capacity of any one critic” (10). The essay, I would say, comes close to achieving those qualities and is a fine embodiment of Nkosi the urbane (but non-condescending) cultural critic; this essay has that quality of “worldliness” that Said advises the critic to aim at,27 but is also ‘worldly-wise’ in its sophistication and balance. He suggests, for instance, that “Mphahlele’s difficulties with the more fervent adherents of Negritude, and they with him, are as much the result of emotional entanglements as they are the consequences of genuine intellectual disagreements” (16). Nkosi distinguishes between the validity of Mphahlele’s literary criticisms of art committed to the expression of the Negritude philosophy and what he sees as the political and intellectual shallowness of some of Mphahlele’s other strictures against this movement (17–18). In contrast to his compatriot, Nkosi hence asserts (in his conclusion) that Negritude “must continue to provide an area of legitimate interest for any student of African Literature” (27).28 It is clear that history has borne him out. In his assessment of Mphahlele’s The Wanderers (1972), Nkosi says some of the harshest things he has penned as a literary critic. Painfully ‘personal’ as some of the points made are, and although one may not agree that this novel is anything like as poor as Nkosi makes it out to be, the way the text is panned cannot be dismissed as the result of a mere private ‘anti-Mphahlele’ animus. Indeed, one of the earliest points made here is that, despite what Nkosi feels to be its overtly, thinly disguised autobiographical qualities, he measures The Wanderers against Mphahlele’s actual, earlier autobiography, Down Second Avenue (1971) – generously and aptly described as a “splendid” work.29. Nkosi validates his fiercely dismissive comments in lucid and convincing ways. I would nevertheless suggest that the commentary on the novel is intermingled with and (perhaps inevitably) also does express feelings of personal dislike, such as the sneer at Mphahlele as “the entrepreneur of Afri26\n\nNkosi, Tasks and Masks, 10–29.

Hence, partly convinced as one may be at the end of this account that the novel is “in many ways” (as outlined in full detail by Nkosi) “a distressing work,” the commentary is itself, in a word, somewhat distressing.30 One of Nkosi’s best-known essays is the piece “Fiction by Black South Africans” that appeared in collections in 1967 and 1973 before being printed in Home and Exile (131–38), with its arresting opening declaration: With the best will in the world it is impossible to detect in the fiction of black South Africans any significant and complex talent which responds with both the vigour of the imagination and sufficient technical resources, to the problems posed by conditions in South Africa. (131)\n\nIt is easy to see how annoying and ‘disloyal’ many would have considered this astonishingly forthright admission, or accusation, for providing grist to the mill of those already all too inclined to denigrate the achievements of black South Africans, coming (incontrovertibly) from the pen of a prominent black South African writer and cultural critic.31 As the essay proceeds, Nkosi does single out Alex La Guma’s writing for praise, however – as he distinguishes between achievements in the autobiographical and short-story genres and general failures in novel-writing. Here, Nkosi “pay[s] tribute” to Alex La Guma’s “impressive short novel” A Walk in the Night (1967), praising the writer as “a true novelist” with “the artist’s eye for the interesting detail” and notes “the suggestive power of his prose” (137–38). Another aspect of this essay that ensures its enduring relevance and importance is the way it forestalls points that Njabulo Ndebele would later make, most famously in the 30 Compare Nkosi’s 1986 reference to Afrika, My Music (1984) as “Mphahlele’s self-serving apologia for returning to South Africa and (is it unwittingly?) collaborating with the merchants of apartheid”; Nkosi, “South African Writers at the Barricades,” 45, a remark which comes close to slander. To be contrasted with this is his generous yet critically balanced retrospective essay on Mphahlele as a public and literary figure: Nkosi, “Es’kia Mphahlele at 70,” Southern African Review of Books 3.3–4 (1990): 32–34. 31 Indeed, J.M. Coetzee, in two of his early essays, quoted Nkosi’s paragraph to ‘speak for’ him: see “Alex La Guma and the Responsibilities of the South African Writer,” Journal of the New African Literature and the Arts 9–10: (1971): 3, and “Man’s Fate in the Novels of Alex La Guma,” Studies in Black Literature 5 (1975): 11 – while assessing La Guma’s A Walk in the Night (1967) very differently from the way Nkosi does.\n\n14\n\nANNIE GAGIANO\n\n\\\n\nessays “Turkish Tales and Some Thoughts on South African Fiction” and “The Rediscovery of the Ordinary: Some New Writings in South Africa.”32 Where Ndebele would caution against what he refers to as depiction of the “spectacular” aspects of the apartheid situation and the reliance on stereotypes of (black) victimhood and (white) oppression,33 Nkosi warns against “the over-melodramatic nature of the political situation,” and denounces “the journalistic fact parading outrageously as imaginative literature.”34 Nkosi makes a point that is closely comparable to Ndebele’s later insistence on the literary recognition of “positive” aspects of “black experience in South Africa.”35 He has nothing “positive” to say, however, about Richard Rive’s Emergency (1970), which he dismisses rather too emphatically as “wholly unimaginative, totally uninspired and exceedingly clumsy in construction.”36 In the later Tasks and Masks chapter called “Southern Africa: Protest and Commitment” (76–106), he acknowledges, however, that “South African literature has always been a literature of protest and social commitment in whose mirror the nation hopes to catch glimpses of its face” (76) – even though, he adds, what are then perceived as distorted images are so often subsequently denounced. Nkosi here links up with his earlier essay (referred to above) by saying that his “complaints” about literature by black South Africans were never a dismissal of the legitimacy of protest, but that “how well, and how significantly, it utters that protest” (79) was the point at issue for him. He now adds a further recognition: the much harsher and nearly irreversible erasure of “a usable [African] tradition” in the South (as contrasted with the continental) African context, resulting in its “peculiar insecurities and rootlessness” (79– 80). In what follows, Nkosi rejects Modikwe Dikobe’s The Marabi Dance (1973), a work which has proved to be of more enduring interest than he foresaw, while he has strong but qualified praise for Golden City, a 1970 text by Enver Carim that has been all but forgotten. Nkosi also has some praise (albeit more criticism) for another work by Carim, but by comparison (and 32\n\nBoth in Njabulo S.

This is what Ndebele phrases as “the rediscovery of the ordinary” (Rediscovery of the Ordinary, 37). Compare Nkosi’s critical reference elsewhere to “stereotyped figures of protest and oppression” (Home and Exile, 125). Nkosi also anticipated (as he himself points out) Albie Sachs’s 1989 “exhortations” that culture should not be confined to the role of a weapon of political struggle; Nkosi, “Sole and the Symptoms of Nervous Breakdown,” Current Writing 6.2 (1994): 55, 58. 36 Nkosi, Home and Exile, 136 (my emphases).\n\n\\\n\nLewis Nkosi as Literary Critic\n\n15\n\nsomewhat surprisingly, from the vantage-point of the twenty-first century) here damns Alex La Guma’s writing with faint praise – ascribing to it merely “an honourable, if dull proficiency” (86). It is also noticeable how little Nkosi writes here about La Guma, by contrast with the length of his engagement with Carim’s writing, even when he is sharply critical of it – one of Nkosi’s (few) lapses of critical judgement, in my estimation. A later essay, not forming part of the pieces collected in the 1981 and 1983 compilations I mainly deal with here, is Nkosi’s reassessment of Bloke Modisane’s reissued autobiography Blame Me On History (1990), an excellent essay in Nkosi’s most elegant and assured manner, imbued with sardonic candour and a kind of hidden compassion. The article becomes a meditation on the notable achievements of black South African authors in the autobiographical genre: “the single area of ‘lived’ experience,” Nkosi writes, where “the true voice of the black majority remains paramount.” He comments here on the “immense” range of ‘black’ autobiographical writing, adding that this “constitute[s] the most significant source of what knowledge we have regarding the feel and texture of black life in South Africa.”37 It is a memorable and finely wrought piece, an example of Nkosi’s best criticism. Nkosi provides interesting perspectives on some white South African authors, both personally (Breytenbach; Fugard) and critically (Fugard; Gordimer; Paton). I strongly agree with Nkosi’s assessment of Paton’s Too Late the Phalarope (1953) as a much more accomplished novel than Cry, the Beloved Country (1948). He refers with warm enthusiasm to Phalarope as “still […] the best embodiment of those confused and troubled emotions which exist sexually between black and white South Africans.”38 (Compare his assessment, cited earlier in this essay, of Cry, the Beloved Country.) Yet Nkosi now acknowledges that “there was, after all, something more than a lofty moral tone in that first novel (Cry, the Beloved Country) that compelled attention.” He still maintains, nevertheless (in the later essay), that the evident “urgent moral purpose” of the text acted as the screen to its “flaws” (159, both quotations). Nkosi speaks with respect of Nadine Gordimer’s work, referring, for instance, to its “passion and precision” (163). He also quotes her as a critic worth listening to and lists “Gordimer, Paton, Jacobson, Breytenbach” as the authors “who remind the white public” of things they’d prefer to forget.39 His review of July’s People opens with the memorable (and frequently quoted) statement: “In South Africa everyone dreams about revolution; that is, every37\n\n“Bloke Modisane,” Southern African Review of Books 3.3–4 (1990): 12.

Here one can compare his general impression, elsewhere expressed, of white authors’ “inability to see and underline the fantastic ambiguity, the deliberate self-deception, the ever-present irony beneath the mock humility and moderation of speech” of black South Africans.43 While Nkosi has warm personal recollections of the eccentric Fugard, his readings of the quality of the playwright’s portrayal of the fabric of black social life are sharp and devastatingly convincing. He exposes, for instance, Fugard’s misrepresentation of the moral poles of black life as lying between white ‘law and order’ and black gangster rule: “both forces were evil and the choice was an illusion” (141). He also notes (about the play Nongogo) that Fugard “could not and really did not know anything about the life of an African prostitute” (142). Nkosi’s criticism of Fugard’s The Blood Knot is astute: he makes the point that the racial schematization of the play results in an essentializing, reductive (stereo)typification of black (and white) South Afrians along all too familiar apartheid-type lines. Nkosi, overall, balances his assessment of the latter play convincingly – on the one hand, suggesting that it contains something “dangerous” because it “passes as ‘liberal’” while not challenging fundamental racial stereotypes and, on the other, presenting it as a vivid evocation of “the South African situation,” a depiction that he finds “enormously truthful and exciting” (144–45). Nkosi recognizes that African-American poets also struggle to achieve authenticity. One of his essays is called “Africa in Negro American Poetry” and in it he says sardonically: “after all mangoes are only mangoes and much too much mango is bound to be cloying even to a virile Negro menaced by the neoned American night” (105). In this essay, Nkosi identifies a primary 40\n\nNkosi, Home and Exile, 157.

Although the essay placed next in the reissued Home and Exile is one in which a “strained gestural embrace of American Black Power rhetoric” evidently embarrassed the older, more urbane Nkosi (whose voice we hear in the Preface referring to the above-mentioned text), it strikes a different note, which in the Preface is identified as that of (presumably ambivalence-free) “separatist black nationalism.”44 As usual, though, even in the “Black Power” essay Nkosi acknowledges his conjoint desire to belong to the world-wide aristocracy of letters and to retain an African solidarity (107). He expresses his belief, nevertheless, that “the New Africans” can “mov[e] easily between the old and the new worlds” and that they “are the only ones who can bridge the gulf between the old [presumably African] culture and the new technological civilisation” (111). To some extent acknowledging the centrifugal pull of these different loyalties, Nkosi offers a ‘solution’, in this uncharacteristically rambling piece, that is somewhat vague and mystical: it is, he says here, “the function of literature […] to provide an atmosphere of love” and to communicate “all those sentiments which bind us to one another in a great compassionate humanity” – writers need “to proclaim the primal value of Life over the Idea” (116–17). In a later (1971) essay, he reverts to the idea of a cultural dichotomy, especially in the work of African-American poets – “an underlying conflict between the steady, studied measures of classical English verse and the sweeping cha"
