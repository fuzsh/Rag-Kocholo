        "text": "The Modisane and Hughes connection reinforced these ties. At the beginning of their exchange, Modisane was despondent, displaced with no stable income and hoping to get proceeds from the publication of the story. In a letter dated October 20, 1960, he described his situation thus:\n\n“I believe the definition for a struggling artist is: a man, creative artist by repute, who lives on the advance of the next work. I drift from job to job, working my guts out by day and writing by night. I’m 36 and like ‘Simple’ I haven’t worked my way through to the first alimony, but I’m told there’s hope yet, except that ‘hope’ and I have been buddies for a long, long time… But I keep hoping (there’s that word again) that maybe some day I’ll get published in a glossy and make me enough [money] to live on while I write my first book; you know, the great South African novel, will out-sell the Bible.”\n\nIt would not take long before their connection developed into an intimate bromance punctuated with regular letters, exchange of gifts, occasional visits and partying. The frequency of the letters tells of a burgeoning camaraderie and organically fast-growing friendship. The two struck one of the most iconic yet underrated transatlantic friendships of the 1960s. Of all the prominent personalities that Hughes exchanged letters with across the world, his communication with Modisane stands out as the most intimate and sensuous correspondence rendered in lyrical prose.\n\nHe proposed to Modisane that “maybe we can have luncheon or dinner together or something.” Indeed, they met and, from this point, their relationship was propelled to another level. They transitioned from Modisane addressing his counterpart as “Mr Hughes” to “Langston,” then “Lang,” and ultimately, “My American Bantu.” Hughes, on the other hand, moved from initially addressing Modisane as “Mr Modisane” to “Bloke,” then “Blokie,” and ultimately “My Favourite Bantu.” In that, the dialogue was no longer limited to publishing and literature, but encapsulated the whole gamut of life, particularly issues pertaining to daily struggles, falling in love and being Black in an oppressive state. Following their first encounter in person, Hughes was still upbeat about their meeting, as he wrote in December 1960: “I am still remembering that delightful little party at your place, and I enjoyed meeting Todd, Jimmy, Sonny, and the others very much. It was fun….I’m sending you my blues record today. And when the African one is ready, it will be along, too.”"
