        "text": "The present paper proposes an examination of instances from Lewis Nkosi's novel Mating Birds (1983), in order to show how the text exposes racism under apartheid through the balanced use of language and silences. Firstly, there is an exploration of issues concerning the relationship between society and apartheid from a historical perspective – this is crucial to understand how space becomes relevant in the configuration of the narrative. Secondly, the analysis focuses on two questions: a) how the English language created a hybrid protagonist whose lack of belonging is the ultimate consequence of apartheid; and, b) how meaningful silence is for the interpretation of the novel. In the interaction that takes place among the uses of language and silence, social space and apartheid policies the author revives features of the South African oral tradition in a narrative that combines future, present and past in \" an ever-unfolding now \" (Edwards, 2008, p. 41). Resumen El presente trabajo examina instancias de la novela de Lewis Nkosi Mating Birds (1983), para mostrar cómo ésta expone el tema del racismo durante el período de apartheid a través del uso del lenguaje y los silencios. Primeramente, se exploran cuestiones relativas a la relación existente entre sociedad y apartheid desde una perspectiva histórica – esto es crucial para comprender cómo el espacio adquiere relevancia en la configuración de la narrativa. Luego, el análisis apunta a responder dos preguntas: a) cómo la lengua inglesa permitió la creación de un protagonista híbrido cuya falta de pertenencia es la consecuencia final del apartheid; y, b) qué significativo resulta el silencio para interpretar la novela. En la interacción que tiene lugar entre los usos del lenguaje y del silencio, el espacio social y las políticas del apartheid, el autor revive las características de la tradición oral sudafricana en una narrativa que combina futuro, presente y pasado en \" un ahora permanente \" (Edwards, 2008, p. 41).\n\nSouth Africa is a heterogeneous society, consisting of diverse races, cultures, and identities. Its history was marred by racial conflicts, violence and bloodshed. It was known as the land of apartheid. Those, who colonized South Africa, strengthened with the passage of time and introduced apartheid, otherwise known as racial segregation. Literature was severely affected and restricted for a long time in South Africa. Writers like Lewis Nkosi were banned to write and publish. In the absence of literary growth, literary criticism scarcely had any place in the society. In an area where critical theories are absent, under severe repression and censorship Nkosi’s distinguished career as a literary critic, over four decades is amazing. He contributed to the growth of the African aesthetics strictly based on African values. This paper attempts to analyze Lewis Nkosi’s contribution to African critical literary tradition by examining his essays\n\nLewis Nkosi’s reputation is largely based on his acute and unflattering analysis of South African cultural production rather than on the short stories and plays that he published in the nineteen sixties. Indeed, hardly any critical commentary on the South African literary scene remains untouched by his 1965 seminal essay, ‘Fiction by Black South Africans’. In fact, such has been its impact on the South African literary debate that Lewis Nkosi has had to consistently defend and constantly elaborate on it in his subsequent essays.\n\nCan Themba’s iconic story, “The Suit” (1963), tells of a devastating punishment visited upon an adulterous wife, Matilda, by her husband, Philemon. This article begins by examining some implications of Themba’s story and touching on subsequent adaptations that have re-imagined this haunting tale from various perspectives. I then move on to consider two stories by Makhosazana Xaba (2013) which add significant elements to the original fable. “Behind ‘The Suit’” is written in epistolary form by Philemon’s dying male lover to his daughter, thus queering the narrative. “‘The Suit’ Continued: The Other Side” is recounted in first-person narration by Matilda, after her suicide. It delineates the affair between Matilda and another woman, and their plan to have a baby, adding further queer temporalities. Citing theorists of queer and bisexual temporalities, I provide a close reading of the effects Xaba creates in her re-fashionings of Themba’s Ur-text. I argue that both stories critique hetero-patriarchy; they queer marriage, procreation, Sophiatown, black communities and the South African nation; and they contribute meaningfully to postcolonial queer writing and reading.\n\nOffering a reading of Mongane Wally Serote’s Revelations (2010) alongside other recent novels by black South African writers, this essay answers calls for more careful analyses of the roles that race plays within post-apartheid literature and culture. As it questions the shift away from a concern with institutional racism and white supremacy that is evident in much contemporary South African criticism, the essay contends that post-apartheid literature is not only racially marked, but also continues to produce knowledge on racial inequality, racial ideology, and resistance. In the process, it illustrates that grappling with colorblindness challenges pervasive understandings of nonracialism, reconciliation, and post-1994 literature. Revelations portrays nonracialism and reconciliation as necessary and inevitable, yet shows that the discourses are in conflict with demands for equality and justice. Concurrently veiling and revealing paradoxes inherent in South Africa’s dominant racial discourses from within, Serote’s novel demonstrates that enforcing colorblindness is an act of epistemic violence: not even at the diegetic level is nonracialism achievable.\n\nTatamkhulu Afrika's life story is often presented in triumphalist terms, charting his progression through various personae, the last of which represents hard-won stability in terms of politics, religion, race and artistic creativity. My investigation of selected poems from Mad Old Man under the Morning Star (2000) and Nine Lives (1991), as well as passages from his autobiography, Mr Chameleon, and his novella, “The Vortex” (1996), reveals complex effects of linguistic slippage which undermine this linear narrative and create a powerful ontological defamiliarisation in the reader. In examining Afrika's representation of skin, I focus specifically on shifts of perception and contradictions associated with race, gender and sexuality. I analyse the effects of the particular crises which arise when binary certitudes are eroded, using the concepts of transraciality and bisexuality to delineate the complexities of these crises."
