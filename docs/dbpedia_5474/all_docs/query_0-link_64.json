        "text": "South African white minority rulers implemented racial discrimination on the basis of colour also known as apartheid. Lewis Nkosi was a South African Black who fought against apartheid through writings. He was a critic, essayist, and novelist. His first novel Mating Birds is the story of an educated Black youth’s narration of his life. Ndi Sibiya, the narrator is awaiting death for the alleged rape of a white girl with whom he claims to have a muted love affair across the segregated beach. The narration is an attack on apartheid, the political system and judiciary. Nkosi uses existentialist and postmodernist techniques to present the story. This paper attempts to examine Mating Birds as an invective against apartheid.\n\nThe present paper proposes an examination of instances from Lewis Nkosi's novel Mating Birds (1983), in order to show how the text exposes racism under apartheid through the balanced use of language and silences. Firstly, there is an exploration of issues concerning the relationship between society and apartheid from a historical perspective – this is crucial to understand how space becomes relevant in the configuration of the narrative. Secondly, the analysis focuses on two questions: a) how the English language created a hybrid protagonist whose lack of belonging is the ultimate consequence of apartheid; and, b) how meaningful silence is for the interpretation of the novel. In the interaction that takes place among the uses of language and silence, social space and apartheid policies the author revives features of the South African oral tradition in a narrative that combines future, present and past in \" an ever-unfolding now \" (Edwards, 2008, p. 41). Resumen El presente trabajo examina instancias de la novela de Lewis Nkosi Mating Birds (1983), para mostrar cómo ésta expone el tema del racismo durante el período de apartheid a través del uso del lenguaje y los silencios. Primeramente, se exploran cuestiones relativas a la relación existente entre sociedad y apartheid desde una perspectiva histórica – esto es crucial para comprender cómo el espacio adquiere relevancia en la configuración de la narrativa. Luego, el análisis apunta a responder dos preguntas: a) cómo la lengua inglesa permitió la creación de un protagonista híbrido cuya falta de pertenencia es la consecuencia final del apartheid; y, b) qué significativo resulta el silencio para interpretar la novela. En la interacción que tiene lugar entre los usos del lenguaje y del silencio, el espacio social y las políticas del apartheid, el autor revive las características de la tradición oral sudafricana en una narrativa que combina futuro, presente y pasado en \" un ahora permanente \" (Edwards, 2008, p. 41).\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to cast light on the ideology expressed within the lines of Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous conditions. The author in her trial to reflect upon the Zimbabwean community tends implicitly to invite the reader to consider the social status and by virtue the social sufferings accorded to the African woman in a society that decides to minimize the womanist presence to a mere asset exploited by men. Some of Dangarembga's concerns in the novel touch upon gender, the African social dogmata, the roles stipulated to women by their macho counterparts and the taken for granted responsibilities of men, and their identities and personal ambitions apart from their stated roles. The paper launches a claim on gender and its upshot on marginalizing women and strengthening the knot of racism. Then, it tackles gender roles and the respective sociocultural dictations of rights and duties of African men and women. Under the same heading, gender identities and the internal and external conflicts of the characters throughout the way of self-realization are attached due heed. The paper tends to confer a virtual view to the intentions of the novel in making explicit the harrowing effect of the chauvinist community on squashing the feminine identity. Considerations of the colonial influence on the original African identity are also thought through. The paper aspires in the meantime to consider interdisciplinary issues by incorporating the field and theoretical views vis-à-vis the points mulled over in the work.\n\nThe study locates an asymmetrical dialectic of oppression in Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions. It reveals Nyasha, Tambu, Lucia, Maiguru, and Ma'Shingayi's experiences with racist-sexist dimensions in the context of a typical Shona society in colonial Rhodesia and England. The study locates cultural and political inscriptions on women's body and sexuality and the mutually-constitutive intersections which socio-culturally and politically regulate women characters' beliefs and body. Nyasha goes against existing political dynamics and exhibits subversive body performativeness to claim/redefine her identity and sexuality. It bespeaks of an act of political warfare. She deliberately dismantles the barriers that prohibit entrance to domains reserved for specific gender and race. As such, Nyasha's relation with her society and the hierarchical structure of race and gender in which her identity is embedded unequivocally signify political implications. This is because Nyasha's race, gender, and sexuality constitute her social and political identities.\n\nThe theory of apartheid was first introduced in South Africa by Hendrick Verwoerd under his National Party. Apartheid is a system which was used to enact strict racial laws that separates the white race from the black race. This was achieved by segregation of the country's resources where preference was issued in favour of the minority white population. The black majority was subject to exploitation prohibitive laws. This paper will discuss the theme of oppression and racial discrimination in the play Sizwe Bansi is Dead by Athol Fugard Theme of oppression"
