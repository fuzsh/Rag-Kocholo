        "text": "WISER, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nMonday June 13 2011\n\nVenue: WISER Seminar Room\n\nWhen Lewis Nkosi passed away on September 6, 2010 at the age of 73, South Africa lost an intellectual and literary voice as unique for its lucidity as its peerless range. Novelist, essayist, critic, playwright, editor, journalist, and scholar, Nkosi earned each of these designations individually, and this diversity has sometimes obscured the overall magnitude of his contribution to South African culture.\n\nIn order to commemorate Lewis Nkosi as both writer and individual, we are organizing a day-long series of seminars to analyse and discuss his writing in a collective fashion. We have chosen to focus on three aspects of his literary production: the critic, the essayist of exile, and the novelist. In order to create an open space for both personal reflection and critical evaluation, we are inviting writers and academics who knew Nkosi well to begin each seminar with framing observations regarding a selection of, or a single, text/s. The seminar coordinators will then lead a discussion among all of the participants about the readings. At the end of the morning session, a panel discussion entitled Remembering Lewis will bring together several of Nkosi’s long-time friends and collaborators to reflect on his life, important relationships, and personal contributions to South African letters.\n\n08h30 – 09h00: Registration and Tea\n\nSessions 1, 2 and 3 Registered Participants only\n\n09h00 – 10h00: Session 1\n\n‘Nkosi as Writer of Exile’\n\nLiz Gunner (WISER, Wits)\n\nJazz, Nkosi, Home and Exile\n\nSkhumbuzo Mngadi (UJ)\n\nExile, Alienation and Psychiatry in Nkosi’s Writing in Exile\n\n10h – 10h15: Tea break\n\n11h15 – 12h15: Session 2\n\n‘Nkosi as Essayist’\n\nLeslie Dikeni (Mapungubwe Institute)\n\nSemiotics: Lewis Nkosi: The Misunderstood Intellectual\n\nJon Soske (WISER and CISA)\n\nThe Pleasures of Intellect: Nkosi on the DRUM Decade\n\n11h15 – 12h15: Session 3\n\n‘Nkosi as Novelist’\n\nLindy Stiebel (UKZN)\n\nWorking from the Private to the Public in Lewis Nkosi’s novels\n\nPhakama Mbonambi (publisher and editor: Words etc literary journal)\n\nThe Phenomenon of Mating Birds\n\n12h15 – 14h00: Lunch\n\n14h00 – 15h30: Panel Discussion – Open to the Public\n\n‘Remembering Lewis’\n\nChair: Sandile Ngidi (writer and literary agent)\n\nNadine Gordimer (novelist)\n\nOswald Mtshali (poet)\n\nAlf Kumalo (photojournalist)\n\n*WISER Seminar Room is on the 6th floor Richard Ward Building, East Campus, Wits University.\n\nSpace in the seminars is limited.\n\nParticipants are required to RSVP by emailing Najibha Deshmukh on najibha.deshmukh@wits.ac.za Once you have registered you will be sent a selection of materials in order to prepare for the seminar.\n\nPlease note, all seminar participants must prepare by reading the texts to be sent."
