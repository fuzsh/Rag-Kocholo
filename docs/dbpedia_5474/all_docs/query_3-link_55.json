Subject to provincial plans, their task is to work collaboratively with principals and educators in schools, with the vital assistance of circuit offices, to improve educational access and retention, give management and professional support, and help schools achieve excellence in learning and teaching.\n\nDistrict offices, supported by their circuit offices, have four main roles which they must execute with due priority being given to the schools most in need of their services:"
