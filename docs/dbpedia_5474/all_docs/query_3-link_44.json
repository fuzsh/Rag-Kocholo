        "text": "TITLE: MATING BIRDS\n\nAUTHOR: LEWIS NKOSI\n\nPUBLISHED: 1983\n\nREVIEWER: VERAH OMWOCHA\n\nIn a few days I am to die. Strange, the idea neither shocks nor frightens me…\n\nAny book that starts with such a punch is one that cannot pass by me. Well, it escaped me all these years but I finally managed to read “MATING BIRDS” by Lewis Nkosi.\n\nThe narrator, Sibiya, is a South African black man who has been sentenced to hang. His crime; he ‘raped’ a white girl. He spends his last days recounting his history; tracing his broken family through his interviews with Dr. Dufre, a European doctor who patiently tries to understand what could have ‘triggered’ his reaction.\n\nAs the narrator recollects his childhood as a Zulu, he takes us through the social and political state of affairs surrounding South Africa at the time. What screams, however, is a case of the apartheid brutality and racial segregation; which begs the question, is he really being punished for the crime of ‘rape’ or for not being submissive to the white race? It is as if he is used as an example to the black race; ‘this is what happens when you challenge superiority’ but does that really work? The narrator, to a great extent achieves the hero status for daring to break the biggest apartheid law.\n\nSibiya deliberates on how his life would have turned out had he not encountered the white woman, Veronica, sunbathing on the beach. His ambitious self is convinced that he would have been the first truly great African writer my country has ever produced. I couldn’t help thinking, ‘he really could have been a great writer’. But then there is the challenge of confusing the narrator with the author in this context.\n\nThe narrator makes it clear that the sexual act(s) was on mutual consent but the girl cannot bow down to the accused’s race and admit to have had sex with a black man. He says ‘we were lovers in everything but in name’. They silently build a relationship through their stares across the fence that separates the ‘white only’ and black section on the beach. ‘…Apartheid? We had defeated apartheid. We had finally perfected a method of making love even without making contact, utilizing empty space like two telepathic media exchanging telegraphic messages through sexual airways.\n\nThe white girl, though not out rightly receptive of his advances, is lonely, willing and inviting. In his defence, Sibiya quotes being led on by the woman who happens to be a stripper. Her questionable moral standards, however, do not count in the court. Either way, she is no victim.\n\nWhat kills him in the end is that which was forbidden that he craved; the smooth soft skin, unforgettable perfume and silky hair. Though as he records; ‘…as I was to later find out, the skin was neither soft nor the hair so smooth as I had first imagined’\n\nWhat held me captive in this text must be how Nkosi lets words flow freely even on a grave subject as the subject of an imminent death.\n\nThis rather poetic narration is cleverly written. The narrator has quite an imagination and descriptive abilities that run deep through the short text.\n\nThis controversial text was awarded the Macmillan Silver Pen Prize in 1986 and was named one of the New York Times’ best hundred books in the same year.\n\nI enjoyed this novel. Though highly loaded with sexual connotations, it is a great adult read."
