        "text": "FREE money is up for grabs for people with unique business ideas, but it comes with expectations.\n\nThe Awesome Foundation is giving out grants of $1,000 to go-getters who have a project that needs funding.\n\n\"Forwarding the interest of awesome in the universe, $1,000 at a time,\" read's the organization's landing page.\n\nWith a self-reported $6,465,000 given out over 6465 different projects, The Awesome Foundation has done just that.\n\nApplications for funding are accepted on a rolling basis and are still open.\n\n\"Every chapter interprets \"awesome\" for itself. As such, awesome projects include initiatives in a wide range of areas including arts, technology, community development, and more,\" the website defines what constitutes an eligible project.\n\n\"Many awesome projects are novel or experimental, and evoke surprise and delight. Awesome sometimes challenges and often inspires.\"\n\nAside from basic identifying information, the application is quick to fill out, only asking the application to answer a few prompts:\n\n\"Tell us about your awesome project!\n\nHow will you use the money?\n\nTell us a little about yourself\"\n\nThe catch it, that the project must be viable and likely to success, which means the applicant typically has to have already started work before applying for the grant.\n\nThe application even requires up to five pictures of progress or past proof that the project is brilliant and possible.\n\nApplications must also pick which chapter to apply to.\n\n\"Most chapters show a strong preference for projects that contribute to their own communities, though some occasionally consider applications from further afield,\" reads the company's FAQ page.\n\nThe chapters are typically oriented based on geography, and The Awesome Project suggests applicants apply to one near them for the best results.\n\nThere are currently 46 chapters local to the United States, meaning there is a good chance that potential awardees have a chapter near them.\n\nOther than geographic chapters, there are six thematic chapters that focus on an area of issue rather than a location, such as homelessness or disability.\n\nEach chapter is allowed to set its own parameters for what money can be spent on, but all of them promise a \"no-strings-attached\" payment, meaning it does not have to be repaid.\n\nMany prohibit the funds from being used to pay participating individuals and require the project to have a potentially widespread effect.\n\nIn order to increase the chance of receiving the $1,000, applicants can submit to multiple chapters.\n\nPast projects range in their impact and reach.\n\nTasha Gray was funded by the Homelessness Chapter in September to put on the annual Family Resource Fair & Giveaway in her community.\n\n\"We help our unhoused by connecting them to resources for housing, mental health, health and food assistance. For our house population we help with daily essentials along with food boxes, rent assistance and Case Management to help prevent homelessness,\" she wrote in her application.\n\nJames Delaney was funded by the Awesome Without Boarders Chapter to continue rehabilitating a neighborhood park in South Africa.\n\n\"It has gone from being a space feared by the residents of the city, to the top-rated park in the city, and the winner of several awards,\" shared Delaney."
