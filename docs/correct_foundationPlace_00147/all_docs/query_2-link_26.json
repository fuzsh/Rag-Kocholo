Some chapters prefer to fund local projects or are drawn to certain topics. It's a good idea to also submit directly to the chapters closest to you or those who've got a record of granting in your area of interest on their chapter page.\n\nThe Awesome Foundation is constantly growing, so submitting to the \"Any\" category means that your information will be available to new chapters as they launch. In the meantime, feel free to apply to as many chapters as you like. We recommend starting with the ones near where you live and/or will be carrying out your project."
