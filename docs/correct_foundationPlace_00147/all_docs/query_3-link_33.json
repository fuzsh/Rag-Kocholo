        "text": "Context\n\nThe Awesome Foundation is a worldwide network of local chapters. Each month or bi-monthly, people can pitch their Awesome ideas to the micro-trustees on a local level. They judge the ideas and choose the best one. The best idea is then granted â¬1000 to implement the idea. The foundation started in 2008 in Boston and can be found in 82 cities all over the world.\n\nTransformational Measures and Activities\n\nThe Awesome idea â Color the cityâ is an example of an intervention in the public space. Different locations throughout a city a used for colorful murals that brighten the city and give a location a new transformed perspective.\n\nResults\n\nThe initiative of the Awesome Foundation results in all kind of interventions. For example in the physical domain by transforming public spaces, but also at a social level by creating neighborhood community activities.Â\n\nChallenges, Opportunities and Transferability\n\nThe Awesome foundation thrives on the help of the volunteers, the micro-trustees. They contribute in time and money to make the Awesome ideas possible. This bottom-up approach only works if the group of volunteers is dedicated to the cause of the foundation."
