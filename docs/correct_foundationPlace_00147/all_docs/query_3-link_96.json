        "text": "Editor’s Note: Is your small business one of the best in America? Apply for our premier awards program for small businesses, the CO—100, today to get recognized and rewarded. One hundred businesses will be honored and one business will be awarded $25,000. Apply here!\n\nWhether you’re starting a new small business or looking to grow the one you already own, finding funding can be a challenge for businesses of all sizes. If you’re looking for a small business loan or grant, CO— is here to help.\n\nEach week, we update this list of loans, small business grants, or other opportunities to connect with programs and organizations that can help you with your business. Come back often to see the latest. And, if your organization has a program or grant you’d like to see listed here, email us at CO@uschamber.com.\n\nIf you’re not sure of the difference between a loan and a grant, check out our explainer here. You can also learn more about all funding options in our small business financing guide here.\n\nGovernment grants\n\nBegin your search for a grant from the federal government at Grants.gov. This government site offers the most comprehensive database of funds the government is going to give away. There are thousands of grants to apply for, with opportunities for companies from all backgrounds.\n\nKeep in mind that not all assistance flows directly from the federal government to small businesses. Some funds are distributed to state and local governments and agencies, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher learning. These entities, in turn, distribute the funds or use them to provide technical or educational assistance on a local level.\n\nIn addition to the programs listed here, be sure to check with your state and local governments and use the resources listed below. When searching through grant and contracting options, note that you may qualify for more than one program.\n\nAs illustrated by the following sampling of grants, the assistance available to you from the government will vary, depending on your specific situation.\n\nThe Blueprint Medtech Small Business Translator Grant. This is a government grant for small businesses working on creating medical devices to treat nervous system disorders. It supports activities like making prototype devices, safety testing, and clinical studies to get approval from the FDA. The grant is a cooperative program where the NIH helps plan and monitor the research. It also provides funding and access to experts for things like regulations, patents, and manufacturing. Small businesses with their device ideas or collaborations with manufacturers can apply for this grant to advance their projects. The next deadline to apply is September 27, 2024.\n\nEmployee Retention Credit. The Employee Retention Credit (ERC), sometimes called the Employee Retention Tax Credit, is a stimulus program established by the CARES Act. This refundable tax credit functions as a grant that helps businesses impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligibility guidelines are available on the IRS website.\n\nIllinois Infrastructure Grants. In 2020, Governor Pritzker launched an initiative to improve Illinois' infrastructure. $3 billion of this was allocated for capital grants through the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO). These capital grants, part of Illinois' $45 billion infrastructure initiative, are designed to support various projects that benefit local communities and businesses. The DCEO maintains a transparent list of these grants, which can be either general or specific project grants. You can find more information about these grants on the GATA website.\n\nThe Minnesota Emerging Entrepreneur Loan Program (ELP). ELP is an initiative aimed at supporting the growth of Minnesota businesses owned by minorities, low-income individuals, women, veterans, and persons with disabilities. The program provides grant funds to nonprofit lenders across the state, which in turn offer loans to startup and expanding businesses. These loans not only foster business development but also aim to create jobs for minority and low-income individuals, strengthen minority-owned enterprises, and boost economic growth in disadvantaged areas. To participate in the program, eligible businesses must apply through certified nonprofit lenders, with DEED assisting in lender identification if needed, and loans are subject to DEED's approval.\n\nNational Institute of Health Grants. The National Institute of Health (NIH) is currently funding grant opportunities related to COVID-19 research. These grants are reserved for small businesses that develop and research biomedical technology. There are multiple grants available with deadlines throughout 2024 and beyond.\n\nNIDILRR's SBIR program. The SBIR program aims to support organizations to help advance technology and research, as well as support the social/economic benefits for the nation. The SBIR will be backing the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) through the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to provide 10 grants that support the improvement of the lives of those with disabilities. The total grant funding is estimated to be $1 million, and an outline of the available grants under this program can be found on the ACL website.\n\nSan Francisco Accessibility Grant. Small business owners in San Francisco can apply for a grant to enhance accessibility in their establishments. The grant can cover expenses like accessible equipment, construction to remove ADA barriers, CASp inspections, design services, and relevant permit fees, with a maximum grant amount of $10,000. Eligible businesses must be registered in San Francisco, have less than $2.5 million in gross revenue for a single location, and employ an average of 100 or fewer employees. The application process is fast, and applicants can expect a response within 15 days of submission. Upon approval, they will need to provide proof of payment and photos showcasing accessibility improvements.\n\nSmall Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR).The SBIR offers grants to small businesses so they can participate in federal research and development with the potential for commercialization. It’s a highly competitive awards-based program that helps businesses achieve scientific excellence and technological innovation. To qualify for SBIR grants, you must operate a for-profit company and satisfy other requirements.\n\nSmall Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR). Similar to SBIR, the STTR program focuses on funding research in the R&D arena. However, what separates the STTR is the requirement that the small business has a formal collaboration with a research institution. To qualify for STTR grants, you must operate a for-profit company and satisfy other requirements.\n\nTexas Enterprise Fund (TEF). The Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) offers \"deal-closing\" grants to companies competing with out-of-state sites for new projects in Texas. These grants are based on performance, encouraging significant capital investment and job creation. Eligible companies must meet criteria related to job creation, capital investment, financial stability, and local support. Once approved, grantees sign contracts committing to job and wage targets, with clawback provisions in case of non-compliance. The application process includes a thorough screening, and unanimous support from top state officials is required for approval.\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development Business Programs. The USDA’s Rural Development Business Programs provide financial support and technical assistance to promote rural business growth. They offer loans, grants, and guarantees with the goal of enhancing economic opportunities and job creation in rural communities; deadlines and eligibility requirements vary by program.\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA). Targeted grants and loans designed to aid minority-owned businesses are offered throughout the year. Minority-owned businesses can find information about local MBDA Business Centers at MBDA.gov.\n\nU.S. Department of Education (DOE) Grants. The U.S. DOE has various grants available to small businesses in the education sector. Each grant has unique eligibility criteria, with some opportunities set aside for public schools, state agencies, or nonprofit organizations; however, others allow applications from for-profit private sector companies. Deadlines for currently available DOE grants run through September 12, 2024.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration State Trade Expansion Program (STEP). Intended to assist small businesses desiring to export product, this program distributes federal funds through state entities. Small businesses that meet the criteria set by each state can use the financial assistance to participate in foreign trade missions and shows, obtain entry to foreign markets, develop websites, and design international marketing products or campaigns.\n\nU.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA). The EDA is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce and offers ongoing funding opportunities for projects that support regional and national economic development. Applicants can apply for a variety of rolling-basis EDA investments that fund projects in construction, non-construction, planning, technical assistance, research and evaluation, higher education, and more.\n\nAs you would expect, acceptance of free money from the government comes with a fair amount of paperwork. Applying for a grant can be time-consuming and technical. You want to make sure, therefore, that you are eligible before applying. In addition to the legal and administrative prerequisites, there are ongoing reporting and auditing requirements.\n\nGovernment contract assistance\n\nThe federal government spends billions of dollars on goods and services each year. A lot of that money is spent through a competitive bidding process. Programs have been put in place to assist some small businesses with the process, allowing them a better chance to compete for those federal dollars.\n\nService-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Program. The federal government seeks to award at least 3% of all federal contracting dollars to veteran-owned businesses annually, so this program helps with meeting that target. This federal contracting program offers assistance to small business owners who are service-disabled veterans. Eligible small businesses must be over 50% owned/controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans, have day-to-day operations and long-term goals managed by at least one service-disabled veteran and have a service-connected disability.\n\nWomen-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting Program. The federal government seeks to award at least 5% of federal contracting dollars to women-owned small businesses annually. Through this SBA program, the Office of Women’s Business Ownership provides support to women entrepreneurs by offering business training, counseling, federal contracts and access to credit and capital. Their goal is to offer equal opportunities for all women in business.\n\n8(a) Business Development Program. The purpose of this program is to assist small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged entities. This is achieved by limiting competition for certain government contracts to businesses participating in the 8(a) business development program. To participate a business must be certified as an 8(a) entity.\n\nHUBZone Program. This program aids businesses in underutilized business zones by making them more competitive in regard to some government contracts. Businesses that join the HUBZone program can compete for set-aside contracts as well as receive preference on others, including a 10% price evaluation preference in open contract competitions.\n\nNatural Resource Sales Assistance Program\n\nIn addition to the billions of dollars spent purchasing goods and services, the federal government also sells large amounts of natural resources and surplus property. The SBA Natural Resource Sales Assistance Program sets aside a percentage of these goods for bidding by small businesses only. In addition, federal agencies sometimes divide surplus materials into smaller parcels, making it easier for small businesses to purchase. The five categories are:\n\nTimber and related forest products.\n\nStrategic materials.\n\nRoyalty oil.\n\nLeases involving rights to minerals, coil, oil and gas.\n\nSurplus real and personal property.\n\nThe program also provides training for small businesses on government sales and leasing.\n\nGeneral small business grants\n\nThere are many nonprofit and corporate entities offering grants and other assistance to small businesses. Here are a few such programs that are open to qualifying small businesses in any industry:\n\n500 Global Flagship Accelerator Program. Startups and small businesses seeking funding can do so on a rolling, year-round basis with the 500 Global Flagship Accelerator program. Since 2010, this program has offered businesses the opportunity for a four-month accelerator program based in San Francisco in addition to a $150,000 investment.
