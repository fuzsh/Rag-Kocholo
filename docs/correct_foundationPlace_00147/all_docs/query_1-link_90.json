        "text": "By Julia Gergely, New York Jewish Week, July 17, 2024. Click for full report.\n\nLeft: Page from the diary of Yitskhok Rudashevski. Right: Photo of Yitskhok Rudashevski in the 1930s. (Courtesy of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, Ghetto Fighters’ House Museum, Israel/Photo Archive)\n\nGrowing up in Vilna in the 1930s, Yitskhok Rudashevski was a typical 13-year-old Jewish boy living a typical Jewish life: He went to school, spent time with friends and family, read and wrote poetry and got involved in Jewish activities at the cultural center, talking about global politics with his father, who was a writer for the Yiddish daily, called Vilna Tog.\n\nIn June 1941, Rudashevski began keeping a diary, documenting the alarming transition — in just three months — from living a happy life under the looming threat of war to his family’s forcible move into the ghetto, where comfort, joy, food and personal space were in short supply.\n\nOver the next two years, in neat Yiddish script written in a black notebook, Rudashevski described ghetto life.\n\nHis story is now the core of a comprehensive new online exhibit by New York’s YIVO Institute for Jewish Research as part of their free, public online museum. It launched on Wednesday.\n\nThe interactive exhibit, which takes roughly two-and-a-half hours to click through, incorporates narrative, text, video dramatizations, illustrations, photographs and more to tell the story of Rudashevski and the Vilna Jewish community. Alongside the diary, translated from Yiddish specifically for this exhibit by Solon Beinfeld, the exhibit gives context to Rudashevski’s life in Vilna and the cataclysm that brought it to an end.\n\n“The online electronic format of this allows us to make use of extensive, extensive documentation from our archives that otherwise would be very difficult to put in a single exhibition, and it enables us to tell a story in many different ways,” Jonathan Brent, the CEO of YIVO, told the New York Jewish Week of the decision to put the exhibit online.\n\n“We feel at YIVO that there is an obligation and a responsibility to make our treasures and the immense resources that we have of historical knowledge, for cultural knowledge and for artistic knowledge, available to the widest possible group of Jews of Ashkenazi descent,” he added. “And not just of Ashkenazi descent, and not just Jews. This also gives us a way of reaching Lithuanians in Lithuania and Poles in Poland.”\n\nYitskhok Rudashevski, lower left, with his arm around his mother, Rosa, poses with his parents and grandparents. His father Eliyahu is at top left. (Courtesy of Ghetto Fighters’ House Museum, Israel/Photo Archive)\n\nRudashevski’s diary — which has been kept at YIVO’s Manhattan headquarters since 1946 — illuminates the quotidian daily life of the Jewish community in Vilna and what the children and adults were thinking about and focused on. Much of his diary, like any middle schooler’s, talks about his homework assignments, friendships and daily schedule.\n\nOther entries shed light on the devastation and desperation Rudashevski felt at how quickly his life changed. On Sept. 6, 1941, the day Rudashevski entered the ghetto, he writes:\n\nA ghetto is being created for the Jews of Vilna. At home we are packing. The women go around wringing their hands, weeping as they see their homes looking like after a pogrom. I walk around, weary from lack of sleep, among the bundles. I see how overnight we are uprooted from our homes. Soon we get a glimpse of the first image of going to the ghetto. It is an image from the Middle Ages. A big black mass of people moves, harnessed to their big bundles. We understand that it will soon be our turn. I look at the disorderly room, at the bundles, at the overwhelmed, despairing people. I see things lying around that had become so dear to me, that I used to use. Soon two Christian neighbors [arrive to look at our room]. We carry the bundles into the courtyard. On our street a new mass of Jews keeps streaming to the ghetto.\n\nBy September 1943, the Nazis liquidated the ghetto and Rudashevski and his family went into hiding in his uncle’s home. They were soon discovered and murdered a few weeks later in the nearby Ponar forest. His cousin, Sore Voloshin, who was able to escape and was the sole survivor of the family, found the diary in the attic after the war ended.\n\nYitskhok Rudashevski and his father Eliyahu in the 1930s. (Courtesy of Ghetto Fighters’ House Museum, Israel/Photo Archive)\n\nVoloshin turned her cousin’s diary over to the Yiddish poets Avrom Sutzkever and Shmerke Kaczerginski, who sent it to YIVO in New York City in 1946 as part of their effort to preserve what was left of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe. The diary was published in Yiddish in the 1950s and had been incompletely translated before. This is the first time YIVO is highlighting the diary in its own exhibition as opposed to a portion of a separate exhibition.\n\nThis is the second online exhibit curated by YIVO — in 2020, the museum published a similarly curated exhibit about Beba Epstein, a Lithuanian and secular Jewish teenager at the time of the Holocaust. In 1934, Epstein wrote an autobiography, which she submitted to YIVO in Vilna as part of a youth writing contest. That lost autobiography was among hundreds of thousands of documents in YIVO’s archive that were rediscovered in 2017, having been smuggled out of the Vilna ghetto by the “paper brigade,” a group of Jewish poets and scholars who preserved the documents.\n\nYIVO hopes an online exhibit like this can be used for educational purposes and has curated teacher resources to guide classrooms throughout the exhibition.\n\nBrent, himself a historian, said the diary is unique because it showcases how committed the Jewish community of Vilna was to Jewish life and how that commitment was entrenched in every moment of living in the ghetto.\n\n“The thing that blew me away in reading this diary of this 13-year-old boy was his strength and spirit. He is aware of the fact that by reading the poetry of Yehoash or of [I.L.] Peretz or other great Yiddish writers, by virtue of doing that, he is performing an act of defiance and resistance against the Nazis,” Brent said. “When Jews study our past, we get teeming information about death. What this diary provides is information about life.”\n\nBy Ashley Zlatopolsky, Detroit Jewish News, July 16, 2024. Click for full report.\n\nA new Holocaust memorial concept is hoping to take ground in Metro Detroit.\n\nAs the brainchild of Assembly of the World Diasporas, an organization that works in different countries to unite leaders of various ethnic groups and diasporas, the Gate of Immortality — Holocaust and Heroism Memorial plans to honor those subjected to the horrors of World War II and the tragedy of the Holocaust with memorials worldwide.\n\nNow, the concept also hopes to address rising global antisemitism as a result of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, which has hit especially hard on college campuses.\n\nThe first Gate of Immortality site has been secured in Queens, N.Y. The memorial will be placed on the south side of the Queens Borough Hall in one of New York City’s biggest Jewish enclaves.\n\nIlya Bromberg, 77, of Oak Park, who is the Midwest representative of Assembly of the World Diasporas, is working to identify a Metro Detroit site next.\n\nWhile a site hasn’t been secured yet, Bromberg says there are many possibilities in the Metro Detroit community, which is home to numerous iconic Jewish institutions such as The J-Detroit, Zekelman Holocaust Center, Congregation Shaarey Zedek and beyond.\n\nCurrently, Assembly of the World Diasporas is welcoming interested parties to contact the organization about being the potential home of the Metro Detroit memorial or to discuss funding opportunities to facilitate the creation and build-out of the project.\n\nHonoring the Past\n\nThe Gate of Immortality — Holocaust and Heroism Memorial will include four main elements. Centering the concept is the main gate of the composition, which will be formed by two vertical walls representing the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nThe names of the places of mass exterminations of Jews during the Holocaust will be engraved on the inner surfaces on one of the walls. The other wall, meanwhile, will have official data engraved on the number of Jewish soldiers who fought against the Nazis.\n\nBromberg says the walls will also be designed in a way that can be used to display holographic and/or laser projections of drawings and paintings by children from around the world on the theme of “A World Without Hate,” as well as work by renowned artists.\n\nProjections can also include thematic exhibitions showcasing historical photographs, videos, artifacts and more surrounding World War II and the Holocaust. The walls will also be installed on a pedestal-like stage made in the form of the Star of David.\n\nAt the base of the Star of David will be illuminated sculptural images and imprints of Nazi symbols, or fragments of the gates of Auschwitz and Buchenwald. To honor the memory of Jews transported to extermination camps via railroad, the Star of David will also have a symbolic circular single rail of railway in the shape of an ongoing loop.\n\nPromoting Peace\n\nWith the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz coming up in January 2025, as well as the growing antisemitism plaguing Jews worldwide, Bromberg believes there’s no better time than now to honor our Jewish memory, history and survival.\n\n“The mission of the memorial is to combine universal humanitarian values, historical facts, national Jewish symbols and traditions, and the horrors of the tragedy of European Jewry as an expression of sympathy and solidarity,” he says.\n\nThe Gate of Immortality — Holocaust and Heroism Memorial will also honor the bravery of Jewish soldiers across nations who gave their lives to defend world freedom.\n\nAssembly of the World Diasporas asks that the Metro Detroit Jewish community weigh in on the concept and provide feedback or any ideas about the Jewish landmark.\n\nAuthors, organizers and sponsors will have their names engraved on the memorial.\n\nFor Bromberg, a Soviet Jewish immigrant who grew up in Kyiv next to Babi Yar, the notorious mass extermination site of Jews during World War II, it’s a project near and dear to his heart. Throughout the decades, Bromberg has worked closely with Yad Vashem to collect 700 Holocaust survivor testimonies throughout the U.S. and Canada.\n\nHe’s also collaborated with the Riga Ghetto Museum and organized exhibitions in New York and Chicago. The Michigan Holocaust memorial concept is next on his to-do list.\n\nMetro Detroit’s Jewish community is hopeful the project will take fruition.\n\n“The Holocaust was the greatest tragedy in human history, with more than 6 million Jews murdered for the ‘crime’ of being Jewish,” says Charles Silow, Ph.D., director of the program for Holocaust survivors and families at Jewish Senior Life.\n\n“As we remember the tragedy of the Holocaust, it is the hope that we treat all human beings with kindness and respect no matter our race, religion, ethnicity or gender.\n\n“All memorials that serve to preserve the history of the Holocaust help us see where hatred and bigotry can lead,” he continues. “Hopefully, this new memorial that will honor European Jewry as well as the Jewish soldiers who fought during World War II will help send messages of tolerance and respect and will help prevent history from repeating itself.”\n\nFor more information, visit http://diasporasworld.org.\n\nIsrael’s Holocaust museum is opening a conservation facility in Jerusalem that will preserve, restore and store its more than 45,000 artifacts and artworks\n\nBy SHLOMO MOR Associated Press and MAYA ALLERUZZO Associated Press, July 8, 2024. Click for report from ABC news.\n\nJERUSALEM — Israel’s national Holocaust museum opened a new conservation facility in Jerusalem on Monday that will preserve, restore and store its more than 45,000 artifacts and works of art in a vast new building, including five floors of underground storage.\n\nYad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, serves as both a museum and a research institution. It welcomes nearly a million visitors each year, leads the country’s annual Holocaust memorial day and hosts nearly all foreign dignitaries visiting Israel.\n\n“Before we opened this building, it was very difficult to exhibit our treasures that were kept in our vaults. They were kind of secret,” said Yad Vashem chairman Dani Dayan. “Now there’s a state-of-the-art installation (that) will help us to exhibit them.”\n\nThe David and Fela Shapell Family Collections Center, located at the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem, will also provide organization and storage for the museum’s 225 million pages of documents and half a million photographs.\n\nDayan said the materials will now be kept in a facility that preserves them in optimal temperatures and conditions.\n\n“Yad Vashem has the largest collections in the world of materials related to the Holocaust,” Dayan said. “We will make sure that these treasures are kept for eternity.”\n\nThe new facility includes advanced, high-tech labs for conservation, enabling experts to revisit some of the museum’s trickier items, such as a film canister that a family who fled Austria in 1939 brought with them. It was donated to the museum but arrived in an advanced state of decay.\n\n“The film arrived in the worst state it could. It smelled really bad,” said Reut Ilan-Shafik, a photography conservator at Yad Vashem. Over the years, the film had congealed into a solid piece of plastic, making it impossible to be scanned.\n\nUsing organic solvents, conservators were able to restore some of the film’s flexibility, allowing them to carefully unravel pieces of it. Using a microscope, Ilan-Shafik was able to see a few frames in their entirety, including one showing a couple kissing on a bench in a park and other snapshots of Europe before World War II.\n\n“It is unbelievable to know that the images of the film that we otherwise thought lost to time” have been recovered, said Orit Feldberg, granddaughter of Hans and Klara Lebel, the couple featured in the film reel.\n\nFeldberg’s mother donated the film canister, one of the few things the Lebels were able to take with them when they fled Austria.\n\n“These photographs not only tell their unique story but also keep their memory vibrantly alive,” Feldberg said.\n\nConservation of items from the Holocaust is an expensive, painstaking process that has taken on greater importance as the number of survivors dwindles.\n\nLast month, the Auschwitz Memorial announced it had finished a half-million-dollar project to conserve 3,000 of the 8,000 pairs of children’s shoes that are on display at the Nazi concentration camp in Poland.\n\nBy Rachael Riley, Fayetteville Observer, July 3, 2024. Click for full report including photo captions.\n\nFORT LIBERTY — Maj. Gen. Sidney Shachnow will forever be remembered by his beloved special operations forces at Fort Liberty.\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School hosted a ceremony Friday to officially designate Shachnow Lane after the school’s former commander and Holocaust survivor.\n\nFormerly Mosby Street, the road in front of the school’s campus is one of nine roads identified by officials to be renamed after the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act mandate to rename Department of Defense assets commemorating the confederacy.\n\nSWC commander Brig Gen. Jason Slider said that future special operators and hundreds of Army special operations forces soldiers pass along the route daily.\n\n“It is appropriate that the path they travel bears the name of Maj. Gen. Shachnow, as his legacy of SOF guides them as they become the next generation of special operations professionals,” Slider said.\n\nShachnow, who died Sept. 28, 2018, at the age of 83, was the only general officer in the Army to have survived the Holocaust.\n\nHe was born in Kaunas, Lithuania in 1934, and when he was 6, he was imprisoned for three years during World War II at the Nazi Kovno concentration camp before it was liberated by the Soviet army.\n\nShachnow lived in Europe until he immigrated to the United States in 1950 followed by enlisting in the Army in 1955 and spending 32 in the Special Forces community.\n\nLegacy\n\nShachnow’s grandson Maj. Alexander Smith spoke on behalf of the family at Friday’s dedication ceremony.\n\nSmith serves under the 75th Ranger Regiment at Fort Moore Georgia, which falls under the U.S. Army Special Operations Command. He said his grandfather made a great impact on his life.\n\nSmith said that while signs and plaques about his grandfather are an honor, they do not capture his grandfather’s humor and fun spirit.\n\nHe gave an example of a lesson he learned when he was about 7 or 8 years old from the man he called Pops.\n\nSmith was at his grandfather’s Southern Pines horse farm when his grandfather told him there was a problem — a wasp nest was above the barn and posed a risk for Smith’s mother and grandmother who would be riding horses the next day.\n\n“After careful consideration and gathering some key equipment, I got my assignment and an overview of our three-step plan,” Smith said.\n\nStep one involved Shachnow spraying the wasp nest with bug killer, though they risked running out of spray. Smith would be involved in the second step of whacking the nest with a broom handle.\n\n“Sounded a bit risky though, but I trusted Pops implicitly, so I steeled myself for the awesome responsibility at hand,” Smith said. “Step three, he assured me, was the most important part, and I quote, ‘Then we are going to run like hell.’”\n\nSmith said they accomplished the mission unstung, and it taught him “a well-briefed plan, violently executed will do in a pinch.”\n\nSmith said his grandfather also taught him more serious life lessons.\n\nHe said that when he hears the Special Forces’ motto of de oppressor liber, which means to free the oppressed, he thinks of his grandfather.\n\n“He went from prisoner to refugee, to immigrant, to soldier, to citizen From special operations leader to commander of the Berlin brigade to general officer and SOF visionaire,” Smith said. “None of it was easy.”\n\nSmith said he hopes Shachnow Lane and the nearby plaque with his grandfather’s biography inspires the next generation of special operation forces who may be called upon one day to liberate a nation.\n\n“I hope especially that those walking this area just starting a career in special operations consider the man and what his broader life represents, truly the ultimate American dream, built on grit, love and for those lucky enough to know him like I did — a great sense of humor. A man who started with less than nothing,” he said.\n\nMore on Maj. Gen. Shachnow:Special Forces legend, Holocaust survivor has died\n\nMilitary career\n\nRoxanne Merritt, director of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School Museum, recounted Shachnow’s military career during Friday’s ceremony.\n\nShachnow enlisted in the Army shortly after immigrating to the U.S, in order to become an American citizen and first reported for duty at Fort Dix, New Jersey, when Smoke Bomb Hill and the first Psychological Warfare Center and School at then-Fort Bragg was “an island of scrub rush, oak and pine trees,” near a smelly meat rendering plant and the railroad roundhouse, Merritt said.\n\n“Little does he know that this will lead to a 35-year commitment to the U.S. Army and to his country,” she said.\n\nIn 1962, he graduated with distinguished honors from Officer Candidate School, just a decade after being able to barely speak English, Merritt said.\n\nWhile the Psychological Warfare Center and School was renamed and under the command of Brig. Gen. William P. Yarborough, then-Maj. Shachnow returned from his tour in Vietnam as commander of a 5th Special Forces Group detachment.\n\nOver the next decade, Merritt said, Shachnow reported for assignments in Germany and attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas\n\nMerritt said that although Schachnow was cautioned against returning to Special Forces, he accepted command of the “then-clandestine covert organization known as the 39 Special Forces detachment.”\n\nMerritt said she met then-Col. Shachnow and his wife Arlene in 1983 when they were walking his dogs and when he was chief of staff for SWC before becoming its commander.\n\nShe recalled when Shachnow was under the U.S. Special Operations Command and sent to Washington D.C. as a liaison “to try to explain what special warfare special ops was to Congress,” which she said he was able to summarize in four sentences.\n\nIn 1990, Maj. Gen. Shachnow was the commander of all American forces in Berlin when the Berlin Wall was toppled near the end of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe told The Fayetteville Observer in 1994 it was the same area where Nazis “were goose-stepping and heil-Hitlering the very system that put me in the camp and killed many people.”\n\n“Here we are 40 some-odd years later, and I come back to be commander of American forces in that city and a Jew on top of that … It sort of adds insult to injury, doesn’t it,” Shachnow said in 1994.\n\nIn 1992, Merritt said, Shachnow became commander of SWC.\n\n“He felt very strongly that we had wandered from our roots, and he was determined that we would be reoriented,” Merritt said.\n\nShachnow told his superiors that language and culture, force multiplication and the unconventional warfare exercise known as Robin Sage were important and he advocated for keeping the special operation forces noncommissioned officer school, civil affairs proponents and the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape school under SWC, she said.\n\n“Many a general officer felt his steely gaze as he would not back down,” Merritt said.\n\nMerritt said that when Shachnow retired in 1994, his legacy “was and is still evident.”\n\n“I want to believe that the young man once known as Schaja Shachnowski is looking from above and is exclaiming you’ve got to be kidding me upon realizing that his legacy will be perpetuated on a daily basis,” Merritt said through tears. “Every time somebody looks at a map, reads GPS and asks for directions or goes anywhere on this campus, they have to go by him first. I think he would appreciate that.”\n\nStaff writer Rachael Riley can be reached at rriley@fayobserver.com or 910-486-3528.\n\nBy Josh Rottenberg, Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2024. Click for full report.\n\nHolocaust survivor Harry Davids has dedicated his life to uncovering the story of the parents he never knew.\n\nBorn in Nazi-occupied Holland in 1942, Davids was just an infant when his parents were deported to the Sobibor extermination camp in Poland and murdered. After the war, he was raised by relatives in South Africa and spent decades trying to learn the details of his family’s history, a task made more difficult by the fact that the perpetrators had dismantled Sobibor after the war and planted trees to cover up the site where at least 170,000 people had been systematically killed.\n\n“The 10th and final stage of genocide is denial,” Davids says. “The Nazis successfully got rid of the evidence at Sobibor and several other camps.”\n\nNow, thanks to a groundbreaking collaboration between Hollywood and Holocaust Museum Los Angeles, this lost history has been been reimagined with 21st century technology. The oldest Holocaust museum in the U.S., Holocaust Museum L.A. has teamed up with the technology studio Magnopus, led by visual effects artists Craig Barron and Ben Grossmann — who earned Oscars for 2008’s “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” and 2011’s “Hugo,” respectively — to create a new educational app that uses augmented reality to bring Sobibor to virtual life.\n\nThe Sobibor AR exhibit, available for free download in Apple’s app store, allows users to interact with a 3D model of Sobibor, with actor Ben Feldman serving as a holographic guide providing historical context and encouraging deeper exploration of the camp’s layout and daily life. The app centers on the story of Polish survivor Thomas Blatt, who escaped from Sobibor during a famous 1943 uprising and created a detailed map from memory, including key locations such as the barracks, guard towers, gas chambers and mass graves.\n\nThe museum, which was founded in 1961 by a group of Holocaust survivors, houses a physical model of Sobibor based on Blatt’s map. But Davids, who frequently speaks to young people about what happened to his family and the millions of other victims of the Holocaust, says the app allows for a more immersive experience.\n\n“The glass that covers the original model is taken away and you sort of become part of the exhibit yourself,” he says.\n\nFor the museum, which has already experimented with virtual reality technology in its exhibits, the app represents a new way to engage younger generations in the history of the Holocaust. The museum has created an accompanying guide for educators and, since the soft launch of the app last year, says it has trained 123 teachers to use it, reaching more than 150,000 students.\n\n“We know we’re at the point now where young people, when they come to the museum, think, ‘Oh, this is ancient history,’” says Holocaust Museum L.A. Chief Executive Beth Kean. “We have to get their attention the minute they walk off the bus and make sure they understand why they’re here. We need to make this history relevant and accessible to them and teach it to them on a level that they understand.”\n\nIn 2019, the museum began partnering with the “cross-experience” company Magnopus to develop the app, leveraging artifacts and photos in its collection along with its physical model of the Sobibor camp.\n\n“Most of us here at Magnopus work in the film industry in some capacity and we tell fantasy stories,” says Barron, the company’s creative director, who has done VFX work on such films as “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “Batman Returns” and “Titanic.” “This was an opportunity to tell a real-life true story. Thomas Blatt’s map was basically a witness to his experiences that we could add value to and bring forward beyond the walls of a physical museum.”\n\nFor everyone involved, it was critically important that the app be firmly grounded in firsthand historical documents and artifacts. “The ethos of our museum is that we believe that primary sources and survivor testimony are crucial to Holocaust education and fostering empathetic responses to history,” says Jordanna Gessler, Holocaust Museum L.A.’s chief impact officer. “The Sobibor model felt like the perfect object to launch this initiative around because it embodies so much of this history and what this institution believes in.”\n\nIn its research for the project, the team at Magnopus pored over primary sources, including home movies of Blatt visiting the Sobibor site, Nuremberg trial testimonies and a photo album left behind by the camp’s commandant. Blatt himself died in 2015 at age 88, but his daughter helped give input to the project.\n\n“It all starts with a script — you know, it is Hollywood — and we go back and forth with the museum and look at it for accuracy,” says Vince Beggs, museum experience specialist at Magnopus, who has worked on hundreds of museum exhibits and programs. “If we deliver the wrong information, we’re going to fail. We spent a lot of time on: What’s the story? A lot of people have memories of being at Sobibor and we’ve seen those published, but this is specifically Thomas’ perspective.”\n\nWhile Magnopus has an array of eye-popping virtual reality and AR tools at its disposal, including some developed in collaboration with Epic Games, the goal was always to approach the app as an educational tool rather than a piece of gee-whiz tech. “Anything that felt like a computer game, we stepped away from,” says Barron. “We had to treat the subject matter with utmost respect and not try to make it theatrical. The fact that prisoners escaped is a compelling enough story, so we just had to depict it as accurately as possible.”\n\nFor Holocaust Museum L.A., which is currently closed as it undergoes an expansion that will double its footprint in Pan Pacific Park, the app offers a way to continue its mission at a time of rising antisemitism fueled by ongoing conflict over the war in Gaza. According to an audit conducted by the Anti-Defamation League, antisemitic incidents in K-12 schools jumped 135% in 2023 over the prior year. “When you look at what we’re facing, the statistics are horrific,” says Kean.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Magnopus is exploring other ways it can collaborate with the museum on cutting-edge educational tools, including an app in which users would enter the pages of a Nazi children’s propaganda book to learn about how German youth were indoctrinated with antisemitism. “Reaching out to subvert children is hideous, but it’s something that we have to not turn away from but rather delve into and share with others.”\n\nHaving spoken about the Holocaust to thousands of young people over the years, Davids is encouraged by the fact that future generations will have new ways to engage with this tragic chapter of history.\n\n“It’s very heartening for people like me to know that these new techniques come along that will foster this education,” says Davids, a photograph of whose mother is included in the app. “We don’t simply learn about history — we learn from it. After people like me are gone, somebody has to speak for us. Who speaks for us? Whatever is left, whatever can be preserved.”\n\n1st Lt. Nathan B. Baskind was killed in Normandy after D-Day. His body was never returned, but thanks to dedication and new technology, his is one of the site’s few Jewish funerals\n\nBy BENJAMIN MACK-JACKSON, Times of Israel, June 30, 2024. Click for full report.\n\nNORMANDY, France — Samantha Baskind never met her great-uncle Nathan, a Jewish officer in the United States Army who was killed in action during World War II more than 80 years ago. But today, “Uncle Nate” is changing her life in ways she never could have imagined.\n\nGrowing up, Samantha heard stories about her uncle’s life and service — a proud family man, American, soldier, and Jew. But the circumstances surrounding his fate were a mystery.\n\nFirst Lt. Nathan B. Baskind was killed in action during the Battle of Cherbourg on June 23, 1944, and his body had been deemed “unrecoverable” for decades. Unbeknownst to his family, Baskind’s remains were interred in a mass grave at a German war cemetery, commingled with the very soldiers he fought against.\n\nLast week, that changed, and Baskind now rests under a Star of David at Normandy American Cemetery in France, thanks to exhaustive efforts that transcended culture, language, and religion, closing a remarkable saga that united former enemies and brought closure to a still-grieving family.\n\nBorn in 1916, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Baskind served in the US Army’s 899th Tank Destroyer Battalion, commanding a platoon of four M-10 tank destroyers. On June 6, 1944, he landed at Utah Beach on D-Day. On June 23, just 17 days later, he lost his life fighting in Normandy.\n\nAfter Baskind’s death, his father, Abe, persistently pursued information from the Army about his son’s fate for several years. In July 1949, Abe finally received a definitive letter stating that Baskind’s remains were “unrecoverable.” The letter, penned by Lt. Col. W.E. Campbell, concluded with the following: “May the knowledge of your son’s honorable service to his country be a source of sustaining comfort to you, who gave your loved one under circumstances so difficult that there is no grave at which to pay homage.”\n\nAccording to a report published last month by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), Baskind and another soldier were ambushed while scouting ahead of their tank destroyers. Although wounded, the second man escaped and reported Baskind as killed, but attempts to retrieve his body were unsuccessful. After the war, records revealed Baskind had been captured, died in a German hospital, and was buried in Cherbourg. In 1957, the German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge) found Baskind’s identification tag, but his remains could not be individually identified and were interred in a mass grave at the Marigny German War Cemetery alongside dozens of German combatants.\n\nCase cracked by a New Jersey genealogist\n\nThe rediscovery of Baskind’s resting place began with Eric Feinstein, a genealogist from Clifton, New Jersey. In 2022, Feinstein noticed Baskind’s name in a photo posted on the German War Graves Commission’s website and, recognizing its non-German origins, investigated further.\n\nAfter learning that Baskind was Jewish, Feinstein contacted Operation Benjamin, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the memories of Jewish-American servicemen and women who made the ultimate sacrifice. Shalom Lamm, the group’s co-founder and chief historian, immediately recognized the importance of this story. With circumstantial evidence pointing to Baskind being buried in a mass grave at Marigny, Lamm contacted Baskind’s family, who expressed their desire to have the remains disinterred and given a proper Jewish burial.\n\n“Every part of the process was fraught with difficulty,” Lamm said. Jewish religious and ethical considerations posed a challenge, as such an exhumation required approval from religious authorities.\n\nThe Operation Benjamin team flew to Israel to meet with leading Torah personality Rabbi Asher Weiss, who was initially hesitant but eventually gave consent and support for the project.\n\nGerman and US soldiers at Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany honor Nathan Baskind’s remains after their excavation. (US Army)\n\nThe team then reached out to Steffen Seibert, the German Ambassador to Israel, who understood the historical significance of recovering a Jewish American officer from a German mass grave and facilitated contact with the German War Graves Commission.\n\n“He’s a very special guy who clearly cares very deeply for the Jewish people,” Lamm noted.\n\nOperation Benjamin then secured permission from German and French officials to exhume the remains and have them DNA tested.\n\n“At every level, we were dealing with senior decision-makers, and everybody understood it, everybody got it,” Lamm said.\n\nIdentity confirmation through DNA\n\nDespite harsh weather conditions and acidic clay, which made DNA recovery challenging, Operation Benjamin successfully exhumed the remains in December 2023.\n\nThe excavation of the Nazi mass grave where Nathan Baskind was buried, overseen by Operation Benjamin. (Sabina Cowdery/Anibas Photography via JTA)\n\n“It’s not often that we have experience testing bones of this age,” admits Erin Sweeney McBride, the vice president of forensic operations at Bode Technology, a Virginia-based private DNA laboratory tasked with identifying Baskind’s remains.\n\nThe identification process began with testing four femurs and one humerus. A small section of each bone was ground into a fine powder, mixed with reagents, and soaked to isolate the DNA, creating what is known as a DNA extract.\n\nThe initial focus was on nuclear DNA, which is unique to each individual, but this method is challenging with degraded samples.\n\n“Many people think it just has to do with the age of the sample, but it actually has more to do with the conditions,” Sweeney McBride explained. “The level of degradation, and things like water, sun, or bacteria all degrade DNA. In this case, we were worried about the water table in the grave and the bacteria, as well as the age.”\n\nDespite the challenges, there was initial success.\n\n“We showed likelihood for a match, but we needed more support to confirm,” she said.\n\nOperation Benjamin CEO Shalom Lamm speaks at the funeral of 1st. Lt. Nathan B. Baskind, who was buried in a German mass grave after being killed in WWII and recently reburied after DNA testing proved his identity, in Normandy, France, June 23, 2024. (Benjamin Mack-Jackson)\n\nNext, Y-chromosome DNA testing linked the remains to a paternal relative, confirming a match to Baskind. Finally, mitochondrial DNA testing on the humerus provided a maternal match, solidifying the identification.\n\n“The conditions on the ground were horrible,” Lamm recalled when describing the exhumation. “But we got spectacular matches. God was looking out for us.”\n\nCharles K. Djou, secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), the governmental agency that administers US military cemeteries overseas, explained the significance of such success.\n\n“Modern technology, with DNA identification, has allowed us to be able to make identifications that several decades ago we simply lacked the technology to be able to do,” said Djou. “We are very excited that with 21st-century identification technology, we can identify a soldier and give them the proper burial.”\n\nUS soldiers carry the coffin of 1st.

(Benjamin Mack-Jackson)\n\nReburial in Normandy\n\nThe ABMC now faced a unique challenge with the reburial of Baskind at Normandy American Cemetery, combining military honors with Jewish traditions.\n\nThe cemetery serves as the final resting place for over 9,300 American soldiers who fought and died in the Normandy campaign, including 152 Jews, though none of the burials had been closely monitored for adherence to Jewish law at the time.\n\nNew burials at this cemetery are exceedingly rare, reserved only for soldiers who were previously missing in action and have been recently discovered and identified. Baskind’s reinterment is one of four such occasions and the first-ever funeral held there according to Jewish tradition. The ABMC allowed a full military and full Jewish burial, described by Lamm as “the height of elegance and the height of dignity.”\n\nOn June 23, 2024, exactly 80 years to the day since 1st Lt. Nathan B. Baskind was killed in action, his remains were buried under a Star of David.\n\nDjou emphasized the rarity and significance of this event.\n\n“We are burying Lt. Baskind with full military honors, 80 years after his death,” he said. “The majority of our burials occurred after the world wars. It’s a great testimony to the United States and the American people that we make a commitment to bring our fallen heroes home, no matter how long it takes.”\n\nSamantha Baskind speaks at the funeral of 1st. Lt. Nathan B. Baskind, who was buried in a German mass grave after being killed in WWII and recently reburied after DNA testing proved his identity, in Normandy, France, June 23, 2024. (Benjamin Mack-Jackson)\n\n“Today, a jagged scar in my family will be at least partially healed,” Samantha Baskind said during an emotional eulogy at the funeral. “We are here to finally pay homage to a great Jewish American war hero, a son, a brother, an uncle who was well-loved and desperately missed. May his memory be for a blessing.”\n\nDecades of uncertainty and unanswered questions finally reached a poignant and meaningful conclusion.\n\n“From a family perspective, there’s closure,” Lamm said. “There’s nothing worse than a child being lost and not knowing where they are. It’s the saddest thing in the world.”\n\nThe ceremony was attended by military officials, dignitaries, representatives from the involved organizations, and members of Baskind’s family. Among those present was Jonathan Conricus, a former international spokesperson for the IDF, who reflected on the significance of the ceremony.\n\n“We are standing here at the solemn, but I would say happy, occasion of finally bringing to eternal rest the remains of Nathan B. Baskind, who was put to a proper American grave amongst his fellow American soldiers,” Conricus said. “We should be thankful for the sacrifice that these brave young men and women made, the ultimate sacrifice. We should be respectful of their heritage, and I think Operation Benjamin does that in a tremendous way.”\n\nSamantha Baskind lays a stone at the new gravesite of 1st. Lt. Nathan B. Baskind, re-interred in Normandy, France, June 23, 2024. (Benjamin Mack-Jackson)\n\nConricus also stressed the lessons to be drawn from WWII, particularly the need to remain vigilant against hatred and bigotry.\n\n“Many people are complacent when they are faced with hatred, when they are faced with racism, and bigotry, and antisemitism,” he said, underscoring the ongoing duty to stand guard against new forms of evil and antisemitism, drawing parallels between past and present struggles.\n\nWhen reflecting on the historic nature of Baskind’s identification, disinterment, and reburial, Lamm turns to the Torah to explain the “why” of Operation Benjamin’s mission. After 210 years in captivity, as millions of slaves prepared to leave Egypt under the leadership of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, the narrative pauses to highlight a crucial moment in the Exodus.\n\n“At the very height as they are about to leave, boom, the narrative stops dead,” Lamm said. “It totally stops, and the verse says, ‘Moses took the bones of Joseph with him.’ Because the Israelites promised they would take him out of Egypt.”\n\nLamm believes this act underscores a timeless lesson: “You never leave your heroes behind.”"
