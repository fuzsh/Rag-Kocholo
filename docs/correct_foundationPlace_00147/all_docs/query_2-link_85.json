        "text": "Your local small businesses and service organizations are very generous. They will often donate $50 to $500 when they are asked. Combining smaller donations from several sources goes a long way to help pay for your MSI field trip! The best way to request this type of support is by writing a letter. You can use the following letter template and this three-step action plan to successfully earn contributions toward your next field trip.\n\nIdentify prospects.\n\nIf your school permits, talk with parents to see if they have recommendations\n\nfor businesses to approach. If you don’t know the business community of your\n\nschool very well, you can use the “What’s Nearby” feature of a map\n\napplication online.\n\n​\n\nWrite your request letters.\n\nWrite your request letters. Use the instructions and template linked below to\n\nprepare request letters to your prospects. Not every request will result in a\n\ndonation, so always put out more requests than you think you need. If you\n\nhave artwork or photos from your MSI program last year, include those.\n\nVisuals are powerful.\n\n​\n\nRequest Letter Instructions\n\nRequest Letter Template\n\nSample Request Letter\n\n​\n\nSubmit your request.\n\nIf possible, submit your requests in person and try to talk to a manager or the\n\nowner. People give to people. Leave them with a hard copy of your request\n\nmaterials. If you send them in by email or mail, a follow up phone call is critical\n\nto help call attention to your request. A week or so after you submit your\n\nrequest, follow up again. If you are emailing, attach an electronic copy of your\n\nrequest materials as a convenient reference."
