Filled it out, sent it in, and a month later I got the call that I had won the award! But that’s not the end of the story…they told me that the San Francisco chapter likes to award their no-strings-attached funds IN CASH in a Pulp-Fiction style LIGHT UP BRIEFCASE. We rendezvoused in a secret location (ok, a posh tea shop) and the cash was mine! An all-around terrific experience that I would recommend to anyone. Thanks for the tip, Brainard!”\n\nBest,\n\nSawyer\n\nIf you want help with grants, it is just a click away at Praxis Center.\n\nWant to see how the cash was delivered to her?\n\nSee the image below –"
