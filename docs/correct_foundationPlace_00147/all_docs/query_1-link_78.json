        "text": "“A people who have not the pride to record their own history will not long have the virtues to make their history worth recording; and no people who are indifferent to their past need hope to make their future great.” — Jan Gleysteen <strong>Chortitza</strong> <strong>“Old”</strong> <strong>Colony</strong>, <strong>1789</strong> The story of the first settlement of the Flemish Mennonites at the junction of the <strong>Chortitza</strong> and Dnjepr Rivers in <strong>1789</strong> in Imperial Russia is replete with drama, tension and tragedy. It is no small task to establish a peaceful Christian community in an undeveloped steppe and to create an environment where the pioneers and their descendants could thrive and prosper. Within a century the <strong>Chortitza</strong> <strong>“Old”</strong> <strong>Colony</strong> had become perhaps the most prosperous community in the area north of the Black Sea and its industries were leading the way in the region’s booming economy. After some initial faltering the <strong>Chortitza</strong> Flemish Gemeinde was to become the most stable and flourishing of the Mennonites in Russia. It is a precious gift of God to build a large congregation of 4000 and more members out of a population originating from different Gemeinden and various regions in the Vistula Delta in Royal Poland and West Prussia. God had granted the Flemish pioneers noble and spirit-filled leaders who remained true to their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in the face of extreme adversity and even later in the most perilous of times under the Soviets. Through the leading of the Holy Spirit the family and church divisions caused in the Molotschna <strong>Colony</strong> by Separatist Pietist predators were successfully refuted and the Mennonite Church in the Old <strong>Colony</strong> was able to build upon the sure and everlasting foundations of Christ’s commandments and to abide in the spirit of His love and reconciliation. In this issue we feature several articles dealing with the first settlement of Flemish Mennonites in Southern Russia and their subsequent development. The work of historian David G. Rempel, (1899-1982), later of Menlo -being the Magazine/Journal of the Hanover Steinbach Historical Society Inc. Preservings $20.00 No. 20, June, 2002 The German Wehrmacht at the entrance to the turbine building of Dnjeproges Hydro-electric dam, June 1941. To the left is the Hydro-electric dam; right, in the rear, the Island of <strong>Chortitza</strong> with the Mennonite village established in <strong>1789</strong>; and middle, the bridge over the “new” Dnjepr (east channel). The road to the right was the main route for those coming from the dam and travelling north to the village of <strong>Chortitza</strong>. The small island rock formations in the foreground are the “Three Brothers”.

(A 1997 photograph from a similar point is published in Diese Steine, page 60.) The picturesque scenery in the area surrounding the confluence of the Dnjepr and <strong>Chortitza</strong> Rivers included its steep rocky cliffs, sand beaches, islands, ports, ferrys, bridges, and after 1932, the hydroelectric dam, “Dnjeproges”. These were important features of the daily landscape and life-world of the Old <strong>Colony</strong> Mennonites. Park, California, was important in laying the groundwork for a history of the first settlement at <strong>Chortitza</strong> in <strong>1789</strong> and subsequent events. We are proud to feature his article “From Danzig to Russia: The First Mennonite Migration,” reprinted from Mennonite Life, January 1969, pages 8-28. Enjoy. The Editor.
