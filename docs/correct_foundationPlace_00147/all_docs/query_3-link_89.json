The Board recognizes that we did not do enough to communicate this change to the community. We've heard from some folks that this felt odd and was surprising, and we have decided (along with Destin) to go back to the previous way of doing things next year.\n\nThank you!\n\nThanks to everyone who participated in this year’s Project For Awesome!\n\nMark your calendar for next year’s event on February 14-16, 2025!\n\nTrack the status of your physical and digital perks here.
