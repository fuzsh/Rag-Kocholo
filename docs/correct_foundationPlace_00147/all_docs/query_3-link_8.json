        "text": "About Us\n\nAwesome Buffalo is a giving circle that awards $1000 cash to weird, wonderful, and timely projects that make Buffalo more awesome.\n\nWe’re entirely volunteer-run and self-funded. We don’t distribute grants, and we’re not organized as a nonprofit. We simply give no-strings-attached cash to one awesome project every other month.\n\nIf you’ve ever enjoyed the rainbow crosswalk at Elmwood & Allen, like Elton John did, you’re welcome.\n\nDeadlines\n\nPlease submit your project ideas by 6pm on the following dates:\n\n►► February 28\n\n►► April 11\n\n►► June 13\n\n►► August 8\n\n►► October 10\n\n►► December 12\n\nApply For $1000\n\nWhat makes a project Awesome?\n\nWe use the following loose criteria to select projects. Consider addressing these areas in your application:\n\n►►Is it awesome?: Is it unique? A new idea? Something that may be unfundable through traditional means? We’re looking for your Silly Walks and your bus stop jazz clubs.\n\n►► Will $1000 make an actual impact? : We try to support individuals and small groups, rather than organizations who’re already well-funded. We’re looking for the small, but mighty projects for which $1000 will make a huge difference. Be as specific as possible; tell us exactly how the cash will be spent, so we can best understand your idea.\n\n►►How will the project help the Buffalo area?: It’s important to us to fund projects that directly support and impact our neighbors in the Buffalo-Niagara community. We’ll consider projects outside city limits, but maybe not all the way in Rochester. Pssst… they have a chapter too!\n\nWe don’t typically fund:\n\n►► Personal use: We think you’re really awesome, but we can't give you $1000 for personal salary/a car/vacation/rent payment/home reno/pony.\n\n►► Charities, foundations, organizations: We’re primarily interested in new ventures and not the continuation of an existing organization. But existing organizations with a specific, creative $1000 project can apply!\n\n►► Promotion: We want to hear all about your awesome idea and how we can help fund its happening, not just its posters.\n\nParticipate\n\nInterested in joining our circle as a donating member? Drop us a form to join the waitlist here!\n\nMedia Coverage\n\nBuffalo Business First: Got an awesome project? This group of Buffalonians wants to fund it.\n\nBuffalo Business First: Everyone has crazy ideas. Why not bring them to us?\n\nBuffalo Rising: Awesome Buffalo\n\nBuffalo Rising: RAWTools Buffalo | Guns to Garden Tools\n\nBuffalo Rising: The Little Free Sled Library\n\nBuffalo Spree: Awesome Buffalo Funds More Projects\n\nLatitude - The 43North Podcast: Making Buffalo Awesome\n\nNews 4, WIVB-TV featuring Colored Girls Bike Too\n\nNews 4, WIVB-TV featuring Feed Buffalo\n\nNiagara Frontier Publications\n\nWBFO coverage of Be Awesome Day\n\nWBFO featuring Rainbows on Allen"
