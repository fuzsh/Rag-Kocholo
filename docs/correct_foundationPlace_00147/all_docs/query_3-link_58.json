        "text": "Something Alice said really resonated with me. “What do we do with the privilege we have been given [to be a leader and have a voice in this community]?”\n\nAs a self-proclaimed inclusion and empowerment advocate, I mentioned to Alice that I had been thinking a lot about what empowerment looks like in our community. Maybe a fund that invested in or incubated inclusive products or startups, maybe a monthly financial award recognizing incredible disability advocates… When I think about what we as individuals can give to others, it comes down to time, relationships, and money. On that last point, I couldn’t help but think about the #DisablePoverty campaign that highlighted the limited employment opportunities and therefore the limited upward financial mobility that people in our community continue to face. It breaks my heart.\n\nThen Alice told me she applied for a $1,000 microgrant from the San Francisco chapter of The Awesome Foundation. The Awesome Foundation is a community of autonomous chapters of self-organized “micro-trustees” that distributes $1,000 grants, no strings attached, to projects and their creators. Each trustee commits to contributing $100 per month and the contributions together are what creates the $1,000 grant.\n\nThat’s when we came up with the idea to create a global chapter of the Awesome Foundation focused on disability, consisting of trustees who all identify as having a disability. I knew Alice and I were committed, but would we be able to find 8 others who were just as excited about supporting our community?\n\nLess than a month later, we had our group of founding trustees for Awesome Disability. We are:\n\nTiffany Yu - San Francisco, CA, USA\n\nAlice Wong - San Francisco, CA, USA\n\nAlexandra McArthur - Raleigh, NC, USA\n\nIan Smith - Oakland, CA, USA\n\nJason Boberg - Auckland, New Zealand\n\nJohn Fazzolari - New York, NY, USA\n\nLiz Henry - San Francisco, CA, USA\n\nRiad Masoet - Cape Town, South Africa\n\nVictor Pineda - Berkeley, CA, USA\n\nWalei Sabry - New York, NY, USA\n\nWe are not a 501(c)3 non-profit or a corporation, we’re just a group of people with disabilities who want to pay it forward to our community.\n\nHow the Awesome Foundation Disability works:\n\n10 trustees (on average) each contribute $100 per month.\n\nPeople with awesome ideas submit an application for the grant (in English, please).\n\nThe trustees review and discuss the applications, and pick the best one.\n\nThe winner is given $1,000, no strings attached.\n\nThe process is repeated every month, in order to spread the awesomeness.\n\nHere are a few projects that have been funded by other Awesome chapters:\n\nMovable Chair funded by Awesome Boston\n\nDisability Beyond Borders funded by Awesome Sydney\n\nMobility Scooter Cruise Control Circuit funded by Awesome San Francisco\n\nWheelchair Adapted Stand Up Paddle Day funded by Awesome Oahu\n\nIf you’ve got an awesome idea and $1,000 would make it a reality, apply for a grant."
