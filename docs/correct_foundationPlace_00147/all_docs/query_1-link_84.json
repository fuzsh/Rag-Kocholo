        "text": "Do you think it's time to level up your presenting and influential communication skills? Confident and competent speaking skills are career defining skills. Don't miss out on opportunities because you just don't have the skills and confidence to step up and speak up. My 2-day Present on PURPOSE signature programme is a game changer. Thousands of executives, workplace professionals, business owners and professional speakers have completed this programme and haven't look back. They all now have the skills required to move closer towards their professional or business goals. But don't take my work for it. This is what Caitriona Forde - Cyber Security Expert, Speaker and Trainer had to say. \"I have been on a massive professional development journey over the last few years and I can honestly say this was the best training I have ever attended. It is insightful, entertaining and a gentle push outside your comfort zone\". Caitriona Forde - Cyber Security Speaker and Trainer Wednesday August 7th and Friday August 9th (I have 2 places left) $1,495 per person or $995 August special only for small business owners, not for profit team members and consultants. PM me for full brochure and how to secure your place. Presented on my Perth Hills studio with stunning views, an occasional alpaca peering in with full catering over the 2 day experience. I look forward to working with you. #presentationintelligence #presentationacademy #presentationskills #publicspeaking #communicationskills #influence #leadershipdevelopment #speaking #professionalspeaking #executivedevelopment\n\nStop asking experts and professionals to speak or work for free. This week I was approached by yet another organisation who is organising a high profit sell out conference. On the request for the experts to fill their conference programme, the email stated; 'Please note: we do not pay any of our keynote or sessional speakers'. This one came from a full ‚Äòfor profit‚Äô organisation who charges a healthy sum of money to attend every one of their events. I am assuming the caterers, the venue, the AV are all not free and the conference organisers themselves are not working for free on the day. Yes, there might be a little bit of ‚Äòexposure‚Äô and yes the more you speak the more you speak, but it‚Äôs really about respect for not only professional speakers and experts but anyone in the professional services industries that constantly gets asked to work for free. I get it, it may be an opportunity to get in front of your ideal customer but you can still do this and still get paid what you deserve for sharing your expertise. If we all stop saying yes to speaking or working for free in the hopes of ‚Äòexposure‚Äô (unless it really is a strategic decision or a cause you really want to support or give back to), event organisers will realise that they don‚Äôt have a conference without the expertise of these professionals. Many of these professionals who you are asking to work for free have spent decades, thousands of hours and a many times a huge financial investment to master their skills and hone their craft so they can be of service to others, and so they can build a sustainable business to support themselves and their families too. Please think about this next time you ask someone to work for free. Or at least offer them a fair exchange in value. What are your thoughts? Are you constantly being asked to work for free? #stopworkingforfree #valuepricing #fairexchangeofvalue #professionalspeakers #experts #professionalservices #eventprofs\n\nInfluential presentation skills in the workplace are critical future skills for career focused professions. August special for small business owners/consultants or not for profit employees. Only $995 for 2 whole days of learning and fun. Fully catered too. ‚ù§Ô∏è Are you ready to finally invest in these skills? Come and join me, like thousands of professionals over the past 3 decades, to learn the art, science and practice of influential presenting, leadership communication, storytelling and human behaviour and lots more (Leadership from the front of the room). Only 6 in each master class for maximum learning and participation. Ditch the public speaking 101 - learn how to present, run meetings, deliver workshops and speak professionally and on PURPOSE. Wednesday 7th and Friday 9th August PM me for full flyer or visit my homepage on my paulasmith website. I can't wait to meet and work with you. üòä #presentationacademy #presentationintelligence #leadershipcommunication #leadershipdevelopment #publicspeaking #presentationskills #publicspeakingperth #perthevents\n\nBrilliance at every level. WA should be very proud of this team. The Kwinana Splits. Winners of the State Management Challenge. For the 2nd year in a row the City of Kwinana has taken home the prize. This is the first time any local government has won consecutive years. It's been awesome working with the City of Kwinana again, first with presenting (so proud that they scored 10 out of 10 for their outstanding presentations) and yesterday we had a hoot and some serious work as we dived deep into critical and creative thinking and leadership communication in preparation for the National finals in Brisbane, and with the continued work they do in the community. Thanks to Fiona for trusting me with your team for yet another year and the continued mentorship for the team from Fiona and Alicia. You all rock! Go Kwinana Splits #presentationintelligence #presentationacademy #presentationskills #publicspeaking #criticalthinking #creativethinking #communicationskills #leadershipcommunication #managementchallenge\n\nAttention executive and professional women. Are you feeling a little burnt out, or perhaps you've been working really hard at both work and home lately and you just need a break. Not just any break though; one filled with great conversation, professional development, master classes, visits to local iconic places, wine, great food and loads of chocolate all in a luxury vineyard in the South West. Not all retreats are created equal. There are no 20km hikes, silence days, hours of mediation or oversharing. Unless you want to of course. Come and join me from Friday 13th - Monday 16th September and a group of likeminded women at The Real Retreat. Make new connections, invest in new learning and have some fun, did I mention fun? Full programme, room options, costs and how to register on the link below. 10 places only. First in best dressed. Or send me a DM to hold a room or cottage. I hope to share a special time with you all in the South West. https://lnkd.in/gWG8ue_y #retreat #corporatewomen #womeninleadership #leadershipdevelopment #neuroscienceofleadership #scienceofpersonality #storytelling #therealretreat #corporateretreat\n\nAnother fun filming day on Foxtel's The Couch TV show with Neesha Seth and Fred Mafrica. This episode I am talking all about the science of personality, the nature vs nurture argument, the Dunedin study and the REL8 human behaviour and relationship profiling approach and why and how this can impact on our communication, team relationships and leadership skills. (and a side chat on Granny Smith and a snack of chocolate honeycomb) You can catch the episode on Foxtel on Sunday nights or search show number 776 on YouTube. And since it's such an interesting topic, I've been invited back next week to chat about part 2. Science of personality continued...Who are you? If you have a presenting, leadership or human behaviour topic you would like me to chat sometime this year on the show let me know. #thecouchtvshow #foxtel #scienceofpersonaility #leadershipdevelopment #communicationskills #REL8 #presentationintelligence #leadershipcommunication"
