Our goal is to fund initiatives that can significantly benefit from a $1000 grant. We seek proposals that demonstrate a clear vision and a thoughtful plan for the utilization of the grant funds. Here's what makes a project a perfect candidate for our grant:\n\nIDEAL PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS:\n\nLocal Focus: Your project should be based in the Triangle area, with a special emphasis on creating positive change in Durham.\n\nSignificant Impact: We look for projects where a grant of $1000 can make a substantial difference in achieving success.\n\nClear Plan: Applicants must present a well-defined strategy for how the grant will be utilized to advance their project.\n\nPROJECTS NOT SUITABLE FOR THIS GRANT:\n\nFor-Profit Ventures: We do not provide funding to start or support for-profit businesses.\n\nOverly Ambitious or Infeasible Projects: Proposals that seem too ambitious or unrealistic in scope are less likely to be selected.\n\nNote: Your idea is yours alone. We don't want a stake in it. We just want to help you make it happen!\n\nFind out more about the Awesome Foundation at awesomefoundation.org üëè."
