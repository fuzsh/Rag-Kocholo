These micro-grants, $1000 or the local equivalent, come out of pockets of the chapter's \"trustees\" and are given on a no-strings-attached basis to people and groups working on awesome projects.What do you mean by \"Awesome\"?Every chapter interprets \"awesome\" for itself. As such, awesome projects include initiatives in a wide range of areas including arts, technology, community development, and more. Many awesome projects are novel or experimental, and evoke surprise and delight. Awesome sometimes challenges and often inspires. Browse some grants on the chapter pages of this site to see what we mean! We're still waiting for something with dinosaurs (hint, hint).Please see individual chapter pages for preferences & restrictions.\n\nUnlock full grant details and application links\n\nEligibility\n\nAnyone is eligible for a grant â€” individuals, groups, and organizations alike.
