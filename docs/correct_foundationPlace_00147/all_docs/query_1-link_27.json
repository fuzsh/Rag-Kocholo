        "text": "The Sanlo team had an amazing time at our annual offsite in Austin, Texas. As a fully remote org, it's important for the entire team to get together at least once a year for some bonding. We kayaked 🚣♀️, went to a FC Austin game ⚽, rode horses 🏇, went to Top Golf ⛳, ate 🍖, and drank 🍻. And we did a little work as well. 😎\n\nDavid Gardner / Lvp thanks for chatting with me! From what David's personal story in gaming (a really cool one by the way) to habits successful founders share to what's invest-able now to trends to watch. \"You've got to make tough calls and move fast. That's probably the one advantage that a start up has. It's a rapid strike force, it's not a super tanker. Super tankers have different advantages and you've got to really play to those strengths. Learning, adapting, making progress and having a really good fast cadence and making those course corrections along the way are key.\" 👀 YouTube --> https://lnkd.in/dH2Gs6E2 🎧 Apple Podcasts --> https://lnkd.in/d3uT7qfY 🎧 Spotify --> https://lnkd.in/dsMUprAf #gamingVC #venturecapital #financinggames #gamingindustry #videogames #aiingaming #lvp\n\nWebshops are becoming very popular in mobile gaming, as they boost revenues as much as 25% by avoiding Apple & Google fees. You need to drive high volumes of player traffic to max out your webshop's success. In our latest blog post, we breakdown tactics that drive players to a webshop without triggering commissions, including: Community & social media - flex your community by adding webshop promotions into your cadence of posts across all your social accounts and communities. In-game promotions without any direct links (EU only) - alert players with discounts, exclusives, and offers available on your webshop, but don’t link directly out as that will trigger commissions. SEO - Be ready to catch those people who are actively looking for your webshop. Retargeting - Target your current active players and drive them directly to your webshop; scale will be limited, but strong ROAS is very possible. Read the full blog post and sign up for our waitlist below. We're are working on something big.
