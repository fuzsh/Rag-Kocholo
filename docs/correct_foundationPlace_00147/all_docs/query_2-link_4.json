        "text": "The Chicago chapter of the Awesome Foundation has been funding awesomeness in Chicagoland since the summer of 2011. We've funded everything from little free libraries and puppet shows to electron microscopes and a temporary mini golf course on Milwaukee Avenue with no-strings-attached $1,000 grants. See a map of the projects we have funded over the years. We are proudly and excitedly connected to the wider Awesome Foundation network.\n\nWhat's your awesome idea? Do you have an awesome idea that would make your Chicagoland-based community awesome? Of course you do. Apply today for a $1,000 no-strings-attached grant to make your awesome idea a reality. Our short grant application is available here. We generally review applications on the third Tuesday of every month, and respond to applicants anywhere from 2-6 weeks after receiving the submission. If you are unsure if your idea matches the types of project we fund, please review our past award winners listed above.\n\nPublic art in memory of Mark Rogovin. While we will continue to fund a variety of Awesome ideas, the Awesome Foundation Chicago Chapter will be awarding 10 mini-grants of $1,000 in memory of Mark Rogovin, noted Chicago muralist, who served as an apprentice to David Alfaro Siqueiros on the March of Humanity in Mexico. He was the founder of the Public Art Workshop, and the Peace Museum, and was known for fostering public art and mentoring young artists throughout his lifetime. These grants will be awarded through the Awesome Foundationâ€™s regular monthly review process (please indicate that you are interested in this award). Projects must feature a public art component and take place in the Chicago metro area. Projects that include mentoring young artists, or are applications from young artists just establishing their careers are of special interest. Awards will be selected as they merit (may not be given out once a month) until the funds are exhausted.\n\nJoin us!\n\nIf you'd like to play a direct role in deciding what we fund next, become a trustee! Our group is comprised of community members who commit to the following:\n\nFinancial Contribution: Commit $100 per month in the interest of Awesome in Chicago for at least 6 months. This contribution goes towards the $1,000 award we grant each month.\n\nParticipation: Play an active role in accepting and reviewing applications, and in deciding with the other trustees by consensus who will receive the grant.\n\nNew Projects: With no specific leadership roles, every trustee is a leader in their own right. We like trustees to come up with new project ideas for the chapter to do, and help organize the group into getting it done.\n\nTrustees serve until they resign. If you're interested in joining us as a trustee, we invite you to complete our rolling application, and we'll try to get back to you shortly.\n\nKeep in touch! Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and sign up for our newsletter."
