        "text": "(Español sigue!) Awesome Poughkeepsie is a community-driven, micro-grant program that gives out $1,000 grants each month to selected applicants (community groups and neighbors with great ideas that will positively impact our community). The funds come from a pool created by neighbors and local businesses/institutions and our board meets monthly to vote on who gets the grant.\n\nWe are the City of Poughkeepsie chapter of the Awesome Foundation, an international philanthropy program with almost 100 chapters worldwide. One of the best things about Awesome Foundation is that it removes the main barrier for traditional grant funding: a long, complicated application.\n\n//// ¡La ciudad de Poughkeepsie es AWESOME! Estamos muy contentos de poder aportar más recursos a nuestros vecinos y financiar SUS proyectos comunitarios en nuestra vibrante y diversa comunidad. Nos emocionan especialmente los proyectos inclusivos y que involucren a nuestros residentes.\n\nCada mes tenemos previsto conceder una subvención de $1.000 dólares. Fomentamos una gran variedad de ideas de proyectos, pero favorecemos especialmente los que están abiertos al público y los que forjan nuevas colaboraciones o asociaciones.\n\nHere are ways to be a part of this project:\n\n1. Become a Trustee - Each chapter of the Awesome Foundation is powered by 10 (or more) Trustees who put in $100 each month. We will meet monthly (with a Zoom option) to review submissions and vote on who receives the grant. If you're enthusiastic about this project, but can't afford the monthly dues (and there's still room on the Board), please reach out so we can find a way to get you included.\n\n2. Make a donation – Your donations to the grant pool help us create financial resources for changemakers, local organizations and activists, and dreamers here in our community. Your donation also enables some of our Trustees that can't afford a $100/month contribution at this time to participate, ensuring there is a diverse group of voices from the community in the room (age, race, socioeconomic status, etc.). You can donate one time through the link at the top of this site or if you or your business/professional organization might like to sponsor a seat, please email us. There are perks!\n\n3. Help get the word out - Tell someone about us! Do you know a project that deserves $1000 here in City of Poughkeepsie? Or perhaps someone who might want to join as Trustee? Please help get the word out!\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any questions or if you want to get involved.\n\nThanks!\n\nCo-Deans: Gina McCann, Isis Benitez\n\nTrustees: Anthony Slade, Jordan Schinella, Talent Davis, Tanya Smallwood, Katie Hite, Diamond Mima, Kate Lashua, Liz O'Raffity, L'Quette Taylor, Qiana Bennett, David Henningsen, Natalie Barragan\n\npoughkeepsie@awesomefoundation.org\n\nPhoto of Founding Team July 2022"
