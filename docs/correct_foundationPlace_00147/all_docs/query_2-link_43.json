As such, awesome projects include initiatives in a wide range of areas including arts, technology, community development, and more.\n\nMany awesome projects are novel or experimental, and evoke surprise and delight.\n\nEach chapter provides its own grants.\n\nTypically, ten “trustees” each contribute $100 (or the local equivalent) toward a monthly grant, though some chapters have more trustees sharing the load.\n\nAnyone is eligible for a grant — individuals, groups, and organizations alike.\n\nMost chapters show a strong preference for projects that contribute to their own communities, though some occasionally consider applications from further afield.\n\nTry to apply to a chapter near you, in a location where you have roots, or that you think would have a particular interest your idea.\n\nIf this isn’t possible, you can select “Any” on the application form, or apply to one of a handful of thematic chapters.\n\nMost chapters meet monthly to review applications and decide on a recipient — though some chapters make decisions at live “pitch” events open to the public.\n\nMost chapters continue to consider applications from previous months, however, so there’s no need to apply again unless your idea has changed.\n\nFind out more: https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/submissions/new\n\nRead more here."
