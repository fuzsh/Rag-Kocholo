        "text": "Last year on my 21st birthday eve, I got an email saying I had been selected to be part of Erasmus+ and that was the best new of my life. Ever since then I was waiting for the day I will be leaving and making my way to Spain. On Feb 3rd I left my country and it took 2 days to reach,the first stopover was at south Korea (one day transit).\n\nAfter all the official stuffs for university were done, I immediately left for Palencia City as my campus for forestry was based there.\n\nThe minute I stepped on Palencia, I loved the place, as I am someone who loved small towns and quiet life. My accommodation was perfect for me as it was just behind my university and near facilities like shopping mall and grocery stores. I had two flatmates from Vietnam and Kazakhstan, it was interesting to know about their culture and their ways.\n\nLater, when the university started, I had as classmates 7 Erasmus along with some Spanish students for 5months. For me, it was first time meeting people from Africa, Ukraine, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Columbia and Philippine. I also found a sisterly soulmate who was just like me and surprisingly, she was another version of me though we came from two different countries, spoke two different languages and had a different culture and background. If it wasn’t for her, I would had been very lonely in Palencia.\n\nI am very grateful to Erasmus+ for giving me this opportunity to learn more about myself out of my boundaries and experience such unique and amazing Europe things that not so common in the pacific. After coming to Spain, I figured that I still have a lot to learn about myself and my life and the journey of new experiences should never stop.\n\nI was amazed to visit such a beautiful church in Palencia and learn how they pray, is very unique and different from Christians in pacific. I am happy to learn something new and can’t wait to go back and share these experiences with my people back home.\n\nI also found the simple things around Palencia very beautiful, I tried to capture some. I love the sunsets and the breeze in the summer, it reminds me of home.\n\nIn the university of Valladolid, Palencia Campus, the professors were nice and helpful. Since the language was a barrier, they had went out of their ways to explain things to us. I would say they did it good as first timers to teach Erasmus students, as in Palencia everything is in Spanish.\n\nIt was an amazing experience and it was challenging to learn in a different university, with different work ethics and different teaching tactics. I had my share of ups and downs but I did overcome as it was just 5months of experience which would stay forever in my heart. I wound say that everything was perfect from the time I arrived but there were emotional breakdowns , gloomy days and difficulties to work with some students but I made sure these things don’t ruin my lifetime memory and experience which I would look back to. I believe this will be a string credibility for my CV and later to my work field as I have a different perspective while working with international students .\n\nI am grateful and forever in debt to Erasmus+ for organizing this scholarship for us, developing countries. I am 100% sure that when I start working, I would come back to Spain with my family and visit these places in Spain I had been and also the ones I couldn’t .\n\nI would definitely recommend it for those who are independent, love challenge, love to learn new things and love socializing. They should apply for this scholarship and have this experience of a lifetime.\n\nThe 1st of February 2019 was an extraordinary day. My two days flight began at 07:25 and it took 30 minutes drive from the Papua New Guinea University of Technology to the Lae’s Nadzab Domestic Airport (Papua New Guinea). Furthermore, I visited three more airports: Port Moresby’s Jacksons International Airport (Papua New Guinea), Sangi International Airport (Singapore), and Doah/Hamad International Airport (Quarter). Finally, on the 2nd of February, I set out of the Qatar Airways AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A350-1000 plane at Madrid Adolfo Suarez Barajas International Airport (Spain). Born and raised in the mainland of the paradise island Papua New Guinea, the freezing 2°C (36°F) on arrival was what I lived with and a light jacket was all I needed. On a foreign land with dominant noises in Spanish, all my focus was in the sign boards with directions heading for the ALSA bus station to head for my final destination, the ancient University of Valladolid, Valladolid City, Spain.\n\nAfter two and a half hours travelling through the windy plains from Madrid, I have to quickly unseat the ALSA bus, and headed from a city cab to my designated residence. The following day, I was registered at the School of Industrial Engineering. My residence at University Residence Alfonso VIII provided pamphlets and leaflets of city maps, supermarkets, city buses, parks, museums, gardens, etc… And obviously the interesting visit was museums, where I had the opportunity to visit the National Museum of Sculpture and the Oriental Museum of Valladolid. They house ancient artistic figures and sculptures dated back to the 13th and 16th centuries.\n\nFrom the past two months observations, I would best describe Valladolid as an ancient city equipped with modern technology. Despite the cultural and language barriers, I was able to communicate and mingle into the Spanish lifestyle, thanks to Vodafone for its cheap monthly subscriptions for as low as €5 which is sufficient for using the most important google apps; google maps and google translate. Otherwise, the residence also provided free Wi-Fi and high speed ethernet connections so the Vodafone subscription was only used when away from the residence.\n\nI appreciate the ERASMUS+ KA107 for it ‘TOOK ME AWAY’ to explore the beautiful city of Valladolid and also study in one of the oldest university in the world, the University of Valladolid. I was overwhelmed that the laboratories were fully equipped and staffed with experienced technicians and professors, it was a promise of hope. Lovengly, I had the opportunity to meet beautiful faces all over the world from different countries with different languages, cultures, beliefs, and disciplines. Spaniards were very kind and helpful, easy going, respectful, and committed people. The city streets are well planned with systematic traffic systems, clean, and yes I would assure you that it is uttermost safe for walks during nights.\n\nBeing a student at the School of Industrial Engineering, I was invited to participate in a yearly event called the Makeathon IoT 4.0 in Bejar. It was hosted 180 km south of Spain (Bejar), and was well organised. It was a challenging competition, where within two days, we competed in groups to design an idea into a prototype in the likes of Internet of Things (IoT). It was the best moment for me as an electronic enthusiastic, where I had the opportunity to work in a team of electronic and computer engineering students to contest the emerging IoT technologies of today’s digital world.\n\nIn the midst of the Easter Holiday, I travelled to Burgos with my colleague; a Egyptian masters student (Mahmoud Rashad). The visit to Burgos Cathedral was memorable, a historic monument building which is a must visit site for tourists. Easter Holidays were more festive in Valladolid both day and the nights.\n\nI would love to take the worlds time to write many experiences, but here are some few tips I believe would be most helpful for future trips;\n\nLanguage: Communication is an exchange of information from one point to another or from one person to another and must be understood. In order to understand, a defined and standard language is a requirement. Therefore, try learn some basic and commonly used words and phrases in Spanish, which will be very useful. Also do not forget to use Google Translator!\n\nMobile phone: It is obviously important be sure you have a backup battery, a networked mobile SIM card (like Vodafone or Orange) with a monthly subscription and an International Adapter for chargers not compatible with European standards GPOs.\n\nClimate: Prepare to adapt to the cold climates especially in the winter, so prepare some heavy clothes. Otherwise, the winter is snowless as you would imagine in other parts of Europe.\n\nAs for me, I feel no foreigner living in Valladolid because I knew I was living in the home country of the well known Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez amongst Christopher Columbus, who have discovered my tropical paradise “Papúa Nueva Guinea” back in the 1545. It was originally known to be Papua, the land of “Frexxly-Haired” inhabitants. The ‘Nueva Guinea’ or New Guinea in english was cascaded by the explorer after Guinea.\n\nOf all, ERASMUS+ KA107 is a great and flexible initiative funded by the European Commission which recognises individual applicants that have the features that meets the terms and conditions. It is well designed for life changing study mobilities. ERASMUS+ KA107 ‘’TOOK ME AWAY’’ and I would always remember every single day I spent, lived and studied in the University of Valladolid, Valladolid City, Spain.\n\n¡Hola a todos!\n\nMy name is Madina Tokmurzina. I’m from Nur-Sultan that is located in the northern part of Kazakhstna. I study forestry at my home university in KazATU. For me, it was dream to study abroad but the dreams come true and I will continue to study. I’m glad that I’m in this programme that can make your life more movable. I want to say three magic words: experience, life and learn.\n\nUnder the experience word I want to say that I get a lot of attempts and ideas to my life and improve my language. Also experience from traveling around Spain and Europe with other students that can make you happy.\n\nUnder the life, I’m getting more active and more open than before in my life and it’s good. When you see different cultures in all over the world, you can share your cultural knowledge with other people. Furthermore, when I travel I learn about different cultures and people that can be part of my experience in life. In general, my life is getting open and activited. Nevertheless, I like the life and the culture in Spain. The food, the squares and the cathedral are amazing. I can say a lot about life in Spain which will not fit here 🙂\n\nAnd the study, that is the most important part of our International Programme. I want to say that I really learned a lot about my speciality and the way how professors are teaching. Now, I can share and use part of the study in my country because nowadays, not all new technology we could use is common everywhere. Furthermore, my goal was to improve my academic English skills and learn about my speciality.\n\nTo conclude, I want to say that the International Semester Erasmus+ is a great programme to improve yourself and surrounding environment. Because here, they opened more my view to the environment.\n\nThank you to the International Semester Erasmus+ KA-107 Programme. Muchas gracias a la Universidad de Valladolid y al Campus La Yutera.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMadina Tokmurzina, Kazakhstan\n\nI am a student of the Erasmus + Nazik Teshebaeva. It is now two months since I arrived in the city of Valladolid, Spain. In the early days it was very difficult to accept the fact that I was so far from my native country. I came from Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia. This is my first time in Europe and everything is new and interesting for me. Starting from buildings and ending with people. It’s all different and it’s very cool. I study at the Faculty of Commerce. The faculty is very different from our faculty in Kyrgyzstan. The teaching staff is very strong, everyone knows their subjects at the highest level and conduct classes very interesting and most productive. We also have Spanish courses where the coolest teacher Elena teaches us.\n\nIn my free time I travel around Europe. I traveled in Madrid, in Barcelona and in Portugal. And all this thanks to the Erasmum + program. I am extremely grateful to the program, as well as to the international department for such an unrealistic opportunity to get free education, travel, meet new people from different countries, share my experience with them and learn more from them. It is like a golden contribution not only to my future, but also a contribution to the future of students from many countries.\n\nToday, my goal is to learn more about Spain and the people living here, to get to know their language and culture.\n\nMy name is Aizhan. I’m from Kazakhstan. I study at “World Economy” in my country. In Spain, I study at the faculty of commerce. A year ago, I won a grant for studying in the University of Valladolid and it’s a great honor to study here. It’s my first experience studying in a foreign country and a good opportunity to practise my English and learn a new language.\n\nI arrived to Spain on the first of February. It was really difficult at the beginning. At first, I sort out my documents, which were necessary for the university and for opening my student card in bank “Santander”. Then, I visited some shops, supermarkets and the centre of the city, starting the adaptation to the life in Spain. I always shoot videos and I hope they upload them. Living here, I realized that the life in Spain is different than in Kazakhstan and, of course, everything is interesting and new for me. I live in a flat, which is not far from my faculty, with 2 girls; Eulalie, from France and Kamila, from Kazakhstan, who came here to study with me. They are very nice.\n\nNow I want to talk about studying in Spain. I chose 3 subjects to study and all of them are very interesting and creative. I met many people from Europe, Asia, etc. Many of them are communicative and friendly. I started to learn Spanish. I’m very interested in it.\n\nI went to three cities of Spain: Madrid, Barcelona and San Sebastian. Two weeks after my arrival, I decided to go to Madrid, the capital of Spain, with my friend from Kazakhstan. It’s very beautiful city and I enjoyed it. Honestly, I like Madrid more than Barcelona. At the end of February, I went to Barcelona with my friends from Kyrgyzstan. It was a memorable trip, we visit such a different places.\n\nNow, I organized a trip with my friends. Our trip includes some countries such as France, Luxembourg, Netherlands or Belgium. I believe that it will be the best trip.\n\nI’m really happy to study in Spain. I want to thank Erasmus + for this great opportunity. I hope that this period of my life will be the brightest.\n\nJust like yesterday, I was leaving my hometown not sure what to expect of the new country. Now I am almost three months in Spain with a lot of good memories, new friends and great experiences. I do not even know how to start writing about my experience of being an exchange student in Valladolid University for whole five months.\n\nWell, since I had done my exchange year in the United States, I thought why I don’t try a new country with a different culture and a new language?”. Because I would be on my own, having adventures, and fulfilling my dream of having something different. Pretty soon, at the end of my freshman year, I applied for Erasmus+ Program and I decided that the exchange semester would give me more immersion and would improve so much my knowledge. Finally, I received the congratulation letter and it was the best day in my life! I was the happiest one and I burst into tears!\n\nValladolid is a small city with beautiful places, views, nature and friendly people. I like everything about this city, I like weather during February because it was the warmest winter in my life without snow. Trees are always green and cherry blossom was the most beautiful part of spring. This city has many places to visit, such as the Cathedral of Valladolid, the largest Gothic church of San Benito, Santa Cruz or Campo Grande. I love all these places. During the weekend, when I have free time, I just like to walk around city and take pictures of these historical places.\n\nSince I am doing international semester, I met many people from different countries. All of us have our own view of the world and sharing it made me feel more open-mind. Every teacher and student had an impact in my life, they gave me a lesson and because of them I am trying to be my best own version.\n\nSince I had limited time in Spain, I decided to travel as much as I can. For two months I had visited many places and tried new Spanish foods. Moreover, when I came first to Spain, I could not understand anything, but after taking Spanish classes I improved my language. I like Spanish festivals, traditions and movies. After two months of being in Spain, I improved my communication and adaptation skisls, and I am ready for more adventures.\n\nShould anyone have told me a year ago that I will become a student in the University of Valladolid, one of the oldest universities in the world, and even give an interview to the local Castile and Leon television channel, I wouldn’t have believed it. Nevertheless, today with ERASMUS+ KA107 PROGRAM all of this became a reality.\n\nOne of the first things I did after arriving in Valladolid was going to see the University. The only glance at the artfully decorated baroque façade of the University of Valladolid was enough to embrace how long and important part of the history of Spain is kept behind its walls. I felt greatly honored to have a chance to study in such a place.\n\nThis semester I study at the Faculty of Commerce on the International Semester in Commerce program. For me, one huge difference between a usual university life in Gomel State University and Erasmus+ student life is the group size and its national composition. Whereas my home university group is quite small and not very diverse, here there are usually more than 40 students of various nationalities attending similar lectures with me. My new classmates are students from Egypt, Georgia, The Netherlands, France, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, the Philippines, Albania, Poland, Italy etc. Thanks to this every day I learn a lot of new and interesting things not only during classes, but also from simple communication with new friends from different countries.\n\nI also want to share my impressions of the educational process. Time on lectures passes quickly, professors try to present materials in an international context, explaining it with help of examples and events happening in the modern global economy. From the entire course of disciplines my favorite one is International Trade led by Professor Hernández, an expert in the field of international economic relations and trade with Asian countries. On his lectures we have learnt the basics of organize business abroad, the peculiarities of exporting to China and Japan, how to adapt the product for enter markets of these countries. I think that the knowledge gained in the framework of International Trade will be useful for me as a future specialist in International economic relations.\n\nFor the remaining period of academic mobility I plan to improve my Spanish language and travel more around the gorgeous country of Spain, full of breathtaking landscapes and ancient cities.\n\nAnd finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the program coordinators at the University of Valladolid for being very attentive and welcoming! I know that Erasmus+ participation is an experience that I will never forget!\n\n¡Hola a todos! My name is Zhamal, and I’m from the country which is located in the heart of Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan. A year ago, if I were told that I would study in Spain, I would never have believed it. I always dreamed of studying abroad, but I never left my comfort zone. But dreams tend to come true :).\n\nNow, I study at the University of Valladolid, in one of the oldest universities in Spain. Now comes the third month of my experience being an Erasmus + KA107 program student. If on arrival, I barely understood people, now I can calmly buy groceries in the supermarket, ask for a location or just talk to Spanish people :))\n\nValladolid is the city of the kindest people. The people here are very polite, they will always help with any questions, so I had no problems with adaptation. Also, the food here is just awesome! We tried many different national dishes, such as paella, tortilla, different tapas and we can confidently say that all of them are very tasty.\n\nWhat about lessons, they are very interesting and informative. In each lesson, we have different discussions and debates. I like the fact that here every lesson takes place in an unusual form for me. There are a lot of people from different countries studying in our group. We love to walk through the night Valladolid after lectures.\n\nI would like to express my gratitude to the Erasmus + Ka107 program and the University of Valladolid for the most beautiful days spent in Spain. Upon arrival in my country, I’m impatient to tell all my colleagues about my wonderful experience.\n\nThe two months that I have been in Valladolid have been very overwhelming. As my first time alone away from home I didn’t know what to expect, but this has been a life teaching experience. The Erasmus gave me the opportunity to visit this new country and its beautiful cities, people and culture. Being here has brought me many different feelings and experiences.\n\nMany things have happened to me here that I had to learn how to cope with on my own. I got sick, I almost got lost, had to cook my own food, do my own groceries and school is totally different from everything I’ve ever experienced before, but I am thankful for all of this. I am thankful because I am growing with these new experiences. If I hadn’t come here it would have taken me longer to learn to take care of myself.\n\nOther great aspects of being here apart from learning from the situations mentioned before. I’ve met very friendly, generous and helpful people that are making my stay here a lot better. I’ve met people that are always here for me with any help I need and I know that I will never forget them. I have also seen places that took my breath away, that made me feel so alive, happy and in peace that I didn’t even want to leave. Valladolid is a beautiful city. It is very calm, respectful and cosy.\n\nMy experience at school has been totally new to me. Coming from a different continent there are great differences in education. The education I’ve received before isn’t very compatible with what I am learning now therefore it has been a bit confusing for me to follow the classes in the best way. Although, it has a good side, because I am learning things that I might have never had a chance to learn in my country.\n\nI am thankful to this program for giving the chance to live this experience. Everything I’ve lived here has been unexpected. The only thing that I was sure of was that I was going to grow in all aspects of my life, and this has been very true.\n\nMy name is Masha. I’m a student from Kharkiv National University of Radioelectronics. I study Industrial engineering as a Erasmus student in Valladolid now. I want to tell about this city, university and my student life here.\n\nAs I said, I study industrial engineering here. My group is quite large, about 30 students from around the world . My group is very friendly and I am very grateful for this experience. Thanks to this, I learned a lot about different cultures, made friends with people from all over the world. About system education here, its completely different from my home university. Big emphasis is placed on teamwork, I think it’s useful for our future. I also like the fact that the university has a virtual site where you can get all the materials that were in the lectures. It is very convenient when you were absent on the lectures. We also add all homework and laboratory work to this site. What is equally important is that you can contact the teacher via chat.\n\nI can say with accuracy that this is the best semester in my student life. Many companies organize travel and entertainment programs for students, so that every weekend I do not have to be bored During this time I was able to visit 8 cities in Spain such as Bilbao, Gijon, Salamanca,San Sebastian, Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante and Madrid and I hope in June I can visit the south of Spain. I was also able to visit Portugal, Italy, France.\n\nI am very glad that thanks to the Erasmus I had the opportunity to get such a great experience at the University of Valladolid. During this time I have learned a lot.\n\nI came to Spain as an Erasmus master student to do my study in the school of Industrial Engineering, in the second semester of 2018/2019 academic year. And I have arrived at the beginning of Feb 2019, so I have stayed about two months in Valladolid of Erasmus study period until now.\n\nValladolid is an amazing city as it combines the modern style of life with historical buildings such as different type of museums which are spread over the whole city. Also, Valladolid is quiet and has pretty clean streets, systematic traffic and sunny weather but its climate is hard as it is very cold in winter and hot in summer.\n\nThe people, in Valladolid, are almost friendly but most of them speak only Spanish and a little bit speak English so you should learn Spanish quickly to can deal with them in a more convenient way. The obstacle of language was a challenge for me but with joining the crash Spanish course at the centre of languages at the University of Valladolid it becomes easier because of interesting teaching methods that my teacher Elena uses.\n\nAs a student of the industrial engineering school in Valladolid, I have gotten the chance of participating in a competition called Makeatheon IoT 4.0 which was held at Bejar around 180 km from the south of Valladolid for two days. It was good for me because I have been included in a pure Spanish community, so in this small period, I have learned more new things concerning the Spanish language, lifestyle and infrastructure.\n\nThanks to Erasmus mobility exchange program at the University of Valladolid, I have made more new relationships of friends from many countries all over the world. Also, it is the first time to visit the European country which has a diversity of cultures, regions, foods and different weather.\n\nI have many tips which I would like to share them with the current and new Erasmus students who will come to Valladolid later;\n\nFirst of all, you should prepare heavy clothes for winter as it is very cold in Valladolid.\n\nSecondly, the Erasmus study period is a great chance but short, so you should discover Valladolid as possible as you can also if you can travel to other cities it will be better.\n\nThirdly, although, the public transport in Valladolid is available and much comfortable, I think that walking is very useful. In most cases, when I went out to visit many places of Valladolid, I preferred walking on feet until reaching these places to enjoy and know more about everything in Valladolid.\n\nFinally, professors and administrators at the University of Valladolid are friendly and they do their best to make the environment of teaching as attractive as possible also, the university has many facilities, classrooms and laboratories with advanced equipment so, Erasmus student should use all that, in the sake of a better study.\n\nMy name is Kamila Ryskaliyeva. I’m from Kazakhstan . I am 21 years old. I am a student of the Kazakh University of Economics, Finance and International Trade. Since childhood, I have long dreamed of knowing many languages, traveling and getting acquainted with the cultures and traditions of other countries.\n\nI want to tell you about my incredible and vivid experience at most ancient University of Spain in the University of Valladolid. This is my first time in Europe and abroad in general. For me this is an unforgettable experience. Here I am exactly two months and I am in love with this country.\n\nWhen I first arrived I was a little difficult with the language since I had never been in an environment where they speak Spanish and English. My level of Spanish was basic and I studied it on my own. When my friend and I arrived in Valladolid it was very cold and we did not know how to get to our hostel and we asked for help the woman standing at the bus stop, she really helped us and I am very grateful to her. I really like people here, they are very kind, open, smiling and ready to help. I was also very touched by the attitude of people towards animals. This once again speaks of their generosity and kindness.\n\nI study Commerce. With me in the group study 46 people from 17 different countries: Russia, France, Italy, Germany, Egypt, Albania, Turkey, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Netherlands and so on. It is simply unbelievable that, so many different nationalities from different points of our planet Earth can gather in one audience. Thanks to this, you can get acquainted with other cultures and their customs, practice other foreign languages, learn something new from them. Here are very experienced and competent professors, they are always open, you can safely ask them questions that concern you, treat us with understanding and support us in our endeavors. Their activities motivate you and help you to grow. Although the system and method of teaching are completely different from teaching in my country by the fact that here we work in groups, various interesting tasks for example with constructors to create own company or to explore your country’s market. I found out more about Trade and Consumer Behavior in Spain and different countries . I know that this experience will help me in the future in spite of the fact that in my country I am studying in another specialty. Erasmus+ program helped me to realize myself as a person, to become more open, responsible, helped my self-improvement and broadening my horizons. Thanks to all this, you begin to think differently and you become more stronger, more independence.\n\nDuring these two month I managed to visit several cities in Spain, such as the capital of Spain-Madrid, San Sebastian, Barcelona. These are incredibly beautiful cities, each city is filled with its own history, atmosphere, rhythm of life, culture, traditions and each of them has something special that attracts and inspires. In the city of Valladolid there are a lot of museums, beautiful places, parks, different types of wines are produced here, as well as many places where you can eat and have a good time with friends and relatives.\n\nI really liked the Spanish national dishes Paella, Tortilla, Croquettes.\n\nThis country never ceases to amaze me every day more and more. During the two months of my stay here, I learned a lot and realized that you cannot stop believing in yourself, always striving for the right thing and dream. I am very glad that thanks to the Erasmus + program I had the opportunity to get such a wonderful experience at the University of Valladolid and study in such an extraordinary country as Spain. I am very grateful to this program for helping me make my dream come true.\n\nI am Nguyen Thi Kieu Chinh – a student in a university of Vietnam’s northern mountain province. I spent my fourth-year university in a peaceful place with familiar people and boring life. I had thought that my life would go like that until the day when I got a scholarship of Erasmus + KA 107 program to study in Spain which have made my life change positively so far.\n\nAfter two months in Valladolid, Spain; I am totally surprised and happy about my maturity. I still remember exactly what happened to me the first month: I was a shy girl lacked of some basic life skills. I had many troubles about finding the way home and the way to school as well. I experienced culture and language shock for an asian person who first lived and studied in the European environment. I lost weight significantly cause I could not be familiar with the food here and walked a lot. However, I always said to myself: “ Don’t worry! Pull up your socks”.\n\nThe experience in the first month is extremely memorable for me.\n\nFortunately, in the hardest time, I received the goodness from people around me: the instructors of Eramus + KA 107 team helped enthusiastically us to not only do necessary documents but also handle problems which happened after that; the teacher explained our questions about subject; the owner of my flat always called to ask about my new life or if my European flatmates were friendly and the kindness from strangers was warm enough to decrease my lonliness.\n\nThere is a movie called “Auberge espagnole” , which I feel represented by it’s motto : “Where no one speaks the same language, but everyone understands you”. By living in a multicultural environment, I must accept a truth: not everybody have the same english voice and culture. This has meant that I need to learn how to respect and be open with religion and features of each country. All the people will understand the problems you have faced in an unfamilliar place. Trips gave to me the interesting friends who contributed to have a full – color life in Spain.\n\nMy lovely friends\n\nGoing abroad is a great opportunity to discover food culture around the world.\n\nMuseum of Cervantes\n\nTwo – months time is not too long, but is enough to awake the power of my mind as the name of the song: “What does not kill you, makes you stronger”. Currently, I can be able to be confident to say that: Valladolid (Spain) is a marvellous turning point in my life. And you? Let’s enjoy and write your story!\n\nThis was not the first time for me to visit the beautiful Spain, but it was the best. I felt – during these 5 days of Erasmus+ KA107 academic staff mobility – inner peace while seeing old civilization meets modern culture, and old buildings side by side with modern architecture. This feeling reflected on my behaviors even now after returning home.\n\nAcademic Part\n\nThe target of the visit was to train and increase my experience in thin film characterization techniques. I worked under the supervision of my academic supervisor during the training, Prof. Juan Ignacio, at the GdS OptronLab. This kind, cheerful, and smart man taught me a lot on both academic and personal terms. I have recognized and learnt how to use scanning electron microscope with cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) measurement to characterize semiconductors. We did different measurements on zinc oxide and gallium oxide thin films and made use of Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the penetration depth of electron beams into the measured films. He also trained me on other devices and techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and LBIC (Light Beam Induced Current), and learnt me how they are very useful in mapping the surface of solar cells and other thin films and hence introducing useful information, and also how they are used to measure the degradation of power laser diodes. Prof. Juan provided me with different scientific papers of him to read and gain knowledge of the topic. The PhD students I met there were very cheerful people and very collaborative. At the last day in the lab, I was surprised that Prof. Juan gave me a hard copy of his book on spectroscopic techniques as a gift, which was very unexpected and happy surprise.\n\nLife Part\n\nI focused on ancient buildings such as Catedral de Valladolid, Iglesia de San Pablo, St. Mary la Antigua, and Palacio de Santa Cruz. I saw the people of Valladolid interesting their afterwork times and enjoying their life. I can never forget those people from the international relations office of the university of valladolid, specially Lidia, whom were ready at any time to give me hands of help, which gave me a very positive impression at the start and the end of my visit.\n\nI wish this visit was more than 5 days, but this very short period will never be forgotten for my whole life.\n\nMuchas Gracias everyone ^_^.\n\nThis is my last week in Spain.\n\nToday I took a printed map and made a long walk around the most significant places of Valladolid. I looked at the city with eyes of a newcomer. I paid attention to every authentic balcony of residential buildings, people eating out, ancient walls of numerous monasteries, old couples holding hands, green trees (though it January).\n\nAt the beginning of my exchange I realized that one can basically reach every place by walk. In September and November I walked in average 13 km a day. I wanted to discover every corner of the city and enjoyed doing that, because here are a lot of wonderful places to see. Today I had the warmest feelings and realized that all these places have become a part of me.\n\nI was lucky to come here on the week of “fiesta”. I tasted delicious food and drinks, saw people dancing and having fun. Valladolid met me with all its welcoming beauty and I immediately got immersed into the atmosphere of Spain. Every day I had exciting events, every week I tried something new. It may seem funny, but I still remember the moment when I saw a palm tree in front of the Faculty of Letters. It was the very first palm tree in my life.\n\nHowever, Erasmus is people. It’s hard to find an alternative place where one can make acquaintances with such open-mined people who have totally different life experience. Here I met my soul-mates, those with whom I feel completely comfortable no matter what we are doing. We climbed mountains, sang in karaoke, went to other countries, danced on the streets, made fake tattoos and celebrated life in all its diversity.\n\nThis Erasmus is forever in my heart.\n\nBy the way, on Tuesday I am having the last party with my lovely friends. Wish me not to cry my eyes out.\n\nIt’s nearing the end of November, which means I have already spent almost three months studying in Valladolid. In this time I’ve learnt so much about the city’s beauty and rich culture, but there are also a few lessons that I wish I had known prior to my arrival. As such, here are five tips that I think would be useful to a Caribbean student about to embark on their Erasmus journey.\n\n1) Although it doesn’t snow here, the cold in Valladolid is no joke. Prepare as much as you can for the winter because I can attest to the fact that the Caribbean body is not equipped to handle extreme cold. In my experience, the hardest thing to cope with is the cold air and strong winds. Scarves, gloves and turtle-necks will soon become your best friends.\n\n2) Don’t let the initial culture shock throw you off. Valladolid is extremely different from the Caribbean, not just in temperature but also in the temperament of its people. In the beginning, it came as a shock to my fellow Trinidadians and me when our casual ‘Hola’ to strangers on the street were met with blank stares, but we soon realized that this is just one of the many cultural differences between Europe and the Caribbean which we have come to respect over time.\n\n3) Prior to Valladolid, I had never lived apart from my parents. One thing this Erasmus experience has taught me is how to be self-reliant. I’ve started experimenting with cooking and generally just enjoying my independence, making mistakes along the way but learning and growing from them. Thus, my third tip is to not be afraid of living on your own because it’s an ultimately exciting and fulfilling experience.\n\n4) My fourth tip is to travel as much as you can. Spain is a gorgeous country, so different from the Caribbean landscape, and although we’re here to study it’s important to find a good balance between work and play. It’s extremely easy to buy a bus ticket from Valladolid to Madrid, Segovia, Salamanca or any of the other neighbouring cities. There are also organized tours done by the Erasmus Student Network or Erasmus Viajes that take the hassle out of planning your own trip. Some of my best memories of Spain so far have been made on these trips and I highly recommend exploring the country as much as possible.\n\n5) My final (and most important) tip is that your time in Spain will fly by, so make the most of it while you’re here. Five months seems like forever in the beginning, but in reality the weeks go by quicker than you can imagine. So my advice is totry new things, meet new people, go on adventures in and around the city, step out of your comfort zone and enjoy this experience as much as possible. This opportunity only comes once in a lifetime and you have the power to make it as exciting as you can!\n\nSaloni Kissoon.\n\nAt the end of last year, I started my Master study in Vietnam National University. And now I am studying in Spain follow ERASMUS+ KA107 program. It is amazing for me. With the supported from UVA International Relationship office, I took a flight for 21 hours to Spain. Even a bit tired because long time traveling, I felt very exciting to come to other countries, especially a European country. Spain is the third country I’ve come, but it is the most expecting one.\n\nTHE FIRST DAY IN VALLADOLID\n\nThe first day in Spain, I came to UVA International Relation Office to complete my documents, it is very attractive with beautiful, peaceful place and friendly people.\n\nTHE FIRST DAY IN PALENCIA\n\nOn the next day, I went to Palencia, where I will study for next 5 months. On the way from Valladolid to Palencia, I saw many beautiful place that I’ve never seen before. It really exciting for me and I think that I will have wonderful memories about the time studying here. Also I had some days off before going to class, so I could have time for finding an suitable flat for living in next 5 months. With the helps of staffs in Palencia International Office, I found a flat which is very convenience to study and also to live.\n\nTHE TIME TO STUDY\n\nI took the class that very interesting with professor from UVA and 3 kindly classmates. We went a lot to the field trips to study. It is really good for us to study both by presentation and practically. My classmates are very friendly, we study together, help each other to understand the gaps for solving problems. We have plan to visit many other beautiful places that are suggested."
