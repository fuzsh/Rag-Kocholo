WELCOME TO AwesomeStPaul

The Awesome Foundation has arrived in St. Paul and is giving $1,000 grants to awe-inspiring ideas. St. Paul is a unique community with thriving neighborhoods. We want to fund projects that serve our community through the lenses of the arts, education and social outreach. We love projects that are solving problems and bringing joy to people in St. Paul. Do you have a great idea that needs some financial assistance to become a reality? Apply for a grant from the St. Paul chapter of the Awesome Foundation. What are you waiting for?

Guided by a firm desire to promote diverse ideas and uplift small projects throughout St. Paul, we are a small band of volunteers who want to make our city more awesome than it already is. At least 12 times a year, we give away no-strings attached $1,000 grants to creators, big thinkers and dreamers. We’re not a charity and we have no interest in making a profit or owning your idea. 100 percent of the money we collect goes to our grantees. We have no overhead expenses. AwesomeStPaul is simply a group of locals ready to open our wallets to make a positive impact on our community. If you’ve got an idea and you need some financial support to take your initiative to the next level, you’ve come to the right place.

WHAT WE FUND. We fund real programs that will make a real impact on the lives of people in St. Paul.

WHAT WE DO NOT FUND. We do not fund the writing of personal books or launching private businesses, travel, conference expenses or projects that don’t impact large numbers of people living in St. Paul.

OUR PROCESS. Applications are due on the last day of each month. Our trustees meet the second week of each month. Directly after we vote, we announce the monthly winner and arrange for distribution of the $1,000 grant. GRANT FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL APPLICANTS.

Your application will remain active until you are notified by e-mail that it is no longer being considered.

See what our grantees are saying about their $1,000 2022 Awesome Grant...

"We have just under 40 participants this season, which is a sizable jump from last year, but still only about half of where we were pre-COVID. Your grant provided a lot of shoes & headgear that our kids have been using (and abusing!) this season. We were able to get our sponsors at Adidas Wrestling to give additional substantial discounts with our order, and were able to secure over $4000 of equipment for the kids. Thanks again for your support!" Matt Vinez East Side Wrestling Club
