We're proud to be representing the city of Brotherly Love!

Please continue to submit your exciting, Awesome projects to us, and we're looking forward to reviewing, vetting, and selecting an Awesome idea. We will select up to 2 winners, every other month, on the second Tuesday, so make sure you get your ideas in by then. And of course, in the process, we're looking to meet as many of you as possible, in hopes of making Philadelphia as Awesome as it can be!

Things to keep in mind when applying:

Is this project achievable?

Does it serve the community?

Will the $1,000 complete the project, or will it merely assist in completing it?

Be as detailed as possible when describing what you will do with the money.

Can you get funding elsewhere?
