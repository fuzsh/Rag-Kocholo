(Although everyone knows that MS Windows never crashes, its \"features\" sometimes cause some consternation.)\n\nDesigned for the Btrieve Database Administrator who needs to manually recover data from a database file or determine the cause of a failure from time to time, these tools are used internally by Goldstar Software as part of our \"Btrieve File Forensics\" -- the study of corrupted files in search of a root cause. Previous versions of our BART toolkit were released with no or limited documentation. The new Pervasive Data File Recovery Toolkit is now shipping with a complete manual that covers all aspects of the file recovery process.\n\nFeatures of the Pervasive Data File Recovery Toolkit include the following:\n\nCopies of \"standard\" data analysis and recovery tools from Pervasive Software, in one place.\n\nBCheck and BUTIL for file analysis\n\nBClean, ByteChg, and BUTIL for file recovery\n\nCopies of Jim Kyle's DataSave and DSave3a file recovery tools, in one place.\n\nCopies of \"advanced\" 32-bit data analysis and recovery tools from Goldstar Software -- some now available for the first time ever!\n\nBreaker & Maker: Splits large files into smaller pieces for easier manipulation\n\nBtrvInfo & ListStat: Better BUTIL -STAT analysis\n\nDXUtil: A Better BUTIL with some advanced features for recovery\n\nFindBad: Locates the bad \"spot\" in a file\n\nFindUNF: Finds a specific record in a UNF file\n\nGREP32: A general purpose search tool\n\nGSRecover: Our most powerful data recovery tool\n\nKeyCheck: Checks files and indices for corruption\n\nKeyData: Reports on internal file page and key statistics\n\nKillPre: Gets rid of Btrieve 5.x PRE files\n\nListDPg: Finds and renumbers data pages in a data file\n\nLPLookup & PPLookup: Data file analysis tools for manual efforts\n\nMoveRecs: Data migration tool\n\nPATCheck: Quickly checks files for PAT corruption\n\nPATFix: The new version of the old standby tool!\n\nReadFile: A file viewer that works from the command line\n\nVarCheck: Analysis tool for variable-length files\n\nOlder DOS versions of some of these same tools\n\nSample files in various versions to show different internal constructs\n\nDamaged files with various types of corruption to show how to fix each type\n\nTrial downloads of Pervasive PSQL v11/v12 and Pervasive.SQL V8 to allow you to work with files from the 5.x format all the way through the current 9.5 format\n\nA fully-licensed deployment engine of Btrieve 6.15.430, with the needed patches to address the infamous \"PATFix\" bug\n\nTrial downloads of other useful third-party software, including Hex Workshop, UltraEdit, BTSearch 2008, and many more\n\nThe original version of this toolkit was supplied with in-house documentation only. This new release includes a 180+ page manual with the following chapters:\n\nCore Computing Concepts: Important general concepts of computer theory\n\nCore Pervasive Concepts: Important general concepts for Pervasive files\n\nFile Viewing and Manipulation Tools: Tools you can use to dig into your files\n\nIdentifying Database Files: Ways to verify that a file is a Pervasive data file\n\nPointer Types: A review of the various pointer types seen in data files\n\nThe File Control Record: Details about the summary information stored at the front of each file\n\nThe Page Allocation Table: Information about the critical Page Allocation Table (PAT) which allows the database to find pages within a file.\n\nThe Alternate Collating Sequence Page: A frequently-used page type\n\nThe Data Page: Information about interpreting pages holding your data\n\nThe Variable Page: Information about how variable-length records are stored in the data file\n\nThe Index Page: Basic information about indexing to better understand corruption\n\nTypes of Database Corruption: Commonly seen types of corruption , and their sources\n\nDatabase Diagnostic Tools: A review of standard and advanced data diagnostic tools from Pervasive, Goldstar, and other sources\n\nSimple Database Repair Tools: Standard data repair tools for easy problems\n\nAdvanced Database Repair Tools: Advanced data recovery tools for those tough problems\n\nAdvanced Database Repair Techniques: Walk-throughs of various file recoveries showing the use of several tools\n\nHands-On Diagnosis: Analyzing the provided \"damaged\" database files\n\nFinding More Help: Where to go for more help\n\nSpecial Bonus: Jim Kyle's (RIP) book, Btrieve Complete was the original \"bible\" for Btrieve file recovery, and his text serves as the core foundation for all of our tools.
