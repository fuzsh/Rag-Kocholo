        "text": "Time, as we experience it, is not linear, yet why do we pretend that it is? How do we measure the true value of our time? In this mind-bending session, John K. Coyle will apply creative deconstruction to what we think we know about time, and you will learn how to slow, stop and reverse the perceived acceleration of time most adults feel and experience the endless summers of youth again.\n\nGrab a seat and learn how to:\n\nUnderstand the forces that govern experiential time\n\nDiscover actions you can take to manipulate your perception of time\n\nDesign your life to create intense and memorable experiences that expand time\n\nWhen it’s harder to attack anyone, it’s harder to attack everyone. It might feel like a brain teaser but, simply put, intra-industry CISO collaboration and collective intelligence partnerships don’t just benefit your business’s lagging competitors. Yes, sharing information with your fellow industry CISOs could give them a leg up on the next big risk but, in a world of exponential connectedness, squashing risk early is never selfless.\n\nJoin Kannan Perumal as he discusses:\n\nThe unique benefits of consorting with CISOs in your own industry\n\nWhy some industries are more apt to support these competitor collabs\n\nThe paradoxical support of a business’s ambition and opposition\n\nAs security leaders gain more face time with the board and key stakeholders, communicating in a way that is understood and out of the weeds is getting more necessary. To keep communication effective as CISOs, implementing some of the process improvement tactics to your own style is helpful. Join this boardroom to get insight into:\n\nDeveloping unique KPIs for your security team and yourself\n\nSetting clear goals that allow your team to exceed them\n\nOutcome driven security and how to implement it into your communication style\n\nShadow AI introduced a new layer of risk in a time when security leaders are already grappling with the formidable challenges of managing hidden technical debt and uncovering shadow IT. Today’s digital landscape requires a new approach to risk and governance – one that identifies the shadows already existing in your organization and stops future shadows emerging as you harness the power of emerging technologies.\n\nJoin this session to discuss:\n\nUncovering existing hidden technical debts and shadow IT that inhibit agility, innovation and security\n\nEstablishing centralized risk frameworks and governance that are enforceable and scalable\n\nInvolving the C-suite and end users in establishing and understanding protections to deter rogue IT and AI\n\nPrioritizing and eliminating the cyber risks that matter most is the ultimate goal of security leaders. But how do you validate that your efforts are hitting the mark? It all comes down to well-crafted measurements: metrics that are reliable and easily understood by all stakeholders across the business.\n\nIn this session, we will discuss:\n\nCybersecurity risk assessment essentials and which risks truly carry weight\n\nConcrete approaches to determine effectiveness of security capabilities\n\nCreating simple \"metric cards\" to communicate across stakeholders\n\nSecurity continues to find its way into the boardroom and even into headlines. As the spotlight grows, so does the pressure CISOs face to foster constructive conversations around the value, opportunity and impact of key priorities.\n\nJoin this interactive session to:\n\nEngage with like-minded CISO peers on shared priorities\n\nValidate strategies and uncover new ways of thinking\n\nShare key lessons learned and proven best practices\n\nTable Themes Include: AI vs. Talent; Life After CISO/Board Membership; Leading Through M&A; Cloud Misconfigurations; OT Security; Quantum Computing / Next-Gen Technology\n\nThe complete entanglement of cyber risk with business risk is becoming increasingly more visible. CISOs now have an opportunity to better pinpoint third parties that present a threat to the organization. Yet the increasing complexities of third party, and even fourth party, risk management, prompted by a wide range of evolving threats, demands heightened attention. How can CISOs ensure they have a clear understanding of their vulnerabilities across ecosystems and supply chains?\n\nJoin this session to discuss:\n\nIdentification of vulnerabilities across your vendor landscape to prioritize response efforts\n\nThird-party risk management strategies to safeguard your digital ecosystem\n\nOvercoming resource challenges to prioritize extended supply chain risk\n\nAs cyber threats become more sophisticated and pervasive, enterprises need to adopt an agile approach to network and security that promotes innovation and mitigates risk. AI/ML and zero trust are the key enablers of this transformation, offering visibility, control, and automation across users, workloads, IoT/OT devices, and business partners.\n\nIn this session, you will learn:\n\nHow AI will be used to fight AI and how generative AI will contribute to increased numbers of ransomware attacks\n\nHow the growth of zero trust segmentation will happen in parallel with the rise of firewall-free enterprises, and Zero Trust SD-WAN will begin to replace traditional SD-WAN\n\nHow AI/ML add defensive and analytics capabilities that drive IT and business success\n\nIn the past 12 months, 87% of F1000 businesses were affected by significant cyber incidents as a result of a third-party. And yet, most rely on ‘snapshot in time’ questionnaires. While necessary, snapshots are insufficient by themselves, and must be augmented with continuous monitoring in support of ongoing security operations. This requires a different approach, that includes external threat detection capabilities by using AI across Public Data.\n\nJoin this session to learn about:\n\nThe Public Data opportunity: collect, process, alert across multiple languages / modalities\n\nReal-time external threat detection on a rapidly evolving threat landscape\n\nThe most advanced AI techniques for automating the collection, processing, delivery, and initial analysis of millions of public data sources\n\nVendor selection, pre-partner due diligence and trusted implementation are merely the beginning of a healthy third-party management culture. With those pieces in place, the real work (like battling for constant visibility and enforcing your requirements) begins. You’ll need to prepare.\n\nGather and discuss how CISOs have successfully:\n\nVetted new and prospective third-parties\n\nMonitored their network of existing third-parties\n\nUpleveled and asserted their security requirements and expectations\n\nEconomic trends have tightened purse strings everywhere, leaving CISOs and security leaders to demonstrate ROI and defend their budgets. But ROI is notoriously tough to quantify when the primary return for security investment is reduction in risk. As a result, bridging the gap between security investments and actual business impact can be easier said than done, particularly if your cybersecurity spend doesn’t clearly map to organizational goals.\n\nJoin this session to discuss:\n\nIdentifying the right metrics for quantifying security ROI and business impact\n\nPositioning security as a business enabler, rather than a cost center\n\nAligning security investments to organizational goals\n\nAs more and more organizations adopt a Zero Trust architecture (ZTA), many initiatives overlook the increased prevalence of API-based access to sensitive application functionality and data. As CISOs move forward in their ZTA journey, how can they extend these principles to their API strategy to ensure security from the network layer to the application layer?\n\nJoin this session to discuss:\n\nBreaking the kill chain by stopping infection vectors and protecting against lateral movement\n\nShielding sensitive data and limiting how APIs interact with data\n\nIncreasing real-time visibility across the business to mitigate threats\n\nIdentity Governance and Administration (IGA) has been a cornerstone of compliance programs for decades. Despite this history, the reality of IGA rarely matches the customers’ initial expectations and the needs of the business. Increasingly, customers are demanding that IGA tools not only “check the box” for auditors, but also drive forward Least Privilege to secure their organization in today’s landscape of cyber threats.\n\nJoin this interactive roundtable session to discuss:\n\nExplore current practices, tools, and effectiveness of IGA programs\n\nEvaluate the extent to which IGA goes beyond compliance to bolster security posture\n\nIdentify the critical gaps that may limit the effectiveness of an IGA program\n\nCISOs are now tasked with managing an expanded set of security teams. Now, often managing Development, Application Security and Data Science, the CISO still needs to empower their Security Operations teams to embrace new IT disciplines.\n\nJoin your C-level peers for a private conversation on:\n\nManaging new security disciplines\n\nQuickly and securely maturing your software supply chain\n\nDoing it all with consideration to formalized development and delivery pipelines\n\nAttackers are not breaking in – they are logging in. Exploiting weak passwords, phishing credentials, navigating privileged access, and session hijacking is a threat actor's easiest way to infiltrate your organization, often leading to compromising your resources and applications.\n\nJoin this session and learn how, when done right, identity can be:\n\nYour organization’s first line of defense\n\nThe backbone of your security strategy\n\nThe leverage you need in putting a stop to breaches"
