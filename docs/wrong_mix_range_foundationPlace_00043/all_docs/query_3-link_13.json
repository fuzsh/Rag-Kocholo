        "text": "The OpenSSF serves as a trusted partner to affiliated open source foundations and projects and provides valuable guidance and artifacts, like the top ten Secure Software Development Guiding Principles, to those projects and foundations that encourage security by design and security by default. OpenSSF initiatives should make security easier for open source maintainers and contributors. Consumers of OSS can leverage the output of the OpenSSF to have clear, consistent, and trusted signals to better understand the security profile of OSS content.\n\nThe OpenSSF is committed to encouraging all interested stakeholders to participate in the foundation and its technical initiatives (TIs). The OpenSSF is viewed as an influential advocate for mutually-beneficial external efforts and an educator of policy decision makers.\n\nMore than just advocacy to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) groups, the OpenSSF remains committed to directly facilitating an environment for all perspectives, all backgrounds, and equitable opportunities for global mentorship and education. The OpenSSF remains committed to continuously evolving these efforts to bring more inclusive and diverse software security education, ensuring stakeholder share opportunities to engage in and receive value from OpenSSF TIs.\n\nThe OpenSSF strategy is a set of objectives that aim to enhance the security of OSS by developing tooling and processes that make secure development easier, promote a deeper understanding of best practices, and provide support to innovative technical initiatives. The charter is the source of truth for the OpenSSF, and this strategy builds on the charter.\n\nObjectives focus on tooling and processes designed to ensure consistency, integrity, and risk assessment that strengthen the overall security of the OSS ecosystem. This focus supports the community to develop tooling, processes, and educational assets that accelerate OSS security technical initiatives. Accomplishing these objectives will provide maintainers and contributors of OSS (of all skill levels) the ability to proactively or reactively address both existing and emergent security threats.\n\nThe OpenSSF strategy is outlined across five key areas:\n\nEducation and targeted communication: Develop and promote best practices, guidelines, and educational resources to enhance open source software security awareness and expertise within the ecosystem. OpenSSF advocates with targeted personas (including maintainers, contributors, and consumers) in the OSS ecosystem to improve their default security posture and catalyzes efforts to reduce or eliminate friction in achieving that state.\n\nFacilitate collaboration: Foster a culture of collaboration and inclusion among OSS communities, security experts, and industry stakeholders to sustainably address open source software security challenges effectively with transparent operations and governance.\n\nSustainable technical innovation and enhanced delivery: Support tooling and process enhancements to existing security capabilities. Deliver new security capabilities to open source ecosystems, such as vulnerability detection, incident response, secure coding practices, and actionable standards.\n\nAdvocacy and policy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote OSS security, working with governments, industry bodies, and other relevant organizations.\n\nCommunity engagement: Actively engage with OSS communities through events, conferences, workshops, and online platforms to foster dialogue, collaboration, and knowledge exchange."
