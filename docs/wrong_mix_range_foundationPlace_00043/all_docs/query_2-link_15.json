        "text": "Two decades after the Y2K computer bug put the globe on high alert, a similar problem has emerged at a San Francisco-based software company.\n\nSplunk, which provides organizations with data-sifting software tools, last week revealed a time stamp recognition problem that can cause a “significant inconvenience” for customers. If users fail to apply the company-issued patch by Jan. 1, 2020, the Splunk system “could either add time stamps using the current year or misinterpret the date incorrectly and add a time stamp with the misinterpreted date.\"\n\nThe programming glitch mirrors the one that gripped the world with apprehension in the late 20th century. Also called the Millennium Bug, the Y2K problem was linked to early computer programs that abbreviated four-digit years as two-digit numbers to save space.\n\nThe transition from “99” to “00” was of primary concern, as experts warned that computer software and hardware systems could reset or malfunction overnight due to a time-based error.\n\nStory continues below the gallery\n\nThe 2000 glitch frenzy\n\nOn Monday, Sept. 16, 1996, The Record published an article on Y2K titled: “A Glitch in Time.”\n\nThe newspaper’s first mention of the Y2K phenomenon quoted a representative of Prudential Insurance in Newark who claimed the company was spending $150 million to solve the problem. Software upgrades were needed to prevent loss of coverage and the resulting problems an artificial lapse could cause employers and customers, she said.\n\nThe report warned of potential problems with aircraft-maintenance records, interest-bearing accounts and personal records, all because computers were going to reset to the year 1900 or advance to 19100, instead of progressing to 2000.\n\nBy early 1998, the alarm bells were in full ring, and all were in a Y2K frenzy.\n\nThe 2000s: Xbox, Wii and a new generation of fashion dolls\n\nAncient message in a bottle: Montclair State, where 100-year-old message was found, to hide another for next century\n\nOld-school stores: Millennials miss these North Jersey shops and places to hang out\n\nEdward Yardeni was the chief economist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in spring 1998. He told U.S. senators that Y2K’s widespread damage was elevating the likelihood of a global recession to 40 percent.\n\n“The widespread mantra &mldr; is ‘Bill Gates will fix it [but] It is too big and too overwhelming even for Microsoft,” he said.\n\nBy August, Yardeni upped his estimate of a global recession to 70 percent. Stock prices could fall 30 percent starting in late 1999, he warned.\n\nThe potential for systemic failures in banking, transportation, utility and government operations led to a pervasive initiative to upgrade computers from mainframes to desktops. Elevators, medical equipment and airplanes were thought to be at risk.\n\nOn full Y2K alert\n\nFlames were stoked when British government officials announced that their armed forces would be ready if transportation, utility or emergency services failed.\n\nThe European Commission reported that nations were lagging in finding a fix. The U.N. created the International Y2K Cooperation Center, and President Bill Clinton established a way for state-based companies to share their Y2K fixes.\n\n“This is not one of the summer movies, where you can close your eyes during the scary parts,” Clinton said. “Every business, of every size, with eyes wide open, must face the future and act.”\n\nWorldwide, roughly $300 billion was spent on upgrades — more than $100 billion in the United States, according to newspaper reports. Government systems were the largest concern, leading to widespread publicity about a doomsday scenario triggered by mistakenly launched nuclear devices.\n\nGeoffrey James, a contributing editor for Inc.com, said several hundred billion dollars was wasted as panic set in, thanks in part to a religious doomsday zealot posing as a computer expert. The Y2K bug was an issue, he said, but it was not that pervasive.\n\n\"The premises behind the disaster scenarios were flawed, i.e. cascading faults and unfixable embedded systems,\" James told NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey.\n\nEnd of the world, as we know it\n\nOn Jan. 18, 1999, Time magazine’s cover featured the phrase: “The End of the World!?!” Other publications later pressed forward with “Y2K Checklists.”\n\nThe Record advised readers to obtain, store and safeguard cash, food, water, medicine, flashlights, batteries, generators, fuel and financial and medical records ahead of “Y2K computer failures.” Emergency supply caches were formed in basements for those fearing a computer-driven shutdown.\n\nMany flocked to electronics stores to upgrade software and hardware purchases under the logic that upgrading their computers would automatically take care of Y2K, James said. Best Buy sold new PCs with stickers telling consumers to turn them off before midnight on Dec. 31, 1999.\n\nFor the most part, it was business as usual to start the new millennium. The new year triggered minor faults at two nuclear power plants in Japan, and several dozen horse-betting machines failed in Delaware, CNN and other outlets reported. Airports, banks and websites operated as expected.\n\nThe predicted stock market crash did come — but in March 2000, when the crash of the dot-com bubble coupled with the post-Y2K slump in tech sales, James said.\n\nRelief quickly transitioned to skepticism, though proponents patted themselves on the back in the follow-up media coverage. Needed or not, the upgrades would provide lasting tangible benefits, they said.\n\nHowever, James said the expert predictions of Y2K chaos wasted money and fueled skepticism as a whole — which may have had a lingering effect on issues such as climate change and vaccinations.\n\n\"I think we've learned that you can't believe everything you read on the web,\" he said. \"Because the assumption during Y2K was 'if it's on the web it must be true' — as insane as that sounds today.\"\n\nDavid Zimmer is a local reporter for NorthJersey.com.
