        "text": "Uber has, to put it lightly, had a rough couple of weeks. First, hundreds of thousands of people deleted their Uber accounts after the company eliminated surge pricing around JFK airport when taxi drivers went on strike to protest President Trump’s travel ban.\n\nThen, the company began facing allegations of pervasive sexual harassment from a number of female engineers. These allegations were outlined in a blog posted by a former Uber engineer by the name of Susan Fowler, entitled “Reflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber.”\n\nIn the post, Ms. Fowler, a bestselling author, and widely-respected software engineer details the abuse she received and the systematic and deliberate inaction she met on the part of Uber’s HR and leadership teams.\n\nUpon reading Ms. Fowler’s blog post, I couldn’t help but wonder how such behavior could exist inside of a progressive organization like Uber. After all, they’re a bleeding edge tech unicorn based in San Francisco, the bastion of political correctness and tolerance.\n\nUnfortunately, the cultural breakdown that leads to harassment and poor decision making seems to transcend industry, geography, and sophistication. After observing similar trends in other firms throughout my career, I’ve come to the conclusion that no organization is immune.\n\nWhile I don’t have the silver bullet for solving this pervasive problem, I have learned three things that can help fellow business leaders avoid the pitfalls that are currently plaguing Uber.\n\nDon’t let yourself be blinded by growth\n\nMy mentor and co-founder once told me that “growth masks all things” in companies. While this insight was offered in reference to strategic flaws inside of rapidly growing businesses, I believe it also applies to culture.\n\nWhen a company is in hyper-growth mode, as Uber has been for several years, the excitement and irrational exuberance that takes hold often blind leaders to the problems buried deep inside of the organization.\n\nOne example that comes to mind is that of my former employer, Apollo Education Group. As the parent company of The University of Phoenix, Apollo went through a period of staggering growth in the earlier part of this century.\n\nAs student counts grew and money flowed in, leadership lost sight of some of the more unsavory practices that were taking hold in the enrollment and sales functions of the business.\n\nI suspect a similar situation has unfolded at Uber over the past few years. As their business has taken off, it must have been easy to turn a blind eye to the “frat” culture that dominates certain tech-based companies. The problems existed, but again, times were good, and it was easier to ignore those problems than taking decisive action.\n\nSuccessful leaders, however, can fight the intoxicating effects of success and hyper-growth and summon the courage to address underlying problems, no matter how unsavory they may be.\n\nDon’t allow high performers to hold you hostage\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Ms. Fowler’s blog post was the recurring theme of Uber defending so-called “high performers” who were exhibiting clearly unprofessional and morally reprehensible behavior.\n\nAgain, I think this is far more common than anyone would care to admit. Building a business is hard, and once things start to click, the last thing any leader wants to do is rock the boat. As a result, leaders (including myself) tend to turn a blind eye to the bad behavior of top performers.\n\nThe ultimate test of a leader’s character occurs when they are faced with choosing between the value added by their top performing team members and the fundamental moral and ethical issues that transcend business.\n\nAs difficult as it may be, leaders must put their people and ethical non-negotiables ahead of everything, including performance, profits, and even shareholder interests.\n\nMake culture your number one priority\n\nThe only way to ensure that people and ethics remain sacrosanct is to make culture your number one priority. While this sounds nice, I’ll be the first to admit that it is extremely difficult to do.\n\nGreed is, whether we care to admit it or not, one of the fundamental drivers of business. While most entrepreneurs will readily admit that they want to change the world and make a dent in the universe, the truth is that they also want to get rich.\n\nInvestors too are focused on profits and wealth creation. This is, of course, by no means a bad thing. However, the focus on profits is occasionally at odds with the cultural needs of the organization.\n\nThe temptation to focus on culture only when it’s convenient can be strong. However, the best leaders are the ones that can maintain balance inside of an organization,\n\nThe most effective way to do this is to reinforce the importance of ethical absolutes inside of your organization. Demonstrating that no one is “above the law” when it comes to matters of equality and respect is key in this scenario.\n\nAccording to Ms. Fuller’s account, Uber systematically ignored these ethical absolutes and willingly turned a blind eye to the suffering of its team members. Ostensibly, this was all done in the pursuit of growth and the desire to maintain the company’s hockey stick trajectory.\n\nIf that was indeed their motivation, their efforts have backfired. The company is in full-on crisis mode, going so far as to call in former Attorney General Eric Holder to lead the investigation into the allegations. How this turns out, and what the ultimate impact on the company will be is anyone’s guess.\n\nOne thing, however, is for certain. Business owners and leaders of all types can learn from this scandal and take decisive steps to avoid similar situations inside of their organizations."
