        "text": "When a condominium in Surfside, Florida collapsed and killed 98 people in 2021, the headlines caught people by surprise. But as it turned out, the building's issues had been known.\n\n“The Surfside collapse was a tragic, horrific loss of life,” says Marc Tamres, co-founder and CEO of HomeRun IQ. “Though many people focus on the physical failure, this was a critical fiscal failure. The owners knew for three years that they had a critical problem. Sadly, a key factor was that they didn't know how to pay for it and ran out of time.”\n\nPhysical collapses like the Surfside disaster, fortunately, are rare. “But the fiscal challenge is pervasive,” Tamres says. “It is more the norm than the exception.”\n\nAlthough real estate is the world's largest class of assets, the industry often fails to make long-term plans for those assets, including financial reserves for maintaining and upgrading the properties. Moreover, Tamres says the need for these financial reserves in multi-unit residences (apartments, condominiums and homeowner associations) is rapidly growing due to aging properties, stricter state regulations and heightened environmental concerns.\n\nHomeRun IQ, an MIT STEX 25 startup based in San Francisco, addresses this critical gap in financial planning for these residential properties. The company's workflow software eases the path of collecting, preparing and analyzing building data, and then putting together tailored financial plans directing property resources. Such plans have become critical for owners, managers and underwriters, says Tamres.\n\nInvestigating infrastructure\n\nMulti-unit buildings house about half the U.S. population, and most buildings are old—on average, built 40 years ago. “Nothing lasts forever,” Tamres says. “Physical infrastructure ages just like people, and you have to do things to maintain and sustain that property.” But all too often, when properties do capital planning, they fail to budget for maintaining infrastructure.\n\nThis oversight has created a pervasive problem for multi-unit residences that lack proper reserves and are headed for financial challenges. As a result, California, Florida, New York and other states have passed laws forcing action by these properties. Underwriters such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also have recognized the problem and look to see suitable reserves as a critical factor before making loans in the condominium market. (“If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won't back the loan, a lot of people can't get a mortgage,” Tamres points out.)\n\nThe engineers and property managers that owners hire to generate plans for these real estate assets typically follow the process they did decades ago, says Tamres. The process still usually involves physical inspections, taking notes on paper, transferring that information into a spreadsheet, putting comments in a document, creating a static paper-based file, and performing several revisions. This process is extremely inefficient, often omits key information and is out of date as soon as it is done.\n\n“HomeRun IQ addresses these problems very simply,” Tamres says. “First, we have a very flexible workflow model that adapts to the current needs of the industry. Second, we collect the data, and it is structured in our platform so that financial models can be run. Third, the analysis evaluates the financial trade-offs to make the best decisions. Finally, the analysis is dynamic to deliver the results based on market requirements and to stay current.”\n\nHe emphasizes that these analyses cater to the specific needs of each property—for instance, reports on properties in Florida are tailored to that state's legal requirements. And the software makes it far simpler to keep plans up to date."
