        "text": "You’re invited to an evening of fine dining and exclusive insights at the award-winning Prospect in San Francisco, courtesy of Chief Wine Officer, Qlik and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Alongside your peers, you’ll meet Qlik CEO and former COO of Medidata Solutions, Mike Capone, and discuss the importance of building a data foundation so solid that your AI initiatives will be certain to succeed. While you share common solutions and challenges, you’ll also enjoy a guided fine wine tasting from Santa Barbara winemaker and Master of Wine, Amy Christine. You don’t want to miss this.\n\nAI progresses so fast that most organizations don’t even know they’re not adapting quickly enough. The ones that do, however, are developing devastatingly good data foundations to power AI and analytics. Market leaders are infusing automations into their data processes to drive efficiencies and value, creating the observability they need to swiftly manage costs and risks. Others are pushing the envelope further, with innovative use cases for predictive modelling and using new levels of observability to better define company risks and costs. Asset management giant, Vanguard, uses this approach to handle it’s immense data volumes and workloads, including a daily spike of 60 million concurrent data updates, and bring compute costs down by 30% – are you ready to do the same?"
