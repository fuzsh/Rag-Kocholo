        "text": "What’s new!\n\nENLIGHT’EM: weaving the future of wireless communications with sustainable innovation\n\nThe European project coordinated by Domenico Giustiniano has provided pioneering results to establish the foundation for the next generation of Internet of Things networks. The project has ended in December 2023 marking a major milestone: contributing to design a new generation of wireless systems based on visible light communication (VLC) and on the low power consumption of light-emitting diodes (commonly known as LEDs) for challenging Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios.\n\nJavier Talavante wins second place in the Young Entrepreneurship Awards-Carné Joven de la Comunidad de Madrid with Sensory-FI\n\nThe spin-off, co-founded by Javier Talavante, Dayrene Frómeta, Borja Genovés and Domenico Giustiniano, has stood out not only for its technological innovation but also for its focus on environmental and social sustainability. This achievement in the Young Entrepreneurship-Young Carnet Awards reflects the positive impact that LiFi4Food can have on modern agriculture.\n\nLiFi4Food, revolutionizing precision agriculture with IoT for sustainable and efficient farming\n\nThe Pervasive Wireless Systems PhD Students Dayrene Frómeta Fonseca and Javier Talavante, together with Dr. Borja Genovés Guzmán and Dr. Domenico Giustiniano gave life to a revolutionary solution that promises to completely transform the landscape of precision agriculture. LiFi4Food represents not only a technological milestone, but also a commitment to a sustainable future, where innovation and intelligence come together to boost efficiency in food production.\n\nACM MobiCom 2023: Madrid becomes the epicenter of the technological revolution with a cutting-edge conference\n\nMadrid hosted the twenty-ninth edition of the prestigious international ACM MobiCom 2023 conference, held at the Riu Plaza de España hotel from October 2-6, with IMDEA Networks as part of the event’s organizing committee, with Domenico Giustiniano, as the vice chair.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe group owns several USRP B210s and N310s, used for 5G localization, spectrum sensing and LiFi infrastructure. Training of deep learning algorithms for spectrum sensing are performed using 4xA100 GPUs with 6TB SSD SATA, GPU NVIDIA RTX2080Ti, NUC i5 and NUC i7 boards are used for several activities of the group, such as controlling outdoor spectrum sensors and LiFi infrastructure. The LiFi lab unit of the group includes several OpenVLC boards, it hosts different testbeds based on a large number of OpenVLC boards, moved through the OpenBuilds Acro Systems, and has the software and laboratory equipment to develop new versions and extensions of OpenVLC boards such as Agilent 3000 X-series oscilloscope. Finally, the group has an FPC1000 Spectrum Analyzer of Rohde&Schwarz that goes from 5kHz to 3GHz. It may be used by several projects in the group to analyze RF emissions at different bands."
