Introduction\n\nThe increasing use of technologies, particularly computing and communication paradigms, has significantly influenced our daily lives. The integration of digital technologies into many aspects of our physical lives has generated a virtual dimension known as “cyberspace”. For example, the use of embedded sensors, electronic tags, smart phones, vehicles, and an array of daily-use items generates massive amounts of data. Much of this is linkable to the actions of individuals and, if aggregated, provides a profile of the individual.\n\nInterconnecting devices and networks provides convenient platforms for information exchange. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a well-known example. As the number of interconnected ’Things’ increases and computing environments improve, data monitoring and analysis becomes increasingly sophisticated. This trajectory toward a “hyper-connected world” [1] promises seamless interactions between the physical world and cyberspace, potentially enriching user experiences. Technological advances, for instance, now allow residents to see who is at their front door through a modern IoT-enabled doorbell, even when they are not at home. Additionally, they can remotely unlock the door, letting guests in.\n\nTechnological advancements have improved data-collection methodologies. Interconnected software and hardware facilitate pervasive user data collection; user activities can be continuously monitored in both digital and physical realms. For instance, in cyberspace, tools such as cookies and hyperlinked images enable data gathering, tracing user actions and revealing user preferences and online behaviours. This action may not be apparent to the user. Wearable gadgets such as smartwatches and fitness trackers capture a spectrum of data from health metrics to daily routines. Ubiquitous devices such as mobile phones capture and transmit real-world data including user location, which reveals patterns of user behaviour.\n\nThis new environment presents serious privacy challenges. The very items that facilitate connectivity simultaneously increase the risk of privacy breaches. The data gathered to provide services can also be used for monitoring and surveillance. For example, the video transmissions used to allow residents to see who is at the front door could potentially be viewed by others. As this reveals the identity and location of the visitor at a point in time, unauthorised access to this information is a privacy breach. Gathering such video data across time reveals patterns of attendance at this location. Collecting such data from multiple door bells permits mass surveillance. Sometimes, these data-gathering methods occur without explicit user consent, leading to unauthorised access to stored or transmitted data.\n\nWestin [2] explains “privacy is the claim of individuals, groups or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others”. Schoeman [3] explains privacy as “control we have over information about ourselves”.\n\nInformation privacy refers to the control of personal information. For systems containing private information, it is important to assess the risks associated with the collection, use, and disclosure of that information. Personal information refers to information which is directly linked to an identifiable individual.\n\nPervasive user data collection raises new privacy challenges. This paper aims to address the following research questions:\n\nHow do evolving technological paradigms impact privacy, considering both cyberspace and the physical realm?\n\nWhat are the challenges associated with privacy preservation associated with various data-collection scenarios, from web browsing activities to advanced participatory sensing in real-world environments? What are the risks to user privacy?\n\nWhat countermeasures can be employed to mitigate our identified privacy risks? How effective are existing privacy-protection mechanisms?\n\nTo address these three questions, this paper focuses on user privacy in three emerging scenarios.\n\n1.1. Privacy and User Activity in Cyberspace\n\nIn the realm of cyberspace, web browsing emerges as a significant activity that generates points that can be analysed to reveal information about the user, commonly referred to as “data exhaust”. These data, collected through technologies like cookies, browser fingerprinting, and flash objects, enable detailed user tracking. Employing advanced techniques such as machine learning and big data analytics, particularly within the advertising industry, these tools facilitate the reconstruction of individual browsing histories and behaviours (Figure 1).\n\nThis analysis is critical for advertisers to implement strategies like behavioural targeting, frequency capping, retargeting, and conversion tracking, leading to highly personalised advertising experiences [4,5,6]. Additionally, publishers leverage these data for content customisation, significantly boosting their revenues, with reports indicating up to a 52% increase due to third-party cookie usage [7].\n\nWhile these practices offer enhanced user experiences and economic benefits for publishers, they also bring forth significant privacy challenges. The core issue centres on the implicit nature of user consent in the data-collection process and the resultant lack of user control over their personal information.\n\n1.2. Privacy in Personal Cyber–Physical Systems\n\nThe burgeoning industry of smart devices and wearable gadgets, which collect and transmit private user data for advanced services, has brought forth significant privacy concerns. These devices, acting as personal data hubs, are at the forefront of collecting sensitive information such as activity, location, and health data, as illustrated in Figure 2. The repercussions of privacy breaches here extend beyond data loss to potentially include disinformation campaigns, behavioural manipulation, and financial exploitation. The emotional impact of feeling constantly monitored, or having intimate details exposed, can undermine public trust in technology.\n\nIn this context, user autonomy over personal data is crucial. The integration of smart devices into daily life mandates user control over data storage, sharing, and deletion. This requires transparent user interfaces and clear mechanisms for consent, ensuring users can make informed decisions about their data. Additionally, ensuring data security during storage and transmission, especially considering the heterogeneous nature of device capabilities, is a vital aspect of protecting user privacy in these systems.\n\n1.3. Privacy in Proactive User-Driven Data Collection\n\nIn the digital era, the unprecedented level of proactive data collection through connected devices like smartphones and IoT gadgets has highlighted significant privacy concerns. As depicted in Figure 3, data collected from the physical world are seamlessly integrated into cyberspace, contributing to a complex privacy landscape. This paradigm shift is epitomised by participatory sensing [8,9], where individuals use their devices as sensors to collect environmental data such as noise levels, traffic conditions, and temperature. This method of data collection, utilised by billions of smartphone users, offers immense benefits but also poses serious privacy concerns, especially around identity privacy.\n\nMoreover, the evolution of data collection has sparked interest in leveraging opportunistic networks. These networks, beneficial in both infrastructure-lacking and well-connected areas, can augment existing systems and provide localised communication. However, they introduce unique privacy challenges, particularly in terms of identity protection and data security. The balance between the convenience and innovation offered by these technologies and the need to safeguard personal privacy is a central theme in understanding and addressing the challenges of proactive user-driven data collection.\n\n1.4. Road-Map\n\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we discuss privacy concerns associated with user actions in cyberspace, and two featured scenarios of user activities in cyberspace are articulated: web privacy protection and user input disclosure. In Section 3, we investigate privacy concerns within the interactions of cyberspace and the physical world. We discuss scenarios regarding smart home devices and wearable gadgets. In Section 4, we explore user activities in the physical world involving pervasive computing where user privacy in participatory sensing and opportunistic networks raise user privacy concerns. Open issues are discussed in Section 5 considering privacy protection for complex applications. We conclude this paper in Section 6.\n\n2. Privacy Concerns Raised with User Cyberspace Activities\n\nWith the boundless interactions in cyberspace come potential risks, particularly concerning user privacy. As we delve deeper into user cyberspace activities, following the trend of data exhaust collection, several privacy attack vectors surface: data exhaust tracking, the use of tracking technologies, identity tracking from browsing exhaust, and user input data disclosure.\n\n2.1. Data Exhaust Tracing\n\nThe concept of data exhaust tracing involves the analysis of user-generated data during web browsing. These data include browsing habits, clicked links, and interactions with various web elements. When collated, these data can paint a detailed picture of a user’s online behaviour [4].\n\n2.2. Use of Tracking Technologies\n\nThe advertising industry, particularly through third-party domains connected with publishers’ websites, employs technologies like cookies, flash storage, and browser fingerprinting to track users [5,6]. These tools enable the identification and tracking of users across different websites, allowing for the compilation of data to reconstruct individual browsing histories.\n\n2.3. Identity Tracking from Browsing Exhaust\n\nIdentity tracking has emerged as a significant privacy issue, where third parties exploit browsing history, shopping behaviours, and purchase habits for targeted advertising [6]. This type of tracking often extends beyond the primary website to several other entities, leading to the creation of comprehensive user profiles.\n\n2.4. User Input Data Disclosure\n\nBeyond passive data collection, the recording and utilisation of user input data during web browsing poses additional privacy risks. These include the collection of personally identifiable information, potential for data leakage, and misuse of sensitive input data [10,11].\n\n2.5. Protections and Limitations\n\nVarious measures, such as DNS Filtering, Network Proxies, VPNs, and Incognito/Private Browsing Modes, are employed to combat these privacy risks. However, they face challenges, such as difficulties against encrypted transmissions and ineffectiveness against fingerprinting tracking [12,13,14,15]. Browser extensions have proven more effective, adept at differentiating between first-party content and third-party trackers.\n\nFor user input, traditional approaches like differential privacy introduce noise into collected data but face challenges in large-scale applications [16,17]. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers a viable alternative, allowing users to perturb their data inputs, thus providing plausible deniability.\n\nA significant limitation arises in the realm of unstructured user input, which includes free-form text, images, and videos shared or uploaded by users. Protecting the privacy of such data is challenging because it often contains nuanced and context-specific information that is difficult to anonymise without losing its inherent value or meaning [18]. Traditional privacy-preserving techniques like data masking or encryption may not be effective for unstructured data due to its variability and complexity. Furthermore, automated systems for processing unstructured data, such as natural language processing (NLP) tools, can inadvertently expose sensitive information if not designed with robust privacy safeguards.\n\n2.6. Countermeasures\n\nThe myriad activities in cyberspace, particularly web browsing, bring forth a range of privacy concerns. Understanding these risks and adopting comprehensive solutions, such as browser extensions and local differential privacy, can mitigate these challenges and ensure a safer, more private digital environment.\n\n2.6.1. Web Privacy Protection: Browser Extensions\n\nIn the digital landscape, browser extensions have risen as pivotal tools for bolstering online privacy. Beyond merely blocking ads, these tools shield users’ digital interactions from intrusive third-party tracking, fostering a more private browsing environment. In the following, we present our survey on several renowned browser extensions, with a summarised overview presented in Table 1.\n\nWe classify surveyed tracking protection extensions by their blocking techniques: list-based, algorithm-based, and machine-learning-based blocking. For extensions that are based on lists, a popular subcategory is crowd-sourced-list based. There are many famous and familiar names such as Ad-Blocker [19], AdBlock [20], Adblock Plus [21], and uBlock [22]. These extensions have drawn attention in the community since the early days of the battle against third-party ads. Consequently, a core blocking list EasyList has been contributed to and maintained by the community. At the time of writing, EasyList consists of over 17,000 third-party advertisers, 13,500 general third-party and specific URL patterns, as well as 31,000 advertisement element filters [23]. Extensions like Ad-Blocker use Easylist’s filter rules to prevent ads from loading, thereby limiting user tracking. In addition to EasyList, extensions based on rules also adopt other filter lists, including anticircumvention lists or third-party tracker filter lists. The anticircumvention lists help advertisement-blocking extensions fight against the detection and circumvention of the extensions and reinsertion of ads. The third-party tracker filter lists help against tracking from companies and organisations that do not directly insert advertisements.\n\nWhile crowd-sourced lists are community-driven, another approach is centralised maintenance, encompassing extensions like Ghostery [24], Disconnect [25], Blur [26], and AdGuard [27]. Owing to the centralised control, these extension companies set the blocking rules, and they typically have considerably fewer rules than crowd-sourced lists [12]. While these extensions enable rule customisation, they often define certain network requests as necessary third-party content and thus unblockable. Alongside their primary ad-blocking features, commercialised versions of these extensions offer added functionalities: Ghostery Insights [28] provides a time-lined analysis and loading performance details; Disconnect Premium [29] presents an optional VPN, full IP masking, and data encryption; Blur Premium [26] offers enhanced protection for personal information; and AdGuard Premium [30] incorporates advanced tracking and phishing protection, enhanced parental controls, and a VPN option. Regrettably, unlocking these premium features typically involves payment and occasionally granting permissions for data collection.\n\nIn addition to the conventional list-based blocking paradigm, the Firefox Multiaccount Containers extension introduces a user-curated containment strategy [31]. Instead of determining which content to block based on predefined or community-sourced lists, this extension gives users the autonomy to classify websites into isolated containers, such as ’Work’, ’Shopping’, and ’Social’. Each container encapsulates its associated browsing activity, ensuring that cookies, cache, and site data remain confined within its designated environment. By enabling this segregation, the extension effectively curtails the scope of third-party trackers, preventing them from correlating a user’s diverse online activities across different containers. While this method requires a more hands-on approach as users must manually assign websites to the desired containers, it offers a personalised and flexible strategy to counter pervasive online tracking, emphasising user control over data compartmentalisation.\n\nMoving beyond list-based ad-blockers, some extensions utilise algorithms to automatically decide whether a third-party’s content needs to be blocked. A popular example is an extension called Privacy Badger [32], which monitors third-party organisations, counting the number of websites they use for user tracking. If an organisation’s count reaches three, it blocks their content from loading. Additionally, Privacy Badger can detect canvas-based browser fingerprinting and block tracking from third-party domains [33]. In the realm of canvas-based browser fingerprinting, another noteworthy extension is CanvasBlocker [34]. It operates by either blocking or faking the readout of the HTML5 canvas element, a prime target for fingerprinting techniques aimed at uniquely identifying and tracking users. By doing so, CanvasBlocker effectively thwarts attempts by websites to exploit this method of tracking, adding an extra layer of privacy to user browsing sessions [34,35].\n\nA newly emerged ad-blocking tool adopts machine learning techniques based on a perceptual study from the ads’ loading content. Existing works [36,37,38] have introduced a new concept of perceptual ad-blocking, which seeks to improve resilience against ad obfuscation and minimise the manual effort needed to create ad-blockers. For traditional ad-blocking relying on crowd-sourced lists or ones based on centralised maintenance, two downsides have been identified: (1) the consistency of filter lists requires constant synchronisation with the latest versions and (2) different strategies have been developed for evading crowd-sourced lists (like EasyList) such as changing domains, moving resources to the publishers, removing ad keywords from URLs, and removing image dimensions from URLs. Thus, it became an arms race between ads and tracker-blocking tools and third-party domains. Researchers claim that the novel approach of using perceptual signals effectively reduces the arms race with web publishers and ad networks [39]. Storey et al. [36] based their perceptual ad-blocking on a legal requirement for the recognisable display of ads by humans. Based on the legal requirement, Storey et al.’s Ad-Highlighter [40] focuses on learning captured visual and behavioural information that can be used to distinguish ads, e.g., the text “Sponsored”, the ad’s circled “i” information icon, or an ad network logo. However, this method has its challenges, as the markup information can be rendered invisible. To overcome the challenge of this specific rendering, [38] introduced the project Sentinel, a machine learning version of Adblocker Plus that uses an object-detection neural network to locate ads in raw website page screenshots [41]. To further enhance rendered web pages, ref. [37] introduced a new technique to achieve the goal. In their work, a deep-learning-based ad-blocker module is embedded into Chromium’s rendering engine so that images of ads can be detected directly [37].\n\nBesides many experimental adoptions of machine learning for perceptual ad-blocking, ref. [42] showed a different way of using machine-learning-based classification to block ads. Iqbal et al. [42] introduced AdGraph, which applies machine learning approaches to graph representations built from web pages considering aspects such as the HTML structure, network requests, and JavaScript behaviour. When AdGraph’s modifications were applied to Chromium, the results showed higher accuracy and reduced computational overheads compared to traditional ad-blocking extensions.\n\nTable 1.

Local Differential Privacy\n\nLocal differential privacy (LDP) is a refinement of differential privacy, aimed at ensuring that the removal of an individual entry does not significantly alter the overall data distribution [16,43]. Distinctive for its noise perturbation at the user end, LDP has been applied in notable projects like Google’s RAPPOR [44] and Apple’s Learning with Privacy [45].\n\nLDP’s core is based on the Random Response principle [46], ensuring a probability that collected data reflect the true value. This principle has been adapted for various applications by major tech companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft, spanning areas like longitudinal collections and itemsets mining.\n\nGoogle’s RAPPOR uses unary encoding with a permanent randomised response, integrating Bloom filters for efficient encoding in large-domain surveys [44,47]. This has led to advances in frequency estimation and heavy hitter identification under LDP [48,49,50]. Apple, meanwhile, employs discrete Fourier Transformation and sketching algorithms for noise addition and domain dimensionality reduction, demonstrating centralised differential privacy applications within an LDP framework [51,52].\n\nMicrosoft has further expanded LDP’s scope to include telemetry collection [53], graph data analysis [54], language data analysis [55], iterative interactions [56], and incorporating prior knowledge [57]. These developments illustrate the evolving landscape of LDP, addressing the intricacies of various data types and privacy concerns.\n\nAdditionally, Federated Learning exemplifies the integration of LDP principles with decentralised data processing, emphasising privacy in training directly on source data, such as user devices. This approach is complemented by ongoing research in optimising noise injection in LDP to balance data utility and privacy [58,59,60].\n\nThe realm of LDP is also making strides in handling time-series data, a growing concern due to the rise of IoT devices and financial analyses. This type of data, characterised by its sequential nature, poses unique challenges in privacy protection. Techniques like adaptive noise strategies and the sliding window approach are being explored to address these challenges, providing flexibility in data collection granularity and enabling varied privacy tiers based on data sensitivity [61].\n\nIn recent developments, the application of LDP to unstructured user inputs like voiceprints, face graphs, and sensitive texts presents new challenges. These include the complexity of data types, maintaining data utility post-transformation, and ensuring computational feasibility on personal devices. Adaptations of current DP works to LDP models are underway, focusing on the localised processing of sensitive data while maintaining its semantic integrity and functional utility. This expansion of LDP into diverse domains of unstructured data marks a significant progression in the field, addressing the increasing demand for robust privacy solutions in our digital age.\n\nVoice data, known for their variability, pose unique challenges in LDP implementation, especially in preserving essential characteristics for applications like voice recognition. Han et al. extend differential privacy to voiceprints, introducing a metric privacy model that accounts for the similarity between voiceprints [62]. Adapting this approach to LDP entails developing localised voiceprint sanitisation methods. These methods should perturb voice data at the source, balancing the privacy–utility trade-off and ensuring computational efficiency for feasible implementation on standard user devices. The goal is to protect voiceprint privacy while maintaining the utility for voice recognition and other voice-based applications.\n\nThe complexity and sensitivity of facial images require intricate processing to maintain privacy while preserving utility in applications like facial recognition. Jia-Wei Chen et al. provide a framework for facial image obfuscation based on perceptual indistinguishability [63]. Similarly, Liyue Fan proposed methods for pixelizing images to protect identifiable features [64]. For adapting these approaches to an LDP model, efficient, local obfuscation techniques are needed. This involves customising algorithms for on-device processing, ensuring facial data are privatised before leaving the user’s device and maintaining the balance between privacy protection and the utility of the obfuscated images.\n\nSensitive text data present complex challenges for LDP. Maintaining the semantic and contextual relevance of text after privacy transformations is a key difficulty. Current DP works, such as Natasha Fernandes et al.’s work [65], focus on text obfuscation by using ’bags-of-words’ models. This approach aims to obscure authorship clues while preserving content. Feyisetan et al. demonstrate advanced text perturbation methods to balance privacy and analytical utility [66]. The potential development for LDP in this domain involves adapting these methodologies for local implementation on user devices. This adaptation would ensure privacy from the initial data-generation stage, possibly through the use of lightweight, efficient algorithms suitable for real-time processing on personal devices.\n\n2.7. Discussion\n\nWe surveyed protections on browsing exhaust and user-response disclosure for data collection at the traditional border between the physical world and cyberspace. For browsing exhaust protection, there is an ongoing arms race between web browser extensions and exhaust-tracking techniques. Core concepts for the developing browser extensions have evolved from elementary rule-based filters to perceptual blocking involving machine learning technologies, where further research can be focused. For private user-response disclosure, LDP has shown its promising applications from Google and Apple’s implementation. Despite the current research streams on LDP data utilisation, the realisation of LDP on special survey domains and approaches requires more research.\n\n3. Privacy Concerns in Personal Cyber–Physical Systems\n\nRecent incidents, such as the unintentional revelation of secret military bases by a fitness tracking app in 2018 [67] and a substantial data breach at a smart toy manufacturer in 2015 [68], have brought to light significant privacy concerns within personal cyber–physical systems. These events highlight the criticality of addressing two primary privacy concerns, which also represent key attack vectors: unauthorised data access in smart devices and vulnerabilities in the secure transmission of data.\n\n3.1. Unauthorised Data Access in Smart Devices\n\nSmart devices and wearable gadgets, which play a pivotal role in health monitoring, are increasingly vulnerable to unauthorised data access. These devices, diverse in their computing and communication capabilities, are prime targets for cyberattacks. The most prevalent attack vectors involve exploiting software vulnerabilities through sophisticated hacking methods and gaining unauthorised access via deceptive phishing attacks. The data at stake, encompassing sensitive health records and precise location information, are at risk of being misused, resulting in substantial privacy violations.\n\n3.2. Vulnerabilities in Data Transmission\n\nA significant concern in the realm of personal cyber–physical systems, especially in healthcare, is the secure transmission of sensitive patient data, including medical histories and physiological metrics. This data transmission necessitates robust encryption to ensure privacy and maintain data integrity. Nevertheless, the challenge arises with healthcare devices constrained by limited resources, where traditional encryption methods like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encounter operational difficulties. These limitations make the devices susceptible to sophisticated cyber threats, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, during the data-transmission process.\n\n3.3. Protections and Limitations\n\nTo address privacy concerns in personal cyber–physical systems, several protective measures have been developed, though they come with inherent limitations.\n\nRigorous data-access controls are implemented to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive data on smart devices. However, these controls often falter when users inadvertently grant permissions to third-party applications, leading to potential security loopholes. Developing user-friendly yet secure access-control mechanisms remains a critical challenge.\n\nIn terms of data transmission, AES is a widely adopted method in well-resourced devices [69]. However, AES is less feasible for resource-limited healthcare devices due to its high computational demand. As a result, there is an increasing need for adaptable encryption solutions that balance security with the operational capabilities of these devices.\n\nThe overarching challenge is striking a balance between efficiency and security. While lightweight encryption techniques offer promise, there is still a pressing need for innovations in encryption technology that can provide robust security without compromising the operational efficiency of various devices in these systems.\n\n3.4. Countermeasures\n\nWith rising privacy concerns as many devices become connected and transform into personal physical cyber systems, several countermeasures have been developed to protect users. In our survey, we focus on the emerging technology of access-control enforcement for wearable equipment and lightweight encryption in healthcare devices.\n\n3.4.1. Access-Control Enforcement for the Wearable Equipment\n\nThe technology of access-control enforcement plays a core protection role in many IoT network systems since it directly answers the privacy issue of accessibility mentioned above. It applies a range of selective policies, setting the criteria of who can access the data. The main purpose of an access-control-enforcement mechanism is to block unauthorised and random queries towards a protected data repository. Besides the passive protection, rather than blocking arbitrary connections, it sets up a bottom line against insider attacks or general platform sharing with an efficient privilege update and revocation mechanism. Access-control mechanisms for IoT systems have drawn much research attention, and several works have been proposed as effective and practical solutions for wearable technology in different scenarios. Since access-control enforcement has a wide research scope, in the following section we survey a few typical works and focus on wearable gadgets and connected healthcare devices.\n\nOne research focus required for wearable gadgets is to develop context-aware access control with a more expressive policy. In 2010, Garcia-Morchon and Wehrle [70] proposed a modular context-aware access-control mechanism that allows a system administrator to compose each module with a well-defined goal so that access policies for different required functionalities can be assigned to different modules. Ray et al. [71] tried to improve the expressiveness by using attribute-based access control from the NIST NGAC framework and achieved the first conceptual prototype for an IoT infrastructure. Later in the same year, Salama et al. [72] successfully combined public key infrastructure and attribute-based access control for a multilevel access control on patient healthcare monitoring.\n\nAnother research focus for wearable gadgets and connected healthcare devices is usability. This feature is neglected by most of the existing access-control works since an administrative model is generally assumed for access-control scenarios. However, especially for wearable gadgets, there is no administrative staff for these private devices, and the users are the ones who configure, manage, and protect the devices and resources. Thus, for the users who often lack the necessary security knowledge, an easy-to-use interface and enhanced presentation need to be provided for policy configuration [73]. In 2011, Kim et al. [74] proposed the first access-control mechanism that provides a full solution to usability. Their newly introduced automated Clairvoyant access right assignment mechanism can suggest suitable access-control policies. Unfortunately, their work is designed for smart home scenarios where its inherent overprivilege property can be tolerated [73]. To address this issue of overprivilege, Tian et al. [75] proposed an automated access policy generation based on checking the functionality and behaviour of the entity that asks for access. Their access-control mechanism was oriented towards smartphone applications accessing local resources, which can be extended to other IoT systems like accessing data in wearable gadgets. After an appropriate access policy is generated, it is then provided to the user for review.\n\nOther research focuses include distributed environments [76,77], dynamic access control [78], scalability [79], and multilateral security [80]. These works will be compared with aforementioned works with other focuses in Table 2.\n\n3.4.2. Lightweight Encryption in Healthcare Devices\n\nLightweight symmetric encryption can provide encryption requirements from connected healthcare devices, especially implantable medical devices like pacemakers where other protections are difficult to implement. Connected healthcare devices are usually computationally weak and restrained by battery life, and implantable medical devices often are additionally restricted with a minimal physical size that leads to implementation constraints in hardware [81,82,83].\n\nWith these limitations, some features/properties in lightweight encryption become rather more acceptable and welcome. These features include implementation flexibility, a smaller block size, encryption rounds saving, and restricted versatility.\n\nImplementation Flexibility—For the implementation of encryption on resource-restrained devices, the trade-off is only determined when applied to a specific scenario [84]. Thus, when a feature is specifically needed for a deployment scenario, the encryption algorithm should be optimised with acceptable sacrifice to other aspects.\n\nLower Size—For healthcare devices that have a small physical size and need to run for an extended period with limited battery, the design of an encryption algorithm may need to prioritise resource limitations. In this case, a smaller block size or internal state becomes acceptable.\n\nLess Rounds—For healthcare devices, a particular nature is that its total amount of output messages is considered relatively fewer. For example, a pacemaker working for ten years outputs less than 2 30 pairs of plaintext and ciphertext, which may lead to the relaxation of the total number of primitive rounds while retaining approximately the same security level [85].\n\nLimited Versatility—The healthcare device where the encryption algorithm is to be implemented is usually function- and operation-focused, which makes encryption algorithms that have limited versatility rather welcome.\n\nConsidering the above implementation difficulties, security requirements, and feature preferences, our survey on lightweight symmetric encryption focuses on the algorithms that have a small block size or internal state and can manage short keys. Most of the candidate algorithms lie in block ciphers and stream ciphers due to the restrained resource. For hash function-based algorithms, only PHOTON [86] and Spongent [87] have ideally a small internal state size. A summary of the surveyed algorithms is shown in Table 3.\n\nWhile lightweight encryption offers optimised solutions tailored for resource-constrained devices, it is pivotal to be cognisant of potential trade-offs. Balancing efficiency with robust security is a delicate act. In some instances, the efficiency of lightweight encryption might come at the cost of reduced security when compared to their heavyweight counterparts. Such trade-offs necessitate meticulous evaluation, especially when patient health and data are at stake.\n\n3.5. Discussion\n\nFor private data stored in many smart devices including wearable equipment that builds a personal data hub, we explored how the data collected by these devices can be accessed and the challenges associated with transmitting sensitive data from resource-constrained devices. Existing access-control approaches help with the general purpose of controlling accessibility. However, most research works have not considered the usability that presents an essential requirement for personal scenarios. Another field in access control for future research is how to delicately assign accessibility according to the sensitivity of the collected data. An example would be that location information in residential areas, compared to public places, should be considered highly private and not suitable to be accessed by most applications. In terms of protection during transmission, lightweight encryption has shown practical promise in many IoT devices. For healthcare devices, which could benefit from the seamless 5G network in the near future, characterised lightweight encryption schemes are expected to fit the challenging privacy scenarios.\n\n4. Privacy Concerns during User-Driven Data Collection\n\nWith the rise of user-driven data collection through connected devices and participatory sensing platforms, privacy risks have become increasingly prevalent. This section delves into the specific attack vectors in these scenarios, focusing on the inadvertent leakage of personal information and the vulnerabilities in decentralised networks, particularly opportunistic networks (OppNets).\n\nAs participatory sensing becomes more integrated into our daily lives through the proliferation of smart devices, users frequently encounter decentralised network structures, including OppNets. This trend of leveraging sensors in devices for data collection exposes users to notable privacy risks. Often, media containing sensitive information like location, time, and identity is uploaded unknowingly by users, leading to inadvertent data exposure [99].\n\nOppNets, serving as a common alternative to traditional network infrastructures, are increasingly relevant in a variety of contexts, not just in remote or poorly connected areas. These networks are characterised by their decentralised and dynamic nature, which presents unique privacy challenges. Understanding these challenges is essential for addressing the specific attack vectors that arise within these networks, which are becoming more commonplace as participatory sensing grows.\n\n4.1. Inadvertent Data Leakage\n\nA major attack vector in user-driven data collection is the inadvertent leakage of personal information. Users often share media files embedded with sensitive data such as geolocation and timestamps without realising the potential privacy implications. This type of accidental exposure underlines the need for increased awareness and more stringent control over data-sharing practices in the era of widespread participatory sensing.\n\n4.2. Residual Data Traces\n\nResidual data traces in digital content pose another significant privacy concern. Attempts to remove personal data from uploads often leave behind remnants vulnerable to exploitation. Addressing this risk requires effective data-sanitation methods capable of thoroughly eliminating personal traces and protecting user privacy in the digital space.\n\n4.3. Collector Vulnerability\n\nIn the realm of participatory sensing, the entities collecting data—whether individuals or applications—face distinct vulnerabilities. As aggregators of sensitive user information, these collectors can become targets for cyberattacks. Ensuring their security is crucial and necessitates robust protective measures for both the data and the collectors.\n\n4.4. OppNets Network Node Vulnerability\n\nThe decentralised structure of OppNets inherently makes intermediate nodes susceptible to compromise or malicious activities. These nodes, critical for ensuring seamless data transmission in the absence of stable, centralised networks, can become potential targets for various cyber threats. Security breaches in these nodes, ranging from data interception to unauthorised access, can have far-reaching consequences, jeopardising the safety and privacy of transmitted information. The studies by Kumar et al. [100], Tsai et al. [101], and Irshad et al. [102] highlight the vulnerabilities and potential security breaches that can occur in these scenarios.\n\nOppNets Network Authentication Risks\n\nThe decentralised framework of OppNets introduces complexities in authentication processes, representing significant privacy risks. Ensuring the secure transmission of sensitive personal information in OppNets requires robust, adaptable authentication mechanisms [103,104]. Developing these mechanisms is essential for safeguarding data against unauthorised access and maintaining the integrity of information within these versatile networks.\n\n4.5. Countermeasures\n\nAddressing privacy concerns in user-driven data collection, particularly in participatory sensing and OppNets, involves diverse countermeasures including access control, advanced encryption, location privacy protection, and robust authentication. While the ample computational power of modern smartphones enables the use of sophisticated encryption methods without significant limitations, our research primarily focuses on enhancing location privacy in participatory sensing and ensuring anonymous authentication within OppNets. This targeted approach allows us to concentrate on specific challenges and vulnerabilities inherent in these systems, such as protecting sensitive location data and securing decentralised network interactions, which are crucial in the dynamics of pervasive user data collection.\n\n4.5.1. Location Privacy in Participatory Sensing\n\nThe issue of location privacy sits at the forefront of concerns in participatory sensing. The very act of sharing location details within the sensing communication network or with third-party entities can jeopardise an individual’s privacy. However, the dichotomy arises when considering the utility of location data. Low-quality or imprecise location data could diminish the overall value of participatory sensing. Consequently, there is an ongoing struggle to strike a balance between preserving location quality and ensuring location privacy, a topic of much interest to researchers. Over the years, various methodologies have been explored to address this challenge. The most impact among these can be distilled into three primary techniques:\n\nDummy locations—Initially introduced by Kido et al. [105], the concept of dummy locations involves sending queries with the user’s actual location and several fake locations. This technique effectively confounds service providers, making it difficult to pinpoint the user’s true location. Further advancements in this area include the work of Liu et al. [106], who developed a spatiotemporal correlation-aware dummy-based privacy-protection scheme, and Hara et al. [107], who focused on dummy-based user location unionisation under real-world constraints. These developments enhance the method’s effectiveness, particularly in scenarios where individual location information is crucial.\n\nObfuscation—Duckham and Kulik’s novel approach [108] involves negotiating the degradation of location information. This technique allows for a tailored balance between privacy protection and service quality. Through negotiation algorithms, users can dynamically adjust the level of obfuscation applied to their location data, ensuring adequate privacy while maintaining the efficacy of the service. The method has evolved to include various forms of perturbation [109] and generalisation [110], making it adaptable to a wide range of participatory sensing applications.\n\nk-anonymity—Stemming from the foundational concept of k-anonymity [111], Gruteser and Grunwald [112] developed a method that conceals a user’s location within a group of k − 1 other users. This approach has been further refined in studies like Niu et al. [113], offering enhanced anonymity in privacy-aware location-based services. While effective in specific scenarios, it is less robust for continuous location tracking and can suffer from reduced accuracy [114], potentially affecting service reliability.\n\n4.5.2. Anonymous Authentication for OppNets\n\nIn OppNets, ensuring both authentication and anonymity is crucial. While authentication validates nodes and secures the network, anonymity protects users’ identities, a critical aspect in today’s privacy-conscious digital landscape.\n\nThe authentication procedure in OppNets serves a dual purpose: verifying a node’s credentials and shielding the network from unauthorised intrusion. It also maintains the integrity of the packets received by nodes. The absence of direct paths between distant nodes in OppNets intensifies the challenge of constructing efficient authentication algorithms. Add to this the pursuit of preserving anonymity in these dynamic settings and we are faced with an intricate problem. A few novel algorithms that have navigated this complex maze are discussed in the literature and encapsulated in Table 4.\n\nCarver and Lin’s 2012 proposition represents one of the earlier forays into this domain. They advocated an authentication scheme for OppNets that capitalised on group-oriented broadcast encryption, deeply rooted in pairing [115,116] and identity-based signatures. Optimised for Bluetooth and 3G communications [117], their methodology ensured packet forwarding without necessitating recipient knowledge, thereby preserving user privacy to an extent. However, this method unveiled the sender’s details after authentication. An inherent limitation was the dependency on a trusted third-party entity for key generation and group taxonomy, a potential Achilles’ heel if this third party were ever compromised [118].\n\nExploring complete user privacy, Guo et al.’s 2015 framework set a new benchmark [119]. Designed for constrained wireless network environments with short-lived connectivity, their strategy assigned a super node for node registration. Their security approach blended both symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques, buttressed by the use of hash functions to cloak user identities. Kumar et al. in 2017 built upon this foundation, emphasizing dynamic user identities for key exchanges and integrating RSA encryption to safeguard data during transmission.\n\nTaking a divergence from conventional encryption methodologies, Kuo et al. charted fresh waters with their authentication scheme, deeply entrenched in hash functions and point operations [120]. Though not originally crafted for OppNets, its roaming authentication capability indicated potential compatibility, promising enhanced performance and bolstered security.\n\nTable 4. Comparison among anonymous authentication for OppNets.\n\nRef.TechniqueFeature[117]Broadcast encryptionPartial privacy[119]Symmetric and asymmetric encryptionHashed user ID[100]RSA encryptionDynamic user ID[120]Hash functionalityEncryption freePoint operation\n\n4.6. Discussion\n\nThe existence of users and data generated by users raise concerns about protecting user privacy during active data-collecting activities. From these concerns, we survey the problems of location privacy in participatory sensing and anonymous authentication in OppNets. To protect a participant’s location data, a compromise in the quality of the location data is usually the trade-off, although many efforts have been made to mitigate the effect. Concerning identity privacy in OppNets, existing solutions heavily rely on encryption techniques, which can be expensive considering heterogeneous devices. Encryption-free anonymous authentication requires more research as it potentially has more application scenarios.\n\n5. Future Vision on Complex Privacy Problems\n\nThere are many complex privacy problems already identified that soon could have a considerable impact on industry as well as our daily lives. We deliver our future vision on three of these privacy concerns, i.e., trajectory privacy, privacy in smart metering, and involuntary information leakage with ambient intelligence.\n\n5.1. Trajectory Privacy\n\nWhen we apply the traditional scenario of cookie privacy concerns to mobile applications, users’ trajectories become at risk due to location information embedded in cookie logs. Cookie logs in cyberspace may contain high-quality user location information, which can be collected directly by using GPS coordinates with a user’s fast consent to an unexplained location service permission requirement or indirectly collected with location tags from a local network or service provider in the physical world. This potential privacy breach should be categorised to a more dangerous level than web browsing history or personal preference logs. More detailed physical activities, routine habits, or even mental status can be inferred by analytical work on user trajectories. The infamous Uber travel history leakage lawsuit in 2017 [121] is a relevant example. Ref. [122] developed a privacy analysis system on user login records and physical context information and deepened the understanding of user physical-world privacy leakage via cyberspace privacy leakage. It becomes clear that user trajectories can be discovered and confirmed when third parties analyse their cookie logs as users move and browse in their daily lives let alone potential exogenous records of GPS coordinates. These cookie logs may further be exchanged with other analytics companies for centralised analysis connecting with other web activities, exposing the private physical trajectory to more entities. Compared with other private data, physical trajectory is more effective for reidentification by auditing relevant activity logs at locations and comparing differential timelines. The balance between utility and privacy with location data has drawn much research attention. However, for this physical-world trajectory leakage via user cyberspace data, further research efforts are required.\n\n5.2. Privacy in Smart Metering\n\nAs part of the pervasive data collection in cyberspace, smart metering in smart energy supply networks represents a critical evolution in data interaction between consumers and service providers. This evolution aligns with the broader theme of our paper, which examines how technological advancements in data collection impact user privacy [123].\n\nFor smart energy supply, smart metering collects detailed consumption data and helps evaluate the status of a smart energy grid for more efficient resource distribution. This data transmission, often in plaintext, raises significant privacy concerns, especially when linked with the personal activities of consumers [124,125,126].\n\nConsumption data, inherently tied to the private activities of consumers, form the core of sensitive information valuable to service providers [127]. Alongside these data, location tags and physical address information significantly contribute to the risk profile. While location tags provide a dynamic geospatial context, physical addresses link the consumption data directly to a fixed, real-world location. This amalgamation of consumption patterns, location’s context, and identifiable addresses creates a substantial attack surface, attracting the attention of potential adversaries.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, the application of cryptography is vital. By employing advanced cryptographic techniques, the sensitive attributes of the data—including consumption patterns, location tags, and physical addresses—can be securely encrypted. This ensures that even if data are intercepted or accessed by unauthorised entities, the critical components remain unintelligible and protected. Moreover, cryptographic solutions can be tailored to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of this information, both during transmission and storage, thereby significantly reducing the attractiveness of the data to potential attackers and minimising the risks associated with data breaches.\n\nHowever, a key obstacle is the limited resources that the smart meters have to perform strong cryptography [127]. Therefore, it remains a challenge for future research focusing on cryptography-based mechanisms that must provide confidentiality while minimising resource consumption.\n\n5.3. Privacy Challenges in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks\n\nThe evolution of transportation systems, driven by the integration of vehicles and infrastructure, has given rise to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) [128]. VANETs represent another aspect of the pervasive data-collection paradigm discussed in this paper. The integration of these networks in transportation systems, especially in autonomous vehicles, brings forth unique privacy and cybersecurity challenges.\n\nOne of the primary vulnerabilities in VANETs is the potential for data breaches. In autonomous vehicles, vast amounts of data are collected and transmitted, including sensitive personal information such as location, travel patterns, and in some cases, user identity [129]. The interception of these data by unauthorized entities can lead to privacy violations and identity theft. Additionally, the high mobility of vehicles complicates the network’s security, making it challenging to establish stable and secure communication channels.\n\nIn response to these challenges, VANETs require robust authentication protocols to ensure that only legitimate vehicles and infrastructure components participate in the network [130]. Advanced cryptographic techniques and secure communication protocols are essential to protect data transmission from eavesdropping and tampering. The scalability of these security measures is crucial due to the high number of vehicles and the dynamic nature of VANETs [131,132].\n\nAnonymity in VANETs is another critical countermeasure to safeguard user privacy. While ensuring the authenticity of messages and the reliability of data sources, it is vital to anonymize data to prevent the tracking and profiling of individual vehicles or drivers [133,134]. Techniques like pseudonymization, where vehicles periodically change their identifiers to prevent long-term tracking, are employed to strike a balance between security and privacy [135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142].\n\nMoreover, data-minimisation strategies are essential in autonomous vehicles to collect only the data necessary for the intended purpose, reducing the volume of sensitive information that could be compromised.\n\nAs we envision a future marked by interconnected vehicular systems, understanding and mitigating these cybersecurity vulnerabilities becomes paramount. Dedicated research and the development of innovative solutions are required to address these intricate privacy issues effectively, ensuring that VANETs can realise their transformative potential for the transportation sector in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.\n\n5.4. Involuntary Privacy Leakage with Ambient Intelligence\n\nAmbient intelligence renders environments more perceptive to users. Sensors detect environmental state changes, which accelerates computing services tailored to user needs [143]. As smart devices become integral in daily routines, a mobile ambient intelligence ecosystem, replete with diverse functionalities, gradually emerges. The enhanced user experiences from smartphones and wearable gadgets have led users to permit data collection. However, this inadvertently paves the way for potential private information leaks.\n\nThese devices, connected to the internet, bridge the real world and cyberspace, rendering them susceptible to threats from both domains. An instance of cyber threat is outlined in [144], detailing smartwatches unintentionally revealing users’ real-time location data. Such vulnerabilities, as Manuel puts it, are “pretty common”. Though software-centric cyberattacks can be rectified promptly, breaches might still happen due to subpar testing, even with robust security mechanisms [144].\n\nOn the other end, threats emanating from the physical realm can be either inadvertent or deliberate. An inadvertent breach could be an unknown individual’s image being unintentionally captured and uploaded on social media. While the uploader remains unaware of the individual’s identity, sophisticated algorithms might recognize them, revealing when and where the image was captured.\n\nThe onset of advanced smartphone capabilities has amplified our ability to chronicle every intricate detail of daily life. Consequently, the destiny of information about those inadvertently captured is vested in the hands of device users. The digital doorbell serves as another poignant example in this context. With an increasing number of households installing them, these devices constantly monitor front-door activities, often recording passersby or neighbours without their consent. Such recordings might get stored, shared, or even analysed without the knowledge of those captured.\n\nIn the face of these challenges, it becomes imperative for smart devices to evolve in their capacity to discern environments and adopt suitable privacy measures while also equipping users with the awareness and tools to navigate their surroundings with due diligence.\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nEmerging technologies continually change the ways user data are gathered and processed, and the scale at which this can be performed. This presents an evolving challenge to user privacy. In this paper, we explored multifaceted privacy concerns arising from the integration of cyberspace and the physical world.\n\nFrom our examination, we identify three central themes: data exhaust tracing, personal data hub, and active data collection. These categories aptly represent the diverse privacy challenges currently prevalent. Within these, we further detailed six primary concerns, from identity tracking in browsing exhaust to data-transmission security and privacy implications in opportunistic networks. We situated these concerns in practical application scenarios, elucidating their distinct characteristics and their departures from traditionally understood problems.\n\nIn addition to highlighting these concerns, we assessed existing technological countermeasures. Through a comparative analysis, we identified both the strengths and weaknesses of current solutions, thereby pinpointing existing research gaps and potential obstacles to their practical implementation.\n\nMoreover, the evolving technological landscape brings forth complex privacy challenges. We extend our analysis to the realms of user trajectories, smart metering, and ambient intelligence. These scenarios, encompassing elements from various domains, underline the growing intricacy of privacy-related challenges.\n\nTo conclude, as the boundary between the digital and physical blurs further, the imperative for robust privacy safeguards amplifies. While we have delineated possible research avenues and directions in this survey, the overarching takeaway remains: the quest for privacy in a hyperconnected era is dynamic, demanding constant vigilance, innovation, and adaptation.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nY.J. is the main author of the current paper.
