        "text": "I remember being in a comic book shop with him once, and I picked up some indie Daniel Clowes-like graphic novel…it may have even been a Daniel Clowes book. I recommended it to him, and he just said, “Dude, if it doesn’t involve someone flying around with a cape and punching people…I’m just not interested.” That’s Seth in a nutshell. He likes what he likes and he makes no bones about it.\n\nI remember that when it came to filming our scenes together in Superbad, everything felt kind of loose. I mean, for someone who had co-written the script and lived with this story for a long time, he wasn’t the least bit precious about it. If anything, he kept trying to encourage me to do more out-there shit. The whole thing I did where I was talking about meeting my wife in the bar, it was something I just improvised…I did it in one take and I thought, “Oh, I don’t think this is going to work.” And Seth was like, “Hey, great, you sounded like you were just having fun there. Let’s go with that. Do that again.” He didn’t care that it was a little weird. He just wanted to make sure it wasn’t going to contradict something later.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nOn the other hand, when something really wasn’t working, he wasn’t shy about speaking up. There was one point where some kid spits on me at a house party and I hit him with my baton. The other actors kept suggesting that I say some sort of line after he falls — and one person pitched something that revolves around a certain derogatory term. It was right at the point where it was really not cool to use that word any more…maybe it was OK on the playground once upon a time, but certainly not any more. I certainly felt uncomfortable saying it. And though some of the other folks laughed, Seth just shut it down immediately: “No, no, we’re not using that. Nope. Nuh-uh.” Then he quickly suggested another joke right over that off the top of his head, and that one worked! He knew what to come up with. He also knew it wasn’t cool and that the audience would not react well to it, so funny or not, the line wasn’t going in. Period.\n\nYou tend to have two types of people who work in movie comedy. You have the comedians who always need to be the smartest person in the film, who has to be the alpha and have everything revolve around them. You won’t get a good line, because it may make them seem less funny. And then you get the kind of person who wants everyone around them to be funnier — and that’s Seth. Watch This Is the End: He’s hilarious in it, but that’s a movie where everybody shines. He subscribes to the idea that if you’re good, it’ll make him seem better instead of worse. And it’s also the type of Hollywood movie where it could have been elitist and smug — “Hey, look at me and my famous friends” — and totally isn’t. It’s an inclusive movie; you kind of wish you were trapped in that house with them, even though those guys would be completely fucking useless during the apocalypse!"
