        "text": "With so many films in different genres under his belt, Jonah Hill has become one of the most successful actors and is one of the list of the elite actors who are not exclusive to one genre of films. Some of his most popular films are Moneyball, Knocked Up, 21 Jump Street, Superbad, and many more. He is synonymous with a good laugh, and his performance in the 2007 teen comedy film, Superbad exemplifies his comedy skills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Jonah Hill was outstanding in the film, he was fuming at Christopher Mintz-Plasse so much that he complained to Judd Apatow, the producer of the movie to get his co-star fired from the role. However, he did not fire Mintz-Plasse for an intriguing reason which made the film stand out.\n\nAlso Read: “Nothing is original anymore”: Stranger Things Fans May Not be Happy to Find Out the Truth Behind Some of It’s Iconic Scenes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah Hill Despised Working With Christopher Mintz-Plasse in Superbad\n\nSuperbad was not Jonah Hill’s first role in a major film, but he killed it as he portrayed the role of Seth in an authentic and layered manner. He was rude, vulgar, and a pervert, all those qualities that some teenagers think are cool, and to some extent he could hide his insecurities. Naturally, the viewers of the film loved Hill in the role, but there was another actor who was equally loved and it was none other than Christopher Mintz-Plasse in the role of McLovin.\n\nThough The Wolf of Wall Street actor appreciates the Kick-Ass actor, he did not like it when his co-star was making fun of him. During an exclusive interview with Vanity Fair, Hill, Mintz-Plasse, Rogen, and Apatow were present and the producer stated that the 34-year-old actor was being “very caustic” and he had insulted Hill on numerous occasions. Seth Rogen added that the Moneyball actor hated him and how could not perform with him.\n\n“That was f**king with my rhythm. I couldn’t perform with that guy.’” Judd Apatow added Hill told them, “I don’t want him doing it.”\n\nHowever, Judd Apatow gave an interesting reply to the actor, as he had hired Christopher Mintz-Plasse in the role of McLovin, as he had hired the actor because he gets on the actor’s nerves better than anybody else could do in the entire cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“‘That’s exactly why we’re hiring him. It couldn’t be more perfect. The fact that it bothers you is exactly what we want’.”\n\nNevertheless, Jonah Hill appreciated his co-star, stating that he was amazing from the beginning, and he did a great job in getting on his nerves while making the film.\n\n“Chris was really, really amazing off the bat. And I think he was really annoying to me at that time.”\n\nBoth actors did a fantastic job in playing their characters in the film, and it was their chemistry that became a key highlight of the film. As a result, the movie has survived the test of time, where fans often return from time to time to have a great laugh.\n\nAlso Read: “Who doesn’t love a good paycheck”: Fans Slam Robert Downey Jr. for Reportedly Agreeing to MCU Return\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah Hill Used Alcohol To Kiss Emma Stone in Superbad\n\nDuring an exclusive interview with Britain’s FHM via Contact Music, he explained that he wanted to make the scene much more realistic, so he drank a bottle of vodka and ended up headbutting her. Hence, in an attempt to make the scene more realistic, his execution was not right.\n\n“I hate watching films where someone’s supposed to be drunk and you can tell that they’re not. In Superbad I was really concerned about the scene where I had to kiss Emma Stone and end up headbutting her. I wanted it to feel real, so I got a bottle of vodka and just starting hammering it.”\n\nWhile he ended up headbutting her in the film, his romantic chemistry was equally amazing, making him a great pair with Stone.\n\nAlso Read: “It’s a big maybe”: Ryan Reynolds’ Free Guy Gets an Optimistic Sequel Update From Deadpool 3 Director\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuperbad can be streamed on DIRECTV."
