        "text": "Plot: Having thought that monogamy was never possible, a commitment-phobic career woman may have to face her fears when she meets a good guy.\n\nSo let’s start this off by me saying that Trainwreck is not what the hype suggests. I’m pretty sure it went straight to DVD in SA, but I saw a bunch of people liking it and thought it was worth the try. It really isn’t a bad film, but it is funny almost by accident. For the life of me I cannot understand the hype around Amy Schumer. For a comedian she could be worse but as an actress she is downright terrible. I don’t get why people are saying that this movie is “So Real”. The movie is really about a terrible woman who needs to grow up. Movie Amy is mean spirited and cold to everyone. The movie is inappropriate, racist, homophobic and not really funny about it.\n\nI do think that Bill Hader is the best thing about Trainwreck. Can we please see him in more movies? I would really love that. His character seems so genuine and just a normal and successful guy, worthy of love but terrible at choosing partners.\n\nThe movie has all these characters that are either terrible stereotypes or underdeveloped – Tilda Swinton is underutilized, that best friend girl of Amy is just there to be annoying and how did LeBron James find himself in a movie? I really have no idea.\n\nTrainwreck isn’t all that bad though. There are some scenes where I genuinely did laugh, even if it was in a moment of weakness for some terrible humor. As mentioned, I really enjoyed Bill Hader and even thought that John Cena had some gems in here – poor guy and terrible stereotype, but sweet regardless. The romantic tone of the movie is sweet but unfortunately often marred by unnecessary sexual jokes and scenes.\n\nDefinitely not worth the hype, a bit too long, very underutilized characters and not really the social commentary or testimony to Amy Schumer’s greatness that I’ve heard. You could do worse, but you can definitely do better as well.\n\nPlot: Two co-dependent high school seniors are forced to deal with separation anxiety after their plan to stage a booze-soaked party goes awry.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nSuperbad was, well, SUPER BAD. It is quite likely that I am simply now too old in my 26 years to connect to a movie based entirely on teenage hormones. Jonah Hill’s character is a prick anyway you look at it –being fat does not allow you to be a complete douchebag. Michael Cera’s character is presented as the noble teen – we all know it is a myth, noble teenagers don’t exist. Emma Stone’s character is at least something to connect to, she’s as cool as ever. The best thing about this film is certainly Christopher Mintz-Plasse as McLovin. The kid is hilarious and steals every scene he is in. Well, that is it. The movie is vulgar and over the top, the kids are gross and icky, and I really would have preferred a film exclusively about McLovin. Now THERE is a movie idea.\n\nPlot: After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions – Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness – conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nJoy can be sad. That statement is so deep man. Wow. Disney and Pixar united to produce this year’s most pleasant surprise – Inside Out is interesting and unique and wins this year’s race in the Originality department. I enjoyed it immensely and am really happy I went to go see it.\n\nI loved Riley’s progression from a newborn to a preteen and how her emotions carried her. It’s touching to witness the start of her life as a carefree infant to a more cautious preteen. With her maturing, other feelings arrive and it is not as easy for Joy to remain the most predominant feeling. My personal favorites were Sadness and Disdain (not the feelings, the characters). The casting of the voices worked well – Amy Poehler has the bubbliest voice ever and Mindy Kalling as Disgust was endlessly entertaining.\n\nThe animation was unique and pretty and original. It was simplistic but had fanciful elements as well and looked really beautiful.\n\nMy only comment that could be construed as not necessarily positive is that Inside Out might be over the head for children. They will certainly enjoy the pretty pictures, but the story is actually quite complex and intricate.\n\nI loved the movie and think it belongs in some of my favorite animations of all time. I don’t often enjoy animations but I think this one is a film that can be enjoyed regardless if you enjoy the genre or not. Highly recommended!"
