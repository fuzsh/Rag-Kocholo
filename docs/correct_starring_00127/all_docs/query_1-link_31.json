        "text": "Seth Rogen has really made a name for himself as a comedic genius in Hollywood by co-writing and co-starring in the high school comedy film “Superbad” and even getting his start on the beloved high school dramedy “Freaks and Geeks.”\n\nIt’s no secret he has many comedy hits under his belt including starring in “The Fabelmans,” which is nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture at the 94th Academy Awards.\n\nWhile speaking to PEOPLE about the critically acclaimed film, he also discussed the lasting legacy of his work in teen comedies, if he would do a “Freaks and Geeks” revival, and how he believes high school movies since “Superbad” came out in 2007.\n\nIt’s simple. Rogen isn’t interested in doing a “Freaks and Geeks” revival. “I don’t think anyone would do it.”\n\n“It’s so rare that you do something in your career that is actually just viewed as good,” he added.\n\n“I know enough now not to [expletive] with that, to just let it be good and not try to go revisit it,” he continued. “And just let it exist.”\n\nThough the show was beloved it last only one season from 1999 to 2000, co-starring Rogen alongside James Franco, Linda Cardellini, John Francis Daley, Jason Segal, Martin Starr, Samm Levine, and Busy Phillips.\n\n“Superbad” was released in 2007 and instead of playing a high school student, this time around Rogen played the irresponsible Officer Michaels alongside Bill Hader’s Officer Slater. The film starred Jonah Hill and Michael Cera in the lead roles, and also co-starred Emma Stone and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.\n\nAccording to Rotten Tomatoes, the film’s synopsis: “High school seniors Seth and Evan have high hopes for a graduation party. The co-dependent teens plan to score booze and babes so they can become part of the in-crowd, but separation anxiety and two bored police officers complicate the pair’s self-proclaimed mission.”\n\nThe film holds a fresh rating of 88% and an audience score of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes (at the time of publication). “Superbad” made an estimated $171 million globally at the box office, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\n“What’s crazy is that Gabe LaBelle is like, 19 years old and his and his friends’ favorite movie is ‘Superbad.’ So it never changed for some reason,” he said about his “Fabelmans” co-star’s love of “Superbad.”\n\nThen he made what PEOPLE call a bold claim: “No one’s made a good high school movie since then.”\n\nObviously, since the release of “Superbad,” there’s been other acclaimed high school movies like “Easy A” (also starring Stone), “Booksmart,” “Dope,” “Edge of Seventeen,” “The Hate U Give,” “The Spectacular Now,” “Lady Bird,” “Project X” and “To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before.”\n\nBur Rogen said what he said.\n\nRead more via PEOPLE.\n\nREAD MORE:"
