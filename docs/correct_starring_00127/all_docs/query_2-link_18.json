        "text": "Highest Rated: 98% Inside Out (2015)\n\nLowest Rated: 8% Doogal (2006)\n\nBirthday: Jun 7, 1978\n\nBirthplace: Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA\n\nA natural mimic with a gentle, offbeat, \"everyman\" quality tailor-made for character acting, Bill Hader made his career breakthrough on \"Saturday Night Live\" (1975- ) in 2005. Hader's geeky appeal led to supporting parts in some of the top comedies of the day including Judd Apatow's \"Knocked Up\" (2007), Ben Stiller's \"Tropic Thunder\" (2008), and Greg Mottola's high school classic, \"Superbad\" (2007), in which he had a memorable role as the world's most gullible policeman. In addition to his association with the kingpins of Hollywood buddy comedies, Hader found a second fan base among animated-film fans. His lively leading role as an aspiring inventor in \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" (2009) firmly established Hader as a smart, appealing, and versatile player with his sights set on moving up the show-business ladder, potential that he acted on by bidding farewell to \"SNL\" in 2013 and unveiling \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2.\" Hader later showed impressive range, starring in the dysfunctional sibling drama \"The Skeleton Twins\" opposite fellow SNL vet Kristen Wiig and co-starring in the Pixar animated hit \"Inside Out\" (2015). On television, Hader reteamed with fellow SNL alums Fred Armisen and Seth Meyers to create and star in the mockumentary series \"Documentary Now\" (IFC 2015- ), in which Hader and Armisen parody various famous documentary films.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n89% Knocked Up\n\n88% Adventureland\n\n88% Superbad 86% Maggie's Plan\n\n86% The Skeleton Twins\n\n84% Trainwreck 83% Forgetting Sarah Marshall 82% Tropic Thunder\n\nPhotos\n\nThe Mindy Project, Bill Hader, 'The Other Dr. L', Season 2, Ep. #2, 09/24/2013, ©FOX The Mindy Project, Bill Hader (L), Kris Humphries (R), 'The Other Dr. L', Season 2, Ep. #2, 09/24/2013, ©FOX The Mindy Project, Bill Hader, 'The Other Dr. L', Season 2, Ep. #2, 09/24/2013, ©FOX The Mindy Project, Bill Hader (L), Chris Messina (R), 'The Other Dr. L', Season 2, Ep. #2, 09/24/2013, ©FOX The Late Late Show With James Corden, Bill Hader, 03/23/2015, ©CBS SUPERBAD, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, 2007. ©Columbia Pictures SUPERBAD, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, 2007. ©Columbia Pictures Good Morning America, Bill Hader (L), Lara Spencer (R), 11/03/1975, ©ABC Courtney (Awkwafina) and Leonard (Bill Hader) in Columbia Pictures and Rovio Animations' ANGRY BIRDS 2.
