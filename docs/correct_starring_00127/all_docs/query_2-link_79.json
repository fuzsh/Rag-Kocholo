        "text": "Bill Hader has been a common name throughout comedy since 2005. From hilariously breaking character in SNL to being a main stay in raunchy R-rated blockbusters. He’s the zany Flint Lockwood from “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs” (2009). He’s the hilarious yet borderline psychopathic Officer Slater in the great “Superbad” (2007). He’s even Andy Warhol in “Men in Black 3” (2012). So yes, Bill Hader has been rocking a capital “D” Dude status for a while.\n\nBut with every artist, there is a need to evolve and spread between genres and style. A challenge if you will. In 2018, a brand new HBO original series titled “Barry” premiered with Hader tapped as a co-creator, writer, and the main lead. If you couldn’t tell, I’ve finally reached the point of this article. Bill Hader owns and “Barry” is the shit, man.\n\nBarry? Heard of it, but what is it? I live under a rock.\n\nDon’t worry, super unaware human. I got you. “Barry” is a dark comedy/crime thriller that revolves around a depressed hitman (Hader) who accepts an assignment in Los Angeles only to end up falling in love with acting. The premise sounds abundantly ridiculous and outlandish, but please hold all questions until after this. Thank you.\n\nThe show features a plethora of wild and memorable characters that are expertly performed with (no joke) the best television acting I have ever seen. Henry Winkler, Sarah Goldberg, Anthony Carrigan, and Stephen Root as the supporting cast is really something to behold. All are hilarious in their own ways and the series absolutely relishes in this. Bill Hader and company hit the jackpot by casting and writing for these very talented comedic actors. You want the hard nose acting teacher? You got it. You want the hilariously self obsessive aspiring actress? You got it. How about the softy Chechen mobster who wears Lulu Lemon? Yeah, man. You got it.\n\nOn the surface, “Barry” definitely hits all the comedy points that you’d expect a Bill Hader series to hit. But only babies swim in the shallow end. This show has a deep end that you’d never expect. It’s bold with what it accomplishes as a crime thriller and drama. Bill Hader and company ditched the shallow end and went swimming.\n\nOkay, so “Barry” is funny. Why is it so special?\n\nAs of writing this article, season 3 of “Barry” has just concluded. It ended a week ago and I am just now gathering the words to express to you how excellent this show is.\n\nBill Hader and company tackle all sorts of problematic subjects such as PTSD, mental illness, domestic abuse, loneliness, and much more. None of this is half-baked or done just to be done. It all has a purpose in this story that is so expertly crafted.\n\n“Barry” is downright dark. I’ve lost track of how many times this show has stunned and stuck with me while trying to get sleep. Some aspects of this show are disturbing and none of it is for the faint of heart. It’s all necessary though in order to totally ground this show in reality. The darkness that shrouds “Barry” is all the more enhanced with Bill Hader’s phenomenal acting. Seriously, the pain and intensity that he conveys at times is stunning. This goes with all the rest of the cast as well. Especially in the most recent season 3, where the show might be at its absolute darkest.\n\nThat being said, the disturbing and emotionally draining nature of the series balances beautifully with the comedy. It is downright brilliant in that regard.\n\n“Barry” is also so special, in a technical and directing regard. The cinematography is fantastic with the editing only enhancing it more. In a directing sense, you will rarely see it done better in any form of media. Some of the best directed shit I have truly ever seen with Bill Hader even impressively taking over as auteur at times. For example, in a scene shown in season 3, Hader directs the absolute shit out of a motorcycle chase scene. Honest to god, watch it and name another scene in media that is directed and filmed the way that scene is. You will not be able to. It’s impossible.\n\nYeah. “Barry” is a special show. Like really special.\n\nOkay, I get it. It’s good. I’ll have to check it out soon.\n\nYes. You need to check out “Barry” as soon as you get the chance. I implore that you do. Please pay for HBO Max right now and begin watching it.\n\nBill Hader, to me, has proven that he might be one of the most talented humans in Hollywood with his acting, writing, and directing. The way I see it, “Barry” will go down as a true turning point in his career as it presents his genius in a masterful way. The amount of awards this series wins will not be able to fully describe the brilliance and ingenuity that the entire crew showcases. I hate throwing around the word “perfect” because nothing ever really is. But that is exactly why “Barry” is perfect.\n\nBill Hader went from a capital “D” Dude to a DUDE. Watch out for him. He will go down as a great."
