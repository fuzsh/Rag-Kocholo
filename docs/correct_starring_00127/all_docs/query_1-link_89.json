        "text": "Heroes of the Zeroes is a daily, alphabetical look back at the 365 best films of 2000-2009.\n\n\"Superbad\" Rated R 2007\n\nStamped with producer Judd Apatow’s irresistible blend of filth and feeling, “Superbad” was as knowingly bittersweet as it was hilariously profane and frankly sexual.\n\nIndie-film director Greg Mottola never lingered on the ick factor, far more interested in the direct talk about loyalty, loneliness and teenage frustration.\n\nWritten by Evan Goldberg and co-star Seth Rogen, “Superbad” bursts with riotous kicks and intelligent, witty choices. The girls pursued aren’t unattainable for overweight or schlubby guys. Its funk-soul soundtrack is the sort that plays in every man’s brain at least once in his life when making a play. And since the subject matter isn’t era-specific, certain scenic details zig and zag.\n\nStill, this bromance wouldn’t be the same without star-making turns from Jonah Hill and Michael Cera as, naturally, Seth and Evan — lifelong pals nearing the end of high school, and perhaps their friendship, trying to get lucky at an end-of-year party.\n\nTapped to buy alcohol, they enlist Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) whose fake ID reading McLovin sets off a sequence of events that eventually involve a pair of rowdy cops (Rogen and Bill Hader).\n\nYou’ll forever savor both Fogell’s bogus name and Mintz-Plasse’s debut performance, blossoming from a squeaky-voiced punchline into the only self-confident amigo.\n\n2007’s funniest film reassured that there is no prefab encompassing approach to life or getting laid that works — just the hope that stumbled-upon strengths at both will point you in the right direction. En route, barking at the moon can be a great temporary defense mechanism."
