        "text": "It’s been over 15 the years since the world was introduced to the Superbad cast. The movie, starring Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Bill Hader, came out in 2007. The film was a coming-of-age comedy directed by Greg Mottola and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. It pretty much put Jonah Hill on the map.\n\nHere, we look at the Superbad cast and where they are now.\n\nJonah Hill as Seth\n\nJonah Hill had bit parts in several movies including I Heart Huckabees (2004), 10 Items or Less (2006) and Knocked Up before landing the lead role as Seth in Superbad.\n\nAfter that, he landed roles in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), Funny People (2009), Get Him to the Greek (2010), Moneyball (2011), the 21 Jump Street franchise (2012 and 2014), and War Dogs (2016).\n\nHe received his first Oscar nomination for portraying Peter Brand in Moneyball and his next Oscar nomination came for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. In 2018, Hill made his directorial debut with the drama Mid90s, which he also wrote. He also released a documentary titled Stutz in 2022, and he cowrote and starred in 2023’s You People.\n\nNext up he plans to direct and star in the movie, Outcome, which he cowrote. The movie will also star Cameron Diaz and Keanu Reeves.\n\nMichael Cera as Evan\n\nCanadian born Michael Cera started acting at a young age. He had a regular spot in the series I Was a Sixth Grade Alien from 1999-2000. He then landed a regular spot on the series Braceface as the voice of Josh (from 2001-2005).\n\nThen came the career defining role as George-Michael Bluth in Arrested Development (he also was in the reboot) where he starred alongside Jason Bateman, Portia de Rossi and Will Arnett. He was also a fan favorite in the role of Evan in Superbad. That same year he starred in the critically-acclaimed movie Juno. He starred in several movies after that including Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist (2008), Year One (2009), and Youth in Revolt (2009).\n\nCera also appeared with Hill in several more movies including This Is the End, Sausage Party, and The LEGO Batman Movie (2017). Most recently he’s been in the series Life & Beth (2022-24).\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse as Fogell\n\nAudiences will always recognize Christopher Mintz-Plasse as McLovin, the fake-ID alter ego of Superbad geek Fogell. The actor exploded onto the Hollywood scene when he played the memorable role in the hit comedy. He told Page Six that the sudden fame was a hard adjustment. “It was very alarming; it was very intense. There was a lot of anxiety, a lot of breakdowns. It wasn’t like I was a working actor that worked my way up to a certain level of fame. It was zero to 100 very fast.”\n\nAfter Superbad, Mintz-Plasse appeared in Role Models (2008), Kick-Ass (2010), Pitch Perfect (2012), Neighbors (2014), Trolls (2016), The Disaster Artist (2017), Promising Young Woman (2020), and Honor Society (2022).\n\nEmma Stone as Jules\n\nEmma Stone got her start with small bits in shows like Malcom in the Middle, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and Medium. Then she got her big break when she was cast at Jules in the Superbad cast. After the movie, she continued to get steady roles in films including The House Bunny (2008), Zombieland (2009), and Easy A (2010).\n\nShe became a household name thanks to parts in The Help (2011), Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), La La Land (2016) and the starring role in 2021’s Cruella. Most recently she’s starred in the series The Curse (2023-24) and Poor Things (2024), which earned her an Oscar.\n\nMartha MacIsaac as Becca in the Superbad Cast\n\nMartha MacIsaac had bit parts in movies including Ice Princess (2005) and Tv shows like This is Wonderland (2006) before landing the part of Becca in the Superbad cast. After that movie MacIsaac was in several TV series including Greek, 1600 Penn, The Pinkertons and the Family Guy. She also appeared in Battle of the Sexes opposite Superbad co-star Emma Stone.\n\nSeth Rogen as Officer Michaels in the Superbad Cast\n\nPrior to being in the Superbad cast, Seth Rogen was in Freaks and Geeks, The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), and his breakout role in Knocked Up (2007), released just weeks before Superbad. Rogen continued his successful streak with Pineapple Express (2008), Funny People, The Green Hornet (2011), The Guilt Trip (2012), The Interview (2014), and The Fabelmans (2022). He also earned an Emmy nomination for his performance as Rand Gauthier in the Hulu miniseries Pam & Tommy.\n\nMUST READ: ‘Chicago Fire’ Cast: Catch Up With the Heroes of Firehouse 51\n\nBill Hader as Officer Slater in the Superbad Cast\n\nBill Hader appeared in You, Me and Dupree and Knocked Up before joining the Superbad cast. He’s best known, however, for starring in Saturday Night Live for eight seasons. He’s also done a lot of voiceover work including Bob’s Burgers, The Awesomes, Inside Out and Finding Dory. Hader was a producer on South Park and one of the executive producers behind Documentary Now! Most recently, he was in the acclaimed HBO dark comedy Barry, serving as producer, director, writer, and star. He has won two Emmys for his performance."
