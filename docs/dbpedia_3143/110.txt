Westminster School, located in the heart of London, is a renowned institution with a rich history and a commitment to academic excellence. Founded on a legacy dating back to the charity school established by Westminster Benedictines before the Norman Conquest, the school’s continuous existence has been documented since the early 14th century.

The school’s academic achievements are exemplary, consistently ranking among the top schools nationally. It boasts an impressive track record, with approximately half of its students securing placements at Oxford or Cambridge universities, marking the highest national Oxbridge acceptance rate. In the 2023 A-Levels, an outstanding 82.3% of candidates achieved A*/A grades.

The application process for Westminster School’s Sixth Form, for students aged 16 and above, is organised to ensure a smooth transition.

Online registration for Sixth Form commences a year before the intended entry date.

The application process involves certain fees that parents are required to cover. These are a registration fee, an entrance fee, and an acceptance deposit, should the child be offered a place. However, parents applying for a bursary to Westminster School and facing financial constraints may qualify for a fee waiver as part of the bursary consideration.

The entrance into Westminster School at 16+ involves an examination to assist in selecting suitable candidates for the next intake. During the registration process, candidates must choose four subjects they intend to study at A Level, each of which requires an entrance examination. Each subject examination lasts for 45 minutes, with detailed requirements outlined on the school’s Departments pages.

Candidates who excel in the examinations are invited for interviews, usually scheduled in late November. Those not selected for interviews receive written notifications. Interviews include 20-minute interviews for each of the four examination subjects, a 40-minute Thinking Skills Assessment, and a 20-minute general interview. Ahead of the interviews, the school solicits a reference from the candidate’s current school head to support the selection process.

Offers of places are dispatched in the first week of December. Some candidates may be placed on a waiting list, with potential future offers. The offer of a place is contingent upon the candidate’s attainment of a minimum of eight (I)GCSE passes at A / 7 grade, of which at least four must be at A* / 8-9 in the subjects they intend to study at A Level.

My desire to join Westminster School is driven by its unparalleled academic excellence and distinguished history. The school’s impressive record, with about half of its students progressing to Oxbridge, reflects a rigorous and stimulating academic environment. Moreover, the school’s unique location in the heart of London, within the precincts of Westminster Abbey, offers an extraordinary educational and cultural experience. I am also attracted to the diverse extracurricular opportunities, particularly in sports and the arts, which align with my personal interests. Westminster’s ethos, encapsulated in its motto “Dat Deus Incrementum”, resonates with me, emphasising both personal effort and the value of community support in personal growth. The school’s blend of tradition and a forward-thinking approach provides an ideal setting for me to develop academically, socially, and personally.
