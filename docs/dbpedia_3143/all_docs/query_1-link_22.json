        "text": "Westminster Academy is a nationally recognized, accredited, college preparatory school with rigorous academics, competitive athletics, and award-winning fine arts. Since its founding by the late Dr. D. James Kennedy in 1971, Westminster Academy has been decidedly mission-driven, firmly committed to Christian scholarship, and keenly focused on kingdom impact for the glory of God. With these combined core convictions as a cornerstone, Westminster Academy serves Christian families in South Florida by educating and equipping their children to be exceptional thinkers, lifelong learners, and influential leaders with a biblical and scholarly perspective for college and beyond.\n\nOur graduates have received extraordinary amounts of college scholarships—most recently, the 67 students of the Class of 2024 collectively received over $5.2 million in scholarship offers. Many go on to attend the top-tier universities in the nation, including the United States Military Service Academies, UNC at Chapel Hill, Covenant, Duke, University of Florida, Florida State University, Furman, Georgia Tech, Gordon, MIT, Notre Dame, University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt, Wake Forest, Wheaton, and Yale.\n\nStudents in PK2 through 12th grade are prayerfully immersed in a caring, Christ-centered setting in such a way that Westminster Academy becomes more than a school—it becomes a community. It is within this community that lessons are learned, life is lived, friendships are forged, and worldviews are formed. This all comes together to create a unique experience not found anywhere else—the Westminster Academy experience. View our 50th Anniversary Commemorative PawPrint, which shares our distinguished legacy and highlights God’s faithfulness to our school in our first five decades.\n\nWhat do we believe?\n\nWestminster Academy is an educational ministry of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church. It gives instruction to children and youth from within a biblical framework as interpreted through the historic, orthodox creeds and doctrines of the Church. In particular, it views God, life, and scripture through that form of biblical interpretation presented by the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms.\n\nWho attends Westminster Academy?\n\nChildren from homes where parents have personally embraced Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, who hold active membership in a local Christian church, and who are supported by a ministerial endorsement are eligible for enrollment. The student body is comprised of children from more than 150 Christian churches representing every major denomination.\n\nPlease contact the Admissions Office at 954.815.0131 or admissions@wa.edu to learn more about the Westminster Academy experience."
