        "text": "Ashridge Houseâs history dates back over 700 years with significant residents such as King Henry VIII, and a storied journey as a wartime hospital and most recently, a world-renowned business school.\n\nThe College of Bonhommes monastery is founded by Edmund, Earl of Cornwall in 1283 and flourished as a seat of learning and debate.\n\nWith the dissolution of monasteries in 1539, Ashridge fell under the ownership of King Henry VIII, who called the Ashridge House home for 11 years. Princess Elizabeth was raised at Ashridge House during her youth.\n\nOwnership of Ashridge is formally transferred to Princess Elizabeth as stipulated in her fatherâs (King Henry VIIIâs) will. Princess Elizabeth lived here until she was arrested by her sister by Mary in 1554.\n\nThe house was bought by Urban Hanlon Broughton. Â It was used as a training centre for Conservative Party workers to commemorate Andrew Bonar Law, the Prime Minister.\n\nWith the start of World War II, the castle became a hospital once again, this time as an extension of the emergency wing of the Charing Cross Road Hospital. Starting in 1940, the hospital treated over 20,000 patients and saw the birth of 2,700 babies in its maternity ward. The concrete overspill wards remain Crown property until 1983 for use as a Public Records Office.\n\nAshridge was converted into a finishing school for ladies called the House of Citizenship. For almost a decade, the school offered four term courses to young women where they learned proper social etiquette and the ins and outs of upper class culture."
