        "text": "How old is Westminster Abbey?\n\nThe origins of the Abbey date back to the 960s or early 970s when Saint Dunstan and King Edgar installed a community of Benedictine monks on the site. Between 1042 and 1052, the Abbey, named St Peter's Abbey, was rebuild by Edward the Confessor to provide himself with a Royal burial church. Completed around 1060 it was the first church in England to be built in a Romanesque style. It was consecrated on the 28th December 1065 a week before Edward's death, and who was subsequently buried in the church.\n\nWho built Westminster Abbey?\n\nConstruction on the Westminster Abbey we see today began in 1245 by Henry III who had selected it as the site for his burial. The Abbey became the coronation site of Norman Kings, though none were buried there until Henry III. The church was rebuilt in an Anglo-French Gothic style as a shrine to venerate King Edward the Confessor. Work on Westminster Abbey continued between 1245 and 1517 with it being completed by architect Henry Yevele. In 1503 Henry VII added a Perpendicular style chapel which was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1540 Henry VIII gave Westminster Abbey cathedral status which would spare it from the destruction or dissolution.\n\nHow tall is Westminster Abbey?\n\nNicholas Hawksmoor was the mastermind behind building the two Western Towers at Westminster Abbey which were constructed between 1722 and 1745 and which were inspired by a Gothic Revival design. The walls and floors of the Abbey are made from purbeck marble. Westminster Abbey is 69m (225 feet) high, with a width of 26m (85 feet) and a floor area of 32,000 square feet.\n\nAre Coronations held at Westminster Abbey?\n\nSince the coronations of both King Harold and William the Conqueror in 1066, Westminster Abbey has seen every English and British monarch crowned there (except Edward V and Edward VII who were never crowned). The King Edward's chair is the throne on which English and British sovereigns are crowned. The chair is now located within the Abbey in the St George's Chapel near the West Door and has been used for every coronation since 1308. Since 1066 there have been 39 Coronations.\n\nThe most recent Coronation at Westminster Abbey was that of Queen Elizabeth II who was crowned Queen at the age of 25 on the 2nd June 1953 after the death of her father King George VI on the 6th February 1952. The Coronation took place more than a year after King George VI's death because of the tradition that holding such a festival is inappropriate during the period of mourning that follows the death of a monarch. During the service Queen Elizabeth II took and subscribed an oath to govern the peoples according to their respective laws and customs.\n\nThis was the first coronation to be televised with 27 million people in the UK alone watching it, plus millions from overseas.\n\nHow many Royal Weddings have there been at Westminster Abbey?\n\nTo date there have been 17 Royal Weddings at Westminster Abbey, which in chronological order are:\n\n11 November 1100: King Henry I of England was married to Matilda of Scotland\n\n4 January 1243: Richard, Earl of Cornwall (later King of Germany), brother of King Henry III of England, to Sanchia of Provence (his second wife).

A pier of eight shafts carries the vaulted ceiling with the sides including the remains of 14th Century paintings and numerous stone benches. The house includes an original mid-13th-century tiled pavement with a door which is believed to be the oldest in England having been built in 1050.
