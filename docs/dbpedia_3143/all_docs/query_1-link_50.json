        "text": "Westminster Christian School opened its doors on September 6, 1961, on the grounds of Shenandoah Presbyterian Church. Three teachers served students in grades 1-8, under the leadership of Mr. Jacob Heerema, the first school principal. Just two years later, Westminster moved to its new and present location with an increased enrollment of 169 students, and 14 full-time and five part-time teachers.\n\nMr. Daniel DeLange succeeded Mr. Heerema as principal, and under his able and persevering leadership, Westminster continued to move forward. By 1966, Westminster graduated its first class of high school seniors.\n\nThroughout the decades, the school has established a presence as one of the leading independent Christian schools in Florida. With the help of God, Westminster will continue to empower learners, prepare hearts, and inspire lives to faithfully serve as ambassadors for Christ for decades to come."
