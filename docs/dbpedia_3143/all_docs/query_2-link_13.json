        "text": "King Henry VIII College, Malaysia (KH8) was established in 2018. It is the first international sister school to Christ College Brecon, an independent school in the UK founded by King Henry VIII in 1541. KH8 is an independent, multinational, non-denominational day and boarding school with English as the language of instruction. Boarding is currently available to students in Year 6 (Grade 5) and above.\n\nThe school is located in Cyberjaya, a planned township on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. Already a member of the Association of International Malaysian Schools (AIMS) and the Boarding Schools Association (BSA), the school is also an associate member of FOBISIA - a regional organisation recognized by the UK Department for Education.\n\nKing Henry VIII College is a new school, but one with a history that stretches back nearly 500 years. Christ College, Brecon was famously founded in 1541 by Henry VIII, whose name will grace this new school in Malaysia, which will be the first overseas school established by Christ College. Like its Welsh sibling, King Henry VIII College will be a co-educational boarding and day school, with pupils from 3 to 18 years of age. Visitors to Christ College in Brecon invariably comment on the special atmosphere there, and the heartfelt warmth of the welcome they receive.\n\nChrist College was founded in 1541 by Henry VIII and every pupil proudly bears the ‘h’ logo that links the current members of the school with the founder.\n\nChrist College is now one of the oldest and most successful independent schools in Britain. The school buildings continue to reflect its ancient past as well as its determination to provide the best modern facilities possible for its pupils. There are now over 350 pupils at Christ College Brecon, a size which enables it to offer a wide range of academic and extra-curricular activities, whilst giving everyone the chance to form close friendships and to develop a real sense of belonging.\n\nToday, parents and guardians value the unique care and concern that pupils receive at Christ College - support from highly qualified and experienced staff which extends beyond the classroom to every aspect of daily life and leads to a high level of achievement in both academic and non-academic areas.\n\nKing Henry VIII College is a fully fledged sister school to Christ College Brecon with over 475 years of British education pedigree and Welsh spirit. The school replicates its structure, ethos and achievements but in a more modern setting in the global tech hub, Cyberjaya."
