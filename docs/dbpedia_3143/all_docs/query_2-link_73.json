However the construction of the chapel was a very slow process, largely due to funding problems, as Henry VI’s grand designs were very expensive!\n\nHenry VII’s victory at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, when he defeated and killed Richard III, also led to further delays in the building of the Chapel, because his focus was on getting the country back under control. Despite the College’s petition for the building work to recommence, due to its unsightly semi-completed appearance, the building work ceased for another 20 years.\n\nIn 1508 work restarted on a large scale and despite Henry VII dying in 1509, money from his will ensured that the building work continued.\n\nIn 1512 the shell of the chapel was finished, including the whole roof being covered with timber and lead. The executors of Henry VII also contributed £5000 towards paying for the vaulting of the Chapel, which meant that by 1515 the main structure was finally complete! The vaulted ceiling, screen, a large amount of the woodwork and the glazing of the windows in the Chapel, were completed during his son; Henry VIII’s reign. The architect John Wastell created the beautiful vaulted ceiling design and it took just three years to complete his impressive design and it is still the largest fan vault ceiling in the world.\n\nJust over one hundred years after the laying of the foundation stone of King’s College Chapel, at the time of Henry VIII’s death in 1547, the Chapel was considered to be one of the grandest and most exquisite buildings in Europe and is still is to this day.\n\nIn the Chapel you can see images representing the Tudors, for example the Tudor rose and a variety of carved animals.\n\nDiscover More\n\nAdmission is FREE for Cambridge children under 12 visiting with their family or school.
