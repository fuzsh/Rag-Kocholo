We provide the educational support and guidance that allows all of our pupils to achieve a greater level of performance than that which they might achieve elsewhere.\n\nWe have a strong history of academic success, pastoral care and outstanding co-curricular activities that retains the best of a traditional grammar school ethos, with a forward-thinking approach to an all-round education.

Our community thrives on a foundation of mutual respect and honesty.\n\nWe are very proud of our success in equipping pupils for life in a diverse and changing society and offering pupils a variety of challenging opportunities for learning, development and growth.\n\nI hope that you will find all the information you need within this website.
