        "text": "Explore our History\n\nCollege Hall\n\nThis is the oldest continuously used dining room in London. It was part of the building of the new Abbot's House, together with the Jerusalem Chamber, by Litlyngton. It is not open to the public.\n\nThe hall was built by Abbot Litlyngton and finished in 1376 when the windows were glazed. It was used for dining by the household and guests of the Abbot, who would preside from the raised dais at the far end. Heating was provided by a fire on a hearth in the centre of the hall - this continued as the source of heating until 1847. Most of the roof is original, including the louvre or lantern in the centre to let out the smoke. The hall was originally hung with tapestries and the wainscot was added in 1733.\n\nAt the Reformation the hall was used by both the Dean and Chapter and the King's Scholars of Westminster School. The School performed an annual Latin play here until 1730. Above the high table are painted large coats of arms of the Abbey and the two colleges closely connected with the School ie. Christ Church, Oxford and Trinity College, Cambridge."
