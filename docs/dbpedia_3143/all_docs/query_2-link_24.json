Children enthusiastically collected photos, exercise books and other objects to represent current times.\n\nPupils wearing PPE placed the capsule into the ground, and took it in turn to cover it with soil. The children were joined by the Chair of Monmouthshire County Council, Cllr. Laura Wright, Cllr. Martyn Groucutt, Cabinet Member for Education, the Chair of Governors of King Henry VIII School, head teachers and special guests from Morgan Sindall the construction company.\n\nCllr. Martyn Groucutt, Cabinet Member for Education said: “I am really proud of the King Henry VIII 3-19 School that the Council and Welsh Government are building here. It’s going to be the first carbon neutral 3-19 school in Wales – so important given the climate emergency.\n\n“It’s been wonderful to visit the site today for the time capsule ceremony -thank you so much to the children of Deri View Primary School who have buried a little part of 2023 in the ground here – it’s a very exciting moment that I’m sure these children will remember forever.”\n\nCllr. Laura Wright, Chair of Monmouthshire County Council added: “It’s lovely to hear how brilliantly the children have worked together and how extensively they’ve researched this exciting project. Well done everyone, you have played a key part in this wonderful new school.”\n\nDeri View Primary School’s pupils shared some reflections on the day:\n\nLyra felt: “It was incredibly enjoyable and I felt like I was part of something so important.” Libby describes: “I put a letter and a hand print in the time capsule. I can’t wait for someone to open it up in the future and find out what it was like to be a child in 2023.” Kasper said: “I put glasses and a school bag in the time capsule and I helped bury the capsule in the ground.”\n\nFor more information about the school please visit: All-through school in Abergavenny – Monmouthshire\n\nTags: abergavenny, Cllr Laura Wight, Cllr Martyn Groucutt, King Henry VIII school, Monmouthshire, Morgan Sindall, through school"
