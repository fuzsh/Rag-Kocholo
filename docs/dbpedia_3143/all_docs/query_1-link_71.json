        "text": "Westminster has long cultivated innovative, entrepreneurial initiatives alongside an academic program that consistently ranks among the most successful in the nation. But unlike our highly regarded core curriculum, our most creative platformsâthink WCAT, Robotics, StudioW, and othersâhave been built in borrowed space, attracting ample student participants against all odds. That is about to change.\n\nI am thrilled to announce the construction of The Blake Center in the heart of our campus on the site of Scott Hall and directly across the Quad from Pressly Hall. Trustee Liz and Frank Blake were captivated by the vision for a center of innovation that would house some of our most dynamic, future-focused opportunities under one roof and provide both the well-designed space and collaborative possibilities that these programs deserve.\n\nTo say that we are grateful for the Blakesâ generosity would be an understatement. Like philanthropic heroes throughout Westminsterâs history, Liz and Frank envisioned the creation of a legacy that would transform our student experience. Our gratitude for their commitment is matched only by our confidence that this investment will inspire a generation of inventors, entrepreneurs, problem-solversâin a word, leadersâwho will use The Blake Center as an incubator for their ambition to change the world for the better.\n\nFrom Campbell Hall to Hawkins Hall to Barge Commons to soon-to-be-finished Love Hallâand moreâwe are experiencing the profound impact of new buildings and gathering spaces across Westminsterâs entire campus. The Blake Center will amplify this impact even further when it is finished in 2026. It will be a powerful catalyst for encouraging the creativity and curiosity of generations of Wildcats.\n\nRead on and enjoy a preview of this iconic new landmark at Westminster!\n\nOnward,\n\nKeith Evans\n\nPresident\n\nAt Westminster, the work of teaching students to innovate is designed as an interdisciplinary journey that begins with our youngest Wildcats in Love Hall and grows through the Middle and Upper Schools. At every stage, faculty create learning experiences to emphasize that innovation begins with connections among ideas and people. By the time they graduate, students are equipped as lifelong innovators with the mindset to love challenge and the skill set to lead change.\n\nThe Roberto C. Goizueta Center for Innovation is the catalyst that drives these immersive learning experiences, allowing Westminster faculty and students of all ages to imagine, design, and discover every day. Made possible through the transformative generosity of The Goizueta Foundation, the Roberto C. Goizueta Center for Innovation gives our students the unique capacity, through the development of critical problem-seeking and problem-solving skills, to approach the world through a lens that is curious, optimistic, and agile."
