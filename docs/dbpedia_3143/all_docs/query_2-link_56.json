        "text": "For entry to the EYFS and Primary sections of the school, in children will usually meet with the Head of Primary or another designated teacher for a one-to-one assessment which will consider and assess literacy, numeracy and reasoning, as well as social skills and developmental progress. They will be interviewed to establish their broader interests and character. Where appropriate further assessment may take place.\n\nEntry into Years 7 to 10 is based on satisfactory performance in tests in English and Mathematics, and an IQ test; for those with English as a second language, an English proficiency test will be arranged.\n\nEntry into Years 11 to 13 is based on GCSE/IGCSE predictions, a school reference or report, an IQ test, and an interview with the Head and/or the Deputy Head Academic.\n\nThere is no deadline for all year group except Nursery where it is calculated according to the birth month and registration will be accepted when applicant is 36 months old. All applications from other year group will be encouraged to come and register their interest, where applications will follow with assessment besides securing a placement in particular year group.\n\nAt KH8, our aim is to provide a nurturing environment that supports student in achieving their goals. Providing the right environment for students: one where they feel safe and secure, giving them the opportunity to develop confidence and a love for learning in each stage of their education are based on our belief. We want all students to leave feeling proud of their academic achievements which is important but is part of what we offer - with our wide ranging Co-Curricular programme, students have the opportunity to develop other interests and passions they have, alongside to develop their leadership skills. KH8 aspires to nurture and develop respectful, responsible and resilient global citizens who lead positive and fulfilling lives."
