        "text": "Thank you for visiting the website of Westminster Christian Academy.\n\nSince 1988, Westminster Christian Academy has been partnering with Christian families in our community to provide an excellent Christ-centered education. Our school community is made up of Christian families from Clarke, Oconee, Jackson, Madison, Morgan, Oglethorpe, Barrow and other surrounding counties. The culture of Westminster Christian Academy is unique and allows for each student to reach their full potential by creating an environment focused on meeting the individual needs of each student. Our loving and Christ-focused culture allows students to grow academically, spiritually and socially while being mentored by our faculty and staff made up of devoted Christ-followers who are passionate about impacting the next generation. Our college prep curriculum is taught from a classical perspective and our students exceed state and national scoring on all standardized testing. Our athletic and fine arts programs have won numerous regional and state championships and provide incredible opportunities for our students to grow outside of the classroom.\n\nIt is an immense privilege to lead our school into what we believe will be the greatest days in school history. Our student enrollment continues to grow as we currently have the largest enrollment in school history. To accommodate this growth, our campus expansion plan is now in place which will continue to provide excellent facilities to serve our students and families. Let me encourage you to come and see all that God is doing at Westminster Christian Academy.\n\nJared T. Clark\n\nHead of School"
