        "text": "King Henry VIII might be best known for having six wives but did you know he also played a major role in shaping our city? Just months before his death, King Henry VIII made a decision that would shape the history of Cambridge forever.\n\nIn one of his last acts, the 54-year-old monarch merged two of the university's colleges to form Trinity College - but he didn't do so without putting up a fight. It was only the pleading of his wife, Catherine Parr, that persuaded him after he had threatened to close down the two colleges instead.\n\nThe King had been seizing Catholic church lands from across the country as he reformed England into a Protestant country. Given Cambridge University's links to Catholicism, it was next on the list.\n\nRead more: History in Cambridge\n\nAfter rumours that Henry VIII planned to seize two colleges - Michaelhouse, which dated back to 1324, and King's Hall founded in 1317 - the university pleaded with his sixth wife to change his mind. Catherine Parr, who outlived her husband by a year and eight months, persuaded him not to close them down.\n\nInstead, the King would merge Michaelhouse and King's Hall, along with seven hostels, to form what is now known as Trinity College. He intended to create an institution that would support his vision for the Church of England by producing future Protestant leaders.\n\nTrinity quickly became the wealthiest college thanks to gifts from Henry VIII, including small private estates that he had purchased.\n\nGifts from other members and friends supporting the college have since helped Trinity to become the largest, richest of 31 colleges at the university - with more than £1 billion in endowment assets."
