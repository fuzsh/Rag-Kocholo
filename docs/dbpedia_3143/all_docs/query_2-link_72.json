        "text": "Editor's note: Paintings conservator Christine Slottved Kimbriel of Cambridge University’s Hamilton Kerr Institute in the United Kingdom visited the Denver Art Museum to study our portrait of Henry VIII. What she found surprised us! Here’s her report.\n\nPaintings made in the early 1500s in England are extremely rare—few have survived these 500 years. They’re also a mystery. They were rarely signed, little documentary evidence about them has come down to us, and they were painted in a style that limited an artist’s individual expression. How, then, to identify a particular artist and link him to a particular painting? That was the challenge with the Berger Collection’s portrait of a boyish, beardless Henry VIII, painted when he was in his teens.\n\nMy work had begun in Cambridge, where my colleagues and I had been conducting research on four Tudor royal portraits—three of the young Henry VIII and one of his father, Henry VII. All four had been identified as having been painted on wood from the same oak tree. Remarkably, the Berger picture was shown also to have been painted on wood from that same tree! That fact, plus the Berger picture’s stylistic similarity to the other four portraits, strongly suggested the group were painted by the same artist. And among the prime candidates was Meynnart Wewyck, an artist from the Netherlands who was court painter to both Henry VII and Henry VIII. If I could demonstrate through technical analysis that the Berger portrait had been painted in much the same way as the other four, I would be able to add another Tudor royal portrait to the growing corpus of paintings thought to have been created by Meynnart Wewyck."
