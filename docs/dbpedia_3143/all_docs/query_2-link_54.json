        "text": "The School was first established to educate the choristers of the worshipping community of Ely, and throughout our history we have maintained strong links with Ely Cathedral.\n\nIn 1541, King Henry VIII founded a College of Canons at Ely Cathedral to replace the monks whose monastery had been dissolved in 1539 and the school received its Royal Charter, later becoming known as \"The King's School\".\n\nFor much of the school’s history, the King’s Scholars constituted the entire school. In 1970, King’s Ely became co-educational and in 1973, Queen Elizabeth II visited the school and instituted the first Queen’s Scholars.\n\nAlthough we cherish our history, schools are about the todays and tomorrows of our pupils, and while we learn from the past, we look to the future. We are a vibrant community that offers all you would expect of a 21st century school, and a great deal more.\n\nToday, King's Ely educates around 1,150 boys and girls aged 2 to 18, including around 200 boarders."
