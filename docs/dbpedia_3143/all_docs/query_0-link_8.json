        "text": "School Profile\n\nWestminster School is a historic public school in Westminster, London, England, in the precincts of Westminster Abbey. It derives from a charity school founded by Westminster Benedictines before the 1066 Norman Conquest, as documented by the Croyland Chronicle and a charter of King Offa. Continuous existence is clear from the early 14th century.\n\nIts academic results place it among the top schools nationally; about half its students go to Oxbridge, giving it the highest national Oxbridge acceptance rate. Boys join Under School at seven and Senior School at 13 by examination. Girls join the Sixth Form at 16. About a quarter of the 750 pupils board. Weekly boarders may go home after Saturday morning school. Westminster was the 13th most expensive HMCd ay school and 10th most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK in 2014/2015. It achieved the highest percentage of students accepted by Oxbridge colleges over the period 2002–2006, and was ranked as best boys’ school in the country in terms of GCSE results in 2017."
