        "text": "Evidence of teaching\n\nThere is no clear date of foundation but teaching existed at Oxford in some form in 1096.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nA Paris ban\n\nOxford developed rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris following a quarrel with Thomas Becket.\n\n(Image: Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury stained glass window in the Chapter House at Westminster Abbey. Credit: Shutterstock.)\n\nA notable visitor\n\nIn 1188, the historian Gerald of Wales gave a public reading to the assembled Oxford dons (university lecturers, especially at Oxford or Cambridge). As a royal clerk to the king and two archbishops, Gerald of Wales travelled widely and wrote extensively.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nFirst overseas student\n\nIn around 1190 the arrival of Emo of Friesland, the first known overseas student, set in motion the University’s tradition of developing international scholarly links.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nThe title of Chancellor\n\nBy 1201 the University was headed by a ‘magister scholarum (head of an ecclesiastical school) Oxonie’, on whom the title of Chancellor was later conferred in 1214, and in 1231 the Masters were recognised as a universitas or corporation.\n\n(Image: The current Chancellor, Lord Patten of Barnes.)\n\nFirst colleges\n\nDuring the 13th century, rioting between town and gown (townspeople and students) hastened the establishment of primitive halls of residence.\n\nThese were succeeded by the first of Oxford’s colleges, which began as endowed houses or medieval halls of residence, under the supervision of a Master.\n\nEstablished between 1249 and 1264, University, Balliol and Merton Colleges are the oldest.\n\n(Image: Merton College and chapel, from the first quadrangle, 1775-1827.

In 1355, Edward III paid tribute to the University for its invaluable contribution to learning. He also commented on the services rendered to the state by distinguished Oxford graduates.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nReligious and political controversy\n\nEarly on, Oxford became a centre for lively controversy with scholars involved in religious and political disputes.\n\nJohn Wyclif, a 14th-century Master of Balliol, campaigned for a Bible in English, against the wishes of the papacy.\n\nIn the 16th century, Henry VIII forced the University to accept his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and the Anglican churchmen Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley were later tried for heresy and burnt at the stake in the city.\n\nThe University was Royalist during the Civil War and Charles I held a counter-Parliament in the University’s Convocation House.\n\nIn the late 17th century, the Oxford philosopher John Locke, suspected of treason, was forced to flee the country.\n\nScientific discovery and religious revival\n\nThe 18th century became an era of scientific discovery and religious revival.\n\nEdmond Halley, Professor of Geometry, predicted the return of the comet that bears his name.\n\nJohn and Charles Wesley’s prayer meetings laid the foundations for the Methodist Society.\n\nFind out more:\n\nOxford people\n\nFamous Oxonians\n\nBritish Prime Ministers | University of Oxford\n\nAward winners | University of Oxford\n\nThe Oxford Movement\n\nFrom 1833 onwards, the Oxford Movement sought to revitalise the Catholic aspects of the Anglican Church. One of its leaders, John Henry Newman, became a Roman Catholic in 1845 and was later made a Cardinal. In 2019 he was canonised as a saint.\n\n(Image: Close-up of Cardinal Newman bust from Trinity College Garden Quad, Oxford University.

By 1986, all of Oxford’s male colleges had changed their statutes to admit women and, since 2008, all colleges have admitted men and women.\n\n(Image: The first women to be awarded degrees at Oxford University.

In so doing, it has enhanced and strengthened its traditional role as an international focus for learning and a forum for intellectual debate.\n\nA life-saving vaccine\n\nOxford University has been at the centre of the COVID-19 response from the very onset of the crisis, remaining at the forefront of global efforts to combat the disease and to mitigate its many effects, such as developing a vaccine and identifying treatments. By early 2022, more than 2.6 billion doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine had been supplied to over 180 countries, with approximately two-thirds going to low and middle-income countries. The vaccine is estimated to have helped prevent 50 million COVID-19 cases, five million hospitalisations, and saved more than one million lives.\n\n(Image: Seven of the Oxford academics recognised in the Queen’s Birthday Honours for their work on stopping the pandemic.
