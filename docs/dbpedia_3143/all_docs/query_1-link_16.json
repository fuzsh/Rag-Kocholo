        "text": "In 1946 Wilfred Fischer opened Nashville’s first Protestant Kindergarten at Westminster Presbyterian Church. In 1947 the school moved into the Church’s newly constructed Christian Education Building, where 45 children attended school in one large room.\n\nOver the years as enrollment steadily increased, the school used various spaces to accommodate the growth, and in 1998 the entire program, which had increased to 165 children and 23 staff members moved to a newly completed facility at the church.\n\nIn September 2010, Westminster Presbyterian Church’s “Toddlers and Twos” program (a Mother’s Day Out program operated by the church) merged with Westminster Kindergarten to form Westminster School for Young Children. WSYC serves nearly 300 children today, employs over 40 teachers and administrators, and is still an outreach mission of Westminster Presbyterian Church."
