        "text": "These words define and distinguish Westminster School. They represent a tradition, a culture, an attitude, an aspiration, a way of life for our students and faculty, an advantage for our graduates.\n\nGrit characterizes the effort students make to meet our high expectations for academic work, athletics, and community involvement. Grace speaks to the way they negotiate these responsibilities with generosity of spirit, good manners and respect for all. The unique and powerful combination of grit and grace is what makes Westminster people successful, not only here, but also later in life.\n\nDerived from our motto virtute et numine, \"grit and grace\" encapsulates in one phrase our culture, our promise, a commitment to ourselves and others. Westminster students and faculty strive for excellence – and humility, personal success – and service to others, lofty goals – and common human decency. Blending the ethics of grace with the competition and effort of grit, Westminster encourages its students to test the boundaries of their abilities, to try something new, and to win and lose with grace.\n\nWhere grit and grace come together, where excellence meets opportunity, almost anything is possible.\n\nWestminster School was founded by William Lee Cushing in 1888 as a boys’ school in Dobbs Ferry, New York. A graduate of Yale, and a firm believer in the traditional form of English boarding school education, Mr. Cushing was strongly influenced by the Reverend Edward Thring, headmaster of Uppingham School in England. Thring believed in “education as training for life.”\n\nMr. Cushing’s formula for education was endorsed by many in the emerging influential American families, who sent their sons to Westminster, including John Hay, Advisor to Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State to Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt."
