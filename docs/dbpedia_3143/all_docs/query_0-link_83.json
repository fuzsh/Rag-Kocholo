        "text": "I rarely use the word awesome in my blog but in this case it is highly appropriate. It was constructed to be awesome and inside it is guaranteed to take your breath away. Although, linked to Edward the Confessor in the 11th century, the church you see today replaced Edward’s impressive building beginning in 1245 and was largely constructed by Henry III and later kings. It was consecrated in October 1269 but the building has been reconstructed throughout its existence with, for example the two towers at the front being added in 1745. Needless to say it was bombed in World War Two and had to be restored like many other important buildings in the UK.\n\nWestminster Abbey is the burial place for 3,300 people including; Edward I and his wife; Eleanor of Castile; Edward III and his wife, Philippa of Hainault; Henry V, sometimes seen as the greatest ever King of England; Queen Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots. In total, 17 monarchs are buried in Westminster Abbey. Added to that there are 600 memorials including for such geniuses as William Shakespeare, Charles Darwin, Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Dickens, William Wordsworth, Stephen Hawking, Sir Winston Churchill and T S Elliot. As well as these lists, but easily missed is the tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer often referred to as the “Father of English Literature”. Once inside the building your head will spin looking at the stunning ceilings as well as all the features at eye land ground level. Countless celebrations and ceremonies have taken place over 750 years including the coronation of William the Conqueror at Christmas 1066 and his successors, except of Edward V (one of Princes in the Tower who mysteriously disappeared ) and Edward VIII who abdicated and was never were officially crowned. It was also the place for a sixteen royal marriages such as Henry I to Matilda of Scotland in 1100, the marriage of Queen Elizabeth II to Prince Philip (Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh) in November 1947 and, more recently, the marriage of Prince William (Duke of Cambridge and now Prince of Wales) to Kate (now Kathryn) Middleton in April 2011. In September 2022 it became the venue for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II although she was buried in St George’s Chapel, Windsor.\n\nAbove and below; behind the High Altar is the Shrine of St Edward the Confessor. Edward was known to be a very pious king and after his death, miracles began to occur or at least became documented as such by some very keen monks who, according to some modern interpretations were devoted to promoting his case to the Pope even if a few pieces of evidence had to be “created”. Unfortunately, before his grand church was consecrated he became very ill and so he never saw it “in all its glory”. In 1161, Edward was canonised (made a saint) and so in 1163 it was moved to a more central and important position by Henry II. A hundred year’s later when Henry III decided to build the new Westminster Abbey, it was important to him that Edward the confessor’s shrine would be at the centre of the rebuild and so the body was moved or to use the appropriate term, translated once again. The shrine “was encrusted in gold and jewels” and remained so, gleaming in the light until Henry VIII’s Reformation and dissolution of all the monasteries. This meant , of course, Henry got all the riches, just the same as at Thomas Becket’s tomb in Canterbury Cathedral. If you would like to see the shrine you would need join a tour. People cannot just walk in because it is a sacred place.\n\nIf you look carefully, you will see some effigies of some medieval monarchs that have their tombs close to the shrine.\n\nAbove, to the left of the tomb of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York is the tomb of Queen Elizabeth I, last of the Tudors and youngest daughter of Henry VIII. Accompanying her is her sister, Mary I . Unfortunately there is not an effigy of Mary 1. Mary was queen of England from July 1553 to November 1558. In her short reign she gained the epithet, “Bloody Mary” for burning at the stake over 200 Protestants who refused to convert to the re-introduced Catholicism. When Elizabeth came to the throne she reintroduced Protestantism in the form of the Church of England. This eventually led to war with Spain and the invasion threat of the Spanish Armada. She also courted trouble by sponsoring voyages by Sir Francis Drake to steal gold from Spanish galleons. The Spanish hoped to overthrow Elizabeth and replace her with the Catholic, Mary Queen of Scots but failed. Mary Queen of Scots was captured and imprisoned by Elizabeth. In 1587, Elizabeth’s officials and advisers had Mary decapitated. Elizabeth’s reign lasted from November 1558 to March 1603.\n\nJust before your arrival at the Chapter House, in the passage, you will come across an oak door which has been called “Britain’s oldest and only Anglo-Saxon door”. It dates back to the reign of King/Saint Edward the Confessor the 1050s. In 2005, a sample was taken to date it known as dendrochronology. As we have tree ring patterns dating back hundreds of years in a database with each ring given a yearly date, the pattern of the tree rings can be compared to the database and where they match. This will give a date of when the tree was alive and when it was felled. The term, tree ring patterns mean the distance between each ring and this varies according to the weather in any particular year. The tests for the wood here gave a date of being felled as about 1032. Apparently, the rings show growth from 924 AD but some of the outside rings next to the bark have been removed, its exact felling is unknown. It is believed that the door was constructed and originally positioned in the 1050s. They could even tell that its ring pattern shows that it came from eastern England. When Henry III knocked down most of the old church and replaced it with the current one, the door was probably recycled, reduced in size and moved to its present location.\n\nBelow; “The Queens’Diamond Jubilee Galleries”. These have been created to replace the museum of Westminster Abbey and a separate ticket has to be purchased to see them. No photography is allowed in this area and so I have used official photos. They are 16 metres above the floor of the Abbey but do have a lift for visitors with mobility issues. On show, is some beautiful medieval artwork, 21 funeral effigies and the amazing death mask of Henry VII. In total 300 objects are on display including the coronation chair of Queen Mary II, Queen Elizabeth I’s corset, as well as many things used in the everyday life of the Abbey. There is also the opportunity to look down on the Cosmati Floor shown earlier and the nave going back to the Great West Door.\n\nAbove; just before you leave the cathedral you will come across the royal throne. It was made after Edward I had captured the famous “Stone of Scone” in 1296. This was a block of sandstone that was used for the coronation of the Scottish kings and thus, of significant symbolic importance to the people of Scotland. Edward had the throne made big enough to fit over the stone and remind the Scots of his superiority. Since 1308 the throne has been used at every British coronation. Only in 1996 was the stone sent back to Scotland and apparently it will return for the coronation of King Charles III.\n\nAbove; lastly, here’s a shout-out for flying buttresses, the Cinderella of cathedral architecture. You have heard of the saying, behind every great man there is a great woman”? Well, behind every great gothic church there’s a great flying buttress. Without the flying buttress, the whole lot would come tumbling down. There would be no stunning ceilings, no awesome windows and the whole place would be very dark. Unfortunately, flying buttresses get ignored by most visitors! Perhaps they should put some signs up pointing at them and explaining their importance. They may look pretty boring but do an amazing job. Sadly, no-one knows who invented flying buttresses. Abbot Sugar in the 12th century, gets the credit for starting gothic architecture at St Denis but experts claim it began in that northern France area in several churches and St Denis was just where a lot of gothic ideas came together. Every time you visit a cathedral, have a look around the side and see the flying buttresses. In this photo, look how tall they are to allow the thin walls, linked by amazing vaulting and filled with large and beautiful windows.\n\n2. What is the history of Westminster Abbey?\n\nWe are not sure about the exact origins of the first church on this location but it is thought that in the days when England was a series of kingdoms, the king of the East Saxons built a church on a small island in the River Thames, called Thorney Island. A little later, this church was given the name Westminster because a minster church already existed nearby which we now know as St Paul’s Cathedral. Legend has it that this Westminster church was consecrated by St Peter himself.\n\nBy 785 AD a small monastery had been developed there. King Edward the Confessor, (1043-1066 AD), a highly religious man, decided to build a new church on the site for the monastery which was consecrated on December 28th 1065. As stated earlier, he was too sick to see its opening but was buried there soon afterwards. In 1161, King Edward was made a saint after several reported miracles and moved to a shrine in the Abbey. Over time, the cult of St Edward began to develop and by the reign of Henry III (1216-1272) the king was desperate to associate himself with the new saint and his relics.\n\nHenry’s response in 1245, was to demolish the old church except for the nave and begin to build the church that you see today which was completed in October 1269. Henry III had great rivalry with the French king. Not only had had Louis IX of France got beautiful, gothic cathedrals, he had supposedly purchased Jesus’ Crown of Thorns and a small part of the “True Cross”. In her book, Emma Wells writes, “By the end of Henry’s reign (1272) the coronation rite practised at Westminster mimicked that performed at Louis’s royal coronation church at Notre-Dam de Reims, which, with its employment of the holy oil Saint Remi, provided a model for legitimising kingship that was admired across Europe. And the grandeur of Westminster’s architecture had to ensure that it was also an appropriate setting, comparable with its French neighbours”.\n\nThe Westminster Abbey that Henry III demolished was in the Norman style with rounded, semi circular arches. The style now in fashion has been given the label, “Early English Gothic” having thin pointed arches. By the time of Henry VII, the “Perpendicular Gothic style” was the new fashion. It was dominated by spectacular fan vaulted ceilings with perpendicular windows, a design that was dominated by numerous vertical and horizontal lines.\n\nEssential information"
