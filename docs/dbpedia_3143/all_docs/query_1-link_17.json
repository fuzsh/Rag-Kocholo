        "text": "Why Pre-K through 8th?\n\nEducation at Westminster School is innovative, carefully structured and child centered. Westminster values the wide range of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences that its children, parents, faculty and staff bring to our school. Westminster School is an independent, coeducational, non-sectarian day school. Westminster teachers encourage children to ask questions, to challenge themselves and to be creative within the boundaries of a caring and accepting community. They provide children with support and encourage kindness and cooperation. Our children are full of energy, hope, laughter and promise. Academic and social development are important here. With a 10:1 student-teacher ratio, our faculty nurtures students to gain a sense of self, purpose and belonging.\n\nAt Westminster, we treat them older than they are, to keep them younger than they are.\n\nBy focusing on the elementary school child, our teachers are able to respect a more natural time frame for learning. Our children are not rushed to grow up. Comfortable in the smaller, home-like environment of Westminster, our students have ample time to grow, learn, make mistakes, recover and try new things within a loving, accepting atmosphere. Both in good times and in bad, they are buoyed by the support and friendship of a community specifically designed, created and focused, not on a high school, but on children like yours."
