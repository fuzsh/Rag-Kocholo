        "text": "Offering a large and diverse program in an intimate, small-school setting, Westminster is a community where people know, understand and care about each other. Students balance a rigorous academic schedule which includes college-preparatory, honors and 23 AP offerings with broad and deep athletic, artistic and extracurricular programs. In addition to the outstanding involvement to which students eagerly commit themselves, family-style meals, student-led assembly and chapel, and numerous opportunities for leadership and teamwork instill a strong sense of character. Virtute et Numine (By Grit and Grace).\n\nSummary: From the small stage to the big screen, from the school playing field to the professional leagues, Westminster artists and athletes excel beyond the classroom. Westminster alumni consistently go on to create and perform in college, many leading teams and organizations. Alumni are staring in television and movies, playing D1 and professional sports.\n\nArts Department Director: David Chrzanowski\n\nAthletics Department Director: Timothy Joncas\n\nArts\n\nActing\n\nArchitecture\n\nArt History\n\nChoreography\n\nDance\n\nDebate\n\nDesign\n\nDirecting\n\nDrama\n\nDrawing\n\nLighting Design\n\nPainting\n\nPhotography\n\nPortfolio\n\nSculpture\n\nStagecraft\n\nStudio Art\n\nTextiles\n\nTheater Arts\n\nTheater Design\n\nModern Dance\n\nInterscholastic Sports\n\nBaseball\n\nBasketball\n\nCross Country Running\n\nDiving\n\nField Hockey\n\nGolf\n\nIce Hockey\n\nLacrosse\n\nSoccer\n\nSoftball\n\nSquash\n\nSwimming\n\nTennis\n\nTrack and Field\n\nWater Polo\n\nRecreational Sports\n\nAerobics\n\nBowling\n\nCanoeing\n\nCross Country Running\n\nEquestrian\n\nGolf\n\nHiking\n\nIce Hockey\n\nKayaking\n\nMartial Arts\n\nMountain Biking\n\nPaddle Tennis\n\nSnowboarding\n\nTable Tennis\n\nWeight Lifting\n\nSummary: The College Counseling Office is staffed by a team of dedicated and experienced counselors, who are supported by an actively involved faculty.
