        "text": "Welcome to the fascinating history of King’s! Our school has a distinguished past that stretches back beyond King Henry VIII into the Middle Ages. Historical researchers will find many items of interest in this section of the website, which tells our story up to and including the Second World War. The school originated as part of the medieval Abbey of St Peter’s, it was re-founded by Henry VIII in 1541 and has links with the 17th century Archbishop Laud. The school then emerged as one of the country’s leading educational establishments under its 18th century headmasters, Maurice Wheeler and Thomas Stock."
