        "text": "Westminster School, in Simsbury, Connecticut, enjoys a reputation as one of the finest college-preparatory schools, and certainly one of the very top small boarding schools, in the country. The challenging academic program, grounded in the liberal arts tradition, prepares boys and girls in grades 9-12 and postgraduate for academic success and the rigors of college while cultivating in them a love of learning that becomes a lifelong habit.\n\nWestminster School is a diverse, close-knit community of 95 faculty and 425 students (75% boarding, 25% day students) from across the country and around the world. Over one-third of the students receive financial aid from the $6.2 million awarded each year.\n\nWestminster School, on its 200-acre north-central Connecticut campus, is a place where scholarship, citizenship, sportsmanship and leadership thrive. Set in a small New England town north of Hartford, Westminster is walking distance from Simsbury's vibrant town center, is convenient to both New York City and Boston, and is just twenty minutes from Bradley International Airport.\n\nSince its founding in 1888, Westminster School has been committed to a challenging, college-preparatory experience. Our core values — community, character, balance, involvement — and our commitment to excellence are the lifeblood of the School. Our motto — virtute et numine – by grit and grace — defines and distinguishes the experience, our community and our alumni."
