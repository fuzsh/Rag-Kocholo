        "text": "Westminster is a coeducational Christian, independent day school for grades pre-first through 12, committed to creating an educational experience where bright, curious, motivated students who are nurtured by challenge can grow into leaders of conscience.\n\nThe School was founded in 1951 guided by a mission to prepare students for college and for life. With a current enrollment of approximately 1,890 students in grades Pre-First through Twelfth, Westminster fulfills its mission through a dynamic curriculum that engages children across the key dimensions of their growth—academic, physical, and spiritual.\n\nOur students are constantly raising the bar. Curious by nature and nurtured by challenge, Westminster students inspire us to continue growing as one of the nation’s leading independent schools. In turn, we give them the support and encouragement they need to pursue their passions and reach their highest potential. That’s the Wildcat Way."
