        "text": "King Henry VIII College, Cyberjaya is the first overseas school built by the Christ College of Brecon, a historic academic institution that was founded nearly 500 years ago in 1541. This school is a joint venture between Christ College located in Brecon, Wales, and the Seri Mutiara Group of Malaysia, and the campus in the Cyberjaya is their effort together.\n\nBritish International School in Cyberjaya\n\nKing Henry VIII College follows a motto ‘they achieve because they believe they can’. The school strongly believes that a successful education means the transfer of skills and qualifications and preparing young children to face the challenges of today’s world. Students are given the opportunity to explore their talents and be a part of a supportive community.\n\nThe College has high expectations of their students, with an eye always on recognising their achievements, and rewarding their improvements. The renown international school furthermore expects their students to go on to internationally competitive university courses of the students’ choosing, either with Christ College Brecon, other universities in the UK, or anywhere else in the world where the expected course is being offered.\n\nThe school strongly values individuality, initiative and leadership and harps on the goodness of teamwork. The school community is formed by students, parents and teachers who all work together for the betterment of students. The school administration is active in exhorting their pupils to try to the utmost of their respective abilities, proffering specialist learning support and professional guidance whenever applicable, to address the specific needs the kids are facing.\n\nKing Henry VIII College offers the British curriculum to students in the preschool, primary, middle school and secondary levels. At the Primary School level which comprises from Nursery to Year 6 age groups, the students get to utilise the purpose built and fully equipped facilities, while actively participating in the curriculum which is closely tied to the UK Primary National Curriculum, but with creative and thematic shifts that have been more localised.\n\nThe majority of the teachers will be from the UK, with significant representation from their sister school in Brecon. The compulsory Malaysian subjects will be taught by fully qualified local teachers.\n\nUK National Curriculum in Selangor, Malaysia\n\nMeanwhile, the Senior School is divided into Key Stage 3 (involving Year 7 to Year 9) and Key Stage 4 (made up of Year 10 and Year 11 students). Key Stage 3 is a modified variant of the UK National Curriculum at that stage, which involved specific learning including, linguistics, maths, science, technology, as well as a variety of social, physical, aesthetic, and creative slants which are tied to the humanities.\n\nThe upper section of Years 10 and 11 will be mostly focused on the Cambridge Assessment International Education (or IGCSEs), whereby that batch of students will be sitting for the Cambridge International Examinations which is the internationally recognised end for Year 11 students.\n\nThe school houses excellent facilities for learning, sports, performance and personal development. The school in Cyberjaya offers boarding facilities. From libraries, computer facilities, cafe, school shop, to a 600-seater auditorium, drama and music rehearsal spaces, indoor swimming pool, sports hall, squash court and fitness centre, the school offers everything required for overall development of a child. Students get an opportunity to pursue their talent in arts, sports or music."
