        "text": "Founded in 1888, Westminster School has a long history as one of America’s finest college preparatory schools. This reputation rests on a foundation of excellence, beginning with our academic program, including offerings in the arts, and extending to our robust athletics program, as well as the many community service and extracurricular offerings.\n\nAs Westminster’s ninth head of school, I bring with me a complete commitment to the boarding school experience. In my previous role as assistant head of school at The Governor’s Academy, I was a teacher, coach, advisor and dorm parent. I also served in a variety of leadership positions including chair of the English department, academic dean and interim director of advancement. Most importantly, though, I was present in the lives of students, and it is that shared community that draws me to Westminster.\n\nI am excited to partner with the entire Westminster family — our students, faculty, alumni, staff, current and past parents and prospective students and parents — to continue the commitment to excellence. This school encourages students to flourish. They are known here and have adults and peers in their lives every day who are cheering them on, pushing, prodding, supporting, and encouraging them to engage in a myriad of opportunities on campus and beyond. We greet one another on the pathways, we hold doors, and we practice being our most generous selves every day.\n\nThe shared dedication to the people who comprise our school community defines us. We are a sensitive, caring, and nurturing community. We encourage young people to take risks and, in the process, to grow. At Westminster, we aspire to an extraordinarily ambitious commitment to education. I can’t think of a better setting for a student to pursue a passion for living a meaningful and rewarding life — becoming their best selves.\n\nWe hope you will consider a visit to our campus so that we can greet you in person and share with you more about Westminster School.\n\nElaine White\n\nHead of School"
