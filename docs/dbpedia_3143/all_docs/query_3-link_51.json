        "text": "IN respect of Westminster Abbey, I have for 50 years had a curious perspective. It dates from the year 1943, at which time it was thought desirable for Westminster Abbey to be patrolled during the hours of darkness by men who in one way or another were associated with art and architecture.\n\nIt was expected of us that we would show up at nightfall and stay until sunrise. We received a small dinner allowance, which most often we spent somewhere on Charlotte Street on anonymous chopped meats and a thimbleful of even more anonymous wine. On quiet nights, we had the use of iron bedsteads and rudimentary bedclothes in a dormitory that in normal times was part of Westminster School. When trouble was not expected, we roamed, we talked, we read, and we ruminated. As month followed month, we even dared to think about \"after the war.\"\n\nSpecific duties were never laid down, but it was assumed that we could find our way around the abbey. As a member of that bizarre but dedicated body of men, I blessed the turn of events by which, during our period of service, all nights were quiet and the air-raid alarm was never activated. Had this not been so, the chances of our being able to distinguish ourselves were not bright. Though awed by our putative role in the defense of the great building, we were untried, untrained, unled, and unequipped. The idea that a gang of esthetes could double as paraprofessional firefighters did us too much honor.\n\nMeanwhile, we were not merely privileged, but enjoined and expected to explore the abbey in ways that are normally forbidden. On long summer evenings, we had the run of the enormous building, and we came to understand why Daniel Webster, the foremost American orator of his day, should have burst into tears when he first crossed the threshold of the abbey.\n\nI remember especially a first visit at twilight to the broad gallery from which one can look down, and up, and across. For the licensed intruder, this was a moment -- hardly rivaled since -- of pure, intense, and exalted astonishment.\n\nSometimes, admittedly, the objects of that astonishment had their comical aspect and were not to be found in the guidebooks. At one point in the gallery, and invisible from the nave below, was a series of enigmatic constructions -- part wood, part canvas -- as to whose function we were free to speculate. They were large, but portable -- or, as could equally well be said, portable but large. They were a mode neither of transport nor of storage.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
