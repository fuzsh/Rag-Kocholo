        "text": "In 2016, as Christ College Brecon commemorated the 475th Anniversary of its founding, the school signed an agreement with DBH Holdings of Malaysia to set up its first international school.\n\nKing Henry VIII College is a fully-fledged sister school to Christ College Brecon, and replicates its structure, values, and ethos. Christ College was founded by King Henry VIII in 1541 by Royal Charter, and is a co-educational independent day and boarding school set in the Brecon Beacons National Park,\n\nKing Henry VIII College is located in the modern, global tech hub of Cyberjaya - a rapidly-developing planned township, mid-way between Kuala Lumpur City Centre and KL International Airport. Kuala Lumpur is the capital city of Malaysia, with an estimated population of 1.7 million.\n\nKH8 aims to provide an outstanding education based on traditional values of tolerance and mutual respect, supported by sector-leading boarding and pastoral care, outstanding teaching, and a wide range of extra-curricular opportunities.\n\nThe academic offer at KH8 is of British inspiration, modelled on that at Christ College, with a broad, modern subject selection. Students will sit Cambridge International IGCSEâs and AS/A levels, preparing them to go on to study at top universities world-wide."
