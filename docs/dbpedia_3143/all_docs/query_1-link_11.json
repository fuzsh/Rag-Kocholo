        "text": "Visionary from the outset\n\nPlanning for Westminster began in the late 1950s when demand for boarding at Methodist boys' schools in Adelaide was estimated to outgrow available places. In 1957, land in the south-western suburb of Marion was purchased and funds continued to be raised over the subsequent years. On 19 June 1960 the Foundation Stone was laid, marking the construction of the first buildings at Westminster.\n\nThe School opened on 7 February 1961 with a student body of 143 boys: 86 in Years 1 through 7 and 57 in Year 8, under the leadership of Headmaster Douglas Forder. The 200 Block was used as the main bank of classrooms that could be opened up into a multi-purpose assembly hall. For the first year, the 28 boarders lived off-campus at Shaftesbury House in the City of Adelaide with priority given to building a boarding house in the School grounds, which opened in 1962. In the initial phase of construction, an oval was also prepared, the Headmaster’s residence and sports change rooms were built and many trees and shrubs were planted.\n\nAfter 17 years as a boys’ school, coeducation was introduced in 1978 across all year levels, requiring the first accommodation changes to be made to Westminster's infrastructure. In 1993, girls commenced boarding by taking up residence in self-contained home units at the southern end of our School grounds. Westminster has since steadily grown as a leading coeducational institution, offering an extensive curriculum that encourages all students to achieve more than they thought possible.\n\nToday, with around 1,350 students (from Reception to Year 12), Westminster School has grown to a 23-hectare (57 acre) campus in Marion with dedicated areas for our Early Learning Centre, Junior Primary (Reception to Year 2), Middle and Upper Primary (Years 3 to 6) and Senior School (Years 7 to 12).\n\nIt was vision, purpose, courage and conviction that underpinned the remarkable achievements of our Founders and all who played a part to breathe life into Westminster. From the outset, our Founders’ commitment and purpose gave the School its strong sense of community. Over the past six decades, our extraordinary community is a key reason why Westminster has become the school of choice for many families."
