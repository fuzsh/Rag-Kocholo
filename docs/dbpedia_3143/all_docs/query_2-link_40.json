He was determined to be a great king, looked up to by everyone. He showed this in lots of ways: his grand portraits, his keenness for French wars and his behaviour towards his court and to other kings.\n\nHe also showed it in his control of every detail of his daily life. One measure of greatness at that time was the number of people that surrounded you, the more people, the more important you were. When Henry stayed at Hampton Court he was attended by nearly 1,000 people.\n\nControlling this number of people was quite a job and in 1526, while he was staying at another of his palaces, at Eltham, a strict and detailed set of rules was drawn up by his closest advisor Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. Use this lesson to find out about Henry VIII’s rules at court and how he controlled the way the people who surrounded him behaved.\n\nTasks\n\nBackground\n\nHenry’s father Henry VII was always careful with money and his court was not famous for its show of wealth. Henry VIII wanted to change all that. When he met one of his rivals, King Francis I of France, just outside Calais in 1520, a complete town of tents and timber was built for the meeting. Yards of velvet, satin and cloth of gold were sent to decorate the temporary palaces. It was called ‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’. Henry loved all this display: by the end of his reign he had amassed 55 palaces, 2,000 tapestries, 150 paintings and nearly 1,800 books. He also owned 41 gowns, 25 doublets (a doublet is a snug fitting buttoned jacket), 20 coats, eight cloaks, 15 capes and eight walking sticks.\n\nThe number of people waiting on the monarch was another sign of power. But even better than numbers was the quality of your servants. Kings and great barons had always taken young boys from their friends’ families into their households. It was a good education for leadership: you learnt how great men ran their affairs, how to behave, and made contacts, which would be useful all your life.\n\nHowever, to get on at Henry’s court young men had to have more than noble blood. Sixteenth century monarchs were expected to play, sing and compose music, read and discuss books, speak several languages as well as wrestle, play tennis, joust and hunt. Henry could do all these things superbly and his favourite ‘gentlemen of the privy chamber’ did as well. Not surprisingly, some of the older aristocrats looked with disdain at these clever young men – ‘minions’, or pretty boys, as they called them.\n\nHenry was intelligent enough to see that there was a point to all this. His father, Henry VII, had won the throne of England by fighting for it, winning the battle of Bosworth in 1485. Henry VII did not have a strong claim to the throne, so his son’s was not much better. In the 15th century kings and barons had been rivals for power. In fact, some barons were more powerful than the king himself. Henry VIII could see that putting a big distance between the monarchy and the barons, building up his magnificence, his separate position, made him more secure.\n\nEverything outlined in the extracts from the Ordinances of Eltham, therefore, built up this separateness and specialness. The elaborate rules about who was allowed to get near the king and when, the requirement to be well-behaved and for servants to be keep the King’s secrets, all contributed to this image-building.\n\nTeachers' notes\n\nThe first extract from the Ordinances of Eltham used in this lesson explains how Henry VIII started his day. The second extract details the duties of the King’s barber and the behaviour of Henry VIII’s servants. The final extract deals with how the people who worked in the Privy Chamber should act. All sources are provided with transcripts and simplified transcripts. Students can work through the questions individually or in pairs or groups reporting back to others in the class.\n\nThese extracts from the Ordinances of Eltham help to explain the strong sense of personal monarchy which will characterise any study of the Tudors. It was important to Henry VIII, as King, that he was surrounded by of high-born pages and esquires, a feature of earlier medieval courts. The account of his getting up in the morning stresses privacy and we learn who was allowed into the royal presence. The sources actually reveal who could touch the royal person, namely the barber. 200 years later, ritual at royal courts had changed to such an extent that Louis XIV of France created a whole royal lifestyle out of the ‘levee’ or the rise – a ceremony that took place every time the King or Queen woke up.\n\nThe rooms mentioned in these sources include the ‘pallett room’ where the King slept, a pallett was a bed. The ‘privy chamber’ was a private room next to the pallett room. The pages, esquires and gentlemen of the privy chamber who attended the king were the sons of rich and powerful lords and knights. Other members of the royal household were ordinary people namely servants, grooms, ushers and the barber. The King’s Chamber was a large room where he conducted his public life.\n\nAll documents are provided with transcripts. Students can work through the questions individually or in pairs and report back to the class.\n\nSources\n\nImage: E344/22 – Returns of the Valor Ecclesiasticus\n\nSources 1, 2 and 3 – SP 2/B – Transcript of the Ordinances of Eltham\n\nExternal links\n\nA brief history of Henry VIII\n\nhttps://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Henry-VIII/\n\nThe story of the Field of the cloth of Gold:\n\nhttps://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/the-field-of-the-cloth-of-gold-1520/\n\nHenry VIII’s break with Rome\n\nhttps://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/anglo-papal-relations-henry-viii-break-with-rome/\n\nConnections to curriculum\n\nKey stage 1\n\nSignificant people\n\nKey stage 3\n\nThe development of Church, state and society in Britain 1509-1745\n\nKey stage 4\n\nEdexcel GCSE: Henry VIII and his ministers, 1509–40\n\nOCR GCSE: Tudor government: growth of royal power under Henry VIII; the role of Parliament under Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.\n\nBack to top"
