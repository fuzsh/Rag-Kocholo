        "text": "A is the royal arms of Henry VII. He was so desperate to consolidate and raise the power and status of the Tudors that they appear 11 times inside the chapel and 5 times on the outside. Why was he so desperate? His claim to the throne was not strong, he did defeat Richard III in the Battle of Bosworth but he could only claim the throne via his mother, Margaret Beaufort which was not that strong. He had several relatives who had rival claims and some such as Lambert Simnel and Perkins Warbeck, who declared that they were the missing “Princes in the Tower”. Henry had married Elizabeth of York to unite both sides of the warring families in the Wars of the Roses to strengthen his claim and improve Tudor status by arranging a marriage between his son Arthur (note name of legendary king) and the Spanish princess, Catherine of Aragon. He was also tough on troublesome nobles and so plastering his arms all over this chapel would serve to enhance Tudor status.\n\n1 is the three Fleur-de-Lys which represents the crown of France. Edward III first used it in his claim to the throne and successive kings followed this claim thereafter. Henry V defeated the French and signed a treaty making his descendants kings of France. Even the very young Henry VI was crowned King of France and so the Tudors added this to their coat of arms.\n\n2 to the right of number 2 are the three leopards of England. Today they are popularly called the “Three Lions” when referring to national sports’ teams but originally they were leopards. One expert states that if the animal is standing on two back legs with its front legs raised it is referred to as a lion rampant but if it is on all four legs with its head turned towards the viewer, it is called a leopard.\n\n3 is a white greyhound from Henry VII’s mother Margaret of Beaufort. From her, the line goes all the way back to King Edward III.(1327-77)\n\n4 The red Welsh Dragon linking Henry VII back to his Welsh origins. He was born in Pembroke Castle on 28th January 1457 and originally called “Harri Tudur”.\n\n5 The Tudor Rose. A combination of the Lancastrian red rose and the Yorkist white rose ie Elizabeth of York’s family. Click here for more information about the Wars of the Roses.\n\n6 This was the heraldic symbol of the Beaufort family with Margaret of Beaufort being Henry’s mother. She played a huge part in Henry’s life, especially his route to the throne. She was never prepared to sit back passively and see her son overlooked for the throne of England and thus the portcullis symbol is regularly seen with anything Tudor.\n\nGothic architecture was devised to allow in as much light as possible and this chapel certainly meets that goal. It has twelve large windows on each side and one at each end. On the outside there are buttresses which allow for the walls to be high and carry these amazing windows without collapsing. These windows are perpendicular in style which means that the long vertical stonework called mullions dominate the windows and cross the horizontal stonework called transoms, at right angles.\n\nBelow; when you turn to the right, this magnificent scene awaits you. You can now appreciate the term, the biggest fan vault in the world!\n\n2. Who was responsible for creating the chapel at kings College, Cambridge?\n\nHenry VI founded the college in 1441and laid the first stone for the chapel on 25th July 1446, the Feast of St James the Apostle. It has gone on to be described as “one of the finest examples of Perpendicular Gothic English architecture” by John Saltmarsh, with the world’s largest fan vault. Henry was very devout and had a major role in the planning of the chapel. He also founded Eton college with Kings College only accepting students from Eton for the first 400 years of its existence. Initially, Henry had planned to cater for 12 students, the number of the apostles but this was soon revised to 70, the same number as the evangelists chosen by Jesus. During his reign, the Wars of the Roses broke out (1455) but Henry continued to finance the construction of his college and its chapel. In 1461, Henry was defeated and captured by the “Yorkists” but regained the throne only to lose it once more to the Yorkist, Edward IV. In 1471, Henry “mysteriously” died in the Tower of London no doubt on the orders of Edward but the foundations for the chapel had been laid and detailed instructions left for the chapel’s completion. Under Edward IV, little building was carried out but his successor, Richard III, tried to get construction underway again and at his death in 1485, five bays at the eastern end were at full height with an oak and lead roof and could now be used.\n\nWhen the first Tudor monarch, Henry VII acceded to the throne in 1485, completing the chapel was not high on his priority list and so little work was carried out. His priority was establish his rule and consolidates power. His claim to the throne was not strong and thus he had to deal with rival claimants, some of whom were imposters eg Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck. However, by 1506, on visiting the chapel, Henry decided to finance its completion. He was heavily influenced to do so by his powerful mother, Margaret Beaufort and by the notion that such a splendid building would enhance his status as king. This would also link him to Henry VI, who was now gaining a reputation for miracles although he never became a saint. In 1508, building began once more and in his will of 1509, Henry VII left sufficient finances to complete construction.\n\nUnder Henry VIII, the shell of the church was finished by 1512 with a full length roof which left him the fan vault to construct, the large windows to glaze and the beautiful wooden “Choir Screen” or “Rood Screen” to create. Henry VI had left instructions for one to be built and Henry VIII now built one in the early Renaissance style with his and Queen Anne Boleyn’s initials, for all to see between 1532-6. Gothic architecture is all about a high roof and large magnificent windows and Kings’ College chapel fits into that design with twelve large windows on each side and one at each end. With the exception of the more modern west window, all the windows were glazed by Flemish glaziers, the top craftsmen in Europe, between 1515-1531. Henry VIII loved creating beautiful architecture and this can be added to his impressive list. He had to have nothing but the best."
