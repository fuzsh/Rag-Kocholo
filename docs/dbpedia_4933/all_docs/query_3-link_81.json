Discussion regarding Joint Human Services Funding\n\nLimited Public Comment: None\n\n1. Health Department\n\na. Resolution to Authorize a Lease Agreement for the Leslie Health Center\n\nMr. Miller explained that the Resolution would authorize the renewal of a lease for a small clinical operation in Leslie. The Center has been located in this space since 1988. Mr. Miller also informed the Committee that the building is owned by Jim Byrum, husband of Diane Byrum.\n\nIn response to Comm. Severino, Mr. Neilsen stated that Mr. Byrum owned the property when Ms. Byrum was a County Commissioner. This fact was fully disclosed at the time.\n\nIn response to Comm. Schmidt, Mr. Miller stated there were 1,400 visits to the Leslie Clinic in 1998. This number does not include visits for immunizations, WIC or blood pressure checks. Information about the Clinic is available to the public. Comm. Schmidt requested additional information regarding the Clinic.\n\nComm. Stid explained that the Clinic also serves a large portion of Onondaga. The Clinic is a real benefit to the community.\n\nComm. Schmidt stated she is not pleased that a former County Commissioner's family is the landlord of property being leased to the County. Comm. Severino supported Comm. Schmidt's position. In response to Comm. Severino, Mr. Miller stated that Mr. Byrum purchased the property in 1988. He also stated the property manager has notified him that the property is on the market.\n\nComm. Smiley stated the Committee should take the market value of the property into consideration. A comparable market value should be provided to this Committee. Information should also be provided regarding the Stockbridge clinic.\n\nMOVED BY COMM. SCHMIDT, SUPPORTED BY COMM. SEVERINO, TO TABLE THIS MATTER UNTIL FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

Resolution to Amend and Extend the HUD Lead Abatement Grant Agreement with the Michigan Department of Community Health\n\nMs. Williams explained that the Resolution extends the Lead Abatement Grant Agreement. The overall funding for the grant will be increased by $17,777, from $615,000 to $182,777.\n\nMOVED BY COMM. SCHMIDT, SUPPORTED BY COMM. STID, TO APPROVE THE RESOLUTION TO AMEND AND EXTEND THE HUD LEAD ABATEMENT GRANT AGREEMENT WITH THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH.\n\nMOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.\n\nc. Resolution to Authorize an Amendment to the State of Michigan Agreement for Medicaid Eligibility Assistance Services\n\nMr. Miller explained that the principal strategy of the grant proposal is to develop a network of community based organizations that could help identify low income people and screen them for Medicaid eligibility. The State has advised the Health Department of some changes in their plans to automate the Medicaid application process. This change will eliminate the need for technical consultation. The Department will establish a standard package of computer hardware and software to be purchased through mini-grants. The funds made available will be used to support the mini-grants for an additional 20 community agencies and to purchase computer equipment and software within the Department.\n\n2\n\nIn response to Comm. Schmidt, Mr. Neilsen explained that the temporary positions which were previously authorized have not changed. The only change is the shift and emphasis away from the technical consultation grant. Mr. Miller also explained that the Department has created an Advisory Committee. That Committee is made up from people within the Department as well as from representatives from the FIA, Office on Aging and others. The Advisory Committee will consult with others to develop a list of agencies to apply for the mini-grants.\n\nIn response to Chairperson Smiley, Mr. Miller explained that the mini-grants will help several community-based organizations purchase Internet compatible computers. The grants will also provide training.\n\nMOVED BY COMM. STID, SUPPORTED BY COMM. SEVERINO, TO APPROVE THE RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE AN AMENDMENT TO THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AGREEMENT FOR MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY ASSISTANCE SERVICES. MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.\n\nd. Resolution to Amend the 4C Agreement with the Family Independence Agency\n\nMr. Sperber explained that the Resolution will authorize an amendment to the Community Coordinated Child Care Agreement (4C). The amendment would expand services to Eaton County FIA clients seeking employment as part of Project Zero. The FIA proposal would add $23,600 to the existing agreement for the period of April 1, 1999 through September 30, 1999. The additional money would fund a part-time Day Care Specialist in Eaton County. The grant fully pays for the position, mileage, supplies and any administration fees. The FIA has also expressed a willingness to continue this program into the next contract year.\n\nIn response to Comm. Schmidt, Mr. Sperber explained that the Specialist would be an Ingham County employee who would be assigned to work in Eaton County on specified days. He also informed Comm. Schmidt that this type of program has been very successful in other counties by removing the child care barriers to the clients' employment.\n\nIn response to Comm. Severino, Mr. Sperber explained that child care problems extend across income levels.\n\nComm. Czarnecki requested staff to provide a list of all services the County provides to neighboring counties.\n\nMOVED BY COMM. SCHMIDT, SUPPORTED BY COMM. STID, TO APPROVE THE RESOLUTION TO AMEND THE 4C AGREEMENT WITH THE FAMILY INDEPENDENCE AGENCY. MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.\n\nComm. Stid informed the Committee that on April 20, the Lifetime television station will present a program regarding the child care crisis in America.\n\n3\n\nChairperson Smiley thanked the Health Department staff for providing the above information.\n\ne. Joint Human Services Funding Between the County and the City of Lansing - Discussion\n\nChairperson Smiley stated there was a discussion during the past week with the Mayor and certain members of the City Council regarding joint human services funding. The City struggles with the same questions regarding human services agencies. She suggested an informal discussion regarding regionalization.\n\nComm. Stid stated her concern regarding the increasing number of funding requests from human services agencies.\n\nIn response to Comm. Severino, Mr. Ambrose explained that some City Council members are discussing the idea of reducing human services funding in regards to the rain fee issue. Comm. Severino expressed his concern that the County may be expected to pick up the slack if the City does make reductions in this area.\n\nComm. Czarnecki questioned the value of the discussion regarding joint funding. The County should first resolve its own issues as to which services the County should fund. Chairperson Smiley stated that sharing of information between the County and other municipalities would be to everyone's benefit. There was further discussion.\n\nChairperson Smiley requested Mr. Ambrose and Mr. Neilsen to pursue this discussion with the City. Comm. Stid supported Chairperson Smiley's request. Comm. Schmidt suggested that the discussions take place as soon as possible. Comm. Severino stated that it would be beneficial to engage in a dialogue with the City. Comm. Czarnecki stated his concern regarding what the County may be implying by holding this type of discussion.\n\n2. Controller\n\na. Review of IMMC Compliance with Indigent Care Contractual Requirements\n\nMr. Ambrose explained that an important concern during the sale of the hospital regarded what assurance the County government would have that the hospital would continue to provide indigent health care services in the same manner as the past. The sale Agreement sets forth a commitment on behalf of the new entity to continue to provide inpatient hospitalization services to the indigent. The Agreement attempts to answer the question of how the County will know if the new entity is continuing to provide indigent health care services.\n\nThe parties to the Agreement have an interest to determine benchmarks for measurement. The benchmarks should be easy to attain and easy to measure. The parties to the Agreement agreed to use licensed beds to identify in the future if the indigent health care services were provided in\n\n4\n\nproportion to the market share enjoyed by the entity. The parties also agreed to use the amount classified in the hospital's financial statements as charity care and uncompensated care/bad debts.\n\nThe County collects, on an annual basis, the audited financial statements to the area hospitals as well as the Medicaid/Medicare costs reports. Information is also collected from the State regarding the number of licensed beds.\n\nThe purpose of tonight's discussions is to determine if Ingham Regional Medical Center (IRMC) is meeting its contractual obligation as identified in the Agreement.\n\nMr. Labke stated that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Kellogg grants have also focused attention on this community to define indigent care and how to respond to that issue. Mr. Litos and the IRMC Board of Trustees met last month and held a lengthy discussion regarding this issue.\n\nIRMC believes it is living up to the terms of the Agreement. Due to the debate regarding this issue, IRMC also believes it is time to revisit the definition with the County and to determine if there is a better indicator. Licensed beds are clearly not a good indicator. The parties to the Agreement do agree in the areas of net revenue and adjusted patient days. The parties are willing to consider these parameters.\n\nIn response to Comm. Czarnecki, Mr. Ambrose explained that the issue is now complicated due to the community discussion regarding indigent care. The Agreement clearly states that IRMC will continue to include the provision of necessary health services to those residents of the County who are unable to pay fully for such care. The Agreement also states that those services will continue to be provided in proportion to its market share. IRMC will not be considered to have provided these services in proportion to market share if care provided is the same or greater than the proportion of their number of licensed beds to the total licensed beds in the area. According to the data, IRMC has not yet met the test. The question is whether this is a fair indicator since the face of health care has changed.\n\nIn response to Comm. Severino, Mr. Ambrose stated that whether or not IRMC is in breach of the Agreement depends on the BOC. The Agreement does not provide a mechanism which redresses this issue. Comm. Severino stated his concern regarding the staff spending a great deal of time to help IRMC develop a solution to this situation. Mr. Labke stated the bigger issue is to develop a common definition of indigent care.\n\nChairperson Smiley stated a common definition should be reached before the County takes any further action on this matter.\n\nComm. Czarnecki stated that he supports Comm. Severino's position. The Agreement clearly defines the term \"indigent care.\" Mr. Ambrose agreed. However, Sparrow wants a broader definition of \"indigent care\". In response to Comm. Schmidt, Mr. Ambrose explained that the County cannot measure proportion without the cooperation of both entities.\n\n5\n\nComm. Schmidt stated that IRMC has been a very charitable entity and it is also sensitive to the community. In response to Comm. Schmidt, Mr. Ambrose stated that he believes there are legitimate reasons to discuss indicators other than licensed beds. However, licensed beds are the specified indicator in the Agreement. At the present time, IRMC is not meeting the standard.\n\nChairperson Pratt explained his concern regarding mediation in this matter. The County's attorney should review the options with this Committee. Comm. Czarnecki stated that the attorney should address this Committee in a confidential meeting. He also appreciates IRMC's efforts to participate in the Ingham Health Plan.\n\nMr. Ambrose stated that he has already referred this matter to corporate council. He will continue discussions with the two health systems to develop a consensus regarding measuring proportionate share. Comm. Czarnecki stated that he would like the County to extract itself from this portion of the Agreement as this is a no win situation.\n\nMr. Miller explained that the people who are currently enrolled in the Ingham Health Plan are generally eligible for free hospital care or hospital care at a substantially reduced cost at Sparrow or IRMC. The Health Department hopes the indigent care policies will be similar in the future. The Department also hopes that the similar policies could be dovetailed into the eligibility criteria for the Plan. Chairperson Smiley stated that the Department's hopes are the ultimate goals of the County.\n\nThis discussion will continue when further information is available.\n\nb. Resolution Authorizing Adjustments to the 1999 Ingham County Budget\n\nMOVED BY COMM. STID, SUPPORTED BY COMM. SEVERINO, TO APPROVE THE RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE 1999 INGHAM COUNTY BUDGET. MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY. MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.\n\nIn response to Comm. Schmidt, Mr. Ambrose explained that, by law, hospitals cannot refuse to provide medical services to someone in need. The law provides a standard for providing immediate urgent care when required. There was further discussion.\n\nAnnouncements: None\n\nPublic Comment: None\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 9:05 p.m.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nDebra Neff\n\n6\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: Human Services Committee\n\nAdministrative Services/Personnel Committee\n\nFinance Committee\n\nFROM: Bruce Bragg\n\nDATE: April 23, 1999\n\nSUBJECT: Recommendation to Amend the Project Respect Agreement\n\nThis is a recommendation to authorize an amendment to the Project Respect Agreement with the City of Lansing.\n\nThe City of Lansing is the recipient of a grant agreement from the Michigan Family Independence Agency to implement an alternative program to school suspension. The City has subcontracted with Ingham County to implement the program through Willow Plaza Services. The Program intervenes with the lives of at-risk Otto Middle School girls. These young women are identified by school personnel as being at-risk of having problems with the law, with school, with families and with their own health.\n\nThe Program provides the girls with health services and information, a strong support system at school, mentoring opportunities with women in the community and incentives to achieve academically. The goal is to increase healthy behaviors, reduce inappropriate behavior, increase school performance and enhance family communication.\n\nWillow Plaza has identified certain needs that were not able to be addressed within the budget of the existing agreement. The City of Lansing was able to obtain some additional funding and is offering to amend the Project Respect agreement to add $4,600. The funds will be used to enhance the operational budget, by providing resources to support such things as: local field trips, mentoring activities, program supplies and job shadowing activities.\n\nNo additional Ingham County funds are required by this amendment. I recommend that the Board of Commissioners adopt the attached resolution and authorize the amendment.\n\nAttachment\n\ncc: Debra Brinson w/attachment\n\nBruce Miller w/attachment\n\nJohn Jacobs w/attachment\n\nDarnell Earley w/attachment\n\nIntroduced by the Human Services, Administrative Services/Personnel and Finance Committees of the:\n\nINGHAM COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS\n\nRESOLUTION TO AMEND THE PROJECT RESPECT CONTRACT WITH THE CITY OF LANSING\n\nWHEREAS, the City of Lansing is the recipient of a grant from the Michigan Family Independence Agency to implement a school suspension alternative program; and\n\nWHEREAS, the City has subcontracted with Ingham County to implement Project Respect through Willow Plaza Services; and\n\nWHEREAS, Willow Plaza has identified certain needs and the City has advised that additional funds are available to enhance the operational budget to support such as: local field trips, mentoring activities, program supplies and job shadowing activities; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Health Officer has recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize an amendment to the Project Respect agreement to incorporate the additional funding.\n\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, the Ingham County Board of Commissioners authorizes an amendment to the Project Respect Agreement with the City of Lansing, originally authorized in Resolution 98-278 as an alternative program to school suspension.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the City of Lansing's contribution to the agreement shall be increased by up to $4,600 to provide for such operational expenses as, local field trips, mentoring activities, program supplies and job shadowing activities.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Controller is authorized to adjust the Health Department's 1999 budget to implement the amendment.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board Chairperson is authorized to sign the amendment after review by the County Attorney.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: Human Services Committee\n\nFinance Committee\n\nFROM: Bruce Bragg\n\nDATE: April 26, 1999\n\nSUBJECT: Recommendation to Authorize a Contract for a Population Based Survey\n\nThis is a recommendation to authorize a contract with Information Transfer Systems, Inc. (ITS) to conduct a population based community survey of health related behaviors. The survey is part of the Health Department's work to document the health related behaviors of County residents and to track changes over time. Additionally, the survey results will be used to assist with the evaluations required for Johnson Foundation and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation grants. The survey will be 50% funded by Ingham County and 50% funded by the two grants. The funds to complete the survey are included in the Health Department's 1999 budget in the activities of the two grants and in the Community Health Assessment Unit.\n\nITS will conduct the survey in September and October. At least 1,540 responses are required. The survey data and report will be presented to the Health Department prior to December 31, 1999.\n\nThe Purchasing and Properties Department issued a Request for Proposals in early March, 1999. There were three responses. One was not a complete response. Both ITS and the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research (IPPSR) at Michigan State University submitted proposals that were satisfactory. The IPPSR proposal was for $66,720. The ITS proposal was for $48,778. Staff at the Health Department have evaluated the proposals and checked references. It is our recommendation that the lowest cost proposal be accepted.\n\nThe survey will document the major health related behaviors among Ingham County residents, and residents of the Capital Area. For Ingham County residents, information will allow analysis on the basis of income, race/ethnicity, education, age and gender. Results will document such conditions and behaviors as:\n\naccess to health care and to dental care\n\nperceptions, attitudes and beliefs of the status of the environment and factors that influence it\n\nInformation about rates of\n\ntobacco use\n\nalcohol abuse\n\ndiet and physical activity\n\nemotional well being\n\nI recommend that the Board of Commissioners adopt the attached resolution and authorize the agreement with ITS to conduct the population based community survey.\n\nAttachment\n\ncc: Bob Glandon w/attachment\n\nJohn Jacobs w/attachment\n\nMarcus Cheatham w/attachment\n\nIntroduced by the Human Services and Finance Committees of the:\n\nINGHAM COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS\n\nRESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE A CONTRACT TO CONDUCT A POPULATION BASED COMMUNITY SURVEY\n\nWHEREAS, the Health Department periodically conducts population based community surveys to document health related behaviors, and the last such survey was conducted in 1994; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant and the W.K.
