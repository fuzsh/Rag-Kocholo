        "text": "Michigan State University continues to tackle difficult situations on campus after a racially charged survey was sent to students, sparking an outcry on campus.\n\nThe survey was sent to a group of students earlier in the week by a professor in the Department of Advertising and Public Relations. The survey included several racially insensitive phrases and words that several members of the community reacted to during the week.\n\n“It was a very difficult week obviously last week for Michigan State University,” President Sam Stanley said after the meeting Friday. “How that happened, it’s still not completely clear I think. We are still trying to understand how that happened, how it was released and what took place there.”\n\nThe survey was created by Saleem Alhabash, an associate professor with a doctorate degree in the College of Communications Arts and Sciences. He said the survey was posted online for students within his college — not the entire university — to see and sign up to be a participant. Alhabash said the survey and screenshots of the text have since been widely shared. The professor said he had no intentions of creating such an intense situation on campus; his goal was to conduct an experiment to see what was considered insensitive.\n\n“It wasn’t for me as a scientist to judge whether they were OK to put or not. We have selected them because we knew they were offensive. This, of course, has led to a wide range of emotions and impact,” he said. “There was no intention to do that.”\n\nSamantha Turner, president of the MSU-student group Black Girls Unite, said she did not directly take the survey nor was she given access to it, but she did come in contact with the language.\n\n“It makes me feel very unsafe as a black woman on campus,” Turner said. “Why did he think it was acceptable to put those type of slurs and language inside a survey? It was very inappropriate to me and very triggering for me.”\n\nAlhabash said the survey was done from a place of science and he wanted to gather data for a larger project.\n\n“In this particular instance, my researcher individual who has been trained as an experimentalist was looking to find numbers in order to show that what I think I see in these messages is in fact what others see in these messages,” he said.\n\nTurner said she wants to see the university act and hold people accountable for the incident. She said feeling unsafe on campus is not new to her and she wants to see Michigan State change.\n\n“This type of language is language that we hear and experience every day so we don’t need a reminder on campus every day from a professor,” Turner said. “I think the university needs to acknowledge what this is and just tell the people here that, that is not acceptable and we will not have this.”\n\nStanley said an investigation is ongoing into the incident and he’s not ready to talk about discipline for the professor. As for the students on campus who were impacted by the survey, Stanley said, he understands their feelings and is ready to start changing things on campus.\n\n“I think you see fundamentally a distrust in the administration and our communication. So, I think we have more work to do,” Stanley said. “It’s less about talk and more about actions and I think we want to make sure that these actions are intentional.”\n\nA search for a chief diversity officer will begin, Stanley said, to help coordinate some changes on campus.\n\nAlhabash said he did not intend for the survey to hurt people and is remorseful for the negative impact.\n\n“It has been the most painful to experience, my guilt, that something that I had done with good intentions to expose racist and hateful speech online has created so much trauma,” he said.\n\nOther actions taken by the Board of Trustees\n\nProvost Search\n\nThe appointment of Teresa Sullivan as interim provost of Michigan State University was approved by the board, replacing June Youatt who resigned from the position in September. Youatt resigned following a scathing report from the U.S. Department of Education looking into how Michigan State handled the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal and Nassar’s boss, William Strample. The university was slapped with a $4.5 million fine by the Department of Education.\n\nStanley said a new search is underway for a permanent provost and the search will be open, unlike the most recent presidential search. A search committee is in the process of being created and it will include a “diverse” group of people, Stanley said. Tenured professors, tenured-track professors, adjunct professors, a post-doctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students as well as a few deans and distinguished professors are expected to be included in the search committee, Stanley said.\n\nStanley said having an open search for the next provost is something “that the campus really wanted.” He stressed, though, the importance of the Spartan community getting on board.\n\n“It’s going to be very important that campus be very welcoming to people who come,” he said.\n\nBoard Chairwoman Dianne Byrum said it’s too early in the process to say what qualities the board is seeking in a provost. She said the search committee and President Stanley will be making the biggest decisions.\n\n“In terms of the process, the search committee will recommend finalists to the president, the president will identify the provost-elect at that point and the board’s responsibility will be to actually vote that provost into office,” Byrum said.\n\nDoug Meijer Medical Innovation Building\n\nThe trustees approved a long-term lease space in Grand Rapids that will house the Grand Rapids Innovation Park after a $19.5 million gift from Doug Meijer and his family. The board also approved the naming of the building as the Doug Meijer Medical Innovation Building. Groundbreaking is scheduled to take place Nov. 18, 2019.\n\n“This is the first gift from the Meijer family and it is going to be substantial for the community going forward,” Byrum said.\n\nNewly appointed Executive Vice President for Health Sciences Norman Beauchamp will oversee part of the new project in Grand Rapids. Beauchamp said the facility will bring bio-engineers, industry partners, venture capitalists and researchers together to then productize the findings and make it available to people where they live. Medicine needs to be more accessible, affordable, and patient and family centered, Beauchamp said.\n\n“This new building we are constructing, is all about how do you take the very best in care and bring it to patients faster. It’ll be catalyst for bringing the best available care sooner,” Beauchamp said. “What this will allow is West Michigan to be the epicenter for the transformation of health care.”\n\nThe building is expected to open in the Fall of 2022."
