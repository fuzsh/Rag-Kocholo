        "text": "Michigan State University announced the timeline in the search for a new president on Tuesday.\n\nBoard of Trustees members Dianne Byrum and Melanie Foster will lead the search for the permanent replacement for Lou Anna Simon, who resigned during the fallout of the Larry Nassar scandal.\n\nUniversity of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan has also been hired to assist MSU's board with the hunt for a new leader.\n\n“Finding the right president for Michigan State and completing the search in accord with this newly established timeline are critical steps for MSU and its future,” said Sullivan, retiring president of the University of Virginia and a MSU alumna. “I look forward to working with the Board of Trustees and stakeholders in the Spartan community as they seek to attract a great leader for the next chapter in the life of Michigan State University.”\n\nThe presidential search timeline includes:\n\nJuly-October 2018: Host listening sessions with stakeholders\n\nJuly 2018: Issue request for proposals from presidential search firms\n\nAugust 2018: Form the search committee\n\nSeptember 2018: Conduct search firm interviews and make a selection\n\nOctober 2018: Finalize the position profile and make public\n\nNovember 2018-January 2019: Identify candidates and conduct initial interviews\n\nFebruary-May 2019: Host finalist interviews with the Board of Trustees\n\nJune 2019: Announce the selection of the new MSU president\n\nThe public can follow the search as it progresses at www.msu.edu/presidentialsearch\n\nCurrently, MSU is led by Interim President John Engler, who has recently faced backlash for a series of emails that criticized lawyers who represent Nassar's sexual assault victims, and said one victim was probably getting a \"kickback\" from her attorney."
