        "text": "Pop quiz: Why did 120 students pack into a dormitory lounge here at Michigan State University the other night?\n\nA) To watch NBC's hit political drama, ''West Wing.''\n\nB) To show support for Dianne Byrum, the Democratic candidate for the House in Michigan's tight Eighth District race.\n\nC) To see whether the comedian Al Franken was good enough, smart enough, and persuasive enough to get them to vote for Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday.\n\nAnswer: All of the above.\n\nMs. Byrum, a hardware store owner turned state representative who graduated from Michigan State in 1974, answered questions during the commercials, as her opponent's advertisements flashed on the muted large-screen television behind her. When Mr. Franken walked in, backpack slung over his shoulder, the students decided to keep the sound down through the show's finale, preferring the live show.\n\n''This election is going to be determined by the 'don't knows,' '' said Mr. Franken, who played Stuart Smalley on Saturday Night Live. Reeling off purported new poll results, Mr. Franken, who has visited college campuses in several battleground states on behalf of Mr. Gore, said 12 percent of undecided voters also did not know their sex.\n\nOf those, ''only 12 percent said they would know soon, 67 percent said they would never know, 19 percent said they don't know when they will know,'' he deadpanned. ''What does this all mean? I don't know.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
