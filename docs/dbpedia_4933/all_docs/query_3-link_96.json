        "text": "A historic hardware store with a long history in downtown Pinckney is transitioning into a Byrum Ace Hardware.\n\nPinckney True Value Hardware will become \"a full-blown Ace\" with new merchandise coming in and store renovations expected to be completed this fall, said Tom Leister, who is the general manager of Byrum Ace Hardware's six locations.\n\nThe store at 114 W. Main Street was already owned by Jim Byrum Jr. and his father Jim Byrum.\n\nThe elder Jim Byrum, who is president of the Michigan Agri-Business Association, founded Byrum Ace Hardware stores with his wife, Dianne Byrum, chair of the Michigan State University Board of Trustees and a former state representative. They live in Onondaga in Ingham County.\n\nThe family purchased Pinckney True Value Hardware from previous owner Debbie Craig a few years ago. Craig still owns the building.\n\n\"It's a conversion to refresh the store and add inventory,\" Jim Byrum Sr. said. \"We'll be adding about 50% more inventory and new lines.\"\n\nByrum said he has a passion for small, local businesses.\n\n\"We firmly believe that local small businesses are what people are looking for these days,\" he said. \"They are a quick stop where you can come in and find what you need and be out the door faster than a big box store. Every location is managed by local people in the community, and we're a family-owned business who are pretty engaged in the area.\"\n\nHe said the store will begin ordering inventory through Ace Hardware instead of True Value as soon as next week.\n\nLeister said Ace Hardware's offerings \"are more robust than True Value.\"\n\nThe store is liquidating some brands that Ace Hardware stores do not carry.\n\n\"The focus here will be on what people expect from a hardware store, like plumbing, electrical, hardware, paint, nuts and bolts,\" Leister said. \"Pinckney also has a strong hunting and fishing desire, so we'll focus on that so we can be a one-stop shop for anything they need.\"\n\nHe said the store will also sell name-brand outdoor grills made by companies such as Weber and Traeger Grills, as well as outdoor power equipment made by companies such as DeWalt, Milwaukee Tools and Craftsman.\n\nInstead of selling True Value brand paint, the store will switch to a full line of Benjamin Moore paints.\n\nLeister said the new inventory should all have arrived by October.\n\n\"There will be some remodeling,\" he said. \"We're taking down some of the less than aesthetically pleasing things in the store, painting, putting up new fixtures so we can provide more merchandise and changing the layout of the store to make room for more.\"\n\nThe store will remain open during the transition.\n\n\"Over the next four weeks or so, if people want to come down and get great items, we'll have blowout sales to make room for the new merchandise,\" Leister said.\n\nLate Pinckney resident Lee Lavey opened Lavey Hardware store at the location roughly 100 years ago. Lavey passed away in 1985 at the age of 89.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Lavey established The Lavey Insurance Agency in a small office in the back of the hardware store, according to the agency's website. The insurance company remains owned and operated by the Lavey family, across the street at 125 W. Main Street.\n\nOver the decades, the hardware store changed hands several times.\n\nPrevious owner Debbie Craig revamped and reopened the store in 2014. It had been closed for a little more than a year, after past owner Renee MacRitchie failed to secure a purchase deal with former managers Mary Banister and Wendy Robertson.\n\nThe western portion of the building it occupies was Pinckney's old fire station.\n\nLast year, Byrum Ace Hardware bought an Ace Hardware store in Howell from the Grundy family. That location was founded by Seymour Grundy, 93, who retired. Grundy first opened an Ace Hardware store in the former Brighton mall in 1971 and moved the store to Howell in 1975.\n\nByrum Ace Hardware also owns stores in Leslie, Stockbridge, Holt and Charlotte.\n\nSupport our journalism and become a digital subscriber and download our app today.
