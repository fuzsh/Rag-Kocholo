        "text": "LANSING - The next Michigan State University Board of Trustees will be evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nFollowing Tuesday's election, Republican challenger Dan Kelly leads all candidates in the race for two seats on the board, according to unofficial election results. Incumbent trustee Dianne Byrum, a Democrat, finished in second place, trailing Kelly by about 15,000 votes.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Diann Woodard lost her bid for reelection, unofficial results show. She lags Byrum by more than 100,000 votes. Newcomer William Deary is running fourth, about 22,000 votes behind Woodard. None of the third-party challengers received more than 2.25% of the vote.\n\nWhile Kelly said it's difficult to unravel voters' motivations, he hoped his victory is an endorsement of his stance on tuition.\n\n\"I do believe we have to focus on whether we're keeping MSU affordable and accessible to Michigan residents,\" Kelly said.\n\nKelly works as a lawyer and lives in Clarkston with his wife and four children. He's served on several elected boards, including six years on the Oakland Community College Board of Trustees.\n\nByrum said endorsements from the Michigan Milk Producers Association and Michigan Farm Bureau helped to propel her to reelection.\n\n\"I really think that happened was the Trump vote,\" she said. \"You're seeing the votes coming out of rural Michigan.\"\n\nByrum is a partner at public relations firm Byrum & Fisk Advocacy Communications. She was first elected to the board in 2008. Ensuring MSU is accessible and affordable will remain her number one priority, she said.\n\nWoodard was reflective about her time on the board following Tuesday's result.\n\n\"I had an excellent opportunity and time at MSU,\" she said. \"Where else can a poor girl from Detroit rise to be a Board of Trustee member and get an opportunity to have an influence on the university she could barely afford to attend?\"\n\nWith Kelly and Byrum's wins, MSU's board will consist of four Democrats and four Republicans beginning next year. The current board is chaired by Democrat Joel Ferguson. Mitch Lyons, a Republican, currently serves as the board's vice chair.\n\nFerguson said he doesn't expect Kelly joining the board to change its dynamics significantly.\n\n\"We've found a way to put the university before any partisan politics, that will continue with (Kelly) coming in,\" Ferguson said.\n\nThe task of keeping tuition affordable as state funding for higher education ranks among the lowest nationally will continue to be an issue trustees grapple with, he added."
