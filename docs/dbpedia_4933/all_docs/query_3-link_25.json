John Engler speaks at a press conference at the Michigan State University Hannah Administration Building after he was named the interim president of MSU by the Board of Trustees on Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2018. (J. Scott Park | Mlive.com)\n\nThe Michigan State University Board of Trustees has been under heavy fire as the fallout continues over the Larry Nassar sex-abuse scandal. Calls for the eight, publicly-elected board members to step down have come from near and far, including students and faculty, state lawmakers, and a slew of newspaper editorial boards.\n\nAs more scrutiny has been leveled on the board for what many view as the university’s failure to effectively respond to the Nassar scandal, some readers have asked the question: Just who exactly are the eight members of the board, and what are their qualifications?\n\nHere’s a look at each of the members, who are elected to eight-year terms by a statewide vote.\n\nRelated: Despite calls for resignation, Michigan State's trustees say they're not going anywhere\n\nTrustee Brian Breslin speaks during an MSU Board of Trustees meeting at the Michigan State University Hannah Administration Building on Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2018.

Scott Park | Mlive.com)\n\nBrian Breslin\n\nBreslin, a Republican who serves as chair of the board, was elected in 2011. His term ends at the end of this year, and he announced last month – amid mounting scrutiny over the Nassar scandal – that he would not seek another term.\n\nRecently, he took a leave of absence from his job in Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration, where he served as manager of the governor’s appointments division. In a statement, Breslin said he was doing so to concentrate more on his work as a trustee.\n\nAt Friday's board meeting, he addressed the concerns students and faculty have voiced about the board, saying he that he believes \"what trust you don't have in us, what confidence you don't have in us, can be restored to this board and future boards.\"\n\nBreslin, who earned a bachelor’s degree in food systems economics and management from MSU in 1977, retired from retail giant Meijer in 2006, according to his bio. He started with the company after graduating from MSU and worked his way up the company to the position of senior vice president of human resources and government relations.\n\nDuring his time at Meijer, Breslin also worked as vice president for public and consumer affairs, as well as the company’s spokesperson.\n\nTrustee Joel I.

He’s also vice chairmen of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation, and the founder and co-founder of two Lansing television stations.\n\nA U.S. Marine Corps veteran, Ferguson was appointed by Gov.

She was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1991 and the state Senate in 1995, according to her bio. In 2002, she returned to the House, where she served as Michigan House Democratic Leader.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1990, she was a member of the Ingham County Board of Commissioners.\n\nMichigan State Trustee Melanie Foster walks into a special Michigan State University Board of Trustees meeting on Friday, Jan. 26, 2018 at the administration building on campus in East Lansing, where Bill Beekman was announced the acting president after former President Lou Anna Simon resigned amid the fallout from the school's Larry Nassar scandal. Jake May | MLive.com\n\nMelanie Foster\n\nFoster, a Republican from East Lansing, was elected to the board in 2004 and reelected in 2014.\n\nThe board has faced criticism from some students and faculty who say the decision to appoint former Gov. John Engler as interim president was rushed and that they didn’t have input about the decision.\n\nDuring a recent board meeting, Foster said she and her fellow trustees met with faculty- and student-liaisons to the board, and that she left that meeting “feeling optimistic about how we can continue on a collaborative effort.”\n\nAccording to her bio, Foster was first appointed to MSU’s board in 1991 by Engler and left the office in 1992.\n\nAn MSU alum, Foster spent 15 years as the president and CEO of commercial landscape company, according to her bio. She also spent 10 years as president and CEO of a commercial landscape firm in Orlando, Fla., that specialized in theme park projects.\n\nShe serves as chair of the MSU board’s finance committee, as well as the investment advisory subcommittee.\n\nTrustee Dan Kelly looks on during an MSU Board of Trustees meeting at the Michigan State University Hannah Administration Building on Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2018.

He previously sat on the Oakland Community College Board of Trustees for six years.\n\nDuring Friday’s board meeting, he addressed the decision to appoint Engler as interim president, saying the board acted swiftly because the university was in “crisis mode,” and that “it was in the best interest of the university to “get somebody with boots on the ground … that could handle the crisis that was here.”\n\nAccording to his bio, Kelly is a member of the board of directors for Giarmarco, Mullins, and Horton, PC, a law-firm based in Troy.

Doing so, Lyons said, was the first step to \"allow the healing process to begin, first and foremost for the survivors and secondarily for our university.\"\n\nLyons, amid the fallout over the Nassar scandal, announced he would not seek another term on the board once his current term expires at the end of the year.\n\nLyons, who after graduating went on to play in the NFL for several years, owns Lyons Kitzrow Wealth Management, a business that provides investment management and retirement planning services, according to his bio.\n\nHe landed in the news in January when he arraigned on misdemeanor assault and batter charges in Jackson County District Court.
