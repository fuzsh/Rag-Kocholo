(AP) â€” The presidential search committee at Michigan State University has selected a firm to lead the search for the embattled school's next president.\n\nThe East Lansing university announced Tuesday that was selected.\n\nDianne Byrum, a Michigan State trustee and co-chairwoman of the committee, says in a statement that the firm's \"proven ability to identify and recruit candidates from diverse backgrounds is particularly helpful for organizations seeking change.\"\n\nAfter Lou Anna Simon resigned in January amid fallout from the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal , Michigan State named former Gov. John Engler as interim president.\n\nNassar worked for Michigan State and USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians. He is imprisoned for molesting athletes and possessing child pornography."
