        "text": "(Source: MIRS.news, Published 01/04/2024) Michigan State University (MSU) Trustee Dianne Byrum confirmed Thursday she will not seek a third term on the MSU Board, of which she was chair for a stint. Her term ends at the end of the year.\n\n“I ran for the Michigan State University Board of Trustees to give back to my alma mater for all the opportunities my college degree provided me during the course of my career, but it is time to step aside for a new generation of leaders, and I will not be seeking a third term,” Byrum wrote. “I love MSU. I am a Spartan for life. Go Green!”\n\nThe eight-year terms of Byrum and MSU Board Vice Chair Dan Kelly are up this year. Kelly is the only elected Republican still on the eight-person board.\n\nFormer Ingham County Commissioner and prominent Lansing fundraiser Rebecca Bahar-Cook filed a campaign committee on Wednesday for the position. At the moment, she is the only new MSU Trustee candidate to create a campaign committee for the 2024 cycle. Bahar-Cook is running for the Democratic nomination.\n\n“As a Michigan State University alum, and parent of two children who went to MSU, our family has been positively impacted by the university,” Bahar-Cook wrote.\n\n“I've worked very hard in a number of positions to be a bridge builder and pragmatic problem solver whether as a member of the Ingham County Board of Commissioners or as a board member for other local non-profits. I am a proven consensus builder and my immediate focus as a trustee will be to help make MSU the best it can be for students, faculty, staff, alums, and the entire state of Michigan.”"
