        "text": "New York Times\n\nDianne Byrum, a professional friend of the governor who led the Democratic caucus for part of Whitmer’s time in the state House of Representatives said, “Clearly the COVID crisis really put a spotlight on governors and their leadership.” Byrum also noted that Gov. Whitmer is a natural leader who has a great sense of humor, and knows how to gain respect on both sides of the aisle.\n\nGov. Whitmer has risen to national prominence in recent months. Her response to Michigan’s coronavirus outbreak helped propel her onto the national stage. Several times each week, Gov. Whitmer delivers a powerful summary of the changes she’s implementing to keep the citizens of Michigan safe from COVID-19 on a state-run livestream. It is now typical to find Gov. Whitmer on national television, as well as being quoted in the New York Times. In a Mlive article, Whitmer is quoted saying, “I didn’t ask to be thrown into the national spotlight. I’ve been trying to do my job.” Gov. Whitmer moved to close schools and restaurants within days of the state’s initial outbreak and issued a stay-at-home order within two weeks. Recently, she required that people wear masks in public places.\n\nAlthough I may think that Gov. Whitmer is doing an excellent job, many on the right might disagree. Protestors have surrounded the capitol grounds across from Whitmer’s office to protest the governor’s handling of the coronavirus, chanting and in some cases carrying guns. Republican leaders are not only offended by Gov. Whitmer but they are very upset. It’s quite terrifying that people around this country are protesting stay-at-home orders to begin with. The fact that in Michigan, a woman is in charge, I think angers the right even more. It fuels their sexist and misogynist rhetoric, that a woman should not hold power.\n\nThe many protestors at Lansing, Michigan included those who flew Tea Party flags and Trump 2020 flags. This protest, similar to others, took place in an electoral battleground state like Ohio, Minnesota and North Carolina. In a New York Times article, Gov. Whitmer states, “It felt a lot more like a political rally than a statement about the stay-home order.”\n\nNew York Times\n\nGov. Whitmer caught Donald Trump’s attention in March when in a press briefing he was urging Vice President Pence not to call “the woman in Michigan.” Comically, Donald Trump refused to say Gov. Whitmer’s name. In addition, he has called her “Half Whitmer” and kept up his act by tweeting “Liberate Michigan.” His rhetoric towards Gov. Whitmer drives his loyal followers to act the exact same. She laughed at the situation and appeared on The Daily Show in a shirt that said, “that woman from Michigan.”\n\nThe woman in Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, is a powerful, intelligent and influential leader. Despite President Donald Trump and the right’s rhetoric towards her, she will not back down. Gretchen Whitmer is a force not to be reckoned with. Her political power and ability to face adversity is untouchable during this time."
