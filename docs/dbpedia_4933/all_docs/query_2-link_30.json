        "text": "LANSING — Chris Thomas, the dean of the nation's election directors who is retiring after 36 years on the job in Michigan, says the growing influence of undisclosed \"dark money\" on elections is contributing to public cynicism and will \"swallow the whole thing\" if not controlled.\n\nBut it will probably take a Watergate-scale scandal before reforms are enacted, said Thomas, who, before returning to his home state of Michigan, worked for the Federal Election Commission soon after its 1975 creation in the wake of President Richard Nixon's resignation.\n\nMore: Brian Dickerson: Frustrated Democrats impatient for The Flippening\n\n\"It's certainly not a big issue on people's lists, about soft money or dark money, but the root of all this stuff is that the policies that are being made in Washington and Lansing are certainly influenced by people who contribute large sums of money,\" Thomas told the Free Press in an interview ahead of his retirement next Friday.\n\n\"I'm not saying controlled — but certainly influenced.\"\n\nThomas, 67, who worked under one Democratic and three Republican secretaries of state, speaks as someone who earned respect —- if not always agreement — from representatives of both parties.\n\nThat's seen as a remarkable achievement for a long-serving elections director, especially in today's hyper-partisan environment.\n\n\"People always wanted to try to guess what were his partisan leanings,\" said Candice Miller, who was Michigan's Republican Secretary of State from 1995 through 2002 before serving seven terms in Congress and winning election in 2016 as Macomb County public works commissioner.\n\n\"I used to tease him that they took that gene out of his DNA.\"\n\nMore: Find another use for Pistons arena tax money, Detroiters tell Councilwoman Sheffield\n\nIt's probably fitting that the only presidential campaign Thomas ever worked on was that of John Lindsay, the late mayor of New York.\n\nLindsay, a longtime Republican, cut his ties with the GOP in 1971 and launched a short-lived bid for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination eventually won by George McGovern.\n\n\"I don't know that the Democrats ever embraced Lindsay as one of their own, and I don't think today the Republican Party would, either,\" said Thomas, who while a student at Michigan State University in East Lansing traveled to Wisconsin to briefly work on Lindsay's primary campaign.\n\nSimilarly, \"I'm really neither one,\" said Thomas, who says he worked for a couple of Republican candidates in his southwest Michigan hometown of St. Joseph while growing up, but ceased all partisan activities once he joined government.\n\nThomas steered the ship of state elections through storms that included implementation of the statewide Qualified Voter File (QVF), a contentious congressional recount in 2000 between Democrat Dianne Byrum and Republican Mike Rogers, and the partial presidential recount of 2016, pushed by Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\n\"His tenure as Michigan elections director has been marked by his passion for the democratic — with a small 'd' — elections process, an expertise that is rooted in his deep knowledge of election law, and a commitment to public service,\" said Liz Boyd, a former communications director for Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who before that job worked 16 years with Thomas at the Secretary of State's Office.\n\nThomas, a civil servant who was paid about $133,000 in 2016, said he leaves feeling that the administration of state elections is in better shape than ever, due largely to the development of the QVF — a statewide voter registration database and election management system implemented for the 1998 election.\n\nA host of innovations and improvements since then — electronic poll books, the Voter Information Center, automated tracking so those who cast absentee ballots can be sure their votes were counted — \"all roll off of the Qualified Voter File,\" Thomas said.\n\nMiller said it's easy to forget today how complex and contentious — with many of the more than 1,700 local clerks — was the implementation of the QVF. Until then, each clerk's office kept its own voter registration file, and \"some of them kept them in a shoe box,\" she said. Thomas helped overcome concerns about loss of local control.\n\nMoving beyond election administration, Thomas said he feels less satisfied on the campaign finance side of his responsibilities because of the growing use of nonprofits and other corporate entities to influence elections with money whose donors are not publicly disclosed.\n\nFor example, money spent in Michigan's 2014 general election included at least $13.5 million for which no donor was publicly reported, including $5.7 million spent in the gubernatorial race, $4.7 million in the Michigan Supreme Court campaign, and $3.1 million spent in the attorney general race, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network.\n\nThomas said it's \"absurd\" to suggest elected officials won't know the source of such money benefiting their campaigns.\n\n\"Candidates are fully aware of who these people are, and if they're not, the lobbyists will make sure they are as the legislative session begins,\" he said.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean there's anything untoward going on, but a lack of transparency breeds public suspicion and cynicism, and \"public disclosure puts everything on the table,\" he said.\n\nMichigan's 1978 lobbying disclosure law was gutted twice, first by the Legislature and then by the courts, said Thomas.\n\nToday, \"it's really hard, using that data, to learn anything,\" Thomas said. \"It gives a lot of information, but it's not really substantive information\" and \"it needs to be looked at carefully,\" within the context of past court rulings, \"to see how far they could go to at least put some more clarity into what the lobby efforts are.\"\n\nIn a third area, financial disclosure for public officials, where Michigan has been ranked worst among the 50 states, Michigan should take a serious look at requiring personal financial disclosures by candidates and elected officials, Thomas said.\n\nA replacement for Thomas has not been named, but \"we're in the final stages of making a hire,\" said Fred Woodhams, a spokesman for the Michigan Secretary of State's Office.\n\nContact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.
