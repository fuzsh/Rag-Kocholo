        "text": "The Michigan State University Board of Trustees has announced a 19-member presidential search committee tasked with providing input and aiding in the efforts to hire the 21st president.\n\nThe nine women, 10 men committee includes the student body president, trustees, distinguished faculty members and staff and alumni working in the private sector.\n\nTrustees Dianne Byrum and Melanie Foster led the announcement Wednesday on campus and pushed the amount of diversity represented on the committee. There are no survivors of the sexual abuse by former MSU Dr. Larry Nassar however, a point that was brought up by numerous attendees.\n\nDespite this point, Byrum said their voice is represented and, “Will come through as we do our work as a search committee.” Foster added to Byrum’s statement and said the committee members will go through training to, “Foster heightened issues on campus and their significance in the search process.”\n\nFoster also said no survivors approached her to serve on the presidential search committee, a point she repeated several times.\n\nBut, Katherine Rifiotis, the Associated Students of Michigan State University president, said she was approached to serve on this committee.\n\n“I was approached recently, it all happened so fast, like earlier this week,” Rifiotis said.\n\nAn international student studying political theory, Rifiotis said she is looking for a next president who will evolve as the university does as well.\n\n“To look ahead, always ahead, always head,” she said. “Using the expertise, and the experience.”\n\nThe committee will begin hosting input sessions in September. Some of these sessions will be closed, held at various colleges at the university; while others will be open to the public. That public input is a ‘a level of transparency’ the Board said is unprecedented, all in hopes of finding the right pick.\n\nHowever, it’s unclear if future candidates will be available for listening sessions with the public.\n\n“That has not been decided yet,” Byrum said.\n\nHosting public input sessions with potential candidates was important for associate professor Analuna Borcila who spoke up several times during the meeting.\n\nShe said having openness and transparency from the board is crucial for the community to begin trusting the school.\n\n“We are looking for a candidate who is able and willing to engage with the public is key for having this institution moving forward,” Borcila said.\n\nAlso disclosed during the press conference, the members of the search committee as well as the entire board have been asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, restricting what the members can discuss with the public.\n\n“You can have a failed search by disclosing information, and people will withdraw,” Byrum explained. “That has happened at this university in the past. If we’re going to have a successful search and have the best president we can have for this university and have them in place in June, then we felt it was necessary and we have been very upfront with our committee members about that.”\n\nThe Board of Trustees has also hired retired University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan to advise the committee moving forward with the selection. Sullivan will be paid $1,000 a day for her services, and Foster said Sullivan already has four to five dates on her calendar to come to MSU to host input sessions.\n\nAs for the price of the national search firm, Foster said typically they are paid one third of a president’s salary for the first year, but said it’s hard to put a number exactly on the price since a firm has yet to be chosen.\n\n\"Ultimately, we want to find the best president for Michigan State University,\" Foster added.\n\n“We look at this as an investment. If you do not have a successful search I would submit that would be more costly than paying the money up front and having a search firm,” Byrum said.\n\nThis search committee is part of the timeline produced by the board in hopes of naming a new president no later than June 2019. John Engler became interim president of the university in February 2018 following the resignation of Lou Anna Simon on Jan. 24, 2018.\n\nMembers of the public can submit feedback regarding characteristics, qualifications and criteria for the university’s next president, as well as suggestions about the search process, through the .\n\nIn addition to Trustee Bryum and Trustee Foster, the other members of the search committee are:"
