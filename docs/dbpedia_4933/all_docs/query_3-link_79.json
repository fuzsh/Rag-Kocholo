        "text": "For so long, the people of this tossup city in this swing district in this battleground state had waited for it all to be over. Instead, they awoke to the election that refused to end.\n\nThe celebrities had stopped stalking the university campus, and the candidates were gone from the front stoop. Even the ubiquitous red, white and blue lawn signs had begun to disappear. But on television, the barrage of advertisements that had caused a communal headache for months had only been replaced with a migraine-inducing monologue by the talking heads.\n\nOn the morning after here, as in the rest of the country, it was a political hangover.\n\n''I just want some closure right now,'' said Megan Thomas, 23, a piano teacher at Michigan State University who scurried to the student union between lessons today for news updates.\n\n''It's like ripping the Band-Aid off little by little,'' added Ms. Thomas, who stayed up until 4 a.m. watching returns, then checked the television soon after the alarm went off -- to no avail. ''I just want to rip it off in one fell swoop.''\n\nFinally, the eyes of the world had moved away from Michigan and this capital city that had been designated ground zero repeatedly by the national media. Now they were in Florida, where the votes were being double-checked, the presidency hanging in the balance. But while Vice President Al Gore was a decisive victor here in Michigan, the results of the fiercely fought, expensive races for the United States Senate and the House of Representatives were unclear until morning. There is even some talk of a recount.\n\nIn an odd microcosm of the bizarre seesaw that played out on national television in the wee hours, Dianne Byrum, the Democratic candidate for the Eighth Congressional District, declared victory at 12:15 a.m., only to take it back around breakfast. Supporters had chanted ''By-rum, By-rum'' and ''Congress-woman, Congress-woman,'' crying tears of joy; less than 12 hours later, the campaign manager, Tom Russell, said simply, ''I've had better days.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
