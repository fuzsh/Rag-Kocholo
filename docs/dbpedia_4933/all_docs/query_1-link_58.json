        "text": "Two students, a professor with expertise on sexual assault, an Athletic Council representative and the former Meijer president are among the 19 people that Michigan State University has named to a presidential search committee to help find a permanent replacement for Lou Anna K. Simon, who resigned in January.\n\nIn all, the committee includes seven faculty members, four members of the MSU Board of Trustees, three alumni, two administrators, two students and the union president for support staff.\n\n\"We are trying to have as broad-based of a process as possible\" although the ultimate decision will be made by the MSU Board of Trustees, Trustee Dianne Byrum said during a press conference Wednesday, Aug. 22.\n\nThe board hopes to name a new president by June 2019.\n\nByrum and Trustee Melanie Foster said repeatedly during the press conference that the trustees are committed to transparency during the search process. But they also acknowledged committee members have been asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nOne reason: The board anticipates that many of the presidential candidate will not want their names publicly disclosed, for fear of jeopardizing their current positions.\n\n\"You can have a failed search\" through premature disclosure, Byrum said.\n\n\"It's delicate balance,\" she said. \"We want to share information but we also want a successful search and the best candidates for the job.\"\n\nThe committee will help screen and interview candidates and make recommendations to the MSU board, Byrum and Foster said.\n\nByrum and Foster stressed the diversity of the search committee in regards to race, gender and life experience, saying the committee represents a cross-section of MSU stakeholders.\n\nFormer Gov. John Engler, who has been serving as interim president, will not be part of the search process, the trustees have said.\n\nByrum and Foster are two of the four trustees on the committee. The other two are Joel Ferguson and Dan Kelly.\n\nThe other 15 committee members:\n\nDebra Bittner, president of the MSU Clerical-Technical Union.\n\nPero Gagle Davbovie, distinguished professor of history and associate dean of the Graduate School.\n\nPrabu David, dean of the College of Communications Arts and Sciences.\n\nMary Finn, criminal justice professor whose expertise includes public policy responses to violence against women and children.\n\nThomas Glasmucher, distinquished professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.\n\nTomas Holt, business professor and director of the International Business Center at the Board College of Business.\n\nLeo Kempel, professor in the College of Engineering.\n\nBonnie Knutson, professor in the School of Hospitality Business and MSU's Faculty Athletic Representative to the Big Ten and NCAA.\n\nWanda Liscomp, associate professor of psychiatry who expertise includes students affairs, development and engagement, minority mental health and improving diversity in the health professions.\n\nFelicia Wu, distinquished professor of food science and human nutrition.\n\nMark Murray, former Meijer president, former MSU vice president for finance and an MSU alumni.\n\nDavid Porteous, an attorney, a former MSU trusteee and 1974 MSU graduate.\n\nLinda Hubbard, president and CEO of Carhartt Inc. and a 1982 MSU graduate who is a member of the Broad College of Business Alumni Board of Directors.\n\nKatherine Rifiotis, president of the Associated Students of Michigan State University, which is the undergraduate student government. Rifiotis is a senior honors student studying political theory and constitutional democracy.\n\nGregory Spray, member of the Council of Graduate Students and a doctoral student in the Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders.\n\nByrum and Foster were asked about whether the board considered putting a victim of Larry Nassar on the search committee. Simon's resignation was forced by the uproar over Nassar, a former MSU doctor now serving a life sentence for molesting patients. MSU has been heavily criticized for its handling of the controversy, and recently agreed to pay a $500 million settlement to Nassar victims.\n\nByrum said the committee members are \"sensitive\" to the issues raised by Nassar victims and their supporters, and \"have embraced the changes\" spurred by the controversy.\n\nThe next stage of the search process is hire a search firm and to hold \"listening sessions\" this fall with faculty, staff, students and other stakeholders to hear what people want in a new president. Two of those sessions will be open to the public."
