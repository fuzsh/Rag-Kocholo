        "text": "This is a very interesting election for Michigan’s Senate. I’ve known Mike Rogers for 22 years. I’ve known “of” Mike Rogers since I was in grade school. I first heard of him when he was a State Senate candidate who recently left the FBI (and was Army before that). He was “heir force” when it came to connections. His mother was the longtime Brighton Chamber of Commerce president and a county legend. His father was Brighton Township Supervisor at one point, although I don’t know who was in office first. His brother is Genoa Township Supervisor, a former State Rep, and was my County Commissioner when I first voted. The Rogers family is as close to political royalty as there is in Livingston County. Some DC folks were at a fundraiser in Hartland in his district. They commented to me there that they were shocked that “Chairman Rogers” was simply “Mike.” That shows what he strength is in the area. They know him. They know his family. They trust him.\n\nMike Rogers was considered an extremely strong candidate back in 2014 if he ran for Senate. He considered it, but decided against it. He later announced he was taking a media job and did not run for re-election, which was won by Mike Bishop. I remember seeing a tired and relaxed Mike later that year looking like the pressure was off him.\n\nIt’s been 11 years since he was elected to office? Does he still have it? Can he win the Senate seat? That’s the big question. What is no question at all is how strong a candidate Mike Rogers was back in the day.\n\nI don’t have the 1994 results for State Senate, but it was a wave year. Mike Rogers won easily. 1998 was mostly a wave year with a couple of exceptions, and Mike Rogers won that easily as well. Those were safe R districts for the most part, although Shiawassee County was tough territory for Rs back then. In the Congressional race in 1998, Debbie Stabenow smoked Susan Grimes Munsell (who was not pro-life) and defeated her by about 20% or more. Stabenow won all counties except Livingston, which was only 52.95%-43.08% for Munsell. Single digits. Stabenow won Tyrone Twp (unheard of for Ds), Putnam Twp, and Unadilla Twp (the latter two leaned democrat in the 90s). Brighton City, Hamburg Twp, and City of Howell were very close, which is usually the case in bad elections. Deerfield and Cohoctah were nail biters, which was a shocker. Stabenow was strong in Livingston, but Munsell was a disaster.\n\nThen came 2000. Then incumbent Debbie Stabenow ran for Senate (and won). Al Gore won the State of Michigan, and the then 8th District. Mike Rogers was the strongest candidate for the Rs. Dianne Byrum (also State Senate) was the strongest for the Ds. Mike Rogers won by 121 votes. Dianne Byrum actually declared victory prematurely that day. It was like Al Gore with Florida. Mike never forgot that lesson. Part of what got him that win was a strong homer vote. Part of that was also shaking hands with UAW auto workers at the Lansing plant. WHY was Mike strong? Honestly, he is probably the best retail candidate I’ve ever met. I’ve met some very good ones. Joe Hune. Tom Barrett. Mike Mueller. Dave Robertson. Debbie Stabenow. John Dingell. Virg Bernero. If Jamie Thompson wins re-election, I’ll add her to the list.\n\nI’m a numbers person, so I’ll compare his numbers to Bush:\n\n2000 Comparison (old 8th District, 1992-2000)\n\nIngham County (all) – Bush 39.23% – lost by 21,917. Rogers 40.11% – lost by 20,560\n\nMike cancelled out the homer effect that Dianne Byrum had. Byrum was from rural Ingham County and won a lot of Republican areas, not just the Lansing area. Rogers won most of rural Ingham outside of Bunker Hill, Leslie, (both then dem), and Onondaga (Byrum’s home). Rogers did better in the suburban areas than Bush, so it was just enough to win.\n\nLivingston County (all) – Bush 59.14% – won by 15,857. Rogers 63.66% – won by 21,928\n\nThere’s your homer. Mike got 2500 more raw votes than George W Bush even accounting for dropoff. Livingston doesn’t outvote Ingham in most cases. It would never happen these days, due to how much more democrat Ingham is today, but it didn’t happen then much either.\n\nWashtenaw County (part) – Bush 49.85% – won by 1073. (estimated)Rogers 50.84% – won by 1755\n\nThis is Dexter Twp, Freedom Twp, Lima, Lodi, Lyndon, Northfield, Pittsfield 1, 7,8, 9, Saline City1-2, Scio 1-7, Sharon, Sylvan, and Webster Twp. This areas is pretty blue today with the combination of Ann Arbor spillover into rural and suburban areas in the county, along with the rise of Purple Rose Theater in Chelsea. For those who are unaware, Actor Jeff Daniels is a Chelsea native and started up the theater over there. Back in the day, the area was competitive overall with blue (but not as blue as today) Scio up against the rural portions, Saline (deep blue today, light red then), and the Pittsfield portion (then were light red, not like today).\n\nMost of the results I saw were similar between Bush/Rogers, but Northfield Township had a significant homer adjacent ote. That’s the home of Whitmore Lake, which culturally is a bit of a blend between small town Livingston and Ann Arbor city. It’s usually close, but Mike did quite well there. He did slightly better in the northern townships like Lyndon, Sylvan (Chelsea was part of the township then), Dexter, and Webster. That 700 votes (despite drop off) made a difference.\n\nOakland County (Part) – Bush 51.09% – won by 422. Rogers 49.91% – won by 297\n\nThis is Holly Twp and Rose Twp. Holly was D leaning more then than it is today. It’s also a more “Trumpy” part of Oakland County these days. Rose Twp was base R and still is. It’s influenced by Flint a little and the UAW. It’s a small part of the old 8th.\n\nShiawassee County (part) – Bush 48.63% – won by 3. Rogers 55.17% – won by 989\n\nThis is Antrim, Burns, Shiawassee, part of Venice, and Vernon Townships along with the City of Durand. Shiawassee County has gone red since Trump although it was very competitive before then. Mike Rogers always did very well here, as did Joe Hune. Trump broke this county wide open. It’s about as WWC as it gets with a fairly heavy union presence for a mostly rural county (mostly Flint/Lansing commuters). This is homer adjacent as Mike represented this areas as a State Senator. Mike won every municipality. Bush won this area by 3. He did well in Antrim and Burns Twps which are almost extensions of Livingston County culturally. He got smoked in Durand however, which Rogers actually won. Shiawassee County is historically independent, and it showed here.\n\nGenesee County (Part) – Bush 44.23% – lost by 5104. Rogers 45.04% – lost by 4298\n\nThis is Flint Township (not city), Swartz Creek, Gaines Twp, Fenton, Linden, Mundy Twp, part of Grand Blanc, Argentine Twp, and Clayton Twp.\n\nAt this time, Genesee County was the 2nd most Democrat County in the State. The Trump years changed a lot in this county. Today, I believe Trump might have won this portion twice, although I’m not 100% sure as Flint Township is still quite democrat. Bush lost all of them except Argentine, Fenton, and Linden. Rogers won those and won the Grand Blanc portion barely. GB has gone a bit more dem since 2000, although the other areas have gotten more R. I never thought I would see Mundy Township flip like it did. I forgot how dem Clayton and Gaines used to be. Things have changed here. Rogers struggled here, but through dropoff or otherwise, did enough here to win overall.\n\nThat shows how strong Mike Rogers was in 2000, for an open seat. Redistricting was kind to him in 2002. It dropped Genesee and added Clinton County, part of Shiawassee, and part of rural and outer suburban Northern Oakland Counties. Mike won his re-election with 68% against an abrasive sacrificial lamb. He even won 59% in Ingham County that year. Most impressively, Mike won the City of Lansing that year by 1200 votes. He only lost East Lansing. 2002 wasn’t a wave year for R’s. We lost the Governor’s race and Senate race that year. Mike barely lost Ingham County in 2004, getting 49% there. In the ultimate blue waves of 2006 and 2008, Mike was challenged a bit, but still took 44.39% and 44.26% in Ingham County which is respectable as that county started consistently going about 60%+D each year. In the 2010 red wave, Mike won Ingham County again, taking 50.25% there. In the 2012 Mitt year and Mike’s last election, he got 45.94% in Ingham County. In 2014, Mike Bishop got 34.56% in Ingham County, closer to what generic Rs get in the blue stronghold.\n\nThe hidden strength of Mike Rogers is that he doesn’t give ground in his campaigns. He did by far the best of anyone in Ingham County during my voting lifetime. He also was able to do that without losing base voters in Livingston County, or losing swing voters in Shiawassee. His biggest strength is that people like him.\n\nThat was his strength – now the wildcards\n\nDo people remember him? They do in Livingston County, and probably Ingham and parts of Oakland. Macomb? Ottawa? Different story.\n\nIt’s a different country – Mike was perfect 2004 candidate. He was starting to get some heat in 2014 on foreign policy issues. The country is more dovish now than even 2014. I’m already seeing attacks from one of his anti-war opponents on foreign policy issues.\n\nIt’s an angrier country – Does Mike’s “America is still great and we’re really united” stump speech still work? It certainly will resonate with some, but will others think he’s political speak and ignoring a problem.\n\nTrump. I’m pretty sure he held his nose twice for him. He criticized him fairly strong on a couple of occasions. How much heat does he get from that from the Trump diehards? Does it matter?\n\nSecurity State – There’s a lot less trust for the DOJ, CIA, FBI, etc these days. Mike did have some criticism for the recent FBI actions, which says a lot as he’s a former FBI agent.\n\nDoes this neutralize Slotkin’s perceived strength?\n\nOverall, it will be interesting. Is this a case of Tommy Thompson or a case of Dan Coats in terms of comebacks? I don’t know. I won’t count Mike Rogers out. I can’t count out anyone who wins the City of Lansing."
