        "text": "EAST LANSING — A doctor and a lawyer met for the first time over dinner Monday night, a chance for Michigan State’s new president to meet with his new athletic director.\n\nNeither having any previous experience in major college athletics.\n\nWhether Dr. Samuel Stanley Jr. plans to keep Bill Beekman as the Spartans’ athletic director remains to be seen. As will how the former Stony Brook University president transitions to the head of a Power 5 conference NCAA Division I program.\n\nStanley arrives to the Big Ten having only been president of one school that does not play major college football and did not sponsor Division I athletics until 20 years ago.\n\nAnd Beekman said Tuesday after the MSU Board of Trustees hired Stanley that he believes his new boss can adapt and adjust to his new surroundings, just as he feels he has as athletic director.\n\n“I think certainly when I came on board, everybody comes with different strengths and weaknesses. And the lack of athletic director experience at any level with me was certainly one of the things I needed to think through,” Beekman said. “But I think Dr. Stanley, he doesn’t have Power 5 experience, but he has sat on the NCAA board, he has been involved in the key issues of the last number of years, and he’s a really, really smart guy and a quick study.\n\n“So I think he’ll be able to hit the ground running and dive into the Power 5 environment without missing a beat.”\n\nAmong the college sports elite, new university presidents tend to bring aboard those they know and trust to run schools’ multimillion-dollar athletic departments. But circumstances are unique for MSU, which less than a year ago gave Beekman a five-year contract to be its full-time athletic director despite him never having worked in sports management in any capacity.\n\nTrustee Brian Mosallam said Tuesday that the lack of experience at the highest level of college athletics should not be a factor for Stanley and Beekman.\n\n“I think they’re both very capable,” said Mosallam, a former Spartan football player. “I think they both can learn as we go. I think we’ll be fine.”\n\nThere will, at minimum, be an adjustment period.\n\nSliding scale\n\nMSU spent almost twice as much on its football program ($33.5 million) as Stony Brook had expenses for its entire athletic department ($17.7 million) during the 2017-18 school year, according to the U.S. Department of Education’s Equity in Athletics Data Analysis.\n\nIt is a leap that Stanley said he is prepared for.\n\n“Everybody knows Michigan State athletics — the Spartans are known around the world &mldr;,” he said Tuesday. “I think in general, I’m very bullish on what’s going to be done, and I look forward again to working with our athletics director and again understanding from the people in the community what people’s thoughts are about athletics.”\n\nStanley has served on the NCAA’s Division I Board of Directors since 2014 and among the 24-member Division I Board of Governors since 2016, with his term expiring in August. He also has been a past chairman of the America East Conference’s Board of Presidents.\n\nDianne Byrum, the chair of MSU’s Board of Trustees and co-chair of the board’s presidential search committee, said Stanley’s experience in athletics was not a primary purpose for his hiring.\n\n“I will say it was a piece, but it wasn’t at the top of our list of qualities and characteristics,” Byrum said Tuesday. “We didn’t seek a presidential candidate that had a stellar record in athletics. In my mind, it was a bonus, because he did have the experience of being on the NCAA board of directors and governors.”\n\nMore: 4 things to know about Michigan State University's new president\n\nMore: Stony Brook U, home of new MSU president, under 3 federal sex assault investigations\n\nStony Brook's football program experienced mid-2010s success in the Big South Conference at the Football Championship Subdivision level before moving to the Colonial Athletic Association. Its basketball program made the NCAA tournament for the first time in 2016 under now-Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell and won 20-plus games seven times during Stanley’s tenure as president. The university also renovated its football and basketball venues, among other facilities projects.\n\nStill, taking over a Big Ten university and its sports programs will be like going from Long Island to New York City for Stanley, who officially begins his new position Aug. 1 at an annual $800,000 base salary.\n\n“Scalability is an issue,” Mosallam said of Stanley’s move. “And I think that we were comfortable I think given the foundation and the way that our athletics are right now, the stability, that he can come in and scale it and learn and prepare for the next phase.”\n\nLearning on the job\n\nBeekman was hired by since-departed interim president John Engler on July 16, 2018, on a $750,000 annual contract that runs through 2023. It was a move that got a thumbs-up from both men's basketball coach Tom Izzo and football coach Mark Dantonio, among other Spartan coaches.\n\nEngler had appointed Beekman to run MSU’s athletic department on an interim basis on Feb. 5 that year after Mark Hollis resigned amid the fallout of the Larry Nassar scandal.\n\nThere is a provision in Beekman’s contract, however, that gives him cushion should Stanley decide to hire his own athletic director. Beekman would be reassigned as “Vice President and Senior Consultant to the Offices of the Provost and the Executive Vice President for Administrative Services Finance.” It would be for the remainder of his five-year contract at a salary of $375,000, or half of what he is making as athletic director.\n\nBeekman said he feels Hollis left him “a strong base to start from.”\n\n“I think you’re always learning. And when you start a new role, you don’t know what you don’t know, so you’re sort of peeling back the layers one at a time,” Beekman said. “And I’m sure I got a lot to learn, but I think spending more and more time with my Big Ten colleagues, with commissioner (Jim) Delany — I’ve had an opportunity to have dinner with him several times – and I think we’ve got a very, very strong base.”\n\nIn his 10 years at Stony Brook, Stanley replaced his athletic director once — but not due to performance of the sports program. He fired Jim Fiore in 2013 after allegations emerged of sexual harassment, retaliation and employment discrimination according to ESPN, during the time when the Seawolves were thriving in both football and basketball.\n\nBeekman said he got to learn more about his new boss during their Memorial Day evening group dinner. He discovered Stanley is “an avid athlete himself, a serviceable tennis player I’m told.” And they got a brief chance to discuss what is in front of them with MSU athletics.\n\n“I’m excited to spend more time with him and work through our plan and see how we can work together to make the program better,” Beekman said."
