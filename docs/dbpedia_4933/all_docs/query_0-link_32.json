        "text": "It was last call at Bubba's Roadside Inn, the Green Bay Packers had just beaten the Minnesota Vikings 26-20 in overtime and Dianne Byrum had no particular place to go.\n\nMs. Byrum, the Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives here in one of the most tightly contested races in the nation, had spent the past 20 hours prowling her district in search of potential voters; she had 20 hours left before she would rest. It was 12:47 a.m., Election Day had arrived and Ms. Byrum's youthful but weary aides were running out of places to look.\n\nConsulting Internet maps on a laptop computer, they set out for a police station in sleepy suburban Flint, where they found one woman at the desk; the lone patrol car on duty, and the lone supervisor, were out in the field. At the adjacent fire station, three men in overstuffed recliners were watching the news on Channel 12 -- watching a report, in fact, about Ms. Byrum's exhausting campaign stunt. Farmer Jack, a 24-hour supermarket, offered one employee who did not speak English, another who proudly announced he had never voted before and some sorely needed throat lozenges. Home Depot was a mini-jackpot, with an enthusiastic security guard who doubles as a Democratic delegate.\n\nHaving shaken the few hands she could find, the candidate returned to the red van festooned with campaign placards that was her chariot for this final 40-hour meet-and-greet marathon, whereupon she found her 23-year-old communications director, Adam Wright, fast asleep.\n\n''I'm going to find out what my stamina really is,'' said Ms. Byrum, 46, a former hardware store owner who has spent eight years in the State Legislature, 10 before that as a county commissioner. ''You always have a lot of nervous energy. You wonder what you can be doing. Could you do more, one more thing?''\n\nBilled as ''40 hours of work for working families,'' Ms. Byrum's sleepless sprint to the finish line was the latest version of an increasingly popular campaign gimmick in high-profile races. As she was meandering from diner to diner, Ms. Byrum's presidential pick, Al Gore, was racing through 30 hours of rallies in seven cities. ''I can outwork Al Gore,'' she said, laughing.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
