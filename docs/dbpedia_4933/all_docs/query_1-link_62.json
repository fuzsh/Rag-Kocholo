        "text": "EAST LANSING, Mich. â€” Long-simmering tensions boiled over during a Board of Trustees meeting Friday, as Michigan State University's seemingly-endless controversies came to a head again.\n\nA growing list of people calling for board chair Rema Vassar's resignation or replacement saw no resolution. A closed-door resolution proposing Vassar's removal failed, according to Trustee Dianne Byrum.\n\nMichigan politicians like U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow have called for Vassar to be removed from her position. Vassar is the first Black woman to be MSU board chair, and Black students in particular showed up Friday morning to rally around her.\n\nTrustee Brianna Scott sent a letter to the board over the weekend outlining a series of ethical violations she said Vassar had made, including:\n\nRepeatedly overstepped her role as board member, including after February's shooting that killed three students and injured five\n\nBullied Interim President Teresa Woodruff, who announced in August she would not be pursuing the president role permanently\n\nAttempted to negotiate a settlement with a former Dean without the authority to do so, and without the board's knowledge\n\nContacted Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel about long-sought documents related serial sexual abuser Larry Nassar, and misrepresented to Nessel her willingness to procure the documents\n\nTraveled on a donor's private jet while on university business, which Scott said was a violation of the board's code of ethics\n\nAppeared in an ad for a former trustee's private business, which Scott said was a violation of the board's code of ethics\n\nParticipated in an exchange minimizing the trauma of rape survivor and anti-sexual violence advocate Brenda Tracy, who accused now-fired head football coach Mel Tucker of sexual harassment\n\nAvoided cooperating in an outside investigation into who leaked Tracy's identity, causing Tracy to go public with her accusations against Tucker\n\nVassar responded to the accusations publicly during Friday's meeting, saying most of them are lies and other trustees are guilty of the things they accuse her of.\n\n\"I must be doing something right if folks are coming this stridently for me,\" Vassar said.\n\nVassar called for more specific ethics and travel guidelines for trustees.\n\n\"So that we can all be held accountable to the same standards consistently,\" Vassar said. She also adamantly disagreed with Scott's claims that she had not been cooperating with the investigation into who leaked Tracy's identity.\n\n\"Please don't believe that I am a liar. I just don't do that,\" Vassar said. \"It's not worth it. This idea that I'm not transparent is a problem.\"\n\nScott told audience members at the trustee meeting that she had been targeted, including with physical threats, since making the accusations about Vassar.\n\n\"You have no idea the stuff that has been said about me this week and all I wanted to do was standup for people who don't have a voice because they're so afraid to do what I have done, and that is taking the darts that have been thrown at me for standing up for what is right,\" Scott said.\n\nScott, who is Black, said her race and allegiance to her community had been called into question.\n\n\"Bullying, being called anti-Black... that I'm playing in plantation politics, that I'm not Black, that I'm a Black person in a white body,\" Scott recalled as she broke into tears.\n\n\"I didn't put one damn lie in that letter,\" she added.\n\nThe problems with Michigan State go far beyond the controversy surrounding Vassar and Scott this week, trustees and students said. During a nearly four-hour meeting, frustration reached a fever pitch for some.\n\nFormer state Rep. Cynthia A. Johnson, D-Detroit, was outspoken in her support for Vassar, saying that she was being \"publicly lynched,\" something Johnson said she had also experienced as a Black woman in power.\n\n\"God don't like what y'all doing,\" Johnson told the board before leaving the room. \"And until you do right by the people nothing is going to be right for you.\"\n\nVassar has implied in previous statements that because she is the first Black woman to hold her position, the attacks against her have been motivated by race. That sentiment is one that students with Black campus organizations agreed with on Friday, saying they were all too familiar with persistent racial injustice and discrimination on MSU's campus.\n\n\"I don't like this school. Like when they say 'I'm not a Spartan,' I side with that wholeheartedly,\" said sophomore Jordan Wesson, vice president of the Black Students Alliance at MSU. \"I'm not a Spartan.\"\n\n\"We just go here,\" added fellow sophomore Devin Wilson.\n\nScott said Friday that her colleagues on the board had avoided speaking up for fear of being called racist.\n\n\"None of this - none of it - has been because of Rema's race,\" Scott said. \"I'm Black. I voted for her.\"\n\nNo decisions were made during the meeting about Vassar's fate on the board, but for many the fight continues.\n\n\"We're done with this,\" Wilson said. \"No more decorum. We're going to sit in these board meetings and we're going to talk. You don't want us to talk we're going to yell. You don't want us to stand, we're going to run, we're going to march.\"\n\nWilson and Wesson said they did not agree with the idea that taking Vassar from her position as chair would be in the best interest of the university. Both said they felt Vassar was one of the very few university leaders who cared about the issues Black and minority students were facing."
