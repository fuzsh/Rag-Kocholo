        "text": "Lansing — Former state Sen. Curtis Hertel, a Democrat who's currently a member of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration, is strongly considering a campaign for a swing seat in the U.S. House, three sources familiar with Hertel's thinking told The Detroit News on Friday.\n\nIn recent weeks, Democrats have become focused on Hertel and Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum as their top potential and mostly likely contenders in a mid-Michigan district that's held by Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Lansing.\n\nSlotkin is running for the U.S. Senate next year instead of another term in the House, opening a seat that Republicans also plan to target. Tom Barrett, a former state senator from Charlotte, lost to Slotkin by 5 percentage points in 2022 and is gearing up for another bid in 2024.\n\nHertel would give Michigan Democrats a well-known candidate who worked across the aisle with Republicans to craft state budgets during his tenure as the minority vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He also helped lead Senate Democrats' campaign operations in 2022 as they won control of the state Senate for the first time in 40 years.\n\nPolitical consultant Adrian Hemond, a Democrat and CEO of the Lansing-based firm Grassroots Midwest, said Hertel would be competitive in the 7th District. Hertel is a strong fundraiser with “solid” name identification in the most Democratic parts of the district, including Ingham County, which would help turn out voters, Hemond said.\n\n“A lot of it would come down to what kind of year is it going to be at the top of the ticket? We have a U.S. Senate race that only one side has a real candidate in right now, which will be helpful for Curtis,” Hemond said. “And then you have the presidential election, which God only knows what's gonna happen with that.\n\n\"But I think he'd be very competitive.”\n\nHertel didn't respond to a message seeking comment about his potential campaign.\n\nThe 7th District covers Ingham, Livingston, Clinton and Shiawassee counties along with parts of Eaton, Oakland and Genesee counties.\n\nHertel is now Whitmer's legislative affairs director and is working to help create the state's next budget. That process is expected to be completed in June. Hertel could announce his bid for Congress as early as July.\n\nHemond said July 1 — the start of the third fundraising quarter for federal candidates — is probably the latest that most hopefuls will want to launch a U.S. House campaign in a highly competitive district like Michigan’s 7th because they want to start raising money as soon as possible.\n\nHemond predicted that a race in the 7th could end up being decided by less than 2,000 votes, probably closer to 1,000 in 2024.\n\nBut having a contested primary would not be helpful going into such a competitive election, with inevitable spending and attention from outside and party groups. So Hertel is likely closely watching whether Byrum or any other Democrats jump in.\n\n“Ultimately, I think that Barb Byrum is much more likely to run for secretary of state in the future than she is to run for Congress next year. That's a much more likely outcome,” Hemond said. “But I think that's one of the things that Curtis Hertel is watching right now.”\n\nByrum has become a prominent figure on election policy in the state. Secretary of state, the top election official in Michigan, will be on the ballot in 2026. Jocelyn Benson, the current Democratic secretary of state, won't be able to run for another term.\n\nOn Friday, Byrum said she is still considering whether to run for the 7th District seat.\n\n“I am confident that this district will elect an excellent leader as it has these last few years,\" Byrum said.\n\nByrum, a former state lawmaker, spoke to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in past cycles about potentially running for Congress and ultimately decided not to go to Washington, D.C.\n\n“Particularly in southern Ingham County, the Byrum family is kind of an institution and so she would be formidable,” Hemond said. “That might be the last domino to fall to help Curtis make his decision: What does Barb ultimately do?”\n\nByrum’s mother almost went to Congress under another configuration of the mid-Michigan district in 2000.\n\nThen-state Sen. Dianne Byrum, D-Onondaga, and then-Senate Majority Floor Leader Mike Rogers, a Republican from Brighton, faced off for the open seat representing what was then the 8th District.\n\nThe race was ultimately decided by just over 100 votes after a recount, with Rogers flipping to Republican control the seat vacated by Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Stabenow of Lansing who ran that year for the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe knock on both Rogers and Byrum by political observers at the time was that they were too \"nice,\" leaving the attacks to outside groups.\n\nNo one could have said that about the 2022 Slotkin-Barrett race, where the candidates had two hostile debates and aired multiple attack ads.\n\nThat contest was among the most expensive in the country. The ad-tracking firm AdImpact found the $36.6 million spent in advertising on the Slotkin-Barrett race was the most spent on any U.S. House race in the country in 2022.\n\n\"Last year, Michiganders in the 7th Congressional District made clear they want a representative who is committed to lowering costs, protecting fundamental rights and keeping communities safe,\" DCCC spokesperson Courtney Rice said. \"The DCCC is committed to making sure that representation remains — and we are confident that come 2025, Michigan’s 7th District will stay in Democratic hands.\"\n\nCurtis Hertel's father, Curtis Hertel Sr., served as a Michigan House speaker. Curtis Hertel's wife, Elizabeth Hertel, is director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\n\ncmauger@detroitnews.com\n\nmburke@detroitnews.com"
