        "text": "INVITATION TO OUR 163rd ICC ZOOM PUBLIC MEETING\n\nDuring the decades of struggle against apartheid in South Africa (1940s to 1990s), Asian Indians / Indo-South Africans made significant contributions to, and stood alongside Nelson Mandela and the broader anti-apartheid movement. Building upon Mahatma Gandhi’s principles of passive resistance, their involvement was pivotal in the fight for equality and justice. Inspired by Gandhi’s teachings, prominent individuals such as Ahmed Kathrada, Ismail and Fatima Meer, Billy Nair, Monty Naicker, Frene Ginwala, Yusuf Dadoo, Maulvi Cachalia, and scores of other known and unknown freedom fighters emerged.\n\nTheir efforts gained momentum with the 1946 passive resistance campaign in which Kathrada actively participated. This campaign coincided with India’s case presented to the United Nations, effectively internationalising the issue of apartheid and shedding light on the oppressive regime. Indians in South Africa played a crucial role in drawing attention to the injustices of apartheid, igniting global awareness and garnering international support.\n\nFuelled by their commitment to justice and equality, these individuals tirelessly organised protests, demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience. They fearlessly confronted the authoritarian political culture of apartheid, challenging the dominance of the white minority population in South Africa. Through their unwavering dedication and willingness to sacrifice, Indians actively contributed to the mass action against the ruling National Party government.\n\nMoreover, Indians in South Africa played an integral part in fostering unity among diverse communities. Recognising the interconnectedness of their struggle with that of the majority Black population, they stood in solidarity, amplifying the voices of the marginalised and advocating for a democratic and inclusive South Africa.\n\nThe collective efforts of Indians, alongside other anti-apartheid activists, combined with growing international isolation and economic sanctions, eventually led to negotiations to end apartheid. These negotiations commenced formally in 1990 and culminated in South Africa’s first multiracial elections under a universal franchise in 1994.\n\nIndians in South Africa have often been overlooked and marginalized in the history of the struggle against apartheid. While their contributions were significant, their role has been largely rendered invisible or overshadowed by other narratives. Despite actively participating in political activism, civil disobedience, and providing vital support to the anti-apartheid movements, their stories and sacrifices have been underrepresented. The focus has primarily been on the Black majority population and prominent figures like Nelson Mandela. This marginalisation perpetuates a historical narrative that fails to recognise the diverse and interconnected efforts that were essential in challenging apartheid. It is crucial to rectify this omission and give due recognition to the invaluable contributions of Indians in the struggle against apartheid, ensuring a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of South Africa’s history.\n\nPlease join us THIS SUNDAY for the 163rd weekly ICC ZOOM Public Meeting, Sunday July 16th 2023 at (1.00 p.m. Belize), (3.00 p.m. New York/Eastern time), (3.00 p.m. Trinidad/ Atlantic time), (3.00 p.m. Guyana), (4.00 p.m. Suriname), (8.00 p.m. England), (9.00 p.m. South Africa), (11.00 p.m. Mauritius), (Mon 12.30 a.m., India), (Mon 7.00 a.m. Fiji).\n\nTopic: Invisible Indians with Nelson Mandela in the Struggle against Apartheid in South Africa\n\nSpeakers:\n\nDR.
