        "text": "Multi-talented Staz Nair made the leap from boyband wannabe to credible actor with roles in \"Game of Thrones\" (HBO, 2011-) and \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again\" (Fox, 2016). Born in London to parents of Russian and Indian descent, Nair first caught attention as a member of Times Red, the beatboxing boyband who made it through to the Judges House stage of the 2012 season of \"The X Factor\" (ITV1, 2004-). The trio released an E.P., Just No Good For Me, a year later but after calling it a day Nair decided to switch his focus to acting instead. Following an uncredited role on Middle Eastern political thriller \"Tyrant\" (FX, 2014-16), Nair landed a three-episode stint as Qhono, the Dothroki warrior who helps take Daenerys prisoner, in the sixth season of fantasy phenomenon \"Game of Thrones\" (HBO, 2011-). Nair then made his big screen debut playing Bharat Kumar, a wealthy groom-to-be who unwittingly becomes involved in a love triangle, in the cross-cultural musical drama \"Bazodee\" (2016). In the same year Nair was cast as Dr. Frank-N-Furter's titular creation in Kenny Ortega's tribute to the cult classic, \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again\" (Fox, 2016)."
