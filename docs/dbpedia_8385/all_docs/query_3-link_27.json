        "text": "The first time was understandable, I suppose;\n\na Race to prove the superiority of Kennedy’s dick.\n\nA rat done bit my sister Nell. (with Whitey on the moon)\n\nHer face and arms began to swell. (and Whitey's on the moon)\n\nBut now –\n\nthe Wall torn down and the sickle back in the shed;\n\nDomino Theory debunked and haunted spectre exorcised;\n\nRed Threat long since diffused into the ether,\n\nforgotten like sinuous threads of a nightmare\n\nwhich peel away with the onslaught of consciousness and light –\n\nnow, what is the entire fucking point of all this, again?\n\nI can't pay no doctor bill. (but Whitey's on the moon)\n\nTen years from now I'll be paying still. (while Whitey's on the moon)\n\nThey say there is capital, and there is income;\n\nthey say the first one grows by itself.\n\nThey say when you are unlucky enough to be born without a trust fund\n\nthe labor of your body becomes your capital.\n\nThey say this is called\n\nthe American Dream.\n\nTaxes taking my whole damn check, Junkies making me a nervous wreck,\n\nThe price of food is going up, An' as if all that shit wasn’t enough:\n\nA rat done bit my sister Nell.\n\nI once read in Proverbs that the hand of the diligent maketh rich;\n\nit is the devil himself who manipulates our idle fingers.\n\nI once learned in school that the Venn Diagram\n\nbetween hard work and success\n\nis a perfect circle.\n\nThe man just upped my rent last night. ('cause Whitey's on the moon)\n\nNo hot water, no toilets, no lights. (but Whitey's on the moon)\n\nI wonder why he's upping me? ('cause Whitey's on the moon?)\n\nBut then I read that capitalism started on the plantation;\n\nthen I noticed all the humanity being systematically removed\n\nfrom our human means of production.\n\nNow I finally see the exploitation masked by the smirking logo\n\nsplashed across every Amazon box I am guilty of receiving\n\nonly two days after I’ve impulsively placed the order.\n\nWas all that money I made last year (for Whitey on the moon?)\n\nHow come there ain't no money here? (Hmm! Whitey's on the moon)\n\nA moment, then, of reckoning,\n\nas the world burns and the institutions fall;\n\na weightless second dangling from the precipice of change\n\nbetween the way things were\n\nand the way they need to be.\n\nBilly Nair’s on the moon\n\nand the rest of us mired in the quicksand of status quo;\n\nBilly Nair’s on the moon\n\nand the rest of us dreaming of the grand revolution to which we’ll arise.\n\nY'know I just about had my fill (of Whitey on the moon)\n\nI think I'll send these doctor bills, Airmail special (to Whitey on the moon)"
