        "text": "Newton Rotary Meetings Cancelled Until Further Notice\n\nThe Board of Directors met on Thursday and there were several discussions and decisions related to the current coronavirus situation that I want to communicate to everyone.\n\nThere will be no regular meeting next week, Wednesday, March 18th. We were considering cancelling and then got word from Brae Burn that they will not host us next week, and that they will let us know when we can resume.\n\nThe BOD will be meeting again next week, most likely in a video conference call. We will be discussing on a week by week basis how to proceed with the work of the Club and when and how to resume meetings. Several options came up, including video conferencing or even meeting outdoors if the weather allows. Let us know if you have ideas! If you would like to participate in any of these BOD meetings, please let Sue Peghiny know and she will include you in the meeting invitation.\n\nSusan Paley canceled the Village Bankâs sponsorship of Saturdayâs volunteer effort with Cradles to Crayons. We are doing the same, canceling this as a Club service event. Note that individuals may still contact Cradles to Crayons to volunteer on their own.\n\nWe will need to cancel Speakers and Students of the Month for at least the next two meetings.\n\nOur expectation is that the Boston Marathon will be postponed, probably to September. The Marathon related auction will likely be postponed as well until a firm date is set for the Marathon. This is based on the assessment that the auction will not be very effective given that people will have other things on their minds that have higher priorities.\n\nWe decided to defer all further funding requests until we better understand the consequences of the coronavirus. We did vote to approve $1000 to the Uganda flood relief project requested last week by Rabbi Abramson.\n\nThese are difficult times. We are not certain how this will all play out, and when we can return to some semblance of what we consider normal. While it may not be in the best interests of our membersâ health to gather for meetings, I and the Board agree that the rolls played by the Club and its members in the community should not stop.\n\nWe also agree that we need some way to communicate with each other and maintain our sense of Club in the absence of our normal meetings. We will be addressing this at the BOD meeting next week and welcome your input.\n\nThere will undoubtedly be more (and new) needs that will become apparent in the community, like seniors who cannot get out to shop, families with children confined to their homes, and families that do not have the luxury of hoarding necessities or even buying food. Please keep your ear to the ground to help us discover these needs, and how you might be willing to lend a hand if needed.\n\nPlease stay healthy. Let me know if you have ideas on how our Club can help our community, or if you see needs that may be falling through the cracks where we might be able to help. We will keep our website up to date with new developments.\n\nRon\n\nBIG Changes Coming to Newton Rotary on July 1!\n\nCHANGES HAPPENING JULY 1, 2018\n\nAT THE ROTARY CLUB OF NEWTON\n\nMeeting Schedule - Two Meetings a Month!\n\nStarting July 1, 2018 the Rotary Club of Newton will begin holding regular meetings twice a month instead of every week.

Peace in Cairo now.\n\nPres wasn't in favor of police because they were arresting his people. Minister of interior, police is back, security.\n\nWhy do you want democracy? vs. security for the people\n\nMuslim brothers to take part in the democracy; control 30% population. They did not have a mandate when voting last few elections. Moderate Muslim brothers. Hoped they would split the brothers (religious party and political party).

She went to the CU football game where they were slaughtered by Oregon Ducks 57-16 . The following day she did a day trip to top of Pikes Peak where for history buffs was where Catherine Lee Bates wrote \"Oh Beautiful\". See below for cool pics. Another happy dollar for our guest Ron Hoffman from the ALS community who Sue invited to speak to us today.\n\nMark Nicholas: step daughter coming to visit. first grandchild due in January.\n\nTom Keery: Suspense dollar. It could be happy or it could be sad. He got a voicemail from his daughters boyfriend and hasn't listened to it yet. He has suspicions that it may be that she might get engaged... stay tuned...\n\nEd Casavant: for BU who beat St. Francis this past weekend.\n\nPeter Mahler: He gets to sit next to Bert Martinson today and hasn't seen him in a while.\n\nPaul Stone: For the Red Sox winning two games. Sad dollar for them losing last night.\n\nDick Bowen: Red Sox go all the way.\n\nJustin Sallaway: he is just happy to have a dollar. (Aren't we all... )\n\nMarie Presti: for our guest Ron Hoffman and learning about the ALS non profit and for the weather today given its better than its been all week with the rain we've had.\n\n========================\n\nMary picked Justin's ticket. 6 Diamonds. too bad... Sue clapped :)\n\nSue introduced our speaker:\n\nRon Hoffman, Compassionate Care ALS. Sue got involved because her brother's best friend got ALS and past away. He was an incredible composer. Did a CD of Sue's brother's friend's compositions. 100% goes to compassionate Care ALS. Sue and her husband are singing on the CD. Still for sale if anyone wants to still buy it. They sell them on the website below.\n\nSince 1997, Ron got into this type of work by accident. Ron worked for Gordon Heald who was a caterer and worked in Worcester. Gordon was diagnosed with ALS. His speech was off. Ron started driving Gordon because his wife asked him to help Gordon so he wouldn't get any more speeding tickets. One night at 1:30 AM Gordon called Ron needing something but couldn't put it into words. Ron went over, Gordon was on the floor. His wife Betsy, then asked him to move in with them to help Gordon live his life.\n\nRon and Gordon's wife asked Gordon whether to fund in Gordon's name? Gordon said yes. They agreed to make the premise to help people. Gordon T. Heald ALS Fund. MA ALS chapter asked Ron to merge the organizations and join their board. He stayed for 1.5 years then separated and brought the original organization with him. They support individuals living with ALS. Physically, emotionally, spiritually. Don't tell families what they don't want to know. He doesn't tell them what he thinks they should know. Family Dynamics. Each one looks different. Ron's group tries to figure out whats going on inside the home. Then they provide things that are not paid for by the medical benefits. Education is a big piece. Nursing students and medical students sometimes say too much to ALS families and the families are not ready to hear that information. Ron goes beyond just the ABC's.\n\nIts a relational model. Sometimes it is just \"Thank you for the ramp\". Other times, its more of a relationship.\n\nThey will drive across the state to help families. Sometimes its telling families how bad it can get.\n\nCounseling, equipment (wheelchair), ramps, vertical lifts, shower accessories, chairs on wheels, reclining stand up chairs, psychotherapists, grieve and trauma specialists, 450K people are diagnosed with ALS worldwide. 3-5 years is the normal lifespan once diagnosed, there are 35K diagnosed in the US. There is a registry but its difficult to track.\n\nVisit www.ccals.org for more information or to buy a CD. 100% of the proceeds of the sale of the CD goes towards this organization .\n\nSue Peghiny, Ron Hoffman, and Mary Kern.\n\nMary adjoined at 1:27pm.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMarie Presti :)\n\nRotary Meeting August 13 2013\n\nRotary 8/13/13.

He called her said he's been wanting to say hello. Last round of chemo this week. Then 2 more weeks to recover. He said to say hello to all of us.

THANK YOU!\n\nPeggy Lepore, welcomed back fellow Rotarian Paul Stone back to the meeting for the first time since his fall. Yea!! and he looked very good too.\n\nPaul Stone as he was happy to be back at the meeting and healthy again. He also did his usual \"how about them Red Sox!\"\n\nStella Pang gave $15 today since today is her 14th year wedding anniversary! CONGRATULATIONS! She also commented part of it was for Bruce.\n\nMarie gave $5 to give an update on her mom... (bone biopsy was Monday and confirmed it was hormonal cancer which metastasized from her breast into her pelvic bone as well as skull and legs. Oncologist appointments next week to recommend treatment plan. She also described her Spartan Saturday race. It was a 3.2 mile mountainous run (actually walk on many occasions) along with 15 obstacles including jumping over fire, climbing 10 foot walls, climbing up 12 foot hanging ropes to ring a bell, dragging tires, and crawling under muddy barbed wired. See pictures at the end of this newsletter to get the full effects...\n\nNo guests today so Stella is off the hook for introducing guests. But we'll miss her joke...\n\nPaul picked Marie's number. about $500 in the kitty. 9 clubs. too bad. (this time really too bad because it was me who didn't pick it...)\n\nMary thought membership met this week but actually it was notes from last year.

Different presidents could come and speak. We'd make headway if we asked to come and speak first and then judge their interest in joining.\n\nMary said she can get them to come for lunch... but sometimes people said they already belong to the \"chamber\". Competition? Do one or the other. We're a luncheon club that helps the community. We need to be able to help differentiate us. Maybe get Greg to come. He's the head of the Chamber of Commerce for Newton/Needham.\n\nTaking a day and walking into the local businesses. Auburndale Keys drug owner was thinking of joining.\n\nWe need a list and then match up who goes to which person.\n\nIndira was invited to Worcester installation lunch. Invitation in the mail. Everyone was asked to invite a person $15. People from everywhere. President had 10 members to join as a goal. They ended up with 5 members. Getting them to death by chocolate. Some entertainers.\n\nMarketing. tied to membership drive. Put an ad in craigslist. Come on and do community service. TAB can put a free press release. 25th anniversary of women in Rotary. We've had 5-6 Women presidents. We ought to take advantage of it. Do a skit and invite people. What will men contribute to Rotary? Today we are 1/2 women and 1/2 men. That could be a theme.\n\nBring a potential member. Have a visitor day at luncheon. That would be the speaker. Incent current members to bring a member. Go back through the speaker list and ask them if they want to be on the friends list. Mary will put together a committee. Different ethnic communities. Russian community in Auburndale might be good to ask if they want to join.\n\nBoard members of each of the non profits should be asked to come since we do donate and offer community grants which they may be eligible for. 2nd step, Newton Food Pantry. Check with Ed for last 10 years of who we donated to.\n\nMary Adjourned early at 1:15PM\n\nPaul Stone accompanies by our President, Mary Kern, and his weekly ride, Dick Bowen.

EMT's work varied 8-12 hour shifts. Require 2 medics. State recognizes PB (transfers). Basic life support vs. advanced life support. Paid by insurance (premiums). EMT bills insurance.

Not an easy life. Need to serve.\n\n3) Dick. Whats your take on Afghanistan after we pull out? Personal opinion is: transition phase. Afghans needs to step up and take control of their own country. They need to learn how to farm, learn to protect their own people. He doesn't think they'll be able to do that. Did we make a difference? You want to think that you did. Problem is the people appointed to govern them are a bit wacky... there will come a time when its out of our hands... We'll have a force there but we need to bring our men home. Give the reigns back to the Afghans and see what happens.\n\n4) Ed. What is age eligibility? special forces is low. DCO - direct commission officers, they say I want to serve?
