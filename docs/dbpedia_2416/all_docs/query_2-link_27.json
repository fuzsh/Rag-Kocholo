        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis study demonstrated a pattern of physical inactivity that increased over 5 years of follow-up in older men and women with type 2 diabetes. At baseline, multiple factors were associated with physical inactivity in all subjects (lower levels of education, working, higher BMI, and peripheral numbness, indicative of peripheral neuropathy). At 5 years, lower levels of education and higher BMI remained predictive of physical inactivity, along with higher A1C levels assessed at baseline and baseline physical inactivity. While significant differences were observed with regard to factors associated with physical inactivity at baseline and predictive of physical inactivity at 5 years between men and women, baseline physical inactivity was shown to be prevalent and equally important in both men and women with type 2 diabetes.\n\nAn association of lower levels of education and higher BMI in relation to physical inactivity has also been demonstrated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III) data in adults with type 2 diabetes (n = 1480). Those with less than a high school degree were more likely to report no physical activity (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0-3.3) as compared with those with a college degree.17 In addition, those with a BMI ≥30 were 1.2 times more likely to engage in no physical activity (95% CI, 0.7-2.2) as compared with those with a BMI <25. A recent study examining the factors associated with dropping out of a supervised exercise program for sedentary individuals with type 2 diabetes18 demonstrated there were significantly more dropouts in the exercise group versus control group. Factors associated with dropping out of the exercise intervention included lower fitness level, higher insulin resistance, higher percentage total body fat, and higher subcutaneous abdominal fat. While the subjects included 42% women, gender was not a significant predictor of dropping out of the exercise program. The current study adds to these data by identifying additional diabetes-related factors associated with physical inactivity.\n\nBoth autonomic (men at baseline) and peripheral neuropathies (women at baseline and men at 5 years) were found to be associated with physical inactivity. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a common complication in diabetes and is often a contraindication to exercise or at least demands that the individual take special precautions. CAN is prevalent in individuals with type 2 diabetes, occurring in as many as 44.3% of patients.19 Importantly, exercise has been shown to improve CAN in individuals with type 2 diabetes, with as little as 6 months of an exercise intervention.20 While those with CAN had lower aerobic capacity in this study and impaired heart rate variability as compared with those without CAN, both CAN and aerobic capacity were improved.\n\nPeripheral neuropathy is also prevalent in the population with type 2 diabetes. In one cross-sectional study, the presence of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (n = 269) was found in 26.4% of subjects, with 80% describing their pain as moderate to severe.21 There is also evidence that a 10-week exercise intervention including both aerobic and strengthening exercise may improve symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, including pain.22 However, the challenges of increasing physical activity in the presence of autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, as well as when the individual in overweight or obese, are substantial and require creativity in engaging these individuals in a program of regular activity. Modifications such as shorter periods of activity with more frequent intervals throughout the day, water-based activities, and planning so that there is an opportunity to stop and rest may assist in adoption. In addition, daily physical activity has been shown to decrease later functional decline in older adults with peripheral artery disease (32.5% with diabetes).10 Those subjects with higher daily physical activity showed less annual decline in function. These are significant findings in an aging population with type 2 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy, particularly if individuals desire to continue working and living independently.\n\nCurrent employment was a strong predictor of physical inactivity at baseline, with all subjects twice as likely to be physically inactive if they were working. While this may be related to lack of time to engage in physical activity outside of the work setting, this finding has important implications. Lack of physical activity may lead to more functional decline and an inability to continue working. In addition, the cost of lost work days, restricted activity days, mortality, and disability due to diabetes in the United States is high: almost 40 billion dollars in 2002.23 A recent systematic review found that diabetes was related to absenteeism, productivity, and early retirement, thus having significant economic consequences for employers.24 Functional limitations, common in older adults with diabetes, are also found in adults with prediabetes, as noted in the Health and Retirement Study.25 Therefore, strategies in and outside of the workplace to engage all adults, and in particular those with type 2 diabetes, in physical activity may have work-related and wider economic benefits.\n\nThe self-perception of how diabetes may affect the future independence and employment of working adults with diabetes was explored in a sample (n = 190) composed of a majority (87%) of ethnic minority individuals.26 Results indicated that 34% believed their diabetes would affect employment, and 57% felt it would have an effect on their independence. This latter group tended to be younger and in poor physical and mental health. Testing interventions to improve both physical activity and general health may allow those with diabetes to remain productive in the workplace.\n\nThe effect of a lifestyle intervention on lost productivity and disability was tested in a sample of working adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity.27 The intervention consisted of sessions with a dietitian to set goals related to national dietary recommendations. The dietitian also measured waist circumference and weight and followed laboratory results. At 4 months, there were significant differences in the intervention group as compared with usual care in work days lost (P ≤ .05) and disability (P = .003). In addition, there continued to be significant differences at each time point through 12 months. Efforts are needed to assist working patients with type 2 diabetes in incorporating routine physical activity into a working lifestyle. Use of a pedometer may assist in goal setting, increased daily physical activity, and improved glycemic control, as was noted in a sample of subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.28 In this study, subjects were given a structured education program to promote walking, in addition to a pedometer. At 12 months, the intervention group had significant increases in walking and significant decreases in 2-hour postchallenge glucose and fasting glucose as compared with the control group.\n\nSeveral studies have examined the effects of interventions on improving physical activity in type 2 diabetes. The Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study (IDES) examined the effect of an intensive exercise intervention plus physical activity counseling as compared with a control group receiving only physical activity counseling.29 Both groups significantly increased total physical activity levels (P < .001), but the intensive intervention resulted in significantly greater total weekly physical activity (P < .001) and improved cardiovascular risk as compared with the control. Given these results, more intensive strategies may be needed to promote and maintain higher physical activity levels in this population, particularly those who are at high risk of continuing physical inactivity.\n\nThe factor most strongly associated with physical inactivity at 5 years was physical inactivity at baseline. Subjects were more than 3 times more likely to be inactive at 5 years if they were inactive at baseline. In DIAD, while levels of physical activity were low, participants did not suffer from functional limitations and would have been able to participate in a program to enhance physical activity. This suggests that early assessment of patterns of physical activity is an important component of diabetes care. Unfortunately, exercise as therapy has often failed in primary care settings despite the knowledge that exercise is an important lifestyle intervention to treat type 2 diabetes.30 A physician counseling intervention has led to improvement in physical activity in patients with type 2 diabetes when using a structured counseling approach followed by phone follow-up.31 At 12 months, 69% of the intervention group were achieving target levels of physical activity, as compared with 18% of the control group (P < .001).\n\nImportant differences between men and women were noted at both time points. Knowledge of these factors may assist in identifying men and women at high risk of physical inactivity over time. For men only, in addition to lower level of education, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, and measures of obesity (BMI, increased waist circumference), current employment, living alone, and higher levels of A1C and HDL were predictors of inactivity. Although this HDL result is seemingly contradictory, the level of HDL was measured only at baseline and may have changed during the 5 years of the study.\n\nFor women, in addition to lower levels of education, working, measures of obesity (BMI and waist circumference), peripheral neuropathy, and black ethnicity were found to be an important predictor of physical inactivity. According to NHANES III data, those subjects with type 2 diabetes who were inactive were more likely to be female and African American or Mexican American.17 Similar to this study’s findings, previous research has shown that women with type 2 diabetes mellitus engage in less leisure time physical activity than men do.32 In addition, blacks with diabetes are less likely to engage in physical activity than whites are.33 Addressing specific predictors of inactivity in men and women or racial/ ethnic groups may guide gender- and culturally-appropriate physical activity interventions.\n\nThere were several limitations to the study. Predictors were measured only at baseline and could have changed over the 5 years of the study. Physical activity was measured by self-report and was only a crude estimate of actual hours of activity. In addition, study coordinators found it difficult to assess the type of activity—low, moderate, and heavy physical activity—and amount of hours, so only total hours were used."
