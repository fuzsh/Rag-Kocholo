        "meta_description": "Introduction The BIG project (‘Bewegung als Investition in die Gesundheit’, ie, ‘Movement as Investment in Health’) was developed in 2005 as a community-based participatory research programme to offer accessible opportunities for physical activity to women in difficult life situations. Since then, the programme has been expanded to eight sites in Germany. A systematic evaluation of BIG is currently being conducted. As part of this effort, we strive to understand the preferences of participating women for different aspects of the programme, and to analyse their willingness to pay.\n\nMethods and analysis In this protocol, we describe the development and analysis plan of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to investigate participants’ preferences for a physical activity programme for women in difficult life situations. The experiment will be embedded in a questionnaire covering several aspects of participation in the programme (eg, reach, efficacy and further effects) and the socioeconomic characteristics of all active participants. After a thorough search of the literature, BIG documents review and expert interviews, we identified five important attributes of the programme: course times, travel time to the course venue, additional social activities organised by BIG, consideration of wishes and interests for the further planning of courses and costs per course unit. Thereafter, we piloted the experiment with a sample of participants from the target group. After data collection, the experiment will be analysed using a conditional logit model and a latent class analysis to assess eventual heterogeneity in preferences.\n\nEthics and dissemination Understanding women’s preferences will provide useful insights for the further development of the programme and ultimately increase participation and retention. The questionnaire, the included DCE and the pretest on participants received ethical approval (application no. 20-247_1-B). We plan to disseminate the results of the DCE in peer-reviewed journals, national conferences and among participants and programme coordinators and organisers.",

        "text": "Identification of attributes and levels and transfer to the experimental design\n\nThe DCE will be embedded in the questionnaire and will present women with a series of hypothetical comparisons between two physical activity courses with predefined characteristics, asking them to choose which option they like the most.\n\nIn a first step, all programme characteristics (attributes) that might influence individual preferences for participation in BIG courses should be identified. At the same time, appropriate levels of these attributes should be determined. All included attributes should be relevant for the choice of course, should be easily influenced and close to reality, should have a substitutive relation and should not be dominant.34 To identify attributes and their relative levels, we followed a systematic approach. We describe all steps below.\n\nCompilation of evidence (literature search)\n\nThe literature was searched for physical activity programmes/interventions that were evaluated using a DCE. The full search strategy, flow chart and results can be browsed in online supplemental appendix 2. We identified 19 studies, for which we systematically retrieved attributes and corresponding levels. We divided these attributes into meaningful groups: exercise frequency and duration, context, type of exercise, outcomes and goals, schedule, costs, travel time and location, support and other. It is important to note that no study specifically included women exclusively as a target group.\n\nCompilation of evidence (programme specific)\n\nWe reviewed previous documents from the BIG programme (qualitative and quantitative data, protocol of the kick-off meeting) to identify potential attributes and levels in addition to those identified by the literature search. Each document was searched independently by two researchers from the group (AS, SL, AHM and SP). Resulting attributes and levels were then pooled, discussed by the group (SP, AHM, SL and AS) and compared with the results from the systematic literature search (full list available in online supplemental appendix 2).\n\nIn a further step, we selected only attributes that are applicable in the context of the BIG courses and that are already implemented or potentially implementable in the programme. For example, attributes and levels that included mixed classes with men or individual courses were excluded as BIG only offers group courses for women. Furthermore, attributes involving the presence of a personal coach were also excluded as this is not intended or feasible in BIG. Additionally, attributes referring to programmes targeting specific illnesses were also excluded.\n\nThis selection led to a list of 10 potentially important attributes (online supplemental appendix 3), which served as the basis for discussion with the experts in the following step.\n\nConsultation with experts\n\nThis step involved an online discussion of the previously identified list of 10 attributes and their respective levels with five ‘BIG experts’. They are BIG course instructors, organisers or long-term participants, who actively took part in shaping BIG courses at their site and who are routinely interviewed and involved in the planning phases of the NU-BIG evaluation. The expert group of women was created at the beginning of the NU-BIG evaluation to implement the grounding principles of community-based participatory research and includes highly motivated women who are active at their sites in different roles. They receive a small compensation payment for their participation and are involved in multiple projects within the NU-BIG evaluation.\n\nIn the meeting, which was headed by SP, AHM and AS, we explained to the experts the goals of the DCE, and we presented them with a first example of trade-off decisions within a fictitious choice set. After this, each attribute and the respective level was thoroughly discussed in the group. Thereby, we specifically asked whether the 10 reported characteristics are relevant ones and whether they represent important drivers in the decision to participate. Furthermore, we discussed their clarity and understandability, and we explicitly asked whether some important aspects might be missing. At the end of the meeting, we also asked the five experts to rank the attributes based on the perceived relevance for participating women with an interactive tool to spark further discussion.\n\nThe discussion led to interesting insights into the reasons for participating from the point of view of the course instructors and organisers. Following this discussion, one additional attribute was identified as an important one (‘flexible intensity of the course’) and two others were reframed in a different way. We report the results of this discussion, including the new list of attributes and levels, in online supplemental appendix 3.\n\nBased on these insights, the list of 11 attributes was analysed further by researchers (SP, AHM and MV). In our screening of the attributes, we ensured that all attributes were relevant for the choice of course and were easily influenced within the BIG programme. Furthermore, we also ensured that they were in a substitutive relation (ie, the worsening of one attribute can be compensated by an improvement in another attribute) and were not dominant (ie, no attribute should be a necessary criterion for or against participation).34 The detailed decision steps and the resulting list of attributes and levels are reported in online supplemental appendix 3. The resulting list includes five attributes, that is, (1) course time, (2) travel time to the BIG course, (3) additional activities organised by BIG, (4) consideration of wishes or interests and (5) costs per course unit. Based on discussion with the experts, we decided to keep some attributes fixed, that is, to introduce an initial statement clarifying that all courses would have specific characteristics. These include the presence of childcare, the presence of trial lessons, course duration and the framework (eg, the hall is not visible from the outside). These fixed attributes are in fact usual components of all BIG courses that are already implemented to reduce barriers to participation.\n\nPretest with participants\n\nBased on the selected attributes and levels, a preliminary experimental design was conducted to prepare a full DCE for a pretest. We tested the full DCE questionnaire with a set of voluntary participants from the target group. To this end, we recruited participating women and performed semistructured qualitative interviews using the think aloud technique based on a topic guide until a saturation of new content was achieved.35 36 This led us to include six women from two BIG sites (Erlangen and Nürnberg). The interviews were carried out by telephone and were recorded after asking for the consent of the participants. The interviewee was asked to read a paper version of the questionnaire that was previously sent by mail, and loudly report her thoughts and choices. The notes and recordings of the phone call were then revised by the interviewer (SP) and by a second researcher (MV), in order to identify the main problems and any improvements necessary.\n\nWe are aware that both samples selected for the expert interviews and the pretest might not be representative of the targeted population of participating women. However, it was impossible for the study team to directly access participants from the study population (the study was planned before late spring 2022, when only selected courses were taking place because of COVID-19 restrictions). The potential bias induced by this issue will be considered in the final evaluation.\n\nIn the pre-test with participants, we paid particular attention to the following criteria:\n\nAre all the most important attributes included in the DCE?\n\nIs one or more of the included attributes dominant?\n\nAre all levels appropriate?\n\nAre the task and the questionnaire understandable and feasible?\n\nThe interviews followed a prespecified outline and were recorded for quality assurance and analysed using content analysis methods by two researchers (SP and MV).37 This step led to a general confirmation of the understandability of the experiment among women with different backgrounds, linguistic skills and from different cities. The task was understood properly, and all women engaged in the trade-offs proposed in the DCE with ease. Drawing from the feedback of participating women, we made some adjustments in missing context information (eg, the courses take place only during the week, the number of appointments was specified). Furthermore, we modified the range of costs per training unit proposed in the DCE. Initially, we considered a price range between €0 and €5 per training unit, with €1 intervals (the levels were: €0, €1, €2, €3, €4 and €5). However, the price was perceived as an irrelevant attribute by the participants, as even the highest level was considered very affordable and comparable with the levels below. Based on specific indications of participating women on the price of courses that they currently participate in (up to €8 per course unit), we decided to increase the price range to €9.5. Furthermore, we received mixed feedback regarding including the level €0: although some women perceived this as very advantageous, others interpreted this as a sign of poor quality. As we assume linearity in the cost attribute, we decided to eliminate this level. The final cost levels thus range between €2 and €9.5, with €1.5 intervals.\n\nFinal attributes and levels included\n\nThe final list of attributes and levels included in the DCE is reported in table 1 (original language version in online supplemental appendix 4). We included five attributes, with a varying number of levels. The first attribute is the course time, that is, when the course takes place during the day. For this attribute, we considered four levels: early morning, morning, afternoon and evening. The second attribute represents the travel time needed to reach the course location. This encompasses three levels: maximum 10, 20 or 30 min. The third attribute represents the possibility of organised social activities within the BIG course, such as joint breakfasts (called ‘women’s breakfasts’) or dinners where all participating women are invited to socialise outside of the courses. This attribute has two levels: activities are organised or not. The fourth attribute considers the possibility of listening to participants’ interests and wishes, to be considered in the further planning of courses. Also, this attribute is a binary one, that is, either interests/wishes are considered or not. The final attribute is the cost of a course unit, ranging from €2 to €9.5 in €1.5 intervals. Besides a clear preference for lower costs per course unit, a priori we cannot hypothesise which levels will be preferred by women.\n\nPlanned analyses\n\nThe included population will be described with respect to their sociodemographic characteristics drawing from the information collected in the NU-BIG questionnaire.\n\nRespondents with missing information in more than half of the choice sets (>4) will be excluded from the analysis. All other women will be eligible for the analysis.\n\nIn order to estimate the preference weight of each level within each attribute, we will analyse the DCE data using a conditional logit model. Thereby, we will calculate the relative importance of attributes, using an effects-coding procedure.41 In a further step, we will express the preference weights as money equivalents (ie, as the marginal rate of substitution between the attributes and the cost attribute), in order to compute the marginal WTP for a change in the level of the attributes.31\n\nThe target population of women who participate in BIG courses is likely to be a heterogeneous one, especially with regard to sociodemographic characteristics, which might impact preferences (eg, presence of children in the household, migration background and linguistic barriers, religious affiliation, etc). First, we will describe how the surveyed population (ie, women who participate in BIG courses between summer 2022 and winter 2022/2023) coincides with the intended target population of women in difficult life situations targeted by the BIG programme. Second, we will carry out a latent class analysis in order to explore the underlying heterogeneity and identify classes of women with different preferences. We will also analyse whether these classes will be different according to age, employment status, education, income, number of children, marital status, health status, migration status and religious affiliation (see table 2 for details).31 All analyses will be conducted using R-studio.42"
