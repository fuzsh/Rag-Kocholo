        "text": "2.1 Clutch model of cell adhesion\n\nTo model the adhesion dynamics, we adopt previous clutch models (see [5, 15, 10] for details). The clutch hypothesis considers a contractile acto-myosin network that pulls on the CAMs bound to the ECM. Different cell types respond to the intracellular pulling forces in different ways because cells express specific types of CAMs. Some cells, e.g. neurons [5], express slip bonds: the life-time of the bond decreases exponentially as the force increases. Other cells, such as fibroblasts, express catch bonds, that is the lifetime first increases and then decreases exponentially with force. To consider these differences and the specific adhesion dynamics, the clutch model considers that a number of molecular clutches binds to the ECM with a constant rate kon, and unbinds with a dissociation rate , that depends on force as\n\nThe first term in Eq. 1 alone, represents a slip bond. and and and are the unloaded dissociation rates and the characteristic bond rupture forces in the slip and catch pathways respectively. Fc is force per molecular clucth. Some cells also show a reinforcement mechanism when the talin rod unfolds and vinculin binds to the unfolded domains, which promotes the increase of integrin density. Consequently, the traction forces that the cell exerts on the ECM rises [10].\n\nThe clutch model predicts the actin velocity, , and tractions, P, as a function of the ECM stiffness (Fig. 2). We focus here on cells expressing slip bonds, as a case of non-reinforced bonds, and cells expressing reinforced catch bonds (all model parameters are in Table SI).\n\n2.2 Minimal active gel model for cell migration\n\nTo explore the role of the adhesion mechanics in cell migration, we build a minimal active gel model for cell migration [41]. We consider a 1D domain, Î©, with moving coordinates x(t) â [lr(t), lf (t)]. lr(t) and lf (t) represents the rear and front boundaries of the cell and, therefore, the cell length is determined as L(t) = lf (t) â lr(t) (Fig. 1), where f and r indicate the front and rear of the cell.\n\nWe model the mechanics of the acto-myosin network as a contractile viscous gel, that represents the retrograde flow, in contact with the ECM [40, 43, 41, 31, 1]. We assume that viscous forces dominate the elastic forces and that inertial forces are negligible. Therefore, the balance of linear momentum for the active gel is is the constitutive relation of the network stress, which accounts for the viscosity of the actin network and the myosin contractility, respectively. The right hand side of the balance of linear momentum represents the friction between the network flow and the ECM, with friction parameter Î·. vF is the velocity of the retrograde flow, ÂµF is the shear viscosity, Î¶ the active contraction exerted by the myosin motors and ÏM and ÏF are the densities of myosin motors and F-actin, respectively (see details below). We impose zero stresses on the cell boundaries so that there are not pushing or pulling forces on the network, which allows us to compute the resulting retrograde flow at the cell boundaries.\n\nA second differentiated actin network polymerizes against the membrane [39, 37], which increases the membrane tension and, in turn, reduces the polymerization velocity [12, 44]. Filaments grow freely with velocity if there is no opposing force to it [32]. is the rate of actin assembly and Î´ is the size of one single monomer at the tip of the filament. When the membrane tension increases, the actin polymerization decreases as [32, 26, 23], where Ïstall is a tension required to stall the polymerization of the actin network and z is a model parameter that controls the velocity decay. We assume that actin polymerization is symmetric and vp is equal at both sides of the cell. The membrane tension, Ï, follows a simple Hookean law such that Ï (L(t)) = k(L(t) â Lb), where k is the spring constant and Lb = L0 + Lr accounts for the resting length, L0, and the buffer membrane length Lr in reservoirs and foldings of the cell membrane. Therefore, membrane tension starts to increase once all reservoirs and membrane folds have flatten, i.e L(t) > Lb. We assume zero compressive stresses when L(t) < Lb.\n\nThe outward polymerization velocities, , compete against the cell membrane with the inward retrograde flow velocity to expand or retract the cell rear and front of the cell with velocity , respectively (Fig. 1). Then, we compute the cell migration velocity as .\n\nThe distribution of the F-actin density, ÏF (x, t), is modeled as where the right hand side includes the polymerization and depolymerization terms with rates kp and kd, respectively. DF is the diffusive parameter of the F-actin. We write the transport equations in the cell frame and, accordingly, we define the velocity of the F-actin network as w = vF â v. We impose zero fluxes on the cell boundaries to reflect that no F-actin can enter or leave the cell domain. Similarly, we model the myosin motors bound to the F-actin network [43, 2, 41], ÏM, as\n\nD is the effective diffusion parameter [2, 41]. The bound myosin also obeys zero flux boundary conditions to describe that no bound myosin motors can enter or leave the cell. All model parameters are summarized in Table SII.\n\n3.1 Cell adhesion explains positive and negative durotaxis\n\nTo analyze the exposure of cells to exogenous stimuli in the form of a shallow or a highly localized stiffness gradients, we use samples of varying length (200, 500 and 1000 Âµm) with stiffnesses between 0.1 and 100kPa [10] (Fig. 2a). The clutch model predicts traction stresses and retrograde flow as a function of the ECM rigidity and bonds behaviour (see Fig. 2a and Materials and Methods). Then, an effective friction can be obtained to inform an active gel model for cell migration (see Materials and Methods) about the asymmetry that the stiffness gradient induce in the cell-ECM friction.\n\nWe initially seed cells at three different locations of the sample to study how the absolute value of the substrate stiffness, and not only its gradient, may regulate the durotactic response. We consider that cells undergo durotaxis if the migration velocity is larger than v=1 nm/s, otherwise we assume that they spread and remain stationary. We analyze the process during the first 20 minutes, when the durotactic response is already apparent.\n\nCells seeded in the sample of 1000 Âµm in length do not express durotaxis. However, there is a strong durotactic response in cells seeded on the 200 Âµm-length sample. Cells seeded on the 500 Âµm-length sample also sustain durotaxis but at a lower degree. In the three samples (200, 500 and 1000 Âµm), the strongest durotactic response is obtained for cells located at the center of the sample (E â 1-10 kPa). This is due to a large friction gradient (Fig. 2b) and an absolute friction that enable the intracellular polarization.\n\nIn terms of migration direction (Fig. 2c), all cells with reinforced adhesions moves toward the positive stiffness gradient of the ECM with similar migration velocities that peak for substrate rigidities between 0.1-1 kPa. However, without reinforcement, cells can migrate toward positive or negative stiffness gradients of the ECM. Cells located on the left of the optimal rigidity (E = 0.1-1 kPa) undergo positive durotaxis. Cells located at the stiffest region of the samples, above 10 kPa, and where no friction gradient exists, show a weak durotactic response and stay mostly stationary. However, cells located just on the right of the optimal rigidity, E â 1-10 kPa, express negative durotaxis. This is because of a negative friction gradient. For the strongest durotactic expression, in the 200 Âµm-length sample and for cells seeded on the right of the optimal rigidity, the maximum migration velocity is v â 8 nm/s. Cells seeded on the left of the optimal rigidity migrate with v â 4.5 nm/s. However, cells seeded on E â 10-100 kPa show a weak durotactic response.\n\nTo understand the physical mechanisms behind durotaxis, we further analyze the model results for the strongest durotactic response (right of the optimal rigidity, 200 Âµm sample) of cells expressing slip bonds (Fig. 2a,c). We analyze the model during 20 min, when the migration velocity is maximum. The actomyosin network polarizes (Fig. 2d) because of an asymmetric retrograde flow (Fig. 2e) that results from asymmetric adhesion forces. The asymmetric retrograde flow and the constant polymerization velocity at both cell edges makes one side of the cell to protrude faster than the other, which establishes the cell front (Fig. 2f). Cells elongates 4-fold from the initial length and the cell membrane reaches a tension of â 60 pN/nm (Fig. S1), similar to previous experimental data [46]. The stress of the actomyosin network is mostly symmetric with a maximum at the cell center of 50 Pa (Fig. S1). This result indicates that the actomyosin network imposes a traction on the nuclear region of the cell, which is also in agreement with previous results on the mechanosensitivity of the cell nucleus [9]. All other cases of durotaxis shown in Fig. 2 exhibit similar results, with the model variables polarized towards the positive or negative direction, depending on the direction of the friction polarization, and a smaller or larger polarization depending on the strength of the durotaxis response (Fig. S2). All cases with spreading signatures (see Fig. 2) show an almost symmetric distribution of all models variables (Fig. S3).\n\nAt steady state (Fig. 3), the friction values are symmetric and large enough to significantly reduce the retrograde flow, which reduces the front-rear differences between the inward flow and the outward actin polymerization velocity and, consequently, cells get into an stationary spreading-like phase.\n\nTo further analyse the durotaxis dynamics as cells travel along the sample until they reach a steady state (reached when cells stop and no longer migrate), we focus on the three cases (Fig. S3): the two slip cases of cells initially seeded on the left and right of the optimum rigidity in the 200 Âµm-length sample (strong positive and negative durotaxis expression, respectively, Fig. 2c) and the reinforced case with cells seeded on the stiff side, E â 30 kPa, of the 200 Âµm-length sample (positive durotaxis expression, Fig. 2c). As cells migrate, they travel through regions of different stiffnesses (Fig. S3b-d) and, therefore, the friction computed through the clutch model also changes in space and time (Fig. 3b-d). In the slip cases, cells migrate toward the optimal rigidity location and stop when they reach it (Fig. 3b and Fig. 3a). Cells stall at the optimal rigidity because they reach a symmetric distribution of the adhesion forces, which reverses the durotactic mode into the symmetric spreading phase (Fig. 3a-c). The non-motile steady state is reached at â 1 and 4 hrs for cells expressing negative and positive durotaxis, respectively (Fig. 3). For the reinforced case, where no optimal rigidity exists, cells stall when they reach a friction of â 4.5 kPa Â· s/Âµm2 at a stiffness of â 60 kPa.\n\n3.3 Engineering durotaxis\n\nFinally, we further explore possibilities for engineering durotaxis other than the matrix features where cells are seeded. Specifically, we are interested in physical quantities that may enhance, arrest or shift durotaxis. Our results above indicate that cell adhesion, in particular the asymmetric distribution of the adhesion strength, controls durotaxis. Therefore, we should arrest durotaxis when the traction force vanishes, are too high or there is no friction gradients, enhance it when the friction gradient increases, in combination with placing cells in specific stiffnesses, and shift the durotactic direction if the friction gradient changes sign. We focus on adhesion parameters that can clearly induce these changes in the adhesion behaviour and that are prone to be manipulated in-vitro and in-vivo. To do so, we performed a parametric analysis of different adhesion models parameters (the binding rate kont, the slip part of the off-rate in all the unbinding models koff,slip, the catch part of the unbinding rate, koff,catch, the number of integrins added to the system intadd and the rate of vinculin attachment konv). We show in Fig. 5 the specific values of the model parameters and the resulting traction.\n\nAmong the different possibilities prone to change durotaxis, we present one case of enhancement, arrest and direction shifting of durotaxis for each adhesion case. We show that in the pure catch case, where the maximum migration velocity in the control case is â 5 nm/s, we can enhance durotaxis by decreasing the off-rate of the catch bond (Fig. 5a,c). We show that the migration velocity increases to 12 nm/s (Fig. 5c). We also demonstrate a shift in the migration direction when the off-rate the integrin increases. These two modification are enable by increasing and decreasing the rigidity gradient, respectively. To shift the direction of migration, i.e. to shift the gradient sign, we increase the on binding rate of the integrin. Similarly, for the reinforced case (Fig. 5b), we can foster durotaxis by increasing the off-rate of the catch part of the bond. In this case, the migration velocity increases from â 5 nm/s in the control case to â 7 nm/s (Fig. 5d). We can arrest durotaxis by increasing the recruitment of integrins to the AC, which creates friction large enough to significantly reduce the retrograde flow. Finally, we can also shift the durotaxis direction, with a remarkable enhancement in the migration velocity of â 12 nm/s (Fig. 5d), by reducing the on rate of vinculin to talin. This inhibition of vinculin binding cancels the adhesion reinforcement and, at the same time, increase the friction gradient (see also Fig. 4)."
