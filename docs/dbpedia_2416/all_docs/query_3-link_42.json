        "text": "Thank you for joining us. Our readers would enjoy discovering something interesting about you. What are you in the middle of right now that you’re excited about personally or professionally?\n\nI am thrilled to announce that I have been creating emotional intelligence workshops for various organizations. I aim to assist leaders in gaining a deeper understanding of themselves and establishing trust within their teams. This is an excellent opportunity to empower others and boost their self-assurance. I am genuinely passionate about this work!\n\nCurrently, I am working on writing another book aimed at unlocking a deeper understanding of how we can create environments that foster the growth of our leaders. While it is essential to help leaders understand themselves, we must also prioritize creating workspaces that enable them to excel.\n\nAlso, I’m organizing personal development retreats called “Authentic You Masterclasses.” These retreats allow individuals to take a break from their busy lives and reflect on their personal growth. Some individuals may need help with going deeper and doing the work. Still, these retreats provide a fun and effective way to unlock their potential and enhance their personal and professional development.\n\nWe all get by with a bit of help from our friends. Who is the leader that has influenced you the most, and how?\n\nFortunately, I had a leader who saw my potential even when I didn’t. Tom Gyles was charismatic and cheerful, allowing people to develop and grow. His support and encouragement empowered me to go beyond my personal goals. Effective leadership like Tom’s can significantly impact people’s lives, and it’s essential to recognize leaders’ influence on others.\n\nSometimes our biggest mistakes lead to our most significant discoveries. What’s the biggest mistake you’ve made as a leader, and what did you discover as a result?\n\nI don’t view mistakes as failures as long as they offer an opportunity to learn and grow. From my experiences, I’ve realized that leadership driven solely by ego can ultimately lead to self-destruction. It can create an unhealthy dependence on external validation, leaving you constantly searching for recognition and never truly feeling satisfied. The desire for promotions and bonuses may seem enticing, but you will need more than the fulfillment you crave.\n\nUnfortunately, many leaders allow their egos to take control, resulting in disastrous outcomes. Prioritizing personal ego over the success of the team or organization can cause multiple issues.\n\nLeaders who prioritize their ego tend to prioritize their image over accomplishing tasks. Rather than focusing on doing good, they prioritize looking good, causing various issues such as a lack of progress and conflicts among team members. Additionally, ego-led leaders are often resistant, hindering growth and progress. Lastly, their desire for control and power can create a toxic environment that breeds fear and resentment among team members, which isn’t conducive to collaboration or creativity.\n\nSelf-awareness is crucial as it helps combat the ego-centric mindset. At times, individuals like myself may be unaware of their ego-driven actions. Knowing oneself can significantly transform the approach toward success. I have understood that an alternate path exists, where one is in harmony with their true self and no longer reliant on others to boost their ego.\n\nHow has your definition of leadership changed or evolved over time? What does it mean to be a leader now?\n\nDescribing leadership’s meaning can be intricate and complex as it differs among individuals and changes with time. Nowadays, being a leader entails more than just issuing orders or having a position of power. It necessitates possessing a broad range of abilities and characteristics to achieve success.\n\nEffective leadership demands a thorough comprehension of human behavior’s intricacies and the capacity to motivate and inspire others. This encompasses communication, collaboration, problem-solving, and decision-making.\n\nAuthentic leadership is centered around comprehending people and their needs, exhibiting bravery in taking action, and making choices that will serve the greater good. It involves the assurance to take risks and the discernment to recognize when to do so.\n\nAdditionally, leadership entails listening attentively, learning from others, and being open to novel ideas and viewpoints. It also requires the humility to acknowledge mistakes and the perseverance to continue moving and overcoming them.\n\nLeadership demands both courage and humility. A competent leader must have the strength to stand up for their beliefs while also being sensitive to the needs and perspectives of others. Leadership is a complex and ever-evolving skill, but with the right qualities and abilities, anyone can succeed as a leader.\n\nSuccess is as often about what we stop as what we start. What is one legacy leadership behavior you stopped because you discovered it was no longer valuable or relevant?\n\nI strive to make decisions based on the greater good of the group rather than letting my ego dictate my actions. Now I have tapped into my intuition and my empathy.\n\nEmpathy is a valuable trait for any leader. If you can learn to empathize with others, you’ll be able to build stronger relationships, resolve conflicts, and make better decisions.\n\nWhat is one lasting leadership behavior you started or are cultivating because you believe it is valuable or relevant?\n\nBeing a leader with empathy is one of the most crucial qualities to possess. Empathy enables you to perceive situations from other individuals’ points of view and comprehend their emotions and necessities. With empathy, you can establish stronger connections, solve conflicts, and make informed decisions.\n\nHere are some of the benefits of empathy in leadership:\n\n1. Empathy builds better relationships.\n\nBuilding a solid relationship with someone becomes easier when you can empathize with them. Empathy allows you to connect with others and establish a foundation of trust and mutual respect.\n\n2. Empathy resolves conflicts.\n\nHaving the ability to see both perspectives in a conflict can lead to a mutually agreed-upon solution. Empathy plays a crucial role in comprehending the necessities of both parties, ultimately resulting in a satisfactory compromise for all involved.\n\n3. Empathy makes better decisions.\n\nBeing able to perceive how your decisions will impact others can lead to choices that benefit everyone. Empathy is crucial in enabling you to weigh the outcomes of your actions and make impartial and equitable decisions.\n\nWhat advice would you offer to other leaders who are stuck in past playbooks and patterns and may be having a hard time letting go of what made them successful in the past?\n\nBeing an authentic leader can offer numerous advantages, such as discovering oneself and attaining alignment with truth. Authentic leadership is leading from a place of genuineness and staying true to oneself. Although it can be challenging, the benefits are significant. Here are some helpful tips to guide you to authentic leadership.\n\n1. Be true to yourself.\n\nIt may appear as common knowledge, but it’s essential to reiterate that to become a genuine leader, you must stay true to yourself. This involves acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses, values and beliefs, and objectives and ambitions. It also entails accepting and being at ease with your own identity.\n\n2. Know your audience.\n\nWhen communicating, it is crucial to identify your audience and their interests. Is it a team of employees, prospective customers, or investors? The trick is to customize your message to suit your listeners and provide them with what they desire.\n\n3. Be transparent.\n\nGenuine leaders are forthright about their intentions and actions. They don’t attempt to conceal their errors or achievements. Instead, they are candid and truthful with all those they collaborate with.\n\n4. Be authentic.\n\nThis may seem like a no-brainer, but it’s worth mentioning. Being authentic doesn’t mean being perfect. It means being yourself, flaws and all. It means being genuine and honest in everything you do.\n\n5. Lead by example.\n\nThe most effective way to teach others about authentic leadership is through leading by example. By demonstrating the behavior you wish to encourage in others, they will be more likely to emulate it.\n\n6. Encourage others to be authentic.\n\nOne of the most important things you can do as an authentic leader is to encourage others to be their true selves. Create an environment where people feel safe to be themselves and to express their ideas and opinions.\n\n7. Be open to feedback.\n\nAuthentic leaders are always open to feedback, both positive and negative. They know feedback is essential for growth and are willing to listen to others.\n\n8. Be vulnerable.\n\nBeing vulnerable doesn’t mean being weak. It takes much strength to be vulnerable. Being vulnerable means being open to new ideas and ways of doing things. It means being willing to put yourself out there and to take risks.\n\n9. Practice what you preach.\n\nIt’s not enough to talk about being an authentic leader. You have actually to practice it. Live your life in a way true to your values and beliefs. Be the person you want others to be.\n\n10. Never give up.\n\nThe journey to authentic leadership is always challenging. There will be times when you feel like giving up. But don’t. Keep going. The rewards are worth it.\n\nMany of our readers can relate to the challenge of leading people for the first time. What advice would you offer to new and emerging leaders?\n\nDetermining the best advice for new leaders is complex, as it varies based on the situation and context. Nevertheless, there are a few fundamental principles that can help upcoming leaders achieve success.\n\nNew leaders must prioritize communication, set clear objectives, and earn trust. Furthermore, it is essential to be open to feedback and to learn and develop as a leader continually.\n\nBy following these principles, new and emerging leaders can establish themselves as successful leaders and positively impact their organizations.\n\nBased on your experience or research, what are the top five traits effective leaders exemplify now? Please share a story or an example for each.\n\nLeadership is a complex and multifaceted concept, but there are certain qualities that all successful leaders share. Here are the top five traits that effective leaders exemplify:\n\n1. Vision: A great leader has a clear vision of where they want to take their team and how to get there. They are able to articulate their vision in a way that inspires and motivates others to follow.\n\n2. Integrity: A leader must be honest and trustworthy. They must be willing to take responsibility for their actions and be accountable for their decisions.\n\n3. Communication: A leader must communicate effectively with their team. They must be able to listen to others and understand their needs and concerns.\n\n4. Empathy: A leader must be able to put themselves in their team members’ shoes and understand their perspectives. They must be able to show compassion and understanding.\n\n5. Resilience: A leader must stay focused and motivated in the face of adversity. They must remain positive and keep their team motivated even when things get tough.\n\nThese five traits are essential for any leader who wants to be successful. By embodying these qualities, a leader can inspire their team to reach their goals and succeed.\n\nAmerican Basketball Coach John Wooden said, “Make each day your masterpiece.” How do you embody that quote? We welcome a story or example.\n\nCreating the world you want to live in is important to me. It begins with a clear vision of what you want that world to look like. My world is one filled with kindness and compassion, free from violence and hate, and committed to sustainability for the environment.\n\nEvery day, I ask myself how I show up and contribute to the world. I aim to assist individuals and organizations in empowering their leaders to adapt to the ever-evolving workplace. I also aim to support organizations and leaders in transitioning to a purpose-driven culture, enabling businesses to unlock their hidden potential and create a culture of success. Companies can reach their goals and establish a productive and enjoyable workplace when purpose, culture, and leadership are harmonious.\n\nIn your local community, you have the power to make a positive impact by joining organizations that are committed to making it a better place. You can volunteer your time and skills to help others and contribute to a brighter future.\n\nWhile it may seem daunting, it’s important to remember that everyone starts somewhere. By taking the first step towards your vision and actively working towards it, you can play a key role in creating the world you want to see.\n\nWhat is the legacy you aspire to leave as a leader?\n\nAs an author and speaker, I’m dedicated to enlightening individuals on the immense significance of emotional intelligence and self-awareness in leadership. It’s high time we avoid the inaccurate notion that external factors are the only means to success. This flawed concept feeds our ego and leads to an incessant sense of inadequacy. It’s essential to recognize the immense power within ourselves and tap into our innate potential. Self-doubt and uncertainty often hinder our progress, but we must acknowledge that we’re all unique and possess exceptional talents waiting to be unleashed. Let’s unlock our potential by embracing our strengths and realizing we can achieve greatness.\n\nAs a leader, it’s crucial to acknowledge the advantages of self-discovery. By dedicating time to discovering our strengths and weaknesses, we can unleash and utilize our exceptional abilities to build a meaningful legacy. Self-discovery is an all-encompassing journey that empowers us to recognize and leverage our potential to make a positive difference in the world.\n\nThrough self-discovery, we can unleash our potential as leaders and significantly impact the world. By acknowledging our strengths and weaknesses, we can leverage them to our advantage and create a positive legacy that will endure for generations. Effective leadership requires a deep understanding of oneself, and with self-discovery as our guide, we can achieve greatness and become the best version of ourselves. Let’s embrace the power of self-discovery and change the world for the better.\n\nHow can our readers connect with you to continue the conversation?\n\nHolle Consulting.com\n\nKristinaholle.com\n\nWebsite: https://kristinaholle.com/\n\nInstagram: Kristinamhollereal\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheAuthentic\n\nLinkedIn Kristinamholle"
