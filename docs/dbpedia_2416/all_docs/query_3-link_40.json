        "text": "Thank you to everyone who helped #CelebrateWabash on our 2024 Day of Giving. Through your gifts, challenges, celebrations, and outreach, you celebrated the people, programs, and campus places that make Wabash so very special. Alumni, families, friends, and the campus community raised more than $1.65 million for Wabash students in a single day.\n\nWe asked the Wabash Nation to participate, and you responded with astounding enthusiasm. You rose to meet our $500,000 Lead Challenge, not just by reaching the goal of 5,000 gifts, but by setting a new record of more than 7,800. You attended events and posted poignant and heartfelt tributes, which unlocked an additional $222,000. This Surprise Challenge set a goal of 11,000 celebrations; you gave us more than 12,300.\n\nWhen the totals are finalized, we will celebrate them here and on the College’s website. Until then, on behalf of our students, thank you for your sincere and selfless support that will elevate their Wabash experience.\n\nStudents, Faculty, and Staff Challenge\n\nWabash Board of Trustee and National Annual Fund Chair Chris Braun ’81 knows firsthand and values the importance of paying it forward to Wabash. In this spirit, he challenges the entire campus to support the College with their philanthropy. For each faculty, staff, and student who makes a gift of any amount this fiscal year, Chris and his wife, Trish, will give an additional $20 to the College. If 100% of the campus gives, due to the power and value of a Wabash education, Chris’s financial contribution to Wabash on the Day of Giving will exceed what his parents made in an entire year when he attended Wabash. Let's all join Chris and Trish in paying it forward to Wabash by meeting their challenge on the 2024 Day of Giving as we #CelebrateWabash.\n\nGifts from Faculty/Staff:\n\n793\n\nGifts from Students:\n\n827\n\n*Unlike gift totals, individual donor statistics can only be calculated manually. Advancement staff will track student giving percentages and will provide updates on any milestones throughout the day."
