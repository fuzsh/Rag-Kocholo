ACTION: Notice of 12-month petition finding. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the northern Mexican gartersnake (Thamnophis eques megalops) as threatened or endangered with critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The petitioners provided three listing scenarios for consideration by the Service: (1) Listing the United States population as a Distinct Population Segment (DPS); (2) listing Thamnophis eques megalops throughout its range in the United States and Mexico based on its rangewide status; or (3) listing Thamnophis eques megalops throughout its range in the United States and Mexico based on its status in the United States. After thorough analysis and review of all available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing of the subspecies, under any of the three scenarios, is not warranted. Of the three listing scenarios specified above, we found scenario two provided the most rigorous evaluation of the status of the northern Mexican gartersnake and herein provide detailed discussion of our conclusions in that context. We also provide additional discussion of our evaluation of scenarios (1) listing the United States population as a DPS and (3) listing Thamnophis eques megalops throughout its range in the United States and Mexico based on its status in the United States. DATES: The finding announced in this document was made on September 26, 2006. ADDRESSES: The complete supporting file for this finding is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the Arizona Ecological Services Office, 2321 West Royal Palm Road, Suite 103, Phoenix, AZ 85021-4951. Please submit any new information, materials, comments, or questions concerning this species or this finding to the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Spangle, Field Supervisor, Arizona Ecological Services Office (see ADDRESSES) 602-242-0210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), requires that, for any petition to revise the Lists of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife and Plants that contains substantial scientific and commercial information that listing may be warranted, we make a finding within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted, but that the immediate proposal of a regulation implementing the petitioned action is precluded by other pending proposals to determine whether any species is threatened or endangered, and expeditious progress is being made to add or remove qualified species from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. Section 4(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires that a petition for which the requested action is found to be warranted but precluded be treated as though resubmitted on the date of such finding, i.e., requiring a subsequent finding to be made within 12 months. Each subsequent 12-month finding will be published in the Federal Register. On December 19, 2003, we received a petition dated December 15, 2003, requesting that we list the northern Mexican gartersnake as threatened or endangered, and that we designate critical habitat concurrently with the listing. The petition, submitted by the Center for Biological Diversity, was clearly identified as a petition for a listing rule and contained the names, signatures, and addresses of the requesting parties. Included in the petition was supporting information regarding the species' taxonomy and ecology, historical and current distribution, present status, and actual and potential causes of decline. We acknowledged the receipt of the petition in a letter to Mr. Noah Greenwald, dated March 1, 2004. In that letter, we also advised the petitioners that, due to funding constraints in fiscal year (FY) 2004, we would not be able to begin processing the petition at that time. On May 17, 2005, the petitioners filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, challenging our failure to issue a 90-day finding in response to the petition as required by 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(3)(A) and (B). In a stipulated settlement agreement, we agreed to submit a 90-day finding to the Federal Register by December 16, 2005, and if positive, submit a 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 15, 2006 [Center for Biological Diversity v. Norton, CV-05-341-TUC-CKJ (D. Az)]. The settlement agreement was signed and adopted by the District Court of Arizona on August 2, 2005. On December 13, 2005, we made our 90-day finding that the petition presented substantial scientific information indicating that listing the northern Mexican gartersnake (Thamnophis eques megalops) may be warranted, but we did not discuss the applicability of any of the three listing scenarios that were provided in the petition. The finding and our initiation of a status review was published in the Federal Register on January 4, 2006 (71 FR 315). We are required, under the court- approved stipulated settlement agreement, to submit to the Federal Register our 12-month finding pursuant to the Act [16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(3)(B)] on or before September 15, 2006. This notice constitutes our 12-month finding for the petition to list the northern Mexican gartersnake as threatened or endangered. Previous Federal Actions The Mexican gartersnake (Thamnophis eques) (which included the subspecies) was placed on the list of candidate species as a Category 2 species in 1985 (50 FR 37958). Category 2 species were those for which existing information indicated that listing was possibly appropriate, but for which substantial supporting biological data to prepare a proposed rule were lacking. In the 1996 Candidate Notice of Review (February 28, 1996; 61 FR 7596), the use of Category 2 candidates was discontinued, and the northern Mexican gartersnake was no longer recognized as a candidate. In addition, on January 4, 2006, we published a 90-day finding on a petition to list the northern Mexican gartersnake (71 FR 315), as discussed above. Biology Species Description. The northern Mexican gartersnake may occur with other native gartersnake species and can be difficult for people without herpetological expertise to identify. With a maximum known length of 44 inches (in) (112 centimeters (cm)), it ranges in background color from olive to olive-brown to olive-gray with three stripes that run the length of the body. The middle dorsal stripe is yellow and darkens toward the tail. The pale yellow to light-tan lateral stripes distinguish the Mexican gartersnake from other sympatric (co-occurring) gartersnake species because a portion of the lateral [[Page 56229]] stripe is found on the fourth scale row, while it is confined to lower scale rows for other species. Paired black spots extend along the olive dorsolateral fields and the olive-gray ventrolateral fields. A conspicuous, light-colored crescent extends behind the corners of the mouth. The two dark brown to black blotches that occur behind the head of several gartersnake species may be diffuse or absent in the Mexican gartersnake. The coloration of the venter is bluish-gray or greenish- grey. The dorsolateral scalation is keeled, the anal plate is single, and there are eight or nine upper labial scales (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 4; Rossman et al. 1996, pp. 171-172). Taxonomy. The northern Mexican gartersnake is a member of the family Colubridae and subfamily Natricinae (harmless live-bearing snakes) (Lawson et al. 2005, p. 596). The taxonomy of the genus Thamnophis has a complex history partly because many of the species are similar in appearance and scutelation (arrangement of scales), but also because many of the early museum specimens were in such poor and faded condition that it was difficult to study them (Conant 2003, p. 6). There are approximately 30 species that have been described in the gartersnake genus Thamnophis (Rossman et al. 1996, p. xvii-xviii). De Queiroz et al. (2002, p. 323) identified two large overlapping clades (related taxonomic groups) of gartersnakes that they called the ``Mexican'' and ``widespread'' clades which were supported by allozyme and mitochondrial DNA genetic analyses. Thamnophis eques is a member of the ``widespread'' clade and is most closely related taxonomically to, although genetically and phenotypically distinct from, the checkered gartersnake (Thamnophis marcianus) (De Queiroz and Lawson 1994, p. 217). Rossman et al. (1996, p. 175) noted that the current specific name eques was not applied at the time of the original description of the holotype because the specimen was mistakenly identified as a black- necked gartersnake (Thamnophis cyrtopsis). In recent history and prior to 2003, Thamnophis eques was considered to have three subspecies, T. e. eques, T. e. megalops, and T. e. virgatenuis (Rossman et al. 1996, p. 175). T. eques displays considerable phenotypic variability (variation in its physical appearance) across its distribution, and all subspecific descriptions under T. eques have been based on morphometrics or morphological characters. The subspecies T. e. eques and T. e. megalops are distinguished by average differences in sub- caudal scale counts, while T. e. virgatenuis is distinguished from T. e. megalops based on having a darker background color and a narrower vertebral stripe (Rossman et al. 1996, p. 175). Rossman et al. (1996, p. 175) also noted that the discontinuous distributions of high- elevation and low-elevation T. e. virgatenuis and T. e. megalops, respectively, are ``zoogeographically peculiar and unique among gartersnakes.'' Rossman et al. (1996, p. 172) describe the distribution of T. e. eques as occurring from southern Nayarit eastward along the Transverse Volcanic Axis to west-central Veracruz, and identified an additional disjunct population in central Oaxaca. T. e. virgatenuis is distributed in three isolated, high-elevation populations in southwestern Durango and in west-central and northwestern Chihuahua (Rossman et al. 1996, p. 172). In 2003, an additional seven new subspecies were identified under T. eques: (1) T. e. cuitzeoensis; (2) T. e. patzcuaroensis; (3) T. e. inspiratus; (4) T. e. obscurus; (5) T. e. diluvialis; (6) T. e. carmenensis; and (7) T. e. scotti (Conant 2003, p. 3). These seven new subspecies were described based on morphological differences in coloration and pattern; have high endemism (degree of restriction to a particular area) with highly restricted distributions; and occur in isolated wetland habitats within the mountainous Transvolcanic Belt region of southern Mexico, which contains the highest elevations in the country (Conant 2003, pp. 7-8). We are not aware of any challenges within the scientific literature of the validity of current taxonomy of any of the 10 subspecies of T. eques. The most widely distributed of the 10 subspecies under Thamnophis eques is the northern Mexican gartersnake (Thamnophis eques megalops), which is the only subspecies that occurs in the United States and the entity we address in this finding. In Mexico, T. e. megalops historically occurred throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental south to Guanajuato, and east across the Mexican Plateau to Hidalgo, which comprised approximately 85 percent of the total rangewide distribution of the species (Rossman et al. 1996, p. 173). Robert Kennicott first described the northern Mexican gartersnake in 1860, as Eutenia megalops from the type locality of Tucson, Arizona (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 2). In 1951, Dr. Hobart Smith renamed the subspecies with its current scientific name (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 3). A summary of this species' lengthy taxonomic history can be found in Rosen and Schwalbe (1988, pp. 2-3). Several common names have been applied to the northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States over the years, such as the Arizona ribbon snake, the Emory's gartersnake, and the Arizona gartersnake (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 2). In summary, while the taxonomic history of Thamnophis eques is robust, we found no indication in the significant body of taxonomic literature we reviewed that its current taxonomy is in doubt or in any way invalid (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 2-3; De Queiroz and Lawson 1994, pp. 215-217; Liner 1994, p. 107; Rossman et al. 1996, pp. 171, 175; Conant 2003, p. 6; Crother et al. 2000, p. 72; 2003, p. 202; De Queiroz et al. 2002, p. 327). Habitat. Throughout its rangewide distribution, the northern Mexican gartersnake occurs at elevations from 130 to 8,497 feet (ft) (40 to 2,590 meters (m)) (Rossman et al. 1996, p. 172). The northern Mexican gartersnake is considered a riparian obligate (restricted to riparian areas when not engaged in dispersal behavior) and occurs chiefly in the following general habitat types: (1) Source-area wetlands [e.g., cienegas (mid-elevation wetlands with highly organic, reducing (basic, or alkaline) soils), stock tanks (small earthen impoundment), etc.]; (2) large river riparian woodlands and forests; and (3) streamside gallery forests (as defined by well-developed broadleaf deciduous riparian forests with limited, if any, herbaceous ground cover or dense grass) (Hendrickson and Minckley 1984, p. 131; Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 14-16; Arizona Game and Fish Department 2001). Vegetation characteristics vary based on the type of habitat. For example, in source-area wetlands, dense vegetation consists of knot grass (Paspalum distichum), spikerush (Eleocharis), bulrush (Scirpus), cattail (Typha), deergrass (Muhlenbergia), sacaton (Sporobolus), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), Goodding's willow (Salix gooddingii), and velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina) (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 14-16). In riparian woodlands consisting of cottonwood and willow or gallery forests of broadleaf and deciduous species along larger rivers, the northern Mexican gartersnake may be observed in mixed grasses along the bank or in the shallows (Rossman et al. 1996, p. 176; Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 16). Within and adjacent to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico, it occurs in montane woodland, Chihuahuan desertscrub, mesquite-grassland, and Cordillera Volc[aacute]nica montane woodland (McCranie and Wilson 1987, pp. 14-17). [[Page 56230]] In small streamside riparian habitat, this snake is often associated with Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), sugar leaf maple (Acer grandidentatum), velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina), Arizona cypress (Cupressus arizonica), Arizona walnut (Juglans major), Arizona alder (Alnus oblongifolia), alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana), Rocky Mountain juniper (J. scopulorum), and a number of oak species (Quercus spp.) (McCranie and Wilson 1987, pp. 11-12; Cirett-Galan 1996, p. 156). Behavior, Prey Base, and Reproduction. The northern Mexican gartersnake is surface active at ambient temperatures ranging from 71 degrees Fahrenheit ([deg]F) to 91 [deg]F [22 degrees Celsius ([deg]C) to 33 [deg]C] and forages along the banks of waterbodies. The northern Mexican gartersnake is an active predator and is believed to heavily depend upon a native prey base (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 18, 20). Generally, its diet consists predominantly of amphibians and fishes, such as adult and larval native leopard frogs [e.g., lowland leopard frog (Rana yavapaiensis) and Chiricahua leopard frog (Rana chiricahuensis)], as well as juvenile and adult native fish species [e.g., Gila topminnow (Poeciliopsis occidentalis occidentalis), desert pupfish (Cyprinodon macularius), Gila chub (Gila intermedia), and roundtail chub (Gila robusta)] (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 18). Auxiliary prey items may also include young Woodhouse's toads (Bufo woodhousei), treefrogs (Family Hylidae), earthworms, deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus), lizards of the genera Aspidoscelis and Sceloporus, larval tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), and leeches (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 20; Holm and Lowe 1995, pp. 30-31; Degenhardt et al. 1996, p. 318; Rossman et al. 1996, p. 176; Manjarrez 1998). To a much lesser extent, this snake's diet may include nonnative species, including juvenile fish, larval and juvenile bullfrogs, and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) (Holycross et al. 2006, p. 23). Sexual maturity in northern Mexican gartersnakes occurs at 2 years of age in males and at 2 to 3 years of age in females (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 16-17). Northern Mexican gartersnakes are ovoviviparous (eggs develop and hatch within the oviduct of the female). Mating occurs in April and May in their northern distribution followed by the live birth of between 7 and 26 neonates (newly born individuals) (average is 13.6) in July and August (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 16). Approximately half of the sexually mature females within a population reproduce in any one season (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 17). Distribution Historical Distribution. The United States comprises the northern portion of the northern Mexican gartersnake's distribution. Within the United States, the northern Mexican gartersnake historically occurred predominantly in Arizona with a limited distribution in New Mexico that consisted of scattered locations throughout the Gila and San Francisco headwater drainages in western Hidalgo and Grant counties (Price 1980, p. 39; Fitzgerald 1986, Table 2; Degenhardt et al. 1996, p. 317; Holycross et al. 2006, pp. 1-2). Fitzgerald (1986, Table 2) provided museum records for the following historical localities for northern Mexican gartersnakes in New Mexico: (1) Mule Creek; (2) the Gila River, 5 miles (mi) ( 8 kilometers (km)) east of Virden; (3) Spring Canyon; (4) the West Fork Gila River at Cliff Dwellings National Monument; (5) the Tularosa River at its confluence with the San Francisco River; (6) the San Francisco River at Tub Spring Canyon; (7) Little Creek at Highway 15; (8) the Middle Box of Gila River at Ira Ridge; (9) Turkey Creek; (10) Negrito Creek; and (11) the Rio Mimbres. Within Arizona, the historical distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake ranged from 130 to 6,150 ft (40 to 1,875 m) in elevation and spread variably based on the relative permanency of water and the presence of suitable habitat. In Arizona, the northern Mexican gartersnake historically occurred within several perennial or intermittent drainages and disassociated wetlands that included: (1) The Gila River; (2) the Lower Colorado River from Davis Dam to the International Border; (3) the San Pedro River; (4) the Santa Cruz River downstream from the International Border; (5) the Santa Cruz River headwaters/San Rafael Valley and adjacent montane canyons; (6) the Salt River; (7) the Rio San Bernardino from International Border to headwaters at Astin Spring (San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge); (8) Agua Fria River; (9) the Verde River; (10) Tanque Verde Creek in Tucson; (11) Rillito Creek in Tucson; (12) Agua Caliente Spring in Tucson; (13) the downstream portion of the Black River from the Paddy Creek confluence; (14) the downstream portion of the White River from the confluence of the East and North forks; (15) Tonto Creek from the mouth of Houston Creek downstream to Roosevelt Lake; (16) Cienega Creek from the headwaters to the ``Narrows'' just downstream of Apache Canyon; (17) Pantano Wash (Cienega Creek) from Pantano downstream to Vail; (18) Potrero Canyon/Springs; (19) Audubon Research Ranch and vicinity near Elgin; (20) Upper Scotia Canyon in the Huachuca Mountains; (21) Arivaca Creek; (22) Arivaca Cienega; (23) Sonoita Creek; (24) Babocomari River; (25) Babocamari Cienega; (26) Barchas Ranch, Huachuca Mountain bajada; (27) Parker Canyon Lake and tributaries in the Canelo Hills; (28) Big Bonito Creek; (29) Lake O'Woods, Lakeside area; (30) Oak Creek from Midgley Bridge downstream to the confluence with the Verde River; and (31) Spring Creek above the confluence with Oak Creek (Woodin 1950, p. 40; Nickerson and Mays 1970, p. 503; Bradley 1986, p. 67; Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, Appendix I; 1995, p. 452; 1997, pp. 16-17; Holm and Lowe 1995, pp. 27-35; Sredl et al. 1995b, p. 2; 2000, p. 9; Rosen et al. 2001, Appendix I; Holycross et al. 2006, pp. 1-2, 15-51; Brennan and Holycross 2006, p. 123; Radke 2006; Rosen 2006; Holycross 2006). One record for the northern Mexican gartersnake exists for the State of Nevada, opposite Fort Mohave, in Clark County along the shore of the Colorado River (De Queiroz and Smith 1996, p. 155); however, any populations of northern Mexican gartersnakes that may have historically occurred in Nevada pertained directly to the Colorado River and are likely extirpated. Within Mexico, northern Mexican gartersnakes historically occurred within the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Mexican Plateau in the Mexican states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango, Coahila, Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Nayarit, Hidalgo, Jalisco, San Luis Potos[iacute], Aguascalientes, Tlaxacala, Puebla, M[eacute]xico, Veracruz, and Quer[eacute]taro, which comprises approximately 70 to 80 percent of its historical rangewide distribution (Conant 1963, p. 473; 1974, pp. 469- 470; Van Devender and Lowe 1977, p. 47; McCranie and Wilson 1987, p. 15; Rossman et al. 1996, p. 173; Lemos-Espinal et al. 2004, p. 83). Status in the United States. Holycross et al. (2006, p. 12) included the northern Mexican gartersnake as a target species at 33 sites surveyed within drainages along the Mogollon Rim. A total of 874 person-search hours and 63,495 trap-hours were devoted to that effort, which resulted in the capture of 23 snakes total in 3 (9 percent) of the sites visited. This equates to approximately 0.03 snakes observed per person-search hour and 0.0004 snakes captured per trap-hour over the entire effort. For comparison, a population of northern Mexican gartersnakes at Page Springs, Arizona, [[Page 56231]] that we consider stable yielded 0.22 snakes observed per person-search hour and 0.004 snakes captured per trap-hour (an order of magnitude higher) (Holycross et al. 2006, p. 23). Survey sites were selected based on the existence of historical records for the species or sites where the species may occur based on habitat suitability within the historical distribution of the species. Holycross et al. (2006, p. 12) calculated the capture rates for the northern Mexican gartersnake as 12,761 trap-hours per snake and 49 person-search hours per snake. Northern Mexican gartersnakes were found at 2 of 11 (18 percent) historical sites and 1 of 22 (4 percent) sites where the species was previously unrecorded (Holycross et al. 2006, p. 12). When compared with extensive survey data in Rosen and Schwalbe (1988, Appendix I), these data demonstrate dramatic declines in both capture rates and the total number of populations of the species in areas where multiple surveys have been completed over time. However, these data may be affected by differences in survey efforts and drought. In 2000, Rosen et al. (2001, Appendix I) resurveyed many sites in southeastern Arizona that were historically known to support northern Mexican gartersnake populations during the early to mid-1980s, and also provided additional survey data collected from 1993-2001. Rosen et al. (2001, pp. 21-22) reported their results in terms of increasing, stabilized, or decreasing populations of northern Mexican gartersnakes. Three sites (San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, Finley Tank at the Audubon Research Ranch near Elgin, and Scotia Canyon in the Huachuca Mountains) were intensively surveyed and yielded mixed results. The northern Mexican gartersnake population on the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge experienced ``major, demonstrable declines'' to near or at extirpation over the span of a decade. That population is now considered extirpated (Radke 2006). The status of the population at Finley Tank is uncertain. Scotia Canyon was the last area intensively resurveyed by Rosen et al. (2001, pp. 15-16). In comparing this information with survey data from Holm and Lowe (1995, pp. 27-35), northern Mexican gartersnake populations in this area suggest a possible decline from the early 1980s, as evidenced by low capture rates in 1993 and even lower capture rates in 2000. The remaining 13 sites in southeastern Arizona resurveyed by Rosen et al. (2001, pp. 21-22) also yielded mixed results. Population trend information is difficult to ascertain given the variability of survey sample design and effort used by Rosen et al. (2001). However, the survey results suggested population increases at one site (lower Cienega Creek), possible stability at two sites (lower San Rafael Valley, Arivaca), and negative trends at many other sites [Empire- Cienega Creek, Babocomari, Bog Hole, O'Donnell Creek, Turkey Creek (Canelo), Post Canyon, Lewis Springs (San Pedro River), San Pedro River near Highway 90, Barchas Ranch Pond (Huachuca Mountain bajada), Heron Spring, Sharp Spring, and Elgin-Sonoita windmill well site (San Rafael Valley)] (Rosen et al. 2001, pp. 21-22). While this survey effort could not confirm any specific extirpations of northern Mexican gartersnake populations on a local scale in southeastern Arizona, most sites yielded no snakes during resurvey (Rosen et al. 2001, Appendix I). Our analysis of the best available data on the status of the northern Mexican gartersnake distribution in the United States indicates that its distribution has been significantly reduced in the United States, and it is now considered extirpated from New Mexico (Nickerson and Mays 1970, p. 503; Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 25-26, Appendix I; Holm and Lowe 1995, pp. 27-35; Sredl et al. 1995b, pp. 2, 9-10; 2000, p. 9; Rosen et al. 2001, Appendix I; Painter 2005, 2006; Holycross et al. 2006, p. 66; Brennan and Holycross 2006, p. 123; Radke 2006; Rosen 2006; Holycross 2006). Fitzgerald (1986, pp. 9-10) visited 33 localities of potential habitat for northern Mexican gartersnakes in New Mexico in the Gila River drainage and was unable to confirm its existence at any of these sites. The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish State Herpetologist, Charles Painter, provided several causes that have synergistically contributed to the decline of northern Mexican gartersnakes in New Mexico, including bullfrog and nonnative fish introductions, modification and destruction of habitat, commercial exploitation, direct human-inflicted harm, and fragmentation of populations. The last known observation of the northern Mexican gartersnake in New Mexico occurred in 1994 on private land (Painter 2000, p. 36; Painter 2005). Our analysis of the best available information indicates that the northern Mexican gartersnake has likely been extirpated from a large portion of its historical distribution in the United States. We define a population as ``likely extirpated'' when there have been no northern Mexican gartersnakes reported for a decade or longer at a site within the historical distribution of the species, despite at least minimal survey efforts, and natural recovery at the site is not expected due to the presence of known threats. The perennial or intermittent stream reaches and disassociated wetlands where the northern Mexican gartersnake has likely been extirpated include: (1) The Gila River; (2) the Lower Colorado River from Davis Dam to the International Border; (3) the San Pedro River; (4) the Santa Cruz River downstream from the International Border at Nogales; (5) the Salt River; (6) the Rio San Bernardino from International Border to headwaters at Astin Spring (San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge); (7) the Agua Fria River; (8) the Verde River upstream of Clarkdale; (9) the Verde River from the confluence with Fossil Creek downstream to its confluence with the Salt River; (10) Tanque Verde Creek in Tucson; (11) Rillito Creek in Tucson; (12) Agua Caliente Spring in Tucson; (13) Potrero Canyon/Springs; (14) Babocamari Cienega; (15) Barchas Ranch, Huachuca Mountain bajada; (16) Parker Canyon Lake and tributaries in the Canelo Hills; and (17) Oak Creek at Midgley Bridge (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 25-26, Appendix I; 1997, pp. 16-17; Rosen et al. 2001, Appendix I; Brennan and Holycross 2006, p. 123; Holycross 2006; Holycross et al. 2006, pp. 15- 51, 66; Radke 2006; Rosen 2006). Information pertaining to the cause or causes of extirpation of these sites is summarized in Table 1 below. Conversely, our review of the best available information indicates the northern Mexican gartersnake is likely extant in a fraction of its historical range in Arizona. We define populations as ``likely extant'' when the species is expected to reliably occur in appropriate habitat as supported by recent museum records and/or recent (i.e., less than 10 years) reliable observations. The perennial or intermittent stream reaches and disassociated wetlands where we conclude northern Mexican gartersnakes remain extant include: (1) The Santa Cruz River/Lower San Rafael Valley (headwaters downstream to the International Border); (2) the Verde River from the confluence with Fossil Creek upstream to Clarkdale; (3) Oak Creek at Page Springs; (4) Tonto Creek from the mouth of Houston Creek downstream to Roosevelt Lake; (5) Cienega Creek from the headwaters downstream to the ``Narrows'' just downstream of Apache Canyon; (6) Pantano Wash (Cienega Creek) from Pantano downstream to Vail; (7) Upper Scotia Canyon in the Huachuca Mountains; and (8) the Audubon Research Ranch and vicinity near Elgin [[Page 56232]] (Rosen et al. 2001, Appendix I; Caldwell 2005; Brennan and Holycross 2006, p. 123; Holycross 2006; Holycross et al. 2006, pp. 15-51, 66; Rosen 2006). The current status of the northern Mexican gartersnake is unknown in several areas in Arizona where the species is known to have historically occurred. We base this determination on mostly historical museum records for locations where survey access is restricted, survey data are unavailable or insufficient, and/or current threats could preclude occupancy. The perennial or intermittent stream reaches and disassociated wetlands where the status of the northern Mexican gartersnake remains uncertain include: (1) The downstream portion of the Black River drainage from the Paddy Creek confluence; (2) the downstream portion of the White River drainage from the confluence of the East and North forks; (3) Big Bonito Creek; (4) Lake O'Woods near Lakeside; (5) Spring Creek above the confluence with Oak Creek; (6) Bog Hole Wildlife Area; (7) Upper 13 Tank, Patagonia Mountain bajada; (8) Babocamari River; and (9) Arivaca Cienega (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, Appendix I; Rosen et al. 2001, Appendix I; Brennan and Holycross 2006, p. 123; Holycross 2006; Holycross et al. 2006, pp. 15-51; Rosen 2006). In summary, after consultation with species' experts and land managers, and based upon our analysis of the best available scientific and commercial data, we conclude that the northern Mexican gartersnake has been extirpated from 85 to 90 percent of its historical distribution in the United States. Status in Mexico. Throughout this finding, and due to the significantly limited amount of available literature that addresses the status of and threats to extant populations of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico, we rely in part on (1) information that addresses the status of and threats to both riparian and aquatic biological communities within the historical distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico; and (2) information that addresses the status of and threats to native freshwater fish within the historical distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico, which we use as ecological surrogates due to their similar habitat requirements and their role as important prey species utilized by the northern Mexican gartersnake. Observations on the status of riparian and aquatic communities in Mexico are available but limited in comparison to our knowledge of these communities in the United States. The current distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico is also not well understood, although its status is believed to be in decline in many areas due to historical and continuing threats to its habitat and prey base, as discussed below. A large number of springs have dried up in several Mexican states within the distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake, namely, Chihuahua, Durango, Coahila, and San Luis Potos[iacute] (Contreras Balderas and Lozano 1994, p. 381). Contreras Balderas and Lozano (1994, p. 381) also stated that several streams and rivers throughout Mexico and within the distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake have dried up or become intermittent due to overuse of surface and groundwater supplies. We further acknowledge that northern Mexican gartersnakes were historically distributed in several regions within Mexico that have remained roadless and isolated and, according to the information we were able to obtain regarding the status of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico, few ecological investigations have occurred in these areas due to their remote nature and the logistical difficulties that face research in such areas. However, Mexican biologists Ramirez Bautista and Arizmendi (2004, p. 3) were able to provide general information on the principal threats to northern Mexican gartersnake habitat in Mexico which included the dessication of wetlands, improper livestock grazing, deforestation, wildfires, and urbanization. In addition, nonnative species, such as bullfrogs and sport and bait fish, have been introduced throughout Mexico and continue to disperse naturally, broadening their distributions (Conant 1974, pp. 487-489; Miller et al. 2005, pp. 60- 61). Given the lack of specific data on the status of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico, we cannot conclude with any degree of certainty its overall status in Mexico. Northern Mexican Gartersnake Distinct Population Segment In the petition to list the northern Mexican gartersnake, the petitioners specified several listing options for our consideration, including listing northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States as a DPS. Under the Act, we must consider for listing any species, subspecies, or DPSs of vertebrate species/subspecies, if information is sufficient to indicate that such action may be warranted. To implement the measures prescribed by the Act and its Congressional guidance, we developed a joint policy with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries entitled Policy Regarding the Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population (DPS Policy) to clarify our interpretation of the phrase ``distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife'' for the purposes of listing, delisting, and reclassifying species under the Act (61 FR 4721; February 7, 1996). Under our DPS policy, we consider three elements in a decision regarding the status of a possible DPS as endangered or threatened under the Act. The elements are: (1) The population segment's discreteness from the remainder of the taxon to which it belongs; (2) the population segment's significance to the taxon to which it belongs; and (3) the population segment's conservation status in relation to the Act's standards for listing (i.e., when treated as if it were a species, is the population segment endangered or threatened?). Our policy further recognizes it may be appropriate to assign different classifications (i.e., threatened or endangered) to different DPSs of the same vertebrate taxon (61 FR 4721; February 7, 1996). Discreteness The DPS policy's standard for discreteness requires an entity given DPS status under the Act to be adequately defined and described in some way that distinguishes it from other populations of the species. A population segment may be considered discrete if it satisfies either one of the following conditions: (1) Marked separation from other populations of the same taxon resulting from physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral factors, including genetic discontinuity; or (2) populations delimited by international boundaries within which differences in control of exploitation, management of habitat, conservation status, or regulatory mechanisms exist that are significant in light of 4(a)(1)(D) of the Act. Marked Separation from Other Populations of the Same Taxon as a Consequence of Physical, Physiological, Ecological or Behavioral Factors. We do not have any information to indicate that a marked separation exists between the United States and Mexico that would distinguish populations of northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States from those in Mexico. There is no information to indicate that a marked separation exists as a result of physical, physiological, ecological, or behavioral factors. There has been no genetic analysis completed for the northern Mexican gartersnake. Thus, we have no information to indicate that genetic differences exist. [[Page 56233]] Populations Delimited by International Boundaries Within Which Differences in Control of Exploitation, Management of Habitat, Conservation Status, or Regulatory Mechanisms Exist that are Significant. In terms of the conservation status of the northern Mexican gartersnake, despite the significantly limited amount of monitoring and/or survey data for the northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico, we believe there is a higher probability that the subspecies is fairing better overall in Mexico in terms of having more total populations, because a larger percentage of the overall range of the subspecies (approximately 70 to 80 percent of it historical distribution) occurs in Mexico. However, we have no information to indicate that the populations on either side of the United States- Mexico border have a more stable or better conservation status. We recognize that differences in management regulatory protection of northern Mexican gartersnake populations may exist between populations within Mexico and those within the United States. These differences primarily pertain to protections afforded to occupied habitat. In Mexico, any activity that intentionally destroys or adversely modifies occupied northern Mexican gartersnake habitat is prohibited [SEDESOL 2000 (LGVS) and 2001 (NOM-059-ECOL-2001)]. Neither the Arizona Game and Fish Department or the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish can offer protections to occupied habitat. Instead, these agencies regulate take in the form of lethal or live collection of individuals which is prohibited in both states. However, any conclusions that may be drawn with reference to differences in management across the United States-Mexico border are largely speculative due to the lack of information available as to the efficacy and protections of these regulations in practice. Because we determine in the following section that populations of the northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States are not significant to the subspecies as a whole, we need not address further the ``discreteness'' test of the DPS policy. For further information on regulatory considerations, please see our discussion under Factor D below. Significance Under our DPS policy, a population segment must be significant to the taxon to which it belongs. The evaluation of ``significance'' may address, but is not limited to, (1) evidence of the persistence of the discrete population segment in an ecological setting that is unique for the taxon; (2) evidence that loss of the population segment would result in a significant gap in the range of the taxon; (3) evidence that the population segment represents the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside its historic range; and (4) evidence that the discrete population segment differs markedly from other populations of the species in its genetic characteristics. Ecological Setting. Throughout its rangewide distribution, the northern Mexican gartersnake occurs at elevations from 130 to 8,497 ft (40 to 2,590 m) (Rossman et al. 1996, p. 172). The northern Mexican gartersnake is considered a riparian obligate (restricted to riparian areas when not engaged in dispersal behavior) and occurs chiefly in the following general habitat types in both the United States and Mexico: (1) Source--area wetlands [e.g., cienegas (mid-elevation wetlands with highly organic, reducing (basic, or alkaline) soils), stock tanks (small earthen impoundment), etc.]; (2) large river riparian woodlands and forests; and (3) streamside gallery forests (as defined by well- developed broadleaf deciduous riparian forests with limited, if any, herbaceous ground cover or dense grass) (Hendrickson and Minckley 1984, p. 131; Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 14-16; Arizona Game and Fish Department 2001). Based on this information, we determine that populations of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Arizona do not occupy an ecological setting differing enough from populations that occur in Mexico to be considered unique for the subspecies. Gap in the Range. The Service can determine that a gap in a taxon's range caused by the potential loss of a population would be significant based on any relevant considerations. One factor which may support such a determination is whether the loss of a geographic area amounts to a substantial reduction of a taxon's range and this reduction is biologically important. The United States comprised the most northern portion of the northern Mexican gartersnake's range and constituted approximately 20-30 percent of its rangewide historical distribution. Because we do not currently know exactly what the status of the northern Mexican gartersnake is in Mexico at this time, we are unable to ascertain what percentage of extant populations occur in the United States as compared to Mexico. However, this is not sufficient evidence to support a determination that loss of the northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States represents a substantial reduction in the subspecies' range based on the geographic area which would be lost. Furthermore, no area that is uniquely biologically significant to the northern Mexican gartersnake is located within the United States as compared to Mexico. Another factor relevant to determining whether a gap is significant is the biological significance of the number of total individuals of the taxon in the population that may be lost. Although we have no data on the absolute numbers of northern Mexican gartersnakes in the United States or Mexico, the best available science suggests that there are far more individuals in Mexico than in the United States, based on the more extensive range in Mexico and the current low density and number of extant populations in the United States. Therefore, we have no information to indicate that the loss of between 8 and 17 populations of northern Mexican gartersnakes known in the United States is biologically significant to the taxon as a whole. In conclusion, we have determined that the gap in the range of the northern gartersnake that would be caused by the loss of the United States population would not be significant because: (1) Loss of the United States population would not constitute a substantial and biologically important reduction of the range of the subspecies; (2) the loss of the individuals in the United States would not be biologically significant to the subspecies; and (3) we have not identified any other reason why loss of the United States population would result in a significant gap in the range of the subspecies. Marked Differences in Genetic Characteristics. Within the distribution of every species there exists a peripheral population, an isolate or subpopulation of a species at the edge of the taxon's range. Long-term geographic isolation and loss of gene flow between populations is the foundation of genetic changes in populations resulting from natural selection or change. Evidence of changes in these populations may include genetic, behavioral, and/or morphological differences from populations in the rest of the species' range. We have no information to indicate that genetic differences exist between populations of the northern Mexican gartersnake at the northern portion of its range in the United States from those in Mexico. Therefore, based on the genetic information currently available, the northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States should not be considered biologically or ecologically significant based simply on [[Page 56234]] genetic characteristics. Biological and ecological significance under the DPS policy is always considered in light of Congressional guidance (see Senate Report 151, 96th Congress, 1st Session) that the authority to list DPS's be used ``sparingly'' while encouraging the conservation of genetic diversity. Whether the Population Represents the Only Surviving Natural Occurrence of the Taxon. As part of a determination of significance, our DPS policy suggests that we consider whether there is evidence that the population represents the only surviving natural occurrence of a taxon that may be more abundant elsewhere as an introduced population outside its historic range. The northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States is not the only surviving natural occurrence of the subspecies. Consequently, this factor is not applicable to our determination regarding significance. Conclusion Following a review of the available information, we conclude that the northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States is not significant to the remainder of the subspecies. We made this determination based on the best available information, which does not demonstrate that (1) these populations persist in an ecological setting that is unique for the subspecies; (2) the loss of these populations would result in a significant gap in the range of the subspecies; and (3) these populations differ markedly from populations of northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico in their genetic characteristics, or in other considerations that might demonstrate significance. Further, available information does not demonstrate that the life history and behavioral characteristics of the northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States is unique to the subspecies. Therefore, on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information available, we find that proposing to list a DPS for the northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States is not warranted; these populations do not meet the definition of a distinct population segment. We are not addressing the third prong of the DPS policy (i.e. the population segment's conservation status in relation to the Act's standards for listing) since we find that the United States portion of the range of the northern Mexican gartersnake does not qualify as a listable entity pursuant to our DPS policy, as discussed above. Significant Portion of the Range In the petition to list the northern Mexican gartersnake, the petitioners also requested that we consider listing the species throughout its range based on its status in the United States. As required by the Act, we have considered in this finding whether the northern Mexican gartersnake is in danger of extinction ``in all or a significant portion of its range'' as defined in the terms ``threatened species'' and ``endangered species'' pursuant to section 3 of the Act. In order to determine if Arizona constitutes a significant portion of the range of the subspecies, we evaluate whether threats in this geographic area imperil the viability of the subspecies as a whole due to any biological importance of this portion of the subspecies range. Based upon the best scientific information available, we find that the extant populations in the United States are not considered a stronghold for the subspecies, they do not represent core or important breeding habitat, we are not aware of any unique genetic or behavioral characteristics, and we are not aware that threats in this portion of its range threaten the whole subspecies with extinction. Therefore, we determine that the extant populations of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Arizona do not constitute a significant portion of the range of the subspecies because there is no particular characteristic to any segment within this portion of its range that would render it biologically more significant to the taxon as a whole than other portions of its current range. We note that the court in Defenders of Wildlife v. Norton, 258 F.3d 1136 (9th Cir. 2001), appeared to suggest that a species could be in danger of extinction in a significant portion of its range if there is a ``major geographical area'' in which the species is no longer viable but once was. Although we do not necessarily agree with the court's suggestion, we have determined that the historical range of the subspecies within the United States does not constitute a ``major geographical area'' in this context. The portion of the northern Mexican gartersnake's historical range in United States (20 to 30 percent) constitutes a small percentage of the total range of the subspecies. The petitioners also requested that we consider listing the species throughout its range based on its rangewide status. Below we respond to the petitioners request through our analysis of the five listing factors for the United States and Mexico. Summary of Factors Affecting the Northern Mexican Gartersnake Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533), and implementing regulations at 50 CFR 424, set forth procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. Under section 4(a) of the Act, we may list a species on the basis of any of five factors, as follows: (A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. In making this finding, information regarding the status of, and threats to, the northern Mexican gartersnake in relation to the five factors provided in section 4(a)(1) of the Act is discussed below and summarized in Table 1 below.

In the discussions of Factors A through E below, we describe the known factors that have contributed to the current status of the northern Mexican gartersnake. The majority of this assessment is specific to those factors that have contributed to its status in the United States. The following discussion of these factors that pertain to the status and threats to the northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico are mainly regional, or statewide, in scope because in many cases we were unable to find specific information documenting that populations of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Mexico are directly affected by these threats. In some instances, we do include discussion on more refined geographic areas of Mexico when supported by the literature. However, many of the threats that affect the northern Mexican gartersnake in the United States are also present in Mexico. Thus, the relationship between the threats to the habitat and species in Mexico may be similar to what we have documented in the United States. A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range In the following discussion, we elaborate on the physical threats to northern Mexican gartersnake habitats (i.e., riparian and aquatic communities) that have occurred and continue to occur within the distribution of the species in the United States and Mexico. Various threats that have affected and continue to affect riparian and aquatic communities include dams, diversions, groundwater pumping, introduction of nonnative species (vertebrates, plants, and crayfish), woodcutting, mining, contaminants, urban and agricultural development, road construction, livestock grazing, wildfires, and undocumented immigration (Hendrickson and Minckley 1984, p. 161; Ohmart et al. 1988, p. 150; Bahre 1995, pp. 240-252; Medina 1990, p. 351; Sullivan and Richardson 1993, pp. 35-42; Fleischner 1994, pp. 630-631; Hadley and Sheridan 1995; Hale et al. 1995, pp. 138-140; DeBano and Neary 1996, pp. 73-75; Rinne and Neary 1996, p. 135; Stromberg et al. 1996, pp. 124-127; Girmendock and Young 1997, pp. 45-52; Rinne et al. 1998, pp. 7-11; Belsky et al. 1999, pp. 8-12; Esque and Schwalbe 2002, pp. 165, 190; Hancock 2002, p. 765; Voeltz 2002, pp. 87-88; Webb and Leake 2005, pp. 305-308; Holycross et al. 2006, pp. 52-61; McKinnon 2006a, 2006b, 2006c, 2006d, 2006e; Paradzick et al. 2006, pp. 88-93; Segee and Neeley 1996, Executive Summary, pp. 10-12, 21-23). These activities and their effects on the northern Mexican gartersnake are discussed in further detail below. It is important to recognize that in most areas where northern Mexican gartersnakes historically or currently occur, two or more threats may be acting synergistically in their influence on the suitability of those habitats or on the northern Mexican gartersnake itself. In our assessment of the status of these habitats, discussion of the role that nonnative species introductions have had on habitat suitability is critical. However, we provide that discussion under ``Factor C. Disease and Predation'' due to the intricate and complex relationship nonnative species have with respect to direct and indirect pressures applied to the northern [[Page 56237]] Mexican gartersnake and to its native prey base. Threats to Riparian and Aquatic Biological Communities in the United States. The modification and destruction of aquatic and riparian communities in the post-settlement arid southwestern United States is well documented and apparent in the field (Medina 1990, p. 351; Sullivan and Richardson 1993, pp. 35-42; Fleischner 1994, pp. 630-631; Stromberg et al. 1996, pp. 113, 123-128; Girmendock and Young 1997, pp. 45-52; Belsky et al. 1999, pp. 8-12; Webb and Leake 2005, pp. 305-310; Holycross et al. 2006, pp. 52-61). Several threats have been identified in the decline of many native riparian flora and fauna species through habitat modification and destruction as well as nonnative species introductions. Researchers agree that the period from 1850 to 1940 marked the greatest loss and degradation of riparian and aquatic communities in Arizona, which were caused by anthropogenic (human) land uses and the primary and secondary effects of those uses (Stromberg et al. 1996, p. 114; Webb and Leake 2005, pp. 305-310). Many of these land activities continue today and are discussed at length below. An estimated one-third of Arizona's pre-settlement wetlands have dried or have been rendered ecologically dysfunctional (Yuhas 1996). Modification and Loss of Cienegas in the United States. Cienegas are particularly important habitat for the northern Mexican gartersnake and are considered ideal for the species (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 14). Hendrickson and Minckley (1984, p. 131) defined cienegas as ``mid- elevation [3,281-6,562 ft (1,000-2000 m)] wetlands characterized by permanently saturated, highly organic, reducing soils.'' Many of these unique communities of the southwestern United States, and Arizona in particular, have been lost in the past century to streambed modification, improper livestock grazing, cultural impacts, stream flow stabilization by upstream dams, channelization, and stream flow reduction from groundwater pumping and diversions (Hendrickson and Minckley 1984, p. 161). Stromberg et al. (1996, p. 114) state that cienegas were formerly extensive along streams of the Southwest; however, most were destroyed during the late 1800s, when groundwater tables declined several meters and stream channels became incised along many southwestern streams, including the San Pedro River. Conservation of the remaining natural cienegas in Arizona will be contingent on their protection from severe flooding and from lowering of groundwater levels (Hendrickson and Minckley 1984, p. 169). Many sub-basins where cienegas have been severely modified or lost entirely overlap, wholly or partially, the historical distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake, including the San Simon, Sulphur Springs, San Pedro, and Santa Cruz valleys of southeastern and south- central Arizona. The San Simon Valley possessed several natural cienegas with luxuriant vegetation prior to 1885, and was used as a watering stop for pioneers, military, and surveying expeditions (Hendrickson and Minckley 1984, pp. 139-140). In the subsequent decades, the disappearance of grasses and commencement of severe erosion were the result of heavy grazing pressure by large herds of cattle as well as the effects from wagon trails that paralleled arroyos, occasionally crossed them, and often required stream bank modification (Hendrickson and Minckley 1984, p. 140). Today, only the artificially-maintained San Simon Cienega exists in this valley. Similar accounts of past conditions, adverse effects from historical anthropogenic activities, and subsequent reduction in the extent and quality of cienega habitats in the remaining valleys are also provided in Hendrickson and Minckley (1984, pp. 138-160). Urban and Rural Development in the United States. Development within and adjacent to riparian areas has proven to be a significant threat to riparian biological communities and their suitability for native species (Medina 1990, p. 351). Riparian communities are sensitive to even low levels (less than 10 percent) of urban development within a watershed (Wheeler et al. 2005, p. 142). Development along or within proximity to riparian zones can alter the nature of stream flow dramatically, changing once perennial streams into ephemeral streams, which has direct consequences on the riparian community (Medina 1990, pp. 358-359). Obvious examples of the influence of urbanization and development can be observed within the areas of greater Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, where impacts have modified riparian vegetation, structurally altered stream channels, facilitated nonnative species introductions, and dewatered large reaches of formerly perennial rivers where the northern Mexican gartersnake historically occurred (Santa Cruz, Gila, and Salt rivers, respectively). Urbanization and development of these areas, along with the introduction of nonnative species, are largely responsible for the extirpation of the northern Mexican gartersnake from these areas. Urbanization on smaller scales can also impact habitat suitability and the prey base for the northern Mexican gartersnake. Medina (1990, pp. 358-359) concluded that perennial streams had greater tree densities in all diameter size classes of Arizona alder and box elder (Acer negundo) as compared to ephemeral reaches where small diameter trees were absent. Small diameter trees assist the northern Mexican gartersnake by providing additional habitat complexity and cover needed to reduce predation risk and enhance the usefulness of areas for thermoregulation. Regional development and subsequent land use changes, spurred by increasing populations, along lower Tonto Creek and within the Verde Valley where northern Mexican gartersnakes are extant continue to threaten this snake's habitat and affect the habitat's suitability for the northern Mexican gartersnake and its prey species (Girmendock and Young 1997, pp. 45-52; Voeltz 2002, pp. 58-59, 69-71; Paradzick et al. 2006, pp. 89-90). Holycross et al. (2006, pp. 53, 56) recently documented adverse effects to northern Mexican gartersnake habitat in the vicinity of Rock Springs along the Agua Fria River and also throughout the Verde Valley along the Verde River. The effects of urban and rural development are expected to increase as populations increase. Consumer interest in second home and/or retirement real estate investments has increased significantly in recent times within the southwestern United States. Medina (1990, p. 351) points out that many real estate investors are looking for aesthetically scenic, mild climes to enjoy seasonally or year-round and hence choose to develop pre- or post-retirement properties that are within or adjacent to riparian areas due to their aesthetic appeal and available water. Arizona increased its population by 394 percent from 1960 to 2000, and is second only to Nevada as the fastest growing State in terms of human population (SSDAR 2000). Over the same time period, population growth rates in Arizona counties where the northern Mexican gartersnake historically occurred or may still be extant have varied by county but are no less remarkable: Maricopa (463 percent); Pima (318 percent); Santa Cruz (355 percent); Cochise (214 percent); Yavapai (579 percent); Gila (199 percent); Graham (238 percent); Apache (228 percent); Navajo (257 percent); Yuma (346 percent); LaPaz (142 percent); and Mohave (2004 percent) (SSDAR 2000). Population growth trends in Arizona, [[Page 56238]] and Maricopa County in particular, are expected to continue into the future. The Phoenix metropolitan area, founded in part due to its location at the junction of the Salt and Gila rivers, is a population center of 3.63 million people. The Phoenix metropolitan area is the sixth largest in the United States and resides in the fastest growing county in the United States since the 2000 census (Arizona Republic 2006). Development growth predictions have also been made for traditionally rural portions of Arizona. The populations of developing cities and towns of the Verde watershed are expected to more than double in the next 50 years, which may pose exceptional threats to riparian and aquatic communities of the Verde Valley where northern Mexican gartersnakes occur (Girmendock and Young 1993, p. 47; American Rivers 2006; Paradzick et al. 2006, p. 89). Communities in Yavapai and Gila counties such as the Prescott-Chino Valley, Strawberry, Pine, and Payson have all seen rapid population growth in recent years. For example, the population in the town of Chino Valley, at the headwaters of the Verde River, has grown by 22 percent between 2000 and 2004; Gila County, which includes reaches of the Salt, White, and Black rivers and Tonto Creek, grew by 20 percent between 2000 and 2003 (http://www.census.gov ). The upper San Pedro River is also the location of rapid population growth in the Sierra Vista-Huachuca City-Tombstone area (http://www.census.gov). All of these communities are near or within the vicinity of historical or extant northern Mexican gartersnake populations. Road Construction, Use, and Maintenance in the United States. Roads cover approximately one percent of the land area in the United States, but negatively affect 20 percent of the habitat and biota in the United States (Angermeier et al. 2004, p. 19). Roads pose unique threats to herpetofauna (reptiles and amphibians) and specifically to species like the northern Mexican gartersnake, its prey base, and the habitat where it occurs through: (1) Fragmentation, modification, and destruction of habitat; (2) an increase in genetic isolation; (3) alteration of movement patterns and behaviors; (4) facilitation of the spread of nonnative species via human vectors; (5) an increase in recreational access and the likelihood of subsequent, decentralized urbanization; (6) interference with and/or inhibition of reproduction; (7) contributions of pollutants to riparian and aquatic communities; and (8) population sinks through direct mortality (Rosen and Lowe 1994, pp. 146-148; Waters 1995, p. 42; Carr and Fahrig 2001, pp. 1074-1076; Hels and Buchwald 2001, p. 331; Smith and Dodd 2003, pp. 134-138; Angermeier et al. 2004, pp. 19-24; Shine et al. 2004, pp. 9, 17-19; Andrews and Gibbons 2005, pp. 777-781; Wheeler et al. 2005, pp. 145, 148-149; Roe et al. 2006, p. 161). Construction and maintenance of roads and highways near riparian areas can be a source of sediment and pollutants (Waters 1995, p. 42; Wheeler et al. 2005, pp. 145, 148-149). Sediment can adversely affect fish populations used as prey by the northern Mexican gartersnake by (1) interfering with respiration; (2) reducing the effectiveness of visually-based hunting behaviors; and (3) filling in interstitial spaces of the substrate which reduces reproduction and foraging success of fish interfering with respiration, and restricting reproduction and foraging of fish. Excessive sediment also fills in intermittent pools required for amphibian prey reproduction and foraging. Fine sediment pollution in streams impacted by highway construction without the use of sediment control structures was 5 to 12 times greater than control streams. Sediment can lead to several effects in resident fish species used by northern Mexican gartersnakes as prey species, which can ultimately cause the northern Mexican gartersnake's increased direct mortality, reduced reproductive success, lower overall abundance, lower species diversity, and reductions in food base as documented by Wheeler et al. (2005, p. 145). The underwater foraging ability of northern Mexican gartersnakes can also be directly compromised by excessive turbidity caused by sedimentation of water bodies. Metal contaminants, including iron, zinc, lead, cadmium, nickel, copper, and chromium, are bioaccumulative) and are associated with highway construction and use (Foreman and Alexander 1998, p. 220; Hopkins et al. 1999, p. 1260; Campbell et al. 2005, p. 241; Wheeler et al. 2005, pp. 146-149). A bioaccumulative substance increases in concentration in an organism or in the food chain over time. A mid- to higher order predator, such as a gartersnake, may therefore accumulate these types of contaminants over time in their fatty tissues and lead to adverse health affects. Several studies have addressed the effects of bioaccumulative substances on watersnakes. We find these studies relevant because watersnakes and gartersnakes have very similar life histories and prey bases and therefore, the effects from contamination of their habitat from bioaccumulative agents are expected to have similar effects. Campbell et al. (2005, pp. 241-243) found that metal concentrations accumulated in the northern watersnake (Nerodia sipedon) at levels six times that of their primary food item, the central stoneroller (fish) (Campostoma anomalum). Metals, in trace amounts, affect the structure and function of the liver and kidneys of vertebrates and may also act as neurotoxins, affecting nervous system function (Rainwater et al. 2005, p. 670). Metals may also be sequestered in the skin of reptiles, but this effect is tempered somewhat by ecdysis (the regular shedding or molting of the skin) (Burger 1999, p. 212). Hopkins et al. (1999, p. 1261) found that metals may even interfere with metabolic rates of banded watersnakes (Nerodia fasciata), altering the allocation of energy between maintenance and reproduction, reducing the efficiency of energy stores, and forcing individuals to forage more often, which increases activity costs (the energy expended in hunting which effects the net nutritional intake of an organism) and predation risk. Snakes of all species are particularly vulnerable to mortality when they attempt to cross roads. There are several reasons for this phenomenon. First, all snakes are thigmotherms (animals that derive heat from warm surfaces), which often compels them to slow down or even stop and rest on road surfaces that have been warmed by the sun as they attempt to cross (Rosen and Lowe 1994, p. 143). Additionally, many species of snakes are active when traffic densities are greatest, as is the case with gartersnakes, which are generally diurnal (active during daylight hours) (Rosen and Lowe 1994, p. 147). Van Devender and Lowe (1977, p. 47), however, observed several northern Mexican gartersnakes crossing the road at night after the commencement of the summer monsoon, which highlights the seasonal variability in surface activity of this snake, and many other species of reptiles. Perhaps the most common factor in road mortality of snakes is the propensity for drivers to intentionally run over snakes, which generally make easy targets because they usually cross roads at a perpendicular angle (Klauber 1956, p. 1026; Langley et al. 1989, p. 47; Shine et al. 2004, p. 11). This driving behavior is exacerbated by the general animosity that humans have toward snakes in general in modern-day society (Ernst and Zug 1996, p. 75; Green 1997 pp. 285-286). In fact, Langley et al. (1989, p. 47) conducted an experiment on the propensity for drivers to hit reptiles on the road using turtle and snake models and found that many [[Page 56239]] people have a greater desire to hit a snake on the road than any other animal; several drivers actually stopped and backed-over the snake mimic to ensure it was dead. Roe et al. (2006, p. 161) conclude that mortality rates due to roads are higher in vagile (mobile) species, such as gartersnakes (active hunters), than those of more sedentary species, such as the North American pit vipers in the genera Agkistrodon, Sistrurus, and Crotalus, which more commonly employ sit- and-wait foraging strategies. Roads that bisect wetland communities also act as mortality sinks in the dispersal or migratory movements of snakes (Roe et al. 2006, p. 161). The effect of road mortality of snakes becomes most significant in the case of small, highly fragmented populations where the chance removal of mature females from the population may appreciably degrade the viability of a population. Roads create easy access to areas previously infrequently visited or inaccessible to humans, increasing the frequency and significance of anthropogenic threats to riparian areas and fragmenting the landscape, which may genetically isolate herpetofaunal populations (Rosen and Lowe 1994, pp. 146-148; Andrews and Gibbons 2005, p. 772). While snakes of all species may suffer direct mortality from attempting to cross roads, Andrews and Gibbons (2005, pp. 777-779) found that many individuals of small, diurnal snake species avoid open areas (e.g., roads) instinctively in order to lower predation rates, which represents a different type of threat from roads. Shine et al. (2004, p. 9) found that the common gartersnake typically changed direction when encountering a road. These avoidance behaviors by individuals aversive to crossing roads affect movement patterns and may ultimately affect reproductive output within populations (Shine et al. 2004, pp. 9, 17-19). This avoidance behavior has been observed in the common gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis), a sister taxon to the Mexican gartersnake with similar life histories and behavior (Shine et al. 2004, p. 9). In our discussion and as evidenced by the literature we reviewed on the effect of roads on snake movements, we acknowledge the individuality of snakes in their behaviors towards road crossings in that roads may affect a snake's movement behavior by a variety of means and that generalizing these resultant behaviors does not adequately address this variability. In addition to altering the movement patterns of some snakes, roads can interfere with the male gartersnake's olfactory-driven ability to follow the pheromone trails left by receptive females (Shine et al. 2004, pp. 17-18). This effect to the male's ability to trail females may exacerbate the effects of low population density and fragmentation that affect several species of snakes, including the northern Mexican gartersnake. Furthermore, roads can facilitate an increase in the distance traveled by male snakes seeking receptive females, which increases exposure to predation and subsequently increases mortality rates (Shine et al. 2004, pp. 18-19). Although the northern Mexican gartersnake was not the subject of the 2004 Shine et al. study, similar responses can be expected in the northern Mexican gartersnake because its life history is similar to the, study's subject species (i.e., the common gartersnake). Roads tend to adversely affect aquatic breeding anuran (frog and/or toad) populations more so than other species due to their activity patterns, population structures, and preferred habitats (Hels and Buchwald 2001, p. 331). Carr and Fahrig (2001, pp. 1074-1076) found that populations of highly mobile anuran species such as leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were affected more significantly than more sedentary species and that population persistence can be at risk depending on traffic densities, which may adversely affect the prey base for northern Mexican gartersnakes because leopard frogs are a primary prey species. Recreation in the United States. As discussed above, population growth trends are expected to continue into the future. Expanding population growth leads to higher recreational use of riparian areas. Riparian areas located near urban areas are vulnerable to the effects of increased recreation with predictable changes in the type and intensity of land use following residential development. An example of such an area within the existing distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake is the Verde Valley. The reach of the Verde River that winds through the Verde Valley receives a high amount of recreational use from people living in central Arizona (Paradzick et al. 2006, pp. 107-108). Increased human use results in the trampling of near-shore vegetation, which reduces cover for gartersnakes, especially neonates. Increased human visitation of occupied habitat also increases the potential for human-gartersnake interactions, which frequently does not bode well for snakes, as it often leads to their capture, injury, or death of the snake due to the lay person's fear of snakes (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, p. 43; Ernst and Zug 1996, p. 75; Green 1997, pp. 285- 286; Nowak and Santana-Bendix 2002, p. 39). Groundwater Pumping, Surface Water Diversions, and Drought in the United States. Increased urbanization and population growth results in an increase in the demand for water and, therefore, water development projects. Collier et al. (1996, p. 16) mention that water development projects are one of two main causes of decline of native fish in the Salt and Gila rivers of Arizona. Municipal water use in central Arizona has increased by 39 percent in the last 8 years (American Rivers 2006). Water for development and urbanization is often supplied by groundwater pumping and surface water diversions from sources that include reservoirs and Central Arizona Project's allocations from the Colorado River. The hydrologic connection between groundwater and surface flow of intermittent and perennial streams is becoming better understood. Groundwater pumping creates a cone of depression within the affected aquifer that slowly radiates outward from the well site. When the cone of depression intersects the hyporheic zone of a stream (the active transition zone between two adjacent ecological communities under or beside a stream channel or floodplain between the surface water and groundwater that contributes water to the stream itself), the surface water flow may decrease, and the subsequent desiccation of riparian and wetland vegetative communities can follow. Continued groundwater pumping at such levels draws down the aquifer sufficiently to create a water-level gradient away from the stream and floodplain (Webb and Leake 2005, p. 309). Finally, complete disconnection of the aquifer and the stream results in strong negative effects to riparian vegetation (Webb and Leake 2005, p. 309). If complete disconnection occurs, the hyporheic zone could be adversely affected. The hyporheic zone can promote ``hot spots'' of productivity where groundwater upwelling occurs by producing nitrates that can enhance the growth of vegetation, but its significance is contingent upon its activity and extent of connection with the groundwater (Boulton et al. 1998, p. 67; Boulton and Hancock 2006, pp. 135, 138). Changes to the duration and timing of upwelling can potentially lead to localized extinctions in biota (Boulton and Hancock 2006, p. 139). To varying degrees, the effects of groundwater pumping on surface water flow and riparian communities have been observed in the Santa Cruz, San Pedro, and Verde rivers as a result of groundwater demands of Tucson, Sierra [[Page 56240]] Vista, and the rapidly growing Prescott Valley, respectively (Stromberg et al. 1996, pp. 113, 124-128; Rinne et al. 1998, p. 9; Voeltz 2002, pp. 45-47, 69-71). Along the upper San Pedro River, Stromberg et al. (1996, pp. 124-127) found that wetland herbaceous species (important as cover for northern Mexican gartersnakes) are the most sensitive to the effects of a declining groundwater level. Webb and Leake (2005, pp. 302, 318-320) described a correlative trend regarding vegetation along southwestern streams from historically being dominated by marshy grasslands (preferable to northern Mexican gartersnakes) to being currently dominated by woody species more tolerant of declining water tables due to their associated deeper rooting depths. The full effects of largescale groundwater pumping associated with the proposed Big Chino Water Ranch Project and its associated 30-mile (48 km), 36-in (91-cm) diameter pipeline have yet to be realized in the Verde River (McKinnon 2006c). This groundwater pumping and inter-basin transfer project is projected to deliver 2.8 billion gallons of groundwater annually from the Big Chino sub-basin aquifer to the rapidly growing area of Prescott Valley for municipal use (McKinnon 2006c). The Big Chino sub-basin provides 86 percent of the baseflow to the upper Verde River (American Rivers 2006; McKinnon 2006a). The potential for this project to obtain funding and approval for implementation has placed the Verde River on American River's ``Ten Most Endangered Rivers List (of 2006)'' (American Rivers 2006). This potential reduction or loss of baseflow in the Verde River could seasonally dry up large reaches and/or adversely affect the riparian community and the suitability of the habitat for extant populations of the northern Mexican gartersnake and its prey species in that area. Within the Verde River watershed, and particularly within the Verde Valley where the northern Mexican gartersnake remains extant, several other activities continue to threaten surface flows (Rinne et al. 1998, p. 9; Paradzick et al. 2006, pp. 104-110). The demands for surface water allocations from rapidly growing communities and agricultural and mining interests have altered flows or dewatered significant reaches during the spring and summer months in some of the Verde River's larger, formerly perennial tributaries such as Wet Beaver Creek, West Clear Creek, and the East Verde River, which may have supported the northern Mexican gartersnake (Girmendock and Young 1993, pp. 45-47; Sullivan and Richardson 1993, pp. 38-39; Paradzick et al. 2006, pp. 104-110). Groundwater pumping in Tonto Creek regularly eliminates surface flows during parts of the year (Abarca and Weedman 1993, p. 2). The upper Gila River is also threatened by diversions and water allocations. In New Mexico, a proposed water project that resulted from a landmark Gila River water settlement in 2004 allows New Mexico the right to withhold 4.5 billion gallons of surface water every year (McKinnon 2006d). If this proposed water diversion project is implemented, in dry years, currently perennial reaches of the upper Gila River will dry completely which removes all suitability of this habitat for the northern Mexican gartersnakes and a host of other riparian and aquatic species (McKinnon 2006d). Further evidence of the threat of groundwater depletion can be found in the management activities of the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR). ADWR manages water supplies in Arizona and has established five Active Management Areas (AMA) across the state (ADWR 2006). An AMA is established by ADWR when an area's water demand has exceeded the groundwater supply and an overdraft has occurred. Geographically, all five AMAs overlap the historical distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Arizona and provide further evidence of the role groundwater pumping has had and continues to have on historical and occupied northern Mexican gartersnake habitat. Such overdrafts are capable of adversely impacting surface water flow of streams that are hydrologically connected to the aquifer under stress and are often exacerbated by the ever-growing number of surface water diversions for various purposes. In order to accommodate the needs of rapidly growing rural and urban populations, surface water is commonly diverted to serve many industrial and municipal uses. These diversions have dewatered large reaches of once perennial or intermittent streams, adversely affecting northern Mexican gartersnake habitat throughout its range in Arizona and New Mexico. Many tributaries of the Verde River are permanently or seasonally dewatered by diversions for agriculture (Paradzick et al. 2006, pp. 104-110). The effects of the water withdrawals discussed above may be exacerbated by the current, long-term drought facing the arid southwestern United States. Philips and Thomas (2005) provided streamflow records that indicate that the drought Arizona experienced between 1999 and 2004 was the worst drought since the early 1940s and possibly earlier. Ongoing drought conditions have depleted recharge of aquifers and decreased baseflows in the region. While drought periods have been relatively numerous in the arid Southwest according to recorded history from the mid-1800s to the present, the effects of anthropogenic threats on riparian and aquatic communities have compromised the ability of these communities to function under the additional stress of prolonged drought conditions. Holycross et al. (2006, pp. 52-53) recently documented the effects of drought on northern Mexican gartersnake habitat in the vicinity of Arcosante along the Agua Fria River and at Big Bug Creek where the streams were completely dry and therefore unsuitable northern Mexican gartersnake habitats. Improper Livestock Grazing in the United States. Poorly managed livestock grazing has damaged approximately 80 percent of stream, cienega, and riparian ecosystems in the western United States (Kauffman and Krueger 1984, pp. 433-435; Weltz and Wood 1986, pp. 367-368; Waters 1995, pp. 22-24; Pearce et al. 1998, p. 307; Belsky et al. 1999, p. 1). Livestock grazing, as a resource use on public and private lands, has more than doubled quantitatively in 50 years; the number of cattle being grazed in the western United States increased from 25.5 million head in 1940, to 54.4 million head in 1990 (Belsky et al. 1999, p. 3). Effects of improper livestock management on riparian and aquatic communities have spanned from early settlement to modern day. Some historical accounts of riparian area conditions in Arizona elucidate early effects of poor livestock management. Cheney et al. (1990, pp. 5, 10) provide historical accounts of the early adverse effects of improper livestock management in the riparian zones and adjacent uplands of the Tonto National Forest and in south-central Arizona. These accounts describe the removal of riparian trees for preparation of livestock use and substantial changes to flow regimes accentuated by observed increases in runoff and erosion rates. Such accounts of riparian conditions within the historical distribution of the northern Mexican gartersnake in Arizona contribute to the understanding of when declines in abundance and distribution may have occurred and the causes for subsequent fragmentation of populations and widespread extirpations. In the recent past, riparian and aquatic communities have been negatively impacted by poor livestock management (e.g., overgrazing, uncontrolled access to riparian areas, [[Page 56241]] improper pasture rotation, no monitoring of use, etc.) within several watersheds that the northern Mexican gartersnake historically occupied, and in some cases, poor livestock management may constitute the greatest impact to riparian vegetation. The specific ways in which improper livestock grazing can adversely affect northern Mexican gartersnakes and contribute to their decline is discussed below. Watersheds where improper grazing has been documented as a contributing factor of northern Mexican gartersnake declines include the Verde, Salt, Agua Fria, San Pedro, Gila, and Santa Cruz (Hendrickson and Minckley 1984, pp. 140, 152, 160-162; Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 32- 33; Girmendock and Young 1997, p. 47; Voeltz 2002, pp. 45-81; Krueper et al. 2003, pp. 607, 613-614; Holycross et al. 2006, pp. 52-61; McKinnon 2006d, 2006e; Paradzick et al. 2006, pp. 90-92). Holycross et al. (2006, pp. 53-55, 58) recently documented adverse effects from improper livestock grazing on northern Mexican gartersnake habitat along the Agua Fria from EZ Ranch to Bloody Basin Road, along Dry Creek from Dugas Road to Little Ash Creek, along Little Ash Creek from Brown Spring to Dry Creek, along Sycamore Creek in the vicinity of its confluence with the Verde River, and on potential northern Mexican gartersnake habitat along Pinto Creek at the confluence with the West Fork of Pinto Creek. In southeastern Arizona, there have been observations of effects to the vegetative community suggesting that livestock grazing activities continue to adversely affect extant populations of northern Mexican gartersnakes by reducing or eliminating cover required by the northern Mexican gartersnake for thermoregulation, protection from predation, and foraging (Hale 2001, pp. 32-34, 50, 56). Poor livestock management causes a decline in diversity, abundance, and species composition of riparian herpetofauna communities from direct or indirect threats to the prey base, the habitat, or to the northern Mexican gartersnake itself from: (1) Declines in the structural richness of the vegetative community; (2) losses or reductions of the prey base; (3) increased aridity of habitat; (4) loss of thermal cover and protection from predators; and (5) a rise in water temperatures to levels lethal to larval stages of amphibian and fish development (Szaro et al. 1985, p. 362; Schulz and Leininger 1990, p. 295; Belsky et al. 1999, pp. 8-11). Improper livestock grazing may also lead to desertification (the process of becoming arid land or desert as a result of land mismanagement or climate change) due to a loss in soil fertility from erosion and gaseous emissions spurred by a reduction in vegetative ground cover (Schlesinger et al. 1990, p. 1043). Stock tanks may facilitate the spread of nonnative species when nonnative species of fish, amphibians, and crayfish are intentionally or unintentionally stocked by anglers and private landowners (Rosen et al. 2001, p. 24). Specific attributes of ecosystems, such as composition, function, and structure, have been documented as being altered by improper livestock management through a variety of means including: (1) Decreasing the density and biomass of individual species, reducing species richness, and changing biological community organization; (2) interfering with nutrient cycling and ecological succession; and (3) changing vegetation stratification, contributing to soil erosion, and decreasing availability of water to biotic communities (Fleischner 1994, p. 631). The management of stock tanks is an important consideration for northern Mexican gartersnakes. Stock tanks can be intermediary ``stepping stones'' in the dispersal of nonnative species from larger source populations to new areas (Rosen et al. 2001, p. 24). Additionally, dense bank and aquatic vegetation is an important habitat characteristic for the northern Mexican gartersnake that can be affected if the impoundment is poorly managed, which may lead to trampling or overgrazing of the bankside vegetation. Poor management may also favor nonnative predators of the northern Mexican gartersnake (Rosen and Schwalbe 1988, pp. 47, 32). Alternatively, well-managed stock tanks can provide habitat suitable for northern Mexican gartersnakes both structurally and in terms of prey base, especially when the tank remains devoid of nonnative species while supporting native prey species; provides adequate vegetation cover; and provides reliable water sources in periods of prolonged drought. Given these benefits of well-managed stock tanks, we believe well-managed stock tanks may be an important component to northern Mexican gartersnake conservation. A key to proper livestock management appears to be increasing the distribution of cattle across the entire grazing space. Fleischner (1994, p. 629) found that ``Because livestock congregate in ripari"
