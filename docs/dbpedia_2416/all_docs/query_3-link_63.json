        "text": "Is it me or do those suggested techniques seem like a bunch of garbage? Does PTC even use their own sofware? They propose some \"great\" ideas such as:\n\nSet the line display of all views to Wireframe. Regeneration time will be faster than if the view display is set to Hidden or No Hidden\n\n- That just plain seems idiotic. All it takes is forgetting to set the views back when saving, plotting or checking in.....\n\nErase views that are not being used when detailing the drawing\n\n- Why would they be there in the first place?\n\nMove completed views to separate sheets of the drawing. The views can be moved back to the original sheet prior to plotting\n\n- Ah more work...there is a reason we purchased a plotter to make C, D and E sized plots.\n\nUse File > Properties > Drawing Models > Add Model to add subassemblies to the drawing. Create views of the subassemblies instead of creating views of simplified representations of the master assembly.\n\n- Why did I bother tyring to save myself work and create a clean easy to use drawing in the first place? Simplified reps are great (especially in a Windchill enviroment where I don't what to check out 10 things to change one) And why would I detail a subassembly in an upper level assemby? That assembly should have it's own drawing. Nevermind the nightmare of trying to create a bill of materails from this.\n\nCreate separate drawings whenever possible, as this will prevent Pro/ENGINEER from retrieving unnecessary models into memory.\n\n- But you just recomended to me to use more sheets and add sub assemblies for differant views in an upper level assembly.....?\n\nUse Pro/BATCH so all plotting can be performed outside of Pro/ENGINEER\n\n- How screwed up is your software that you need a seperate program to do printing? If proBatch works so well why don't you build it into Proe and finally make a good drawing tool for your software.\n\nUse the Drawing Representation Tool to remove unnecessary views and to prevent Pro/ENGINEER from retrieving unnecessary models into session\n\n- Again why would I have views in my drawing that I did not want to use?\n\nMy recomendation (from a Wildfire perspective..we don't use Creo in our company...yet) is to use Z cliping, and when possible and to make sure that your views do not overlap. Also try turning off your drawing selection tool from\n\nRANT\n\nThis is the kind of crap that makes me so frustrated with PTC. They spend all of this time making a new GUI (Ribbons...why?) and they don't bother to fix the one thing I think has been broken with the sofware since I started using it in 2003....Their drawing tools are terrible. They should dedicate a new product release just to fixing that. It needs to be 10 times more user and admin friendly.\n\nNow this is just my opinion but they could learn a thing or two from AutoDesk when it comes to this. Now I am not saying that AutoCAD is perfect but when it comes to setting up standard drawing templates, printing standards and just gerneral printing they are light years ahead of PTC. I should not have to create complex mapkeys so users can print and create files to play with margins and colors/penmaps every time I move to a new version of your software or change a printer/plotter.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nIn Reply to Zachary Alexander:"
