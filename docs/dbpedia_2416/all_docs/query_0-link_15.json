We were treated to an incredible lightning storm during our stay, and watching the flashes over the foothills was spectacular. The kitchen is fully stocked, but bring essentials like salt, pepper, and extra trash bags. The fridge has ample space for a week\\'s groceries. There’s an ice maker in the freezer, but I’d suggest bringing extra ice as it takes time to fill. The dining area comfortably seats eight. The cabin is well-constructed and quiet, unlike those cardboard-cabins up in Gatlinburg. Thoughtful touches include basket swings, swing bed, a rustic tin ceiling, and an antique guest register. The beds are very comfortable, and even bathrobes are provided for added luxury. Nice washer and dryer that was very quiet for the benefit of the downstairs bedrooms. We enjoyed a cozy fire in the outdoor fireplace and while we didn’t use it, the gas grill looks brand new and high quality. The location is perfect, just minutes from Blue Ridge and other activities. Areas for Improvement: We spent about 30 minutes figuring out the ceiling fans and TV remotes, which were a bit confusing. A manual for operating these would be helpful. The gravel road leading to the cabin is rough in some areas, which might challenge smaller cars, especially with a low wheelbase, but it improves further up. My wife’s Mazda CXS-5 handled it but rattled the fillings in my teeth. LOL. Overall, the cabin is spacious, full of nice upgrades, and very clean. Highly recommended—we’ll definitely stay again. The Southern Comfort staff, Gracie and Holly, were very helpful and easy to communicate with.\n\n[name] => A Winford [response] => [review_date] => 2024-08-20 [source] => Website [sfrm] => [clean] => [rto] => [pc] => [loc] => [Name] => Lookout Lodge [page_slug] => Lookout_Lodge-400-15 [Photo] => https://img.trackhs.com/x1080/https://track-pm.s3.amazonaws.com/soco/image/6040effd-58bd-4f68-9612-bc6e63b3c656 [Thumb] => https://img.trackhs.com/x300/https://track-pm.s3.amazonaws.com/soco/image/6040effd-58bd-4f68-9612-bc6e63b3c656 ) [21] => stdClass Object ( [rating] => 5 [title] => Great Customer Service We Will Be Back Soon [review] =>\n\nWe enjoyed our stay at Reel Medicine.

We got in the blue ridge area around 7 and tried to follow the directions to the cabin but due to unmarked roads we wandered around for 2 hours . The one time I was able to get him on the phone, because of reception problems, he tried to direct us further, but then we lost all reception. We went to a motel and spent the night and spoke with him to see our options. He was very nice and even came to our motel and took us to another cabin not so secluded.
