        "text": "Caviar Conservative or Champagne Socialist? Politically, this week is incredibly significant for two countries I'm closely connected to. Rhetoric is everywhere and emotions are high. Pejorative terms, like those in this title, are frequently used as people meet at dinner tables, bars, and restaurants and political tension rises. This isn’t the place to air political views. Instead, it’s interesting to observe how we can jump to conclusions about others without genuinely trying to understand them. Past experiences, received wisdom, lack of time or motivation make it easy to quickly label people as hypocrites or 'one of them'. To explore this I’d like to use a personal example. I’m a consultant in the Life Sciences industry. I help companies develop sustainable profits by improving the ROI healthcare develops from their technologies. Upon reading that you might have an emotional reaction to the words \"Consultant\", \"Life Sciences\" and \"ROI\" all in the context of healthcare. You might even re-read it, thinking the method I use seems hypocritical or at odds. I often receive mild eye-rolling, dismissive comments, or ‘finger-wagging’ about what I do for a living. But I believe in my work, I enjoy it, and if you have 2 more minutes, I’ll explain why I do what I do. I believe Life Sciences and Healthcare are symbiotic. Their shared success depends on the shared value they create. Right now, the value equation might be imbalanced, but Life Sciences companies can and should do more to improve healthcare’s ROI by focusing on better patient experiences and outcomes. This benefits everyone. Patients, carers, health professionals, and company shareholders too. Why This Matters: - Healthcare systems are fiscally unsustainable. The health outcomes we enjoy today and future innovation will be unaffordable without significant reform. - The Life Sciences industry must adapt. If it is to continue playing a critical role in improving patient outcomes, it must respond to these changes. - Innovation can transform lives. New modalities like gene therapies can eliminate certain illnesses but come with high prices. The full value of these investments must be realised if they are adopted at scale by healthcare. - New working methods are showing impact. Older sales and marketing practices focused on demand generation are less effective. New initiatives that create shared value for Life Sciences companies and Healthcare are starting to scale. So at first, it might seem like I’m ‘just another consultant’ who looks at your watch and tells you the time, or that I’m either somehow a hardened capitalist or an unrealistic progressive because of the sectors I work in. But by focusing on these areas in the ways I do, I’m slowly but surely demonstrating how Life Sciences companies can help to create a more sustainable and effective healthcare system, to benefit everyone involved. Thanks for taking time to read and understand. Hopefully we can work together."
