        "text": "Thank you so much for your time! I know that you are a very busy person. Before we drive in, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you tell us a bit about your ‘backstory’ and how you got started?\n\nBit of my story, I come from the corporate world with over 25 years of experience. I worked in HR for global and multinational companies. I loved every minute of it. I was good at it, and I enjoyed it. I graduated from McMaster University, completed a post-grad in Human Resources, and received my CHRE (Certified Human Resources Executive) designation.\n\nOver the years, I began to recognize a lack of emotional intelligence, which is the key to personal and professional success. Emotional intelligence helps create a workplace environment where people feel comfortable communicating and confident in building solid relationships, improving productivity.\n\nAs the corporate world increasingly recognizes the value of qualities like creativity and empathy, we are moving beyond the old paradigm of profits over people. This new way of doing business is not only more sustainable but also more successful. Companies must recognize the importance of creating a supportive environment for their employees that encourages open communication and understanding. This shift in approach presents a unique opportunity to create a healthier, more productive work environment for all.\n\nMy focus is to help individuals and organizations learn how to empower their leaders to adapt to the ever-evolving workplace and to support organizations and leaders to transition to a purpose-driven culture, so businesses can unlock their hidden potential creating a culture of success. Companies can reach their goals and create a productive and enjoyable workplace when purpose, culture, and leadership are in harmony.\n\nFuture leaders must be able to motivate and inspire their teams while providing direction and guidance. They must create an environment where employees feel inspired and empowered. This leadership type comes from people authentically aligned with who they are, leading by example. Leadership is the gateway to success.\n\nIt has been said that our mistakes can be our greatest teachers. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?\n\nWell, very early in my career, I was in HR and setting up long service awards ceremony, and I did not double-check the spelling of the names. I was on stage and looked at the names and embarrassingly mispronounced the names in front of everyone. I couldn’t believe that I assumed that I would be able to say the names without issues. I mispronounced them multiple times while behind a podium on a speaker. People laughed because it was funny. However, it was not amusing, as I was mortified. However, it was a great lesson because I always double-check my work before presenting. I learned always prepare if you are going to be on the stage and you can’t wing it.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful for who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story?\n\nI had the pleasure of working with Jeremy Roncoroni, who was my General Manager when I worked in the hospitality industry. His kind, charismatic, firm, and strong leadership style left a lasting impression on me. He was an influential leader who led with both his mind and heart. I vividly recall a day when he called me into his office and said, “Kristina, it’s okay to fail. It won’t always be perfect, and that’s all right. What matters is what you learn from it.” Those words allowed me to take risks and be curious about my work. I excelled in my role and career because I was no longer afraid of failure. It was no longer a limiting factor, and I accomplished so much more as a result. I will always be grateful for his guidance and support.\n\nThroughout my life, I have learned a valuable lesson about the significance of leaders engaging in meaningful conversations with their teams. Such conversations can truly inspire individuals to reach new heights, making it essential for leaders to have them. Leaders can positively impact their organizations by sparking people and work cultures.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\n“A mistake is only repeated if a lesson is not learned.”\n\nAcknowledging that failure is an inevitable part of life is essential. Through these experiences, we develop valuable life and coping skills that help us face challenges in our personal and professional lives. Failing is crucial to growth, as it teaches us how to rise again. The key is to embrace failure as a chance to learn, recover quickly, and apply these lessons to future endeavors. Doing so enables us to avoid limiting our growth potential.\n\nCarol Dweck’s book, “Mindset”, highlights the significance of this concept. According to Dweck, having a growth mindset is crucial. With a fixed mindset, everything is centered around the outcome. Failure is seen as a waste of time and effort. In contrast, a growth mindset allows individuals to value their actions regardless of the outcome.\n\nWe must understand that making mistakes is acceptable if we learn from them. We should consistently strive to learn from our failures and use them as opportunities for personal and professional growth. The fear of making mistakes can be paralyzing, hindering our ability to take risks, innovate, and be creative. Fear can also derail projects and prevent individuals from making decisions and moving forward. We must face our fears head-on and not let them hold us back from our potential. If leaders within a company are fearful and resistant to change, it can negatively impact the entire organization.\n\nThinking back on your own career, what would you tell your younger self?\n\nDon’t let your ego run the show. You don’t need to prove to anyone that you deserve to be there. You are so much more when you align with your own personal power and do not look for validation from others.\n\nLeaders who prioritize their ego tend to prioritize their image over accomplishing tasks. Rather than focusing on doing good, they prioritize looking good, causing various issues such as a lack of progress and conflicts among team members. Additionally, ego-led leaders are often resistant, hindering growth and progress. Lastly, their desire for control and power can create a toxic environment that breeds fear and resentment among team members, which isn’t conducive to collaboration or creativity.\n\nSelf-awareness is crucial as it helps combat the ego-centric mindset. At times, individuals like myself may be unaware of their ego-driven actions. Knowing oneself can significantly transform the approach toward success. I have understood that an alternate path exists, where one is in harmony with their true self and no longer reliant on others to boost their ego.\n\nLet’s now move to the central part of our interview. What systems do you have to ensure your workplace is as inclusive as possible?\n\nCreate the space for people to thrive in!\n\nBeing a leader demands prioritizing the creation of an inclusive workplace. Fostering an environment that encourages vulnerability and openness is crucial to achieving this.\n\nVulnerability is the key to establishing inclusivity in the workplace. This mindset allows employees to feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions without fearing judgment or criticism. As a leader, you should motivate your team to be honest and transparent with each other. This creates a space where everyone feels welcomed and respected to share their thoughts and feelings.\n\nEmotions are also a fundamental aspect of the workplace. They can facilitate a sense of connection and understanding between colleagues. Encourage your team to be transparent about their emotions and create a safe space for them to express themselves.\n\nAs a leader, it is essential to set an example for your team by exhibiting the behavior you expect from them. Be receptive to feedback and constructive criticism and demonstrate to your team that their viewpoints are valuable. While creating an inclusive work environment is an ongoing effort, leaders can cultivate a sense of safety and respect among their team by encouraging vulnerability and emotional expression.\n\nBased on your experience and success, what are your top five tips for creating more inclusive workplaces? Please share a story or an example for each.\n\n1. Create a positive work culture:\n\nPositive work culture is one of the best ways to create a more inclusive workplace. This means promoting a positive and respectful environment where everyone feels valued and appreciated.\n\n2. Encourage leadership:\n\nEncouraging leadership at all levels is another key way to create a more inclusive workplace. This means creating opportunities for everyone to share their ideas and opinions and to have a voice in decision-making.\n\n3. Promote growth:\n\nPromoting growth and development opportunities for all employees is another key way to create a more inclusive workplace. This means providing opportunities for everyone to learn, grow, and reach their full potential.\n\n4. Respect differences:\n\nRespecting differences is another important way to create a more inclusive workplace. This means valuing and celebrating each person’s unique perspectives and experiences to the workplace.\n\n5. Communicate openly:\n\nCommunicating openly and honestly is another key way to create a more inclusive workplace. This means creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable communicating their thoughts and feelings and where there is open and honest dialogue.\n\nI can share a personal experience that illustrates these points. At one of our work locations, we underwent a major transformation. Since we were closing the site, we informed the employees about it nine months before the merge. This gave them sufficient time to prepare for the upcoming change.\n\nA significant change was made in the organization’s approach, which was traditionally risk-averse. We pitched the idea to the leadership team and educated them on the risks of the alternative. A group of change ambassadors was created, consisting of individuals from different levels of positions. We held change meetings where we worked together as a team to address issues related to the change. Each member was given a change lead jacket for easy identification on the floor. People approached these leads with questions, and the change ambassadors brought them to our meetings, where we collectively developed answers.\n\nIn the workplace, it is crucial to be attuned to the overall atmosphere and mood, whether positive or negative, to encourage the team to continue pushing for progress. This method aligns with our strategy of fostering communication from the bottom up and utilizing influential individuals on the front lines. We discovered that everyone desires to be a part of the transformation and have a good experience. Therefore, it is vital to involve them in the process.\n\nTo achieve openness, we had to leave our positions at the door and engage in dialogue to create solutions. Additionally, being a part of this team required having a positive attitude toward change. Though this process may have been unfamiliar to some, it ultimately led to the development of future leaders who felt empowered, included, and a sense of belonging. This type of collaborative teamwork should be embraced in the future.\n\nInitially, some of the senior leaders were uncertain about the process. Nevertheless, it ultimately proved to be successful. They had reservations regarding the approach, but I recommended that we adopt a new outlook emphasizing inclusivity. With this level of bravery, we accomplished remarkable outcomes. We were able to migrate buildings with 90% engagement ratings from buildings with elevated engagement levels.\n\nCan you share 3 or 4 of the most common mistakes you have seen businesses make while trying to become more inclusive? What should one keep in mind to avoid that?\n\nInclusion is a crucial part of any successful business, but it can be challenging to get it right. Here are three of the most common mistakes companies make when trying to become more inclusive and what to keep in mind to avoid them:\n\n1. Not Listening to Diverse Voices: Ensuring all voices are heard and respected in the workplace is essential. You’ll likely miss valuable insights if you’re not actively seeking diverse perspectives.\n\n2. Not Taking Action: More is needed to discuss inclusion. You must take concrete steps to ensure everyone feels welcome and respected in the workplace.\n\n3. Not Being Transparent: Transparency is critical regarding inclusion. Ensure that everyone knows your policies and how they are being implemented.\n\nInclusion is an essential part of any successful business, but it can be challenging to get it right. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can ensure that your workplace is a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.\n\nHow do you measure the effectiveness of your DEI efforts?\n\nIt would be helpful to gather information about the demographics of new hires and all employees and the demographic diversity across different levels of the organization. Additionally, it’s essential to review language usage to avoid problematic phrases that could be offensive to certain groups based on gender, age, or other factors. Encouraging participation in DEI training and programming can also promote a more inclusive workplace. Finally, ensuring pay equity is crucial to creating a fair and just work environment.\n\nAre there other organizations you admire for their approach to DEI? Can you please explain why?\n\nI don’t think one organization that stands out does this well to date. I believe this is a journey, and it is in the process of being built.\n\nWhat do you do to address Proximity Bias? How do you ensure remote workers are treated the same as onsite workers and have equal access to opportunities?\n\nProximity bias is a widespread issue in the workplace. It often results in individuals exhibiting preferential treatment towards those who are physically closer or have a closer relationship. Unfortunately, remote workers can suffer from this bias, receiving less favorable treatment than their on-site counterparts, which makes it difficult for them to access the same opportunities.\n\nEstablishing opportunities for social interaction is crucial for remote employees to feel connected to the work culture. Regular video calls or chat rooms can facilitate engagement among employees. Encouraging participation in company-wide events like webinars or online training courses can also be helpful. Keeping communication lines open is key to allowing remote employees to ask questions and provide feedback easily.\n\nTo effectively tackle this problem, there are several measures you can take. Firstly, guarantee that your hiring process is equitable and unbiased by considering candidates from different backgrounds, locations, and objectively evaluating their qualifications. Secondly, recognize and combat any biases you may have. Lastly, promote diversity and inclusivity in the workplace, as a diverse team is more likely to be aware of proximity bias. By taking these steps, you can ensure that all employees are treated impartially and have equal access to opportunities.\n\nWe are very blessed to have some of the biggest names in Business, VC funding, Sports, and Entertainment read this column. Is there a person in the world whom you would love to have a private lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this.\n\nI have a strong desire to meet Brene Brown. Her published works, public speeches, and interviews explore the importance of vulnerability and its ability to increase our emotional intelligence and enrich our lives. Brene Brown highlights the benefits of cultivating courage and self-compassion, which in turn can improve our leadership qualities.\n\nIn a society where expressing emotions is sometimes discouraged, it takes immense courage to dismantle these barriers and create new opportunities. By continuing this essential dialogue, we are paving the way for significant advancements that will have a positive and lasting impact.\n\nHow can our readers further follow your work?\n\nHolle Consulting.com\n\nKristinaholle.com\n\nWebsite: https://kristinaholle.com/\n\nInstagram: Kristinamhollereal\n\nFacebook: Kristinaholle"
