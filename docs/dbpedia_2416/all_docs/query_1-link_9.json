Bridgnell from G Department.\n\nAs a test technician with the Self Defense Systems Division, Alex has provided outstanding support to the forward-deployed ships and worked countless hours to ensure systems are ready and Sailors are confident in performing their duties on the close-in weapons systems. Alex supported USS Ronald Reagan when the ship experienced a major system casualty that downed two major components. He had to assist in locating and shipping the parts to reach an OCONUS destination due to limited available repair parts, size of the part and part classification level. Bridgnell’s passion, dedication, ability to step out of his technical role, and manage the logistics have been instrumental to the project’s success.\n\nHis role as the Close-In Weapons System subject matter expert for two forward-deployed Naval Forces-Japan AEGIS Destroyers was critical in the successful execution of the program during the Combat Systems Assessment Team execution. Bridgnell’s excellence in delivering quality service and collaboration exemplifies the core values of both G4 and the command.\n\nNSWC IHD — a field activity of the Naval Sea Systems Command and part of the Navy’s Science and Engineering Establishment — is the leader in ordnance, energetics, and EOD solutions. The Division focuses on energetics research, development, testing, evaluation, in-service support, manufacturing and disposal; and provides warfighters solutions to detect, locate, access, identify, render safe, recover, exploit and dispose of explosive ordnance threats."
