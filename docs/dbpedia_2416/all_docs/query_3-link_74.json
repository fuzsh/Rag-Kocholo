Ruan cleverly utilized the theme of drunkenness as a veil to express his criticisms of oppressive rulers, thus avoiding persecution. This composition consists of seven distinct parts, each with its own evocative title: “Wine Makes Worries Vanish,” “Dancing in Intoxication Like an Immortal,” “Singing Grandly, Startling the Universe,” and “Lost in the Bliss of Inebriation.”.\n\nYizhuo Dong, Yinhan Jiang, Muzhi Ma, Jason Rasheed Orr, Edward Zixiao Tang, Yiwei Wang, Grace Xu\n\n2.

It depicts Lady Yu, the Royal Concubine’s sorrow. It goes like this: In moonlight, I could not bear to look back towards my homeland rid of my name. Jade steps and carved railings may still as ever be there, Though changed are the faces fair. O how great, how grave, I ask, can my woe and sorrow be? Just like the River’s swelling spring-tide waters rolling east to the sea.\n\nYing Chou, Kruthica R Dama, Nicole Yayin Guan, Angela Hao, Ryan Jung Lee, Jane Juan Liu,\n\nSondia Tran-Ngoc Luong, Corwin Phung, Steven Wong Schlosberg, Julia Luyi Wang, Katherine Wang\n\nb.
