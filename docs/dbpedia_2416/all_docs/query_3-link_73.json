        "text": "Scott M Foley\n\nWomen's Basketball 1/1/2020 2:11:00 PM\n\nSun Belt Plays Opens at Home Against Little Rock and Arkansas State\n\nSAN MARCOS, Texas – Texas State (7-4) opens its seventh season of Sun Belt Conference play this weekend at home as it hosts Little Rock and Arkansas State for a pair of games. The Trojans serve as the league lidlifter at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 2. The Red Wolves and Bobcats will battle at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 4. Brant Freeman and Suzanne Fox will have the call on ESPN+ and Clint Shields has the radio play-by-play call on 89.9 KTSW and txstatebobcats.com for both games.\n\n#BobcatBits\n\nTXST has never lost a Sun Belt Conference opener and is 6-0 since joining the league in 2013-14. This is the first year the Bobcats have opened conference play at home since 2016-17 when it downed Coastal Carolina, 83-62.\n\nThe Bobcats are a perfect 6-0 inside Strahan Arena this year and finished non-conference play undefeated at home for the first time since 2015-16. TXST is averaging 67.3 points per game at home, 5.1 points better than its overall season average. The Bobcats closed out the decade at home with a win over Alcorn State and went 89-57 in San Marcos from 2010-19.\n\nHead coach Zenarae Antoine is in her ninth season and has amassed 132 wins. She is the fourth head coach in program history to reach the benchmark and is six wins from tying Linda Sharp (1989-97) for third-most victories in school history.\n\nThe Bobcats average 20.6 turnovers forced per game which is 36th in the NCAA and ranks second in the Sun Belt. Texas State has excelled in winning the turnover battle this year and lead the Sun Belt with a +4.73 turnover margin.\n\nIn its last game against Alcorn State, Texas State grabbed 53 rebounds, its most in the last nine seasons.\n\nTexas State is 6-0 this year when limiting its opposition to 60 or fewer points. Texas State held four non-conference opponents under 50 points for the first time since it held five under the mark in 2006-07.\n\nThe Bobcats recently wrapped up non-conference play this year and finished the last five seasons with a 20-5 mark at home against non-league foes.\n\nTaylor Enjoying Hot Sophomore Start\n\nSophomore guard Kennedy Taylor's 4.9 assists per game and 54 total assists lead the Sun Belt Conference. She ranks 48th nationally in the statistic and tied her season-high with eight dimes against Alcorn State. The point guard also ranks third in the conference with a 1.50 assist turnover ratio.\n\nTaylor has scored in double figures in five of the last six games and is second on the team averaging 10.2 points per game. She posted a career-best 22 points in the Dec. 4 overtime win over I-35 Rival UTSA.\n\nTaylor flirted with a double-double in her last contest against Alcorn State and dropped 16 points, tied her season-high with eight assists and collected a career-best six rebounds. The point guard also set a career-high by draining seven free throws.\n\nThe Dallas, Texas native has been one of the most durable players in the Sun Belt this year and is fourth among conference leaders in minutes played per game (33.5).\n\nHolle Twins Lead the Bobcats in Senior Seasons\n\nTwin sister senior guards Brooke and Bailey Holley both place in the top four in SBC steal totals. Brooke is second in steals per game (2.5) and total steals (27) while Bailey is tied for fourth in steals per game (2.1) and tied for third in total steals (23). Brooke has registered a steal in every game this year and has notched two five steal contests against UTSA and Morgan State.\n\nSenior guard Brooke Holle is attempting to become the 19th player in Texas State women's basketball history to accumulate 1,000 career points. Holle has scored 815 points during her four seasons for the Maroon and Gold and has netted 300-plus points in each of the last two complete seasons.\n\nShe has made 111-of-349 (31.8 percent) of her three-point attempts during her career and needs just six triples to crack the top-10 list for career made three-pointers at Texas State. Toshua Leavitt (2015-19) is the Sun Belt Conference and Texas State career leader with 363 triples.\n\nBrooke is the team's active career leader in points (815), rebounds (453), assists (144) and steals (119) She leads the team in rebounding this year (6.1 rpg) and is third in scoring (9.8 ppg).\n\nOver her last six games Holle has gone 21-for-26 at the free throw stripe.\n\nBrooke Holle garnered Sun Belt Player of the Week honors for the first time in her career (Dec. 16).\n\nBailey Holle has excelled in her sixth-player role this year and is averaging 25 minutes per game off the bench. She dropped a season-high 11 points on the road at Morgan State while tying a career-high with three triples.\n\nBailey completed her undergraduate degree in business administration at the conclusion of the fall semester. She was unable to attend the ceremony due to the Bobcats road game at Dartmouth on Dec. 15 but will receive her diploma in the spring. The Austin, Texas native will wear a Sun Belt Graduate patch on her jersey the remainder of the season and begin postgraduate work to pursue a master's in business administration in the fall semester.\n\nBobcat Player Notes\n\nJunior guard Avionne Alexander set a career-high with seven assists at Morgan State.

She posted a career-best 14 rebounds in the last game against Alcorn State.\n\nScouting Little Rock\n\nThe Trojans are the two-time defending Sun Belt Conference Tournament champions and were picked to win the league in the preseason coaches' poll but have opened the year 2-9 against a very challenging slate. Little Rock has played the 21st toughest schedule in the nation and lost its last two contests against nationally ranked foes in #20 Arkansas (86-53) and #15 Mississippi State (89-50).\n\nBoth wins this season came at home against I-40 Showdown rival Central Arkansas (63-48) and Tulsa (63-51).\n\nReigning Sun Belt Conference Tournament MVP, senior guard Kyra Collier, leads the club and ranks second in the Sun Belt in scoring (15.9 ppg) while playing a conference-best 38.4 minutes per game.\n\nLittle Rock is 12th in the Sun Belt in scoring (52.0 ppg) and have been held at 40 or fewer points three times.\n\nRedshirt sophomore forward Krystan Vornes leads the team in rebounding (6.1 rpg).\n\nJoe Foley is the Dean of Sun Belt Conference head coaches and is currently in his 17th season guiding the program.
