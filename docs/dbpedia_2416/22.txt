History[]

Adolf Hitler at the suggestion of the Head of Luftwaffe Hermann GÃ¶ring secretly offered to Franco air support and his army. The main objective was to test the German Air Force in a conventional war

This support consisted of both logistic support, troop transport, groceries, etc.. as in actions in support of attack by fighter planes and bombers (like the famous bombardment in Guernica), tanks and artillery.

The German intervention in Spanish Civil War improved the quality of their war equipment and repair the defects of its air force, preparing the world for the onslaught that Hitler planned.

On November 11, 1936 the first 697 men arrived at the Legion Condor Seville. Adolf Hitler supplied the Spanish Nationalists with men and weapons, but this was a new and special group: the head of German intelligence, Wilhelm Canaris, Had agreed with General Franco that the quota would be mostly air. Present in almost all fronts, the dreaded Legion Condor came to meet 5000 airmen, hundreds of soldiers, units of tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and motorized infantry elite.

In April 1937, air strikes were multiplying ever more deadly and the Legion had already experienced in Oviedo the Carpet Bombing method. After his mission, in May 1939, days after (June 6) the Condor Legion was honored at Berlin: 15.000 German soldiers marched from Spain to great acclaim. Months later, WWII broke out, and the men were specially prepared for her.
