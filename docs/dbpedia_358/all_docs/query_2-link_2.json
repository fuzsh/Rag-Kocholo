        "text": "Jake Dean is a trial lawyer focused on commercial, real estate, and employment matters. Clients turn to Jake for assistance with high-stakes disputes in venues across the country. He has been recognized by Best Lawyers: Ones to Watch in real estate litigation for the last three years.\n\nIn his national real estate litigation practice, Jake represents landlords, tenants, owners, and contractors. These real estate matters range from routine lease issues to complex, multiparty disputes involving guarantor liability, lender exposure, construction, and veil-piercing questions. Recently, Jake successfully represented several commercial tenants in nationwide litigation portfolios to strategically exit certain leases and recover unpaid tenant improvement allowances comprising tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIn his employment litigation practice, Jake represents employers facing traditional employment claims. These range from employment discrimination, retaliation, and whistleblower claims to sophisticated trade secret misappropriation and noncompete issues. Jake recently obtained two complete defense victories at arbitration on behalf of The Boeing Company and a large mortgage company.\n\nPrior to law school, Jake played football for UCLA. He was a starter for two years and was named to the Pac-10 All-Bowl Team in 2009/2010 by ESPN.\n\n*Admitted only in California.\n\n*Pending approval of application for admission to Washington, D.C.
