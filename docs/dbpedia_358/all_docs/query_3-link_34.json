        "text": "Andy Drug-Raped Danni and Mel? (2005)\n\nOne of Hollyoaks’ most controversial stories to date saw Andy Holt drug and then rape Danni Carbone and Mel Burton. Much of the storyline aired in several late night specials airing throughout the later half of 2005 and early 2006, allowing Hollyoaks to show the reality of the situation as realistically as possible.\n\nAndy Holt arrived in Hollyoaks as a new student in the summer of 2005. Although he appeared easy going and friendly at first, his dark side soon emerged when he spiked Danni Carbone’s drink with GHB and then raped her. The following morning, Danni could remember nothing and Andy convinced her that she had consented to sex. Over the course of the next few months, Andy raped several other women (who were not characters in the show) and eventually confessed all to his friend, Sam Owen. Andy convinced Sam that the rapes were just a bit of harmless fun and even persuaded him to get involved…\n\nAndy’s next targets were the twins, Mel and Sophie Burton. Whilst on a night out at the SU Bar, Andy spiked Mel and Sophie’s drinks and after the drugs had taken effect, offered himself and Sam to walk them home. Once back at the flat, Andy took Mel to her bedroom to rape her and ordered Sam to rape Sophie. Ultimately, Sam could not go through with it and left, but he lied to Andy, saying he had raped her.\n\nThe following morning, Sophie awoke and almost instantly realised that something was wrong. When she went to check on Mel, she was shocked to discover blood on her bed and her sister passed out. Once Mel had woken up, the two girls pieced together what had happened and Sophie insisted that they went to the police straight away.\n\nAt the police station, the twins were questioned and examined. When the results came back, they revealed that only Mel had injuries that were consistant with rape and this lead to confusion between them and both girls questioned why only Mel had been raped. When the twins discovered that Danni had also been raped by Andy, they teamed up in a bid to bring him to justice.\n\nMeanwhile, Andy was furious when he found out that Sam had not raped Sophie and took him to a quarry, followed by Danni’s boyfriend, Russ Owen, who had just found out about the rape. A fight broke out and Andy ended up going over the edge. He was presumed dead.\n\nAndy managed to escape from his watery grave and returned to Hollyoaks several months later. In a bid to get revenge on Sam and Russ, he kidnapped their younger sister, Nicole and took her to an abandoned warehouse in Southport. Andy then lured Sam and Russ to the warehouse and attacked them with a metal pole, before revealing Sam’s role in the rapes.\n\nAs Andy attempted to rape Nicole, he was interrupted by Mel, who had spotted Andy whilst on a trip to a funfair with her boyfriend, OB. Mel confronted Andy about what he’d done to her but he managed to escape. As Andy attempted to flee, he ran into a dark room but all of a sudden, stopped running. Mel turned on the lights, and it was shown that Andy had run into a large pole, impaling himself. Andy died a gruesome death as Mel watched on mouthing “you bastard” to him."
