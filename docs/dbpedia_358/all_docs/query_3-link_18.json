        "text": "You have emotional problems and a below-average IQ. I'm prescribing Hollyoaks.\n\nâ€”Frankie Boyle, \"Bad Things to hear at the Psychiatrist's\", Mock the Week\n\nHollyoaks is a British soap that began in 1995, centered on the residents of Hollyoaks, a fictional area in Chester. The show is primarily aimed at young people, the cast being on average teenaged to mid-20s.\n\nHollyoaks has always been something of a joke among critics and viewers; it was mocked for the practice of casting attractive yet unconvincing actors, as well as some of its more outlandish storylines, or feeble dialogue. However, recently[when?] Hollyoaks has shown a notable rise in quality, producing several satisfying story arcs and interesting characters. It has even garnered critical attention in papers such as The Guardian, and at several award shows, and was praised for its portrayal of the gay relationship between John Paul and Craig.\n\nIt's also notable for having the greatest dissonance between the happiness of the theme song and the utter misery that ensues after it finishes.\n\nMany viewers love Hollyoaks not despite its faults, but because of them. See So Bad It's Good.\n\nAnother amusing thing is that Channel 4 goes down the \"if you've been affected by the issues in the program call our hot-line\" route. Given the plots of the series manning that hot-line must be the easiest job in the world. After all how many teenage-schoolgirls-being-blackmailed-by-their-birth-mother-into-stealing-their-own-baby-that-is-being-passed-off-as-your-sister's-child-over-the-fact-that-you-shot-the-baby's-father,-also-your-sister's-husband-at-their-wedding are there out there just waiting to phone in.\n\nTropes used in Hollyoaks include:\n\nAesop Amnesia: So, so, so many times.\n\nMercedes treated her husband like scum and repeatedly cheated on him, only to reconcile briefly before he performs a Heroic Sacrifice to save her from an explosion. She is genuinely distraught over his senseless death, but fast-forward a month later, she is now doing the vertical tango with both a father and son, has gotten engaged again... and doesn't seem to remember he even existed.\n\nAffably Evil: Despite killing his wife and three young women, and tying to kill two more young women, Silas comes across as a very sweet, kindly older man.\n\nAlpha Bitch: Several over the years:\n\nRuby Button is becoming this.\n\nSinead O'Conner.\n\nMost of the McQueen girls come across like this, with the exception of Carmel and perhaps Theresa.\n\nMaddie Morrison.\n\nAttention Whore: Most of the female cast. And Darren.\n\nThe Baby Trap: Mercedes pretends to be pregnant in order to get her footballer boyfriend to marry her.\n\nBut I Can't Be Pregnant: And after a series of mishaps in which she almost gets found out, Mercedes learns that she is actually pregnant.\n\nWho's Your Daddy?: ...and she doesn't know whether the baby is Riley's, or if it's his father's.\n\nBack from the Dead: Warren was supposedly killed in yet another fire at The Loft, but after he returned, an episode showed just how he managed to escape. Despite the body found was clearly identified as being Warren.\n\nBeauty Is Never Tarnished: Steph remains gorgeous and healthy looking despite dying of terminal cancer.\n\nBetter to Die Than Be Killed: Steph chooses to burn to death in a fire, rather than die slowly of cancer.\n\nNarm Narm Naaaaarm!\n\nBig Beautiful Woman: A first for Hollyoaks with Kelly from Hollyoaks Later.\n\nBig Eater: Brendan Brady is seen eating in so many of his appearances, it's reaching Running Gag status.\n\nBig Screwed-Up Family: The McQueens are this trope.\n\nThe Ashworths could also qualify. Suzanne ended up having twins with Darren, Hannah suffered from Anorexia, Rhys fell in love with his half sister and framed his little brother for drink driving, and Josh ended up with a ruined life because of what Rhys did to him.\n\nThe Costello's also apply. Carl has cheated on his wife twice, once with his son's girlfriend. Riley, also a famous footballer, is now getting married to said girlfriend, who is possibly carrying his father's child. Seth was tricked into believing he murdered a prostitute and almost killed himself over it, and his twin Jason is a Transsexual who was once his sister Jasmine.\n\nIt gets worse for the Costello's, their grandfather Silas is a serial killer who accidentally killed his daughter Heidi on Halloween.\n\nBrainless Beauty: Carmel in spades.\n\nBritish Accents: Hilariously, Hollyoaks tends to feature families who have different accents from one another.\n\nJasmine/Jason Costello has a Cockney accent, but his twin brother Seth has a strong Yorkshire accent.\n\nPossibly justified because until recently, Jason was at a posh all girls school, away from the family. He could have picked the accent up there.\n\nCheryl and Brendan both have Irish accents, but Brendan is from ROI, and Cheryl is from Northern Ireland.\n\nExplained in show by the fact they had different mothers.\n\nPlayed straight everywhere else. For instance, the Savage family - father Dirk and eldest brother Dodger have very strong cockney accents, younger brother Will is well-spoken, and sister Liberty is clearly Northern.\n\nBrother-Sister Incest: Rhys and his half sister Beth, who admittedly met and fell in love before discovering they were related.\n\nBrother Chuck: Jasmine/Jason disappeared from the storyline (which was ongoing) without explanation fairly recently.\n\nThis is actually fairly common for Hollyoaks. A character will receive a lot of focus for a week or so, then suddenly disappear while other storylines take over, with little to no explanation.\n\nPlayed straight with Spencer, Warren's brother. He moved away from the village, and it's unknown whether he even knows that his brother is actually still alive.\n\nCaptain Ersatz/Expy: Unbelievably, this trope applies to places. Hollyoaks is a supposed expy of Widnes, Warrington or Runcorn.\n\nThis is despite the fact the show is portrayed as being in Chester, when realistically, it looks nothing like it.\n\nCassandra Truth: No-one will believe Lindsay about Silas being a murderer.\n\nChekhov's Gun: During a conversation with Silas, Theresa innocently mentions that she read that for someone to be classed as a Serial Killer, they need to have killed at least three people. Silas later kills again, bringing his total of murders in Hollyoaks to three. Silas has killed more than three people elsewhere, but the residents of Hollyoaks only know of two at that point.\n\nCitizenship Marriage: Jacqui and Alek.\n\nClingy Jealous Girl: Surprisingly, Ruby Button has had shades of this towards Sinead O'Conner. She gets spiteful when Sinead and Esther are having fun together, and gets the latter into trouble over something that Ruby herself made her do.\n\nLeanne takes this to the extreme.\n\nSinead herself is becoming this towards Bart and his friendship with Jason.\n\nLee is perhaps a male version of this towards Amy.\n\nCloudcuckoolander: Carmel, the female version of Hiro Nakamura from Heroes (well, in personality terms anyway, according to Fan Sites).\n\nCrapsack World: Not as bad as other soaps. But still fairly nasty. The death rate in Hollyoaks village alone would put people off moving there, especially since it seems to be young adults most of the time.\n\nCruel and Unusual Death: Poor Sarah Barnes dies after her parachute failed to open. She's screaming as she plummets to the ground, and the camera only pulls away at the last minute. Makes matters worse by the fact it was her ex-girlfriend Lydia who tampered with it, even if it wasn't intended for Sarah. The circle of blood on the cornfield at the end just says it all.\n\nAndy Holt ran into a sharpened pole after running away from Mel, who was getting her own back for all the rapes he had committed by giving him the same drug he'd given his victims.\n\nAlistair Longford, India and Texas' elderly grandfather, dies after falling off a mountain. Though given he was on holiday with his young wife Cindy at the time, it's unsure of whether he just 'fell'.\n\nTina McQueen dies in an explosion set off by her psychotic half brother Niall. Not only is she the lone member of the family to die, she was one of the two Myra reluctantly asked to be spared (Niall demanded she could only save two).\n\nHeidi Costello ends up strangled to death by her own father, Silas, in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nCurse: Rae believes that her family is 'cursed' because her two older sisters both died before they were eighteen.\n\nAppears to be tragically true as Rae is murdered by Silas not long after her nineteenth birthday.\n\nDead Baby Comedy: However, Your Mileage May Vary on this one. The Jasmine storyline is what has caused opinion to turn this way. But soap sites are showing that public opinion has turned this way...\n\nDisabled Love Interest: Hayley Ramsey and Pete Hamill are both in wheelchairs, and no less stunning than the rest of the cast.\n\nEspecially in universe; Josh and Rhys Ashworth are both attracted to Hayley, and Ruby has a crush on her Headmaster Pete.\n\nDisproportionate Retribution: After a short lived relationship that she wasn't really into, Ruby Button decides to punish Ricky for dumping her by text by planting cannabis in his school bag. She goes one step further by getting Sinead to tell the Headmaster she had seen a knife at school, thus making sure everyone's bags were searched.\n\nRuby strikes again when Nancy interrupts her study session with Pete; the headmaster she has an obvious crush on. Nancy was relying on a good reference from Pete to obtain her dream job, so Ruby steals his phone, and when the call comes, gives her a bad reference instead.\n\nDomestic Abuse: A past storyline focused on Ste abusing his girlfriend Amy. He beat her, made her cut off her long hair, and lied about their daughter having cancer to get money from people.\n\nThe tables are now turned with Ste being beaten by Brendan, though Amy is quite sympathetic towards him, and tries to help.\n\nDoom Magnet: Tom Cunningham. To date; his parents died in a car accident, he set the house on fire, his baby niece died, his older brother and father figure Max died saving him from a car, and his sister-in-law and mother figure Steph suffered from terminal cervical cancer, before choosing to die painfully in a fire instead.\n\nOh, and now Gilly, a father figure of sorts, is being charged with rape and could potentially go to jail.\n\nCruelly lampshaded by Clare, who used it to get Tom to want to go into a foster home rather than live with Max.\n\nDrugs Are Bad: Fletch & Sasha's slow descent into heroin addiction, complete with sleeping with creepy dealer Nige in exchange for smack.\n\nDumb Blonde: Carmel McQueen. Her cousin Theresa can also count at times.\n\nEnfante Terrible: Holly Cunningham has shades of this, it isn't surprising given who her mother is.\n\nPersephone Hart is a more straightforward example, she lies and bullies, and accuses Sarah Barnes of hitting her when she was just kindly telling her off.\n\nEstranged Soap Family: Plenty of examples through the years. John-Paul didn't return to attend his sister's wedding, and Jem Costello hasn't been sighted despite the fact her step mother was murdered.\n\nEstrogen Brigade Bait: Most of the male characters in the early days. In particular, Kurt Benson, Jambo Bolton, Lewis Richardson and Rob Hawthorn.\n\nEven Evil Has Standards: Warren Fox, surprisingly. When he got drunk with Justin Burton, and they began comparing their past crimes, Justin bragged about how he lied to the police about Becca Dean sleeping with him when he was 15. Warren immediately expressed disgust, which immediately escalated to outright anger when Justin feebly tried to defend his actions as just because Becca had dumped him.\n\nSilas shows shades of this when he's about to strangle Theresa. It's revealed that her baby daughter Angel is there, and Silas backs off, despite being able to easily overpower the child.\n\nExtreme Doormat: Oh, Esther, will you ever stand up for yourself against your 'friends'?\n\nFace Heel Turn: Over the course of a year, Sam Owen went from a withdrawn law student previously falsely imprisoned on charges of arson, to a serial date rapist, before coming full circle & setting The Dog In The Pond on fire; killing himself and four others in the process.\n\nFaking the Dead: Jack, aided by Darren, as a desperate last measure to get out of the debt he was in.\n\nFunny Schizophrenia: Another criticism leveled at the show.\n\nHair of Gold: Blonde Carmel is a much nicer person than her siblings, most of whom are dark-haired. On the other hand, Michaela is also blonde, and is possibly the biggest bitch of the lot.\n\nThings seem to have improved in the last few years, but there was a point about 5 or 6 years ago where literally every single female character was blonde - apart from the nerdy, uptight character who had dark hair.\n\nHowever, unlike her other dark haired siblings, Michaela provided valuable support to her pregnant friend, to Josh during his failed exams, is in college, and possesses a steady income.\n\nEsther Bloom is the only blond out of her trio of \"friends\", and she's a far kinder and sweeter person than the dark haired Ruby Button and Sinead O'Connor.\n\nHollywood Geek: Will is gorgeous despite the nerdy glasses and clothes.\n\nHollywood Healing: Darren not only came home from hospital the very next day after being shot in the stomach, but there was no mention of bed rest or even any form of pain relief.\n\nAmy Barnes also recovered overnight after being in a car accident that left her unconscious. She was also pregnant at the time.\n\nNicely averted with Hannah's friend Melissa, who was a long suffering anorexia sufferer. She didn't get better.\n\nThe Costello family are massive culprits of this. To date Jason was hit by a car, Seth overdosed on steroids, and Heidi burned herself with scalding hot water, and they were all home within a couple of days.\n\nHospital Hottie: Lynsey Nolan. Lampshaded when she was asked to appear on a student radio show as an agony aunt, and later on a live webcast in a 'hot' nurse outfit.\n\nHot for Student: Schoolteacher Becca and the then 16-year-old Justin's relationship.\n\nIll Girl: Steph Cunningham practically lives and breathes this trope after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.. Despite initially having some pretty convincing fainting spells, Steph looks far too healthy to be dying of cancer, with a full head of very thick hair and glowing skin. She's also promoted to martyr status, despite using her illness to get her own way.\n\nIntercontinuity Crossover: The character of Matt Musgrove, played by Kristian Ealey, immediately transferred to Hollyoaks after leaving Brookside (which ended shortly afterwards).\n\nInvisible to Gaydar: Brandon, Ste, probably more.\n\nIt's All About Me: Mercedes McQueen in spades. Because we are supposed to feel sorry for her, despite the fact she learned her lesson on how her actions affect others, when despite being unfaithful to him and treating him badly, Malachy still willingly sacrificed himself to save her from an explosion. Mercedes then promptly seemed to forget him, got engaged a month later and then cheated on her fiancee, Riley with his dad. This is never indicated either to be a result of losing Malachy either, she seemingly just forgets him. When she has the baby and the truth of her infidelity to Riley comes out, she promptly complains that Riley is later wrong to show attraction to other women, despite the fact that she cheated on him and it was clearly her fault.\n\nJacqui McQueen. Do we even need to explain how much of a self-centred, arrogant, hypocritical, bitch she frequently shows herself to be?\n\nIt's a Wonderful Plot: The 2011 Christmas episode with Doug and Steph.\n\nJerk with a Heart of Gold: Jacqui McQueen comes across as a total bitch most of the time, but she does have her moments of kindness. She's the only one to take in Lindsay when the rest of the village had turned against her, she also took in a stray dog, and she attempted to help the homeless Phoebe despite the girl stealing off her. Jacqui also stands up for her family and friends if they need it.\n\nKarma Houdini: So many of the characters.\n\nWarren Fox, who's gleefully murdered several characters and gotten away with it, been involved in blackmail, supplying drugs, still somehow manages to woo half the women in the Village despite being an obvious sociopath, and even being tied up in a burning building that supposedly kills, merely slowed him down.\n\nHe goes one step further by making Seth think that he had murdered a prostitute, which made him try to commit suicide. All to get a single piece of information out of him.\n\nRhys Ashworth definitely qualifies. He and his younger brother are Josh are competing for the affections of a girl, so Rhys spikes Josh's drink, who is later arrested for getting involved in a collision with another car and injuring the people in it. Even his brother getting beaten up by various people and becoming a pariah, going to trial and getting nearly sent down, doesn't let Rhys admit the truth. It takes 6 months later when Josh has finished probation and has returned and their parents nearly splitting up from the pressure, before he finally fesses up... and is immediately forgiven for everything.\n\nSte. For some reason, his later storyline where Brendan seduces him, then beats him regularly, is supposed to make us feel sorry for him. Even though he himself was frequently domestically abusive to Amy, lied that her daughter had cancer to get money from everyone and has been known to be a drug dealer.\n\nTheresa McQueen. After the truth comes out that not only did she sleep with Calvin, got pregnant, then shot him on his wedding day to Carmel, she is forgiven. Instead Carmel blames her sister Jacqui and throws her out of the house for covering it up and gladly lets Theresa stay under the same roof, helping look after the baby.\n\nGaz. He bullied Anita because of the color of her skin and threw paint over her and filmed it on his mobile to send around the school. He and Lauren drove her to the point of bleaching her skin so she could look like everyone else. He then continued to threaten her, along with chasing her into the woods to potentially hurt her more seriously. And now, he's back and apparently forgiven since Anita has left.\n\nLauren Valentine. She ruthlessly turned against Anita, her own best friend, because she dared to be friends with her boyfriend at the time, Newt. She not only teamed up with Gaz to bully her, she also made out that Anita was bulling her, getting her into trouble, and turning Newt against her. Lauren finally comes clean, Newt clearly wants her to suffer for what she did, only for Anita to say that it's okay.\n\nOf the very worst (and arguably tasteless kind), it has emerged that Silas won't be tried let alone imprisoned for the murders he committed, merely institutionalized after being deemed clinically insane by the authorities.\n\nKill Me Now or Forever Stay Your Hand: After Warren finds out that his fiancee Louise is planning to kill him, he hands her the intended murder weapon and tells her to go ahead if she really wants to. Louise actually does pull the trigger... only to find that Warren took the bullets out first. Naturally, he responds by killing her.\n\nKissing Cousins: Riley and Mitzeee.\n\nLaxative Prank: India eats a pizza that Hayley has spiked with laxatives. She wins a contest for a car after an accident.\n\nLove Makes You Crazy: Jake Dean.\n\nAlso Lydia Hart, who ended up killing Sarah Barnes. Lydia's obsession with her spiraled out of control when she realized she and Zoe had a spark between them still, even if the latter didn't want to follow it through, and an attempt to kill Zoe by tampering with her parachute, led to her actually killing Sarah when their parachutes were mixed up.\n\nLove Triangle: Several over the years:\n\nLauren, Newt and Anita.\n\nSinead, Bart and Jason.\n\nBart, Sinead and Gaz.\n\nRiley, Mercedes, Carl.\n\nEthan, Theresa, Rae and Liberty.\n\nMay-December Romance: Maddie seems to think that this is the case when it comes to Jono dating Ruby. They're only a year apart in age, Ruby just happens to be in school still, and Jono is in the first year of Sixth Form.\n\nMoral Guardians: Complaining about sexy appearances of the cast in the media.\n\nWhile it has been rectified since, The Food Commission complained in 2007 that, on average, 18% of the scenes in Hollyoaks showed a character drinking alcohol. The worry was that it would send the message to the younger viewers that it was normal to drink so much alcohol. In more recent times, it's rare to see someone even finishing a drink.\n\nThere was a lot of fuss kicked up over Newt's attempted suicide storyline because the airing of it happened to coincide with the real life story of two teenage girls killing themselves in a very similar manner. Channel 4 defended themselves by stating that they couldn't pluck an episode directly out of a long running series, especially because the events leading up to and surrounding Newt's suicide attempt had been heavily promoted for weeks. They also mentioned that Hollyoaks has dealt with sensitive topics for a long time, and included a number at the end of the program for anyone who had been affected by the storyline.\n\nLoretta was supposed to have a dark secret about her killing a girl when she was younger, along with a friend, who's appearance in the village brings her dark history to light. Despite Loretta, her friend, and the deceased girl being around twelve at the time, and all the same age, Jamie Bulger's mother kicked up a fuss about it. While it's understandable that she would be upset, Hollyoaks is known for bringing such topics to light, and wouldn't have \"glamorized\" what Loretta and her friend had done in the slightest. The storyline was poorly chopped out of the show, and Loretta left soon afterwards.\n\nMs. Fanservice and Estrogen Brigade Bait: Most of the cast. They do sexy calendars of both genders. Many of the ladies will feature in the lower end lads' mags.\n\nBronagh Waugh, avoids being in lads mags, perhaps due to lads' magazine editors' opinions on her looks. Same for Victoria Atkin, who plays Jason Costello. You won't see any of the onscreen mothers (With the exception of the likes of Cindy Cunningham and other younger mothers) doing them either.\n\nRuby Buttons operates on fanservice. It helps that she is played by the curvy Anna Shaffer.\n\nNever Trust a Trailer: The adverts for the huge fire at Il Gnosh in 2010 made out that a lot of people would end up dying. The only person to die was Steph, who chose to burn to death rather than die slowly of cancer.\n\nThe 2012 Valentines trailer also counts; it implies Darren will have to choose between Nancy and Cindy. This never happens.\n\nNo Bisexuals: Averted: Kris is bisexual, as is Ravi.\n\nUnfortunately played straight (pun not intended) with Ste - the moment he got with Brendan the show started calling him gay, despite his previous relationship with Amy.\n\nIt isn't uncommon for gay people to have relationships with the opposite sex before coming out. Not at all. Things aren't that black-and-white.\n\nSeems to be going this way with Doug Carter, who recently outed himself as gay, despite having no homosexual experimentation with men or the very person who caused these feelings, not even a kiss, to actually be sure if he was. Fairly certain that until then, that merely makes someone bi-curious.\n\nOnce again, stuff like this is not that black-and-white. You definitely do not need to kiss or have sex with someone to know you're gay. Most straight people are virgins when they realized they were attracted to the opposite sex. Yes, it is a little strange that Doug is completely gay rather than bisexual, but not for that reason.\n\nBecomes amusingly hypocritical considering at the end of every episode, the announcer offers the Channel 4 website to help people with their sexuality. One wonders if the Hollyoaks writers should perhaps consider reading it as well?\n\nNo Celebrities Were Harmed: Before she joined the show as Mitzeee, Rachel Shenton was noted in various articles for her resemblance to Cheryl Cole. A recent episode lampshaded this by having Brendan disguising her as Cheryl to make Heat magazine think that Chez Chez was a hot spot for celebrities.\n\nNot Quite Dead: Andy, after falling off a cliff into water. Also Clare, in exactly the same circumstances. And of course, Niall following the church explosion because they Never Found the Body.\n\nIt's basically always safe to assume in Hollyoaks that if there's no body, they're not dead.\n\nSubverted with Warren Fox. Ash Roy tricked Warren's mentally handicapped foster brother Spencer into believing that Warren was still alive by texting him from Warren's mobile phone. Ash tried to convince Spencer that 'Warren' wanted him to sell The Loft to him.\n\nLater played straight as Warren actually does return. He manages to survive the fire, and uses a random passer by to take the place of his body.\n\nOireland: Cheryl. Even though she's blonde, the trope still applies.\n\nParental Abandonment: Niall's abandonment by his birth mother Myra McQueen as a baby is the driving force for his murderous actions.\n\nSinead and Finn O'Connor were abandoned by their birth mother Morag because she had extreme postnatal depression with Finn.\n\nPerky Goth: Newt.\n\nNewt's version of Rae.\n\nPimped-Out Dress/Fairytale Wedding Dress: Mercedes' gothic wedding dress that was used in the promotional trailers for her and Riley's wedding.\n\nPlucky Comic Relief: Several:\n\nMax and OB.\n\nDarren Osbourne.\n\nDuncan Button.\n\nMelody Langford turned up after her youngest daughter's body was found, causing a severe mood whiplash when she was played for comic relief in such a somber storyline.\n\nProduct Placement: Well, for any Vauxhall vehicles anyway, these seem incredibly common.\n\nNow that Product Placement is allowed on British Television, Hollyoaks has jumped on board. So far we've seen:\n\nAdidas.\n\nHeat Magazine.\n\nCheryl Cole's single was overplayed during a few episodes, and an entire subplot was based on Mitzeee looking like her.\n\nProfessional Gambler: Darren, circa 2007. Subverted since.\n\nPromotion to Opening Titles: You know if a new character will be a regular if they're put into the opening titles.\n\nPsycho Lesbian: Lydia.\n\nPun-Based Title: Some of the shops and businesses around Hollyoaks\n\nWashed Up, a launderette owned by Tony Hutchinson.\n\nTan and Tumble, Ash Roy bought Washed Up from Tony, and added the option to have a spray tan while you waited.\n\nCincerity, a clothing boutique ran by Cindy, that was previously Tan and Tumble.\n\nIl Gnosh, an Italian restaurant owned (again) by Tony until it got burned down.\n\nLook Sharpe, a day spa made from a renovated Il Gnosh. Also named for Tony's girlfriend at the time, Gabby Sharpe.\n\nCinergy, the above day spa was taken over by Cindy, and renamed.\n\nMOBS is a juice bar in the centre of the village that was originally ran by Max and OB. While it was inherited by Steph Cunningham after Max died, she didn't change the name.\n\nLater renamed to MOOBS after Steph died and Darren and Duncan took over. While it stands for 'Memories Of Our Beloved Steph', 'Moobs' is also a nickname Darren uses for Duncan, as he is overweight.\n\nGot It Taped was a video store that was owned by... Tony Hutchinson.\n\nPut on a Bus: Several. Literally, for some characters. Basically if they don't get killed off, they end up leaving the village for some reason or another.\n\nThe Bus Came Back: This also happens a fair bit.\n\nRape as Drama: Whether it actually happened or not (since the show never explicitly makes it clear), Jacqui getting raped by Gilly (or accusing him of such) is played for every tiny little bit of drama the show could get, to the point of causing Arc Fatigue to some viewers.\n\nThe fact that she kept on and on accusing him, even after he'd been found Not Guilty by a court of law, makes rather more sense now it's been revealed that he did rape her after all.\n\nAlthough by retconning the flashbacks, some viewers felt it was a clear Ass Pull to milk it for more drama.\n\nReality Is Unrealistic\n\nReal Life Writes the Plot: Surprisingly averted the majority of the time, most actors leave to try and go onto something better.\n\nRecord Needle Scratch: The follow exchange between Darren and Frankie is set to pretty music."
