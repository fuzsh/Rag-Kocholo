        "text": "HOLLYOAKS' John Paul McQueen hits rock bottom in upcoming scenes on the Channel 4 soap but as his alcoholism sees him reach new lows, a new theory from Express.co.uk suggests there could be a number of cast exits on the horizon.\n\nBy Charlie Milward\n\nLink copied Bookmark\n\nHollyoaks: Sarah Jayne Dunn's final scene as Mandy Richardson\n\nJohn Paul (played by James Sutton) has been struggling with his addiction to alcohol in recent weeks on Hollyoaks, with the school teacher letting other villagers take the wrap for his reckless behaviour. Unfortunately, he has no way out in next week's episodes of the Channel 4 soap as he decides he is going to drive a bus full of children from the village whilst under the influence. It's not been confirmed whether someone will be leaving the television programme but the official soap spoilers have revealed lives will be hanging in the balance.\n\nThe drama begins next week on the weeknight serial drama, having been previously teased in the show's official spring trailer.\n\nJohn Paul will be joined on the trip by his colleague, Olivia Bradshaw (Emily Burnett), after Nancy Osborne (Jessica Fox) has her right to go revoked.\n\nAlthough he has been confiding in his cousin Prince McQueen (Malique Thompson-Dwyer) about his problems, this is still not enough to make the beloved character stay away from the bottle.\n\nAs he prepares to go on the trip, the school teacher finds a small bottle of vodka in his pocket and decides to drink it.\n\nThis only makes matters worse when the iconic McQueen clan member is made the designated driver of the mini-bus to assort the children to their destination.\n\nREAD MORE: Coronation Street youngster Jack Webster exits in heartbreaking twist?\n\nAs the children grow more and more out of control, John Paul finds it increasingly difficult to concentrate on the task at hand.\n\nUnfortunately, the first hiccup they face is getting lost on their way to the campsite but the situation only gets more dangerous.\n\nWhen the driver decides to shut his eyes whilst behind the wheel, the vehicle crashes and turns on its side because of John Paul's actions.\n\nWith the school teacher getting out of the mini-bus, his colleague Olivia comes to the rescue as she tries to save the children trapped inside.\n\nThis includes Leah Barnes (Elá-May Demircan), Charlie Dean (Charlie Behan), Ella Richardson (Erin Palmer), Mason Chen-Williams (Frank Kauer) and newcomer, Freya.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nIt's almost a natural progression\n\nJames Sutton\n\nIt seems the first casualty could be Freya as Mason tells his school teachers she is trapped under the luggage in the mini-bus.\n\nOlivia believes she can rescue the young girl but soon tragedy strikes and John Paul makes a disturbing discovery as the paramedics arrive on the scene.\n\nBy the end of the week, the beloved character is facing a lot of questions as the loved ones of those injured and possibly killed want answers.\n\nJohn Paul will be grappling with his guilt as it seems there is nowhere left for him to turn and he has to face up to what he's done.\n\nAhead of the episodes airing, it seems there are going to be multiple exits, with the most likely candidate to leave being Olivia.\n\nDON'T MISS...\n\nHollyoaks' Jamie Lomas shuts down two companies with debts of £92,000 [COMMENT]\n\nHollyoaks star Lysette Anthony slams bosses amid race row [COMMENT]\n\nHollyoaks' Amanda Clapham left with swollen thumb from spider [COMMENT]\n\nOlivia only joined the show last year as the fiancée of established character Prince, who made his return to the village after some years away.\n\nShe has struggled to make friends in Hollyoaks and hasn't been accepted by the McQueens because of her prudish attitude.\n\nHowever, if she were to be killed off, Prince would want revenge on John Paul for causing the death of the love of his life.\n\nSome of the children could be making an exit as well, with newcomer Freya a likely candidate to become a victim of the disaster.\n\nGiven how much heartache Charlie has been through recently, he could also be someone who is going to make a departure.\n\nHow well do you know your British soaps?\n\nHow many times has Ian Beale been married in EastEnders?\n\nWhat is the name of Bianca Jackson and Ricky Butcher's son on EastEnders?\n\nOn EastEnders in 2002, who accidentally ran Jamie Mitchell over in his car which caused his death?\n\nHow many times has Corrie's Steve McDonald been married?\n\nWhat happened to Emily Bishop in Coronation Street?\n\nWho murdered Maxine Peacock in Coronation Street in 2003?\n\nWhich incident in 1993 killed off four characters in Emmerdale?\n\nWhen did the show stop being known as Emmerdale Farm?\n\nOn what date did Hollyoaks air its first episode?\n\nWhat was the name of the much-loved Coronation Street pet dog who was put down in April 2020 after 14 years?\n\n1996 saw the arrival of one of Hollyoaks all time bad boys and rival of Kurt Benson, but who was he?\n\nWho is the longest serving character on Coronation Street?\n\nWho shot Phil in EastEnders?\n\nHow many fires have there been at Corrie's Rovers Return?\n\nGet out of my pub, you’re no soaps fan\n\nYou're either too young to remember the big lines or have better things to do on weekday evenings\n\nCasual viewer\n\nYou watch them sometimes so you kinda know what's been going on\n\nDie hard fan\n\nYou love watching the soaps so much your entire week is planned around when they air\n\nWith his girlfriend Ella having suffered a miscarriage and having been locked behind bars last year as a result of the County Lines storyline, this could be a heartbreaking end to his time on the show.\n\nIt would launch new plots for Ella as she deals with the loss of her ex-boyfriend as well as the grief Nancy will go through having lost the last person connected to her late sister.\n\nMason could also be killed off as he was only introduced to the show late last year as a member of the newest family in the village.\n\nThe youngster hasn't been involved in a lot of storylines since he arrived but his death could spark a dark new direction for the Chen-Williams'.\n\nAt the moment, writers are keeping the conclusion of the bus crash a tightly guarded secret but could this theory wind up to be true?\n\nThe actor who plays John Paul, James, has spoken out about the latest development in his character's addiction storyline.\n\nJames explained: \"It's almost a natural progression for John Paul [following the abuse storyline he was a part of last year].\n\n\"It's going to be a long-running story because once you're an addict, you're always an addict.\n\n\"But John Paul has a loving and supportive family around him, so you will get to see that caring side of the McQueens – which is also important.\"\n\nHollyoaks airs weeknights at 6:30pm on Channel 4. First-look Hollyoaks airs weeknights at 7pm on E4 or viewers can watch the new episode from 7am the same day on All 4."
