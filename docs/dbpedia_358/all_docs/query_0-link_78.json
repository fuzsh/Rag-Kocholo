        "text": "Hollyoaks has had some very iconic couples over the years - but none more so than John-Paul McQueen and Craig Dean AKA McDean.\n\nAs far as viewers knew, the couple, played by James Sutton and Guy Burnet, were separated - as John-Paul returned a single man during his most recent time in the soap.\n\nJohn-Paul's final scenes aired in March this year, leaving fans wondering whether he'd ever get back with Craig as he fled to Singapore with his son Matthew, as he got a call from his ex.\n\nAnd it's finally been confirmed they're together - with a very subtle hint.\n\nIt was Craig's mum Frankie Osborne's funeral this week, and it was revealed Craig couldn't make the funeral because he was in Singapore.\n\nEagle-eyed viewers soon put two and two together, taking to Twitter to share their joy.\n\nOne said: \"McDean basically just got confirmed! Love that!\"\n\nAnother added: \"Well I guess that's confirmation John Paul did answer Craig's call...\"\n\nA third shared: \"OMG Craig's in Singapore!!! #Hollyoaks #Mcdean .\"\n\nWhile this could've been wishful thinking from McDean fans, Hollyoaks confirmed the news with a reply to a fan saying: \"Good spot!\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Craig and John-Paul will return to Hollyoaks village together in the future.\n\n*Hollyoaks is on E4 weekdays at 7pm"
