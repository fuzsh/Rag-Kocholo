        "text": "Rounding up a week in Hollyoaks (26th-30th December 2016)\n\nFollowing last week’s revelation that Cameron couldn’t possibly be baby Daniel’s Dad, Tegan pushed Leela to tell Cameron the truth as soon as possible. Well, with Daniel being mixed race, it was surely only going to be a matter of time before he found out anyway? Cameron was devastated when he discovered the truth and with Leela keeping schtum about the Father’s identity, Cameron was left to come to his own conclusions, and attacked Zack outside the hospital, assuming him to be the Father. Zack denied all knowledge, leaving just one more potential Dad.\n\nPredictably, baby Daniel’s Father was revealed to be Louis. I’m really not sure whether or not this was meant to be some sort of shocking twist. Of course, we all thought that Cameron was the Dad, so that part was a shock, but once Tegan announced that Daniel was mixed race, that narrowed it down to just two suspects (i.e the only two black men in the village, Louis and Zack). Hollyoaks love to create drama and as there’s no drama in Zack being the Dad, it had to be Louis. As Louis’ a nice guy, he wants to be there for Leela and the baby but something tells me that’s not going to go down too well with Simone…\n\nThere was trouble in paradise for Ryan and Amy this week as young Leah continued to make life difficult for him. Ryan was angry when he discovered the Christmas present he’d bought for Amy in the bin and quickly realised that Leah was behind it. Things got worse for Ry Ry when he discovered a note for Amy asking “do you know what your fiance’s been up to?” and decided that Mercedes, who’d been winding him up earlier in the day, must be behind it. Demonstrating some excellent policing skills, Ry Ry arrested Mercedes based on no evidence whatsoever but was forced to let her go when he realised that Leah was responsible. Back at the house, Ryan was frustrated by Amy’s reaction to the incident and insisted that Leah should receive a harsh punishment. However, Ry Ry soon found himself in the dog house when, in anger, he told Leah about Ste’s violence towards Amy…\n\nLeah was devastated by Ry Ry’s words and confronted Ste when he arrived with presents the next day. As Ste prepared to tell Leah the truth, Amy decided that Leah wasn’t quite ready to hear about Ste’s violent past and told Leah that Ryan had lied. The thing is, Leah’s a smart kid and she’s already witnessed Ste behave violently before. Of course, Ryan shouldn’t have opened his mouth in the first place but I can’t help but feel that Amy’s made the situation worse by lying. This is Hollyoaks, and Leah will inevitably find out the truth one day and it’s going to be even harder to take knowing that she was lied to. Still, we did get some lovely scenes between Ste and Amy and little Ela-May Demircan was fantastic in the scenes in which Leah confronted Ste!\n\nMeanwhile, there was frustration for Grace and OB when OB’s private detective, Nigel, informed them that he’d found out nothing of any interest about Eva. However, a slip of the tongue from Liam about Eva’s childhood soon gave them more to go on and so the quest for dirt on DI Dipstick was back on. Eventually, Nigel came good and informed OB that Eva was Jack’s niece. Jack was shocked by this new information and insisted that the family left for Ireland that night. Sadly for Jack, the rest of the family weren’t having any of it. After hearing Jack’s outburst, Charlie was once again scared into silence and it was then that Nancy finally put her foot down and told Jack that she and Darren were taking the kids home. With nobody on his side, Jack decided to return home and confront Eva…\n\nBack at the Osborne’s, Eva spent so long fannying about that the rest of the family, minus the kids, arrived before she’d had a chance to kill Jack. Eva wasn’t interested in Jack’s attempts to defend himself but made him tell his family why she hated him so much. For these scenes, Hollyoaks went back to the 1960s in a series of flashbacks showing just what went on between Billy and Jack. It turns out that Billy wanted revenge on a lad who’d soaked his trousers and Jack had been forced to deliver the apparent fatal blow. Jack then lied to the police that Billy had killed the boy. Frankie, Darren and Nancy were horrified by Jack’s actions but before they’d properly had a chance to process the news, Grace, Esther and Kim burst in. Darren made the idiotic mistake of trying to wrestle Eva’s gun off her, and of course, it went off, shooting poor Esther in the head…\n\nI’m quite interested to see where this all goes next but I am a bit worried about where it leaves Eva. Looking online, there seems to be very mixed opinions on her character but I like her, and think she’s been one of the better additions to the cast this year. The show have actually put some effort into explaining her actions and I do feel a certain amount of sympathy for her. Plus, as Jack pointed out, if she was genuinely a bad person, she would have killed him long before now. In other soaps, Eva’s actions might spell the end of her character, but that doesn’t have to be the case in Hollyoaks. Half the village should really be in prison for the various crimes they’ve committed! I suppose it all depends on whether or not the show see any long term future for the character or if she was just brought in purely to play out this story and then leave. She’s listed in the Radio Times cast list for the week of episodes commencing 9th January so we’ll just have to wait and see…\n\n5 Things we Learnt This Week:\n\n1. Ste really, really loves pork scratchings.\n\n2. ‘Lewd behaviour’ is fine as long as you’re getting paid.\n\n3. Don’t ask Grace to cook garlic bread unless you enjoy eating burnt food.\n\n4. Simone can highly recommend ‘Baserate Booze’. Perfect for the likes of Goldie.\n\n5. Eva’s a bit rubbish at this hostage malarkey. She didn’t even lock the front door!\n\nOne Last Thing:\n\nI wanted to finish by talking about Sienna and her story. This week she and Warren headed to the memorial garden to bury Nico’s ashes and when they got there, they discovered a cardboard cross dedicated to Sienna dated “3rd January 2017″. I’m guessing Sienna put it there herself but I don’t get this story at all. I know that Sienna wanted to take revenge on Warren by harming Joel in a “you took my kid away so I’ll take yours away” sort of way. I just don’t understand why she’s now pretending she’s got a stalker and where that fits in to the revenge thing.\n\nCharacters Featured:\n\nAmy, Cameron, Charlie, Courtney, Daniel, Darren, Esther, Eva, Frankie, Grace, Goldie, Harry, Hunter, Joel, Kim, Leah, Leela, Liam, Lisa, Louis, Lucas, Mercedes, Nancy, OB, Peri, Prince, Ryan, Sienna, Simone, Ste, Tegan, Tom, Warren and Zack.\n\nPast Characters Mentioned:"
