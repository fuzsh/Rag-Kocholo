DCI Vera Stanhope is a talented, compassionate and unconventional detective who heads up a team at Northumberland and City Police. She's prickly, blunt, almost always wears her distinctive hat, and doggedly pursues the truth of each case - even if it lands her in hot water.\n\nAs the seasons have progressed, we've learnt more about her backstory, including her difficult relationship with her father.\n\nWhere have I seen Brenda Blethyn before? You might recognise the two-time Oscar nominee as Mrs Bennett in the Keira Knightley version of Pride & Prejudice, or from her roles in Atonement, Secrets & Lies, Little Voice and the Clémence Poésy version of War and Peace.\n\nSpeaking ahead of season 11, Blethyn revealed that she can never say never to future Vera seasons. \"At the end of filming every season, I think, 'Oh, thank the Lord I’m going home. Never again,'\" she said. \"But it’s like having a lovely slap-up meal. You’ve eaten too much. You couldn’t eat another morsel. And you’re shown the menu again. 'Take it away, take it away!' But then, a week later, you get hungry again.\"\n\nDavid Leon plays Joe Ashworth\n\nWho is Joe Ashworth? Joe was Vera's first assistant on the TV series, and helped her solve many a case. He left in 2017, but is back in 2024 for season 13 - yet he's certainly different.\n\nSpeaking about returning to Vera and what fans can expect from Joe, Leon said: \"A period of time has gone by. You grow and evolve as a person through those cycles of life and the character reflects that. When I agreed to come back part of the discussions we had were, ‘What would it mean for the character?’ To pick up where we left off was not hugely interesting to me, personally. And I don’t think it’s that interesting for the audience.\n\n\"There needed to be a justification, a reason, for why Joe has come back. Along with a readdressing of the balance in terms of the dynamic of the relationship between Joe and Vera.\" Fans will find out in season 13 episode 1 just what brings Joe back into Vera's working life.\n\nWhere have I seen David Leon before?
