        "text": "What was your reaction when you found out this story was coming up?\n\n“It was quite funny at first, because obviously me and Jacqueline both knew that it was going to be me in the costume and we both thought that I’m not very scary! But once we watched those scenes back, it did actually look quite scary because Abi was wearing her mask and was dressed all in black, so it was hard to tell who it was.\n\n“I think it looked quite good on screen and I also think it’s great that it was Abi – I don’t think many people will have expected that!”\n\nWhat were Abi’s reasons for following Lauren?\n\n“Abi is annoyed with Lauren, because she insulted her about Ben before this. She’s quite embarrassed about that and she’s also just annoyed at Lauren always getting so much attention. That’s the thing, really – she just wanted to scare Lauren.\n\n“I don’t think there was any malice in it, but Abi has just reached the end of her tether now that Jay has dumped her. She just wants somebody to notice her, really!”\n\nHow do you think the EastEnders fans are going to react?\n\n“I think it’s going to be like the reaction I had when Abi killed Tramp – people saying, ‘Oh, you killed Lucy!’ I was reading the script thinking, ‘I wonder who’s going to be following Lauren?’ and then I was shocked when I got to the part where it turned out to be me!”\n\nWe’ll see things get a little bit aggressive, as Abi attacks Lauren in the aftermath of this next week! What was it like to film those scenes?\n\n“It’s always great to do a stunt scene. Jacqueline is always up for that too. It was weird because being aggressive doesn’t really come naturally to me, especially acting alongside Jacqueline because we get along really well, but it was quite fun to film.”\n\nAre you glad the show is keeping so many secrets like this now?\n\n“Definitely! I think that’s what makes the show so good at the moment – you just don’t know what could be coming up. It was great the other week when Barbara Windsor returned and nobody had a clue. That makes things exciting and I think it’s a good move by the producers, because it’s really clever.”\n\nWe are seeing a different side to Abi in general at the moment. Are you enjoying that, or would you like to see her return to her old self?\n\n“I’m really enjoying it. I’d say don’t bring the old Abi back because I love doing this! It’s good and it’s the right time now that Jay has dumped her. People had said before that she could maybe change, but I think it’s the right time now that she is growing up.”\n\nWere you sad to see Abi and Jay break up?\n\n“It was sad! Me and Jamie were both saying that it felt like the end of an era! I do enjoying working with him, so it was sad.”\n\nWe’ve also heard there’s an interesting dynamic coming up between Abi and Ben…\n\n“Yes, obviously Abi has always liked Ben as they’ve been best mates for a long time. I think Abi is just confused at the moment after being dumped by Jay, and now she sees Ben as the closest thing to him. It’s not that she’s getting fixated on Ben, but she starts to have a level of affection for him that she didn’t have before.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed working with Harry [Reid, who plays Ben] on the storyline. He’s lovely and we get along really well. We’ve got a lot of scenes together coming up too. It’s nice when you get someone who you just naturally get on with, because it makes it more of a natural relationship on screen.”\n\nWould you like Abi to be Lucy’s killer?\n\n“I honestly don’t know who it is as it could be anyone, but I would like it to be Abi because it would be a challenge for me to act it. Why not? It could be fun to film!”\n\nAre the cast feeling excited or nervous about the upcoming live week?\n\n“I think it’s a bit of both really, but at the moment it’s more excitement because it feels like ages away, so we’re not really that nervous! There’s a real buzz about the place at the moment, especially in group scenes because we’re all trying to figure out who the killer is and discussing all the clues!”\n\nWill it be another busy Christmas for the Brannings this year?\n\n“I don’t want to give too much away, but Christmas isn’t really heavy for the Brannings – but then New Year is going to be good for them!”\n\nAre you happy to stick with EastEnders for the foreseeable future?\n\n“Definitely. You never know what’s around the corner, but I’m definitely happy to stay there. I love working on the show, so I’m glad that Abi didn’t go off to uni!”\n\nCongratulations on winning the Best British Actor prize at the BBC Radio 1 Teen Awards this month.\n\n“Thank you – I couldn’t believe that and I still can’t! I didn’t think I’d win because it was a public vote. I didn’t really think about it, so it was crazy when I won! I’m so grateful to everybody who voted and on the actual night I was so nervous.”\n\nYour on-screen father Jake Wood is also having lots of success on Strictly Come Dancing! Did you know beforehand that he was a good dancer?\n\n“I had an idea that surely Jake wouldn’t go on the show if he was bad, but then when I saw him perform for the first time, I thought, ‘He’s amazing – he kept that quiet for all those years!’\n\n“I think he’s got a good chance of winning because he’s definitely a good enough dancer. I also love the fact that he’s never had dance rehearsals or anything before this – he’s learning in his training now. Obviously I’m biased, but it’d be great to see him win it!”\n\nHow does it feel to be in the running for ‘Most Popular Newcomer’?\n\n“I’m absolutely thrilled! It’s not something that I’d thought about before it happened, but obviously now that I’ve made the shortlist, I’m over the moon. To think that anyone has watched me and liked my work makes me really pleased.”\n\nEastEnders stars have taken home the ‘Newcomer’ prize in the past couple of years, so do you think you’re in with a good chance?\n\n“I’d say there’s an equal chance all round, really. I don’t really watch the other soaps because I don’t have the time, but I have looked at the other people in the category out of interest and I know they’re all very good. I think it’s going to be quite tight. I don’t think at all that I’m in any way a front-runner!”\n\nIs there anything you’d say for why our readers should vote for you?\n\n“If you’ve enjoyed my work, then please do vote for me because it would mean an awful lot. But I think if people want to vote, they will, regardless of me saying it! If they do, I’m very, very grateful.”\n\nOut of the scenes that you’ve done, do any stand out as ones that you’re really proud of?\n\n“I think I’ve been really lucky to have some big, big storylines. A lot of characters come in and stay in the background for a long time, but with Joey, I was lucky enough to come in and really get some good stuff.\n\n“I’m really pleased with the scenes I’ve done with Jacqueline [Jossa] and I was very proud of how it played out. Before the Joey and Lauren storyline started, I think people had heard about the ‘kissing cousins’ and had a lot of reservations about it. But I was really pleased to see that once Joey and Lauren’s relationship ended after the car crash, people had changed their minds and said, ‘Well actually, they’re so good together that we want them to get back together!’\n\n“I was also really pleased with the aftermath of Derek’s death. It was nice to show a vulnerable side to Joey, which usually isn’t there.”\n\nDo you have any words of support for your co-star Adam Woodyatt (Ian Beale), who’s up for the ‘Serial Drama Performance’ prize?\n\n“I can say loads! When you’re in the show for so many years, you’re not going to have huge storylines every year, so a lot of people forget just how good these long-serving actors are. The viewers are used to Ian Beale being there and they’re fully convinced by him, but they don’t necessarily take note because it’s always been like that.\n\n“For Adam to get nominated after 28 years and to have impressed people with his recent storyline is fantastic. It was when Ian’s relationship with Mandy was breaking down that I really started to watch the show and I thought, ‘Wow, what a fine actor’.\n\n“For Adam to have made enough impact last year for people to vote for him, I think that speaks absolute volumes. It’s absolutely deserved if he wins.”\n\nAre you nervous about the live NTA ceremony next week?\n\n“Oh yes, I’m incredibly nervous – I always am for things like this! It’s a time where you’re totally out of your comfort zone, because you’re presenting yourself as yourself rather than as a character, which you’re most used to and more comfortable with.\n\n“Whether people say they want to win or they don’t, you always are going to experience a huge feeling of pressure, knowing that everything on that evening is building up to that moment where the winner is announced.\n\n“Once I know the decision, there’ll be a sense of relief because I won’t have to worry about it any more. I think I’ll be ever so nervous, but also excited because I’ve never been to the NTAs before and it’s a great opportunity.”\n\nWith Derek dead, do you think Joey will have a happier life now?\n\n“I do, yes. I think often people need to be broken down completely to come out happier on the other side. Joey was a very guarded character and him having this once-in-a-lifetime breakdown is a realisation for him that things have got to change. Things will change and you’d assume things are on the up, but there are still bridges to cross with Lauren.\n\n“There’s a sense of relief, though, that there’s no longer somebody meddling in everything that Joey does and trying to make life harder. I’d like to think there’s some happiness to be had! Certainly I think his attitude will change, because it’s a massive turning point in his life.”\n\nLauren still has a drinking problem, so will Joey become concerned over that?\n\n“The drinking problem hasn’t been focused on that much yet in terms of their relationship, so how much Joey knows about it, I don’t know. Often people turn to alcohol to relieve certain situations, so if Joey and Lauren are to have some happiness in the future, maybe she won’t need to drink so much. One would hope so, anyway!”\n\nIs there any chance of us meeting Joey and Alice’s mother?\n\n“We haven’t heard anything of it, but I think it would be quite nice. There’s certainly another dynamic to be had if you are to introduce the mother, but that’s completely in the hands of other people.\n\n“If it happens, I think it’d be interesting to explore that relationship. I’m sure that relationship will be something completely different to what we’ve seen before. The most hard-faced people can be really quite soppy with their mothers so it’d be interesting to see, but I have no idea whether it would happen or not!”\n\nDo you think Joey will make some proper friends on the Square?\n\n“I think Joey would need to find a best friend completely different to himself. He could possibly get on well with Tyler, but at the moment there’s too much of a competitive edge there.\n\n“The only person around who’s his age would be Fatboy, but even so, I just don’t see those two being best friends! I think they could get along, go out and have a drink, but I can’t see them telling each other their deepest secrets.”\n\nWho would you like more scenes with?\n\n“There are many, many people I’d love to work with. I’ve always said that I’ve always loved the work of Gillian Wright – I think she’s a fine actress. But that would be difficult as I probably wouldn’t want to work with her as Joey, because I don’t see what space there is to go there. It just doesn’t seem possible!\n\n“I think it’d be fun to get some scenes with Kim, because I think that would be really funny. That could be an amusing dynamic because she’s so openly sexual with anyone, while Joey’s quite strait-laced. But it really is such a pleasure to work with anybody on EastEnders, because there is such a down-to-earth cast and everyone just wants to get some good work done.”\n\nAfter a few weeks filming at the set of EastEnders, how are you settling in?\n\n“I’m really enjoying my time so far. Everyone’s been really lovely, and it’s great coming in and doing something new every day. As an actor, it’s always nice to keep yourself busy and occupied!”\n\nIs there anyone in particular who you’ve made friends with among the cast?\n\n“It’s a lovely cast in general, but you do tend to become closest with the people who you’re doing the most scenes with. At the moment for me, that’s Jamie and Jasmyn. Jamie has really taken me under his wing and shown me the ropes.\n\n“Jake Wood, who plays Max Branning, is my mentor on the show, so he’s been a great help too. But just generally, everyone has been really welcoming.”\n\nWhat was your first day on set like?\n\n“Everyone always says this, but it all happened so quickly – from the moment that I went to my audition to the moment that I started the job. I remember being slightly nervous coming up on the train to Elstree, but as soon as I got here, I was put at ease by how nice everyone was. I had the usual fear of starting a new job, but it was fine as soon as I started.”\n\nHow would you describe Joey Branning?\n\n“Joey is a great character to play. He’s actually a weird one to describe, because he’s so different to everyone that he comes into contact with! Obviously his relationship with Derek is going to be very volatile and there’s a lot of resentment there. Joey can be very dark, too – not that he would admit it! There are definitely some parallels between him and Derek, which are really interesting to explore.\n\n“But there’s a lot more to him than that, which is why I’m really enjoying portraying him. He’s also a bit of a lothario, and when it comes to his family, he’s very protective towards Alice. So depending on who you are when you meet Joey, you can get a number of different responses from him.”\n\nDerek can be a scary man at times. Is Joey a match for him?\n\n“He is, because that parallel is there between them. Joey doesn’t see it, and he would never allow himself to be compared to Derek, as he views his father as the lowest of the low! But Derek can see the parallel and that is going to unsettle him, because he’s not used to anyone standing up to him.\n\n“Joey just doesn’t care about anything that Derek has got to say. He also holds a trump card, because Derek has Alice in his life and he wants to be on good terms with Joey too – he wants the full set and to have his family around him. While Derek is going to be confrontational with Joey at times, ultimately he does want his son to like him. So Joey’s always got that advantage and he can use it to really get to Derek…”\n\nDo Joey and Alice get along well?\n\n“It’s a lovely relationship between Joey and Alice. The dynamic is quite an unusual one, because Joey became a father figure to his sister at a very young age once he became the man of the house. When you see Alice’s scenes with Joey, it’s almost like she’s talking to her dad because he tells her off every now and then!\n\n“But there’s also a lovely bond between them. Joey can be quite stern towards Alice, but it’s only because he cares about her.”\n\nWe’ve already heard Joey and Alice’s mother mentioned in a few scripts. Are you hoping she’ll be brought in?\n\n“It would be interesting, because it would bring in another dynamic to affect Derek. Ultimately, Derek hasn’t had to face Alice or Joey for all these years, but he also hasn’t had to face up to the person that he used to be in a relationship with. That would obviously cause a lot of drama, so it could be quite fun to play around with.”\n\nLucy Beale becomes Joey’s first love interest in the Square. What can we expect from those two?\n\n“Well, when Joey joins the Square, he finds out very quickly that Derek is being a real git to Lucy. Joey then becomes quite protective over her, and that’s quite attractive to him because he does like protecting people.\n\n“Joey also knows that if he’s going to be around Lucy, then it’s going to annoy Derek! He will absolutely relish that, because anything which riles up Derek will show his true colours. That’s definitely what Joey wants to happen, as he hopes to convince Alice that Derek is a really bad guy.\n\n“On top of all that, there will be a slight attraction between Joey and Lucy, as he can see that she’s a pretty girl. But certainly at the start, it seems as though she’s being used by Joey to annoy Derek.”\n\nHave you had many scenes with the likes of Max, Tanya and the wider Branning family?\n\n“I’ve actually had scenes with all of them now. Joey comes into the Square and shakes up the family a bit, so they’re definitely all involved on some level. It’s been really nice working with them all.”\n\nHow long have you been acting for?\n\n“I’ve been working for the last couple of years now, primarily on the stage. That’s where all my training has come from, so I’ve been working in various stage shows across the country over the past two years. I’ve done a bit of filming work here and there, but this is my first regular TV role, so it’s been really interesting and I’m learning a lot.”\n\nWhat do your family and friends think of you getting such a big role?\n\n“I think they’re even more excited than I am – but that’s always the way, isn’t it? (Laughs) Everyone has been really lovely and supportive. I think my family in particular are just so pleased that it’s all come good, because obviously when you go into acting, there is always that question of whether you’ll make it or not. I’ve been doing pretty well up until now, but they’re over the moon that I’ve got this big break.”\n\nYou’ve joined EastEnders at a time of change as there’s a new producer in charge. What’s the atmosphere like on set at the moment?\n\n“There’s a lovely atmosphere. I haven’t really got anything to compare it with because I wasn’t here before the producer changeover, but there’s a really positive atmosphere. I can see that everyone’s really happy with their storylines as well, because at the moment there’s a lot of decent drama going on in the show!”\n\nHow does Maddie feel when she discovers George’s secret?\n\n“Maddie is very upset, but she’s also a little bit angry that she wasn’t told about it sooner. She starts to question why she was kept in the dark, especially as Callum was so involved in the whole situation.\n\n“It’s really hard for Maddie that the two people she’s closest to had this big secret. But then she starts to understand a bit more and you’ll see her try to help. It’s a really tough time for the whole sixth form group, though.”\n\nHow does Maddie try to help George?\n\n“Maddie gets involved in the search for George, so you’ll see her leave Hollyoaks to look for him. It’s a united front amongst the sixth formers, as it’s such a crazy and serious situation. It’s also Maddie who decides to get the police involved.\n\n“Everyone’s really confused about why George didn’t confide in them, so all the secrecy is hard to deal with. So even though everyone is banding together to help, Maddie is harbouring a lot of angst towards Callum. She’s upset and offended that her boyfriend didn’t tell her the truth.”\n\nWas it nice to get involved in a meaty storyline for the show?\n\n“I loved that, as it’s what everyone wants. What you crave is to get involved in a really big, meaty storyline like this. Whenever there’s a story involving one of the sixth formers, then the rest of us get brought in eventually, because we’re all part of the same web. I really enjoyed going out on location and shooting Maddie and Callum’s hunt for their best friend.”\n\nMaddie and Callum have been going out for a while now. Do you think they’re a good match as a couple?\n\n“Honestly, no! Initially I thought they were, because they’re so different and opposites attract. But they could actually be too different. Also, Maddie just brings problem after problem, because she’s got so many issues and that just complicates things even more. At the end of the day, Callum is quite a young boy and he just doesn’t understand what’s wrong with her.”\n\nWhy is Maddie so territorial when it comes to her friendships?\n\n“It’s a good question! I think it’s because in her family, she’s the middle sister, so she feels quite displaced at home. Once she’s found someone who she’s really close to, she becomes afraid of them leaving her or abandoning her, so she tries to make everybody want to be her friend.\n\n“When Maddie’s got her group, she doesn’t want anyone else coming in. On top of that, she’s particularly like that towards Ruby, because Ruby is very confident with boys and her sexuality, whereas Maddie isn’t like that at all.”\n\nIs it fun to play a character who has a mean side?\n\n“It can be! Sometimes after a while I think, ‘No, not again!’ (Laughs) But it is fun, and it’s good to play a character who gets a reaction out of people.”\n\nDo you have to justify those mean moments to play Maddie properly?\n\n“Yeah, I try to. When you’re playing a character who’s being mean to someone, you do have to try to justify it somehow. But Maddie does take things to the extreme, which you will see!”\n\nCould Ruby and Maddie ever be friends?\n\n“Never say never. I think with Maddie, it’s just a case of her getting to know someone. But if she doesn’t know somebody very well, she refuses to give them the benefit of the doubt, sets her boundaries and ends up appearing quite the bitch.”\n\nWhat do you hope the future has in store for Maddie?\n\n“I’d like to see Maddie at home or with a family member, so the audience can get a better idea of where she’s coming from. I think it would help to explain why she is the way she is, and maybe girls could identify with her a bit more.”\n\nHow are you finding your time on the show in general?\n\n“I’m loving it. It’s very busy but it’s a lot of fun. We all get on really, really well here and tend to form bonds quite quickly. I spend a lot of time with Lucy Dixon (Tilly), Steven Roberts (George) and Mandip Gill (Phoebe), but I get on well with everyone.”\n\nHow do you feel about being in the running for an Inside Soap Award?\n\n“It was completely unexpected. I never thought that I’d be up for ‘Best Actress’ at all, so I’m over the moon. It’s pretty big, so I’m a bit giddy about it!”\n\nHow do you rate your chances?\n\n“To be honest, I’m just pleased with the nomination – I’ve not even thought about winning the award. I’m up against some really tough competition, so just to get the nomination is brilliant.”\n\nYou must be pleased that there are quite a few nods for the Osborne clan this year…\n\n“Definitely. This year for the Osbornes has been completely manic. Jess Fox is absolutely brilliant, so it’s overwhelming to be up against her for ‘Best Actress’. It’s also brilliant that the story of Sienna trying to steal Nancy’s life is up for ‘Best Storyline’. I’m gripped watching those scenes myself at the moment!”\n\nDo you think Hollyoaks can continue its recent awards success at the ISAs?\n\n“I really hope so, because the show has gone from strength to strength. We were an underdog at the British Soap Awards this year, but we came away with five prizes. We’ve been pumping so much effort and energy into the show, and I think that’s really paying off with what’s on screen. I’m really enjoying being here, and it’s the same for the rest of the cast too. There’s a great buzz.”\n\nYour main storyline this year has been Esther’s bullying ordeal. How do you look back on the filming of those scenes?\n\n“It was very intense. While filming it, you kind of go into autopilot. You come into work, you do what you’ve got to do and then you go home. However, when I watched the story on screen and read everyone’s feedback, it was just phenomenal. People really bought into the storyline, and that’s exactly what I wanted.\n\n“I think bullying is such a big issue. It’s everywhere – and it affects both adults and children because it can happen in the workplace as well as in schools. That’s probably why the story was such a big hit.”\n\nThe storyline boosted Hollyoaks‘ ratings and also led to an increase in the number of young people seeking help over bullying. Did the impact take you by surprise?\n\n“It was genuinely a huge surprise. I knew that we had a few charities on board who were helping with the storyline, including BeatBullying and Samaritans, so I did expect some sort of impact but I never expected it to be so big.\n\n“I know that a lot of young people were contacting the charities and mentioning our storyline, so we got people opening up about bullying. It was incredible to think that we did that. Still to this day, people contact me to say that the storyline helped them, which is really nice to hear.”\n\nDo you give advice to fans who are in the same situation as Esther?\n\n“It’s a massive responsibility, so I usually just point them in the direction of BeatBullying’s cyber mentors or the Samaritans, as they’re the experts who people should really be talking to. I always try to help, but I would never want to give someone the wrong advice, so it’s best to tell people about the professionals who can help.”\n\nAre you surprised that Esther has been able to forgive her bullies?\n\n“I think it’s nice that Esther has been able to move on, as it shows people that you can grow from a situation like that. Yes it was a massive deal what they did to Esther, but she’s not holding a grudge and it shows once again that she’s the bigger person. Esther and Ruby have always had a love/hate relationship, and Ruby now realises that what she did was wrong. With Sinead, she always seems to be around and Esther can’t get rid of her!”\n\nAre you pleased that Esther and Tilly have finally got together?\n\n“I am, and I think a lot of people were willing it to happen. To finally see them happy together is brilliant. Esther always had a place for Tilly in her heart and that’s been going on now for two years. Now that they’re together at last, I’ve had a lot of response from people on Twitter who are saying, ‘Finally – thank God they’re together!”‘\n\nDo you think they have a long-term future?\n\n“Definitely. They’re like best mates, and I think relationships should always start with two people being such good friends. With Tilly and Esther, they already know each other so well, which hopefully means they can make it work.”\n\nTilly has now finished at sixth form, while Esther has another year there. Could that cause some problems between them?\n\n“It could do! Esther doesn’t want to be left alone and she doesn’t want to be forgotten about. She certainly has some hang-ups and insecurities about it. However, deep down, I think Esther knows that Tilly would never leave her like that. Hopefully it will work out fine.”\n\nCan we expect more tension between Esther and Sienna?\n\n“Definitely. I think Esther and Sienna rub each other up the wrong way all the time. Esther always seems to be there when Sienna doesn’t want her to be, so we’ll definitely see more from that. I’d love for Esther to be involved in Sienna’s comeuppance. I’ve been screaming at the TV while watching the storyline, as it’s so frustrating that so many people are fooled by Sienna!”\n\nHow do you feel about being part of Hollyoaks Later this year?\n\n“I never, ever thought that my character would be in Hollyoaks Later, so I’m absolutely over the moon to be involved as it’s so much fun. It’s something completely different, which is always nice. We’re filming it at the moment and it’s all going well. It’s a bit more fast-paced than filming the main show, although there is more time to plan when it comes to the scripts.”\n\nIs Esther’s Later storyline going to be as frightening as we’ve heard?\n\n“It’s pretty chilling! I can’t give much away, but nothing ever runs smoothly for Esther, does it?”\n\nHow is Linda feeling now that Dean is back on the Square?\n\n“Horrified – it’s just her worst nightmare! I think she is trying her best to move on, but that’s impossible when her attacker is there all the time in her face. I think it just makes it harder. I imagine it’s one of the hardest things to get over anyway, but with his presence being so there – physically there in front of her – I think it makes it impossible for her.”\n\nHow is Linda’s relationship with Mick being affected?\n\n“I think they put a good front on, but actually underneath it all, things are quite strained. It’s all come out and things have changed between them. I don’t think that they’re being as open with each other as they used to be. I think they try to protect each other from things, and in doing so they leave each other more isolated because they’re not communicating. They’re sort of brushing things aside.\n\n“At the moment, I think that Linda’s relationship with Mick is about trying to manage him and make sure he’s okay. Even though this is something that happened to her, now I think she feels it’s very much like Mick’s burden that he’s carrying. If anything, he’s almost made it his grudge or his thing, and maybe that is the case because he feels so responsible for not having protected her and for not being there at the time.\n\n“For Linda, I feel like she’s dealt with a lot of stuff around it and wants to put it behind her. When she went to the police and told her family, that helped her to be free of it a little bit.”\n\nWould you say Mick is holding Linda back from moving on?\n\n“I don’t think it’s intentional, but I don’t think they’re in the best place. They can’t be at the moment with all this going on. It’s still so raw and present.”\n\nWhy does Linda urge Mick to move on from the past next week?\n\n“I think that Linda is trying to move everything forward and accept what has happened. As far as she’s concerned, she’s feeling stronger. She went to see Dean and confronted him, and that has given her a little bit of herself back in a way. She instigated that and it was all about her and what she wanted to say to him.\n\n“Linda is just trying to find a way of making this work now for everybody. Ultimately, she knows Mick inside out and deep down she knows he misses Shirley. She’s just trying to make him happy. She’s always trying to make him happy.”\n\nWhy does Linda choose this moment to finally come clean about how she feels?\n\n“I think because it’s another night of the same conversation that they’ve had again and again. Also, she’s heavily pregnant now and in the back of her mind there will always be the niggling doubt that it could be Dean’s. That’s there for both of them and it’s a massive elephant in the room.\n\n“I think you’ve got to remember that when you’re pregnant, you feel vulnerable and hormonal and all sorts of things. She’s probably trying to think ahead to having a new baby around again for the first time in 20-odd years and wanting to get things to a good place before that happens – that’s why I think she kind of brings it to a head.”\n\nDo you think Linda and Mick are avoiding talking about the issue of who the baby’s father is?\n\n“Totally! It’s burying your head in the sand, because where do you go with it? How do you start that conversation and how do you finish it? What do you do? Where does it go? It’s an impossible conversation to have in a way.”\n\nWe see Linda fall down the stairs at The Vic after an argument with Mick. How involved were you with the stunt?\n\n“I leant across the stairs, put my arms out and fell onto a crash mat! That’s as involved as I got! I watched the stunt actor and it was incredible. I don’t know how they do it!”\n\nWhat was it like filming the birth scene once Linda has been rushed to hospital?\n\n“I loved it! I really enjoyed getting my teeth into it. I thought the scripts were brilliant. I love working with Danny and it gave us a chance to do some really lovely stuff together.”\n\nHow do you think it’ll be having a baby on set?\n\n“I don’t know, actually! It’s going to be interesting. It’s a whole different ball game and wherever I am now, I’m pretty much always going to have a baby with me. Although the baby part doesn’t bother me at all – it’s the toddlers where it starts to get really interesting, because that’s when you can’t get them to sit in the same place. I imagine that it will be okay, though – we work in a good way and can accommodate any cries! I’m looking forward to having a baby to cuddle.”\n\nOnce the baby has arrived, Mick wants to find out who the father is but Linda is more reluctant. Why is that?\n\n“I think she’s scared that it might not be Mick’s. She is just terrified! There’s a scene at the hospital where they talk about what it would mean for them – it’s her biggest fear. Now she’s got her baby and she knows that’s her baby, her priority is that baby. She will do whatever she has to do to be the mother of that baby.\n\n“If Mick can’t be part of that, it can only mean one thing for them and that is just devastating. So I think that is why she doesn’t want to know, because she’s just scared and terrified that it could be Dean’s.”\n\nDo you think the baby will help bring the Carters back together?\n\n“No – this is EastEnders! There’s bound to be more tensions and arguments and I can’t ever see it being a bed of roses. It will be nice for us as a family unit I think, but with the extended family, it will probably just cause more trouble.”\n\nWhat have been your highlights of the last year?\n\n“Oh my gosh – there have been so many! I loved some of the more intense, heavier episodes – I’ve really enjoyed working on those. I have to single out Jennie Darnell, who directed the rape and Christmas scenes. I just loved working with her so much.\n\n“I also really loved the day at the swimming pool when Mick did the swimming gala and we all jumped in the pool at the end. It was the longest day! It was so hot and the swimming pool was heated, so we were just melting! I can remember thinking, ‘I so wanna jump in that pool’ and we all did it and they didn’t get the shot, so we all had to dry off and do it again! I look back at that as a really fond day, I loved that episode when it was on!\n\n“There’s so many highlights, though. This job has brought me so much – so many amazing things. I’ve made incredible friends for life. It just all feels like a highlight, really. I can’t really single anything out.”\n\nHow do you look back on the Live Week?\n\n“That was really great. It was good to be here and to be part of it – I really loved that. I had the live proposal scene, but compared to some of the others, I didn’t have masses and I was quite grateful for that, as I think that I got to enjoy it as well. That was an amazing thing to be part of.\n\n“I loved being part of Christmas too. For me, watching EastEnders on Christmas Day, there’s something really special about it. I think of all the EastEnders Christmases I’ve watched over the years, like when I was a little girl, so that is a pretty incredible thing.\n\n“I also really enjoyed an episode I did with Jessie, Linda and Tameka – the lock-in at the pub. I loved that episode, really loved it. Sometimes, you just get these gems. You couldn’t do that all the time because you would have no life, you need weeks where you just come in to do a few scenes, but when you do get those scripts and you can really work on them, it’s great.”\n\nHow does it feel to be in the running for 4 Soap Awards?\n\n“I’m quite excited and slightly anxious about it. I think the anxiety comes from the fact that I’ve only been in EastEnders for six months, so to be nominated for Best Actor is slightly overwhelming.\n\n“I also feel slightly guilty, because there are some really good actors in the show – especially Adam Woodyatt with some of the stuff that he’s been delivering lately. I think his big episodes just aired a little bit too late in the season, but he definitely deserves an award over me and I’ll be the first to admit that.\n\n“I’m proud to be representing EastEnders, though, so I’m excited about it.”\n\nYou’re up for Best Actor, Sexiest Male, Best On-Screen Partnership with Kellie Bright, and Spectacular Scene for Johnny coming out to Mick. Which would you most like to win?\n\n“Of course Best Actor would be nice – that would be an honour as it is voted for by the viewers, so I am thrilled that I have made the shortlist in such a small amount of time. But it would be nice to win On-Screen Partnership, because I’m nothing without Kellie and she’s been a real strength to me.\n\n“I’m also very proud of the impact that Mick and Johnny’s scene had. It didn’t just have an impact on the gay community, but people in general. I’m an actor playing a character, but because of my media persona, people might have assumed that I’m homophobic or that Mick would have reacted to Johnny coming out in a completely different way. It was a surprise to people when Mick just said, ‘Come here boy, I love you’.\n\n“That scene was beautifully written and I’ve had many, many letters from young gay men who came out because of it. I love what I do as an actor because it’s a great job, but things like that make you realise how much of an impact your work can have on people’s lives when you’re in a soap. I hadn’t quite realised that and it’s quite a life-changing thing.\n\n“As for Sexiest Male – I’m pushing 40, I’ve got a beer belly and I’m growing a pair of tits. So to every pot-bellied man out there, there’s hope for you all. But I’m very proud to be representing EastEnders. I’m passionate about it and I’d want to win it for us as a collective, rather than as a personal thing.”\n\nHow has working on EastEnders compared to what you’d expected when you first signed up?\n\n“I’ve got a lot more respect for soap actors now. I don’t care who you are – it’s a massive test to be playing a character day in, day out with the amount of dialogue and the number of scenes you have to do every day. You have to be on the ball all the time.\n\n“I think there can be a snobbery towards soaps, and I’ll hold my hands up and say that I probably would have been one of those people. When you make movies, you can sometimes look down on soap actors. Now I’ve got a new-found respect, just because it’s really hard work. It’s very rewarding, but it engulfs your life completely. You’re playing your character more than you have time to be yourself, which doesn’t usually happen on movies.\n\n“But I’m also enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. I thought I’d struggle a bit, but I’m absolutely loving working on EastEnders.”\n\nWhen you first joined, Mick was in almost every episode for about a month. Has the workload died down since then?\n\n“No, not at all! I had a little week off which meant that I wasn’t on screen for about three weeks, but now I’ve come back, they’re really pushing me. That’s what I love, though – I want to be busy and there’s no two ways about that.\n\n“It’s a case of trying to find that middle ground between having exciting material to work with, but also having a life outside of the show. I’ve got a newborn child at home, who arrived two days before I started shooting on EastEnders, so I’m also going home and dealing with that. That’s been pretty tough, but like I said, the material is great and I’m really buzzing off that at the moment. Mick is a really great character to play.”\n\nMick and the Carters have been an instant hit with fans. Did you expect that, or has it taken you by surprise?\n\n“We hoped they would be a hit, but [executive producer] Dominic Treadwell-Collins definitely took a big risk by bringing in a whole new family to take over The Vic. None of us had met before, so we were all just thrown in at the deep end, but we immediately bonded.\n\n“What’s made it work and kept it fresh is that there’s a chemistry between us and there’s something in the air when we work together. We’re inspired by each other and I treat them like my own family now. It’s like I can’t remember when I didn’t know them, as they’re a massive part of my life.\n\n“There’s been a few negative comments, but it’s mainly been positive. I think there were a lot of people who wanted to see me fail, because there’d been a lot of hype. There’s a lot of haters out there for me, but I think coming into EastEnders was probably the best move I’ve ever made because it’s changed people’s perceptions of me so much.”\n\nFrom the comments we’ve seen online, fans don’t want you to leave too soon. Would you like a long-term future with the show?\n\n“As it stands now, I’m absolutely loving it and the character is very interesting. I haven’t even scratched the surface with Mick yet. He’s a strong family man, but we know that he’s got some issues after being in care as a kid. There’s a lot of anger there, which he has to keep under wraps constantly, but he’s also very loving.\n\n“I can see myself doing a long stretch easily, and I did say to Dominic when I signed up, ‘As long as you’re around, I’m with you’. I’m not going anywhere, as long as I can still go off and do a couple of films a year, because I still love to make movies.\n\n“I want to make quality films – not the shit ones that I admit I’ve sometimes made in the past because I’ve needed to pay the bills. I don’t need to do that now, because I’m in a job that gives me security. That means I can choose movies that I want to do – ones that will make an impact on people and hopefully raise debate.”\n\nYour first punching scene airs this week as Mick loses his temper with Dean…\n\n“Everyone’s been waiting for that one! There was a big build-up to me coming into the show, and I think everyone assumed I was going to come into the show as a gangster. Actually, one of the reasons I signed up was because I sat in front of Dominic and he told me that while Mick would be an alpha male, he’d also be a family man who was in touch with his feminine side and wears a pink dressing gown! I was loving all that stuff.\n\n“I’m no fool, though, so I know that everyone’s been dying to see me swing a punch! It’s been a five-month wait, but believe you me, when the punch finally comes it’s worth it!\n\n“Dean deserves it, too – he’s lucky that he gets away with just one smack in the mouth, to be honest with you! Mick warns him beforehand, but he doesn’t listen. Dean is like a tornado when he comes back into the Square and he needs to be slowed down a bit. Mick Carter’s the man to do the job!”\n\nIt’s a big week for Mick next week. Can you tell us a bit about the drama ahead for him?\n\n“Mick doesn’t really remember much about his childhood, except for being shifted from house to house when he was in care. The reason he’s got such a strong relationship with Linda and loves her with all his heart is that he’s known her since he was really young. She’s all he’s really known love-wise.\n\n“Mick was told the story about nearly being drowned as a child quite late in life, and it’s really stuck in his head. A few things are said next week that just don’t add up, so Mick accuses Stan of being the one who tried to drown him. He has a bit of a Columbo moment and tries to work things out.\n\n“Mick realises that it couldn’t have been his mum who tried to drown him, so it must have been Stan. He gives him a taste of his own medicine and just loses it. Like I said, Mick has this thing inside him where he could just snap and smash a room up!\n\n“I can’t give away what the outcome of it is, but it’s going to be a massive shock to the audience. We’ve got some massive stuff coming up.”\n\nHave you enjoyed working with Timothy West on such an intense storyline?\n\n“Of course – he’s the guv’nor and he’s a veteran. It’s great to be working with someone of his calibre and that’s another reason why I came into EastEnders. As an actor, all you ever crave is to be inspired by other actors, because that keeps you on your toes.\n\n“Tim has brought something to the part that we never thought he would. On the page, Stan is a nasty and evil character, but Tim does it with an element of charm so that he’s still quite loveable. Tim has obviously thought about that a lot.\n\n“I saw an interview where Tim said that he didn’t think older characters in soap have been represented in the right way, as sometimes they have been clichéd and 2D. He’s bringing so much more to it, and it’s interesting to wonder where our on-screen relationship is going to go. At the moment we don’t know, and that’s the other thing about being in a soap, you’re constantly kept in the dark!”\n\nYou’ve also had some powerful scenes with Danny-Boy Hatchard who plays Lee…\n\n“Yeah – it was quite a fleeting visit because he was only in 10 episodes, but he is coming back and I think that’s when we’re going to really delve into the dark side of how affected Lee really is by his experiences in the army.”\n\nAs Mick and Linda’s marriage is so strong, do you hope it stays that way rather than one of them having an affair?\n\n“We’ve sat down and said this ourselves – let’s not have a clichéd or obvious storyline. It’d be easy for Mick to go and have an affair with somebody, but I don’t think he’s that sort of man. He’s too devoted to have an affair, and of course if that did happen, where would we go after that?\n\n“Who knows what the future holds. With that said, there is something else that’s going to happen very soon. I can’t give away what it is, but it’s really heavy…”\n\nAre you enjoying Theresa’s storylines with Joel this year?\n\n“Yeah, I’ve absolutely had a ball this year. Hollyoaks Later was absolutely fantastic, and it’s all been quite exciting because Theresa has been a bit of a badass. It’s a different role to what Theresa is usually like, so I think Joel has influenced her to be a bit naughty.”\n\nWere you surprised when you found out that Theresa’s bad girl side would re-emerge?\n\n“Yeah, I was surprised. It started off with some changes in her clothes and make-up, and then it went from there. I was a bit shocked at first because I thought, ‘This isn’t Theresa – how am I going to play her? It’s completely different to what she’s normally like’.\n\n“But I think it makes sense because sometimes when you’re with a boy, you try to fit in with him to make him like you more.”\n\nWhat brings about Theresa and Joel’s return to the village this week?\n\n“They’ve run out of money in Dublin, but it’s mainly because Theresa wants her baby back. She wants to be there in Kathleen-Angel’s life and look after her. Theresa is a good mum, but she just makes these weird choices. We don’t find out too much about what happened when Theresa and Joel were away, but it’s clear they’ve been up to no good.”\n\nWhat kind of a reaction do they get when they turn up at the McQueen house?\n\n“It’s definitely not a friendly welcome – there aren’t any enthusiastic hugs or smiles! The reaction mainly is, ‘Where the hell have you been?’ It should be like that, really, because Theresa pretty much ran off without telling anyone what she was doing.\n\n“Myra kicks her out shortly after she arrives back, because she thinks Theresa has been extremely irresponsible. Also, Joel has stolen a bracelet for Theresa and Myra isn’t happy when she finds out about that. Myra says, ‘We don’t do that in this family!’ But Theresa’s reaction is – ‘That’s a bit hypocritical, of course we do that – it’s what our family is all about!'”\n\nIs Theresa angry about being kicked out?\n\n“Well, what really annoys her is that Myra won’t let her take Kathleen-Angel when she goes. It’s a bit of a weird one, because Theresa does seem to want the baby when it suits her. Other times she’s happy for Myra to have her, because she’s a mothering type and will always look after her. It just depends how Theresa feels at the time!”\n\nWe know that Theresa manages to get Kathleen-Angel back and uses her in some scams…\n\n“Yes, Kathleen-Angel is a key part of Theresa and Joel’s plans when they go out stealing. They know they can use Kathleen-Angel and the pram as a little decoy. It probably isn’t the best thing to do, but Theresa still thinks she’s a great mum!”\n\nJoel also decides to target Tony, doesn’t he?\n\n“Yeah, but Theresa isn’t so sure about that. Tony’s always been the person to look after Theresa – he was the first person she met when she arrived in Hollyoaks, and he always took her under his wing a little bit. So the fact that Joel wants to rob Tony’s house is a little bit of a step too far! Tony is Theresa’s friend at the end of the day, and you don’t rob from your mates.\n\n“Theresa also has another thing to worry about, because Jacqui is on her case in these episodes. So Jacqui becomes a bit of an annoyance for Theresa, really.”\n\nIs Theresa shocked by everything that happened with Mercedes and Riley when she was away?\n\n“There’s definitely been a lot going on, but I think Theresa is a little bit selfish. She has her own little world where certain things are important and others aren’t. Kathleen-Angel is really important, and Joel is too at the moment. Theresa is kind of aware of what everyone else is going through, but she doesn’t care as much as she should.\n\n“As a viewer, the big McQueen episodes have been great to watch, though! I love the fact that I know what’s going to happen next, but I still can’t wait to see the next episode.”\n\nWould you like Theresa to stay bad for a while?\n\n“I love the fact that she’s a bit of a badass at the moment, but I think I’d also like to see Theresa back to her old ways and dressing like she used to dress. I think it’s great she’s got a boyfriend, but we all know that she’s not a one-man person, really.”\n\nDo you think Theresa and Joel don’t have a long-term future together?\n\n“Hopefully if she can last with a boyfriend that would be nice, but we all know what she’s like, so who can say? But I absolutely adore working with Andrew Still and I love how he brings out Theresa’s bad side with their fighting and their frustrations. This is his first job and he’s done so well – he’s really portrayed his character fantastically.”\n\nWhat was the reaction like to your racy Hollyoaks Later scene?\n\n“There was a lot of reaction on Twitter, because a lot of people heard beforehand about me being naked. In the build-up there were lots of tweets saying, ‘When are you getting naked?!’ I missed the scene when it went out, but it was quite a cool reaction. Nobody said anything nasty, which was a relief!”\n\nDo you ever miss the Theresa and Will pairing?\n\n“I do miss Will and Theresa’s romance a little bit, because they were a bit quirky and had comedy scenes together. Because Will was so different to what Theresa is like, it was quite fun. Different boys bring out different sides of Theresa – I’ve actually just worked that out!”\n\nWhat else is coming up for Theresa?\n\n“Hopefully things are going to get bigger and better. At the end of the day, it is Hollyoaks and I can’t see things getting quiet.”\n\nHow does it feel to have well-known faces like Nikki Sanderson and Jeremy Sheffield joining the cast?\n\n“It’s really great, I find myself getting a bit starstruck. With Nikki, I’d already met her before and I think she’s absolutely lovely.\n\n“It’s amazing that people from big programmes will come onto our show. I think a lot of people don’t give Hollyoaks credit for what we do. We make some absolutely fantastic TV, and for other people to come and join us is just amazing.”"
