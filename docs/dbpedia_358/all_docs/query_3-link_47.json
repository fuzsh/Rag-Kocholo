        "text": "Hollyoaks actress Helen Pearson is reportedly quitting the Channel 4 soap after 15 years.\n\nThis comes as her character Frankie Osborne's ex-husband Johnno Dean makes a return to the village.\n\nA source told The Sun that the 57-year-old actress was off to \"pastures new\" and that it had been a \"hard decision\".\n\nHer character first appeared on the screen back in 2002 along with her family Johnno, Jake, Debbie and Craig and has been involved in a number of controversial storylines.\n\nBack in 2007, Frankie was accused of being a homophobe after she accused John Paul of trying to turn her son Craig gay. She then refused to believe the truth about her son's sexuality and was disappointed when he came out to the rest of his family, but she did eventually accept his relationship with John Paul.\n\nLater, when her other son Jake was accused of raping Nancy, she refused to believe it and accused her and Justin of trying to ruin his life.\n\nEventually, Jake admitted that he had tried to rape Nancy and Frankie was horrified at what her son was capable. He ended up abducting him and Charlie and tried to kill them both. Nancy managed to save Charlie and Jake was found alive.\n\nMore recently, Frankie had a shock fling with Diego Martinez - which was revealed after her husband Jack was spared jail.\n\nBut actress Helen, herself, has also been subject to controversy in the past.\n\nBack in 2015, Helen was banned from the roads after being caught drink driving on the M6 in Staffordshire.\n\nThe actress pleaded guilty at North Staffordshire Justice Centre in Stoke-on-Trent, to driving while over the alcohol limit and having no insurance and was banned for 26 months."
