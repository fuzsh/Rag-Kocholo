        "meta_description": "Former cop J.L. McCabe -- aka \"The Fatman\" -- has built a remarkable record of convictions in his new career as a district attorney, thanks mainly to his gruff, tact-impaired manner and his willingness to bend the rules when it suits his purposes. Unfortunately, those same qualities also have earned him a substantial number of enemies. Jake Styles, his handsome young special investigator, frequently goes under cover to help the Fatman get the evidence he needs. McCabe's office staff also includes enthusiastic rookie Derek Mitchell, an assistant district attorney, and Gertrude, a wisecracking secretary.",
