        "text": "Charlie Dean tries to find his biological dad in Hollyoaks this week - leaving Darren Osbourne devastated.\n\nAfter the teen goes missing following some heartbreaking news, Darren is worried that he might lose him forever - with Charlie's family all begging him to come home.\n\nViewers of the Channel 4 soap will remember that Charlie's dad was Justin Burton, who exited the soap in 2009 after a dramatic storyline that saw him go on the run.\n\nREAD MORE: Hollyoaks villains now - awards show bust-up, Corrie star ex and famous siblings\n\nAs Hollyoaks fans wait to see if Charlie finds his dad, Daily Star takes a look inside the life of Justin Burton actor Chris Fountain.\n\nAward winner\n\nPrior to his soap fame, Chris had a number of TV roles in series including Bob & Rose, Blood Strangers, Where The Heart Is and The Royal.\n\nHowever, he rose to fame on Hollyoaks in 2003 as Justin Burton, where his character soon became embroiled in a number of huge storylines, including his relationship with Becca Dean and his friendship with local gangster Warren Fox.\n\nHe secretly dated Warren's sister Katy Fox too, but their relationship had its ups and downs - with the couple splitting up later on.\n\nAlong with being revealed as the father of Nancy Hayton's son Charlie Dean, Justin was at the center of lots of dramatic episodes that had viewers on the edge of their seats.\n\nIt is no surprise then that Justin actor Chris was nominated for multiple awards during his time on the soap.\n\nThis included Sexiest Male at the British Soap Awards 2006, 2007 and 2009, as well as Best Actor at the Inside Soap Awards in 2007 and 2009.\n\nHowever, Chris won Best Actor at the British Soap Awards in 2008, as well as Best Storyline for Justin and Becca's affair in 2006.\n\nDuring his time on the soap, he also made a number of reality TV appearances, including performing alongside S Club 7's Jo Meara on Just The Two Of Us.\n\nChris took part in the third series of Dancing On Ice in 2008 too, skating with Frankie Poultney.\n\nThe pair became runners up in the series and narrowly lost out on first place to Suzanne Shaw and Sam Greenfield.\n\nOne year later in 2009, Chris announced that he had decided to quit Hollyoaks and left the soap later that year - but it was not long before viewers saw him make a return in another popular soap - Coronation Street.\n\nSoap axe\n\nChris landed another huge soap role when he joined ITV's Coronation Street in 2011 as mechanic Tommy Duckworth.\n\nTommy was previously played by Joseph Aston between 1992 to 2000, with Chris taking over the role and subsequently becoming involved in storylines such as Tommy's romance with Tina McIntyre.\n\nHowever, his time on Coronation Street came to an end in 2013 when a video of him dressed as a masked rapper called The Phantom showed the star speaking obscene and offensive lyrics.\n\nITV bosses immediately sacked the actor, with Chris Fountain later releasing a statement apologising for his actions, saying: \"I would like to sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused.\n\n\"I am deeply ashamed by the lyrics and very much regret my behaviour.\"\n\nSacked for 'gross misconduct', a senior Coronation Street source told The Mirror at the time: \"It was the only action we could take.\n\n\"Chris left us no choice with what he has done and this seemed to be appropriate action. Everyone at ITV signs contracts which have a code of conduct and Chris is in breach of his. These videos were shocking and disgusting and Chris couldn’t defend them. No one could.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an ITV spokesperson confirmed: \"Chris Fountain’s contract with ITV has been terminated as a result of the unacceptable comments he made in a number of online clips.\"\n\nChris has since addressed the video during an interview with podcast Mancs on the Mic, hosted by Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas and his brothers Scott and Adam.\n\n\"The context of the stuff that I said [in the video] was horrendous. I would never think to say that to anybody,\" he said.\n\nAfter the video resurfaced, Chris explained: \"My life, my job, my image, my reputation – everything was just ripped away within 24 hours. I didn’t leave my house for four days.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I was meant to go on This Morning and then that got cancelled because they didn't want me on there. Then I parted ways with my agent. Then there was no work.\n\n\"It was just this constant thing. Then after a while I was like: 'I think I’m depressed, I think I’m going through depression here'.\"\n\nHe added: \"Then it got to a point where this isn’t just sadness now. This is something else. My whole body is f*****. My head just feels like a swamp. Even to this day now, I don’t think I’m the same person now that I was before.\"\n\nStripping off\n\nThree years after his Coronation Street exit, Chris appeared in a touring production of The Full Monty - where he stripped off alongside stars including fellow Hollyoaks alumni Gary Lucy.\n\nSpeaking to Yorkshire Live about working with Gary, Chris said: \"Gary had actually left Hollyoaks before I joined but we did the Dancing on Ice Tour together and we’ve been good mates ever since.\n\n\"It’s great working alongside him but to be fair the whole cast are a really good bunch of people.\"\n\nHe has since appeared in the Aladdin pantomime at the Manchester Opera House in 2009, along with Departure Lounge at the Waterloo East Theatre in London during 2010.\n\nAlong with his theatre roles, Chris has since appeared back on our TV screens too in series including 2018's Girlfriends.\n\nHealth battle\n\nIn 2022, Chris revealed he \"could have died\" after suffering a mini-stroke that left him unable to speak properly.\n\nThe actor said he was terrified when he woke up one morning in August unable to articulate well and spent five days in The Royal London Hospital where doctors diagnosed a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) after finding a blood clot in his brain.\n\nChris' blood clot was reportedly caused by an undiagnosed hole in his heart, which will require a small operation to repair.\n\nSpeaking about his health battle, Chris told Daily Mirror: \"The doctors said they saw some damage to the left-hand side of my brain which is where your cognitive abilities are controlled from.\n\n\"What’s scary is if I hadn’t have called 111 when I did and got to hospital so quickly I don’t know if that clot could have travelled to the wrong place in my brain, I could have died. That clot was like a ticking bomb in my head.\"\n\nCorrie cast reunion\n\nChris reunited with former Coronation Street stars known as the 'Weatherfield Brat Pack' last year, as they attended the 2022 Just Giving Awards.\n\nThe actor was pictured alongside former stars including Jason Grimshaw actor Ryan Thomas and Craig Harris star Richard Fleeshman.\n\nSharing the reunion snap on Instagram, Chris captioned the post: \"Special night. Special people.\"\n\nCo-star Ryan was at the awards after he raised more than £162,000 for the mental health and suicide prevention charity, CALM, which helped fund over 20,000 helpline calls and inspired many people to come forward and ask for help.\n\nRichard Fleeshman also shared the snap on his Instagram page and paid tribute to Ryan, saying: \"Proud to have been in attendance at the Just giving awards to support my amazing pal @ryanthomas84.\n\n\"He was nominated for his incredible fund raising efforts last year. There were so many inspiring people in that room who’ve raised insane amounts of money often in the face of huge personal adversity, a truly humbling thing to witness.
