        "text": "IN the history of Hollyoaks murders, blonde bombshell Becca Dean’s brutal jail cell stabbing is one of the most memorable.\n\nIt’s been nine years since village hottie Becca left the show following a dramatic storyline involving an affair with pupil Justin Burton.\n\nThe shamed teacher was sacked, taken to court and eventually jailed.\n\nIt was behind bars that Becca saw her sad demise, leaving behind troubled sister Nancy Hayton – who is still on the show.\n\nSo what has the actress who played Becca done since leaving the Cheshire-based soap?\n\nAli Bastian landed a role as PC Sally Armstrong in crime series The Bill, where she stayed until 2009.\n\nThe actress then appeared on Strictly Come Dancing and finished third with her partner Brian Fortuna, who she dated for several months afterwards.\n\nAli dated her on-screen husband Kevin Sacre, who played Jake Dean, until 2006 and was also in a two-year relationship with professional rugby player Nick Kennedy.\n\nShe later got engaged to musician Tom Clay in 2013.\n\nNow 34, Ali has been off our screens recently – apart from a brief appearance in crime comedy series Death in Paradise.\n\nShe has been focusing her efforts on the stage since 2010.\n\nAli has starred in West End dance show Burn The Floor, Chicago, Breathless and Agatha Christie’s Verdict.\n\nShe recently finished filming British feature film Undercover, in which she returned to her police officer routes to play DC Baker."
