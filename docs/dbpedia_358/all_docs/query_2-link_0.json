Sacre portrayed the character between 2002 and 2008, before making a return on 5 October 2009.[1][2] In March 2010, Sacre was axed from the series by Paul Marquess during his major revamp and cast cull. Jake made his last appearance on 6 August 2010.\n\nCreation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late-mid 2002, it was announced that regular character Steph Dean's family would appear on the series. Max Brown who secured the role of Kristian Hargreaves, originally auditioned for the role of Jake. However actor Kevin Sacre was the successful applicant.[3] Jake and his onscreen brother Craig Dean (Guy Burnett) were introduced as two of four new male characters introduced in late 2002.[4]\n\nIn early 2010 it was announced that Lucy Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer, Paul Marquess then took over the role.[5] It was soon revealed that he planned revamp Hollyoaks, changing the productions team,[6] then began a cast cull starting with the axing of three established characters.[7] Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their characters would be next to depart from the series, stating that there was a general feeling on unease.[8] One month later the cast cull continued as Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters, during this it was revealed that Jake would leave the Hollyoaks once more at the end of Scare's current contract.[9] He is set to finish filming in early 2010 and depart on-screen after the conclusion of a story about his unbalanced love-interest Loretta Jones (Melissa Walton).[9]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first signs of Jake's nasty personality started after discovering wife Becca Dean (Ali Bastian) had been having an affair with former school pupil Justin Burton (Chris Fountain). Becoming aggressive and manipulative, Jake beat up Justin several times and, on one occasion, physically attacked pregnant Becca. After being rushed to hospital, Charlie was diagnosed with leukaemia. Jake offered himself as a donor, being Charlie's father, however doctors informed Jake and Nancy that Jake was not Charlie's biological father, and therefore must have been conceived during Becca's affair with Justin. Jake was furious but refused to admit Justin was Charlie's father. Jake grew more out of hand and even more controlling of Nancy. On their wedding night, Jake wanted to have sex with her, however she did not. Steph entered the flat, stopping Jake before he got out of hand and raped her. Nancy and Jake split up and she told him she was filing for full custody of Charlie. Jake began a vendetta against her in order to make her look bad. Jake ended up kidnapping Charlie and attempted to kill himself and Charlie.\n\nDomestic abuse charity Tender praised the soap opera's portrayal of Jake attempting to rape Nancy. A survey conducted by the group found that 96% of participants thought the scenes were effective in bringing the issue to viewers' attention. Discussing the reasons behind the attempted rape, 68% thought Jake craved control, while 30% put his actions down to mental instability and 1% blamed abuse suffered when he was young. The poll also revealed that 54% of respondents thought Jake should receive counselling and 45% felt he should serve time in prison. Tender stated, \"As a national platform, Hollyoaks played a vital role in educating the public about the issue of abusive relationships.\"[10]\n\nOn 11 April 2008, Kevin Sacre announced his departure on the Hollyoaks website, and confirming he has filmed his final scenes.[11] When quizzed over his decision, Sacre said, \"I have been here since I was 24 and I turned 30 in March. I decided that once I turned 30 I'd go and explore other avenues. We have a lot of good actors on the show and it's good to see them go on to do great things because people are always saying that Hollyoaks actors are rubbish, which is so unfair and untrue. I'd love to go and do something and people say 'oh look there's Kev, he's doing well and he's one of our lot.\"[11][12]\n\nIn July 2009, it was reported by entertainment website Digital Spy that Kevin Sacre had agreed to return to Hollyoaks briefly later on in the year.[1] The Channel 4 official website confirmed the characters return in October.[13] On the character's arrival, he appeared to have changed and his mental health had improved greatly. This led to the announcement of his release.\n\nStorylines\n\n[edit]\n\n2002–2008\n\n[edit]\n\nJake arrives in Hollyoaks with his family.

She later explained that Jake and Debbie intended to attend the funeral but missed their flights.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nRuth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture criticised Jake's 2009 return branding it as unsuccessful, also stating: \"Sometimes a returning character can bring a much needed shot in the arm to a soap [...] but that’s because those characters were liked in the first place. [...] So far, the only point of Jake’s return has seemed to be to show us that being in a psychiatric ward isn’t the permanent sentence Hollyoaks would have previously had us believe.\"[14] For the show's portrayal of Jake and Becca's relationship, they were nominated for \"Best Couple\" at the 2004 Inside Soap Awards.[15]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
