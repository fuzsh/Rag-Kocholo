        "text": "I didn't know the new actor who took over the role of \"Ollie Morgan\" is gay, IRL. MetroUK did a pride month feature that included him and his coming out story\n\nToo bad he has the same name as a fairly well-known, gay porn star (Gabriel Clark) .. lol!\n\nI like Ripley. .. A little bit of Brooke goes a long way, though.\n\nI like Shaq.\n\nI don't like Summer at all and think this thing with Sienna is a real stretch. .. Oh, and the \"Simmer\" squad is nutzoid.\n\nThey seem bound and determined to put John Paul, James, and Ste in the same orbit. .. Not into that. .. I'd prefer all three guys find someone new, or at least one of them find someone new, and the other two in a triangle with someone new.\n\nAnd since characters seem fluid at the drop of a hat, can Shaq go bi- for James? .. lol! .. I like their chemistry. .. I notice that actor (Omar Malik) played gay \"Omar\" in the Leeds Playhouse production of \"My Beautiful Laundrette.\"\n\nSpeaking of Craig Dean, I think it's been long enough, and they should just bite the bullet and recast the character. Burnet's never returning (which is fine by me, btw), and a recast could actually help create new drama with the other boys in the village.\n\nCraig's not only JP's ex-, but he's supposed to be co-parenting Matthew. When last heard, Craig had been living with JP and their son as a family down in Singapore; then Craig up and ran off with his personal trainer. .. So reintroduce Craig to the village, then have the cute personal trainer soon follow. He'd be a hot twunk who'd fill the gap left by Harry, and immediately catch James' eye. Maybe Ste's too.\n\n[quote] It seems like that would be something you live and feel from very young young rather discovering later in young adulthood.\n\nR35 The teenage character who is about to come out non-binary (Brooke) is also autistic and one of the things they've highlighted over the last three of years she's been on is that she isn't always certain or aware of social cues and/or needs things that are understood by nearly everyone else explained to her. I can't tell you that this non-binary self-realization would be real-life for someone like her, but Brooke's story related to her autism has often been about \"discovery\" -- and after she met the non-binary Ripley and had what that means explained to her, they've written in some *light bulb\" moments for Brooke where she now recognizes something about herself that she relates to.\n\n[quote] I guess it's the lesbians turn for awhile .. lol!\n\nGirl Iâ€™ll be crying about Sarah Barnes in the afterlife tbh. And Iâ€™m still so furious they made Lydia a nutcase and Zoe a cheating girl bisexual bitch. We could have been so sapphically happy, but no we have to have vengeance and murder and borderline incest and violent freak accidents insteadðŸ˜­\n\nI know most of the gay fans hated Sarah for her part in the McDean storyline, but I actually rather liked her and felt sorry for her. Even her lesbian turn sort of made senseâ€”IRL Iâ€™ve known a couple of clueless lipstick femme model straight women who canâ€™t make it work with men or objectifying themselves in the patriarchal world, and suddenly a light goes on psychologically and they discover whatâ€™s been missing.\n\nR28/R30 the funny and interesting thing about Darren is that heâ€™s a rare example in soap of a very camp and swishy straight fella. The joke is that heâ€™s not gay, but he acts like the worst outdated stereotype of a gay man, i.e. incredibly bitchy and vain and always ready with a catty comment. Itâ€™s actually refreshing to see a straight man with these qualities on telly, because itâ€™s more common IRL than people assume (I was socially teased in secondary school by a straight boy with his sort of nasty streak).\n\nWhat I did like about Darren is how beneath all the banter and teasing he looked after his stepbrother Craig Dean so well, and even grew to love him. He was a better big brother to Craig than Craigâ€™s actual biological brother, the homophobic and creepy bully Jake. In fact, Iâ€™d go so far as to say that Craig & Darren are rather alike, and that had Darren been into men then he would have been Craigâ€™s mentor of sorts.\n\nPutting two guys together simply because they're the only two who've never been together (e.g. James & Ste) isn't al that different than ye olde \"two gay guys in the village\" trope.\n\nAs far as Ste is concerned I think they should look into recasting Sami's other brother, Azim, for him. .. Recall, those two were about to start something when Ste was getting out of the right-wing group, but the duo opted to put it on hold. .. Just find a hotter guy to play Azim.\n\nJames needs a new twunk in his life. .. And if they want to do a dance story, then I'd have Romeo take a weekend job as a pole dancer and have some fellow mentor-dancer (gay) catch James' eye .. lol.\n\nIf John Paul sticks around (I'm not really sure I care), then just bite the bullet and finally recast Craig. He is, after all, supposed to be Matthew's other father. He should show up at some point in time. It's been long enough.\n\nScott's typically comic-relief. Just set him up on one disaster date after another - a few times a year - until deciding what to do about his absent husband, Mitchell. A recast on that front would be hoped-for as well.\n\nOf course, I realize they probably wouldn't play seven or eight gay guys in the village all at once, so not all of this could go on concurrently, but IMO, they definitely need some NEW BLOOD on the gay front.\n\nR78 I might guess that Warren will be the one to take Fergus down. He'll learn about the pervy Bluebird project, and that will be intolerable leading to some kind of showdown. It would go toward Warren's redemption for his recent assholery, and in some way every owner in the village would get their business or home back. And yeah, I could see this tying into something at Christmas with them getting back what they lost at that time. - jmho\n\nIf the British government privatizes Channel 4, I wonder if Hollyoaks can make it?\n\nRussel T. Davies who did the award-winning \"It's A Sin\" for C4 this past year sounded pretty pissed when recently asked about the move and made it sound like there's no hope stopping this and that \"It's a done deal.\"\n\nI found something from Hollyoaks' producer, Lime Pictures, on what they submitted to the House of Lords (Communication and Digital Committee) on the subject and the future of Channel 4 if this goes through. They're really against it.\n\n(PDF file.)\n\nR117 Now that you mention that, I recall that scene. .. I remembered the actor from his stint on the Russell T. Davies, Channel 4 mini-series \"Cucumber.\" He played a supposedly straight character named \"Tomasz\" who came off somewhat bicurious. As a twink, he had a little less weight and a stronger jawline.\n\nI think Darren and Ethan should bond and get together over both of them being shackled to these women who regularly belittle them. .. They can jointly decide to 'make the switch and ditch the bitch' .. lol.\n\nI've been wondering if a drink problem is what they were going to do with JP., since every once in awhile they've shown him asking someone if they want to join him in a session, or it's mentioned that he has a hangover.\n\nOf course, it would be more interesting if he were doing this at the gay bar and throwing himself at other guys.\n\n[quote] \"This is just me making a presumption, but there was a bit of a change within the production team and the executives. I personally think that maybe they just wanted to create a bit of a new stamp. Obviously Lucy Allan has taken over as executive producer. She wanted to make her changes and things like that. I fully respect her for that because she wants to make her own mark, which is great. I have had a really good run with some really good storylines. It was probably a good time for me to leave anyway.\"\n\nSeems like the \"new stamp\" is getting rid of hot guys... lol!\n\nHereâ€™s the new opening and it doesnâ€™t make any sense. Half of these families have just had someone important to them die and they are all smiley and dancing around. I guess Luke isnâ€™t dying anytime soon, certainly not soon enough for me. It looks like they may have recast a bunch of the children. If they arenâ€™t going to do anything with Romeo beyond make him vacuous and eye candy they may as well let him go do another show where they will let him act. Is Scott homeless living under a pile of coats on a picnic table? I think Iâ€™m bottoming out about this show. Not one member of that new family looks related to any other member, itâ€™s like they hired a bunch of different actors and said youâ€™re a new Hollyoaks family, congratulations! Donâ€™t worry, it doesnâ€™t make sense for us either! I really thought we had gotten rid of Diana recently, but that was just a lie.\n\n[quote] Not one member of that new family looks related to any other member, itâ€™s like they hired a bunch of different actors and said youâ€™re a new Hollyoaks family, congratulations!\n\nBecause it's a \"yours, mine, and ours\" situation, I'm guessing the show was going for an obvious blended family look.\n\nIf you count Maxine, Dave has four kids with four different women. Maxine, Sam, Lizzie, and Mason are Dave's, but they all have different mothers.\n\nHonour brought Serena into the marriage from another relationship, and young Mason is her only child with Dave.\n\nAnd even Dave and Ethan are only half-brothers - born some 18 years apart with different mothers.\n\nDamon has landed himself in debt after his recent gambling. He tries going to Grace for some help, but this proves to be useless.\n\nLater, a drunken and grieving James approaches Damon and offers up a dangerous proposition, which could either fix his problems or make them worse.\n\nJames and Damon have made a high-stakes bet and they anxiously await the result. Another gamble soon makes things even more interesting.\n\nR162 Who knows? .. He's been my first choice to play \"NuJohnny Carter\" for quite some time. Dyer's leaving as \"Mick,\" but whether that means \"Linda\" and \"Nancy\" will be written off, who knows? .. I could easily see Parry taking over as Johnny. He's got the hotness of Johnny #1, but could also pull off being the requisite educated scholar type of Johnny #2. .. And given some of Parry's hilarious instagram postings, they could use him to add some humor to EE, perhaps in scenes with sister Nancy. .. Plus, I think Parry actually looks like he could be related to both Kellie Bright (Linda) and Maddy Hill (Nancy).\n\nInstead of Ethan humiliating Ste by having him get down on his knees and scrub floors, he should have had Ste down on his knees servicing him. He'd keep Ste in line by having video of it that he'd threaten to send to James.\n\nIt seems like they're trying to make Ethan a \"Liam Donovan-type character,\" so it would make sense if he were bisexual. That way, Ethan could be screwing around with both Sienna and Ste, literally.\n\nIf they go through with James and Ste getting married, then they might as well just kill James off, cuz I don't think they'll ever get rid of Ste.\n\nAnd what's John Paul's purported \"big story.\" A personality transplant? He's another McQueen who should buy a one-way ticket to Alicante.\n\nHopefully, the new teen-aged boys (gays) have some chemistry."
