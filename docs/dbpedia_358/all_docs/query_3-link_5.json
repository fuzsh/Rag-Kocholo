        "text": "NEETA & MAC: THE ABUSE STORYLINE\n\nAt the moment in Hollyoaks the major storyline is focusing on Mac mentally (at the moment) abusing Neeta, Just to catch you up (just incase you've been living under a rock for the last two years and don't even know who the Nightingales' are), Mac owns the Dog in the Pond and Neeta is his much younger girlfriend who is now a teaching assistant at Hollyoaks High. Since July of this year, she's been having an affair with student Hunter McQueen and Mac has found out and is now blackmailing her to stay with him. The line from Coronation Street always comes into my head, when Liz says \"if I were Rob, I think I'd prefer prison\". Anyway, this is my opinion on the whole storyline.\n\nNo. She doens't deserve it. Yes. She made a mistake but how many of us haven't made a mistake or fallen in love with the front person! It's basically stay with an abusive, manipulative man or risk going to prison. He is removing her slowly from all her friends, by making her quit teaching so that she doesn't see Hunter (even though they will see each other around the village) or Sally and he'll probably stop her seeing Nancy and Maxine in the near future. This is a repetition of both Patrick and Maxine and Jake and Becca as both males in the relationships controlled who Maxine and Becca could speak to and hang out with.\n\nYou can't make yourself fall in love, just as you can't choose who you fall in love\n\nHunter & Neeta\n\nI feel like with Justin & Becca it was more for just sex whereas I love just seeing Neeta and Hunter having regular conversations like them being interested in each other's interests and their shared love of art. I feel like they defiantly have more in common than Becca and Justin did (and to be honest Patrick and Maxine).\n\nI have seen a lot of comments saying \"why are they repeating storylines since they did this a couple of years ago with Maxine and Patrick\". Firstly this is like a combination of Patrick and Maxine's abuse storyline and the Becca and Justin teacher/student storyline. But Hollyoaks need to repeat to repeat storylines since it's so important to raise awareness! Abuse can happen to anyone but Hollyoaks have shown in twice when the case has been two strong independent women being brought down by their older partner and what makes this Neeta and Mac storyline even sadder is because we know that Neeta was in a previous abuse storyline so I just wish Hollyoaks would give her a little bit of happiness!\n\nIf you've been affected by anything raised in Hollyoaks click the link here\n\nInstagram credit:- @holllyoaksscenes\n\nThe Actors\n\nI did want to praise the actors and say what an amazing job they're doing! When watching this storyline, I feel sick and I want to rip my hair out with frustration and cry for Neeta, this shows what a great job Amrit and David are doing at portraying this storyline! I am sat in fear for what Mac is going to do to Neeta and at the end of each scene that he doesn't hit her, I breathe a sigh of relief and it's double at the end of the episode if he hasn't hurt her! I wonder how long it will be before this storyline stretches from mental abuse out to physical abuse because we all know that is coming! I know that as this storyline continues the acting is just going to be getting better and better but every time I see Neeta with Mac it breaks my heart a little bit more because I just remember that little bit of time when she was free of Mac and was friends with Maxine, Nancy, Grace, Sally and even James. I am looking forward to the time when, as I said above, the squad to team up against Mac even though we will most likely have some horrible scenes to watch first! However bravo to Hollyoaks for covering the important topic!\n\nWhere could it be going next?\n\nThis Mac/Neeta abuse storyline is most likely going to be leading back into James' abuse storyline. We did see a little bit last year of James opening up to John Paul about Mac abusing him as a child and we know that Marnie, John Paul and Mercedes all know about it but nobody else does. I feel like this will eventually get the squad - Sally, Neeta, Hunter and James - to team up and take Mac down.\n\nThis storyline is such an important subject to cover because it does bring awareness and it is also splitting people's opinions because they might not like Hunter and Neeta together but they hate what Mac is doing so much more. Similar to James really, this might have hated him for what he did / what he was going to do to Ste but they hate Mac 1000 times more!\n\nSami Maalik\n\nGoodbye Neeta Kaur\n\nSo about a month ago when I saw Amrit doing a photoshoot, I was like yes we are getting new titles and now I am writing this. I still can't believe that Neeta has died and Amrit has left Hollyoaks. Okay, so I have cried A LOT at Hollyoaks deaths; Joe Roscoe's death the first time around, Jim McGinn, Becca Dean, Carmel McQueen, Lindsey Roscoe, Joe Roscoe the second and proper time around, Nathan Nightingale, Jade Albright, Rachel Hardy, the list goes on but I truly believe this is the first Hollyoaks death that has made me actually seething. Fuming. You see because all of the characters above had a pretty happy life, yes there were a few downs but they had a lot of happy times however, out of the two years that Neeta had been in Hollyoaks, I don't remember a particularly large amounts of happy times. She had the friendship with Maxine, Grace and Nancy which Hollyoaks quickly forgot about (which I'm literally fuming about because I bet you Grace and Nancy won't get told about Neeta's death) and then she had the friendship with Sally which Oaks decided to ruin. I really invested myself in Neeta because I really wanted her to get a break. I remember when I first properly started watching Hollyoaks again and I didn't like Neeta that much but when she wasn't with Mac I did really love her. She became herself and I really did adore her. I just really wanted Neeta to catch a break and have a bit of happiness since it sounds like she didn't even have a bit of happiness before she met Mac, with what has been said with her having an abusive ex."
