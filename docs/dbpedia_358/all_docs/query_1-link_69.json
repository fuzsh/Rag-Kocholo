        "text": "The UK release date for another spin-off from The Walking Dead franchise has finally been announced - and it's soon than you think. The Walking Dead: Dead City stars Maggie and Negan who travel into a post-apocalyptic Manhattan cut off from the mainland in search of Maggie's kidnapped son, Hershel.\n\nThe series, which stars Lauren Cohan and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, first broadcast in the US on AMC on June 18, 2023 and has been absent from UK screens since then. Many Walking Dead fans in the UK have been calling for a UK release either on TV, streaming or a physical release.\n\nBut the next instalment of Maggie and Negan's story will finally air on UK TV later this month. Sky has announced The Walking Dead: Dead City will air on Sky Max on Thursday, August 22 at 9pm.\n\nA plot synopsis reads: \"Years have passed since we last saw Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Negan, (Jeffery Dean Morgan) and the old enemies must now form a tenuous alliance in order to carry out a dangerous mission.\n\n\"Maggie and Negan travel into a post-apocalyptic Manhattan long ago cut off from the mainland, where they discover that the crumbling city is filled with the dead and denizens who have made New York City their own world full of anarchy, danger, beauty, and terror.\n\n\"But as the pair moves deeper into the gritty depths of the walker-infested city, it becomes apparent that the traumas of their tumultuous past may prove just as great a threat as the dangers of the present.\"\n\nThe series also stars Orange Is The New Black's Dascha Polanco, Animal Kingdom actor Jake Weary, It Follows star Keir Gilchrist, and Terrifier star Pooya Mohseni.\n\nDead City has also been renewed for a second season and will likely air in 2025.\n\nThe news comes as the first season of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon airs for the first time on Sky and all of its episodes are available to stream on Now TV. The deal forms part of Sky and Now TV's deal to show a number of series in The Walking Dead franchise on its platforms."
