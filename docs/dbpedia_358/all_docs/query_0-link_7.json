        "text": "Hollyoaks actor Kavin Sacre has quit the Channel 4 soap after almost six years.\n\nSacre, who is the oldest member of Hollyoaks' young cast, promised himself he'd leave the show when he hit the age of 30.\n\nNow he plans to pursue other projects and interests which he enjoyed prior to his stint in the Chester-based soap.\n\nSpeaking of his decision to quit, the actor said: \"I have been here since I was 24 and I turned 30 in March. I decided that once I turned 30 I'd go and explore other avenues. We have a lot of good actors on the show and it's good to see them go on to do great things because people are always saying that Hollyoaks actors are rubbish, which is so unfair and untrue.\n\n\"I'd love to go and do something and people say 'oh look there's Kev, he's doing well and he's one of our lot.\"\n\nProducer Bryan Kirkwood added: \"Kevin has been one of the most recognisable faces of Hollyoaks for many years and I’m sorry to see him go. He has an amazing presence, both on and off screen, and I’m sure the future is bright for him.”\n\nA Hollyoaks source told DS: \"Jake's mental health issues will play a big part in his downfall, which ties in with one of the soap's big ongoing storylines involving Warren and Louise.\n\n\"It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to realise who he's accused of killing, but there are twists along the way culminate in Jake's exit from the soap - and one of them includes a wallet which is found in his belongings...\"\n\nSacre filmed his final scenes at Lime Pictures, home of Hollyoaks, last week and will remain on screen until May.\n\nSince joining the soap in 2002, his character has featured prominently in iconic storylines including his ill-fated relationship with Becca Dean (Ali Bastian), baby Charlie's leukemia and Jake's marriage and domestic abuse towards Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox)."
