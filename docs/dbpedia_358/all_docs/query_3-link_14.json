        "text": "Lisa Hunter was played by Gemma Atkinson and first appeared in Hollyoaks in 2001. Her parents were Les and Sally and she had one older sister, Ellie and two brothers, Dan, who was older and Lee the youngest of the family. Her father is very over protective, but this is due to the fact that her sister Ellie, has been missing for two years in Ibiza. Their mother Sally, spends lots of time abroad looking for her which leaves Lisa as the woman of the house with a strict and drunk father, Les. Les doesn’t treat the boys in the same way as he treats her and this is a heavy burden for her, especially as she is much more responsible than both of her brothers. Lisa often feels left out because of the family spending so much time looking for Ellie, worrying about Dan’s diabetes or bailing Lee out of the situations he finds himself in. When Ellie finally returns, the family erupts in arguments making her leave again so Lisa is once more alone.\n\nLisa attended Hollyoaks Comprehensive in Chester before studying at Hollyoaks Community Collage where she studied Media and Psychology.\n\nLisa’s relationships include a difficult relationship with Brian Drake before she started dating Cameron Clark. Soon though she set her sights on older men, trying to pursue Kristian Hargreaves. However that ended in disaster! Lisa then had an affair with Jake Dean while he was still dating Becca, before having a real relationship with Ben Davies.\n\nLisa’s main and what most people would say was her best storyline and also one of Hollyoaks best, was her self-harming one. At school Lisa was shy yet intelligent but was bullied by Steph Dean because she was jealous of her for basically being popular. As well as numerous family problems Lisa turns to self-harming. She manages to keep this a secret from everyone until Brian finds the cuts on her arms and legs and assumes she is being abused so he calls the social worker which makes Lisa admit to the self-harming. Lee soon catches her cutting herself and tells her family. She starts seeing a counselor which doesn’t last for long because when Les finds out about the self-harming he goes into a rage and prohibits her from returning, which adds to the mess her head is already in. She starts a relationship Brian which doesn’t work as she struggles with her family’s problems and relies on him too much and it ends when Lisa finds out that Brian kissed his former girlfriend Zara. Sadly Lisa found this too hard to cope with and cuts herself so deeply that she ends up in hospital. Steph then uses this to her advantage and spreads rumours round the school that Lisa tried to kill herself, but in the end everyone finds out that wasn’t the case and picks sides with Lisa leaving Steph being shown as the bully that she was.\n\nCameron Clark arrives in the village and really takes a shine to Lisa and after a while the pair start dating. Lisa starts receiving threatening message from a mystery stalker. Everyone seems to assume that it’s Steph due to her bullying and the relationship she now has with Cameron, but in the end they find out it is her jealous ex, Brian.\n\nLisa loses her virginity to Cameron but they break-up. She dates Kristian Hargreaves for a while, but it doesn’t last.\n\nSadly her brother Dan dies in a motor sport accident which manages to turn Lisa’s life around and she then decides to live life to the fullest which includes her going off the rails a bit. She starts having an affair with Dan’s good friend Jake with whom she contracts a STD. Lisa loves Jake and wants to be with him, but Jake tells her it has to stop because he loves Becca. He then tells Becca about the affair and ends things with Lisa.\n\nShe soon turns her affections to Ben, and manages to steal him away from his then girlfriend, Louise Summers. The pair decide to leave the village together.\n\nLisa Hunter also appeared in three Hollyoaks spin offs called “Hollyoaks After Hours”, “Hollyoaks Let Loose” and “Hollyoaks In The City”.\n\nIn Hollyoaks After Hours, Lisa goes away with a man she met at a hotel to Paris.\n\nIn Hollyoaks Let Loose you see Ben and Lisa in their new life together, but not everything is roses when Ben cheats and Lisa begins to self harm again. She then decides to move away, but in the end Ben manages to convince her to stay and give them another go.\n\nIn Hollyoaks In The City Lisa is working as a receptionist and a model and is still with Ben who buys a bar. Again their relationship struggles but this time they both cheat. The ending for this series is when Lisa is kidnapped and whilst trying to escape she accidentally shoots Ben, supposedly killing him.\n\nCurrent Mood: pleased"
