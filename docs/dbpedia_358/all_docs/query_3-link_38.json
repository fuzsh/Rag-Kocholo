        "text": "Hollyoaks spoilers follow.\n\nSince Vicky Grant's collapse earlier this month teens Charlie and Leah have been hiding the truth about what really happened â€“ that they were the ones responsible for putting Vicky in hospital.\n\nDuring a camping trip, Charlie and Leah had planned to share an ecstasy pill, but after they dropped it in a cup, Vicky drunk the spiked drink by mistake.\n\nSo far, they've managed to keep their secret under wraps, but that's about to change after Vicky's former foster dad Scott becomes suspicious.\n\nRelated: Hollyoaks star Vera Chok teases possible split for Honour and Dave\n\nAfter reading a story about a county lines gang, Scott tells Maxine he suspects Charlie had something to do with Vicky's drug overdose.\n\nCharlie, meanwhile, is busy trying to hide his cannabis smoking from Nancy. Things later go from bad to worse for him when he is confronted by Scott. While a paranoid Charlie is desperate to come clean, Leah refuses to own up.\n\nLater on, Charlie and Leah are taken in for questioning by Zoe and Sam after the police receive a tip-off.\n\nRelated: Former Hollyoaks star Jazmine Franks is expecting first baby with partner Danny Potter\n\nElsewhere, Darren and James clash over Charlie and Leah's involvement in the drug spiking, which results in them taking drastic measures. And later all the parents are involved in a game of finger pointing.\n\nAs things get heated, Scott breaks up the arguments and reveals he was the one who tipped off the police after he overheard a conversation between Charlie and Leah.\n\nNancy and Darren then make things even worse for Charlie when they accidentally reveal his whole story.\n\nThings aren't easy for Leah either. At school, DeMarcus is understandably annoyed after discovering the truth about Vicky's overdose. But a slip of the tongue from Leah leaves him devastated. What does Leah say? And can she repair the damage?\n\nHollyoaks streams first on All 4, with new episodes dropping each weekday morning. The show airs Mondays to Fridays at 6.30pm on Channel 4, and at 7pm on E4.\n\nSelected omnibus episodes are available via Prime Video.\n\nRead more Hollyoaks spoilers on our dedicated homepage\n\nFor more on drug use and addiction, including information and support, please visit FRANK or Action on Addiction.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
