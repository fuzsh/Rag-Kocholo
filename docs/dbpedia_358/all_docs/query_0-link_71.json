        "text": "Hello and welcome to another edition of A Slice Of Soap. There’s still time to enter this week’s caption competition so get scribbling and make us all laugh.\n\nWell it’s finally happened…new Hollyoaks boss, Paul Marquess, has wielded the axe yet again, culling another 11 cast members of the Chester based soap. Wanna know who’s for the chop? Well, It’s been reported that the entire Valentine family, consisting of father Leo (Brian Bovell), Sasha (Nathalie Emmanuelle) and Lauren (Dominique Jackson) will all be leaving the soap when the storyline surrounding the upcoming death of Calvin, played by Ricky Whittle, ends in May.\n\nAs well as the Valentine family, Paul Marquess won’t be extending Kent Riley’s contract either, even though he’s played student Zak Ramsay for the past six years. Kevin Sacre and Melissa Walton are also for the chop, when the current storyline between Jake Dean and his love interest Loretta Jones comes to an end.\n\nThe Hollyoaks character Spencer Gray played by Darren Langford is also due to leave the show when his current contract runs out over the next few months. Troubled teenage ‘Newt’ played by Nico Mirallegro, will also be leaving Hollyoaks, alongside new characters Dave Colburn played by Elliot James Langridge and teacher Des Townsend played by Kris Deedigan.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerard McCarthy, who plays DJ Kris Fisher, is believed to have told bosses he wants to leave Hollyoaks to appear in the West End version of ‘Flashdance The Musical’.\n\nSo, in addition to the Ashworth family, the current departure total stands at 16, but something tells me that it won’t be long before the mad-axeman-of-Chester, Paul Marquess, strikes again. I just feel sorry for the remaining few cast members left on the set of Hollyoaks. I bet when they go to sleep at night, they wake up in cold sweats, screaming, due to recurring images of a psychologically deranged producer sticking his head out of the broken door pane of the Job Centre Plus building (cos he almost makes Jack Nicholson’s character out of The Shining seem normal).\n\nAnyway, we’ll have more news on the continuing cull of the cast of Hollyoaks as and when it happens…but to end on a more positive note, congratulations are in order for the cast of EastEnders who were named ‘TV Soap Of The Year’ at the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Awards for the third consecutive year running…(at least their jobs are safe!).\n\nThat’s it for me, I’m out of here. Join me on Friday for the result of this week’s caption competition. Got a comment about your favourite soap, this blog or anything else? Share it with me.\n\nOfficial Sites\n\nCoronation Street\n\nEmmerdale\n\nEastEnders\n\nHollyoaks\n\nMs Bubbles\n\nMSN’s Eye On Soaps\n\nShare It"
