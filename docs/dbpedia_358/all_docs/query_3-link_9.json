        "text": "Latest Chris F news!\n\nTHERE'S going to be some mischief under the mistletoe at Hollyoaks this Christmas.\n\nTeacher Becca Dean finds herself in a steamy seasonal clinch with student Justin Burton.\n\nChris Fountain, who plays wayward GCSE student Justin, says: \"The fans are aware in the current build-up with the student-teacher relationship that it's all heading to some sort of crescendo - let's just say this will be one very strong and powerful storyline that will have people gripped not just for now but in the months ahead.\n\n\"I hope fans will be satisfied with the outcome.\"\n\nAnd Chris should know about soap suspense having played a cannabis-smoking, at times moody, and aggressive character involved in some very unusual and sensational soap stories since he arrived in 2003.\n\nHe's had a court case for murder; thrown his sister out of a window and is now having a dangerous liaison down at Hollyoaks Comprehensive.\n\nWill he ever learn?\n\nThere's been all manner of soapy skulduggery and he's loving it.\n\nBut Chris is NOT like his alter ego - apart,, he smiles, from the cheeky element.\n\n\"I am bit more cool-headed,\" says the 18-year-old actor who plays in goal for the Hollyoaks charity team and supports Huddersfield Town.\n\n\"I'm a bit more laid-back and not so off-the-handle.\"\n\nChris says he is looking forward to this Christmas knowing he already has a perfect gift.\n\n\"I bought myself an X Box 360.\n\n\"And I've signed for\n\nHollyoaks for another year,\" adds the Bradford-born actor.\n\n\"I like living and working in Liverpool and the night life is very good. It's a great city to socialise in.\"\n\nHis main concern at the moment is knowing what to buy his girlfriend, Katie, for Christmas.\n\n\"I am enjoying myself here in the city. As for the next move I don't even think about it. I take the rough with the smooth and so far it's been smooth. I do want to do films, though.\"\n\nHe is already a veteran at 18 having been in stage shows such as Les Miserables and Oliver! where he played The Artful Dodger. He has also been in many top telly shows including Where the Heart Is and The Royal.\n\n\"I have been acting in some form since I was 10 years of age. I am philosophical about the job.\n\n\"I remember when I went for the audition for Hollyoaks. I'd just come back from a holiday in Mexico and was so surprised when they asked me back. I thought I had made a mess of it. \"It's been a great year playing someone quite nasty - they are much better people to play.\n\n\"I love creating a persona like that.\n\n\"If the storylines keep coming like they have done, I\n\nwill be more than happy. I get a lot of positive feedback.\"\n\nBefore Christmas, Windsor-born actress Ali Bastian, who plays beautiful Hollyoaks comprehensive teacher Becca Dean, was suffering from a cold.\n\nIronically, she had just filmed the hot scenes for this week's exciting editions, but was keeping tight-lipped about what happens between impressionable Justin and Becca whose life has been a trail of broken promises, ill fated-affairs and a mis-marriage.\n\nShe says: \"I am like most soap fans; I don't want to give away what's going to happen because you ruin it for so many people.\n\n\"They stay with it and are watching it and seeing a particular story progress throughout the year.\n\n\"But it does come to a head this week and the repercussions will go on into 2006 - you can be sure of that.. \"Becca is so undecided in life and she's care-less.\n\n\"Not everyone is feeling festive and not everyone knows what will happen in the days ahead from Christmas to New Year's Eve. Her husband Jake is not sure what is going on.\"\n\nAli is going home to Berkshire for Christmas and, like acting pal Chris, she will be missing the Liverpool social\n\nscene. The actress who has appeared in TV's Jane Eyre and in A Touch of Frost says she is soaking up every professional minute of her Hollyoaks career.\n\nAt 23, she is one of the hottest Hollyoaks stars in years.\n\nShe is also going to be gift-wrapped this Christmas by thousands of admirers - because she is one of the Hollyoaks babes - the sexy stars who appear in the best-selling calendars.\n\nHer own ideal Christmas present would be a Ferrari but, realistically, a puppy. But for now she's too busy with schedules to give the latter her full attention.\n\nThe calendar, however, is something she is clearly pleased about.\n\n\"I am December,\" she laughs.. \"It sounds odd talking about NEXT December already. This has been my happiest and busiest year to date.\"\n\nAs for Hollyoaks, she says that the storylines reflect life and what you see in the news and in the papers.\n\nAli herself would one day like to appear in a medical drama, but at the moment she wouldn't swap teacher Becca for any other character.\n\n\"Like Chris with his character Justin, we wait to see what THEY have written for us. \"We don't know where's it's all going.\n\n\"Becca has a lot of baggage - a real habit of changing her mind,\" she hints..\n\nIt looks like fans will need to prepare for this dangerous liaison with a difference this week when Hollyoaks gets hotter and the days after the nights before bring up some heated and complex exchanges . . . but for whom? It's a Christmas gift of a storyline to any actor and for any viewer, too. But will Becca and Justin learn their lessons?\n\n0"
