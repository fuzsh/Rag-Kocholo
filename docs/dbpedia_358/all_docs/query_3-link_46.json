        "text": "Ali Bastian is an actress who starred in Hollyoaks and grew up in Windsor, but what is she doing now?\n\nFollowing her time on Hollyoaks, the TV star settled down in London with her husband and welcomed a child in 2020 called Isla.\n\nThe mother-of-one now spends a lot of her time looking after her toddler and posting what she gets up to on social media.\n\nREAD MORE: Darius Danesh now - from cringe Britney Spears audition and Pop Idol, to near-fatal coma and West End stardom\n\nAli is most well-known for her role in Hollyoaks and The Bill. In Hollyoaks, she played Becca Dean and in The Bill she played PC Sally Armstrong.\n\nFollowing these shows, she went on to have roles in Jonathan Creek, Death in Paradise, Holby City, and Doctors. The actress has had a stint on live TV when she starred in Strictly Come Dancing in 2009, soon after she left Hollyoaks.\n\nWho is Ali Bastian's husband?\n\nThe 39-year-old married David O'Mahony in 2019, who is also an actor.\n\nHe's starred in the West End show the Bodyguard and he also had a role in Midsomer Murders and Waking the Dead.\n\nBefore the couple had their toddler Isla, Ali had a heartbreaking miscarriage but was later delighted to give birth in 2020.\n\nDuring Ali's time on Hollyoaks, her character became embroiled in a storyline that many found shocking, to say the least, when Becca became involved in a relationship with one of her students.\n\nAli's controversial storyline in Hollyoaks\n\nWhen Becca first arrived in Hollyoaks in 2001 she was an undergraduate. But it wasn't long before she was involved in quite a few dramatic storylines, including when she had an abortion after falling pregnant with her boyfriend Jamie's baby.\n\nThe couple had previously broken up as he had cheated on her but they shortly got back together and Becca found out she was pregnant right around the time Jamie was killed in a minibus accident.\n\nShe also had a relationship with Jake who cheated on her with another character, resulting in him passing on an STD.\n\nThey eventually got married. At the time, Becca was visiting a school student of her's who was in prison, who was later released.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2005 she went to his house and they kissed. Following this, she had a relationship with Justin and as a result lost her job as a teacher.\n\nWhen Becca broke up with Justin he went to the police and in his anger said that she was a sexual predator and groomed him.\n\nBecca received two years' imprisonment and went into labour with Justin's baby as the verdict was announced."
