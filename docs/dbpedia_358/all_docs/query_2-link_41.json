        "text": "Jake Dean Taylor is an LGBTQ actor, model, writer and comedian. He developed his passion for the entertainment industry at the early age of 5. He carried this passion through every step of his journey, vowing to help usher in a new age of inclusivity and visibility for the LGBTQ community. His written work is exclusively queer and he's a vocal advocate for the community.\n\nJake was born in Maine, but moved all over the U.S. due to his father's work. They ended up settling down in Indiana. He grew up very close to his siblings, and for a majority of his youth, had a great responsibility to take care of them; most significantly his older brother, who was bound to a wheelchair. It was only when Jake turned 18, that he was able to take command of his life and seriously pursue his passions. He decided to move out of Indiana to work for Disney World, where his adventures would only begin.\n\nAfter Disney, Jake moved to Miami Beach, where he landed a few commercials through The Green Agency. After his short stint in Miami, Jake decided to move to NYC, where he would be signed with Images Model Management, and eventually work with Abrams. While in NYC, Jake also pursued improv and sketch comedy writing at The PIT, a local theater, where he would develop and cultivate his passion for comedy. From there, Jake was able to book a short film (Jessica's Playhouse), two webseries (Gays: The Series, Randee so Dandee), and collaborate on writing ventures. After a successful 6 years, Jake decided it was time to venture off to Los Angles.\n\nJake is a current resident of Los Angeles, where he's pursuing his career endeavors. He enjoys collaborating with his writing partner, hikes, the beach, any food he can get his hands on, exercise and taking care of his puppy, Chuleta."
