        "text": "Hollyoaks star Jon-Paul Bell has addressed his exit as Beau Ramsey, describing his time on the soap as a \"pleasure\".\n\nThe actor, who joined the Channel 4 soap in 2022, made his final appearance as Beau in Friday's (August 2) episode as the character was jailed for his murder of Declan Hawthorne, which he had spent weeks covering up alongside Kitty Draper.\n\nFollowing Beau's exit, Bell took to Instagram to send a heartfelt message to fans, producers and co-stars, with fellow actors Nick Pickard and Alex Fletcher, who play Tony and Diane Hutchinson, being singled out for particular praise.\n\nRelated: Hollyoaks teases new blackmail drama for Dillon and Tom\n\n\"It's been a pleasure @hollyoaksofficial ... Thank you to my on screen family @nickpickardofficial, @alexfletcher00 and the rest of the brilliant cast & crew for making my time here so special\", he wrote, with the post containing a collection of behind-the-scenes photos and clips from his time on the soap.\n\nFletcher responded to the post with a similarly sweet message, commenting: \"What an absolute ðŸ’Ž you truly are a gent x what a legend xxx\", with Matthew McGivern - who played Sam Chen-Williams - writing: â€œSmashed it mate\".\n\nThe post was received warmly by several other Hollyoaks stars, with Matthew James-Bailey - who plays Ethan Williams - calling the actor a \"genuine legend\" whilst Nancy Osborne star Jessica Fox wrote: \"Absolutely gorgeous human and always such a pleasure\".\n\n\"Miss you already @jonpaul_bell ... Thank you for being a fantastic role model to the younger generation on set. Good Luck & keep smiling,\" added Lacey Findlow, who plays Dee Dee Hutchinson.\n\nRelated: Best streaming services UK 2024\n\nIsabelle Smith, who joined the soap earlier this year as Frankie Osborne, wrote: \"all the love\", whilst Owen Warner, who recently left his role as Romeo Nightingale, added: \"Beautiful man\".\n\nBell's departure comes amidst several changes for the Channel 4 soap, which announced earlier this year that staff cuts and cast exits would be necessitated by the move from five to three episodes per week from September.\n\nThe change in the number of weekly episodes will be accompanied by a major autumn stunt, closely followed by a one year time jump.\n\nHollyoaks streams first online via Channel 4 each weekday at 7.30pm. Episodes then air on E4 the following day, before getting their YouTube premiere a week after that.\n\nSelected omnibus episodes are available via Prime Video.\n\nRead more Hollyoaks spoilers on our dedicated homepage\n\nYou Might Also Like"
