L. (Jason Lochinvar) \"Fatman\" McCabe and Joe Penny as investigator Jake Styles.[1][2][3] Created by Dean Hargrove, Joel Steiger and Ann Doherty, the series ran on CBS for five seasons from September 26, 1987, to May 6, 1992. Diagnosis: Murder was a spin-off of this series.[4][5]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nJ. L. \"Fatman\" McCabe is a Hawaii-born, tough former Honolulu Police Department officer turned Los Angeles district attorney. He is teamed with a handsome, happy-go-lucky special investigator named Jake Styles. They often clash due to their different styles and personalities. \"Fatman\" travels hardly anywhere without Max, his pet bulldog. The show was set in Los Angeles during the first season. After the end of Magnum, P.I., the show was moved to Hawaii. The second and third seasons and half of the fourth season were filmed in Honolulu. The show then returned to Los Angeles for the remainder of its run.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMain cast\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliam Conrad as District Attorney J.

Executive producers Fred Silverman and Dean Hargrove decided to use this character as a model for one of the main characters in a new show they were creating for CBS. Penny also guest starred in these episodes, but his character was not on the same side as Conrad's character in the storyline's legal case.\n\nFollowing the departure of Hargrove, executive producers David Moessinger and Jeri Taylor were brought on to run the series with Silverman. They also hired J. Michael Straczynski as an executive story consultant.[6] Taylor and Moessinger ran the show for two years before finally leaving in a dispute over control over the show.[6]\n\nStraczynski has written that he was hired after pitching a story that let Conrad sit down for almost every scene,[6] noting his own faux slogan for the show \"Jake and the Fatman: He can't act, he can't walk, together they fight crime\".[6]\n\nControversy\n\n[edit]\n\nJoe Penny lost a large amount of weight after the show moved to Hawaii, which led to many rumors about his health, including the possibility that he had AIDS. In actuality, he had suffered from a gastrointestinal virus and was having difficulty regaining the weight he lost. When the show moved back to Los Angeles, it was also suspected that it was on Penny's urging. This was also not true, as the move was CBS's decision.[7]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nCBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released the first two seasons of Jake and the Fatman on DVD in Region 1 between 2008/2009. As of June 2015, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print.\n\nVisual Entertainment released Jake and the Fatman - The Complete Collection on June 23, 2017.[8][9]\n\nDVD Name Ep # Region 1 Season One, Volume One 11 July 8, 2008[10] Season One, Volume Two 12 December 2, 2008[11] Season Two 11 May 5, 2009[12] Season Three 26 N/A Season Four 24 N/A Season Five 22 N/A The Complete Series 106 June 23, 2017[9]\n\nSpin-offs\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Diagnosis: Murder\n\nThe nineteenth episode of the fourth season of Jake and the Fatman, \"It Never Entered My Mind\", featured Dick Van Dyke as Dr. Mark Sloan, a medical doctor who solves crimes. The success of that episode led initially to a series of three TV movies, and then a weekly television series Diagnosis: Murder that debuted on CBS on October 29, 1993.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
