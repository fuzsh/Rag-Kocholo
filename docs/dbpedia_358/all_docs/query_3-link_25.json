        "text": "Hollyoaks spoilers follow for the latest episode on Channel 4 streaming, which will air on E4 tomorrow.\n\nHollyoaks' Joel Dexter has betrayed Leela Lomax ahead of their wedding in tonight's (May 22) newest streaming episode.\n\nLately, Leela has felt like Joel has been torn between her and his ex Cleo McQueen, who recently returned to the village and is in a relationship with Joel's sinister brother Abe Fielding. Joel said he was committed to her, and recently said that they should get married right away and in secret.\n\nIn Wednesday's episode, the couple tried to get people to come under the guise of it being a lunch, with the plan to surprise them with their wedding.\n\nRelated: Hollyoaks reveals details about Coronation Street starâ€™s first scenes\n\nJoel met up with Liberty Savage to discuss a surprise song for the wedding, but after he left, mum Marie managed to learn about the big day from her.\n\nSoon enough, a heated argument kicked off between Marie and Leela, with Leela dishing out a slap before kicking Marie out of the house.\n\nThings calmed down when Leela found herself having an unlikely heart-to-heart with Cleo, who said that they were \"meant to be\", while Marie threw a mini stag do at the pub with Joel and Abe.\n\nRelated: EastEnders star Jonny Labey spotted on Hollyoaks set\n\nJust before the episode ended, an extremely drunk Joel bumped into Cleo and he admitted that while he loves Leela, she wasn't Cleo... before going in for a kiss.\n\nWhile she pulled away pretty quickly, she looked conflicted. Will she keep it a secret, or try and pursue things with her ex?\n\nMeanwhile, the soap has confirmed that it has joined forces with the Home Office for Cleo and Abe's continuing storyline, as it's set to get darker.\n\nHollyoaks streams first online via Channel 4 each weekday at 7.30pm. Episodes then air on E4 the following day, before getting their YouTube premiere a week after that.\n\nSelected omnibus episodes are available via Prime Video.\n\nRead more Hollyoaks spoilers on our dedicated homepage\n\nYou Might Also Like"
