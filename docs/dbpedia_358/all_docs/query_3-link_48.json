        "text": "Soap fans were left gutted last week when news broke that actor Jake Wood had quit his role as Max Branning on BBC soap EastEnders, following an amazing 15 years!\n\nJake, who first joined the cast back in 2006, has now taken to his social media pages for the first time since the news broke, telling his fans to 'watch this space'.\n\nSharing a topless selfie looking extremely ripped, Jake told his fans, 'After 15 years I will be leaving Eastenders at the end of this year. I have loved playing Max Branning who amongst other things in that time has had 4 marriages, 10 affairs, 4 children (2 dying from falling from the roof of The Queen Vic), been buried alive, watched unwanted DVDs at Xmas and perhaps most traumatising of all...shared a hot tub with Ian Beale.\n\n'I have made some truly great friends whilst on the show and I‚Äôll miss everyone there. I‚Äôm grateful they have left the door open for Max and I‚Äôm excited to see what new horizons are around the corner. Thank you to everyone who has sent me messages this week, I appreciate the love and support üëçüèº‚ù§Ô∏è'. (sic)\n\nSpeaking of Jake's exit last week, EastEnders' executive producer, Jon Sen, added, \"Jake is a truly wonderful actor and EastEnders have been extremely lucky to have him for so long.\n\n\"We have a big storyline for Max that starts in the coming weeks and we are all very excited to see that play out.\"\n\nCheck out all of these original cast photos from your favourite soap stars:\n\nAlthough EastEnders bosses haven't officially confirmed when Jake will be departing from Albert Square, rumours are rife that his exit story line is going to be huge.\n\nJake first joined the cast back in June 2005, before taking breaks in both 2011 and 2015."
