        "text": "AN 18-MONTH-OLD baby from Irlam has landed a starring role in Channel 4 soap, Hollyoaks.\n\nOliver Cassidy has been cast as an extra for troubled on-screen character Charlie Dean in the hit programme.\n\nNot only has he been the subject of a fierce custody battle, he has also been kidnapped and found in the arms of a man attempting suicide.\n\nBut baby Oliver needs some rest after a hard day‘s work, so on-screen character Charlie has been played by other youngsters also acting as extras.\n\nWhile Charlie‘s mum, Becca, played by Ali Bastian died after a battle with leukaemia, her on-screen ex-husband Jake Dean, played by Kevin Sacre, is battling for custody with Charlie‘s natural father, Justin Burton.\n\nJake, who recently married Becca's younger sister Nancy Hayton who left him, is driven to desperation and he is found in the middle of a wood, pumping exhaust fumes into his car while clutching the baby.\n\nIn the slightly calmer environment of their Silverdale Avenue home, Oliver‘s real life mum, Kelly, said: \"We entered Oliver into a modelling and extra‘s agency based in Swinton - he only went on the books last year, this is his first job.\n\n\"He’s been to the studios in Childwall in Liverpool about six times and his role involves being carried around by the actor who plays Jake.\"\n\nKelly, 30, who works as a travel agent, said she would be happy for her two sons to enter the acting industry later in life.\n\nShe said: \"It’s good for his CV and we‘ve not seen his first wage yet but when we do, it will be good to get a bit of money behind him.\"\n\nKelly added that family and friends gathered to watch Oliver’s latest starring role which was broadcast on E4 on Tuesday, May 13."
