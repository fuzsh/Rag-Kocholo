        "text": "He's the King of reality TV, but it looks like Dancing On Ice winner Jake Quickenden could be about to leave the world of reality behind for a role in popular Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks.\n\nAfter winning the ITV ice skating show last month, Jake has been a busy boy and has 'met with bosses at Hollyoaks for potential role'.\n\nAccording to new reports, bosses at Hollyoaks actually approached the singer a few years ago, but no suitable roles were available at the time. Although nothing has been confirmed, it's being reported that Jake is very keen on the idea of joining the cast of a soap.\n\nJake, who is currently on the Dancing On Ice tour, first shot to fame when he appeared on The X Factor in both 2012 and 2014. Despite initially impressing the judges, Jake was sent home at the Judges' Houses stage of the competition in both series.\n\nHis popularity then grew further when he appeared on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2014, striking up an unlikely friendship with motorcycle racer Carl Fogarty. After leaving the jungle in second place, Jake met Foggy's daughter Danielle and they've since been in a relationship.\n\nThe happy couple often post loved up photos together on their social media accounts.\n\nWhen it was announced in late 2017 that Jake would be a contestant on Dancing On Ice, the 29-year-old quickly became an early favourite to win the show.\n\nAfter performing amazing routines every week, Jake beat the likes of Love Island's Kem Cetinay, rugby ace Max Evans and Coronation Street actress Brooke Vincent to be crowned the winner of the 2018 series.\n\nJake and his skating partner Vanessa Bauer performed Torvill and Dean's infamous Bolero in the final, leaving viewers at home stunned.\n\nWatch the performance below:\n\nIf the new reports about Hollyoaks are true, we could be seeing a lot more of Jake on our TV screens!\n\nNow see which soap stars fell in love on set:"
