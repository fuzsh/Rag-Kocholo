        "text": "Episode 1 – 23rd October 1995\n\nOn 23rd October 1995, 2.9 million homes tuned in to watch the eagerly anticipated arrival of Hollyoaks, the new teen soap drama on Channel 4. The show opened with a series of scenes that encapsulated the lives of the seven youngsters in Chester. Viewers were captivated as they watched four teenagers scramble out of a car before it exploded in to a ball of flames – a sign of the action, drama and spectacles that would follow in the next two decades. As the episode rolled on, the audience pieced the characters and their stories together: Kurt’s kid brother Ollie was exposed as the ‘thief’ who stole his car; Jambo (Will Mellor) climbed through Kurt’s bedroom window marking his now-trademark move. The first instalment closed with Kurt’s advances towards Natasha rejected not once, but twice… he finally got the message when her Alsatian dog leapt towards him. Nick Pickard (Tony) remains the only remaining cast member from this first episode, although Jeremy Edwards (Kurt) returned in 2013 for Hollyoaks Later. Hollyoaks was originally on once a week until 1996 when this was doubled to two episodes. In 2001 Hollyoaks was being beamed into living rooms four times a week, which went up to five episodes in 2003. E4 episodes, which gave viewers a ‘first-look’ at the next night’s Ch4 edition, began in 2001.\n\nEp 347, The Water Tank with Rob Hawthorne – 14th September 1999\n\nHollyoaks went from two to four episodes a week as a one off for the water tank special. These episodes secured the highest ratings of 1999 with a record of 2.6 million homes tuning in to discover the fate of Lucy, Tony, Ruth and Lewis after Rob Hawthorne tried to drown them at a nautical test centre. Hero Tony swam to the bottom of the tank and found a hatch, saving the gang before perfoming the kiss of life on Lucy on the riverbank, all to the soundtrack of Robbie Williams’ song Angels.\n\nEp 1675, Becca and Justin sleep together – 23rd December 2005\n\nIn one of the best-loved illicit romances on Hollyoaks, teacher Becca, trapped in her loveless marriage with Jake, embarked on an affair with Justin, a pupil in her English class. On Christmas Eve 2005 she went to Justin's house and admitted she was jealous when she found out he had slept with Nicole Owen. This led to a passionate kiss then sex. It was the highest ever-rated Christmas storyline for the soap. Becca and Justin’s ill-fated love affair turned sour when she lost her job, fell pregnant not knowing who the father was, and was eventually jailed for having underage sex with her pupil after Justin gave false evidence against her. Becca was then stabbed to death in prison, leaving sister Nancy and son Charlie behind. Charlie is currently being raised by Nancy and estranged husband Darren. Becca and Justin’s affair won Best Storyline at the British Soap Awards in 2006.\n\nEp 1861, The Dog Fire – 11th September 2006\n\nFive characters were wiped out in the fire that gutted the show’s iconic pub, The Dog in the Pond.

After getting involved with the wrong crowd and becoming a rapist, Sam was sentenced to prison. Desperate for forgiveness, he started writing to his sister, Nicole but when she didn’t want anything to do with him, he tried to take his own life in prison. Sam escaped from hospital and, furious to hear that his brother was dating the girl that got him sent to prison, doused The Dog in petrol. However, when heroic Calvin Valentine smashed a glass over Sam’s head, the arsonist dropped the lighter and the pub blew up. Meanwhile, Steph Dean was upstairs desperately trying to rouse Jake from his drowsy alcoholic state… The fire killed Sam, twins Mel and Sophie Burton, Joe Spencer and Olivia Johnson. Who could forget the chilling scene when Zoe Carpenter calls Joe Spencer to check he had survived, only to hear his distinctive ring tone… coming from a body bag.\n\nEp 1938, Claire tries to kill Max in the woods – 27th December 2006\n\nWhen Claire Devine decided to kill her husband, Max and cash in his £500,000 life insurance pay out she didn’t bank on the loyalty of his friends and baby brother to stand in her way. Claire started working for Max and his best friend, OB at The Loft and soon got in a relationship with Max. Her gold-digging became clear when she seduced wealthy business man, Sean but when OB became suspicious she decided to alienate Max from his friends and family.

The affair came to light at an impromptu engagement party thrown by Frankie for son, Craig and Sarah Barnes. Secretly, John Paul texted Sarah on Craig's phone and told her to come upstairs while him and Craig were getting intimate. She left the party and walked in on the two of them kissing. Completely in shock, Sarah ran downstairs and outted Craig to the party-goers, leaving John Paul to face the wrath of the Dean family and Sarah’s dad, Mike. Despite Craig denying his feelings, fans were later delighted when John Paul and Craig finally cemented their relationship and walked off into the sunset together for a new life in Dublin.

Hannah Ashworth, one of the show's most vivacious characters, formed a friendship with model, Melissa who she meets when she accompanied pal, Sarah Barnes to a modelling job. Always left in Sarah’s shadow, Hannah was grateful when Melissa paid her attention but Melissa was actually controlling and manipulating vulnerable Hannah. Melissa, who had anorexia, encouraged Hannah to lose weight and the girls developed an obsession with avoiding food while keeping friends and family in the dark. In the process Hannah metamorphosed into a withdrawn, deceitful girl who flew into sudden rages with her friends.

From injecting Michaela McQueen with Heroin, to killing John Paul’s priest boyfriend and making it look like suicide, Niall was intent on destroying his family one by one. In his final act of revenge, Niall kidnapped each member of the McQueen family and held them hostage in the church where Myra had left him as a new born. Niall demanded that Myra answer six questions, and for each question she got right another of her children was allowed to live. However, Myra got two questions wrong and was forced to choose which of her children had to die. Jacqui was left heartbroken when Myra chose her and a rift inevitably built between mother and daughter. Niall panicked when Jack, Darren and Dom turned up to rescue the McQueens, and detonated the explosives. Caught under the rubble, Myra told Niall that she would have welcomed him if he’d revealed his true identity. Guilty, Niall tried to save his mother but more rubble falls.

Fans were left wondering who would want to kill good-guy cop Calvin and why everyone seemed to have turned against him. As the months passed, it was revealed that Calvin had not only been having an affair with Mercedes behind her husband, Malachy and sister, Carmel’s backs, but he’d also slept with Theresa McQueen, got her pregnant and was refusing to stand by her. As the wedding day approached, Mercedes was falling for Calvin but had been rejected in favour of Carmel, and Malachy had found out about his wife’s infidelity. Meanwhile, Calvin’s sisters, Sasha and Lauren had discovered that he had been partly responsible for the death of Sasha’s boyfriend, Warren – the amount of people who had motive to kill Calvin was building.

However, to nurse Lynsey Nolan, Silas was a serial killer who preyed on the promiscuous women of Hollyoaks village. By the time Fright Night arrived, sinister Silas had already killed three Hollyoaks ladies, attempted to murder Lynsey Nolan and had kidnapped heavily pregnant Mercedes after finding out she’d been having an affair behind husband, Riley’s back with his dad, Carl. Silas decided to play a game with Lynsey, who was determined to reveal his true identity. He gave her until Halloween to guess who his next victim would be - if she did, he would hand himself to the police, but if she didn’t then there’d be blood on her hands. While Lynsey frantically tried to solve the riddle, Silas was planning to kill her and thought he’d succeeded when he murdered a woman wearing the same Cat Woman costume as her. However, when a lock of blonde hair tumbled from underneath the Cat Woman mask, Silas was sickened to realise he’d actually killed his daughter, Heidi.
