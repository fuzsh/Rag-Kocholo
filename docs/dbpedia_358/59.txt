The Hollyoaks actor and two other male cast members were hand picked by Carey to take part in a short sketch, in which the music diva will mock herself.

Each week a celebrity is invited onto the Channel 4 show to guest present with regular hosts Justin Lee Collins and Alan Carr.

In tomorrow night's skit, Gerard, Andrew Moss (Rhys Ashworth) and Kevin Sacre (Jake Dean) will be seen serenading Mariah in her dressing room as she prepares for the show.

Gerard, who plays cross-dressing Kris Fisher in Hollyoaks, said he was thrilled to be asked to take part in the show and to get the chance to meet one of the world's best selling female artists.

"Basically the Friday Night Project want to make fun of Mariah and her reputation as a diva so they ask her to name her riders," he said.

"Mariah demands that three Hollyoaks hunks sing to her in her dressing room before she goes on.

"The Hollyoaks' producers sent her photos of all the cast and she picked myself, Andrew and Kevin.

"The song we're singing to her is Bright Eyes by Art Garfunkel. It's going to be absolutely hilarious.

"As far as I know, the three of us sing to her and then she joins in as well. I'm really looking forward to it," said the Hollyoaks star.

"I'm dying to see if she 's really as big a diva as she's made out to be, although the fact that she's prepared to make fun of herself suggests that maybe she's not.

"I'm not a big fan of hers but Andy is and he can't wait to meet her," he said.

It's not the first time the west Belfast actor has sung on television with a legend.

In 2006 he teamed up with Sheila Ferguson of The Three Degrees to duet on the BBC Children In Need show.

He also performed at the Big Buzz Irish Entertainment Awards at the Whitla Hall in Belfast, singing a George Michael track.
