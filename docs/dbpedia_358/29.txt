Hollyoaks actor Kevin Sacre is to return to the Channel 4 soap to wrap up his character's storyline, according to reports.

Now magazine claims that the 31-year-old, who quit his role as Jake Dean in April 2008 after six years, will allegedly return to the programme for a "brief stint" towards the end of the year.

In the show, Jake was sectioned last year after attempting to rape his then-wife Nancy (Jessica Fox) and kill baby Charlie. He was then framed for the murder of Sean Kennedy by Warren (Jamie Lomas) and Darren (Ashley Taylor Dawson).

Sacre recently became engaged to Strictly Come Dancing's Camilla Dallerup.
