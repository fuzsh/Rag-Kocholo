The Channel 4 soap is to dedicate a whole week to the hard-hitting plot, which saw teacher Becca - played by Ali Bastian - embark on a relationship with student Justin (Chris Fountain), as part of the show's 25th anniversary spin-off series 'Hollyoaks@25'.

'Oaks' fans will see the soap flashback to when Becca is pregnant and doesn't know whether the father is Justin or her husband Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre).

The Becca and Justin week episodes will air from Monday (10.08.20) to Friday (14.08.20), with the first set to see Justin take Becca to the hospital after she starts bleeding, only for the nurse to mistake him for her little brother due to him wearing his school uniform.

And the week will come to a climax when Jake demands to know who Becca has been sleeping with.

Jennifer Metcalfe - who has played Mercedes McQueen on the soap since 2006 - recently admitted she recalls watching the "daring" plot before she joined the show.

She said: "I remember, before I joined 'Hollyoaks', watching the teacher storyline with Chris Fountain and Ali Bastian.

"I remember being aware of that storyline. I didn't watch it religiously, but I remember thinking, 'Wow that's like the first time such a daring storyline has been done on screen.' "

However, Becca ended up paying the ultimate price for her school pupil infidelity, as she was murdered in prison shortly before she was about to be set free.
