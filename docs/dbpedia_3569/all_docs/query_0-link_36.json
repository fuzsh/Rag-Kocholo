        "text": "Alliance builds on the Boeing and Logistic Center Woensdrecht (LCW) partnership to help increase readiness rates of RNLAF Chinooks and Apaches and develop opportunities for Dutch industry\n\nWOOD DALE, Ill., /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --AAR (NYSE: AIR) and the Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) have signed a letter of intent to cooperate on component maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) capabilities to support Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) rotorcraft operations.\n\n\"Boeing is working with Dutch industry to develop the most effective ways to increase the readiness rates of Royal Netherlands Air Force CH-47 Chinook and AH-64D Apache helicopters through its partnership with the Netherlands Ministry of Defence Logistic Center Woensdrecht,\" said Peri Widener, Boeing Global Services & Support director of Rotorcraft Support. \"Boeing also is focused on building relationships with suppliers that can help the company continue to deliver affordable, reliable logistics, sustainment and MRO solutions that maximize global readiness for our customers here and elsewhere.\"\n\n\"AAR has extensive experience servicing aircraft components for air forces in Europe, the United States and other foreign countries, including on a number of platforms for which Boeing is the original equipment manufacturer,\" said Mat van Vugt, Vice President for AAR's aircraft component services business. \"We look forward to building on that experience by working with Boeing and Logistic Center Woensdrecht to help ensure that Dutch Chinooks and Apaches are ready when the Royal Netherlands Air Force needs them.\"\n\nBoeing has a long record of working closely and successfully with Dutch defense customers and industry. Most recently, Boeing has been working in partnership with the LCW to expand MRO capabilities in-country and develop opportunities for Dutch industry. That alliance strives to increase readiness rates of the Boeing-built CH-47 Chinook and AH-64D Apache helicopters operated by the RNLAF, and aims to eventually broaden regional MRO activities through support opportunities on other military and civilian aircraft.\n\nThe letter of intent with AAR is the first industry collaboration to grow out of the November 2010 framework agreement between Boeing and LCW. Boeing's collaboration with LCW and AAR advances the \"Maintenance Valley\" initiative supported by the Dutch government to bolster the Netherlands' position as a regional hub for military and civilian aircraft MRO activities and will grow the volume of MRO work in the Netherlands.\n\nAAR Aircraft Component Services (AAR ACS) specializes in the overhaul, repair and maintenance of components for aircraft including RNLAF CH-47 Chinooks and KDC-10s, F-16s, C-130s and NATO AWACS B707 aircraft. Additionally, it has repair depot responsibilities at the Royal Air Force base at Waddington, United Kingdom. AAR ACS, a division of AAR International, is a leading provider of component repair services for various Boeing and other commercial and military aircraft. AAR also helped Boeing set up a Next-Generation 737 Spares Exchange Program in which it shared responsibility for supply chain logistics and warehousing. ACS has been a Boeing Performance Excellence Award recipient for the past three years. Boeing issues this award annually to recognize suppliers who achieve superior performance through quality and delivery.\n\nAAR is a leading provider of value-added products and services to the worldwide aerospace and government and defense industries. With facilities and sales locations around the world, AAR uses its close-to-the-customer business model to serve its customers through four operating segments: Aviation Supply Chain; Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul; Structures and Systems; and Government and Defense Services.
