        "text": "Abstract:A validation study on the selection tests of the Royal Netherlands Air Force was performed by the University of Twente, The Netherlands in cooperation with the Royal Dutch Airforce (RNLAF). This validation study was performed according the research question: What is the predictive validity of the selection tests of the RNLAF concerning the chances of passing/failing the Elementary Military Flight Training (EMFT)? The selection tests that were analysed were the tests of two psychological assessments and two job sample tests. The psychological assessment tests were formed by an instrument interpretation test, a sensori motor coordination test, a dichotic listening test, and six personality competencies based on an interview, personality tests and group assignments. The job sample tests consist of a set of automated (simulator) flight and a set of real flights. Predicting whether a trainee in the selection tests would be able to pass the EMFT is called classification. A need for knowledge on classification errors lead to hypothesis 1: Using the predictors of the selection tests of the Royal Netherlands Air Force causes a change in wrong classification when compared to classification without predictors. Findings in previous research lead to hypothesis 2 and 3. Hypothesis 2: The capacities measured in the first psychological assessment are the predictors with the greatest influence on the probability of correctly classifying the pass/fail EMFT criterion? Whereas hypothesis 3 is: The scores measured in the simulator flights, and scores measured in the real flights are the predictors with the greatest influence on correctly classifying the pass/fail EMFT criterion. Whethers predictor also add predictive value independently was hypothesis 4. Data was used from digital and paper dossiers and consisted of obtained scores on selection tests obtained by trainees that had succeeded all selection tests, and participated in the EMFT, thus both failed and passed. The sample consisted of 110 cases of trainees that participated in the EMFT between 2005 and 2008. The sample had a passing rate of 56.4%, n= 62. Predictors were chosen based on interviews and kept mostly at end scores of tests. A backward logistic regression analysis was performed with passing/failing EMFT as criterion. Predictors were transformed to standardised Z-scores. Results from analysis were compared to results from a base model. This model contains a constant but does not include any predictors. The model produced by the analysis was reached in twenty steps and contained the predictor mental load in the real flights. This model showed an overall correct classification of 61.1%; 40.7% positives; 20.4% negatives; 25.9% false positives, and 13.0% false negatives. This supported hypothesis 3 partly. The analysis of group and individual predictors showed that predictors from the real flights were significantly predictive of passing/failing the EMFT, this provided support for hypothesis 4. Analysis of a full model including all predictors showed a 75.9% overall correct prediction and one significant predictor being the mental load of the real flights. Classification results changed due to use of predictors compared to the base model giving support for hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 could not be supported."
