The letter identifies the aircraft type and the number is strictly sequential within the letter block. The letters are reused once a type has been retired. An example serial is F-16AM J-248.\n\nMain Headquarters:\n\nVan De Boshstraat 8, Den Haag.\n\nCurrent Organisational Structure:\n\nThe old Wing and Group structure has been abandoned, and the KLu is now simply organised into a number of operational squadrons. An Apache unit and a F-16 unit are located in the USA for training purposes.\n\nCurrent Order of Battle:\n\nTable of Current Order of Battle\n\nHistorical Orders of Battle:\n\nList of Historical Orders of Battle - to be added.\n\nAll-Time Flying Units List:\n\nTo be added."
