        "text": "Royal Netherlands Airforce Selects Frequentis Secure Voice Communication System as Most Economically Advantageous in Tender\n\nThe Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) is replacing three end of life voice communication systems (VCS), selecting the Frequentis secure VCS as the most suitable for its demands in a competitive tender.\n\nRNLAF is responsible for the safety and the integrity of national and NATO airspace, with voice communications systems (VCS) being the primary communication for crew in their execution of tasks. The three VCS to be replaced support up to 100 controller working positions.\n\nPeter Skiczuk, Frequentis Vice President Defence, said:\n\nThe Frequentis voice communication system has a clear focus on cost efficiency over the lifespan of a system, providing customers with a very low total cost of ownership. The proposed solution is based on the Frequentis secure VCS, specifically designed for military applications, and is the product supporting the highest diversity of radio manufacturers and radio models on the market. We are looking forward to working closely with RNLAF to deliver a system that fully supports their requirements.\n\nFrequentis is an experienced system integrator, providing turnkey solutions and support for other military customers including a long relationship with the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr), providing military VCS since 1997, replacing VCS for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence for over two decades, and various projects for the US Department of Defence for over 15 years, with all systems still in operational use. Frequentis also supplied the Slovak Air Force with a NATO compliant air-toground and ground-to-ground communication system in 2019.\n\nThe Frequentis solution proved itself to be the most advantageous in the selection process, also proving its reliability and compliance to all criteria including NATO compliance.\n\nIn 2021 Frequentis acquired Melbourne-based C4i PTY Ltd, responsible for the VOICE C2 missioncritical Voice Communication Systems product range. C4i secure VCS is used by defence, governments, and industry in over 35 countries including for the US Air Force and Marine Corps, UK Ministry of Defence, Qatar Ministry of Defence and in the Air Defence segment of the Royal Australian Air Force.\n\nThis article was originally published by Frequentis.\n\nTags"
