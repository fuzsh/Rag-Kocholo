        "text": "Heli-One, a leading provider of helicopter maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services, has signed an agreement extension with the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) to provide aircraft and component maintenance on their AS532 Cougar helicopter fleet. The RNLAF will benefit from this contract extension with uninterrupted maintenance support from experienced teams to optimize downtime.\n\nHeli-One began the original contract in 2018 and the RNLAF will continue to benefit from Heli-One’s high level of AS332/532 maintenance expertise and customer service, industry-leading safety & quality and extensive experience supporting military fleets. Heli-One will support the RNLAF with inspections, maintenance and modifications through the end of the Cougar’s current expected service lifespan through to 2030.\n\nThe RNLAF provide a wide variety of security services to their national citizens and global community. They play an important role in maintaining airspace security around the world and utilize a diverse fixed- and rotor-wing fleet to complete their missions. They operate 12 AS532 Cougars as well as CH-47, AH-64 Apaches and NH-90 helicopters from several bases around the Netherlands.\n\n“During the original contract, Heli-One has gained the confidence of the RNLAF. Through joint efforts in the recent years, an optimal work flow has been attained. Almost all helicopters of our fleet have been maintained by Heli-One with overall good results. We are looking forward to continue our relationship during the upcoming modifications of our fleet the next few years,” said Colonel Robin Schoonen, acting Commander Logistics Center Woensdrecht.\n\n“We are thrilled to continue this maintenance support for the RNLAF Cougars. Our team has worked with other global fleets of Cougar and Super Puma helicopters to deliver value and enhance aircraft availability. Our team is delighted to continue to grow and build upon an already solid working relationship,” said Carolyn Forsyth, General Manager of Sales, Commercial & Customer Support.\n\nHeli-One is widely recognized as a global leader in support of the Puma family, with more than 30 years of experience. Heli-One has supported both military and civil customers and practically every mission profile that utilizes this adaptable platform. Support offerings include everything from nose-to-tail, including engines and comprehensive support. In-house design teams on two continents have developed more than 40 supplemental type certificates (STCs) for this helicopter type and continue to find innovative solutions for customers to maximize operational capability and efficiency.\n\nThis press release was prepared and distributed by Heli-One."
