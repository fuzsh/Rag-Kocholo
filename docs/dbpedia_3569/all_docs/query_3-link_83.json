        "text": "As a child, what did you aspire to be?\n\n“I had no doubts about what I wanted to be later”, Vincent says. “Even as a child I was interested in two specific groups: the uniformed professions (the army, police, etc.) and the legal professions (lawyer, judge, public prosecutor). What sparked these interests? I used to watch TV programmes about judges and lawyers; I think those made a big impression. I was drawn to their way of working, their sense of justice and the variety in their work. As for the uniformed professions, I have always had a penchant for that kind of hierarchy, adventure and close cooperation with colleagues.’’\n\n“After high school, I did my bachelor’s in Law at Maastricht University, followed by a master’s in Dutch Law, specialising in Constitutional and Administrative Law. These programmes fit well with my childhood aspirations. My studies would have opened doors to a legal career, but at the same time a legal education is a big plus in the uniformed professions. In addition, Problem-Based Learning at UM was right up my alley. I was given a lot of freedom in Maastricht to organise my studies in a way that suited me. Besides studying I did all kinds of extracurricular activities, not to mention sports.”\n\nWhere do you work now?\n\n“After my master’s degree I worked for a sports event agency, which organised huge events like Hammer Limburg and IRONMAN Netherlands. It was a great job, but I got the itch to join the army, and I just couldn’t shake it. So I put my name in the hat for a job with the Royal Netherlands Air Force. I deliberately opted for a combat position, as commander of a platoon in the Force Protection unit. I was interested in ‘pure’ military work, not an office job. As a young officer in a combat role, you get to manage large groups of people in exciting exercises and adventurous activities.’’\n\n“After an intensive officer training at the Royal Military Academy and a technical study programme at the Royal Air Force Military School, I was posted to Volkel Air Base as a Special Operations platoon commander. I’m involved in operations as well as leading a group of around 50 men and women. They do surveillance and security for the airbase, and are part of a special NATO unit called Strike Security. I see them as ‘my’ people; I feel very responsible for them. They often ask questions of a legal nature; from questions about holiday leave and study options to questions about the Working Hours Act and military law. So my studies at UM come in handy in my daily work, but also in my ancillary position as a legal officer, explaining the military-legal aspects of files in criminal cases. Every soldier suspected of an offense is entitled to this explanation.”\n\nWhere do you see yourself in 10 years?\n\n“Since joining the army I’ve had dozens of fantastic experiences, from intensive study programmes and courses in the Netherlands and abroad, to training as a parachutist, to beautiful ceremonies and stylish galas. In 10 years I hope to have broadened my experience as an Air Force officer through different positions in the areas of operations, personnel and training, likely combined with a posting to a mission abroad.”\n\n“From a personal perspective, I’ll probably be living with my dear partner Valérie somewhere central in the Netherlands. You’re supposed to change jobs every three years, so if you live in the middle of the country you can get around easily. Ultimately, I hope to climb the ranks in the army and work my way up to the policymaking branch. I have one main rule: enjoying your job is by far the most important thing! Will I ever switch to a legal profession? Probably not, because right now I feel like a fish in water. But in the long run, who knows?”"
