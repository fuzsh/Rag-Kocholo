        "text": "On July 31, 2024, the first EagleEye multi-mode radar came off the production line of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI). The new radar is a high-performance system that delivers high-resolution, photographic-quality imagery that can be captured through clouds, rain, dust, smoke, and fog at multiple times the range of previous radars.\n\nThe Japan Coast Guard (JCG) has signed a contract for the purchase of two SeaGuardian® Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) from General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), scheduled for delivery in 2025.\n\nGeneral Atomics (GA) hosted its 7th biennial Supplier Performance Program Awards Luncheon on August 8, 2024 at the scenic Rancho Bernardo Inn in San Diego, CA. The Supplier Awards Luncheon served as an opportunity to reward and honor the contributions of GA’s top-performing Suppliers who have consistently demonstrated excellence in delivery, innovation, quality and collaboration.\n\nWith the completion of the U.S. Navy’s Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) flight operations on July 28, 2024, the MQ-9B SeaGuardian® Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) supplied by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., self-deployed back to its home base in El Mirage, Calif., but only after introducing an array of new capabilities."
