        "text": "Embraer C-390 beats C-130J in the Netherlands and it will become its new tactical transport\n\nThe Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands has chosen the C-390M from Brazilian manufacturer Embraer as the successor and replacement for its C-130H Hercules. T\n\nInteresting choice and badly needed breakthrough for Embrear on Euro Market asside ecisting order from Portugal. I do see attraction for C390 over C130J. However for an Airforce that only used small fleet of tactical airlift, still a daring choice.\n\nIt is an understandable but still remarkable choice for the Netherlands, to order the KC-390 instead of the C-130J.\n\nNot only the KLu has already 4 C-130s in its fleet, but the Netherlands normally buy american stuff because of political reasons.\n\nAccording to the staatssecretaris the 4 C-130s operated by the KLu have reached the end of their service life. I wonder if they are totally worn out or are still usable for air forces looking for second hand Herculeses.\n\nBtw, the Netherlands will be the third European country after Portugal (5) and Hungary (2) ordered the KC-390.\n\nI do hope more C390 breakthrough, but so far not as much as market expected before. In paper this arcraft should offer much efficiency as using commercial engine, shares many systems with E Series and basically provide brand new design against competitor.\n\nStill even this is small order, but come from an Air Force that as you say, ussually bought American. Perhaps because Dutch Air Force only use 4 C130 so far, it is small fleet that they can afford to change from C130 altogether. Those with larger C130 fleet perhaps has to think more consideration on changing to C390.\n\nThe problem at present is there are no bigger Air Forces currently looking for a major procurement of Aircraft in this category. The big Euros are concentrating on the A400, the Japanese have the C-2, ROK is looking at developing its own Aircraft. There are medium term possibilities like Australia, maybe Israel and some ME Countries for orders up to 20+ Aircraft.\n\nIt is an understandable but still remarkable choice for the Netherlands, to order the KC-390 instead of the C-130J.\n\nNot only the KLu has already 4 C-130s in its fleet, but the Netherlands normally buy american stuff because of political reasons.\n\nAccording to the staatssecretaris the 4 C-130s operated by the KLu have reached the end of their service life. I wonder if they are totally worn out or are still usable for air forces looking for second hand Herculeses.\n\nBtw, the Netherlands will be the third European country after Portugal (5) and Hungary (2) ordered the KC-390.\n\nWow yeah... as far as I can see only real insiders (unlike people like me) have seen this coming. It seems that Brazil has been working hard on this behind the scenes. And it's nice to see an expansion of the transport fleet, which was on the small side for what was being asked of them to be honest.\n\nAs for resale potential? I don't know how much value is still left in those frames, they accelerated their replacement for a reason. That is not to say that they are completely run down, the Luchtmacht puts a lot of effort into keeping them in good shape. And initially they where supposed to soldier on until the 2030 timeframe, but normal maintenance procedures and schedules weren't keeping up with the operational tempo. Which is also why they are expanding the fleet, to better keep up with the demands being placed on them.\n\nSo as far as their condition? I think they might be in better shape than some air frames that still might get overhauled, and the two C-130H30's where bought new in the mid 90's. But the other two where bought second hand in the 2000's and upgraded to C-130H standard, and I remember reading somewhere that they used a lot of bespoke (or at least non standard) equipment in the cockpits. So they don't look like a very attractive purchase to me, not to mention that they've been flown hard and the oldest frame was built in 1978!"
