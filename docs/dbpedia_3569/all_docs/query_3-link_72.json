        "text": "After school I joined the Royal Netherlands Air Force as a conscripted soldier. During my enlistment I was infected with the virus called flying and during my 10 years at the air force I flew the Fokker S-11, Fouga Magister. T-Bird, NF-5 and the Starfighter. When I left the air force I started flying as a commercial pilot for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.\n\nIn 2007 I retired, but I’m still in the possession of a current pilot license. Right now I’m a spokesperson for the Historische Vliegtuigen Volkel (HVV).\n\nI work at the Royal Netherlands Air Force 312 squadron as a crewchief/mechanic and I’m a longtime aviation enthusiast.\n\nI am one of the mechanics at the HVV team as well as one of the photographers.\n\nAfter a 35 year long career as an avionics technician and instructor with the Royal Netherlands Air Force I became an attendant for the Historical Room Typhoon in 2001.\n\nIn 2004, together with Bas Leusink, I started the Starfighter Rescue Team, which later would be named Historische Vliegtuigen Volkel (HVV).\n\nNowadays I’m a B2 (avionics) technician, specialist painting and stencilling, and manager for technical publications for the HVV.\n\nIn 1972 I started my career as an aircraft technician in the RNLAF. I became crew chief of the maintenance crew in the in 1980 started team with testbed J-646. After 3 years doing this I had the opportunity to learn flying, which I did, to become instructor in the F-16 procedure and combat simulator until my retirement in 2004.\n\nIn 2005 I joined the Historische Vliegtuigen Volkel (HVV) because it is a great project and the history should be kept alive. And in my opinion not only visual but also audible.\n\nAfter retirement I also educated young A1 and B2 students in the Engine and Propellor Modules for both civil and military aircraft.\n\nI joined the HVV during my internship at Volkel Air Base as a B.1.1 mechanic student, back in 2008. At the HVV I’m an allround aircraft mechanic and photographer.\n\nBesides my work as a volunteer at the HVV I work at a pharmaceutical company in Oss as an engineer.\n\nI’m a retired Royal Netherlands Air Force airman and have worked at the 311 Squadron at Volkel Air Base. During my time as an active duty member (in which I was also known as “The Gambler”) I’ve worked on the F-104G and the F-16. First in maintenance, later as a crew chief and flight chief, and finally I became a hangar chief until my retirement in 2000.\n\nIn 2016 I visited the HVV and it instantly brought back that feeling everyone who’s been in the air force and around fighter jets knows too well. So I didn’t hesitate and joined the HVV.\n\nI joined the HVV back in 2015 during my internship as a graphic designer (with the 900 Squadron ‘Painters Shop’ at Volkel Airbase).\n\nAt the HVV I make different designs for promotional materials. I’m also a general volunteer and I have the privilege to get taught by professionals about the aircraft.\n\nDuring my time as a development engineer at the Royal Netherlands Air Force Depot during the ‘80s, the features and beauty of the LN-3 Inertial Navigation System of the Starfighter were inspiring me to bring this system back to life. Now, being part of the HVV, we have the pleasure of owning a live LN-3 system, on display.\n\nWith a background in electronics my daytime job is now confined to airborne Electronic Warfare systems for the Defense Material Organisation, and during HVV moments dedicated to F-104G avionics.\n\nI got to know the Starfighter when I started my hobby as an aviation enthusiast in 1968 and expanded my acquaintance during my time in military service at the 306 photo reconnaissance squadron.\n\nI’ve been working in a photography store for 35 years. So I can truly say that photography has become a part of me. Some time ago, I “retired” and now have plenty of time for our grandchildren, gardening, photography, and aviation.\n\nI expect to make myself useful at the Historische Vliegtuigen Volkel by photographing all the spare parts in storage. Beside that task, I offer support and assistance to the other activities and – of course – the Orpheus working group.\n\nJoep is not only our senior employee but also our walking encyclopedia;\n\nAsk him anything about the 104 and he gives the correct answer.\n\nMoreover, he points out in the aircraft where what is supposed to be and how it works.\n\nJoep mainly works in the field of electrical engineering.\n\nUnfortunately, Joep passed away on 27 August 2019. We will miss him, his great knowledge and wonderful stories.\n\nWhen I grew up my dad was an F-104G crew-/flight-chief at 312 Squadron. The F-104 virus stuck and never left. Besides my day job I am also part of the Aviation PhotoCrew, an international team of photographers that organize air-to-air photography projects during airshows throughout Europe.\n\nAfter visiting the Historical Vliegtuigen Volkel regularly over the last 15 years and supporting them passively as well as a donator, I joined the DSF/HVV at the end of 2019, tasked with communication.\n\nI joined the Royal Netherlands Air Force in 1966 and retired in 2002. During my time in the Air Force, I have been working 13 years as an Avionics Specialist for the F-104G Starfighter at Volkel Air base. Beside that I have been working as a Business Expert and was stationed at several locations within the Air Force.\n\nAfter retiring I was a volunteer in the Royal Netherlands Walking Association. In July 2017 I met a former colleague during the Nijmegen Vierdaagse who told me that a team of former colleagues are performing the restauration of an F-104G Starfighter. That triggered me and I went to Volkel Air Base to see what is going on there. No doubt, I’ve joined the HVV-team right away.\n\nI joined the Royal Netherlands Air Force in 1978 and have been working as a Specialist VO / Specialist Aircraft Maintenance F-104 until 1984. In 1984 I was retrained to Specialist VO / Specialist Aircraft Maintenance F-16. From 1985 to 1998 I’ve been working at the X-Service. After this, I was employed at 311 Squadron as a Crew Chief, Flight Chief and Line Chief until 2012.\n\nWhen the 311 Squadron ceased to exist on September 29, 2012, I left the Air Force.\n\nIn March 1972 I entered the Royal Netherlands Air Force Cadre School. Trained as a non- commissioned officer in the field of Armament &Electronics and posted at Twente Air Base in 1974. That provided some extra cherries on the cake with 20 hours of backseat NF-5. Later, after completing some studies, I was selected as officer and placed in the field of Intelligence and Security at the Air Force Staff, VLB Leeuwarden, VLB Twente and the KLu Operation Center. From 1997 to 2006 I was posted abroad: CAOC-1/Finderup, AIRNORTH/Ramstein AB and CAOC-2/ Kalkar-Uedem. From the end of 2005, until the end of 2009 I was placed at the MIVD as Account Officer Air Force and Chief of Operations. Left service in December 2009 and went on as a civilian as lecturer at the DIVI (Defence Intelligence School) and posted as Reserve Officer to the Air Force Staff in Breda for a few years.\n\nIn the 1960s I was a member of the Youth Aviation Brigade/KNvvL and came into contact with the F104G and J79 in the form of lessons given by RNLAF instructors on Starfighter maintenance. My flying experience include 35 years of gliding, motor gliding and motor flying, also as an instructor and examiner.\n\nI am a retired weapons technician and I have been working as a specialist at 312 squadron and at 900 squadron as work center chief OFF equipment. After my military service, as a civilian, I guided VEVA students at Volkel Air Base. In the past, I have been working on the F-104G and the F-16.\n\nAfter my renewed first job on the F-104G, I joined the HVV. I hope to use my knowledge and skills to make the F-104G usable again in the field of weapon technology.\n\nI joined the Airforce in 1969 as a professional soldier in the armament department at Volkel air base. I have been working there for 12 years in various departments: the ejection seat workshop, B&E squadron maintenance workshop, 312 Sqn and the Firing Range.\n\nAfter further study, I switched to Logistics where I held various positions. I fulfilled my final position as Cdt Logistics at the KMA, after which I left the service.\n\nAll the time the Starfighter has remained my pet and I have had the pleasure of working on it"
