Mig-29’s hold their ground pretty well but having a bit more diversity especially having such a loved aircraft might really be a lot of fun!\n\nDescription and History\n\nThe F-16, also known as the Fighting Falcon, is a tactical fighter aircraft with a single engine and supersonic speed capabilities. It was originally developed by General Dynamics, now a part of Lockheed Martin, for the United States Air Force (USAF). The USAF made its first F-16 purchase in 1972, and the aircraft made its debut flight in 1976. The F-16 was initially conceived as a lightweight aircraft for air-to-air combat in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. It is known for its unique features such as a frameless bubble canopy for better cockpit visibility, a side-mounted control stick for easier control, a 30-degree reclined ejection seat to reduce the impact of g-forces on the pilot, and the pioneering use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system, which contributes to its agility.\n\nThe Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) was one of the initial buyers of the F-16A aircraft, purchasing 213 units. This made the Netherlands one of the four European Participating Air Forces and one of the five countries to manufacture the F-16 locally. However, due to force reductions, the fleet was reduced to 68 aircraft, all of which were upgraded to the Mid-Life Update (MLU) standard. Some of the excess aircraft were sold to Jordan and Chile.\n\nIn 1989, a two-year study was initiated to investigate potential mid-life upgrades for the USAF’s and European Partner Air Forces’ (EPAF’s) Block 15 F-16A. The outcome was the F-16 Mid-Life Update (MLU) package, which aimed to upgrade the cockpit and avionics to match those of the F-16C/D Block 50/52, add the ability to use radar-guided air-to-air missiles, and generally enhance the operational performance while improving the reliability, supportability, and maintainability of the aircraft. Key enhancements included a modular mission computer with increased data processing speed, an advanced IFF system that allows “BVR weapons delivery beyond radar limits,” and an upgraded radar—the APG-66(V)2A—with extended range and the ability to track and engage more targets. Aircraft that received these upgrades were designated F-16AM or F-16BM (for single-seat or dual-seat, respectively). While some sources refer to the F-16 MLU as Block 20, this designation was specifically used for new-production jets, with upgraded jets being referred to as MLU or Block 15 MLU.\n\nArmament\n\nPrimary;\n\nM61 A1 Vulcan\n\nAir-to-Air Missiles;\n\nAIM-9N\n\nAIM-9L\n\nAIM-9M\n\nAIM-9X\n\nAIM-7 Sparrow\n\nAIM-120 AMRAAM\n\nAir-to-Ground Missiles;\n\nAGM-65 Maverick\n\nNavigation/Targeting;\n\nAN/AAQ-13 & AN/AAQ-14 LANTIRN\n\nBombs;\n\nGBU-31 and GBU-38 JDAM\n\nCockpit Displays and Indicators\n\nWide Angle Conventional Head Up display\n\nGEC Marconi Avionics’ new WAC HUD enhances readability and comfort for pilots. It offers a wider view, supports night operations, and is FLIR and EEGS compatible.\n\nMulti-Function Display\n\nHoneywell’s Multi-Function Display (MFD) set, featuring two color active matrix liquid crystal displays, will replace the current REO-IU and SCP. This upgrade will significantly enhance pilot’s situational awareness and flight safety.\n\nEnhanced Upgraded Programmable Display Generator\n\nThe EUPDG supports the two-color MFDs and allows for twelve display programs. It includes a color Horizontal Situation Display, enhancing the pilot’s tactical view. It features a 20MHz, 32-bit Intel 80960 Display Processor and a 256K RAM system memory. The color graphics controller uses the T.I. TMS34020 Raster Graphics Chipset.\n\nStructure & Avionics / Avionics upgrade\n\nModular Mission Computer\n\nModular Mission Computer is the centerpiece of the Mid Life Update package, offering new capabilities like sensors and weapons, and improving pilot interfaces. It uses MIPSCO R3000 32-bit RISC microprocessors and an object-oriented design for efficient software development and maintenance. The MMC will replace the XFCC, HUD EU, and XCIU, reducing volume by 42%, weight by 55%, and power consumption by 37%. It has 24 slots, with ten reserved for future expansion.\n\nFire Control Radar\n\nThe AN/APG-66(V2) Fire Control Radar (FCR) by Westinghouse is set to receive a new signal data processor. This upgrade will enable:\n\nTWS mode for up to ten targets.\n\n25% increase in detection and tracking range.\n\nEnhanced Doppler Beam Sharpening mode (DBS).\n\nImproved air-ground and ground mapping modes.\n\nMedium resolution DNS.\n\nEnhanced ECCM.\n\nCompatibility with color displays.\n\n40% reliability improvement with the MLU kit and receiver.\n\nPhysical parameters:\n\nVolume : 3.43 cu. ft.\n\nWeight : 261.5 lb\n\nPower : 3285 V/A AC (Max), 155 Watts DC (Nominal)\n\nCooling : 11.3 lb/min a 27degr. C\n\nAdvanced IFF\n\nThe Hazeltine APX-113 AIFF (Advanced Identification Friend-or-Foe System) system is getting an upgrade for better range (100 Nm) through four antennas, known as “bird slicers”. These will be the key change in the Mid Life Update.\n\nSpecifications\n\nEngine: One Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 turbofan, rated at 14,590 lb.s.t. dry and 23,770 lb.s.t. with afterburning.\n\nMaximum speed: Mach 2.05 at 40,000 feet. Service ceiling 55,000 feet. Maximum range 2400 miles. Initial climb rate 62,000 feet per minute.\n\nDimensions: wingspan 32 feet 9 1/2 inches, length 49 feet 3 1/2 inches, height 16 feet 8 1/2 inches, wing area 300 square feet.\n\nWeights: 16,285 pounds empty, 25,281 pounds combat, 37,500 pounds maximum takeoff."
