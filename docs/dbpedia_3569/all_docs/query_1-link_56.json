        "text": "The Military Order of William is the oldest and, at the same time, highest honour of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The honour was instituted by law, no. 5 of 30 April 1815. That act, comprised of 12 articles, was in force until 30 April 1940 when it was revised, while ‘retaining its proven sound basis’.\n\nThe first article now read as follows:\n\n‘There is an Order, instituted to reward members of the armed forces in the service of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, who have distinguished themselves in battle by outstanding acts of bravery, skill and loyalty.\n\nIn special cases, non-military Dutch subjects and foreign nationals, who have distinguished themselves by such acts, may also be admitted into the order.’\n\nThe Military Order of William is comprised of four classes:\n\nKnights of the First Class, or Grand Cross,\n\nKnights of the Second Class, or Commanders,\n\nKnights of the Third Class,\n\nKnights of the Fourth Class.\n\nThe first person who had the honour of being admitted to the register of the Order was the Prince of Orange – later King William II – who had led Dutch troops in 1815 at Quatre Bras and Waterloo.\n\nThere were more than a thousand awards made following these two battles and there would be many more during the remainder of the nineteenth century. A large number of new knights, for instance, were admitted to the register after the Belgian Revolt in 1830 and the Ten Days’ Campaign a year later. The Netherlands-Indies was the main region where the Military Order of William could be earned. The problem area of Aceh ‘took the honours’, almost literally, in this respect. In the years between 1873 and 1927, the innumerable military actions that took place there led to a harvest of two Grand Crosses, six Commanders Crosses, 42 Knights of the Third Class Crosses and more than 800 Knights of the Fourth Class Crosses. Until 1940, a total of 5,874 persons had been awarded the Military Order of William.\n\nSince 1940, 199 names have been added to the register of the Military Order of William. Among them were two members of the Royal family, Prince Bernhard, who was appointed Commander on 15 June 1946 , and Princess Wilhelmina, who was appointed to Knight of the First Class on 4 September 1948.\n\nThey received their awards in recognition of their inspiring leadership during the Second World War.\n\nThe princess was the first woman to be admitted to the register of the Order. Furthermore, six elements of the Netherlands armed forces were also decorated as a consequence of their actions during the Second World War:\n\nthe Naval Air Arm of the Royal Netherlands Navy;\n\nthe Marine Corps of the Royal Netherlands Navy;\n\nthe Submarine Service of the Royal Netherlands Navy;\n\nthe Royal Netherlands ‘Prinses Irene’ Brigade, whose traditions are continued by the ‘Prinses Irene’ Fusilier Guards Regiment;\n\nthe Military Air Arm in the Netherlands, whose traditions are continued by the Royal Netherlands Air Force;\n\nthe Military Air Arm of the Royal Netherlands Indies Army, whose traditions are continued by the Royal Netherlands Air Force."
