        "text": "The Royal International Air Tattoo marked several themes in 2024 and also welcomed its 58th participating nation. Compared to 2023, RIAT enjoyed far more benign weather conditions this year and attracted a sell-out crowd of 150,000 and 248 aircraft over the three-day showcase of military aviation. Amongst the nearly 20 hours flying displays were memorable formations and those special moments that mark out RIAT as one of the most outstanding airshows.\n\nPaul Johnson/Flightline UK reports. All photography by the author.\n\nFor over 50 years, the Royal International Air Tattoo has grown into the most outstanding aviation showcase. In 2024, it is perhaps more of a festival than just another airshow attracting the most hardened aviation for six days of aerial action covering the arrival days, the weekend show day and the departures on Monday. From the Friday to Sunday, it becomes an incredible family day out with an incredible array of attractions on top of the day long flying displays.\n\nOver that half century, the organisers of RIAT have faced all manner of challenges and threats. Recently, event security and the duty of care to attendees has become the overriding challenge to all event organisers in wake of the Manchester Arena bombing. The repercussions from the enquiry into that attack have led to ‘Martyn’s Law’ which is passing through parliament slowly. However, some police forces and local authorities have already started to act on the enquiry’s findings. In the case of RIAT, it was required to change the entry process with security check prior to ticket checks and entry onto the showground. This caused a fair amount of consternation on social media and forums. However, any pre-event concerns were totally unwarranted as the changes improved the smoothness of entry greatly with little queuing. Less good was the exit from the car parks, particularly the blue car park. You should always expect some delay and queuing on leaving, but it does not look when there is significant queuing and the car park staff are sleeping in long grass or hiding in their pick-up truck at the back of the car park – particularly when pedestrians are having to cross through the traffic. Last impressions count just as well as first impressions.\n\nA further challenge of recent years is the cost of attending RIAT. It does however compare well with similar premium events in the UK and the admission price also reflects the investment required to stage the event. However, it is costings that RIAT has no control of which may affect how people attend the event, particularly the price of local hotel accommodation. While many save money by camping, that is not for everyone and hotel rates in Swindon, Cirencester and other local towns have skyrocketed. Many we spoke to over the course of the weekend were thinking very carefully about their hotels for next year. It also shouldn’t be forgotten that hotel costs affects RIAT directly with aircrew accommodation which this year stretched as far away as Abingdon!\n\nThe show itself though was back to its very best with a very full line-up of aircraft and entertainment. At the core of RIAT and its parent charity, the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, is the mission to inspire the next generation. For many years the ‘Techno Zone’ has been central to this with superb support from the aerospace industry. That was bolstered for 2024 with the ‘Inspire’ stage with saw the likes of Tom Fletcher, Jessica Gagen and Grace Webb all speaking to young people about their experiences with aviation. The RAF experience also returned centred around an Airbus A400M Atlas C1 to showcase modern service capabilities and life.\n\nHowever, it is a gathering of aircraft for the static and flying displays that are the key attraction of the Air Tattoo. It is a tribute to the Air Tattoo’s global reputation over the last half century and the exception hard work of the Air Operations Team that the event still draws so many aircraft and even managed to attract yet another nation to participate. This year saw more themes than we can remember in recent and each was supported by really interesting aircraft in the static displays\n\n50th Anniversary of the F-16 Fighting Falcon\n\nIt seems incredible that the F-16 design is now 50 years old. It remains a very modern looking aircraft and one with great capability – so much so Lockheed Martin are still producing and delivering the most advanced variant – the F-16V. RIAT and the F-16 have a long history together with the Royal Norwegian Air Force presenting the first flying display by the type at Greenham Common’s IAT’81. Though F-16s appeared in the flying display in 2024, the focal point for the 50th anniversary was the ‘Viper Line’ in the static display. Planning for the anniversary started in 2022 and it was aided by support from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.\n\nIt attracted tremendous support from European operators and some from further afield. Particularly welcome were debuts of F-16AMs from the Romanian and Royal Jordanian Air Force. But perhaps the most eye-catching were the F-16Cs from the Royal Moroccan Air Force wearing their two-tone sand camouflage. The Hellenic Air Force also added some colour with some striking special tail markings applied after arrival.\n\nThe Royal Netherlands Air Force which is retiring its F-16s this year made a particularly impressive contribution with four aircraft from 312 Squadron flying in. They were joined by a further non-airworthy example supplied by Historical Fighters Volkel. This aircraft was brought into Fairford by road much earlier in the year (no mean feat considering it is subject to customs and import regulations) in preparation for the application of a special scheme honouring the 50th anniversary designed by Dynamic Vectors. A scheme inspired by the prototype colours had initially considered by was soon dropped as the airframe, J-616, will return to Volkel as a gate-guard in operational colours. The final scheme contained many ‘easter egg’s’ within it – the weapons pylons reflected all the nations that have used the F-16. The name of the YF-16’s first pilot, Phil Oestricher, was carried on the airframe as was Lieutenant General André Steur, the current commander of the Royal Netherlands Air Force as a thank you to their tremendous support with the product. Finally, the design also carried the silhouettes of both the F-16A and F-16V to represent the development of the fighter.\n\nDirector of Dynamic Vectors, Andy Donovan, said: “The Dynamic Vectors team is overjoyed to have delivered this project for the Royal International Air Tattoo. Several of our team are long-term volunteers at the show and believe in the incredible event it has matured into over the course of its own 50+ year history, so to be able to contribute to this aircraft has been wonderful.\n\n“When RIAT approached us and asked if we thought it possible, our unequivocal answer was “yes!” Two years later we are able to stand next to a birthday centrepiece which celebrates the most awesome of flying machines with a combat career that is second to none. We hope that this livery and the remarkable line-up of F-16s that RIAT has assembled gives great pride to all of those who have served on the aircraft over the last half-century. With Lockheed Martin continuing to build this most potent weapon system, there are many more who are yet to weave their own marks into its future and this celebration is as much about that as it is its achievements to date.”\n\nThough some aircraft did not make it to Fairford, the ‘Viper Line’ was very impressive and a highlight for many. It was to those of us lucky enough to attend IAT and RIAT in the 1990s, it was a welcome echo of the great single type line-up so often a feature of those classic events.\n\nThe Flying Displays\n\nThe flying displays got underway on Friday’s ‘preview’ day in glorious conditions. Opening the display were the RAF Falcons Parachute Display Team jumping from a 99 Squadron C-17A Globemaster III for the first time at a public air display. It was also the first time for many years the Falcons had taken part in RIAT which is strange considering they are the local RAF display team. Their display was also very well received by the crowd.\n\nThe Falcons were just one of the RAF Display team present at Fairford. The Red Arrows, who are celebrating their 60th display season in 2024, displayed across all three days of the event and featured in special flypasts on all three days with other flying display participants to mark various anniversaries. The Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 flown by Flt Lt David Turnball and the Boeing Chinook HC5 role demo from 18 Squadron joined the displays over the Saturday and Sunday.\n\nHowever, it was the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning from 207 Squadron that was the star of the RAF displays. 2024 has seen the introduction of the RAF F-35 Role Demo to the display circuit and while it is not a full aerobatic display, it gives a much better impression of the strike fighter raw power, capabilities and agility. The high alpha pass is well worth watching with the aircrafts tailplanes visibly making adjustments to keep the flight regime stable.\n\nThe Royal Navy also made a welcome return to the RIAT flying display with the Black Cats Helicopter Display Team flying a pair of Leonardo Wildcat HMA2s. Its been a difficult few years for the Royal Navy’s Wildcat force with a high tempo of operations and a lack of qualified crews which has meant the team have been absent from the display scene. They are back in force for 2024 however with duo and solo displays at many events during the summer. Their pairs display is particularly eye-catching with some dramatic crossing nose overs and the classic carousel. It was an award winning return for the team as they picked up The Steedman Display Sword for the British participant with the most notable contribution to the show.\n\nFriday’s display was very different to the weekend displays with some special one-off displays. Brazilian manufacturer Embraer presented a rare flying display by their KC-390 Millennium demonstrator highlighting the types short field abilities and agility.\n\nThe centrepiece to Friday’s display was a major flypast to mark the 70th Anniversary of NATO. This was headed by a RAF Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joint and featured a the Czech Air Force JAS-39 Gripen, French Air Force Dassault Mirage 2000-5F, Italian Air Force Panavia A-200A Tornado, NATO Boeing E-3A Sentry, German Air Force Eurofighter EF2000, Spanish Air Force SF-5M Freedom Fighter, Finnish Air Force BAe Hawk Mk.66, Belgian Air Force F-16BM Fighting Falcon, Hellenic Air Force F-16C Fighting Falcon, USAF F-16C Fighting Falcon, Turkish Air Force F-16C Fighting Falcon and Romanian Air Force F-16AM Fighting Falcon.\n\nHowever, Friday really belonged to the United States Air Force’s 99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron based at RAF Fairford with a pair of Lockheed U-2S aircraft. Those who arrived early saw a mission equipped aircraft launch on a mission. During the flying display however, their second aircraft gave the first U-2 flying display in the UK since Duxford’s 1993 September airshow. The aircraft performed several circuits of Fairford making some low approaches with the aid of the chase cars giving a noisy account of this fascinating aircraft. And if that was not enough, shortly after the end of the formal flying display, the mission equipped aircraft with it dorsal pod arrived back from its sortie – a rare occasion indeed to see a U-2 in such a configuration at a public event.\n\nThe German Army NH Industries NH90TTH display was another Friday only display, but only because it was unserviceable at the weekend. It was a shame because it is a great display and also because it was the only international helicopter display at RIAT this year.\n\nAs ever, the Air Tattoo attracted some of the world’s great national display teams. It was pleasing to see the return of the Royal Jordanian Falcons with their four Extra 330LX aircraft. In 2023 they lost both of their display slots due to poor weather making only one appearance in the flying programme during a very wet flypast marking the work of Flying Scholarships for the Disabled.\n\nAlso at the lighter end of the display team spectrum were the Yellow Sparrows team from the Royal Norwegian Air Force. This was their RIAT debut and it took some 20 hours of flying for the team of six SAAB MFI-15 Safaris to reach Fairford from their Bardufoss base in the Artic circle. The team presented a very elegant display of formation flying with their canary yellow aircraft standing out well in the Cotswold skies.\n\nAs well as the Tornado and F-16, the British Aerospace Hawk is marking its 50th Anniversary in 2024. As such it was good to see two international teams based on the type return to Fairford. The Royal Saudi Air Force’s Saudi Hawks returned for the second consecutive year with their striking formation display that includes some attractive smoke art which recreates their national symbol in the sky. They have also committed their long-term future to the Hawk this year with the announcement they will convert to the advanced Hawk Mk.165 over the next two years. They were joined by the Finnish Air Force’s Midnight Hawks which presented solo and four-ship displays across the weekend. Unusually though they brought their air arms Hawk Mk.66s to Fairford. These are ex-Swiss Air Force aircraft and the majority of them wear the classic Red, Silver and White training scheme wore by RAF trainers in 1980s. This did mean however they were without their usual wing-mounted smoke systems which made some of their display look a little strange. A more formal recognition of the Hawk 50th was made during Saturday’s display when the Red Arrows leader Sqn Ldr Jon Bond led a formation of five Hawks from the Saudi and Finnish teams together with a RAF Hawk T2 and a Qatari Hawk Mk.167 – a seldom seen chance to see a close formation of aircraft from five different air arms together.\n\nCompleting the national display team line-up were the Patrouille Suisse with their six Northrop F-5E Tiger IIs. Like the Red Arrow, Patrouille Suisse are marking a big Six-O this year, but is their full 60th anniversary. As ever their display combined speed with Swiss precision in their striking red and white fighters. The flying control committee clearly agreed awarding the team the King Hussein Memorial Sword for the Most Polished & Precise Flying Display. On Sunday, they joined the Red Arrows for a special 60th anniversary flypast together.\n\nAs ever, there was a huge variety of solo displays. If there was item that was overlooked by the awards, it was the Slovenian Pilatus PC-9M Hudournik. It has become something of a RIAT regular but its pilot really puts on the most incredible display of precision solo aerobatics.\n\nOne item that always pleases the crowd is the Spanish Navy McDonnell Douglas EAV-8B+ Harrier II. In RAF service it was always a show stopper and even in the hands of an overseas nation the British public still have great affection for the type. Lt Cdr Andres Medina Gonzalez Del Tanago put together a fine display of the aircraft with some high speed passes before an impressive hovering demonstration. He picked up The RAFCTE Trophy for best flying demonstration by an overseas participant.\n\nThe SAAB JAS-39C Gripen has become a popular performer at RIAT in the hands of various NATO air forces. This year’s edition saw rip-roaring displays from both the Swedish and Czech Air Forces.\n\nThough the focal point of the F-16 50th Anniversary was the static displays, two popular European displays highlighted the aircraft capabilities in the air. After several years absence, it was wonderful to see the Turkish Air Force’s F-16C ‘Soloturk’ display back at RIAT. The team are also popular with audiences with the team’s distinctive and stylish black, grey and gold jets supported by the enthusiastic commentary!\n\nThe Royal Danish Air Force had a somewhat tumultuous time supporting RIAT. On arrival, the F-16BM Fighting Falcon they brought for static display suffered a major fluid leak which complicated things for air traffic control and the ground handlers. Then following Friday’s display, the wonderfully painted display jet suffered a nosewheel steering malfunction that could not be rectified quickly. However, not to be defeated a third F-16AM Fighting Falcon arrived early on Saturday morning and incredibly was made ready for display later that day. This aircraft, E-190, turned out to an appropriate addition for the 50th anniversary as it an original Block 10 aircraft and one of the oldest F-16s still in service. For their persistence, Captain Troels ‘TEO’ Vang and his support crew were given an honourable mention at the post show awards ceremony which was very well deserved.\n\nThe German Air Force, the Luftwaffe, have been amongst the Air Tattoos best supporters for many years. Always present in the static display with multiple aircraft, there were also strong supporters of the flying display up until the early 2000s when their command became less keen solo displays. However recent years have seen the Luftwaffe make a concerted effort to return to international flying displays with a dedicated Eurofighter EF2000 solo display flown by ‘Noble.’ 2024 saw the RIAT debut of Noble’s display who gave a powerful account of Germany’s principal combat aircraft. Friday’s crowds were treated to the display flown in JG74’s NATO Tiger Meet aircraft, the Cyborg Tiger. The Luftwaffe also planned to send their full Airbus A400M display to RIAT from Lufttransportgeschwader 62 at Wunstorf. Sadly that crew were unable to attend RIAT but another crew did work up a simple routine which gave a glimpse of the performance of Europe’s main airlifter.\n\nThe Italian Air Force’s Reparto Sperimentale di Volo from Pratica di Mare are always popular popular participants in the RIAT flying programme. They sent all three of their displays to RIAT this year with the Leonardo T-346A Master, Eurofighter F-2000A Typhoon and Leonardo C-27J Spartan. The Spartan’s display have been developed even more this year and now features a loop, several rolls, derry turn and most dramatically – a half Cuban! Their amazing demonstration won them the Sir Douglas Bader Trophy for Best Individual Flying Display.\n\nThere were however two (well three) solo displays that really stood out from the rest for different reasons. The Boeing Company’s Advanced Eagle Demo made its world air display debut last year at the Dubai Airshow utilising the Qatari Emiri Air Force’s F-15QA Ababil. It was an incredible display to witness with the large multi-role fighter performing the tightest of displays in the Arabian skies ending with an incredible tailslide. For 2024, the Boeing test crews have developed the demonstration for both RIAT and Farnborough with two different displays – one in a clean configuration as in Dubai and another with an aircraft loaded with 12 AMRAAM missiles highlighting that the aircraft maintains care free handling and incredible agility whatever its load. Both routines were dramatic with the moist European skies adding some further spectacle with condensation flashing across the F-15s wings and vortices streaming from the wingtips. It clearly pleased the Friends of RIAT who voted the displays given by Jason Dotter, Matt Giese, Kevin Tinsley and Michael Quintini their best display of the event.\n\nThe impressive Royal Canadian Air Force contribution to RIAT continued in the flying display with the very welcome return of their CF-18 Demo Team from 425 Tactical Fighter Squadron. Capt Caleb “Tango” Rober is this year’s display pilot and flew his CF-188 Hornet through a very punchy display set to a specially commission medley of music covering the 100 years of the RCAF. The cherries on the top of Tango’s solo display were two very special flypasts. On the Friday, Tango joined up with the Red Arrows for a commemorative flypast which painted Red and White smoke across the Fairford skyline. For Saturday’s and Sunday’s display, Tango completed his display in company with the Fighter Collection’s Supermarine Spitfire LFVb piloted by Rolf Meum for some heritage flypasts. TFC’s Spitfire is a RCAF veteran having flown with 402 ‘City of Winnipeg’ Squadron from 1944 and has been fully restored in its original markings."
