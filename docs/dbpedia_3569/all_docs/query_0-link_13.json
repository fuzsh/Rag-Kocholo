        "text": "The 313th squadron was an NF-5 squadron before it received the venerable viper. It converted on the type in May of 1988. It was the first squadron to receive the brand-new F-16s of the Fokker production line which came from the last order of the Dutch. These where the first OCU airframes delivered to the RNlAF and where also the first to be equipped with the brake chute.\n\nWith the introduction on the F-16, the squadron lost its training task and therefore decided that another logo should be chosen. Because the Dutch had always been deprived in the past of membership of the famous NATO Tiger Association due to the simple fact that there was no tiger squadron, the unit decided - with government approval - to choose a tigers head as a mascot. This resulted in the hosting of the NATO Tiger Meet in 1992.\n\nFrom April 1st, 1994 onwards, the unit received a training task once more. F-16 pilots who had completed their training in the USA where 'customized' to the European airspace and procedures in the squadron. This is the so-called Tactical Qualification Training (TQT). Apart from that, the squadron also provided for the Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Experienced fighter pilots who had flown on other aircraft types for a certain amount of time, had to be re-qualified on the F-16. Besides this the squadron also initiated an F-16 refreshment course for non-active F-16 pilots. These training tasks where all handed over to 306 sqn in November of 2001, with 313 sqn becoming an active F-16 squadron once more.\n\nThe last change in the history of 313 sqn is the closure of Twenthe AB in 2005. The squadron was not disbanded but moved to nearby Volkel AB to form a third F-16 squadron on that base."
