        "text": "A little known fact is the important role RAF Cardington played in the rebuilding of the Dutch Air Force towards the end of the Second World War and in the years immediately after. In May 1940 following both an aerial and ground assault the Germans overran Holland destroying much of its air fleet in the process. Some of the pilots of the Dutch Royal Flying Corps and The Naval Air Service managed to escape to France and many arrived in England to form two Dutch squadrons within the RAF. By 1943 the Dutch Spitfire Squadron 322 manned entirely by Dutch personnel was formed in England.\n\nDutch military heads regrouped in London and began making plans to form a National Dutch Air Force when the war came to an end. In early 1945 Holland was slowly liberated and young Dutch volunteers were selected and sent over to the Recruitment Training Centre at Cardington for basic training. These young recruits spent almost 4 months at Cardington before moving on to other centres for specialised training.\n\nThe above information has been taken from a wonderful book written by Dutchman Peter J Huijskens (shown left) called “Cardington – A Pillar in the Development of the post war Royal Netherlands Air Force.” (shown left). Peter was one of the young men sent to Cardington for training after the war and has an obvious affection for Cardington. He went on to have a very successful career in the Royal Netherlands Air Force. His book has many first hand stories and photographs of some of the young recruits and their seniors who spent time at Cardington and the extraordinary routes some of them took to reach England during the war. I would love to show more photographs from Peter's book but I have been unable to contact him to seek permission to do so - but his book deserves wider recognition for the information he has presented and I hope he is happy to see his work recognised here.\n\nHank Helmink's story 1945\n\nI was very pleased to hear from another Dutch gentleman who found his way to the station in 1945. Here is his story:\n\n\"Hello Jane – here is my story\n\nEarly 1945 I left home, Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and ended up in Blankenberg Belgium. Here we got a ride in an L C T. There were 6 of us, it was a rough night. We landed in England in the morning, where I don’t know. Dry clothes and a warm breakfast was a good start. We were interrogated for two days. Next stop, Cardington, there I got my basic training. Then a transfer in to the Dutch Navy Airforce, more training in Dundee Scotland. Next a cruise to Shri Lanka then back to a Dutch 321 squadron in the R A F, to get in to Indonesia.\n\nTwo years in Soerabaja. Return to the Netherlands. Next trip on a maiden voyage on the Dutch aircraft carrier The Karel Doorman. After a couple of airforce stations in 1949 I got my discharge as a p/o aircraft man OVW. Next two years as a civil servant in the Navy Airforce before I emigrated to Canada and became a Canadian citizen.\"\n\nThank you Hank you certainly are well travelled!"
