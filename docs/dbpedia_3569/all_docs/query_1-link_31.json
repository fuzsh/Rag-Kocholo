        "text": "The Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF), Dutch Koninklijke Luchtmacht (KLu), is the military aviation branch of the Netherlands Armed Forces. Its ancestor, the Luchtvaartafdeling (aviation department) of the Dutch Army was founded on 1 July 1913, with four pilots. The aerobatic display team of the Royal Netherlands Air Force is the Solo Display Team.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n1.1 The beginning in 1913\n\n1.2 1914-1918 WWI\n\n1.3 Between the wars\n\n1.4 World War II and late 1940s\n\n1.5 The 1950s and 1960s\n\n1.6 New Guinea conflict\n\n1.7 The Cold War era, 1960s, 1970s and later\n\n1.8 Former Yugoslavia\n\n1.9 Operation Enduring Freedom and NATO in Afghanistan\n\n2 Structure of the Royal Netherlands Air Force\n\n2.1 Main Operating Bases (MOBs)\n\n2.2 Air Defense Group\n\n2.3 Tactical Air Operations Base\n\n2.4 Defence Helicopter Command\n\n2.5 Air Transport Base\n\n2.6 Common Support Base\n\n3 Miscellaneous units\n\n3.1 Closed/former air bases\n\n4 Rank structure\n\n5 Strength\n\n6 The future\n\n7 Replacement for the F-16\n\n8 See also\n\n9 References\n\n10 External links\n\nHistory\n\nThe beginning in 1913\n\nThe Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) is the second youngest operational part of the Dutch Armed Forces, which consists of four parts: Navy, Army, Air Force and Military Police.\n\nDutch air power started in July 1913 with the founding of the Army Aviation Group (Luchtvaartafdeeling or LVA) at Soesterberg airfield (vliegbasis Soesterberg). When founded, the Army Aviation Group operated one aircraft, the Brik, which was supplemented with three French Farman aircraft a few months later.\n\nThese aircraft were soon outdated and the Dutch government ordered several fighter/reconnaissance Nieuport and Caudron aircraft to replace them.\n\n1914-1918 WWI\n\nThe Netherlands maintained a neutral position during World War I and the Army Aviation Group did not take part in any action, instead developing the force's capabilities.\n\nPilot training was opened for ranks below officer, and technical, aerial photography, meteorological and navigation flights were established.\n\nNew airfields were established at Arnhem, Gilze-Rijen air base, Venlo and Vlissingen.\n\nBetween the wars\n\nAfter the end of World War I the Dutch government cut the defence budget and the Army Aviation Group was almost dissolved. As political tensions in Europe increased during the late 1930s the government tried to rebuild the armed forces again in 1938 but there were many problems, not least the shortage of pilot instructors, navigators and pilots to fly the new multiple engine aircraft. Lack of standardisation and resulting maintenance issues added to the complexity of the rebuilding task.\n\nWorld War II and late 1940s\n\nAs war loomed, in July 1939 the Army Aviation Group was renamed the Army Aviation Brigade (Luchtvaartbrigade).\n\nIn August 1939, the Netherlands government mobilised its armed forces, but due to limited budgets the Army Aviation Brigade operated only 176 combat aircraft of the following types:\n\n16 Fokker T.V type bombers\n\n36 Fokker D.XXI single-engine fighters\n\n35 Fokker G.I twin-engine fighters\n\n7 Fokker D.XVII single engine fighters\n\n17 Douglas DB-8A-3N light bombers\n\n20 Fokker C.X light bombers\n\n33 Fokker C.V reconnaissance aircraft\n\n20 Koolhoven FK-51 artillery observer aircraft\n\nIn May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands. Within five days the Dutch Army Aviation Brigade was taken out by the German Luftwaffe. All of the Brigade's bombers, along with 30 D.XXI and 17 G.I fighters were shot down; two D.XXI and eight G.I were destroyed on the ground. Two G.I were captured by German forces, one of which was later flown to England by a Fokker pilot. The Douglas bombers were used as fighters because no suitable bombs were available; these aircraft were poorly suited for this role and eight were shot down and three destroyed on the ground in the first hours of the conflict.\n\nIn spite of their numerical inferiority, the Dutch armed forces did enjoy success against the Luftwaffe, having 350 Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed, although many of these were lost to anti-aircraft fire and crashes at improvised landing fields in the Netherlands rather than due to action by Dutch fighters. The cost was high - almost 95% of the Dutch pilots were lost. In recognition of their actions Queen Wilhelmina granted the highest Dutch military decoration, the Militaire Willemsorde (MWO), to the Army Aviation Brigade collectively.\n\nSome aircrews escaped to England and on June 1, 1940, 320 Squadron and 321 Squadron were established there under RAF operational command. Due to a shortage of personnel, 321 Squadron was absorbed by 320 Sqn in January 1941. Although their personnel were predominantly from the Navy Air Service, Army Aviation aircrew also served with 320 Sqn until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1941, the Royal Netherlands Military Flying School was re-established, in the United States at Jackson Field (also known as Hawkins Field), Jackson, Mississippi, operating lend-lease aircraft and training all military aircrew for the Netherlands.\n\nThe separate Militaire Luchtvaart van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger (ML-KNIL; Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Military Air Service) continued in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI), until its occupation by Japan in 1942.[2][3] Some personnel escaped to Australia and Ceylon. 321 Squadron was re-formed in Ceylon, in March 1942, from Dutch aviators.\n\nIn 1942, 18 (NEI) Squadron, a joint Dutch-Australian unit was established, in Canberra, equipped with B-25 Mitchell bombers. It saw action in the New Guinea campaign and over the Dutch East Indies. In 1943, 120 (NEI) Squadron was established. Equipped with Kittyhawk fighters, it flew many missions under Australian command, including the recapturing of Dutch New Guinea.\n\nIn June 1943, a Dutch fighter squadron was established in England. 322 (Dutch) Squadron, equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire, saw action as part of the RAF. 322 Sqn aircraft featured the British RAF roundels as well as the Dutch orange triangle. 322 Sqn was successfully deployed against incoming V-1 flying bombs. From mid-1944, during the invasion of Normandy, it executed ground attack missions over France and Belgium.\n\nIn July 1944, the Directorate of Netherlands Airpower was established in London.\n\nIn 1947, its Chief of Air Force Staff was appointed.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s\n\nIn 1951 several non-combat functions in the Army Aviation were opened to women.\n\nOn the 27th of March 1953 the Royal Netherlands Air Force officially became part of the Dutch armed forces.\n\nThe Air Defense Command, (Commando Lucht Verdediging, abbreviated CLV) consisting of a command unit, five radar stations and six fighter squadrons, had been established. Its radar equipment as well as its air defense fighters all came from obsolete RAF stocks.\n\nThe Spitfire Mk.IX was used by 322 sqn until 1954, but was replaced as new squadrons were established.\n\nThe Gloster Meteor F Mk.IV was used by 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327 and 328 sqn from 1948-1957.\n\nThe Gloster Meteor F Mk.VIII was used by 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327 and 328 sqn between 1950-1959.\n\nAfter the Netherlands joined NATO another new command: Tactical Air Command (Commando Tactische Luchtstrijdkrachten, abbreviated CTL) was established.\n\nCTL consisted of seven new strike squadrons (306, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315 and 316 sqn), all equipped with Republic F-84G Thunderjet aircraft. These aircraft were supplied by the United States under the Mutual Defense Aid Program from 1952-1956.\n\n306, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326 and 327 Sqn operated the Hawker Hunter F Mk4 between 1956–1964, and the Hawker Hunter F Mk.6 between 1957-1968.\n\n700, 701 and 702 Sqn operated the F86 Sabre all-weather fighter between 1956–1964.\n\n306, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315 and 316 sqn changed aircraft configuration from 1955-1970 as the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash became available.\n\nNew Guinea conflict\n\nThe Indonesian government claimed New Guinea following the end of the second world war. The Dutch government considered the area Dutch territory. Negotiations over the country were conducted for years, but tensions grew until Indonesia broke diplomatic relations with the Netherlands at the end of the 1950s.\n\nIn response, in 1958, the Netherlands deployed military reinforcements to New Guinea, including an Air Force detachment for the air defense of the island Biak as there was evidence that Indonesia was infiltrating the island in advance of a military operation.\n\nThe first Air Force contribution was the installation of two MkIV early warning radars on Biak and neighbouring Woendi island.\n\nThe political situation between the Netherlands and Indonesia continued to deteriorate and in 1960 the Dutch government deployed reinforcements. The operations were known by name as ’Plan Fidelio’. For the Dutch Air Force this meant the establishment of an Air Defense Command for New Guinea (Commando Luchtverdediging Nederlands Nieuw-Guinea - CLV NNG) consisting of :\n\none Hawker Hunter Mk.4 air defence squadron;\n\na radar navigation system at Biak, and;\n\na reserve airstrip at Noemfoer.\n\nThe Dutch government deployed a squadron consisting of 12 Hawker Hunter Mk.4 AD fighters and two Alouette II SAR helicopters. They were transported to Southeast Asia by the Karel Doorman. One year later the Dutch government deployed another 12 Hawker Hunter Mk6 AD fighters; these aircraft carried more fuel and had a larger combat radius.\n\nIn August 1962 Indonesia was ready to attack New Guinea. Despite reinforcements the Dutch defences would be insufficient to withstand the coming attack. Therefore, and because of international political pressure the Dutch government was forced to agree to the peaceful surrender of New Guinea. Dutch forces were withdrawn from the territory.\n\nThe establishment of 336 transport squadron is closely connected to New Guinea. Soon after activation this unit was deployed to New Guinea to take over air transport from the Dutch Navy. 336 Sqn deployed and took over three Navy Dakotas and three US supplied aircraft. 336 Sqn operated from Mokmer airstrip and transported more than 5,400 passengers between September 1961 and September 1962.\n\nThe Cold War era, 1960s, 1970s and later\n\nDuring the cold war era Dutch Air Force units played an important part in the West European defence against the opposing Warsaw Pact forces. The Dutch Air Force manned five fully operational self supporting Missile Groups in West Germany (1 and 2 MslGrp were equipped with NIKE batteries, while 3,4 and 5 MslGrp were equipped with Hawk). Dutch fighters and other weapon systems also took a full part in NATO alert, standby duties and exercises through the years.\n\n306, 311, 312, 322 and 323 Sqn changed configuration again from 1962-1983 after the dual role F-104 Starfighter was introduced.\n\n313, 314, 315 and 316 Sqn switched over to the NF-5 Freedom Fighter from 1969-1992. The NF-5 was a CF-5 fighter development. Some of the features on the NF-5 were later used by Northrop on the F-5E/F Tiger II variant.\n\nFrom 1979 until now all remaining RNLAF squadrons (306, 311, 312, 313, 315, 322 and 323) use NATO's standard fighter-bomber: the multi role F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\nFormer Yugoslavia\n\nRNLAF F-16s participated in all operations over Yugoslavia from 1993 Deny Flight, including Deliberate Force in 1995 and ending with Operation Allied Force in 1999 from two bases in Italy. Initially from Villafranca AB in the north of Italy, later moving south to Amendola AB. During the operations over FRY RNLAF F-16s flew reconnaissance (306Sqn detachments from Volkel AB were in theatre throughout the operations), enforced the Bosnian no-fly zone, dropped bombs on Udbina AB (1994), successfully dropped an unguided bomb on a moving Serb tank during the fall of Srebrenica (1995), and took part in Deliberate Force later in the summer of 1995.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1997 Dutch GCI personnel, along with Canadian GCI controllers, provided many hundreds of hours of fighter control and surveillance as integrated members of USAF/ANG Air Control Squadrons. During the Kosovo crisis a RNLAF F-16AM (mid-life update) damaged [1] a Yugoslavian MiG-29 with an AMRAAM, but the force was more recognized for its high bombing accuracy. Allied Force was also the operational debut for the upgraded F-16AM. Besides the CAP mission, offensive bombing and photo reconnaissance missions were flown. KDC-10 tankers refuelled allied fighter over the Adriatic Sea, and C-130 Hercules transports flew daily sorties from Eindhoven AB to logistically support the operation. In total, RNLAF aircraft flew 1,194 sorties during operation Allied Force, which is about 7.5% of the total 37.000 sorties flown.\n\nOperation Enduring Freedom and NATO in Afghanistan\n\nIn October 2002 a tri-national detachment of 18 Dutch, Danish and Norwegian F-16 ground attack aircraft and one Dutch KDC-10 tanker deployed to Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan in support of ground forces in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The RNLAF returned to Manas AB in September 2004 with five F-16 and one KDC-10 in support of the presidential elections of Afghanistan. This time the aircraft flew under the NATO ISAF flag.\n\nIn February 2006 four Dutch F-16s were joined by four Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16s in a detachment known as the 1st Netherlands-Norwegian European Participating Forces Expeditionary Air Wing (1 NLD/NOR EEAW). This was a follow up of the participation with the Belgian Air Force.[2]\n\nAs part of the expanded NATO ISAF mission in southern Afghanistan in August 2006, the Royal Netherlands Air Force had six F-16 ground-attack aircraft, three CH-47D Chinook of 298 Sq stationed at Kandahar Airfield. Additionally, a detachement of five AH-64D Apache helicopters had been stationed of Tarin Kowt, Uruzgan province.\n\nOn August 31, 2006 a Royal Netherlands Air Force (Michael \"Sofac\" Donkervoort) pilot was killed when his plane crashed during a mission to support British ground troops in Helmand province.[3]\n\nStructure of the Royal Netherlands Air Force\n\nMain Operating Bases (MOBs)\n\nLeeuwarden Air Base\n\n322nd Squadron F-16\n\n323rd (TACTES) Squadron F-16 (TACTES = TACtical Training Evaluation Standardisation)\n\n920th Maintenance Squadron\n\n921st Logistics Squadron\n\n922nd Support Squadron\n\nVolkel Air Base\n\n311th Squadron F-16\n\n312th Squadron F-16\n\n313th Squadron F-16\n\n900th Maintenance Squadron\n\n901st Logistics Squadron\n\n640th Squadron\n\n601st Reserve Squadron\n\n703rd USAF Munition Support Sqn.\n\nAir Defense Group\n\nDe Peel Air Base Guided Weapon Group De Peel\n\n800 Squadron (Command and Control)\n\n802 Squadron MIM-104 Patriot\n\n803 Squadron MIM-104 Patriot\n\n650 Support Squadron\n\n602 Reserve Squadron (partial)\n\n951 Maintenance and Logistics Support Sqn.\n\nTactical Air Operations Base\n\nAir Operations Control Station Nieuw Milligen\n\n603rd Reserve Squadron\n\n711th Squadron (Control And Reporting Centre (CRC) and Military Air Traffic Control Centre (MilATCC))\n\n970th Support Squadron\n\nIn 2009 710 and 711 Sqn were merged into one Air Operations Sqn (711Sqn).

The NH90 helicopters will be stationed at Gilze-Rijen (8 NH-90 Naval Transport version and SAR) and De Kooy (12 NFH-90 anti-submarine warfare).\n\nThe Netherlands was the first country to sign up for the Production Sustainment and Follow On Development (PSFD) Phase of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft.[4]\n\nThrough the NATO Strategic Airlift Capability, the RNLAF has access to three C-17s.\n\nReplacement for the F-16\n\nThe Netherlands Air Force wants to replace its F-16 fleet in the next decade. Candidates for the replacement were the Dassault Rafale, Lockheed Martin's F-16 Block 52/60, the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Saab Gripen and Lockheed Martins F-35. In 2002 The Netherlands signed a MOU (Memoradum Of Understanding) to co-develop the F-35 as a 'Tier 2' Partner. That deal is worth around 800 million US dollars, advanced by the Dutch government on behalf of Dutch industries: After the demise of Fokker Aircraft, the government wanted to retain whatever aerospace industry it could.\n\nThe F-35 seemed to be the best replacement for the F-16. But Saab is now offering their latest aircraft, the Saab Gripen NG (Next Generation), to The Netherlands at a much lower price (including maintenance for its entire lifespan). The Netherlands did compare the Saab Gripen NG and the F-35 in early 2009 and the F-35 came out on top. Many sources and signs indicate that the F-35 will be the next fighter of the Royal Netherlands Air Force.[citation needed]\n\nIn early 2008, a decision was put before Parliament to buy two test aircraft for Dutch pilots to train in the US. But instead, in April 2009 it was decided to buy just one test aircraft and defer the final decision as to what to buy to 2011, after the elections. The new government announced plans to acquire the second test aircraft in April 2011 in order to remain with the test program, but a next government and Parliament will review the whole process again while opposition to the F-35 is growing ever stronger. Reasons for this are ever rising costs, uncertainty about the exact cost of the aircraft, slips in the schedule of delivery and thus uncertainty about delivery dates. Also, Dutch industries have been complaining about their offsets from the USA.[13]\n\nSee also\n\nNo. 322 Squadron RAF\n\nSolo Display Team\n\nRoyal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force\n\nReferences"
