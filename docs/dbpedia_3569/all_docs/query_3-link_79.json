        "text": "Rolls-Royce has become a leading industry supplier in the U.S. with a significant and growing presence. Today, more Rolls-Royce products are built in Indianapolis than anywhere else in the world. Approximately 4,000 employees work in Indianapolis in manufacturing, assembly, test, engineering and a variety of staff support roles.\n\nIndianapolis businesses includes: Defense, LibertyWorks, Civil Small & Medium Engines, Marine and Helicopters.\n\nWe recently completed a $600 million investment to modernize equipment and technology at our Indianapolis facilities. This marks Rolls-Royce’s single largest investment in the U.S. in 25 years.\n\nRolls-Royce Corporation\n\n450 S. Meridian Street\n\nIndianapolis, IN 46225-1103\n\nTel: +1 (317) 230-2000\n\nPascagoula is a fully integrated marine propeller and waterjet manufacturing facility. It is responsible for production of controllable pitch propeller blades and hub body castings, large fixed-pitch propellers, fairwater cones and waterjets for the U.S. Navy.\n\nFeaturing one of only two foundries in the country qualified to cast propellers for the U.S. Navy surface and submarine fleet, the facility also produces waterjet components for the U.S. Navy’s Freedom Class of Littoral Combat Ships.\n\nHaving joined the Rolls-Royce family in 1999 from the Bird Johnson company, the 80,000 sq ft facility has an impressive capacity. This includes three natural gas reverberatory furnaces, five electric induction furnaces and a 5-axis machining center with a 30-foot table for milling the largest propellers.\n\nRun by a highly skilled workforce of foundry technicians, machinists, finishers, welders, inspectors and manufacturing engineers, the facility provides critical support to the U.S. Navy.\n\nWith 95% of the commissioned U.S. Navy surface fleet equipped with Rolls-Royce propellers we can truly say that our Pascagoula facility is providing the power that matters to our customer.\n\nMTU America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Germany’s Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG. In the US, MTU America has major facilities in Novi, Michigan (regional headquarters); manufacturing operations in Aiken, South Carolina; MTU Onsite Energy in Mankato, Minnesota; and training, distribution and services centers throughout North America.\n\nUnder the MTU brand, Rolls-Royce Power Systems markets large high-speed engines and propulsion systems for ships, for heavy land, rail and defense vehicles, and for the oil and gas industry. The product portfolio for distributed energy systems, which are marketed under the MTU Onsite Energy brand, includes diesel gensets for emergency, base load and peak load applications, in addition to cogeneration plants for the generation of combined heat and power based on gas engines and/or gas turbines.\n\nFor more information please see our MTU America website:\n\nwww.mtu-solutions.com\n\nRolls-Royce Defence provides power and propulsion systems for Naval and Coast Guard applications across the globe. In Walpole Massachusetts, our 130 employees have a unique capability, delivering key ship propulsor systems including Controllable-Pitch Propellers (CPP), Fixed-Pitch Propellers and Waterjets.\n\nOur talented team in Walpole have been responsible for the manufacture, assembly and test of world-class equipment for more than 50 years. From design and development through aftermarket support and product servicing we provide the power that matters for our customers across a broad range of applications.\n\nWe support navies worldwide, including our largest customer, the US Navy. With our product and service offerings found on over 95% of the US Navy’s surface warfare fleet we provide fleet maintenance and field service support to a wide range of platforms. This includes Frigates, Destroyers, Aircraft Carriers, Amphibious ships, Combatants, Fleet Support and Auxiliary Ships as well as US Coast Guard Cutters.\n\nOur leading technologies ensure the products we provide meet stringent US Navy military specification requirements, something that very few organizations can do. Looking to the future, we are excited by the prospect of developing and delivering propulsion systems for the next generation of Naval vessels including unmanned autonomous ships.\n\nIn 2019, we announced a $7.7 million investment project in Walpole to create new manufacturing, repair and test capability in support of US Navy programs. Upon completion of the new 24,000 square foot facility, expected in late 2020, Rolls-Royce’s flagship Naval Defense facility will add water jet maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) servicing to its portfolio of world-class capabilities.\n\nPeterborough, Ontario is home to the Rolls-Royce Canada Naval Handling Centre of Excellence. Our cross functional team support Defence customers around the globe, including: Australia, Canada, Israel. Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Singapore, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nFrom cable handling equipment to launch and recovery systems to undersea sensors and systems, we design and deliver worldclass products and services that meet the needs of Navies worldwide.\n\nExamples of our capability in service today include the MultiFunction Towed Array (MFTA) Sonar Handling System for the US Navy’s DDG 1000 Zumwalt-Class Destroyer and the OK-410 MFTA Handling System for the US Navy’s DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-Class Guided Missile Destroyer. Looking to the future our team is designing and developing the unique Mission Bay Handling System for the UK Royal Navy’s Type 26 Global Combat Ship; a key growth opportunity for Defence."
