        "text": "Volkel Air Base is the home of the Royal Netherlands Air Force 1st Fighter Wing. The active duty personnel consist of 24 different Air Force Specialties through the 703rd Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS). At this Geographically Separated Unit (GSU), there is a team of highly skilled IDMT’s ready to serve their mission.\n\nOne of our steadfast IDMT’s, Staff Sergeant Juan Rodriguez, gives us an insight on his life at Volkel AB and guidance for IDMT’s who will be serving in a GSU role.\n\nTell me a little about yourself and your Air Force career?\n\nI joined the Air Force right after high school at the age of 18. Like most other people, I had a turbulent tech school before finally becoming a medic. After working as a 4N for 4 years, I retrained into the IDMT career mainly because I deployed with one. His skills and mindset opened my eyes to the IDMT field, so I decided to go to training because it fell in alignment with what I wanted to do. After the tough training, it’s turning out to be what I expected and I am loving the job so far!\n\nWhat is your mission at your GSU?\n\nWe are a MUNSS unit. As an IDMT, I ensure our members either stay in PRP/AUOF status or have them take a knee if they need to. We are imbedded with the squadron to ensure they get the best care possible when they need it. This is probably the best way to work in the fullest capacity as an IDMT since we make sure every part of the base is as 100% functional as possible.\n\nWhat is your day-to-day life like for an IDMT at Volkel AB?\n\nOur typical day involves patient care. We see patients for any reason you can think of, and make sure they can get the most of their care from a remote site. Aside from that, we fulfill the role of a public health official given the current situation to make sure our members are as safe as possible. We make sure the mission keeps going!\n\nWhat is your favorite part about being stationed at a GSU?\n\nIn all honesty, my favorite part is being out of the Medical Group and working as a SME imbedded within the squadron. Being here lets me know my guys better in order to be a better provider for them. Working for a GSU has opened my eyes to all the other different careers the Air Force has to offer and how different their mission is from a medical squadron.\n\nWhat would you tell an IDMT who is about to go to a GSU?\n\nThe most important advice I have for an IDMT leaving for a GSU is: Stay humble and be hungry to learn. Working at a GSU has taught me so much about the job that I never would’ve realized before. Volkel AB has to be one of the luckiest locations you can be stationed as an IDMT.\n\n."
