This page contains an alphabetic listing by last name of all known students from Paseo High School from 1926 through 1990. Most of the names in the list came from the senior pictures in a Paseo yearbook, The Paseon. In the alphabetic listing, the number at the end of each name represents their Class Year. If you see an omission or mistake, please let us know.

To quickly locate a student on the alphabetic by last name list, click on a blue letter below for the student's last name and you will be taken to the first student with a last name that begins with that letter, e.g. if you click on a "K" the screen will take you to Kabrick, Arthur 52. Scroll down in the Ks until you locate the name of the student for which you are searching.

Or there is a much faster way to locate a particular name:

Hold down the Control key (Ctrl) on a PC, Command on a Mac, plus the letter F . This brings up a box at the top right of the screen. Type in the first four or five letters of the last name for which you are searching and you will be taken right to the name possibilities. To the right of the name possibilities is an up and down arrow. Click on an arrow to help you cycle more quickly through the name possibilities. This process is a lot faster than scrolling.

Try it, you'll like it.
