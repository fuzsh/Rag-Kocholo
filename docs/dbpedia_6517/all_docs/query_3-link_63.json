        "text": "The St. Mary’s baseball team was among the best in the LHSAA’s Class A this spring, and that was reflected when the Louisiana Sports Writers Association announced its All-State team on Saturday.\n\nSenior pitcher and first baseman Patrick Vienne, the District 3-1A Most Valuable Player, and freshman outfielder Ethan Busby were first-team All-State selections.\n\nThree Tiger infielders received honorable mention All-State recognition: junior Graeme Fidelak, at shortstop, and two freshmen, Nathan Slaughter (third base), and Payne Williams (a first baseman and pitcher).\n\nThe LSWA has picked all-state teams since 1958. Sports media representing regions around the state collect nominations of first-team all-district players from coaches, and meet electronically after the season to select the teams.\n\nThe Louisiana Baseball Coaches Association named Vienne, Fidelak and Williams to its Class A All-State team announced last week. Only dues-paying members of the LBCA may nominate.\n\nVienne, signed to play at national junior college champion LSU-Eunice, was 9-2 on the mound with a 2.78 earned run average while striking out 106 hitters in 61 1/3 innings. As a hitter, he batted .474 with 14 doubles, three triples and nine home runs.\n\nThe senior was selected to play in the LBCA All-Star Game, which included Class of 2021 players from teams in all classifications.\n\nBusby batted .379 and was an excellent defender for the Tigers.\n\nThe Tigers finished 29-8, with a non-district resume that included wins over Class 4A St. Thomas More and Franklin Parish, a series win at another 4A toughie, Northwood of Shreveport, a triumph over 3A Westlake, and a win over 2A Many. St. Mary’s posted run-rule victories over every district opponent.\n\nSt. Mary’s earned the fourth seed in the Division IV playoffs and came within one inning of advancing through the quarterfinals to the state tournament, after Catholic-Pointe Coupee pushed across the decisive runs in the seventh and final inning of the third game in the quarterfinal playoff series last month.\n\nPHOTO: St. Mary’s logo\n\nFebruary 10, 1941 – June 02, 2021\n\nTony A. Lodrigue, age 80, passed away peacefully and surrounded by family on Wednesday, June 2, 2021 at his residence in Lafayette, LA. Funeral services to honor his life will be held at 2:00 PM on Tuesday, June 8, 2021 at Blanchard-St. Denis Funeral Home, with Deacon John Whitehead officiating. Visitation will be observed on Tuesday from 11:00 AM until time of service. Burial will follow at Emmanuel Cemetery near Chopin, LA.\n\nHe was born on February 10, 1941 to John Levy Lodrigue, Sr. and Lucille Chaisson Lodrigue in Cloutierville, LA. Tony proudly served in the U.S. Army and was stationed at Fort Richardson, Alaska. Later, he began his career in law enforcement with the Natchitoches City Police Department and retired as a Lieutenant after 35 years of service. For many years he was regularly seen directing traffic at the Front Street and Church Street Bridge intersection. Tony also enjoyed being the escort for Mayor Joe Sampite and Grand Marshals of the Natchitoches Christmas Festival. After his retirement, he continued serving the community with the City Marshal’s Office for another 17 years. Over his life he enjoyed hunting, fishing, and playing softball and basketball. Friends and family will remember his life of service, hard-work, dedication, and generosity.\n\nTony was preceded in death by his parents, sisters, Lavane Rachal and Rita Hernandez, and brother, John Levy Lodrigue, Jr.\n\nHe is survived by the love of his life and long-time partner, Doris LaCour Heil; sons, Timothy Lodrigue of Natchitoches, LA; John (Judy) Heil of Lafayette, LA; and Allen (Elizabeth) Heil of Cave Creek, AZ; sisters, Romona Roundtree and Gayle Hodges; grandchildren, Allison (David) Sims, Brett (Grace) Heil, Madison (Taylor) Chugden, McKenna Heil, Erin Powell, and Hayden Powell. Tony cherished and loved spending time with his great grandchildren, John-David Sims, Jack Sims, Elise Sims, Maxime Heil, Georgia Heil, and John William Heil.\n\nThose honored to serve as pallbearers will be Keith Thompson, Richard Robertson, Mickey Dove, Randy Williams, Carey Hargrave and Roy Lee. Honorary pallbearers are all members of the Natchitoches Police Department and Natchitoches City Marshal’s Office.\n\nSpecial thanks to Traditions Hospice of Lafayette for their professional and compassionate care of our beloved Tony.\n\nThe James Oliphant Memorial Golf Tournament is a little more than a decade old, and thanks to the generosity of its latest group of golfers, it helped its namesake scholarship reach a new donation level.\n\nMore than 70 golfers gathered at Northwestern Hills Golf Course this past month for the 12th annual Oliphant tournament, raising $5,000 for the endowed football scholarship named for Oliphant, the father of Demons Unlimited Foundation Board member and Northwestern State alumnae Nicole Gray.\n\nA Northwestern State alumnus, Oliphant was a beloved basketball, track and field and football coach in Natchitoches Parish. He retired because of health complications from ALS before his death Oct. 19, 1988.\n\nTwenty years later, Gray honored her father’s legacy by establishing the James L. Oliphant Scholarship, which is one of 25 endowed NSU athletic scholarships of at least $20,000. The Oliphant golf tournament followed with Gray building the event with help from her uncle, Odell Oliphant, and cousin, J.D. Oliphant.\n\n“My father loved his students and many revered him as a father figure,” Gray said. “I believe he is continuing to fulfill his purpose on earth of helping young men become their best selves and fulfilling their dreams of obtaining higher education.”\n\nGray attributes much of the tournament’s success to the sponsors who help to defray the costs of hosting the annual event. From title sponsor International Paper – Red River Mill to contributions from local businesses and organizations, including Howard Conday Law Firm, Winterhaven Professional Counseling, Sharplin Hotels, Bank of Montgomery, Complete Title Services, Ben Johnson Educational Center, the NSU Foundation, Eagle Distributing, Fishers Sports and Music, and Legacy Café, the tournament has become a staple of the spring in Natchitoches.\n\nAdded Gray: “I’m so grateful for the outpouring of community support and all of the players who show up every year to help us raise money for this scholarship. We couldn’t do this without the support of these sponsors.”\n\nThe Demons Unlimited Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity supporting NSU Athletics through scholarship funding for all 14 sports, facility enhancement, student-athlete recruiting efforts and coach retention performance bonuses among other methods.\n\n“We are so appreciative of Nicole and her dedication to enhancing the Demons Unlimited Foundation endowment through the funding of the Oliphant Scholarship,” said Deputy Athletic Director Dr. Haley Taitano. “Our goal is to grow our endowment to $5 million, which would enable us to sustain much needed financial support of our student-athletes for generations to come.”\n\nTo donate to the Oliphant Scholarship or the Demons Unlimited Foundation, contact Taitano at 318-357-4278.\n\nPictured: Deputy Athletic Director Dr. Haley Taitano, Nicole Gray and Director of Athletics Greg Burke celebrate the latest donation to the James L.

In fact, he could probably describe summer by what it was not before he could tell you what summer is. Summer is not practice, homework and school projects. It is kickball games in the front yard, cannonballs into the pool and sno-cone syrup dripping down your chin.\n\n​I think there is an unspoken consensus among children that the boundless anticipation of this season is sacred. I’m sure even as an adult if you were asked to describe summertime your mind would immediately go back to a carefree time of life. Maybe summer for you is the feel of your bare feet in a creek bed or catching fireflies in a jar. Maybe its hours spent shelling peas or lemonade on the front porch. Summer is a season of freedom.\n\n​Freedom is a tricky thing though. Just this week we remembered all the men and women who have lost their lives for our freedom. Each year we kick off our season of freedom by remembering those who made the ultimate sacrifice so we can be free every day. Freedom is a heavy load in light of Memorial Day.\n\n​You may think of recklessness when you hear the word freedom. Maybe even rebellion. Freedom could have a negative connotation in your mind or be something you think is completely out of your grasp.\n\n​I would argue that true freedom comes only from knowing Christ. John 8:36 tells us, “So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.” Free indeed. True freedom doesn’t begin only when the bell rings on the last day of school and it doesn’t end when the leaves begin to change in the fall. True freedom comes from Christ who sets us free, free from sin and free from bondage. Free to live the life he has for us. Free to enjoy those carefree days of summer.\n\nStudents from Northwestern State’s Department of New Media, Journalism and Communication Arts have won five 2021 Telly Awards for a newscast and an awards show.\n\nThe Dec. 3, 2020 newscast won a Silver Telly Award in the General – Local TV category and two Bronze Tellys in the categories of General – Educational Institution and General Student. The JaM (Journalism and Media) Awards were honored in the categories of Online-General Education Institution and Online – General Education. The JaM Awards were an awards show for high school journalism students done instead of the annual Journalism and Media Day.\n\nNSU won a Bronze Telly Award last year.\n\nThe Telly Awards is an international broadcast organization whose mission is to showcase, “… the best work created within television and across video, for all screens. Receiving over 12,000 entries from all 50 states and 5 continents.” Production organizations such as Disney, Netflix and major broadcasters from across the world enter work for judging in this annual, peer-reviewed competition.\n\nThe NSU News Service Newscast was awarded in a professional, not student, category. The newscast was judged against professional standards of multimedia excellence. NSU newscasts qualify for the award since they are aired on NSU-TV, channel 22 on Suddenlink Cable. The station is run under the direction of NSU-TV Chief Engineer/Director David Antilley.\n\nAccording to Assistant Professor New Media, Journalism and Communication Arts Dr. Nick Taylor, the Newscasts produced during the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters were written, organized and produced as class projects/assignments in Communications 3430 (news producing). Graphics and other production elements are created as assignments in Communication 4470 (TV producing and directing). The NSU News Service, which is housed in the department, creates the news packages. Select stories are contributed from students in Communication 3480 (Video Production II.)\n\n“This approach allows students with a variety of talents/interests from across the department to participate in developing broadcast/multimedia news to professional standards,” said Taylor, who is faculty advisor for the newscasts. “I can’t express how proud I am of this crew. I would see them covering stories on weekends or late nights, then write or edit until 3 a.m., not going home until all story elements were completed to a professional level. Our students have a ton of talent and skill. But where they stand head-and-shoulders above students from other universities is, their loyalty to each other, dedication to professional news standards and never-quit spirit. This is a group of students with bright futures.”\n\nHannah Angel of Natchitoches and Sharissa Tanner of Lebeau were anchors for the newscast. Brianna Corley of Olla and Trinity Velazquez of New Orleans were lead producers. Sydney Bulot of Anchorage, Alaska, and Kori Levingston of Grand Prairie, Texas, were story producers. James Stanfield of Natchitoches was reporter, Madelyn Dupont of Washington was lead editor. Brian Gabrial was interim chair of the Department of New Media, Journalism and Communication Arts. Melody Gilbert was instructor for Communications 3480.\n\n“When hard work is rewarded it motivates you to continue moving towards improving even more,” said Corley. “Being honored with a Telly Award has made me, in the same way I’m sure it has done for my peers, excited to begin trying to create an even better piece of work to put into the world. Working collaboratively with a team, meeting strict deadlines and being expected to create a product that matched industry standards has helped me grow and prepared me for what to expect in the work force.”\n\nFor the JaM Awards, Gabrial was executive producer and Taylor was producer with Antilley as director/editor. Nadia Johnson was graphics lead and show host with graphic creation by Ethan Lachney of Tioga. Bulot was a segment producer and host with Angell serving as a segment producer and host. Graphic design was by Morgan Etheredge of Campti and videography by Jaci Jones of New Iberia, James Stanford of Natchitoches and Velazquez. Colie Plaster of Benton was a show host. Gilbert was the alumni segment producer.\n\nCAMPTI, LOUISIANA – Lakeview Jr./Sr. High School will receive $5,000 in special funding to\n\nupdate and expand their ProStart program thanks to The Rachael Foundation (RRF). Through the Rachael Ray Foundation ProStart Grow Grants, the National Restaurant\n\nAssociation Educational Foundation (NRAEF) will provide 27 grants, totaling $135,000 to ProStart schools that have demonstrated a strong need to engage and educate high school students interested in exploring restaurant and foodservice jobs and careers. Lakeview was selected as one of the 27 schools to receive the $5,000 in funding for the initiative.\n\nProStart, a two-year career and technical education program focused on culinary arts and\n\nrestaurant management, is offered in 1,700 schools across the country and currently enrolls 130,000 students. This year, ProStart educators have largely adapted to the COVID-19 restrictions with a mix of virtual and in-person learning, posing challenges for students to learn the hands-on skills the program often requires. Funding from the RRF ProStart Grow Grants will enable Lakeview to further their culinary arts programs and further their students’ education.\n\n“ProStart educators and students have persevered through this difficult year and are continuing to pursue their passions for restaurants and foodservice against all odds,” said Rachael Ray, award-winning television personality and philanthropist. “The Rachael Ray Foundation is proud to support their dreams to become future chefs and restauranteurs and provide them with the resources they need to be successful in their classrooms. We can’t wait to see what these students will accomplish.”\n\nWinning schools awarded a ProStart Grow Grant were required to demonstrate how the program is positively impacting their students and community. Grants are valued at $5,000 per school. Lakeview Jr./Sr. High School will be able to use their funds from the Rachael Ray Foundation starting this year.\n\nNorthwestern State University Professor of Flute and Coordinator of Graduate Studies in Music Dr. Dennette Derby McDermott was recently asked to co-author an article in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. This 29-volume music encyclopedia is the largest and most respected reference work for the subject of music in the world. Each article is written by a recognized scholar in their area of research, and every entry is reviewed by a board and subject to approval.\n\nThe New Grove Dictionary was originally published in 1878, the last printed edition was published in 2001, and is now available online by subscription. The article that McDermott co-authored is a result of over 20 years of research on the neglected 18th Century Czech composer, Jiri Čart (Georg Zarth).\n\nMcDermott’s research began in 1997 when a Czech professor at the Janáček Academy of Music, Arnošt Bourek, gave her manuscript copies of Čart’s unpublished flute sonatas. She conducted a sort of, “treasure hunt” for more original 18th-century manuscript copies by this composer held by libraries in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and Sweden. This involved writing to each library and requesting a copy which was available in either paper or electronic format.\n\nIn 2010, she traveled to The Royal Library in Copenhagen, and not only saw original manuscripts, but was also able to identify two of the composer’s works which were labeled as “Anonymous.” This research yielded important updates on Čart to RISM (Repertoire International des Sources Musicales), a worldwide library reporting system of musical manuscripts and early editions.\n\nIn 2016, McDermott organized and published the first “Thematic Index” of this composer’s works. These works are mainly sonatas and concerti for flute or violin. Jiri Čart was a Bohemian flutist and violinist who worked at the courts of Dresden, Berlin and Mannheim. The various spellings of his name in various languages (Czard, Czarth, Qchart, Schart, Szarth, Tzarth, and Zardt, to name a few) may have contributed to him being somewhat forgotten.\n\nMcDermott is the 2021 recipient of the Magale Endowed Professorship, which will be used to record several of these flute sonatas on replica period instruments.\n\nIn the past six years, she has learned to play the one-keyed, 18th-century wooden flute in order to have a better understanding of this composer’s music. Her studies on this period instrument has led to instruction with some of the world’s leading baroque flutists and scholars, such as Bartold Kuijken, Wilbert Hazelzet, Claire Guimond, Jed Wentz and Janet See. She also recently uploaded some of these manuscripts to IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project) and hopes to soon add a recording so Čart may receive the appreciation that he deserves.\n\nMcDermott has taught at Northwestern State since 1990.
