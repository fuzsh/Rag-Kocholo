        "text": "November 2023\n\nMigration, Modernity and Transnationalism in the Work of Joseph Conrad, ed. by Kim Salmons and Tania Zulli, London: Bloomsbury, 2021. Hardback: £90.00. ISBN 9781350168923\n\nExile as a Continuum in Joseph Conrad's Fiction: Living in Translation, Ludmilla Voitkovska, Abingdon and New York: Routledge, 2022. Hardback: £97.50. ISBN 9781032258768\n\nReviewed by Ola Sidorkiewicz, University of Oxford\n\nExile as a Continuum in Joseph Conrad's Fiction: Living in Translation by Ludmilla Voitkovska, 2022\n\nThe transnational turn in the study of Joseph Conrad can be traced back to an issue of Studia Neophilologica titled Transnational Conrad (2013), which brought together leading scholars to reflect on the diverse forms that transnational relations took in Conrad’s life and work. Migration, Modernity and Transnationalism in the Work of Joseph Conrad (Bloomsbury, 2021), edited by Kim Salmons and Tania Zulli, and Ludmilla Voitkovska’s Exile as a Continuum in Joseph Conrad’s Fiction: Living in Translation (Routledge, 2022) both contribute to the study of the transnational Conrad, drawing upon his migratory experiences to illuminate his engagement with and representation of national, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic variety in his fiction. By considering migration as Conrad’s foundational experience, both publications read his works outside of the constructed boundaries of national literature, be it English, Polish, or even ‘European’, and show their potential to capture and comment on transnational concerns. Of the two works, the former does not further any single overarching argument and relies more on what ‘each contributor has perceived and expressed [as] their own interpretation of migration and transnationalism’ (Salmons and Zulli 2). The latter, on the other hand, argues for a connection between Conrad’s ‘exilic condition and his choice of literary form and thematic patterns’ (Voitkovska 1). While interested in similar phenomena, the two publications are radically different, and their comparative analysis shows us the promises and the limits of reading Conrad’s fiction through the lens of migration and transnationalism.\n\nThe strength of Migration (2021) lies in highlighting the difference that can be generated by migration and transnationalism as critical frameworks. The volume does not offer a coherent narrative of or conclusion to what the two concepts might accomplish when faced with Conrad’s fiction. Read together, all the contributions draw attention to the complexity of his work, and, perhaps most crucially, its relevance to the contemporary experiences of dislocation and globalisation, opening new avenues for inquiry into an oeuvre as renowned and debated as that of Conrad. Divided into three parts, ‘Crossing borders’, ‘Empire, movement, and migration’, and ‘Modernity and the transnational’, the contributions are grouped thematically, but retain their individual methodologies, entering into productive dialogue with each other.\n\nIn the first section, Robert Hampson and William Atkinson focus on the subject of rites. Atkinson argues that a rite of entry does not necessarily turn into a rite of passage and can instead place the subject in a liminal space, instead of integrating them into a new cultural milieu. Throughout the essay, he employs the term ‘ukraine’ to denote that space, Atkinson’s neologism in English inspired by the word’s disputed etymology and its alleged meaning—‘undefined borderland’. Despite Atkinson’s perceptive analysis of Conrad’s works, his decision to employ the term ‘ukraine’ instead of ‘borderland’ verges on exoticism, reducing Poland and Ukraine to metaphors, and does not strengthen his overall argument. Richard Capoferro’s concluding essay in the section provides a useful postscript to the discussion of cross-cultural identity, arguing that Conrad’s Personal Record (1912) allows him to present himself as a ‘writer who brings transnational concerns to an English audience’, and his fiction as a ‘tool to establish an emotional and intellectual bond between worlds’ (74).\n\nMigration, Modernity and Transnationalism in the Work of Joseph Conrad, ed. by Kim Salmons and Tania Zulli, 2021\n\nIn the second section, Salmons’ is a brilliant contribution to the study of alterity in Conrad’s fiction through the lens of food. Providing examples from Almayer’s Folly (1895) and The Secret Agent (1907), she argues that foods in Conrad’s fiction represent an opportunity for transnational engagement but can at the same time serve as ‘barriers to belonging’ (111). Equally engaging is the final essay in the section, exploring the limits of transnationalism through an analysis of Conrad’s ‘Malay fiction’. Andrew Francis provides a compelling reading of Almayer’s status as a ‘settled resident’, arguing that the very nature of the status recalls ‘the inevitable earlier place of residence of a migrant’ (145). The protagonist’s failure to ‘live transnationally’ (156) is evidenced by his houses in Sambir, styled after a European house and intended for European guests.\n\nThe final part of the volume opens with Katherine Isobel Baxter’s contribution which focuses on the question of mobility between East Asia and Middle East in Conrad’s fiction and argues that his depiction of characters of Arab origins ‘highlights the divergent forms of transnational colonial, non-colonial, and anti-colonial activity’ (163). This is followed by Yael Levin’s comparative reading of Conrad’s ‘Amy Foster’, Franz Kafka’s Amerika (1927), and Henryk Sienkiewicz’s After Bread (1880), teasing out the tensions at the heart of the modernist debate surrounding the construction of the modern subject. The three sections are followed by Chris Gogwilt’s important afterword to the volume’s discussion of migration and transnationalism in the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in June 2020. The author engages in a perceptive and nuanced reading of all the contributions, and poses the question of whether, and how, Black Lives matter for Conrad and his fiction by drawing attention to three selected figures, and especially James Wait from The Nigger of Narcissus (1897).\n\nIn Exile as a Continuum Voitkovska explores the ways in which Conrad’s experience of migration manifests in the formal and narrative structures across his novels, focusing on Lord Jim (1900), The Secret Agent (1907), Nostromo (1904), Under Western Eyes (1911), as well as the short story ‘The Secret Sharer’ (1910). The first chapter develops the theoretical framework of her book, drawing upon a selection of works on migration, such as Joseph Brodsky’ writings, Viney Kirpal’s The Third World Novel of Expatriation (1989), as well as Edward Said’s Out of Place (2000) and Reflections on Exile and Other Essays (2000). This is complemented by a discussion of Conrad’s complex cultural background, as evidenced by Gustav Morf in his Polish Shades and Ghosts of Joseph Conrad (1976). What is immediately noticeable about these works, forming the vast majority of the author’s theoretical corpus, are their distant publication dates. In fact, the bibliography of the book indicates that the most recent publications cited by Voitkovska come from 2001 (Homi Bhabha and Leigh Gilmore). This is an unusual choice for a book published in 2022, given that the past two decades have witnessed a significant growth in studies of migration and transnationalism.\n\nThe reason for Voitkovska’s choice to frame her argument without reference to recent scholarship is not articulated clearly in the book and therefore presents some shortcomings. The author lists political unrest as the major reason for Eastern European migration to the West. Whereas this was true until the early 1990s, contemporary emigration is prompted predominantly by economic factors. Moreover, in arguing that the experience of migration is ‘of course, more acutely felt by men, given women’s habituation, whatever the paradigm, to second-class status’ (3), Voitkovska disregards intersectional scholarship on gender and migration (Donato and Gabaccia 2015; Zaborowska 1995). Voitkovska often refers to the alleged colonisation of Polish lands by Russia in the nineteenth century without acknowledging the complexity of the issue as evidenced by scholars of postcolonialism (Kołodziejczyk 2010; Skórczewski 2013). Finally, the author is highly selective in her use of scholarship relating to the reception of Conrad in Poland, which gained momentum in the past two decades (Adamowicz-Pośpiech 2022; Zabierowski 2008). The introductory chapter concludes with a set of ‘generic patterns’ to which ‘Conrad, or, in fact, any other expatriate cross-cultural liminal author, adheres to reflexively’ (27). This is a bold statement, which is not backed sufficiently with evidence given the variety of contemporary migratory experiences. Much of Voitkovska’s argument presumes that a migrant will not maintain any significant relation with their home country, which, more often than not, is no longer the case.\n\nIn the following chapters, Voitkovska illustrates her argument through close readings of Conrad’s works. While generally convincing, they are not situated against existing scholarship on Conrad (with the exception of a few footnotes), which renders it difficult for the reader to comprehend the extent of her contribution or the originality of her line of argumentation. Lord Jim, explored in chapters 2 and 7, is presented in the former as Conrad’s reckoning with his choice to emigrate, as well as with the trauma that this decision generated, and in the latter as his exploration of the relationship between the émigré author and their varied readerships through the motif of homecoming. The Secret Agent is discussed in Chapter 3 in relation to Victor Turner’s concept of liminality, shedding light on Conrad’s representation of people and places in his novel. In Chapter 4, Nostromo becomes a springboard for Voitkovska to probe the relationship between the writer and their native culture, once again focusing on the motif of homecoming. In Chapter 6, Under Western Eyes and Nostromo provide evidence for the author’s reading of romantic love in Conradian fiction as symbolic of the expatriate’s attitude towards their parent and adopted cultures. In Chapter 8, on the other hand, the former novel becomes the expression of Conrad’s anxiety regarding the reception of his works by his adopted reader. Finally, in Chapter 5, Conrad’s use of the doubles in his short story ‘The Secret Sharer’ is viewed by Voitkovska as a narrative tool to explore the relationship between the expatriate and their native culture. Voitkovska’s book lacks a conclusion, with her argument ending rather abruptly.\n\nWhile the close readings proposed by Voitkovska are compelling, they are somewhat repetitive and oscillate around a narrow understanding of the experience of migration. Voitkovska’s argument in the book does not develop at all, with every chapter restating the purpose of the book which is to show the impact of Conrad’s migratory experiences on his fiction. Unlike the contributors to Migration (2021), Voitkovska attempts to establish an authoritative voice on the impact of migration on Conrad’s fiction, concluding the debate rather than encouraging new insights. She proposes to read Conrad as a writer of exile rather than a Polish or English writer, but in a gesture that is similarly reductive, as it seeks to pinpoint one interpretative strategy. Voitkovska does not make full use of the potential that the frameworks of migration and transnationalism carry—instead of putting Conrad’s works in motion, she brings them to a standstill. However, a comparable focus on ‘constant movement, dislocation and instability’ as ‘conditio humana’ (51) in Conrad’s fiction maintained by Agnieszka Adamowicz-Pośpiech in her contribution to Migration (2021) serves as a reminder of the potential that this framework might generate, presenting Conrad as thoroughly shaped by migration, and his fiction as highly relevant to our contemporary era of mass movement.\n\nJune 2019\n\nStanley Cavell and Philosophy as Translation: The Truth is Translated, edited by Paul Standish and Naoko Saito. London and New York: Rowman & Littlefield International, 2017. £85.00. 9781786602893.\n\nReviewed by Georgina Edwards, University of Oxford\n\nStanley Cavell and Philosophy as Translation: The Truth is Translated, edited by Paul Standish and Naoko Saito (Rowman & Littlefield International, 2017)\n\nIn light of the passing of Stanley Cavell last year, this volume is a welcome celebration of the American philosopher’s work and enduring impact. Each of the eleven short chapters provides an original response to Cavell’s thought, revolving around the themes of translation, in the contexts of ordinary language philosophy and education. The book’s subtitle, ‘The Truth is Translated’, is an allusion to the following quotation by Thoreau, cited by Cavell in The Senses of Walden: ‘The volatile truth of our words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement. Their truth is translated: its literal monument alone remains’ (1). Thoreau’s words are used as a springboard by each of the authors responding to the theme of ‘philosophy as translation’ in this volume.\n\nStandish and Saito, in their introduction, warn that ‘philosophy as translation’ is ‘in danger of becoming a somewhat vague metaphor for transformation’ (2). Instead, we should see translation as ‘a metonym of our lives’ (2). Saito and Standish choose to focus on intralingual translation, which is ‘not simply a matter of linguistic conversion’, but rather ‘the movement of meaning within language more generally’ (2). The underestimation of interlingual translation is problematic; it is not ‘simply’ linguistic conversion. The complexity of interlingual translation and its importance for philosophy is unfortunately underrepresented in several of the volume’s essays, but this is raised as an issue by some authors (such as Claudia Ruithenberg in Chapter 9). Furthermore, the editors’ argument that they want to move their focus towards intralingual translation and away from ‘the ordinary sense of translation’ (2) seems potentially at odds with their interest in ‘ordinary human experience’ and their claim that intralingual translation is ‘internal to Cavell’s ordinary language philosophy’ (3).\n\nHowever, the editors do make a good case for the general importance of translation to philosophy, particularly to pragmatism and the philosophy of education. Translation is useful as it is a process that ‘exposes aspects of language that can easily be ignored’ (5). It cultivates ‘self-criticism and receptiveness of the imagination,’ because when translating ‘our words [are] always being tested in the eyes of others in the language community’ (6). Wouldn’t these qualities also be achieved (perhaps even better) by interlingual translation? It is unclear what is unique to the term that adds to philosophical discussion once the linguistic elements are downplayed.\n\nFor Saito, in the first chapter of the volume, translation is essentially ‘an incessant process of human’s reengagement with language’ (12). This reengagement means that ‘humans are always open to a new possibility of and hope for rebirth and conversion when they are undergoing crisis. Such moments of self-transcendence are crucial components in one’s understanding of other cultures’ (12). Saito writes engagingly about why translation is philosophically interesting, in that it prompts us to think about language, and therefore ourselves and our relationship to others. She advances on this by connecting Cavell’s ordinary language philosophy with translation. ‘Returning language back to the ordinary does not mean to replace philosophy’s language by mundane ordinary words;’ rather, Saito claims, it ‘means to find something uncommon in the common by being reengaged with language’ (13). Again, while these are important points, it is unclear why Saito would not agree that interlingual translation would achieve this reengagement just as well. The need to talk of translation as intralingual, and as a ‘metonym’ rather than a ‘metaphor’, seems to tend towards finding the central “essence” of our language and our lives, the essential part that can represent the whole. This need to find the essential gestures towards a metaphysical point of view, where translation could be the key to all philosophical problems. Saito makes the appealing but aggrandising claim that ‘philosophy as translation’ can show us how ‘the life of humans is always being translated, transformed, and transcended; our selves are always on the way, with the gap and chasm never to be filled’ (20). The equation of translation with the human condition strikes a chord, but once again further clarification is needed to explain why ‘translation’ should be used as opposed to ‘transformation’. By adhering adamantly to the idea of intralingual translation as a metonym of our experience of language, Saito is in danger of downplaying its linguistic features. Yet this is precisely why ‘translation’ has been chosen over other analogous terms for the title of this volume.\n\nThis point sadly does not always come across. There are some essays in the volume (such as Chapter 2, ‘Stanley Cavell, the Ordinary, and the Democratization of Culture(s)’ by Sandra Laugier) in which the inclusion of ‘translation’ seems almost tokenistic. While such chapters have their own merit as studies of ordinary language philosophy, it is not clear what ‘translation’ adds to this discourse. In the general philosophical explorations of intralingual translation (Chapters 7 and 8 by Sami Pihlström and Megan L. Laverty respectively), the volume misses an opportunity to discuss real intralingual issues which could also relate to education—such as dialects, loan words and academic literacy.\n\nThe most successful essays draw a connection between ‘untranslatability’ and education. The premise for this is Saito’s conception of translation as ‘reengagement’ with language, which is developed by Vincent Colapietro in Chapter 3, ‘Speaking Out of a Sense of Our Impoverishment’, and Standish in Chapter 4, ‘Rebuking Hopelessness’. According to Colapietro, translation unsettles our complacency when using language. Confronting the difficulties of translation means that one never speaks with over-confidence; rather with humility, ‘out of a sense of impoverishment’. In a fruitful meditation on a meeting between Martin Heidegger and Paul Celan, Standish turns the potentially pessimistic notion of ‘impoverishment’ into a positive view of translation as a constant necessary process of negotiation and compromise. Language should always be thought of in terms of an encounter with others, and such encounters are opened up by poetry and translation. Standish’s close reading of literary and philosophical texts adds a rich depth to his interpretation of translation as intralingual, which is sometimes lacking elsewhere.\n\nIn Chapter 11, Standish describes how as a student, Cavell hoped that all language could be eliminated of misunderstandings and ambiguities by being perfectly translated into logic (171-2). Cavell later moved away from this idea, towards a view of translation not as a complete process but as one always necessarily incomplete. In Chapter 10, Saito links this process with learning and education. Saito aptly states that ‘We continue education not to know about ourselves, but to realize the little we knew’ (168). Ian Munday, in Chapter 7, usefully highlights how this is a significant point for education, in that ‘frustration and confusion’ are ‘integral to a good education’ (96).\n\nThe connection between translation and education is a valuable one. Joris Vlieghe describes situations of ‘radical translation’ in Chapter 5, as contexts where students and teachers have to rely on communicating in a language that is not their mother tongue. Even native speakers are ‘heirs’ to their language, meaning that they are ‘forced to speak the words of others’ and remain ‘strangers to “our” language’ (81). Through interlingual and intralingual translation, ‘we are constantly required to negotiate the terms we use’ (79). Drawing on his own experiences of teaching, Vlieghe describes how negotiating situations of radical translation are educational in a profound sense, in that they show us 1) that a ‘we’ is developed through our endeavours and 2) that commonality is not a condition of communication, but the result (76).\n\nThis book is just as much about untranslatability as it is about translation. Untranslatability can demonstrate the potential of language as well as its limits. Claudia W. Ruitenberg discusses the benefits of ‘untranslatables’ to education. They enhance the students’ vocabulary, adding ‘nuance and complexity to international education’ (142). Untranslatables also prompt the philosophical insight that concepts are not universal across cultures, or independent of the words that represent them (142). Encountering untranslatables enables us to overcome a ‘oneworldedness’, a complacent acceptance of the dominance of a global language. Ruitenberg’s argument is strengthened by her references to her personal experience teaching students philosophy in English (as a native-speaker of Dutch) and trying to explain foreign terms, such as the German concept of Bildung (147). Such experiences ‘demand that we pause before engaging in “cross-cultural” dialogue’ and therefore ‘cannot take for granted that we speak from a common ground’ (153). Ruitenberg takes issue with Saito’s claim that interlingual translation is ‘simply’ linguistic conversion, arguing that ‘we should not abandon attention to the linguistic aspects of translation too quickly’ (145).\n\nIn this respect, the book manages to resolve some of its own problems and contradictions. The downplaying of interlingual translation is surprising, given that its importance has already been widely acknowledged (such as in the Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon, edited by Barbara Cassin). Many of the creative responses and meditations on the philosophical appeal of translation could have been improved by further specifying the distinction between ‘translation’ and analogous terms, such as ‘transformation’. The volume’s originality and greatest success, however, lies in its connecting of translation with the philosophy of education.\n\nNovember 2016\n\nMichael Allan, In the Shadow of World Literature: Sites of Reading in Colonial Egypt. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2016. £70.95. ISBN: 9780691167824.\n\nReviewed by Lijing Peng, National University of Ireland, Maynooth, Co. Kildare\n\nIn the Shadow of World Literature: Sites of Reading in Colonial Egypt by Michael Allan (Princeton University Press, 2016)\n\nWith In the Shadow of World Literature Michael Allan bridges political theory, religious studies, and anthropology, with the aim of producing an enriched understanding of the contours and limits of a literary world. Situating this research in the frontline of socio-political studies of Islam, Allan thoroughly explores the process of indigenous Egyptian secularism (or modernization) before and during the colonial period. Based on abundant historical documents and anthropological materials, as well as on comprehensive responses to dominant secular criticism, Allan successfully challenges the polarization of secular humanism and religious instruction that informs modernization discourses.\n\nDeeply inspired by Zheng Cheah’s recent formulation of world literature as a world-making activity that ‘allows us to imagine the world’ (122), Allan continues the work of his edited volume Reading Secularism (2013) which treats religion and secularism as mutually determining categories in the literary world. Allan aims to ‘focus on world literature less as an accumulation of texts from across different literary traditions than as the globalization of literary hermeneutics’ (41). He also examines the thought of the Egyptian intellectual Taha Hussein (1889–1973) in its historicisation of both the cosmopolitan heritage of the Arabic language and Islam's role as a cultural receptor for Judaism and Christianity (3, 121–2). Accordingly, he emphasizes literature’s communication function at pivotal historical moments in the Egyptian literary world.\n\nIn the Shadow of World Literature structures itself around a series of questions. What, for example, does secularism do in redefining religion as part of modern life? In answering this, Allan firstly confirms the role of literature: ‘literature becomes a rich site not only as a pedagogical matter for cultivating a modern aesthetic sensibility, but also for the renegotiation of the terms through which reading, response, and representation play out’ (10). In the first chapter, entitled ‘World’, Allan gives the example of how the Syrian writer Haydar Haydar’s work A Banquet for Seaweed, which describes a world torn by the secular left and the rise of religion, was boycotted by students at the Islamic Al-Azhar University. Allan points out that in this case literature is not judged by its form and configuration, but by the way it confronts the reading of a different literary tradition and a different reading public. Another question that arises is, Who holds the right to freedom of speech: the novel’s supporters, drawn from the intellectual and socio-political elite, or those out in the street demonstrating against it? The fact that the latter were deemed inappropriate readers indicates that ‘Literature does not inhere in the intrinsic attributes of the text, but relies upon the world that gives the text its contingent meaning’ (25).\n\nThe key question in the second chapter, ‘Translation’, is: What do we do when the world in which we situate a text is not the world within which the text is understood? Here, the story of the Rosetta Stone is accompanied by a solid historical account of the emergence of Egyptology during colonial period. The entextualisation of the Rosetta Stone transforms it from an object of the colonial past into a literary text belonging to the ‘World Republic of Letters’. Allan argues that once it was deciphered and lithographic copies widely circulated throughout Europe, the Rosetta Stone was no longer a sacred stele within a religious cult as it had been for thousands of years; rather, it became a text to be read and scrutinized in cultural exchanges. A similar transformation also took place with the innovative reading of the Qur’an in the first issue of La Décade égyptienne, a journal focusing on the economic and political conditions of Egypt during Napoleon's campaign there (1798–1801). Allan’s analyses so far have attracted attention to the ‘transformations that both create the modern literary disciplines and define the contours of a reading public’ (4), which are integral to most of his strongest arguments.\n\nThe third chapter, ‘Education’, explores the role of political institutions in the Egyptian literary world. Allan lists a series of pivotal moments in Egyptian education: a) the emergence of Egyptian Studies as a discipline during the period of the French Campaign; b) the reign of Muhammad Ali (1805–48) which coincided with a push for educational reform; c) the modernization of the Arabic language and its teaching in the latter 19th century; d) the emergence of a national consciousness during late 19th and early 20th century. Crucial here is the fact that the reform that differentiated an education system marked by Qur’anic instruction from one aimed at bringing up specialists in civic administration predated the British Occupation. And in post-colonial Egypt the kuttab system of Qur’anic instruction was made free to students, so that it became the foundation of a national education system at a point when nationalist ideology was rising. The implication here is that the takeover of the kuttab system broke the balance of the two sorts of education systems that had existed before the massive French and British influences. Instead of recognizing the assumption of British scholars in late 19th century that a sound economy must be the basis of a modern, self-governing Egypt, postcolonial Egypt set out to self-define what it means to be well-educated for self-government (56, 73). This self-definition forecloses many possible conversations between two different ideologies that had co-existed in Ottoman Egypt.\n\nThe fourth chapter, ‘Literature’, asks: What are the implications of institutional histories for the reading of texts? Although it traces the emergence of modern literary study in Egypt and credits the key Arabic-language scholars (80), this transition chapter shifts the historical positivist mode in the above discussions to a more theoretical study of world literature. In order to do this, Allan revives debates on formalism versus more socio-historical based approaches to literature. Also at this point Allan mentions two scholarly works which deal with similar themes and which have influenced him: Aamir Mufti’s article ‘Orientalism and the Institution of World Literatures’ (2010) and Sheldon Pollock’s monograph Language of the Gods in the World of Men (2006). Pollock’s groundbreaking elaboration of the Sanskrit cosmopolis, spanning immense territories anda vast timeframe, seems especially illuminating given that Allan’s aim is to broaden the terms through which world literature comes to be understood beyond national and political boundaries. In light of these preceding studies, Allan sets out to reachhis goal by exploring the meaning of adab (roughly the Arabic counterpart to ‘literature’). The case studies in the following sections well support his understanding of ‘literature as learning, pedagogical, institutional dealing with text’ (76), and profoundly demonstrate that the literary world is shaped by the transformations of print culture, libraries, schools, discourses on literacy, and the emergence of a literary public.\n\nWhat is world literature without the logic of cultural or national particularity? The fifth chapter, ‘Critique’, presents some intriguing parallel case studies extracted from the Egyptian literary world duringthe late colonial and postcolonial periods. In 1882, a scholar named Edwin Lewis made a speech to the Syrian Protestant College that supported liberal conceptions of knowledge by citing Darwin’s works. He also noted ‘the difference between science (al-’ilm) and wisdom (al-hikmah)’ (98). This speech led to a huge debate and a division between academic communities which greatly impaired the maintenance of the school itself, with the role that a missionary literateur should have in the country at that time coming under scrutiny. Allan also argues that Lewis and his supporters were addressing an abstract scholarly public, while their opponents held that their responsibility should have been to a general audience more in need of their advisory role than their critical minds. The ground of this reprimand is worth noting, in order to understand how this literary world was shaped by texts, intellectuals, and the reading public.\n\nIn the same chapter, Allan describes another argument, in a much later literary scene, but which also centers on Darwin. The Cairo Trilogy (1956–7) by Naguib Mahfouz (1911–2006), the Nobel laureate, offers a representative intellectual history of Egypt spanning a century. In one chapter, a young character publishes a supportive review of Darwinian theory. Characters from the older generation consider this publication most inappropriate, because it demonstrates the youth’s ‘ignorance’ of Qur’anic instruction. Although both sides hold totally opposite opinions of human origins, they share the view that the traditional religious intellectual is the model that all scholars should follow. This issue of scholarly model is raised by the youth’s ‘illiterate’ mother, who forms a strong opinion without reading any of the relevant materials. The father, who actually reads all materials in interest, takes a much softer stance and argues critically. In this, however—and unlike the mother—he fails to grasp the bigger picture.\n\nThe shining point in Allan’s above two analyses is the examination of how religion is constructed as a category negotiated between characters. This is an idea further developed in the last chapter, entitled ‘Intellectuals’. This chapter contains a moving account of the intellectual exchange between two renowned literary figures from different literary traditions, Taha Hussein and André Gide. Allan describes Hussein’s autobiographical writings, which tell of his experiences in two different education systems, and which influence the reading public, moderating the ideological polarization of the two systems. This influence came to a climax when the translation of Gide’s La porte étroite (1909) was published with a letter from Hussein as a preface. In this letter Hussein provides a historicizing account of Islam,emphasizing the cultural exchanges between Islam and other religions in which it arose. Hussein's letter eliminated a certain doubt for Gide. Until then, he had been concerned that the uncertainties about humanlife that his novel expressed could not be properly received by a reading public constituted mainly of firm believers in a strict religion. As Allan concludes, ‘Translation, figured here as much religiously as linguistically, provides the occasion to consider the limits of audience within the context of world literature’ (120).\n\nIn the Shadow of World Literature touches onsuch fundamental issues as the emergence of categories and the confrontations that arise between different literary traditions, especially powerful in the context of colonialism and secularism studies. It also provides us with a looking glass through which we may glimpse a vivid literary world made possible by reading of many different sorts.\n\nJune 2016\n\nModernist Fiction and Vagueness: Philosophy, Form, and Language, Megan Quigley. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015. £62.00. ISBN: 9781107089594\n\nReviewed by Martin Glick, University of Göttingen\n\nVagueness as a field of study relies on an understanding of Logic and Philosophy of Language to expose the indefiniteness of the words we use. While Megan Quigley’s book doesn’t incorporate contemporary discussion of vagueness such as those from David Barnett and B. J. Copeland, this absence can be attributed to the fact that Modernist Fiction and Vagueness: Philosophy, Form, and Language (2015) is mostly a work of literary criticism, and would make little use of the symbolic logic found in recent developments in the field. There is a substantial amount of discussion regarding Pragmatism, and she relies on the writings and personal notes of Bertrand Russell, William James, Charles S. Pierce, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the critical writing of T.S. Eliot, to provide a background for her project on the use of vague language in Modernist fiction. What follows is an enlightening survey that “joins a philosopher with a novelist” (10) in each of her four chapters to demonstrate how the imprecise boundaries of our language doesn’t mean it “cannot connect to our experience of the world” (11). Henry James, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce compose the Modernist authors represented in the book with particular attention paid to their later, more experimental words.\n\nThe essential question and thesis of her book is to identify, “why did literary realism, like a transparent language of logic, prove insufficient at the beginning of the twentieth century for capturing the vagaries of consciousness or modern life?” (19). Vague language took its place as the dominant mode of writing: one of “puzzlement and indecision” (7). Quigley proposes that the three Modernist writers had twin goals: “to revise the conventions of the realist novel and the revolt against positivism in the philosophy of language” (5). The relation between literature and philosophy is explicitly spelled out in her book, often with helpful summaries for those without a background in literary studies, such as the one found at the beginning of chapter one: “In The Ambassadors, in syntax as vague as the relations in which Stretcher finds himself embroiled, Henry James dramatizes the difficulty of making moral choices in a vague new world.” (26). In terms of the Modernists’ opposition to the previous Realist movement, of which Flaubert was emblematic, Quigley offers the same concise evaluations. References to T.S. Eliot, whose early “interest in eradicating literary vagueness” (148), open and close Quigley’s book in an elegant demonstration of the development of literary thought influenced by philosophy.\n\nThe thesis of her book has been set out in her paper “Modern Novels and Vagueness” (2008) from which the Introduction and second chapter borrow heavily. The first chapter resumes and expands upon the discussion in “Beastly Vagueness in Charles Sanders Pierce and Henry James” (2007). Those who are familiar with Quigley’s scholarly work will generally not need to re-read these initial sections of her book, though they can serve as excellent introductions to the topics at hand. The remainder of her book delves into territory only briefly discussed in her papers and fleshes out more minor points.\n\nEach chapter is structured around a philosophical background and literary response to it. In most cases, the philosopher and writer discussed in the chapter had close personal ties which gives the tension between them the air of a drama. Chapter one reviews the introduction of The Metaphysical Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts where Charles S. Pierce “published papers that William James later called ‘the birth certificates’ of pragmatism” (26). Between James and Pierce there was a conflict in terms of how Pragmatism should be understood. Pierce was committed to clearing out vagueness in language because he believed on focusing on sensible effects of ideas which are “clear and recognizable” (27). James celebrated language’s capacity for vagueness, though when it came to literary works, he had unkind things to say about his brother Henry whose novels Watch and Ward, The Sacred Fount, and The Ambassadors are discussed in the remainder of the chapter. Quigley demonstrates the pragmatic philosophers’ influence on Henry James using biographical information along with a keen eye for influence. Frequently in this chapter, biography proves to be the most assured means when talking about influence and Quigley mines the sibling relationship to venture conclusions like this: “I propose that Henry James’s narrator is a pragmatist, using the pragmatic method William James had propounded in his lectures in 1898. The narrator, however, is a pragmatist gone wrong, entrapped by the beauty of his own theory” (50). Continuing her discussion of The Sacred Fount, she writes that Henry James has created a narrator who isolates himself from others due to the seductive quality of his personal theory. Quigley also includes a brief note on the critical response these novels received by Henry James’s contemporaries. The vagueness of the content repelled readers, who claimed they were ambiguous in their intended messages, Quigley identifies in The Ambassadors the kind of character that critics deplored, but summarizes Henry James’s main character from the novel as acting as “a strong ambassador even with vague beliefs” (62), which is a reunification of ambiguity and determination.\n\nChapter two is set in Bloomsbury where Virginia Woolf is ready to acknowledge in her novels that “modern literature must present ‘Life’ the way it really is - blurred and distorted” (66) but Bertrand Russell “insists that ‘discrimination’ and careful ‘analysis’ are the best means to knowledge” (70). Night and Day, Jacob’s Room, To The Lighthouse, and The Waves of Woolf’s “novels of vision” are represented in this chapter as is a discussion of Russell’s lectures which Woolf attended. Russell is to a degree sympathetic to the cause of vagueness and notes “[o]n the contrary, a vague belief has a much better chance of being true than a precise one” (73) when referencing the accuracy a smudged photograph might have when one guesses that there is a man in the picture instead of a specific man like “asserting it is Brown or Jones or Robinson” (73). The “many-sided” (74) truth of words Woolf takes up as her defining aesthetic is in strict rebellion against Russell’s “special language” which he proposed would have the accuracy of mathematics. The way in which Woolf presents vagueness as gendered sets her apart from the other writers in Quigley’s study. Female characters are “associated with ‘vagueness’ “ (78) with a regularity not associated with male figures. As a way of responding to the lectures of Russell, Woolf has her characters speak directly to the nature of his philosophy by aligning themselves with the separateness of language and mathematics. Quigley charts the evolution of Woolf’s vagueness with direct reference to her work providing helpful examples of the kind of style associated with vague writing: “combining free indirect discourse, multiple perspectives, and interspersed passages of tragedy” (88). The chapters concludes with a discussion of The Waves which Quigley claims is Woolf’s masterpiece and deals directly with Russell’s claim that the “possible end result of ontological vagueness is solipsism” (100), in a fantastic demonstration of literary criticism.\n\nChapter three focuses on James Joyce and Ludwig Wittgenstein in a manner similar to the previous chapters. Quigley's work seeks to fill in a gap where there is “startlingly little written comparing these two important twentieth-century figures, one who theorized the language game and one who created perhaps the most famously rebarbative example of one in Finnegans Wake.” (110). Both authors are intent on redeeming aspects of Pragmatism. Wittgenstein and Joyce were familiar with the writings of F. C. S. Schiller, a contemporary of Russell, and it was Joyce who adopted certain aspects of the new ideas in his writing,:“Pragmatism’s lure for Joyce is crystallized in its ability to abolish the ‘Absolute once and for all,’ just as Stephen is ‘fond of saying that the Absolute is dead’\" (115). More here than in Quigley's other chapters there is an intense agreement between the philosopher and author about how language ought to be approached. Quigley excellently summarizes this point in a discussion about the later work of each writer: “In the Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein shows how even when words are recognizable, our cultural and social estrangement can make us feel utterly at a loss” (129), She goes on to discuss Ulysses and the confusion that arises when reading it by saying: “the multiplicity of styles creates a novel game with constantly changing rules, where readers struggle to find footing” (130). Wittgenstein’s 'picture theory' of meaning and C. K. Ogden's translation of Joyce into Basic English are also mentioned in this chapter further tightening the connection between the two.\n\nThe final chapter reviews T.S. Eliot’s opinions about Henry James, Woolf, and Joyce. Because of his personal connection with Bertrand Russell and status as both an author and a critic it makes for a seamless way to wrap up the theme of vagueness. In his early writing he criticizes philosophy by pointing out that the “‘verbalism’ of contemporary philosophy is due to those philosophers who believe they deal ‘with objects’ that are ‘of the same exactness as the mathematician’s’” (156). He was also skeptical of his fellow authors, worried that they were creating “tentative sketches and rough experiments” (164). The chapter ends with an overview of New Criticism and a brief word on recent investigations into “fuzziness”, a concept embodied in the humanities by neo-pragmatists, most famously Richard Rorty (170).\n\nMegan Quigley has succeeded in two ways. Her book is not only a wholly succinct review of the element of vagueness in Modernist writing, but a work which inspires readers to discover for themselves new connections between philosophy and literature. For the philosopher there are new intersections between thought and fiction to be found in these pages. For the literary critic, this book might make solid parts of philosophy which have previously seemed abstract. It would have been interesting to include a counter-point - if one exists - of a Modernist writer detached from philosophic study and suspicious of the usefulness of vague language, but this is minor quibble in an otherwise entertaining and substantial book.\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nThe Crisis of Global Modernity: Asian Traditions and a Sustainable Future, Prasenjit Duara. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014. £22.99. ISBN: 9781107442856.\n\nReviewed by Feng-yi Chu, University of Oxford\n\nThere is much to be excited about in Prasenjit Duara's latest book, for the work has great potential for tackling three core problems that modern societies are facing today. Firstly, when encountering a series of setbacks in the late 1980s as communist regimes collapsed one by one and the capitalist model triumphed, what discourses, counter-ideologies, and strategies can contemporary left-wing intellectuals and activists offer to solve class inequality and the mass-scale exploitation of natural resources around the world? Secondly, when the concept of modernity has long been diagnosed as overly biased and Western-centric, how should the non-Western world respond to the problems brought by modernity, particularly the temptation of rapid economic development and the environmental destruction that inevitably follows, along with the demise of native cultures, social structures, political systems and local lifestyles? Similarly, when nationalism has been seen to be an imagined and socially-constructed ideology, one that has often been manipulated in ethnic and international conflicts, in what ways can people reimagine and redesign the global political system? All these questions point to a common theme: since competition and exploitation are the main goals of capitalism and nationalism, the two major products of modernity, they are leading us to a future of barrenness and conflict. In his new work, Duara is searching for and developing philosophies and strategies of sustainability to act as alternatives to Western modernity.\n\nHow does he approach such problems? Duara uses two concepts to lay the theoretical foundation for reconceptualising modernity: \"traffic of transcendence\" and circulation. Unlike past scholarly studies that usually see modernity as a socio-political rupture from transcendent religious power to secularized, “disenchanted” human authorities or sovereignties, Duara argues that the concept of contemporary sovereignty is still founded on the primitive imagination of (and need for) transcendence. Transcendence refers to “transcending the here and now of the world” (4). The concept thus implies a conventional structure of dualism between existing conditions (“here and now”) and a projected, imagined desirable status. As Duara notes, transcendence involves “a critique of existing conditions” and proposes “a non-worldly power and vision to morally authorize an alternative to the existing arrangements and structure of power” (ibid.). He argues that such qualities and attributes associated with religion in earlier periods can be redistributed in the creation of the secular—a process which he calls “traffic of transcendence.” Therefore, for Duara, “modernity” is another way of comprehending and explaining how humans master the world. The assertive rupture between pre-modern religious societies and modern secular societies is a false construct proposed by modern historians and researchers because they have accepted “the terms of methodological nationalism” too quickly.\n\nIf modernity is a particular conceptualization of linear history in which humans (and nation-states, their collective agents) are entitled to explore and to extract worldly resources, it is rational to search for substituted philosophies and alternative perspectives in order to resolve the crisis of modernity. Duara suggests that candidates for alternative cosmologies of sustainability and circulatory history can more easily be found in cultures or societies of “dialogical transcendence” (polytheist societies), especially in Asia, than those of “radical transcendence” (monotheist societies). The key themes—and the major contribution of the book—lie in this search and the theoretical discussion of historical sociology.\n\nIn Chapter 1, Duara shares his analyses and observations on some traditions and approaches of sustainability in Asia in order to respond to global crises of our time. He further offers detailed theoretical discussions on his concepts of circulatory history (Chapter 2), on the logic of global modernity in historical, economic, political and cultural terms (Chapter 3), as well as on transcendence, including the differences between what he calls “radical” and “dialogical” transcendence (Chapter 4). In Chapter 5, with a particular focus on East Asia, Duara applies his concept of transcendence and construes how religions (both faith-based ones, like Buddhism and Daoism, and redemptive societies, such as local folk religions) have been interacting deeply with politics. For example, this involves how regimes used religions to legitimate their authority and how they governed religious groups to control local politics. His comparative study of Japan and China sheds further light on the question of why “China was able to escape the confessional-communalism that deeply affected most other societies in Asia and perhaps the world” (193); the study is of significance for it adequately explains the diversity of strategies in the way different political communities in Asia reacted to Western modernity in the late nineteenth century. Chapter 6 demonstrates the idea of “traffic of transcendence,” illustrating how religious resources are channelled to build the ideal citizen for the nation-state in the cases of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, India, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. In Chapter 7, Duara views regionalism “in terms of the circulatory forces and networks that have created and often recreated interdependence” among societies in Asia and the world. Although, as he argues, “modern nationalisms sought precisely to create hard boundaries between communities by privileging a defining characteristic of community (say, language),” it is crucial to recognize the significant influence of the non-congruence created by various regional nexuses. The models of cultural circulation without state domination of identity, which can be seen in the maritime Asian networks and in contemporary Asian regional interdependence, offer invaluable intellectual resources to explore new possibilities for transnational and trans-local interactions.\n\nIn his conclusion, Duara introduces another attribute of transcendence, “hope”, asking whether hope can be seen to be “the kernel of the sacred?” (285). He finds the concept sharing a similarity with transcendence, particular dialogical ones: “Hope by itself is based on reasonable expectations and efforts made to realize them. In its pragmatic character, it is more open to reason than faith and belief” (285).\n\nI believe that first exploring the essence of hope is able to facilitate our apprehension of the role of hope in transcendence: What is the essence of hope? What is \"hope\"? What do people have hope for? An intuitive answer could be: people hope for better conditions. It is the unbearable nature of the present condition that drives people to create transcendence. From this point of view, one of the basic facets of the sacred (transcendence) is dissatisfaction, discontent, and disappointment. And when encountering this disappointment and dissatisfaction, people usually react in two ways: One is reacting pessimistically, believing the miserable condition will remain the same and nothing can be done about it. The other is reacting hopefully and optimistically, expecting the miserable condition will be amended. Transcendence, i.e., a better future, more desirable conditions, and a view of projected utopia, emerges in the latter mentality.\n\nTherefore, the process of transcendence, or the competition between different transcendence, is a perpetual movement. With hope, the movement continues, until we reach a state in which we are entirely enjoying our existence. Hence, I believe what Duara proposes is not to “overcome” transcendence, because, after all, it is a key element in human society that cannot be eradicated. Rather, he is suggesting, as he puts in the description at the beginning of his book, that the physical salvation “must become the transcendent goal of our times” to deal with the global crises we are facing nowadays.\n\nHowever, a problem remains: although circulatory histories and sustainable traditions—which can be found in the cultures and the societies of Asia, as Duara illustrates—can become the means by which we may overcome modernity, it is also a matter of fact that in terms of the development of history, these societies have now been arguably dominated by capitalist logic, an ideology of linear history, and nationalisms. Perhaps the ultimate predicament is more material—the tremendous economic and political power held by those who are eager to accumulate their own wealth and to satiate their greed by exploiting resources of the world. If so, then the question will be: how could we gain enough power, particularly in economic and political terms, to stop them?\n\nThe conventional approach is suggested by the intellectuals and theorists of late nineteenth century Asia (and most of the Third World countries)—establishing a competitive powerful nation state to fight against the encroachment of imperialism and colonialism of Western nations. The Chinese revolutionary Dr Sun Yet-sen, for instance, stated that one of the most important functions of nation states is to counter balance the adverse effects of capital. (Sun Wen xuanji, 2006) Yet, this approach (i.e., methodological nationalism) is one of the marks that Duara endeavors to criticise. In many cases, political leaders of nation states in fact share vested interests with capitalists, bankers, and entrepreneurs of multinational corporations. By provoking and manipulating nationalism, they aim to mobilize the masses to attack (false) enemies for political gains. (e.g. Slavoj Zizek on the 2015 Paris attacks)\n\nThe lesson of Duara’s analysis is this: if we keep framing ourselves methodologically in nationalism, we can no longer obtain the power we need, nor can we formulate feasible strategies. He suggests that the establishment of cooperation within transnational and trans-local nexuses of organisations and societies can act as possible solutions. With resources gathered from individuals who share common values, goals, as well as care for the future sustainable development of the Earth, these communities and societies may possess competitive momentum not only to resist the exploitation by capitalists but also to demand assistance from nation states. Duara’s work offers us the theoretical foundation to avoid the hegemonic narratives of modernity, linear history, and nationalism. When starting to realise that the ways we used to think, to comprehend, and to live are not the only viable options, we will be able to think of new strategies to direct the world to a sustainable future.\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nOn the Universal: The Uniform, the Common and Dialogue between Cultures, François Jullien. Translated by Michael Richardson and Krzysztof Fijalkowski. Cambridge, UK and Malden, MA: Polity Press, 2014. $29.95. ISBN 9780745646237.\n\nReviewed by Patricia Harris Stäblein Gillies, University of Essex\n\nTranslations into English of the philosopher/sinologist François Jullien’s important, wide-ranging and extensive publications are still rather few. Although already no longer representative of Jullien’s most recent works, this translation brings key points of his radical re-orientation of thinking about cultural difference to the awareness of English readers. Deeply rooted in Chinese and Greek thought, Jullien deploys a Cartesian approach – “Je pense donc je suis”/ “I think therefore I am” – to save the discussion of culture from the endless marking of differences and oppositions, and to position it in the activity of thinking that distinguishes “the openly exploratory concept” of the human (169, cf. ‘mankind', 39, 168-70). To demonstrate the intercultural range of this Cartesian position, Jullien cites, among other Classical thinkers, Heraclitus – “Thinking is common to all” (25) – and he develops the links between Cicero’s extensive universal (74-75) and the Confucian emphasis on opening the mind, “emptying it out”, “concentrating it” (76).\n\nThe book opens with a Foreword challenging the reader to go beyond the comfort zone of “sloppy humanism” and to discover a rich territory of resistance, silence and divergence. An Itinerary provides a useful orientation by dividing the thirteen chapters of the book into four sections: Critique of Notions, European Genealogy, Enquiry and Problematization, and Stakes and Positions. The first of these focuses on the static dangers of cliché concepts like the Uniform, which cloaks the Universal in the counterfeit of the similar, and the Common, which is distorted into an exclusive “communitarianism”. The political force of the Common demands extensive and open participation, just as the Universal demands active enquiry into its legitimacy. In his second section, Jullien evades a facile de-legitimation of the European component of the concept of the Universal to argue the importance of its development via Roman thinkers like Cicero and then Christians such as Paul. For such thinkers, the Universal is not exclusive but extends through an unlimited diversity that is nonetheless integrated by a legal or religious Common. Once these foundations are established, Jullien considers the issue of the Universal in cultures long in contact with the European world such as Indian and Islamic societies. Finding both of these primarily “communitarian” and thus prescriptive on religious, moral, social and political grounds, Jullien posits that Chinese civilization – developed in relative isolation from Europe – is free from the limitations of a prescriptive universality. In the ancient Chinese poems of the Shijing, bo and later pu are translated here as “universal” to express that which is extensive, spreading without limits through diverse peoples and customs and without “claiming an imperative [devoir-être]” (73) or point of view. The tao or way “crosses and links internally the multiplicity of things and situations” but there is no form to represent the Universal (76). The world exists in terms of quan or “circumstance” (80, 109) but also power (108), including political power. That term implies the operation of balance and “weighing up”. This emphasis on functionality indicates the equivalence of being and non-being in Taoism (84-85). A key example of the practicality of this kind of thinking is the importance given to the void. It is the void which becomes the space that makes function possible – the space in which the wheel turns, the emptiness of the container, and the opening of doors and windows in a room (84). That functionalist orientation manifests itself in a drive to arrive at knowledge of extensive space and time by opening the mind to reflection on what may become the realities of existence. Classical Chinese does not posit Being in terms of type in the way that the Aristotelian tradition does. Instead, it privileges dang or the “circumstantial” where the true can be zhen or “authentic” rather than an abstract ideal. In this way Classical Chinese valorises the harmonious rather than the oppositional and conflictual. A clear idea of Jullien’s project then emerges when one works through to what Jullien argues as uniquely Chinese concepts. These form the basis of his concept of the dynamics of universalizing. From this position he challenges the rigidity of European concepts of the Universal and the Common in the high stakes politics of Human Rights (72-92; 118-34). In the closing section, Jullien cashes out his promotion of the “intelligibility of cultures” into his advocacy of comprehension over the futility of negotiation and compromise (144-50). Dialogue is only possible through the interplay of tensions driven by divergence and resistance. The importance of negativity is in its witness to our capacity to think in diverse ways. For Jullien, divergence frees cultural dialogue from the norms and limits (152-54) that undermine Human Rights negotiations and declarations. By admitting the pertinence of the Taoist warning about “speaking without speaking” and admitting the potentiality of “not speaking, not having not spoken” (128), it becomes possible to achieve the “common sense”, the space where cultures can meet (98-9).\n\nFor Jullien, the dynamic features of cultural opening are located in the fluidity of universalizing rather than what can be an oppressive and Euro-centric Universal. The Uniform does not reflect the Universal but is rather a pernicious opposite too often conflated it (pp. 10-15). When the Universal as an abstract concept is destabilised into the diverse tensions of the “universalizing”, the “common” escapes reductive social and biological limits. What is shared in a static communality is itself charged with the energy demanded by the process of sharing. Such activity makes it possible to “comprehend the world […] and bring people together in co-habitation“ (25-27). Jullien suggests that such an approach valorising the shifts and adjustments that characterise “intelligibility”, “comprehension”, “extension” and “coherence” can arrive at the point where cultures meet in “the common sense of the human” which is an undetermined ideal or possible validity (97-99). The implications for the language of Human Rights are evident in Jullien’s turn on Kant’s thinking about the beautiful, but also bear on the development of studies in comparative culture, literature and translation projects. Jullien’s is an oeuvre and this is a book worthy of the demands which his complex and multivalent, even lambent, thought demands. He positions the reader in the interpretative flux that he is promoting but his philosophical references and concepts are well grounded and clear.\n\nAt times, however, he falls into the oversimplified marking of differences that he so eloquently argues against – especially in the rather summary treatment of Islamic culture and the aesthetically underpowered discussion of Van Eyck’s “Adoration of the Mystic Lamb”. For example, taking advice from “Islamicist friends” (64), Jullien sees the Universal in Islam as strongly grounded in the communitarian, and thus more about limitations and exclusions than openness (62-66). It could be useful, however, to link this discussion more closely with the preceding consideration of Van Eyck’s painting since the mystical plays a key role in the aesthetics of both religions. While Jullien is uneasy before the fixed hierarchy of the divine that he reads in the composition of “The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb”, the dynamic modality of the Universal that he privileges is strongly present in the extraordinary light effects of the painting, to which he refers, but which he does not identify as a defining feature of the painting’s aesthetics. Similarly in Islamic art and architecture, it is abstract design, often expressed as the interplay of light and dark, that projects the viewer beyond the material into an abstract universal divine. Oleg Grabar, The Formation of Islamic Art, 1987)\n\nBut even at its weaker moments, this remains an intellectually rigorous and thought-provoking book. Jullien’s exposure of the rickety structure of assumptions and essentialising that underlies much Human Rights discourse is particularly useful (100-20), since he urges a turn towards strategies that acknowledge difference, resistance, silence and tension in terms of intelligibility rather than judgement and conflict. His emphasis on opening and extension, as opposed to closure and limitation, is also particularly useful in analysing large-scale literary works such as epics and tragedies where universalizing dynamics are often at play. While Jullien’s insistence on the flexibility of Chinese Confucian and Taoist concepts may not sufficiently acknowledge the degree to which that position may serve the interests of earlier centuries of Chinese imperial society or contemporary Asian imperialist impulses, his focus on how deceptive English translation of Chinese concepts and poetry can be is extremely pertinent for those who currently work on Chinese-English translation (e.g. 72-76, 78-85, 144-56).\n\nIn conjunction with his discussion of these issues, Jullien might have raised the shift in the relationship of French and Chinese poetry which occurred in late nineteenth-century France with the highly influential publication of the first translation of Classical Chinese poetry into French, the Livre de Jade by Judith Gautier (1867), the daughter of leading intellectual and author Théophile Gautier. Since Jullien does convene the relevance to Chinese thought of the fullness communicated by the “void” (or rather the “emptying out”) of the “there is not” in Chinese painting, he might well have remarked on Gautier’s communication of this intellectual and visual reality in her translations. It is exactly this empty plenitude that the great visionary poet Mallarmé picks up on in his subsequent (c.1868) poem. “Las de l’amer repos” (“Weary of bitter rest”), where the exquisite fullness of the voids painted by a Chinese porcelain painter rescues the poet from his otherwise fatal ennui. (Pauline Yu, “’Your Alabaster in this Porcelain’: Judith Gautier’s Le Livre de Jade ”, PMLA 122.2 (2007), p. 467) Jullien may well have addressed this material elsewhere in his extensive bibliography but his discussion of the nature of the universal relative to Chinese language and translation with regard to European and Chinese painting renews the pertinence of this material. Where Jullien emphasizes the value of Chinese references to promote the value of negativity in aesthetic and linguistic expression, there is a well-known tendency towards negative location in French thought and artistry – as witness Montaigne, Duchamp, and Lacan among many others in diverse fields. There is more than an echo of Lacanian psychology in Jullien’s insistence that it is not “universal human rights” but the “lack” of human rights that creates the circumstances in which the “genuinely intense universal of humanity “ declares itself (116).\n\nThere is then much worthy of close attention for literary scholars in this book. But its principal address is to those concerned with the language of political thought and to all concerned with finding an effective address to the increasing tempo fragmentation and violence in our world. The notes are useful if rather summary, but the bibliography serves as a good guide to further exploring ideas and thinkers to which Jullien refers, and the index is a valuable aid to track and review concepts and key discussions, although it does not track key Chinese terms like quan and ren. The book should, however, include a full and updated list of Jullien’s publications and interviews instead of a brief list of his books that appeared between 1998 and 2007. The translators Michael Richardson and Krzysztof Fijalkowski demonstrate meticulous devotion to the nuances of Jullien’s expression, and Jullien’s participation in the translation is acknowledged. At times sentence structures could have been shortened to avoid the long strings of clauses more hospitable to French habits of thought than to English preferences for more concise formulations. Nevertheless, if On the Universal demonstrated a prescient relevance to the dynamics of world politics when it was first published in French in 2008, the re-thinking it urges of well-intentioned but ill-founded Human Rights declarations and projects is of crucial relevance to an ever more dispersed and agonized world.\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nIntroducing Comparative Literature: New Trends and Applications, César Domínguez, Haun Saussy, and Darío Villanueva. New York: Routledge, 2015. £24.99. ISBN: 9780415702683.\n\nReviewed by Naomi Charlotte Fukuzawa, University College London & Christian Howard, University of Virginia\n\nThe first English-language critical introduction to the field of comparative literature since the 1990s, César Domínguez, Haun Saussy, and Darío Villanueva’s Introducing Comparative Literature: New Trends and Applications provides a much-needed outline of the extent and approaches of comparative literature while simultaneously tracing developing movements within the discipline. Indeed, although the authors primarily approach comparative literature through the US model, they are nonetheless attuned to the contours of the discipline’s history as it developed in Europe, from Goethe’s concept of Weltliteratur to the French school, and to more recent developments in the Chinese “third phase theory” (51). Yet even as they outline its historical progress, the authors address contemporary challenges to the field, responding to claims made by figures such as Susan Bassnett and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak that “comparative literature is dead” by positing new methods and approaches being employed by comparativists (10). The result is a concise book that addresses different aspects of comparative literature, ranging from literary theory and comparative methodology to translation studies, decolonization, East-West studies, literary history, and trans-literary thematic comparisons. In short, Domínguez, Saussy, and Villanueva offer a general introduction that is both engaging and historically informed, but which is ultimately forward-facing with regard to the continued and dynamic developments in comparative literature.\n\nThe book is divided into nine chapters, the first of which outlines the history of comparative literature by focusing upon key movements and figures who have shaped its growth. The authors situate comparative literature in relation to three other elements of literary study – poetics or literary theory, literary criticism, and literary history – defining it as the fourth of these primary disciplines. By addressing challenges to the field from a historical perspective, the authors acknowledge the shortcomings – such as Eurocentrism – that have beset comparative literary studies. Nonetheless, they use such historical background skillfully to resituate the debate within larger questions of methodology and approach. As such, the authors primarily draw upon Charles Bernheimer’s definition, outlined in his 1993 Bernheimer Report, as the basis of their critique, arguing that “comparative literature has risen to the challenge, showing itself to have enough resources to grow out of its contradictions, integrate new perspectives, and progress along the path of interdisciplinarity” (17). The remaining chapters expand upon the resources available to and progress accomplished by comparative literary studies today.\n\nOne method for rethinking the domain and methodologies employed by comparativists is outlined in the second chapter, which sketches the Slovak scholar Dionyz Durišin’s concept of interliterary theory. Adapted to comparative literary studies, interliterary theory “aims to explain how relationships are established between individual works and, as a result of these relationships, how literary groups are created – from smaller to larger – and hence how they determine some dominant directions of (world) literature” (22). Interliterary theory provides for two types of literary relationships, those based on genetic contact and those on typological affinities. These models are in turn applied to comparative literary studies, a move that enables Domínguez, Saussy, and Villanueva to reorganize comparative literature according to a re-consideration of “world literature” (a topic taken up in more detail in chapter 4).\n\nDominguez’s chapter on decoloniality clearly distinguishes this area of study from Postcolonial Studies. While Postcolonial Studies has “similar aims to those of comparative literature,” (41) the latter places stronger emphasis on the independence of once colonised cultures, on the one hand, and the multi-layered character of all human culture on the other. As such, the decoloniality of comparative literary studies calls for a stronger inclusion of Latin American cultures in the field of Comparative Literature and of Comparative Literature’s standing in Latin America. The description of this field’s challenges leads to the explanation of ‘comparative philosophy’ in distinction to comparative literature and to the so-called ‘East-West studies’ that emerged out of comparativism. One is reminded of Spivak’s call to overcome Eurocentrism by including non-European literatures ordinarily seen as peripheral to the canon. Dominguez says that “an imperative comparative literature will not stop at deconstructing and overcoming Eurocentrism, but will address all kinds of ethnocentrism all over the world, as well as non-European imperialisms” (53, 54). By highlighting the potential gaps in the application of decolonial studies or “world literary knowledges” within the field of comparative literature, Dominguez sets up the three following chapters written by Haun Saussy that circle around the inclusion of Chinese literature and thought into the discussion of world literature.\n\nSaussy’s first chapter, “World Literature as a Comparative Practice,” classically traces the origin of world literature to the 19th century starting with Goethe’s conversation with Eckermann, regarding the similarities between a Chinese and a European novel. Goethe’s concept of world literature calls for an inclusion of Oriental literature, culture and wisdom into the European canon, and represents a parallel to Marx and Engels’s critique of nation-states as epistemological entities within the global network spread by capitalism. Saussy quotes the Danish critic Georg Brandes’s note to a German newspaper’s inquiry into world literature in 1899. The paper had published an inquiry into world literature about the hierarchy of literary languages prioritising literatures in French, English and German. Brandes posits Andersen’s fame and Kierkegaard’s obscurity as examples of unequal power structures in the canon of world literature. This idea is taken up in contemporary discourse by David Damrosch who notes the shrinking number of studied authors. In this line of thought, Saussy traces the shift of the concept of world literature, paradigmatic for comparative literature overall, towards themes of globalization and transnationalism: the China-West comparison is presented as a key topic for future comparative literature studies, particularly the way Western literary themes and genres are included, adapted and partly subverted by Oriental writers. He raises the example of Madame Butterfly, showing how Long’s version – the groundwork of Puccini’s opera – was completely transformed in a late 20th century re-adaptation. World literature is thus seen more as a process of global interconnection, dealing with national images based on Self and Other, rather than as a fixed canon encompassing a certain number of titles.\n\nChapter Five, ‘Comparing Themes and Images,’ opens with quotation by George Steiner that introduces themes and Self-Other constructions as the basis for intercultural interaction. Haun Saussy gives examples of this sort of transformation in ‘Stoffgeschichte’ 'history of themes' from Virgil and Curtis to Petrarch and John Donne and also integrates modern Chinese literature. Saussy concludes: “Thematization, then, is an operation on meanings dormant in language, in society, in culture, performed by authors and also by readers. The alert reader detects patterns of association or exclusion that give the themes of a work their active role in generating new meaning. With this aim, thematic reading cannot be put aside as mere positivistic Stoffgeschichte” (77).\n\nThe sixth chapter, ‘Comparative Literature and Translation,’ emphasizes the role of translation in intercultural literary crossings, a concept that draws on René Wellek’s definition that “comparative Literature is an account of the ‘foreign trade of literatures’” (78). In this sense, the main concern of comparative literature is identified as “the relations among literatures of different languages.” Therefore, translation as a literary process remains central to Comparative Literature: “Perhaps between any two languages there is a zone of mutual borrowing, a zone where translation is superfluous or always erroneous. Perhaps ‘pure’ Arabic, Chinese, and the like exist somewhere, but as regions notably poor in semiotic exchange. We must, if this view of macaronic has any basis, be willing to discard our mental maps of languages occupying, without differentiation, a bounded territory.” (87). The notion of translation unites the constant movement of languages, the acquisition and adaptation of themes to different cultural contexts, and the change in forms of human imagination, and narration throughout the history of civilization remains at the heart of the comparative investigation. Still, it is made clear that the existence of translations should never be an excuse for maintaining monolingualism nor that the study of the original can be neglected, as illustrated by Emily Apter’s theorisation of ‘untranslatability’. Saussy states: “On the map of Comparative Literature, monolingualism is a blank. Through attention to multilingualism, code-mixing, and creolity, comparatists can make translation something other than a connector between two blank zones” (ibid.). Comparative Literature therefore is a thinking that overcomes national, linguistic, and formal boundaries between national territories, languages, and literatures upon which different philologies have been drawn.\n\nChapter Seven defines comparative literary history as a subset of comparative literature, and the authors outline the study of comparative history in order to apply the methods and approaches garnered therefrom to comparative literary history. These methods of approach include: time-orientation (95-96); spatial approach/mapping (97); nodes and networks, which can be “temporal, topographical, institutional, and figural” (99); and marginocentric cities, which examine the nexus between East/West (100). Emphasizing the comparative aspect to comparative literary theory, Domínguez, Saussy, and Villanueva “stress the narrative dimension of literary history, a perspectival vision, the dialectic of past and present as seen from the present,” and they argue that “ no comparative literary history could go beyond national limits and adequately represent inter-literary processes if what is shared globally is not contemplated from the site of its local/regional/national idiosyncrasy” (104).\n\nTaking up the claim established in the Bernheimer Report of 1993 that “the space of comparison today involves comparisons between artistic productions usually studied by different disciplines,” chapters eight and nine address the expansion of comparative literature to areas of study that extend beyond the purely literary and into interartistic comparison and digital studies (108). Such comparisons are based, in part, upon the dual premises that “all the arts are imitative” while “each art imitates in different ways” (107). This foundation allows the authors to sketch several fruitful intersections between literature and other arts, including film, music, and the visual arts. These interartistic comparisons are defined according to Lubomir Doležel’s term “transduction,” which has “the double meaning of transmission and transformation in the posterior processing of literary works” (111).\n\nIn their final chapter, the authors outline current trends and developments in literary studies, positioning comparative literature within the purview of such developments as digital narratives, including cyberdrama, hypertextual narration, and cyberpoetry. Comparative literature is, the authors argue, especially equipped to evaluate and shed light on these new developments. Ultimately, the foregoing discussions enable the authors to posit a new, more fully encompassing definition of comparative literature: “Comparative literature is an intellectual and methodological perspective founded precisely on wide temporal (and spatial) horizons. […] This is literature without spatial or temporal boundaries, which transcends the barriers of different languages thanks to the circulation of texts, translation and multilingualism, and especially thanks to creators, mediators, and receptors” (136). The predictions and claims outlined in these final two chapters and encompassed by this revised definition of the discipline are already coming to pass with the recent surge in digital and narratological studies, including the focus on “multimodal” literature and edited collections such as Marie-Laure Ryan and Jan-Noël Thon’s 2014 Storyworlds across Media.\n\nEven as it provides a concise and well-articulated reexamination of the field, Introducing Comparative Literature offers a valuable discussion of the vicissitudes and growth of a reviving discipline. Indeed, the book is supplemented with a brief glossary of major terms, as well as a succinct annotated bibliography for further reading. Likewise, this introduction is especially illuminating for the European reader – and particularly the German reader – who has studied the discipline beyond its main circuits of development within the US and France. Indeed, the book provides a portrait of the field through the US in particular, a country whose history in the 19th and 20th centuries has laid the groundwork for the discipline’s development through its republican and cosmopolitan ethos as well as through its absorption of a vast number of European intellectuals during World War II. Yet despite such cosmopolitanism, the full academic establishment of the discipline according to a set of international standards still seems to be an enterprise for the future. Faced against scholarly arguments regarding postcolonial studies or criticism about the intellectual surplus of world literature and the risk of “academic tourism,” Introducing Comparative Literature lays fundamental groundwork toward such an international establishment. For a discipline that has thus been written off as “dying” not only in Germany and America but across the world, this introduction could provide just the right reinvigoration to revive the important field of comparative literary studies.\n\nAugust 2015\n\nOn Elizabeth Bishop, Colm Tóibín. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015. £14.95. ISBN: 9780691154114.\n\nReviewed by Huiyi Bao, University College Dublin\n\nThe Irish novelist and critic Colm Tóibín’s new book On Elizabeth Bishop, the most recent volume from Princeton’s Writers on Writers series, offers an unorthodox yet deeply inspiring introduction to the life and work of the American poet. What is attempted in the thirteen independent but interrelated chapters of this book is to turn a literary itinerary into a mirror－in the geographical, stylistic and biographical sense. Tóibín traces Bishop’s presence in Nova Scotia, Brazil and Key West, analyzes her style in a composed and hushed tone reminiscent of hers, and contextualizes her writing career against his own. The result is literary criticism in a most readable form, blending empathetic subjectivity with critical accuracy, which shows Tóibín the essayist as, in Oscar Wilde’s phrase, the critic as artist.\n\nHaving been an avid reader of Bishop’s poetry since the age of nineteen, Tóibín’s fascination with his subject is a long and well-grounded one. In his 2002 collection of essays, Love in a Dark Time: Gay Lives from Wilde to Almodóvar, Tóibín devotes an entire chapter to Bishop, entitled “Making the Casual Perfect”. In it he has already pinpointed some of the secrets of her quiet but powerful language: “She shared with Hemingway a fierce simplicity, a use of words in which the emotion appears to be hidden, to lurk mysteriously in the space between the words” (p. 177).i Tóibín continues to explore such “simplicity” and “hiddenness” in copious detail in On Elizabeth Bishop. In a way, On Elizabeth Bishop can be seen as an amplification and rewriting of his Bishop chapter from Love in a Dark Time: quotations from Bishop’ s correspondences with Robert Lowell and her biography are reused, close readings of certain poems are strengthened, with attention paid to some of the same details in Bishop’s work (such as the interjection “heavens” in “Poem”). On the whole, however, On Elizabeth Bishop differs fundamentally from this essay which was written more than ten years ago in both method and tone. Tóibín here is no longer a detached observer, but a participator, a sympathizer, an occasional disciple who glosses Bishop’s poetry with his own life as a homosexual writer, and as someone sharing her rhetorical belief that emotion should never “far exceeds its cause” (p. 8).\n\nThe opening sentence of Tóibín’s book, “She began with the idea that little is known and that much is puzzling,” (p. 1) outlines both Bishop’s style and the content of the first three chapters. He defines preciseness and exactitude as the two essentials of Bishop’s language, tracing these to the her Nova Scotia background and his own roots in Enniscorthy in southeast Ireland, where language was “a way to restrain experience, take it down to a level where it might stay… it was firm and austere in its purpose. Our time on the earth did not give us cause or need to say anything more than was necessary.” (p. 2) Such a minimalist attitude towards language itself underlies the majority of the works by both Tóibín and Bishop, though one writes prose and the other mainly verse.\n\nAnother tonal character that Tóibín accurately captures is her hesitance. “Bishop was never sure” (p. 3), in the form of a tendency to constantly correct herself both in letters and poetry, illustrated particularly through a concise reading of such poems as “Trouvée”, “Poem”, “The End of March” and “Santarém”. This is of course reflected in her very process of writing, which usually consists of much rewriting and revising – in the extreme case of “The Moose”, it took more than twenty years to finish. Tóibín then explores solitude, one of Bishop’s central motifs, in two poems of isolation (“In the Waiting Room” and “Crusoe in England”) and compares her idea of self-identity with that of Gerard Manley Hopkins. When describing Bishop’s style, Tóibín adopts various metaphors of music and arts, some of which grounded in Bishop’s own correspondence.ii After all, she was an earnest painter herself. For instance, she expressed her delight when her poems were compared by a critic to Vermeer’s paintings: “It has been one of my dreams that someday someone would think of Vermeer, without my saying it first, so now I think I can die I a fairly peaceful frame of mind.” (p. 23) The suggestiveness of Dutch paintings, “in the play of light and shadow, in the placing of people and things” (p. 23), is judged by Tóibín to lie similarly beneath the power of Bishop’s late poems. Much is achieved through what is left unsaid.\n\nThe next four chapters are profoundly personal. In Chapter 4, “The Art of Losing”, Tóibín tells the story, in his typically unsentimental but deeply affective way, of how he lost his father as a teenager, and how he developed a stammer as a child which has since kept him in “a close relationship with silence, with things withheld, things known and not said.” (p. 31) Bishop was practically orphaned at an even earlier age: her father died when she was eight months old; when Bishop turned five, her mother was incarcerated in a mental hospital, never to be seen by her again. Aside from such early bereavement, Tóibín records how both he and Bishop travelled around the world but frequently ended up living near the sea—Great Village, Key West, Rio and North Haven for Bishop; Cush, Dublin, Barcelona, Buenos Aires and San Francisco for Tóibín. He wrote about how the sea had shaped their respective sensibility and, in Tóibín’s case, changed the subject of his novel The South without the author being conscious of it. Examples of such can also be found, among others, in the title story of his 2010 short story collection The Empty Family, which contains some of the most metaphysically touching passages about the sea ever written in the English language. One can find Bishop at her best in sea poems such as “The Map”, “The Fish”, “At the Fishhouses” and “The End of March”. Both writers are fascinated by the borderlines between land and water, obsessed with geographical fingertips on the map－islands, straights, peninsulas. As if such isolated locales, despite being places of loss, also provide the ideal observatories for the solitary author to watch, detached but concentrated, and to ruminate on the happenings of the inland, digesting “the sheer sweet intensity in how nature greeted my eyes” (p. 39). Topographical margins become spaces where the lonely penseroso can spend his or her life, like Bishop’s sandpiper (in her poem “Sandpiper”), “pecking for subsistence along the coastlines of the world.” (p. 52)\n\nWhile tracing Bishop’s life in Brazil, Canada and the United States (Chapters 5-7), Tóibín compares her sensitivity with that of other self-exiled writers such as James Joyce, Tóibín’s compatriot. Neither Joyce nor Bishop has returned to Dublin or Nova Scotia, their respective homelands, and Bishop almost certainly shares Joyce’s sense of homelessness, “he does not need to travel to feel homesick; there is no home” (p. 58), resulting in a shared tone of scarcity. “When faith disappears, as it did with these two writers, then the language of transcendence can have a special power because it invokes something that was once familiar, once possible, and is now lost. Faith goes, language remains.” (p. 60) This can be read as Tóibín’s apologia for his own scrupulosity about language: precise details for the precise occasions, with zero toleration for exaggeration of any kind. “As a poet, Bishop stole a great deal from the sound of prose, as a painter might steal from photography.” (p. 47) Her inheritance from, or rather, reinvention of the tonality of prose is later given testimony in her own voice: “It’s almost impossible not to tell the truth in poetry… but in prose it keeps eluding one in the funniest way.” (p. 112)\n\nIn the next five chapters, Tóibín reads Bishop alongside her contemporary poets, with whom she had different amount of personal involvement: Thom Gunn in Chapters 8 and 9, Robert Lowell in Chapters 10 and 11, and Marianne Moore in Chapter 12. It is implied that Gunn is the closest to Bishop in sensibility and in art. They share a reservation about the confessional style, which was the poetic fashion in the 1960s, a reservation that Gunn expresses explicitly: “I don’t like dramatizing myself. I don’t want to be Sylvia Plath. The last person I want to be!” Bishop, when writing to Lowell, her lifelong best friend and considered by many to be the greatest confessional poet ever, voiced her disapproval of Anne Sexton: “There is all the difference in the world, I’m afraid, between her kind of simplicity and that of Life Studies [Lowell’s recent collection], her kind of egocentricity that is simply that…” (p. 138) During those years, Lowell, Plath and Sexton were the namesakes of the confessional school. While selecting materials from the correspondences between Bishop and Lowell to show the former’s carefulness in expressing divergence of opinion from her best friend, Tóibín also makes sure that Bishop is understood as someone who generally deplores self-exposure in writing—who, had she chosen to do so, could have been more dramatic and include more sensational autobiography in her version of Bell Jar than Plath’s, but has instead left her sexuality, childhood traumas and personal life largely out of her works. As Tóibín summarizes in Chapter 10, “Description was a desperate way of avoiding self-description; looking at the world was a way of looking out from the self,” (p. 143) which echoes his earlier observation about Bishop being “more comfortable noting” the elements of pain in landscape (especially seascape) than writing about “the actual pains she lived with, or kept at bay.” (p. 73)\n\nTóibín goes into great detail over the development of what is arguably Bishop’s best known poem “One Art”, observing its formation from a set of notes in prose to the final intricate form of a villanelle. Tóibín regards Bishop’s only villanelle as an epitome of her style, “the villanelle form itself, with its rules and repetitions, a closed, playful form to contain experience rather than a way to release personal grief.” (p. 120) For this reason I have reproduced the metrics of the villanelle form in my Chinese rendition of “One Art”, included below.\n\nThe concluding chapter “North Atlantic Light” is again a “mirroring tribute”, in which Tóibín tells the personal story of how the “looks” of a writer (himself) and a painter (Tony O'Malley) coincide in a picture, which is also the case in Bishop's “Poem”. The book ends with a hesitant and self-correcting syntax typical of Bishop; it turns out to be the kind of criticism which captures the gist of its subject by imitating its tone, rhythm and rhetoric.\n\nOn Elizabeth Bishop tends to repeat itself from time to time—which is perhaps inevitable when a minimalist attitude towards language lies at the centre of its argument, that language should be used as a way of containing, and restraining, emotions, rather than releasing them. It does not attempt at an encyclopedic study on Bishop's writings. It is, rather, a themed study of language’s limits and what can be achieved within its boundary. One-third criticism, one-third biography, one-third autobiography, Tóibín’s unconventional critical prism is held to reflect the development of both Bishop’s art and his own—a study of poetry as an art of becoming, rather than being.\n\nReviewer’s Chinese translation of\n\nOne Art (Elizabeth Bishop)\n\n一种艺术\n\n失去的艺术不难掌握；\n\n如此多的事物似乎都\n\n有意消失，因此失去它们并非灾祸。\n\n每天都失去一样东西。接受失去\n\n房门钥匙的慌张，接受蹉跎而逝的光阴。\n\n失去的艺术不难掌握。\n\n于是练习失去得更快，更多：\n\n地方、姓名、以及你计划去旅行的\n\n目的地。失去这些不会带来灾祸。\n\n我丢失了母亲的手表。看！我的三座\n\n爱屋中的最后一座、倒数第二座不见了。\n\n失去的艺术不难掌握。\n\n我失去两座城，可爱的城。还有更大的\n\n我拥有的某些领地、两条河、一片大洲。\n\n我想念它们，但那并非灾祸。\n\n——即使失去你（戏谑的嗓音，我爱的\n\n一种姿势）我不会撒谎。显然\n\n失去的艺术不算太难掌握\n\n即使那看起来（写下来！）像一场灾祸。\n\nTranslated by Huiyi Bao in 唯有孤独恒常如新 (Hunan Literature and Art Publishing House, 2015).

A scholar of Victorian literature and culture inspired by Foucauldian and New Historicist criticisms, her work involves bridging the gap between historical-political approaches to culture and the more traditional techniques of literary formalism. Her publications include advanced interpretations of rhymes and networks in Victorian literature and world literature, as well as the edited work The Norton Anthology of World Literature. Before elaborating on her proposed method of literary interpretation, Levine stresses Michel Foucault’s scholarly impact and indicates Discipline and Punish as a “revelation” (p. x). Foucault’s study does not presuppose or target the meaning of specific texts, but rather emphasises the ordering principles of discourses which influence the way different texts are organised and received. Different from interpretative theories which place the author’s intention and textual meanings at the centre of discussions, Foucault’s language ontology has provoked many controversies in the field of literary studies. Levine starts her book with a family debate between her and her father (a respected intellectual historian) on literary interpretation. It encapsulates a larger debate between formalism and historicism which fundamentally reshaped the study of literature since the 1960s, and continuously inspired Levine’s academic pursuits. This book proposes a new method – addressing the relationship between cultural artefacts and political arrangements – that renews the formalistic methodology. With this she makes a substantive contribution to the humanistic disciplines which deal with narratives and social politics.\n\nLevine interprets the conception of form as follows: forms universally structure and pattern experience (p. 16); form differs from context as forms “can remain stable over time”; form also differs from genre as they “traverse time and space in different ways” (p. 13). In the introductory section, the current reception of form is summarised as five basic ideas about how forms work: “forms”, “contain”, “differ”, “overlap”, and “intersect”. Forms travel and do political work in particular historical contexts (p. 4-5). The proposed new method looks beyond the currently perceived functions of form to explore collisions of forms – the encounter between forms that “reroutes intention and ideology” (p. 18). Levine draws upon her interdisciplinary engagements to adapt conceptions such as affordance in the field of industrial design (concerning the dynamics of people’s perception of artefacts) (p. 6) and inadequate structures in Brazilian legal politics (p. 17) to entail the possibilities and limits forms place on their constituents. Affordance remains important all through the analysis, since it embodies the transformation of meanings from domains of experience that people know well to domains that they do not understand. We also find out about how forms both constrain and mobilise practices through examining the use and misuses of experiences. The denotation is followed by four research themes (p. 22): 1) the order each form imposes; 2) how knowledge claims itself through organising forms; 3) the relationship between literary and political forms; 4) politics operates through different kinds of forms rather than a single hegemonic system/dominant ideology.\n\nThe above interpretations summarise the conception and functions of form. Levine then details four major literary forms that one can observe in their reading. The whole design of Levine’s new method is to look into these forms in literary practices, to see their interactions, and to understand how these interactions convey discursive regimes and political institutions.\n\nWhole can be seen as a constitutive outside (p. 26) which structures organizations and imaginations of relationships, e.g. the powerful and prevalent wholes – nation-state, Renaissance, etc. Levine employs inspiration from two influential schools – New Criticism and New Historicism – to present the bounded-wholes universally confronted or imagined in literary studies. The former compares a po"
