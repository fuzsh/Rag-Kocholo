Lilly Correspondence, Foster Hall Collection, Center for American Music, University of Pittsburgh\n\nBiography\n\nThe Foster Hall Collection was founded, not by a Pittsburgher or a musician, but by an Indianapolis manufacturer, Josiah Kirby Lilly, Sr. Through his generosity, the collection was presented to the University of Pittsburgh, to be housed permanently in the Foster Memorial, for view and study by the American people. Much of the remarkable revival of interest in Foster was due to the activities of Mr. Lilly. Through his collecting he brought to light hitherto unknown information and acquired materials that might otherwise have been lost. Through his publications he made important contributions to Foster bibliography. Through his gifts to libraries, schools, musical organizations, radio stations, and individuals, Foster music and literature have been widely distributed and new interest in the composer was aroused.\n\nThe love of this Indiana citizen for the music of Stephen Foster may be traced back to his youth, in Greencastle, Indiana, when he used to hear the students at Asbury College (now DePauw University) singing Foster's songs. Throughout his life, Mr. Lilly has enjoyed keenly hearing Foster's music sung or played. But it was not until 1930, when he was about to retire from business, that he became actively interested in the collecting of material relating to Foster. Some time that year, he happened to hear played a set of excellent phonographic recordings of Foster's music. It occurred to him that it might be an interesting hobby to collect the early editions of these songs he loved so well. Acting upon the advice of one of his sons, a bibliophile, Mr. Lilly wrote to several dealers in Americana, from whom he acquired a few first and early editions of Foster's songs. And then, on January 5, 1931, occurred an event which caused him to become a serious collector of Fosteriana, and to build up the most important collection in existence. On that day he acquired from a Boston dealer several hundred early editions of Foster music, including nearly one hundred first editions. He realized that he now had the most important collection of the music of America's great melodist that had yet been brought together. Yet it was obvious that it was far from complete. He had less than half the possible first editions. There must be many hundreds- possibly thousands- of early editions. His collection so far possessed no Foster manuscripts, no letters, none of Stephen's personal possessions, no pictures, no bibliography on the subject. The very incompleteness of his work so far was a challenge! He would build up his collection, fill in the vacancies, learn all he could about the man and his music, work carefully and accurately, and make his hobby a distinct contribution to American music and American history. He possessed, in the suburbs of Indianapolis, a small granite building used as a library and music hall. He placed his collection in this building, which was then named Foster Hall. The collection itself soon became known as the Foster Hall Collection.\n\nMr. Lilly organized the work of solving his collecting problems in businesslike fashion. Not long after the collection was founded, he realized that his interest would soon pass the stage of a one-man hobby, and that assistance would be necessary. New acquisitions were accumulating, source material was awaiting study, certain problems requiring a technical knowledge of music had arisen. The specialized aid he needed was found in the person of Walter R. Whittlesey, an able research worker and musicologist of Washington, D. C., for thirty-five years a member of the staff of the music division of the Library of Congress. As the collection grew in size, other members were added to the Faster Hall staff, in both Indianapolis and Washington. The wdrk was divided into the classifications of acquiring, research, cataloguing, mounting, and correspondence. At one time, eleven persons were engaged in carrying on the work.\n\nMany others, not directly associated with Foster Hall, assisted in the building up of the collection. Dealers in books and music who had Foster material for sale or exchange, fellow-collectors, and all persons interested in Stephen Foster were invited to communicate with Foster Hall. For their benefit an informal magazine, entitled the Foster Hall Bulletin, was published and distributed gratuitously. This bulletin contained news of interest to the Foster collector: the discovery of new songs, reprints of Foster letters, the establishment of memorials to the composer. Each issue contained a list of the songs still needed by the Foster Hall Collection, and the prices offered for them. The relatives of Stephen Foster aided in the work. Mrs. Jessie W. Rose of Pittsburgh, granddaughter of the composer, and Mrs. Evelyn Foster Morneweck of Detroit, daughter of his brother, Morrison Foster, rendered especially valuable service. Original letters and manuscripts, personal possessions of Foster, and other source material not obtainable elsewhere were added to the collection through their cooperation. Moreover, musicians, librarians, curators, students of Americana, sent information and material. Letters were received from all parts of the United States, from Canada and Great Britain, and material poured in from every quarter and in every form.\n\nThe result, after several years of work, was a comprehensive collection of more than ten thousand separate items, carefully catalogued and prepared for preservation and use, including: original manuscripts; facsimiles of manuscripts in other collections; first, early, and modern editions of Foster's music; Foster's own possessions; books relating to the composer in whole or in part; songbooks containing his music; magazine and newspaper articles; pictures and portraits; phonograph records; broadsides; and miscellaneous Fosteriana.\n\nOne of the most fascinating of the Foster Hall studies has been the identification of original works of the composer, as distinguished from adaptations of his melodies. The number of original published songs and compositions discovered so far is 201. In addition to this number, there were over a hundred arrangements and translations which are not classified as original works. The determination of these figures was a more complicated process than the mere counting of titles. It was early discovered that many of the songs credited to Foster were not actually original compositions. Mr. Lilly has coined the word \"Derivata\" for adaptations of Foster melodies- a term which has become a standard part of the vocabulary of Foster collectors. The immense number of these adaptations was a source of confusion to the early students of Foster's work. Under the impression that they were counting only original works, they would include these titles in check lists of the composer's music. At one time, Foster Hall had credited Foster with over 300 original works. Gradually, through the discovery that this figure included \"Derivata,\" the number was brought down to 201.\n\nFoster Hall was a non-commercial institution. No charges of any kind were made for its services or its publications. Its founder did not seek self-advertisement. His only purpose was to revive interest in the music of Stephen Foster. All persons interested in Foster were cordially invited to visit Foster Hall or to correspond with Mr. Lilly. Writers and students seeking source material were especially welcome, and assistance was given to them in the preparation of article, book, or thesis. This liberal policy, for example, contributed to the production in 1934 of a long needed definitive biography of the composer, John Tasker Howard's Stephen Foster, America's Troubadour. This volume, the standard work on the subject, was not published by Mr. Lilly, but he had turned the facilities of his collections, both of materials and of newly-discovered facts of Foster's career, over to Mr. Howard, then already known as an able music historian through his reference book Our American Music. More than fifteen thousand visitors came to Foster Hall during its six years of existence in Indianapolis, not only from Indiana and the Middle West, but from other sections. At least once a week Foster programs were presented at the hall, consisting of a lecture on the composer, a display of the material in the collection, and Foster music by a quartet.\n\nThe publications of Foster Hall were prepared for many uses. The most important was entitled Foster Hall Reproductions of the Songs, Compositions and Arrangements by Stephen Collins Foster. This work is a set of facsimiles of the first (or earliest obtainable) editions of Foster's complete works. Since it serves as an accurate check list, it is a valuable aid to the collector who wishes to know the points determining the first edition of a Foster song. Because of the large number of Foster's works and of the necessity for accurate editing, the checking, engraving, and printing of the Reproductions was an undertaking of considerable magnitude, requiring a year and a half to complete. One thousand sets of the Reproductions were published and presented by Mr. Lilly to libraries throughout the United States and Great Britain. The fact that the Reproductions not only comprise Foster's complete works, but also are facsimiles of the original printings, makes them a unique publication.\n\nAnother widely distributed Foster Hall publication was a handsome reprint of the biographical section of Morrison Foster's work, under the title of My Brother Stephen. Other books and pamphlets, dealing with Foster's life, have been presented to collectors. Songs of Stephen Foster, edited by Will Earhart and Edward B. Birge, is intended primarily for use in schools. It is a collection of more than forty of Foster's best songs. This work has been widely distributed, and multiple editions were published by the University of Pittsburgh. Although prepared chiefly for use by children, adults found this work suitable for their own use. Mr. Lilly also published a number of arrangements of Foster's music. An excellent medley of Foster melodies for concert band was prepared by Luis Guzman, of the United States Marine Band. This work was presented to American high-school and college bands, and to bands throughout Latin America and Europe. The Foster Hall Recordings consisted of phonograph records of all Foster's original works. A few sets of these records have been prepared and presented to such institutions as the Library of Congress. Moreover, radio stations have been furnished phonographic recordings of Foster programs, and arrangements especially adapted for broadcasting purposes. In all his work, Mr. Lilly has attempted to do more than maintain a mere museum of Foster relics. He sought to keep alive the music of Stephen Foster. The Foster Hall publications not only helped to keep alive the best Foster melodies, they have helped to popularize songs of genuine merit, which were not so well known.\n\nAfter he had founded his collection, Mr. Lilly seriously considered what should be done with it eventually. About that time, he heard of the Stephen Foster Memorial, planned by the Tuesday Musical Club and the University of Pittsburgh. There, it seemed to him, was the logical destination for his collection. His offer to present the collection to the Pittsburgh memorial was accepted, and in 1937 it was transferred in its entirety from Indianapolis to its new home. The work of Foster Hall, under the auspices of the University of Pittsburgh, was an uninterrupted continuation of its former activities in Indianapolis. Its facilities are available to student or writer, publications are sent out, schools and clubs are assisted in the preparation of Foster programs, the collection is exhibited to visitors, programs are held in the memorial.\n\nAdapted from \"A Pittsburgh Composer and His Memorial\" by Fletcher Hodges, Jr. (Pittsburgh: The Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania, 1951)\n\nCopyright\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh holds the property rights to the material in this collection, but the copyright may still be held by the original creator/author.

Certain, from Huntsville, AL. From 1931 on Mrs. Certain was one of the main suppliers of sheet music to Foster Hall. Her prices were always reasonable, and her material in good condition.

This dealer, in an attempt to secure material for Lilly, was the first to contact Evelyn Foster Morneweck in hope of purchasing music or Foster memorabilia. Mrs. Morneweck was unwilling to sell, so Drake put her in contact with Lilly. Although Drake did manage to secure some material for the Collection, he seems to have played a far more important role as a contact to other collectors. Drake also sold Lilly the slipcases for the books and other valuable materials in the collection.\n\nDriscoll, J.

Beginning in 1932 Lilly began to contribute unwanted sheet music from the Collection to the Library-- this material was generally not Foster related, but Americana. The library also received copies of the Foster Hall Bulletin and other Hall publications. In 1934 they were given a set of Foster Hall Reproductions.

La Bree was the curator of MOKH Commission when he first contacted Lilly in 1930. He had held the position for 9 years. Upon learning of Foster Hall he tried repeatedly--and unsuccessfully--to have Lilly hire him. In 1931 he was fired from MOKH. According to rumors, he took half of their belongings with him.\n\nLibrary of Congress,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 32\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with the Library of Congress.

Mrs. Lott was not a dealer, but as a life-long resident of Louisville she was acquainted with many of the old families there, and obtained sheet music from them. Her letters are like full-length novels and she sounds quite mad. Over the years she developed a crush on Lilly and continued to write even after her flurry of sales dwindled away. The file for 1933 contained some interesting gossip about Col. La Bree. Mrs. Lott insinuates he stole a good deal of sheet music and other items from the MOKH museum. When Lilly remarried in 1935, Mrs. Lott turned her affections to Mr. Hodges.\n\nLull, Robert W.,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 34\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Robert W.

Madigan from NY, NY. Madigan was a collector of celebrity autographs; he promised to secure samples of Foster's handwriting but never came through.\n\nMeridian Book Shop,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 39\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with the Meridian Book Shop of Indianapolis, IN. Lilly purchased a contemporary edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and other reference works through this shop.\n\nMorneweck, Evelyn Foster,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 40\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Evelyn Foster Morneweck of Detroit, MI, Morrison Foster's daughter. Lilly first contacted her in 1931. For an undisclosed sum she added some of the most vital pieces to the Collection: Foster's manuscript book, his wallet, etc. In 1932-33, Mrs. Morneweck rendered invaluable assistance to J.T. Howard as he prepared America's Troubadour. During this time she also began The Chronicles of Stephen Foster's Family which wouldn't be completed until 1944. Over the years the correspondence grew to several hundred pieces a year. Many items are factual in nature--checking genealogies, etc--but some letters are filled with rumors, gossip and speculation. Lilly and Morneweck became close friends and were quite open with one another. The 1934 folder, for instance, contains fascinating opinions of Henry Ford as he became embroiled in the White Cottage fiasco. Hodges weeded these files after the move to Pittsburgh, feeling that certain letters shouldn't be made available to the public. Other letters, because of the valuable factual material they contain, were removed from this correspondence and placed in the collection.\n\nMorton, Henry P.,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 41\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Henry P. Morton of Owensboro, KY. Mr. Morton was a hymn writer, who was acquainted with Mrs. Welch. Throughout 1931 he promised to go through his correspondence and send (or sell) Lilly letters from Foster's daughter, but he apparently never did so.\n\nMuller, Joseph,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 42\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Joseph Muller of Cloister, NJ. Muller was an artist and ardent collector. Muller first became acquainted with Foster Hall in 1931 and was commissioned by Lilly to do pen and ink portraits of Foster and other significant figures in his life. Over the years a great friendship grew between the Hall staff and Muller. As the friendship grew, so did Muller's importance to the Hall. He did an entire series of portraits (all in the collection) and he also did peripheral research for Lilly. In 1937 Muller published a bibliography of various editions of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Sales were poor and Lilly purchased all the remaining copies and gave them to Muller, who in turn presented them to libraries as gifts. In 1938 Muller was instrumental in located a long-desired first edition of \"Oh Susanna.\"\n\nMy Old Kentucky Home,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 43\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with My Old Kentucky Home in Bardstown, KY. Lilly contacted the museum (which at one time belonged to a relative of the Foster family) and donated several items, hoping to develop contacts with other collectors. The place had nothing at all to offer.\n\nN,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 44\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Nadle's Book Nook; Nedwick's Book Store; New York Times;\n\nNagy, Charles,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 45\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Charles Nagy of Philadelphia, PA. During the early years of the collection, Nagy sold a quantity of material to Lilly, including over 300 broadsides. As Lilly became more experienced he realized Nagy's prices were inflated and discontinued doing business with him.\n\nO,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 46\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Albert E.

This is an important file. Papers in these folders (esp. those for 1934) outline the terms under which the Foster Hall Collection would be transferred to the Pittsburgh Memorial. The files include copies of insurance policies, contracts for the Guzman Band Arrangement and the school songbook, as well as details concerning Hodges' employment and maintenance of the collection.\n\nR,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 51\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Carrie J.

Roberts; Rosenbach Company; Mr. Ben Roth; Rough Notes Co.; Wells Rupert; Anthony Russo;\n\nRandall, C.B.,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 52\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with C.B. Randall of New Castle, PA. A business card in the file indicated that Randall was with the Smithsonian. He was, in fact, a fraud and a con man. By means which are not indicated here, he was commissioned by Jessie Rose to handle the sale of SCF's manuscript book. Randall embezzled $3000 of the payment. The last item in the file, from Lilly, threatens a lawsuit, which apparently never took place. The man dropped out of sight in 1931, but several years later, in 1937, Randall approached Joseph Muller offering a first edition of \"Susanna\". Muller excitedly reported the offer to Lilly, who warned him off. It was from a different source that Muller helped Hodges acquire a first edition of the same song in 1938.\n\nRose, Mrs. Jessie Welsh,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 53\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Mrs. Jessie Welsh Rose of Pittsburgh, PA. The only grandchild of SCF, Mrs. Rose and her mother, Marion Welch (sometimes Welsh) were contacted by Lilly soon after he began his collection. The family was poor and happy to sell some of Foster's most important belongings, but they were interested only in profit. In addition, there was a great deal of disharmony between various branches of the family, and this bitterness runs throughout the correspondence. Lilly remained on polite, if cool terms with them because of their value as direct descendants. The file gives insight on many of the people important to the development of the collection. Mrs. Rose was a great gossiper, and while her information was not always correct, it was certainly interesting.\n\nS,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 54\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Mrs. Albert Sackett; Max Schaffer; G.

Lilly contacted this firm when he first began collecting. Although their prices were very inflated and they apparently received much of their stock from Mr. Nagy, Lilly depended on them heavily at first. After a short time Lilly took his business elsewhere.\n\nT,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 1, folder 56\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Robert Taylor; Herman E.

Townsend was exuberant, enthusiastic, unscrupulous, and tenacious, with a great many contacts with the old established families in Lexington. Townsend grew to feel that he had a personal stake in both Lilly and the Collection after it had become established (especially in the case of J.T. Howard). In addition, Townsend was a rumor-monger, often inaccurate. Very little of value came to Lilly through this man, but he was the one to supply a first edition of \"The Social Orchestra.\"\n\nU,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 2, folder 58\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with U.S. Government;\n\nUnger, C.W.,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 2, folder 59\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with C.W.

Whittlesey of Washington DC. Whittlesey was an employee of the Library of Congress. His initial contacts with Lilly consisted of answering various questions from the Foster Hall staff. In 1932 he was forced to retire from the Library, but because by that time he was engaged in research for Lilly he was allowed to maintain a desk there and continue his work. After his retirement, Lilly began paying him a monthly allowance. Whittlesey's work was to aid in the systematic coordination of Lilly's collection, verification of facts (copyright, etc.), checking over the reproductions for flaws, assisting E.F. Morneweck in the writing of The Chronicles, mounting such ephemeral material as newspaper clippings, and so on. In short, his high degree of professionalism made him invaluable to the development of the collection. When he died in 1936, his daughter (Katherine Copley), who was already assisting him, remained in Lilly's employment and continued her father's work.\n\nWright, Edith A.,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 2, folder 64\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Edith a Wright of Washington, DC. Whittlesey submitted this dealer's name to Lilly. She became a treasure trove of valuable first editions and early sheet music.

She was not a dealer, but as a life-long resident of Louisville who was acquainted with many of the old families there, and obtained sheet music from them. Her letters are like full-length novels and she sounds quite mad. Over the years she developed a crush on Lilly and continued to write even after her flurry of sales dwindled away. The file for 1933 contains some interesting gossip about Col. La Bree. Mrs. Lott insinuates he stole a good deal of sheet music and other items from the MOKH museum. When Lilly remarried in 1935, Mrs. Lott turned her affections to Mr. Hodges.\n\nCertain, Mrs. Henry J.,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 2, folder 77\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Mrs. Henry J.

Mrs. Morneweck was unwilling to sell, so Drake put her in contact with Lilly. Although Drake did manage to secure some material for the Collection, he seems to have played a far more important role as a contact to other collectors. Drake also sold Lilly the slipcases for the books and other valuable materials in the collection.\n\nE,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 2, folder 87\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Mrs. Will Earhart; Etude Music Magazine; A.J.

This company received a large amount of business from Foster hall. They printed bulletins, stationary, and small chapbooks issued by Lilly. They did high-quality work and were on good terms with Lilly until right before the collection was transferred--at that time Mr. Krieg, the man with whom Lilly had all his dealings, retired and the new manager began raising prices causing Lilly to withdraw his business from the company.\n\nHoward, John Tasker,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 3, folder 100\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with John Tasker Howard. In 1932 Howard was a musicologist with one book to his credit. He earned additional income by lecturing around the country and hosting a radio show. Howard and Lilly met for the first time in November 1932. By December, 1932, Howard was working on the Foster biography, receiving a small stipend from Lilly for support during his research. Howard was rapidly accept by the Foster Hall staff. The biography was published in January 1934. The correspondence during this year is rich with gossip as well as opinions and reviews of the many plays and movies that were being produced that season. Howard was having legal difficulties at this time. His publishers were withholding permission for Howard to dramatize the biography which he hoped to have Gene Raymond direct.

An artist and ardent collector, Muller first because acquainted with Foster Hall in 1931 and was commissioned by Lilly to do pen and ink portraits of Foster and other significant figures in his life. Over the years a great friendship grew between the Hall staff and Muller. As the friendship grew, so did Muller's importance to the Hall. He did an entire series of portraits (all in the collection) and he also did peripheral research for Lilly. In 1937 Muller published a bibliography of various editions of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Sales were poor and Lilly purchased all the remaining copies and gave them to Muller, who in turn presented them to libraries as gifts. In 1938 Muller was instrumental in locating a long-desired first edition of \"Oh Susanna.\"\n\nN,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 3, folder 122\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with National Geographic Society; Frank Neeld; Rev.

The only grandchild of SCF, Mrs. Rose and her mother, Marion Welch (sometimes Welsh) were contacted by Lilly soon after he began his collection. The family was poor and happy to sell some of Foster's most important belongings, but they were interested only in profit. In addition, there was a great deal of disharmony between various branches of the family, and this bitterness runs throughout the correspondence. Lilly remained on polite, if cool terms with them because of their value as direct descendants. The file gives insight on many of the people important to the development of the collection. Mrs. Rose was a great gossiper, and while her information was not always correct, it was certainly interesting.\n\nSA SC,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 4, folder 134\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Sabins Engraving Co.; Dr. Clarence G.

Townsend was exuberant, enthusiastic, unscrupulous, and tenacious, with a great many contacts with the old established families in Lexington. Townsend grew to feel that he had a personal stake in both Lilly and the Collection after it had become established (especially in the case of J.T. Howard). In addition, Townsend was a rumor-monger, often inaccurate. Very little of value came to Lilly through this man, but he was the one to supply a first edition of \"The Social Orchestra.\"\n\nUV,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 4, folder 146\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Uhler, A.M.; Unger, C.W.; William Treat Upton; Union Theological Seminary; Vandaworker Club; John VanMale; Van Norman Book Co.; Milton Vaughan; Robert H.

Whittlesey was an employee of the Library of Congress. His initial contacts with Lilly consisted of answering various questions from the Foster Hall staff. In 1932 he was forced to retire from the Library, but because by that time he was engaged in research for Lilly he was allowed to maintain a desk there and continue his work. After his retirement, Lilly began paying him a monthly allowance. Whittlesey's work was to aid in the systematic coordination of Lilly's collection, verification of facts (copyright, etc.), checking over the reproductions for flaws, assisting E.F. Morneweck in the writing of The Chronicles, mounting such ephemeral material as newspaper clippings, and so on. In short, his high degree of professionalism made him invaluable to the development of the collection. When he died in 1936, his daughter (Katherine Copley), who was already assisting him, remained in Lilly's employment and continued her father's work.\n\nWO WR WU WY,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 5, folder 150\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Wohlgemuth; Myron Wood; R.W.

Her letters are like full-length novels and she sounds quite mad. Over the years she developed a crush on Lilly and continued to write even after her flurry of sales dwindled away. The file for 1933 contains some interesting gossip about Col. La Bree. Mrs. Lott insinuates that he stole a good deal of sheet music and other items from the MOKH museum.

This was the company that published Howard's biography of Foster. Because Lilly had subsidized Howard during his research, he also had a great deal of say over the final form of the book.

This dealer, in an attempt to secure material for Lilly, was the first to contact Evelyn Foster Morneweck in hope of purchasing music or Foster memorabilia. Mrs. Morneweck was unwilling to sell, so Drake put her in contact with Lilly. Although Drake did manage to secure some material for the Collection, he seems to have played a far more important role as a contact to other collectors. Drake also sold Lilly the slipcases for the books and other valuable materials in the collection.\n\nE,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 5, folder 177\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with H.C.

This company received a large amount of business from Foster Hall. They printed bulletins, stationary, and small chapbooks issued by Lilly. They did high-quality work and were on good terms with Lilly until right before the collection was transferred--at that time Mr. Krieg, the man with whom Lilly had all his dealings, retired and the new manager began raising prices causing Lilly to withdraw his business from the company.\n\nHoward, John Tasker,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 6, folder 191\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with John Tasker Howard of Glen Ridge, NJ. In 1932 Howard was a musicologist with one book to his credit. He earned additional income by lecturing around the country and hosting a radio show. Howard and Lilly met for the first time in Nov, 1932. By Dec. 1932 Howard was working on the Foster biography, receiving a small stipend from Lilly for support during his research. Howard was rapidly accepted by the Foster Hall staff. The biography was published in Jan. 1934. The correspondence during this year is rich with gossip as well as opinions and reviews of the many plays and movies which were being produced that season. Howard was having legal difficulties at this time. His publishers were withholding permission for Howard to dramatize the biography which he hoped to have Gene Raymond direct. The 1935-38 correspondence holds an enormous quantity of letters about the Foster house controversy, verification that Foster lived in Hoboken; Howard's arrangements of Foster's works; Maskell Ewing's death. Also a lot of notes between Howard and Hodges pointing out errors in the biography.\n\nHO HU HY,\n\nContainers\n\nbox 6, folder 192\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nCorrespondence with Hutchinson Public Library; J.C.
