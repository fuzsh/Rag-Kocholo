        "text": "John R. Kline (1891-1955), Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania, 1916.\n\nA.B. (1912) Muhlenburg; A.M. (1914) Pennsylvania. Thesis title: \"Double elliptic geometry in terms of point and order\", 19 pages in journal article.\n\nKline was Professor of Mathematics at Penn from 1920 (the year Moore returned to Texas) until his death in 1955. He was Chair of the Department from 1933 to 1954. He was a Guggenheim Fellow (GÃ¶ttingen) in 1926-27. He was Associate Editor of the Transactions AMS, Bulletin AMS, American Journal of Mathematics at various times and served on the editorial board of the AMS Colloquium Publications. He was Associate Secretary of the AMS from 1933 to 1936 and Secretary (AMS) from 1941 to 1950. He directed the Ph.D. theses of thirteen students, including National Research Fellows W. L. Ayres, H. M. Gehman, N.E. Rutt, and Leo Zippin. Several of his students went to Austin in their Fellowship years. He also directed the Ph.D. theses of W.W. Dudley and W.W.S. Claytor, the second and third African American mathematicians to earn their Ph.D.'s. (In this instance, the sins of the father were not visited on the son). On his recommendation, Claytor went to the University of Michigan on a post-doctoral fellowship, where he worked with R. L. Wilder. After this, he was offered the opportunity for further study at Princeton but declined it in order to accept a position at Howard University, where he had a distinguished career. Kline was the thesis director of record for Lida K. Barrett, but she began her work with R.L. Moore at Texas; the thesis problems were suggested by Kline after her move to the University of Pennsylvania and essentially solved under his direction. After Kline suffered a heart attack the work was completed under the direction of R.D. Anderson, who had joined the faculty at Pennsylvania in 1948. Perhaps Kline's best known student was Leo Zippin, who wrote with Deane Montgomery the classic monograph Topological Transformation Groups. The work described in this treatise, together with work done by Andrew Gleason, provides a solution to Hilbert's Fifth Problem. Throughout his career, Kline maintained regular contact with RLM; for example, he was instrumental in getting Mary-Elizabeth Hamstrom to go to Austin for her graduate studies. Kline wrote only one joint paper, and it was with RLM, who also wrote no other joint work. Title: \"On the most general closed and bounded plane point set through which it is possible to pass an arc.\"\n\nGeorge H. Hallett (1895-1985), Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania, 1918.\n\nA.B. (1915) Haverford College; A.M. (1916) Harvard. Thesis title: \"Linear order in three dimensional Euclidean and double elliptical spaces\".\n\nHallett did not enter academia; instead, he had a long career in public service, beginning with a post as Secretary of the Proportional Representation League. In 1937 he wrote Proportional Representation: The Key to Democracy. He taught courses in government at several colleges in New York City: Brooklyn, Hunter, NYU, and CCNY. He was given special awards from LaGuardia Memorial Association (1963), New York City Club (1964), and Citizens Union (1947, 1969). During the Second World War he was active in the Committee for Civilian Defense. In his book Creative Teaching: The Heritage of R.L. Moore, D. R. Traylor quotes Hallett as saying, \"... I think such success as I've had in the field of government probably has a good deal to do with that [ Moore's teaching] - because they don't catch me up very often in theories of logic in bills, or different parts of bills, that don't hang together.\"\n\nAnna M. Mullikin (1893-1975), Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania, 1922.\n\nA.B. (1915) Goucher College; A.M. (1919) U. Pennsylvania. Thesis title: \"Certain theorems relating to plane connected point sets\".\n\nWhen Moore went to Texas in 1920, Mullikin went there, as well, to continue her work with him. Her thesis, \"Certain theorems relating to plane connected point sets,\" received considerable attention. It overlapped somewhat with some of Janiszewski's work (which had been published in Polish). Mullikin went on to a long career as a high school teacher in Pennsylvania; Mary-Elizabeth Hamstrom was one of her students. During the Second World War she was active in Civilian Defense. In 1952, Goucher College, where she received a B.A. in 1915, honored her with an alumnae achievement citation. [See also Zitarelli, David, and Bartlow, Thomas L.,\"Who was Miss Mullikin?\" American Mathematical Monthly 116(2009): 99-114.]\n\nRaymond L. Wilder (1896-1982 ), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1923.\n\nB.Phil. (1920) Brown; M.Sc. (1921) Brown. Thesis title: \"Concerning continuous curves\", (62 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.J. Ettlinger, A.A. Bennett, H.Y. Benedict, M.B. Porter.\n\nWilder was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He served as President of the American Mathematical Society in 1955-1956 and as President of the Mathematical Association of America in 1965-1966. The bulk of his academic career was at the University of Michigan, where he directed twenty-five Ph.D. students. In his honor the University of Michigan established the Raymond L. Wilder Professorship of Mathematics. Before going to Michigan he taught at Ohio State for two years, and after retiring from Michigan he taught at UC Santa Barbara. He was the AMS Colloquium Lecturer in 1943 (The Topology of Manifolds was published in the Colloquium series), and the Gibbs Lecturer in 1969. He wrote Introduction to the Foundations of Mathematics, The Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study, and Mathematics as a Cultural System. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Award of the MAA and the Lester R. Ford Award. He has observed that he went from Brown to Texas to study actuarial mathematics. He recalled that Moore did not at first want him as a student ( \"I was a Yankee\") and did not really accept him as a member of the class until he had proved the arcwise connectedness theorem. Wilder was one of the developers of algebraic topology. He maintained close contacts with Moore and also with Lefschetz at Princeton. Wilder was largely responsible for recognition and development of the abilities of Norman Steenrod (See the extensive correspondence between them at the Center for American History at the University of Texas). He also had influence on E.G. Begle and mathematics education reform.\n\nRenke G. Lubben (1898-1980), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1925.\n\nB.A. (1921) Texas. Thesis title: \"The double-elliptic case of the Lie-Riemann-Helmholtz-Hilbert problem of the foundations of geometry\", (102 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, M.B. Porter, H.J. Ettlinger, G. Watts Cunningham, Edward L. Dodd, A. P. Brogan, Albert A. Bennett.\n\nLubben's Ph.D. thesis gave the solution to the then last remaining problem in the foundations of geometry. He was an independent discoverer of maximal compactifications of completely regular spaces, although priority in publication is assigned to Stone and Cech. He was a National Research Fellow (Gouml;ttingen) in 1926-27. He served on the Texas mathematics faculty until his retirement.\n\nGordon T. Whyburn (1904-1969), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1927.\n\nA.B. (1925) Texas; M.A. (Chemistry) (1926), Texas. Thesis title: \"Concerning continua in the plane\", (57 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, M.B. Porter, H.J. Ettlinger, Edward L. Dodd, J.R. Bailey, H.L. Lochte, Arnold Romberg.\n\nWhyburn was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was President of the American Mathematical Society in 1953-54. After leaving Texas, he taught at Johns Hopkins, but his principal academic appointment was at the University of Virginia, where he and E. J. McShane were brought in to develop a graduate program in mathematics. He served as Chair of the department from 1934 until 1966. He was the AMS Colloquium Lecturer in 1940; his Colloquium book Analytic Topology resulted. He also published Topological Analysis. He received the Chauvenet Prize of the MAA. He directed thirty-two Ph.D. students, many of whom had distinguished academic careers. Whyburn studied chemistry as an undergraduate and in graduate school, obtaining an M.A. in Chemistry before deciding to concentrate on mathematics.\n\nJohn H. Roberts (1906-1997), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1929.\n\nA.B. (1927) Texas. Thesis title: \"Concerning non-dense plane continua\", (47 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, M.B. Porter, H.S. Vandiver, H.J. Ettlinger, Edward L. Dodd, J.W. Calhoun, A.E. Cooper.\n\nOn leaving Texas, Roberts went to the University of Pennsylvania for a year, where he worked with J.R. Kline. He went to Duke University in 1931, and he remained there until his retirement. During the Second World War he served in the United States Navy. He directed twenty-four Ph.D. students, a number of whom are prominent mathematicians. He was Director of Graduate Studies in the Department from 1948 until 1960 and managing editor of the Duke Mathematical Journal from 1951 until 1960. He also served as Chair of the Department. His research centered at first on continua, then on dimension theory.\n\nClark M. Cleveland (1892-1969), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1930.\n\nB.S.in C.E. (1917) Mississippi. Thesis title: \"On the existence of acyclic curves satisfying certain conditions with respect to a given continuous curve\", Signers: R.L. Moore, M.B. Porter, Edward L. Dodd, H.J. Ettlinger, J.M. Kuehner, Arnold Romberg.\n\nCleveland joined the Department of Applied Mathematics and Astronomy at Texas and remained there throughout his academic career. He became Chair of the Department of Mathematics in 1953 when the Department of Applied Mathematics and Astronomy and the Department of Pure Mathematics were merged.\n\nJoe L. Dorroh (1904-1989), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1930.\n\nB.A. (1926) Texas; M.A. (1927) Texas. Thesis title: \"Some metric properties of descriptive planes\", (38 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.S. Vandiver, M.B. Porter, H.J. Ettlinger, J.M. Kuehner, S. Leroy Broun.\n\nDorroh was a National Research Fellow at Cal Tech in 1930-31 and at Princeton in 1931-32. He taught at LSU from 1942 to 1946 and at Illinois Tech in 1946-47. He then went to Texas A&I until his retirement in 1966. He was Chair there from 1952 until his retirement.\n\nCharles W. Vickery (1906-1982), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1932.\n\nB.A. (1928) Texas. Thesis title: \"Vickery: Spaces in which there exist uncountable convergent sequences of points\", (37 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, M.B. Porter, H.S. Vandiver, Edward L. Dodd, E.T. Mitchell, A.P. Brogan.\n\nHe worked as a statistician and economist for the State of Texas and the U.S. Government. Following the Second World War he taught at LSU but returned to work for the government and in the aircraft industry. He published in Econometrica, Bull. AMS, and the Amer. Math. Monthly. He was a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society.\n\nEdmund C. Klipple (1906-1992), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1932.\n\nB.A. (1926) Texas. Thesis title: \"Spaces in which there exist contiguous points\", (42 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.S. Vandiver, M.B. Porter, Edward L. Dodd, H.J. Ettlinger, Homer V. Craig.\n\nKlipple joined the Texas A&M mathematics faculty in 1935, and he stayed there until his retirement in 1971. He was Chair of the department for many years; he resigned as Chair in 1966 when asked by the Dean to rank his faculty in order, 1-40. In 1968 he was given a Faculty Distinguished Achievement Award. He nurtured a good many students who later became well known mathematicians, including Peter Lax, Efraim Armendariz, and William T. Guy.\n\nRobert E. Basye (1908-2000), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1933.\n\nB.A. (1929) Missouri; M.A. (1931) Princeton. Thesis title: \"Simply connected sets\", (26 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, M.B. Porter, H.S. Vandiver, P.M. Batchelder, H.J. Ettlinger, R.V. Haskell.\n\nBasye's principal academic appointment was at Texas A&M University, from 1940 until his retirement in 1968. After retirement, he devoted his full time to rose research, becoming a renowned genetic hybridizer and grower. Among his many achievements was Basye's Purple Rose. He served on active duty in the U.S. Naval Reserve during the Second World War.\n\nF. Burton Jones (1910-1999), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1935.\n\nB.A. (Chemistry) (1932) Texas. Thesis title: \"Concerning R.L. Moore's Axiom 5-1\", (80 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, M.B. Porter, H.J. Ettlinger, Edward L. Dodd, E.P. Tchoch, W.A. Felsing.\n\nAs was the case with Whyburn before him, Jones was a chemistry student who changed to work with Moore. He stayed on the Texas faculty until 1950, serving as chair. He later served as Chair at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) and at the University of California, Riverside. During the war years he worked for the U.S. Navy in Cambridge, on methods for locating and identifying submarines. He directed fifteen Ph.D. students, many of whom became well known mathematicians. At Texas he helped develop a number of students; in fact, Mary Ellen Rudin has described him as the mathematician who had the greatest influence on her development. After leaving Texas he continued to provide counsel and support and guidance to younger mathematicians trained in the Texas tradition. He worked in continua and in abstract spaces. He originated the famous normal Moore space problem. In 1975 he received a Fulbright-Hays Fellowship to visit Canterbury University in Christchurch, New Zealand. He was twice a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study and spent two summers in Europe on the National Academy of Sciences Exchange Program.\n\nRobert L. Swain (1913-1962), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1941.\n\nB.A. (1934) Reed College. Thesis title: \"I. Proper and reductive transformations. II. Continua obtained from sequences of simple chains of point sets. III. Distance axioms in Moore spaces. IV. Linear metric space. V. A space in which there may exist uncountable convergent sequences of points\", (101 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.S. Vandiver, M.B. Porter, P.M. Batchelder, Edward L. Dodd, H.J. Ettlinger.\n\nSwain's major academic appointments were at the University of Wisconsin (Madison), Teacher's College at New Paltz, and Rutgers University. In 1955-56 he held a Ford Foundation Faculty Fellowship.\n\nRobert H. Sorgenfrey (1915-1996), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1941.\n\nB.A. (1937) UCLA. Thesis title: \"Concerning triodic continua\", (56 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, F. Burton Jones, H.S. Vandiver, P.M. Batchelder, Edward L. Dodd, H.J. Ettlinger.\n\nW.M. Whyburn, who was Department Head at UCLA at the time of Sorgenfrey's undergraduate work, arranged for him to study with Moore. Sorgenfrey was on the faculty at UCLA from 1942 until his retirement in January of 1979. In 1963 he received the UCLA Distinguished Teaching Award, the first mathematician to do so. He is known for his work in general topology, especially in the production of counter-examples. He directed four Ph.D. students. After retirement he wrote several successful high school mathematics textbooks.\n\nHarlan C. Miller (1896-1981), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1941.\n\nB.A. (1916) Wellesley; M.A. (1930) Columbia. Thesis title: \"On compact unicoherent continua\", (72 pages). Signers: Miller: R.L. Moore, R.G. Lubben, H.S. Vandiver, P.M. Batchelder, Edward L. Dodd, H.J. Ettlinger.\n\nPrior to her graduate program, Miller taught for a number of years at the Hockaday school in Dallas. After her Ph.D., she taught at Winthrop College and North Texas for one year each before joining the faculty at Texas Woman's University, where she spent the rest of her academic career. She was active in University administration there, serving as Director of Mathematics. She helped direct Lida K. Barrett toward studying with RLM. She advised J.R. Boyd in his graduate program. He later developed the Moore-style mathematics program at Guilford College. Texas Woman's University has an annual Harlan Miller Lecture Series.\n\nGail S. Young (1915-1999), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1942.\n\nB.A. (1939) Texas. Thesis title: \"Concerning the outer boundaries of certain connected domains\", (70 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, F. Burton Jones, R.G. Lubben, Edward L. Dodd, H.S. Vandiver, N. Coburn, H.J. Ettlinger.\n\nYoung held appointments at Purdue, Michigan, Tulane, Rochester, Case-Western Reserve, Wyoming, and Columbia. He was Chair at at least two of these. He served as President of the Mathematical Association of America in 1970-71. He won the Distinguished Service Award of the MAA in 1987.He worked with the School Mathematics Study Group and with the Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics. He directed fourteen Ph.D. students, with one of whom (John Hocking) he wrote the successful textbook Topology. Another was Beauregard Stubblefield, who has engagingly described in an interview conducted by Albert C. Lewis for the Center for American History how he became aware of Moore's principles of teaching through R.L. Wilder, Gail Young, and E.E. Moise, three of Moore's students at Michigan at the time of Stubblefield's graduate program.\n\nR.H. Bing (1914-1986), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1945.\n\nB.S. (1935) Southwest Texas; M.Ed. (1938) Texas. Thesis title: \"Concerning simple plane webs\", (34 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, Edwin Ford Beckenbach, H.J. Ettlinger, H.S. Vandiver, P. M. Batchelder, C.T. Gray, J.G. Umstattd, Hob Gray.\n\nBing's principal academic appointments were at Wisconsin (1943-1973) and Texas (1973-1978). He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He served as President of the American Mathematical Society in 1977-78 and President of the Mathematical Association of America in 1963-64. His work was centered at first on continuum theory, then on 3-manifolds. He is also well known for the Bing metrization theorem. He was the Colloquium Lecturer in 1970, resulting in his Colloquium book Topology of 3-manifolds. The American Mathematical Society published, in two volumes, the Collected Papers of R.H. Bing. He directed thirty-eight Ph.D. students, many of whom developed substantial reputations. His background was that of a high school teacher and football coach. When F.B. Jones was asked whether RLM at first did not recognize Bing's talent, Jones replied, with a twinkle in his eye, that \"In later years Moore didn't remember it that way.\" Bing served as Chair of the Wisconsin and of the Texas Mathematics Departments. He was responsible for the MAA's film Challenge in the Classroom, which was about Moore's teaching methods.\n\nEdwin E. Moise (1919-1998), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1947.\n\nB.A. (1940) Tulane. Thesis title: \"An indecomposable continuum which is homeomorphic to each of its nondegenerate subcontinua\", (24 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.S. Wall, F. Burton Jones, H.J. Ettlinger.\n\nMoise's dissertation involved the pseudo-arc, a term he coined. It was used to solve an old problem of Knaster. He held academic appointments at Michigan, Harvard, and Queen's College, CUNY. It was at Michigan that he began his most important work on 3-manifolds, culminating in his proof, completed at the Institute for Advanced Study, that every 3-manifold can be triangulated. He went to Harvard as James B. Conant Professor of Mathematics and Education. From 1955 to 1958 he was a member of the Executive Committee of the International Comission on Mathematical Instruction. He served as Vice-President of the American Mathematical Society in 1973-74 and as President of the Mathematical Association of America in 1967-1968. He wrote a number of successful textbooks, and a treatise on Geometric Topology in Dimensions 2 and 3. He directed three Ph.D. students. In his last years he devoted his attention to 19th century English poetry. During the Second World War he served in the U.S. Navy as a Japanese translator.\n\nRichard D. Anderson (1922-2008), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1948.\n\nB.A. (1941) Minnesota. Thesis title: \"Concerning upper semi-continuous collections of continua\", (22 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, F. Burton Jones, H.S. Wall, H.J. Ettlinger, H.S. Vandiver.\n\nAnderson was recruited by Moore to do graduate work in the Fall of 1941. His graduate program was interrupted by a ture of duty in the U.S. Navy, where he served at sea. His principal academic appointments were at Pennsylvania and LSU. As a number of Moore's other students, including Bing, Jones, Moise, and Burgess, he held appointments at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His work at first centered around the geometric topology of continua. He subsequently was largely responsible, along with his students, for developing infinite-dimensional topology. He directed ten Ph.D. students at LSU and, as noted earlier, contributed to the direction of Lida Barrett at Pennsylvania. A number of his students have had distinguished careers. He served as Vice-President of the American Mathematical Society in 1972-73 and as President of the Mathematical Association of America in 1981-82. He received the Distinguished Service Award of the MAA. He has in more recent years devoted his major efforts to reform in mathematics education, more generally, in science education. He is currently Senior Consultant to the NSF sponsored Louisiana Systems Initiatives Program.\n\nMary Ellen (Estill) Rudin (1924-2013), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1949.\n\nB.A. (1944) Texas. Thesis title: \"Concerning abstract spaces\", (27 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.J. Ettlinger, H.S. Wall, F. Burton Jones, E.F. Mitchell, David L. Miller.\n\nRudin's principal academic appointments were at Duke, where she met Walter Rudin, Rochester, and Wisconsin, from which she retired as Grace Chisolm Young Professor of Mathematics. She served as Vice-President of the American Mathematical Society in 1980-81 and has been very active in AMS affairs and committee work. Her research has been in set-theoretic topology, especially using axiomatic set theory. She has, as C.E. Aull has noted, ushered in the Rudin Era in general topology. She has directed sixteen Ph.D. students and is largely responsible for directing the Ph.D. research of several others, including Judy Roitman and William Fleissner at UC Berkeley.\n\nNote: In their article \"By their fruits shall ye know them: some remarks on the interaction of general topology with other areas of mathematics\", appearing in History of Topology, edited by I.M. James, Elsevier, 1999, Teun Koetsier and Jan van Mill write:\n\nIn that period general topology rather unexpectedly succeeded in solving several difficult problems outside its own area of research, in functional analysis and in geometric and algebraic topology. ...There were in that period at least two major developments in general topology that revolutionized the field: the creations of infinite-dimensional topology and set theoretic topology. It was mainly due to the efforts of Dick Anderson and Mary Ellen Rudin that these fields have played such a dominant role in general topology ever since.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Anderson and Rudin comprised a two person class under Moore in the immediate post-war years.\n\nNote that of the preceding five students, four became President of the MAA and four became vice-president of the AMS. One might wonder whether this is duplicated by any other successive group of five students by any one thesis advisor.\n\nCecil E. Burgess (1920-2004), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1951.\n\nB.S. (1941) West Texas. Thesis title: \"Concerning continua and their complementary domains in the plane\", (38 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.S. Wall, H.S. Vandiver, H.J. Ettlinger.\n\nBurgess's graduate program was also interrupted by service in the U.S. Navy. After leaving Texas, he went to the University of Utah, where he remained throughout his career, except for leaves, which he usually spent working with R. H. Bing. Most of his work, and that of his students, has been centered on Bing-style topology. He directed ten Ph.D. students, and some of them are quite prominent. He served for a number of years as Chair of the Department.\n\nB.J. Ball (1925-1996), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1952.\n\nB.A. (1948) Texas. Thesis title: \"Concerning continuous and equicontinuous collections of arcs\", (36 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.S. Wall, R.G. Lubben, H.J. Ettlinger, Homer V. Craig.\n\nBall entered the Navy before getting his BA. On his return in 1946 he moved into Moore's graduate program. His major academic appointments were at Virginia and Georgia. He served as Chair at Georgia for a number of years. His work was in continuum theory, general topology, and, in later years, shape theory. He directed eight Ph.D. students and contributed to the direction of many others.\n\nEldon Dyer (1929-1993), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1952.\n\nB.A. (1947) Texas; B.S. (1947) Texas. Thesis title: \"Certain conditions under which the sum of the elements of a continuous collection of continua is an arc\", (14 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.S. Wall, R.G. Lubben, H.J. Ettlinger, Homer V. Craig.\n\nDyer's academic appointments included Georgia, Johns Hopkins, Chicago, Rice, and CUNY, from which he retired as Distinguished Professor in 1991. He chaired the Department of Mathematics at CUNY, Center for Graduate Studies 1967-1970. He is best known for his work in algebraic topology and for his six Ph.D. students, among whom is Robion Kirby. As were Wilder and Bing, he was a consulting editor for the Encyclopedia Britannica. He held a Sloan Fellowship in 1960-62 and an NSF Post-Doctoral Fellowship in 1955-56. On two occasions he was a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He served as Editor of the Proceedings AMS 1960-65 and as Associate Editor Transactions AMS.\n\nMary-Elizabeth Hamstrom (1927â2009), Ph.D., University of Texas, 1952.\n\nB.A. (1948) Pennsylvania. Thesis title: \"Concerning webs in the plane\", (35 pages). Signers: R.L. Moore, H.S. Wall, R.G. Lubben, H.J. Ettlinger, Homer V. Craig.\n\nHamstrom's principal academic appointment was at the University of Illinois. Her research was mostly in geometric topology. She directed nine Ph.D. students. Before going to Austin Hamstrom had been taught by two of Moore's earlier students: Anna Mullikin in high school and J.R. Kline at Penn.
