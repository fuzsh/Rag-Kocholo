        "text": "Building relationships and partnerships across campus is a critical part of being an effective career services leader. But sometimes it's hard to know where to start. ðŸ”· Who do you start with? ðŸ”· How do you reach out? ðŸ”· What do you say? ðŸ”· How do you leverage those relationships? These are just a few of the questions we recently asked Junior Delgado, a longtime career services leader at Westfield State University and an expert in building allies across campus. In a recent article, we break down Junior's best advice and top strategies ðŸ‘‡ https://lnkd.in/gY_Px7Gr #CareerEverywhere #careerservices #highereducation #careercenter\n\nReally appreciate many of the points raised by Laura Kuizin, Ed.D. in her recent piece for Inside Higher Ed. Particularly her reflection, \"I was surprised to discover how many students are unaware of or undervalue their existing skills.\" At Talent - Workforce Transformation we find that to be true right across the workforce, no matter the age or stage of the individual in their career. Another reason why #skillsintelligence matters! #workforcetransformation\n\nThis week, we had the privilege of visiting several of our partner campuses around Texas. A highlight of the trip was getting to speak to a group of students - at their request! - to discuss career opportunities and trajectory upon completion of our curriculum. This conversation highlighted the importance of work-based learning opportunities for students. One student knew exactly what she wanted to do and only needed some input on how to order the steps she plans to take. One student really isn't sure what he wants to do and could benefit from exposure to different environments to see what sparks his interest. Another knows the general field she wants to pursue; while she isn't sure where she wants to focus within that field, she beautifully articulated the work environment that she knows will help her thrive. The more we can provide students the opportunity to engage with the workforce, the more they can align their education choices to pursue the right career, saving both time and money spent exploring. Next week, we will look more at how this serves not only students, but employers as well. #AdvanceCTE #CTEMonth #WorkBasedLearning\n\nDid you know? Schools with clear career progression pathways have significantly higher staff satisfaction rates. When teachers can see a well-defined route for advancement, they feel more motivated and engaged in their roles. This clarity not only fosters a sense of purpose but also encourages teachers to invest in their own professional growth. Talent-Ed Matrix allows schools to map out detailed career pathways for their staff, ensuring each individual understands the qualifications and skills required for future roles.
