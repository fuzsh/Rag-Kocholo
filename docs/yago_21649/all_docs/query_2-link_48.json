        "text": "The RunPee app tells you the best times to\n\nrun & pee during a movie\n\nso you don't miss the best scenes.\n\nMovie Review – Alien: Romulus\n\nThis movie was clearly made to appeal to the Gen-Z generation. And if it fails we’ll be able to say: Gen-Z exterminated the alien threat. Every character, save one, is in their 20s. The cast is a collection of young adults trying to escape a life of servitude. The good If you’re a lifelong Aliens […]\n\nThe brother and sister team behind the Peetimes\n\nA RunPee fan recently commented that he thought the RunPee app was just another app created by an app farm to make money. He was delighted to discover that it’s a bootstrapped company created and maintained by a small family. RunPee: A Brief History You can read the details here, but the idea for the […]\n\nMovie Review – It Ends with Us\n\nIt Ends With Us was phenomenal. Blake Lively gave this character her all, you felt every little emotion she felt, her chemistry made the screen spark. I love her, I don’t think she’s ever done anything under exceptional. This role was no different, she owned it. I did not know anything about it when I […]\n\nMovie Review – Cuckoo\n\nSadly, this movie sucked. I have no idea what to write except to warn you. Save your money and your time and skip it. It made no sense what-so-ever. The acting was horrible. Even the noises were annoying. The only reason I stayed for the whole thing is I’d probably get fired if I left […]\n\nMovie Review – Borderlands\n\nTake Guardians of the Galaxy, Mad Max, and Captain Marvel. Mix them all together and then take out all the good bits and you have Borderlands. This has got to be one of the biggest what were you thinking moments in movie-making history. Who thought this was a good idea? Did anyone read this script before greenlighting the project? How does […]\n\nWhat to do when the RunPee app crashes or you spot a bug\n\nMonday night (August 5, 2024) was not a good night to need to use the RunPee app on Android. I updated the app in the Play Store and then much to my dismay got an email from a fan telling me that the app crashed for them every time they opened it. I checked and… […]\n\nMovie Review – Harold and the Purple Crayon\n\nHarold and the Purple Crayon is probably a great movie, if you’re a pre-teen. I’m not sure kids much older than that will enjoy it too much. The characters and plot are all obvious and I didn’t get the feeling that the moral of the story really had any impact. It’s difficult to really tell what the moral […]\n\nMovie Review – Trap\n\nTrap was a solid tension based movie that kept you guessing right up until the end. Josh Hartnett did an outstanding job with his role. He would bounce from the perfect father figure to a scheming serial killer called, The Butcher. This role needed a strong actor to portray the many different personalities that were tightly wound […]"
