        "text": "When we first met KJ Apa, he was saying goodbye to his character Archie from the much beloved YA series Riverdale and venturing into new territory (including with being a muse of fashion house Lacoste.) “I feel like I’m going through this period of self-discovery right now in my life where I’m like, “Okay, I’m a father. I’ve got all this responsibility,” but I have all this ambition and things that I want to achieve,” he explained to James Franco for VMAN’s 50th issue. “I’m trying to ﬁnd a healthy balance for it all.”\n\nFast forward a year later, the New Zealand actor has made great strides in achieving that balance he craved—complete with an entirely new look and new project to boot. With a daring buzzcut, riding motorcycles nearly everyday, looking after his child, and keeping his budding career in heat, there’s no better time to keep up with KJ and peek into his latest work than with One Fast Move. In new movie by Prime Video, the actor teams up with director Kelly Blatz to deliver an adrenaline bumping film where we see the Riverdale alum starring alongside Eric Dane, Austin North, Edward James Olmos, and more as KJ’s character Wes deals with the ups and down of motorcycle racing while grappling with the intensities of his troubled personal life.\n\nBelow, VMAN chatted with the actor to get an inside look how he managed to take on the complexities of his bad boy character, his on-set experience with motorcycle racing, and, of course, his new hairdo.\n\nVMAN: What were some of your initial thoughts when you read the script for the film? What drew you to the plot and your character, Wes?\n\nKJ APA: When I first read One Fast Move, I was very drawn to the tone and the world that these characters existed in. Kelly had spoken to me beforehand about tonal references. And so I was able to imagine the world, the city, the tracks, bikes, houses, etc. The script read very real. There was nothing slick about it, which is why I think I loved it so much. The characters all felt real too, like they had a lot of history to them. You could just feel it. And them. This was exactly the kind of story I wanted to be a part of. I needed to be a part of. I feel like this story chose me. I had entered into it at the perfect moment in my life. I needed something heavy to sink into. And there was just so much there to work with. There are some projects that just feel right. You go with it and the world seems to follow. One Fast Move was one of these projects.\n\nVMAN: In working with director Kelly Blatz on the complexities surrounding Wes (in both his desire to reconnect with his father and become a pro-moto-racer), what did the development process for your character look like?\n\nKA: It was all just conversations with Kelly. We would talk. For hours and hours. Over days and weeks. I would pick up the phone and call him. Wes has a complicated past. And a complicated relationship with his father. He has demons. He has resentment. He has only ever really had himself to rely on for a very long time. I’m so grateful for the time I had with the story because it allowed me to sit on ideas. Sometimes an idea will seem amazing when you first stumble across it, but give it some and often it can feel so whacky, ridiculous even. Having time to really process, ask questions, go for a ride, and just sit on things, is such a luxury. It allows you to grow deep roots in the story and character. It’s strange but I feel like a new part of myself was brought forth from within me during the making of this film. I became more passionate about my work. I really fell in love with what I got to do as an actor. I gained a deeper understanding of myself. Of what I want. I have Kelly to thank for this. For trusting me and letting me roam free in this landscape he had created. What a beautiful way to work.\n\nVMAN: Were you into the world of motorcycle road racing before getting involved in the film? Or did you have to dive deep into that scene a bit to understand it all a bit better?\n\nKA: I didn’t ride before the film. In fact, the world of motorcycles was completely foreign to me. Riding motorcycles was one of those things I would fantasize about, but never actually have the time or courage to do. Obviously, this is such an important part of the film, and the character, so I learned, and I fell in love with it. I ride almost every day still. I watched a ton of Moto GP races. I learned a lot. Spoke to people. But Wes himself is a bit of an outsider too in the motorcycle world. He was never part of that scene. I saw him more popping in and out, as a lone wolf, unafraid.\n\nVMAN: We gotta talk about the hair! Hair has been a focal point in your acting career (notably going from being a redhead for Archie to a brunette for many of your other films)—how did the idea of a buzzcut come about? Were you a bit nervous or jumped at the chance for a new look?\n\nKA: Hahaha, the hair… I had finished season 6 on Riverdale and began shooting One Fast Move a week later in Atlanta. The plan was always to dye my hair back to brown for the movie. But I realized when I arrived in Atlanta, that this wouldn’t work. I felt that a more drastic change in physicality would drop me into an interesting place. So we buzzed it off. And it felt fucking amazing. It was exactly what I needed. It’s amazing how much a change like that can make you feel. And how other people take you in. We are all so lucky to be able to make changes like this I think, subtle or big, it can be a great way for us in our personal lives to start fresh.\n\nVMAN: You star alongside acting icon Eric Dane in the film—what was it like working with Eric?\n\nKA: Eric Dane has become one of my closest friends. Working with him was very intense. Eric’s presence demands your full attention. He pulls the best performances out of me. He just makes you want to care more. We pretty much locked in immediately. He has become someone in my life who I can bounce personal things off of. Our come-up wasn’t so dissimilar. He shared with me what works for him. What hasn’t? I feel grateful to have someone like Eric to ask for advice from. I have loved continuing to walk through life with him.\n\nVMAN: Coming fresh off the finale of Riverdale, in what ways does this new film hold importance for you in your life and career now?"
