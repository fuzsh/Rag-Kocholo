        "text": "A movie so elementally modern that it seems to be both a close for the first great era of filmmaking and a blueprint for what was to come. Its influence is like that of Gilgamesh, such an inherent part of what the medium has become as to be a core part of its DNA. The basic read on this is that it transplants expressionism into realism, and that's not altogether wrong, though it gives the impression that Vidor smooths out the stylistic excesses of that movement. Instead, he refines and arguably expands its scope, taking it from the realm of the symbolic and theatrical and into the richer possibilities for subtle expression endemic to cinema.\n\nThat early shot of the…\n\n\"The world can't stop because your baby's sick!\"\n\nNo, the world can't stop, and doesn't. Vidor's film captures this reality, life's unstoppable forward-movement, with such power that it took me completely off guard. We can trace the cross-section of any life, as Vidor has brilliantly done here, and the affective registers will surface naturally, almost spontaneously... But this film is no proponent of universalist claims. Instead, it deals explicitly and openly with the exceptionalist fantasy borne from capitalism, and the ways in which that enterprise forecloses individual futures. I love the way the film builds this brilliant critique into its narrative, but I'm also taken by its broader reach. Especially that haunting final shot and its seemingly boundless implications: a…\n\nThere’s hardly a truer love than love won through the endurance of unimaginable sadness.\n\nAs King Vidor’s masterpiece puts it, “The crowd laughs with you always… but it will only cry with you for a day.” Then, the one who remains after the tears… will eventually be the source of the greatest joy. Though, as Vidor’s work portrays — life will stop at nothing to test the endurance of this devotion.\n\n“The Crowd,” arriving at the end of the silent era, is a technical marvel at the summit of its craft. Vidor’s mobile (often, concealed) camera moves with its characters through the streets and tenements of New York. With largely inexperienced actors cast across lead and bit parts, the film…\n\nThe American Dream. The belief that, wherever you come from, whoever you are, you can do it, you will do it. An entire nation prospered because of that belief, and countless movies and novels made of that very same belief the foundation for their narration. Yet few of them tackles the way that dream can ruin one's life, how that belief can be erroneous, a blinding mirage to make the masses believe they are special, when, in real life, they are not.\n\nThe Crowd by King Vidor is the antithesis of the American dream, its darker counterpart, where the American dream is, after all, only a dream, The Crowd is the sad reality that awaits for those who were fools…\n\nAlthough F. W. Murnau's masterpiece Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans may have done away with winning the only ever Academy Award for \"Unique and Artistic Production\" another film in competition at the time, being King Vidor's The Crowd deserves a name for itself as one of the great American films of the period. King Vidor's films have always revolved around this sort of melodrama but so rare are films like The Crowd coming by with the rollercoaster of emotions that they give out. It takes time before one gets down to the most beautiful aspects of The Crowd but to prepare oneself only for what would become one of the finest examples of melodrama ever to have been put…\n\n\"You've gotta be good in that town if you want to beat the crowd.\"\n\n(Warning: spoilers ahead.)\n\nWhen I was sixteen, I had a goal. I was going to succeed where King Vidor had not and complete a screenplay about the life and death of The Crowd's tragic star, James Murray.\n\nPicture it: Fall 2008, eleventh grade in high school. I had just seen The Crowd on TCM and I was so inspired - both by the film itself and by the legend of Vidor's unsuccessful attempt to get his The Actor project off the page and into production - that I penned a short story in my creative writing class as a first step. I didn't think that I…\n\nThe gigantic and impersonal city of New York towering over the hopes and ambitions of a young couple as they start their life together helps to nurture The Crowd to be a romance drama that stands as one of the greatest films of the silent period.\n\nIt's a well-told tale directed by King Vidor, featuring a collection of visually appealing and eloquently apprehended images. In collaboration with cinematographer Henry Sharp, his work carried forward many innovative stylistic techniques as it follows the struggles and downfalls of two married protagonists: John and Mary Sims, played by Eleanor Boardman and James Murray. The couple's journey conveys a believable human struggle as they confront and attempt to overcome a succession of disappointing obstacles.…"
