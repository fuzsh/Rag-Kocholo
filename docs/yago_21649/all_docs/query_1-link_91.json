        "text": "(AP) - Robert Altman, the caustic and irreverent satirist behind \"M-A-S-H,\" \"Nashville\" and \"The Player\" who made a career out of bucking Hollywood management and story conventions, died at a Los Angeles Hospital, his Sandcastle 5 Productions Company said Tuesday. He was 81.\n\nThe director died Monday night, Joshua Astrachan, a producer at Altman's Sandcastle 5 Productions in New York City, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe cause of death wasn't disclosed. A news release was expected later in the day, Astrachan said.\n\nA five-time Academy Award nominee for best director, most recently for 2001's \"Gosford Park,\" he finally won a lifetime achievement Oscar in 2006.\n\n\"No other filmmaker has gotten a better shake than I have,\" Altman said while accepting the award. \"I'm very fortunate in my career. I've never had to direct a film I didn't choose or develop. My love for filmmaking has given me an entree to the world and to the human condition.\"\n\nAltman had one of the most distinctive styles among modern filmmakers. He often employed huge ensemble casts, encouraged improvisation and overlapping dialogue and filmed scenes in long tracking shots that would flit from character to character.\n\nPerpetually in and out of favor with audiences and critics, Altman worked ceaselessly since his anti-war black comedy \"M-A-S-H\" established his reputation in 1970, but he would go for years at a time directing obscure movies before roaring back with a hit.\n\nAfter a string of commercial duds including \"The Gingerbread Man\" in 1998, \"Cookie's Fortune\" in 1999 and \"Dr. T & the Women\" in 2000, Altman took his all-American cynicism to Britain for 2001's \"Gosford Park.\"\n\nA combination murder-mystery and class-war satire set among snobbish socialites and their servants on an English estate in the 1930s, \"Gosford Park\" was Altman's biggest box-office success since \"M-A-S-H.\"\n\nBesides best-director, \"Gosford Park\" earned six other Oscar nominations, including best picture and best supporting actress for both Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith. It won the original-screenplay Oscar, and Altman took the best-director prize at the Golden Globes for \"Gosford Park.\"\n\nNo other filmmaker has gotten a better shake than I have. I've never had to direct a film I didn't choose or develop. My love for filmmaking has given me an entree to the world and to the human condition.\n\nAltman's other best-director Oscar nominations came for \"M-A-S-H,\" the country-music saga \"Nashville\" from 1975, the movie-business satire \"The Player\" from 1992 and the ensemble character study \"Short Cuts\" from 1993. He also earned a best-picture nomination as producer of \"Nashville.\"\n\nNo director ever got more best-director nominations without winning a regular Oscar, though four other men - Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Clarence Brown and King Vidor - tied with Altman at five.\n\nIn May, Altman brought out \"A Prairie Home Companion,\" with Garrison Keillor starring as the announcer of a folksy musical show - with the same name as Keillor's own long-running show - about to be shut down by new owners. Among those in the cast were Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Kline, Woody Harrelson and Tommy Lee Jones.\n\n\"This film is about death,\" Altman said at a May 3 news conference in St. Paul, Minn., also attended by Keillor and many of the movie's stars.\n\nHe often took on Hollywood genres with a revisionist's eye, de-romanticizing the Western hero in 1971's \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\" and 1976's \"Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson,\" the film-noir gumshoe in 1973's \"The Long Goodbye\" and outlaw gangsters in \"Thieves Like Us.\"\n\n\"M-A-S-H\" was Altman's first big success after years of directing television, commercials, industrial films and generally unremarkable feature films. The film starring Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould was set during the Korean War but was Altman's thinly veiled attack on U.S. involvement in Vietnam.\n\n\"That was my intention entirely. If you look at that film, there's no mention of what war it is,\" Altman said in an Associated Press interview in 2001, adding that the studio made him put a disclaimer at the beginning to identify the setting as Korea.\n\n\"Our mandate was bad taste. If anybody had a joke in the worst taste, it had a better chance of getting into the film, because nothing was in worse taste than that war itself,\" Altman said.\n\nThe film spawned the long-running TV sitcom starring Alan Alda, a show Altman would refer to with distaste as \"that series.\" Unlike the social message of the film, the series was prompted by greed, Altman said.\n\n\"They made millions and millions of dollars by bringing an Asian war into Americans' homes every Sunday night,\" Altman said in 2001. \"I thought that was the worst taste.\"\n\nAltman never minced words about reproaching Hollywood. After the Sept. 11 attacks, he said Hollywood served as a source of inspiration for the terrorists by making violent action movies that amounted to training films for such attacks.\n\n\"Nobody would have thought to commit an atrocity like that unless they'd seen it in a movie,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman was written off repeatedly by the Hollywood establishment, and his reputation for arrogance and hard drinking - a habit he eventually gave up - hindered his efforts to raise money for his idiosyncratic films.\n\nWhile critical of studio executives, Altman held actors in the highest esteem. He joked that on \"Gosford Park,\" he was there mainly to turn the lights on and off for the performers.\n\nThe respect was mutual. Top-name actors would clamor for even bit parts in his films. Altman generally worked on shoestring budgets, yet he continually landed marquee performers who signed on for a fraction of their normal salaries.\n\nAfter the mid-1970s, the quality of Altman's films became increasingly erratic. His 1980 musical \"Popeye,\" with Robin Williams, was trashed by critics, and Altman took some time off from film.\n\nHe directed the Broadway production of \"Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean,\" following it with a movie adaptation in 1982. Altman went back and forth from TV to theatrical films over the next decade, but even when his films earned critical praise, such as 1990's \"Vincent & Theo,\" they remained largely unseen.\n\n\"The Player\" and \"Short Cuts\" re-established Altman's reputation and commercial viability. But other 1990s films - including his fashion-industry farce \"Ready to Wear\" and \"Kansas City,\" his reverie on the 1930s jazz and gangster scene of his hometown - fell flat.\n\nBorn Feb. 20, 1925, Altman hung out in his teen years at the jazz clubs of Kansas City, Mo., where his father was an insurance salesman.\n\nAltman was a bomber pilot in World War II and studied engineering at the University of Missouri in Columbia before taking a job making industrial films in Kansas City.\n\nHe moved into feature films with \"The Delinquents\" in 1957, then worked largely in television through the mid 1960s, directing episodes of such series as \"Bonanza\" and \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\"\n\nAltman and his wife, Kathryn, had two sons, Robert and Matthew, and he had a daughter, Christine, and two other sons, Michael and Stephen, from two previous marriages.\n\nWhen he received his honorary Oscar in 2006, Altman revealed he had a heart transplant a decade earlier.\n\n\"I didn't make a big secret out of it, but I thought nobody would hire me again,\" he said after the ceremony. \"You know, there's such a stigma about heart transplants, and there's a lot of us out there.\"\n\n(Copyright 2006 by The Associated Press.
