        "text": "Filled with laughs and a strong beating heart, BETTER TIMES is a warm, feel-good drama that follows three brothers and their father on a quest to save their family bakery. When three brothers Oscar, Lukas and Karl decide to pay a visit to their father, they are shocked to learn that their family bakery is facing bankruptcy. Before long, they find out that the situation is much more dire than first anticipated. So, despite their differences, the family must band together to protect their family legacy. In an attempt to break a world record for baking, they must unite in order to save the family bakery. At the same time, they each must face the grief of losing their mother a few years ago that separated them in the first place. Written and directed by Milad Schwartz Avaz, this tender, heartwarming tale about family dynamics, grief, forgiveness and the joy of living in the present, stars real-life brothers Sebastian and Andreas Jessen, alongside Ari Alexander as the three siblings."
