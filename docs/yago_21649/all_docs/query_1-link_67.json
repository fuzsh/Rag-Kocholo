        "text": "Edward Dmytryk was a renowned film director of several screen classics, including “Murder, My Sweet” (1944), “Crossfire” (1947), “The Caine Mutiny” (1954), “Raintree County” (1957), and “The Young Lions” (1958). He died July 1, 1999, at his Encino, California, home at age 90. About two and a half months earlier, I had the pleasure of meeting him on a warm Saturday afternoon at his home. I was introduced to him and his wife, former screen actress Jean Porter (1922-2018), by two mutual friends, Jerry Anker and his wife Marguerite Campbell, a former screen actress in the 1930s and 1940s and the last of the six Goldwyn Girls hired by Samuel Goldwyn. At the time, Jerry Anker himself was President of the Hollywood High School Alumni Association, Curator of The Hollywood Museum in the Max Factor building. He was a close friend of the Dmytryks.\n\nIt was a delight meeting all of them; Mr. Dmytryk, who had not been in good health before and had not given any interviews for quite some time, was very relaxed, and he enjoyed talking about his career in films, which began in 1922 when he became a messenger boy at Paramount.\n\nHe was born in Grand Forks, British Columbia, Canada, on September 4, 1908, of Ukrainian emigré parents. His mother died in 1918, and after his father had married again, the family first moved to San Francisco and then to Los Angeles. While attending the Hollywood High School in Hollywood, he became a messenger boy at Paramount in 1922. He then went to CalTech, and in 1927 he rejoined Paramount as a full-time projectionist and then became an editor in the 1930s.\n\nAs a director, his career spanned nearly four decades from the mid-1930s through the mid-1970s, starting with the “Western Trail of the Hawk” (1935) before being called in to salvage the Betty Grable vehicle “Million Dollar Legs” (1939), for which he remained uncredited. After a few B pictures at Columbia, including “The Confessions of Boston Blackie” and “The Secrets of the Lone Wolf” (both 1941), he signed with RKO where he found his artistic niche, making several 1940s noir films.\n\n“Crossfire” (1947) became one his many landmark films. It earned him an Academy Award nomination as Best Director but, unfortunately, that same year would prove to be a disastrous one as he became one of the victims of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Long story short, Mr. Dmytryk became a member of the ‘Hollywood Ten,’ a group of ten filmmakers who refused to confirm or deny any political affiliation. By refusing to testify, they jeopardized their careers. They were tried at the Federal Court of Washington, D.C., and convicted of contempt of Congress. As a result, Mr. Dmytryk was fired from his seven-year contract by RKO and could not work in Hollywood. Subsequently, he was offered work in England where he directed two films.\n\nBefore this interview, Mrs. Dmytryk had asked me not to talk about this particular and controversial era, also because he had written a book, “Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten” (1996), with Mr. Dmytryk describing his personal views and ideals, and his fight out of blacklisting before resuming his career as one of Hollywood’s leading directors. Instead of talking about the blacklist era, I focused on the importance of his films, his capabilities as a filmmaker, and his incredible body of work. After all, let’s not forget that this is the man who directed the ‘Who’s Who in Hollywood,’ with actors such as Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Bette Davis, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Gregory Peck, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, Clark Gable, Robert Mitchum, Ginger Rogers, William Holden, Barbara Stanwyck, Henry Fonda, Jane Fonda, Sean Connery—and Brigitte Bardot. Who on earth can top that?\n\nOver the years, Mr. Dmytryk authored several books, including his autobiography “It’s a Hell of a Life But Not a Bad Living: A Hollywood Memoir” (1978) and, as previously mentioned, “Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten” (1996). When I met him for this interview back in 1999, he was writing a new book, “The Making of ‘Raintree County.’” Although this one was never published, a few years later, another delightful memoir of his, “Hollywood’s Golden Age: As Told By One Who Lived It All” (2003), with an unprecedented look back on old Hollywood and his early days in the film capital, was published posthumously. This Hollywood memoir also announced “The Making of ‘Raintree County'” to be published at the summer of 2004.\n\nThe then unfinished manuscript of his book on “Raintree County” was on the table—it was still a work in progress—and so, almost logically, it was the start of our conversation, especially since Mr. Dmytryk’s epic film, initially announced by MGM in 1949 as a film project for Van Heflin, Ava Gardner and Lana Turner, but ultimately starring Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and Eva Marie Saint, had always been a favorite of mine.\n\nMr. Dmytryk, why are you writing a book about “Raintree County”?\n\nI thought it would be a good subject to talk about making pictures, how you make pictures, why you make pictures. We have a saying in America: A camel is a horse made by a committee—does that make any sense to you ? That’s exactly what pictures are now: they’re made by committees. This whole thing of committees and boards of directors has certainly ruined the arts. They make money, that’s the most important thing in the world. When I was making films, I was the boss when they asked me to become a director. A producer never came on the set. I remember Leo McCarey literally had a producer thrown of the set. They grabbed him at his command, threw him out, and locked the door. What I did when a producer came out on the set—and they very rarely did—I would get a chair and say, ‘Sit down!’ We’d talk, and after fifteen minutes, he would realize that we weren’t working. We’d just be talking about football or baseball or something. So he’d say, ‘Hey, I gotta go up to the office.’ In any art, you have only one mind—that one mind can use help from his assistants, from the people who work with him. But he’s got to be in control. He has to be in charge.\n\n“Raintree County” (1957, trailer)\n\nCan you tell me how you got started in the film business?\n\nI ran away from home when I was fourteen; I belonged to a group, something like the boy scouts, called the Western Rangers, and the son of an executive at Paramount was one of these boys. Through him, I got a small job. I started as a messenger boy at six dollars a week. Then they created a job for me at the laboratory. At the time, Paramount was in the process of moving to where they are now. They were still located at Sunset and Vine back then, and they ran dailies. I used to go in and watch them, and I was entranced by the complicated machinery that was much more complicated than it is today. Nothing was automatic. They only had two projectionists, and one of them taught me all about his business. He wanted to smoke, but you weren’t allowed to when you were running a film. So I could take over for him once in a while when he went out for a smoke. The head of the laboratory kept saying to me, ‘Get the hell out of there, don’t go in there!’ But I kept going back, and finally, they gave me a job as an assistant projectionist. I was still going to school. Then I went to CalTech—the California Institute for Technology—for a year, majoring in mathematics. I decided that the film business was a lot more interesting, so I decided to quit CalTech and work full-time at the studios.\n\nSo that was the beginning of a long and rewarding career in films. Did it all happen just by luck, or did you have any plans?\n\nI never had plans to make a career in films. This used to bother some of my students when I was teaching. It seemed to them I had no ambitions, I just took whatever came along. All I knew was that I had confidence in myself and could do what anyone wanted me to do. When sound came in, I asked to go into the cutting department, and because I was a mathematical major, they thought that sound brought a lot of technique that women couldn’t handle. At Paramount at that time, most of the cutters were women, and many were fired. I got a chance as an assistant cutter, and about six months later, when they thought they were missing the Spanish speaking market—and I spoke Spanish—they made me a full cutter, and I cut two or three Spanish speaking pictures. Then I went over to regular pictures, first as an assistant and then as a regular film editor until 1939, when I had both my citizenship and my chance to direct.\n\nYou make it look so easy.\n\nWell, I have been very lucky, you know. When I started, I was a kid; I had no family. I had nothing. My career went ahead, but I never asked anybody for a job. Never. I was lucky they picked me out, all the way down the line, so I wasn’t indebted to anybody. I didn’t have to please anybody. I learned some important things. Some directors or some executives think they’re God, and that would get you into trouble. You had to know when or what to compromise. You had to know how to compromise so you could win most compromises. You couldn’t just say to a producer or a studio executive, ‘No, that won’t work.’ I never said it that way. I would tell, ‘Well, I think I have a better idea’—or something like that. I would do the same thing with actors. You don’t tell an actor how to act. I always believed in actors that could be their character.\n\nThat’s crucial to you?\n\nIt’s a very important thing. A writer writes a book or a script, and he puts a lot of himself into that book or that script. Suppose I’m not yet sure which actors I’m going to get for the picture—I get Marlon Brando in a picture, and he can play a certain kind of character, but he can’t play others. Or Montgomery Clift can’t play a Marlon Brando character; he can play other kinds of characters that are Monty Clift. Let me put it this way. I made two pictures with Spencer Tracy; in one of them, “The Mountain” [1956], he played a mountain guide. He was that mountain guide, but he was still Spencer Tracy; he was Spencer Tracy as he would have been a mountain guide. He could put himself into that thing. He didn’t have to say, ‘Oh, I’m like that mountain guide over there.’ He simply had to study. How does that mountaineer work? How does he climb? How does he think? Spencer did all those things; he studied their customs and habits. So you never know this until you cast the picture. The writers don’t know this, they write a thing, and they think the script is gold. As long as you can change Shakespeare and the word of God as it is written in the Bible, you certainly can change a writer’s script, can’t you? So I get a character who can be that person, but I don’t tell him how to play the part…\n\n…because actors are intelligent…\n\n…they are. I never met a good actor who isn’t. In “The Mountain,” Spencer Tracy was a mountain guide, and in “Broken Lance” [1954], he played a cattle owner, a wealthy western cattle man. Two completely different characters, and he was very good playing each one of them, as Spencer Tracy would have been if he were actually these characters in real life.\n\nYou have always been an actor’s director. How important is the script to you?\n\nTo me, a script is something I think about as far as essence goes, that kind of thing, but I’m never sure about it until I cast the actors. Once I have the actors, I have an idea of how they will play it. A director can put himself into the actor’s work, and that is wrong. So I ask them, ‘How are you going to play it?’ If it’s right, it’s right, very often, it’s something I might not even have expected, and I love that. I love them to be creative on their own. If a director says, ‘I want you to play it this way,’ which is not the actor’s way, then it becomes a performance. So, once you get the cast, you change things to suit the cast you’ve got. It’s like getting the suit off the rack: it has to be corrected and refitted. It’s the same with the script; it’s easier to refit the script than it is to refit the actor. What I try to do—and don’t ask me how I do it—in fact, it’s only been lately since people have been nice to me that I’ve been thinking about it—I never thought I had a style. But apparently, I do have a style; a lot of people recognize that style. It’s not a style that I’m conscious of, and I never said, ‘Hey, I’m going to have a certain kind of a style like Lubitsch who had a wonderful sense of humor.’ But he, too, didn’t realize he was creating a style. He was just being Lubitsch; he had a certain kind of humor that was very good for pictures.\n\nWhat about your early days as a director? Could you elaborate on that a little bit?\n\nFirst, I was a B director in the late 1930s, bouncing around for two or three years, making a few pictures at Columbia, and finally at RKO where I was given “Hitler’s Children” [1943]. It was a propaganda picture, and I realized it had potential. It became a tremendous hit. It cost a $100,000 and made $700,000, which at that time was a lot of money, and then they gave me A pictures. “Hitler’s Children,” an anti-fascist drama, was so successful that they gave me a new contract. I did “Tender Comrade” [1943] with Ginger Rogers, which was very successful, followed by “Murder, My Sweet” [1944], also a very successful film.\n\nLooking back, is it correct to say that “Murder, My Sweet” has been overshadowed by “Crossfire” [1947]? That picture was really a milestone in American post-war cinema and one of Hollywood’s first attempts to deal with racial discrimination. What would you consider the strength of this film? Its sincerity?\n\nYes, I think so. Also, it’s subtle and understandable—not subtle and obvious, as it is in many of today’s films. I like to make pictures in which things are said. In “Crossfire,” when the detective talks the boy into cooporating with him towards the end of the picture, he talks about his Irish grandfather, not about Jews getting killed, but about his Irish grandfather, because there was a time in American history when the Irish were considered the bad guys, taking everybody’s jobs and all that kind of thing. What I wanted to prove, was that it was anti-human in all respects, not just anti-Semitism, but also anti-white, anti-black, anti-everything else that is wrong. That’s the way I feel about things. In fact, my father was Ukrainian and was quite anti-Semitic. I lived in a small town in Washington State and every Saturday, he played cards with the town tailor who happened to be Jewish, but he was the only one in town who spoke Ukrainian. My father hated Jews but would play cards with them, that is something!\n\nWould it be correct to describe “Crossfire” as enriching entertainment?\n\nI would rather use the word enlightenment. I remember when we previewed “Cornered” [1945]; when the picture was finished, it took about five minutes before anybody moved, and then they suddenly started clapping and applauding. It was as if they had to think about it, they had to let the emotions go, and that’s perfect. If you finish a picture with a rainstorm, you go outdoors in a matinee, the sun is shining, and you say, ‘My God, it isn’t raining!’—then you’ve done something, you must feel it. Now that’s physical, but the audience also must feel the emotional thing. If that doesn’t happen, you’ve failed. Then you’re just looking at a bunch of guys shooting at each other, and it doesn’t really matter. A picture should affect us and teach us something. Hedda Hopper once said, ‘If you want to deliver a message, send a telegram.’ She hated pictures that had a message. But the pictures I made, like “Crossfire,” had a message. That why it was made, because it had a message. I wasn’t Jewish, I was born a Catholic, but anti-Semitism was a horrible thing.\n\nHow much did the film cost to make?\n\nWe made the picture for $500,000—very cheaply and very quickly. The studio knew they might lose money on it, but they thought it might be good for the studio, that this could be a good prestige picture if nothing else. We were able to talk the producers and executives into making the picture because of that. When released, it made a lot of money. It came out at the right time.\n\nWhen did you first notice that you were a good film director?\n\nWhen I started directing, I didn’t know if I could be a good director or not because directing is an art. It’s like you can paint or you can’t paint. Some good films came my way until Congress pulled me out. That put a big dent in my career, but I was lucky enough to come back. Some liberals who hated the idea that I came out against the Communists thought that my pictures afterward weren’t as good as those I made before. Well, I think they were better. Stanley Kramer put me back on the map with a four-picture deal; three of them were B pictures—he called them ‘B pictures with class’—made on short schedules. But they were well done. Otherwise, I couldn’t have gotten “The Caine Mutiny” [1954] which was made for just $2,000,000. I consider that one of my better pictures, along with “Murder, My Sweet,” “Crossfire” and “The Young Lions” [1958], which I think is my very best.\n\nHow did that film come about? It is still regarded as one of the most powerful WW2 dramas, with Marlon Brando as a confused Nazi officer and Montgomery Clift and Dean Martin as U.S. soldiers.\n\nI had the problem of three characters—two of which never saw the third and the third never saw the first until he was dead. The War was the thing that hangs it together, along with their attitude towards the War, their life during the War, and the girls that they loved—that kind of thing. They were completely different, and yet they were the same. To me, that was the theme of the picture. Long before I read the script, I had read the book [written by Irwin Shaw]. The book was interesting; it’s a series of short stories really. I knew that those short stories somehow had to be connected because you can’t tell a picture of short stories. Under certain circumstances, it has been done, then it becomes a documentary or something. So I got a draft paper, that’s a paper you use in mathematics with crossed lines, I put it together until I had a sheet about this long. I used a red pencil for one of the actors, a blue pencil for another actor, and another pencil for the third actor, so I could have an idea of the transition from Germany to America with the War that brought it all together. That was one reason why we changed the story. Irwin Shaw always disliked me for doing that. Most people agreed that we changed the German character into a good guy. I didn’t want this one German to be a bad man. There are a lot of good Germans in the world. So that became a problem of the three ways of living, one of them was a poor kid, the other was an entertainer, and the third one was a German who became a Nazi—not a real Nazi, not a cruel Nazi, but a German with feelings as a lot of Germans had. If the German had been a heavy, the contrast would have been too great, dealing with decent Americans and a lousy German, that isn’t fair.\n\n“The Young Lions” (1958, trailer)\n\nThere’s also a very beautiful love scene in the film with Montgomery Clift.\n\nI suppose you’re talking about the scene when he brings the girl home for the first time, and it ends up in kind of a love scene? Nowadays, they do love scenes where they tear the clothes off each other and jump into bed, leaving nothing to the imagination. Sex is a private thing. While I was teaching, many students picked out this particular scene and thought it was a wonderful love scene. Yet all there is, is a kiss, no more than that, but their love is expressed in the things they do or don’t say to each other. At a certain point, when Monty starts telling her what he thinks, she says, ‘Tell me tomorrow.’ That one line does it all. She means she’s going to see him tomorrow. The problem now is that women are often the aggressors in pictures. It’s the woman who makes the approach. I resent that! I love women and I have great respect for them, but making them aggressors isn’t good. Women have more power if they are feminine! Even the feminists are writing about that now. They didn’t have to become masculine, for Christ’s sake.\n\nDo you think that with your experience and your knowledge, you’d still be able to make a film like that today?\n\nWell, I haven’t made a picture in a long time now, it’s been more than twenty years. I don’t know if I could do it today or not. I couldn’t work with the producers standing in the back, on stage. And then there is the advertising. ‘Sensational! Sensational! Sensational!’ The essence of art is gone. Since when did we have any great novel written? Since when have we viewed a writer like Thomas Mann or Ernest Hemingway or anyone like that? We have had three or four great writers in America. The others were in Europe; we don’t have them anymore. We have no great composers anymore. The last one was Stravinsky.\n\nOver the years, you worked with the best and most talented actors. How did you work with them on the set?\n\nI would go to work at nine o’clock in the morning, and I would quit at five in the afternoon, not any later. The mind gets tired, and if the mind gets tired, your muscles get tired, and you can’t do your best work. So I would quit around five o’clock and rehearse the next day’s work, just roughly. One morning I was doing a scene for “Broken Lance” with Richard Widmark and Spencer Tracy, a ten-page scene which I think was scheduled for about four or five days of shooting. I rehearsed the whole ten-page scene in one afternoon because I had two very fine actors. We came in the following day at nine o’clock, the cameraman was ready; we went through one rehearsal to make sure the lights were right and shot it in one take. When Marlon Brando agreed to work on “The Young Lions,” I had a long talk with him about the part. I was worried. He had a very bad reputation. So I called Fred Zinnemann, who had directed him in his screen debut “The Men” [1950], and Zinnemann said, ‘Oh boy, he’s a tough guy. I once did seventy takes, all he had to do was look out the window, and they were all lousy. Then the seventy-first—that was magic.’ But I can’t have seventy takes to get it right, so I worked with him a little bit, mostly we talked about philosophy or the kind of pictures he’s interested in, and I had a great time with him. I never needed more than four or five takes, he never complained, and later, when the picture was finished, he said he never had as good a time with a director since “On the Waterfront” [1954] with Kazan. While shooting in London, I remember one night I came home from work and turned on the TV during an interview with Orson Welles. They were interviewing him as an actor. The interviewer asked, ‘Mr. Welles, I understand you are a lot of trouble to directors.’ Orson said, ‘I’m no trouble to a good director.’ That doesn’t surprise me. I’m a great fan of the sign curve; most people are up in the middle, very few are at the top, very few at the bottom. This is a mediocre world with a lot of mediocrity in everything, certainly in all the arts. If you have a good head, you can do good work, and if you have a way of approaching it, you can do fine work. But most people, I think, do not have the patience for doing great work; there’s an old saying, ‘Good isn’t good enough,’ meaning you have to go for perfection. You may not get it, but you’ve got to try. So I never had to do a lot of takes because I had the right people working with me—cast and crew.\n\nWhat about working with close-ups and long shots?\n\nI like to start with closer shots, the usual way was to start with long shots and then move in, but hell, why waste the good performances on long shots? So if I find that I’m going to use Spencer Tracy mostly in close-up, I start with that. E.G. Marshall, a very fine actor who died recently, had to speak a line off-camera to Tracy, so he was standing beside the camera. Tracy did the first take, a rather long speech, and I said ‘Cut!’ and looked around. E.G. was crying; the tears were running down his face, the cameraman was crying, everybody was weeping. Not because it was a sad scene, on the contrary, but because Tracy did it so beautifully.\n\nYou have taught film at the University of Texas at Austin, and later on, also at the University of Southern California. Have you been able to convince your students about all of this, so that they could put it into their own work as well?\n\nNo, not really. They’re mostly attracted to technical things now. They want to make films the way George Lucas makes them. All the oldtimers—Louis B. Mayer, Samuel Goldwyn, all of them—were people who cared about souls and feelings. They cared about what they were saying. Like a housewife who’s baking a cake: she wants it to be perfect. They wanted it to be perfect. The way they did it, was by not interfering with the man who was making it. They were smart enough to hire who they thought would be a good person to direct it, and then they let him make it. They hired what they thought was talent. Even Harry Cohn [Columbia], who was known as a rough, cruel man in some ways, was someone you could count on. You see, our past filmmaking executives weren’t educated men, mostly. Very few of them had gone to college. And it doesn’t mean a thing really. If you have a feeling for telling stories with heart, you don’t have to go to college. Today, it’s a case of making money. Money, money, money. They all go to Harvard Business School or someplace like that, they’ll come out as lawyers or business executives, and many want to make films. The funny thing is, they tell themselves that they know pictures. What they believe, what they know, is what kind of films will make money. So my point is that almost every picture I’ve made, has made money. In my office I have many plaques and awards of money-making top five films over many years, so you can make money with good pictures. But I never said, ‘I’m going to make this picture because it’s going to make money.’ Also, I still get letters, fan letters, for those same films—today!\n\nIs it true what they say, that you’re only as good as your last film?\n\nOh no, if someone makes a good film followed by some bad films, he’d still be up there, possibly making millions of dollars. People will give him another chance because they think he will come back. That’s another thing happening in Hollywood that I consider bad. Everybody thinks he can do everything. Actors become directors; writers are becoming directors, while each is a special talent. In the days of the studio system, an actor or actress was happy to be the best he or she could be and become a star. We have no stars today as in those days. And where are the great screenwriters? Where’s the romance? I don’t know what is going to happen. I don’t think I’ll live to see it all, or see any of it as a matter of fact. I don’t think I’ll live to see the changes.\n\nEncino, California\n\nApril 10, 1999\n\n+ Mr. Dmytryk passed away on July 1, 1999, in his home in Encino, at age 90, from heart and kidney failure.\n\nFILMS\n\nONLY SAPS WORK (1930) DIR Cyril Gardner, Edwin H Knopf SCR Sam Mintz, Joseph L.
