THE CAST Nancy Scroggs Zazu Pitt? £eter David Butler Ezra Scroggs Jack McDonald Si Whittaker Wm. Devaull Jack Ransom Hugh Fay Tony George Hackathorne Produced by Brentwood Film Corp. Written and Directed by King Vidor. PRESS NOTICE What everybody is hoping and living for will arrive at the theatre on of week: \" Better Times.\" This is the newest photoplay written and directed by King Vidor, the author and director of \" The Turn in the Road.\" When Robertson-Cole selected this production from the Brentwood list for Exhibitors-Mutual distribution, the theatre, remembering King Vidor's past screen successes, quickly booked it and reports have it that \" Better Times \" is another perfect gem. Picture an ambitious young girl with a shiftless father who is proprietor of a dilapidated hotel in a run-down health resort. No guests, no servants, no cook, no driver for the bus or the \" car \" to meet the incoming trains. And a rival hotel, more up-to-date, gathering in all the few arriving guests. But Nancy drags out the old Ford (1902 Model) and fairly kidnaps a young man who carelessly allowed the other bus to get away from the depot. She gives him the roughest riding he ever had. And she makes him like it. She becomes clerk, bellhop and maid in turn and he boosts the cooking of the old colored cook that Nancy secured, so that in time the guests of the other hotel come over to Nancy's hotel enmasse. When the young man leaves hurriedly and Nancy's father dies after gambling away the now paying hotel, she finds herself with six thousand dollars life insurance and attends a young ladies seminary to polish up. But how about her sweet.heart? Well, she attends a ball game and then — well, then someone makes a three-base hit with two men on bases, and Nancy — well, you will find out when you see \" Better Times.\" The cast is heralded as a particularly strong and well balanced one in support of Zazu Pitts as Nancy. Much interest has been aroused among Christian Scientists after Nancy successfully demonstrates to her young guest that the doctor's order for a thin diet was all bunk and that he should eat all he desired. THE STORY Nancy Scroggs helped her shiftless father take care of a dilapidated hotel in the run-down health resort. As she began to get ambitious the old Ford car was brought out and she determined to make the trains as of yore. But all of the very few arrivals preferred to go to the other rival hotel and the \" Lakeview \" was without a single paying guest until Nancy fairly kidnapped a young man who stepped off the train after the team from the rival hotel had left. She promptly becomes bell-hop, maid and clerk. An old colored woman is installed as cook for the single guest. He has to refuse the offerings of \" the best cook in the country \" until Nancy quotes a little \" Christian Science \" phrase which he promptly heeds and thereafter eats to his heart's content, scorning the advice of the doctor who had prescribed a certain abstaining but not sustaining diet. He spreads the news of the great eats around among the guests of the other hotel and they all finally swarm over to the \" Lakeview.\" But daddy is too busy playing horseshoes and Nancy has to take full charge of the now crowded hotel. Her father finally gambles the hotel away and disappears. When his hat is discovered on the lake shore it develops that he has drowned and Nancy gets $6,000 worth of his life insurance. Previous to this event, young Peter, her first guest, had fallen in love with Nancy and she thought that he was just about the only man in the world for her. But he was called away suddenly and his letters to her were destroyed by her father. A young lady's school was Nancy's next step, as she was ambitious to become a polished young lady. When all the other girls received letters from sweethearts she wrote letters to herself and signed them with the name of a famous ball player. The denouement came when the team that \" Spike Macauley \" was playing on, appeared in a nearby city and Nancy was a member of the box party that attended from the school. An envious and suspicious girl had found out that Nancy was writing the letters signed \" Macauley \" to herself and wanted to humiliate Nancy. But when Spike comes over it developed that he was her first paying guest, her long lost sweetheart, and was there not a flying leap made over the rail by Nancy? and didn't she just throw both arms around him? She did. And he did likewise. And \" Better Times \" had arrived for both. PROGRAM READER Nancy Scroggs derives her quaint philosophy anent the cure for human ills from the words of wisdom printed on a calendar. She upsets all traditions and declares that the doctor's prescription of a very weak, slim diet for the only paying guest in her father's hotel is all bunk. And she proves it by developing a very athletic sweetheart whom she afterwards wins for a husband. And all this was of course contrary to the average landlord's code of ethics. The very idea of encouraging a young man to eat more heartily when he was paying for eating practically nothing had he heeded his doctor's advice. But Nancy was grooming a future husband with the assistance of a very wise calendar. And the cat and the goat and the chickens, real farmyard chickens, were willing assistants in Nancy's campaign. A young lady's boarding school taxed Nancy's ingenuity finally, but she was victorious. She plunged over the rail and clasped her arms around the neck of the star ball player at the base ball game and won her man. All this and more in \" Better Times,\" to be seen at this theatre next week. SUGGESTIONS Try and secure a list of the members of the Christian Science churches and mail them a spe-. cial invitation to see their beliefs demonstrated in a photoplay. Then emphasize in all your advertising that \" Better Times \" is here at the theatre. The title is very elastic and provides many opportunities for catch phrases. Give Zazu Pitts credit as a discovery of a new star who appeared in mediocre parts in Mary Pickford productions. She is alive, virile, active, natural and unaffected. CATCH LINES She treated his stomach humanely against the doctor's orders, and thus won the way to his heart. Nancy had to get milk quickly for the only paying guest and got the goat of the farmyard favorite. She was not a regular baseball rooter, but supplied the only sensation of the game when she threw herself in the arms of the pinch hitter. After she collected the insurance she attended a girls' seminary to polish up — and she did. A calendar supplied her with food for thought and she embraced it in direct contradiction to established theories. \" OH, BOY! \" (Continued from page 4221) tq appear together, a fact which you might mention. Another point about their first offering which should make money for you is the fact that it is an adaptation of the big New York musical comedy success. The piece had a phenomenal run on the stage. If you write your arguments around the story just mention it briefly. Tell your crowd that it is a youthful romance of two undergraduates who get themselves and their elders in all kinds of trouble before Cupid leaves them in isolated happiness. Use the catch line idea. The title will suggest good copy. It is a popular expression nowadays. Bring out that it is a highly amusing comedy. And mention the fact that it was adapted and directed by Capellani, the man responsible for the Nazimova picture, \" The Red Lantern.\" Mention members of the cast. They are well known. Zazu Pitts and David Butler in the Brentwood production, \" Better Times,\" which RobertsonCole is releasing through Exhibitors Mutual"
