We then put all the names in a hat and for some reason, we spun a wheel and selected a winner.\n\nThe winner is Allison Cohen. Congratulations Allison. You have won a brand new Sonos Roam speaker.\n\nWe will be getting your address and shipping that out to you. Thank you to everyone who played along.\n\nThat was a long game.\n\nIt was a long game with a lot of workouts.\n\nA lot of work.\n\nWhat fun thing we’ll come up with next?\n\nI don’t know. Let’s give it a minute.\n\nTake a beat. What pray tell do you have in store for people?\n\nWe have part two of our Ross Rayburn Book Club interview. We also have a bunch of In The News items from Peloton. There’s some fun stuff on the list this week, like a Peloton employee winning gold at the Olympics. We have the Peloton bike being removed from the rental program. There’s this weird outage that occurred that we have to talk about, new events are popping up, and hotels are being added. There’s a whole bunch of stuff. We also have a visit from Angelo from MetPro and we’re going to talk about when you’re looking at a strength class, how to tell if that class focuses on endurance or hypertrophy.\n\nI think that is important especially because it seems like more and more people are starting to get into the strength training with Peloton.\n\nWe also have a bunch of In The News for instructors, then we have the Artists Series. This whole story about Strava is hilarious. I can’t wait to talk about that. Celebrity sightings, past guest updates, and then there’s In Case You Missed It and new content. Lots of stuff.\n\nBefore we get to all that, shameless plugs. Don’t forget, we’re available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, iHeart, and TuneIn. Wherever you find a podcast, you can find us. While you’re there, be sure and follow us so you never miss an episode. Maybe leave us a review. It’s super helpful. It’s greatly appreciated. You can find us on Facebook at Facebook.com/TheClipOut. While you’re there, like the page and join the group. It’s a great way to stay up to date on things throughout the week. It’s a way to communicate with us and communicate with other listeners, especially the group.\n\nYou can find us on Patreon at Patreon.com/TheClipOut. Lots of work goes into something like this and there are lots of expenses. If you have a little extra money, If you wouldn’t mind throwing $5 a month and helping the show, that is certainly welcome. What do you get for your $5? You get ad-free episodes. If we get it early, you get it early, and you get extra content. We record a bonus episode every week with another 15, 20, or 25 minutes, depending on how much is going on in the world of Peloton, what weird stuff is going on in our lives, and how gabby we are.\n\nIt does play.\n\nThat’s pretty long, 25 minutes. It’s a nice way to help keep the articles coming, the lights on, and the Wi-Fi working. You can watch all of these over on YouTube at YouTube.com/TheClipOut. Finally, don’t forget our newsletter that you can sign up for at TheClipOut.com, where we will send you mostly a weekly reminder that we exist. It has all the links and stuff that we talk about every week in the show. You don’t have to go hunt them down, or if you want to fact-check us to see if we’re completely full of crap.\n\nYou could do that too.\n\nOne of us is, but that’s not the person who picks the stories, so you will not catch us. There’s all that. Let’s get in. Shall we?\n\nWe shall.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nWe learned that the Peloton bike has been removed from the rental program, so you can only rent the Bike+.\n\nThere are other items you can rent. You can rent the Tread+. You can rent those over there as well but no longer the original bike. I saw on one of the many Facebook groups I follow that somebody was surprised that these old tablets are being discontinued. They no longer have support. That makes me think that there are still people out there who have not heard that about a year ago, Peloton said that anybody with a quartz tablet was going to no longer be able to access any of the content after a certain date. We’ve reached that time frame. We have an article out on our website about that. The reason that I bring that up is because I can’t help but wonder if these things are the beginning of the end for the original bike. They’re facing it out slowly.\n\nBy the end of the Bike, do you mean that the original bike will go away and there will be a new updated version of the Bike versus Bike+ or that you see a future where there is no better option? The Bike+ becomes the Bike.\n\nI do but I will also say with the caveat that they’re still no firm leadership in place, like a long-term plan. It’s hard to tell what their new strategy is going to be. When Barry was the leader, he was very much like let’s get rid of all of the hardware. He wanted to become software only and focus on subscriptions.\n\nThat seemed a bridge too far to me to have no physical products.\n\nI would agree with that, but he did have some logic to the fact that you can’t do research and development on everything. You can’t grow everything at once. You can’t grow internationally and add more products and better software options all at the same time, especially when you’re already hurting on cash. That makes sense to me too. Right now, we’re in this in-between space where we don’t know what the company wants to focus on. We just know where Barry left things. That’s why I see it as for now, I believe that they might be narrowing things down, where there will be a bike-only path. That is what I believe. Does that make sense?\n\nIt makes sense or maybe in the short term, they’re like, “We’re making no decision,” and that making more bikes is a decision. They’re going to be like, “We’re going to leave it alone. Those are our sunsetting, so we’ll let the next guy figure out if we’re going to fire that back up.”\n\nMaybe they’re eventually trying to go from that better best down to just one.\n\n“This is what we got.”\n\nWe talked about a while back too that if they were going to keep the Tread+, they were probably going to need to re-launch that in the next year or two. No word on that. I’m not saying that’s happening, but that logically makes sense to me because the hardware and software that goes into the Tread+ are from 2018. At this point, it’s five years old already. I think it’s probably time to think about jazzing it up.\n\nYou’re going to want the Tread++.\n\nIt’s got to have a name first. We don’t even know.\n\nThe Tread++ is the name.\n\nYou just named it? Is that what it’s going to be called?\n\nThe Tread++?\n\nI don’t know, but that’s what I think. If they do that, there are a lot of people who can’t afford the room or the money for a Tread+. That’s where I’m not sure that makes sense.\n\nWith the Tread, they either have to keep both or they could only have a regular tread because there are so many people that it’s not even they can’t afford it. They physically can’t accommodate it.\n\nThat’s what I meant about afford. It was the space and the money. People fall into one of those two groups. A lot of people fall into one of those two groups. I very clearly remember more than one Peloton employee saying to me that people have never been more adamant about their love for a product than the Tread+. That means to me you would keep that product. If people are that engaged and they love it that much, I cannot see a world where you discontinue that.\n\nI think it makes more sense to have the Tread and Tread+ than it does to have the Bike and Bike+.\n\nI will agree with that as well.\n\nThe differentiation between the Bike and the Bike+ is minimal if you’ve never owned one before. A consumer just entering the space is very confused about what the difference is. Ultimately, the price differential between the two isn’t radical, unlike the price differential between the Tread and a Tread+. I think there are a lot of people who even if they have the room are like, “I love the Tread+ but I don’t know that I want to drop that on. I’m just going to get a Tread.” Maybe what they’re seeing is a good chunk of people already decided to get a Peloton bike and they see the price difference between the Bike and the Bike+, and they’re like, “I’m just going to get the plus”\n\nI do think that’s the way it is. At the time when I bought the Bike+, it felt like it was future-proofing my ability to have that first one. You had that trade-in program at the beginning when they first released it. To me, that was the best deal. To go ahead and do that early on was the best way to do it. Although they’ve lowered and increased prices so much, I have no idea if that’s still true. Can I keep track of the map on that? They’ve stopped moving for a while now. It’s been a while, but there was a time frame when every two months they were moving.\n\nThis will be interesting to watch. We’ll portend for the future of the bike. We had a Peloton employee win an Olympic gold. It’s crazy that it’s not an instructor.\n\nHe won for rowing, but his job title at Peloton is Transportation Department Senior Planner. He’s on the logistics and operations side. As Helper Bee Nikki said, he transported his ass right to that winner’s podium. That’s incredible.\n\nThat’s a team sport. Other people were doing that with him, but still, that’s so amazing. One of the rowing instructors tried out and didn’t quite make it.\n\nHe’s been to the Olympics before Alex has. That’s the rowing instructor you’re talking about. He didn’t make it this time on the rowing team, but Nick Mead made it onto the team. Does Nick not want to be part of the instructor team? He is a shy person.\n\nJust because you have the physical abilities doesn’t necessarily mean you have the public speaking abilities or desire to be a front-facing employee. My first thought was the same one. Why isn’t he an instructor? He could be good at something but not want to get up in front of people and teach every day.\n\nIt was nice that Peloton posted about it. They should they should be celebrating this everywhere. A huge congrats to Nick Mead. It will be cool if he does a class with the rowing instructors. How fun would that be? I think they should. That would be cool. It’s a row with an Olympic champion.\n\nWe had a weird outage issue with on-demand classes.\n\nIt was odd. If you pull up the app, it says, “No classes found.”\n\nPeople are like, “Oh my God, it’s true. Peloton is going out of business there. I had to change my leaderboard name to Chicken Little.”\n\nIt will shock you to hear that some people did panic. It wasn’t in just one area. I don’t know what this means. It happened in the US. It happened in Canada. It happened in the UK. We had people from all over, our tipster teams are International now. We all could not get to it. I don’t know if that means Peloton servers were down and they couldn’t get the information out. They had it back up within an hour. The strangest thing that I found about it was usually when something is not working, you can go over to the status page and find out about it. It wasn’t there. There wasn’t anything there till they had it fixed, which I thought was bizarre. I don’t know what’s happening.\n\nThat’s very weird. Both PSL and PSNY are hosting a Pace Targets event.\n\nThe thing that I find interesting about this is that they are doing this at PSNY and London on two different days, August 15th will be the New York date and the London date will be August 16th. I also find it interesting that they’re doing a behind-the-scenes. They’re unveiling it. I feel like that’s interesting. They also are going to be explaining how to incorporate it into your training routine. This is an in-person event at Peloton Studios New York. You cannot join it online at either of the locations. I find that whole thing fascinating. I don’t know if they’re trying to get people to use it. This is very different for Peloton. Why are we doing this?\n\nWhat’s the point of doing something that you can only do in person for a company like Peloton?\n\nI don’t know. I find the whole thing strange. I don’t have an answer for you, but it’s weird to me.\n\nVery much so.\n\nThey’re going to do that. They’re going to have a demonstration. They’re going to talk about where you can find the Pace Target classes on the tread. They’re going to talk about how they’re producing classes specifically for the Pace Targets and they’re also going to talk about how you can use those Pace Targets to improve your fitness. Another thing that’s weird to me about it being in person is you can only take these classes on your tread. It’s weird that you have to leave your house to go do this demonstration. Maybe they’re going to do it in the treadmill area. I don’t know. I have no idea because they are going to have a demonstration. I’m not trying to be negative about it. I’m just baffled.\n\nIt’s confusing. If we figure it out, we will let people know. Athletech has an article about Free Motion Fitness, etc. Buried in that article, it talks about the fact that Hyatt has signed a deal and they’re adding Pelotons to 800 locations.\n\nThat is fascinating. I thought that Voco Hotel was also adding them. I did a Ctrl F on Peloton when you included the article and that’s what I found in it that I thought was Peloton-related. Maybe this is just in the UK since it’s talking about Free Motion, which is a UK-based fitness thing but it says Hyatt is adding.\n\nThis probably isn’t new then because we already knew about the Hyatt deal. It was a while back.\n\nAre you sure it’s not the Hilton?\n\nNo. Hilton is old, but I think they did Hyatt last year too. I thought this was another one and I thought it was specifically the UK. That’s the only reason I included it. I should read these better.\n\nWe have a lot going on and day jobs.\n\nThere’s that. Sorry. If you missed it, Peloton teamed up with Hyatt.\n\nWhat do you find out about Tread+? Crystal is getting delivered any day now. Lululemon has added sometime in the last eight years new perks for members. One of them is Peloton-related.\n\nEverybody already knows about it. That’s information everybody has. The reason that I included this is because I thought it was fascinating how many things are included in the Lululemon essential membership. If you don’t know about the Peloton deal, they have this thing called partner perks. When you sign up for their essential membership, it’s free. It’s easy to join. Just add your name and email address, and then you get a bunch of benefits. For some of those, you can have exchanges or credit on sale items. You get invited to membership-only events, receipt-free returns, early access to product drops, free hemming, and free Peloton classes in the Lululemon app.\n\nIn August, what is going to be added is they have 10% off of Barry’s bootcamp. You can join Lifetime Fitness. You can get a 60-day free trial on the Peloton app. You can sign up for a one-month free trial for a class pass. You can get $5 off your first purchase on the sweet green app. You can save 50% on La La Land’s Lulu latte. I know it’s exciting. The one that you probably care a little bit more about is the AG1 that I love. First-time subscribers get ten free travel packs and then if you have an Oura Ring, you get a free six-month membership to go with your ring. Hyperice, you can get 20% off the brand’s Hypervolt Go 2, and then 15% off of everything else. That’s a lot of perks.\n\nThat’s a whole lot of stuff. A lot of it is like trying this thing that’s going to cost more money down the road, but it’s a way to try it I guess.\n\nIt’s interesting because Lululemon is funneling them and they’re all fitness and health-related. That feels worth mentioning. I wonder if there’s going to be other companies that follow suit.\n\nIf it works. Coming back after this, we’re going to talk to Angelo. If you are just now starting your strength training journey, and you’re a little confused about endurance in hypertrophy, what is what, and which classes are doing what so you can get what you want out of these classes, Angelo will walk you through how to figure out if a class focuses on endurance or hypertrophy. Stick around.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nJoining us once again is Angelo from MetPro, here to answer all of your fitness and nutrition questions.\n\nMy friends, it’s good to see you again.\n\nIt’s good to see you too. I know why this person is asking this question that I’m going to ask, and it is very Peloton-related. I know you can help us find some good ways to answer this. In the Peloton world, they label everything in a strength class as strength. It doesn’t break things down. The most that it breaks things down is body weight or body type. Connie’s Life Choice choices, which is her leaderboard name, is looking for how to know when a strength class is more of an endurance strength or cardio, versus hypertrophy or strength building. They don’t label them like that in the Peloton world, and I know that’s why she’s asking. I’m curious if you have any thoughts on that.\n\nThis is a fascinating subject. The main reason for the confusion is that back in the ‘70s or ‘60s, we invented this concept of reps. Three sets of ten reps. Is it higher reps? Is that cardio or is that strength training? Lower that strength. The concept of reps is not a thing. It is a way for us to measure the time under tension. To create a hypertrophic environment and to build muscle, what you want to do is bring your muscles to failure or close to it.\n\nThere’s a ton of new research coming out that’s confirming that it is reaching that point of failure or fatigue close to it. You can build muscle in the higher and lower rep ranges. It’s just a lot more painful to do in the higher rep ranges. Most people who are doing a higher rep range are stopping because they’re tired, not necessarily because a muscle group reached failure.\n\nWhat we find is the research points to anything where your muscles are failing in less than about 60 seconds has a hypertrophic component. In other words, it will elicit some muscle development. However, for maximum muscle development typically, you’re going to pick an activity that brings your muscle to failure in about 30 seconds. Thirty seconds happens to coincide with about 10 to 12 reps for most movements. That’s where we got that rep range from.\n\nWhat you can do is when you’re looking at or experiencing those Peloton workouts, if you are doing an activity that includes weights but it is not bringing your muscles to failure or very close to it, rather you’re just moving through exercise and movements that are working muscles but it’s more exhaustion over time, that will condition. Sometimes you hear the word tone, although that’s a media marketing made-up term, but it will work the muscles to a degree.\n\nYou can pretty much guarantee you’re not going to build a lot of muscle mass in that environment compared to if you’re getting off the Peloton and you are picking up a set of weights and you are doing, whether it’s 10, 15, 20, or more reps, but in less than about a minute, bringing a muscle group to failure. That’s strength. That’s hypertrophic and you’re achieving what I think you’re aiming for.\n\nTo give you a little idea of how we categorize workout modalities at MetPro, we have three categories that we consider leaning towards the aerobic side, and then three categories that we consider leaning towards the hypertrophic or strength side. The extreme aerobic category is endurance, bicycling, running, or things along those. What you have is something like cardio circuits where you’re moving constantly but never bringing a muscle group to failure.\n\nYou have something like interval training or high-intensity interval training where you’re doing an all-out push for 30 to 90 seconds. That can be, to a degree, hypertrophic, but it’s still mostly in the aerobic category, then you cross that threshold to where it’s dominant strength and that’s going to be your actual cross-training that includes weights, your strength training, and your powerlifting instead of cardio circuits and strength circuits where you’re lifting weights. Think about when you’re doing your activity what is included, and then you’ll know how far into the anaerobic or strength side you’re leaning versus just the aerobic.\n\nThat’s a very good breakdown.\n\nTo live authentically, you become the author of the creation, sustenance, and imprint of your own life. Share on X\n\nThat’s probably why I like strength training better because the faster you fail, the better you’re doing. I don’t like to brag but I fail quickly. Not to toot my own horn, but toot, toot. I love your take on tone as well.\n\nIt is a joke. You always hear people say that Titan and Tone. I’m like, “That’s not a thing.”\n\nIt’s like the strength training equivalent of zesty. You know what it means, but it doesn’t mean anything.\n\nMarketing makes people think it’s the sweet spot where you have enough but not too much. Your body biologically doesn’t respond that way. That’s like saying, “I only want to drive 60 miles an hour on the highway, so I’m going to go slow to get there.” If you want only a little bit of muscle, brain for that little bit of muscle optimally for muscle, and then stop or move into maintenance once you achieve that, instead of doing an activity that’s inefficient to get there.\n\nIf you do want some strength, push those muscles to muscular fatigue or failure, and then simply move into maintenance once you have as much muscle as you want. That’s where the whole concept of tone comes from. It’s not a thing. It’s a state of having blood pumped into your muscles and it looks good. That’s the tone. You’re always going to get some of that when you exercise.\n\nWhat I hear him saying is tone is you’re half-assing.\n\nTom said it. I didn’t.\n\nThank you so much for all that. If people would like this stuff tailor-made for their fitness journey, where can they find you and/or Crystal?\n\nYou can find us at MetPro.co/tco.\n\nThank you.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nEverybody is talking about the Olympics but in the middle of all this, there was the USA Cycling National Championships. Christine D’Ercole won a gold medal there.\n\nYet another. How many of these did she have now? She’s got a ton. I can’t even imagine having that many gold medals. These championships go on for a long time. They last for days. She is still in the middle of it while we’re recording. There are probably more medals to come.\n\nEven more medals as we record this.\n\nShe is saying that they’re aiming to finish the race on Saturday. We’ll see how the weather holds and if that’s possible, but congrats to Christine.\n\nWhile we’re recording this, she is winning more medals and Hyatt is adding more Pelotons.\n\nOne of those is true.\n\nMatt Wilpers popped up on TV. He was on the New York Living Show.\n\nHe was talking all about tips for running in the hot weather. There are a lot of places right now that can use these tips. I talked to a lot of people across the United States and it’s miserable for a lot of them.\n\nWas his tip like, “Buy a Peloton tread. Thanks for tuning in?”\n\nThey are hot weather running tips. This was specific. For running outside in the heat. Things like making sure you have lots of water, you’re well hydrated, you go a little bit slower in the heat and things like that. It’s cool that he was able to be part of this and give such great advice to people\n\nA friendly reminder to everyone that Susie Chan’s book is now available for purchase in the United States.\n\nCan I talk about how great it is? I love this book so much. I still have a little bit of the book left to read. I have read most of the book at this point. I don’t want to tell spoilers for anybody but the stories in this will change your view on these races. The way she approaches them, in no way, is something that I could do. The way that I pick apart everything is I have to have a plan for everything and worry about everything. It is the exact polar opposite of Susie Chan. It makes it even more inspiring the things that she accomplished because there wasn’t a checklist. It’s amazing.\n\nYou’re like, “No checklist? What are you, Tom?”\n\nI can’t believe it. I also did not know the health struggles that she had. I didn’t know her proposal story, which I’m not going to spoil but it’s in the book. This whole book has been so delightful and it is delivered with Susie’s typical way of telling stories, which is to say so humble. She acts like it’s another day, “Did I break a world record?”\n\nWhat you can do.\n\nI have a major health scare and have to go to the hospital and have emergency surgery. Solid day in the life of Susie Chan.\n\nYou did that one.\n\nThat’s true. It’s very different from her experience though. It’s so inspiring and delightful. It’s a great book. If you haven’t had a chance to read it, I highly recommend you do. You can find the link on my website if you can’t find it on our website. You can also find it in my LinkedIn bio on Instagram.\n\nRight now, you can get on your Kindle for $10.\n\nIs that true? I didn’t know that. It wasn’t there yesterday.\n\nWhen I looked at it today, it was $9.99 for Kindle.\n\nIt’s a great book. Well worth it.\n\nComing up after this, we’re going to tell you the latest artist series. It features someone who broke a record at Lollapalooza. I’ll tell you what that record is after this.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nThe latest artist series features Chappell Roan.\n\nI have never heard of Chappell Roan in my life, but I was listening to a Spotify playlist the other day and I was told to put it on something. I don’t even remember what it was, and it randomly brought up Chappell Roan.\n\nFirst off, there is nothing random about the Spotify algorithm.\n\nIt’s fair, but randomly to me. It even played the hot-to-go song, which is her big hit that everybody loves. It was fun. It’s a great song and it’s not something that would be on my adult radar. If I were younger, this would be something I would listen to and I’m sure I still will. How fun is that?\n\nShe was at Lollapalooza and she swapped set times and locations with Kesha. They moved her to the main stage but in the daytime. This is the record she broke. They said it was the largest attendance ever for a daytime mainstage performance.\n\nGo, Chappell Roan. That’s so cool. There’s a bunch of classes. Seven different classes are coming out.\n\nThey snagged her just in time.\n\nThey sure did. Good for her and that’s a good deal for Peloton too.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nYou came across an interesting post about Strava Jockeys.\n\nThis is fascinating.\n\nThis is so dumb.\n\nIf you need to make some extra cash, you can become a Strava Jockey. What you do is log in to other people’s accounts and do their workouts for them and they get the credit\n\nFor why?\n\nBecause according to this, in most cases, they are people who are busy professionals who don’t have time to dedicate to their workouts. They want everyone to think that they’re working out, then they do, especially if they’re they’re doing competitions. Maybe there’s a walking competition at their work or maybe there is a marathon they’re training for and things like that.\n\nI get it if there’s a competition at work, even though it’s bad and you shouldn’t do it. I at least understand that, but having someone else train for your marathon, at some point, you’re going to have to run that marathon and your body is going to say, “What did he train?”\n\nAlso, I would never make any money at it because the faster you are, the more money goes up.\n\nIf you want them to have better times, you pay them more. To what end?\n\nThey want the social currency from this. It started as a joke, but then it caught on.\n\nWhat sucks is that these are probably CEOs, movers, and shakers in companies who are decision-makers. If this is a decision you make, you shouldn’t be allowed to make decisions on behalf of a company. You’re going to make dumb decisions because you just did. It’s shady for no reason.\n\nNo one cares. It’s your Strava. Why do you care what other people think that much?\n\nDo people look at other people’s Strava?\n\nPeople do.\n\nI couldn’t give a shit.\n\nYou don’t have a Strava.\n\nI don’t care what other people’s exercise regimens are.\n\nI would have to agree. I just do my thing.\n\nYou probably have two people that actually look at it.\n\nI can’t imagine not only the caring part of it but also all the work you have to put into it to figure out the logistics of how many miles that pretending person is going to do or whatever, and then you have to set aside a budget for it. That seems like more work than going out and doing it. I would feel gross. I could never post something like that.\n\nIf you do it long enough, at some point, people will look at you and be like, “BS.”\n\nWhen you love something, you find the time for it. Share on X\n\nThere are lots of skinny people that everybody thinks are fit but they aren’t. That’s been going on for years.\n\nI could hire Adrian Williams to do a Tonal workout for me, but nobody would believe it.\n\nI thought this was endlessly fascinating.\n\nAlso, endlessly stupid.\n\nAs I said, it started as a joke and then caught on.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nSpoilers for a Wolverine Deadpool coming your way here. if you haven’t seen it yet and it matters to you, the movie made like $500 million domestically.\n\nIt was so good.\n\nIt was fun. I think if you care, you’ve seen it. Anyway, Jennifer Garner pops up in the movie to play Electra once more. The reason we’re telling you this is she’s posted on her Instagram her training. I wouldn’t say to get back in shape like she wasn’t in shape. She said, “I was in shape but I wasn’t in Marvel shape,” which is a very different thing. She posted a video of all the things she did. One of the things she was doing was Peloton.\n\nI was also surprised and saddened to realize that it was 2004 the last time she was Electra. It didn’t seem that long ago. Twenty years.\n\nIt was so long ago that the soundtrack was what made Evanescence famous. That’s the movie that Bring Me to Life was on. It was featured on the soundtrack back when movies had soundtracks. One of the last big movies that had an honest-to-God soundtrack with artists you’ve heard of. It had new songs that weren’t just compilations. Deadpool probably has a soundtrack or playlists, but it’s all songs you already know.\n\nThey do and Spotify is pushing it out. It’s a whole thing. They have a whole channel.\n\nThey can’t have Like A Prayer on it. They wouldn’t let them do it. They let them have it in the movie, but they couldn’t put it on the soundtrack and they couldn’t even put it on a Spotify playlist.\n\nWhy does she care?\n\nBecause she’s got some 40th anniversary or however long that song is coming out for it. She didn’t want to cut into that. I think it’s a little bit of a different crowd.\n\nThis movie was great. This video that she did was great. I loved seeing her workout routine and it was a lot of fun. For those of you who aren’t aware, Jennifer Garner has been a Peloton user for years and she’s also super great friends with Chelsea Jackson Roberts. They post meditation together all the time. They are good friends. Jennifer Garner is a friend of Peloton and we wish that we were her friends because she’s freaking awesome. She has one of the best lines in the movie. That’s all I’ll say about that.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nThere are a lot of past guest updates in this segment because we got Laurie Condon and Jenn’s Men. We’ve interviewed a good chunk of them. They are doing the 8th Annual Spin for a Cure.\n\nI can’t believe it’s 8th Annual. What they typically do is take over the studio for a class. A lot of times, this is in April, but because there was a bunch of time maybe it’s June. Usually, they do it at a different time of year, but Jenn was out due to vacation so they pushed it. By the time everybody could make it happen, it was going to be September. This will be taking place on Sunday, September 8th. There’s going to be a live class at the Peloton Studio. JSS is teaching it. Spin for a Cure is going to auction off several bikes. The idea is to break last year’s goal. It was a record.\n\nBy bikes, you mean a seat in the class. Not a bike.\n\nI do mean that. That’s a great point.\n\nThe lawyers in my ear were like, “You need to shut her down or we’re going to have to give away bikes.” We’ve done that and it was a shit show.\n\nWe are not shipping bikes. You can do a few things. You can join the team that exists for Jenn’ Men. You can decide to donate to the team. You can try to bid for one of these bikes. By the way, it is not cheap. The cool part is all of the money goes straight to the Alzheimer’s organization. They do it because they want to end Alzheimer’s.\n\nPast guest Sara Confino. I’m trying to remember if we actually interviewed her.\n\nTechnically, she is not a past guest if you are a Clip Out purist.\n\nHowever, there are only two of them, and both of them are you.\n\nIf you followed along with our book club, then you already know about Sara Confino who is an amazing author. I read her book that we did for the book club. It was so good and it was a lot of fun. She was a great guest. She posted this week that of all people, Snoop Dogg was reading her book, and I thought that was freaking delightful\n\nThere’s a picture of him on the interwebs just sitting there, lounging, and reading Sara Confino’s book on a plane.\n\nIf you don’t know, Sara Confino is not only an amazing author. She’s also a Peloton user. When we are telling you about this, it is because she does Peloton.\n\nWe meant to reach out to her after the book club to have her back on as a guest.\n\nWe should do that.\n\nYou should add that to your to-do list. You’re welcome.\n\nThanks.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nLet’s talk TCO Top Five. You tell us your favorite classes and then we tell them back to you. Jumping right in, and these are not in order of importance. I need to clarify that to everyone. The first one, your favorite cardio.\n\nThis class was taught by Rebecca Kennedy on July 12th. It was a 30-minute low-impact cardio. Tiffany Cortez recommended this class. She said, “It was so fun. It’s a step workout and brought back all my memories from doing step classes in the ‘90s.” She was so engrossed. She didn’t even look at the clock. People have been talking about this particular class non-stop because she designed it in a way that you could use it with a step at home. She does not have one in the studio, but you can use what’s at home and get the benefits of using a step. I have a feeling we might be seeing more of these in the future because it was popular.\n\nThis is the new product designs they’re coming out with. There’s a box.\n\nWe’re taking it back to the ‘90s.\n\nYou don’t have to worry about updates or downloads. Here’s a box, step on it. Number two, your favorite row.\n\nThis class was taught by Alex Karwoski. It was on July 29th. It was a 30-minute endurance row. Sarah Lester loved it. She said, “If they gave out awards for exercise classes, this class would at least get a nomination. Even if you don’t have a row, it’s still worth listening to.”\n\nThat’s a bold statement.\n\nIt gets confusing. This is a little bit of a roller coaster with Sarah Lester. She got to hang in there. She says, “At first, I was underwhelmed. The first 25 minutes were interesting. I wasn’t sure why he was talking about it, given we’re in July, but then he wrapped it up with a brilliant bow in the last five minutes. I won’t spoil the ending, but he was humble, thankful, funny, retrospective, and forward-thinking all in one. Brilliant.”\n\nFascinating. Number three, your favorite walk run.\n\nThis was taught way back. We’re going into the archive. December 15th, 2020.\n\nYou have to wear a mask to take this class.\n\nYou do, although it might get pretty exhausting. You’re in your basement. I don’t think you have to wear a mask at home. We never had to do that at home.\n\nI did sometimes. I wasn’t sure about you guys.\n\nYou never got COVID. That was the right call. This was a 60-minute walk-plus-run with Matt Wilpers. Christina Ribeiro said that she loved that this class could be taken on the tread or outside. She ended up taking it as an endurance run outside. She learned so much from that about the benefits of a walk-run approach during a long-distance race with some tips added regarding conditioning, mobility, and strength. As with any other of Matt’s classes, it was class. The playlist is a journey that goes from the ‘70s all the way through the 2000s.\n\nNumber four, your favorite bike-themed class.\n\nThis one was a group. Sometimes we have these. Rockstalgia classes with Charlotte Weidenbach. These classes are in German but they are rock music. If you have taken some German instructors, this is your hint to do that. Susan loves these classes because the music and Charlotte’s presence are amazing. They’re in German, but they have easy-to-follow German subtotals. There are currently six classes in the series which you can find under Collections on the Peloton platform, and each has an amazing playlist.\n\nFinally, your unstackable.\n\nAgain, there’s a little bit of a stretch because it’s a whole group. It’s a strength series. For unstackable, any of the Roll Call classes with various instructors. They are on a daily schedule with past classes being available under Collections. You can take the guesswork out of picking your strength classes. They dropped each week or they were dropping each week. I don’t think they drop anymore, but you will get a great workout for every part of the body and you get to try different instructors. Karen Marquez recommended these classes saying she likes them. They have a bite-sized link and you get a level of soreness that makes these unstackable.\n\nNow let’s take a look at what is going on or about to be going on this week at Peloton. We are celebrating ten years of Cody. By we, I mean you guys. Not that I’m against Cody. I just don’t want to take a class.\n\nI understand. There’s going to be a special 30-minute pop ride on Friday, August 9th at 11:30 AM, Eastern. He is going to be celebrating an entire decade of fun.\n\nCongratulations to him. We have a Bollywood Pilates.\n\nOn the 6th, this dropped. A 20-minute pilates class led by Aditi dropped. It’s a great blend of fitness with cultural rhythm, and then that same day, they also had a 30-minute Disney 2000s ride with Cody. Another good Disney class.\n\nFinally, we have Rising Country.\n\nI forgot to mention that there was also a 20-minute Disney Run with Marcel Dinkins.\n\nThey could combine that with Ash Pryor’s class and have Rising Country Bear Jamboree.\n\nI don’t think anybody is asking for that. There are going to be four New Rising Country classes and they’re going to be taught by Hannah Corbin, Leanne, Ash, and Matt. They’re going to be on the bike and the row. You’re going to be able to get some new Country classes.\n\nWe talked last week about Rebecca Kennedy’s TLDR. Helper Bee Tina took it and gave us a little review so you know what to expect and see if it’s worth your time.\n\nThe TLDR is awesome. You’re going to get super sore. Rebecca has been listening to the feedback from everyone who has been taking the classes. She’s already been posting answers to questions, concerns, and insights. If you start taking these classes and you have some of these questions, you need to check out her Instagram because she’s got answers to everything. Three days a week, you’re going to get a badge. It’s great music and there are also strategic warm-ups built in to prevent injury.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nWe’ve got two birthdays this week, down from five last week. That was crazy. Talking about going to the Hallmark store. Coming up first, we have Christine D’Ercole on August 11th, and Rebecca Kennedy on August 13th.\n\nHappy birthday to Rebecca and Christine.\n\nComing up after this, if you’re a Patreon subscriber, you don’t have to wait at all. If you’re not, you’re going to have a commercial, and then we will be playing part two of our book club with Ross Rayburn. Join us, won’t you?\n\nTo make meditation worthwhile, you have to know yourself and create the formula that will give you what you need. Share on X\n\n‐‐‐\n\nSanskrit\n\nThis is not on the approved list but I feel like I can ask it as a side note. Are you quite a reader, Ross? I feel like you read a lot.\n\nI have at least eight books going at one time.\n\nYou have quite the vocabulary that has come up a few times in my conversations with other people.\n\nThat’s only because I have vocabulary toilet paper. There’s a word on every sheet. It’s amazing.\n\nWhat was the word of the day?\n\nI’m kidding, Crystal. It’s a joke. I don’t actually have a vocabulary. If someone wants to make it, I’ll buy it but I don’t have that.\n\nIt sounds expensive.\n\nPlus, would you use one? I don’t know.\n\nThat’s a very good point. You might have to make a whole sentence before you can finish your business.\n\nThank you. I appreciate it. It’s a very kind compliment. I love words. I love etymology. Raise your hand if you have kids. If you have kids who are excited about the SATs or in elementary or junior high, Latin is great. That’s what I studied and I did pretty well on the SAT, but study Sanskrit. Sanskrit is at the top of the Indo-European chain. Latin and all the other come from that.\n\nOne of the words in the subtitle is authenticity. This was one of the questions but I’ll try to do the short version of this. The sound “Om” is A, U and M. A is the sound of creation like a baby crying. U is about refinement because you close your mouth and you make the sound U. In the ark of narration, A and U are sustenance in life. The M is the dissolution. It’s one of the few consonants that you can sing and hum.\n\nThere’s a fourth sound called the chorea. That’s the silence between the next wave that’s next to Om. It’s why M, A for the next om is all the matter, mother, and material. Anything to do with creation is M and A. One more thing, the letter T is across because it’s time and space. Anytime you have something that is like the word heart or even fart. Anytime you have RT, R is movement. T is a fixation on time and space.\n\nThat’s why A, U, and T are A creation, U refinement, and T a creation in time and space, so authentic, author, and altier are about creation, sustenance, and a fixated piece of art. Therefore, to live authentically, you become the author, the creation, the sustenance, and the imprint of your life. You write your own story to be authentic. Study Sanskrit.\n\nI want to make sure we get some more of these questions in.\n\nI’ll answer questions shortly, I promise.\n\nMeditation And Yoga\n\nYou are hilarious. Mike Koehler asks, “What is the most impactful experience you’ve had using meditation and yoga to get unstuck?”\n\nTonight.\n\nYou weren’t stuck tonight. I don’t believe it.\n\nHonestly, I’m being a little bit tongue-in-cheek. Whenever I used to travel the world, people would say, “What’s your favorite city?” I would always say the city where I’m in. To get unstuck, it’s every day. Every day I feel stuck. I believe this is a practice that you have to do. Do you know the Sisyphus myth? Hades had Sisyphus rolling the stone up the hill. When he got to the top, the stone rolled back down.\n\nOne of my favorite revelations was when I studied with a professor. He said, “The secret to the Sisyphus myth is Sisyphus found joy in the rolling up of the stone.” We ask those questions like being stuck as if it’s a problem. Like the blue pearl, I believe that when we remember that the blue pearl is there, we use these words like suffering. This is a radical statement and I don’t want to say this cavalierly because when you’re in pain, this is not appropriate to hear.\n\nPlease do not take this out of context, but from a philosophical and theoretical place, as long as you’re not in a place now of trauma. If you are, do me a favor and look at this theoretically. The radical view of this is that even in a moment of great pain, to be able to see that pain as a privilege and to still rise above it or go beneath it and find light. If you’re a religious god or goddess, in that pain. When you’re not in pain, the celebration of abundance is not only better. In my experience, it becomes like this.\n\nI’m now in a great place of abundance. I’m in a room full of people that this is not about me. I don’t feel like I’m in an ego moment now. Especially with Peloton, I feel like I’m in a community that I get to share. I believe that’s my perspective and I don’t come at this from an ego place most of the time, to be fair. I have done the work when things were awful and I do the work when things are awful. When people come into the studio and I get to listen to them and their stories, I’m not jealous or fearful. I know that we’re connected and I celebrate them. I give that unstuckness. That’s why I believe you have to do it every day.\n\nSpeaking of things that you do every day, you’ve talked about when you were writing the book and how you practice every day. You talk about that in the book as well. How did you personally find time to write with all of your other obligations?\n\nThat was not a hard part.\n\nI was looking for some clarity to figure out how to be more efficient for myself.\n\nI’m probably not the best person to ask about that. It’s like when I was nervous about getting a second dog. When you love something, you find the time.\n\nRapid Fire Questions\n\nYou’re right. We’ll do some rapid-fire ones. This one comes from Gwen Dawson, “Do you miss acting?”\n\nNo.\n\nThis one comes from Amy Alstrom, “Would you please consider doing more back-to-sleep meditations? There are only two on the platform.”\n\nIt’s not the right forum for that discussion.\n\nThis one comes from Elizabeth Franks, “Do you have a favorite meditation on the app, whether recorded or it’s done by you or someone else?”\n\nI don’t remember my meditations from yesterday. The way I do meditation is I never script any of my meditations. I plan them out for a couple of days. In the morning, I go inside. I don’t mean this pejoratively, but I asked my teacher and all the teachers that have come before what is the thing to do that is the greatest service I can do today.\n\nIf there’s one thing I believe, there’s a God called Hanuman. He’s the monkey god. He’s often shown ripping open his chest to expose his heart. He’s in the Ramayana, which is one of the epic poets in India. I think of Hanuman like this meditation. I’m going to rip open my chest proverbially. What is that meditation? I honestly don’t know what I’m going to say until it comes out. If you ask me what my meditation was, I couldn’t tell you what it was last time.\n\nWhatever you’re doing, it’s working. Keep it up.\n\nThank you. Honestly, all credit is to Sally Kempton who died in 2023. I call her my Yoda. She’s back here behind me. Remind me to figure out what day she died. The meditation on that day or the day after she died, if I had to pick one, that’s the one I would go to. I don’t remember what day it was because it was the most powerful meditation I’ve ever taught. She’s an amazing being.\n\nThank you for sharing that. Margaret Robertson would like to know how you come up with the stories that you tell during your meditation. I feel like you just answered that.\n\nI do think of those stories before. I do write all my own stories. I told the story about the Chinese proverb, which is one of my favorites. If it sounds like a made-up story, that’s me creating a story based on an idea like if I want the idea to be about generosity. It’s a little bit of planning, letting go, and letting the story be extemporaneous.\n\nAaron would like to know what is your favorite color.\n\nI will say blue, but I don’t know if that’s true anymore. That’s what it was as a kid. I don’t know if I have one, to be honest.\n\nWhat color do you hate?\n\nHere’s the thing. There was a color when I did my first photo shoot. I called it Captain Kirk Green. Do you remember Captain Kirk and the color of his shirt in old-school Star Trek? I got the shirt and I’m like, “Somebody in the wardrobe hates me because this is the worst color.” The picture was so right. It’s one of my favorite pictures I’ve ever taken. It was my skin tone and the lighting. I was like, “Damn it. That is a good color.”\n\nWere you mad a little bit?\n\nI was so happy. It proves that you have to know what you don’t know. This is one thing I learned in Peloton. I worked for myself for twenty years and I joined a team. I joined this beautiful organization that lets people do their job. That’s it. Anyway, that’s what I learned. I was like, “There are people that are good at their job. You don’t have to do everything, Ross.” That was a fantastic learning at the age of 48 at the time.\n\nThat’s a positive spin on that. I love that. Debbie Pino would like to know what your fitness routine looks like currently.\n\nI do a little bit of everything. I always joked that in the ‘90s, I had to come out as a weight lifter. At the time, people were so poo-poo at yoga. I’ve been lifting weights since college in ‘89. I love rowing, by the way. Everybody on my team is wonderful. I love the rowing team so much. They’re such wonderful and beautiful people. The rower is great. I have a meniscus tear. I love cycling but I can’t push myself because the asymmetry of cycling is tough on my knee. Because rowing is a single plane of motion, I was like, “This is amazing.” I am a giant fan of the rower. If you haven’t gotten it or tried it, please do.\n\nCould we start a rumor that you’re going to become the next rowing instructor?\n\nHere’s the thing. I love so much what I do. I believe that for other people, that’s their thing. I don’t want to do everything. I’m so happy. However, the one thing that I have enjoyed is I now teach in the stretch category. I have enjoyed that because you all know how much I love biomechanics and the nerdy stuff. Let’s be honest, there are a lot of people who won’t try yoga because of what they think it is. They’ll try to stretch. It’s been nice to be able to be in that silo because a lot of people then get to see that I do know a lot about the body and it doesn’t have to be yoga.\n\nThat’s a good point because there is this attachment to the word yoga, even though yoga and stretching aren’t all that different.\n\nThey are but let’s just leave it there.\n\nFair enough. What is your best advice for establishing a consistent yoga and meditation schedule? Would it be the program that you have at the end of the book?\n\nYou have to look inside. What I recommend is to ask yourself what it is you need. If you’re the type of person who needs some discipline to progress, then set a schedule. If you’re someone who needs some freedom, then do it when you feel organically inspired to do it. You’ve got to know yourself and do the formula that will give you what you need.\n\nThat makes sense. On that note, do you have advice on how to introvert when life around you is chaotic, especially if you’re new to it?\n\nI do believe in starting simple. Whenever I can’t introvert or get up in the morning, I’m so angry, like I had a dream that makes me so mad, it takes me a while to realize that it’s not true. For whatever reason, like when something has gone wrong in life, I’ll go into the shower and look at the water coming down. I will say to myself, “At least that’s the same. The water still goes down. Gravity didn’t change.” To me, that basic truth is enough to not fix it all but just a moment of reset.\n\nTaking small pauses may not be enough to fix the problem, but it can help you become more of who you already are. Share on X\n\nPause before you speak. You listen to something outside. You put your hand on a tree and say to yourself, “This tree does not give a rats blank about my problems.” Find something that gives you the freedom to take a deep breath. Again, not to fix the problem, but it can be enough to turn you toward the blue pearl, and possibly enough to go in a new direction, and this is what I’ll close with, maybe even enough to become more of who you already are.\n\nEpisode Wrap-Up\n\nThat’s beautiful. Thank you so much for all of this, Ross. We appreciate your time. Everybody that I have talked to has very much enjoyed your book. I enjoyed your book. I enjoyed reading it. I’ve recommended it to so many people, including a Tonal instructor. It was a great read and I appreciated it. It’s something that I can use daily. Thank you so much.\n\nThanks, everybody. If you haven’t read the book yet, chapter 3 and chapter 4 are more dense philosophy. It’s the thing you might want to sit with for a while. I recommend getting through 3 and 4. Get to 5 because chapter 5 gets back into the daily, the quotidian, how to navigate when you’re angry when something bad happens, and when something good happens.\n\nThe last thing is if you don’t already take my class on Peloton, please do. If you don’t like my class, I have a wonderful team, Aditi, Kristin, Anna, Mariana, Kira, Chelsea, Nico, and there’s this other guy. I don’t know his name, but he doesn’t matter. This is one of my favorite last stories that I’ll leave you with. I was leaving. I was in the airport and this woman came up to me and said, “You’re Ross Rayburn from Peloton.” I’m like, “I am.” She’s like, “I love Denis’s yoga classes.” I was like, “Me too.” Please let people know if you like the book. Any love you can give on social media, This is the book that will build momentum the more people read it. Thank you for all of this. Much love.\n\nThank you.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nI guess that brings this episode to a close. Until next time, where can people find you?\n\nPeople can find me on Facebook at Facebook.com/crystaldokeefe.
