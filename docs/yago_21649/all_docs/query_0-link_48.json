Alfred Hitchcock, UK, 1927) (Screening format – not known, 91 mins ) In The Lodger, a serial killer known as “The Avenger” is on the loose in London, murdering blonde women. A mysterious man (Ivor Novello) arrives at the house of Mr. and Mrs. Bunting looking for a room to rent. The Bunting’s daughter (June Tripp) is a blonde model and is seeing one of the detectives (Malcolm Keen) assigned to the case. The detective becomes jealous of the lodger and begins to suspect he may be the #avenger. Based on a best-selling novel by Marie Belloc Lowndes, first published in 1913, loosely based on the Jack the Ripper murders, The Lodger was Hitchcock’s first thriller, and his first critical and commercial success. Made shortly after his return from Germany, the film betrays the influence of the German expressionist tradition established in such films as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919) and Nosferatu (1922).

Erich von Stroheim, US, 1919) (Screening format – not known, 99mins) In Erich von Stroheim’s directorial debut an Austrian officer sets out to seduce a neglected young wife. In suggesting that a woman had the right to seek love outside of an unsatisfying marriage, the film presents quite an advanced moral viewpoint for its time and the film is now considered a masterpiece of the silent era. Born in 1885 into a Jewish family of hat-makers in Vienna, Stroheim emigrated to the USA in 1909 where became one of the greatest Austrian film directors of the silent era. His reputation for extravagance, insistence on complete artistic freedom regardless of economic considerations, and his uncompromising and sophisticated treatment of controversial subject matters ended his career as a Hollywood director in the late 1920s.

Somerset Maugham’s 1913 Broadway play The Land of Promise, The Canadian was produced by Famous Players-Lasky and directed by William Beaudine. Its star, Thomas Meighan, had previously appeared in a 1917 adaptation (retaining the play’s original title) with Billie Burke as his leading lady. In this remake she is replaced by Mona Palmer, as a refined Englishwoman who finds it expedient to enter into marriage with an unsophisticated wheat farmer in Alberta, Canada.

Vladimir Strizhevsky, Ger, 1929) (Screening format – DCP, 98mins) Half screwball, half melodrama, this vehicle for one of the silent era’s greatest romantic leads, Ivan Mozzhukhin, makes full use of those soulful, penetrating eyes. This little-known film tells of a lighter-than-air romance between a Czarist officer and a passport-less girl who are obliged to share a sleeper compartment on an overnight train. Their burgeoning relationship is tested when revolutionary zeal meets implacable loyalty in the heightened atmosphere of pre-revolutionary Russia. Find out more at wikipedia.org .

This talk will begin with a description of the original production and the technology used to make the film. The film’s own troubled history complicated the film’s physical reconstruction, and that impacted the digital restoration. This talk will primarily explore the complex and subjective issues currently floating around in many analog-versus-digital discussions of film and how those opinions can influence the determination of what the restored version should look like if the goal is to replicate the original projected image at the time of first release. Can digital restorations generate valid preservation copies of photo-chemical materials? Presented by The Miskatonic Institute Of Horror Studies. Introduced by Mark Rance.

Georges Melies, Fr, 1902), (Screening format – not known, 48/13 mins). The daily activities and extraordinary events in the seaside town of Brighton are evocatively captured in modern silent Brighton: Symphony Of A City, wittily echoing the silent classic, Berlin Symphony of a City (1927). All-weather bathers plunge into winter seas at sunrise. Residents work, commute, flirt and play and do surprising things in their offices. Homelessness and gentrification collide; we glimpse forgotten attractions in sparkling amateur movies from Screen Archive South East. ‘Father Neptune’ is dunked in a raucous ritual from 1951; 1930s marchers celebrate the anniversary of the Soviet Union and modern protestors commemorate Gaza. The elegant ferris wheel, a contemporary icon destined for destruction, marks the passage of time. The day culminates in night-time revelry, astounding puppetry and the winter solstice festival, ‘The Burning of the Clocks’. A kaleidoscopic view of this unique seaside town, which evokes the past in the present and the extraordinary in the everyday. Brighton Symphony of a City was a Brighton Festival Commission for its 50th anniversary in 2016 where it premiered with a live performance of the score by the Orchestra of Sound and Light.

Originally, von Stroheim intended the film to run anywhere between 6 and 10 hours, and be shown over two evenings, but Universal executives opposed this idea.
