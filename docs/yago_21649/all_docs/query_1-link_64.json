Joel and Ethan Coen were again nominated as Best Director for True Grit (2010).\n\nWarren Beatty and Buck Henry for Heaven Can Wait (1978)\n\nDaniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (known as the two 'Daniels') for Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) - (win)\n\nThe Director with the Most Film Nominations in a Single Year:\n\nDirector W.S. (Woody) Van Dyke holds the single-year record for the most films to receive Oscar nominations (7):\n\nVan Dyke directed The Thin Man (1934) that had four nominations (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Adaptation)\n\nVan Dyke directed Manhattan Melodrama (1934) that won Best Original Story\n\nVan Dyke directed Hide-out (1934) that was nominated for Best Original Story\n\nVan Dyke directed Eskimo (1934) that won Best Film Editing\n\nThe Director with the Most Oscar Wins For Films in the Same Year:\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg holds the record for the most Oscars wins for multiple films in the same year:\n\nJurassic Park (1993) - with 3 nominations (and 3 wins)\n\nSchindler's List (1993) - with 12 nominations (and 7 wins)\n\nAfrican-American (Black) Best Director Nominees/Winners:\n\nNo African-American (or black) has ever won Best Director.\n\nAfrican-Americans (or blacks) nominated as Best Director include only six individuals:\n\nJohn Singleton for Boyz N the Hood (1991) - the first African-American to earn a Best Director nomination\n\nLee Daniels for Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire (2009) - the second African-American nominated director; it was the first-ever Best Picture nominee to be directed by an African-American filmmaker\n\nBritish director Steve McQueen for Best Picture-winning 12 Years a Slave (2013) [Note: If McQueen had won Best Director, he would have been the first black filmmaker to win that honor] - while the film won Best Picture (and McQueen earned a statuette as a producer), he lost the directing Oscar\n\nBarry Jenkins for Moonlight (2016) - co-producers Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, and Adele Romanski were accorded the Best Picture win, but Jenkins lost Best Director to Damien Chazelle for La La Land (2016)\n\nactor turned film-maker Jordan Peele for Best Picture-nominated Get Out (2017) - his solo directorial debut film; Peele also received a second nomination (and Oscar win) for Best Original Screenplay - and became the first African-American to earn such an Oscar. He was also honored as the producer of the Best Picture nominee; therefore, he became the first black filmmaker (and the third filmmaker of all time, after Warren Beatty and James L. Brooks) ever nominated for directing, writing, and producing in the same year for a debut feature film\n\nSpike Lee for BlacKkKlansman (2018)\n\n[Note: Lee had been previously nominated for Best Original Screenplay (Do the Right Thing (1989), and Best Documentary Feature (4 Little Girls (1997). He won his first Oscar, Best Adapted Screenplay for BlacKkKlansman (2018).]\n\nFemale Directors: Three Winners - and the Only Ones Nominated\n\nThree Female Director Winners:\n\nKathryn Bigelow for Best Picture-winning The Hurt Locker (2009)\n\nChloe Zhao for Best Picture-winning Nomadland (2020)\n\nJane Campion for Best Picture-nominated The Power of the Dog (2021)\n\nThere have only been nine female Best Director nominees (although it should be noted that Jane Campion was the first woman to be nominated more than once for Best Director):\n\nItalian film director Lina Wertmuller for Seven Beauties (1976, It.) - the first woman to be nominated for Best Director\n\nNew Zealander Jane Campion for Best Picture-nominated The Piano (1993) - her second Best Director nomination\n\nAmerican Sofia Coppola for her Best Picture-nominated Lost in Translation (2003) - the first American woman nominated for Best Director and only the third woman ever to be nominated for Best Director\n\nAmerican Kathryn Bigelow for her Best Picture-nominated The Hurt Locker (2009) - the second American woman nominated as Best Director and only the fourth woman nominated in the category\n\nAmerican Greta Gerwig for her Best Picture-nominated Lady Bird (2017) - the third American woman nominated as Best Director and only the fifth woman nominated in the category. In fact, she was also the first woman to be nominated as Best Director for her solo directorial debut\n\nChinese director Chloe Zhao for her Best Picture-nominated Nomadland (2020) - she was the first woman of Asian descent (and the first \"woman of color\") to be nominated and the first female Asian to win in the category. She also became the first woman to ever receive four Oscar nominations in a single year, and just the 9th person to ever earn that much recognition in a single ceremony.\n\nBritish director Emerald Fennell for Best Picture-nominated Promising Young Woman (2020) - she shared honors in 2020 with Chloe Zhao, when it marked the first time that more than one woman was nominated for the directors' prize in the awards' 93-year history. She also became the second woman to be nominated as Best Director for her solo directorial debut, after Greta Gerwig (above).\n\nJane Campion received her second Best Director nomination for Best Picture-nominated The Power of the Dog (2021). It was the first female-directed film to receive more than 10 nominations. With Campion's Best Director nomination, she became the oldest woman ever nominated in this category at age 67.\n\n45 year-old French director Justine Triet was nominated for the Best Picture-nominated Anatomy of a Fall (2023, Fr.)\n\nA number of films directed by women have been nominated for Best Picture (without a corresponding Best Director nomination), including:\n\nRanda Haines' Children of a Lesser God (1986)\n\nPenny Marshall's Awakenings (1990)\n\nBarbra Streisand's The Prince of Tides (1991)\n\nValerie Faris' (with Jonathan Dayton) Little Miss Sunshine (2006)\n\nLone Scherfig's An Education (2009)\n\nLisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right (2010)\n\nDebra Granik's Winter's Bone (2010)\n\nGreta Gerwig's Little Women (2019)\n\nSarah Polley's Women Talking (2022)\n\nGreta Gerwig's Barbie (2023)\n\nThere are only three films in Oscar history solely written, directed and produced by women, that received a Best Picture nomination:\n\nThe Piano (1993, NZ), d. Jane Campion\n\nWinter's Bone (2010), d. Debra Granik\n\nLittle Women (2019), d. Greta Gerwig\n\nForeign-Born Best Director Nominees and Winners:\n\nNote: A sampling of the most significant foreign-born directors (that have been nominated or won) are included here (there are many others from the UK or Central/Western Europe - see below): Bong Joon Ho (South Korea), Chloe Zhao (China), Pedro Almodóvar (Spain), Roberto Benigni (Italy), Ingmar Bergman (Sweden), Bernardo Bertolucci (Italy), Federico Fellini (Italy), Costa-Gavras (Greece), Michael Curtiz (Austria-Hungary), Miloš Forman (Czech.), Yorgos Lanthimos (Greece), Lewis Milestone (Russia), Mike Nichols (Germany), Wolfgang Petersen (Germany), Pawel Pawlikowski (Poland), Billy Wilder (Austria-Hungary/Poland), William Wyler (Germany), Fred Zinnemann (Austria-Hungary).\n\nRyûsuke Hamaguchi was the third Japanese director to be Oscar-nominated for Best Director (Drive My Car (2021)), following Hiroshi Teshigahara (Woman in the Dunes (1964), with a win for Best Foreign Language Film) and Akira Kurosawa (Ran (1985)).\n\nThere are numerous UK-born (includes NZ, and CAN) and French-born (FR) directors that have been nominated or have won: Michel Hazanavicius (FR), Tom Hooper, Kenneth Branagh, Danny Boyle, Peter Jackson (NZ), Roman Polanski (FR, but considered himself Polish), Sam Mendes, James Cameron (CAN), Anthony Minghella, Richard Attenborough, François Truffaut (FR), Jonathan Glazer, Christopher Nolan, to name just a few. Danish director Thomas Vinterberg was nominated for Another Round (2020), and Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos was nominated for Poor Things (2023).\n\nAng Lee was the first Asian (or non-white) filmmaker to win Hollywood's main filmmaking honor for Brokeback Mountain (2005). He also won Best Director for Life of Pi (2012). He was also nominated as Best Director for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000). Other Asian Best Director nominees include Hiroshi Teshigahara for Woman in the Dunes (1964), Akira Kurosawa for Ran (1985), and M. Night Shyamalan for The Sixth Sense (1999). It was a remarkable achievement that South Korea's Parasite (2019) won Best International Feature Film, Best Picture, and Best Director for Bong Joon Ho. He was only the second Asian director ever to win a directing Oscar, following two-time champ Ang Lee. For Nomadland (2020), Chloe Zhao became the third Asian person to win Best Director, after Ang Lee's two wins for Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Life of Pi (2012), and Bong Joon-ho's win for Parasite (2019).\n\nThe first time (in the awards' 93 year history) that more than one woman was nominated for Best Director in the same year occurred in 2020: British director Emerald Fennell for Promising Young Woman (2020) and Chinese director Chloe Zhao for Nomadland (2020). Zhao became the first woman of Asian descent (and the first \"woman of color\") to be nominated and to win for Best Director. Zhao also became the third Asian person to win Best Director, after Ang Lee's two wins for Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Life of Pi (2012), and Bong Joon-ho's win for Parasite (2019).\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, Mexican film-makers have won Oscars for Best Director in five of the six years:\n\nAlfonso Cuaron, Roma (2018)\n\nGuillermo del Toro, The Shape of Water (2017) - Del Toro became the third Mexican-born filmmaker to win the award\n\nAlejandro Inarritu, The Revenant (2015)\n\nAlejandro Inarritu, Birdman (2014)\n\nAlfonso Cuaron, Gravity (2013)\n\nAnd the consecutive string of non-Americans (6) winning Best Director stretched from 2010 to 2015:\n\nAlejandro Inarritu, The Revenant (2015)\n\nAlejandro Inarritu, Birdman (2014)\n\nAlfonso Cuaron, Gravity (2013)\n\nAng Lee (Taiwanese-born), Life of Pi (2012)\n\nMichel Hazanavicius (Fr.), The Artist (2011)\n\nTom Hooper (UK), The King's Speech (2010)\n\nMexican film-maker Guillermo del Toro won his first Best Director Oscar for the Best Picture-winning The Shape of Water (2017), with a whopping 13 nominations. [Note: This was del Toro's first nomination and win in the category, although he had a number of previous nominations in other categories. For The Shape of Water, he also won the Best Picture Oscar as co-producer, and had been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. He had previously been nominated twice for another fantasy film, Pan's Labyrinth (2006), for Best Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Language film.]\n\nMexican film-maker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu also won his first Best Director Oscar for the Best Picture-winning Birdman (2014), and won Best Original Screenplay for the same film. [Note: Inarritu had three previous Oscar nominations: Best Foreign Language Film Amores Perros (2000, Mex.), and Best Director/ Best Picture for Babel (2006).] The next year, he also won Best Director for Best Picture-nominated The Revenant (2015). He became the first person in 65 years and only the third ever to win back-to-back Best Director Oscars since Joseph L. Mankiewicz's A Letter To Three Wives (1949) and All About Eve (1950), and only the third in history, also after John Ford's The Grapes Of Wrath (1940) and How Green Was My Valley (1941).\n\nMexican film director Alfonso Cuarón was nominated for the first time as Best Director in 2013 and won the Oscar for Gravity (2013). He was the first Mexican-born director to win Best Director. He also received a Best Director Oscar for Roma (2018, Mex./US), voted the Best Foreign Language Film. With his Best Director win for Roma (2018), Cuarón became the first person to win Best Director for directing a foreign-language film. In fact, Cuaron received a total of four individual nominations (with two wins): Best Original Screenplay, Best Director (win), Best Cinematography (win), and Best Picture for Roma (2018) - thereby tying the record of most decorated Oscar nominee ever, with previous nominees Orson Welles (for Citizen Kane (1941)) and Warren Beatty (twice for Reds (1981) and Heaven Can Wait (1978).\n\nIn 2012, German-born directorial nominee Michael Haneke was nominated as Best Director for Amour (2012, Austria). Frenchman Michel Hazanavicius won for The Artist (2011).\n\nIn 2006, Alejandro González Iñárritu was the first Mexican director nominated for the top prize for Babel (2006). French film director Michel Hazanavicius was nominated for The Artist (2011). In the year 2006, the Mexican directing troika of Alejandro González Iñárritu, Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuaron took a combined 16 nominations for their films Babel (2006) (with seven nominations), Pan's Labyrinth (2006) (with six nominations) and Children of Men (2006) (with three nominations), respectively.\n\nFor the 2004 awards, Brazilian-born Fernando Meirelles was nominated as Best Director for City of God (2002) (aka Cidade de Deus).\n\nThe first Canadian to win Best Director was James Cameron, for Titanic (1997).\n\nIn 1987, all five of the Best Director nominees were foreign-born:\n\nBernardo Bertolucci (Italy) - the winner\n\nLasse Hallstrom (Sweden)\n\nNorman Jewison (Canada)\n\nAdrian Lyne (British)\n\nJohn Boorman (British)\n\nMatching Best Picture and Best Director Nominees:\n\nUp until recently, it was very rare for all the Best Picture nominees and Best Director nominees to directly correspond. It only happened five times in Oscar history when there were only 5 nominees for both Best Picture and Best Director. As of 2009, when the Best Picture list was expanded to 10 nominees, it wasn't as remarkable an occurrence:\n\n1957\n\n1964\n\n1981\n\n2005\n\n2008\n\n2009 - the first year with 10 Best Picture nominees\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2019\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nBest Director and Best Picture Correlations:\n\nThere is a direct correlation between the Best Picture and Director awards. Usually, the film voted Best Picture has been directed by the person named (or at least nominated) as Best Director. In a number of cases, however, the Best Picture win went to one film and Best Director went to another even though the helmer of the big winner was nominated.\n\nOf the 96 films (through the year 2023) that have been awarded Best Picture, 68 have also been awarded Best Director. About a quarter of the time, however, in Academy history, the Best Picture and Best Director winners have been for different films.\n\nThe Oscars (through the year 2023) have split Best Picture and Best Director 27 times: see years 2021, 2018, 2016, 2015, 2013, 2012, 2005, 2002, 2000, 1998, 1989, 1981, 1972, 1967, 1956, 1952, 1951, 1949, 1948, 1940, 1937, 1936, 1935, 1931/32, 1930/31, 1928/29, 1927/28 (two Best Director co-winners didn't win Best Picture).\n\nIn the first ten years of Oscar awards, seven of the first 10 Best Picture winners didn't include any honor for the directors beyond a nomination. [The exceptions were in the years 1929/30, 1932/33, and 1934, when the Academy honored the director as Best Director for a corresponding Best Picture.]\n\nHere are some examples in more recent years (from 1967 onwards):\n\n1967: director Norman Jewison's In the Heat of the Night (1967) won Best Picture, but Mike Nichols won Best Director for The Graduate (1967)\n\n1972: Francis Ford Coppola's multi-award winning The Godfather (1972) took Best Picture, while Bob Fosse won Best Director for Cabaret (1972) (Cabaret won eight Academy Awards  a record for the most Oscars won by a movie that didn't win Best Picture)\n\n1981: director Hugh Hudson's Chariots of Fire (1981) won Best Picture, but Warren Beatty won Best Director for Reds (1981)\n\n1989: director Bruce Beresford's Driving Miss Daisy (1989) won Best Picture, while Oliver Stone won Best Director for Born on the Fourth of July (1989)\n\n1998: director John Madden's Shakespeare in Love (1998) won Best Picture, but Steven Spielberg won Best Director for Saving Private Ryan (1998)\n\n2000: director Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) won Best Picture, but Steven Soderbergh won Best Director for Traffic (2000)\n\n2002: director Rob Marshall's Chicago (2002) won Best Picture, but Roman Polanski won Best Director for The Pianist (2002)\n\n2005: director Paul Haggis' Crash (2005) won Best Picture, but Ang Lee won Best Director for Brokeback Mountain (2005)\n\n2012: un-nominated director Ben Affleck's Argo (2012) won Best Picture, but Ang Lee won Best Director for Life of Pi (2012)\n\n2013: director Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave (2013) won Best Picture, but Alfonso Cuaron won Best Director for Gravity (2013)\n\n2015: director Tom McCarthy's Spotlight (2015) won Best Picture, but Alejandro Iñárritu won Best Director for The Revenant (2015)\n\n2016: director Barry Jenkins' Moonlight (2016) won Best Picture, but Damien Chazelle won Best Director for La La Land (2016)\n\n2018: director Peter Farrelly's Green Book (2018) won Best Picture, but Alfonso Cuaron won Best Director for Roma (2018)\n\nIt has often happened that a Best Director winner is not also honored with a simultaneous Best Picture win, especially in regards to John Ford and George Stevens. John Ford won Best Director three times even though his film lost the big prize, and George Stevens had the same shock twice:\n\n1935: John Ford won Best Director for The Informer (1935), while director Frank Lloyd's Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) won Best Picture\n\n1940: John Ford won Best Director for The Grapes of Wrath (1940), while director Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940) won Best Picture\n\n1952: John Ford won Best Director for The Quiet Man (1952), while director Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth (1952) won Best Picture\n\n1951: George Stevens won Best Director for A Place in the Sun (1951), while director Vincente Minnelli's An American in Paris (1951) won Best Picture\n\n1956: George Stevens won Best Director for Giant (1956), while director Michael Anderson Sr.'s Around the World in 80 Days (1956) won Best Picture\n\nThe Only Best Picture-Winning Films Without Best Director Nominations:\n\nIt is very rare for a film to win the Best Picture Oscar while omitting the film's director from the Best Director nominations - this has happened only six times:\n\n1927/28: Wings (1927/28), the Best Picture winner, was directed by un-nominated William Wellman, while the Best Director award went to Frank Borzage for Seventh Heaven (1927/28)\n\n1931/32: Grand Hotel (1931/32), the Best Picture winner, was directed by un-nominated Edmund Goulding, while the Best Director award went to Frank Borzage for Bad Girl (1931/32)\n\n1989: Driving Miss Daisy (1989), the Best Picture winner, was directed by un-nominated Bruce Beresford, while the Best Director award went to Oliver Stone for Born on the Fourth of July (1989)\n\n2012: Argo (2012), the Best Picture winner, was directed by un-nominated Ben Affleck, while the Best Director award went to Ang Lee for Life of Pi (2012)\n\n2018: Green Book (2018), the Best Picture winner, was directed by un-nominated Peter Farrelly, while the Best Director award went to Alfonso Cuarón for Roma (2018, Mex.)\n\n2021: CODA (2021), the Best Picture winner, was directed by un-nominated Sian Heder, while the Best Director Oscar went to Jane Campion for The Power of the Dog (2021)\n\nThe Only Films to Win Best Director Without a Best Picture Nomination:\n\nTwo Arabian Knights (1927/28), not nominated for Best Picture, but Lewis Milestone won Best Director (Comedy)\n\nThe Divine Lady (1928/29), not nominated for Best Picture, but Frank Lloyd won Best Director\n\nThe Most Best Picture Nominations: William Wyler - the Winning-est Best Picture Director\n\nUp until 2015, William Wyler held the record for the most nominations and wins for his films in all categories: 127 nominations and 39 awards. Half of the nominations he received were in the major categories of Best Picture, Acting, and Directing. With his Best Picture nomination for Bridge of Spies (2015), Spielberg's films had now earned 128 nominations, the most of any director of all time, passing up William Wyler (127).\n\nWilliam Wyler holds the record for directing more Best Picture nominees (13) and more Best Picture winners (3) than anyone else. His 13 Best Picture-nominated and winning films (marked with *) were:\n\nDodsworth (1936)\n\nDead End (1937)\n\nJezebel (1938)\n\nWuthering Heights (1939)\n\nThe Letter (1940)\n\nThe Little Foxes (1941)\n\nMrs. Miniver (1942)*\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives (1946)*\n\nThe Heiress (1949)\n\nRoman Holiday (1953)\n\nFriendly Persuasion (1956)\n\nBen-Hur (1959)*\n\nFunny Girl (1968)\n\nWyler also has 12 Best Director nominations, and 3 awards.
