        "text": "Directed by King Vidor.\n\nScreenplay by Dorothy Farnum, from the identically titled novel by Rafael Sabatini. Titles by Marian Ainslee and Ruth Cummings.\n\nSilent.\n\nThis, my dears, is a Film of Magic – one that, by all accounts, we should not have and be able to watch today – and YET! – somehow it exists, available for our viewing now, in the year 2024. For seventy years (from 1936, when MGM’s 10-year contract with Sabatini for the rights to his novel expired and was not renewed (because, ew, who needs art made by Silent Dinosaurs [insert fit of inconsolable sobbing here]), and all prints of the film were destroyed by order of the studio as a result – to 2006, when a (missing-one-reel) print was found in someone’s private collection in France), the film was considered lost, and seen by no one (except, perchance, by that one Hero Frenchling).\n\nOf course, the loss and rediscovery of the film is made even more enchanting by the fact that – for those seventy years – the only extant footage from it was thought to be the (all-too-brief) snippets that play during the film-screening sequence attended by Marion Davies’s character in SHOW PEOPLE (1928). For seven decades – that’s all Movie People believed the world would ever, ever see.\n\nFor any film to be rescued from Lostville is both a victory and a miracle – but for this specific film to be found alive deserves classification as something legendarily, weep-worthily more important than that. This film is the final collaboration of King Vidor and John Gilbert (whose most famous collaboration – THE BIG PARADE (1925) – also featured Karl Dane, who briefly appears in this one, as well); it’s the film that was released directly prior to Vidor and star Eleanor Boardman’s Real-Life wedding; the film contains a Repeat Rivalry Re-Teaming of Gilbert and Roy D’Arcy (who’d starred together in Erich Von Stroheim’s THE MERRY WIDOW (1925) the previous year); it was shot by master cinematographer William Daniels. Also – a fact which is somewhat peculiar, as we all know that the rights to it have been available – the film stands as the only-ever screen adaptation of this particular work of Sabatini’s.\n\nSo: please, let us all take a minute to say a weepy, grateful-ass prayer of thanks to the MovieWorld Angels (and that one gorgeous Frenchling) for gifting us this treasure.\n\nOpening title card:\n\n“In an age of light loves and lively scandals, a certain gentleman of France excelled in the noble art of getting himself talked about – – “\n\nOh, oh! I know this one:\n\n(Shit, he was Spanish.)\n\n…The Beloved Rogue?!\n\nJust kidding, pals. This Romance Man is called Bardelys, and he *happens* to be Magnificent.\n\nRepeated line, to Bardelys (full name: Marquis Christian de Bardelys)(John Gilbert)’s many ladies:\n\n“Dark enchantress, can you doubt me?”\n\nWhile Bardelys is distributing proof-of-love, wig-hair lockets, fellow-bachelor court acquaintance Comte de Chatellerault (a refreshingly un-monocled Roy D’Arcy) is having his marriage proposal(s) rejected by beautiful, self-possessed truth-teller Roxalanne de Lavedan (Eleanor Boardman). Everyone at court makes fun of Chatellerault’s ineptitude except Bardelys the Decent Niceling, who is like, ‘Don’t worry, my dude – you’ll probably get the next one.’\n\nHe also advises: “You don’t know women! The less one begs of them – the more one can take. I never beg!”\n\nAnd like…yeah. Brother Magnificent has a point. Romantic begging is decidedly uncool.\n\nThe Comte de Rejection, annoyed by Studly Romance Man’s easy confidence, is like, ‘Clearly you’ve never met Roxalanne.’\n\n“Braggart,” the Comte says to Bardelys, “I’ll wager everything I own – – that you cannot win her for your wife!”\n\nMonsieur Magnificent’s response?\n\n“I can win any woman I want for my wife – – but, Mon Dieu, I don’t want a wife!”\n\n(Goddamn it, I love this cat’s style.)\n\nThe Comte de Rejection’s beautifully flourishy penmanship proves to be too fabulous for Bardelys to walk away from – and he decides to accept the Comte’s Roxalanne Challenge™.\n\nWhen the King (Louis XIII, played by Arthur Lubin) hears about the bet, he’s like, ‘Y’all, that’s dumb as shit. I’d much rather go into Lavedansville and cut them all down with swords.’\n\nBardelys is like, ‘…All the same, Chief – I’m currently really feeling the urge to go prove my manhood to everyone, as well as win myself all of Chatellerault’s worldly possessions, so I’mma sneak out and try this anyway.’\n\nKing’s like, ‘No, I forbid it. You must not go!!!’\n\nBardelys (imaginedly, in my head, fade-dropping off the side of the screen): ‘Tooooooo bad.’\n\n[Here, we encounter the film’s missing reel – in which Bardelys sets out on his Rebel Quest for Roxalanne Lavedan and is thusly branded a “traitor” by the disapproving King, who sends some teams of soldier-knights after Bardelys the Magnificent(ly Disloyal Turncoat) to capture and/or kill him. (Wow, how cute – and totally not an over-the-top reaction at all!) Anyhow, along the way – before he gets stab-wounded by one of these soldier-knights and stumbles into Roxalanne’s Castle Room in need of a hiding spot and medical attention – Bardelys finds a dying man in a barn named René de Lesperon (Theodore von Eltz) and is like, ‘Swell, maybe I can use his identity later.’]\n\nRoxalanne helps wounded Bardelys (the Lavedans are not fans of the King – so the fact that Bardelys is being so fiercely chased by the soldier-knights actually works in his favor) – but when he insists on kissing her goodbye, Roxalanne decides she hates him, because, hello – rude.\n\nDespite Roxalanne the Hater’s protests, Mama and Papa de Lavedan (aka: the Vicomtesse and Vicomte de Lavedan, played by Emily Fitzroy and Lionel Belmore, respectively) are happy to host the Newly Present Stranger, since, as Papa Vicomte explains to Bardelys, “Your letters told me that you are de Lesperon, leader of our revolt against the King.”\n\n‘Uhhhhhh…’ says Bardelys in reply.\n\nSoon after, Bardelys’s Bardelys-less entourage arrives at the Castle Mansion and is like, ‘Announcement – our dude is coming, get excited and give us the best of everything!’ The Lavedans are like, ‘Ugh, gross, no – we hate that guy, he’s such a fucking King-Pal!’\n\nPapa Lavedan is like, ‘Badass Rebel René, what do you think we should do with these twerps?’\n\n‘Oh, that’s easy,’ says Badass Rebel “René.” “Throw them out!”\n\n(The entertained, joyful disbelief with which Gilbert delivers this instruction is beautifully funny, and tonally spot-on.)\n\nOver the course of several months – and several romantic boat-rowings through the willow trees – Bardelys/René gets himself into a fine mess, as he and Roxalanne fall in love with each other. Sure, sure, yay-hooray for love and all that romance-jazz, however – Problem #A, girlfriend doesn’t know who he is, Problem #B, his Marriage Bet is a ticking time-bomb, and finally, Problem #C, Nosy Neighbor Eustache (George K. Arthur) – a true goofster fluffpants if ever there was one – is hot on the ‘John Gilbert, you are not René de Lesperon’ trail, popping up from Meddlesville, seemingly on the daily, with some new intel, such as ‘I hear René is dead’ and ‘Or, if he’s not dead, he defs has a jilted fiancée named Lisette whose letters I have intercepted’/’P.S. – Please don’t arrest me for Mail Tampering even though that’s certainly illegal’/’P.P.S. – Please also don’t disarm me with your fancy walking stick again, that was as embarrassing as fuck.’\n\nUpset by the latest Lisette Intel, Roxalanne the Lied-To (several times over, she just doesn’t know it yet)(damn, woman – your instincts are good) turns “René” the Hunted over to the latest visiting Gang o’ King’s Soldier-Knights…and Sadling Guiltster Bardelys goes without a fuss.\n\nJesus Christ – once a Monocle-Man Evil, always a Monocle-Man Evil (even if there are no actual monocles, this time around). At “René’s” treason trial, Bardelys is like, ‘Boy, Chatellerault – am I glad to see you! Tell ’em who I am, brother!’\n\nThe (apparently now murderous) Comte de Rotten Egg is like, ‘You are 1000% René de Lesperon and you’re 1000% gonna die for it via hanging tomorrow. Cheerio!’\n\nRoy D’Arcy really has it out for our boy lately, doesn’t he? (So.…..at what point does the hobo sniper appear in this one???)\n\n“I don’t care who you are – – what you have done – – I love you – – forever,” says a desperately regretful, passionately apologetic Roxalanne, who visits Bardelys the Condemned in his Death Cell.\n\n‘Well,’ we shufflingly whisper, ‘that’s an awfully convenient statement for you to make, ’cause see…there was this bet, and then there was this Barn Dude……’\n\n“Good-bye, my dearest,” Roxalanne tearfully says to Bardelys at their Ultimate Parting. “Good-bye – – I pray God to let me join you – – soon.”\n\nOh, Roxalanne – don’t be such a Ray Schmidt. Pull yourself together, sailor!\n\nI gotta be honest – as stellarly as Gilbert and Boardman perform the emotional grabbery of the Farewell Scene, the line of cloaked-‘n’-hooded Hangman Dudes standing behind them in the cell, who, for some reason, are holding like…3-foot-long, lit candles, makes for an image that is silly as shit.\n\nHowever – I do appreciate Bardelys’s scene-concluding, rebound lines:\n\n“I am ready, my friends! Life has been a magnificent adventure – Death may be another!”\n\n(Pssst – if someone could remember to pass me a notecard featuring this statement on my death bed…that’d be swell. People would probably think I was The Coolest.)\n\n(…Or, there’s a chance that everyone would suddenly be convinced of my lamery – as having a notecard prepared on which a quote from a 1926-silent-movie character called Bardelys is written and/or typed might minus me some Style Points. Whatever, though.)\n\nOh, God – nooooo, Roxalanne – do not trade yourself to the Comte de No Conscience to save Beloved Bardelys! That dude is a shit-souled rotten who aims to (further) ruin your life!!!\n\nWhile the above distastefulness is occurring – Bardelys makes an impressively acrobatic escape from the gallows – a sequence which is fantastically choreographed and executed (no pun intended), and features some cool overhead photography from/by William Daniels.\n\nThanks to this escape-diversion, the King arrives in time to positively identify Bardelys and amusedly pardon him – which allows Bardelys to interrupt the Comte de Bad Intentions’s Sleaze Party with Roxalanne, and scribble (okay, so it’s a fine-ass scribble of calligraphied BEAUTY) a new contract that cedes all Bardelys’s property to Chatellerault, so that evil creep will LEAVE EVERYBODY THE FUCK ALONE.\n\n“Roxalanne,” says Bardelys, turning toward her, “for love of you I’d gladly give up an Empire! Will you become the Marquise de Bardelys?”\n\n‘Well, shit,’ says Roxalanne in response. ‘Unfortunately, I just lightning-married this scoundrel to save your (formerly) doomed ass, so…I’m not totally certain what to do, here, dear.’\n\nAnd this is how Monocle Man Mirko and Prince Danilo find themselves – once again – dueling over a bride (though this time, they’re fighting with swords and not pistols).\n\n“When I finish with the Comte Chatellerault, you will be a widow!” Bardelys shouts to Roxalanne amidst the mayhem.\n\n…On a scale of 1 to 10, Captain Magnificent, can you tell us exactly how – merry – you think she’ll be, once this occurs?\n\nThe small room swordfight is an exciting affair – and ends with Mirko Comte de KARMA WILL GET YOU falling on his own sword like an idiot stone-deadling.\n\nYay-hooray for Impalement!\n\n…Or……um…\n\nThree cheers for Happily Ever After endings where John Gilbert doesn’t get hanged for treason and also nabs him a hot widow!!!\n\n(…Just – go with it, man, and be grateful this film exists.)\n\nThis was a no-doubt fun time of a film, though there wasn’t anything earth-shatteringly wondrous about it…other than the fact that it, you know, is still alive and kicking.\n\nCertainly, the movie’s worth a watch, purely as an act of celebration for its glorious resurrection.\n\n…Or, depending on your mood, as a hearty ‘Fuck you!’ to MGM for attempting to destroy a piece of art that mattered in 1936 – and continues to matter now.\n\nLong live BARDELYS…\n\nTHE MAGNIFICENT.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
