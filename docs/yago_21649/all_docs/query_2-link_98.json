        "text": "The cast of “Hard Truths,” the 23rd film from legendary British director Mike Leigh, has been unveiled, along with a first look image.\n\nThe feature, which like most Leigh projects has remained under a veil of secrecy, has reunited the filmmaker with Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who received an Oscar nomination for his 1996 drama “Secrets & Lies.” Michele Austin, another frequent Leigh collaborator, also stars.\n\n“Hard Truths” was shot in London in 2023 and, following his historical epics “Mr. Turner” and “Peterloo,” sees Leigh return to the contemporary world. However, plot details are still scarce, the film’s only description being that it’s a “tough but compassionate intimate study of family life” (considerably more information than was available last year, when it was being sold at the European Film Market without its title, cast or plot having been announced).\n\nLeigh was joined behind the camera by his regular crew members, including producer Georgina Lowe, cinematographer Dick Pope, costume designer Jacqueline Durran (who recently earned her 9th Oscar nomination for her work on “Barbie”), production designer Suzie Davis, composer Gary Yershon and casting director Nina Gold. New to the Leigh team were editor Tania Reddin and make-up and hair designer Nora Robertson.\n\n“Hard Truths” is a Thin Man Films and The Mediapro Studio co-production, co-financed by Film4 in association with Creativity Media.\n\nBleecker Street will release the film theatrically in the U.S. later this year, with StudioCanal releasing in the U.K., and Cornerstone Films handling international sales.\n\nJean-Baptiste’s recent credits include “The Book of Clarence,” “Rumble Through the Dark” and “The Following Events Are Based on a Pack of Lies.”"
