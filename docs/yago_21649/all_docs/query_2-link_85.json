        "text": "I’ll come right out and say it: Julien Faraut’s John McEnroe: In the Realm of Perfection is the best tennis film ever made. Admittedly, the Venn diagram intersection of “tennis” and “film” and “genius” might require a magnifying glass to truly comprehend, so I’ll double down and say that Faraut’s film (which opens at New York’s Film Forum on Wednesday) is among the very best films on any sport that I’ve ever seen.\n\nIn an ideal scenario, you’d stop reading this story now and just go see the damn thing: Part of its exuberance, its surprise, and its delight rest in it confounding whatever expectations you may have of it. But as we live in an imperfect world, a few guideposts: A few years ago, Faraut—an audiovisual archivist at the National Institute of Sport in Paris—discovered can upon can of unused rushes filmed by the oddly obsessive Gil de Kermadec, France’s first national director of tennis, during the 1984 French Open. The tightly focused shots feature only a single player at a time—most notably McEnroe, then at the height of his powers—with the goal a sort of objective study of a player’s strokes. Upon these rushes Faraut, 39, deftly edits in philosophical and psychological ruminations (Mathieu Amalric provides the narration) and comparisons to everyone from Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull to Mozart in the Milos Forman’s film Amadeus (among the many fascinating things we learn in In the Realm of Perfection is that Tom Hulce’s inspiration for playing the young Mozart was, yes, John McEnroe). Crucially, given his subject, he lets McEnroe’s tantrums—usually rendered in quick soundbites—run at length, which has the effect of making them at once more understandable, more existentially vicious, and more uncomfortable for all parties concerned (not least of all the viewer).\n\nThe film—think of Godard doing a tennis documentary rather than last year’s middle-of-the-road Borg vs. McEnroe, and you’ll be on the right track—is stridently personal, idiosyncratic, and subjective. For me, the moment when I realized I wasn’t in Kansas anymore happened early on, just as a quiet, meditative instructional video gave way to McEnroe serving in 400-frames-per-second vividness rendered in super-slow-motion—as Sonic Youth’s blistering “The Sprawl” plays at eleven.\n\nWe sat down with Faraut and lobbed a few questions his way.\n\nWhat made you decide to make this film?\n\nThe real point of departure was when I first began to see Gil de Kermadec’s reels of 16mm film. They were filmed with real film cameras, and the point of view was so original in its ambiguity.\n\nHow did you find the footage?\n\nI’ve worked for the last 15 years for the National Institute of Sport, a governmental department under France’s ministry of sports. The institute dates back to the 19th century, and it’s a resource center for people interested in the history of sports. I’m responsible for providing access to those resources and for teaching courses on the history of sports. A friend there was doing a film about Gil de Kermadec, and we were looking through everything he had shot, and that’s when we discovered this unknown treasure of these rushes of John McEnroe, which were not labeled or identified—at all. This kind of material is very rare. Most of the time, it’s destroyed.\n\nAre you a tennis fan? A McEnroe fan? Or is was this just a kind of unicorn that you chased?\n\nI’m not a tennis player, and I’m a little bit too young to have been there for the 1985 match that you see, though tennis was part of my environment—my parents were interested in it. But there are a lot of sports films made by people without a lot of expertise in any sport. I do a lot of sports (though not tennis), and I think that gives me an advantage—I have a feel for what’s involved with sports on a really high level.\n\nAlso, people aren’t really aware of this, but the origin of sport as we know it and the origin of film are pretty much contemporaneous. Edison’s kinetoscope originally showed films of boxers boxing. The history of film is really the history of sports film.\n\nAs far as McEnroe is concerned, he’s really missed—we don’t have players with that kind of creativity, with almost this element of the fantastic to them, and we look back and we miss them. Today’s players are not like that.\n\nYou have something of a history of making films revolving around sports.\n\nYes. I saw the first feature film of Chris Marker, on the 1952 Olympics, which had never been shown, and I did a film on that. And I’ve done one on Bob Beamon and his performance at the 1968 Olympics, some on fencing, some on the 1924 Olympics. But although they all revolved around sports, I don’t see that as a restriction or a limitation. I find that you’re able to explore a particular time period and the trajectory that some of these athletes have within their sports—and there are fictional elements or entertainment elements that come into play. People often ask me, “Why are you always making films about sports?” To which I say, “Would you ask Woody Allen why he’s always making films about male-female relationships?”\n\nAre there conscious inspirations for this film, or did you essentially fly blind?\n\nThis is a really personal film, but I am, of course, a film fan. Looking at Chris Marker’s work made me want to make films and showed me that I could do it. His whole notion of collage—that he reuses still images, archival film footage, music. He combines them in new and different ways.\n\nThere’s also something less direct: This film is being distributed in the U.S. by Oscilloscope, which was founded by Adam Yauch, who was one of the Beastie Boys. And the Beastie Boys’s Paul’s Boutique was really important for me—they changed the history of hip-hop with that album and the way they used samples. That’s why, even though there’s a lot of rock music in this film, I think it’s more of a hip-hop film.\n\nAt one point, you cut between footage of McEnroe raging and Robert De Niro in Raging Bull.\n\nWhen you see McEnroe talking with the umpire, or the linesman, just physically and his attitude—it reminded me of De Niro. But as I worked on the film I realized that there was inherent in John McEnroe a certain ambiguity. He’s somebody who was very expressive, very naturally theatrical. And I think he was very much misunderstood. Looking at the rushes, I realized that very often at a very intense moment when he was visibly in distress, there would be people in the audience who were laughing. Basically, he was an emotional volcano—but I wanted to rehabilitate him to some extent. He really used his anger and intensity to disrupt the momentum, and when he did so, he gained control over the timing of the match—and the people he played against were not always capable of regaining their momentum. It’s true that he used that to his advantage, but the fact that it even occurred was something that he didn’t do deliberately. It was something that was inside of him—he didn’t provoke it, but it came out and burned him and almost consumed him. But he knew how to use it and turn it into a kind of positive energy.\n\nHas McEnroe seen the film?\n\nWe got a sort of one-line email from his agent that simply said, “He liked it.” Though honestly, I don’t know that he’d really be able to watch the footage from the final, given what he’s said about it in the past. [McEnroe has noted, quite recently, that he still can’t bear to watch or even think of his 1984 French Open final loss against Ivan Lendl, which Faraut’s film explores in detail.]"
