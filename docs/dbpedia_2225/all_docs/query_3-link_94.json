        "text": "Born to William and Mary Wagner, one of four children survived by sister Meridan W. Frost, Michael Wagner, and Thomas Wagner. He will be missed by his siblings. He and his siblings\n\nresided in Southern California for the majority of their youth.\n\nDuring his youth he participated in Cub Scouts, with his Father, William Arthur Wagner serving as Scout Master.\n\nSwimming lessons, climbing trees, bicycle riding and throwing rocks at anything that moved were some of his favorite activities as a child. And the all important watermelon eating in the summer, trying to see who could spit the seeds the farthest.\n\nHe attended Calahan Elementary School in Northridge, California; Nobel Junior High in Northridge, and Chatsworth High School briefly, in California before relocating to Utah where he attended Bonneville High School in South Ogden, Utah for his graduation.\n\nHe enlisted in the Navy after graduation, and served on a ship that traveled to Vietnam. After enlisting he married the love of his life, Vicki Lyn Veibell in l974. During his seven and a half years in the military he was stationed in San Diego, with his wife. He was also stationed at Whidbey Island for three years, during which time he served in the Military Service Honors for recently deceased compatriots. (He always cried after engaging in this most sacred duty.)\n\nHis son, Jeremy, and daughter, Amy, were born during the time he served in the military.\n\nHe also mentored his son during his quest to hold the designation of Eagle Scout, something he was very proud to do.\n\nHe worked for Boeing as a draftman, and for the TSA in airport screening. He had to take an early retirement due to his many health problems, but did his best to remain active to some degree with his Steelhead fishing, his passion. He earned the moniker, Mr. Steelhead.\n\nHe was honored to be highlighted in an episode of Fishing the West, where he enthusiastically described his techniques in catching that delight of the Pacific Northwest, the elusive Steelhead, an ocean going trout.\n\nHe was also very proud of earning an MBA later in life.\n\nWilliam Paul Wagner was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and was honored to hold the Priesthood, and served in the Temple.\n\nThe family wishes to thank Hawthorne Funeral Home and Memorial Park in Washington, and Myers Mortuary in Roy, Utah for their services. He will be laid to rest at the Cornish Cemetery, in Cornish, Utah on November 30,2021, to rest with his in laws, whom he dearly loved, Victor and Audrey Veibell.\n\nHe is survived by his widow, Vicki Wagner, son, Jeremy, and daughter, Amy. In addition, he is survived by various nieces and nephews, and his three siblings.\n\nThe family wishes to thank Fresenius Medical Care for their compassionate care; and Mira Vista Care Center for their efforts on his behalf.\n\nA celebration of life will be held in Mount Vernon, Washington after the holidays."
