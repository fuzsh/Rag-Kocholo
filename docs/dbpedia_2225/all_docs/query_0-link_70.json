        "text": "Winter 2001-2002\n\nSpring/Summer 2002\n\nAutumn/Winter 2002\n\nVolume 23, Number 4, Published by the Hyde Park Historical Society, WINTER 2001-2002\n\nMY SCHOOL DAYS IN HYDE PARK\n\nHPHS President Alice Schlessinger, formerly editor of LAB NOTES, U-High'sJournal, has suggested that Society members might be interested in the recollections of Pan/ H. Nitze, class of 1923, recollections he wrote for that journal in 1985.\n\nIn 1910 my father was asked by President Harper to join the faculty of the University of Chicago as head of the Department of Romance Languages and\n\nLiterature. We moved from Berkeley, California, to the Del Prado Hotel on 59th Street, on the lakeshore side of the Illinois Central Railroad tracks, in the fall of that year. I remember it as being a glorious place with high ceilings, sunny rooms, an enormous veranda with rocking chairs.\n\nI was three; I had a friend who was four and much more grown up. I admired him immensely. Emily Kimborough, in her book about growing up in Chicago, has an amusing description of us staying at the Del Prado Hotel—the Nitze family, their charming daughter Pussy, and their spoiled, objectionable brat of a son. I am sure she reports accurately. Pussy was in second grade in the elementary school while I was being a pest around the hotel. The next year we moved to a house on what was then Blackstone Avenue between 57 th and 58 th Streets.\n\nThat summer our mother took us to Fish Creek,\n\nWisconsin, to escape the heat of the Chicago summer. We drove up with the Guenzels, friends of my parents, in a glorious red Stanley Steamer. The roads north along Sturgeon Bay were merely two ruts with grass growing between them. Every ten miles or so the boiler would over-heat and blow the safety valve. Mr. Guenzel would have to climb under the car and insert a new one.\n\nFather stayed behind in the Blackstone Avenue house with a fellow member of his department, Clarence Parmenter, both of them having opted to teach for the summer quarter. Father could become so intent on what he was talking about that he could be absent-minded. Parmenter wrote Mother a letter describing Father pouring maple syrup on his head while he scratched the breakfast pancakes.\n\nThe year 1912 we spent in Europe, where Father was doing research on the Grail Romances. When we came back to Chicago, we moved to 1220 56 th Street, between Kimbark and Woodlawn.\n\nIn 1914 Father again took us all to Europe.\n\nWe were mountain climbing in Austria when the Arch-Duke was murdered in Sarayevo. Father became worried when Austria mobilized against Russia and decided to take us to a safe country,—Germany. We arrived in Munich on the morning Germany declared war on Russia and World War I began. We finally got back to the United States by a Holland-American liner during the battle of the Marne.\n\nIt was not until 1915 that I became a regular student at the Elementary School. My life there did not start off easily. My mother was ahead of her generation in many things. She smoked, loved to dance, entertained with gusto, had an enormous circle of friends, but she was also a romantic. She insisted on dressing me in short pants and jacket and a shirt with a Buster Brown collar and a flowing black tie tied in a bow.\n\nAt school, at ten o'clock every morning, we had a break for roughhousing and letting off steam. Every day one of my classmates, Percy Boynton, would say insulting things about my get-up. I felt obliged to hit him, whereupon he would beat me up. This went on for a time until I found a way to solve the problem: one night I took all my collars, tore them into pieces, -and threw them out my bedroom window into the alley. The next day I went down to breakfast without a collar. My mother asked me, \"why no collar?\" When I explained, her only comment was, \"I had no idea you felt so strongly about them.\"\n\nBut my problem was not restricted to my classmates. In order to get to the Elementary School, I had to pass Ray School , the public school between 56th and 5 7 t One afternoon, walking home from school, I stopped to watch some Ray School boys playing marbles. One of them stood up and asked me what I was looking at. When my answer was not to his satisfaction, he pushed me back over one of his friends who was kneeling behind me. Then they beat me up.\n\nI found out that my tormentors were members of the Musik brothers gang. They were the sons of a tailor down on 55 th and considered themselves bosses of the entire area bounded by Woodlawn and\n\nKimbark, 55 t and 56 th Streets. The neighboring block on the other side of Kimbark was dominated by the Scotti brothers gang. The eldest Scotti offered to defend me against the Musiks. I became an enthusiastic member of his gang. He was thin, almost emaciated, slightly red-haired; he was my first experience of charismatic leadership. He had a technique of binding the loyalty of members of his gang by getting them to become his partners in some outrageous act. One day he suggested that the workmen who were building some houses on the other side of 56th Street usually left their toolbox on the site overnight. He told me we could use those tools. That night, without a second thought, I lifted the tools and handed them over to him.\n\nThere was a third gang on the block between 57 th and 58 th run by the Colissimo brothers. On weekends we would sometimes have football games between the gangs on the Midway. One team or other would grossly cheat and the game would break up into a freefor-all fight. Years later, after I had gone east to school and college, but had come back to Chicago for a vacation, I asked about the Musiks, the Scotties and the Colissimos. They had been caught up in the more serious gang life of those days in Chicago and had been either killed of jailed. None of them were known to have survived as useful citizens.\n\nThe South Side of Chicago contained many different worlds. One was the University world inspired by President Harper, one of the great men of his day. In physics the stars were Michaelson, who lived on 58 th\n\nStreet. Professor Milliken lived across the street from us on 56th Glen Milliken was in the class ahead of me, but undertook to lead me into the world of science, its theory, its experiments and practice. West of us lived Professor Dixon, a Nobel Prize winning\n\nmathematician. One block to the East lived James Weber Lynn, one of the stars of the English department. James Breasted, the famous historian of Egypt and the ancient world, lived on Woodlawn. Others that I remember were Thorstein Veblen, the economist, Gordon Laing, the classicist, and Thomas, the sociologist. The University Medical School attracted a distinguished group of doctors, including Dr. Sippy who lived on Woodlawn. The Sippys were the only people we knew who had an autbmobile. In fact, they had two. Everyone else, to get downtown, would walk the eight blocks to the Illinois Central Station and take the train.\n\nThere was also a distinguished Jewish business community that lived around 47 th Street or even closer to town. They included the Rosenwalds, the Mandels, the Blocks, the Gidwitzes and the Feuchtwangers. One of the Feuchtwangers ended up as the distinguished moving picture director, Walter Wanger. There were newspaper people, artists and lawyers. Finally there were a number of not so distinguished people, but people who seemed to represent the real world, the Chicago of those days.\n\nThat real world was physically represented by the soot from the South Chicago steel mills and the odor of the stockyards which would blow at us whenever the wind\n\nwas from the west. The Ray School and Western High with its 4000 students, twenty-five percent of whom were black, seemed to me to be the real world of Chicago in those days. James Farrell's Studs Lonigan presents an accurate picture of that world.\n\nAthletics was, of course, very much a part of our lives. I played soccer, basketball and baseball, with vigor but no brilliance. The school organized a variety of activities to widen our experience. On various weekends we were taken to visit one of the steel mills, then one of the meat packing plants in the stockyards, then the Standard Oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana, then a paint factory and the factory where they assembled the Essex automobile, a brand long since abandoned.\n\nWe were members of a Boy Scout group doing our daily good deeds. We sold War Bonds in 1917. We acted out current events. We acted in plays, learned to cook, to set type, to use wood and metal lathes and other machine tools, and to knit. It was an advanced and experimental form of education. I guess it did most of us no harm and for many it opened up larger horizons. There were, however, gaps. I learned no American history and I never learned to spell, but that was undoubtedly my fault, not the school's. I just wasn't interested in spelling. For some, however, the school did not provide the proper discipline.\n\nIn my second year at U High, I found myself sitting at an adjoining desk to Dicky Loeb in a French course. Dicky was older and in the class ahead of us. He seemed to me to be charming but soft. During the final examination I noticed that he was cribbing from what I was writing.\n\nNevertheless I was shocked when it came out that he had joined Leopold in the infamous murder of the Frank boy.\n\nI have left out one important aspect of those years, the impact of World War I upon our emotions and our thoughts. The Nitze family is entirely of German ancestry. Until the war, I had spent about half of my life abroad, much of it in Germany. The people I had known in those pre-war years in Germany, and also in Italy and Austria, were warm, loving, and much more emotional and outgoing than my contemporaries in Chicago, particularly those who were not part of the University enclave. My family was firmly on the side of \"Keep America out of the War. In 1917, when the United States entered the war, we switched our views, but doubts remained. My classmates and I were asked to call at houses in our neighborhood and try to sell Liberty bonds. I was utterly surprised when a number of those I called on agreed to buy them. I sold $ 5000 worth of bonds which seemed to me to be an enormous amount.\n\nBut even at the age of ten and eleven the unutterable tragedy of the battle of the Somme, of the continuous struggle for Verdun and the mysterious battles on the Eastern front left a lasting impression.\n\nWhen President Wilson announced his Fourteen Points it seemed that a gleam of hope had appeared in a destructive and irrational world. When the armistice was announced our parents took us to a friend's office high up above Michigan Avenue from which we could watch the parade. But later when the surrender terms and the terms of the Versailles Peace Treaty were announced, I felt bitterly disillusioned. In our current events class we acted out the signing of the Versailles Treaty. I was given the role of Walter Rathenau, who signed for the Germans. Later, Keynes' \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\" confirmed my worst suspicions of that treaty.\n\nBy 19239 1 had accumulated enough credits to have a chance at being accepted at the University that fall. Father wisely decided that this was a bad idea; I was not only too young, but a University professor's son. He correctly judged that I would not be accepted as an equal so he sent me off to Hotchkiss for two years of growing up. There I didn't learn that much that I hadn't already been exposed to at U-High, but I did have a chance to catch up in maturity—whatever that means—with my peers.\n\nPaul Nitze went on to serve in various roles in the U.S. government—among them: as Vice Chairman of the US Strategic Bombing Survey (1944-46), for the State\n\nDepartment (1950-53), as Secretary of the Navy (196367), as Assistant Secretary of Defense (1973-76), and was named special advisor to the President on Arms Control in 1984. For over forty years, he was one of the chief architects of U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union.\n\nOn January 19, 2001, just one week before his 94th birthday, the USS Nitze was named for him \"to sail around the world and to remind us of the contribution you have made to our country\"—so said William Cohen, Secretary of Defense.\n\nTo the Point:\n\nFrom the HPHS Newsletter, February, 1982\n\nMuriel Beadle reports on a talk by Ezra Sensibar\n\nIt was in 1913 that Marshall Field gave $4 million to erect a natural history museum on the lakefront, on land to be created for that purpose. (Bear in mind that at the time the IC tracks ran on a trestle in the lake all the way from the Promontory to 18th Street, and that there was water 40 ft deep where the Field Museum, now stands.\n\nThe initial plan was to fill the site with clay, then cover it with sand. That combination, however, turned out in actuality to be mush\", and it was decided to combine clay and rubbish (collected from\n\nLoop offices, stores and streets) and top that with sand.\n\nOnce the fill was complete, wooden piles were driven down through it to the former lake bottom, and concrete piers were superimposed on the piles. These piers, which support the basement floor of the museum, rise to a height of 42 feet above the level of the lake and in effect place the museum on a manmade hill.\n\nTracks were laid to give railroad dump cars access to the site, and sand was hauled in. When dumped, though, its weight and force pushed some of the piers out of line and made them unusable as foundations.\n\nWhat to do? \"The marble was piling up,\" Mr.\n\nSensibar said. \"The architects were tearing their hair.\n\nNobody seemed to know how to solve the problem.\"\n\nAnd then a 24 year old Gary, Indiana resident, Jacob Sensibar (Ezra's older brother) had a bright idea. He was no engineer—in fact he was fresh off the farm— but he had eyes and a brain. \"Why not lay down the sand the same way a beach is built up—that is mixed with water and deposited gently on the site?\" he asked.\n\nThe architects decided to try it. Marshall Field loaned young Sensibar $40,000; Jacob bought a boat and equipment and began to pump in sand and water; and his system worked. So it is especially appropriate that the firm he founded has been identified with so many of Chicago's subsequent lakefront construction projects—including Promontory Point.\n\nA Page from Cap and Gown the University of Chicago Yearbook—1903\n\nThe Woman's Union\n\nAmong all the student organizations at the University none as ever been so far reaching in its benefits, so practical in its advantages and so democratic in spirit as the Woman's Union, organized in January, 1902, \"to unite the women of the University for the promotion of their common interests.\" Starting with a mere handful of faithful and enthusiastic workers, including both students and women of the Faculty, the membership has grown to almost four hundred... But the success of the Union is not measured by the length of its registration alone, for the benefits derived from membership are varied and along several lines.\n\nFormerly all women connected with the University who did not live at the halls or near the Campus brought their lunches with them, and the only accommodations for eating them, or for resting were in the cloak rooms and recitation rooms. Now all that is changed. In the Union rooms, which are at Lexington Hall, the new woman's building, lunch is served every day from 12:00 to 2:00 p.m., and for a moderate sum, soup, chocolate, sandwiches, fruit cake and pickles may be obtained.\n\nOther special accommodations are a rest room and reading room, in which may be found the daily paper and all the late magazines. Here, every day, from fifty to a hundred girls meet to eat, and chat, and rest. It is one of the unwritten laws of the Union that no stranger be allowed to eat luncheon alone, so that the Union, while offering material advantages, is also doing a great work along another much needed line. It is fostering and developing a spirit of equality and democracy which gives promise of a bright future... The girls enjoy not only the advantage of becoming acquainted with each other, but also the privilege of meeting wives of the faculty and other women.\n\nAlong business lines the Union has not only been self-supporting, but has to its credit in the bank a sum amounting to $67.73.\n\nPLEASE JOI N US FOR\n\nTHE HYDE PARK HISTORICAL SOCIETY\n\nSATURDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2002 THE QUADRANGLE CLUB\n\nSPEAKER Peter Ascoli\n\nTOPIC My Grandfather, Julius Rosenwald\n\nGATHERING 6PM • DINNER 7PM\n\nELECTION OF OFFICERS\n\nCORNELL AWARDS\n\nMAR K YOUR CALENDAR FOR\n\nSUNDAY, MARCH 3, 2002\n\n2-4PM\n\nAT OUR HEADQUARTERS\n\nClaude Weil\n\nformer resident and staff member\n\nWI LL SPEAK O N\n\nInternational House,\n\nIts History and Vision\n\n1932 to the Present\n\nAND ENJOY OUR EXHIBIT ON INTERNATIONAL\n\nHOUSE COMPILED BY STEVE TREFFMAN,\n\nBERT BENADE, CLAUDE WEIL, DENISE JORGENS, MARTA NICHOLAS\n\nAND PATRICIA JOBE\n\nSPECIAL MESSAGE\n\nMary Ellen Ziegler and I are creating a website on the\n\nOutdoor Public Art (Sculpture and Murals) on the South Side.

An entire wing of the Hall of Science at the Fair has been designated as Bridge Hall, and the\n\nUnited States Bridge Association has been selected by A Century of Progress as the organization to plan and operate the various Bridge activities at Bridge Hall.\n\nGeorge Reith, Executive Vice president of the Association, announces that there will be an interesting historical exhibit in the tournament hall showing the evolution of bridge and he expects several museum exhibits in this feature.\n\nIn addition to daily afternoon and evening play for suitable trophies, there will be featured weekly best score play for valuable prizes such as automobiles, bridge furniture, etc. It is also expected that many sectional tournaments, the winners of which will qualify for the national championships, will be held at the Fair...\n\nThe daily sessions will be preceded by half-hour lectures by well-known teachers, and numerous exhibition matches will be held by internationally famous players such as Ely Culbertson, Milton C.\n\nWork, Willard Karn, Oswald Jacoby, Theo A.

Halpin, Louis Haddad and Mr.\n\nReith.\n\nAn unusual feature in connection with the lectures and exhibition matches will be the use of an electrical board which will show to a large audience the bidding and play, bib by bid, and play by play, in a dramatically realistic manner.\n\nChicago and Its History\n\nAs Chicago approaches its centenary, more and more interest is being evidenced in the history of the city. Many little known facts about Chicago mentioned in the new Century of Progress book, \"Chicago's Great Century,\" by Henry Justin Smith, are of interest not only to Chicagoans but to all. Herewith we list some of the \"little known facts\" of Chicago history from Mr. Smith's book, which, incidentally, is having a wide sale:\n\nThe men who organized the town in 1833 were mostly 30 years of age or even younger.\n\nNew York had 200,000 population when Chicago had only a few hundred.\n\nAt the breaking of ground for the first ship canal, a judge was doused with water for predicting a city of 100,000.\n\nEarly citizens protested against theaters as \"nurseries of crime. \"\n\nWhen the first railroad from Chicago was being financed, a city banker refused it a loan of $20,000.\n\nCholera killed 931 persons in one month in 1849.\n\nChicago's White Stockings baseball club had as president in 1869 Potter Palmer. The team defeated Memphis by a score of 157 to 1.\n\nFrom A Hyde Park Childhood by Dorothy Michelson Livingston University of Chicago Alumnae Magazine, Winter, 1979\n\n\"We children attended the Laboratory School... I entered there for the first grade in 1912. We were taught the nursery rhymes in Latin, and in sixty-eight years I have not forgotten Domina Maria, tota contraria/ Quibiti crescit in horto?\n\nVolume 24, Numbers 1 & 2, Spring/Summer 2002\n\nBecause the Philippine Islands became an American possession after the Spanish American War, Filipino Emigres-labeled \"nationals\"- could not acquire full U.S. citizenship until the Philippines gained independence in 1946. From 1900 until 1934 they usually came to America as a source of cheap labor, in jobs earlier reserved for the Chinese (who had been excluded by the \"Chinese Exclusion Law\").\n\nThose who came to Hyde Park however, often came for educational opportunities; many went back to the Islands to become professionals and government leaders.\n\nOthers, like Florentino Ravelo, stayed here to make a better life. His daughter, Estrella Ravelo Alamar, and her co-author Willi Buhay, have just published their book Images of America, Filipinos in Chicago, a book of photographs and the basis of a new exhibit at HPHS Headquarters which Estrella and Willi have prepared.

In this issue we are delighted to be able to present another such remembrance.\n\nLIVI NG IN HYDE PARK DURING WORLD WAR II\n\nby Mary Powell Hammersmith\n\nIn the fall of 1944, when my husband's army unit was about to embark for Europe, I returned to Chicago tO live until the end of the war. My parents lived in Hyde Park, as had my father's parent from about 1990, and I had been born there. Ac the time of my return to the city, my brother, Chester B. Powell, a physician then in a neurosurgical residency, and his wife were living with my parents. That meant I would have to find an apartment of my own-no easy accomplishment with war-time shortages.\n\nThis was achieved with the help of my sister-in-law who worked in the Loop. She would get the Chicago Tribune as soon as it came off the press, read any for­ rent ads and call me to give me a number to call. That made me one of-the-first to inquire about an apartment and it worked! The agent, a man with the unlikely name of Leon Sex, told me to come to his\n\nLoop office. I did, and shortly thereafter the apartment on the third floor at 5419 University was mine. Only about six blocks from my parents, ideal for our\n\nsixteen-month-old son and me, close to my brother's home and, as his time was claimed by his medical residency, his wife and I were able to spend much time together.\n\nBecause we both liked ice-skating, she borrowed ID cards from two friends who worked at the University. We thought these would get us into the rink under the north stands of Stagg Field. Fortunately for us, the ID cards had no pictures. Even so, it was not easy to get past the gatekeeper. We wondered why such a big deal was made of the simple matter of admitting a couple of women to an ice rink. Noc until after the war did we learn that secret nuclear research was being carried out under the west stands-only those directly involved had any idea of what was caking place there.\n\nAcross the hall from my apartment lived a nice young couple with their little boy about the age of my son. His mother and I, our children in strollers, often walked together to the grocery score on 55th Street. I knew her last name but it meant nothing ocher than it\n\nwas just that-her name. Then, a few years after the war had ended, our copy of Time magazine arrived­ on its front cover the picture of our former neighbor. He had been appointed the first head of the Atomic Energy Commission. His name? Glenn Seaborg.\n\nToday, if you enter \"Seaborg\" as the key word co search che web, you can read about what chis remarkable man achieved in his lifetime. In 1951, at age 39, he shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry with Edwin M. McMillan. Seaborgium is named for him. He helped develop the atomic bomb, was a discoverer of elements 94 through 98 and 101 of che periodic cable. Called the Renaissance Man of the Twentieth Century, no less than 1160 sires on the Google Search Engine list Seaborg. He devoted his lacer years to a program encouraging young people to enter the field of science.\n\nIn 1999, shortly after I had read of Seaborg's death, I learned chat our California grandson had won a chemistry contest in high school and the prize had been presented to him by Seaborg. Our grandson was amazed co learn chat Seaborg had lived across the hall from his grandparents during the war,\n\nAnother neighbor who worked on the Manhattan Project, as the work at Stagg Field came to be known, was Walter Zinn who lived with his wife and son and his mother on the north side of 58th Street, just east of Kenwood. At 5741 Kenwood, in the first floor apartment of a three-story gray-stone built at the time of the Columbian Exposition, lived my parents. Their backyard at 5741 was long and narrow and the Zinn apartment's back porch overlooked it. Grandma Zinn and my mother would have occasional neighborly\n\nchats and little Johnny Zinn, her grandson, ofren came over to play with our son when we were visiting my parents.\n\nA sandbox which my father had built pr,ovided hours of entertainment for the two little boys. In ordering the sand, however, we discovered that suppliers would deliver it in a minimum of one cubic yard and, after filling the sandbox, we had a huge surplus. Until you have tried to dispose of that much sand in the city, you cannot comprehend the extent of such a problem. Worst of all, the city notified us that\n\nthe sand had to be cleared from the walk before nightfall! I cannot remember how we accomplished it without a car-but we did.\n\nOn the floor above my parents lived a woman named Rowena Morse Mann. She said she was a granddaughter of Samuel F. B. Morse-we had no reason to doubt it. Above her lived a group of people including Charlotte Towle, a professor of Psychiatric Social Work at the University. She wrote a book that is a classic in the field, Basic Human Needs. A soft­ spoken, warm person, she was devoted to her dog and fond of playing poker. With her lived her sister,\n\nMildred who kept house, their brother, and Mary Rall, who held a high level position with Chicago Catholic Charities. She, too, liked to play poker and often came down with che others for poker sessions with my parents and the rest of us.\n\nShortages were a big problem for everyone. All sorts of things were rationed-canned goods, shoes, gasoline (unimportant to us because we didn't have a car), even railway travel. Generally only persons in the armed forces, or others connected with war-related work were allowed to travel on trains ocher than local ones. Larger families had ration books for each family member and, as a result, could purchase things more easily-provided the stores had what they wanted.\n\nCanned fruit was scarce. Meat was too. And sugar was a real problem. With only my ration book and our little boy's, I often had to wear old shoes because his feet were growing rapidly and I would have to use my shoe quota for him. I still have one of those rations books.\n\nSo many things were rationed on the home front because chose were the very things being sent to the men in the armed forces. When they returned home, they couldn't stand the sight of Spam, canned fruit cocktail, chipped beef, and ocher things we at home had not seen for years! Another scarce commodity, during-and after-the war were nylon stockings. They had just come on the market before the war • broke out and, as nylon was needed for parachutes, they became almost non-existent on the home front. Bue a produce was soon marketed which enabled women co color their legs so as co look as if they had on stockings!\n\nle is hard to describe the total upheaval the war brought to our lives. My husband, a reserve officer, had been called to active duty when he had only eleven hours to go to gee is B. S. in Civil Engineering.\n\nI was in my last semester too, but when he got his first leave, I notified my parents that we wanted to get married. They had only a few days to arrange for our wedding in the Thorndike Hilton Chapel, on 58th, across from the Oriental Institute. Still, friends and family who could get there did making the event all a wedding ought to be. My husband had a few days leave before returning to Ft. Belvoir, south of Alexandria, Virginia, where he was an instructor in the Officers Candidate School (Army Engineers). I did not go with him then because I had promised my parents that I would go back to the University of Illinois to finish my own work. I was able to petition out of the graduation ceremony and joined my husband right after my course work was finished. Our first child was born fifteen months later at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D. C. at about the time casualties from the North Africa Invasion were being brought to the hospital. Civilian patients, even those having first babies, got minimal care.\n\nAn event I recall from my days in Hyde Park happened when I was walking along 57th Street toward the IC station. Suddenly a woman who was a total stranger stepped from the door of an apartment building and, in a voice filled with alarm, said, \"Roosevelt has died!\" My reaction was similar to hers, though nor as strong. I had never been a Roosevelt fan, but he had been president for twelve years and many young people had never known any other president. Some had come to believe that there just was no one else who could take Roosevelt's place.\n\nWhen the little-known Harry Truman succeeded Roosevelt, people in general feared the worst­ including me. When he decided to use the atomic bomb on Japan, many were aghast, but not the men who already had served for four years and certainly not the troops being prepared to invade Japan. We wanted our children to grow up with live fathers. We had not provoked the Pearl Harbor attack! We had given a lot but not as much as the families whose sons and husbands would not be returning, like my husband's brother, still listed as missing in action at war's end.\n\nYears later, when captured German war records had\n\nbeen translated, we learned of his fate. His parents never knew-by that time they were dead.\n\nMy view of Harry Truman was totally changed when I saw that he had made a hard decision, one that would save American lives, though at terrible cost to the Japanese. Over the years there was considerable criticism of Truman's use of atomic bombs on the civilian populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but that criticism has not come from children whose fathers were spared being among those scheduled for an invasion of the Japanese mainland.\n\nIn many ways, Hyde Park seems not to have changed over the years. Some things are no more, like my uncle's large frame house that stood on the west side of Kenwood a few doors north of 57th Street. My first recollection of it was when I was about four and was assigned the job of bringing in, on a velvet pillow, the engagement ring of my uncle's step-daughter during her engagement party. After completing my assignment, I retreated to safety under the dining room table.\n\nToday a small neighborhood park has replaced that\n\nhouse. Next door to the south, in what was the last row house there, my great grandmother (grandmother to my father), Isadore Clark Scott Badollet had died in January, 1914. She had been born in 1828 in Vincennes, Indiana, daughter of John Crockwell Clark, a colorful inn-keeper originally from Winchester, Virginia. Her mother was Susannah McCutcheon, whose brother was an ancestor to John\n\nT. McCutcheon, famous cartoonist with the Chicago Tribune. A few years ago, John T. McCutcheon, Jr. and I arranged ro meet at the Newberry Library ro compare notes on our mutual ancestors.\n\nAmong my treasured memories is a cheer which my uncle, Chauncey Powell, attributed to students at Hyde Park High School-a cheer in Latin, possibly corrupted-it's been quite a few years since I learned Latin.\n\nCertior factus. Quamo Brem Exploritoribus, Hastes spem.\n\nDown in a coal mine shoveling smoke Hyde Park High School... Hie, haec hoc!\n\nMy Uncle Chauncey's phonetic rendition went something like this:\n\nKer-tee-or fahk-tus, Kwah-mo brem Explor-itor-i-bus Hose-tase spem, Down in a coal mine shoveling smoke\n\nHyde Park High School. .. Hick, Hike, Hoke!\n\nNow that is one tidbit of Hyde Park Trivia that has always seemed to me to be important enough to preserve\n\nTHE POINT IS...\n\nThe Point is Promontory Point , an important feature of Daniel Burnharn's 1909 Plan for Chicago, created by landfill in the 1920s, and in 1937, landscaped by Alfred Caldwell. For all the years since, the Point has been an oasis for the community-a place to stroll and swim and play and meditate.\n\nIn January, 2001, the Chicago Park District held a public meeting at which they unveiled a plan to replace the Point's lirnesrone seawall with a massive concrete and steel revetment-part of a large, federally funded project already in progress for several years. At the meeting, attended by over 200 people, community members expressed overwhelming opposition to the plan which was seen as both a violation of the Park's aesthetic beauty and a compromise of its recreational uses. An ad hoc group called the Community Task Force for Promontory Point was formed with the aim of seeking alternatives to the Park District's design.\n\nIn the seventy-five years since its construction, wave action bas indeed damaged sections of the seawall and the Task Force recognizes that repairs are necessary.\n\nAnd, although the city has offered some modifications, the plan still appears to community members to be a greater threat to the Point than the ravages of time and nature. The proposed redesign is not only ugly and inimical to traditional uses-it also appears to be significantly over-engineered. It should not be necessary to destroy the Point in order to save it.\n\nThe Task Force has made it clear to Park District officials that their plan is unacceptable to the community and the city has postponed construction until April, 2003. Now the challenge is co present the city with positive and unambiguous guidelines for any new design-guidelines which include an engineering survey as well as consideration of the historic character of the Point and the public's access to it.\n\nThe Richard H. Driehaus Foundation has recognized the importance of this effort with a $20,000 grant to the Historical Society on behalf of the Community Task Force for Promontory Point. In addition to the direct grant, the Foundation will match every dollar the community raises up co $5000. That could mean another $10,000 toward the considerable expenses involved in an engineering study of the Point.\n\nMATCHING GRANT UPDATE: Thanks to HPHS members and to the whole community, we have reached our\n\n$5000 matching grant goal.

Thank you!\n\nBACKYARD BASEBALL\n\nLike most of thepre-teenboys growing up inChicago,baseballwassomethingweallplayed,beginning inthe spring before going awaytoMichiganforthesummer.We playedin JackmanFieldbehindour elementaryschool during acompulsorygymperiodeveryafternoon.\n\nBue the real adjustment of baseball's rules to accommodate special conditions came when we played in the backyard of the Stevens' boys home on 58th street near the school. There are many forms of baseball from the big league version to the pick-up sandlot modifications. The ability of baseball t0 adapt itself was tested by four boys and a dog in 1927. The rules were set out by three brothers and me, so chat our game would be clarified and disciplined.\n\nBaseball adjusted to our self-made regulations because baseball is different from other games in chat it is not limited by time; it is outside of time. Theoretically, a game can go on\n\nforever. We found chat we had to make our own rules, and in the case of a disagreement about the outcome of\n\na play, in the absence of an umpire we would toss a coin to come co the final decision.\n\nHere are the rules, which provided for competition between two teams of players:\n\n1. Underhand easy pitching.\n\n2. Indian ball.\n\n3. Pitcher's hands are out.\n\n4. Over the fence is out.\n\n5. If a player is on base and a hit is made, the player must go home. If home plate is rouched by an opposing player holding the ball, the player on base is out.\n\n6. If there is any dispute, a coin\n\nmust be tossed to determine the decision.\n\n7. If the ball hits Monday on a doubtful play, the play goes over.\n\n8. A player on base can go as far as possible on any out, except a strike-out.\n\n9. On June 10, provided that more than 15 five­ inning games have been played, and provided chat one team is more than one game ahead of the other team, the losing team must buy for the winning team all the sodas, ice cream, malted\n\nmilks, and sundaes that the winning team can eat in one hour at Kuenster's Drugstore on 57th Street.\n\nSigned:\n\nBill Stevens\n\nJohn Stevens\n\nSam Hair\n\nJim Stevens\n\nIt is well to explain that rule number seven refers to \"Monday,\" a large black and tan collie dog, who would play if he could, but we told him he was not in the lineup. He was free to run and bark, and participate in that way in the excitement of the game. The deadline of June 10th was established because that was about the time when we all went away to The deadline of June 10th was established because that was about che rime when we all went away to Michigan for the summer: the Stevens boys to Lakeside and I to Castle Park, not to return until after Labor Day.\n\nIt didn't matter that there were only two on each team .And rule number four-\"over the fence is out provided our adjustment to baseball's spatial frame, which projects the lines from home plate to first and third bases into infinity. Any ball within that ultimate projection is fair; outside those lines it is foul, but sometimes playable. But we had outfield limits imposed by a fence, two brick walls, and one large house surrounding the backyard playing field.\n\nBaseball being a game of records, it is unfortunate that there are no records of the scores of these games, and the names of those on the winning team are lost forever in the mists of over three score and ten years. The players survive: Two of the brothers are retired lawyers. The third and youngest brother is also a lawyer, and at this writing is an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. I am the fourth player, not a lawyer, but carrying with me the confirmation of the metaphysical nature of our national pastime, and now more than ever aware that baseball ignores time. We proved it long ago.\n\nVolume 24, Numbers 3 & 4, Autumn/Winter 2002\n\nVolume 23, Number 1\n\nWhen Tarzan Went to Harvard\n\nBy Edgar Rice Burroughs\n\nBecause I attended Harvard School sometime between the Pliocene and Pleistocene eras, Miss Schobinger has suggested that I write a little article for the School Annual and call it Before the Birth of Tarzan.... It was in 1888 that I entered the old Harvard School at 21st Street and Indiana Avenue, where my brother, Coleman, had been a student for a year. I was never a student-I just went to school there.\n\nI lived over on the West Side where everybody made his money in those days and then moved to the South Side to show off. I kept my pony in a livery stable on Madison Street west of Robey Street... and in good weather I rode to school. In inclement weather, I took the Madison Street horse-cars to Wabash, a cable-car to 18th Street, and another horse-car to school. Sometimes, returning from school, I used to run down Madison Street from State Street to Lincoln Street, a matter of some three miles, to see how many horse-cars I could beat in that direction. It tires me all out even to think of it now. I must have been long on energy, if a trifle short on brains.\n\nI cannot recall much about my classmates. Mancel Clark, Bennie Marshall, and I came over to Harvard together from Miss Coolie's Maplehurst School for Girls on the West Side-and were we glad to escape that blot on our escutcheons! There had been a diphtheria epidemic in the public schools the previous year, and our fond parents had prevailed upon Miss Coolie to take us in...\n\nBennie Marshall and I used to sneak down to the breakwater and smoke cubeb cigarettes and feel real devilish. I imagine we even chewed gum too. He> became a very famous Chicago architect (with Charles Eli Fox, he designed the Drake Hotel-Ed.) I can see him now sitting at his desk drawing pictures and chewing his tongue when he should have been studying.\n\nAt Harvard School I studied Greek and Latin because someone believed that they should be taught before English grammar was taken up; then I went to Andover and studied Greek and Latin all over again. So, having never studied English, I conceived the brilliant idea of taking up writing as my profession. Perhaps, had I studied English grammar, I would have known better, but then there would have been no Tarzan... There should be a moral to this. Perhaps it is that one should not smoke cubeb cigarettes.\n\nREMEMBERING GWENDOLYN BROOKS\n\nby Stephen A. Treffman, HPHS Archivist\n\n\"MAY THE NEW CENTURY SING TO YOU.\"\n\nAt our last annual meeting, HPHS had to be satisfied with giving Gwendolyn Brooks an award in absentia. In lieu of placing the Paul Cornell Award into her hands, we sent it to her accompanied by a copy of Bert Benade's remarks (see page 3) along with a report on how receptive our board and membership had been to the idea of granting her our 'award.\n\nIn an enthusiastic response, Ms. Brooks sent the Society two books, warmly inscribed, along with a\n\nnote gently reminding us that she was a working writer, one who wrote to be read, not celebrated. All the punctuation is hers. March 9, 2000 Hi! I thank you for your beautiful\n\nTribute! \"Read\" these books (I—as ifyou have TIME\n\nGalore!)... before delivering to the Library! Gratefully\n\nGwen Brooks (I thank you ALL for honoring me!)\n\nShe gave us the second volume of her\n\n\"autobiography,\" Report from Part Tu'0. (Chicago, Third World Press, 1996) The inscription reads: For the\n\nLibrary of the Hyde Park Historical Society. (May the NetC' Century SING to you!) Three large pink post-it-notes were inserted indicating stories she especially wanted us to notice: \"My Mother, In Ghana,\" and \"Black Woman in Russia.\n\nThe other book is a self-published work, Children Coming Home (Chicago, 1991). It consists of short poems expressing the reflections of children under stress as they arrive home from school.\n\nTwo additional books came to us last June. The inscription in Thirtx-First Annual Illinois Poet Laureate Awards 2000 (Chicago: privately printed) reads:\n\nThank you so much! For the copy of \"Hyde Park History. \" Yes, I'd appreciate two or three extra copies. I hope you enjoy the young people's poems. I gave 45 prizes of $ 100 each on June 12 at the U. of C. I'm so proud of them!\"\n\nEach page contains a single winning poem. At the bottom of each sheet is written, in Gwendolyn Brooks' hand, the name of the student, his or her age, grade and school. She had good reason to be proud of them. In the introduction, she addressed this note to the winners:\n\nCongratulations!... on winning your Illinois Poet Laureate Award! I am proud ofyou, and I am proud to meet you. I appreciate yonr respect for poetry and interest in experimenting with language-with sound and texture and\n\nmanner.\n\nAll of your life, poetry can be a nourishing gift to yourself a Performance to enjoy and change; an irresistible influence.\n\nGwendolyn Brooks, an extraordinarily perceptive witness of our corner of the world, \"sang\" to us for more than half of the last century. She crafted deceptively simple lines of verse that communicated profound insights, enlightened us and enriched the world in which we live. We are grateful to have had her among us, honored that we could call her one of our own and were drawn more closely into community because of what she did with her life. We feel especially fortunate that we had the opportunity to tell her so while she was still among us.\n\nPRESENTATION OF\n\nTHE PAUL CORNELL\n\nAWARD TO\n\nGWENDOLYN BROOKS\n\nHPHS ANNUAL MEETING, FEBRUARY 26, 2000\n\nRemarks by Berrt Benade\n\nOur final awardee is the Poet Laureate of Illinois, Gwendolyn Brooks. We are sorry that she cannot be with us tonight. But, in a way, I am fortunate that she isn,'t here because she might protest the bits and pieces of her life that I want to share with you.\n\nIn 1972 she published her autobiography. It is not about chronology but process, and, though the book stops in the year 1972, her process of enrichment has continued.\n\nShe was born in Topeka, Kansas, in 1917, and was three years old when her family moved to Chicago. Here she had many homes: 46th and Lake Park, 56th and Lake Park, 43rd and Champlain, among others. And now she lives south of 55th Street on South Shore Drive.\n\nAt age seven, she started rhyming words and by eleven was putting poems in notebooks—still in her possession. Her mother told her she would be \"a lady Paul Lawrence Dunbar someday. \" Her family was warm and supportive, but she chose to be a loner who wrote poetry. She attended high school at Hyde Park Branch, Englewood and Wendell Phillips and then went on to Wilson Junior college. As a young teenager she sent her work to well-known poets, among them Langston Hughes who responded enthusiastically and with whom she remained friends for life.\n\nLater on, when Oscar Brown Jr. helped the\n\nBlackstone Rangers create \"Opportunity Please Knock,\" he asked her to review it. She was so taken by the project that she stayed with the Rangers to help them write and develop it. (Incidentally, 'Opportunity Please Knock\" was an exhilarating piece of theater.)\n\nShe went on Freedom Rides and slowly realized how deep and unconscious discrimination can be. She notes that even in Merriam Webster's Dictionary it shows up. When you look up the word \"black,\" one of the meanings is given as \"opposite of white. \" However, when you look up \"white\", there is no mention of \"black.\" For her, integration then began to mean when Negroes (the educated, professional elite) embraced equally all Blacks (the masses).\n\nNot having an \"earned\" degree, she now has a whole string of Honorary Doctorates and many other accolades, but the ones she loves come from elsewhere. She speaks about a note from a 16 year old boy who was going to quit school until he heard her recite her poem \"We Real cool.\"\n\n\"Now I know there is no place like school, I would want to tell her how I feel inside my heart.\"\n\nGwendolyn Brooks never stops growing. In 1971, she flew for the first time and loved it \"because it opened up new horizons—being airborne.\" She speaks with an open heart and doesn't have rules that constrain her. One of her contemporaries says of her, \"She is the continuing storm that walks the English language as lions walk in Africa.\" Her convictions, her strengths and her commitment come out of an exciting and inspiring life.\n\nOurs is an Historical Society and the Cornell Award is intended to confer recognition upon persons who have preserved or extended our understanding and appreciation of Hyde Park's history. Gwendolyn Brooks' contribution has been to give voice and perspective to the story of the African American community which has developed within and become so important to the history of Chicago's south side and to Hyde Park. In the process she has enriched the lives of all of us.\n\nPaul Cornell Awards Committee, 2000\n\nBert Benade, Chair\n\nDevereaux Bow/ey\n\nStephen A.

A Chicago City Railway's cable car, clearly marked Number 1597, is depicted heading south on Cottage Grove. It is rumored that the concrete and stone base of the cable car power house still exists on its original site, buried deep under the ground. The hotel itself was demolished during urban renewal in the 1950s. —S.A.T.\n\nOur thanks to Board Member Carol Bradford for bringing us this glimpse of our history IN MEMORY OF EDWIN BURRITT SMITH\n\nAfter the close of the World's Columbian Exposition, in the mid-1890's, Chicagoans began to look seriously and critically at the social, economic, and political circumstances of their city. They saw a city government whose members were known to enrich themselves at public expense. It tolerated gambling, prostitution, bribery, vote fraud, abuse of patronage, and monopolistic control of public utilities which yielded enormous private profit. The Municipal Voters' League and other organizations were formed in an effort to address these problems. They were part of the larger Progressive movement which swept the country during this time. The reformers also worked to ameliorate the harmful effects of industrialism and business monopolies: urban slums, poverty, and unsafe working conditions.\n\nA Hyde Park attorney, Edwin Burritt Smith, was a prominent and active participant in the reform efforts. At the time of his death on May 9, 1906, a memorial service was held at the University Congregational Church, with tributes from many men who were prominent locally and nationally in the Progressive Movement. The church devoted one entire issue of its monthly newsletter, The Chronicle, to printing the texts of their tributes, excerpts of which are included here.\n\n\"He found time to throw himself into those lines of thought, and especially of activity, which Promised to open a door of opportunity to man, which Promised to release at any point the motive and the possibility o fself-growth, and self-government. He did thoroughly and obstinately believe in man...So far as he could choose to have it so, the employment of his Professional Powers was in the interest of a more adequate and abundant life to the individual\" Rev. Frederick Dewhurst, the eulogy.\n\n\"For, more than upon anything else, his u'hole life centered down upon the welfare of the commonwealth, which called forth all his energies into their most virile expression. In his vision each such struggle as that for the civil service law, for honesty and capacity in city government, for the municipal control of public utilities, for the Peaceful Progress of the nation in the spirit of its constitution and history, and for the social unification of our cosmopolitan people by social settlements and other centers of human equality, was only part of the one great cause of a sane, safe and Progressive democracy. To that greatest cause Mr. Smith devoted the fine abilities and tremendous energies of his life with a generosity and courage, that never seemed to count the Personal cost of his public service. \" Letter from Graham Taylor.\n\nMr. Smith was born in Spartanburg, PA, in 1854. His parents were both teachers who died when he was very young. He spent some of his youth in an orphanage and seemed destined for a life of obscure poverty. Yet his fortitude, vigor, far-seeing hope, and intelligence enabled him to triumph over every obstacle. As a teenager, he was a farm hand, then became a teacher. From 1874 to 1876 he studied at Western Reserve and Oberlin College. After that, he came to Chicago and decided this would be his home. He left to study law at Yale, but after earning his degree in 1880 he returned to Chicago and plunged into his work as an author and teacher of the law. He soon became involved in many of the reform movements which were active in the city during this time.\n\n\"He was a giant ofaffairs, a prodigy offacts but his heart was gentleness itself \" Letter from John G. Wooley.\n\nHe and his wife had two sons, Curtis and Otis. The family lived at 5530 South Cornell and were\n\nactive and faithful members of the University Congregational Church, located at 56th Street and Dorchester Avenue.\n\n\"His death is a calamity. Few men of my time have brought to the service of the public, such intelligence, such ability, such unselfish devotion, such untiring zeal. Unpopularity had no terrors for him, Preferment no temptations, and when he decided that a certain course u'as right he brought to its support all of his Powers wit/90//t thought ofPersonal consequences. He rendered conspicuous service to his city, to his state and to his country u'ithout asking any recognition for himself... \" Letter from Moorfield Storey.\n\nA primary target of the reform effort was Charles T. Yerkes, who held a monopoly of most of the streetcar companies. \"With shrewdness, cunning, and force of personality; through continuous stock manipulation; and never without back-door political dealing and bribery, Yerkes constructed a purposely tangled maze of companies that facilitated his kind of large-scale financing. Nor was it happenstance that directly or indirectly he controlled most of the companies that contracted for his projects, nor that those companies' billings were astronomical. Nor that every contractor who did work for him kicked back part of the padded charges.\" (Johnson, p. 2) Smith was the attorney chosen by the city council to advise it and assist in drafting legislation which would break this abusive monopoly. He was also one of the attorneys chosen by the Chicago Bar Association to investigate the possibility of establishing a separate juvenile court system.\n\n\"The list of his civic activities is a history of the better Chicago, not yet a good Chicago, but a vigorous militant demonstration that the great city is the hope of democracy, The earliest step u'as the Passage and adoption of the Civil Service Law. In that movement he was deeply identified. He worked early and hard in the Civic Federation From its inception he was one of the strongest men in the Municipal Voters' League, where his calm courage, his legal knowledge and his power of analysis and statement made him especially terrible to evil doers.... Without hesitation he favored, u'hat some call the 'socialism' of municipal ownership, as an antidote to the 'anarchism' of private ownership as Practiced in Chicago.... The traction problem with its three ugly heads, political, physical and legal, claimed a vast amount of his time and attention. \"MR. SMITH AS A CITIZEN\" by William Kent.\n\n\"The range of his Practice was wide and varied. . ...He was active in litigation involving questions ofpublic interest, the civil service law, the Hyde Park Protective Association, and all are familiar with his recent activities as special council for the city of Chicago in the important traction litigation u'hich seems now to be drawing to a close. \"\n\n\"MR.

We used the money to set up a web page, with the hope that it could provide access to our archives for those who are studying community history. You may see this page by going on the internet and looking up www.hydeparkhistory.org.\n\nThis year we are to receive $5,000 from Senator Barack Obama and Representative Currie. With these additional funds we are launched on working with the schools. We've started with Ray School. We have met with the computer teacher at Ray, and spoken with the principal there. Our method is to offer help to teachers whose curriculum includes study of the community—third and eighth grades. With the assurance that we shall receive our full funding, we are planning to expand our pilot project to Brete Harte and Murray Schools and to Kenwood High School. In the future we will expand to all the schools in our community.\n\nWe hope that this project will result in an interactive exchange—we can provide the information about the fascinating history of this community. We hope that the students will post material from their work on our page, so that others, all around the world, will be able to see what our students can do. We also expect that information will flow in both directions as a result of this effort.\n\nWe are very grateful to Barbara and Barack for their help in getting us started on this exciting step in making the archives and newsletters of the Society available to the young people of our area, and in strengthening the bond between us.\n\nWORLD WAR Il AND HYDE PARK\n\nMemories and artifacts of Hyde Park during World War Il would be of great interest to us. That was an intense period and if any of our readers who lived in Hyde Park during that period would like to share their memories, we would like to have them. What was Hyde Park like in those days? What changes in Hyde Park occurred during the War? Write us a letter and tell us about your experiences during that period. We are also seeking Hyde Park memorabilia from that period. —S.A.T.\n\nA CABLE CAR TRAINMAN—a burly bearded grip man, bundled in a thick fur coat and gloves against the harsh wintry elements.

Life was not easy in those days.\n\nVolume 23, Number 2\n\nIn 1987. to mark the 50th anniversary of Promontory Point. the Hyde Park Historical Society and Friends of the Parks produced a brief history of that landmark landscape. Today. when interest in the Point is so high. we think it timely to reprod11ce that dowwent for yot1r information...\n\nPromontory Point\n\n1937-1987\n\nBy John McDermott, Jr.\n\nEdited by Victoria Post Ranney\n\nPromontory Point, at 55th Street and Lake Michigan, is an historic landscape and the focal point of Chicago's Burnham Park. Conceived as part of Daniel Burnham's Plan of Chicago, in 1909, \"the Point\" was created by landfill in the 1920s and landscaped in 1937 by Alfred Caldwell in the Prairie School tradition. To Caldwell, the Promontory represented the meeting place of the vast prairie and the Great Lakes, and thus symbolized all that was unique about the landscape of Chicago. Today, Caldwell's design can still be recognized, and its spirit makes Promontory Point a favorite retreat for Chicagoans from all walks of life.\n\nAn early Chicagoan walking east on 55th Street would have met the lake just east of Everett Avenue. Burnham called for a promontory co be built in the lake near 52nd Street, along with a series of islands and lagoons screeching from 12th Street co Jackson Park. In 1919, the City Council approved a plan co fill in the south lakeshore according co Burnham's plan.\n\nThe Commissioners of the South Park District hired the Construction Materials Corporation co construct a breakwater and fill the area inside it with sand. The filling operation, which began at 12th Street and progressed coward the south, reached 5 5ch Street by 1924. There, and not at 52nd Street, it created a promontory.\n\nBy 1926, the 55th Street Promontory, as it came co be called, had been largely filled with sand and garbage. The latter component upset the Hyde Park Herald which complained not only chat the rubbish was unsightly, but also that the wind blew sand and foul odors into the new apartment buildings nearby.\n\nIn 1917, there had been only one such building near55th and the lake, the ten-story apartment house at5490 South Shore Drive. Bue in the mid-1920's, the residential area to the west developed rapidly. The huge Shoreland Hotel was completed in 1926, and the Flamingo opened in 1927. These buildings began a wave of hotel growth that eventually provided 20,000 rooms in East Hyde Park.\n\nBy 1929, grass was planted on the Promontory. Leif Erickson Drive (now Lake Shore Drive) was opened to traffic and trees were planted on the portion of landfill west of the Drive. But construction did not proceed until the consolidated Chicago Park District was formed in 1934. At about that time, Fifth Ward Alderman James Cusak began to receive complaints that the Promontory was being used as a makeshift parking lot by the nearby Shoreland Hotel. In an interview shortly before his death in 1986, Cusak said that he had used his influence with the Park District's new general superintendent, George T. Donoghue, to have the parking lot removed and the Promontory developed.\n\nWhether or not Cusak's influence played a role, the\n\nPromontory, in 193 5,was designated to receive funds and workers from the Works Progress Administration. It was one of 67 Illinois parks which the WPA assisted during the Depression. Thanks to the WPA, the Point was developed as we know it today.\n\nThe planning was assigned to Alfred Caldwell, an architect and landscape architect on the Park District staff. From 1926 to 1931, Caldwell had assisted Jens Jensen, the great landscape architect of Chicago's West Park system and the pre-eminent figure in the Prairie School movement in his field. Caldwell shared Jensen's devotion to the midwestern landscape and his practice of using only native plants in his parks.\n\nCaldwell began by adding soil, raising the meadow to its present height and creating a hill where a shelter would be built. By the summer of 1936, water and sewer pipes had been laid, and the underpass below the Drive was completed.\n\nCaldwell's planting plan, dated September 1, 1936, relied on indigenous plants. It included 241 American elms, 50 American lindens, and 637 prairie crabapples, as well as sugar maples, hop hornbeams, and two varieties of hawthorn, the tree which had been one of Jensen's trademarks.\n\nThe thick groves of trees and shrubs formed a ring around a large central meadow which sloped downward gradually toward the path. The ring was interrupted at the north, allowing a spectacular view of the downtown skyline, and at the south, where the vast manufacturing districts of South Chicago and Indiana were visible on the horizon. The Point includes two distinct experiences: the lofty meadow, from which the rocks along the water cannot be seen, and the rocks themselves, from which the meadow cannot be seen. Plantings on the outer edge of the peninsula once reinforced this distinction.\n\nCaldwell said in a 1986 interview that he had conceived of the Promontory as \"a place you go co and you are thrilled-a beautiful experience, a joy, a delight.\" He sought co convey \"a sense of space and a sense of the power of nature and the power of the sea.\"\n\nA member of the Park District's architectural staff,\n\nE. V. Buchsbaum, designed the shelter (now known as the fieldhouse). Construction began in 1936 and was finished the next year. The walls were made of Lannon scone, quarried in Wisconsin. Caldwell, an architectural modernist, tolerated the building though he felt it was coo heavy for the site and of little architectural value. Buchsbaum felt he was creating a \"picturesque, distinctive building\" and that its playful allusion co a castle or a lighthouse were appropriate for the setting.\n\nAfter 193 7, the area received various small improvements. Benches were erected in 1938. Boulders called for in Caldwell's plan were set in place in March, 1939. Also in that year, the David Wallach Memorial, a bronze sculpture of a resting fawn set on a marble fountain, was dedicated. Little is known about David Wallach who, at his death in 1894 left a bequest for a fountain in a park for \"man and beast.\" True co his wish, the monument has a drinking fountain at ground level which has been enjoyed by generations of local beasts.\n\nIn the late 1930's and 40's, the Shelter became a busy center for square dances, scout meetings and other activities. In 1953, the U.S. Army leased land from the Park District for a Nike missile base on a Jackson Park meadow. Soon afterward, it cook pare of the Point for a radar site. The towers stood south of the fieldhouse on a large tract surrounded by a barbed wire fence. One of the cowers reached 150 feet in height, and all of chem dwarfed the turret of the fieldhouse.\n\nMany neighborhood residents resented the radar cowers, but protests became vocal only in the Vietnam era. After the cowers finally came down in 1971, there was a victory rally with the slogan, \"We've won our Point!\"\n\nFor its 50th anniversary in 1987, a group of landscape architects carefully surveyed the Point, comparing the original features executed under Caldwell with the landscape of today. Though few of the original shrubs and trees remain, and lake damage has badly_eroded the perimeter, the basic features and open spirit of the design can be seen. Park District officials and the public, recognizing the place of Promontory Point in Chicago's past and its value in the present, should work co restore, for future generations, chis historic prairie landscape on the lake.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS AND FILMS SOUGHT\n\nBeach Street Educational Films is making a movie about World War 11 servicemen who were refugees from Germany and Austria during the 30s and 40s. Because Hyde Park received many of these refugees, the film makers have asked the Society for help. Julia Rath, producer of the film, would like to have pictures from that time of any such refugees who served in the armed forces during the war.

Treffman\n\nAlfred Caldwell, the landscape designer of Promontory Point, was a poet, landscape architect, civil engineer, city planner, philosopher and distinguished professor. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1903. lo 1909 his family moved to Chicago. He attended Ravenswood Elementary School and Lake View High School, where he became fascinated by the study of botany and Latin. After a brief but unhappy stint in the landscape architecture program at the University of Illinois, Caldwell managed to land a job in 1924 as an assistant to Jens\n\nJ eosen, the highly respected Chicago landscape architect. Jensen would ultimately characterize Caldwell as a \"genius.\" In 1927, Caldwell befriended and was profoundly influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nThe onset of the Depression broke up Jensen's firm and from 1931 to 1934, Caldwell was in private practice as a landscape architect. From 1934 to 1936 he served Dubuque, Iowa as its Superintendent of Parks and created the renowned Eagle Point Park there. He returned to Chicago in 1936 to join the Chicago Park District as a landscape designer. It was during this period that he worked out the design for Promontory Point and planned the Lily Pool and Rookery in Lincoln Park. lo the course of this work he met Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who later played a major role in the evolution of Caldwell's-career.\n\nCaldwell left the Park District to join the U.S. War Department in 1940 and worked as a civil engineer on the design and construction of several military training posts. At the end of the war, Mies called upon Caldwell to join the architecture faculty at the Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1945 IIT awarded\n\nCaldwell a Bachelor of Science degree in Architecture and, in 1948, a Master of Science degree in City Planning. His major collaborative work with Mies was as the landscape designer for the UT campus. He abruptly resigned from IIT in 1960 in protest of Mies' ouster as official architect of the school.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1964 Caldwell was employed by the Chicago Planning Commission. He returned to higher education as a Visiting Professor at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1965 and later that year was appointed Professor of Architecture at the University of Southern California, retiring in 1973. He maintained a private practice until 1981 when he rejoined IIT as the Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Professor of Architecture. Proclaimed the last of the Prairie School landscape architects, he died at his home in Bristol, Wisconsin in 1998.\n\nCaldwell's plans for the landscaping of PromontoryPoint were very precise. Each tree and shrub was carefully located and designated by its proper Latin. name. Not usually recognized is that his plans included not only the area popularly considered the Point, that is, the land east of the South Outer (Leif Ericson) Drive at 55th Street, but also the park areas on the west side of the Drive from about 5450 to\n\n5555 South Shore Drive. Parenthetically, it is at 5530- 32 South Shore Drive that the Mies designed, and aptly named, Promontory Apartments now stands.\n\nAlthough many changes in the landscaping in this area have occurred since Caldwell's day, a few trees surviving from his original planting some 65 years ago can still be found, the largest number of them probably along South Shore Drive. The lake has undermined\n\nthe base of the limestone revetment around the Point to the extent that, at some spots, gaps large enough to\n\nswallow a small child have emerged between some of the seawall's stone blocks. llli1\n\nSources on Caldwell: The standard source, including an extensive bibliography, is Dennis E.

From anywhere on the south side one may mount his horse or enter his carriage for a turn of fifteen or twenty miles on what is equivalent to a country'road, that is to say, an English country road.\n\nOn the lake side of the park are the grounds of the Washington Park Racing club, with a splendid track and stables and other facilities which, I am told, exceed anything in the country of the kind. The clubhouse itself is very handsome and commodious, is open to members and their families summer and winter, and makes a favorite rendezvous for that pare of society which shares its privileges. Besides its large dining and dancing halls, it has elegant apartments set apart for ladies. In winter its hospitable rooms and big wood fires are very attractive after a zero drive.\n\nThe city is rich in a few specimens of private houses by Mr. Richardson ...so simple so noble, so full of comfort, sentiment, unique, having what may be called a charming personality.

Treffman\n\nContributingEditor\n\nThe articles that appeared in the Spring and Summer, 1997 issues of Hyde Park History on an earlier occupant of the building in which the\n\nHyde Park Historical Society's headquarters are now housed continue to attract attention. As you may remember, Alta Blakely reported on \"Steve's Lunch,\" a small restaurant run by Greek immigrant Steve Megales that occupied these premises beginning around, it was thought, 1948. A very interesting letter has recently arrived that provides insights into an even earlier period in the history of the building.\n\nThe letter, which appears on page 10, is from the granddaughters of Turney Keller, the man who, they report, converted what was a cable car waiting room into other uses. Mary Belle Keller Johnson and Judy Keller Levatino tell us chat, from as early as 1898 until 1952, the building was operated as a short order restaurant by the Keller family. Prior to 1898, they say, the building was used as a warming room for \"trolley personnel.\" When placed within the context of the development of Hyde Park's public transportation systems, this new information adds greatly to our knowledge of the history and uses of our building.\n\nCHICAGO STREET TRANSPORTATION ORIGINS\n\nIn the early years of Chicago's history, travel about the city's streets was accomplished on foot, by horseback or by horse and carriage. The latter could be hired with driver by the day or by the mile in cabs called hackneys or hacks. Omni buses, large horse drawn or enclosed wagons with seating for multiple passengers, first appeared on Chicago streets on regular schedules in 1850. The introduction of street rail transportation in the city, however, began nearly 141 years ago when a horse drawn car line began operations on April 25, 1859. It was built by the privately owned Chicago City Railway Company\n\n(CCR), which had been awarded the city's franchise for the South Side of the city. Two other companies held franchises for the city's north and west sides. The CCR cars ran on rails along State Street from Madison\n\nStreet to 12th Street (now Roosevelt Road). In the\n\nmonths following, the company built an extension of the line first to 22nd Street (now Cermak Road), then eastward down 22nd Street to Cottage Grove Avenue and, finally, from Cottage Grove to 31st Street. The immediate goal of these extensions was to provide transportation to the Illinois State Fair, which, in the fall of 1859, was located on land along Cottage Grove. The major advantage of using rails (originally wooden beams wrapped in iron sheetmetal) for hauling wagons with passengers was that the rails provided smoother, more comfortable and faster transportation than could be obtained from wheels rolling over the irregular unpaved roads of the time. Basic street car fares of a nickel a ride were sec by city ordinance in 1859 and kept at that same level until 1919.\n\nThe demands and opportunities of population growth and commercial and industrial development in the city and its suburbs encouraged expansion of the CCR. The increase in the number of cars, horses and track owned and maintained by the CCR grew exponentially, as did ridership. In 1859, for example, the company consisted of only four cars and twenty­ five horses operating at twelve minute intervals on about three miles of track and carried many tens of thousands of passengers a year. Annual ridership rose to 3.5 million only three years later. By 1867 the CCR owned fifty-three cars and 375 horses, employed 198 men and operated over 12. 5 miles of track. The number of passengers that year totaled more than five million. Six years later, in 1873, the CCR was running seventy-five cars and 600 horses operating at four minute intervals on twenty-three miles of track and was transporting at least six million riders a year. Only seven years later, at the end of 1880, the system had more than doubled in size to 46.679 single track miles traversed by a fleet of 292 cars and 1,468 horses. In short, in that twenty year period, from 1859 to 1880, the company experienced growth that involved 15 .6 times more track, 58.7 times more horses, and 73 times more cars carrying many millions of passengers annually!\n\nAs the CCR expanded the length of its horse carlines to meet demand, problems of keeping its system coordinated and its costs under control grew apace. The cars and rails, once installed, had long lives and were relatively inexpensive to keep up. Aside from the investment in manpower and supervision, the key variable in the cost of operating the system was the care and feeding of the horses. Although perhaps one or two horses might draw one car, they could only work four or five hours a day. This meant chat shifts of fresh horses had to be kept on hand for each horsecar in order to maintain a twelve or sixteen hour a day schedule. An entire system of men and equipment had to be developed around simply sustaining the horses. Moreover, the horse was relatively slow, not always reliable, susceptible to disease, and, glaringly apparent co one and all, associated with a \"residue\" on the streets chat raised public health concerns. One horse could produce as much as twenty-two pounds of manure a day. Its required disposal, in fact, actually became an ancillary business undertaking. All in all, then, there were problems associated with a large-scale system of horse drawn passenger cars chat were well recognized fairly early. This didn't mean that the CCR stopped building horse lines, only that its management was open to the idea of finding alternative forms of power to pull its cars. As it happened, Hyde Park would become the focus of the CCR's attention.\n\nHYDE PARK AND ITS STREETCARS\n\nThere is more co the early history of streetcars in Hyde Park than cable cars. After the Civil War, the city's horse car lines began to look beyond Chicago's borders for their growth. On March 5, 1867, the Chicago and Calumet Horse and Dummy Railroad Company (CCHDRC), an affiliate of the CCR, was incorporated under Illinois law to establish street rail lines for \"cars drawn by horses or cars with engines attached, commonly called dummy engines, for the carrying of passengers.\" Its focus of service was to be the area of Cook County south of the city's border at 39th Street and ease of State Street, in short, virtually the entire area of the Village of Hyde Park. A year later, in 1868, the Board of Supervisors for the Village of Hyde Park authorized this new CCR affiliate to lay tracks from 39th Street extending south from the CCR's preexisting tracks in Chicago proper.\n\nImplementing this resolution launched the robust\n\nexpansion of the CCR in succeeding decades.\n\nHORSE DRAWN CARS\n\nHyde Park's streetcar system apparently went through two phases prior to the introduction of the cable cars. The first of these, an unexpected finding, was that horse drawn streetcars seem to have run on rails down 55th Street in Hyde Park. A map that dates from chat period (Wright: 1870) specifically identifies a horse car line running down Cottage Grove from 39th Street and then swinging around to 55th Street east to what is now Lake Park Avenue.\n\nThis is, however, the only then contemporary source found so far chat suggests that a horse-drawn streetcar rail line ever existed along 55th Street. This line would have been pare of the expansion arising from that 1868 authorizing resolution. The CCR built tracks in Chicago further south primarily along Scace Street and Cottage Grove Avenue to then unstated terminal points. In ensuing years, lines were built on ocher streets both ease and west of Cottage Grove with 47th and 63rd Streets becoming the major ease/west routes to southwest Chicago. All of these new CCR streetcar lines were powered solely by horses. Thus was established the early outlines of the course public transportation would ultimately cake on the South Side of Chicago.\n\nTHE STEAM DUMMY\n\nThe reference to steam driven rail cars on city streets in the CCHDRC incorporation papers indicate chat replacing horse drawn street cars with an alternative system of motive power was already a possibility in the minds of the CCR's management at least as early as 1867. The usefulness of steam driven technology in manufacturing and, especially, in interurban rail transport was already well established throughout the country. In fact, a steam driven streetcar is said to have operated along Broadway on Chicago's north side as early as 1864. Ac some point after 1867 the CCR and its affiliate decided to introduce them in their system, not in the city itself but in and around Hyde Park. Assuming that a horse drawn line initially ran along Cottage and down 55th Street, this steam dummy would have been the second phase in the development of public streetcar transportation in the community.\n\nWhile there is no question that steam driven streetcars chugged down Cottage Grove and 55th Street, there remains much that is unclear about their actual history. No picture of one, for example, has yet surfaced. The Hyde Park-Kenwood National Bank published a booklet in 1929 with a photograph purportedly that of Hyde Park's steam dummy.\n\nResearch, however, has revealed that the photograph is actually of an engine from an entirely different Chicago streetcar company. While the exact dimensions of the Cottage Grove/Hyde Park steam dummy are not known, information about similar vehicles from that period suggests what the one used in Hyde Park probably was like.\n\nCommonly, to minimize terrorizing horses along the street, these small locomotives were built within frames chat resembled a shortened version of a regular horse drawn trailer. The car would have run on four wheels with probably no more than seven feet from the middle of the front wheels to the middle of the ones in the rear. Likely, it was operated by a two-cycle engine powered by steam from a vertical boiler heated by burning anthracite coal or coke to minimize smoke and soot. The engine carriage was designed ostensibly to muffle the noise of escaping steam and engine operation by means of shielding and roof top steam condensers. It was this latter characteristic, the reduction of noise, as well as the horse car appearance, that provided the underlying meaning to the name \"dummy engine,\" that is, silent or \"dumb,\" as in \"unable to speak.\" These small locomotives pulled no more than one or two passenger trailers along the three miles of stronger steel track installed on Cottage Grove from 39th Street to 55th Street and east to Lake Park Avenue. When not in use, these engines and their trailers were probably stored in a car barn at 38th Street and Cottage, adjacent to the stables where the horses were kept. It is not known how many steam dummies operated on the Hyde Park\n\nline nor how their return runs were accomplished, that is, by reversing gears or being turned on a platform.\n\nAlso in question is the date when steam dummies were actually introduced into Hyde Park. Block (1977) offers the date of 1869 for that event and cites as her source Pierce (1940). Pierce, in tutn, makes reference only to the governing legal authorizations and to Weber (1936). Weber, however, fudges on the date by noting those 1868 actions by the Village Board permitting the building of street rails in Hyde Park but not when the actual construction took place. As was earlier suggested, operating on that Cottage Grove/5 5th Street line in 1869 may have been a horse line rather than a steam dummy, two very different forms of power. At another extreme is a photograph from a 1943 collection at the Chicago Historical Society with a caption stating that a steam driven street car began running in Hyde Park in 1881. Indeed, a map dated 1881 in Bluestone (1991) clearly denotes a steam line running down Cottage Grove and turning east at 55th Street to Lake Park but this does not preclude the possibility that steam dummies were running there before 1881. Moreover, this would have been precisely the time that CCR officials were already planning to replace horse cars and steam dummies with cable cars. A more persuasive date emerges from an unpublished street transportation chronology developed in 193 3 now in the collection of the Chicago Transit Authority. It places the introduction of the Hyde Park steam dummy in the year 1874.\n\nThis date seems in reasonable accord with the state of Hyde Park's development and the known history of the CCR. It would also fit with the presumption that a horse car line preceded the steam dummy in time. Uncovering more substantial corroborating information in support of any one of these dates remains a challenge.\n\nUsually overlooked in the few references to this steam car is that of the almost 46 miles of Chicago City Railway Company track existing in 1881, only those three miles of track along Cottage and 55th, the Hyde Park line, were used for steam driven streetcars. These steam dummies may have been an attempt by the CCR to compete directly with the Illinois Central's steam locomotives chat ran along the lake. The one-way nickel fare for a streetcar ride was half chat for a commute downtown from 55th Street on the Illinois Central but it was a much slower trip. In addition, these engines may have been considered somewhat more fitting, modern and substantial for\n\nthe prestigious community they served. Hyde Park's Trustees, recognizing the mess that accompanied horse drawn streetcars, may even have insisted on steam power. It was also on this portion of the line that the streets were paved with granite to support the heavier rails and engines required by the steam dummy. As a result, these were among the better-paved roads in the city and its suburbs.\n\nUnfortunately, street locomotives produced a good deal more noise than advertised, frightening horses and annoying pedestrians. Worse, for a variety of reasons, street car companies found chat these steam dummy cars proved to be no less expensive to operate than had been the horse cars. CCR managers were spurred to look at another alternative, one being developed in California. The days of the Hyde Park steam dummy engines were numbered. The last one to run its route did so early in 1887.\n\nTHE CABLE CAR\n\nIn the early 1870s Andrew S. Halladie, a wire manufacturer in California, developed a system wherein passenger cars ran up and down the hilly streets of downtown San Francisco on rails by means of a moving cable buried under the streets. It began operations in 1873 and its success spurred further expansion there throughout the '70s. Chicago City Railway officers, alerted to that success, traveled to San Francisco in 1880 to study its cable system.\n\nRealizing that if a system like that could operate on such variable terrain, it would probably work especially well upon the gentler topography of Chicago. They returned home and Charles B. Holmes, CCR's president, quickly obtained approval of the company's board and Chicago's city council to begin establishing cable car transport along many of the same Chicago streets on which they had run their horse cars.\n\nConstruction began in June, 1881 and by January, 1882, the CCR formally introduced cable cars into Chicago's public transportation system, the second such system in the United States. The first trains, usually consisting of a grip car and one or two trailers, ran on the State Street line; a second line was established on Wabash Avenue. These downtown cable cars traveled over a turnaround that went from State Street to Wabash Avenue via Lake Street and\n\nMadison Street, a layout that Hilton (1954) and others have insisted first gave the \"Loop\" its name not, as is often assumed, the elevated train loop which came later.\n\nThe Wabash/Cottage Grove horse car line was converted in 1882 to cable car use from Madison Street to 39th Street. In 1887, the Cottage Grove line was extended from 39th to 67th Street and 55th Street was converted to cable use. In 1890, after the annexation of Hyde Park, the Cottage Grove cable car system was extended south to 71st Street, the building. In fact, there may have been no thought the Midway. The Hyde even given to constructing such a building in the first Park/5 5th Street line was place.

Electric splicing together the two ends of the new line. lines, as well, were just being introduced. By 1895,\n\nThe impact of the cable car line on the economy of Chicago's streets, particularly in the downtown area, Hyde Park was immediate. The Economist (Chicago) for were filled with a melange of streetcars, some powered December 8, 1888 reported: \"The development for by horses, others by cables, and still others by business purposes of Fifty-Fifth Streec... has been electricity.

There were an estimated 120,000 horses in millions of visitors. Cable cars offered close access to Chicago in 1895. Though fading rapidly from use\n\nthe Fair'sentrancesat57thStreetand,onCottage,ataftertheturnofthecenturyaspowerforcity streetcars and fire engines, they remained important in the city's private transportation system well into the present century for recreational use and for hauling delivery wagons. Some of our readers may still remember the horse drawn wagons in Hyde Park that delivered ice and fresh vegetables to people's homes. A painting at our headquarters portrays an old horse drawn milk wagon that once operated in Hyde Park. The wagon stood abandoned for many years east of the IC tracks at 57ch Street.\n\nIN CLOSING\n\nWhile the street cable car today is often viewed merely as a quaint relic of the past, the scuff of charm bracelets, toys, advertising gimmicks and assorted other memorabilia usually associated with San Francisco, it has a quite legitimate and notable role in American, Chicago and, certainly, Hyde Park history. The story of the cable car in Chicago is most obviously tied to the evolution of public transportation and residential, industrial and commercial development in the city, in general, and to Hyde Park and its nearby suburban neighbors, in particular, both before and after annexation. Moreover, it provided the public access to the South Park system and may well have been a factor in establishing some of its boundaries. In essence, the horse-drawn and later the cable car performed the same function for these areas that the Illinois Central Railroad commuter line had played initially in the emergence of Hy"
