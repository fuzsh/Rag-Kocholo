        "text": "Obituary of Arthur R. Szeglin\n\nArthur R. Szeglin, 88, of Summerland Key, Florida, and Kings Park, New York, passed away peacefully at his home on August 8, 2023. Loving husband of Gladys (Wagner). Cherished father of Charles (Suzanne) Szeglin, Donna (Donald) McNaughton, John (Linda) Szeglin, Ronald (Jennifer) Szeglin, Beth (Michael) Theofield, and Michael (Sue) Szeglin. Dear grandfather of Bryan (Anna) Szeglin, Justin (Olivia Levine) Szeglin, Amelia Szeglin, Caitlin McNaughton, Janine (Christian) Lopez, Caroline (A.J.) Quackenbush, Aidan McNaughton, Artyom Szeglin, Angela (Josue Valladares) Szeglin, Atessa Szeglin, Julia (Cooper) Bower, Emma Theofield, Carly Theofield, and Logan Theofield. Adored great-grandfather of Lillianna Valladares, and two great-grandchildren on the way. Predeceased by his parents (Elizabeth and Andrew Szeglin), his brothers (Gerard, Dennis, and Andrew), and his sister-in-law Joan (Wagner) Matthews. Beloved brother-in-law of George Matthews and sister-in-law of Lorraine (Zombek) Szeglin. Arthur was a first generation immigrant born to Hungarian parents. He was born on Long Island, where his family farmed, raised chickens and four boys. Arthur’s parents were immensely proud of their heritage as well as their chosen home in America, a trait that Arthur carried with him throughout his life. Condensing Arthur’s tremendous intellectual achievements to a small obituary becomes difficult as Arthur was a lifelong student. He graduated from Hempstead High School in 1952 where he was class president, captain of the wrestling team and a varsity football and track athlete. He attended Princeton University on the Harold Imbrie Memorial Scholarship and received a Princeton Athletics Letter in 1956. His educational achievements include, but are certainly not limited to: a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, an M.B.A in Mechanical Engineering and Business Administration from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, an M.A. From Hofstra in 1983, an M.A. in Human Resources and Management from NYIT, a Ph.D. from Hofstra in 1988 in Psychology, a Ph.D. in Coastline Engineering from Stony Brook University in 2000. Arthur’s fascination with academia and using his immense knowledge to solve the world’s problems continued until the present, as he was studying at the College of the Florida Keys to achieve a certificate as a Tropical Ornamental Mariculture Technician, which relates to the use of fish farming and marine sciences to solve global hunger crises. He was an author and a co-author of numerous scholarly articles and technical manuals in engineering, and a holder of numerous patents that still influence how the world works today. In his spare time, he discovered a non-planetary object on April 17, 2001 as a part of the LOENOS Project, while an advisor on the board of the Lowell Observatory. He was a dedicated teacher to his family and anyone lucky enough to be in his presence, including an official stint as an Associate Adjunct Professor at NYIT. Arthur spent much of his career at KINEMOTIVE Corporation, an Aerospace company. He started as a janitor and eventually became President and majority owner of the corporation. A patron of many charitable organizations, as an uncommonly generous man. A dedicated patron of the arts, Arthur supported organizations including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Opera, and the Tennessee Williams Theater in Key West. Arthur personally funded and supported with his time numerous educational endeavors in Florida including serving as a Director at Big Pine Elementary charter school in Florida. He has served terms on the Board of MOTE Marine Laboratory and Aquarium in Florida, and the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. 25 years ago, Arthur and his “honey”, Gladys Szeglin, built their version of paradise in Summerland Key. Arthur and Gladys spent their time hosting all kinds of people at their home, as Arthur loved learning about people and making them feel welcome in the beautiful home he and his honey had created. He was a kind, generous, one of a kind man who will be deeply missed. They truly broke the mold with our Arthur. Visitation will be Tuesday, 2-5 P.M. & 7-9 P.M. at Nolan Funeral Home. Funeral will be held Wednesday 10:30 AM at the Commack United Methodist Church, 486 Town Line Road, Commack, NY. Cremation will be private. In lieu of flowers, donations in Arthur's memory to Tunnel to Towers Foundation https://t2t.org/donate, would be appreciated."
