        "text": "By Reader Submitted\n\nThomas Arthur Wagner\n\nof Silverdale\n\nMay 9, 1935\n\nto Sept. 2, 2009\n\nTom Wagner of Silverdale was born in Berwyn, IL and graduated from Hinsdale High where he was named all conference football tackle, and participated in the State Wrestling Tournament.\n\nHe received a BS in Agriculture from the University of IL and was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and the University of IL wrestling team. It was there that he met and married Sheila Godfrey, his wife of 53 years.\n\nAfter college, the family moved to Ohio where Tom worked for Opekasit, Farm Management Co. then Kroger. He went to night school to receive his MBA from the University of Cincinnati. The family increased when four children were born in Hamilton, Ohio. In 1967 he joined Ocean Spray Cranberries and was plant manager in the Kenosha, WI at the age of 31. He was promoted to Area Manager in 1975.\n\nThe family moved to Aberdeen, WA until 1980 when he received another promotion and they moved back to Libertyville, IL. After 25 years of service, he retired as Senior Vice President for Ocean Spray Cranberries.\n\nUpon retiring from Ocean Spray, he felt life had been good and wanted to give back in a third world country, so he and Sheila moved to Poland for 2 years to participate in a program established by the U.S. Congress to improve the economies of developing nations.\n\nWhen they returned from Poland, Sheila and Tom moved to Silverdale. Tom was a member of the Silverdale Rotary Club. He was named Rotarian of the Year in 1999 after working tirelessly on the fairgrounds playground and serving as the RAGS Chairman for the Silverdale Club.\n\nHe was a private pilot but also enjoyed hiking, skiing, boating, scuba diving, and all types of woodworking. But most of all he was a devoted father and family was always his first priority.\n\nTom is survived by Sheila, his wife of 53 years. His sons Michael of Seattle, Don (Linda) of Los Gatos, CA and Gary (Jennifer) of Blaine, MN, daughters Karen (Ed) Anderson of Aberdeen and Kathryn (Wayne) Parsley of Everett as well as sister Ann (Larry) Inderbitzin of Middleburg, PA. A brother Dr. Philip Wagner of Roseburg, OR preceded him in death. He was the proud grandfather of 14 grandchildren."
