        "text": "AIKEN, SC - Barbara Jean Kiecker Wagner born December 24, 1944 went to be with our Lord on August 4, 2022.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her sister, Karen Kiecker Wagner, brother David Kiecker, her parents, Arnold and Jean Kiecker, her grandson Brandon and her beloved husband James Arthur Wagner. She is survived by her sister Sandy Thornton, brothers Tom, Jim and John. Her 3 children and spouses Leanne & Jay Mankus, J. D. & Wendy Wagner, and Laura & Michael Klecker. Grandchildren Lyndsey LeBron, James & Emma Mankus, Sophie Wagner, Daniel Mankus, Jack Wagner, Lydia Mankus and Annie Grace Klecker, and great-grandson Joe Hogle.\n\nBarb was DIY before that was a thing. Barb allowed her kids to dream and she followed as a quiet supportive cheerleader. Barb was not the gregarious person Jim was but she was the foundation and support behind him. She impacted many lives by just being present. These last 20 months she spent in Aiken South Carolina on Hospice in Laura and Michael’s home. This time was a gift because Barb felt loved and cared for as the treasure she was. She was the boss. Her steadfast love of family and stoic personal faith was built from a legacy of German Lutherans and continue to ripple through the generations.\n\nOpportunities for Celebration of Barb's life will be in three locations at the following times; Celebration of life on Friday, August 12 at 137 Vivion Drive Aiken, South Carolina from 5-7 pm Dinner will be provided.\n\nService is in Illinois on August 26 at St. John’s Lutheran Church 300 Jefferson St. Algonquin, IL 60102 doors open at 10, service at 11 am Pastor Shalk presiding followed by a luncheon.\n\nOn Saturday, August 27 at 10 am she will be buried with her husband James Wagner at Union Cemetery in Fort Atkinson WI with family in attendance. We are honoring Jim's brother Richard Wagner (Dick) from Oregon, who also passed recently and will be laid to rest there as well.\n\nIn lieu of flowers please: Send checks to Bethlehem Lutheran Church, 902 Hitchcock Drive Aiken, SC 29803. Where Pastor John Engwall came to the house and prayed with her (and us) weekly. Or give to St. Matthew Lutheran Church of Barrington, IL, her home congregation for 50 years, https://onrealm.org/stmatthewbarrington/-/form/give/now.\n\nSHELLHOUSE-RIVERS FUNERAL HOME, INC., 715 E. PINE LOG RD., AIKEN, SC 29803\n\nTo order memorial trees or send flowers to the family in memory of Barbara Jean Wagner, please visit our flower store."
