        "text": "A quick look around the office of Susan Wagner head football coach Arthur Newcombe reveals nothing out of the ordinary. There are plaques, awards, photos of former players and game balls from momentous wins by former Falcons’ coach Al Paturzo. Nothing that you wouldn’t expect to see in the office of any high school mentor until your gaze falls to the baseball on his desk.\n\nAt first glance, the ball seems out of place among all the gridiron memorabilia. That is, until you notice that the ball is signed by former Brooklyn Dodger, Don Newcombe, and the coach explains that the Hall of Famer was his grandfather’s cousin.\n\n“I met him just once,” said Arthur. “It was at a baseball card show when I was about four years old. I remember how big he was. He was huge. When he signed the ball, my dad told me, ‘that’s Grandpa’s cousin.’”\n\nNewcombe notes that the ball is a little yellow and sheepishly admits that he didn’t always realize its value. “I may have taken it out and played with it a few times,” he recalled. “It was a little bit of a Sandlot situation.”\n\nAs a youngster, Arthur knew little more than Don’s stats as a player. That would soon change.\n\n“It wasn’t until I got to high school, when some teachers learned of the connection and told me stories that I realized how important his career was,” said the New Brighton resident of his second cousin. “That was when I realized what an impact he has.”\n\nWhile the Dodgers’ ace, who died in 2019, made his mark on a national stage, becoming the first player ever to win the Cy Young and MVP awards in the same season (1956), the Newcombes of West Brighton were making their own impact on their community.\n\n“My grandparents were incredibly involved in community service,” said Arthur. “My grandfather, Arthur Sr., was that guy who was always there. My dad, Arthur Jr., instilled that same idea in me and my siblings. He coached, he ran the community center; he treated everyone like family.”\n\nApparently, Arthur took his father’s example to heart. After graduating from Susan Wagner, he played two seasons as a defensive back at Union College before transferring home to St. John’s. He then attended Hofstra Law where he received his Juris Doctor, passed the bar and went to work in the offices of Children’s Services. In 2012, he returned to Wagner as a teacher before becoming the head football coach.\n\nProud of the fact that his second cousin was just the fourth black player in the Major Leagues, Newcombe is very much aware of his own calling.\n\n“I’m so happy to see that coaches of color are becoming more prominent,” said Newcombe. “Not just as assistants, but as head coaches as well. I was so happy for Tressor (Baptiste) when he got the job at St. Joseph by-the-Sea last year. He deserves to be a head coach and he’ll do a great job.”\n\nAlong those lines, Newcombe has done a wonderful job with his own program.\n\n“I was very proud of our kids this year,” he said. “They were 5-5 and made the playoffs after struggling mightily over the last few seasons. I’m so happy for them, especially the seniors.”\n\n“Our staff does a great job, too,” he continued. “As hard as we work with the kids as players, we’re even more focused on preparing them for their post-secondary school experiences. Whether it be college, military service or the workforce, we want them to be prepared to excel.”\n\nSo, just maybe, the object in Newcombe’s office that seems out of place is, actually, the most appropriate piece in the room, as it links generations of a family who spent their lives changing for the better the world they touch."
