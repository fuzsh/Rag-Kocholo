        "text": "IMAGE\n\nA Journal of the Arts and Religion\n\nsummer 1995\n\nRUPERT MARTIN\n\nRoger Wagner's\n\nVisionary Landscapes\n\nTHE story begins at the monastery of San Marco in Florence, where Fra\n\nAngelico prayed and painted. Walking up the stairs you are confronted\n\nby an angel with multicolored wings, announcing momentous news to\n\nMary. Further on you come to the individual cells in which you can seclude\n\nyourself. Each cell contains a frescoed wall painted by Fra Angelico to aid the\n\nmonks' prayers. You are alone in a landscape in which Jesus comes and goes, as\n\nif entering the very place where you sit and contemplate. For English artist\n\nRoger Wagner these rooms have a special place in his life as artist and Christian.\n\nThey embody an ideal space in which art and the everyday meet, where the\n\nworlds of prayer and art overlap. At the place where they meet is the person of\n\nJesus, apprehended by faith at the intersection of time and eternity. Wagner's\n\nvisits to San Marco in 1973 and 1978 proved formative for his faith and his art,\n\nand his early paintings reflected the ordered world of Fra Angelico, with its\n\nformal clarity, translucent color and atmosphere of prayer.\n\nIn his recently printed work. The Book of Praises, Wagner seeks to create an\n\nequivalent to the experience of walking from cell to cell in the monastery of San\n\nMarco. Each page becomes a self-contained unit in which one can immerse\n\noneself in the text and image as in a cell. This work is characteristic of the\n\nthoroughness with which Wagner approaches any project. He began by learning\n\nHebrew, translating the Psalms into a fresh idiom, and then engraving woodcuts\n\nplaced between the Hebrew and English texts, in a way that varies from page to\n\npage. The woodcuts act as a focus for our reflections on the Psalms, and remind\n\nWagner of the Bibles of the Reformation with their combined use of type and\n\nwoodcuts. Wagner's work also belongs to the English tradition which includes\n\nthe woodcuts which Paul Nash carved to illustrate the book of Genesis, as well\n\nas William Blake's woodcuts to illustrate Thornton's translation of Virgil's\n\nEclogues which so inspired the nineteenth-century painter Samuel Palmer.\n\nHaving studied at Oxford and lived there for the last twenty years, Wagner\n\nhas had ample opportunity to look closely at the jewel-like pen-and-ink\n\nlandscapes by Palmer which are displayed in Oxford University's Ashmolean\n\nMuseum, and it was entirely fitting that Wagner recently held a major exhibition\n\nin that museum. Palmer's pastoral vision was of a world replete with fruitfulness,\n\na Keatsian overabundance that reflected his faith in God's providence. The\n\nidyllic days Palmer spent at the southern English village of Shoreham fueled his\n\nimagination to recreate its humble valley as the Valley of Vision, with its\n\nrounded hills, ripe crops, and little shady dells glimmering with light. As we shall\n\nsee, Wagner's pastoral vision is not so idyllic, but traces of Palmer's lyrical vision\n\nremain in the way Wagner sees landscape as the mirror of God's glory, the place\n\nwithin which He works out His redemptive purposes.\n\nIn Roger Wagner's work, several strands merge: the Renaissance, the pastoral,\n\nEnglish landscape and poetry, and Christian biblical meditation. As he has\n\nprogressed as an artist he has often interwoven these different strands and\n\ntechniques. A good example of this process is the painting entitled The Harvest\n\nIs the End of the World and the Reapers Are Angels.\n\nThe image came to him when he was an Oxford undergraduate studying\n\nEnglish. At that time he was torn between his desire to study art and the need to\n\nfinish the course he had begun. During his final year he impulsively decided to\n\ngive up English and. begin art studies. After a week he was dissuaded and went\n\non to take a first class honors degree in English literatureÃ¢ÂÂthe highest result\n\nthat one can achieve at Oxford University. It was only after he had spent the\n\nnext three years studying at the Royal Academy of Art, London, that he felt he\n\nhad acquired sufficient technical expertise to enable him to tackle the theme of\n\nangels reaping. Even then he destroyed the first version, feeling that it was too\n\ngarish in color.\n\nThe key to the composition came to him after seeing a picture by Guercino\n\nwhich had a very dark sky. \"The more you can compose a picture, the more you\n\ncan subdue colors and the stronger the effect,\" Wagner says. By introducing a\n\ndark blue sky he not only increased the sense of impending doom, but he was\n\nalso able to contain the radiance of the central harvest-field and thereby control\n\nthe light. Roger made many drawings of the angels, for some of which this\n\nauthor served as a model. I remember standing for an hour in the position of a\n\nreaper with a sickle!\n\nThese drawings of angels were made into woodcuts and included in his first\n\nbook of poems, entitled Fire Sonnets published by the Besalel Press in 1984.\n\nThese poems have an unearthly quality that adds to the vision of angels reaping:\n\nthere are trees ablaze with angelic light, the angel wrestling with Jacob in the '\n\ndark, and Jesus stretching out his hand to Peter as he begins to walk on water.\n\nWagner's work constantly refers to the supernatural, and he depicts a world\n\nablaze with light, transfigured by the presence of God and his angels:\n\nAnd in that summer evening's fading light\n\nI saw his angels gather in the wheat:\n\nLike beaten gold their beauty smote the air\n\nAnd tongues of flame were streaming in their hair.\n\nOne hears echoes of the mystical poets Henry Vaughan and Thomas Trahern\n\nin these poems, and also in the visual imagery of the field of wheat, which is\n\nreminiscent of Traherne's vivid memory of childhood in his third Century.\n\nThe Corn was Orient and Immortal Wheat, which never\n\nshould be reaped, nor was ever sown. I thought it\n\nhad stood from Everlasting to Everlasting.\n\nWagner's field of grain is not, however, the endless vista of childhood\n\ninnocence, but the prospect of God's judgment on our completed lives. The\n\ntheme of judgment gives Wagner's pastoral painting its particular edge. Here is\n\nno sentimentalized landscape, but one fraught with doom, the Anglo-Saxon\n\nword for judgment. And yet it is an image of judgment far removed from art\n\nhistory's many grotesque herdings of human beings into the Pit. Wagner speak\n\nof the power of Michelangelo's Last Judgment, but says:\n\nI'm never entirely happy with such pictures. The emphasis on terror\n\nproduces a terrifying picture of God, who works just by fear. Although an\n\naspect of fear is appropriate, the emphasis in the New Testament is on the\n\njustice of God. Evil being destroyed is something we are encouraged to\n\nlong for.\n\nThe sense of judgment as something positive is reflected in the radiance oft!\n\nfield of wheat, and both the parable and the painting illustrate the possibility o\n\nredemptive love. His harvest field is intersected by two paths that in their\n\nshadowing reveal the cross, and the low angle of the sun causes tl ^ s'\n\nwings to cast winged crosses onto the wheat [see front cover]. Judgment\n\nbecomes a promise, an answer to the perennial question posed in the Psalms:\n\n\"Why do evil men seem to succeed?\"\n\nWagner has translated the classic themes of Renaissance art, redemption and\n\njudgment, into an idiom that is true to the English pastoral tradition and to hi\n\nimage of a loving and just God. Each element in this skillful composition\n\ncontributes tc the whole: the detailed flora of the foreground, the three\n\nsycamore trees, the stocks of cut wheat, the three angels choreographed in\n\ndifferent poses, the more distant angels, the intersecting paths leading the eye\n\ninward over the radiant wheat to the splendor of the magnificent oak which\n\nholds the composition in balance, the blue curving river, and the rising\n\ncrescendo of cumulus clouds highlighted by the setting sun against deep-blue\n\nthunder clouds. All these elements speak of one dramatic fact of faith, the\n\nsplendor and glory of God who is creator, redeemer, and judge. A vision of such\n\nsubdety and intensity took more than ten years in the making, and combines\n\ntechnical excellence with a visionary faith.\n\nThe influence of the Suffolk landscape near Aldeburgh, where Roger was\n\nbrought up, is evident in many of his paintings ; af which acts as a pendant\n\nto the angels reaping. Entitled Abraham and the Angels (1989), it shows\n\nAbraham picnicking with the angels among a group of pine trees. The gnarled\n\nbranch of a dead tree in the foreground and the looming presence of a nuclear\n\npower plant in the background provokes thoughts of impending catastrophe,\n\nsuch as God visited upon the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah immediately after\n\nHis angelic visitation with Abraham and Sarah (Gen. 18-19). One of the striking\n\naspects of Wagner's painting is this blend of biblical story and contemporary\n\niconography and landscape. His visualizing of past and present ends up\n\ntranscending particular time, creating a sense oftimelessness.\n\nWatching again the film by Andrei Tarkovsky which focuses on the icon\n\npainter Andrei Rublev, I was reminded how much an artist is called to be aware\n\nof his times and yet to transcend them. The film records the turbulence of\n\nfifteenth-century Russia and the cruelty of the Tartar invasions, showing the\n\npainter wandering through the landscape witnessing these events. That suffering\n\nis transmuted in the icons into a poignant compassion, a desire to reveal the\n\ntruth in eloquent forms, to set forth the glory of God in translucent layers of\n\ntempera on wood. The black-and-white film ends in color as the camera dwells\n\nlovingly on details of the icons for which Rublev is best known, including The\n\nTrinity, which shows the three angels that visited Abraham.\n\nTarkovsky's film also refers to the position and plight of the artist in a hostile\n\npolitical climate. Roger Wagner's own art have a prophetic edge similar to\n\nTarkovsky's, not hesitating to deal with unfashionable themes and to issue a\n\nsearching indictment of the values which dominate our materialistic society.\n\nTwo paintings of 1989 depict the Great Storm which had recently destroyed\n\nthousands of trees in the south of England. One is entitled See What Desolations^\n\nrefers to Psalm 46, in which the note of catastrophe is followed by a note of\n\nhope:\n\nCome and see the works of the Lord,\n\nthe desolations he has brought on the earth .\n\nHe makes wars cease to the ends of the earth;\n\nhe breaks the bow and shatters the spear,\n\nhe burns the shields with fire.\n\nBe still and know that I am God;\n\nI will be exalted among the nations,\n\nI will be exalted in the earth\n\nWagner's paintings, for all their vigor of composition, often possess that sense\n\nof stillness at the center of the storm, that idea of hope in the face of despair.\n\nThe light which bathes his wheat fields or is caught in the leaves of a tree has an\n\notherworldly quality, between day and night, and often accentuated by\n\ngathering clouds or deep blue skies. It is the kind of light I see from my window\n\nas I write, the low evening light of a winter afternoon revealing the greenness of\n\nthe lichen-encrusted oak trees, reflecting the whiteness of silver birches\n\nsilhouetted against a dark storm-cloud. Yet, in a Wagner painting there is a\n\nstrange stillness, as if nature is holding her breath, for that moment taken out of\n\ntime into eternity. It is the light of transfiguration which we are occasionally\n\nprivileged to glimpse on earth.\n\nTrees hold a special place in Wagner's imagination: the solitary oaks or clumps\n\nof pines in the flat Suffolk landscape, the tall black poplars arching over the river\n\nthat winds through Port Meadow near Oxford, the juniper trees of Delphi in\n\nGreece. In landscapes that are largely unpeopled, the trees act as metaphors of\n\nlife, either destroyed by storm, or filled with light. As Gerard Manley Hopkins\n\nwrote of the trees near Oxford in \"Binsey Poplars\":\n\nMy aspens dear, whose airy cages quelled,\n\nQuelled or quenched in leaves the leaping sun,\n\nAll felled, felled, are all felled;\n\nor in Traherne's words:\n\nThe Green Trees...Transported and ravished me; their\n\nSweetness and unusual Beauty made my heart to leap....\n\nthey were such strange and Wonderful things.\n\nFor Wagner, trees rustle with angels' wings and shimmer with the light of\n\nheaven; they represent both the transcendence and the immanence of God. His '\n\nown poetry shows how he sees the light and movement in the trees he has\n\ndepicted.\n\nWho hears the ocean roaring in a tree\n\nThat rustles like a thousand angels' wings\n\nAnd feels the rising wind he cannot see,\n\nIs seeing to the burning heart of things.\n\nWorking on blue paper, he has made a series of large single trees , '\n\nusing the same technique of pen and ink with gum arable that Samuel Palmer\n\nused for his tree-filled landscapes. These single trees show how much the\n\ndevelopment of Wagner's technique has helped to release his vision: they\n\ncombine a minute attention to the individual leaves with a broad sweep of\n\ncomposition and light.\n\nThe trees also show how much his art emerges out of his life and observation.\n\nBorn in 1957, Roger was encouraged to appreciate and study the arts by his\n\nfather. Sir Anthony Wagner, who was an expert on heraldry and who became\n\nGarter King of Arms at the College of Arms. Roger has inherited the meticulous\n\nattention to detail that characterizes his father's visual work, as well as his\n\nmother Gillian's interest in the art and culture of England. Dame Gillian Wagner\n\nbecame noted for her work in the field of voluntary and social work, becoming\n\npresident of Dr. Barnado's charity for children. She has also written books,\n\nincluding a biography of Dr. Barnado. The combination of this artistic and\n\nliterary backgroundÃ¢ÂÂas well as his forays into the Suffolk landscapeÃ¢ÂÂwere\n\nformative influences which he took with him to school at Eton College and then\n\nOxford University. At Eton the influence of the Robert Browning scholar and\n\nEnglish teacher Michael Meredith was particularly appreciated, especially during\n\nWagner's visits to Italy in 1973 and America in 1975.\n\nDuring the years that I have known him, Roger has shown a single-minded\n\ndedication and integrity in his life and work. I recall one example of this\n\nintegrity, when we were staying on the Greek island ofNaxos in 1977. He had\n\nspent hours painting a landscape, seated on a barren hillside in the heat of the\n\nday, but for various reasons he became dissatisfied with the picture and simply\n\nabandoned it c : hillside. Later that day we entered the local butcher's shop,\n\nwhere the butcher said that he had seen Roger painting, and asked whether it\n\nwould be possible to buy the painting. Roger said that, unfortunately, it wasn't\n\ngood enough, and even refused to let me go back and retrieve it from the\n\nhillside, so that we could supplement our dwindling resources!\n\nRoger Wagner is a painter of place as well as of visions, and he often chooses\n\nto locate biblical stories in familiar settings, placing the story of the burning fiery\n\nfurnace from the book of Daniel in Lucy's iron smelting works in Oxford. Not\n\nall his subjects are religious: \"God created the hippopotamus as well as the\n\nangels,\" he comments. \"I want to be free to paint every aspect of Creation.\" For\n\nthat reason he has not ignored the industrial landscape, seeing in it scope for\n\nmetaphor and transformation.\n\nIn 1988 he published a book of poems and engravings called In a Strange\n\nLand^ which includes images of the des ; - docklands of London seen in the\n\ncontext of Psalm 137 . Before they underwent their recent\n\nredevelopment, the London docklands were indeed a strange, almost surreal\n\nplace: derelict warehouses bordering little creeks, rusting cranes lying idle, empty\n\npiers that used to bustle with imperial trade. All of these things\n\ncompose a stark geometry, empty of people and activity, and reminiscent ofde\n\nChirico's metaphysical paintings of empty piazzas and colonnaded buildings.\n\nThe paintings on blue paper, in gouache, ink and watercolor mixed with gum\n\narabic, combine geometry and mystery, accurate observation with a sense of\n\nspiritual desolation, echoing the words of Psalm 137:\n\nBy the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept...\n\nHow can we sing the songs of the Lord in a strange land?\n\nThe docklands become a metaphor for the spiritual bankruptcy of a whole\n\nnation, for empty promises of materialism, and for the blight that affects the\n\ngrandest of human schemes, in the light of God's eternal plans. And yet there is\n\na poignant sense of elegy in these works, a transforming light that gives some\n\nsense of hopeÃ¢ÂÂas if nothing is wastedÃ¢ÂÂa sense that everything is beautiful in its\n\nown time and in its own way.\n\nAn elegiac note is also struck in one of Wagner's earliest compositions,\n\nentitled Ash Wednesday . In it, he has translated an enigmatic section\n\nfrom T. S. Eliot's Ash-Wednesday into pictorial form. The section begins:\n\nLady, three white leopards sat under a juniper-tree\n\nIn the cool of the day, having fed to satiety\n\nOn my legs my heart my liver and that which had been contained\n\nIn the hollow round of my skull. And God said\n\nShall these bones live?\n\nAs with many of his paintings, this one is a visual jigsaw, pieced together from\n\ndifferent places and visual experiences. The juniper tree was discovered at\n\nDelphi, and the broken columns drawn from a photograph which I took on the\n\nisland ofDelos, during our 1977 visit to Greece. The leopards were drawn from\n\nlife during several visit to London Zoo, the wheeling birds come from the\n\nSuffolk landscape, and the skeleton from a Renaissance painting by Vittore\n\nCarpaccio. The painting gives the effect of a heightened reality verging on the\n\nsurreal. The theme of the painting, as of Eliot's poem, concerns the hope of\n\nresurrection, even when confronted with the fact of death.\n\nThis concept of hope coming out of despair, of beauty in the apparently ugly,\n\nof the majesty of ordinary thingsÃ¢ÂÂwhether natural or architectural, man-made\n\nor God-madeÃ¢ÂÂis central to an epic series of paintings which Wagner embarked\n\non in the 1990s. As with the harvest paintings, there was a long period of\n\ngestation and several versions of the painting entitled Menorah.\n\nThe painting could be said to begin with the train journey from Oxford to\n\nLondon, which passes through Didcot. From the train the six-massive cooling\n\ntowers of the Didcot Power Station dwarf everything else. On one journey, the\n\nartist saw the smoke and steam pouring from these towers against an\n\nextraordinary sky. He made a sketch while on the train and then amplified it at\n\nhome. on another occasion, when we were visiting two hilltop clumps of beech\n\ntrees called Wittenham Clumps, which inspired some of Paul Nash's late\n\npaintings, I remember Roger turning his back on the beautiful trees to make a\n\nwatercolor of the power station with its great plumes of smoke shadowing the\n\nplain below. Wagner has acknowledged the influence of Paul Nash, especially his\n\nstylized landscapes. In this case the influence of Nash's war paintings with their\n\ndevastated woods and elegiac fury may have contributed to the vast, impersonal\n\nforces symbolized by Wagner's painting of the power station.\n\nThe sense of human vulnerability in the face of these mechanistic forces led to\n\nthe idea of placing a Crucifixion scene in the foreground. The first version was a\n\ndeposition with the figures who attend to and mourn for Christ dressed in the\n\nstriped uniform of the Death Camps and carrying the yellow Star of David. The\n\nplowed field is raked by the evening light, and the three crosses set at an angle to\n\nthe six cooling-towers belching steam and the central taller chimney emitting\n\nsmoke.\n\nThe chimney immediately brings to mind the crematoria chimneys of\n\nAuschwitz, but it was only later that the artist saw, in the six towers and one\n\nchimney, the symmetrical appearance of the seven-branched candelabrum, the\n\nmenorah, which is a central Jewish symbol of God's presence. This early version\n\nwas entitled Servant Song IV: Surely He Has Borne Our Griefs, referring to the\n\nmessianic prophecy of Isaiah 53. The connection of the Suffering Servant with\n\nthe suffering of the Jews in the concentration camps is a startling one, and raises\n\nthe central question in any attempt at theodicy: how can a God of Love allow\n\nsuch suffering? The question occurred in Auschwitz itself, as Elie Wiesel, an\n\nAuschwitz survivor, describes in his book Night.\n\nThe SS hanged two Jewish men and a youth in front of the whole camp.\n\nThe men died quickly, but the death throes of the youth lasted for half an\n\nhour. \"Where is God? Where is he?\" someone asked behind me. As the\n\nyouth still hung in torment in the noose after a long time, I heard the man\n\ncall again, \"Where is God now?\" And I heard a voice in myself answer:\n\n\"Where is he? He is here. He is hanging there on the gallows.\"\n\nAlthough seen by Elie Wiesel in the context of Judaism and of the humiliation\n\nof God in going with Israel into exile and suffering, for Christians this moving\n\nstory has a striking resonance. God was indeed there on the gallows, because\n\nJesus had gone through the same kind of gratuitous, cruel and prejudiced death\n\non the cross, not at the hands of Jews, but because of the sin of mankind as a\n\nwhole. The cross becomes the only answer we can give to the inescapable\n\nproblem of suffering, and it is not so much an answer as a demonstration of\n\nGod's love in suffering. As the German theologian Jiirgen Moltmann wrote in\n\nThe Crucified God: \"The Son suffers dying, the Father suffers the death of the\n\nSon.\"\n\nThe suffering of God, his identification with our suffering through the death\n\nof his Son, helps us to bear the terrible suffering which this century has\n\nwitnessed. Wagner is courageous enough as an artist and as a Christian to\n\nconfront this manifestation of evil and yet to see the possibility of hope in the\n\nstark landscape of grief.\n\nThe elegy of the first version gives way to a more tragic vision of crucifixion in\n\nthe second version, painted in 1993 [see Plate 5]. Jesus is naked on the cross,\n\nthe thieves on either side. The plowed field is flooded, reflecting the cooling\n\ntowers which loom even closer than before, in a more sinister way. The\n\nonlookers, dressed in Hasidic clothes, gather and drift, seeking comfort,\n\npointing in silent witness, or simply standing, desolate, inconsolable in their\n\nisolated grief.\n\nThe composition of some of the figures has a revealing source: a photograph\n\ntaken by Dmitri Baltemants in the Crimea in 1942, which shows women\n\nlooking for their loved ones among the bodies which lie strewn across a bleak,\n\nsmoke-filled landscape. This haunting photograph of grief shows one woman\n\nstooped in despair as she searches, and another with arms flung out in a gesture\n\nof despair. The words of Jesus on the cross ec'; i ; abandonment: \"My God,\n\nmy God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" And that cry was made by a Jew to the\n\nGod of the Jews.\n\nEmotions are stirred by such iconography, because the Jewish people suffered\n\npersecution in an ostensibly Christian culture. Christian anti-Semitism should\n\nlead to Christian repentance. And yet there is a glimmer of hope in the fragile,\n\nvulnerable body stretched upon the cross; as Christopher Miller has written in\n\nhis introduction to Wagner's retrospective exhibition at the Ashmolean\n\nMuseum:\n\nThe Jewish Christians at the foot of the cross lament the loss of all their\n\nhope; the intervention of God in their lives is apparently annihilated in\n\nChrist's death. The smoke that the Jews watch sweeping up into the clouds\n\n\"\"o^s the ashes carried by the wind over the bleak Polish plains. And a\n\nparallel is established. We are in the presence of the cross, but the six\n\ncooling towers and the central chimney make up the seven branches of the\n\nmenorah, the ritual candlestick which defines the holiness of the Jewish\n\nholy place and thus marks the presence of God. For Jews and Christians\n\nalike, the face of desolation wears another aspect, that of the presence and\n\nprovidence of God.\n\nThe promise of God's presence through suffering is sufficient. Political\n\nsolutions are no answer to the Final Solution. Moreover, the systematic\n\ndestruction of Jewish life and culture has been repeated in the horrors of Pol Po\n\nand the genocide of Rwanda. Wagner is proposing not a human, political\n\nsolution, but something that Christopher Miller has vividly described as a\n\n\"politics of transcendence\":\n\nIn the gloomy forms that preside in the painting's background, the colossal\n\nmechanisms of the state themselves achieve a status like that of destiny.\n\nChrist was crucified, if not at the state's behest, by the state.\n\nOur wildest dreams of horror have been eclipsed by the functioning of\n\nan industrial society which used its technology and organization to\n\nadminister a systematic death. Capitalist considerations played their part in\n\nthe functioning of Nazi and Stalinist death camps. The considerations\n\nwhich should determine conduct towards other humans were overlooked.\n\nThese are not simple implications, but they suggest how Wagner is able to\n\nbring to bear upon lives lived under the light of the electric filament a\n\npolitics of transcendence.\n\nWagner has the ability to bring together disparate elements of his experience\n\ninto an aesthetic whole, and to deal with profound themes in a fresh,\n\nchallenging way. To set a biblical scene in a contemporary landscape is not in\n\nitself unusual; it is a technique employed by other artists such as Stanley Spencer.\n\nBut grappling with the meaning of suffering by bringing together images of\n\ncrucifixion and holocaust shocks us out of our complacency. It takes courage\n\nand integrity to make such connections. It also takes faith to present the hope\n\nthat Wagner has, while not looking for easy answers.\n\nHis is also a visual solution: how to paint shadows, how to represent grief\n\nthrough gesture. His large compositions evolve slowly, as disparate elements\n\ncome together and as the paintings grow in complexity. \"Scale comes from the\n\nstrength of the idea and the composition,\" Wagner says. \"Too many large\n\npaintings are just inflated small ones.\" This is why he rarely works o; ' ge\n\nscale, preferring the intimacy and immediacy of small paintings on board, the\n\nsketch, or the woodcut. At the same time, he does not shy away from the\n\nchallenge of scale.\n\nRoger Wagner's most recent work consists of a series often paintings on the\n\ntheme of Job's encounter with the God of Creation. The plan is to exhibit these\n\nin the Bartlemas Chapel in South Oxford, which is all that remains of a medieval\n\nleper colony. As he explains:\n\nJob is the nearest the Old Testament comes to answering the question of\n\nsuffering. And the answer isn't in propositions. God doesn't explain but\n\nshows Job; he gives him a guided tour of Creation, at the end of which Job\n\nsays that he has seen GodÃ¢ÂÂand that for him is the answer, that is enough.\n\nFor Wagner, Creation represents God's glory, and Job's suffering is\n\ntranscended by seeing God and experiencing his love. As someone whose faith\n\nwas nurtured within the context or a charismatic, evangelical Anglican church in\n\nLondon, and who now worships in a Vineyard church in Oxford, Roger's\n\nexperience is of \"a God who is like the God we discover in the Bible, who does\n\nintervene in his world and who does miraculous and extraordinary things.\" But\n\nhis faith is also mature enough not to rely on the sensationalÃ¢ÂÂmature enough to\n\nlook for God's working in the small things and incidents of everyday life. His\n\npaintings embody that search for God in the simple fabric of Creation: ears of\n\ncorn, the trembling of leaves, the shimmer of water, as well as the simple\n\nrelationships shown in a tender touch. A particularly poignant little painting that\n\nhe keeps in his attic studio in Oxford is of his late father, blind at the time of the\n\npainting, tenderly holding his granddaughter in his arms.\n\nWagner is not afraid to grapple with issues of judgment and suffering, but his\n\ntheology is based on the all-sufficient love of God. Wagner's art embodies a\n\ntheology of grace as well as a theology of the cross. It's always interesting to see\n\nwhat painters choose to put on their walls. Alongside reproductions of Piero\n\ndella Francesca's The Resurrection of Christ, Botti Primavera and a\n\nJapanese woodcut, Wagner's study features Rembrandt's Prodigal Son. In this\n\npainting the touch of the Father, the poignant moment of reconciliation,\n\nexpresses all that Wagner believes and tries to embody in his art: the love flowing\n\nfrom God the Father being more than sufficient for the world we live in.\n\nRoger Wagner's version of the pastoral tradition contains the threat of danger,\n\nbut also the all-revealing light of love. Light is what ultimately reveals God's love\n\nboth literally and figuratively, whether it is the light flooding the plains of\n\nOxford, or streaming over the wheat fields of Suffolk, or filling the trees with\n\nangels, or turning the London docklands into a vast theater set. That light\n\nembodies the glory of God and his redeeming love."
