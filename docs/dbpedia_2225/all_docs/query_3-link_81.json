        "text": "Arthur Spielman was born in December 1928, in Krakow, Poland. He grew up in an Orthodox Jewish family with his father, Simon, mother, Czarna, and two sisters, Helen and Barbara. Arthur’s neighborhood in Kazimierz, Krakow was primarily Jewish. In 1939, the Nazi flag was raised at the Wawel castle marking a German victory, the invasion of Poland, and the beginning of World War II. The Germans declared Krakow as the designated capital of the General government. Hans Frank was appointed Governor-General and established his headquarters in the Wawel Castle, former home to Poland's royalty. The Nazi officials wished to remove Jews from the rest of the Polish society. After December 1939, Jews living in ghettos were required to wear identifying badges or armbands and a decree was issued requiring them to perform forced labor for the German Reich. Arthur, a young boy at the time, remembers being afraid to walk in the streets in fear of deportation.\n\nAlthough his family was not required to move into the Krakow ghetto due to his father’s status as an international diplomat, the Spielman family chose to move to live closer to their extended family. Within the Krakow ghetto, Arthur lived in a single apartment with his parents, sisters, and grandparents. In 1942, the Gestapo entered the ghetto and took Spielman's grandparents. Arthur never saw them again. Many of Arthur’s relatives were brutally murdered in the ghetto. Due to the escalating violence, Spielman's father moved the family to a secluded house outside of the ghetto. Soon after, the Spielman family was given a tip that life was going to get much worse in Krakow, so they left.\n\nArthur's father paid a man to take him and his sister Helen out of the ghetto into Slovakia and then Hungary, where they were placed in different orphanages. Later, his parents and youngest sister, Barbara, also fled to Hungary, where they reunited while visiting him in the orphanage. Arthur's father received word that the Nazis would be liquidating the orphanages, so he sent a Polish officer to release Arthur and his sister Helen. The officer approached Arthur and told him, \"Follow me. Don’t talk, don’t say anything, just follow me.\" His parents had papers as Christians, so he went to a Polish ministerial and said he was Roman Catholic to get his papers using the name of Nieczkowski in order to receive them. From Budapest, they went to Miskolc, another city in Hungary, and lived there as Gentiles for about a year.\n\nIn April 1944, the Nazis marched into Hungary. Arthur recalled, “Everything was happening very fast. We had some Jewish friends. We warned them to do something, go into hiding or run away. A lot of them did not believe the stories we were telling them about what happened in Poland, they didn't think what happened to the Polish Jews would happen to them. We saw people walking carrying their belongings. We ourselves went into hiding. We were afraid, so we didn't go out of the house. For a couple of weeks, every morning at like 10 o'clock in the morning sirens blew and there were planes over the city bombing the factory.\"\n\nHe recalled hiding out, only leaving when his mother sent him to the marketplace. Arthur said, \"We lived across from a marketplace which was huge. They mistook the town market for an army camp and dropped the bombs on the town market and a lot of people were killed.”\n\n\"Towards the end of the war before the Russians came in, we were hiding in the wine cellars, most people were hiding in wine cellars in Miskolc. There were bombs going back and forth. We didn't have much food then. I was standing in line at a bakery...a bomb hit and a few people got killed next to me. I slid into a basement, I don't know how I wound up there and I was saved by just a scratch. We stayed in the wine cellar for about six weeks, from October until we were liberated. We slept between barrels, big barrels with thousands of liters of wine. A lot of times we had no water to drink [so] we drank fresh wine. My mother cooked on a little furnace, gas stove, whatever she could make, soup blette, vegetables, fruit, meat, fish occasionally. We were very lucky in the city of Miskolc. We were hearing news from other people and propaganda papers. While we were in the wine cellar we heard cannons, shooting, then it quieted down...a few hours later first patrol, then half an hour later Russian soldiers on horses, then trucks and boogies filled with soldiers. They were coming by the thousands and then we realized we were liberated.” Arthur and his family left the cellar and returned to their apartment a few days later. He recalled his Hungarian neighbors were shocked when they found out Arthur’s family was Jewish. “A little later me and my father went to Krakow to Poland, by train. We walked part of the way over the mountains, went to see if there were any survivors.\" Tragically only two out of 300 family members survived. Arthur and his family lived for three years in Displaced Persons camps outside of Munich and immigrated to the United States in May 1949.\n\nArthur continues to share his story in hopes of preserving the significance of the Holocaust, encouraging meaningful conversations, and teaching respect and appreciation to younger generations. He has spoken at Susan E. Wagner High School, Port Richmond High School, Lavelle Prep Charter School, P.S. 19, Jewish Foundation School of Staten Island, Ben Porat Yosef in New Jersey, and at a 3GNY Descendants of Holocaust Survivors event. His message for the younger generation is simple - \"never forget.\""
