Their impact on Earlham has been profound and undeniable, as generations of Earlhamites have benefited from their guidance.\n\nRandall and Alice met at Earlham as students. Both Quakers and history majors with an interest in teaching, they graduated from Earlham in 1968. The pair then went on to earn their Ph.D.’s in 1973 and jointly applied for an open position at Earlham in the history department.\n\nRandall, whose focus was colonial and antebellum U.S. history, helped found Earlham’s Master of Arts in Teaching program.

She was also among the first Black women selected for the Biennale’s top honor, the Golden Lion Award.\n\nLeigh’s remarkable artistic journey included Earlham College, where she studied fine art and philosophy. She was also influenced by the College’s Quaker beliefs. In March 2022, The New Yorker published a story documenting Simone’s rise to fame and her introduction to working with clay on Earlham’s campus. “Earlham really saved me,” Leigh told The New Yorker. “Quakers believe that God is in everyone, and they respect people so much. It was ideal for me to be in the Quaker environment at that time.”\n\nLeigh’s art highlights the Black female experience. She creates objects and environments that question and reclaim stereotypes associated with Black women and celebrate Black life. Leigh’s work has been presented at museums, shows and venues for more than a decade. “Brick House,” Leigh’s towering 16-foot-tall bust of a Black woman, was the first art piece to be installed at New York’s High Line Plinth, a landmark destination for major public artworks on Manhattan’s west side.\n\nOutstanding Alumni Award\n\nMichael Merryman-Lotze ’99\n\nMichael Merryman-Lotze ’99 discovered his passion for human rights advocacy during his time at Earlham.

Johnson ’71\n\nSince graduating from Earlham, Peter V. Johnson ’71 devoted his life to the field of college admissions and the belief that everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue a quality education. Beginning his career at Earlham as a part of the Upward Bound program, Johnson went on to work for 10 years in residential life and admissions at Hampshire College. In 1982, he began a 35-year career at Columbia University, first as the assistant dean for student affairs and later as the director of enrollment group special projects and special assistant to the dean of undergraduate admission and financial aid.\n\nA contributing writer for The Multicultural Student’s Guide to Colleges: What Every African American, Asian-American, Hispanic, and Native American Applicant Needs to Know About America’s Top Schools, Johnson sought out and mentored under-resourced students throughout his career. As an inspirational speaker, he regularly visited high schools and community-based organizations across the country, and his life was featured in First Generation, a 2012 documentary about high-achieving, low-income students trying to be the first in their families to attend college. In 2014, he served as a judge for ABC’s “The Scholar,” a reality television show which offered college scholarships as prizes.

In the words of Jessica Marinaccio, dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid for Columbia College and the Fu Foundation of Engineering and Applied Science, “The number of lives that Peter has influenced and touched, however, far surpass those mere years—he was a mentor, guide, adviser, friend and stalwart educational leader in all he did.”\n\nOutstanding Alumni Award\n\nJessica Rettig ’91\n\nJessica Rettig ’91 is a dedicated teacher and scholar in the field of biology. As a full professor of biology at Denison University, Rettig is one of only two women full professors in the sciences at Denison.

After obtaining her Ph.D. in zoology and in ecology, evolutionary biology and behavior from Michigan State University in 1999, Rettig served as a visiting assistant professor at Earlham College and an assistant professor at William Jewell College.\n\nIn her current role at Denison she teaches in biology and Denison’s writing program, and also is the Anderson Endowment director and the coordinator of the Ronneberg Lecture Series. At Denison, Rettig has been instrumental in providing research support and opportunities to science students.\n\nIn addition to her scholarly pursuits, Rettig is highly engaged in her local community. She has coached soccer and basketball, engaged high school students in science outreach programs and research, serves as the clerk of the Granville Friends Meeting, coordinates the Granville Ministerium (a group of local clergy) and serves on the Board of Trustees of Kendal at Granville, a Quaker-associated retirement and assisted living community.\n\nRettig’s husband, Geoff Smith ’90, is also a professor of biology at Denison. Together, they are committed to their students and the teaching of natural history and field biology to undergraduates, including having worked in tandem with Earlham Professor Emeritus John Iverson to bring Earlham and Denison students together for field research on iguanas and turtles for many years.\n\nIn 2019, the College is pleased to honor Avis Stewart `74 as the recipient of Earlham’s 2019 Outstanding Alumni Award, and Stephen Heiny and Charles Meyer `69 as recipients of the Distinguished Service Award.\n\nOutstanding Alumni Award\n\nAvis Stewart `74\n\nAvis Stewart ’74 stands apart for his record of service to Earlham. Few, if any, have served Earlham in more varied and substantive ways. His 39-year career at the College him in numerous departments and touched thousands of lives. Most recently, he was appointed interim president in June 2018 and concluded his service one year later with the hiring of Anne Houtman as president of the College. Stewart served as vice president for community relations from 2002-2015 and vice president for institutional advancement and community relations from 2015-17. In 2017-18, he served on the president’s cabinet as a senior adviser to the president and as a major gift officer. Prior appointments include such roles as associate vice president of major gifts, assistant vice president for development and director of special projects, regional alumni and development director, director of alumni relations, associate dean of student development for student activities, assistant professor of Sports & Movement Studies and head men’s basketball coach. Stewart’s contributions to Earlham and the communities of Richmond and Wayne County have been widely celebrated. In 2014, he received the Sagamore of the Wabash Award, Indiana’s highest accolade for public service. His other honors include the Townsend Community Center President’s Award, United Way of Whitewater Valley Volunteer of the Year, Wayne County Area Chamber of Commerce’s Appreciation of Service Award and the Art Vivian Distinguished Community Leader Award. A native of Marion, Indiana, Stewart came to Earlham in 1970 as a student and was a four-year member of the Earlham basketball team and three-year member of the track team while earning his bachelor’s degree. He was inducted into the Earlham Athletics Hall of Fame in 2001. Colleagues and students who gathered in May 2018 for a celebration of his service, lauded him for his gifts of talented dedication, care for others, humility and love for the College.\n\nDistinguished Service Award\n\nProfessor Emeritus Stephen Heiny\n\nSteve Heiny has been a champion for Classics and the humanities at Earlham since he arrived as a newly minted Ph.D. from Indiana University in 1970. And, although he technically retired in 2012, he has yet to step away from the College’s seminar tables. Described as “endlessly energetic both intellectually and physically, furiously curious about almost everything,” his example invites students and colleagues to jump in with a similar zeal. He works tirelessly to cultivate great discussions and true exchanges of views, combining a love of the material with scrupulous preparation. Notable to students and colleagues alike is his ability to make learning fun. Although Heiny is best known for his work in the classroom, he also led Ford-Knight student-faculty research projects on such subjects as Greek plays, the Olympic Games and the poetry of Seamus Heaney. In the nomination papers, Gordon Thompson, professor emeritus of English, recalls a scene from the 1980s in which Heiny, working in a recently rearranged room, was teaching in his usual hyper-focused manner: “He crashed into a desk he hadn’t seen, almost fell to the floor and, clearly injured, he hobbled back to the board. Any other teacher would have self-consciously cracked a joke or two, but this teacher didn’t break stride or pause for breath — and his students didn’t even laugh. What was going on in that class was too important — for everyone — to take time out for a snicker.”\n\nCharles Meyer `69\n\nCharles “Chuck” Meyer ’69 used his intellectual gifts to help people. Ordained as an Episcopal priest, he became a medical ethicist, working on end-of-life care and related issues, and eventually becoming a hospital administrator. Meyer earned a Master of Divinity degree from Union Theological Seminary in New York, a master’s in education guidance and counseling from the University of Bridgeport, and certification in correctional counseling and pastoral counseling. At the time of his death in 2000 from injuries sustained in an automobile accident, Meyer was vice president of operations for St. David’s Medical Center in Austin, Texas. He taught in Austin at both the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest and at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary. In addition, he served at Union, New York and General theological seminaries, as well as the University of Bridgeport. In 1985, he was named one of Austin’s Ten Outstanding Citizens. At St. David’s he helped create the medical ethics committee, which became a model for others around the country. He co-founded Hospice Austin and had a large impact on the larger community of Austin through his work on medical ethics, grieving and pastoral care. Also a mystery writer, he authored 13 books and is well known in mystery writers’ circles for the Lucas Holt murder mysteries set in Austin.\n\nThe Earlham College Alumni Council was pleased to announce Mat Johnson `93 and Anne Mathews-Younes `68 as the recipients of Earlham’s 2018 Outstanding Alumni Award, and John Young `55 as the recipient of the Distinguished Service Award.\n\nOutstanding Alumni Award\n\nMat Johnson `93\n\nMat Johnson ’93, an award-winning American writer, holds an endowed chair at the University of Oregon.

Watson Fellowship that allowed him to study the African-American diaspora in Europe and Africa while living in London. He received his M.F.A. from Columbia University and has taught at Rutgers College, Bard College, Columbia, Hope College and Temple University.\n\nIn 2007, Johnson was the first recipient of the James Baldwin Fellowship and in 2011 was the Dos Passos Prize winner. Johnson’s writing, provocative and entertaining, addresses race and social issues both in the past and present day.\n\nAnne Mathews-Younes `68\n\nAnne Mathews-Younes ’68 is director of the Division of Prevention, Traumatic Stress and Special Programs for the Center for Mental Health Services in the Federal Department of Health and Human Services and president of the E. Stanley Jones Foundation. She completed her doctorate in counseling and consulting psychology from Harvard in 1980 and has worked in state and federal mental health agencies for more than 40 years in programs designed to prevent school violence and suicide (in particular, suicide prevention on college campuses), promote mental health and prevent mental disorders, treat child trauma, and support disaster, terrorism and bioterrorism preparedness and response.\n\nMathews-Younes also completed a master’s degree in theological studies in 2007 and a doctoral degree in 2012 in ministry, both at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C. Both of her theology degree theses focused on the life, mission and theology of her late grandfather, E. Stanley Jones, with whom she traveled extensively through India and Africa after majoring in religion from Earlham.\n\nShe is currently working with Methodist Publishing House to reprint Jones’ 28 books so a new generation can engage with his writings.\n\nDistinguished Service Award\n\nJohn G.

Young served 18 years as an Earlham alumni trustee and an at-large trustee approved by Western Yearly Meeting. He was vice chair of the Board of Trustees and served a 10-year term, some of them as chair of the Earlham Foundation. He served briefly as chair of the Conner Prairie Board during Conner Prairie’s transition to independence and was the first Earlham appointee to the independent Conner Prairie Museum Board of Directors. John and Gretchen have four children: Rebecca ’81, Melissa ’82, Jennifer, and David ’92.\n\nThe Earlham College Alumni Council was pleased to honor Amanda Mills Wilcox `76 and Daniel J.

He is a long-time trustee of the Wayne County Boys Club and is past president of the Richmond Rotary Club.\n\nAndrea Seabrook ’96\n\nAndrea Seabrook ’96 speaks a voice familiar to millions of listeners to National Public Radios news and information programs. As NPR’s congressional correspondent she brings daily breaking news as well as longer, in-depth features on Congress. While frequently a thorn in the side of the House leadership in both parties as any good reporter ought to be she is often sought out by them, says NPR’s senior Washington editor Ron Elving. This is a testament to her great gift of personable interaction.\n\nSeabrook joined the NPR in 1998 as an editorial assistant. After a stint at NPRs Mexico Bureau she returned to Washington and eventually became an editorial assistant for the networks Morning Edition program.

Between 1975 and 1985, he served as the board’s chair. He remains an honorary lifetime trustee.\n\n“Capturing Gerald’s leadership on the Board of Trustees is more a task for the College Archivist than a letter like this,” one board colleague wrote in support of the award. He recalled that “Gerald was a model of what a college trustee should be. He was a quiet, but effective counselor to Earlham’s presidents and encouraged his fellow trustees to take the long view of the role of the College, insisting on fiscal responsibility and using his business acumen to inform his own opinions and to help shape the Boards consensus on many, many issues.”\n\nGerald Mills was a successful leader in American retailing. He served as president of Indianapolis based L.S. Ayres Department Stores. Later he served as executive vice president of Dayton Hudson Corporation, a national chain of retail stores that includes Target. The corporation is consistently saluted for its practice of expressed ethical standards. After retiring from Dayton Hudson Corporation, he served as Chairman and CEO of Jacobsons specialty stores.\n\nPaul A. Lacey\n\nPaul A. Lacey was practically an institution within an institution long before he retired from Earlham College as professor of English in 2001. For thousands of students who matriculated through his diverse courses in English and the Humanities, Paul Lacey’s face remains a fond memory of Earlham.\n\nNoting that a senior colleague once had asserted that Paul Lacey was “the most important person” at the College, a professor who nominated him for the Distinguished Service Award concurred. “That was a fair assessment, it is not going too far to say that for most of his time at Earlham, Paul was our mentor, our visionary and our conscience.”\n\nHis service to Earlham included a three-year term as provost (1972-75), sandwiched with one year as acting president. His fellowships and awards include the Danforth Foundation’s Harbison Prize for Distinguished Teaching and the Sears Roebuck Foundation’s Teaching Excellence and Campus Leadership Award.

Her vision for the educational value of a student-run horse and riding operation led to the creation of the shining equestrian center that bears her name.\n\nThe center evolved from the horse and stable program created while Jackson was a student riding enthusiast at Earlham. In addition to financing the new, modern center, Jackson’s generosity has steadily maintained and enhanced Hoerner residence hall, named for her father, Richard ’20.\n\nThe center, completed in 1998, features a 20-stall barn with tack rooms, lounge, classroom and medical and feed facilities. The barn opens on a 60-by-120 foot riding ring, four fenced pastures and access to miles of riding trails through Earlham’s south campus.

It was her work as a staff person with the American Friends Service Committee in Osaka, Japan, that sparked her interest in Oriental Studies.\n\nHer early research focused on popular literature and art of the medieval period. She has published widely in this field in both English and Japanese.\n\nLater she pioneered the discovery that in some Buddhist convents nuns had preserved Imperial cultural treasures. In l989, when the Japanese Ministry of Education selected her as Foreign Research Scholar at the National Institute for Japanese Literature in Tokyo, she established the ongoing joint international research project which is devoted to carrying out Japan’s first Imperial Buddhist convent survey of materials related to women’s religious faith in pre-modern eras. This work has broadened and deepened the discipline of medieval Japanese religious studies which heretofore had focused only on the male spiritual experience.\n\nBarbara has received many honors. Most recently (1999) the Japanese Government awarded her the Imperial decoration, The Order of the Precious Crown with Butterfly Crest. And in 2000 the Osaka Prefecture Government of Civic and Cultural Affairs awarded her the Yamagata Banto Prize. This is given annually to one Japanese specialist nominated worldwide. It honors the outstanding achievement, leadership and creativity of the nominee in contributing to the study of Japanese culture.\n\nRandall B. Wisehart ’75\n\nRandall B.

A Winding Road to Freedom is now being considered for a movie. Such interest reveals the power of Randy’s writing and how he also seeks to serve children not only in his teaching but also through his writing.\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of his work in promoting Earlham and the notion of the nurturing of the “teacher within” is through his unstinting support of the College’s Education and M.A.T. (Master of Arts in Teaching) programs. Despite being a full-time employee for Richmond Community Schools, as a teacher and teacher leader, he has mightily contributed to the formation of the M.A.T. program as consultant, teacher and volunteer.\n\nRobert L. Wixom ’47\n\nRobert L. Wixom’s life shows his Quaker heritage and his liberal arts program approach developed at Earlham College. This is reflected in his later choices of profession (teaching and research in biochemistry at the School of Medicine at both University of Arkansas and University of Missouri), his frequent contact/interaction with many medical, biochemical and other health-related students, his search for scientific approach to truth with graduate and medical students and his open-minded inquiry-based approach to science, religion and the world community.\n\nHe has received three teaching awards, one of which was a nomination by MU students for the Conservation Educator of the Year (1996) for the State of Missouri.
