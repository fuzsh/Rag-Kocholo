        "text": "Wagner is derived from the Germanic surname Waganari, meaning \"wagonmaker\" or \"wagon driver\". The Wagner surname is German and Jewish (Ashkenazic). This German surname is also well established in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, eastern Europe, and elsewhere as well as in German-speaking countries. The Wagner surname was first found in Saxony, where the family became a prominent contributor to the development of the area from ancient times.\n\nSome of the first American settlers of this name or some of its variants were: Andreas Wagner, who immigrated to America with his wife and two children in 1709; Abraham Wagner came to Philadelphia in 1737; as did Christoph Wagner in 1747.\n\nToday, Wagner is the 4th most common name in Austria and the 8th most common in Germany. It is mainly to be found in southern Germany. The largest concentrations of the name are in Saarland, Rheinland Pflalz, Thuringen, Hessen, Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg, and Saxony.\n\nThe Wagner numbers today are approximately:\n\n220,000 in Germany\n\nand 22,000 in Austria.\n\nThis compares with the roughly 60,000 Wagners whose ancestors crossed the Atlantic and now live in America. Wagners starting coming in 1710, following the religious disturbances in the Palatine.\n\nEngland. The Wagner numbers in England are small.\n\nThe best-known of these Wagners are probably \"the Wagners of Brighton\" - descendants of Melchior Wagner who had arrived in England from the Saxon city of Coburg in 1709 and became the hatter to King George I. The Rev. Henry Wagner, the vicar of Brighton between 1824 and 1870, and his son the Rev. Arthur Wagner founded and funded a succession of Anglican churches in Brighton for the benefit of its rapidly growing population. From another line came Sir Anthony Wagner, the long-serving officer at the College of Arms in London.\n\nAmerica. In its Dutch form Van Wagenen, the name was one of the earliest in America. Geertie Van Wagenen was born in Kingston, New York in 1686. His descendants, the Van Wagoners, were to be found in the Hudson valley.\n\nGerman Palatine refugees started arriving in America in 1710, including Johan Peter Wagner from Hesse Darmstadt who purchased land from the Indians and settled in New York's Mohawk valley. The stone house that was built there in the 1740's is still standing today. The German Wagner influx was mainly into Pennsylvania, which is still the state with the largest number of Wagners (the early spelling was sometimes Waggoner).\n\nCanada. Early Wagners came to French Quebec, either from German-speaking Alsace or Hessian soldiers stationed there who remained. Wagners from Germany went mainly to Ontario. William Wagner arrived there in 1850 and eventually settled in Manitoba where he founded the farming community of Ossowa. The lawyer and politician Claude Wagner was the son of a Jewish violinist immigrant from Central Europe.\n\nAustralia. Johannes Gottfried Wagner from Silesia came out to Brisbane in 1838 as a missionary. He tried to convert the local aborigines to Christianity, with what success it is not known. He later became a Presbyterian minister. Henry Wagner, a shepherd, emigrated from Hesse in 1855 after some bad harvests and made his home in Toowoomba. Since those early pioneering days, the Wagner family of Toowoomba has become through its various enterprises one of the wealthiest in Queensland.\n\nY-DNA Haplogroups\n\nThere are Wagners (and variant spellings) in all corners of the world today. Most descendants are usually in the y-DNA haplogroup R1b1a2 which is by far the most common haplogroup in western Europe. It reaches frequencies of over 90 percent in Wales, Ireland and the Basque region of Spain.\n\nHaplogroup R1a is the largest group in much of an area stretching from eastern Europe to India. It is not common in western Europe outside of Scandinavia. For that reason, this group is usually thought to denote Viking heritage when found in the British Isles.\n\nHaplogroup I originated approximately 25,000 years ago among the people of Eastern Africa and/or Southern Europe. It represents nearly one-fifth of the population of Europe. It can be found in the majority of present-day European populations; the greatest density to be found is in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Norway, Sweden, Serbia, Sardinia, Denmark and Germany. The haplogroup is almost non-existent outside of Europe, suggesting that it arose in Europe. As the ice receded after the last glacial maximum, Haplogroup I spread into Northern Europe. There is some speculation the initial dispersion of this population corresponds to the diffusion of the Gravettian culture, named after the archeological site of La Gravette in the Dordogne region of France where its characteristic tools were first found and studied.\n\nHaplogroup I1 is a northwestern European group with its highest percentages in Sweden and Norway,though it is quite common in most of the Germanic speaking areas. In Britain, it is the second largest group (after R1b) and is usually associated with the Anglo-Saxon migration or with the later Viking invasions.\n\nHaplogroup I2a is a European group which is found primarily in the Balkans. It reaches its zenith in Bosnia where it constitutes over 40% of the population. The most likely source for this haplogroup in Britain would seem to be from Thracian, Dacian or Illyrian soldiers in the Roman army.\n\nHaplogroup J has two main branches, J1 and J2. Both are found in Eastern African populations. It also spread into Europe and the Indian subcontinent during the Bronze Age. J2 lineages originated in the area known as the Fertile Crescent. J1 lineages may have a more southern origin, as they are more often found in the Levant region, other parts of the Near East, and North Africa, with a sparse distribution in the southern Mediterranean flank of Europe, and in Ethiopia.\n\nHaplogroup J2b is most common in the Middle East and reaches its highest percentages in Turkey. In Europe, the largest J2b populations are in Greece, Albania and Italy. This haplogroup is rare in Britain where it could represent remnants of eastern Mediterranean troops stationed on the island during the Roman occupation. It also might indicate Jewish heritage.\n\nMitochondrial (mtDNA) Haplogroups\n\nSpecific mitochondrial haplogroups are typically found in different regions of the world, and this is due to unique population histories. In the process of spreading around the world, many populations with their special mitochondrial haplogroups became isolated, and specific haplogroups concentrated in geographic regions. Today, certain haplogroups have been identified that originated in Africa, Europe, Asia, the islands of the Pacific, the Americas, and even particular ethnic groups. Of course, haplogroups that are specific to one region are sometimes found in another, but this is due to recent migration.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroups A,B, C, D, and X are Native American mitochondrial haplogroups.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup A has its highest frequencies are among Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Its largest overall population is in East Asia, and its greatest variety (which suggests its origin point) is in East Siberia.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup B is the only mitochondrial haplogroup whose distribution encompasses both sides of the Pacific Ocean, the Americas, Polynesia, the Philippines, Japan, China,Indonesia, Thailand, and has even been found in Madagascar.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup C is believed to have arisen somewhere between the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal some 60,000 years before present. The sublades C1b, C1c, C1d, and C4c are found in the first people of the Americas. C1 is the most common.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup D is found in Northeast Asia including Siberia. It is also found quite frequently in Central Asia, where it makes up the second most common mtDNA clade (after H). Mitochondrial haplogroup D also appears at a low frequency in northeastern Europe and southwestern Asia. D4 is also frequent to Koreans according to latest study.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup F is most frequent in southeast Asia.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup H is a predominantly European haplogroup that participated in a population expansion beginning approximately 20,000 years ago. Today, about 30% of all mitochondrial lineages in Europe are classified as haplogroup H. It is rather uniformly distributed throughout Europe suggesting a major role in the peopling of Europe, and descendant lineages of the original haplogroup H appear in the Near East as a result of migration.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup HV is a primarily European haplogroup that underwent an expansion beginning approximately 20,000 years ago. It is more prevalent in western Europe than in eastern Europe, and descendant lineages of the original haplogroup HV appear in the Near East as a result of more recent migration. One of the dominant mitochondrial haplogroups in Europe, haplogroup HV pre-dates the occurrence of farming in Europe.\n\nPrincipally a European haplogroup, mitochondrial haplogroup I is detected at very low frequency across west Eurasia with slightly greater representation in northern and western Europe. Given its wide, but sparse, distribution, it is likely that it was present in those populations that first colonized Europe.\n\nThe mitochondrial haplogroup J contains several sub-lineages. The original haplogroup J originated in the Near East approximately 50,000 years ago.\n\nHaplogroup J*, the root lineage of haplogroup J, is found distributed throughout Europe, but at a relatively low frequency. Haplogroup J* is generally considered one of the prominent lineages that was part of the Neolithic spread of agriculture into Europe from the Near East beginning approximately 10,000 years ago. Within Europe, sub-lineages of mitochondrial haplogroup J have distinct and interesting distributions.\n\nHaplogroup J1b is found distributed in the Near East and southern Iberia, and may have been part of the original colonization wave of Neolithic settlers moving around the Mediterranean 6000 years ago or perhaps a lineage of Phoenician traders. Within haplogroup J1b, a derivative lineage haplogroup J1b1 has been found in Britain and another sub-lineage detected in Italy.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup K is found through Europe, and contains multiple closely related lineages indicating a recent population expansion. The origin of haplogroup K dates to approximately 16,000 years ago, and it has been suggested that individuals with this haplogroup took part in the pre-Neolithic expansion following the Last Glacial Maximum.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup L1 is found in West and Central sub-Saharan Africa. Some of its branches (L1d, L1k, L1a, L1f) were recently re-classified into haplogroup L0 as L0d,L0k, L0a and L0f. Haplogroup L1 arose with Mitochondrial Eve and haplogroup L0 is an offshoot. The descendants of haplogroup L1 are also African haplogroups L2 and L3, the latter of which gave rise to all non-African haplogroups. Haplogroup L1 is believed to have first appeared in Africa approximately 150,000 to 170,000 years ago.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup L2 is native to sub-Saharan Africa, where it is present in approximately one third of all people. It is believed to have arisen approximately 70,000 years ago from the line of haplogroup L1.\n\nMitochondrial Sub-haplogroup L3e is wide spread in Africa. It is the most common of the L3 sub-haplogroups, accounting for just over one-third of all L3-type sequences and is the most common sub-haplogroup within the Bantu-speaking populations of east Africa. L3e is suggested to be associated with a central African/Sudanese origin about 45,000 years ago and is also the most common mitochondrial haplogroup L3 subclade amongst African Americans, Afro-Brazilians and Caribbeans.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup M comprises the first wave of human migration out of Africa, following an eastward route along southern coastal areas. Descendant populations belonging to mitochondrial haplogroup M are found throughout East Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Melanesia, though almost none have been found in Europe.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup N may represent another migration out of Africa, heading northward instead of eastward. Shortly after the migration, the large R mitochondrial haplogroup split off from the N.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup R consists of two subgroups defined on the basis of their geographical distributions, one found in southeastern Asia and Oceania and the other containing almost all of the modern European populations. Haplogroup N(xR), i.e. mtDNA that belongs to the N group but not to its R subgroup, is typical of Australian aboriginal populations, while also being present at low frequencies among many populations of Eurasia and the Americas. Its arrival in Europe around 35,000 years ago coincided with the end of the Neandertals.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup T is common in eastern and northern Europe and found as far east as the Indus Valley and the Arabian Peninsula. It is considered one of the main genetic signatures of the Neolithic expansion.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup U has a wide distribution. Most in mtDNA haplogroup U come from a group that moved northwest out of the Near East. Today they are found in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean at frequencies of almost 7% of the population.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup V tends to be restricted to western, central, and northern Europe. It is found in 12% of Basques and is thought to have been established within the European refuge during the last Ice Age.\n\nMitochondrial Haplogroup X is found in Europe and Asia, and is believed to have migrated to the Americas about 15,000 years ago, making up a very small component of the Native American population as in the Ojibwa, Sioux, Nuu-Chah-Nulth, and Navajo tribes."
