A HISTORY OF ETON COLLEGE BY LIONEL CUST OISE/UT LIBRARY LONDON DUCKWORTH & CO. 3, HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT GARDEN, W.C. First Published, iSgg New and Cheaper Edition, igoQ Printed by Ballantvne, Hanson & Co At the Ballantyne Press PREFACE It would seem as if some apology were due for the publica- tion of this book. Eton has been a fruitful, perhaps too fruitful, source of inspiration to writers of all ages in the nineteenth century. The attractiveness of the subject cannot be gainsaid; but it may fairly be asked. Why write another book when there is nothing new to be said, no new record to be discovered ; why try and glean in a field which has been reaped close, and swept clean, more- over, by other gleaners before ? Yet the series of English Public Schools in course of publication by Messrs. Duckworth & Co. could hardly be complete without the inclusion of some account of Eton College ; hence the present work. The general history of Eton College has been completed and added to from time to time by Sir Henry Churchill Maxwell-Lyte, K.C.B., Deputy-Keeper of the Records, than whom no one by inclination or experience could be better fitted for his task. A third edition of his work has just been issued to the public. It should be clearly understood that no writer can hope to add anything of vi PREFACE importance to the history of Eton College, as set forth in Sir H. C. Maxwell-Lyte's monumental work. The history of the buildings of Eton College — a most interesting subject in itself — has been set forth in minute detail, and with the greatest care and accuracy, by Mr. John Willis Clark, Registrary of the University of Cambridge, in the chapters on King's College and Eton College, which are embodied in the Architectiir'al History of the Uni- versity of Cambridge^ compiled by Mr. Clark and the late Professor Willis. It is to be hoped that this valuable contribution to the history of Eton and King's may some day be issued in a separate volume. The general history of King's College, Cambridge, so closely associated with that of Eton College, has recently been set forth, in what will probably prove a final form, by the present Provost of King's, the Rev. Augustus Austen-Leigh. The biogi'aphies of famous Etonians have been collected by various writers, such as Mr. J. Heneage Jesse and Sir Edward S. Creasy, to say nothing of so famous a work as Harwood's Alumni Etonenses. They are now about to be put into a final shape in the sym- pathetic hands of Mr Arthur C. Benson. Mr. Chetwynd- Stapylton's Eton Sclwol Lists have, in spite of many inaccuracies, proved an inexhaustible mine of information. The various books in which stories have been col- PREFACE vii lected of Eton and Eton boys are very numerous, and continue at the present day to multiply their progeny. The same may be said of those in which the doughty deeds of Etonians on the river, the cricket-field, and elsewhere are recounted with Homeric enthusiasm, and perhaps also with something of Virgilian piety. With all these books on Eton the present volume does not hope or wish to compete. An attempt has been made to give a short narrative touching on the most important features of the history of Eton College, without however making it any the less necessary to refer to the more important works of Sir H. C. Maxwell- Lyte and Mr. J. W. Clark ; and also to make such allusion to the various books of reminiscences, such as Etoniana and others, as may create in the stranger, not only in the Etonian, a desire to become more closely acquainted with the peculiar intimate atmosphere which envelops Eton and Eton boys, and converts apparently trivial and commonplace occurrences or say- ings into events as important as any recorded in Hero- dotus, Livy, or the Student's Hume. Thanks are specially due to Mr. Arthur C.Benson and Mr. Ingalton Drake for permission to use some of the negatives taken in view of Mr. Benson's forthcoming- work ; to Mr. Philip Norman for the use of the beautiful drawings here reproduced ; to Mr. Thomas Carter for the viii PREFACE use of some new photographs taken by him at Eton ; to Earl Waldegrave for permission to reproduce the portrait of the fifth Earl ; and also to Mr. W. Essington Hughes for permission to reproduce the curious portrait of the founder, Henry VI., which was copied from the original in the British Museum at Mr. Hughes's expense. The author has also to thank Mr. Reginald J. Smith, Q.C., for his kindness in reading the proofs, and for much sympathetic advice. i ETONENSIBUS OMNIBUS UBICUNQUE ER ORBEM TERRARUM DISPERSIS HUNC LIBELLUM ETONENSIS SCRIPTOR ETONENSIS EDITOR CONDICAVERUNT MDCCCXCIX CONTENTS PREFACE CHAF.

Yet the foundation of Eton College was entirely due to Henry of Windsor, sixth of the name, ' the good and holy youth,' whom a turn of fortune's wheel had 2 ETON COLLEGE brought, when but an infant in arms, to occupy an unstable throne at the outset of a cruel and internecine dynastic struggle. From his earliest youth Henry VI. had been brought up in an atmosphere of religion and learning. He had been baptized by the great Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose services in the cause of education are well known. His early youth was passed under the influence of his uncle and first guardian and protector, the scholar-statesman Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the Good Duke Humphrey as he was called, more perhaps fi'om his munificent benefactions to scholarship and learning than from his general moral character, which is one of the most perplexing problems in the Middle Ages. Subsequently Henry had fallen almost entirely under the control of his great-uncle, Henry Beaufort, Gloucester's enemy and rival, who, when not engaged on militant politics, may be presumed to have not neglected his position as a Cardinal of the Church. Beaufort was a more powerful mind and a better counsellor than Gloucester; but the bitter contest for supremacy between the two nmst have been a source of trouble to the infant-king, and a bad augury of further difficulties to come. Henry's mind was one ill constituted to cope with the tempests and buffets of fortune with which he was fated to contend. From his earliest child- hood he was inclined to works of piety and devotion. In Windsor (Jastle he was accustomed to associate with the youthful heirs of the nobility, so much so that Windsor HENRY VI. From a Drawing in Harl. MS. 4205, at tlu British Museum. To face p. 3. FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 3 became known even in those days as an ' academy for the young nobility/ \" There was not in the world,\" writes Polydore Vergil, the historian, \" a more pure, more honest, and more holy creature.\" Such were the qualities, it may be surmised, which Henry would be most desirous to transmit as a legacy to his scholars at Eton and Cambridge. As early as 1439 Henry had planned in his mind the foundation of Eton College. He had acquired certain properties upon the site, and obtained leave from the Bishop of Lincoln to appropriate the advowson of the parochial church of Eton and convert it into a collegiate church. He was guided in his plans by the older foundations of William of Wykeham at Winchester and New College, Oxford, and also in all probability by the foundations of Archbishop Chichele at Higham Ferrers and All Souls', Oxford. It has been stated that it was John Langton, Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and afterwards Bishop of St. David's, who first suggested to the boy-king the idea of similar foundations at Eton and Cambridge. At all events, in 1440 Henry paid more than one visit himself to Win- chester, in order to make himself personally acquainted with the details of Wykeham's foundation and its actual working in practice. It is clear that, although the colleges at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, were founded simul- taneously, it was not the King's original intention to make them dependent upon each other, as in the case of Win- chester and New College, Oxford. Whatever Langton's 4 ETON COLLEGE influence may have been at Cambridge, it seems certain that, as far as Eton College was concerned, the King's principal adviser was Thomas of Bekynton, a AVykehamist scholar. In September 1440 letters patent were issued by the King for the constitution of a college of Fellows, priests, clerks, choristers, poor scholars, and old poor men, with one master or governor, \" whose duty it shall be to in- struct these scholars and any others who may resort thither from any part of England in the knowledge of letters, and especially of grammar, without payment.\" This was followed on October 10 by a Charter of Foundation, in the preamble to which, after a panegyric on the Church, \" the Mother and Mistress of all who are born again in Christ,\" the King states that \"at length, while we were thinking over these things with the most profound attention, it hath become a fixed purpose in our heart to found a college in honour and in support of that our Mother, who is so great and so holy, in the Parochial Church of Eton near Windsor, not far from our birth- place.\" By this charter the ' King's College of our Lady of Eton beside Windsor' was constituted into a corpo- rate body, consisting of a Provost, ten Fellows, four clerks, six choristers, a schoolmaster, twenty-five poor and indigent scholars, and twenty-five poor and infirm men. It thus comprised the elements of a college, a grammar-school and an almshouse. The Provost was l^ to have been educated at Eton College or King's College, Cambridge, to have been born in England, to be a FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 5 Bachelor of Divinity, Doctor of Canon Law, or Master of Arts, to be in holy orders, and not less than thirty years of age. The Fellows were to be selected from the Fellows or former scholars of King's, or from present or former chaplains of the college, or, failing both these sources, from the other colleges or anywhere else, accord- ing to the discretion of the existing Fellows. They were to be in priest's orders. Bachelors of Divinity, Masters of Canon Law, or Masters of Arts. They were not to own property of more than ,^£'10 a year, or be absent from college longer than six weeks at a time without special leave. The Provost was to receive £15 a year (including an allowance for tithes), twelve yards of cloth at 3s. 6d. a yard, and 3s, a week for commons. He was to keep three servants {quorum unus generosior domiceUus, alii vero duo valecti), who were partly paid for by the College. The Fellows received d£^10 a year, six yards of cloth, eighteenpence a week for commons, and all dieta were at first paid in kind. A Provost was at once appointed, an honour which the King seems to have intended for his trusty friend, John Stanbury, afterwards Bishop of Hereford, but which he finally conferred upon Henry Sever, his chaplain and almoner, then Chancellor of St. Paul's Cathedral. One of the first Fellows, with the title of Vice-Provost, was John Kette, who had resigned the Rectory of Eton in order to further Henry's scheme of foundation. At that date, in order to carry through so important a scheme, and one so nearly connected with the Church, it was absolutely necessary to obtain Papal sanction for 6 ETON COLLEGE anything involving the foundation of a new religious institution. Henry VL was not likely to neglect his duty in this respect. Frequent messages passed between Windsor and Rome, until in January 144f a Bull was issued by Pope Eugenius IV. giving sanction to all the King''s intentions. Upon receipt of this Henry proceeded to endow the new colleges at Eton and Cambridge with some of the estates in England which the alien priories in France and elsewhere had been compelled to surrender to the Crown. At Eton also he bought up all the private houses and fields which lay within the intended precincts of the college. After making these and other careful provisions, Henry proceeded to lay the first stone of the new collegiate church, as the most important of the new buildings already carefully planned out in his mind. This event seems to have taken place on or about June 5, 1441. There are few more picturesque incidents in the his- tory of England than the foundation of Eton College. It is easy to imagine in the mind a bright leafy day in June, with a procession issuing from the gates of Windsor Castle, descending the hill under the shadow of the castle walls, and crossing the wooden bridge over the Thames on its way to the parish church of the hamlet of Eton. In the centre would be riding the youth- ful, beardless King, while the unusual number of prelates and clergy in the pi'ocession would suffice to denote the sacred character of their errand. Cardinal Beaufort, then the all-powerful Bishop of Winchester; William of Alnwick, then Bishop of Lincoln, in whose diocese 1 1 } . ^ ^ 1 ; ■^' ,' _^ K i, .,,! ■' ^4^ ; -•■ ' ■ ^*' \\y iii o o u z o < O o X o 5: FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 7 Eton lay; William Ayscough, Bishop of Salisbury; Richard Andrews, Dean of York and first Warden of All Souls' at Oxford ; William Lyndewode, most learned and trusted of councillors ; and, probably nearest the King, Thomas of Bekynton, the King's secretary and most con- fidential adviser, would have been conspicuous in the train. Near the King, also, would have ridden the most puissant William de la Pole, then Earl, but afterwards Marquess, and eventually Duke of Suffolk. In such state miffht the King have laid the first stone of \" the college roiall of our Ladye of Eton by Windesore,\" the stone which still remains under the altar-steps of the present chapel. The King's plans for the college buildings were drawn up, after two or three preliminary drafts, in a docu- ment, still preserved in the college, known as the Will (or Intention) of King Henry VI. Had the King's original plans been carried out, a traveller arriving by the road from Slough (via que diicH versus le Sloo), after passing the ' Shooting Fields,' then not yet ac- quired for the college, and crossing the bridge, known later on as ' Fifteen Arch Bridge,' would have arrived at the corner of the stone wall, which was intended to form the boundary of the college, enclosing the ' Kinges Werde ' between the road and the river Thames. A little farther on he would have come to the gate of the college, and on entering would have found himself in an outer court, with the college service buildings on his left and the almshouse on his right. Crossine- this court, towards the right hand he would have come 8 ETON COLLEGE opposite the turreted gateway of the college buildings, within which would have been the chief quadrangle, considerably larger than the present cloister. Round this would have been rows of chambers, one storey high, a schoolroom, a library, and on the south side the dining- hall and the Provost's residence. On the western side of the quadrangle a postern door would have led into a cloister, corresponding somewhat to the present school- yard. On the south of this cloister would have risen the collegiate church, approached from the cloister, in the western side of which would have risen a high tower. Outside the cloister the stone boundary wall, mentioned before, would have been continued up to Baldwyn\"'s (' Barnes ') Bridge, passing the old parish church on the site of the present churchyard, and turn- ing at the bridge over the stream, which flowed thence rapidly into the Thames, would have passed round the kitchen and ended on the bank of the back-water, sur- rounding the ground now known as ' Fellows\"' Eyot.' Special provisions were made for 'enhancing\"' certain buildings as a protection against floods, then, as now, the cause of much perplexing trouble and inconvenience. Of this plan, or Intention, the only portions to be carried out were the dining-hall, the kitchen, and, to a certain extent, the church. No record has been preserved of the King''s amended plans for the existing buildings, or the actual date at which he changed his mind. The building accounts have been preserved, and are unusually complete. They commence on July 3, 144L June 5, 1441, FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 9 is spoken of in the accounts as ' Dedication Day,' and may perhaps for this reason be accepted as the date on which the first stone was laid by the King. The genei'al super- intendence of the buildings was entrusted to William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk. Full details are given in the accounts of the stone, bricks, timber, and other materials employed in the construction of the buildings. The timber, much of which was transported by the river, was stored in a field opposite the college, then known as the ' timbrehawes,' a name still surviving in ' The Timbralls.' One Jourdelay is named among those employed upon the works, and he is paid \"for brede and hale and chese for workemen and laboras, taking the groundes of the college thorow the pondis in to the college.\" This house seems to have been used as a hostelry for strangers and their horses, and his name still survives in 'Jordelay''s Place,' one of the houses at present occupied by an assistant-master. The building accounts contain many interesting particulars concerning the master of the works, the clerk of the works, the masons, carpenters, smiths, purveyors, and others, with their wages, hours of work, rules, fines, &c., for which those curious in these matters must be referred to the careful extracts and abstracts given in the account of Eton College, which is embodied in Willis and Clark's Architectural History of tlie Uiiiver- Hity of Cambridge. Under the revised plans, the buildings were arranged very differently to those given in the King's 'Will.' They were practically reduced to a cloistered quadrangle 10 ETON COLLEGE for the Provost and Fellows, with a library, dining-hall, and necessary offices, a collegiate church, and a detached building containing dormitories for the boys, school-rooms, and residences for the Master and Usher. By the summer of 1443, if not earlier, some considerable portion of these buildings was far enough advanced to admit of occupa- tion. As early as the Papal Bull of January 1441 the names are given, in addition to those of the Provost and Vice-Provost, of two Priest-Fellows, two clerks, four choristers, two scholars, and two bedesmen, who must have been quartered upon the neighbouring inhabitants. The Founder now paid further visits to Winchester, and in consequence took a step fraught with the utmost im- portance for the history and welfare of Eton College. He persuaded William of Waynflete (William Patyn, born at Wainfleet, in Lincolnshire, about 1395), the Master of Winchester College, to remove to the new college at Eton as its first Master. Waynflete brought with him five Fellows and thirty-five scholars to form a nucleus for the school ; this is the number i-ecorded by tradition, though it does not agree with the Registers at Winchester itself. Waynflete had been a fellow-pupil of Bekynton at Winchester, and was on terms of great personal friendship with him. In 1443 Henry VI. re-cast his whole foundation in order to bring the numbers more into conformity with those at Winchester. Sever relinquished the post of Provost to William of Waynflete, and was rewarded in February 145f with the Warden- ship of Merton College, Oxford, where he died, and was HEAD OF WAYNFLETE [?] From a Windo'M of Thurburti s Chantry, c. 1455.

The numbers on the foundation were fixed at a Provost, ten Priest-Fellows, ten chaplains, ten clerks, sixteen choristers, seventy poor scholars, a Head- master, an Usher, and thirteen bedesmen. At the same time the Founder took a new step with regard to the sister foundation at King's College, Cam- bridge, dedicated \" to the honour of almighty and immacu- late Virgin Mary, mother of Christ, and also of the glorious confessors and Bishop Nicholas, patron of my intended college, on whose festival we first saw the light.\" It is touching to note the solicitude with which Henry con- nected his foundations at Eton and Cambridge with his own life. He laid the first stone of the buildings at Cambridge on April 2, 1441, two months before the similar ceremony at Eton. With the subsequent history of King''s College and its glorious chapel these pages cannot, however, deal. In 1443, however, Henry, acting no doubt under the advice of Waynflete, decided to con- nect the colleges of Eton and King^s College, Cambridge, together, like those of Winchester and New College, Oxford, in order to provide for the safe progression of the best of his Eton scholars to the University. With these new departures the actual history of the school at Eton may be said to begin. In November 1443, during the progress of the new buildings at Eton, an interesting ceremony took place in the parochial church. Thomas of Bekynton, the King's secretary, and without doubt his most confiden- tial friend and adviser in the plans of the College and its 12 ETON COLLEGE foundation, was consecrated Bishop of Bath and Wells. At Bekynton's special wish the ceremony took place at Eton, the Bishops of Lincoln, Salisbury, and Llandaff officiating. The new collegiate church stood unfinished hard by, and a temporary altar was prepared under an awning and directly over the foundation stone. Thither Bishop Bekynton proceeded after his consecration in the parochial church, and celebrated his first mass in full pontificals. After the service Bekynton entertained his visitors in the new school buildiiigs, et in nova Jahrica collegia ibidem ex 'parte boriali dum adkiic camerae non erant condistinctce suhhis tenuit convicium. It is not quite clear in what room this banquet was held. The text of the entry in his register leaves it doubtful whether the room was on the ground floor or above. ' Long Chamber ' bears traces of completion at a later date, but may have been planned out among the first buildings. In this way a series of Etonian bishops was inaugurated from Bekynton of Bath and Wells in 1443 to Welldon of Calcutta in 1898. In the following December another ceremony took place in the same choir, the first after its completion, and one of deeper import to the college. At this ceremony Bekynton officiated with the Earl of Suffolk as the King\"'s commissioners. William of Waynflete was solemnly installed as Provost in accordance with the revised statutes, and received the oath of allegiance from the Fellows, scholars, and other existing members of the foundation.

FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 13 corporate body, formed on this occasion, remained practi- cally unaltered in its scheme, if not maintained in its entirety. The tie thus formed between the foundations of William of Wykeham at Winchester and Oxford and these of Henry VI. at Eton and Cambridge was further cemented by a covenant (AmicabiUs Concordia) di'awn up between them for their mutual support and assistance in the case of need. During the progi'ess of the buildings at Eton, Henry VI. continued to make numerous provisions for the endowment and welfare of the College. Bekynton was his chief agent in the matter. In September 1443 Bekynton obtained leave from the Bishop of Lincoln to invest the Provost of Eton with special archidiaconal jurisdiction in the parish of Eton, on condition of a small annual payment to the Archdeacon of Buckingham- shire, which was, until lately, paid annually by the College. He then proceeded to solicit the Pope, on behalf of the King, for further and special favours. In order to attract strangers to Eton, indulgences of a very special nature had been granted by the Pope to all penitents visiting the collegiate church of Eton at the Feast of the Assumption, each penitent being expected to contribute towards the maintenance of the College, and advised to oiFer prayers for the Founder. In May 1444 a fresh Bull was issued, considerablv extending, while confirming, the indulgences already granted to Eton College. In consequence of this and subsequent advantages the number of pilgrims to the new college was very large. Their contributions, 14 ETON COLLEGE however, to the cost of the buildings hardly seem to have covered the expenses of their entertainment. To provide for the food and lodging of visitoi's on such occasions, in addition to an annual gift of red Gascon wine from the King, an annual fair was established to last during the six days after the Feast itself. A similar fair was instituted during the three days succeeding Ash Wednes- day for a similar reason. Both these fairs were entirely under the control of the Provost of Eton, and survived in modified forms until quite recent days. The College also was allowed a weekly market, a very exceptional privi- lege. The College was besides exempted from subsidies and other imposts. Furthermore, as the Provost was compelled to make frequent journeys to London to consult with the King, he was gi'anted the Hospital of St. James, then used for lepers, and standing apart in the fields near Westminster. Books, ornaments, vestments, relics, and the like were provided for the College on the petition of the Provost and Fellows. On April 11, 1447, Cardinal Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, died, leaving in his will legacies of money, with valuable jewels and relics, to Eton College. These legacies were, however, of less import to the college than the actual event of Beauforfs death, and the vacancy caused by it in the important see of Winchester, Henry VL hurriedly nominated William of Waynflete to the see, anticipating not only the wishes of the Chapter at Winchester, but even the right of nomination exercised by the Pope. The latter difficulty was easily arranged ; FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 15 but Waynflete himself seems to have shown no desire to leave Eton and break off the work which he had been the first to set in motion. It is recorded that the com- missioners came from Winchester with the royal conge d'elire, and found the Provost at prayers in the old parish church. Some persuasion was necessary to make him obey the command. In July 1447 the Provost was consecrated Bishop of Winchester in the church at Eton, and afterwards, by special permission of the Bishop of Lincoln, held his first ordination on the same spot. The removal from Eton of so important an individual as William of WajTiflete might have been disastrous to the future of the college. It proved, however, the reverse. As Bishop of Winchester, and afterwards as Lord High Chancellor, Waynflete became one of the most powerful men in England, so long as the Lancastrian cause was in the ascendant. Even during its eclipse his position in the Church remained unshaken. Eton College thus obtained a champion and protector more powerful under the circumstances than even the Founder himself. Meanwhile the Founder had made an impoi'tant alteration in the plans for the buildings at Eton College. Whether it was the growing importance of Eton as a place of pilgrimage and a centre of religious thought and practice, or nothing more than an increasing de- sire to expand and further a pet hobby, Henry was dissatisfied with the plans of the new collegiate church, and substituted for them a plan on a vastly extended scale. Perhaps the real moving cause was a wish to 16 ETON COLLEGE bestow on the Church, to which he was so much devoted, an edifice which would be one of the glories of Christen- dom, and obtain for its founder the thankful prayers of future generations. Roger Keys, then master of the works, was instructed to draw out new plans. Had these been carried out the new church would have been, so far as its simple construction of nave and choir allowed, greater in size and dimensions than any church in England save York Minster and the present St. Paul's Cathedral. The new church was to be erected in the Pure Per- pendicular Style, of which the portion completed remains such a conspicuous and typical example. A choir, with a Lady Chapel at the eastern end, would have opened out into a nave with aisles. It is impossible to say whether any additions would have been made to this simple plan, since the only part to be completed was the choir, which, without the Lady Chapel, forms the present well-known ' Chapel.'' Had the nave been completed, the church would have extended a considerable wav down what is now known as Keate's Lane. It is noteworthy that among the benefactors to Eton, William de la Pole, now Marquess, but soon to be Duke of Suffolk, contributed a sum towards building the church exceeding at the moment the contributions of the other chief contributors — the King, Waynflete, and Bishop Ayscough of Salisbury — all put together. Another favour conferred by the Founder on his colleges at Eton and Cambridge was the gi'ant of FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 17 armorial bearings. The flower most connected Avith the Virgin Mary, to whom Eton College was dedicated, is the lily, and a combination of white lilies with the royal arms of France and England, and in the case of King's College with the crozier of St. Nicholas, seems to have been in use in Wapiflete's day. The actual grants of these armorial bearings were not issued until January 144^. In these the Founder explains the significance of the charges. The sable ground denoted the perpetuity of the foundation, and the three white lily-flowers (with- out stalks or leaves) the service of God and the blessed and immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of Christ. \"The chief of the shield was to contain a portion of the royal arms of France and England, in order to impart some- thing of royal nobility, which may declare the work truly royal and illustrious.\" In the case of King''s College, the sable ground was charged with three white roses, as \" bright flowers redolent with every kind of learning.\"*' Similar roses form part of the armorial bearings of Win- chester College. In such a way did the new college at Eton rise and flourish under the very eye of the Founder himself. Clouds, however, began to rise upon the political horizon, though few could have prognosticated the terrible storm which was to break upon the land, and the cruel dynastic struggle which, besides devastating England, swept away bhe Founder of Eton College. In fact the College narrowly escaped being cast into the same gulf of de- struction as the hapless Henry himself. In 1452 18 ETON COLLEGE Margaret of Anjou gave birth to a long-desired son. She sent two messengers to Eton College to announce the news, which was received with joy there, probably as an augury of a continuous enjoyment of royal favour. In the following year Henry\"'s mind gave way, and he became incapable of managing his affairs. His cousin, Richard, Duke of York, who had been until the birth of the prince the next heir to the throne, was appointed Protector. The rivalry between him and Queen Margaret had already been shown in more than one way. From this time, however, it was converted into open hostility, which formed a short prelude to the disastrous Wars of the Roses. During this terrible time the works at Eton were cari'ied on with great difficulty, and eventually suspended altogether. The choir of the new church had been nearly completed, but the nave not even commenced. The quadrangle and cloister were nearly completed save on the western side. The dining-hall was finished by 1450. The scholars\"' buildings opposite the church with the Master's house were nearly finished, although only some portions seem to have been in use. The supply of money had ceased with the capture and incapacity of the Founder and the execution of the Duke of Suffolk. The whole future of the college depended on the whim of one man, Edward, Duke of York, whose hand was on the crown. Was it likely that during so heated a struggle as that of the Yorkist and Lan- castrian causes any of the specially wealthy foundations or possessions of the latter should escape spoliation ? FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 19 Fortunately for Eton College Waynflete had been succeeded, first as Master and then as Provost, by a man who was equal to the crisis. William Westbury came from Winchester to Eton to succeed Waynflete in the management of the school. He was elected Provost in November 1447 — Wavnflete's actual sue- cessor, John Clerk, having died five months after his election — and may be presumed to have been the heir and recipient of Waynflete''s intentions with regard to the future of the college. When it was evident that the Lancastrian cause was ruined, Westbury showed un- expected powers as a diplomatist. In February 146\" he sought direct protection from Edward, then still Duke of York, who signed a deed to protect the Pro- vost and Fellows of Eton, in which he is described as \"by ye grace of God of Englande Fraunce & Irlande vray and just heire.\" This seems a surprising act of tergiversation on the part of a college whose Founder was alive and a captive in the hands of the usurping prince. The line taken by the Provost and Fellows seems, however, to have been politic, for in a few months all Lancastrian grants were revoked except those to Eton. The danger, however, was not yet past. Edward had established himself at Windsor Castle, and having no particular interest in Eton, which he probably re- garded as Henry's special hobby, he made up his mind to annex the whole foundation to one in which he took a personal interest, that of St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Dean and Chapter of St. George's 20 ETON COLLEGE were only too willing, and with their help Edward had little trouble in obtaining a Bull from Pope Pius II. to carry the amalgamation into effect. The Chapter of St. George's at once laid hands upon all the portable wealth at Eton College and removed it to Windsor. The lion was, however, roused in Provost Westbury. Before the Papal Bull was received he went to London and proclaimed his lawful claim to the Provostship, and claimed thereby the special protection of the Pope. To the Pope he declared that as Provost he would never be a consenting party to the suppression of the College. In this action he was of course supported by Waynflete, who, although his political influence had waned, still held one of the most commanding positions in the Church. Clement Smyth, who, after being Master of Chichele's school at Higham Ferrers, had succeeded West- bury as Master, and been transferred to the more lucrative post at Winchester, returned to Eton and resumed his post to support Westbury at this critical time. West- bury\\s efforts were crowned with success. He seems to have expended much time and energy in assiduous court to the great nobles and the highest dignitaries of the Church. Edward was easy-going and indolent, careless of both religion and politics, and ready to cancel one day any order or grant which he had made the day before. His position on the throne was precarious, and depended on the support of the great nobles, who had already begun to look upon Eton as the obvious place of education for their sons. At all events, he was FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 21 induced to ask the Pope to revoke the Bull on the plea of erroneous information. As the Bull uniting the foundations of Eton and Windsor was issued by his predecessor and not by himself, Pope Paul II. thought himself able to give a cautious though sufficient assent. Westbury's triumph was almost complete, though the legal business connected with the revocation of the Bull seems to have been immense. Matters were complicated by the unexpected restoration of Henry VI. to the throne, which must have been the cause of great re- joicing to Eton College. The Provost and Fellows seem to have acted diplomatically in the matter, and, while being true in their devotion to their royal Founder, they managed to avoid giving offence to his enemy and the usurper of his crown. The Founder was, however, soon dethroned again, and had been but a few weeks in his grave when Edward IV., now recognised as King, paid with his Queen the first of frequent visits to Eton. It is difficult to account with certainty for the change in Edward's treatment of Eton College. Tradi- tion, never a safe guide, but one which should not be entirely ignored, has attributed it to the influence of the beautiful Jane Shore, Ed\\vard\"'s mistress, and her memory has been cherished at both Eton and King's for this reason, and her frailty excused by the extent of the benefits obtained from her intercession. There is indeed no reason for discrediting this particular tradi- tion. Sir Thomas INIore says, that \" where the King toke displeasure she could mitigate and appease his 22 ETON COLLEGE mind ; when men were out of faver, she could bring them in his ffrace.\" The Provost and Fellows of Eton were not likely to neglect any means of influencing Edward IV. It would seem, however, quite possible that the influence exerted upon Edward was much more legitimate, namely, that of his Queen, Elizabeth Widvile. Elizabeth accompanied Edward on several of his visits to Eton. Her brother, Anthony, Earl Rivers, was a scholar and a patron of learning, and is known to have taken an active interest in the welfare of the college. His services to the College were sufficient to ensure a daily mass, at which prayers were said for Edward IV., Queen Elizabeth, their children, and for Earl Rivers, and even his parents and other relations. Whether through the influence of ' Shore\"'s wife,' or of Elizabeth, the ' upstart ' Queen, Eton College was preserved from destruction. It suffered, however, severely in lands and revenues. The building opera- tions, so grievously interrupted, were resumed in 1469, but funds were very short. It remains to be stated that but for the generosity of Bishop Waynflete they would in all probability never have been completed at all. This is all the more remarkable, inasmuch as Wayn- flete was at the time engaged on his own foundation at Magdalen College, Oxford. It was, if not hopeless, at all events undesirable that the church should be com- pleted on the scale designed by the Founder. The portion completed was finished off\", and an ante-chapel added in the place of the nave. The church as com- FOUNDATION AND EARLY HISTORY 23 pleted now took the place of the old parish church, which was demolished. The school buildings were also completed, and a boys\"' chamber is mentioned as early as 1470, which was probably, but not certainly, identical with Long Chamber. The impoverishment of the College enabled the Provost and Fellows to dispense with some of the original members of the foundation, such as the bedesmen and the almshouse, and the somewhat un- necessary large number of chaplains. Provost Westbury died in 1477. The Fellows nomi- nated as his successor a late Vice-Provost, Thomas Barker, who, however, gave way to Henry Bost, the nominee of the crown. It has been stated that it was to the time of Provost Bost that the legend of Jane Shore should be applied. His epitaph, however, dis- tinctly alludes to his having used his influence to obtain sums from the legitimate consort of the King. Richard III. during his short reign, in spite of his hatred of the W id vile family and their friends, such as the Etonian Archbishop Rotherham, and his specially vindictive persecution of Jane Shore, does not appear to have troubled his mind much with the affairs of Eton College. The union of the Houses of York and Lancaster under Henry VII. was the signal for an epoch of pro- sperity for Eton College. Henry VII. is stated, but on very doubtful authority, to have actually been himself a scholar in Eton College. This would hardlv seem to have been possible, for until 1470, his fourteenth 24 ETON COLLEGE year, Henry was brought up in Wales. He only came to London during the short restoration of Henry VI. to the throne, when the King may have wished to place him at Eton. A few months later, however, Henry was a refugee in Brittany, where he remained during the whole of Edward IV.'s reign. Shortly after the acces- sion of Henry VIL, in 1486, William of Waynflete died. With his death the first epoch in the history of Eton College may be said to have come to an end. II THE EARLY PROVOSTS When the Houses of York and Lancaster, the White and Red Roses, were at last united under the sway of Henry VIL, Eton College and other similar institutions enjoyed a few years of tranquil prosperity. The vicinity of Eton College to Windsor Castle has always rendered it peculiarly susceptible to the varying breezes of royal favour. Seizing their opportunity the colleges of Eton and King\"'s presented a petition to the King, and explained therein the losses which they had sustained during the Civil Wars. They were successful in recovering some of the possessions of which they had been despoiled by Edward IV., and as the re-establishment of peace once more unloosed the fountains of private beneficence, they received further endowments by gift or bequest. The Church became rich with jewels, plate, and sacred images. Visits were paid to the College by the King, the Papal Legate, the Bishops of Lincoln and Chichester, and other eminent persons, who were handsomely entertained in esciilentis et poculentis by the Provost. Beyond this and the succession of Roger Lupton as Provost upon the death of Provost Bost, there is little to record in the history of Eton College under Henry VH. 25 26 ETON COLLEGE Henry VIIL visited Eton soon after his accession, and the repute and importance of the College was shown by visits from the Duke of Buckingham, the Lord Chan- cellor Audley, and other dignitaries of State or Church. This very importance was in itself a source of danger. During the general appropriation of ecclesiastical endow- ments and revenues, which marked the establishment of the reformed religion in England, the endowments and properties of Eton College, though duly scheduled and valued, were exempted, as were those of Winchester, the two schools being regarded as part of the two Univer- sities. The danger, however, was a real one. Thomas Cromwell, the King's secretary, was only able to main- tain himself in the royal favour by supplying the King with money. Provost Lupton did his best to keep on good terms with the King and with the all-powerful arch-enemy, Cromwell. Henry\"'s appetite for the spoils of the Church was too omnivorous, his wallet too capacious, for so fat a prize as Eton College to escape. In 1531 Cromwell extorted from the College the valuable property of St. James's-in-the-Fields at Westminster, consisting of some one hundred and eighty or more acres of land \" between Charing Cross and Aye Hill.''\"' The College was allowed to retain some property in the north of London at Hampstead, and received in exchange lands in Kent and Suffolk, the value of which could never, even at that date, have been an equivalent to that of the land between London and Westminster. The College still retains the property in North London, and its value is now THE EARLY PROVOSTS 27 sufficient to make the College sadly rue the day when Pro- vost Lupton surrendered to the King the Hospital of St. James. The College, however, probably incurred further peril by falling under the royal displeasure. Edward Powell, a noted preacher at Court, had been Head-master of Eton for two or three years at the end of the fifteenth century. He took a prominent part in opposing the divorce of the King from Katherine of Arragon, and in refusing to acknowledge the royal supremacy in the Church. Powell therefore shared the fate of Sir Thomas More and Bishop Fisher on the scaffold at Smithfield. The goods and property of the College were again all duly valued and scheduled for seizure if required in the Act for the Dissolution of Colleges, Chantries, and Free Chapels at the King's Pleasure, and the endowments would have shared this fate had not the King died before he had an opportunity for carrying out his rapacious intentions. \" Ferns omnia Jupiter Argos Transtidit'''' writes sadly the author of a survey of the College property in 1545. Under Edward VI., another boy-king like the Founder, and also a reputed saint, it might have been supposed that Eton College would have been specially favoured with royal patronage. As it was, the danger of sequestration became more acute. The Protector, Edward, Duke of Somerset, and the King's other advisers were so violent and bigoted in their desire to enforce the reformed Church upon the country, that they determined in the King's name to seize and suppress all existing 28 ETON COLLEGE schools and colleges, and after purging them of any taints of monasticism which might lirjger about them, to re- establish them as new schools \" to good and godly uses,\" in which the Church could have no power. Eton and Winchester were again saved by their connection with the Universities. It may, however, be conjectured that it was the support and strenuous opposition of the nobles which saved Eton and Winchester from the boy-king''s pious desire to remodel everything upon his own little dry and narrow plan, with a neat little bust of himself over the principal entrance, as the Defender of the Faith and patron of true learning and knowledge. Though Eton was saved, the King's hand was felt heavily in the College. The dedica- tion of the College to the Virgin Mary was expunged, the Feast of the Dedication and other prominent saints' days abolished, the altars, relics, images, and other ornaments in the church destroyed or appropriated, and the library purified of all superstitious books. If the scholars and other students were to be allowed to receive their education at Eton and Cambridge in the way intended by their Founder, Edward VI. was determined that they should do so under a system of his own. During the short reign of Mary Tudor and the reprisals inflicted by the Catholic Church in return for the oppressive bigotry of the pre- ceding reign, much was restored and re])laced in the chapel, and the old ritual revived. The Provost, nomi- nated by Mary, stood high in the Queen's favour. More than one })rominent Etonian went to the stake during the miserable religious war which ensued, but the College THE EARLY PROVOSTS 29 appears to have been safer in the hands of Mary Tudor than in those of her father or brother. With the acces- sion of EHzabeth, whose view of all ecclesiastical questions was broad and liberal, Eton College was relieved from any further danger. The Queen was cautious and de- liberate in promoting the cause of the reformed religion into England, and accomplished its eventual supremacy by a policy of slow and gradual infusion, instead of a violent and polemic insistence. During this period of the history of Eton College, its outward history is mainly that of its Provosts. It has always been a contested point, whether the Founder by his statutes invested the Fellows with the right of elect- ing their own Provost, or whether this privilege was retained by the Crown. The Founder during his own lifetime certainly exercised the right of appointment to this post, and his successors on the throne claimed the same power. The Fellows always contested the claim of the Crown, and on nearly every occasion made an effort to assert and establish their right. The Crown, however, usually got its way, with the result that the Provosts of Eton for some generations, as the nominees of the Crown, were continually brought into personal contact with the sovereign. The safety of the College revenues during these checkered times may be attributed in a large degree to the influence of the Provost in person. Provost Bost undoubtedly exercised a great personal influence at the court of Edward IV. and Elizabeth Wid- vile, and later of Henry VII. and Elizabeth of York. He 30 ETON COLLEGE died on February 7, 1503, and was buried in the ante- chapel ; a monumental brass for, many years marked his grave, but was in recent years removed, incorrectly re- paired, and fixed to the wall of Lupton's Chapel. Bost was succeeded by Roger Lupton. Lupton had founded a grammar school at Sedbergh, in Yorkshire, which had been improved away by the pious Edward. He was a Fellow of the College, but it remains uncertain whether he was elected Fellow only one day prior to his election, as generally recorded, so as to enable him to hold the Provostship, or whether he may not be identical with the Roger Sutton (sic) elected Fellow in March 1488. Lupton was more remarkable for what he did than for what he was as Provost, although excuse may be made for the way in which he was harried by Secretary Cromwell. He seems to have been of a pliable disposition, and to have yielded in every way, perhaps wisely, to the pressure of cir- cumstances under Henry VIII. In July 1534 Provost Lupton and the Fellows acknowledged the royal supre- macy and repudiated the jurisdiction of the Pope. Lupton too surrendered to the King the valuable Lon- don property, alluded to before, and narrowly escaped being swallowed up himself. College, Fellows, and all their revenues, in the greedy maw of the new Defender of the Faith. Provost I^upton, however, left an enduring mark upon the College, whereby his name will ever remain linked with its history, LTp to his time the college and school-buildings had remained much in the same condition lupton's tower, from the cloisters. From a Dra-wing by Philip Norman. To face p. 30. THE EARLY PROVOSTS 31 as when left by Waynflete. The church, as has been stated, had been hastily completed by the ante-chapel in place of the projected nave; the cloister-quadrangle was complete on the north, east, and south sides, but the western side had remained unfinished. In the school quadrangle the rooms of the masters and scholars, with school-rooms beneath them, occupied a detached building on the north side. A new chamber for the boys in college is mentioned in the Audit Book for 1507-8. Perhaps Long Chamber was remodelled or rebuilt ; for although it resembles the earlier buildings of Henry VL, and seems to be certainly the room mentioned in 1468, it may have been remodelled by Provost Lupton. A new school is mentioned as built in 1514-15, the exact position of which is uncertain, Lupton's chief addition to the college buildings was the completion — begun in 1500, and finished in 1520 — of the western side of the cloister- quadrangle, forming the eastern side of the present school- yard. Externally, the chief feature was the insertion of the great square tower, known as Lupton\"'s Tower, breaking into the line of the quadrangle ; internally, his alterations involved the removal of the Provost's apart- ments to the northern part of the western side, instead of its old location with an approach from the hall, and the construction of a fine suite of apartments for the accommodation of the Visitors at Election time, and also for the College library. The large room, known as the ' Provosfs Hall,' or ' Election Hall,' seems to have been originally intended for the library. Among 32 ETON COLLEGE other minor additions to the school buildings, Lupton built at his own cost the well-known chantry in the chapel, between two of the great buttresses on the northern side towards the east end of the chapel, A rebus of his name, a hm, or barrel, bearing the letters Lup upon it, forms part of the decorations of this chantry. In this chantry Lupton himself was buried after his death at the age of eighty-three or more, in February 1540, he having resigned the Provostship some five years before. He bequeathed certain sums of money to the Foundation of Eton, to be paid on the anniversary of his death, part of which bequest still survives in the annual payment to the King''s Scholars on 'Threepenny Day,' February 27. Lupton was succeeded as Provost by a former Head-master, Robert Aldrich. Aldrich was a man of note in his day. He was an Eton man, and proceeded to King's College, Cambridge, in 1507, and became Master of Eton in 1515. As a scholar he was a friend of Erasmus, who describes him as Jiivenis hlandoc cujnsdam eloquent'ice, and, as a diplomatist, he was selected by the King as one of the Commissioners sent by Hem-y VIII. to the Pope in 1533, on the question of the divorce of Katherine of AiTagon. He was Canon of Windsor and Chancellor of the Order of the Garter, and compiled the famous Black Book of the Order, which has been kept up and continued to the present day, and is now in the custody of the Dean of Windsor. Aldrich was Almoner to Jane Seymour, and in high favour at Court. Subsequently he was made Bishop of Carlisle, THE EARLY PROVOSTS 33 and held this post jointly with the Provostship, until he resigned the latter in 1547. Aldrich was more of a courtier than a divine, and his tenure of the Provostship was more remarkable for dignity and splendour than for any tangible benefits conferred upon the College. Shortly before his resignation there was interred in the chapel the body of John Longland, Bishop of Lincoln, and in that capacity Visitor of Eton College. Longland had taken a strong personal interest in Eton, and by his will was a benefactor to the College, especially to the library. His affection for the College was shown by his direc- tions that his body should be taken there for inter- ment in the chapel, while his heart was to be buried in Lincoln Cathedral, and his entrails at Woburn, where he died in 1547. Upon the resignation of Provost Aldrich the appoint- ment fell into the hands of the Protector Somerset. It was too valuable and influential a piece of patronage to be thrown away, and Somerset did not hesitate in his decision. Although the Fellows claimed a nominal right of election, it was under a conge cVelire from the Crown. Somerset, in Edward's name, in defiance of the Founder''s statutes, requested them to elect Thomas Smith, a learned man and scholar, then Master of Requests, the King in his letter giving his special dispensation for the breach of the statute ; the said Thomas was ' not priste or doctor of divinitie.' As a matter of fact Smith seems to have been ordained a priest in 1546, and was even made Dean of Carlisle at the same time as his election to the Provostship c 34 ETON COLLEGE of Eton. Nevertheless he became Secretary of State and was knighted, and therefore had. many other interests than those of Eton to preside over. He was a devoted adherent of Somerset, and under his superintendence the College was carefully purged of its Roman Catholic ornaments and appanages. Sir Thomas Smith was married, and lived in great state in the Provost's lodge. On the strength of the Provost''s marriage some of the Fellows followed suit, in spite of the express direction in the statutes. In some ways Smith was well fitted for his post, although he seems to have never been on good terms with the Fellows. He is principally remarkable for his having introduced into England a pronunciation of Greek in accordance with the views of Erasmus. The Greek language has been pronounced accordingly at Eton and throughout England. The correctness of this pronunciation was hardly questioned until the resuscitation of Greece as a living country, and the actual use of the language as a means of conversation, showed that the pronunciation as fixed in schools was an artificial convention. When Edward VI.'s short life and reign was ended, and his sister Mary had secured the throne. Sir Thomas Smith, besides sup- porting the cause of Lady Jane Grey, held too conspicuous a post as Provost of Eton, and a zealous Reformer withal, to make it likely that he would remain unmolested, even if he was not in more actual peril. He was prudent enough to resign before any inquiry was instituted into his tenure of the Provostship and his compliance with the statutes as to priesthood and marriage. Henry THE EARLY PROVOSTS 35 Cole, Archdeacon of Ely and Canon of Westminster, was thrust upon the College as Provost, a fervent Catholic * more earnest than wise,\"\" who did his best to obliterate what he considered the ravages of the Reformers. Other- wise Cole left but little mark upon Eton. The one his- torical incident connected with his Provostship was his selection to preach the sermon at St. Mary's, Oxford, which was to precede the execution of Archbishop Cranmer, resulting in a scene which may be said to have been literally burnt into the history of the Church of England. Cole was afterwards Dean of St. PauFs, Vicar-General to Cardinal Pole, and a zealous hunter of heretics. Less prudent than Sir Thomas Smith, Cole did not resign his Provostship on the death of his patrons Queen Mary and Cardinal Pole, holding it until at last he was deprived for contumacious behaviour and com- mitted to the Fleet Prison, and to subsequent oblivion. In the rooii;* of Provost Cole the post of Provost of Eton was conferred by royal command, though ostensibly by election of the Vice-Provost and Fellows after admission as Fellow, on July 5, 1559, upon William Rill, D.D., a man of wisdom and experience, who had already been Master in succession of St. John's and Trinity Colleges at Cambridge, until the accession of Queen Mary, when he had been deprived. Provost Bill stood high in the favour of the new Queen, Elizabeth. In addition to the Provost- ship of Eton, he was appointed Dean of Westminster and Chief Almoner to the Queen, and was also restored to the Mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge. Elizabeth, 36 ETON COLLEGE moreover, entrusted to Dr. Bill the re-foundation of Henry VIIL's school at Westminster. Provost Bill Avas cautious in introducing fresh ecclesiastical changes into the great institutions under his charge, but his careful policy seems to have been the starting-point for the gradual diffusion and establishment of the Protestant faith as the dominant religious power in England. His period of office at Eton was too short to allow of any great or sweeping changes in the administration of the College. It is to be regretted that the chief action which can be attributed to him was the whitewashing of the interesting fresco-paintings in the chapel, which had escaped even the reforming zeal of Edward VI. and the Duke of Somerset. Provost Bill died in 1561. Under his easy rule the Fellows had had it much their own way, and they thought the election of a new Provost an opportunity for attempting to assert their rights. Without wait- ing for the royal command they chose and elected to be Provost Richard Bruerne, a Fellow of Eton and anon of Christ Church, but one ' of whom there is isperst very evil fame,' as his enemies alleged. The Jrown took up the challenge. By the Founder's statutes the Archbishop of Canterbury was appointed Visitor of the College in addition to the Bishop of Lincoln. Matthew Parker, then Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishop of Winchester, Home, were therefore sent down to make a visitation of the College in September 1561. The opposing forces were easily routed. Bruerne THE EARLY PROVOSTS 37 resigned, thereby escaping expulsion, and afterwards became a Canon of Windsor and Rector of Mapledurham. Three of the Fellows, Kyrton, Ashbrooke, and Pratt, with one of the chaplains, Legge, were expelled, and another, John Durston, was only allowed to remain until the ensuing Michaelmas. Several candidates were submitted by Archbishop Parker and Bishop Grindal for the Queen's considera- tion. She selected William Day, an Eton and King''s scholar, and a pronounced advocate of the reformed religion. Day, after being admitted as Fellow in order to abide by the statutes, was therefore elected Provost on December 18, 1561. Provost Day resumed the work of reform initiated under Edward VI. by Provost Sir Thomas Smith. He cleared out of the chapel any traces which still remained of the Roman Catholic ritual, including what must have been a rood-loft of particular beauty. He introduced some broad and sweeping reforms into the College estab- lishment itself. He married, although a priest, and thereby incurred for some time the Queen's displeasure. He obtained from the Queen in 1565 a very important dispensation, whereby the Fellows of the College were allowed to hold, in addition to their Fellowship, one benefice above the value of ten pounds per annum^ but not exceeding the value of fifty marks. This dispensa- tion remained a charter of liberty for the Fellows, though its actual scope was called into question and finally settled as late as 1815. Some religious observ- 38 ETON COLLEGE ances, fast becoming of an obsolete nature, were also dispensed with. Day enjoyed the advantage of having as his Vice-Provost, and as such the chief manager of the school, a man who was not only his brother-in-law, but also one of the leading Churchmen of Elizabeth's reign, William Wickham, afterwards Bishop in succes- sion of Lincoln and Winchester. Queen Elizabeth visited Eton College, and was enter- tained by Provost Day on more than one occasion. Other exalted personages were also his guests in the College. A doubtful honour was conferred on the Pro- vost when the French Ambassador, who had been placed under compulsory restraint, was lodged in the College. Much scandal and disorder ensued, and the Provost was not only grievously annoyed, but was even subjected to personal insult, by his unsought-for foreign guests. Provost Day, in spite of his Puritanism, ruled the College well. He is spoken of as ' our good old Provost,' and as affable, courteous, a good and intelligible preacher, and noted for learning as well as for piety. He held the Provostship for thirty-four years, and from 1573 the Deanery of Windsor as well. In November 1575 he was elevated to the Bishopric of Winchester, when he resigned the Provostship, but survived his new dignity only a few months. Elizabeth had some difficulty in filling the post, not, however, for want of candidates. Mr. Secretary Cecil therefore wrote in the following January to the Vice- Provost and Fellows, ordering them to suspend for a SIR HENRY SAVILE. From the Oil Painting in the Provost's Lodge, Eton College. THE EARLY PROVOSTS 39 time the election to the vacant Provostship. The most eager applicant was Henry Savile, A\\'^arden of Merton College, at Oxford, who had formerly been the Queen''s instructor in the Greek language, and stood high in her estimation. However much Elizabeth may have wished to advance Savile, she did not show the same readiness as her brother Edward to violate the Founder's statutes and appoint a Provost who was not, or was only nomi- nally, a priest. Savile, however, importuned her for the post, and eventually through the influence of the Earl of Essex and of Lord Burghley, he was successful. He was made Provost in May 1596, \"any statute, act, or canon to the contrary notwithstanding.\" Savile''s appointment was very successful. He had been a strong and severe ruler at Oxford, and brought the same system to Eton. In 1604 he entertained James I. at Eton, and was knighted by the King. Savile made Eton the centre of a learned company of scholars. Having devoted his leisure to an edition of the works of St. John Chrysostom, he determined to print it under his ovm supervision. A new range of buildings had lately been erected on the western side of the Provost's stable-yard abutting on the highroad to Slough. In this building, which still remains as one of the most picturesque in Eton, and was until lately the residence of the Head-master, Provost Savile, the 'Lay-Bishop'' as his contemporaries called him, set up his printing- press. He obtained a special fount of type from Holland known as the ' silver letter,' engaged the services of the 40 ETON COLLEGE King's printer, John Norton, and commenced his work. A few smaller Greek works were issued in addition to the famous edition of St. John Chrysostom, which was issued in eight folio volumes, and took three years to produce. Savile also had a share in the translation of the Bible, which still remains the authorised version. Under Sir Henry Savile Eton College occupied a very high position among learned societies in Europe. This was mainly due to the Provost's personal influence. Both Oxford and Eton owe much to his learning, his muni- ficence, and his wise and experienced government. It is to Savile probably that the study of Greek at Eton owes its first signs of progress, together with the intro- duction of the Greek Grammar originally compiled by William Camden the historian, and known later as the Eton Greek Grammar. Savile died at Eton on February 1621-2, and was buried there. James I. had no in- tention of letting this important piece of patronage slip through his hands. He had, in fact, promised the post to Thomas Murray, a Scotchman, who had been tutor to Charles when Prince of Wales, and whose nephew, William Murray, afterwards Earl of Dysart, is said to have acted as ' whipping - boy ' to the young prince. Murray seems to have had no particular qualifications to succeed a man like Sir Henry Savile. He was an alien moreover, had no university degree, and was no priest. The famous Lord Keeper Williams was then Bishop of Lincoln and Visitor of the College, and objected strongly to Murray's appointment. He could THE EARLY PROVOSTS 41 not, however, withstand the royal mandate, although he managed to secure the rights of the Fellows to a voice in the election. Murray, however, only retained the post into which he had thus been thrust for one year, and would have left no mark on the history of Eton College had not a fine and sumptuous Jacobean monument been erected to his memory in the Chapel, as the Collegiate Church at Eton seems to have been styled from about this date. During the illness of Provost Murray intrigues were busy and frequent with regard to his successor in this valuable post. Two prominent diplomatists, neither of them Etonians — Sir Dudley Carleton, who had married Provost Savile's step-daughter, and Sir Henry Wotton — had angled for the post before Savile's death. They again became candidates. The post had been practically promised to one Sir William Beecher, clerk of the Privy Council. The King was disposed to give it to Sir Robert Ayton, a Scotchman like Murray, who had been secretary to Queen Anne. Ayton\"'s application was addressed to James I. in verse, which may have been the origin of that sage monarch's approbation, apart from his notorious penchant for Scotchmen. Murray's widow also appears to have intimated her willingness to remain in the lodge as Lady Ayton. Other candidates were Sir Ralph Free- man, Master of Requests, who was connected by mar- riage with Buckingham, Sir Robert Naunton, Secretary of State, and Sir Albertus Morton, an Etonian, step-nephew to Sir Henry Wotton, secretary to Princess Elizabeth at 42 ETON COLLEGE Heidelberg, and clerk to the Council. Most formidable, however, of all the candidates was the great Francis Bacon, Viscount St. Albans, so sadly fallen from the high estate of Lord High Chancellor of England. That Bacon eagerly desired the post is evident from his letters to Sir Edward Conway, then Secretary of State. Bacon says that the Provostship 'were a pretty Cell for my For- tune,\"' and particularly suited to him, 'specially in the spent houreglass of such a life as myne.'' It is char- acteristic of the history of England at this moment that, among all these candidates James was unable, or did not dare, to decide in the absence of the Duke of Bucking- ham, who was then with the Prince of Wales in Spain. Bishop Williams in fact wrote himself to Buckingham, as the person in whose power wholly the nomination lay. Buckingham, however, was not going to hurry home for such a trifle, and the candidates were obliged to wait in uncertainty for Buckingham's return. Somehow or the other Sir Henry Wotton, who had aspired to the higher position of Secretary of State, importuned or cajoled Buckingham the most successfully, and obtained the Provostship, to which he was elected on June 24, 1624, nominally by royal mandate, but really by the mere favour of Buckingham. Li spite of the somewhat ignoble circumstances of the struggle for the Provostship, Sir Henry Wotton has left a fragrant memory at Eton. Wotton was in many ways the ideal English gentleman. He was an elegant scholar, and a successful dabbler in literature. As a THE EARLY PROVOSTS 43 diplomatist at Venice and elsewhere he was the precursor of the best kind of ambassador ; at V^enice especially his name is still cherished with affection. Perhaps much of the pleasant romance which surrounds Wotton's name is due to his friendship with Izaak Walton, the ' Angler/ beloved of all true Englishmen, and the inimitable biography which Walton wrote of his friend. At Black Pots, a bend in the river now desecrated by the bridge of the South- Western Railway, the two friends are said to have sat and angled, and to have written verses by the peaceful gliding river. Wotton was conscientious enough to conform to the Founder's statutes by entering holy orders. He was thus enabled, as he himself writes in a letter to Charles I., \"for the point of conscience ... to hold my place canonicall}', which I held before but dispensativelv, and withal I can exercise an archidiaconal authority annexed thereunto, though of small extent, and no benefit, yet sometimes of pious and necessary use.*\" He was also ready \" for the next good Deanery that shall be vacant by Death or Remove.\" \" I comfort myself also,\" adds Wotton, \" with this Christian hope, that Gentlemen and Knights' sons, who are trained up with us in a Seminary of Churchmen (which was the will of the Holy Founder), will by my example (without vanity be it spoken) not be ashamed, after the sight of Courtly Weeds, to put on a Surplice.\" For fifteen years Wotton held the Provostship, and exercised a kindly and fruitful influence over the College. It is impossible 44 ETON COLLEGE in these pages to do justice to the charm of Wotton''s character. Much has been written about him, and re- mains to be written still. Etonians will, however, turn to the pages of Izaak Walton, not only for the sake of Wotton himself, but also for the picture drawn therein of a Provost's life at Eton in his day. SIR HENRY WOTTON. From the Oil Pai/it/ng in the Provost's Lo/ge, Eton College. To face p. 44. Ill EARLY STATUTES, HEAD-MASTERS, AND ETONIANS Ix the original scheme for the foundation of Eton College, as stated in the first chapter, the Founder's body cor- porate consisted, according to the charter of October 1440, of \"one Provost and ten priests, four clerks and six chorister boys, who are to serve daily there in the celebration of divine worship, and of twenty-five poor and indigent scholars, who are to leani grammar ; and also of twenty-five poor and infirm men, whose duty it shall be to pray there continually for our health and welfare so long as we live, and for our soul when we shall have departed this life, and for the souls of the illustrious Prince, Henry, our father, late King of England and France, also of the Lady Katherine, of most noble memory, late his wife, our mother, and for the souls of all our ancestors, and of all the faithful, who are dead ; and also of one master, or teacher in grammar, whose duty it shall be to instruct in the rudiments of grannnar the said indigent scholars, and all others whatsoever who may come together from any part of our kingdom of England to the said College, gi'atuitously, and without the exaction of money or any other thing.\" 45 46 ETON COLLEGE It will be seen from this charter that the provision of education for the boys of other than indigent persons was provided for by the Founder simultaneously from his first intention. Edward Hall, the chronicler, says that Henry VL \" founded a solempne school at Eton, a towne next unto Wyndesore, in the which he hath established a college of sad priestes, with a greet nombre of children, whiche bee there of his coste frankely and freely taught the eruditaments and rules of grammer/'' Henry VI. lost no time in making nominations to his new foundation, for in the Papal Bull, which immediately ensued, the following names are given : — Pr-ovost — Henry Sever. Vice-Provost — John Kette, late Rector of Eton. Priest-Felloics — William Haston and William Dene. Clerks — Gilbert Grese and John Mondjoy (?). Choristers — Roger Flecknowe, William Kent, John Halywyn alias Grey, Henry Cokkes. Scholars — William Stokke, Richard Cokkes. Bedesmen — John Burdon and John de Evesham. As no name is mentioned of a Magister or Informator, it may be assumed that the appointment had not been made. Subsequently, as stated before, the Founder re- modelled his body corporate on the lines of that at Winchester, acting no doubt under the advice of Thomas of Bekynton, an old AVykehamist, and of William of Waynflete, who left the Head-mastership of Winchester to take up that of Eton, and brought with him Fellows EARLY STATUTES, HEAD-MASTERS, ETC. 47 and Scholars to form the nucleus of the new foundation. The statutes first drawn up in 1443, and added to from time to time during the ensuing years, were obviously based, both as regards Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, on the statutes of William of AVykeham for AVinchester College and New College, Oxford. They provide for a Provost, ten Priest-Fellows (from whom a Vice-Provost, precentor, sacristan, and two bursars were to be chosen), ten chaplains, ten clerks, sixteen choristers, a Head-master {maglster or hiformator)^ an Usher {ostiarius), seventy poor scholars, twenty commensales, and thirteen bedesmen. The scholars were to be bovs of good character and decent life — poor and needy, with a competent knowledge of reading Donahts (the Latin grammar of the period) — and plain song, and to be not less than eight years old, or more than twelve, except specially well-read boys, who might be received up to the age of seventeen. They were to be chosen, in the first place, from natives of the parishes in which either Eton College or King's College held property, and then from natives of the counties of Buckingham and Cambridge, failing all of which they might be chosen from all English-born subjects. The choristers of both Eton and King's had a preferential claim to election. The scholars were all destined for the service of the Church, but special care was taken to prevent the College from falling under any monastic influence. They received yearly a gown and hood, intended to last three years, and also clothing and bedding up to a charge of a hundred marks a year for all 48 ETON COLLEGE of them, including the choristers. In addition to other regulations, each scholar had to swear that he did not possess more than five marks a year. In conformity with the arrangements at Winchester and Oxford, the Founder re-modelled his college at Cambridge to admit of a regular progression of scholars from Eton to King's College. In order to cement the fusion of the two foundations, two Fellows of King\"'s College — William Hatcliffe (afterwards Secretary to Edward IV.) and William Towne — were brought to Eton, incorporated as Fellows of Eton College by Waynflete, and then proceeded immediately by election to King''s College, Cambridge, thus inaugurating a procession of scholars from Eton to King's, which has continued with but slight intermissions up to the present day. The number of scholars, seventy, remains the same ; and the boys were known as King's Scholars as early as 1621, although it is genei'ally stated that they were so styled at the wish of King George III. The next three scholars elected to King's were part of the Wykehamist contingent which accompanied Waynflete to Eton. In his provision for the admission of Commeiisales, or Commoners, the Founder was unconsciously taking a step fraught Avith the greatest importance for English history. The idea was again borrowed from Winchester. Henry had been brought up as a boy with the sons of the nobility, who were of his own age. He was not likely to neglect their interest. AVhen performing the pious duties of charity, religion, and education, he added a provision EARLY STATUTES, HEAD-MASTERS, ETC. 49 for those who did not recjuire the former, but were in no less need of assistance in the other matters. Twenty sons of nobles, or of special friends of the College, were to be allowed to sleep and board in the College, and be free from any charges beyond their instruction in grammar. That these were boys of the highest rank and station is evident from the statement of John Blakeman, one of the earliest Fellows of Eton, that Henry, though he not unfrequently met and exhorted the Eton scholars in Windsor Castle, still disapproved of their coming to Court on account of the vicious tone of morals which then pre- vailed. An inferior class of commoners were also to be admitted, who were to dine in hall with the scholars and choristers, and to receive their instruction gi*atuitously. Beyond this, according to the statutes of 1440, instruc- tion was to be given to any other scholar who might resort thither from any part of England. Provision was thus made from the outset for the instruction of students of independent means, who, under the name of oppidani or town boys, have now increased in such numbers as to form the real body of the school, and at the present day have annexed and absorbed a large portion of the College revenues for their own use. Mention has already been made of the Head-master- ships of William of Waynflete and his successor, William Westbury, of their successions to the Provostship, and of the debt owed to them by the college and the school. At the time of the installation of Waynflete as Provost, in December 21, 1443, before Bishop Bekynton D 50 ETON COLLEGE Fellows. \\ Clerks. and the Earl of Suffolk, as Commissaries to the King, the following names appear on the foundation, in addi- tion to the Provost : — John Clerc, Vice-Provost. Thomas Harlowe Thomas Weston WiUiam Weye John Bouer John Godston John Moddyng Thomas Constantine\\ John Payne Thomas Saye Thomas Siggefeld John Goldsmith Edward Hancock Richard Fawley William Stok William Walker John Plente John Browne ^Scholars. Six of these scholars were elected to King's College, Cambridge, in the following year. Two of the scholars elected to King's in 1445 — Edmund Hampden (afterwards D.D.) and Roger Flecknowe — appear to have been choristers on the foundation at Eton, and therefore eligible for scholarships at either college. One of the above-mentioned Fellows, William Weye, desiring to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, obtained a special license from the Founder to be absent from the ^ c o u 5'- -^ o ^ as •£ - S U 5 EARLY STATUTES, HEAD-MASTERS, ETC. 51 college, and at the same time to enjoy all the fruits and benefits of his position. The King's original license to Weye for this ' Peregrinage ' and \" blessed Purpos and Entent,\" \"given under oure Signet at oure Castell of Kenehvorth,\" is still preserved at Eton College. An interesting record was kept by Weye of his pilgrimage. By the statutes of 1443 the Head-master {mag'ister hiformatur, ludhfiaguier) was to be appointed by the Provost and Fellows, to be a man of good character, skilled in grammar and teaching, unmarried, and, if possible, a Master of Arts. He was to instruct the scholars, choristers, and other boys coming to the school, and to have leave to punish them in moderation. Under him was the Usher (ostiariiis), later to be known as the Lower Master, who was to be a layman, unmarried, and, if possible, a Bachelor of Arts. Both received a salary, their connnons, and cloth for their gowns, but they were not allowed to make any charge for instruction. The Head-master and Usher both resided in the school build- ings on the northern side of the schoolyard. The scholars, and a})parently the choristers also, all slept in one long dormitory on the upper floor, with the rooms of the Master and the Usher at either end, the former at the western end, the latter at the eastern, and one schoolroom on the ground floor was sufficient for working purposes. Of Westbury's immediate successors in the Head- mastership little is known beyond their names. Clement Smyth, however, who was Head-niaster of Eton from 1453 to 1457, when he became a Fellow, became Head- 52 ETON COLLEGE master of Winchester, a})parently a more profitable post at the time, in 1462. During, however, the crisis in the history of the College in the days of Edward IV. he returned to Eton in 1464, and for six years supported Provost Westbury in his efforts to save the College from destruction. His successor, John Peyntour, elected to King's in 1467, was the first Head-master of Eton educated at the school itself. The next Head-master of interest was William Horman, a Wykehamist, who was Head-master of Eton from 1484 to 1495. Horman was a prolific writer of school-books, one of which was printed by the celebrated printer R. Pynson, under the title of V^il^aria Puerorum, and was doubtless a text- book in use in school at Eton. Several allusions are made in this work to the study of Greek. A controversial work by Horman, entitled Antibosskon, played some part in the religious literary quarrels of his day. Horman exchanged his post at Eton for a similar one at Win- chester, but became Fellow of Eton in 1502, and from 1525 to 1534 was Vice-Provost, dying in 1535, almost a century old. His successor, Edward Powell, only held the post a few months, leaving it for a Fellowship at Oriel College, Oxford. Subsequently he made himself too con- spicuous in his support of Cardinal Fisher and others in resisting the King's will, and found his way to the most elevated position perhaps ever held by a Head-master of Eton, by being hanged, drawn, and quartered on the scaffold at Smithfield. For several years to come the Head-masters at Eton EARLY STATUTES, HEAD-MASTERS, ETC. 53 left but little mark on the history of the College. Some were Wykehamists, one of whom, Thomas Erlys- man, in 1515, left Eton for Winchester. His suc- cessor, however, Robert Aklrich, raised the post to some distinction. Aklrich had known Erasmus at Cam- bridge, and kept up a correspondence with him in after years. It was, however, as Provost that Aklrich looms largest in the history of Eton, to which fact allusion has already been made. Under Richard Coxe, who was appointed Head-master in 1528, Eton College seems to have first reached high repute as a school. Old Fuller, in his Worthies of' England , says that the school \" was happy, with many flourishing wits under his endeavours.\" Coxe was a zealous Lutheran and Reformer. In later days he became tutor to Edward VI. and Dean of Christ Church. Elizabeth made him Bishop of Ely, and throughout his life he played a conspicuous part in Church history. His successor, Nicholas U^dall, another Wykehamist, had a very curious career and very varied reputation. He became Head-master at the age of twentv-eight, havinjr published an edition of Terence, a stock subject in school. In the preface to Roger Ascham's ScJiolemaster, a former scholar of Eton describes Udall as \" the best scholemaster and the greatest beater of our time.\" He published a selection from the plays of Terence, which was long used as a school-book at Eton. A curious chance connected with UdalTs Head-mastership has gained him a niche in the history of English literature. The Eton scholars from a very early date were 54 ETON COLLEGE accustomed to give theatrical performances usually at Christmas. They were superintended by the Head-master, and Udall, who had a literary gift, appears to have written small pieces to be acted by his scholars. One of these, a short comedy called Ralph Roister Do'ister, has accidentally been preserved, the only copy known being in the College Library, and is the earliest English comedy at present known, although such comedies had been in existence for many years. Udall, however, got involved, much to his discredit, in a scandal connected with a robbery of silver plate and other misdemeanours committed in 1541 by two Eton boys of good family. The Head-master of Eton and father of English comedy found himself in the Marshalsea Prison, where he spent a short but miserable time. As might be expected he was removed from his post. After his release Udall took to translating the works of Erasmus, besides pleading his innocence and repentance, gained the patronage of Edward VL and the Protector Somerset, and mirabile dictii he managed to end his life as Head-master of Westminster School. His successors had short careers until the appointment in 1546 of William Barker, who successfully defied the Founder's statutes by marrying. This scandalised many good folk, who attributed to the Head-master several cognate vices, such as riotous living and gaming. The only fault, however, which seems to have been discoverable against Barker was, that \" he is sumwhat to gentle, and gyvethe his scholears more licence, thane they have byn usid too before tyme \" ; and EARLY STATUTES, HEAD-MASTERS, ETC. 55 what Eton boy is there who would think of imputing this to a Head-master as a crime? Barker was Head-master during the 'purification' of the College under Edward VI., and managed to continue his post as Master during the ' revival \"\" under Mary. He resigned in the summer of 1555. It is uncertain who actually succeeded him, but in 1561 the post was held by an Etonian and Fellow of King's, William Malim. In the Founder's original statutes it was laid down that the scholars were to have a competent knowledge of reading, Donatus, and plain-song. Music had formed part of the curriculum in all or most educational estab- lishments in the Middle Ages. There is, however, a special interest in noting the elaborate arrangements made by the Founder for the study of music and the use of music at the services in the Collegiate Church. The choristers were to be sixteen in number and under twelve years of age, to sing in church and serve the priests at the daily masses. Of the four clerks, one was to be organist and instructor of the choristers. There was also to be a parish clerk, chosen, if possible, from among the scholars of the school, who was to be skilled in Sarum use and in singing. The choristers, as stated before, had a preferential right to vacant scholarships. The provisions for musical education are noteworthy, because at this date the English school of Music, of which John of Dunstable was the leading exponent, was the most im- portant in Europe, and had a lasting and widespread influence on the ensuing and better -known schools of 56 ETON COLLEGE music in Italy and Germany. In the college library there is preserved an interesting volume of manuscript music, evidently used at singing-schools in the church. The compositions are all by English musicians, and some of the composers were Scholars or Fellows of Eton itself. One piece is signed by Robert Hacombleyn, afterwards a well-known Provost of King's. The volume can be dated by internal evidence to the time of Provost Bost, 1477-1503, and is a most interesting relic of musical history at this date. Latin seems to have been the subject princi})ally taught in school, both translation and composition. The earliest mention of the life and work of an Eton boy is not, as might have been expected, that of a scholar on the foundation, but that of an oppidan, William Paston. Young Paston writes to his brother from Eton two letters on November 7, 1478, and Feb- ruary 23, 147 1, concerning money to be paid for his board, and to his ' creanser,' Thomas Stevenson, who seems to have been his tutor, and to be identical with the Thomas Stevenson who was elected a Fellow in the following July. His letter is mainly concerned with his desire to marry a young lady of Eton, to whom he was deeply attached, and of whose beauty he was assured, although he had some doubt about the thickness of her hands. William Paston was more precocious in love- making than in writing Latin verses, for he laments the little progress he makes in them, and sends his brother a specimen, which bears out his statement. Latin verses, EARLY STATUTES, HEAD-MASTERS, ETC. 57 therefore, seem to have been a staple of education at Eton from the earliest days. Boys who groan at the end of the nineteenth century at the tyranny of Latin verses can comfort their minds that for four hundred years most Eton boys have done the same. These boys were, as stated before, oppidans or commcn- sak'S, of whom we learn from a biographer of Henry VI. that \" when King Henry met some of the students in Windsor Castle, whither they sometimes used to go to visit the King's servants, whom they knew, on ascertain- ing who they were he admonished them to follow the path of virtue, and besides his words would give them money to win over their good-will, saying to them, ' Be good boys, be gentle and docile, and servants of the Lord.'\" It is not, however, until the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth that any light is thrown on the internal life and economy of the scholars on the foundation at Eton. It will be remembered that upon the death of Provost Bill in 1561, the Fellows proceeded to ignore the right of nonn' nation held by the Crown, and to elect Richaixl Bruerne to be Provost on their own account. This roused the anger of both the Court and the Church, and brought upon the College a visitation under Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, in person. Among the manu- scripts bequeathed by Archbishop Parker to Corpus Col- lege, Cambridge, is one which was probably drawn up in view of the intended visitation. In many of the medieval monastic institutions a daily 58 ETON COLLEGE rule, or Consuetudinarium, was drawn up, to regulate the daily life and work of the members of the community throughout the year. Such a Consuetudinarium was drawn up in 1561, either by William Malim, the Head-master, in view of the Archbishop\"'s visitation, or possibly for him, as a guide to him on entering upon his new duties. The whole forms a most interest- ing insight into the life of a schoolboy at that date. It is divided into two sections, the first containing the customs to be observed at different seasons of the year, detailed month by month, the second describing the daily routine of school life. Taking the Consuetndinarmm as it comes, and begin- ning with a calendar of the months, the boys are found at school on the first day of January, but not at regular work. On New Year's day the boys play for the inter- change of small gifts {stremils), and compose verses of a complimentary nature, which they send either to the Provost or Master, or other masters, or bandy to and fro among themselves. Work began again on the day after the Epiphany, strcnue vel invitis animis. On the 13th William of Waynflete was commemorated, and each boy received twopence. On or about the Conversion of St. Paul the annual procession, ad niontem, took place, a festival which will be specially noticed elsewhere. In February took place the commemoration of Provost Bost on the 7th. On the Monday (die Lvnce Carnisprivii) before Lent the boys composed verses in praise of Bacchus or the contrary, and in any metre ; the compositions of the EARLY STATUTES, HEAD-MASTERS, ETC. 59 boys in the three upper forms were fixed to the lower shutter of the college. Bacchus w'as regarded as the patron of all poets, and in this custom there may have lingered some traces of the old Dionysiac festival to celebrate the approach of spring. On Shrove Tuesday a curious custom prevailed : the cook came and tied a pancake to a crow at the door of the school, according to the saying, Piillis corvorum invocantihus eum. It was the custom in England on Shrove Tuesday to indulge in many sports and pranks corresponding in some way to the Carnival of the Catholic Church, Cock-fighting was indulged in in many places. Football also was played and tolerated in the streets. The connection between the pancake, the well-known attribute of Shrove Tuesday, and the crow is an obvious allusion to the approaching fast, as indicated by the quotation from the 147th Psalm, \" Who giveth fodder to the cattle, and feedeth the young ravens that call upon him.\"\" On Ash Wednesday the boys all went, collegers and oppidans alike, to church at ten o'clock and selected priests, to whom they made con- fession of their sins, the next four days being spent in penitence. This ordinance was, however, erased either by the Head-master, Malim, himself, or by order of the Commissioners. On February 27 Provost Lupton was commemorated, and the boys received one penny each. In March the only event was the Feast of the Annuncia- tion, when the Head-master might give a holiday if he chose. In April the chief ordinances arc for Holy Week and Easter. On Wednesday in Holy Week ordinary 60 ETON COLLEGE work was set aside, and lessons in writing given. This must have been in the finer and more elaborate forms of writing, and leading to a kind of freehand drawing. Those boys learnt to write who could not yet paint cleverly ; but those who could do anything elegantly with the hand, drew figures and offered them as models to their comrades. On the Thursday in Holy Week, in addition to certain services in church, certain boys who had been selected to communicate in church were allowed to roam about the country out of bounds, provided that they did not enter any wine or beer shop. On Good Friday, after a writing lesson and morning prayer in the church, the boys assembled for an oration, given by the principal monitor of the school, and addressed chiefly to the elder boys, upon the Holy Eucharist. On the Saturday writing lessons and prayers were the order of the day, but the boys went to bed early, in order that they might get up at daybreak on Easter day. It had been the custom for four of the older scholars to watch the Holy Sepulchre throughout the night with tapers and torches lest the Jews should steal the Lord''s body, or (as it is more rationally and quaintly put) rather that no accident should happen through neglect of the burning lights. This custom seems, how- ever, to have fallen into neglect. On May Day (the Feast of St. Philip and St. James), if the Head-master gave permission, and if the day was moist, they might rise early and collect boughs of May blossom, and decorate with them the windows of the THE LONG WALK, ETON COLLEGE, WITH THE CHAPEL.

They were also encouraged to extol the spring- in rhymed or English verse, as well as in selections from the Latin poets. On the Feast of St. John, ante Portani Latinam, the boys had a holiday, and a 'long lie' or sleep after dinner in school, until they were summoned to hall, ad merendam. Football, also, was probably in- dulged in, as a current saying ran as follows : — Porta Latina pilum, pulviuar, pocula prsestat. This day seems to have inaugurated a similar"
