        "text": "South Orange, N.J. -- Seton Hall men's basketball great and former assistant coach Donald Copeland '06 has led the Wagner Seahawks to the 2024 NEC men's basketball championship by winning three consecutive road games with just seven healthy players.\n\nIn his second season at the helm of the Seahawks, Copeland joins fellow Seton Hall point guards Dan Hurley '96 (UConn) and Shaheen Holloway '00 (Saint Peter's) as former Pirates that have won postseason tournaments as head coaches the last three seasons. Seton Hall has five alumni currently serving as head coaches in Division I men's college basketball; Holloway (Seton Hall), Hurley, Copeland, Levell Sanders (Binghamton), Grant Billmeier (NJIT). The Pirates' five alumni head coaches trails only Duke (6) for the most of any Division I program.\n\nCopeland is assisted at Wagner by fellow Pirate and longtime staffer Kevin Lynch, who's in his second season alongside Copeland. Lynch was on former head coach Kevin Willard's staff for nine seasons. As the Coordinator of Basketball Operations for the Pirates, Lynch assisted with the day-to-day operations of the program, which included practice and game day preparation. During Lynch's tenure at Seton Hall, the Pirates amassed a record of 177-111 and earned five NCAA Tournament appearances. During the 2022 season, Lynch served alongside Copeland on the Pirates' staff.\n\nLynch joined the Seton Hall program as a walk-on for the 2013-14 campaign and appeared in four games for the Pirates while also garnering Big East Academic All-Star status. He previously spent three years as the manager of the Seton Hall women's basketball team in which he served as video coordinator and organized practice and gameday operations.\n\nAt Seton Hall, Copeland appeared in 108 career games for the Pirates, and his 754 career points currently rank him 79th all-time in program history. He helped The Hall reach the NCAA Tournament in both 2004 and 2006, and in his senior season in 2006, he more than doubled his scoring output from the previous season and ended up leading the Pirates in scoring (16.1 PPG), assists (4.5 APG), steals (1.4 SPG), three-pointers made (71) and free throw percentage (.844).\n\nIn 2006, Copeland graduated Seton Hall with a degree in communications and media studies, was a second-team All-BIG EAST and All-Met Writers selection and was voted Seton Hall's Senior Male Athlete of the Year.\n\nBefore accepting a full scholarship at Seton Hall, Copeland played for legendary head coach Bob Hurley, Sr. at St. Anthony, helping lead the Friars to New Jersey State Championships in 2001 and 2002, with the latter team ranking No, 2 in the nation. He earned first-team All-State and first-team All-Tri-State honors following his senior season of 2001-02."
