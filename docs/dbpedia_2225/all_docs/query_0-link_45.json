Scene Magazine said of AXIS, \"the directorial debut of Aisha Tyler is a revelation... brilliant in every way.\" And Paste Magazine wrote: \"to make a film this experimental, this compelling, your first time out as a director is just extraordinary.\" AXIS was released wide in 2018 and is available everywhere on multiple VOD platforms.\n\nAisha has directed several episodes of television, including Fear the Walking Dead (2015), Roswell, New Mexico (2019), and Criminal Minds (2005), where she made her television directing debut.

With lead roles in 75 feature films and television programs, she can also be seen in the award-winning documentary Who Killed the Electric Car? (2006).\n\nInternationally recognized for her 5-year starring role as \"Lt. Stephanie Holden\" in the hit series Baywatch (1989), Alexandra began her acting career in 1982 at age 18, starring in the highly rated telefilm Paper Dolls (1982). She was then cast in studio flicks like Stephen King's Christine (1983); American Flyers (1985) opposite Kevin Costner; 8 Million Ways to Die (1986) opposite Jeff Bridges and Andy Garcia; Dragnet (1987) opposite Tom Hanks and Dan Aykroyd, and Spy Hard (1996) with Leslie Nielsen.\n\nAlexandra hosted the extreme sports series Wild Waters on the Outdoor Life Network for 4 years, and hosted the WE network series Winning Women for two seasons. She co-hosted 150 episodes of the environmental TV talk show Earth Talk Today through 2008.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Alexandra had regular roles in several television series: Baywatch (1989), Fox's Fire Co 132, Daytona Beach (pilot), and the last 8 episodes on Melrose Place (1992). She also filmed two movies in war-torn Croatia with Pierce Brosnan and did many independent films. In the first decade of the 21st Century, Alexandra starred in 11 movies on Lifetime Movie Network. She also played a lesbian 4 times, opportunities she appreciates since her identical twin sister is gay.\n\nIn 2006, she shot 6 films, including a cameo in Borat:Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, and although her part was edited out, she remains in the DVD extras.\n\nFrom 2010 - 2017, Alexandra has shot independent movies and an online series. She is producing 2 movies, a movie based on the book Free The Animals with her producing partner, Nik Tyler; and The B Team, an action comedy starring 8 of her Baywatch castmates.\n\nActor and singer-songwriter Alicia Witt has been acting since the age of 7, when she made her film debut in David Lynch's sci-fi classic Dune. She will next be seen starring opposite Nicholas Cage in the thriller Longlegs, set for a 2024 worldwide theatrical release. She also just appeared on Fox's The Masked Singer as Dandelion, winning her first episode with her rendition of Over The Rainbow. Recent sightings include psychological drama Fuzzy Head (2023); I Care A Lot (2021) on Netflix, starring Rosamund Pike and Dianne Wiest; as a killer in Lifetime Network's true crime drama The Disappearance of Cari Farver (2022) and as Zelda on the final season of Orange Is The New Black.\n\nAlicia is also a familiar face to Christmas audiences for her 10 holiday movies, many of which have featured her original music and continue to air every year.\n\nWitt spent 5 weeks in the Billboard Top 30 AC Radio chart with her single Chasing Shadows, off her 2021 album The Conduit, which she co-produced alongside Jordan Lehning and Bill Reynolds. Her newest release is 2023's Witness, led by the title track, which debuted in April. A classically trained former competitive pianist, Alicia's music has been described as 'sharply personal, boldly melodic pop originals in the Carole King/Billy Joel vein' and 'touching lost-and-found love ballads' (Philadelphia Inquirer).\n\nWitt's many films include Two Weeks' Notice, Last Holiday, The Upside of Anger, Mr. Holland's Opus, Urban Legend, Four Rooms, 88 Minutes, Vanilla Sky, and Fun, for which she was awarded the Special Jury Recognition Award from the Sundance Film Festival, and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.\n\nAlicia received rave reviews for her role as Paula in Season 6 of AMC's critically acclaimed series The Walking Dead. Witt also appeared during Season 4 of ABC's 'Nashville' as country star Autumn Chase and in Season 3 of David Lynch's Twin Peaks on Showtime, reprising her role from the original as Gerstein Hayward. Other TV includes FOX's The Exorcist; Law & Order: Criminal Intent; The Mentalist; Friday Night Lights; The Sopranos; Cybill; Ally McBeal; and Twin Peaks.\n\nAlicia has performed her original piano-driven pop music all over the world, including at the renowned Grand Ole Opry. She has also opened for Ben Folds Five, Rachel Platten, and Jimmy Webb, to name a few. Her 2018 release, 15000 Days, was produced by Grammy-winning producer Jacquire King (James Bay, Norah Jones, Kings of Leon, Dawes). Witt's previous album, Revisionary History, was produced by Ben Folds and was hailed as 'Grey Seal era Elton John, an alt-universe Fiona Apple, and a film noir chanteuse notching her nights in cigarette burns on the fallboard' (Nashville Scene).\n\nWitt's first book, Small Changes, came out in Fall 2021 from Harper Horizon. The book is an inspiring, welcoming and simple yet effective guide to health, happiness and sustainable living. Instead of promoting a rigid diet, Small Changes offers readers a stress-and-judgment-free approach for enacting easy, incremental changes across all areas of life.\n\nOn stage, Witt starred in Neil LaBute's Tony nominated play Reasons to Be Pretty at the Geffen Playhouse. She also appeared at London's Royal Court theatre in Terry Johnson's Piano/Forte and made her West End debut with The Shape of Things. She has performed at Williamstown Theatre Festival and has made many appearances in the 24-Hour Plays on Broadway and the 24-Hour Musicals off-Broadway."
