Provenance: Estate of Michael Jaffé (1923-1997) art historian and former director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Born in London, Michael was educated at Wagner's and at Eton College. Jaffé's undergraduate studies were delayed for four years by World War II, during which time he served in the RNVR. He came up to King's College, Cambridge in 1945, studying History before changing to English, in which subject he got a First. He became President of the Marlowe Society, and was editor of Granta while a student. After Cambridge, he studied art history at the Courtauld Institute, where he attended Johannes Wilde's lectures and had access to the Seilern Collection; this was followed by research at Harvard on Rubens and his contemporaries. He became a Fellow of King's College in 1952, holding the position until his death; was appointed as Cambridge University's only Assistant Lecturer in Fine Arts in 1956; and began undergraduate teaching in the subject. He held the post for four years until going to Washington University in St. Louis in 1960, where he was briefly Professor of Renaissance Art until returning to Cambridge University in 1961, when he was appointed Lecturer in Fine Arts. In 1968 he was appointed Reader in History of Western Art, and he became Head of Department of History of Art in 1970, a position he held until 1973 and his appointment to the Directorship of the Fitzwilliam Museum. Jaffé married Patricia Milne-Henderson in 1964, and they had two sons and two daughters. Jaffé owned the country house Clifton Maybank near Yeovil in Somerset. He was appointed a CBE in 1989. He died on 13 July 1997. A bronze portrait bust of Jaffé by Elisabeth Frink is in the Fitzwilliam. Comes with a handwritten note written in pencil on an index card by Patricia Jaffé: 'Thomas Couture-Interior of a kitchen signed 'T.C.'. Diary 3 April 1960 'A French genre painter, 'TC', small interior: good examples in the Louvre: half the oeuvre lost in a fire in Chicago: Louvre tried to buy this particular work of Michael's: very popular artist in the US. Given to me by Michael for my first birthday (8.05.65) after we were married.' Thomas Couture (21 December 1815 – 30 March 1879) was a French history painter and teacher. He taught such later luminaries of the art world as Édouard Manet, Henri Fantin-Latour, John La Farge, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Karel Javurek, and J-N Sylvestre. Couture was born at Senlis, Oise, France. When he was 11 his family moved to Paris, where he would study at the industrial arts school (École des Arts et Métiers) and later at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1879 he died at Villiers-le-Bel, Val-d'Oise, and was interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. Delivery to you within the Uk is included in the asking price.
