        "text": "The body recovered early Tuesday morning from a retention pond off Wildwood Drive is that of 20-year-old Arthur Charles Wagner III who was reported missing and endangered Saturday.\n\nFamily members told police that Wagner had recently made threats to harm himself. The St. Johns County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed to The Record on Tuesday afternoon that the deceased had been identified as Wagner. The cause of death was listed as drowning.\n\nAccording to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office, investigators narrowed their search to the pond after dirt bike tracks were spotted in a neighbor's yard, leading to the water's edge.\n\n\"There were indications that the motorcycle may have vaulted into the pond,\" Chuck Mulligan, a spokesperson for the Sheriff's Office, told The Record.\n\nAnother indicator was a \"light sheen\" of what appeared to be petroleum oil on the surface of the pond, suggesting the bike could be underneath, Mulligan said.\n\nWagner was last spotted on a yellow dirt bike near Wildwood Drive Saturday evening.\n\nDivers called in by the Sheriff's Office made the discovery of the body at about 5 a.m. Tuesday. The motorcycle was retrieved some time later.\n\nMulligan said foul play is not suspected at this time but that the investigation is ongoing. A toxicology report will not be returned for several weeks but Mulligan said there was \"no indication that that was a factor.\"\n\nAccording to Mulligan, \"It was reported to us by family that there were issues going on in his life that caused him some distress and the manner in which he left [Saturday] was concerning.\"\n\nFriends and family took to Facebook after the news was made public Tuesday to post messages and memories about Wagner who was known as \"Artie.\" A spokesperson with the St. Johns County School District said records indicate Wagner had attended the public schools previously but that those records end sometime in 2016."
