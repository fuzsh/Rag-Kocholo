        "text": "Rose Janet Wagner, 84, of New Franklin passed away Tuesday, April 11 after a short hospitalization. She was born on November 16, 1932 in Richwood, West Virginia. Janet moved to the Akron area with her family when her father came to work at Goodyear Aircraft in support of the war effort during WW II. She met her husband, Arthur, while attending Manchester High School. They were married in 1952 during Arthur’s senior year at Baldwin-Wallace University. Janet worked for several companies during her extensive career principally with Firestone and Goodyear. She ended her career working for Franklin Township and stayed on through the transition to the City of New Franklin. She was a key volunteer at the Tudor House for many years. She accompanied her husband to Norway during his five-year posting for Goodyear Aerospace. Janet immersed herself in the culture and made many Norwegian friends. She took advantage of the ease of travel in Europe making trips with American and Norwegian women’s groups to countries in Western and Eastern Europe as well as the Middle East. She is survived by her husband Arthur; sons, Jeffrey and Richard (Carol) and grandchildren, Alison Bloom (Chuck) and Matthew Wagner (Morgan). Calling Hours will be held SATURDAY, April 15, 2017 at the Swigart-Easterling Funeral Home, 624 E. Cherry St. (Rt. 93) Canal Fulton from 10am to 11am, with a short funeral service to follow at 11 AM, her nephew Jim Gindlesberger officiating. Interment at Manchester Cemetery.\n\nService Information"
