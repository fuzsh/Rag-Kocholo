        "text": "Designed to support accurate, meaningful teaching about the Holocaust, the Belfer National Conference for Educators is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s flagship event for secondary school educators across the country.\n\nThe conference invites participants to engage with current historical research and instructional best practices. Educators discover and learn how to use various classroom resources, find inspiration in new ideas, and connect with peers engaged in similar work across the United States and worldwide.\n\nInformation about the 2025 Belfer National Conference will be available in January. For details about the 2024 Belfer National Conference, visit the conference page.\n\nOn-Demand Belfer Videos\n\nThe short videos, produced by Museum educators and historians provide guidance on how to teach about the Holocaust. The videos explain how educators can use Museum-created resources with their students. These resources include classroom-ready lessons and digital learning tools. The videos also cover guidelines for teaching about the Holocaust, appropriate pedagogy, and classroom strategies.\n\nHear What Educators Who Have Attended Belfer Are Saying\n\n“The uniqueness of Belfer is the combination of vetted classroom-ready resources and the exposure to a variety of world-class historians and museum professionals.”\n\n“In 15 years of teaching middle and high school ELA, this conference is, by far, the BEST professional development that I have been privileged to attend.”\n\n“The resources, the people, and the experiences! The opportunity to learn from museum staff and educators is a MUST-do opportunity, especially being virtual—no travel, no arrangements to be made, no expenses.”"
