        "text": "The field of pediatric oncology offers a tremendous opportunity to improve the lives of cancer patients through the discovery, development, and compassionate administration of treatment. It is a privilege to journey alongside these patients and their families, and I learn from them each day. It is also a privilege to work with a dedicated and talented team of physicians and other medical staff as we try to comprehensively address the needs of our patients. Although I see a variety of children with cancer or blood diseases, my research focus is in sarcoma, which are tumors of connective tissue such as bone or muscle. Collaboration is necessary for progress, and my goal is to work with other clinicians and researchers at Duke Health and across the country to provide the very best treatment and support for the patients who have been entrusted to our care."
