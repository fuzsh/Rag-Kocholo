        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nFor many, the fiery demise last week of Yevgeny Prigozhin was the chronicle of a death foretold, after his mutiny two months ago against his benefactor, Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut Prigozhin and his mercenary army, the Wagner Group, were an important expeditionary force for the Kremlin, especially across parts of Africa.\n\nNick Schifrin looks at, what now?\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nBut the Kremlin apparently did not forgive Prigozhin's betrayal.\n\nThis weekend, a Wagner fighter filmed a cemetery of Wagner fighters killed in Ukraine dismantled by Russian authorities, just as President Vladimir Putin is dismantling and apparently decapitated Wagner's empire.\n\nThat empire was vast, especially in Africa, where independent researchers say Wagner has dispatched 5,000 people to about a dozen countries to spread Moscow's influence and feed instability.\n\nIn the Central African Republic, Wagner fighters openly walked alongside local bodyguards to help Faustin-Archange Touadera win a referendum that could extend his power indefinitely.\n\nIn Mali, where crowds have celebrated cooperation with Russia, Wagner is a key partner to the head of the military junta that seized power in 2020. And in Burkina Faso after a coup, Wagner moved in as military officials evicted French troops and called Russia a strategic partner.\n\nBut in July in St. Petersburg, during a Russia-Africa summit, it was Putin, not Prigozhin, pictured next to each of these leaders. And General Andrey Averyanov of Russian military intelligence was reportedly introduced is taking over for Prigozhin in Africa.\n\nIn his final days, Prigozhin was afraid of losing his influence in Africa and released this final personal statement, even as Russian officials work to maintain the empire he built without him.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nThe Kremlin spokesman said today no decision had been made yet on whether Putin would attend Prigozhin's funeral.\n\nFor more on what becomes of Wagner operations in Africa, we turn to Vanda Felbab-Brown, director of the Initiative on Nonstate Armed Actors at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThank you very much. Welcome to the \"NewsHour.\"\n\nHow much influence did Wagner have in Africa, and how effective have they been?\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown, Brookings Institution:\n\nWell, Wagner did have very significant influence.\n\nIt was the front of Russian foreign policy, and it was important and strategic forward thrust and, frankly, countering U.S. interest. It had very little effectiveness in terms of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, its ostensible mission, the cover under which Wagner entered various countries in Africa.\n\nIn reality, what Wagner ended up selling was a Praetorian Guard service for people in power, along with a whole variety of economic services, political manipulation, misinformation.\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown:\n\nWell, we are all trying to understand that.\n\nI mean, there's a lot of mythology about Prigozhin. But I don't think it's realistic to assume that one man controlled what was the vast empire of hundreds of companies dealing with tens of billions of dollars and managing thousands of forces operating across many countries.\n\nIn fact, we know that many people who died along with him on that plane were his key logistical operators, financial operators. So I think that Prigozhin is very replaceable, even if the aura of the man who will be in charge of whatever is left of Wagner will be very different and his profile probably much less visible than that of Prigozhin.\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown:\n\nWell, we are able to see clearly there is an effort to both indicate that the services that Wagner extended will be preserved.\n\nAnd this effort has been under way for a considerable amount of time, even before what just happened in the assassination of Prigozhin. But, at the same time, the empire is being chopped up. It is being divided into smaller entities that are easier to hold.\n\nBut I think it's significant to note that just immediately after the mutiny, even countries like the Central African Republic, which were almost under the thumb of the Wagner Group, immediately expressed that their relationship has been with the Kremlin and with Russia.\n\nAlready, then, the phrasing from the African leaders themselves was very specifically understanding that whatever services they bought from Wagner, they understood that, behind Wagner, there was the Kremlin, and that had not changed for them.\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown:\n\nI think that is far more likely. And that is, frankly, what we are seeing.\n\nSo, in some parts of the world, like in Syria, we are seeing that Wagner forces have been rolled on to the rosters of the Russian military and Wagner commanders have been replaced with Russian military commanders, because Russia already had the military deployed there.\n\nBut, in other parts of Africa, we may have some entity that is called Wagner left. Apparently, for example, in the Central African Republic, the man who currently leads the Wagner forces is to remain as the leader. In other parts, we are seeing efforts to roll parts of Wagner into other Russian private security companies.\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown:\n\nI think that's the Kremlin's calculation, that a set of smaller companies, one of which still might be called Wagner, others which are newer, perhaps some that will be completely brand-new, will be far easier to extend than one-mafia fiefdoms that Prigozhin was running.\n\nOf course, there was an advantage to the Wagner Group's big conglomerate. It created an enormous name. It was one supermarket for African leaders to go shop for political manipulation, military Praetorian Guard services, misinformation campaign.\n\nAnd it will take some time for a new entity to be able to provide this set of services. And, quite likely, Moscow might not want all one company to provide all of these services.\n\nNick Schifrin:\n\nBut, at the same time, Prigozhin's personality, his brutality did keep these diverse companies, these diverse assets together.\n\nBritish military intelligence recently said that: \"Prigozhin's hyperactivity, exceptional audacity and a drive for results and extreme brutality are unlikely to be matched by any successor.\"\n\nIs it possible that the Kremlin's efforts to take from Wagner what Prigozhin held and instead hold it themselves might fail?\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown:\n\nI think it's possible.\n\nI don't think that we will see a situation where we will have wholesale liquidation of what Wagner did or what it brought to the Kremlin, which included significant financial income in avoidance of Western sanctions, which provided significant money laundering services and way to hide money to be brought to Moscow, as well as strategic thrust and forward presence.\n\nI would also add here, though, that what gave Prigozhin the visibility, the audacity was also what was his downfall. And many operator in the clandestine services would really want to keep much lower profile. Ultimately, Prigozhin's greatest asset was not his logistical genius, but was his closeness to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAnd when he lost that, that's when he lost the power and the empire and his life."
