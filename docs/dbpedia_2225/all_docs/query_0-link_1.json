Clergyman.\n\nThe Vicar of Brighton from 1824 until his death, a position achieved as a result of tutoring the children of the Duke of Wellington, who as a child had himself been taught by Wagner's maternal grandfather, Henry Michell, and who had also previously held the post as Vicar of Brighton. He added the parish of West Blatchington as vicar in 1825. He commissioned the construction of numerous churches in the town. He was the father of Arthur Douglas Wagner and uncle of George Wagner. His great-grandfather, Melchior Wagner, was hatmaker to George I and the army, with premises in Pall Mall, London.\n\nImage; Bust of H M Wagner [Royal Pavilion & Museums Trust]\n\nRev George Wagner. Clergyman.\n\nBorn at Herstmonceux Place, the son of H M Wagner's elder brother, he was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was ordained in 1842, was curate of Dallington, Sussex in 1845-1848 and perpetual curate of St Stephen's Brighton from 1851. He founded the Home for Penitent Females in Lewes Road in 1853. He died in Valetta, Malta.\n\nRev Arthur Douglas Wagner [right]. Clergyman.\n\nBorn in Windsor Castle and reportedly named Arthur after the Duke of Wellington, he was the son of Rev H M Wagner, who appointed him perpetual curate of St Paul's Church, West Street in 1850, he held that post until his death. An Anglo-Catholic churchman, follower of Pusey and the Oxford Movement, who introduced ritualistic practices, including confession, in Brighton's churches. In 1864 his refusal in court to reveal information from Constance Kent (in the infamous Road Hill House murder case), on the grounds that it was given to him as sacramental confession, caused considerable national controversy. She had been resident in St Mary's Home for Female Penitents for Unmarried Mothers and Prostitutes, founded by his cousin George [qv above], run by the Community of the Virgin Mary, an Anglican order of nuns, which he also established.\n\nHe lived at the Vicarage until his father's death in 1870 and then moved next door to Belvedere. He used his wealth to commission five churches in Brighton: St Bartholomew, Church of the Annunciation, Church of the Resurrection, St Mary & St Magdalene and St Martin. He also paid for the construction around 400 houses in the Round Hill and Islingword Road areas. He is interred in Woodvale Cemetery and left Â£49,907 15s 6d.

His catchphrase: 'Mr Walker wants to know'. He also appeared in a television comedy and variety shows before the war and in about a dozen films, most of them between 1937 and 1939, typically playing policemen. In Over She Goes (1938) he even sang a song called 'We Policemen Think We Police are Grand'. He died in a nursing home at 26 Cromwell Road, following an operation for appendicitis. His wife, Lily (Lydia) Louie Margaret Kirkman was also a music hall artiste. He was the father of film director Pete Walker (b 1939), who made several films in Brighton.

What a Lovely War, Catch-22, Chariots of Fire and Out of Africa, for which he won a BAFTA and an Academy Award. The invention that brought him an Oscar was a solution to the problem of lighting an exterior night scene in a more naturalistic way: an array of 200 luminaires mounted on a crane at some distance from the action. This became known as a 'Wendy light', using Watkin's nickname in the gay community.\n\nHe learned his craft as a junior staff member of British Transport Films from 1949 to 1962 (his father was the solicitor to Southern Railway).

Film pioneer who grew up in Edinburgh but moved to London to train as a chemist. in 1881 he bought out the pharmacy business of his employer at Eastry, Kent, where he had worked since 1877. Around the same time (August 1881) he married Betsy Heaysman. The family, which by now included three children, moved to Hove in 1886, where Williamson took on a chemist's shop at 144 Church Road. Through this his interest in photography was stimulatedÂ¶mdash;his shop became an outlet for Kodak materialsâand in 1896 he acquired one of the new portable x-ray (Roentgen ray) machines, which he used at the Royal Sussex County Hospital. That year, 1896, marked a turning point in his life. The first film shows occurred in Brighton and in November he too included moving pictures at the annual show of the Hove Camera Club at Hove Town Hall. He made his own first films in 1897 and by the end of 1900 he had made 72 titles—a total of 97 separate single-shot films.\n\nHe began shooting fictional scenes in 1898, when he moved his premises to 55 Western Road, Hove to concentrate more on film activities, and in November 1900 released one of the most important of all early films: Attack on a China Mission—Blue Jackets to the Rescue. This comprised four shots and introduced the idea of shooting reverse angles to show the action from different sides, thereby heightening the drama. The following year he built on this technical achievement with Fire! This featured the Hove fire brigade and was effectively a pioneer dramatised documentary, combining actuality shots with a staged rescue, filmed at the abandoned Ivy Lodge off Hove Street. It was later copied in America.\n\nWilliamson filmed major state events, including Queen Victoria's funeral (1901) and the coronation processions for Edward VII (1902). But by progressively moving away from 'topicality' scenes, he recognised that audiences would soon tire of simply seeing the world around them and would respond to entertainment, story-telling and drama.\n\nThe Big Swallow (1901) showed a reluctant sitter for a photograph portrait swallow the camera. in 1902 he made two short dramas of 'social realism': The Soldier's Return and A Reservist Before the War and After the War were about the issues that faced troops returning from the Boer War. His instinctive understanding of narrative editing was shown in some the earliest chase films, such as Stop Thief! (1901).\n\nIn 1902 Williamson bought a detached house, Rose Cottage, just off Wilbury Villas—at what is now Cambridge Grove—and built a glasshouse studio and a workshop building (which survives) on the land in front of it. The family [above], which now included seven children, moved into Rose Cottage and played an important part in the Williamson enterprise. Most of them worked in the business and some made regular appearances in films. It is not known whether his eldest daughter, Janet Melville Williamson (born 3 July 1882 at Eastry, Kent), ever appeared in a film; however, she worked as an assistant in his chemist's shop and married Harry Crowhurst. Alan and Colin were the 'two naughty boys' in a series of comedies (1899-1901) and it was probably Lilian who played The Little Match Seller in the moving version of H C Andersen's story, one of the first literary adaptations. in Our New Errand Boy (1905), Williamson himself was the grocer.\n\nWhile the Williamson Kinematograph Company continued production in Hove, he opened an office in July 1907 as James Williamson & Co at 27 Cecil Court, London (a street known as 'Flicker Alley' because of the concentration of film companies there) to deal in film equipment and to rent films. The following year, as his own production efforts started to diminish, he formed Williamson Dressler & Co Ltd with an American partner, E Dressler Co, which had the US distribution rights for Cines and Selig. The new company continued to sell equipment but also had the European rights for Selig films and the UK and US rights for Cines, as well as world rights to Williamson's catalogue. It survived until 1912.\n\nIn 1909 Williamson started to hand over directorial responsibility for films to others: first to Jack Chart, then Dave Aylott. He also began a move into natural history with films by Oliver Pike, Edmund J Spitta and himself. But in 1910 he ended regular film production and sold his Cambridge Grove studio facilities to Charles Urban's Natural Color Kinematograph Company for Kinemacolor productions. By 1911 the family was living in Wandsworth and the connection with Hove had ended.\n\nIn 1913, by which time The Williamson Kinematograph Company was at 28 Denmark Street, he opened a film processing unit at Nesbitt's Alley, Barnet, where Birt Acres had previously operated. His son Colin ran the manufacturing side of the business, which opened in 1915 in Litchfield Gardens at Willesden Green in north-west London and was noted for the successful range of Topical cameras. The company also pioneered specialised cameras for aerial photography that were employed during the two world wars.\n\nIn May 1913 Williamson briefly resumed film production with a newsreel, Williamson's Animated News, which included coverage of the Derby horse race in June 1913 and lasted until late 1914 but did not survive into the Great War.\n\nFrom 1920 the company's offices were at 80 Wardour Street and in 1930 moved to 4 Denmark Street. Williamson and his wife settled in Richmond, Surrey, in the outer London suburbs. By now he was working on colour photography. One of his prints was hung in the Royal Photographic Society's exhibition in 1931. He died in Richmond, leaving just over Â£15,000.\n\nA strong case can be advanced that James Williamson was among the handful of the most influential film-makers in the first decade of the cinema, and perhaps even pre-eminent among them, given his contribution to the development of narrative technique.
