        "text": "They’re at David Cameron’s old school, but these five young men are more interested in following in the footsteps of old boys Hugh Laurie and Damian Lewis than becoming Prime Minister\n\nFrom left-to-right: Guy Clark, 18, playwright, actor and director; Jonah Hauer-King, 17, leading actor; Nico MacDonagh, 14, young leading actor; Dan Byam Shaw, 17, director, writer and performer; Jack Parham, 16, actor and director\n\nWhat links together the world’s most-watched TV show House, Steven Spielberg’s War Horse, the gritty urban drugs drama The Wire and the award-winning West End play Red?\n\nSomewhat surprisingly its star names all went to Eton College.\n\nThe school, which was once called ‘the chief nurse of England’s statesmen’ because of its reputation for breeding senior politicians and prime ministers, including David Cameron, now has a new claim to fame as a powerhouse for some of Britain’s finest actors.\n\nEton’s motto, ‘Floreat Etona’ (‘Let Eton flourish’), has never seemed more apt as former pupils such as Hugh Laurie, Dominic West, Damian Lewis, Eddie Redmayne, Tom Hiddleston and Harry Lloyd dominate our stage and screens.\n\nSuch is the current reputation of the school – one commentator has even gone so far as to call it ‘the alternative Rada’ – that its plays sometimes attract London agents on the lookout for the next big thing.\n\nNext month, Eton is sending four shows and 50 of its boys to the Edinburgh Fringe, the largest number in the school’s history.\n\nTo mark the occasion, the school’s renowned drama department has opened its doors for a rare glimpse inside and to meet the five rising stars it believes can mimic the success of its famous alumni.\n\nWhile Eton was founded by Henry VI in 1440, in the past drama was regarded as second-rate.\n\nIndeed, when English teacher and sometime director Michael Meredith first arrived at the school in 1965 he was surprised by Eton’s disparaging attitude.\n\nEton's five rising stars in school uniform. Such is the current reputation of the school, one commentator has even gone so far as to call it 'the alternative Rada'\n\nThis was, he says, a hangover from a regime that banned the subject at the end of the 19th century.\n\n‘I think the school thought it rather decadent and pointless,’ he says.\n\nBy the time Meredith retired from full-time teaching in 2000, the drama department had been transformed.\n\n‘Michael was one of the key figures who changed the way drama was perceived in the school,’ says Simon Dormandy, a former RSC actor and now head of theatre studies.\n\n‘He, my predecessor Peter Broad and later Angus Graham-Campbell have overseen some tremendously exciting, cutting-edge productions.’\n\nThe school puts on 20-25 shows a year in three spaces – the impressive 400-seat Farrer Theatre (complete with revolving stage and orchestra pit) and two smaller studios.\n\nLining the corridor that leads down to the dressing room are photographs of past productions, some of which feature some famous faces: the young Dominic West playing Hamlet, a youthful-looking Damian Lewis as Wackford Squeers in Nicholas Nickleby, Tom Hiddleston as Bernard Nightingale in Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia, Harry Lloyd in Three Sisters and Waiting For Godot, and Eddie Redmayne as Henry IV and as Adela Quested in A Passage To India.\n\n‘You cannot always spot their talent at this age,’ says Dormandy, who is leaving the school in January to pursue a career as a director.\n\n‘But I knew Eddie Redmayne was an outstanding actor from our first meeting, when I auditioned him, aged just 15, for the leading role in my version of A Passage To India.\n\n'I don’t think I fully appreciated quite how exceptional he is until I saw him in his first professional role, as Viola in the Globe company’s Twelfth Night opposite Mark Rylance.\n\n‘I realised Sebastian Armesto was a real actor, not just a schoolboy with talent, when he played Sir Anthony Absolute in The Rivals for me.\n\n'We decided to make him a bluff American Senator from Alabama, so it was a complete character creation, turning a young, wiry English boy into a fat, ageing, raging Southern Baptist.’\n\nIn 1991 four boys created the theatre company Double Edge Drama, with the sole purpose of taking quality plays to Edinburgh.\n\nThe 50 boys about to descend upon the festival marking 21 years of Eton at the Fringe are staging their shows – Almost Nothing To Do With Frogs, Apples, Flames Over New Jersey and Spring Awakening – at the Underbelly, the venue created by Charlie Wood, one of the original founders of Double Edge.\n\nL-R: Dan Byam Shaw, Jonah Hauer-King, Jack Parham, Guy Clark, Nico MacDonagh. Next month, Eton is sending four shows and 50 of its boys to the Edinburgh Fringe, the largest number in the school's history\n\nThe boys are aided by the generosity of the Fred Hood Memorial Fund, in the memory of a former Old Etonian – and another founder of the Underbelly – who died in a skiing accident in 2008, aged 28.\n\nA fund set up and funded by alumni in the name of Michael Meredith is providing financial assistance in the form of an annual prize.\n\nThe first winner of the prize, 18-year-old Guy Clark, is one of Eton’s faces to watch. He is using the £500 award to take his satirical adaptation of Aristophanes’ The Frogs to Edinburgh. Clark was in the middle of rehearsals when he heard the news.\n\n‘One day last term, a teacher (Hailz-Emily Osborne, the school’s director of drama) came into the room and asked if she could have a word,’ says Guy.\n\n‘I thought to myself, “Oh no, what have I done? I must be in huge trouble.” But she told me that she had some good news. I couldn’t stop grinning to myself.’\n\nThe concept of Almost Nothing To Do With Frogs – about two washed-up comedy writers who venture to the underworld in search of the world’s greatest playwright – was the brainchild of Guy’s writing partner, 17-year-old Dan Byam Shaw, who also directs.\n\nDan has the theatre in his blood: his great-great uncle was the actor and director Glen Byam Shaw; his uncle is the former actor and successful producer Matthew Byam Shaw.\n\n‘I know it’s tough out there,’ says the youngster, ‘but who knows, maybe one day I will see something I’ve written up in lights in the West End.’\n\nThe youngest actor, Nico MacDonagh, 14, is already aware of how Old Etonians have paved the way for his work.\n\n‘I admired Eddie Redmayne’s performance in Birdsong – he’s definitely inspired me to act.’\n\nDuring the Live photo shoot Nico has to rely on crutches as he suffers from what he describes as ‘dead bone’ in his knee, yet he is looking forward to starring in Spring Awakening at Edinburgh as well as playing one of the witches in Macbeth, a production at Eton that will also feature two boys who have won drama scholarships funded by alumni (some rumoured to be household names) designed to help students who could not otherwise afford the school’s £30,000 annual fees.\n\nThe lead roles in Shakespeare’s tragedy will be taken by Jonah Hauer-King as the king and Jack Parham as Lady Macbeth.\n\nJonah, 17, says Eton’s old boys are an inspiration: ‘It’s nice to know people at the same school and in a similar situation have been able to pursue a successful career in something they love, and break away from more common expectations.’\n\nJack, 16, adds: ‘Being aware of such a long list of famous alumni gave me motivation to pursue my interest in drama at the school and possibly as a career in the future.\n\n'It made me realise that the school is not just focused on academics, but takes all areas of school life seriously.\n\n'Their success has given me the confidence to make drama an important part of my life at Eton.’\n\nTickets, £7-£9, are available from underbelly.co.uk or the Fringe Office, edfringe.com\n\nDidn't the Eton Old Boys do well...\n\nDominic West (left) once said that when he first arrived at Eton he felt like a fish out of water. Harry Lloyd (right) has trod the boards in the West End and gone on to star in Jane Eyre and The Iron Lady\n\nDominic West, 42\n\nEton 1982-87\n\nBest known for playing the maverick detective Jimmy McNulty, the hard-drinking, authority–baiting Irish American in the acclaimed HBO Stateside police drama The Wire. Also won praise for his portrayal of serial killer Fred West in last year’s powerful ITV bio-pic, Appropriate Adult. Once told Live magazine that when he first arrived at Eton he felt like a fish out of water. ‘The one positive was that I did a lot of acting there. I was able to nurture that side of myself.’\n\nHarry Lloyd, 28\n\nEton 1997-2002\n\nThe great-great-great-grandson of the English-speaking world’s most famous novelist, Charles Dickens, he made his TV debut at 16 in a BBC adaptation of one of his illustrious ancestor’s most famous books, David Copperfield. Since then, he has trod the boards in the West End and gone on to star in Robin Hood, Game of Thrones, Jane Eyre and The Iron Lady – in which he played the young Denis Thatcher.\n\nHugh Laurie (left) once described Eton as 'the most private of private schools'. Eddie Redmayne (right) says: 'It's the first thing that gets written about me'\n\nHugh Laurie, 53\n\nEton 1972-77\n\nHis starring role as the brilliant but unorthodox American consultant Dr Gregory House in the hit U.S. medical drama House nets him $700,000 per episode, making him the highest paid actor in a television drama. He once described Eton as ‘the most private of private schools’. The actor and comedian, who shot to fame this side of the pond in Blackadder and Jeeves And Wooster, is also an accomplished musician.\n\nEddie Redmayne, 30\n\nEton 1995-2000\n\n‘It’s the first thing that gets written about me,’ sighs Eddie Redmayne, star of the moving World War I television drama Birdsong (adapted from the Sebastian Faulks bestseller), when discussing his old school. The heartthrob actor, who has also appeared in the award-winning My Week With Marilyn and stars in the forthcoming film version of Les Miserables, adds: ‘It’s the weird thing Eton does – you’re at school next to lords and earls and, in my case, Prince William, so you end up being used to dealing with those sorts of people.’\n\nSebastian Armesto (left) says: 'The facilities are amazing... I was exposed to some extraordinary works of theatre.' Tom Hiddleston (right) says the school is 'one of the most broad-minded places I've ever been'\n\nSebastian Armesto, 30\n\nEton 1995-2000\n\n‘Eton’s drama department? There’s nothing else to compare it to,’ says Armesto, star of The Tudors, the BBC’s Little Dorrit, as well as Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Adds the historian’s son: ‘The facilities are amazing, there is an excellent group of teachers and I was exposed to some extraordinary works of theatre. It gave me a real taste of what it might be like to do as a job.’\n\nTom Hiddleston, 31\n\nEton 1994-99\n\nEarlier this year, the versatile Hiddleston, who has starred in the Marvel comics big screen spin-off Thor, and Steven Spielberg’s World War I tearjerker War Horse, told Live that most people had misconceptions about his old school. ‘People think it’s just full of braying toffs, who are arrogant and chauvinistic, senseless and ambitious, who are destined to run the country and steal all our money,’ he said. ‘It isn’t true… It’s actually one of the most broad-minded places I’ve ever been.’\n\n'I kept the fact I went there (Eton) quiet for the longest time,' said Damian Lewis\n\nDamian Lewis, 41\n\nEton 1984-89"
