        "text": "Kathy Wagner serves as Chief Strategy Officer (and was formerly CFO) of Kaseya, the leading global provider of AI-powered cybersecurity and IT management software. Through its customer-centric approach and renowned support, Kaseya delivers technologies that empower organizations to seamlessly manage IT infrastructure, secure networks, backup critical data, manage service operations and grow their businesses. Headquartered in Miami and the sponsor of the Kaseya Center, the company is privately held with a global presence in more than a dozen countries.\n\nKathy and I recently had an engaging conversation about first jobs, whether the MBA or CPA is more beneficial to finance professionals, what drew her to the opportunity at Kaseya, how employees’ presence in the office helps them advance their careers, and more.\n\n—\n\nKathy Wagner grew up in a hard-working family in New Jersey. Because her father volunteered at bingo at her Catholic school and believed young people should work, at the age of seven she took on her first job as a bingo waitress, bringing players their coffee and snacks.\n\nFast-forward to her college years; Wagner attended Florida Atlantic University with the intention of eventually majoring in pre-law. As she completed her first-year coursework in business, she found herself excelling in accounting. When her teacher asked her if she had ever considered becoming a CPA, she explained her plans.\n\n“She said, do you know that there is one lawyer for every seven people in the state?” Wagner reflects. “She said there was a big shortage of CPAs, so I listened to her and researched it. She was right, so I decided to take a closer look at it because I knew I had to be able to get a good job. So, I wound up becoming a CPA.”\n\nHer education at Florida Atlantic didn’t stop with her bachelor’s degree; she immediately got her MBA as well. She then worked in the audit departments of Arthur Anderson and Ernst & Young before taking on her first corporate role at Citrix.\n\nHer roles in public accounting solidified her strong work ethic and provided an understanding of the wide range of services she could provide to clients, how to research issues, and the general nuts and bolts of finance, like bank reconciliation. At Citrix, Wagner felt prepared to take on the more complex tasks in her role as assistant corporate controller. There, Wagner oversaw writing SEC filings, press releases, and management discussion & analysis (MD&A), and handling all the complex accounting.\n\nShe was also prepared to take on the jump to corporate because of the benefit of having her MBA, something she recommends all finance professionals pursue if they can.\n\n“In a lot of states now, in order to get your CPA, you have to do the extra 30 hours or so, so you might as well get the extra couple classes and get the MBA,” she explains. “You’re going to have a lot of auditors coming in with the most conservative treatment every time. You’re going to want to be able to communicate how you are looking at the business outcome. If you don’t have the accounting chops you won’t know when it is appropriate to push back or look at alternative structures in those situations, it’s an advantage that you can’t press.”\n\nThat keen business sensibility and acumen served Wagner well at Citrix, where she was part of a team that scaled the business from $300 million to $3.3 billion in revenue. Over the course of her tenure, she estimates that she was also part of more than 60 acquisitions.\n\nAs a self-described fixer and problem-solver, it was an environment in which she\n\nthrived. She had the opportunity to be involved in the work of scaling the company, which came with its share of challenges, but she also sees the growth and learning opportunities that those challenges provided.\n\nOne such opportunity for learning and growth was when she moved the company to a shared services model. She learned how difficult it is to automate processes that must work for 40 people in 40 different countries–making it impossible to automate in 40 different ways. That unique challenge forced her to change course and organize by function.\n\n“Each person's breadth was reduced, but their depth increased,” she said. “When we reorganized we saved a couple hundred million dollars doing that, and I was able to take a big chunk of that money and put it into building a procurement organization.”\n\nOver Wagner’s 17 years at Citrix, she also served the company as controller; vice president of global shared services; vice president of sales, services & marketing, and finance and administration; and finally, vice president of global finance and administration before moving to Kaseya as CFO. She was drawn to the opportunity because of a very simple reason: the leadership.\n\n“I met Fred [Voccola], our CEO, and he had such clarity of vision and purpose for the company,” Wagner said. “I was on the phone with him for an hour or so, and when we hung up, I was able to clearly articulate exactly what they did and what the vision was. It is so important to know what your purpose is, who your customer is, and be really laser focused on it. Too many companies try to be too many things to too many people or customers that they lose focus. Out of all the different opportunities I was looking at, I knew I wanted to go there because more than half the battle is knowing who and what you are, what you're serving, and what your purpose is.”\n\nOver the course of her three years at Kaseya, that instinct has paid off, and her rapport with Voccola is a solid, collaborative one. She sees her role as working with the leadership team to figure out ways to make the things he envisions reality. But Wagner also considers herself a business partner to her peers and management team.\n\nTo Wagner, being a valuable member of a team or leading one is all about one key characteristic: growth, both pursuing it personally and hiring people who are interested in achieving it.\n\n“One of the things that we really like to do at Kaseya is grow our own,” she said. “That means that we like to take candidates who are less experienced and provide them with the training and the support system so they can grow into roles. We like to promote from within; it’s a really big cultural aspect of our business. Of course there are some roles where I need experienced folks, but sometimes I will hire what I call a Step-Up candidate. At their current company, that person is right below the role I'm looking to hire, and maybe that person is ready to be promoted, but the guy in the seat isn't leaving anytime soon.”\n\nWagner enjoys giving people the chance to be a first-time chief accounting officer, first-time head of HR, and so forth.\n\n“That's something we take pride in,” she reiterates. “In general, we have that kind of scrappy culture where we want the kind of people who are willing to fight to get to the next level. It builds tenacity throughout the team.”\n\nWagner has also seen the amount of growth that is possible throughout the company when people are working together in-person, as Kaseya has made the commitment to being completely back in the office. In fact, the office is configured to support team collaboration. The sales team, for example, is organized with a manager seated at the head of the table and the eight reps they manage are seated around that table. If someone has a question or needs help, all they have to do is raise their hand or call the manager over.\n\nFor companies that are trying to convince their employees to be back in the office, Kaseya’s reasoning is simple. The “why” of being back in the office is that it helps employees’ careers and achieve their objectives.\n\nWhen it comes to the next generation of financial leaders, Wagner has other advice on how they can achieve their career objectives.\n\n“The best thing you can do when you come into a role is kill the role you got,” she explains. “Number two is identifying problems and solving them. And number three, don't say no to anything. If somebody asks you to do something, turn it into an opportunity to really make an impression. If you do those things, that will give you a good foundation to get promoted and eventually become a leader.”\n\nIf other leaders are curious as to what makes Wagner effective in her role, her formula can be summed up with three P’s: planning, predicting, and profits.\n\n“We always say we need to plan for everything,” she says. “Then, predicting is even more difficult because everything changes very quickly in technology and business. We're a very dynamic company growing quickly. An opportunity like [sponsoring] the Kaseya Center popped up and was a big deal, so it prompted us to figure out how we were going to be able to do that. We had to ask if we could do it, if we could afford it, how we would negotiate it, and how we would find time to do it. You must predict as much as you can and try to try to build time and resources into the system when and if an opportunity presents itself. Then, growing profitable is very important. We're always looking at our profitability margin and making those tweaks where unfettered growth without profitability is not going to make us a more valuable company, and it’s not a good way to run.”\n\nIn addition to how the company runs, Wagner is also very interested in how other things run…particularly of the automotive variety. Outside of work, Wagner is a self-described “total motorhead” who loves old, fast cars, a passion she shares with her husband. They enjoy building monster trucks in their driveway and have a small collection of vehicles that includes a Corvette, MG Benz, and Jeep Rubicon.\n\n“It's just super fun,” she says. “Not all of it is highbrow and expensive, but it’s really fun to work on the builds that we enjoy for a while and then we sell them and move on to something new.”\n\nAgain, hard work, vision, and jumping on opportunities for growth pay off."
