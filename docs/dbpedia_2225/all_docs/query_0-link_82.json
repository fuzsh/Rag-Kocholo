        "text": "Parry was born into a privileged and cultured family. His father, Thomas Gambier Parry, was a gifted amateur artist and musician who collected medieval and renaissance art. Like his father, Hubert was educated at Eton College (1861-1866) where he was introduced to many classical texts in the original Latin and Greek. Parry developed here a lifelong interest in literature, keeping a list of his reading in the back of his diary each year. The poets he read ranged from Shakespeare through Byron and Wordsworth to Tennyson.\n\nParry went up to Oxford in January 1867, reading law and modern history at Exeter College. Music continued to be his greatest passion and he developed his skills both in piano playing and composing. During this period his musical horizons began to widen as he immersed himself in works by German composers such as Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Schubert.\n\nAfter university, following the wishes of his family, Parry started a career as an underwriter at Lloyd’s Register of Shipping. However he continued to study music with the pianist Edward Dannreuther and through him became acquainted with the music of Brahms, Wagner, Stanford and Richard Strauss.\n\nParry was greatly encouraged to undertake a musical career by George Grove who soon invited him to contribute to his monumental Dictionary of Music and Musicians, whose first volume was to be published in 1879. Parry eventually wrote 123 entries for the dictionary, covering technical aspects of music.\n\nAs editor of Macmillan’s Magazine, Grove had also published 6 of Parry’s own poems back in 1875, recognising Hubert’s literary talent.\n\nIn 1882, Grove, now the Director of the newly-founded Royal College of Music, wrote to Parry at the behest of the Prince of Wales asking him to join the College as Professor of Musical History. He joined at the same time as Charles Villiers Stanford (Professor of Composition), Walter Parratt (Professor of Organ) and Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt (Professor of Singing).\n\nAs Grove stated in a letter to Parry (dated 30 Dec. 1882): “It is our wish to make lectures an important part of the College course. And into no hands could those on the history and development of music be put with more propriety than into yours […]”.\n\nAll the notes of Parry’s lectures are collected in 35 notebooks and include topics ranging from early music to the music of his contemporaries.\n\nIn the late 19th century Oxford and Cambridge universities started performing classical plays in ancient Greek, with musical scores by contemporary composers. In 1883 the Cambridge classics scholar Francis Jenkinson invited Parry to compose the incidental music for the university production of Aristophanes’ The Birds, setting the Greek text.\n\nIt was for Parry the beginning of a long journey through the classics that lasted 31 years.\n\nThe Birds was performed at the Theatre Royal in Cambridge (November 1883) by the Cambridge Amateur Dramatic Club, conducted by Stanford. It was the first Greek comedy to be produced in full since antiquity. The opening night was attended by Prince Albert Victor Duke of Clarence and Avondale and the Postmaster General.\n\n2704 tickets were sold.\n\nSince his early years as a student, Parry loved to combine his interest in music and poetry – especially 19th-century English poetry – setting to music a remarkable number of poems during his career as a composer. His earliest song on a text by Spenser dates from 1864. Thomas Moore’s ‘Why does azure deck the sky’ was his first published song in 1866, written for his friend Cecil Ricardo, who sang it at an Eton Musical Society concert.\n\nIn his choral work “The Vision of Life”, we can also discover Parry’s poetic gifts as it is based on his own poem. It is a philosophical reflection on life: through the idealised characters of “The Dreamer”(Bass), inclined to pessimism, “The Spirit of the Vision” (Soprano) who leads him in his search for meaning and “The Dream Voices” (Chorus), Parry praises man’s philanthropy and his capacity to contribute to the common good. The work was much admired by Elgar.\n\nThe majesty of Parry’s choral music is however best illustrated in “I was glad”, considered one of his masterpieces of the genre, with its specific connection to the coronation ceremony.\n\nIn 1902, at the invitation of Sir Frederick Bridge (on behalf of the King), Director of Music for the Coronation, Parry composed the processional anthem, based on Psalm 122, to accompany the King’s and Queen’s entrance into Westminster Abbey during the Coronation of Edward VII. (The original music manuscript of this work is held at the RCM Library).\n\nIn 1916 Parry was invited by the poet Robert Bridges to set the opening verses of Blake’s Milton to be used by the organisation Fight for Right (formed to counteract German propaganda). Despite his initial doubts, Parry eventually accepted Bridges’ proposal and composed the music for “And did those feet in ancient time”, better known as Jerusalem.\n\n“It is said that the greatest benefactor of a country is the man who writes its tune; if he had left us nothing but Jerusalem we could never repay him for what we owe him”(Harry Plunkett Greene)."
