        "text": "Kyle Ryan Wagner, 33, of Sheboygan, went to his LORD Friday morning January 8th, 2021 at his home from a pulmonary edema.\n\nBorn November 14th, 1987, in Sheboygan, Kyle was the son of Arthur and Christine (nee Reseburg) Wagner. Kyle Graduated from Pigeon River Elementary School, Urban Middle School, and Sheboygan North High School. While at Sheboygan North High he enjoyed competing in cross country running. Kyle served as a combat medic from 2007 thru 2010 completing one tour in Iraq. He received an honorable discharge from the United States Military. Upon returning from active duty, he attended Lakeshore Technical College and attained an Associate’s Degree in Criminal Justice. His last full-time position was as an officer in the Sheboygan Police Department in 2020.\n\nKyle enjoyed drumming, reading, the outdoors, hunting, compound bow & firearm target shooting, and riding his motorcycle. He bonded with a beautiful Labralas service dog which he trained himself named Jade. He especially loved and enjoyed spending time with his friends and family. He loved people and was always wanting to give a hand and help anyone who needed support.\n\nHe was a member of Bethlehem Lutheran Church located at 1121 Georgia Avenue, Sheboygan, WI 53081. He was baptized on April, 17th 1988 by Pastor Hartman. He was confirmed on May, 19th 2002.\n\nOn November, 11th of 2019 he proposed and was engaged to his love, Stevie Mckenna. They were to be married in the summer of 2021. They had a son together named Benjamin Arthur Wagner.\n\nHe is survived by his fiancée Stevie Mckenna and her daughter Brook Piehl, whom he loved as his own daughter; newborn son Benjamin Arthur Wagner; parents Arthur and Christine Wagner; and his brother Eric Arthur Wagner. He loved his family dearly.\n\nCremation was handled by Reinbold-Novak Funeral Home. There will be no visitation at the funeral home. A private memorial service will be held at a later date. The Rev. Patrick Niles, of Bethlehem Lutheran Church, will officiate.\n\nA memorial fund is being set up for his beloved son Benjamin Arthur Wagner in lieu of flowers.\n\nKyle will be deeply missed by his beloved fiancée, family, and friends as they patiently wait to be reunited in the everlasting life through Christ Jesus which is to come.\n\nO Gracious LORD, absolve, we beseech Thee, the soul of Thy servant, from every bond of sin; that in the glory of the Resurrection, amongst Thy saints and elect, he may rise unto newness of life. This we ask through Christ Jesus, Our LORD. Amen.\n\nEternal rest grant unto him, O LORD, and let the perpetual light shine upon him. May he rest in peace.
