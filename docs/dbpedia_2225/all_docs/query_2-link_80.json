        "text": "Application Process\n\nThe scholarship application window is December 1 through February 15 for the following academic year.\n\nTo apply for these and other scholarships, please access WMUâ€™s ScholarshipUniverse system. To be considered for scholarships with financial need criteria, you must have submitted a FAFSA application for the upcoming academic year. The federal school code for Western Michigan University is 002330. If you do not complete the FAFSA, you are still eligible to apply for consideration for scholarships without financial need criteria.\n\nTo view college and departmental scholarships, use the advanced search to filter by organization (College of Education and Human Development). Submitting one CEHD application will consider you for all college-level scholarships you are eligible for. We recommend completing as many matching questions in the system as possible and completing your FAFSA before applying in order to ensure you are considered for as many scholarships as possible. You can also answer matching questions by clicking into individual CEHD/departmental scholarships before submitting your application.\n\nCEHD scholarship tutorial video:\n\nView the ScholarshipUniverse instructions.\n\nApply Now\n\nScholarships\n\nClick on the scholarship to expand and see scholarship criteria, if applicable."
