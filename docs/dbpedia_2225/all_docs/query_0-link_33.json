        "text": "Eton College is sending around a fifth of its leavers to US universities, it has emerged, as private school pupils face increased competition to get into Oxbridge.\n\nThe £46,300-a-year school is seeing increasing numbers of students seriously looking at the US, The Times reported.\n\nA source at the school said that around 50 students a year were going to universities including Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale and Colombia.\n\n“Some of our very top academics are looking to the States ahead of Oxbridge, some apply to both and an increasing number apply only to the US,” they added.\n\n“Those who go to the US are typically attracted by the breadth of the study programmes and the international perspective, their top quality sports programmes and some of the boys on free places at Eton win fully funded places to the US.”\n\nThe school, founded in 1440, has educated 20 British Prime Ministers, of whom all but one went on to study at either Oxford or Cambridge.\n\nHowever, Oxbridge offers for its pupils have halved in recent years amid attempts by the country’s two leading universities to boost their intake of state-educated pupils.\n\nIt had 48 offers from Oxford and Cambridge in 2021, down from 99 in 2014.\n\nA record 72 per cent of University of Cambridge offers were given to state school pupils last year, marking the ninth consecutive year of increases.\n\nProf Stephen Toope, vice-chancellor of the university, warned in May that private schools must accept that they will place fewer students at Oxbridge.\n\nHe said that the “premium” attached to independent schooling was in decline.\n\nAround 70 per cent of University of Oxford offers were made to state school offers last year, up from 55.6 per cent in 2015."
