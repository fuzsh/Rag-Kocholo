        "text": "Jens E. Wagner\n\nApril 2, 1932- August 25, 2021\n\nJens E. Wagner died peacefully in Arroyo Grande, CA on August 25th at the age of 89.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, CA to immigrant parents Jens Otto & Phyllis Wagner, he was an inquisitive child. During his childhood, he lived at the Port San Luis Lighthouse and attended the 2-room red schoolhouse in Avila Beach. In the early 1940’s, his family resided on Angel Island. Jens and his younger brother often went down to the barracks and interacted with the soldiers as they were preparing to be deployed for WWII.\n\nHe graduated Balboa High School in San Francisco in 1951. Jens then met his future wife Sonia at the Colusa Club at St. Aloysius Church in Palo Alto during a fruitcake baking party in the fall of 1952. They announced their engagement on Valentine’s Day 1954 and wed September 19th (that same year) at St Anne’s Chapel in Palo Alto.\n\nAfter starting their family, Jens enrolled in University of Arizona Pharmacy School, in Tucson. After 5 years and with 6 children, Jens graduated in 1964 and the family returned to the Bay Area. In 1965 the family moved to the Central Coast and in 1968, Jens & Sonia purchased Arroyo Drug in the Village of Arroyo Grande.\n\nThe Wagners owned and operated Arroyo Drug for 40 plus years. Jens insisted on keeping the pharmacy running for as long as he could, to serve the community with a locally owned and operated pharmacy. He took pride in giving his customers a personal, accessible pharmacist at a time when chain pharmacies were taking over the industry. In 2013 after being a pharmacist for 49 years, Jens finally retired.\n\nJens actively attended St Patrick’s Church since 1973, was a member of ICF and he passionately supported the Outreach Food Pantry at St. Patrick’s.\n\nA generous and giving man, Jens is survived by his wife of 67 years, Sonia; their 6 children Philomena Greger (husband Joseph) of San Jose, CA, Catharine Steen, Greta Bertolini (husband Paolo) of Genoa, Italy, Jens P. Wagner of Arroyo Grande, Rita Wagner of Elk Grove, CA and Roxanne Stedman (husband Steve) of Anaheim, CA.\n\nHe also had 13 grandchildren: Ingrid Greger, Brietta Greger, Elsa Greger, Elizabeth Steen, Caroline Steen, Cinzia Bertolini, Andrea Wagner, Christina Wagner, Jens Daniel Wagner, Ryan Reed, Stephanie Reed-Lemke, Wesley Stedman, and Walter Stedman, multiple nieces and nephews, and finally, his dear brother Robin S. Wagner of New York City.\n\nRecitation of the Rosary will be held Wednesday, September 1, 2021, 7:00 PM at\n\nSt. Patrick's Catholic Church, 501 Fair Oaks Ave., Arroyo Grande\n\nFUNERAL MASS: Thursday, September 2, 2021, 11:00 AM; St. Patrick’s Catholic Church (Arroyo Grande)\n\nINTERMENT FOLLOWING the FUNERAL SERVICE: Thursday, September 2, 2021, Arroyo Grande Cemetery, 895 El Camino Real, Arroyo Grande\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations be made to St. Patrick’s Outreach Food Pantry"
