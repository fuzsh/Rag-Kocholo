        "text": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - Two Cedar Rapids school buildings will see changes after being sold by the Cedar Rapids Community School District. Both Arthur Elementary and Garfield Elementary concluded instruction last week.\n\nWhile Garfield Elementary was sold to a local developer, Arthur Elementary was purchased by the Eastern Iowa Arts Academy.\n\nThe academy is a nonprofit that offers free and paid courses and programs to people of all ages.\n\nHeather Wagner, executive director of the academy, hopes to use the 110-year-old building as its new location to consolidate its three locations by moving them under one roof. Those locations also suffer from space issues, filled with arts supplies and instruments.\n\n“We actually have six floors of room that we are working with right now that we’re going to put into Arthur,” Wagner said. “We want it to be an incredibly fun learning opportunity for the kids, we want it to be a creative space where they can feel safe.”\n\nShe says the building is ideal because of its space and its long history, a history she wants the academy to honor.\n\n“I’m really excited to repurpose the old school, we’re going to keep the cornerstone there,” Wagner said, referring to the stone commemorating the school’s age on its front lawn. “We’re not going to change any of those things, and then when you go inside, we want it to be very different.”\n\nThe move to Arthur could also help the organization with the amount of students and attendees it has. With more children and adults attending classes, the added space will allow the academy to accept more students.\n\n”We have been exceeding our capacity, our classes have been so full we’ve had kids on waiting lists,” Wagner said.\n\nThat also means the academy wants to accommodate all of its students, they’re raising funds to make the building ADA compliant. That includes making it more accessible for people in wheelchairs and raising money to install an elevator.\n\n“Our goal is to get all those things happening in the next year,” Wagner said.\n\nOther plans include creating an area for local artists to rent out and use as studio space, and adding a sensory room for students with autism.\n\n“So it’s very important to us,” Wagner said. “We’re going to have a sensory room so they can kind of remove themselves and be able to do art and music in there too.”\n\nThe sale of Arthur and Garfield Elementary still needs to be approved by the school board. A public hearing over the matter is scheduled to June 24.\n\nClasses just ended last week, but they’re already moving out of the building. The Eastern Iowa Arts Academy hopes to be moved in and open in the Winter.\n\nAs mentioned, the academy is raising funds to make the new location ADA compliant. The organization collects donations through its website."
