        "text": "British actor Eddie Redmayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor (for Die Entdeckung der Unendlichkeit (2014)).\n\nEdward John David Redmayne was born and raised in London, England, the son of Patricia (Burke) and Richard Charles Tunstall Redmayne, a businessman. His great-grandfather was Sir Richard Augustine Studdert Redmayne, a noted civil and mining engineer. He has English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh ancestry. Redmayne is the only member of his family to follow a career in acting, and also modeled during his teen years. He was educated at Eton College before going on to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied History of Art. Encouraged by his parents, Redmayne took drama lessons from a young age. His first stage appearance was in the Sam Mendes production of \"Oliver!\", in London's West End. He played a workhouse boy. Acting continued through school and university, including performing with the National Youth Music Theatre.\n\nRedmayne's first professional stage performance came in 2002 at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre where he played Viola in \"Twelfth Night\". In 2004, he won the prestigious Evening Standard Outstanding Newcomer Award for his working in Edward Albee's play \"The Goat\". Further stage successes followed, and in 2009, he starred in John Logan's \"Red\" at the Donmar Warehouse in London. He won huge critical acclaim for his role, winning an Oliver Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The play transferred to Broadway in 2010, and Redmayne went on to win a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play.\n\nAlongside his stage career, Redmayne has worked steadily in television and film. Notable projects include Robert De Niro's Der gute Hirte (2006), Elizabeth - Das goldene Königreich (2007), Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles (2008), Die Säulen der Erde (2010) and My Week with Marilyn (2011). He co-starred as Marius Pontmercy in the musical Les Misérables (2012). He played scientist Stephen Hawking in the biographical drama Die Entdeckung der Unendlichkeit (2014), opposite Felicity Jones, as Stephen's wife Jane Hawking. For his performance, Redmayne won multiple awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor. As such, he became the first man born in the 1980s to win an acting Oscar. He received further critical acclaim for his portrayal of Lili Elbe, one of the first known recipients of sex reassignment surgery, in The Danish Girl (2015). For his performance, he was nominated for multiple awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nIn 2014, Redmayne married publicist Hannah Bagshawe.\n\nThomas William Hiddleston was born in Westminster, London, to English-born Diana Patricia (Servaes) and Scottish-born James Norman Hiddleston. His mother is a former stage manager, and his father, a scientist, was the managing director of a pharmaceutical company. He started off at the preparatory school, The Dragon School in Oxford, and by the time he was 13, he boarded at Eton College, at the same time that his parents were going through a divorce. He continued on to the University of Cambridge, where he earned a double first in Classics. He continued to study acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, from which he graduated in 2005.\n\nWhilst at University of Cambridge, he was seen by the Hamilton Hodell agency in the play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and was signed. Following this, he was cast in his first television role in The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (2001). Hiddleston won his first film role as Oakley in Joanna Hogg's award-winning first feature, Unrelated (2007). His breakthrough role came when he portrayed the nemesis Loki in the Marvel Cinematic Universe feature film Thor (2011). He reprised the character in The Avengers (2012), Thor: The Dark Kingdom (2013), Thor: Tag der Entscheidung (2017), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018).\n\nHe has also appeared in Steven Spielberg's Gefährten (2011), The Deep Blue Sea (2011), Woody Allen's romantic comedy Midnight in Paris (2011), and the romantic vampire film Only Lovers Left Alive (2013). On television, he appeared on the BBC series The Hollow Crown (2012), in the adaptations of Shakespeare's \"Henry IV\" and \"Henry V\". In theatre, he has been in the productions of \"Cymbeline\" (2007) and \"Ivanov\" (2008). In December 2013, he starred as the title character in the Donmar Warehouse production of \"Coriolanus\" which played until February 2014. He won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Newcomer in a Play for his role in \"Cymbeline\" while also being nominated for the same award the same year for his role as Cassio in \"Othello\".\n\nBorn in England in 1974, Will was partially brought up in America, where his father was in the Army. It was here that he picked up the accent for his comic persona, the motivational speaker Chris John Jackson. He went to Eton College in England and the Oxford School of Drama and started to gain stage notice in 1999. He spent much time at London's Battersea Arts Center, noted as a springboard for offbeat comedy, and this is where he honed the character of 'Jackson'. He took it to the Edinburgh Festival, planning initially on only a week's booking as a friend was running another venue and there was a vacant slot. However, it won him the Perrier Comedy Award for 2004.\n\nDamian Lewis was born on February 11, 1971, in St. John's Wood, London, England, to Charlotte Mary (Bowater), from an upper-class background, and J. Watcyn Lewis, a city broker whose own parents were Welsh. He was raised on Abbey Road in London until the age of 8 with his siblings Gareth, William, and Amanda. In 1979, he was sent to Ashdown House boarding school, then was educated at Eton College. At age 16, he formed his own theater company, then worked in South London, then traveled around Africa. From 1990 to 1993, he studied at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, alongside Daniel Craig and Joseph Fiennes. Among his teachers was RSC stalwart Colin McCormack. Lewis graduated in 1993, and worked on the stage, particularly with the Royal Shakespeare Company. There he was seen by director Steven Spielberg, who subsequently cast him as Richard Winters in the HBO/BBC miniseries Band of Brothers: Wir waren wie Brüder (2001), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe, among other awards. Lewis continues his career in films, TV, and theater.\n\nAfter studying at Eton, Jeremy Child worked for a short while in the City of London but left at his earliest opportunity, which was a disappointment to his father, who'd worked in the Foreign Office, and had hoped that his son would join the Guards. To please his father Jeremy had an interview for the Guards but when he was asked why he wanted to join he said 'I don't' and was told Well that's the end of your military career. He then went to drama school which was where he learned to fend for himself and to lose his somewhat posh accent. When his father died in the mid '70s Jeremy inherited his baronetcy, becoming Sir Jeremy, a title that he never used. He had a daughter Melissa from his first marriage and a daughter, Leonora and a son, Alexander from his second."
