        "text": "In its broadest sense, education conveys general bodies of knowledge and develops habits of the mind applicable to a broad spectrum of endeavors. Education is largely defined through cognitive learning (defined as content knowledge and development of intellectual skills) and affective learning (defined as the manner in which people deal with things emotionally: values, motivations, attitudes, enthusiasms, feelings, appreciation), and fosters breadth of view, diverse perspectives, jointness, critical analysis, abstract reasoning, comfort with ambiguity and uncertainty, innovative thinking, and ethical reasoning, particularly with respect to complex, nonlinear problems. This contrasts with training, which focuses largely through psychomotor and cognitive learning on the instruction of personnel to enhance their capacity to perform specific functions and tasks. Training and education are not mutually exclusive. Virtually all military schools and professional development programs include elements of education and training inacademic programs. Achieving success across the learning continuum relies on close coordination of training and education to develop synergies as personnel develop individually over time,acquiring and performing progressively higher order skills and responsibilities as their careers advance.\n\nColonel John A. Warden III is synonymous with the once-celebrated and still much-discussed “five rings” approach to air power targeting that the United State Air Force and its partners first attempted to utilize in 1991 during Gulf War I. Warden is less well known for his later tenure as Commandant of the Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) at the USAF Air University, even though he undertook reforms and introduced several ideas that transformed that relatively isolated college into a stronger and more influential education center. This article argues that Warden gained his appointment at the ACSC precisely at a time when, following the Goldwater-Nichols Act and the Skelton Report, the “professionalization” of the USAF began to place far greater stock on education. The article demonstrates that, operating with relative freedom and according to an idiosyncratic vision for the ACSC, Warden increased the rigor and robustness of the ACSC and also proved helpful in developing and inculcating concepts of air power that undoubtedly changed thinking in the USAF, at least for a time.\n\nAfter the success of the American Revolution, the nation’s founders grappled with the momentous task of building republican institutions that would define and develop the new nation. The establishment of the United States Military Academy at West Point was such an institution that ended up becoming the premier center in the nation for educating and training professional civil engineers scattering its graduates across the country in the most intensive era of road, canal, and railroad building in the history of the United States.\n\n10 articles: This almanac provides a comprehensive, chronological overview of all American military history, serving as the standard reference work of its type.
