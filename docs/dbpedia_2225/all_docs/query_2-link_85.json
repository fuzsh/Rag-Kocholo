Options include semester or year-long exchange programs at the universities of Hamburg and Tübingen as well as the summer intensive German program in Leipzig. Courses completed in these programs may be credited toward the German major or minor and in partial satisfaction of the International Studies requirement.\n\nAbout Leipzig\n\nLocated in the heart of Europe in former East Germany, Leipzig has a population of over 600,000. In the past, Leipzig was a center of trade fairs, the seat of the German Supreme Court, the leading center of libraries, publishing houses and the German book trade, and the hub of European trade. One thing which remains unchanged is Leipzig’s significance as a city of music, the arts and, above all, science and learning. Founded in 1409, its university is Germany’s second oldest. Leipzig’s historic importance is self-evident from its numerous magnificent buildings, now mostly refurbished, which include first-class sights such as the Old Town Hall, the Old Exchange, the old and new exhibition centers, and the Monument to the Battle of Leipzig. Located in a beautiful area of vistas, history, and culture, Leipzig is only two hours from Berlin, one hour from Dresden and Weimar, and three hours from Prague.\n\nCourses\n\nDuring the program’s first week, students participate in an orientation that familiarizes them with the university and the city. The orientation also includes an excursion to Dresden. The following three weeks consist of intensive language study and excursions outside of the city. Students take placement tests upon arrival and enroll in the appropriate level of German. Beginning students, who must have at least one semester of German or its equivalent, enroll in German 1002 for four credits. Intermediate students enroll in German 1003 or German 2001 for three credits plus a one-credit Independent Study in German Studies. Students placing at advanced levels may enroll in other advanced German courses: Advanced Composition or Intensive German, plus a one-credit Independent Study in German Studies.\n\nTop Faculty\n\nField Trips\n\nAccommodations & Meals\n\nCosts\n\nEligibility & Application Requirements\n\nEligibility and application requirements are listed online through the Office of Education Abroad and Overseas Campuses.
