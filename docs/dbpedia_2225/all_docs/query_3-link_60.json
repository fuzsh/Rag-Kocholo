        "text": "David Wagner, age 74, died peacefully at the home of his ex-wife Stephanie in Marysville, Washington from pancreatic cancer. David was born to Mildred and Arthur Wagner on February 22, 1947, in Fort Dodge, Iowa. David graduated from Hawthorne High school, California, with several Beach Boys as classmates. Drafted, David served with the Ninth Infantry Division in Vietnam, winning the Division Soldier of the Month award and the Army Commendation medal during the Tet Offensive of 1968. David returned from the war and married Stephanie Midlane, raising daughters Stacey and Taryn over the course of a 32-year marriage. Relocating to Seattle, David worked at the Seattle Times as a Technology Manager until retirement in 1999. While at the Times, David wrote a travel article about solo motorcycling titled \"Born to be Mild\", which was syndicated in four regional newspapers and won the American Motorcycle Association MVP award. In 1995, David founded Outpost, a Venture-capital-funded Internet startup. Outpost went public in 1999, after Wagner et al. won an Internet commerce Patent. David moved to Kona, where he discovered a love of tennis, playing competitively into his seventies, continued his world travels and served on the board of the Kona Crime Prevention Committee. David is survived by ex-wife Stephanie, daughters Stacey and Taryn, grandson Zachariah David, granddaughter Lyric, brother Richard Wagner (La Don), son-in-law Robert Reynolds and wonderful friends.
