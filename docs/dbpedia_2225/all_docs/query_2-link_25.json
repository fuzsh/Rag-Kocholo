        "text": "A silver Mercedes pulls up in front of the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia and out steps Dajuan Wagner, the 6-foot-2-inch graduate of nearby Camden, N.J., High and last year's high-school basketball player of the year. Wagner is accompanied by his 14-year-old sister, Dashonda, and by William Wesley, the man who has helped manage Wagner's career ever since Juanny, as his friends call him, was 11.\n\nIt is June. The N.B.A. finals are in full swing, and the Los Angeles Lakers are staying at the chaotic hotel. Security is tight, but Wagner is quickly ushered into a waiting elevator, and when the doors open a few floors later, he is smothered in a bear hug.\n\n''How you doing, bro?'' asks Shaquille O'Neal, his dome glimmering with sweat. ''I saw that guy steal your crossover in the McDonald's Game. I thought I taught you better than that.'' Wagner gives a sheepish shrug, and Shaq turns to Dashonda. ''Who's this beautiful thing?'' he says, winking at Wagner. ''Why didn't you give me her phone number?''\n\nBrother and sister giggle shyly and then follow Wesley down the hall to Ron Harper's room. The five-time N.B.A. champ is a longtime friend of Wesley's and has known Wagner since he was a toddler. As he irons away at a stubborn wrinkle in his linen pants, Harper brings up the 100-point game that Wagner turned in last January. ''Everyone is always talking about the 100 points -- nobody mentions that Juanny had eight assists,'' Harper says. ''He's got the game for the N.B.A. But college is going to help him make the transition from boy to man.''\n\nIn a year when an unprecedented six high-school players chose to forgo college and were drafted into the pros, there are many who might take Wagner's decision to continue school as encouraging news. But as Wagner himself points out, his decision was based largely on genetics. ''No little guy has gone straight to the N.B.A.,'' he says.\n\nJohn Calipari, Dajuan's coach this year at the University of Memphis, agrees. ''I kept praying he wouldn't grow to 6-6,'' Calipari says. ''If he's 6-6, I have to tell him to go pro.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
