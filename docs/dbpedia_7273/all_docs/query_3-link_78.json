        "text": "In the world of education, a principal wears many hats, but at the core, they remain an educator. My role from teacher to principal may have evolved, but the essence of teaching‚Äîguiding, inspiring, and nurturing‚Äîremains unchanged. Take, for instance, a moment from my early days as a principal. An experienced Head of Department, grappling with the notion of data-informed practice. We discussed ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù (as in why are you doing that and how do you know it is working), but more importantly, we explored the philosophy of teaching beyond the curriculum. It was a teaching moment not just for her, but for me as well, reinforcing the idea that my job is to educate leaders and teachers, as well as students. This experience is a testament to the fact that whether I'm mentoring an aspirant or devising policies with my leadership team, I am, at heart, still a teacher. The classroom may look different, and the lessons more diverse, but the goal is the same: to facilitate growth and learning in every interaction. As principals, we teach through our decisions, our empathy, and our vision for the school's future. We are the educators of educators, shaping not just student minds, but also the perspectives of those who lead them. Note: We do also go in classrooms and cover lessons. #LeadershipInEducation #PrincipalAsTeacher #EducationalLeadership #TeachQld #Ambassador #TeachStGeorgeSHS #education #leadership St George State High School , Queensland Department of Education\n\nLooking for a fall graduate course?

Learning, leading, and governing alongside Boards of Education, while also engaging with and alongside respective communities, has become commonplace within the Superintendency. As CEO/Superintendent of Gwinnett County Public Schools, our country‚Äôs 11th largest school district, that also resides in the 5th most diverse county in the nation, I am keenly aware of the importance of visiting our school classrooms, and extracurricular program offerings to observe, listen to, and learn from our outstanding Teachers, Students, Principals, Assistant Principals, Paraprofessionals, Counselors, Coaches, Custodians, and Cafeteria Staff, on both a regular, and unannounced basis. My sole purpose in visiting our schools is to develop relationships, to continue looking at, listening to, and learning about the successes and satisfying stories, as well as the opportunities and obstacles that may prevent us from achieving our goals sooner rather than later. Conducting school visits is undoubtedly one of the most important aspects of my leadership journey! #Look #Listen #Learn #CollaborativeLeadership #ConnectAndEngage #HereWeGo #AndHereWeGrow #TeamGCPS #gcpYES #CedarHillElementary\n\nThe Wallace Foundation recently published an article focused on busting five myths about the principalship. As a former principal at three different elementary schools, I certainly heard some of these myths in addition to others. For example, I often heard about the benefit about principals (and teachers) being off for the summer. For me, and likely most/all educators, even if we were on summer break, we were engaged in professional reading, professional learning opportunities, engaged in finding additional resources for our schools, and always planning for the new school year. I was always in \"school leader\" mode and never really \"off\" for the summer, even when I was on an actual vacation üòÅ #humanresources #principal #principals #educators #learning #teachers #edtech #students #teaching #leadership #schools #education The Wallace Foundation Association of Latino Administrators and Superintendent Association of California School Administrators California Association of Latino Superintendents and Administrators CSUN- Eisner College of Education USC Rossier School of Education Are there other myths you have heard of?
