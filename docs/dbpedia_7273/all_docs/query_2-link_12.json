He tries to act the part of the king, and in so doing he fascinates his employer’s daughter Marie, who forces from him a promise to marry her. When Bunker learns that after all he is not the king’s reincarnation, he is so discouraged that he tells Marie he cannot marry her. His friend Bud Matthews encourages him, however, and all goes well until a fight starts on the day of the wedding. Bunker wins the fight. And he wins Marie’s father over by making him spend a large sum of money to secure some stock.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMatt Moore as Bunker Bean\n\nDorothy Devore as Marie Breede\n\nDavid Butler as Bud Matthews\n\nGeorge Nichols as Jim Breede\n\nFrank Leigh as Professor Balthasar\n\nNora Cecil as Countess Casanova\n\nHenry A.
