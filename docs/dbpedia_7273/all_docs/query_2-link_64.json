So this program is calling my class using reflection.\n\nMy class needs to access a SpringComponent called titleService. I can get the bean the following away.\n\nApplicationContext ctx = SpringContext.getApplicationContext(); Object titleServiceObject = ctx.getBean(\"titleService\");\n\nThis works fine, but I have to use reflection to call the method I want since it is an Object and not a concrete class.\n\nI have tried to cast it to a TitleService object but I get the error:\n\norg.springframework.beans.factory.BeanNotOfRequiredTypeException: Bean named 'titleService' is expected to be of type 'com.title.TitleService' but was actually of type 'com.title.TitleService'\n\nI don't understand the error message since the class name for what is expected is the same as what it actually is.\n\nI have also tried getting the bean this way:\n\nTitleService titleService = ctx.getBean(TitleService.class)\n\nbut I get the same error.\n\nThe TitleService object has several autowired components so I cannot use \"new\" to create this object.\n\nHow can I get a TitleObject object?"
