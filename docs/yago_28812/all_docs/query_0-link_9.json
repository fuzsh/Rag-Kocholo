        "text": "Sophie Marie Viktoria was born on 7 August 1862, at Karlsruhe Castle in Baden, Germany. Her parents were Grand Duke Frederick I of Baden and Princess Louise of Prussia. Through her marriage to King Gustav V of Sweden, she was Queen from 1907 until her death in 1930. The couple married in 1881, shortly after meeting each other at a royal wedding in Germany. Pushed by family members, the union is said to have been a disaster. Between 1882 and 1889, Victoria gave birth to three children, but rumours of her husband’s sexuality strained the relationship. In an attempt to save their marriage, she travelled to Egypt with Gustav on two occasions during the 1890’s but ended up having an affair with one of her husband’s courtiers."
