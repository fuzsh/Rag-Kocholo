        "text": "Menu dated 19th September 1897\n\nLuncheon at the Royal Palace, Stockholm, hosted by Their Majesties King Oscar II and Queen Sofia of Sweden and Norway as a joint celebration for their 25th Jubilee and the wedding anniversary of their son and daughter-in-law (the future King Gustaf V and Queen Victoria of Sweden).\n\n​\n\nThere was a busy two days for the Swedish Royal Family in September 1897. On the day before this lunch the King and Queen celebrated their Silver Jubilee to mark 25 years on the dual thrones of Sweden and Norway.\n\nBut today’s luncheon was not in honour of the King and Queen; instead Their Majesties themselves were hosting a banquet in honour of others.\n\nOn the next day their son, the Crown Prince and future King Gustaf V, would celebrate his wedding anniversary to Princess Victoria of Baden (the future Queen Victoria of Sweden). The pair married on the 20th September 1881.\n\n​\n\nAs a consequence this menu was especially designed with two angels, beneath the King’s crown, draping the royal banners of the House of Bernadotte and the House of Baden representing the respective families of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess."
