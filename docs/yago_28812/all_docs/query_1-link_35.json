        "text": "Congrats\n\nI wish to congratulate HRH The Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Mr Daniel Westling on their engagement.\n\nAre there no suitable ROYALS, SERENES,or,ARISTOCRATS that the members of reigning European Royalty can marry? Almost every ROYAL seems to be getting married to a COMMONER.The last real royal wedding that I remember took place in 1999 when HSH The Princess Caroline of Monaco,heir presumptive,got married to HRH Prince Ernst-August of Hanover,Germany.(Caroline's mother was an American commoner,too!)\n\nThe last time an heir apparent to a European throne married a woman of equal rank was in 1993,when HSH The Crown Prince Alois of Liechtenstein and HRH Duchess Sophie of Bavaria,Germany,tied the knot.\n\nIn my book, ROYALTY should marry ROYALTY.Otherwise, I see no need them.Look at the DUTCH ROYALTY,for example,they are no longer \"full' royalty. Most of them have married commoners.The same is true of all the children of the reigning Danish monarch.\n\nAlso, ROYALS who are in line of succession to the throne should lose their succession rights should they marry commoners.\n\nRegards.\n\nI wish to congratulate HRH The Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Mr Daniel Westling on their engagement.\n\nAre there no suitable ROYALS, SERENES,or,ARISTOCRATS that the members of reigning European Royalty can marry?

E.g. the Habsburgs were going with the following saying:\n\nBella gerant alii, tu felix Austria nube\n\nTrans:May others wage war, you lucky Austria marry\n\nThese days Europe is united and all Monarchies are led by elected governments. No need to gain power by marrying a powerful rich Royal out of an other country.\n\nRoyals, who behave like the Whiskey Mist gang and/or who are self tired of the job are a real threat for the Monarchies, but \"commoners\"...don´t think so. After all the president, who would follow in case of abolishment, most likely would be a commoner too\n\nIf a country is wealthy, has no conflicts running...and if the Royals let their children grow in the public eye...and don´t behave like spoilt brats, who take their position for corruption, I don´t see a threat...\n\nI wish to congratulate HRH The Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Mr Daniel Westling on their engagement.\n\nAre there no suitable ROYALS, SERENES,or,ARISTOCRATS that the members of reigning European Royalty can marry?

I welcome Daniel, first because I believe he will be an excellent husband to Victoria and a support and friend for life. Secondly I welcome him because it is about time we get swedish blood in the royal family. I personally would not have given the monarchy any more chances of surviving if Victoria had chosen a foreign husband, no matter how royal he may be. I believe Victoria's choice will prove to be an excellent one.\n\nLooking at the ancestry of Victoria and going back to the first Bernadotte on the swedish throne I am not sure there is any swedish blood there.

So we have blue blood and blue-yellow blood, interesting\n\nOf course a Monarchy would have also survived a foreign man, if he would have had the right personality. Or it would have not survived, if the financial, political and economic circumstances wouldn´t have allowed it.\n\nI can´t think of any example of a Monarchy, which got abolished, while the ppl were living all rosy lives with lots of wealth, happiness and democracy..."
