Ryan Garcia was not even 18 when he inked his first professional contract. The Golden Boy Promotions group discovered him. The gifted boxer claimed his first title in his eleventh match, securing the NABF super featherweight belt.

Then, four years ago, he clinched the WBC Silver and WBO NABO in the lightweight category. All of this success was owing to knocking out Romero Duno at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. He defended his title in June 2020 and achieved his 20th career win.

At the onset of 2021, he bagged the WBC interim world championship in the lightweight category. His winning streak was snapped by Gervont Davis, who, in April of the preceding year, became the inaugural boxer to defeat Garcia.

In his personal life, too, the American encountered strife. In 2021, he tied the knot with Andrea Celina, and they were subsequently blessed with their daughter Rylie. In December 2023, the couple welcomed another child, as the boxer recently revealed.

An hour after heralding the birth of his son, Henry Leo Garcia, the 25-year-old declared that he was getting divorced. The news of his decision eventually vanished from his profile, but the information rapidly propagated on the internet.

"I am entering a novel phase in my life, and it is with a heavy heart that I share the news of Drea and I deciding to divorce. (...) Although this decision signifies the termination of our marriage, it should be underscored that our duties as parents remain our supreme priority," - Garcia wrote on social media.

The rationale behind the boxer's decision to erase the post remains a mystery. It's plausible that the public opinion, which condemned his decision regarding his wife, who recently gave birth to their second child, influenced him.
