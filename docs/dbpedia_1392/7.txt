Minimumweight (also referred to as strawweight or mini flyweight) is a weight class division in combat sports. The most notable of which is in professional boxing where boxers may weigh no more than 105 pounds (47.6271988500000000000000000000 kg). This is a relatively new weight category for professionals, first inaugurated by the major boxing sanctioning bodies between 1987 and 1990.

History[]

The minimumweight division was originally introduced in 1968 for the Summer Olympic Games under the name light flyweight. However the division was not recognized by any the four most widely-regarded sanctioning bodies until the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in June 1987 when Kyung-Yun Lee knocked out Masaharu Kawakami to become the inaugural champion.

The division was then later recognized by the World Boxing Council (WBC) in October 1987, the World Boxing Association (WBA) in January 1988, and the World Boxing Organization (WBO) in August 1989. While Ring magazine did not begin ranking minimumweights until 1997 under the name strawweights and has yet to name a champion in their rankings.

Historically the weight class has been dominated by Latin Americans (including, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Argentines, Panamanians, Venezuelans, and Dominicans) and Asians (including, Japanese, Chinese, Thais, Filipinos, Koreans, and Indonesians) with only a limited amount of success coming from other nationalities including, South Africans, Americans, Canadians, English, and Australians.

Late 1980s (1987-1989)

In the early years of the division, fighters such as Napa Kiatwanchai found success defending the WBC belt. Including early wins over a young up-and-coming Hiroki Ioka who later found success at light flyweight, flyweight, and super flyweight.

Other notable champions of this period included, Nico Thomas, Jum-Hwan Choi, Bong-Jun Kim, Rafael Torres, Samuth Sithnaruepol, and Leo Gamez.

1990s

Most of the 1990s were dominated by Ricardo López who is often cited as the best minimumweight ever. López holds a number of records in the division, including the most title defenses with 21. As well as being the first and (so far) only minimumweight to hold two different major titles simultaneously (WBC and WBO).

However other successful fighters of this period included,

Ratanapol Sor Vorapin, who found success defending his IBF title for most of the decade.

Chana Porpaoin, who found success in the early part of the decade defending the WBA title. Until losing the title to Rosendo Álvarez, who controlled the WBA title for the rest of the decade.

The division also saw its first champions not from Latin America or Asia. When Scotland's Paul Weir won the vacant WBO title over Fernando Martinez in May 1993. This was then followed by South Africa's Zolani Petelo who won the IBF title in December 1997.

Other notable fighters of this period included, Hi-Yong Choi, Hideyuki Ohashi, Alex Sánchez, Wandee Chor Chareon, Rocky Lin, Ala Villamor, Kermin Guardia, Noel Arambulet, Songkram Porpaoin, and Osvaldo Guerrero. [1]
