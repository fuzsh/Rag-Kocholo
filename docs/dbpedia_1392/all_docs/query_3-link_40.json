        "text": "Ryan Garcia is ready to prove doubters wrong following his loss to Gervonta Davis seven months ago. The California native faces Oscar Duarte at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas on December 2. The fight, plus undercard action, will air on DAZN worldwide.\n\nGarcia (23-1) has a massive social media following and talent to burn. The 25-year-old also has fast hands and punching power, as evidenced by his 19 wins via knockout.\n\nBut despite his quality, \"KingRy\" was dropped twice and knocked out by Davis in a fight that was to decide the future face of boxing. Looking to put this heartbreaking setback behind him, Garcia is focussed on writing the next chapter of his career.\n\n“[I'm] tired of disrespect. I'm fed up, and I've been at 50 percent for so long. It's going to be different. I promise that to myself,” said Garcia on social media via Boxing Scene. “I don't care about anything but becoming a world champion. My eyes used to care about social media and what that did for my career. Now, I don't care. I'm ready to win.”\n\nBorn in Mexico, Duarte (26-1-1) turned pro in 2013. He defeated Andres Garcia in 2020 for the NABF lightweight title and has had two wins in 2023. The 27-year-old now looks to upset oddsmakers by taking down Garcia.\n\nWATCH: Ryan Garcia vs. Oscar Duarte, live on DAZN\n\nOutside the main event, an interim title is on the line, while several young guns look to impress.
