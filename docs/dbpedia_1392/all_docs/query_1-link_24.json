        "text": "Neither Raul Garcia nor Robert Terry lost his “0” on Friday night.\n\nThe unbeaten junior middleweight prospects fought to an eight-round split draw in the opener of a “ShoBox: The New Generation” tripleheader from Cache Creek Casino Resort in Brooks, California. Judge Kermit Bayless scored the Dominican Republic’s Garcia a 77-75 winner, judge Marshall Walker credited Terry for a 77-75 win and judge Rey Danesco scored their competitive clash a draw, 76-76.\n\nSanto Domingo’s Garcia (12-0-1, 10 KOs) appeared to land the harder punches, but he was wild at times. Terry (9-0-1, 3 KOs), of Jersey City, New Jersey, tired toward the end of their bout, but he connected with his fair share of counter punches throughout the eight rounds.\n\nThe back-and-forth final round of their fight was reflective of how the judges saw it.\n\nA right hand by Garcia knocked Terry backward barely 1:20 into the eighth round. Garcia tattooed Terry with a left hook about 30 seconds into the eighth round, but Terry fired right back with a left hook of his own that backed up Garcia.\n\nTerry countered Garcia with a left that landed with just over 35 seconds to go in the seventh round. Garcia’s short left hook landed a little less than a minute into the seventh round.\n\nGarcia and Terry each landed punches from close distances during the final 30 seconds of a competitive sixth round.\n\nTerry connected with a right hand to the top of Garcia’s head with 1:10 on the clock in the sixth round. Terry drilled Garcia with a counter right hand just before the halfway point of the sixth round.\n\nGarcia and Terry both landed right hands in the final five seconds of the fifth round. Garcia’s left to the body connected with just over 30 seconds to go in the fifth round.\n\nA right hand by Terry staggered Garcia with just under 15 seconds remaining in the fourth round. Garcia tried to hold after absorbing that shot.\n\nTerry pushed Garcia to the canvas with about 40 seconds to go in the fourth round. Terry’s right hand landed with just over a minute on the clock in the fourth round.\n\nGarcia landed two right hands after the midway mark of the third round, which forced Terry to keep his distance temporarily.\n\nGarcia responded with a right hand after Terry landed a right hand about a minute into the third round. That shot caused Terry to initiate a clinch.\n\nTerry countered Garcia with a right-left combination a few seconds before the second round ended. Terry caught Garcia with two counter lefts within a 10-second span in the first half of the second round.\n\nTerry landed a counter left that knocked Garcia off balance toward the end of the first round. Garcia mostly missed with his right hands in the opening three minutes.\n\nKeith Idec is a senior writer/columnist for BoxingScene.com. He can be reached on Twitter @Idecboxing."
