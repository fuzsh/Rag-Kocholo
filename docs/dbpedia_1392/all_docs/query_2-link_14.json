        "text": "Demo­c­ra­t­ic Unit­ed States Sen­a­tor Maria Cantwell remains well ahead of like­ly Repub­li­can oppo­nent Raul Gar­cia and remains on course to eas­i­ly secure reelec­tion to a fifth term, the North­west Pro­gres­sive Insti­tute’s lat­est Wash­ing­ton state sur­vey has found.\n\n53% of 615 vot­ers sur­veyed last week by Pub­lic Pol­i­cy Polling said they’d vote for Cantwell for U.S. Sen­ate if the gen­er­al elec­tion were being held today. 38% said they would vote for Gar­cia, a Yaki­ma doc­tor who has the endorse­ment of the Wash­ing­ton State Repub­li­can Par­ty, the Main­stream Repub­li­cans of Wash­ing­ton, and a long list of promi­nent Repub­li­can fig­ures. 9% said they were not sure.\n\nIn our Feb­ru­ary sur­vey of Wash­ing­ton State, Cantwell led Gar­cia by a six­teen point mar­gin. Her fif­teen point advan­tage in this sur­vey is essen­tial­ly unchanged.\n\nGar­cia is one of ten oppo­nents who filed ear­li­er this month to chal­lenge Cantwell. Wash­ing­ton State law allows only two final­ists to appear on the gen­er­al elec­tion bal­lot, how­ev­er, and it’s unlike­ly that any of the oth­er indi­vid­u­als who filed will be able to vie with Cantwell and Gar­cia for those two spots. Here’s a com­plete list:\n\nAs I’ve not­ed before, none of Cantwell’s reelec­tion bids have been dif­fi­cult. Since she nar­row­ly pre­vailed over the late Slade Gor­ton in 2000, she’s had the good for­tune of run­ning in Demo­c­ra­t­ic wave years, specif­i­cal­ly 2006, 2012, and 2018.\n\nRegard­less of whether 2024 ends up being a Demo­c­ra­t­ic wave year or not, Wash­ing­ton has ceased to be a state where Repub­li­cans are com­pet­i­tive at a statewide lev­el, which will work to the advan­tage of Cantwell as well as those Democ­rats run­ning for exec­u­tive depart­ment posi­tions. (Democ­rats con­trol every sin­gle statewide exec­u­tive office.)\n\nNew par­ty chair Jim Walsh would like to win some statewide races this year, but he’s an arith­metic denier and unwill­ing to do what many Wash­ing­to­ni­ans have told us in our sur­veys would be nec­es­sary to get them to con­sid­er vot­ing Repub­li­can again: break with Don­ald Trump and the nation­al Repub­li­can Par­ty and adopt an agen­da that is faith­ful to the Unit­ed States Con­sti­tu­tion and the val­ues Wash­ing­ton was found­ed upon.\n\nThat’s a prob­lem for Garcia.\n\nWhile Gar­cia has a pleas­ant, affa­ble demeanor and lacks the bag­gage that has prompt­ed top Repub­li­can Mitch McConnell to grouse about Repub­li­cans’ issues with “can­di­date qual­i­ty,” he has not demon­strat­ed an acu­men for fundrais­ing (unlike Pat­ty Mur­ray’s van­quished foe Tiffany Smi­ley, who’s now run­ning for Con­gress), nor has he spo­ken out against his par­ty’s efforts to over­turn Amer­i­can democ­ra­cy, an essen­tial pre­req­ui­site for a Repub­li­can wish­ing to com­pete statewide in Wash­ing­ton nowadays.\n\nLocal right wing talk show hosts have made their dis­dain for Democ­rats’ use of Trump as a cud­gel abun­dant­ly clear — Ari Hoff­man was grum­bling about this last night — but they refuse to rec­og­nize the elec­toral real­i­ty that most vot­ers in Wash­ing­ton find Trump repul­sive. Vot­ers here don’t want to entrust the state or fed­er­al gov­er­nance to peo­ple who stand ready to serve as enablers for Trump and his hor­rif­ic schemes.\n\nAnd Gar­cia would be one of those enablers.\n\nCantwell, mean­while, can make a strong case for reelec­tion. She chairs the influ­en­tial Com­merce Com­mit­tee and has many accom­plish­ments to tout. Her work on CHIPS and Sci­ence and the more recent FAA reau­tho­riza­tion have been out­stand­ing. She also has put togeth­er a com­pelling pro­pos­al with Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Cathy McMor­ris Rodgers to cre­ate a new fed­er­al data pri­va­cy law that our research has found is very pop­u­lar.\n\nHere’s the ques­tion we asked and the respons­es we received:\n\nQUESTION: If the elec­tion for Unit­ed States Sen­ate were being held today and the can­di­dates were Demo­c­rat Maria Cantwell and Repub­li­can Raul Gar­cia, who would you vote for?\n\nANSWERS:\n\nMaria Cantwell: 53% (unchanged since February)\n\nRaul Gar­cia: 38% (-1% since February)\n\nNot sure: 9% (-1% since February)\n\nOur sur­vey of 615 like­ly 2024 Wash­ing­ton State vot­ers was in the field from Wednes­day, May 15th through Thurs­day, May 16th, 2024.\n\nThe poll uti­lizes a blend­ed method­ol­o­gy, with auto­mat­ed phone calls to land­lines (45%) and online answers from respon­dents recruit­ed by text (55%).\n\nIt was con­duct­ed by Pub­lic Pol­i­cy Polling (PPP) for the North­west Pro­gres­sive Insti­tute, and has a mar­gin of error of +/- 4.0% at the 95% con­fi­dence interval.\n\nNPI and PPP have worked togeth­er for a decade and have a track record of excel­lence, as detailed in this 2022 elec­toral polling recap and this 2020 one.\n\nThe trend so far this cycle, visualized\n\nBelow you can see all of our pre­vi­ous find­ings for this con­test plotted.\n\nInterested in diving into the crosstabs with us?\n\nIf you’re inter­est­ed in the crosstabs of our sen­a­to­r­i­al polling — past and present — we invite you to sub­scribe to The Chi­nook Bea­con, NPI’s newest pub­li­ca­tion and The Cas­ca­dia Advo­cate’s youngest sib­ling. The Bea­con, which just launched last week, is a newslet­ter avail­able exclu­sive­ly to pay­ing sub­scribers that pro­vides deep insights from our research as well as com­men­tary on elec­toral and polit­i­cal trends. Sub­scrip­tions cost $20/month or $240/year, and you can also become a Found­ing Mem­ber for $600/year.\n\nWe expect to pub­lish new edi­tions of The Bea­con every oth­er week through Novem­ber. After that, the pub­li­ca­tion sched­ule will like­ly go to twice a month.\n\nWe’ll have more senatorial polling this summer\n\nIn July, as the Top Two elec­tion draws close, we’ll check in again and take the pulse of the elec­torate in this and oth­er key races on the statewide ballot."
