        "text": "From Bullied To Boxer\n\nNonito Donaire is the third born of four children to Nonito Sr., who competed as an amateur boxer in America in the early 1990s. Older brother Glenn became a flyweight and cousin Richard a super flyweight.\n\nLike his countryman, Manny Pacquiao, Donaire lived in General Santos City, South Cotabato until he was six and attended the same school as did Pacquiao.\n\n“I had my share of poverty. I was a weak child. I was always sick,” said Donaire, whose paternal grandfather was born in Hawaii, granting his 11-year-old grandson US citizenship and the ability to join Nonito Sr. in Los Angeles in 1993.\n\n“My father never thought of me fighting. I started fighting because that was something that my family was really into. My first fight, my father trained me for 45 days. At 11 years old, I was getting bullied, always being made fun of. Walking into the ring, I literally pissed in my pants, I was so scared.”\n\nDonaire’s amateur record of 68-8 included winning three U.S. national championships -- the National Silver Gloves (1998), National Junior Olympics (1999) and the National USA Tournament (2000). Donaire also captured the 1999 International Junior Olympics gold medal,\n\nDonaire’s first 17 bouts covered weights ranging from 111 ½ and 119 ¾ pounds, producing a 16-1 mark with nine knockouts heading into 2007.\n\nDonaire debuted in February 2001 at 115 ½ pounds with a first-round knockout of Jose Lazaro. His next three bouts were a four-round unanimous decision loss to Rosendo Sanchez (March), a four-round unanimous decision over Saul Santoyo (June) and a first-round TKO of Jose Luis Torres (July).\n\n“The Filipino Flash” won thrice more in 2002: second-round knockouts of Noel Alma (May) and Khachosak Pothong (September) as well as a four-round unanimous decision over Mark Sales (November). In 2003 there was a first-round stoppage of Jorge Lopez (June), and two more wins in 2004 by fourth-round TKO and eight-round unanimous decision over Ricardo Barrera (June) and Gilberto Bolanos (November), respectively.\n\nDonaire’s 2005 featured knockouts of Paulino Villalobos (May) and Daniel Gonzalez (October) in the sixth and first rounds as well as six- and eight-round unanimous decisions over Larry Olvera (July) and Llido Julio (November).\n\nA natural right-hander with the ability to fight out of the southpaw stance, Donaire fought thrice more in 2006 with 10-round split- and 12-round unanimous decisions over Kahren Harutyunyan (January) and Oscar Andrade (October) flanking a second-round stoppage of Jose Luis Cardenas (July).\n\nA Matador’s Revenge On The Bull\n\nDonaire’s first-round stoppage of journeyman Kevin Hudgins (May 2007) set up a July clash with IBF world flyweight champion Vic “The Raging Bull” Darchinyan of Australia, who was 28-0 with 22 knockouts. Darchinynan was two bouts removed from a sixth round technical decision over Glenn Donaire and had stopped eight of his previous nine opponents.\n\nDonaire controlled the battle of southpaws. A massive counter left hook in the fifth round flattened Darchinyan. He rose on unsteady legs only to stumble against the ropes. Referee Eddie Claudio waved an end to the bout, crowning a new champion as Donaire earned revenge for his family against a 7-to-1 favorite.\n\n“Nobody believed in me,” said Donaire. “My brother told me he’s not as tough as he thinks he is. I took the bully out of him. This fight wasn’t just for me. It was for my family and the Filipino people, too. I could feel their energy tonight.”\n\nIn December 2007, Donaire successfully defended his new title, scoring an eighth-round TKO of former title challenger Luis Maldonado.\n\nIn August 2008, Donaire married Filipino-American Rachel prior to his second defense, November’s sixth-round TKO of Moruti Mthalane. In April 2009, Donaire’s third defense was a four-knockdown, fourth-round TKO over Raul Martinez, who was 24-0 (14 KOs) and had previously scored a 68-second stoppage of Victor Proa.\n\nDonaire then rose in weight to win the WBA’s interim 115-pound title by 12-round unanimous decision over Panama’s Rafael Concepcion, setting the stage for another big year.\n\nDonaire Detonates on Montiel\n\nIn February 2010, Donaire stopped former champion Manuel Vargas by third-round knockout in a non-title fight.\n\n“The Filipino Flash’s” WBA crown was on the line for the second and final time in July 2010 as he stopped southpaw Hernan Marquez during an eighth-round TKO victory.\n\nThat December, Donaire would rise in weight yet again, moving up to 118-pounds and delivering a fourth-round KO of Volodymyr Sodrenko.\n\nThat win set up a mega-bout versus WBC/WBO world bantamweight champion Fernando Montiel on February 19, 2011. Montiel, 44-2-2 (34 KOs) was riding an 11-0-1 unbeaten streak that included nine knockouts.\n\nIt was supposed to be the toughest fight of Donaire’s career. Instead, it turned into one the finest clips on his long highlight reel. Donaire stopped Montiel for the first time in his career, lowering the boom as a head-swiveling left hook temple shot flattened the Mexican in the second round.\n\n“I predicted this second round knockout,” said Donaire, “I believe that God has a plan. I want to be the undisputed champion in this weight class.”\n\nDonaire made one defense of the WBC/WBO crowns in October 2011, a shutout unanimous decision over reigning 115-pound champion Omar Narvaez.\n\nA Four-Division, Unified Champion\n\nDonaire climbed to 122 pounds to go 4-0 with a pair of knockouts in 2012. His year began with February’s 12-round split-decision over former champion Wilfredo Vazquez Jr. for the WBO’s junior featherweight crown – his fourth in as many divisions.\n\nThat July, Donaire added the IBF title to his. WBO, winning a 12-round Donaire’s unanimous decision over South African Jeffrey Mathebula.\n\nIn October, he registered a ninth-round knockout of former title holder Toshiaki Nishioka.\n\nDonaire closed 2012 with his third and final WBC/WBO title defense, a three-knockdown, third-round stoppage of former champion Jorge Arce in December.\n\nOvercoming a rough patch\n\nDespite scoring a 10th-round knockdown, Donaire lost an April 2013 junior featherweight unification bout by unanimous decision to left-handed WBA counterpart Guillermo “The Jackal” Rigondeaux.\n\nNovember’s 126-pound debut was a return bout with Darchinyan, who led, 78-74, on two cards with the third tied at 74 when Donaire – ailing from a broken right cheek bone – sandwiched a pair of left hooks around a straight right to floor to eventually stop the Armenian via ninth-round TKO.\n\nDonaire’s fifth-round technical decision over Simpiwe Vetyekam in May 2014 featured a fourth-round knockdown, enabling him to dethrone the South African as WBA featherweight title holder and become a five-division champion. The bout ended on a cut over Donaire’s eye that resulted from an accidental clash of heads.\n\nBut Donaire was dethroned in his next bout via sixth-round TKO in October, being floored twice by Jamaican slugger Nicholas Walters, who rose to 25-0 (21 KOs) with his fifth straight stoppage.\n\nClimbing the Ladder Again\n\nDonaire returned to 122 pounds to go 4-1 with three knockouts over the course of 2015 and 2016, the former comprising second-round TKOs of William Prado (March) and Anthony Settoul (July) and a unanimous decision over Cesar Juarez (December) for the WBO’s vacant crown.\n\nThe ensuing year brought a third-round TKO of Zsolt Bedak (April). But Donaire was dethroned following a unanimous decision loss to southpaw Jessie Magdelano in November.\n\nDonaire rose yet again into the 126-pound division for his next two bouts, one a victory over Ruben Garcia Hernandez in September 2017 and the other a loss to Carl Frampton.\n\nFighting at 118 for the first time since November 2011, Donaire became the WBA champion in November 2018 as Ryan Burnett was forced to retire on his stool between the fourth and fifth rounds.\n\nDonaire’s first defense was a sixth-round knockout of Stephon Young in April 2019, securing his place in the World Boxing Super Series’ bantamweight finals against Japanese IBF counterpart Naoya Inoue.\n\nInoue won a hard-fought unanimous decision over Donaire in their November 2019 clash, one of the best that year\n\nBut Donaire (40-6, 26 KOs) had proven himself, against Inoue, who was a heavy favorite and considered one of the very best fighters in the world.\n\n“The 20 years of being in boxing can drain your motivation, but I gave him hell, felt unstoppable and was in tremendous shape in my mind, body and spirit,\" said Donaire. \"I have a lot left in power and speed to be an elite fighter and to try to take over the division and the world.”\n\nAn Absolute Legend\n\nOn May 29, 2021, 14 years after he won his first world title, Donaire became champion once again. The “Filipino Flash” cemented his Hall of Fame credentials with a sensational fourth-round KO win over Nordine Oubaali to capture the WBC World Bantamweight title in a PBC on SHOWTIME main event from Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California.\n\n“The king has returned,” Donaire beamed afterward. “I just love the crowds. All my friends, family, all the boxing fans that came out thank you so much. You guys are wonderful.”\n\nThe 38-year-old Donaire (41-6, 27 KOs) is now the oldest world champion ever at 118-pounds. He accomplished it with the left hand that has been the calling card of his career as he dropped Oubaali (17-1, 12 KOs) three times in total.\n\n“Being at this age is not the question, it’s about my performance,” said Donaire. “About my ability to grow. I believe it matters not what your age is, but how mentally strong you are. What I learned from the [Naoya] Inoue fight is that I’m back. I can still compete at this level. The whole time I was not fighting, I was learning. I’m ready for the next one.”\n\nFollowing a feel-out first round, Donaire went to work in the second, walking Oubaali down and countering with thudding effect. Donaire scored the first knockdown early in the third, dropping Oubaali with his trademark counter left hook. The Frenchman rose on unsteady legs and Donaire pounced, landing more big shots until another left hook floored Oubaali just a split second before the round ended. Again, Oubaali struggled to his feet, dazed yet willing to fight on.\n\nThe end came swiftly in the fourth. Donaire expertly maneuvered Oubaali around the ring, pinning him against the ropes where a left uppercut sent Oubaali crumpling to the canvas for a third and final time. Referee Jack Reiss immediately called it off. The official time of the stoppage was 1:52 of the fourth round.\n\n“Three decades of being world champion. Nine-time world champion. That’s amazing,” said Donaire. “I came in here and I felt really good. Today I knew exactly what was going to happen. I knew exactly what I was going to do. I think I was just very focused in the gym. I was very, very focused. I just felt really good coming in and I was grateful to get this opportunity.\"\n\nBetter Than Ever\n\nOn December 11, 2021, Donaire defended his WBC 118-pound title for the first time, taking on unbeaten mandatory challenger Reymart Gaballo at Dignity Health Sports Park, live on PBC on SHOWTIME. Donaire looked as good as ever, stopping Gaballo in four rounds.\n\n“I've been in this game for such a long time and I've had so many fights, I didn't think I was going to have to feel him out,” Donaire said. “But he came out differently than I thought he would. He tried to nullify my left hook, but I just had to have no mercy.”\n\nDonaire (42-6, 28 KOs) began going to the body early, mixed in with a lead right. He had the 25-year-old Gaballo (24-1, 20 KOs) backing up. By the third, Gaballo had established a good jab and staggered Donaire back with a right hand with 2:18 left in the round. But Donaire had time to reset, with Gaballo getting cut above the right eye from a clash of heads.\n\nIn the fourth, Donaire dropped a right to the body with :25 left in the round, which had Gaballo retreating back to the ropes. Eleven seconds later, Donaire plunged a left into Gaballo, who fell to his right knee to take referee Ray Corona’s count.\n\nGaballo tried getting up and fell back down again.\n\n“My wife and my dad were telling me to go to the body,” Donaire said. “I had to set it up by bouncing up and down to open up that shot. I was throwing the right hand in the earlier rounds and then he didn't expect the left hook to the body.\n\n“I thought he was going to get up because I know he has a lot of heart, but that was a tremendous punch that landed. I just told him after the fight not to be down. Because he's a great fighter. I had trouble figuring him out and I'm here to help him with anything he needs the rest of his career.”\n\nIn June 2022, Donaire would drop another loss to Inoue, this time via second-round TKO in Japan. Then on July 29, 2023, Donaire would lose a spirited 12-round decision to Alexandro Santiago for the vacant WBC bantamweight world title.\n\n“I’m disappointed,” said Donaire. “This is a blessing to do this for a very long time. I feel good still. Congratulations to Alexandro. He deserves it. He is a tough guy.”\n\nAt 40-years-old, Donaire had been looking to break his own record as the oldest fighter to ever win a bantamweight world title, but will now regroup as he considers if he’ll continue his illustrious career.\n\n“I love the sport so much,” said Donaire. “We just have to go back to the locker room, talk about it, and see where we go from there. There were just some times there where I didn’t pull the trigger. That was my biggest problem.”"
