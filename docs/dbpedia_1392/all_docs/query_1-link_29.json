        "text": "Not sure how tall he is, but Im going with Calderon. I hope he gets the win then considers retirement. Only because he's been in a lot of fights and I don't want him to ruin his legacy in his older age. He was the quintessential perfect technician of boxing, no power but crazy skills.\n\n105 is always been calderon best weight and even there he's small as hell but if he wins and defends the title a few times he can go down as the best 105 boxer in history surpassing finito lopez\n\n:hat\n\natsch\n\n:rofl:rofl:nono\n\nwhy not finito lopez resume is filled with unknowns and scrubs if you look at both fighters resume at 105 the're both similar and you can make a case for calderon having faced the better opposition\n\nplus calderon tested himself by going up in weight and fighting a few goods ones there unlike lopez who was afraid of fighting la chiquita or carbajal\n\n:hat\n\nso he'll be one of the shortest guys calderon has fought and still he's three inches shorter but that's not as much as other fighters he has faced\n\n:hat\n\nCalderon is one of the best tacticians ive ever seen,I hope he can get a couple good ones in before he hangs them up, he had no chance against segura in that Lego sized ring they put him in:verysad"
