        "text": "Wash­ing­ton’s Demo­c­ra­t­ic Unit­ed States Sen­a­tor Maria Cantwell is in the best posi­tion she’s ever been in for reelec­tion, hav­ing widened her lead over like­ly Repub­li­can chal­lenger Raul Gar­cia to twen­ty-three points, the North­west Pro­gres­sive Insti­tute’s July 2024 Top Two poll of the Ever­green State elec­torate has found.\n\n55% of 581 like­ly August 2024 Top Two vot­ers inter­viewed last week by Pub­lic Pol­i­cy Polling for the North­west Pro­gres­sive Insti­tute say they’re vot­ing for Cantwell in the first part of Wash­ing­ton’s two-part gen­er­al elec­tion sys­tem. 32% said they’re vot­ing for Gar­cia, who is endorsed by the Wash­ing­ton State Repub­li­can Par­ty, Rob McKen­na, Dino Rossi, and a long list of promi­nent Repub­li­cans. 6% said they’re vot­ing for anoth­er can­di­date not named in our sur­vey. An addi­tion­al 7% said they were not sure.\n\nCantwell’s lead is not only her biggest of the cycle, it’s the largest for either her or Pat­ty Mur­ray that we have ever seen in our own U.S. Sen­ate polling.\n\nCantwell, six­ty-five, is Wash­ing­ton’s junior Unit­ed States Sen­a­tor. She was first elect­ed in 2000, nar­row­ly unseat­ing Repub­li­can incum­bent Slade Gor­ton. She has been eas­i­ly reelect­ed three times since then, all in Demo­c­ra­t­ic wave years: 2006, 2012, and 2018. She defeat­ed insur­ance exec­u­tive Mike McGav­ick in 2006, leg­is­la­tor Michael Baum­gart­ner in 2012, and ex-WSRP Chair and tele­vi­sion anchor Susan Hutchi­son in 2018.\n\nCantwell cur­rent­ly chairs the Com­merce Com­mit­tee in the Unit­ed States Sen­ate and is known for her work on finan­cial reg­u­la­tion, avi­a­tion, and tech­nol­o­gy pol­i­cy. She has a very pro­gres­sive, pop­ulist vot­ing record on a range of key eco­nom­ic issues, hav­ing vot­ed against the bank bailout in 2008 and against Ben Bernanke as Fed Chair in 2009. She also vot­ed against John Roberts to be a Unit­ed States Supreme Court Justice.\n\nGar­cia is a physi­cian from Yaki­ma who pre­vi­ous­ly ran unsuc­cess­ful­ly for gov­er­nor in 2020. He decid­ed to run for gov­er­nor again this year, but switched to run­ning for U.S. Sen­ate after Dave Reichert decid­ed to pur­sue a guber­na­to­r­i­al cam­paign. Gar­cia has espoused posi­tions that are less rad­i­cal than those of his fel­low Repub­li­cans, espe­cial­ly on repro­duc­tive rights, but has not gained much trac­tion, as our research shows.\n\nA total of eleven can­di­dates filed to run for Unit­ed States Sen­ate in Wash­ing­ton this year with the Sec­re­tary of State. They are list­ed on the August bal­lot as follows:\n\nMel Ram (Prefers Repub­li­can Party)\n\nDr Raul Gar­cia (Prefers GOP Party)\n\nDavid Tilton (Prefers Non-Par­ti­san Party)\n\nMaria Cantwell (Prefers Demo­c­ra­t­ic Party)\n\nChuck Jack­son (Prefers Inde­pen­dent Party)\n\nIsaac A Holyk (Prefers Repub­li­can Party)\n\nHen­ry Clay Den­ni­son (Prefers Social­ist Work­ers Party)\n\nScott Nazari­no (Prefers Repub­li­can Party)\n\nPaul Lawrence Giesick (Prefers Demo­c­ra­t­ic Party)\n\nThor Amund­son (Prefers Inde­pen­dent Party)\n\nGood­spaceguy (Prefers Repub­li­can Party)\n\nGar­cia and Cantwell’s names are bold­ed for emphasis.\n\nWash­ing­ton holds a qual­i­fy­ing elec­tion to decide who appears on the gen­er­al elec­tion bal­lot, rather than a real pri­ma­ry. That means vot­ers don’t get to pick par­ty nom­i­nees. Instead, the top two vote get­ters in every race advance to a Novem­ber runoff regard­less of par­ty. It is pos­si­ble for both final­ists to be either Democ­rats or Republicans.\n\nOf the eleven can­di­dates, only three have raised money:\n\nCantwell has raised $11,749,248.74 and spent $5,289,290.17.\n\nGar­cia has raised $596,882.70 and spent $428,003.60.\n\nIsaac Holyk has raised $7,716.75 and spent $6,712.19.\n\nA fourth can­di­date, Paul Lawrence Giesick, has report­ed spend­ing $6,910.20 to the Fed­er­al Elec­tions Com­mis­sion, but has not report­ed receiv­ing any contributions.\n\nIt’s rea­son­able to assume that Cantwell and Gar­cia are on a fast track to the Novem­ber gen­er­al elec­tion, which is why they were the only can­di­dates named in our poll ques­tion. How­ev­er, because we polled a uni­verse of Top Two vot­ers and there are nine oth­er can­di­dates, we deemed it rea­son­able to include “anoth­er can­di­date” as an option.\n\nHere’s the exact ques­tion we asked and the responses:\n\nQUESTION: In the Top Two elec­tion for Unit­ed States Sen­ate, are you vot­ing for Demo­c­rat Maria Cantwell, Repub­li­can Raul Gar­cia, or anoth­er candidate?\n\nANSWERS:\n\nMaria Cantwell (D): 55%\n\nRaul Gar­cia (R): 32%\n\nAnoth­er can­di­date: 6%\n\nNot sure: 7%\n\nOur sur­vey of 581 like­ly 2024 August Top Two vot­ers in Wash­ing­ton was in the field from Wednes­day, July 24th through Thurs­day, July 25th.\n\nThe poll uti­lizes a blend­ed method­ol­o­gy, with auto­mat­ed phone calls to land­lines (32%) and online answers from respon­dents recruit­ed by text (68%).\n\nIt was con­duct­ed by Pub­lic Pol­i­cy Polling (PPP) for the North­west Pro­gres­sive Insti­tute and has a mar­gin of error of +/- 4.0% at the 95% con­fi­dence interval.\n\nNPI and PPP have worked togeth­er for a decade and have a track record of excel­lence, as detailed in this 2022 elec­toral polling recap and this 2020 one.\n\nThe recent WA Poll com­mis­sioned by The Seat­tle Times, KING5, and UW’s Cen­ter for an Informed Pub­lic also found Cantwell with a very com­fort­able lead.\n\nIn that sur­vey, which was con­duct­ed by Sur­veyUSA, Cantwell gar­nered 58%, Gar­cia got 37%, and 5% were unde­cid­ed — a twen­ty-one point advan­tage. The sam­ple con­sist­ed of 564 like­ly vot­ers, and the poll field­ed July 10th-13th, 2024.\n\nOur newest sur­vey results align nice­ly with their find­ing, and sug­gest Cantwell is in very good shape for reelec­tion. Gar­cia may be a more hon­or­able and respectable oppo­nent than Repub­li­cans Susan Hutchi­son or Michael Baum­gart­ner were six and twelve years ago, but Gar­cia is not putting Wash­ing­ton in play for his par­ty. Nation­al Repub­li­cans’ atten­tion is else­where, any­way. Repub­li­cans hope to unseat Jon Tester in Mon­tana and Sher­rod Brown in Ohio, for exam­ple. They are let­ting Cantwell be, only two years after aggres­sive­ly and unsuc­cess­ful­ly back­ing Pat­ty Mur­ray’s last chal­lenger Tiffany Smiley.\n\nThe trend so far this cycle, visualized\n\nBelow you can see all of our pre­vi­ous find­ings for this con­test plotted.\n\nCantwell’s advan­tage was fif­teen points in May. Although respon­dents had the option of pick­ing a can­di­date not named in our July sur­vey, Cantwell nev­er­the­less improved her stand­ing, where­as Gar­cia slipped by a sub­stan­tial amount.\n\nInterested in diving into the crosstabs with us?\n\nIf you’re inter­est­ed in the crosstabs of our sen­a­to­r­i­al polling — past and present — we invite you to sub­scribe to The Chi­nook Bea­con, NPI’s newest pub­li­ca­tion and The Cas­ca­dia Advocate’s youngest sib­ling. The Bea­con, which just launched last week, is a newslet­ter avail­able exclu­sive­ly to pay­ing sub­scribers that pro­vides deep insights from our research as well as com­men­tary on elec­toral and polit­i­cal trends. Sub­scrip­tions cost $20/month or $240/year, and you can also become a Found­ing Mem­ber for $600/year.\n\nWe’ll have more senatorial polling this autumn\n\nDur­ing the final weeks of the cycle, once autumn is in full swing, we’ll check in again and take the pulse of the elec­torate in this and oth­er key races on the statewide ballot."
