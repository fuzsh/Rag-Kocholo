        "text": "Published July 31, 2015 8:09pm\n\nThe World Boxing Council has ordered a final title eliminator to take place within the year between hard-hitting Iloilo native Denver Cuello and Raul Garcia Hirales of Mexico.\n\nThe winner of the said contest will then receive a mandatory title shot against WBC world minimumweight champion Wanheng Menayothin.\n\nCuello (36-5-6, 24KOs), who is ranked no. 1 in the minimumweight division by the WBC, is riding on a three-fight win streak since suffering a points defeat in his lone world title bid against Xiong Chao Zhong a couple of years ago.\n\nHirales (36-3-1, 22KOs), meanwhile, is a former world title holder in the division currently at no. 2 in the organization's world rankings.\n\n\"I already sent an offer to promote the fight here in the Philippines,\" Cuello's manager Aljoe Jaro told GMA News Online.\n\n\"The target date is September 26 and hopefully we get a shot at the world title before the end of the year should Cuello emerge victorious.\"\n\nJaro says he's looking to host the fight at either Ynares Sports Arena in Pasig or Resorts World in Pasay. â€”JST, GMA News"
