        "text": "American boxer and boxing trainer\n\nNot to be confused with Roberto García (Mexican boxer).\n\nRoberto Garcia Cortez (born January 29, 1975) is a Mexican-American former professional boxer who competed from 1992 to 2001, and held the IBF junior lightweight title from 1998 to 1999. He has since worked as a boxing trainer, and was voted Trainer of the Year by The Ring magazine in 2011, and by the Boxing Writers Association of America in 2012.[1][2] He is the older brother of professional boxer Mikey Garcia, who was a world champion in four weight classes.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in San Pedro, Los Angeles, Garcia grew up and still resides in Oxnard, California, and was trained by his father Eduardo Garcia at the La Colonia Youth Boxing Club.[4][5] Garcia said that he has been in Oxnard, California, since he was two years old.[6] He considers himself to be Mexican, and has said that his father and mother are both of Mexican descent.[7] He said that his parents were illegal immigrants until the eighties.[8] He said that he grew up speaking Spanish, and that he learned to speak English when he went to school.[9][10]\n\nAmateur career\n\n[edit]\n\nRobert Garcia had an extensive amateur career, but rumors about him fighting De La Hoya are unfounded. Although, Garcia has acknowledged sparring and training with the Hall of Famer.\n\nEven so, his professional and amateur career are internationally recognized.[11]\n\nProfessional career\n\n[edit]\n\nKnown as \"Grandpa\", Garcia won his pro debut against Tsutomu Hitono at the International Center in Fukuoka, Japan.[12] He accumulated a record of 20–0, which included a win against future champion Derrick Gainer, before challenging for his first regional title.[citation needed]\n\nNABF super featherweight champion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1995 he took down the previously unbeaten American Julian Wheeler to win his first belt, the NABF Super Featherweight Championship.[13] He successfully defended his championship just three months later against Francisco Segura.[14]\n\nNABF featherweight champion\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the Miami Arena, Garcia moved down to Featherweight and beat Darryl Pinckney to win the NABF Featherweight Championship.[15]\n\nIBF super featherweight champion\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 13, 1998 a then undefeated Garcia (29–0) captured the vacant IBF Super Featherweight Championship with a unanimous decision win over Harold Warren.[16] In his first title defense he knocked out Cuban Ramon Ledon at the Trump Taj Mahal, Atlantic City, New Jersey.[17]\n\nHis next fight was against two-time World Champion, Puerto Rico's John John Molina. Garcia defeated Molina over twelve rounds; that fight card also featured Mike Tyson, Zab Judah, and Fres Oquendo.[18] He lost the belt in an upset to rising undefeated phenom Diego Corrales. After a win over title contender Sandro Marcos he moved back up in the world rankings.[citation needed]\n\nWBA super featherweight title challenge and retirement\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2001, he earned a shot at the undefeated WBA Super Featherweight champion Joel Casamayor. Casamayor won the fight and Garcia retired shortly after beating veteran John Trigg by knockout.\n\nTraining career\n\n[edit]\n\nGarcia worked as a trainer at La Colonia Gym in Oxnard, California. Notable fighters who have trained under Garcia include Nonito Donaire and Tony Ferguson.[19] Most recently he opened his own boxing gym named Robert Garcia Boxing Academy in Oxnard, California.[20][21]\n\nNotable boxers trained\n\n[edit]\n\nChristopher Algieri, former WBO World Light Welterweight Champion\n\nAllan Benitez,[22] Lightweight boxer\n\nAlfonso Blanco, Light
