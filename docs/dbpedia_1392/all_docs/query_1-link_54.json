        "meta_description": "Texas Kajukenbo Gaylord Method to host 12th Annual Memorial Karate Tournament to Help Fight Cancer\n\n\n\nBy RAUL GARCIA JR | The Mercedes Enterprise\n\n\n\nThe late Grandmaster Juan “Johnny Valdivia” opened his karate school in Mercedes in the mid 70’s, and he grew his school into one of the most fierce and competitive dojos in the Rio Grande Valley over a period of thirty-eight years.\n\n\n\nValdivia was inducted into the South Texas Black Belt Association Hall of Fame in 2022 for being one of the leaders in Valley Martial Arts and for training so many students.\n\n\n\nKarate Class begins at 6:30 p.m. Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The karate school offers professional martial arts training for all ages. Class is located Downtown Mercedes at 143 Texas Avenue, Mercedes, Texas. For more info see www.TexasKajukenbo.com\n\n\n\nValdivia was known as the “Hit Teacher” and no nonsense instructor  who taught with an iron fist in a velvet glove.\n\n\n\nToday his legacy continues as many students and their parents continue to train at his school long after his death in 2008 when he died of cancer.\n\n\n\nToday, his school is led by his top student, Grandmaster Armando Saldana who began training with his three daughters in the early 80’s. Each of them attaining the rank of Black Belt.\n\n\n\nThe Tournament\n\n\n\nOne of Valdivia’s dying wishes was for Saldana to continue the school and use his annual Mercedes Karate School Tournament to raise funds to help fight cancer to offer assistance to families living though the life threatening crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaldana has done just that in honor of his teacher and helps the Light of Hope James Richard Closner Foundation continue its mission to help families with assistance from proceeds raised from the tournament.\n\n\n\nThis year marks the 12th Annual Texas Kajukenbo Memorial Tournament and it will be held at Chacon Middle School on April 20, in Mercedes. Last year more than 200 people attended and participated in the event showcasing some of the finest students in martial arts from around the Valley and South Texas.\n\n\n\nThe Karate School\n\n\n\nThe Texas Kajukenbo School of  Karate shares the Gaylord Method teachings, combat principles and Kajukenbo concepts, allowing for individuation and self-growth.\n\n\n\n “My instructor is a great Grandmaster who has been teaching for decades, so his teachings are very old-school,” said Jose Sanchez.\n\n\n\nThe school prides itself  in  not being just about kicking and punching, but about reaching out to the community to lend a hand where it can.  \n\n\n\n“While on the path to becoming a KAA Black Belt students are expected to carry themselves with manners and respect in everything they do,” Grandmaster Saldana said. “Our karate school offers professional martial arts training for all ages and skill levels. Our skilled instructors strive to help students reach their full potential. Join our school and  improve your self defense, physical health and discipline.”\n\n\n\nThe Texas Kajukenbo Karate School students were promoted to higher ranks after dedicated training and practice. Standing Left to Right Lupe Pena, Aida Saldana, Esmeralda Mejia, Ben Rodriguez, Johnathan Sanchez, Joanna Sanchez, Jovaughn Serna, Myra Elizondo, Raul Garcia, Seth Prado and Armando Saldana. In front Left to Right are Larissa Rodriguez, Jesus Bocanegra and A.J. Ybarra.\n\n\n\nThe Legacy\n\n\n\nToday many of Valdivia’s students continue training and teaching at the school with Saldana.  Black Belts Lupe Pena, AJ Ybarra, Elora De La Cerda and Mike Tinajero,  who has plans to offer Gracie Jujitsu to students.\n\n\n\nGaylord Method \n\n\n\nValdivia’s school joined the Kajukenbo of America Association led by the late Great Grandmaster Charles H. Gaylord after it was introduced by Grandmaster Jose Quiroz. Gaylord visited the Mercedes school several times and promoted Valdivia and Saldana to high ranking black belts. Gaylord first brought the style of Kajukenbo karate from Hawaii where it was developed and began training students in California in the 1970s. Gaylord in 1980, received 9th degree Black Belt from Kajukenbo founder Adriano Emperado. In September 1995,  Gaylord was promoted to the  rank of Tenth-Degree Black Belt by the KAA.\n\n\n\nGrandmaster Armando Saldana",
