        "text": "Maybe against Joe Pesci the way gimmick boxing is going these days.\n\nI love his shirt !! Where did he buy that ?\n\nDoubt he paid a dime, since Ring Magazine is a subsidiary of his own company.\n\nThey should sell shirts then since their magazines are not around anymore, I mean the printed versions.. I which their printed magazines was still around (are they ? No, right ?).\n\nYeah, they went all digital about ten months ago now.\n\nYeah, I'm old enough to be one of those that likes to grab something in order to read, I don't wanna read something over the screen of my ****ing cellphone, not good.\n\n\"tie up Curiel on the inside\", hope he don't do that, it's late here in the \"global south\", I got get up 7 am tomorrow, finish this early Raúl.\n\nBack in the day you would never see big mexican guys, there are so many now, this guy can be a middleweight it seems, must cut a lot of weight.\n\nRound 1\n\nPennington is faking steps inside, throwing a left jab feint. Curiel watches and stalks, reaching in with a couple of straight flurries. Pennington coasting to his left, arms down, relaxed. Curiel flurries in and Pennington clinches briefly. Pennington is popping jabs, ducking, rising, melting away to his side. Smooth old school boxing. Curiel just keeps rapping on the front door with jabs and rights down the pipe while following Pennington around the ring, not showing much yet to justify the hype. Pennington doing a good job avoiding the power, scoring with light jabs and then easing off, rolling with anything that does touch him. Crowd getting behind Curiel as he studies Pennington. Jab and grab by Pennington, scoring and then leaping in.\n\n10-9 Pennington\n\nNow this Pennigton guy is what I call a good opponent for a up and coming young guy, this one is probably going the distance. Pennington knows what he is doing."
