        "text": "July 10 Bangkok, Thailand Super Fly: Petch Sor Chitpattana (19-0) W PTS 10 Roman Canto (8-2-2)\n\nWBC No 11 Chitpattana retains WBC Silver Youth title with unanimous decision over Filipino. The 19-year-old southpaw is making steady progress after turning pro at 15. Late substitute Canto had two draws and a loss in his previous three fights. July 12 Las Vegas, NV, USA Super Bantam: Chris Avalos (22-2) W PTS 10 Drian Francisco (24-2-1). Light Middle: Glen Tapia (19-0) W TKO 8 Abraham Han (19-1). Super Middle: Jesses Hart (8-0) W TKO 2 Eddie Hunter (7-10-2). Super Feather: Toka Kahn Clary (6-0,1ND) W TKO 2 Pablo Torres (7-6-2). Light: Erick De Leon (4-0) W PTS 4 Alejandro Ochoa (1-1)\n\nAvalos vs. Francisco Big win for Avalos over former interim WBA title challenger Francisco in a fight which was important for the career of both men. Avalos used an enormous work rate that Francisco could not match to clinch this one. On the other hand Francisco was landing the heavier and more eye-catching shots. The younger man was setting that fast pace but Filipino Francisco was catching him with hard counters as Avalos was holding his hands too low. Both were swinging wildly at times and there was too much clinching for it to be a good fight with Avalos getting away with some blatant rabbit punches inside. However at times the action was exciting with both throwing bombs without due care and attention with Avalos only pulling away over the late rounds to just deserve the decision. Scores 97-93 twice and a more accurate looking 96-94. Avalos, 23, WBA 5/WBC 6 has lost only to Chris Martin and Jonathan Romero, both on split decisions. Wins over Yenifel Vincent (23-0-2) and trial horse Jose Luis Araiza put him back on track. Francisco, 30, lost a very close decision (two judges had it 114-113) to Tepparith for the interim WBC super fly title in 2011, his only loss in his 26 fights before this loss to Avalos.\n\nBoxing\n\nOlympic medallist Richardson ready to become boxing pro\n\n13/08/2024 at 16:03\n\nTapia vs. Han On paper it looked a good match up of unbeaten former top amateurs as they both moved up to the ten round class for the first time. In fact Tapia was just too skilful and too busy for Han. The way Tapia started the fight it looked like it could be over very early as he peppered Han with hard shots from both hands. Han did not wilt back but came back. Despite suffering a deep cut on his forehead in a heads clash in the fourth Han continued to score with some good hooks to the body shaking Tapia with a left hook in the fifth which had Tapia doubled-up in pain. Tapia registered a knockdown in the seventh when Han was hit with a hard right and fell back and half way through the ropes. With only the ropes holding him the referee applied a count. A right from Tapia in the eighth caused a bad cut over Han’s left eye and with Han’s face a mask of blood his corner pulled him out at the end of the round. “Jersey Boy” Tapia, 23, a US Junior Olympics gold medallist and World Cadet bronze medal winner, was facing his first real test and passed with flying colours as he registers his eleventh win by KO/TKO. He also wins the WBO NABO title. Han, 28, who lost in the US Olympic Trials for both the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, can come again.\n\nHart vs. Hunter Hart just punches too hard for Hunter. The hard-hitting son of the great Eugene “Cyclone” Hart put Hunter down in the first round and after two more knockdowns in the second the referee stopped the fight. The 6’2” ( ) Hart has 7 wins by KO/TKO. Hart, 25, was twice a silver medal winner in the US Championships and in 2011 won both the US and National Golden Gloves championships, he also represented the USA at the 2011 World Championships and won the US Olympic Trials but did not make it though to London. Now five losses by KO/TKO for Hunter.\n\nClary vs. Torres Clary takes 41 seconds longer than Hart to win his fight. The Liberian-born Clary put Torres down in the first and twice in the second round and the referee stopped it with two seconds left in the round. Clary, 21, the 2010 National Golden Gloves champion, makes it five wins by KO/TKO. Second los inside the distance for Mexican Torres.\n\nDe Leon vs. Ochoa Mexican-born, Detroit based De Leon, 21, had to settle for a points win over game Ochoa. Southpaw De Leon, a tree-time National Golden Gloves champion, worked with the late Manny Steward as an amateur and is now trained by Roberto Garcia. He lost to Kahn-Clary at the US Olympic Trials. Ventura, CA, USA Super Middle: Maxim Vlasov (26-1) W PTS 8 Mark Suarez (25-4). Light: Javier Garcia (10-2-2) W TKO 3 Dustin Caplinger (2-5). Vlasov vs. Suarez After both fighters made a slow start in the first round Vlasov was then in charge. He was busier and quicker than the rusty Suarez and was able to force Suarez to fight on the back foot. Even when both boxers seemed to tire over the last two rounds Vlasov was still outscoring Suarez and eased his way to a wide unanimous decision. Scores 80-72 twice and 79-73. The 26-year-old, 6’3” (190cm), Russian makes it twelve wins since loss to Isaac Chilemba in 2011. He is WBC 7 and WBO 11. Suarez, 34, was having his first fight since losing in five rounds against Kermit Cintron for the vacant IBF welter title in 2006 having been in prison for most of the time since then.\n\nGarcia vs. Caplinger After the set back of a cut in the first round Garcia gets third round win. Late substitute Caplinger was competitive for two rounds but then crumpled. A left to the body put Caplinger down in the third and after he got up the same punch put him down and the referee waived the count. The 24-year-old from Oxnard has 8 wins by KO/TKO and has 7 wins and a draw in his last eight fights. After five years away from the ring Caplinger has lost his last three fights. Reconquista, Argentina Feather: Dario Bustamante (10-1-2) W TEC DEC 5 Maximiliano Marquez (16-2-1). Light Welter: Oscar Pereyra (27-4) W KO 1 Cristian Diaz (6-8-1)\n\nBustamante vs. Marquez Bustamante wins this battle of styles and the WBA Fedebol title. Bustamante was coming forward swing wide arcing punches from the first and trying to overwhelm the smaller Marquez. The tactics worked well in the second as a long right sent Marquez tumbling backwards. He steadied himself by putting one hand on the floor so it counted as a knockdown. The third saw Marquez boxing beautifully. He was spearing Bustamante with jabs and getting through with good combinations before Bustamante could land his wild swings and he was warned for low blows. Bustamante picked the pace in the fourth and had Marquez boxing on the retreat. After yet another low blow Bustamante was give a final warning but it just seemed to spur him on. Marquez had the skill but not the punch and in the fifth whilst Marquez was on the ropes Bustamante caught him with some heavy shots. One of the swings which missed seemed to connect with his elbow on the left cheek of Marquez. Marquez immediately indicated it had been an elbow but was ordered to box on. Just a few seconds later with Marquez under pressure the referee had Marquez examined by the doctor who decided the cut and swelling on the left cheekbone of Marquez was dangerous and the fight was stopped. It went to the judges who scored it 48 ½-47 twice and 48-47 ½ all for Bustamante. A bounce back win for Bustamante, 24, after being floored four time and halted in seven rounds by Fabian Orozco in October. Marquez showed excellent skills but lacked the punching power for this one. These two had fought a draw in April last year.\n\nPereyra vs. Diaz All over in quick time as Pereyra flattens Diaz. The fight had hardly got started when a left from Pereyra sent Diaz tumbling to the canvas. Diaz was up quickly and looked to have recovered as the mandatory eight count was completed. He then tried to mix-it with Pereyra only to get trapped in the corner and a couple of body shots and a right flush on the jaw put him out cold. A badly needed win for 28-year-old “El Salvage” after two losses in a row. One win in his last seven fights for Diaz. Southport, Australia Super Middle: Rohan Murdock (11-1) W KO 10 Les Piper (14-12-3).Cruiser: Adam Lovelock (7-5) W PTS 10 Peter Brennan (10-23-4)\n\nMurdock vs. Piper Young local prospect Murdock makes it nine wins by KO/TKO and nine wins in a row. Currently the ABNF No 4 Murdock won every round before getting the kayo in the tenth against experienced Piper. The 21-year-old is a former gold medal winner at the Arafura Games and competed at both the World Cadet and World Youth championships. Piper, 29, has lost 6 of his last 7 fights. This is his fifth loss by KO/TKO. He was ANBF No 5.\n\nLovelock vs. Brennan Lovelock wins the WBC Asian Council Continental title as he floors Brennan on the way to a wide unanimous decision. Scores 100-89 twice and 100-90 for ANBF No 7. Brennan, 32, was making the first defence of his title. He has lost 7 of his last 8 fights. Dundalk, Ireland Middle: Eamonn O’Kane (10-1) W PTS 10 Anthony Fitzgerald (14-5). Light Welter: Philip Sutcliffe (3-0) W TKO 1 Radoslav Mitev (3-12-1). Welter: Paddy Murphy (8-0-2) DREW 8 Peter McDonagh (19-28-1). Heavy: Hughie Fury (7-0) W TKO 5 Ivica Perkovic (19-21).\n\nO’Kane vs. Fitzgerald O’Kane wins the vacant Irish title with hard-fought win over Fitzgerald. This was a close fight all the way. O’Kane seemed to be determined to box his way to victory, but in the heat of the battle he found himself trading heavy punches in every round. Fitzgerald was cut in the third and that seemed to inspire O’Kane as he built a lead. Fitzgerald rallied in the fourth, and the fifth was also a close round, but O’Kane took the sixth as he staggered Fitzgerald with a right. O’Kane suffered a set-back in the eight when he was deducted a point for a low punch but he finished the bout strongly to win the decision. Referee’s score 97-94. The 31-year-old O’Kane needs to progress quickly. He left it late to turn pro after winning a gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games where he beat Anthony Ogogo. He had beaten Fitzgerald on his way to winning the Prizefighter last year, but lost his unbeaten record when being halted in eight rounds by John Ryder in December. Fitzgerald, 28, a former undefeated Irish super middle champion, lost on points to Andy Lee in February.\n\nSutcliffe vs. Mitev Quick finish for Sutcliffe as he halts Bulgarian Mitev with just three seconds left in the first round. The 24-year-old Dubliner has won all three of his fights inside the distance. His father Philip Snr. twice won bronze medals at the European championships and young Philip almost matched him but his bronze was in the European Union Championships. He also boxing at the world championships. Mitev, 21, now has one draw and eight losses in his last nine fights.\n\nMurphy vs. McDonagh Records can be so deceptive. McDonagh’s record is very negative with more losses than wins, and him being 1-6 in his last seven fights. However, he has a wealth of experience and it showed in this fight as held the ten years younger unbeaten Murphy to a draw. Referee’s score 77-77. Newry-born Murphy, 25, was having his first fight in Ireland after turning pro in Australia and rising to No 5 in the ANBF ratings. McDonagh has been the distance with every young prospect in Britain, and a few on the Continent, but now and then can cause an upset such as he has against Michael Gomez, Lee Purdy, Frenchman Chris Sebire and Curtis Woodhouse.\n\nFury vs. Perkovic Fury continues his busy but undemanding schedule with a win as 39-year-old Croatian Perkovic retires at the end of the fifth round. Now 7 wins, 5 by KO/TKO for the 6’6” (198cm) 18-year-old brother of Tyson Fury. Perkovic is 2-7 in his last nine fights, but he is nearly always brought in to lose to good local opposition. Livorno, Italy Light Middle: Lenny Bottai (20-2) W TKO 4 Laszlo Haaz (8-13)\n\nFighting in his hometown Bottai took a couple of rounds to warm-up. He was on top and breaking the Hungarian down by the third. In the fourth an uppercut to the body had Haaz in agony and the referee stopped the fight. Bottai, 35, the EBU No 16, and a former Italian champion, has nine wins by KO/TKO and five wins since losing to Jean Michel Hamilcaro in 2011. Haaz, 38, has gone the six round distance with Anthony Fitzgerald and lost in two rounds to Souleymane M’baye this year. Kobe, Japan Bantam: Kohei Oba (34-2-1) W TKO 6 Satoshi Niwa (15-16-3). Bantam: Marjohn Yap (19-9) W PTS 8 Ryotaro Kawabata (8-2) Oba vs. Niwa Local favourite Oba, 28, retains his Japanese title with a stoppage of No 1 challenger Niwa. Oba softened-up Niwa with left hooks and right uppercuts and was well on top when the referee stopped the fight in the sixth round. Oba’s losses have both come in OPBF title fights against top class Filipinos in Malcolm Tunacao and Rolly Lunas. He has bounced back with five wins and is WBO 10/IBF 11/WBC 12. He has 12 wins by KO/TKO. Niwa had won his last five fights but was out of his depth here.\n\nYap vs. Kawabata Filipino Yap continued his Japanese campaign with a hard fought majority decision over local fighter Kawabata. It was a good fight with plenty of action. Scores 77-75, 77-76 and 76-76. The 24-year-old Yap is 2-1 in his three fights in Japan and is GAB No 10. Kawabata had won his last 5 fights. La Coruna, Spain Light Middle: Ivan Sanchez (22-2-1) W PTS 10 Aitor Nieto (9-2). Light Heavy: Adasat Rodriguez (9-2-1). Xesus Ferreiro (9-3-1) Sanchez vs. Nieto Great little fight sees hometown fighter Sanchez hold on to his national title. It was a rough fight with both fighters having points deducted for falling foul of the rules and with “Dinky” just getting the edge. Scores 98-93, 97-95 and 96-94. Sixth defence of the tile for the 37-year-old, 6’2” (188cm), Sanchez. When he started his career in 2004 he was 3-2-1 in his first six fights now he has 19 wins in a row. This was close enough to deserve a return but EBU No 12 Sanchez will probable go for a return with Javier Garcia Roche who in January had Sanchez down twice before the champion came back to retain his title on a stoppage.\n\nRodriguez vs. Ferreiro Fighting in the champion’s hometown Rodriguez gains revenge and the Spanish title as he takes a unanimous decision over champion Ferreiro. Scores 98-95, 98-96 and 96-95. Rodriguez, 26, had lost on points to 28-year-old Ferreiro for the vacant title in January and again this is a fight that deserves a return. Tampa, FLA, USA Feather: Aalan Martinez (15-2-1) W PTS 12 Charlie Serrano (15-4-1)\n\nThis was to have been for the interim WBO Latino title but Martinez must have gorged on tacos as he was 6lbs over the limit. Hometown fighter Serrano shook Martinez with a left in taking the first round. Mexican Martinez came back in the second and took the round after scoring with a strong southpaw right-left combination. There was too much clinching going on which made the fight a poor spectacle. The pattern was for Puerto Rican Serrano to rumble forward and the taller Martinez to counter punch effectively. The fight slowed as both fighters tired. A major influence in the scoring came in the sixth when Serrano was docked a point for low blows. Serrano was pressing continually and although Martinez built a small lead and although it was Serrano who was busier over the last three rounds Martinez was using his reach and skills to hold on to that lead. Scores 115-113 twice and 117-111. The 30-year-old Martinez showed good skills but bad discipline. Although he won the fight he came nowhere near making the weight, so the title remains vacant. His only losses have been to Evgeny Gradovich on points and a crushing four knockdown TKO loss to Orlando Cruz in March for this same title. Serrano, 25, had lost only one of his last eleven fights, and this was his first fight for ten months. Machiques, Venezuela Super Feather: Jaider Parra (21-1-1) W TKO 1 Jose Payares (11-10). Fly: Alexis Diaz (9-0) W KO 3 Farid Cassiani (16-20-4)\n\nParra vs. Payares A cut on the right eyebrow of Colombian Payares caused by a punch from Parra ended this one. First fight since losing in five rounds to Takashi Uchiyama for the WBA title in May for the 30-year-old brother of former WBA fly champ Lorenzo. Fifth inside the distance loss in his last six fights for Payares.\n\nDiaz vs. Cassiani Diaz lands a terrific right in the third which puts Colombian Cassiani down and out cold. It was more than two minutes before Cassiani was able to rise. The former national amateur champion has four wins by KO/TKO. Only one win in his last eight fights for experienced Cassiani. July 13 Dresden, Germany Super Middle: Robert Stieglitz (45-3) W TEC DEC 10 Yuzo Kiyota (23-4-1). Middle: Lukas Konecny (50-4) W PTS 12 Moez Fhima (22-3-1). Light Heavy: Robin Krasniqi (40-3) W PTS 8 Tomasz Adamek (20-9-1). Heavy: Mike Wallisch (10-0) W KO 1 Alex Kahl (18-10-1)\n\nStieglitz vs. Kiyota Stieglitz retains WBO title with win over Japanese challenger. After spending the first round studying Kiyota Stieglitz started scoring heavily with his jab and fast combinations finishing the third round with a flourish. In the fourth Stieglitz had warmed up and caught the Japanese fighter with hard punches which had Kiyota in real trouble with probably only the bell saving him from a stoppage. Kiyota turned nasty in the fifth hitting on the break and roughing-up the champion and the referee deducted a point for these infractions. By now Kiyota was bleeding from a cut by his right eye caused by a clash of heads and a left from Stieglitz in the seventh worsened the cut. Kiyota survived a doctor’s inspection in the ninth but with the cut bleeding heavily in the tenth another doctor’s inspection brought the fight to an end. It went to the scorecards and Stieglitz took the decision on scores of 99-90 twice and 100-89. First defence in his second reign as WBO champion for the 32-year-old German-based Russian. He and WBC champion Sakio Bika are just spectators in the big money fights in this division. OPBF champion Kiyota had done nothing of note since being stopped in one round by Jameson Bostic in 2010 but hey-this is the WBO.\n\nKonecny vs. Fhima Konecny shows he is still a force as he comprehensively outscores useful Fhima. After a lively first round Konecny floored Fhima heavily and but for the bell the Czech might have been able to finish the fight then. From that point on Konecny controlled the fight. Fhima showed good speed and a good chin and just enough of each to pick up a couple of rounds. Konecny was the stronger and forced the fight with Fhima often having to fight off the ropes. Once again Konecny had to endure a bad gash on his left eyebrow but he overcame that to retain his WBO European title. Scores 119-108, 119-109,117-111. Good win for the 34-year-old former interim WBO light middleweight champion. He has now won 14 of his last 15 fights with the loss being to Zaurbek Baysangurov for the WBO title in October. Rated No 7 middle by the WBO he is looking for a shot at Peter Quillin. He was badly cut in his win over Karim Achour in March so that has to be a concern. The 32-year-old Tunisian-born Fhima came to fight and gave a gutsy display. His only loss in his last 18 fights had been a split decision against Goekalp Oezekler in May last year.\n\nKrasniqi vs. Adamek Former WBO title challenger Krasniqi given a tough eight rounds by Czech Adamek. Krasniqi built and early lead, but Adamek finished strongly making it a close fight. Scores 78-75 twice and a slightly more representative 77-75. The 26-year-old Kosovan-born Krasniqi was having his first fight since losing a wide decision against Nat Cleverly for the WBO title in April. Adamek, 33, put up a good show here. He is 2-4 in his last 6 fights. Wallisch vs. Kahl All over in 47 seconds. The big 6’5” (196cm) German lands one punch to the over ample body of Kahl and his fellow-German goes don for the count. Wallisch wins the vacant BDB German title and makes it 7 wins by KO/TKO. Third one round loss in a row for 36-year-old Kahl. Monte Carlo, Monaco Super Middle: Edwin Rodriguez (24-0) W TKO 1 Denis Grachev (13-2-1). Middle: Max Bursak (27-1-1) W PTS 12 Prince Arron (23-5-1). Cruiser: Ilunga Makabu (14-1) W PTS 12 Dmytro Kucher (21-1). Light Welter: Khabib Allakhverdiev (19-0) W TKO 11 Souleymane M’baye (40-5-1)\n\nRodriguez vs. Grachev Impressive display of power from Rodriguez as he wins the Million Dollar Super 4 and the 1st prize of $600,000. The Dominican-born American came out firing bombs. He hurt Grachev with a body punch at the start of the round then floored him twice with head shots. Grachev was on the ropes and getting caught with more hard punches, some of which seemed to land on the back of Grachev’s head, when the referee stopped the fight after just 2:50 of the first round. “La Bomba” makes it 16 wins by KO/TKO and as the highest rated boxer by the IBF must now be in line for a shot at the title but as WBA 3/WBC 4/WBO 6 he has other avenues open. The fight was made at a catch-weight of 171 ½ lbs. Grachev a San Diego-based Russian rated No 6 light heavy by the WBC had beaten Ismayl Sillakh and Zsolt Erdei and given Lucien Bute twelve hard rounds so this first round blow out was a shock and he had to settle for the $400,000 losers purse.\n\nBursak vs. Arron The question here was whether the tall, slim Arron could combat the strength and hard punching of Bursak. The answer was no as Bursak retained his European title with a wide unanimous decision. Bursak was walking down Aaron from the start trying to keep him on the ropes so he could work inside. Arron was trying to get his own punches flowing, but was just not using his jab enough and Bursak got through with more hard punches in the third and fourth. When Arron did land he lacked the power to discourage the Ukrainian “Tiger”. A body punch put Arron down in the eighth and although he got up and fired back a left hook in the ninth put the former British light middle champion down again. Arron did much better over the last three rounds with Bursak losing a point for holding in the tenth and being lucky not to lose one for low blows in the eleventh. The result was a formality with Bursak winning on scores of 119-106, 116-109 and 117-108. First defence of his EBU title for 29-year-old Bursak who is WBA 5/WBO 5/WBC 12. Arron, 25, the EBU No 16, is still adjusting to middleweight and has the talent to make an impact.\n\nMakabu vs. Kucher DCR fighter Makabu sprang a surprise here as he took a razor thin majority verdict over unbeaten Ukrainian. The 25-year-old Makabu started slowly with Kucher building a slight lead but when Makabu began to fight inside he showed excellent defence and hand speed and gradually took the fight over. Makabu was the busier and more accurate and it was only over the closing rounds as Makabu tired that Kucher was able to close the gap. With the fight in the balance they fought a frantic last round with Makabu doing enough to earn the decision and the vacant WBC International title. Scores 115-113, 115-114 and 114-114. The 25-year-old South African-based Makabu did well to pace the fight as he well as he did. After losing in one round in his first pro fight he had won the next 13 fights inside the distance with only one of those going past six rounds. He showed here he box as well as punch. Kucher, 28, was WBC 3/IBF 8/WBO 13 so a huge win for Makabu and for his handlers who had the confidence to take this fight. The WBC International title had been vacated by Silvio Branco on receipt of the promise of a fight against the winner.\n\nAllakhverdiev vs. M’baye A contrast of styles prevented this one from catching fire. Allakhverdiev was looking to get inside and use hooks and uppercuts but M’baye kept sticking out his jab, not as a scoring punch but to upset Allakhverdiev’s rhythm. Those tactics almost came apart in the second when Allakhverdiev scored with a volley of hooks and M’baye's right leg slipped backwards and he went down on one knee. He was hurt and Allakhverdiev blazed away but by the end of the round M’baye was fighting back. That non-jab of M’baye which he threw time after time had Allakhverdiev waiting and waiting before letting his hands go and eventually M’baye got into the fight as he was able to get through with rights to the Russian southpaw. Allakhverdiev was the harder puncher and when he did let his hands go he was dangerous, but his workrate was not constant. He picked up the pace in the eighth and after getting home with a number of short hooks a right to the side of the head put M’baye down again. Once more M’baye got up and despite being caught with more hard shots was banging back with his right as the round ended. The ninth saw Allakhverdiev trying to increase the pressure and he got through with his short hooks with M’baye still scoring with rights but looking tired. The champion had built a lead with those volleys of hooks and it began to look as though M’baye need a knockout to win. The Frenchman just did not have the power for that. M’baye started the tenth well but Allakhverdiev began to get through with short chopping shots and M’baye was looking tired. The Frenchman started the eleventh with more lead rights but then a hook staggered him. Allakhverdiev poured on the pressure taking M’baye to the ropes and firing away until the referee stopped the fight. M’baye mildly protested, but there was only going to be one winner. The Russian “Hawk” retains his secondary WBA and his IBO titles and adds M’baye to his list of victims that already includes Nate Campbell, Joan Guzman and Kaizer Mabuza. He is a tough strong fighter who never uses a jab when he can use a hook, but he needs to tighten his defence. The 38-year-old M’baye, a former WBA light welter champion, put up a good fight but just lacked the power to change this fight. Pasay City, Philippines Straw: Merlito Sabillo (23-0) W TKO 9 Jorle Estrada (17-7). Super Fly: Arthur Villaneuva (23-0) W TKO 4 Arturo Badillo (21-5). Bantam: AJ Banal (29-2-1) W TKO 2 Abraham Gomez (18-8-1). Bantam: Albert Pagara (17-0) W TKO 2 Khunkhin (9-5-1)\n\nSabillo vs. Estrada Southpaw Sabillo was too much for his game but outclassed challenger. The WBO champion used a vicious body attack to slow his Colombian opponent. Estrada was looking to survive once he felt those body punches. With Estrada on the defensive, and using his longer reach to work on the outside, it took Sabillo a few rounds to settle his nerves but once he did and went to the body it was just a case of how long Estrada could last. In the ninth a left to the body put Estrada. He was in agony and spat out his mouthpiece and was unable to make it back to his feet. The 29-year-old “Tiger” a former bare knuckle street fighter from the ALA team has twelve wins by KO/TKO. He won the interim title by stopping Luis De la Rosa in March and was upgraded to full champion when Moises Fuentes could no longer make the weight. Estrada, 24, had done nothing of note since losing in seven rounds to Pedro Guerrero, but somehow found himself No 6 with the WBO.\n\nVillanueva vs. Badillo “King Arthur” makes it 23 wins as he halts dangerous Mexican in the fourth. After five points wins in a row Villaneuva needed to show his power again. Badillo came to fight and was willing to trade, but Villanueva used a strong jab to stamp his authority on the fight. Badillo’s cause was not helped when he was cut high on his head in a clash of heads in the second round. The doctor examined the cut briefly in the third but let the fight continue. In the fourth Villanueva had Badillo badly stunned by a right and then put the Mexican down with a series of hard punches but Badillo got up. Villanueva then drove Badillo to the ropes and was unloading with both hands when the referee stopped the fight. The 24-year-old OPBF champion adds the vacant WBO Asia Pacific title to his collection and makes it 13 wins by KO/TKO. He already holds wins over WBO title challenger Pramuansak and previously unbeaten Marco Demecillo. He is rated IBF 6/WBA 10/WBO 10. Badillo, 26, won his first 17 fights, 15 by KO/TKO, but it has been tougher for him since he moved up in class with Ronald Barrera (twice) and Hugo Cazares beating him inside the distance.\n\nBanal vs. Gomez Banal wins a messy fight as Gomez retires at the end of the second. What fighting there was was coming from Banal. Gomez was more intent on wrestling and throwing Banal to the canvas. Those tactics cost him two point deductions. Banal was getting through with hard southpaw lefts and both boys were sporting cuts from head clashes. At the end of the second round Gomez decided he did not want to fight/wrestle any more and retired. Banal is trying yet again to rebuild from another setback. After losing to Rafael Concepcion for the interim WBA super fly title in 2008 “Bazooka” won eleven fights in a row. However, in October he was halted in nine rounds by Pungluang for the vacant WBO bantam title. Still only 25, it is a case of climbing the ladder again and trying to avoid the snakes. Three losses by KO/TKO in a row for Gomez but the other losses were to Roberto Ortiz(24-0-1) and Miguel Mendoza (20-2-1).\n\nPagara vs. Khunkhin A traditional left jab/right cross ended this one as “Prince Albert” halted Thai Khunkhin in two rounds. The 19-year-old, he turned pro at 16, now has twelve wins by KO/TKO. Khunkhin, 32, had lost only one of his last seven fights. Cecina, Italy Super Feather: Floriano Pagliara (15-5-2) W PTS 10 Nicola Cipolletta (9-4-1)\n\nPagliara wins close unanimous decision to give Cecina its first Italian champion. The local fighter used his jab to pile up points and blunt the early attacks of Cipolletta. The visitor came into the fight more from the fourth as he managed to work inside and built a slight lead. Pagliara, 34, came back strongly over the last two rounds applying constant pressure to Cipolletta. Scores 96-94 twice and 97-94 giving Pagliara the vacant title. The New York-based fighter had lost inside the distance to Andrea Scarpa for the same title in January but took his chance when the title then became vacant. Only one win in his last six fights for 24-yerar-old Cipolletta. Tijuana, Mexico Feather: Oscar Gonzalez (22-2) W PTS 10 Adrian Young (18-1-1) . Welter: Jose Zepeda (15-0) W TKO 3 Ricardo Dominguez (37-10-2). Fly: Francisco Rodriguez (11-1) W TKO 5 Victor Ruiz (11-2)\n\nGonzales vs. Young Gonzales takes wide unanimous decision over previously unbeaten Young. “The Ghost” took the initiative from the start using his better skills and aggression to dominate and set the pace for the fight. Not a big puncher Gonzales was the busier and more accurate and it was the seventh before Young really managed to get his own attacks flowing. Now Gonzales was counter punching and hurt Young with a right at the end of the seventh. The eighth saw plenty of action with Young scoring well with left hooks on the inside and Gonzales with counter punches. Young pressured Gonzales over the last two rounds but again it was Gonzales the more accurate puncher and still in charge of the fight. Scores 97-93 twice and 100-90. The 33-year-old did not turn pro until he was 26,late for a Mexican. After losing in his second fight he was undefeated in his next 19 until losing a close decision to Raul Hirales in December. He has wins over Roberto Vasquez, Caril Herrera (31-1), Giovanni Caro and Rico Ramos. The 20-year-old “Chinito” had beaten Hirales and Silvester Lopez in his previous two fights.\n\nZepeda vs. Dominguez Huge win for Californian born “Chon”. He got a great start, flooring the more experienced Dominguez with a left in the first round. Zepeda looked classy as he showed plenty of fast movement and also confused Dominguez by switching guards effortlessly. A punch opened a bad gash on the right cheekbone of Dominguez . In the third with hard shots from Zepeda piercing the guard of Dominguez and the cut worsening the referee asked the doctor to examine Dominguez and the doctor said the cut was too bad for Dominguez to continue. It was an unfortunate way for the fight to end, but Zepeda was so dominant that he would probably forced the stoppage even if Dominguez had not been cut. Impressive display from Zepeda in his 15th fight as he gets win No 13 by KO/TKO. Dominguez, 27, had lost on points to both Humberto Soto for the WBC lightweight title and Miguel Vazquez for the IBF title, and took Brandon Rios to a split decision.\n\nRodriguez vs. Ruiz These two had almost identical records going in, but that’s where the similarity ended. Southpaw Rodriguez was slipping the shots from local fighter Ruiz and getting through with fast, accurate combinations. Ruiz was ready to be taken in the fifth and Rodriguez scored two knockdowns. Both were heavy knockdowns and although Ruiz managed to get up from both after completing the standing eight count on the second knockdown the referee stopped the fight. Five wins in a row and nine by KO/TKO for the NABF champion. His title was not on the line here. Fellow southpaw Ruiz had won his last eight fights. Leon, Mexico Light Fly: Ramon Garcia (18-4-1) W KO 8 Juan Hernandez (22-3). Super Feather: Nery Saguilan (25-3-1) W PTS 10 Pedro Navarette (28-18-3) Garcia vs. Hernandez Important fight for both boxers sees former WBO light fly champ Garcia kayo former WBA strawweight challenger in eighth. Both fighters were cautious over the first two rounds but things livened up in the third when Garcia landed a southpaw left to the chin which put Hernandez down. Hernandez fought back in the fourth and got some encouragement in the fifth when a clash of heads left Garcia with a bad cut on his forehead. The cut spurred Garcia to even greater efforts. In the eighth a left to the jaw followed by another to the body put Hernandez down in agony and he failed to beat the count. The 30-year-old, WBC No 7 makes it 11 wins by KO/TKO and gets his second win since an unsuccessful challenge against Roman Gonzalez for the WBA title in April. Hernandez, 26, lost to Kazuto Ioka for the WBC strawweight title in 2011. He had won his last 5 fights and was WBC No 5 at strawweight. This was publicised as a WBC strawweight eliminator.\n\nSaguilan vs. Navarette Saguilan made good use of his advantages in height and reach to outbox the experienced Navarette. There was plenty of action, but Saguilan was always in charge. He put on a classy exhibition of skill and won a wide unanimous decision. Saguilan, 25, suffered back-to-back losses to Alberto Garza and Alejandro Sanabria in 2012 but had bounced back with a win over Lupe Rosales in March. “Vaquero” Navarette is 2-8 in his last ten fights but most of them have been on the road and he has only been beaten twice inside the distance. Inglewood, CA, USA Super Feather: Takahiro Ao (24-3-1) W KO 2 Hardy Paredes (16-12). Super Feather: Alejandro Perez (18-3-1) W KO 7 Edgar Riovalle (35-15-2). Cruiser: Yunier Dorticos (15-0) W KO 2 Keith Barr (10-3). Light Heavy: Trevor McCumbby (12-0) W TKO 1 Rey Rodriguez (6-7-1). Super Feather: Saul Rodriguez (10-0-1) W TKO 3 Dominic Coca (8-4) Ao vs. Paredes Former WBC feather and super feather champ Ao crushes Paredes in two rounds. After a slow first round the former champion put Paredes down with a right. Paredes made it to his feet only for a left to put him down and out. The 29-year-old southpaw made an impressive start to his USA campaign and is aiming for another shot at the super feather title he lost to Glamiel Diaz in October. Chilean Paredes is now 5-5 in his last ten fights.\n\nPerez vs. Riovalle This was a tough fight for Perez until he found a body shot to end the contest in the seventh. Mexican Riovalle is a better fighter than his record shows and he hardly took a backward step and made Perez fight hard in every round. Perez had to cope with the handicap of a cut over his right eye after a clash of heads in the fourth. Perez had built a lead when he caught Riovalle with that body punch in the seventh that had Riovalle down and squirming in agony as the referee completed the count. The 27-year-old from Salinas has twelve wins by KO/TKO. He is 4-2 in his last six fights with the other wins being over Antonio Escalante, Derrick Wilson and previously unbeaten Art Hovhannisyan. The two losses were on points against Rico Ramos and Diego Magdaleno. “Garbage Man “ Riovalle, 26, fought a draw with world rated Fermin de los Santos in January and was the first guy to beat Nery Saguilan.\n\nDorticos vs. Barr Dorticos continues his comeback with easy win over Barr. The 27-year-old former top amateur was inactive from November 2011 through to February this year and was too much for Barr. Dorticos put Barr down in the first and twice more in the second before the referee stopped the fight. He still has a 100% wins by KO/TKO record and only two of his victims have lasted beyond the third round. Southpaw Barr is 2-4 in his last 6 fights. McCumby vs. Rodriguez McCumby made this quick as he shattered Rodriguez in just 29 seconds. Ten wins by KO/TKO for McCumby, seven coming in the first round. The 20-year-old was runner-up at the US Youth Championships in 2009 and took the gold medal in 2010. Five losses in a row for Puerto Rican Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez vs. Coca Rodriguez continues to show promise, From the second round he was catching Coca with jabs and hard rights and softening his victim up. A left hook shook Coca badly in the third and he was in deep trouble as Rodriguez unloaded. He lasted to the end of the round and then retired. Rodriguez, 20, who trains with Mikey Garcia, has seven wins by KO/TKO and the draw on his record was of the technical variety. Madrid, Spain Light Middle: Rafael Chiruta (6-29) W TKO 2 Ruben Varon (41-7)\n\nThe travelling Romanian loser halted an off-colour Veron in the second with the Spaniard way below par. Right from the start Chiruta was barreling forward throwing wild swinging punches. His furious attack had Veron unsettled and catching heavy shots. Varon hardly had time to throw a punch and at the end of the round a series of punches finished off by a clubbing right to the side of the head put Varon down. He got up and they were exchanging punches at the end with Chiruta getting through with the heavier shots. Varon came out in the second trying to take control and put the Romanian on the back foot. Instead Chiruta shook Varon badly and chased him along the ropes getting through with some hard punches until another clubbing right put Varon down. He got up quickly but whilst taking the eight count his lags were wobbling badly. He tried to trade with Chiruta but again was being caught with hard clubbing shots and the referee stopped the fight. A huge upset as Varon had won 10 of his last 11 fights with the loss being in a European middleweight title fight against Matthew Macklin in 2010. Chiruta, 33, was 2 -22 in his last 24 fights!! but this was a genuine stoppage of one of the top light middleweights in Europe. What made the loss worse for Varon is that his promoter had won the purse bidding for Varon’s challenge to WBC No 1 Sergey Rabchenko for the European title with October being the projected date for the fight. Viceroys, Argentina Cruiser: Angel Ruben Mino (16-0) W TKO 2 Ruben Molina (2-3)\n\n“The Stone Man “retains a version of the South American title (yes there is more than one) with stoppage of novice Molina. The FAB don’t even bother to rate the 38-year-old Mino despite all of his wins coming by KO/TKO, and him having to go past the third round only once. Could have something to do with abysmal quality of his opposition. Callao, Peru Light Middle: David Zegarra (25-0) W PTS 10 Eduardo Flores (16-11-3). Light Welter: Juan Zegarra (13-0,1ND) W PTS 8 Victor Coronado (4-5). Fly: Ricardo Astuvilca (9-0) W TKO 2 Ricardo Guerrero (0-1)\n\nZegarra vs. Flores Local hero Zegarra retained his WBA Fedelatin title for the second time winning almost every round against late substitute Flores. Zegarra had the Ecuadorian staggered on numerous occasions but just could close the fight out. No surprise as Flores has a very good chin. Zegarra wins wide unanimous decision. He had won a points victory over Flores in June last year for the vacant South American title. He is WBC 8/WBA 9 but we won’t know how good he is until he fights outside Peru. Flores has lost 3 of his last 4 fights.\n\nZegarra vs. Coronado Good night for the Zegarra clan as southpaw Juan comfortably outpointed Colombian Coronado. Zegarra seems to have lost his punch with 5 of his last 6 fights seeing him going the distance to win. The decision was unanimous. Zegarra competed for Peru at the 2007 World Championships. Four losses in a row for Coronado."
