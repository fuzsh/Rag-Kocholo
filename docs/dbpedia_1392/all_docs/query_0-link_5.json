        "text": "Minimumweight (also referred to as strawweight or mini flyweight) is a weight class division in combat sports. The most notable of which is in professional boxing where boxers may weigh no more than 105 pounds (47.6271988500000000000000000000 kg). This is a relatively new weight category for professionals, first inaugurated by the major boxing sanctioning bodies between 1987 and 1990.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe minimumweight division was originally introduced in 1968 for the Summer Olympic Games under the name light flyweight. However the division was not recognized by any the four most widely-regarded sanctioning bodies until the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in June 1987 when Kyung-Yun Lee knocked out Masaharu Kawakami to become the inaugural champion.\n\nThe division was then later recognized by the World Boxing Council (WBC) in October 1987, the World Boxing Association (WBA) in January 1988, and the World Boxing Organization (WBO) in August 1989. While Ring magazine did not begin ranking minimumweights until 1997 under the name strawweights and has yet to name a champion in their rankings.\n\nHistorically the weight class has been dominated by Latin Americans (including, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Argentines, Panamanians, Venezuelans, and Dominicans) and Asians (including, Japanese, Chinese, Thais, Filipinos, Koreans, and Indonesians) with only a limited amount of success coming from other nationalities including, South Africans, Americans, Canadians, English, and Australians.\n\nLate 1980s (1987-1989)\n\nIn the early years of the division, fighters such as Napa Kiatwanchai found success defending the WBC belt. Including early wins over a young up-and-coming Hiroki Ioka who later found success at light flyweight, flyweight, and super flyweight.\n\nOther notable champions of this period included, Nico Thomas, Jum-Hwan Choi, Bong-Jun Kim, Rafael Torres, Samuth Sithnaruepol, and Leo Gamez.\n\n1990s\n\nMost of the 1990s were dominated by Ricardo López who is often cited as the best minimumweight ever. López holds a number of records in the division, including the most title defenses with 21. As well as being the first and (so far) only minimumweight to hold two different major titles simultaneously (WBC and WBO).\n\nHowever other successful fighters of this period included,\n\nRatanapol Sor Vorapin, who found success defending his IBF title for most of the decade.\n\nChana Porpaoin, who found success in the early part of the decade defending the WBA title. Until losing the title to Rosendo Álvarez, who controlled the WBA title for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe division also saw its first champions not from Latin America or Asia. When Scotland's Paul Weir won the vacant WBO title over Fernando Martinez in May 1993. This was then followed by South Africa's Zolani Petelo who won the IBF title in December 1997.\n\nOther notable fighters of this period included, Hi-Yong Choi, Hideyuki Ohashi, Alex Sánchez, Wandee Chor Chareon, Rocky Lin, Ala Villamor, Kermin Guardia, Noel Arambulet, Songkram Porpaoin, and Osvaldo Guerrero. [1]\n\n2000s\n\n2000-2003\n\nIn the early part of the decade, José Antonio Aguirre and Iván Calderón were the most decorated champions.\n\nOther top ranked fighters included, Keitaro Hoshino, Roberto Carlos Leyva, Miguel Barrera, and Joma Gamboa.\n\nWhile fighters such as, Noel Arambulet, Kermin Guardia, Chana Porpaoin, Wandee Chor Chareon, and Songkram Porpaoin continued to find success during this time.\n\n2004-2006\n\nMoving to the middle part of the decade, Muhammad Rachman, Yutaka Niida, and Eagle Kyowa became the best champions. While José Antonio Aguirre began to decline by having long losing streaks and Iván Calderón continued to defend his WBO title until August 2007 when he moved up to light flyweight.\n\nOther top rank fighters included, Daniel Reyes, Juan Jose Landaeta, Rodel Mayol, Omar Soto, Katsunari Takayama, and Isaac Bustos.\n\n2007-2009\n\nIn the later part of the decade, Oleydong Sithsamerchai, Donnie Nietes, Raúl García, and Román González were the elite champions. With many of the best fighters from the middle years of the decade having continued success.\n\nHowever new talent that emerged during the end of the decade included, Florante Condes, Nkosinathi Joyi, and Juan Palacios.\n\n2010s\n\nSo far in the early part of the decade many of the fighters from the end of the 2000s have continued to find success.\n\nHowever some new faces have included Denver Cuello and Kazuto Ioka (nephew of 1980s champion Hiroki Ioka).\n\nAmateur boxing[]\n\nSince 1968, the Summer Olympic Games has featured the 48 kilogram division under the name light flyweight (not to be confused with the 108 pound division in professional boxing).\n\nOlympic Champions[]\n\n1968 – File:Flag of Venezuela 1930-2006.svg Francisco Rodríguez (VEN)\n\n1972 – File:Flag of Hungary.svg György Gedó (HUN)\n\n1976 – File:Flag of Cuba.svg Jorge Hernández (CUB)\n\n1980 – File:Flag of the Soviet Union 1955.svg Shamil Sabirov (URS)\n\n1984 – Paul Gonzales (USA)\n\n1988 – File:Flag of Bulgaria (1971-1990).svg Ivailo Marinov (BUL)\n\n1992 – File:Flag of Cuba.svg Rogelio Marcelo (CUB)\n\n1996 – File:Flag of Bulgaria.svg Daniel Petrov (BUL)\n\n2000 – File:Flag of France.svg Brahim Asloum (FRA)\n\n2004 – File:Flag of Cuba.svg Yan Bartelemí Varela (CUB)\n\n2008 – File:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg Zou Shiming (CHN)\n\n2012 – File:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg Zou Shiming (CHN)\n\nEuropean Champions[]\n\n1969 – File:Flag of Hungary.svg György Gedó (HUN)\n\n1971 – File:Flag of Hungary.svg György Gedó (HUN)\n\n1973 – File:Flag of the Soviet Union.svg Vladislav Sasypko (URS)\n\n1975 – File:Flag of the Soviet Union.svg Aleksandr Tkachenko (URS)\n\n1977 – File:Flag of Poland.svg Henryk Średnicki (POL)\n\n1979 – File:Flag of the Soviet Union.svg Shamil Sabirov (URS)\n\n1981 – File:Flag of Bulgaria.svg Ismail Mustafov (BUL)\n\n1983 – File:Flag of Bulgaria.svg Ismail Mustafov (BUL)\n\n1985 – File:Flag of East Germany.svg René Breitbarth (GDR)\n\n1987 – File:Flag of the Soviet Union.svg Nszan Munczian (URS)\n\n1989 – File:Flag of Bulgaria.svg Ivailo Marinov (BUL)\n\n1991 – File:Flag of Bulgaria.svg Ivailo Marinov (BUL)\n\n1993 – File:Flag of Bulgaria.svg Daniel Petrov (BUL)\n\n1996 – File:Flag of Bulgaria.svg Daniel Petrov (BUL)\n\n1998 – Sergey Kazakov (RUS)\n\n2000 – Valeriy Sydorenko (UKR)\n\n2002 – Sergey Kazakov (RUS)\n\n2004 – Sergey Kazakov (RUS)\n\n2006 – David Ayrapetyan (RUS)\n\nPan American Champions[]\n\n1971 – File:Flag of Cuba.svg Rafael Carbonell (CUB)\n\n1975 – File:Flag of Cuba.svg Jorge Hernández (CUB)\n\n1979 – File:Flag of Cuba.svg Hector Ramírez (CUB)\n\n1983 – File:Flag of Puerto Rico.svg Rafael Ramos (PUR)\n\n1987 – File:Flag of Puerto Rico.svg Luis Román Rolón (PUR)\n\n1991 – File:Flag of Cuba.svg Rogelio Marcelo (CUB)\n\n1995 – File:Flag of Venezuela.svg Edgar Velázquez (VEN)\n\n1999 – File:Flag of Cuba.svg Maikro Romero (CUB)\n\n2003 – File:Flag of Cuba.svg Yan Bartelemí Varela (CUB)\n\nNotable minimumweights[]\n\nMen:\n\nIvan Calderon\n\nRicardo López\n\nRosendo Álvarez\n\nEagle Kyowa\n\nChana Porpaoin\n\nRatanapol Sor Vorapin\n\nYutaka Niida\n\nWomen:\n\nWendy Rodriguez\n\nJolene Blackshear\n\nSarah Goodson\n\nCurrent professional boxing champions[]\n\nSanctioning Body Reign Began Champion Record Defenses WBA December 31, 2012 File:Flag of Japan.svg Ryo Miyazaki 18-0-3 (10 KO) 0 WBC November 24, 2012 File:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg Xiong Zhao Zhong 20-4-1 (11 KO) 0 IBF March 30, 2013 File:Flag of Japan.svg Katsunari Takayama 25-6-0-1 (10 KO) 0 WBO August 27, 2011 Moisés Fuentes 16-1 (8 KO) 2\n\nFor a full list, see List of minimumweight boxing champions\n\nOther Sports[]\n\nOther sports to include a minimumweight division include the following,\n\nMuay Thai, both Lumpinee Boxing Stadium and Rajadamnern Stadium feature a 105 pound weight categories recognized as mini flyweight.\n\nJudo, features a 105 pound weight category for female competitions.\n\nVarious styles of wrestling feature a 105 pound weight category.
