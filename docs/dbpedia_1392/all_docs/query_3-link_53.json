        "text": "By Ryan Maquiñana\n\nBirthday No. 25 came and passed yesterday for unbeaten NABO junior lightweight beltholder Eloy “Prince” Perez, and aside from the usual gift-wrapped boxes and candle-laden cake, there was plenty to celebrate on the boxing front.\n\nAfter only five of his first 23 pro bouts ended via stoppage, Perez (22-0-2, 6 KOs) scored a surprising second-round demolition of Daniel Jimenez eight weeks ago on TeleFutura in front of his hometown fans of Salinas, Calif.\n\nThe win garnered Perez some newfound attention by none other than his promoter Golden Boy, who then commenced arrangements to pit him against their other 130-pound prospect-turned-contender, Adrien Broner, for the newly vacated WBO crown.\n\nAmid negotiations eventually falling through with some bad blood between the two beginning to boil, Perez has finally begun to turn a few heads in the boxing world, having been awarded NABO Fighter of the Year among other honors.\n\nBoxingScene caught up with the rising contender, who along with assistant trainer Sam Garcia commented on negotiations with Broner, his recent power surge, and his upcoming TeleFutura “Solo Boxeo Tecate” headliner this Friday against Ira Terry (24-6, 14 KOs) in Salinas.\n\nPEREZ ON HIS 25TH BIRTHDAY AND HIS RECENT ACCOLADES:\n\n“It’s like I’m all over the place now. I just won NABO Fighter of the Year. I just saw myself in the Ring rankings. It’s crazy. To be honest, I just woke up, and I didn’t even know it was my birthday. I’ve been so focused on camp.”\n\nPEREZ ON HIS MINDSET DURING THE JIMENEZ KNOCKOUT:\n\n“I was just happy to get through it. Training camp was hard. It wasn’t really about the fight as much as what I had to do to get there. My trainers ran me hard. It showed in the fight. I couldn’t even sleep after the fight. I pulled an all-nighter because I still had all this energy. It didn’t even sink in until I got home.”\n\nPEREZ ON WHETHER HE CAN SUSTAIN THIS POWER SURGE INTO FRIDAY:\n\n“I think this time, I finally got a fighter who came to fight, and I showed what I could do when I’m given an opportunity to take advantage of it. I’m 25 years old and I’m still figuring everything out. I’m getting stronger every day and becoming more confident in my power working with the Garcias and Dean Familton.”\n\nSAM GARCIA ON PEREZ’S PERCEIVED LACK OF POWER:\n\n“If you look at the previous fights, not too many people saw the Dannie Williams fight, and Dannie Williams was face-first on the canvas in the first round. If you go back further, he stopped Juan Santiago.\n\n“If you give Eloy a guy who comes to fight, Eloy will be able to show off his work better against somebody’s who’s willing to fight, willing to engage, and willing to put it on the line. Daniel Jimenez came in to win, and not to pull a [Omar] Narvaez against [Nonito] Donaire or an Alejandro Rodriguez, who came to survive. And when you have a situation like that, Eloy can use his speed and his power to hurt somebody, not just counterpunch.”\n\nPEREZ ON MATCHING UP WITH TERRY:\n\n“I’ve seen a couple of his fights on YouTube. That’s my trainer’s job to come up with the gameplan, and mine is to be prepared. I’ve seen some of fights of his, and I’m seeing how I can break him down. I’m going to do what I usually do, and that’s counterpunch and be accurate. I know he starts a little quick, and that’s it. I’m just focused on what my team has planned.”\n\nPEREZ ON TERRY HAVING BEEN KNOCKED OUT FOUR CONSECUTIVE TIMES LEADING UP TO THIS FIGHT:\n\n“I really don’t care what he’s done in the past. We’ll find out what he has in the ring and how hard he’s been able to prepare over the past few weeks. If I see an opening, I’ll take it, and if not, I’ll keep looking to get my timing down.”\n\nPEREZ ON STAGING HIS SECOND STRAIGHT FIGHT IN SALINAS:\n\n“I think it’s awesome. It’s always a positive thing for the city being able to have everyone be a part of it, and see what Garcia Boxing is all about. I just want to represent Salinas as best I can. We’ve had fighters like Chuy Rodriguez and Jose Celaya work with the Garcias, and now I just want to finish what they started.”\n\nPEREZ ON FIGHTING ADRIEN BRONER:\n\n“As far as Adrien Broner, I’m going to beat his ass when the time comes. Today, tomorrow, next month, next year, whenever it’s time for us to meet in the ring. When it comes to negotiations, Kathy Garcia my manager, my team, and Golden Boy Promotions—Oscar De La Hoya said they have bigger things for me—so that’s their job. My job as a fighter is just to be ready. I trust my promotional company and my team and my manager.\n\n“And besides, why fight him now when it can be a bigger fight in the future when we both have titles? It can be bigger than what it could have been. We both have bigger fights ahead. So to answer your question, I would love to fight Adrien Broner, but he also has to come fight me somewhere fair. I’m not going to Cincinnati, and I know he doesn’t want to go to Salinas.”\n\nGARCIA ON PEREZ’S ROAD AHEAD:\n\n“I think we’re going to after the IBF. It depends on what they say. We love the WBO, and we’ve chased that prestigious title for a long time, but the way it’s working now, it’s going to be hard to work that out with Golden Boy having Adrien Broner in their stable and handing him the title. It makes sense for us to go after the IBF title and Juan Carlos Salgado who makes great action fights. I think that’s a fight that both of them could look good in, and I think Eloy would come in on top.\n\n“Salgado’s got confidence in his power against boxer-types like Eloy. I mean, he stopped Jorge Linares, so that looks like the most aesthetically pleasing fight. The thing is, before we can get there, we need to get ranked higher than the top 25 in there.\n\n“So we’re trying to get someone in the top 15 like Jason Litzau, Monty Meza-Clay, or Martin Honorio. There’s been talk about Vicente Escobedo, but we’re talking with the promoters to see if he even wants that fight. If we beat any of those guys, we’ll get a shot at Salgado down the line, then a unification megafight hopefully between Eloy and Broner in the summer or even the fall.”\n\nPEREZ ON HIS TWO DEDICATIONS FOR FRIDAY’S FIGHT, ONE FOR BREAST CANCER AWARENESS AND ANOTHER FOR LIVER CANCER PATIENT SY SHERMAN:\n\n“We have two dedications. First, we’re fighting for all the people who have dealt with breast cancer. Olaya Hernandez, who’s the sister of my trainer Max Garcia, and Malena Garcia, a family friend of ours, fought breast cancer and survived, so we will be fighting for them and all women who have dealt with it one way or another.\n\n“About Sy, I read his story at lunch, and he’s a really tough kid who’s been through a lot. He’s nine years old, and he’s already going through chemo[therapy] every few weeks. For me, he’s a fighter, battling liver cancer, and having the courage to fight it.

As always, colorful American promoter Gary Shaw stole the show with his frequent jokes, often at the expense of a fellow promoter , who had the misfortune of attending the event wearing a pink shirt and matching pink shoes.\n\n“First of all, anyone wearing pink and pink sneakers should not be allowed at this microphone,” Shaw said jokingly, “he should only be allowed to argue for women’s fights.”\n\nThe first motion kicked off with Japanese promoter Ulysses G. Sato, who made a motion to see Japanese mini-flyweight Katsunari Takayama move into the top ten (he is currently ranked #12).\n\nFrom there, Philippine promoter Mike Aldeguer of ALA Boxing told the board that his junior flyweight champion, Ramon Garcia, was tentatively looking to fight contender Tommy Seran on March 17 of 2012. A representative of Carlos Rueben Dario Ruiz, the #8 ranked contender and Latino champion, made no demands, but did make sure that the board was familiar with his accomplishments and desire to fight for a world title if the opportunity arose. It was a statement that brought a lighthearted response from President Valcarcel.\n\n“If you talk to the Filipinos, they would love to fight you!” joked Valcarcel, “They love to fight the Argentines!”\n\nAnother argument from the floor to see Spanish veteran Rafael Lozano into the WBO rankings brought more lighthearted jabs from the President. Although Lozano possesses a 25-3 record, and won both a Bronze medal in the Olympics and the Spanish Junior Flyweight title in his last fight, many couldn’t help but notice his advanced age (he is 41-years old). When reminded of the Bronze medal, Valcarcel quipped “When?! In 1974?!”\n\nFrom there the discussions moved to the Flyweight discussion where President Valcarcel noted that champion Brian Viloria would fight #1 contender Giovani Segura of Mexico in his next fight. A discussion of the 115-pound division talk about popular champion Omar Narvaez of Argentina, and an argument from Gary Shaw to move Cesar Seda Jr., the #2 ranked contender from Puerto Rico, into a title fight. Offering a box-off with #1 contender Isack Junior, Shaw was determined to see his young contender fighting for the world title before the next convention. Another argument from the Argentine delegation was entertained for #6 ranked contender Roberto Sosa, the unbeaten prospect from Argentina with a 21-0 record to move into the top five.\n\nAt Bantamweight the discussion was all around whether or not champion Nonito Donaire was going to move up in weight or not. Philippine promoter Mike Aldeguer argued for his fighter, Alex John Banal to fight in a title fight for a vacant title if that did occur (Banal is currently the #2 contender) while Gary Shaw argued for Vic Darchinyan.\n\nAt Junior Featherweight President Valcarcel announced that champion Jorge Arce had nine months to make his mandatory title defense. Top Rank’s Carl Moretti announced that it appeared that he would be fighting in Mexico in January against a ranked fighter for his first title defense. Gary Shaw argued along side Alex Camponovo for the winner of the Showtime fight between Chris Avalos (#4) and Jonathan Romero (#14) to move into the #1 slot. The fight is slated for December 2 on Showtime. Presedent Valcarcel was open to the idea, but wouldn’t commit to the jump just yet.\n\n“We don’t’ have to decide now,” commented Vaslcarcel, “We need the committee to decide if the fighter moves to #1.”\n\nAt Featherweight there was a buzz over the fact that previous #1 contender Chonlatarn Piriyapinyo of Thailand won another organizations championship, thus opening up the top ten more movement. An argument was made for undefeated Aussie Joel Brunker to move into the top ten, before it was recognized that he had in fact moved into the #5 slot. Alex Camponovo wanted Abraham Lopez (16-0) to enter the rankings, as well as Colombian bomber Daluis Prescott (23-0), the brother of Breidis.\n\nDespite Prescott’s impressive record, President Valcarcel did raise some concerns with the level of opposition. In Prescott’s last fight, he stopped Elkin Zavaleta, who had a less than stellar record of (3-22) and Valcarcel pointed out that he fought Victor Peralta twice (Peralta has a 1-28-2 record).\n\nFrom there, many familiar names were offered to the board in an attempt to move up the rankings, including Ray Bautista from the Philippines.\n\nGary Shaw then introduced a young, undefeated prospect named Jose Pedraza (4-0), a Puerto Rican who Shaw promised would become very familiar to the world of boxing in the coming years. President Valcarcel suggested a fight with Pedraza for a Youth title, a suggestion that Pedraza warmly embraced.\n\n“That’s what I want to do,” commented the young Puerto Rican fighter, “I would be very happy to hold that belt.”\n\nAlthough the highest weight classes saw many familiar names discussed as they argued to move up, and in some instances remain in, the world rankings, there was little question that there would also be many newcomers entering the rankings. Although Gary Shaw had words with Argentine promoter Mario Margossian, the most interesting Shaw moment when he made a short, simple request for Chad Dawson to move up to the #1 spot at 175.\n\n“The world saw what happened with Hopkins,” Shaw said, “Chad Dawson should be #1.”\n\nAt heavyweight the most noteworthy moment came when Chauncy Welliver, and his manager Roland Jankleson, stood before the podium and petitioned for a higher ranking. Welliver, the #10 ranked heavyweight, recently won the WBO China Zone championship, and with his growing popularity in China, pushed to see his ranking move up. Although Championship Committee Chairman Luis Batista Salas had a vigorous cross examination of Welliver and Jankleson, in which questions were raised about Welliver’s attempt to defend his WBO Asia-Pacific belt against Marcellus Brown (a fight that was not approved by the WBO), Welliver and Jankleson did seem to make the most of their opportunity to present their case to the board, citing the fact that Welliver is the most active fighter in the top ten, with over 50 wins and five fights in 2011 so far.\n\nA strong argument from Markus Aslani followed, in which the German pushed to see Lebanese born prospect Manual Charr enter the top ten as well. Charr scored an impressive knockout over former contender Owen Beck in 2010 and former contender Danny Williams earlier this year. Also, Hedi Taouab pushed for undefeated Italian Francesco Pianeta and former world champion Ruslan Chagaev to enter the WBO rankings.\n\nAfter the ranking the WBO proudly introduced their new webpage at www.wbo-int.com and announced that it would be unveiled to the world during the evening’s gala dinner. Finally, the grievance committee proposed a slight modification to Rule 13 (a)(2)(a), which referred to mandatory challenges.\n\nThe event concluded with the Gala dinner that evening in which the new web page was unveiled, and the annual awards were handed out. Golden Boy Promotions won three awards (NABO Promoter of the Year, and two Special Recognition Awards for Eric Gomez as matchmaker of the year and to Golden Boy Promotions from WBO Intercontinental), while Bob Arum and Top Rank won three as well (NABO Special Recognition Award, Executive of the Year award to Carfl Moretti , and Promoter of the Year for Bob Arum). Wladimir Klitschko won Fighter of the Year award, while Marco Huck won the Most Exciting Fighter of the Year Award. Mario Margossian won Latin Promoter of the Year, and Wilfred Sauerland won European Promoter of the Year. Yessica Bopp won Female Fighter of the Year, while Promoter Frank Warren received a Special Recognition Award, as well as Heavyweight Contender Chauncy Welliver.\n\nhttp://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/wbo-convention-day-3-2-99916\n\nPhotos from: http://www.notifight.com/artman2/publish/Reporte_7/Baja_el_tel_n_de_la_24_Convenci_n.php\n\nBy David Finger\n\nPhotos: WBO\n\nThe WBO 24th Annual Convention continued on Wednesday for its second day of events, highlighted by President Francisco “Paco” Valcarcel’s report and a guest speaker who provided a training seminar for various boxing officials: Hall of Fame trainer Emanuel Steward.\n\nThe event kicked off in the morning with Mr. Jorge Molina’s report on WBO Latin America. Mr. Molina once again gave a informative and well researched presentation, which highlighted the WBO Latino’s history in developing future world Champions. Pointing out that since 1996 (when WBO Latino started), the regional organization has sanctioned over four hundred and thirty four fights, with 2011 being the biggest year ever with forty seven title fights since last year’s convention in Colombia.\n\nPerhaps just as significant is Mr. Molina’s ability to spread out these championship fights all over two continents. Argentina has held the bulk of the fights in 2011 (with seventeen), but is quickly followed by Brazil (ten), Puerto Rico, the United States and Mexico. Most impressive for Mr. Molina, however, is the continued tradition of WBO Latino as a training ground for World Champions. Ninety-five WBO Latino champions have gone on to fight for a world title, including eleven in 2010, and thirty-two who would go on to win a world championship. For Mr. Molina, the secret to his success is in a plan that could rival Herman Cain’s “9-9-9″ in its simplicity: quality.\n\n“The criteria for a Latino regional title is either of the two fighters is eligible to be ranked,” commented Mr. Molina, “Quality will be beyond quantity. That is why the Latino title has garnered such results.”\n\nAfter Mr. Molina’s presentation, a video was shown highlighting 20-years of great WBO title fights, featuring such legends as Floyd Mayweather, Oscar De la Hoya, Evander Holyfield and Bernard Hopkins.\n\nFrom there a President Valcarcel heard a discussion on the soon to be implemented changes to the WBO web page, which will soon have such additions as videos and executive blogs.\n\nAn early “happy birthday” was offered to Dr. Ramon Pina, who will be turning ninety years old in November, and Golden Boy Promotions and its representative Eric Gomez, was given a round of applace for its assistance in securing the golf course used earlier in the week (Oscar De la Hoya was a member of the club).\n\nFrom there, discussions went to the recent challenges to the WBO trademark and name.\n\n“We are perfectly protected,” commented WBO member Edoardo Ceccoli, “one by renovation and another for the transaction for being inscribe in the European registry.”\n\nThe legal discussions continued on the matter, in particular the problems with the EBU and British Boxing Board of Control.\n\nFrom there President Valcarcel presented his report, and he started out by highlighting the achievements of noted Pilipino boxers.\n\n“We have five champions, four men and one woman,” commented President Valcarcel, “We congratulate the Philippine (fighters) for the great achievements through our organization.”\n\nFrom there President Valcarcel admitted that he was not yet satisfied with the amount of money going into charitable contributions and its “WBO Kids Drug Free” program.\n\n“We are not happy with the money we are assigning for the youth,” admitted President Valcarcel, “We want at least 40-50% of money we make to go to educating youth through boxing, particularly in poorer countries. I spoke to the accountant and we will increase the donation budget this year.”\n\nPresident Valcarcel also challenged WBO champions to continue to be role models for the World’s youth.\n\n“Our WBO champs don’t only have to be good fighters, they also have to be great role models for the youth.”\n\nPresident Valcarcel then invited attendees to visit the new WBO Offices tomorrow, as the WBO will have free tours provided. From there Luis Bautista Salas followed with a call for honor and dignity.\n\n“We have to return dignity to boxing,” said Salas, “We have to be honorable in the process that we are going to move forward for the good of the sport. These principles have been upheld. I thank you all, and in particular to Francisco Valcarcel. He has brought it to the pinnacle. We are the greatest organization because we have the highest quality of people working with us.”\n\nPresident Valcarcel then concluded with a quik summary of the finances of the WBO.\n\n“The WBO is financially sound,” concluded Valcarcel, “We don’t’ owe anyone any money, we have money in the bank. The office is ours, the equipment is ours. We are financially number one, but more important we are morally number one.”\n\nThe Convention then moved into the awards ceremony, with such worldwide dignitaries such as promoters Nestor Tobias (from Namibia) and Sammy Gello-Ani (from the Philippines) receiving promoter of the year awards from their respective regions.\n\nThe convention then went to the floor for discussions on the location for the 25th Annual Convention. Three locations were nominated, Florida, Las Vegas, and Cleveland Ohio. Cleveland failed to make the final cut, and the board then voted overwhelmingly for the 2012 convention to be held in the State of Florida with Nevada being selected as an alternate location.\n\nAfter lunch the convention continued with the seminars for referees, judges, and inspectors. Perhaps most noteworthy was the presence of Emanuel Steward, who gave a fascinating speech on the obligations of those officials. It was a powerful speech in which he challenged those in attendance to protect the integrity of the sport.\n\n“Boxing is a billion dollar industry,” commented Steward, “and we can’t keep having these controversial decisions with a lot of the same people involved.”\n\nSteward also discussed the impact one bad call could have not only on the sport but also on the fighters involved.\n\n“Fighters are training hard,” Steward said, “but it all goes down the drain with one bad call.”\n\nSteward then challenged commissions that overworked referees and judges on major cards, citing instances when referees and judges are working from the four round undercard all the way to the main event.\n\n“They are already physically and mentally worn out.”\n\nSteward, who also commented on the importance of nutrition, then made a strong argument for the implementation of an instant replay.\n\n“It’s all about making proper decisions and the proper calls,” commented Steward, “we have time in a fight. We have all this airtime and we can’t take five minutes to review a call in a twelve round fight?!”\n\nFrom there the referees held their seminar, reviewing several of the high profile fights which involved controversy on the part of the referees. Clips were played of the Mayweather-Ortiz fight, the Hopkins-Dawson fight and the Abner Mares Joseph Agbeko fight. With an open discussion of the performance of all three referees in those fights, many in attendance gained perhaps the most useful lesson from one of the referees whose performance had been widely criticized in one of the aforementioned fights: Russell Mora, who was in attendance.\n\n“I made mistakes in that fight,” admitted Mora, “I was too close to the fighters for the last knockdown and as a result I missed it.”\n\nIt was a lesson in mechanics that proved valuable for many of the referee’s in attendance, all of them recognizing that Mora was a very good referee whose mistakes in that one fight proved to be a disaster for not only Joseph Agbeko, but also himself in 2011.\n\nhttp://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/wbo-convention-day-2-2-99758\n\nStory and photos by David Finger\n\nThe 24th Annual WBO Convention kicked off Tuesday morning with exciting developments in the form of a new title, new developments with the regional titles, and major developments in what is proving to be one of the most exciting additions to the WBO in recent years in its female champions.\n\nThe event kicked off with roll call, followed by an invocation from second Vice President Jacinth Bryan Labega. After approving the prior minutes from the 2010 Convention in Cartagena, Colombia, the WBO adknowledged several of the notable fighters who came out to support the WBO. Female champions Yesica Bopp from Argentina (the reigning 108 pound champion) and 115 pound champion Carolina Duer (also from Argentina) received warm ovations, as did WBO Asia Pacific Heavyweight champion and #10 ranked WBO contender Chauncy Welliver. From there the president suggested a slight change in the agenda and moved President’s Luis Batista Salas Championship Committee Report to be done first.\n\nA short video highlighting the accomplishments of the WBO’s “Kids Drug Free” program followed, showcasing the WBO’s commitment to continuing service to the community in places as diverse as Mexico and the Philippines.\n\nHowever, Mr. Salas’ report did start off with a somewhat sobering reminder of the recent economic downturn suffered in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\n“International boxing has become a victim of what the modern world is victim of,” commented Mr. Salas, “an economic monetary crisis.”\n\nAfter Mr. Salas then thanked those members who came out to Puerto Rico he added some promising news that quickly lightened the mood. The WBO “had more championship fights than all other organizations,” MR. Salas proudly announced.\n\n“Even though boxing is taking up a position of retreat, we have been able to remain firm because we have great champions and great promoters,” added Mr. Salas, “we held thirty nine championship fights so far this year. All the parts of the world have had participation with a lot of fights.”\n\nMr. Salas then commented on the integrity and openness of the WBO being a major reason for its success.\n\n“In the past, sanctioning organizations were controlled by one promoter, or two or three at most. But this is a highly democratic organization, highly respected. Wherefore we have more than forty active promoters in the WBO. That is more active promoters than all the other organizations together.”\n\nMr. Salas then was able to add very promising news about one of the more recent decisions adopted by the WBO, the inclusion of female champions. When the WBO decided to sanction female championship fights in the 2008 Convention in Hungary, it was at times contentious and somewhat controversial with some boxing purist. But Mr. Salas was happy to announce the decision proved to be highly beneficial for not only the WBO, but for women’s boxing as well.\n\n“Last year you approved championship bouts with women, and last year we had a very fruitful discussion. But women have been gaining ground and we have to respect the decision. I am of the opinion that women have done a service to this organization and I would like to that all of you for the bringing women into the professional championship world.”\n\nMr. Salas then offered some pleasantly surprising numbers that impressed many of the WBO attendees.\n\n“Women only started last year, and (already) we had twenty six womens world championship bouts!”\n\nMr. Salas then acknowledged the boxing community in both Haiti and Argentina for their commitment and development of women’s boxing.\n\nAfter Mr. Salas’ report, Mr. Adolfo Flores Monge presented the treasurers report. Despite the recent world wide recession that Mr. Salas referred to, Mr. Monge was happy to announce the the WBO’s revenue increased this year, and that over $115,000 was donated to the “Kids Drug Free” program, one of the largest charitable donations in boxing in recent years.\n\nWBO attorney Andrew Horn then commented on the WBO continued commitment to not only it’s non-profit status, but also its commitment to combating poverty and service.\n\nFrom there Juan Carlos Tapia presented an excellent video of the history of Puerto Rican fighters. The video was divided into three sections: fighters who were in the Hall of Fame, fighters who should be in the Hall of Fame, and fighters who will be in the Hall of Fame. The sheer volume of names on all three list was a testament to the vital and important role played by Puerto Rican fighters in shaping the history of boxing, and fans and attendees watched clips of such legends such as Carlos Ortiz, Wilfredo Gomez, Wilfred Benitez, Jose Torres, Edwin Rosario, Esteban De Jesus, Wilfredo Vasquez, and Felix Trinidad.\n\nFrom there President Valcarcel moved to the regional vice presidents reports. But he was proud to announce the success of the newest WBO title: the WBO Youth Title. He then offered his congratulations to the success of the Cuban boxers and Joe Hernandez. However, President Valcarcel did offer his opinion that, in rare instances, the WBO had sanctioned fights that they should have reconsidered.\n\n“We don’t approve fights with bums,” President Valcarcel said sternly, “sometimes we have a problem with fighters who become regional champions who are not qualified to be ranked.”\n\nOne of the major problems where this emerged was with fighters in Africa. President Valcarcel admitted that it was often hard to keep track of “real” records of some of the African fighters.\n\n“Many African fighters don’t have a record,” commented President Valcarcel.\n\nVice President, and head of WBO Africa, Andrew Smale admitted that it was a problem in the past.\n\n“Sometimes I have problems with fights in East Africa,” admitted Smale, “the problem is that we get the records from the commissions, which doesn’t have the same record as on Boxrec. The problem is to actually get these records verified you have to go back to journalistic records and video of the fights which is very difficult. It can be done but it is very difficult and time consuming.”\n\nDespite the setback, President Valcarcel commended Vice President Smale for his amazing work in Africa and the strides made in developing boxing on the continent.\n\nDespite the nature of the conversation, many attendees felt it was a sign of the transparency of the WBO that such a sensitive subject was being discussed in such an open manner.\n\nThe next report presented was NABO and WBO Intercontinental Executive Director Mark Reels.\n\nThe NABO did suffer a slight decline from the previous year, with twenty nine championship fights in 2010, and fifteen so far in 2011 it was looking like the NABO would come up slightly short of its previous totals from 2010. However, several unforeseen circumstances did seem to unduly lower the numbers. Several canceled fights and two vacant title fights resulting in uncrowned champions due to overweight fighters were cited. However, with a scheduled NABO title fight scheduled in Canada later in the year, it was looking as if the year would end strongly.\n\n“As a former professional fighter myself I will not approve a fight with fighters of lesser quality,” added Mr. Reels.\n\nThe NABO, despite the slight drop from 2010, did have another profitable year with over $45,000 raised, and with six title fights scheduled before the end of the year, Reels was anticipating gross sales of over $61,000. Although Reels admitted it would be the lowest gross revenue the NABO collected since 2005, he was optimistic that the strong finish to the year, would lead to a strong recovery in 2012.\n\nThe WBO Intercontinental report followed, with exciting developments as the number of fights so far has increased from seventeen in 2010 to 27 so far in 2011. Much of the increase was due to Vice President Reels and member Edoardo Ceccoli’s exciting expansion of the WBO Intercontinental in the USA.\n\n“In the previous year there were sixteen European Intercontinental title fights to only one in the United States,” commented Ceccoli, “This year there are 10 Intercontinental fights in the USA.”\n\nAfter lunch Vice President Leon Panoncillo gave his Asia Pacific Report. Mr. Panoncillo’s success with the WBO Asia Pacific continued in 2011 with another banner year for the regional title.\n\nAlthough there was a slight drop in revenue, in part due to the nature of the high profile David Tua title fight in 2010, Panoncillo was happy to announce the WBO was doing three times as many title fights as their competitors in the OPBF and PABA. With strong support from the Philippines, Thailand, and China, the WBO is continuing to grow in the region. Panoncillo commented on the success of not only the Asia Pacific championship (which held twenty seven fights in 2011) but also some of the other regional titles such as the Oriental title (which saw twenty one title fights in 2011) and the newest belt: the WBO Asia Pacific Youth championship, which saw ten championship fights in 2011. In all, Panoncillo and the Asia Pacific region saw over 59 championship fights in 2011, with revenue over $56,000. But Panoncillo also added that these fighters are seeing the fruits of their commitment to the WBO and vice versa. Many of the Asian fighters who recently were fighting for regional eblts now see themselves fighting, and winning, world titles.\n\nFollowing Mr. Panoncillo’s report, Vice President Andrew Smale gave his report on WBO boxing. Once again Mr. Smale showed why he is quickly establishing himself as one of the WBO’s most valuable commodities, with further grown in the continent and what is looking very close to absolute WBO dominance of the boxing scene in Africa. Smale was proud to announce eighteen title fights in 2010. And so far in 2011, he has presided over seventeen with five future dates confirmed. It is rapidly expanding each year, and despite the difficulties promoters in Africa face, the WBO’s commitment to boxing in Africa is clearly paying huge dividends. Smale also commented in the increasing strength of boxing in Ghana, and the impressive nature of the numbers when compared with some of the rival organizations. The ABU (associated with the WBC) had only one fight in 2011, as did the WBC Intercontinental. The IBF Africa Championship has yet to do a fight in 2011. Smale closed by announcing that the WBO collected $21,400 in Africa so far this year, and he is optimistic that at least two African regional champions may get title fights in the coming year.\n\nAfter Andrew Smale’s report,Vice President Istvan” Koko” Kovacs gave his report on the state of WBO Europe.\n\nAlthough the WBO still is having problems with the actions of the European Boxing Union, the growth of the WBO Europe still remains impressive. In 2009 there were only two title fights. In 2010 it was up to twelve fights. So far in 2011 there have been eighteen fights, proving that 2011 will be a banner year for WBO Europe. Thus far, the WBO Europe has collected over $61,000 this year.\n\nNext came Zhang Tao’s report on the state of the WBO China Region. With a successful debut in 2010 in a fight that hosted Mike Tyson as an ambassador, the boxing scene in China proved to be one of the most untapped and prosperous regions in the world for the sport. A televised fight featuring Heavyweight contender Chauncy Welliver in China (where he is affectionately nicknamed the Panda) was seen by over seventeen million people, making him one of the most recognizable fighters in the largest country in the world.\n\nMarkus Aslani followed with his report on female boxing in the WBO. He proudly announced the the WBO had over twenty six fights since the last convention, with over twenty this year alone. Aslani was also confident that 2012 would also see continued expansion.\n\nJohn Duggan then gave a very brief report from the Grievance Committee, stating that 2011 was, thus far, “another good… problem free year.”\n\nPresident Valcarcel did add that the problems with the EBU and the British Board of Boxing and Control may require more drastic action from the WBO in the form of litigation in the courtroom.\n\nBritish member Dennis Gilmartin commented on the problems he had with the BBB when he was working on the promotional end of the sport.\n\n“It’s a board issue,” commented Gilmartin, “they won’t recognize us . It’s not a promotion issue. I think it’s an issue between WBO and the British Boxing Board of control.”\n\nPresident Valcarcel showed his growing frustration with the position of the EBU as well, addition that although they were working towards a resolution, litigation may be in the near future if nothing could be done.\n\n“We are still working on that recognition. But sooner or later, I’m telling you, if we have to we will do something in Court. It is very expensive, but if we have to do it we will.”\n\nMuch of the dispute is around the alleged EBU position that the name “Euoropean Champion” remains their trademark, a position that Mr. Duggan (an attorney), finds offensive and preposterous.\n\n“They can’t own the name ‘European champion’,” commented Duggan, “they don’t own that name. That name is owned by the people of Europe and the world. That’s why it is so arrogant that they take this position. It’s not their right to force a boxer to choose (between the WBO and EBU). It’s not there right to force a promoter to chose. It’s an offence to the law. It is very detrimental to the sport of boxing.”\n\nWBO attorney Andrew Horn also commented on the legality of the alleged EBU position.\n\n“What they are doing is an obstruction of free trade,” added Horn, “It amounts to anti-trust. They can’t restrict free enterprise. They own their name, the prefix. But not ‘European’. They have no honorable position. The WBO has been honorable not to take this to litigation, not to air this out in the courts, if we don’t get this worked out soon we have no choice but to work this out in the courts. I have recommended to the WBO that we file suit a long time ago. We never lost a case. I think most people are afraid to sue us. I think Paco has given it a tremendous run and done what he can to keep it out of court, but I think it has run its course”.\n\nhttp://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/wbo-convention-day-one-99653"
