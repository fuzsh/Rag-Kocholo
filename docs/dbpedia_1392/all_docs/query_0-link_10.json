        "text": "Julio César Chávez González (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈxuljo ˈsesaɾ ˈtʃaβez ɣonˈsales]; born July 12, 1962), also known as Julio César Chávez Sr., is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1980 to 2005. A multiple-time world champion in three weight divisions, Chávez was listed by The Ring magazine as the world's best boxer, pound for pound, from 1990 to 1993. During his career he held the WBC super featherweight title from 1984 to 1987, the WBA and WBC lightweight titles between 1987 and 1989, the WBC light welterweight title twice between 1989 and 1996, and the IBF light welterweight title from 1990 to 1991. He also held the Ring magazine and lineal lightweight titles from 1988 to 1989, and the lineal light welterweight title twice between 1990 and 1996. Chávez was named Fighter of the Year for 1987 and 1990 by the Boxing Writers Association of America and The Ring respectively.Chávez holds records for the most total successful defenses of world titles (27, shared with Omar Narváez), most title fight victories and fighters beaten for the title (both at 31), and most title fights (37); he has the second most title defenses won by knockout (21, after Joe Louis with 23). His fight record was 89 wins, 0 losses, and 1 draw before his first professional loss to Frankie Randall in 1994, before which he had an 87-fight win streak until his draw with Pernell Whitaker in 1993. Chávez's 1993 win over Greg Haugen at the Estadio Azteca set the record for the largest attendance for a boxing match: 132,274. He is ranked as the 17th best boxer of all time, pound for pound, by BoxRec, #24 on ESPN's list of \"50 Greatest Boxers of All Time\", and 18th on The Ring's \"80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years\". In 2010 he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame for the Class of 2011. He is the father of current boxers Omar Chávez and former WBC middleweight champion Julio César Chávez Jr.\n\nJuan Manuel Márquez Méndez (born August 23, 1973) is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1993 to 2014. He is the third Mexican boxer (after Érik Morales and Jorge Arce) to become a world champion in four weight classes, having held nine world championships including the WBA (Super), IBF and WBO featherweight titles between 2003 and 2007; the WBC super featherweight title from 2007 to 2008; the WBA (Super), WBO, Ring magazine and lineal lightweight titles between 2008 and 2012; and the WBO junior welterweight title from 2012 to 2013. In a career that spanned over twenty years, Márquez was known for being a fast and highly technical boxer who was exceptionally skilled at combinations and counterpunches, yet also willing to engage in slugfests with opponents. He was also credited for his toughness, and never lost a fight by stoppage. His most notable bouts include his four-fight saga with Manny Pacquiao and his fight against fellow Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera. Márquez is considered to be one of the greatest Mexican boxers of all time, and is ranked by BoxRec as the 16th greatest boxer of all time, as well as second best Mexican fighter of all time, pound for pound. In 2008, The Ring ranked him as the world's second best active boxer, pound for pound.\n\nMarco Antonio Barrera Tapia (born January 17, 1974) is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1989 to 2011. He held multiple world championships in three weight classes, including the WBO junior featherweight title twice between 1995 and 2001, the Ring magazine and lineal featherweight titles between 2001 and 2003, and the unified WBC and IBF super featherweight titles between 2004 and 2007. Barrera is well known for his trilogy with fellow Mexican legend Érik Morales, his duology with Manny Pacquiao, and rivalry with Juan Manuel Márquez. ESPN ranked Barrera as number 43 on their list of the 50 greatest boxers of all time. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nSalvador Sánchez Narváez (January 26, 1959 – August 12, 1982) was a Mexican boxer born in the town of Santiago Tianguistenco, Estado de México. Sanchez was the WBC and lineal featherweight champion from 1980 to 1982. Many of his contemporaries as well as boxing writers believe that, had it not been for his premature death, Sánchez could have gone on to become the greatest Featherweight boxer of all time. Sánchez died on August 12, 1982 in a car accident from Querétaro to San Luis Potosí He is also the uncle of Salvador Sánchez II.In 1991, Sánchez was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. The Ring magazine named both him, and Sugar Ray Leonard, as Fighter of the Year in 1981. In 2002, he was named the 24th greatest fighter of the past 80 years by The Ring magazine. In 2003, The Ring rated Sánchez number 88 on the list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. Sánchez was voted as the #3 featherweight of the 20th Century by the Associated Press."
