        "text": "Learn more about one of our newest team members, Raul Garcia\n\nWith more than 25 years of experience in the corporate gifting and incentives industry, Raul Garcia joined Incentive Concepts earlier this year as Territory Sales Manager for Illinois and Wisconsin. We sat down with Raul for a quick Q&A session to learn about him, his family, his favorites activities, and more.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago. Along with my wife and two boys, we have been living in our current town for 18 years.\n\nWhat is your favorite vacation spot and what travel plans do you have this year?\n\nEurope has been our favorite repeat destination so far. We’ve been fortunate to travel around the world, but we continue to be amazed by the history and culture in Europe. We are visiting the Grand Canyon this summer: it’s one of those once-in-a-lifetime vacations that we’re finally checking off our list.\n\nFirst job?\n\nMy first job ever was working at a pizza joint when I was in high school. I was making $6.25 an hour, and I thought I had struck gold as minimum wage was $4.25 at the time.\n\nHow would your spouse/significant other describe you?\n\nVery handy. My wife and I rehabbed and flipped a few properties when we first got married and we had to learn a lot about home improvement in order to maximize profit.\n\nFavorite hobbies, exercise routines or weekend activities?\n\nGolf. I love to get out on the links for however long the Chicago weather allows. I love walking the course and can usually get 15K steps in during a typical 18-hole round. During the winter months, I play in an old-man’s basketball league to keep me moving in the cold Chicago winters.\n\nDo you like to cook? What is your favorite recipe?\n\nMy wife and I tend to cook healthier than our parents did, but we love to grill in the backyard, and I make a mean filet. Just a nice, quality piece of meat grilled to perfection on my Broil King grill with a dash of sea salt and crushed black pepper.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I wanted to be an attorney. Fighting the good fight for those who couldn’t always fascinated me.\n\nAnything else unique/interesting you’d like to share?\n\nI have spent my entire professional career in the loyalty and recognition space. I have never worked outside of the premium and incentives industry because this industry is truly the right fit for me!"
