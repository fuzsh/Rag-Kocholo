        "text": "Commonly Used Modules in AFPIMS\n\nBelow you will find a sampling of the most commonly-used modules in AFPIMS available to our Content Managers. Use the Jump-Menu to help navigate through the page, reviewing what is available for use on your pages.\n\nPlease Note: DLA Content Managers may not have adequate permissions to add each of these modules onto their site. If you would like to use one of the modules below and you do not see it listed in your available modules window, please reach out to DLA Public Affairs or an AFPIMS Site Administrator for assistance.\n\nHTML and Live HTML Module\n\nTraining: HTML and Live HTML Module\n\nThe HTML and Live HTML modules are some of the most popular module types due to their versatility. They provide two text editors for creating your own content either as HTML or as plain text. The module interfaces are very similar to most popular document editors. With these modules, you can add text, images, and links in multiple formats to fit your needs.\n\nWhich module to choose? If you are using a workflow that requires approval before content goes live, use the Live HTML module. Otherwise, every other circumstance requires the use of the HTML module. Generally at DLA, use the standard HTML module as there is no requirement for content to be formally approved via a workflow prior to going live.\n\nThis text that you are reading right now is contained within a standard HTML module.\n\nThere are alternative containers that Content Managers can use to enhance the HTML module on a page. This is an example of using the DOD2-Card-Rounded container.\n\nYou can find examples of all available containers on the Panes and Containers Training Document (scroll to page 11).\n\nTraining: Accordion Menu Module\n\nThe Accordion Menu module allows you to add expandable/collapsible navigation menus to pages within your site. These menus and sub-menus should be links to relevant and related pages within your section of DLA.mil. The expandable nature and customization to content provides a more versatile menu that helps site visitors navigate your site.\n\nSee an example of how DLA accordion menus are formatted to the right.\n\nAccordion menu settings should be set to:\n\nTemplate: Army Corps of Engineers Responsive\n\nCheck the box labeled \"Convert to Jump Menu on Mobile\"\n\nIn the Page Settings tab, the module container should be \"DOD2-Empty-No-Padding\"\n\nArticleCS Dashboard Module\n\nTraining: ArticleCS Dashboard Module\n\nThe ArticleCS Dashboard module displays dashboard items such as specific lists of articles based on category designations, archived article lists displayed by date, or other similar options. All ArticleCS Dashboards work in conjunction with an ArticleCS module that is generally located on your main article landing page.\n\nTwo examples are displayed below, both of which are tied to the NEWS ArticleCS library. One uses the DOD2-Card template and the second uses the DOD2-Explore template.\n\nTypes of ArticleCS libraries that we have on DLA.mil, of which you can place Dashboards on your pages, include:\n\nNews\n\nApplications\n\nBiographies\n\nBrochures\n\nTraining\n\nEvents Module\n\nTraining: Calendar/Events Module\n\nThe Events module provides a way to display a calendar of events. Events can be a single event or a reoccurring event. This module can include information, links, and images to inform viewers of upcoming events. Also, it can be set to be seen and used by internal AFPIMS users or made public to be seen by your viewers by setting permissions.\n\nThe example below is from the Small Business Office. DO NOT MAKE CHANGES to the module shown below, as it will impact the live version on the Small Business page.\n\nThe view of the Events module can be a List or Calendar (Month or Week)\n\nExpandable Text Module\n\nTraining: Expandable Text/HTML Module\n\nThe Expandable Text/HTML Module is an interactive space saving module designed to eliminate large walls of text with the use of expandable/collapsible content containers. This helps to clean up the look of a page that has links to content. The module works by connecting large blocks of text to shorter, sortable titles and providing an interface for the expansion or collapse of the larger text by toggling a [+/-] button.\n\nPlease note that styling for this module on DLA.mil is standardized via sitewide CSS. The default styling should not be overridden and standard font styling should used for the header, title, and body content.\n\nHot Info Bar Module\n\nTraining: Hot Info Bar Module\n\nThe Hot Info Bar provides a display for information that may only be relevant at certain times. Think of it as an emergency information area for special circumstances. It can be turned on and off easily, and provides a way to link to pertinent information that affects your site. Note that it is best used on a site’s home page where it will have the most impact to visitors.\n\nMosaic Links Module\n\nTraining: Mosaic Links Module\n\nThe Mosaic Links module allows you to create a group of large, tiled graphics that link to internal or external resources or pages on your site. Note: Users should first upload the images to the Shared Media Manager in a 16:9 aspect ratio, because the module pulls the images directly from the Shared Media Manager. Note: This module only works with responsive skins.\n\nMosaic modules can be created with 3, 5, or 7 mosaic tiles.\n\nWhen using this module on DLA.mil:\n\nColor Cast should be set to the darkest blue option\n\nColor Intensity should be set to 80 on all devices\n\nThere are many pre-generated images designed by DLA personnel for use in these modules - reach out to DLA Public Affairs for more information on where to find these images\n\nPhoto Dashboard Module\n\nTraining: Photo Dashboard Module\n\nThe Photo Dashboard module can be used in many ways to allow you the freedom of presenting images in unique and eye catching ways. Depending on your branch of service and the theme of your site, you are able to present images with text, links, floating lightboxes, and more. Other options allow you to create an automatically updating list of photos on your site or one big and bold image to grab the audience’s attention.\n\nThere are two main ways we use Photo Dashboard Modules on DLA.mil, one is a full page width banner image at the top of the page, and the other is a smaller columned banner image on top of an HTML module to draw the user's attention to the content. See the examples below.\n\nFor more information about styling and usage of the Photo Dashboard Module, go to the Webmasters SharePoint site and review the Website Redesign Guide.\n\nWhen using the Photo Dashboard module as a major banner on top of a page:\n\nForm Type: DefenseGov\n\nTemplate: Background Image\n\nEnsure the image dimensions are: 1140x150\n\nUse the Container: DOD2-Empty-No-Padding\n\nUse 150px as the Image Height\n\nSimple Maps Module\n\nTraining: Simple Maps Module\n\nThe Simple Maps module allows you to embed a Google Map into the module for display on your site. You need to use Google Maps, https://www.google.com/maps, to retrieve the Embed link. Keep in mind the following process is done on a third party site, and is subject to change without notice. Once that is done, you can import the map to AFPIMS.\n\nSlide Show Module\n\nTraining: Slide Show Module\n\nThe Slideshow module is a versatile module that allows you to display images from your Shared Media Manager in ways that are eye catching and attractive to your audience. You have several display options with the Slideshow module, including the typical slideshow that is the focal point of most AFPIMS home pages, as well as a Carousel and Top Rotator. Whichever display options you choose, images are added in the same way.\n\nThe example below is from the Aviation Homepage. DO NOT MAKE CHANGES to the module shown below, as it will impact the live version on the Aviation page.\n\nTanLD Responsive HTML Tabs, aka Tabbed HTML Module\n\nTraining: Tabbed HTML Module\n\nThe HTML Tabs module is a fully customizable, responsive tabs module. It allows you to take any HTML content, including images, video, or a module, and display it in a clean, organized, and responsive tabbed navigation format.\n\nWhen using the Tabbed HTML Module on DLA.mil, use the following settings:\n\nContainer: DOD2 - Empty-With-Margin\n\nTheme: flat-af-blue\n\nThe following suggestions are also provided:\n\nSize is flexible, but always test the size to ensure tab titles are readable on all devices\n\nStyle is flexible, but we suggest using either Contained or Clean - “Contained” throws a blue-gray background behind the content and adds a margin around it - “Clean” provides no background color behind the content and allows the text to span the whole width of the module\n\nOrientation is flexible, decision to be vertical or horizontal should be made on a case-by-case basis\n\nPosition is suggested to be Top, but we allow for flexibility here as well depending on how you want it to look\n\nWe suggest checking all the check-boxes, as each one enhances the style of the module\n\nUse Deep-Linking if you plan to use anchor links to direct users to specific tabs\n\nIn general, Animation Settings should be left alone\n\nThis first example shows Medium Tabs, Contained Style, Horizontal Orientation, and Top-Compact Position\n\nThis third example shows how we can force a \"Hamburger\" menu above the Tabbed HTML content.\n\nTo do this, in the Module Settings, under the Tabs Settings, find the Responsive Settings, and change \"Max Rows\" to 0. Otherwise, use Horizontal Orientation and Top Position. In this example, we also show what it looks like to uncheck the \"Rounded\" check-box - notice the hamburger menu has sharper edges than the previous two examples, which were more rounded."
