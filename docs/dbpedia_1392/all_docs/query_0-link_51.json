        "text": "by M.A.O'Neill\n\nPuerto Rico is a island of 9,104 km2 ( 3,515 Sqr. mi ) the population of less than 4 million.\n\nMexico is nation of the Area 1,972,550 km2 ( 761,606 sqr mi.) 15th in the World.\n\nThe Mexican population is plus 100,000,000 . 11th in the world.\n\nThe Puerto Rico vs. Mexico was really a non existent rivarly not until the 1970's . When Wilfredo Gomez defeated a total, of 17 Mexicans boxers, and suffered only one defeat to Mexican boxer Salvador Sanchez by Tko in 1981. Prior to Gomez, there were only major two Puerto Rican boxers vs. Mexican boxers bouts with importance. Until , 1926 when legislation was passed and signed into law in 1927 , by then the Governor of Puerto Rico , Horance Mann Tower. That made boxing a legal sport to be practiced in Puerto Rico . From then on boxing gyms were built throught the island, and seven years later Sixto Escobar, becomes the 1st Puerto Rican World champion by Knocking out Baby Cassanova in the 9th round in Montreal , Canada, on June 26, 1934. The second major bout between a Puerto Rican vs. Mexican was when Carlos Ortiz knock out Raymundo \" Battling \" Torres in Claifornia on the 10th round to win the World Lightweight title in 1960.\n\nAt first I tried to see head to head just Mexican boxers and Mexican American boxers versus Puerto Rican boxers, and I found Wilfredo Gomez 17 - 1 , Juan LaPorte 9-7 , John John Molina 14 -5 , Hector \"Macho\" Camacho 8-3, Felix Trinidad 5 - 0, Carlos Ortiz 3-0 , Wilfred Benitez 3 - 0. The total was 59 - 16 , but it made no sence, since Mexico produces countless club fighters because of their population and countless gyms. Championship fights are ususally when the best face the best.\n\nSo , I would hear any excuses I also added Antonio Margarito , who is still is favored by many Mexicans although they claim he did not use Plaster of Paris versus Cintron and Cotto. I found the total of 80 plus championship bouts from Minimunweight to Cruiserweight title fights from the 1930 's to the present day. I included the championship bouts of Puerto Rican boxers Wilfredo Gomez ,Juan LaPorte ,John John Molina ,Hector Luis \" Macho \" Camacho ,Felix \"Tito\" Trinidad ,Sixto \" El Gallito \" Escobar ,Wilfredo \" El Radar\" Benitez ,Wilfredo Vasquez ,Daniel Santos, Eric Morel ,Carlos Ortiz. And Mexican boxers Lupe Pintor, Julio Cesar Chavez Sr., Oscar De La Hoya , Salvador Sanchez, Erik Morales, Marco A.Barrera, Jose Luis Ramirez, Tony \"Tiger\" Lopez, Carlos Palomino, Fernando Vargas, Antonio Margarito, and Pipino Cuevas.\n\nWorld Championships Fights.\n\n(WBC,WBA, IBF , WBO, NBA and World Titles circa 1930's )\n\nPuerto Rican Boxers vs. Mexican & Mexican American Boxers:\n\n Wilfredo Gomez defeats Lupe Pintor by TKO 14: WBC Super Bantamweight title 1982.\n\n Wilfredo Gomez defeats Roberto Rubaldino TKO 8: WBC Super Bantamweight title 1982.\n\n Wilfredo Gomez defeats Juan Meza TKO 6 : WBC Super Bantamweight title 1982.\n\n Wilfredo Gomez defeats Carlos Mendoza TKO 10: WBC Super Bantamweight title 1979.\n\n Wilfredo Gomez defeats Carlos Zarate TKO 5 : WBC Super Bantamweight title 1978.\n\n Wilfredo Gomez defeats Juan Antonio Lopez TKO 10: WBC Super Bantamweight title 1978.\n\n Wilfredo Gomez defeats Raul Tirado TKO 5: WBC Super Bantamweight title 1977.\n\n Wilfredo Gomez defeats Nicky Perez TKO 5 : WBC Super Bantamweight title 1979.\n\n Juan Laporte defeats Ruben Castillo : WBC Featherweight title 1983 .\n\n John J.

He nearly decapitated Yuri Boy in that fight. After pulling himself off the canvas and Papa Trinidad \" dandole su galleta\", Tito came back and took it.\n\nMany experts did see Yuri Boy as the next Chavez, but in reality he wasn't on that level, a good fighter just not on that Chavez level.\n\nHey I don't see Jose Luis Ramirez TKO Edwin \"Chapo\" Rosario 4RD\n\nThis was a great fight where \"El Chapo\" dropped Ramirez like three times in the 1st two rounds. Then immediatly Ramirez came back and landed some serious body shots that caused Rosario to give his back quiting in Puerto Rico!!!\n\nI love this rivalry and I don't really care who up as long as they keep fighting. When it's Mex vs PR (championship fight ) you're gettinig a great scrap!!!"
