        "text": "Fury Fighting Championship flyweight champion Jacob Silva will be competing on the fourth season of Dana White’s Contender Series this summer.\n\nA 10-year MMA veteran, Silva (6-2 MMA) announced the news in a recent Instagram post. He did not reveal a date or opponent for his DWCS fight.\n\nIn 2014, Silva lost his professional debut at Legacy FC 37. At Legacy FC 38, Silva was equally as unsuccessful in his sophomore outing. After an 0-2 start, Silva has rattled off six straight victories. All of his wins have come by finish, with five TKOs and one submission on his resume.\n\nAt LFA 35 in March 2018, Silva made his LFA debut. Taking on undefeated Raul Garcia, Silva finished the fight in 30 seconds with strikes.\n\nAt Fury FC 27, Silva won the vacant Fury FC flyweight title against Shawn Solis. Silva successfully defended the title at Fury FC 42 in February, when he defeated Christian Lira in 114 seconds.\n\nCheck out Silva’s DWCS announcement video below:"
