        "text": "\"Ice Water\" O'Shaquie Foster has a backstory that reads like a Hollywood script. From touted blue-chip prospect to two ShoBox losses in eight months to splitting with his promoter to a prison sentence. To resurgence and then, ultimate redemption and winning a world title against Rey Vargas, a former two-division world champ, in his home state. Foster may be the best 130-pounder in the world, and he most likely is. Those skills, reflexes, and ring IQ were on full display in Alamo City. As the 29-year-old, Orange native dominated from start to finish. Foster boxed brilliantly throughout the 12-round affair. Dominating the opening with just a jab. Dictating the pace, and getting in position to land while avoiding Vargas's heavy artillery. The opening few rounds were the same story Foster, the quicker sharper fighter would land in short combinations and Vargas would swing at air. Controlling the action early, the Texan began getting a bit more aggressive and started firing with right hands that started landing with laser-like precision, one in particular, staggered the former world champ at the end of the second round. Hitting and not getting hit, Foster remained in control throughout most of the middle rounds. However, Vargas began battling back and had his best moment in the ninth with a straight right that landed about midway through the round. The moment was short-lived as Ice Water seized control of the fight again scoring with left hooks in the final minute of the 10th that completely halted the temporary momentum put together by Vargas. Foster remained in control and the Hollywood script was completed. Foster Captured the vacant WBC title and responded by saying, “Man, it feels great. Man, this journey been crazy.” The final tallies were 119-109,117-111, and 116-112, all for the East Texan.\n\nIn the co-main event was the comeback of one of San Antonio's favorite sons, \"El Azteca\" Mario Barrios. Barrios became the first of the current crop of Alamo Citr fighters to capture a world title which he did back in 2019 when he outpointed Batyr Akhmedov. Barrios bounced back nicely off of his two-fight losing streak and secured his first win since Halloween 2021 when he stopped Milan, Texas native Ryan Karl, also in the Alamodome.\n\nA new look Barrios sported a Misfits tattoo and a new trainer in Bob Santos, and the new, more offensive and aggressive Barrios was on display immediately against Jovanie Santiago. As Barrios was applying pressure, jabbing, and firing off right hands backing his opponent up. He would then fire off a barrage of body shots that began taking its toll. By the sixth round, it became abundantly clear that Santiago was a sitting duck and not going to get through the 10-round affair. The beatdown continued into the seventh as Santiago was showing effects from the culmination of power shots and began backing down. Barrios jumped on his wounded opponent like a dog on fear. Santiago finally went down a minute into the eighth after getting hit by a left hook to the body. Santiago, tough as nails, was able to get up and continue. However, El Azteca slammed on the gas and unleashed another flurry of shots as the referee waved off the bout giving Barrios his first win in over two years and putting him back on track to regaining a world title and becoming a two-division world champion. Barrios moved to 6-0 (5) in his home city and 10-0 overall in the Lone Star State.\n\nIn a preliminary bout, our number one prospect to watch in 2023 kicked the new year off in spectacular fashion! \"The Unkown Warrior\" Fabian Diaz of Edinburg scored his second consecutive first-round KO moving his record to 4-0 (2). Diaz spent the opening moments of the fight working behind a snappy jab and looking to set up his power shots, the right hand in particular. Just past the one-minute mark, Diaz landed a right uppercut that staggered his opponent Eleazar Mendietta. Diaz then scored with a right hand to the body that hurt his opponent. The instructions flew in from the Rio Grande Valley native's corner that, \"He's done!... Knock him out.\" The Unknown warrior obliged and scored with a barrage of power shots. Scoring with one overhand right after another and putting in a left hook here and there just for good measure. With just under a minute to go in the opening round Diaz wound up on a right hand that sent Mendietta reeling across the ring. The Unkown Warrior kept on the gas and kept on firing until the referee came in and called a halt to the bout after a perfectly placed uppercut from the RGV native about took his head off.\n\nRGV Boxing has been on fire throughout 2022, and big-time boxing is going to stay in the valley in 2023! Kali Productions and Marines Promotions team up to bring the Valley a big-time card dubbed \"March Madness\". The card takes place on March 4th at the Llano Events Center in Mercedes and will have an outstanding all-action main event, as rugged veteran \" La Amenaza\" Roberto Garcia, fighting out of Weslaco, will take on \"El Tigre\" Raul Casarez of Edinburg.\n\nGarcia sports an impressive 46-5 (29) record and will defend his IBA Intercontinental title. Garcia has been in the ring with the likes of Liam Smith, Martin Murray, and Antonio Margarito. He has wins over Breidis Prescott and Victor Cayo.\n\nHis opponent, Raul Casarez, is fresh off his win over Jesus Angulo Leija via unanimous decision last month in Mercedes. Casarez has accumulated an impressive record of 24-10 (11). He has stepped in the ring with world-class fighters like Kurtiss Colvin, Alfredo Angulo, and Darryl Cunningham. There will also be an ABF title on the line.\n\nThe card will also feature all-world 140-pound prospect, Fabian Diaz. An Edinburg-based prospect, that was featured as our #1 fighter to emerge in 2023. Diaz is an explosive hard-hitting, blue-chip prospect with a 3-0 record and scored a vicious first knockout in his last time out last month in Mercedes.\n\nFan favorite \"Hot Hands\" Nelson Hampton of Donna, will be on the card as he looks to get back in the win column following his decision loss to Joshua Montoya last month in the Payne Arena in Hidalgo.\n\n1. Fabian Diaz Edinburg 3-0 (1) There's nothing not to like about Diaz, the best young fighter in the RGV is absolutely electric. He strikes so much similarity to a young Teofimo Lopez, a Teofimo Lopez who \"still had it\"! Everything Diaz throws is hard and violent. He's a seek-and-destroy fighter with superb skills and is always on the hunt. It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when for Diaz. The \"Unknown Warrior\" made his pro debut in July in San Antonio on a PBC and ran his record to 3-0 (1). He scored his latest win, a first-round KO earlier this month on a Marines Promotions Card. Look for the youngster to be back in the ring on another PBC Card early in 2023\n\n2. Juan Garcia Carrizo Springs 1-0 (1) If you have never heard of Carrizo Springs you're about to the south Texas town in Dimmit County is about 80 miles northwest of Laredo and has a population of about 5,000. Garcia is about to put the small south Texas town on the boxing map. A pure boxer-puncher with excellent fundamentals and one-punch power got off to an explosive start to his career. He made his pro debut on a P4P card in San Antonio and scored a first-round knockout. Unfortunately, The least experienced fighter on the list should be 3-0 but had two victories removed by the Texas Commission, so the only knock on the kid is that he might want to be a little more careful of who he hangs around.\n\n3.\" Panterita\" Jesus Martinez Del Rio 3-0 (1) The Future Of Boxing! The Phenom. The youngest fighter on the list. The 13x US National Champ and International Champ is as complete a fighter as a 17-year-old can be, and under the tutelage of Robert Garcia, the sky is truly the limit. An extraordinary athlete with terrific speed, one-punch power, a high ring IQ, plus all the accolades to back it up. Panterita caught the eye of former world champs Joe Calzaghe and Darren Baker and was the first fighter signed by their Management company ISG. Panterita has already fought on Matchroom Cards and has been streamed on DAZN.\n\n4. Daniel Cortez San Antonio 3-0 (1) the 20-year-old is already being touted as San Antonio's next great one. Cortez trains alongside fellow Alamo City natives and world champions Bam Rodriguez and Josh Franco, he served as one of Franco's chief sparring partners in his lead-up to the unification bout with Ioka. Cortez is a raw talent with unlimited upside, who after a brief but successful amateur career turned pro. He caught the eye of trainer Robert Garcia and has gotten off to an exceptional start in his professional career. He has a style that is made for pro success more than the amateurs and can band on the inside and his elite-level power but has the ability to use his height and reach and box from the outside. A gifted offensive fighter who can box at all three distances.\n\n5. Javy Fernández San Antonio 12-0 (6) Guaranteed action! Fernandez is a pressure fighter, a raw power puncher, who had a way too wide-base. Fernendez was discovered by trainer Rick Nunez of the South Park Boxing Academy and Nunez has his man on the verge of being a breakout star. Fernandez is no longer just a relentless come-forward swarmer. He has learned how to cut the ring off, force his opponents to exchange, and can wear them down. He also snappy jab he uses to get on the inside and much-improved footwork. When on the inside Fernandez is deadly and relentless.\n\n6. Sammy Castaneda Mercedes 9-0-1 (7)- Of all the Fighters on the list we know that Castaneda has the heart. He has that dog in him! The 9-0-1 prospect took a major step up and took on the biggest fight of his career as big-time boxing returned to the RGV as he battled Julio Sanchez in a lackluster fight that he still appeared to win but had to settle for a draw in. Castaneda didn't want to move on and forget it happened and his status as an A-side prospect to avoid a rematch. He was obsessed with the rematch, got his rematch, and delivered. He got up off the canvas and erased a three-point deficit on the scorecard after a second-round knockdown, shook it off, and dominated Sanchez for the remainder of the fight to pick up the MD victory.\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley was put on the world's boxing map when Weslaco native Omar Firugeroa captured the WBC lightweight title in 2013, dropping Nihito Arakawa multiple times and pummeling him on his way to taking a lopsided unanimous decision. His fan-friendly style captured the attention of the boxing community and then the emergence of his brother Brandon Figueroa and emerging contender and WBC international champ Omar Juarez established \"The Valley\" as one of boxing's premier hotbeds.\n\nThe RGV may have its next superstar on the rise already. 18-year-old \"Unknown Warrior\" Fabian Diaz has emerged as a must-see prospect in the 135 and 140-pound weight classes. He is about to be \"Unknown\" to the rest of the boxing world no more. His style, speed, power, and overall explosiveness remind one so much of Teofimo Lopez at this same stage of his development. The similarities between the two stylistically can not be denied. Diaz a quintessential boxer-puncher, sports the complete package. A good job, excellent footwork, incredible physical strength, speed, and explosive combination punchin\n\nDiaz, who hails from Edinburg, is a former US national champ who decided to turn pro earlier this summer when he was offered the opportunity to fight on the undercard of Magsayo-Vargas in the Alamodome after winning the WBC Amature Green Belt. He made his pro debut a successful one. Absolutely demolishing an outmatched Julio Gomez over four one-sided rounds. He picked up Saturday night where he left off. Picking up his second career win in his second professional bout. This time in front of his hometown fans in the Rio Grande Valley at the Payne Arena in Hidalgo.\n\nThe Unknown Warrior looked even more impressive this time out. A second-generation fighter, who looks to be learning quickly under the tutelage of his dad, former professional fighter Rene Diaz, the younger Diaz showed a complete bag in disposing of a rugged and determined opponent in Jesus Maldonado of Laredo. In the opening moments of the bout, an explosive Daiz ripped off a vicious right hand that sent Maldonado staggering into the ropes and followed up moments later with an explosive three-punch combination that left Maldonado not wanting to test the power of Diaz again. The Edinburg native spent the next three rounds showing off just how complete his bag is. Landing lead hooks and lead uppercuts with laser-like precision and shotgun-like force, snapping back the head of Maldonado. Diaz finished in sensational fashion, scoring with another lightning-quick three-punch combination to seal the deal in style. Diaz picked up another unanimous decision victory and again won every round on every judge's scorecard, 40-36 all on three cards.\n\nDiaz showed improved patience and combination punching from his already highly impressive pro debut. He hopes to be back in the ring by November.\n\nSammy \"El Gallo Fino\" Castaneda of Mercedes returned to the Rio Grande Valley for the first time since his pro debut, which was changed from a TKO victory in 2019 to a NC by the Texas commission. His other eight pro bouts took place in the Houston area and Matamoros, Mexico. Castaneda entered the ring to the lyrics of \"I am coming Home\" and received roaring applause from his RGV faithful. Setting the stage for Castaneda to deliver a brilliant performance against Houston native Julio Sanchez. After a careful and fairly even start to the opening round, Castaneda landed the first punch of consequence. A sweeping right hand at the end of the first caught the attention of Sanchez. The second round saw Sanchez trying to get on the inside and Castaneda trying to keep him at bay. A heated exchange in the final seconds of the second stanza saw each man land heavy artillery which set the tone for the remainder of the scrap. The RGV native got cooking in the third. Rocking the Houstonian early in the round and seemed to seize control of the fight for the remainder of the third and fourth rounds. Chants of Sammy, Sammy, spread throughout the Payne Arena. However, Sanchez perhaps seeing the fight slipping away on points, forced his way onto the inside and the two exchanged fireworks in the fifth. Sanchez was valiantly trying to fight his way back into the fight. The final stanza featured back and forth toe to toe action that ended with a big right hand by Castaneda that rang Sanchez's bell as the bell rang to end the sixth and final round. That shot seemed to signify the fight. A good competitive fight that Castaneda got the better of. That was the sentiment at ringside that Castaneda had escaped a tougher than expected contest. However, the judges overruled the ringside consensus, scoring the bout a majority decision draw by scores of 57-57 X2 and 58-56 in favor of the Mercedes native.\n\nIn another absolutely shocking decision, Laredo-based KO artist Nick Molina seemed to dominate Eduardo Guerra of Edinburg in what was likely the fight of the night due to Guerra's cast iron jaw. However, outside of a strong hometown applause from the crowd, Guerra struggled to get much going offensively after the first round. By the fourth and final round, he was a sitting duck for Molina's heavy artillery. Working behind a stiff jab and pinpoint power shots, the Gateway City native couldn't miss and kept rocking Guerra in what appeared to be a one-sided affair. However, the judges did the unthinkable and scored the bout a draw. With one judge scoring for Molina 40-36 and the other two scoring it 38-38.\n\nFellow Laredo native \"Triple J\" faired much better with the judges, showing off incredible hand speed and combination punching. Jasso controlled the distance and beat down a very rugged Juan Alberto Flores. A 21-year-old Jasso looked experienced beyond his years and has seemed to get into his own under new trainer Luey Villareal as he ran off his second consecutive win and moved his record to 4-2 (1).\n\nIn the KO of the night, McAllen native Javier Vargas scored a brutal first-round knockout of Houston-based Dominique Wiltz. A picture-perfect left hook from the McAllen native put Wiltz out before he hit the canvas. Wiltz somehow managed to get to his feet just as the referee counted to 10. However, he was in no position to continue fighting and the bout was waived off at 1:11 of the opening round. Making Vargas's pro debut a successful one. Having had just 18 amateur bouts plus coming off of a four-year layoff from boxing, Vargas certainly seems like a fighter who could make some noise if he remains active.\n\nIn what was the performance of the night 18-year-old Edinburg native \"The Unknown Warrior\" Fabian Diaz wowed the crowd. Looking like a young Teofimo Lopez, the explosive power of the RGV native was on display immediately as his outmatched opponent, Jesus Maldonado. Sending him backward and staggering into the ropes just seconds into the fight. Diaz then unleashed a three-punch-combination that again staggered Maldonado. He spent the next three rounds showing off just how deep his bag is. Landing lead hooks and lead uppercuts. Each shot was precise and on point and snapping back the head of his brave but outclassed opponent. Diaz finished on a strong note. Scoring with a lightning-quick three-punch combination. As he methodically took his man apart over the four-round distance and scored a UD victory by scores 40-36x3. Winning every round on every judge's card.\n\nIn other knockouts of note, Hector Aguirre, of Edinburg scored a vicious knockout via a thudding left hook to move his record to 3-0 (1). Plus Alexis \"Bamm Bamm\" Balderas, of San Juan, ended Keith Foreman's night with a perfectly placed body shot in the second round to move his record to 2-0-1 (2).\n\nFormer 122-pound world champion and all-action fan favorite Brandon \"The Heartbreaker\" Figueroa of Weslaco looked impressive in his featherweight debut. Following his very controversial loss to Stephen Fulton last November. He showed no ring rust in taking apart and handing Carlos Castro his second consecutive loss. After a feeling-out process in the first round, Figueroa got to work in the second and dropped Castro in the third with a left hook. The Rio Grande Valley native hit the gas and kept pouring on the punches and nearly getting the stoppage. Castro survived the round and tried to avoid the hard-hitting south Texan. However, by the sixth round southpaw's relentlessness paid off and he was able to turn his opponent around force him into the ropes, and unleashed a barrage of thudding and pin point accurate body shots that left Castro defenseless in the corner and forced the referee to stop the fight at the 2:11 mark of the sixth round. Figueroa moved his record to 23-1-1 (18). The bout was a WBC eliminator, placing the 25-year-old Figueroa, in a position to challenge newly minted champ Rey Vargas for the WBC featherweight strap and become a two-division world champion.\n\nAlso on the card was surging bantamweight prospect Ramon Cardenas of San Antonio fought in his hometown for the first time since taking a unanimous decision over Ramsey Luna in 2018. He boxed beautifully in a 10-round affair earning a unanimous decision over Michell Baanquez of Venezuela. The Alamo City native was able to fight off the pressure and nail. After a fairly even opening three rounds, Cardenas caught Baanquez with a left hook that wobbled him. He was able to counter his man brilliantly throughout the middle rounds. Stabbing him with the jab, avoiding the Venezuelan heavy artillery, and countering him with hooks and straight rights. Cardenas, like the consummate professional he is, closed the show out in impressive fashion, scoring with a left hook with just over 40 seconds in the bout that again buzzed his opponent to close the show. On his way to earning a unanimous decision victory by scores of 97-93x2 and 96-94. It was Cardenas's first fight with San Antonio-based trainer Chato Martinez. The two seemed to work well together and have a bright future.\n\nAlso on the card was highly touted prospect \"X-man\" Xavier Bocanegra hails from Donna in the Rio Grande Valley. The Blue chip prospect battered and outclassed an over-matched opponent by the name of Travis Crawford. The RGV native badly wobbled Crawford with a pair of left hooks and then jumped on his stunned opponent and unleashed a barrage of power shots that forced the referee to call a halt to the action at the 2;27 mark of round three. Giving Bocanegra his first stoppage victory and moving his record to 2-0 (1)\n\nFellow Rio Grande Valley native Fabian Diaz of Edinburg made his pro debut a successful one. Earning a unanimous decision and winning a clear-cut but hard-earned decision over Julio Gomez of Mexico, a very game and durable opponent. Making the young Diaz dig a bit in his pro debut.\n\nHometown slugger Raymond \"Tito\" Guajardo was also on the card and ended an over 2-year-layoff. He had to settle for a disputed draw in his comeback fight. Most thought Guajardo had done enough, but the judges disagreed and declared the bout a draw. Guajardo's record moved to 5-1-1 (4).\n\nCarrizo Springs is a town of about 5,000 located 45 miles north of the Mexican border just over an hour's drive from Laredo. If you have not heard of it, you're about to. It's the home of Giancarlo Rodriguez. Rodriguez scored a unanimous decision points victory to secure a spot in the finals of the USA Boxing National Championships in the finals of the 110-pound junior division. Scoring with a second-round counter left hand from the southpaw dropped his opponent Jallen Young of Tampa Florida. The South Texan remained very active on his toes firing combinations from the outside and then getting on the inside in a fan-friendly style and unleashing with lightning-quick combinations on the inside. The victorious South Texan calls his style Mexican-Style. Young down on all cards after two came out storming and the two combatants exchanged heated shots on the inside throughout a fan-friendly third round. It was not enough tho as Rodriguez rolled to a wide points decision. He will fight Ra-leek born in the finals who defeated Jose Artiga of Houston Texas in the semi-finals.\n\nMoises Rodriguez of El Paso moves to Finals kicks off the day strong for Texas in the opening bout in ring 3 dominating Yedrian Otero of Kissimme FL. Working his body and breaking him down with a consistent left hook to the body that kept finding its mark. The bodywork took its toll as Otero, clearly down on points, stepped up the aggression and started walking into more power shots that caused an eight-count and sealed the deal for Rodriguez who moves onto tomorrows finals .\n\nIn what was a break through performance for Rio Grande Valley antive Fabian Diaz he dominated and outclassed Khallq Harrison of Washington DC on his way to a uniamous decision victory and earning a trip to the fianls of the 139 pound youth division tomorrow in Shreveport. He used a thudding jab and mixed in straight hand to perfection forcing Harrison backwards and into the ropes. Diaz, clearly the stronger man, kept the pressure on and kept landing. Harrison, apparently didn't like the taste of Diaz's power and never got aggressive or picked up the pace allowing Diaz to fight his fight and roll to the clear points victory.\n\nIn the 156-pound youth division semi-finals there was an all-Texas shootout between two national champions fighting in a new weight class. As RGV native Sebastian Juarez of Brownsville and DFW Joseph Almajdi of Fort Worth battled it out in a very high-speed chess match. It was Almadji’s jab that carried the day. Landing from long range he was able to keep Juarez coming up short and was able to avoid much of his combinations. Having dropped the first two rounds across the board Juarez picked up the pace and got going landing thudding right hands and precise combinations. He carried the final round on 4 of the 5 cards but it was not enough. As the DFW fighter earned the nod in this all-Texas shootout.\n\nThe following is a list of other semifinal winners from Texas:\n\nRene Camacho Houston W Yu'shore Williams\n\nJayShawn Wallace Dallas W Yahsin Arrington\n\nJose Artiga Hoston W Ra-Leek Born\n\nGiancarlo Rodriguez Carrizo Springs W Jallen Young\n\nDavid Lona Kyle W Yahir Diaz Martinez\n\nDavid Cardenas San Antonio W Terry Washington\n\nJesus Martinez Del Rio W Troy Nah\n\nFabian Diaz Edinburg W Khallq Harrison\n\nJoseph Almadji Fort Worth W Sebastian Juarez Brownsville\n\nJaycob Ramos Plano W Jeremy Ortiz\n\nRichard Fernandez San Antonio W Jordan Roach\n\nEmilio Garcia Laredo W Deric Davis\n\nGerardo Favila Weslaco W Jayden Jr"
