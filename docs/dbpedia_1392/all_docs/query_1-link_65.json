        "text": "ProBox TV’s Wednesday Night Fights is back again next week fresh off a big result for Otar Eranosyan, who overcame a knockdown to take out former world champion Roger Gutierrez last week in Plant City to claim the WBA mandatory position for Hector Luis Garcia’s world title.\n\nAugust 23 sees the midweek promotion return with an undefeated 10 round clash at super welterweight. Dominican Raul Garcia will collide with Mexican born Leonardo Ruiz in the evening’s main event in Plant City, Florida.\n\nGarcia (13-0-1, 11 KOs) comes off an impressive 2nd round knockout victory over Angel Yomar Mateo Arias in his native Dominican Republic just six weeks ago. The bout with Ruiz marks his second fight in the US having shared the spoils with the undefeated Robert Terry in a split decision draw in California this past April. Ruiz (12-0, 8 KOs) also comes off a stoppage victory, picking up a 5th round knockout against Esau Herrera de la Cruz in Pomona four months ago.\n\nThe evening’s chief support will see ProBox TV new signing Justin Pauldo collide with Uruguayan Eduardo Estela over 10 rounds in the lightweight division.\n\nPauldo (15-1, 7 KOs) is undefeated in 8 years, signing with ProBox TV two months ago under manager Jolene Mizzone. The 28 year old American comes off a unanimous decision win over Yeifer Valencia in Atlantic City last November having previously defeated Josec Ruiz by the same method in Los Angeles.\n\nEstela (14-2, 9 KOs) looks to get back to winning ways after a 7th round knockout defeat to Angel Fierro in Mexico five months ago. The 33 year old from Montevideo had previously gone four fights unbeaten, the last of those victories coming against the undefeated Ruben Torres in Carson, California.\n\nThe televised undercard will also see Venezuelan knockout artist Johan Gonzalez (32-2, 32 KOs) take on Luis Eduardo Florez (26-28, 21 KOs) at super welterweight over 8 rounds. De Von Williams(2-0, 2 KOs) locks horns with Jared Tallent (1-2) at welterweight to kick off the televised card.\n\nYou can watch Wednesday Night Fights for free on YouTube and FaceBook in both English and Spanish."
