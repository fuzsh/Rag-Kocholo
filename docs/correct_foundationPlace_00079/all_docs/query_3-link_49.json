        "text": "Monday\n\nMonday’s structured discussions create a path for the sprint week. In the morning, you’ll start at the end and agree to a long-term goal. Next, you’ll make a map of the challenge. In the afternoon, you’ll ask the experts at your company to share what they know. Finally, you’ll pick a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week.\n\nMonday video with Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky YouTube\n\nChecklist for Monday GV Library\n\nTuesday\n\nAfter a full day of understanding the problem and choosing a target for your sprint, on Tuesday, you get to focus on solutions. The day starts with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to remix and improve. Then, in the afternoon, each person will sketch, following a four-step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry. You’ll also begin planning Friday’s customer test by recruiting customers that fit your target profile.\n\nTuesday video with Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky YouTube\n\nChecklist for Tuesday GV Library\n\nStart recruiting customers for test GV Library\n\nWednesday\n\nBy Wednesday morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions. That’s great, but it’s also a problem. You can’t prototype and test them all—you need one solid plan. In the morning, you’ll critique each solution, and decide which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. Then, in the afternoon, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype.\n\nWednesday video with Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky YouTube\n\nChecklist for Wednesday GV Library\n\nSchedule customers and draft interview guide GV Library\n\nThursday\n\nOn Wednesday, you and your team created a storyboard. On Thursday, you’ll adopt a “fake it” philosophy to turn that storyboard into a prototype. A realistic façade is all you need to test with customers, and here’s the best part: by focusing on the customer-facing surface of your product or service, you can finish your prototype in just one day. On Thursday, you’ll also make sure everything is ready for Friday’s test by confirming the schedule, reviewing the prototype, and writing an interview script.\n\nThursday video with Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky YouTube\n\nChecklist for Thursday GV Library\n\nFinalize test schedule and complete interview guide GV Library\n\nFriday\n\nYour sprint began with a big challenge, an excellent team—and not much else. By Friday, you’ve created promising solutions, chosen the best, and built a realistic prototype. That alone would make for an impressively productive week. But you’ll take it one step further as you interview customers and learn by watching them react to your prototype. This test makes the entire sprint worthwhile: At the end of the day, you’ll know how far you have to go, and you’ll know just what to do next.\n\nFriday video with Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky YouTube\n\nChecklist for Friday GV Library\n\nInterview customers and summarize findings GV Library\n\nThe Five-Act Interview with Michael Margolis YouTube\n\nThe Sprint book\n\n“Read this book and do what it says if you want to build better products faster.” —Ev Williams, founder of Medium and Twitter\n\nNew York Times best seller Sprint takes you behind the scenes with some of America’s most fascinating startups. You’ll meet a robotics maker searching for the perfect robot personality, a coffee roaster expanding to new markets, a company organizing the world’s cancer data, and Slack, the fastest-growing business app in history.\n\nA practical guide to answering critical business questions, Sprint is a book for teams of any size, from small startups to Fortune 100s, from teachers to nonprofits. It’s for anyone with a big opportunity, problem, or idea who needs to get answers now.\n\nBuy on Amazon"
