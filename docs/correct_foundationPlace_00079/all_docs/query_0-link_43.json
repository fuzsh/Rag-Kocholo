Definition of Open Source Software (OSS): Open source software refers to software that is developed, tested, or improved through public collaboration and distributed with the idea that the must be shared with others, ensuring an open future collaboration. The collaborative experience of many developers, especially those in the academic environment, in developing various versions of the UNIX operating system, Richard Stallman's idea of Free Software Foundation, and the desire of users to freely choose among a number of products - all of these led to the Open Source movement and the approach to developing and distributing programs as open source software.",

Analyzing such so-called big data is today a keystone of competition and the success of organizations depends on fast and well-founded decisions taken by relevant people in their specific area of responsibility. Business analytics (BA) represents a merger between data strategy and a collection of decision support technologies and mechanisms for enterprises aimed at enabling knowledge workers such as executives, managers, and analysts to make better and faster decisions. The authors review the concept of BA as an open innovation strategy and address the importance of BA in revolutionizing knowledge towards economics and business sustainability. Using big data with open source business analytics systems generates the greatest opportunities to increase competitiveness and differentiation in organizations. In this chapter, the authors describe and analyze business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and four popular open source systems – BIRT, Jaspersoft, Pentaho, and SpagoBI."
