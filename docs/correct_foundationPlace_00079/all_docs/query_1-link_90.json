        "text": "The Linux Foundation recently published a recap of the Embedded Open Source Summit 2023 which took place in Prague back in June:\n\nEmbedded Open Source Summit, a new umbrella event for open source embedded projects and developer communities, came together for essential collaboration, discussions, and education. EOSS was composed of 6 micro conferences including Embedded Linux Conference, Zephyr Developer Summit, Automotive Linux Summit Europe, Embedded IoT Summit, Safety-Critical Software Summit, and LF Energy Embedded Summit.\n\nThe event gathered 1,387 total attendees with 844 attending in person in Prague, from 375 organizations across 56 countries around the globe. 83% of attendees were in technical positions.\n\nThe event included over 180 talks across the 6 micro conferences that made up the event.\n\nWe are proud to see that BayLibre engineer Bernhard (“bero”) Rosenkränzer was listed in the Top 10 Attended Sessions. You can watch the recording of his talk online:\n\nToolchain Options in 2023: What’s New in Compilers and Libcs? (slides)\n\nAll the talks from EOSS are available in a playlist on the Linux Foundation YouTube channel.\n\nIncluded in the playlist is the “RISC-V and Open Source Hardware BoF” (slides) by BayLibre engineer Drew Fustini:\n\nNote: “BoF” stands for “Birds of a Feather” which is short presentation followed by a discussion amongst the people in the room"
