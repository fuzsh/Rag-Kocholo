We also highly recommend that speakers take our online Inclusive Speaker Orientation Course.\n\nPanel submissions must include the names of all participants in the initial submission to be considered. In addition, The Linux Foundation does not accept submissions with all-male panels in an effort to increase speaker diversity.\n\nComplimentary Passes For Speakers – One complimentary pass for the event will be provided for the accepted speaker(s) per submission.\n\nAvoid sales or marketing pitches and discussing unlicensed or potentially closed-source technologies when preparing your proposal; these talks are almost always rejected due to the fact that they take away from the integrity of our events, and are rarely well-received by conference attendees.\n\nAll accepted speakers are required to submit their slides prior to the event.\n\npreparing to submit your proposal\n\nWhile it is not our intention to provide you with strict instructions on how to prepare your proposal, we hope you will take a moment to review the following guidelines that we have put together to help you prepare the best submission possible. To get started, here are three things that you should consider before submitting your proposal:\n\nWhat are you hoping to get from your presentation?\n\nWhat do you expect the audience to gain from your presentation?\n\nHow will your presentation help better the ecosystem?\n\nThere are plenty of ways to give a presentation about projects and technologies without focusing on company-specific efforts. Remember the things to consider that we mentioned above when writing your proposal and think of ways to make it interesting for attendees while still letting you share your experiences, educate the community about an issue, or generate interest in a project.\n\nHow to Give a Great Talk\n\nWe want to make sure submitters receive resources to help put together a great submission and if accepted, give the best presentation possible. To help do this, we recommend viewing seasoned speaker Dawn Foster’s in-depth session titled Overcoming Imposter Syndrome to Become a Conference Speaker!.\n\nHave More Questions? First Time Submitting? Don’t Feel Intimidated\n\nLinux Foundation events are an excellent way to get to know the community and share your ideas and the work that you are doing and we strongly encourage first-time speakers to submit talks for our events. In the instance that you aren’t sure about your abstract, reach out to us and we will be more than happy to work with you on your proposal.\n\ncode of conduct\n\nThe Linux Foundation is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our events. We encourage all submitters to review our complete Code of Conduct."
