        "text": "The following teaching methodologies are used in this curricular unit:\n\n1. Expository method: explanatory method where theoretical foundations and concepts are presented by the teacher and discussed with the class. Concepts and information will be presented to students through, for example, slide presentations or oral discussions. It will be used in classes to structure and outline the information.\n\n2. Demonstrative method: based on the example given by the teacher of a technical or practical operation that one wishes to be learned. It focuses on how a given operation is carried out, highlighting the most appropriate techniques, tools and equipment. It will be used, for example, in practical and laboratory classes.\n\n3. Interrogative method: process based on verbal interactions, under the direction of the teacher, adopting the format of questions and answers. It allows for greater dynamics in the classroom and consolidates learning. It will be used, for example, to remember elements of previous classes and in revisions of the lectured content.\n\n4. Active methods: pedagogical techniques will be used in which the student is the center of the learning process, being an active participant and involved in his own training. The teacher assumes the role of facilitator, stimulating critical thinking, collaboration, creativity and student autonomy. They will be applied in classes to achieve a dynamic and more lasting learning environment.\n\nEach class will consist of two moments:\n\n1. Introductory presentation: At the beginning of the class, the teacher exposes and discusses the new contents under study with the students;"
