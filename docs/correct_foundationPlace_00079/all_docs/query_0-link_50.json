He added that \"the most recent number that gives us purpose and energy is that the processes developed by our scientists and the products manufactured in our factories have cured four million hepatitis C patients. Doing the right thing is what moves us\".\n\nHovione exports all of its production to 34 countries and its turnover was 150 million euros in 2019, plus 7.5%, and has almost 1,300 employees in Portugal.

Our customers are the most innovative companies in the world and the markets are the most highly regulated \", concluded Guy Villax.\n\nIt is the private company with more PhDs, more than a hundred, so Guy Villax underlines that \"a large part of our success is due to the quality of young people who are trained in our universities. For the future, the path is always the same, it has to do with innovation, quality, service and working hard to leave the competition behind \".\n\nHovione companies are owned equally by the second-generation shareholders, brothers Peter, Guy, Sofia and Miguel.

But as Critical Software's philosophy has always been, we must always be attentive to changes and be very agile and flexible in this adaptation. We have been able to respond to this challenge and continue for many more years and with a growth rate that has been usual at Critical Software, which is in the double digits \", stated Mónica Sobreira.\n\nExportation\n\nLarge Companies-Tradable Goods\n\nSimoldes Plásticos Winner\n\nAt the forefront of the automobile industry\n\nCreated in 1980, Simoldes Plásticos (plastics) was born from the plastics division of the Simoldes Group, based in Oliveira de Azeméis, which was founded in 1959 with the constitution of Simoldes Aços (steel), a company dedicated to the manufacture of injection moulds for the plastics industry.

There is a geological resource in Portugal with much superior quality even to the resources of marbles such as the Italians \".\n\nThe stone business started with Francisco dos Santos \"Canteiro\", but it was his son Manuel Rodrigues dos Santos who, in 1962, launched himself into the activity on an individual basis, in the manual extraction of blocks, to later evolve the extraction processes of the ornamental stone, in a continuous way, perfecting the knowledge of the subsoil and geology of the region.\n\nExportation\n\nLarge Exporting Company Services\n\nThe Navigator Company Winner\n\nThe roles of a major exporter\n\nAt its origin is Companhia Portuguesa de Celulose (Cellulose Portuguese Company), created in 1941 and having its eureka moment in 1957, when in Cacia it became the first factory in the world, outside Australia, to produce eucalyptus kraft pulp and became a world standard.

We believe that at a time when the world is undergoing unprecedented transformations and is looking for new models of sustainable development and shorter supply chains, Portugal has a unique opportunity to develop a growth and valorisation strategy for its forest\".\n\nInternationalization\n\nLarge Companies\n\nMota-Engil winner\n\nPortuguese-Chinese alliance in construction\n\nÉ o principal grupo de construção e engenharia português, que nasceu em 1947 quando Manuel Mota criou a Mota & Companhia para explorar as florestas de Cabinda em Angola.

It has the leadership in Portugal, it is one of the 30 largest European construction groups, present in 28 countries, spread over three geographical areas Europe, Africa and Latin America. \"It is a learning process with risks that have to be combated with a lot of organization, discipline, resilience and determination\", revealed Gonçalo Moura Martins, CEO of Mota-Engil.\n\nThe main shareholder, the Moat family, has entered into a strategic and investment partnership agreement with China Communications Construction Company (ACPC), which will retain about 30% of Mota-Engil, and brothers António, Manuela, Teresa and Paula Mota download the 66.39% stake to 40%.\n\nSpecial Jury Award\n\nVista Alegre Atlantis winner\n\nThe ways of the globalization of the Vista Alegre\n\n“To transform the Vista Alegre mark into a global mark in a segment of sufficient requirement, that is of the excellency and the luxury, it is a daily battle in mature markets, in diversified markets”, said Nuno Barra, administrator of the Vista Alegre Atlantis.\n\nIs a group of ceramics, crystal and glass, that it produces parts in porcelain, stoneware, faiança, crystal and glass that origin in the Porcelain Plant has of the Vista Alegre, established in 1824, the first dedicated industrial unit to the production of the porcelain in Portugal, that in 2001 merged with the Atlantis, that is born as Crisal in 1972 to manufacture crystal parts.\n\nIn 2009, it became part of the Visabeira Group's brand portfolio and had a turnover in 2019 of 120 million euros, 74% of exports, which grew 8.4%, profits of more than seven million euros, and counts on almost 2,500 employees.\n\nAs Nuno Barra says, \"the internationalization process is always a very challenging process, especially for a company that is in more than 70 countries and exports to 116 countries\".\n\nIn his opinion, the strategy must be clear whether it allows for a well-established focus and which, on a daily basis, allows to overcome some difficulties and to add a lot of resilience. \"For the future, it is expected to enter more markets because the objective is to globalize the Vista Alegre brand and as a market focus, in addition to those that are a priority today, the brand will concentrate efforts in markets such as Mexico, India, Germany and United Kingdom \", concluded Nuno Barra."
