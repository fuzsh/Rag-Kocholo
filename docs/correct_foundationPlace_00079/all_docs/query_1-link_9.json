        "text": "What you could be doing during your work placement\n\nYou will get involved in all phases of the development cycle (requirements, design, implementation, test), with an emphasis on the design of software-intensive systems. You will investigate new technologies and methodologies to help maintain Critical’s position as an innovator in the field of high integrity systems, as well as performing system administration tasks (e.g. web server configuration, Wiki administration, configuration control maintenance), producing accurate project documents to a high quality and communicating results with a high degree of accuracy and attention to detail.\n\nMeet one of our Apprentices\n\nName:\n\nDan\n\nJob Title:\n\nFormer Critical Software Apprentice\n\nWhen I left college, I knew that I wanted to become a Software Engineer. Originally, I had planned to head off to university and, although I had briefly considered being an intern or an apprentice, I hadn’t come across an opportunity that really interested me. When I discovered the intern and apprenticeship schemes at Critical Software, I was impressed and excited. I knew immediately that I wanted to work there!\n\nFor me, internships and apprenticeships represent a great way of getting a good job in an industry without going to university and building up a huge amount of student debt. Getting a formal degree whilst doing an apprenticeship is a brilliant opportunity, which offers someone a competitive-edge when applying for jobs.\n\nI loved the complex, varied projects that I got to be part of on a daily basis. Moving between projects meant I was continuously learning about new technologies. I learned so many new skills during my time at Critical. Anytime I needed assistance, I could always count on support from my colleagues, even if I didn’t work directly with them. This is one reason why Critical is a great company: the company as a whole was committed to my development. If there’s an issue, the company worked with me to try to fix things. I’ve also made a lot of good friends during my time at Critical.\n\nMy apprenticeship has empowered me – learning through doing in such a safe space full of experts has been enlightening."
