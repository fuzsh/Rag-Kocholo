        "text": "What is an IT Support or Help Desk Certification?\n\nIT support certifications and help desk certifications are recognized acknowledgements of specific experience, knowledge, and skills relating to IT technologies and services. They are often critical to career advancement and can make all the difference for an entry-level help desk professional who is looking to distinguish themselves from the competition. According to a CompTIA study, 91% of employers believe IT certifications both play a key role in the hiring process and act as a reliable predictor of a successful employee.\n\nOnce in the IT support help desk profession, IT support desk certifications can help with career advancement. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median salary is $57,910 per year, or $27.84 per hour. More specifically, the median annual wage for a computer network specialist was $62,760 in May 2021, and for computer user technical desk specialists in May of 2021 was $49,770.\n\nTypically, education requirements for a computer support specialist include an associateâs degree, while user support specialists require some college courses. More technical positions may require a degree in a certain field, such as computer and information technology or engineering. However, relevant IT support desk certifications can often act as an alternative, particularly when combined with in-field experience, allowing even those with just a high school diploma to achieve the same or more career success with the relevant information technology (IT) certifications. It is important to note, however, that the nature of technology requires ITSM professionals to continue to obtain new certs and recertify to maintain their knowledge and skills through the continuous innovations and changes of the technologies they work with.\n\nWhether you are looking to start or ârebootâ your IT career, or to simply stay up to date on the skills and knowledge needed to work with the ever-changing technologies, security considerations, and best-practices of the profession, it is important that you accrue the Information Technology (IT) certs that are most likely to have the biggest impact on your organizationâand your career.\n\nThis blog discusses the top ten recommended IT support certifications, along with a few insights on why they are so impactful.\n\n1. Microsoft Certifications\n\nMicrosoft certifications train and affirm the technical skills required to perform Microsoft technology-related positions within an organization. They are some of the most critical certs for IT support professionals to get simply because of the prevalence of Microsoft in the office. According to Microsoftâs latest By The Numbers report, there are more than 1.4 billion monthly active devices running Windows 10 or 11 around the world. Office 365 usage statistics reveal that the Microsoft 365 service is the most widely used cloud service by user count and market share on Windows and Mac, with 70% of Fortune 500 companies purchasing Office 365 in the past 12 months. The same report revealed that one in five corporate employees uses a version of Office cloud service. Microsoftâs Total Economic ImpactTM 2020 study, âThe Revenue And Growth Opportunities For Microsoft Azure Partners,â commissioned and conducted by Forrester Consulting, revealed that there are over 145 million daily active Microsoft Teams users, over 250,000 organizations using Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform, and over 95 percent of Fortune 500 companies are using Azure.\n\nWhich Microsoft certifications should you choose?\n\nMicrosoft offers more than 250 certifications for different levels of expertise, but some of the most popular Microsoft certification courses to participate in include:\n\nMicrosoft 365 Certified: Modern Desktop Administrator Associate\n\nMicrosoft Certified Solutions Expert\n\nMTA IT\n\nMicrosoft Certified IT Professional\n\nHow do you gain Microsoft certifications?\n\nMicrosoft certifications are exam-based certifications. There are different levels of certifications that correspond to levels of expertise, and the certifications may need to be earned in sequential order.

CISSP was one of the original certifications included in the DoD Directive 8570.1m, which was implemented to ensure cybersecurity professionals developed a baseline understanding of the fundamental cybersecurity principles and practices. It remains the dominant certification used/obtained for those in numerous cybersecurity positions. According to the Global Knowledge 2020 IT Skills and Salary Report, it is listed as the second most common cert being pursued by IT professionals who are seeking to advance their careers.\n\nThe (ISC)2 2021 Cybersecurity Workforce Study reveals that, as of 2021, there are over 142,000 CISSP-certified individuals in over 170 countries, and those who hold the CISSP certification are employed at Fortune 500 companies, governments, small businesses, start-ups, and many operate as independent contractors.\n\nHow do you gain the CISSP certification?\n\nThe process for gaining the CISSP certification requires both an exam and an experience component:\n\nThe professional must first gain sufficient experience in the field of cybersecurity and IT security management\n\nThese experience requirements must be verified by others in the industry who hold CISSP\n\nThe professional must pass the CISSP exam\n\nOnce the CISSP certification is obtained, the professional must continue to accumulate experience and continuing professional education credits (CPEs) every year.\n\n3.
