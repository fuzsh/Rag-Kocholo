        "text": "CIS Controls® at a Glance\n\nThe CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls) are a prescriptive, prioritized, and simplified set of best practices that you can use to strengthen your cybersecurity posture. Today, thousands of cybersecurity practitioners from around the world use the CIS Controls and/or contribute to their development via a community consensus process.\n\nWatch video\n\nWith the CIS Controls, You Can...\n\nSimplify Your Approach to Threat Protection\n\nThe CIS Controls consist of Safeguards that each require you to do one thing. This simplified cybersecurity approach is proven to help you defend against today's top threats. Learn more in our CIS Community Defense Model v2.0.\n\nComply with Industry Regulations\n\nBy implementing the CIS Controls, you create an on-ramp to comply with PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and other industry regulations. View our Mapping and Compliance page for more information.\n\nAchieve Essential Cyber Hygiene\n\nAlmost all successful cyber attacks exploit “poor cyber hygiene” like unpatched software, poor configuration management, and outdated solutions. The CIS Controls include foundational security measures that you can use to achieve essential hygiene and protect yourself against a cyber attack.\n\nTranslate Information into Action\n\nModern systems and software are dynamic in nature. By enacting the CIS Controls, you support your assets' evolving needs in a meaningful way and align your security efforts with your business goals.\n\nAbide by the Law\n\nMultiple U.S. States require executive branch agencies and other government entities to implement cybersecurity best practices. Several of them specifically mention the CIS Controls as a way of demonstrating a \"reasonable\" level of security.\n\nThe 18 Top-Level CIS Controls\n\nThe CIS Controls consist of 18 overarching measures that help strengthen your cybersecurity posture. They prioritize activities over roles and device ownership. That way, you can implement the CIS Controls in a way that works for you.\n\nExplore the CIS Controls\n\nNarrow Your Focus with the Safeguards\n\nFormerly known as \"Sub-Controls,\" the Safeguards are specific and unique actions that guide the logic of the 18 top-level CIS Controls. Each Safeguard defines measurement as part of the process and requires minimal interpretation to implement.\n\nLet the Implementation Groups Guide Your Efforts\n\nThe Implementation Groups (IGs) help you prioritize your implementation of the CIS Controls and Safeguards. You can begin with Implementation Group 1 (IG1). The definition of essential cyber hygiene, IG1 represents an emerging minimum standard of information security and of protection against common attacks for all. IG2 and IG3 build on the foundation laid by IG1.\n\nLearn More\n\nCIS Controls Free Resources\n\nFrom mappings to companion guides, policy templates, and more, you have everything you need to make the most of the CIS Controls. And it doesn't cost a cent to use them.\n\nDiscover Your Options Today\n\nCIS Controls Navigator\n\nWant to see how the CIS Controls fit into your broader security program? You can use our CIS Controls Navigator to see how they map to other security standards.\n\nAccess Our Tool Now\n\nCIS Critical Security Controls Ambassadors\n\nOur Ambassadors represent, speak for, volunteer on, and promote the CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls), supporting resources, and tools.\n\nMeet Our Ambassadors"
