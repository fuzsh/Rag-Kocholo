        "text": "The 5th International IEEE Workshop on Software Certification (WoSoCer 2015)\n\nNovember 2-5, 2015, Washington DC, USA\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nCo-located with a top conference: the 26th IEEE Symp. on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2015)\n\nSpecial theme of this edition: the certification of cloud computing services and infrastructures\n\nA journal special issue for extended, high-quality papers on Reliability Engineering & System Safety, a high-impact Elsevier journal\n\nFor more information, visit: http://www.mobilab.unina.it/wosocer2015\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSoftware is pervasive in our society, and certifying reliability and safety of software-intensive systems has become an important problem and a hot research area. In fact, the scope of software is widening more and more in many critical domains such as avionics, space, railway, automotive, nuclear, medical, and air traffic control. However, the certification of software-intensive systems is still challenging, due to several technical limitations in software development and verification that affect our ability to achieve sufficient confidence. These issues are today exacerbated by the increasing complexity of software (in terms of amount, depth, interactions, coupling, and criticality of functions implemented by the software) and the emergence of new technologies, development practices, applications, and threats. Moreover, assessing the safety of modern systems often requires significant effort and costs, leading to conflicts of interest between the public (as represented by certification authorities), whose aim is to ensure reliability and safety, and commercial manufacturers, who strive for minimizing legal responsibility and for reducing costs: suffices to think of the limited use in industry of even the most basic formal techniques for software verification. As a result, several industry-driven initiatives and standards, such as the ISO 26262, are currently facing these issues.\n\nThe Workshop series on Software Certification (WoSoCer) has been recently established to address these challenges. It aims to provide novel solutions applicable for complex and critical software, and to promote their adoption in real-world systems through industrial and academic research projects. Since its inception in 2011, four editions of the WoSoCer workshop have been held in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE), which is the premier conference on the theory and practice of software reliability, featuring both a strong research and an equally strong industry participation; a fifth edition of the workshop is currently under organization. WoSoCer has been a forum for researchers (from academia and industry), practitioners, companies, domain experts, and regulatory authorities interested in investigating and discussing novel solutions for the certification of software-intensive systems.\n\nIn addition to the traditional topics on the certification of safety-critical systems, this edition of the workshop will feature the following special theme: the certification of cloud computing services and infrastructures. This theme is of high-priority for both cloud providers and users, who are concerned with emerging security and privacy aspects of services and data.\n\nThe workshop will be held with the 26th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2015), and will take place in November 2-5 in Washington DC, USA, at the premises of the NIST, a US national organization that is leading the standardization of cloud computing technologies.\n\nThe website of the workshop is located at: http://www.mobilab.unina.it/wosocer2015\n\nTOPICS\n\nWe welcome contributions related (but not limited to) the following topics:\n\nCertification of cloud computing services and infrastructures (special theme of WoSoCer 2015)\n\nQuantitative and qualitative evaluation of system dependability and resilience\n\nCertification and assurance of systems and services\n\nCertification of software for emerging technological trends, including dynamic, autonomic, large-scale, and distributed systems\n\nCertification of third-party components, software reuse and open-source software across systems and services\n\nCertification and best practices of software development processes in safety- and security-critical domains\n\nEconomics of certification and standards\n\nAdoption of emerging technologies and best-practices in safety- and security-critical domains\n\nOpen issues, practical experiences and real-world case studies\n\nCross-fertilization between safety and security certification and standards\n\nAccepted peer-reviewed papers (between 6 and 8 pages) will be included in a supplemental volume of the ISSRE conference proceedings, and published by the IEEE Computer Society on IEEE Xplore.\n\nJOURNAL SPECIAL ISSUE\n\nA journal special issue of the workshop has been planned on Reliability Engineering & System Safety, a high-impact Elsevier journal (http://www.journals.elsevier.com/reliability-engineering-and-system-safety/)\n\nThe authors of the best WoSoCer papers will be invited to submit a significantly extended (at least by 30%) version of their work. Extended papers will undergo a full peer-review process to assure the quality and the originality of the research. Invited papers will be selected on the basis of the novelty of the proposed contributions, the technical and methodological rigor, and the practical impact and relevance of case studies and results for both the research and the industrial communities.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nPaper submission: August 14th, 2015\n\nPaper notification: September 4th, 2015\n\nCamera-ready: September 15th, 2015\n\nABOUT THE SPECIAL THEME\n\nThe cloud computing paradigm is today the foundation of IT systems in business-critical domains, such as banking, e-commerce, and telecommunication. However, cloud computing has also raised concerns among cloud users about security and privacy, since services and data are now deployed in remote cloud computing infrastructures managed by third-party organizations, making more difficult for customers to select a cloud computing solution that fits their needs. Therefore, the certification of cloud services and infrastructures has become a high-priority issue for service providers and the user community, as demonstrated by recent initiatives on cloud computing standards, such as the NIST Cloud Computing Program, the ENISA Cloud Security and Resilience initiative, the ISO/IEC 27018, and the Open Data Center Alliance.\n\nORGANIZING COMMITTEES\n\nProgram Co-Chairs:\n\nMassimo Felici, HP Labs, UK\n\nBarbara Gallina, Malardalen University, Sweden\n\nTechnical Program Committee:\n\nHoma Alemzadeh, University of Illinois, USA\n\nNuno Antunes, University of Coimbra, Portugal\n\nDomenico Cotroneo, Federico II U. of Naples, Italy\n\nAlec Dorling, Impronova, Sweden\n\nSigrid Eldh, Ericsson AB/Karlstad Univ., Sweden\n\nMarc Forster, RWTH, Germany\n\nIbrahim Habli, University of York, UK\n\nFuqun Huang, Ohio State University, USA\n\nPhilip Koopman, Carnegie Mellon University, USA\n\nMark Lawford, McMaster University, Canada\n\nMikael Lindvall, Fraunhofer CESE, USA\n\nIslam Mafijul, Volvo Adv.
