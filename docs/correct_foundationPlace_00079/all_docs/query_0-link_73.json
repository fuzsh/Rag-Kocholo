Here’s a table tailored just for you. It provides a detailed snapshot view of everything you will read at length in the blog post.\n\nWhy Study in Portugal?\n\nDid you know that 17% of the total enrollment of students who study in Portugal are international students? This impressive statistic highlights Portugal’s growing popularity as a top study destination.\n\nHere are some noteworthy reasons why you should study in this country. Have a look.\n\nAffordable Tuition Fees: Portugal offers some of Europe’s most affordable tuition fees. You can pursue high-quality education without breaking the bank, with many programs such as business administration, computer science and others costing under INR 1.3L (EUR 1.5k) per year.\n\nLow Cost of Living: The cost of living for Indian students in Portugal is relatively low compared to other Western European countries. Monthly expenses, excluding rent, range from INR 22k to INR 45k (250 to 500 EUR), making it easier for students to manage their finances.\n\nHere’s a quick cost comparison for you.\n\nHigh-Quality Education: Portugal is home to some of the world’s oldest and most prestigious universities, such as the University of Lisbon, the University of Porto, and the University of Coimbra. These institutions offer a wide range of programs taught by experienced faculty members.\n\nDiverse Course Options: Whether it’s an MBBS in Portugal for Indian students or a PhD in Portugal, the country has a program for you.\n\nRich Cultural Experience: Studying in Portugal is about more than just academics. It’s also about experiencing the spirited culture with events like Carnaval and the Santo António Festival. You’ll have the opportunity to immerse yourself in Portuguese history and traditions.\n\nEnglish-Taught Programs: Many universities in Portugal offer programs taught in English, making it easier for international students like you to adapt and succeed academically.\n\nScholarships and Financial Aid: Numerous scholarships are available for Indian students, including the Portuguese Government Scholarships, Erasmus Mundus Program, and others. These can reduce the cost of study in Portugal significantly.\n\nPost-Study Work Visas: Portugal provides post-study work visas that allow international graduates to stay and work in the country for up to one year after completing their studies. This gives you the chance to gain professional experience and establish your career. For example, in the tech industry, entry-level software engineers can earn between INR 22L to INR 31L (EUR 25k to 35k) per year.\n\nSafe and Welcoming Environment: Portugal is known for its friendly and welcoming people. The country is ranked as the 16th safest country in Europe, with a Safety Index of 68.8.
