        "text": "Listen on the go!\n\nDisaster is an understatement for any brand/organization/institution that has incurred losses due to an overtly minuscule but catastrophic software glitch. While technology and innovative applications have empowered brands, enterprises have recorded numerous disabling instances.\n\nSoftware disasters have the potential to cause widespread disruptions and highlight the importance of rigorous testing and quality control measures in preventing catastrophic software failures.\n\nAny application’s unexpected crashes and data inconsistencies were a direct result of the failure in software testing, revealing significant gaps in the quality assurance process. In this run on top software failures of 2016 -2015-2014, we take stock of the debacles/glitches that have changed the face of software development and endorsed the role of testing in the overall SDLC process.\n\nTop Software Failures: Glitches and Debacles That Transformed Software Development\n\nBrands and enterprises across diverse industries witnessed software testing failures, and here is a list of software glitches/technical issues. Please note that the numbers 1-37 do not signify the high or low impact of the software glitch on the brand/enterprise.\n\nYahoo reports breach\n\nAmongst the most recent data breaches, on September 22, 2016, Yahoo confirmed a data breach that exposed about 500 million credentials that date back to four years. It is considered among the most significant credential leaks of 2016. The company believes this was a state-sponsored breach, where an individual on behalf of a government executed the entire hack. It further urged users to change their passwords and security questions. As a relief for the users, Yahoo stated that sensitive financial data like bank accounts and passwords was not stolen as part of the breach.\n\nSource: Money.cnn.com\n\nNest thermostat freeze\n\nA software update for the Nest ‘smart’ thermostat (owned by Google) went wrong and left users in the cold. The update forced the device’s batteries to drain, leading to a temperature drop. Consequently, customers could not heat their homes or use any amenities.\n\nNest claimed that the fault was due to a December 4.0 firmware update, with related issues such as old air filters or incompatible boilers. Later, it released a 4.0.1 software update that solved the problem for 99.5% of affected customers.\n\nSource: Cio-asia.com\n\nHSBC’s major IT outage\n\nA software update for the Nest ‘smart’ thermostat (owned by Google) went wrong and left users in the cold.

The software, introduced in 2002, was designed to monitor prisoners’ behavior. The problem occurred for about 13 years; on average, prisoners were released almost 49 days in advance.\n\nSource: Cio-asia.com\n\nHSBC payments glitch\n\nIn August 2015, HSBC failed to process about 275,000 individual payments, leaving many without pay before a long Bank Holiday weekend. This occurred due to a significant failure with the bank’s electronic payment system for its business banking users, affecting individual payments. Bacs, a payment system used for payment processes across the UK, later picked up on this issue, labeling it as an ‘isolated issue.’\n\nSource: Cio-asia.com\n\nBloomberg cancels debt issue\n\nIn April 2016, Bloomberg’s London office experienced a software glitch, with its trading terminals down for two hours. This occurred at an unfortunate time when the UK’s Debt Management Office (DMO) was about to auction a series of short-term Treasury bills. Later, in a statement, Bloomberg declared that the services were restored, and the glitch resulted from hardware and software failures in the network, resulting in excessive network traffic.\n\nSource: Cio-asia.com\n\nRBS payments failure\n\nAbout 6 lakh payments, including wages and benefits, failed to get through RBS’s accounts overnight in June 2015. The bank’s chief administrative officer stated it was a technology fault, but there was no further detail on the real cause.

The system is an online service for farmers to apply for Common Agricultural Policy payments from the EU. This online service, which was supposed to be up and running by May 2015, was delayed due to integration issues between the portal and the rules engine software. It was then not expected to be up even by 2016.\n\nSource: Computerworlduk.com\n\nCo-op Food’s double charges\n\nIn July 2015, Co-operative Food apologized to its customers and promised a refund within 24 hours. The reason was a ‘one-off technical glitch’ while processing the software that resulted in customers being charged twice.\n\nSource: Computerworlduk.com\n\nJohn Lewis\n\nRetailers often face mispricing due to system glitches, resulting in outlets offering customers excessively lucrative offers. John Lewis is a recent example: The online retailer witnessed a price glitch on its website that erroneously advertised hardware at software rates.\n\nSource: Money.aol.co.uk\n\nTesco iPad pricing disaster\n\nIn March 2012, Apple iPads worth £650 were priced at £49.99.

Eventually, the company decided to sell the Plasma TV sets at a lower price after it faced a customer petition. The online petition called ‘Marks & Spencer supply the TVs we paid for’ compelled M&S to honor the orders.\n\nSource: Thisismoney.co.uk\n\nReebok’s free trainers\n\nIn November 2013, Sports retailer Reebok trainers worth £100 were picked up for free from the online site, where customers were only charged for delivery. While the company did not honor the orders and apologized to the customers, they refunded the delivery charges and additionally gave 20% off on their next order. The pricing glitch went viral on Facebook and other sport and price deal forums, where shoppers rushed to grab £99.95 CrossFit Nano Speed footwear for just £8.50 postage.\n\nSource: Theguardian.com\n\nTennessee County kills System Update worth $1Million\n\nAfter investing two years of labor and $1 Million, Rutherford Country of Tennessee, US, called off a court software system update. The core reason was that the software glitches were identified right when the deal took place, and problems related to the issuance of checks, errors on circuit court dockets, and the creation of hidden charges came up in the weeks after it went Live.\n\nSource: 99tests.com\n\nSoftware Security Flaws Revealed in OLA’s Mobile App\n\nOla, India’s largest taxi aggregator, faced major security flaws within its system. The software bugs detected helped basic programmers enjoy unlimited free rides—at the expense of Ola and users. The issue went public when customers brought up the weaknesses in the system.

The company further indicated that there is a way to stop this remote access to email appliances.\n\nSource: Threatpost.com\n\nCisco Nexus Switches warning\n\nCisco again! In October 2016, Cisco Systems released several critical patches for its Nexus 7000-series switches and NX-OS software. Cisco’s Security Advisory declared that the Nexus 7000 and 7700 series switches were vulnerable to this glitch. The vulnerabilities declared allowed remote access to systems that could enable a hacker to execute code on targeted devices. Cisco further stated that this bug (CVE-2016-1453) results from “incomplete input validation performed on the size of overlay transport virtualization packet header parameters.”\n\nCyber Attack on Nuclear Power Plant\n\nIn October 2016, the head of an international nuclear energy consortium declared that disruption at a nuclear power plant during the last several years was caused by a ‘Cyber Attack.’ Yukiya Amano, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), didn’t discuss the matter much in detail but did alter the potential attacks in the future.\n\nThis shows that disruption in nuclear infrastructure due to a Cyber Attack is not a ‘Hollywood stint’!\n\nSource: Threatpost.com\n\nVolkswagen’s ‘Dieselgate’ scandal\n\nIn September 2015, the US government, in a dramatic move, ordered Volkswagen to recall about 500,000 cars after learning that the company had deployed advanced software to cheat emission tests and allowed its vehicles to produce 40 times more emissions than the decided limit. The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) accused VW of installing illegal ‘defeat device’ software that substantially reduces Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions only while undergoing emission tests. The company further admitted it and announced a recall as well.\n\nSource: Theguardian.com\n\nInterlogix Recalls Personal Panic Devices\n\nIn October 2016, Interlogix, a wireless personal panic devices manufacturer, recalled about 67000 devices due to its inability to operate during emergencies.
