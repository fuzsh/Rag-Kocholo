        "text": "Whether you‘re just starting out with content marketing or you’ve been using the same approach for a while, it never hurts to revisit your content strategy plan and make sure it's innovative and engaging for your prospects and customers.\n\nIf you're having trouble planning for the upcoming year or need some fresh ideas to include in your plan, read on.\n\nIn this post, we'll dive into what content strategy is, why your business needs a content marketing plan, and what steps you need to take to create your strategy.\n\nPlus, we'll explore some examples of effective content marketing strategies for inspiration.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is content strategy?\n\nWhy Marketers Need to Create a Content Marketing Strategy\n\nElements of a Content Strategy Plan\n\nWhat You Need to Create a Content Marketing Strategy\n\nHow to Create a Content Strategy Framework\n\nContent Marketing Strategy Statistics\n\nQuestions to Ask When Creating a Content Strategy\n\nContent Strategy Template\n\nContent Marketing Strategy Example\n\nContent Strategy Tactics\n\nSay your business goals include increasing brand awareness.\n\nTo achieve this, you might implement a content strategy that focuses on SEO to increase your website's visibility on the search engine results pages (SERPs) and drive traffic to your products or services.\n\nNew business owners might assume a content strategy is a nice-to-have, but not necessary early on. However, producing high-quality content can be invaluable in building trust with new audiences and succeeding in the long haul.\n\nIn essence, a good content strategy is the foundation of your Attract and Delight stages in a buyer's journey that follows the inbound marketing framework.\n\nAlong with attracting prospects to your brand, you can leverage a content strategy for sales enablement and customer satisfaction.\n\nPlus, with 70% of marketers actively investing in content marketing, it's critical to develop a good content strategy to compete in your industry.\n\nWhy Marketers Need to Create a Content Marketing Strategy\n\nA couple of years ago, I worked as a content writer for a literary company that just launched.\n\nDespite all the meetings the team had before the launch, the founder and CEO of the company didn’t understand why it was important to create a content marketing strategy we’d adhere to when the website went live.\n\nThree months after the launch, the CEO called another meeting and expressed their dissatisfaction with the poor performance so far.\n\nBoth the website and the company’s social media profiles were receiving crickets by way of organic traffic, and the paid ads were not converting at all.\n\nI suggested that we create a content strategy plan for the next quarter and see what happens.\n\nWe did that, and sure enough, by the end of Q2, we recorded an increase in traffic and conversions from both the website and social media profiles.\n\nNo matter the kind of company or industry you work in, a content marketing strategy is integral for the success of your digital marketing efforts.\n\nHere are some reasons why.\n\n1. It aligns the team on goals and objectives.\n\nA content marketing strategy ensures that everyone on the marketing team understands the overarching goals and specific objectives of the business.\n\nWhen content creators, social media managers, writers, and other team members are aligned on goals such as brand awareness, lead generation, or customer engagement, they can produce content that consistently supports these aims.\n\nThis increases the chances of getting tangible results.\n\nCarl Broadbent, a digital marketing expert, values content marketing strategies for the alignment they bring.\n\n“After years of publishing blogs, ebooks, and videos, I‘ve learned that a strong content strategy acts like a guiding compass. It points you towards topics and formats aligned with business goals, so you’re not just cranking out content for content's sake,” Broadbent says.\n\nBroadbent also notes that teams will make mistakes along the way.\n\nHe recalls, “‘I've made that mistake! Last year, we invested heavily in podcasts, thinking it would attract our target buyers. Turns out our audience preferred snappy infographics. Our podcast push fizzled out fast without the right strategy in place.”\n\n2. It guides content creation and distribution.\n\nAyomide Joseph, a freelance content marketer for SaaS companies like Aura, Nextiva, and Trengo, explains the purpose of a content marketing strategy:\n\n“The concept of ‘strategy’ in content marketing is simply to give you a roadmap that’ll guide you from where you are to where you want to be,” Joseph says.\n\nFor example, Joseph notes that if you’re looking to drive more inbound leads via content, ideally, creating bottom-of-the-funnel content is the way to go.\n\n“A content marketing strategy answers the questions, ‘How do you go about it? What’s the keyword you’re going to target, search volume, difficulty — and what distribution approach will you utilize?’” Joseph says. “If you don’t have a content marketing strategy, you’ll be working blind.”\n\nA content marketing strategy requires you to plan the type of content to create, such as blog posts, infographics, videos, and podcasts.\n\nYou’ll also determine the most effective channels for distribution, whether that be social media platforms, email marketing, or the company’s website.\n\nThis planning ensures that content is consistent, timely, and relevant to the audience’s interests and needs, fostering brand loyalty and advocacy.\n\n3. It optimizes resources.\n\nWhen you map out a fully-fledged content marketing strategy, you’ll be able to allocate resources more efficiently, whether those resources are time, budget, or manpower, to bring the strategy to life.\n\nBy knowing the type of content you need to produce and the platforms through which you’ll distribute it, you can direct your efforts and budget toward activities that offer the best return on investment (ROI).\n\n4. It improves online visibility.\n\nA well-executed content marketing strategy can alleviate this problem by improving a brand’s visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nHigh-quality, optimized content is favored by search engines and ranks higher in search results, which leads to increased organic traffic.\n\nBy targeting specific keywords and topics relevant to your target audience, you can attract more qualified leads to your website.\n\n5. It builds brand authority and trust.\n\nBy consistently producing high-quality, relevant, and valuable content, you can establish your business as a thought leader in its industry.\n\nThis authority builds trust with your audience, which is crucial for long-term relationships and customer loyalty.\n\nA content marketing strategy ensures that your content not only attracts attention but also provides value and encourages your audience to return and interact with the brand further.\n\nElements of a Content Strategy Plan\n\nSince a content strategy plan is a roadmap designed to guide the creation, publication, and governance of useful content, here are some key elements you should include when creating yours.\n\n1. Goals and Objectives\n\nWhat do you want to achieve with your content?\n\nDo you want to increase brand awareness? Generate leads? Or maybe, improve customer engagement? Is it all three — or something else?\n\nWhen you define the goals and objectives you want your content to help you achieve, you’re establishing your North Star.\n\nSo, if you’re not sure whether to include a certain type of content in your strategy, you can look to your North Star and determine if that content type will lead you in the direction you want to go.\n\n2. Audience Persona\n\nAn audience persona (or buyer persona) is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer based on data and research.\n\nIt helps you understand who you’re creating content for.\n\nTo create an accurate audience persona, you’ll need to conduct research through surveys and interviews and analyze your social media engagement to gather insights.\n\nThese insights include your audience’s demographic information, interests, pain points, and content preferences, to mention a few.\n\nKnowing this information will help you understand the content types, topics, and marketing channels that will help you reach your goals.\n\n3. Content Audit and Analysis\n\nOnce you’ve gotten your audience persona down, review your existing content to determine what’s working and what’s not.\n\nThis way, you’ll be able to identify gaps and opportunities for content.\n\nIn the Content Audit section of your content strategy plan, explain:\n\nThe kinds of content and topics that are already working well for you (e.g., blogs that discuss web development, micro-videos that explain coding tips and tricks, etc.)\n\nThe kinds of content and topics that are not gaining traction (e.g., white papers about the evolution of programming)\n\nThe content gaps and opportunities you’ve discovered\n\nPro tip: Use tools like Google Analytics and social media analytics to evaluate the performance of your content. Look for patterns in what types of content perform best and use this to inform future content creation.\n\n4. Content Types and Channels\n\nNext, decide on the types of content you will create (e.g., blog posts, videos, infographics) and the marketing channels through which you will distribute them (e.g., website, social media, email).\n\nEnsure that you choose these content types and channels based on your audience’s preferences and where they spend their time online.\n\nConsider experimenting with different formats and channels and measuring their effectiveness before choosing your ideal marketing mix.\n\n5. Content Creation Process\n\nThis section of your content strategy plan outlines the steps for producing content, from idea generation to publication. This process includes assigning roles and responsibilities to other team members or freelancers.\n\nPro tip: Develop a content calendar to plan and schedule content in advance. Use collaboration tools to streamline the content creation process and ensure that team members (and/or freelancers) are on the same page.\n\n6. Measurement and Analytics\n\nNow you know your audience personas, the topics that make your audience tick, the channels you’ll use to distribute your content, and the content creation process.\n\nThe next step is to establish the metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the success of your content.\n\nDefine clear metrics for each goal, such as engagement rates for brand awareness or conversion rates for lead generation.\n\nUse analytics tools like Google Analytics and native social media analytics tools to regularly monitor performance and adapt your strategy as needed. You can also use other tools, like HubSpot’s analytics platform, to get a unified overview of your content distribution efforts across multiple channels, including social media, emails, PPC advertisements, and more.\n\n7. Content Governance\n\nContent governance involves setting standards and policies for content creation, publication, and maintenance to ensure consistency and quality over time.\n\nIn this section of your content strategy plan, you’ll develop and include content style guidelines, tone of voice guidelines, and content quality criteria.\n\nThis ensures that your team members and/or freelancers create consistent and cohesive content.\n\nWhat You Need to Create a Content Marketing Strategy\n\nNow let’s have a look at everything you need to have a thorough content marketing strategy in place.\n\n1. Brand Guidelines\n\nBrand guidelines are documents that encapsulate your brand's overall look and feel — its color palette, typography, personality, messaging, and so on.\n\nAlthough generally used to establish a website’s design language or set up ad creatives, brand guidelines also help in your content strategy.\n\nYou can build your content governance model based on your brand guidelines to ensure creative teams always develop content that aligns with your brand identity and drives awareness.\n\nYou can use your brand guidelines to specify your written or video content’s style, tone of voice, the colors and fonts images or graphics should use, and pinpoint your image or video editing style, for instance.\n\nTools like Content Hub also help maintain brand consistency — it features an AI-powered writing assistant that automatically generates or tweaks your existing content based on your brand’s voice.\n\n2. Editorial Calendar\n\nThe terms “content calendar” and “editorial calendar” are often used interchangeably, but are slightly different.\n\nAn editorial calendar looks at the bigger picture — it gives a broad overview of the themes your content should cover within a specific time period. Meanwhile, a content calendar organizes each individual post within that time frame.\n\nFor example, an editorial calendar could simply state that all posts during October should center around Halloween, while the content calendar gets into the details — it organizes a series of individual posts, each covering a topic related to that theme.\n\nUsing both editorial and content calendars simultaneously helps plan a thorough content marketing strategy and ensure cohesive topic coverage. It’s also useful to streamline content ideation processes and maintain steady workflows.\n\n3. Content Clusters\n\nOn a similar note, content clusters are a series of interconnected posts that target all aspects of a particular topic in detail. Topic clusters help establish brand authority and target consumers spread across multiple stages of your marketing funnel.\n\nFor example, if your main topic is SEO, you could create a central post that offers a general overview of the subject — also known as pillar content. You can then branch off and create separate pieces that target all sub-topics related to SEO, like on-page, off-page, and technical SEO.\n\nAgain, content audits help spot topics that already do well. You can double down and turn them into fully-fledged content clusters. You can also use tools like HubSpot’s Marketing Software to set up content clusters and get insights into topic search volumes.\n\n4. Marketing Funnels\n\nSpeaking of funnels, make sure your content strategy is designed to attract consumers from all stages and actively contribute to generating conversions.\n\nFor example, the SEO content pillar I just mentioned would attract top-of-the-funnel consumers — leads interested in a specific topic but who are not ready to make a purchase just yet. The content pillar would offer just enough information to get readers to learn more about the topic.\n\nAn email newsletter sign-up form at the end of the blog post would be handy to get readers who want to get into more details to type in their contact details to draw them into your ecosystem.\n\nFrom there, you could use a CRM tool to store these details and set up personalized email nurturing campaigns. These would help drive leads further down the funnel and eventually turn them into purchasing customers.\n\nThe blogs that cover SEO sub-topics, however, are perfect for attracting bottom-of-the-funnel consumers. In this case, product mentions with links to product pages might be just enough to get these leads to convert.\n\n5. Competitive Research\n\nTake a peek at your competitors. Get into as much detail as possible here — see what themes they cover, what content formats they follow, the channels they use, and how they perform.\n\nThis helps spot any weaknesses you can capitalize on, like not covering a particular topic in as much detail, for example. Meanwhile, knowing what content and marketing channels work best for them serves as another solid starting point for developing your marketing strategy.\n\nNow, let's dive in to learn the specifics of how to create a content marketing plan.\n\nCurious how former HubSpot Senior Director of Global Growth Aja Frost put together our content strategy? Here it is.\n\n1. Define your goal.\n\nWhat's your aim for developing a content marketing plan? Why do you want to produce content and create a content marketing plan?\n\nIt may seem obvious, but these questions are the core of a useful content strategy.\n\nLook at high-level business goals, notes from meetings, and notes from your team, then do some solo research to make sure your goals have staying power.\n\nOrganize goals by priority.\n\nOnce you have a list of goals, rank them from most to least important.\n\nThis can help you decide which parts of your strategy are an immediate need and which are for long-term action.\n\nThis step can also help with resource questions later in the process.\n\nUse the SMART framework to define goals.\n\nThe SMART framework can help you make broad goals more specific and actionable.\n\nKnow your goals before you begin planning, and you‘ll have an easier time determining what’s best for your strategy.\n\nDownload this goal-planning template to you figure out the right content goals.\n\n2. Conduct persona research.\n\nTo develop a successful plan, you need to clearly define your content's target audience — also known as your buyer persona.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the planning phase of content strategy.\n\nThis is especially important for those who are new to marketing. By knowing your target audience, you can produce more relevant and valuable content that they'll want to read and convert on.\n\nCollect data and analyze it to find patterns.\n\nIf you don‘t already have defined personas, you’ll want to analyze your data to find who you want to create content for and the types of content they enjoy.\n\nThis post has some useful tips for how to create buyer personas using your data.\n\nAs you analyze metrics like contact trends and demographics, group your leads by what they have in common first.\n\nThen, look closely at these groups to find other similarities.\n\nUse your research to refine buyer personas.\n\nIf you're an experienced marketer, your target may have changed.\n\nDo you want to target a new group of people or expand your current target market? Do you want to keep the same target audience?\n\nRevisiting your audience parameters by conducting market research each year is crucial to growing your audience. Taking a closer look at your current customer segments can also help you refine your personas.\n\nFeatured Tool: Buyer Persona Generator\n\n3. Run a content audit.\n\nEarly on, many brands start with blog posts or social media.\n\nIf you want to venture out into different formats, you can run a content audit to assess your top-performing and lowest-performing content.\n\nIf you've been in business for a while, you should review your content marketing efforts and last year’s results.\n\nFind topic and formatting gaps.\n\nAs you review your content, be sure to record page titles, content formats, word counts, and a summary of what your content covers.\n\nThis can help you find areas for improvement.\n\nReview content for quality and relevance.\n\nNext, analyze content quality and whether your content reflects what's most important to your audience.\n\nThen, use that information to inform which direction you take next.\n\nLook for repurposing opportunities.\n\nThere are many ways to repurpose content.\n\nThis strategy can help you optimize your content on multiple channels.\n\nIt might mean grabbing your most popular blogs and creating YouTube videos, an ebook, or launching a podcast with that content.\n\nCheck out this post for more content-recycling ideas.\n\nCreate a content workflow.\n\nAnother way to approach your audit is to look at your team's process.\n\nYour content workflow impacts how you come up with ideas, what you publish, and the quality of your work.\n\nDo you have a strategic workflow in place, or is your workflow organized around the habits of your team? An audit can help you see blocks and slow-downs that can affect your content long-term.\n\nUse your content audit to figure out what you can do differently in the upcoming year and set new goals. Now is also a great time to align your team‘s goals with the rest of your organization’s goals.\n\nWhatever stage you're in, a content audit will help you decide what resonates best with your audience, find gaps in your topic clusters, and process and brainstorm fresh content ideas.\n\n4. Choose a content management system.\n\nA few vital parts of content management include content creation, content publication, and content analytics.\n\nYou want to invest in a CMS to create, manage, and track your content in an easy and sustainable way.\n\nFigure out specific CMS needs.\n\nFinding the right CMS for your team may take some time.\n\nFirst, talk to your team about their current processes to get a sense of the top features you'll need. Then, start researching the best CMS for your needs with this list.\n\nA CMS for a business should be easy to use, customizable, secure, and cost-effective.\n\nChoose the right content management system.\n\nWith the HubSpot CMS, you can plan, produce, publish, and measure your results all in one place.\n\nAnother popular CMS is WordPress, to which you can add the HubSpot WordPress plugin for free web forms, live chat, CRM access, email marketing, and analytics.\n\nThis list of the best content management systems offers a comparison between the tools above and other popular choices.\n\nAdopt a content governance model.\n\nAs you get to know your new CMS, be sure to put a content governance model in place. This is a process to manage content creation, publishing, and maintenance.\n\nIt helps you make sure that each piece of content aligns with business standards and policies.\n\nAs your content presence grows, this model will also help you create processes for updating and removing outdated content.\n\n5. Determine which type of content you want to create.\n\nThere are a variety of options out there for content you can create, from written content like ebooks and blog posts to audio content like podcasts.\n\nGreat content strategy is a balance of decision-making, data analysis, and risk-taking. Those skills will all be put to the test in this step.\n\nReview personas and goals.\n\nYou may need different types of content for different personas and goals.\n\nTake a careful look at your end goals and the actions you want each persona to take. Then, work backward to choose the right kind of content for each goal and user.\n\nFor example, say you're trying to decide between starting a blog or a podcast. Blogs tend to be better for conversion, while podcasts are great for building brand awareness.\n\nYour goals and audience should be the deciding factor for which is best for your business.\n\nAssess your resources.\n\nUse a critical eye when you're reviewing the resources you have for content production.\n\nQuestions like the ones below can help you narrow your focus and create a sustainable content strategy.\n\nHow big is your team?\n\nHow much time does your team have to create content?\n\nWhat skills does your current team have?\n\nWhat types of content would you need training on, and what would you need to outsource?\n\nWhat is your content budget?\n\nChoose the right topics, formats, and channels for your content.\n\nUsing your personas, choose a set number of high-level topics to focus your content on. You can speed up the process and find relevant ideas with a topic generator — simply type in a keyword and see what pops up, along with insights regarding search volumes to help gauge topic popularity.\n\nThen, using your audience and topic choices, narrow down your chosen content formats and channels.\n\nFor example, say your team is launching a video channel, but they don‘t have a lot of experience. You might consider creating video shorts.\n\nBut if rankings for that topic tend to be long-form videos or podcasts, you’ll want to think about that decision — do you want to stand out and hope your audience pivots to a new format?\n\nOr should you get help creating the content you think will top the current competitive landscape for your topic?\n\nOnce you’ve made these big decisions about your content strategy, you’ll be ready to get into the details.\n\n6. Brainstorm content ideas.\n\nUse your content audit, persona research, and goals to make the best content decisions for your business.\n\nA quick review of this information before brainstorming can help you keep these insights top-of-mind.\n\nUse a range of brainstorming approaches.\n\nNext, it's time to start coming up with ideas for your next content project.\n\nHere are some tools to get the juices flowing.\n\n1. Feedly\n\nThe Feedly RSS feed is a wonderful way to track trendy topics in your industry and find content ideas at the same time.\n\nYou start by telling the software what topics you're most interested in, and its AI tool will do the rest.\n\nYou won't need to scour the internet to find new content ideas anymore. Instead, you can go through your curated list, compiled from news sites, newsletters, and social media.\n\n2. BuzzSumo\n\nWant to discover popular content and content ideas?\n\nThis company offers several market research tools, one of which uses social media shares to figure out if a piece of content is popular and well-liked.\n\nThis information helps you see which content ideas would do well if you were to create content about them.\n\n3. BlogAbout\n\nGet your mind gears going with IMPACT's blog title generator.\n\nThis tool works a bit like Mad Libs, but instead of joke sentences, it shows you common headline formats with blanks where you can fill in the subject you have in mind.\n\nThis brainstorming technique helps you put general ideas in contexts that would be appealing to your target audience. Once you have a headline you like, BlogAbout lets you add it to your “Notebook” so you can save your best ideas.\n\n4. CoSchedule Headline Analyzer\n\nYou can get blog post ideas for an entire year with HubSpot's Blog Ideas Generator.\n\nAll you need to do is enter general topics or terms you'd like to write about, and this content idea generator does all the work for you.\n\nThis tool analyzes headlines and titles and gives feedback on length, word choice, grammar, and keyword search volume.\n\nIf you have an idea in mind, run a few title options through the Headline Analyzer to see how you could make it stronger.\n\n5. HubSpot's Website Grader\n\nThis is a great tool to use when you want to see where you're at with your website and SEO efforts.\n\nThe Website Grader grades you on vital areas of your website performance and sends you a detailed report to help you optimize.\n\nWith this tool, you can figure out how to make your website more SEO-friendly and discover areas of improvement.\n\nRefine and rank your ideas.\n\nThe brainstorming process should be loose and unstructured.\n\nIt can be tempting to jump on an idea and start creating content right away. But instead, try to throw out your wildest ideas and see where they lead.\n\nThen, take that list of content ideas and refine them.\n\nTo start, break ideas into groups and organize them around your goals, topics, or personas. Then, review each idea in detail and add specifics.\n\nFor example, say your topic is AI. One of your content ideas might be image generation. You can break this idea down further with content for image-generation tools, text-to-image prompts, or how to edit existing images.\n\nAnother way to refine content ideas is to conduct keyword research.\n\nYou can also define your process for refining ideas in your content workflow.\n\n7. Publish and manage your content.\n\nYour marketing plan should go beyond the types of content you‘ll create — it should also cover how you’ll organize your content.\n\nDevelop a content calendar.\n\nWith the help of an editorial calendar, you'll be on the right track to publishing a well-balanced and diverse content library on your website.\n\nThen, create a social media content calendar to promote and manage your content on other sites.\n\nFeatured Tool: Free Editorial Calendar Templates\n\nDownload for Free\n\nOptimize your content for reach.\n\nMany of the ideas you think of will be evergreen (i.e., just as relevant months or years from now as they are today).\n\nThat being said, you shouldn't ignore timely topics either. While they may not be the bulk of your editorial calendar, they can help you generate spikes of traffic.\n\nFor example, most people count on incorporating popular holidays, like New Year‘s, in their marketing efforts. But you don’t have to limit yourself to these important marketing dates.\n\nIf there are niche holidays that might appeal to your audience, it could be worth publishing content on your blog or social media. Check out this ultimate list of social media holidays — check it when you're planning your calendar.\n\nSEO tactics, cross-channel promotion, and channel-specific strategies (like social media strategy) are also key parts of content optimization.\n\nTrack and analyze content performance and process.\n\nAnalytics are essential to a strong content strategy.\n\nChoose KPIs like traffic, engagement, lead generation, and conversion rates to measure the success of your content.\n\nThese resources can help you choose the best KPIs for each channel:\n\nEmail marketing KPIs.\n\nBlog KPIs.\n\nSEO KPIs.\n\nSmarketing KPIs.\n\nSocial Media KPIs.\n\nMarketing KPIs.\n\nRevise your content strategy with data insights.\n\nDon't just collect and review your data.\n\nConnect it to your content strategy efforts. Review your KPIs for effectiveness, run marketing experiments, and use your data to adjust your strategy.\n\nThis analysis can also be helpful when you need support from stakeholders. It can sometimes be difficult to get the resources you need to test a risky idea.\n\nData-driven insights can support your case for trying new ideas with your content strategy.\n\nPro tip: Use Campaign Assistant to generate copy that fits your content strategy.\n\nContent Marketing Strategy Statistics\n\nHere are some statistics that show the results a content marketing strategy can help you generate for your business:\n\n29% of marketers actively use content marketing. (HubSpot State of Marketing Report, 2024)\n\n50% of marketers plan on increasing their investment in content marketing in 2024. (HubSpot State of Marketing Report, 2024)\n\n15% of marketers find it challenging to generate traffic and leads for their business. (HubSpot Marketing Trends Report, 2024)\n\n17% of marketers say that short-form videos are a trend that has generated strong results for their businesses. (HubSpot Marketing Trends Report, 2024)\n\n13% of marketers are using voice search optimization (Alexa, Siri, etc.) as part of their marketing strategy. (HubSpot Marketing Trends Report, 2024)\n\n90% of social media marketers say building an active online community is crucial to a successful social media strategy. (HubSpot State of Marketing Report, 2023)\n\nQuestions to Ask When Creating a Content Strategy\n\nWhen you develop a content strategy, there are a few questions to answer. Let's dive into those now.\n\n1. Who will be reading your content?\n\nWho's the target audience for your content? For how many audiences are you creating content?\n\nJust as your business might have more than one type of customer, your content strategy can cater to more than one type of user.\n\nUsing a variety of content types and channels will help you deliver content that's tailored to each persona.\n\n2. What problem will you be solving for your audience(s)?\n\nIdeally, your product or service solves a problem you know your audience has.\n\nBy the same token, your content coaches and educates your audience through this problem as they begin to notice and address it.\n\nA sound content strategy supports people on both sides of your product: those who are still figuring out what their main challenges are and those who are already using your product to overcome these challenges.\n\nYour content reinforces the solution(s) you're offering and helps you build credibility with your target audience.\n\n3. What makes you unique?\n\nYour competitors likely have a similar product as yours, which means your potential customers need to know what makes yours better — or, at least, different.\n\nMaybe your main asset is that your company has been established for many years. Or perhaps you have a unique brand voice that makes you stand out from your competitors.\n\nTo prove why you‘re worth buying from, you need to prove why you’re worth listening to. Once you figure that out, permeate that message in your content.\n\n4. What content formats will you focus on?\n\nTo figure out what formats to focus on, you need to meet your audience where they are.\n\nWhile you may be tempted to launch a podcast or launch a YouTube channel, find out first where your audience lives.\n\nOtherwise, you may waste time creating content that either won't reach your audience or capture their attention.\n\nOnce you choose the best formats, start creating a budget to assess what resources you can allocate to execute this strategy.\n\n5. What channels will you publish on?\n\nJust as you can create content in different formats, you'll also have various channels you can publish to, from your website to social media.\n\nThis part of your content strategy, again, will show where your audience lives.\n\nIf your audience prefers long-form video content, you may opt to publish your content on YouTube. If you have a younger audience that likes quick content, you may opt for TikTok and Instagram.\n\n6. How will you manage content creation and publication?\n\nFiguring out how you'll create and publish all your content can be a daunting task.\n\nBefore you execute, it's important to establish:\n\nWho's creating what.\n\nWhere it's being published.\n\nWhen it's going live.\n\nIn a small team, this may be easy enough as you may be the sole decision-maker. As your company grows, you may need to collaborate with several content teams to figure out an effective process.\n\nToday's content strategies prevent clutter by managing content from a topic standpoint.\n\nWhen planning a content editorial calendar around topics, you can easily visualize your company's message and assert yourself as an authority in your market over time.\n\nContent Strategy Template\n\nReady to get started with your own content marketing strategy? Download this helpful workbook.\n\nIt includes key readings and activities to help you fine-tune your plan and develop a robust strategy. You'll learn how to:\n\nGenerate content ideas.\n\nCreate topic clusters and pillar pages.\n\nPromote your content.\n\nRepurpose your content based on your needs.\n\nContent Marketing Strategy Example\n\nTo understand what a content strategy is, let's consider the following scenario:\n\nA prospect calls a sales representative at Wistia and asks questions related to Wistia's video hosting service. As the Wistia sales rep speaks with her, he learns her business is using a few other tools to convert leads into sales, including Intercom.\n\nBingo.\n\nOnce the call ends, the sales rep sends the prospect a follow-up email with a blog post about Wistia's integration with Intercom, which enables Intercom users to further personalize messages to prospects based on video-watching data they collect through Wistia.\n\nThis is a prime example of how you might use a content strategy as a sales enablement tool.\n\nOn the surface, it might seem odd that Wistia has dedicated content about another business tool.\n\nHowever, this content is a great resource for Wistia‘s sales team, particularly when prospects have concerns about how Wistia’s product can integrate with their existing software or processes.\n\nPutting a content strategy in place means that you need a firm understanding of content tactics.\n\nContent Strategy vs. Content Tactics\n\nContent tactics are the actions you take to deliver your content strategy.\n\nContent strategy defines the why and how of your content programming as a whole. Content tactics define the types of content you create and how you create each piece of content.\n\nBoth are important to a successful content marketing program.\n\nThese are the eight most popular types of content marketing you can create for your readers and customers.\n\n1. Blog Posts\n\nIf you haven‘t already noticed, you’re currently reading a blog post.\n\nBlog posts live on a website and should be published regularly to attract new visitors. In fact, 16% of marketers say that their blog posts generated the biggest ROI for their businesses this year.\n\nBlog posts should offer valuable content for your audience that makes them inclined to share posts on social media and across other websites.\n\nWe recommend that posts be between 1,000 and 2,000 words in length, but you should experiment to see if your audience prefers longer or shorter reads.\n\nFeatured Tool: 6 Free Blog Post Templates\n\nCheck out our free blog post templates for writing great how-to, listicle, curation, SlideShare presentation, and newsjacking posts on your own blog.\n\n2. Ebooks\n\nEbooks are lead-generation tools that website visitors download after submitting a lead form with their contact information.\n\nThey're typically longer, more in-depth, and published less often than blog posts, which are written to attract visitors to a website.\n\nBut ebooks aren't only effective for the top of the funnel.\n\nAs Nora Leary, Growth Director at Ironpaper, Inc., notes, “Ebooks serve different purposes at varying stages in the buyer's journey.”\n\nShe told me, “Awareness-level ebooks help educate the prospect about a certain pain point and are an excellent lead capture tool. The content should remain introductory and informational.”\n\nLeary adds, \"Ebooks can convert leads in the funnel by offering them useful tools as prospects consider their needs more in-depth.\n\nAn ebook here might dive deeper into a particular problem and solution options and include templates or calculators.\n\n[Lastly,] ebooks further down the funnel should become more personalized and offer more sales content. Comparison guides or an ebook of case studies are beneficial for prospects at this stage.\"\n\nEbooks are the next step in the inbound marketing process. After reading a blog post, visitors might want more information.\n\nThis is where calls-to-action (CTAs) come into play, directing people to a landing page where they can submit their contact information and download an ebook to learn more valuable information for their business.\n\nIn turn, the business producing the ebook has a new lead for the sales team to contact.\n\nFeatured Tool: 18 Free Ebook Templates\n\nDownload for Free\n\n3. Case Studies\n\nA case study allows you to tell a customer story and build credibility in the process.\n\nA case study is perhaps your most versatile type of content marketing because it can take many different forms — some of which are on this list. That's right, case studies can take the form of a blog post, ebook, podcast, or even an infographic.\n\nThe goal is to show how your product helped real-life companies succeed. Before choosing a customer for a case study, narrow in on the business area you're trying to drive value for.\n\nFeatured Tool: 3 Free Case Study Templates\n\nDownload for Free\n\n4. Templates\n\nTemplates are effective content marketing examples to try because they generate leads while offering tremendous value to your audience.\n\nWhen you offer your audience templates to save them time and help them succeed, they're more likely to engage with your content in the future.\n\n5. Infographics\n\nInfographics can organize and visualize data in a more compelling way than words alone.\n\nThese are great content formats to use if you're trying to share a lot of data in a way that is clear and easy to understand.\n\nFeatured Tool: 15 Free Infographic Templates\n\nIf you're ready to get started, get our templates for creating beautiful infographics in less than an hour.\n\n6. Videos\n\nVideos are a highly engaging content medium and are shareable across social media platforms and websites alike.\n\nVideos require a bigger investment of time and resources than written content, but as visual content continues to offer big ROI, it's a medium worth exploring.\n\nFeatured Tool: Free Video Marketing Starter Pack + Templates\n\nDownload for Free\n\n7. Podcasts\n\nStarting a podcast will help audiences find your brand if they don't have time or interest in reading content every day.\n\nThe number of podcast listeners is growing — in 2022, there was a 6% year-over-year increase in U.S. podcast listeners.\n\nIf you have interesting people to interview or conversations to host, consider podcasting as another content format to experiment with.\n\nFeatured Tool: How to Start a Podcast [Guide + Templates]\n\nDownload for Free\n\n8. Social Media\n\nOnce you've been regularly publishing content on your own site for a while, start thinking about a social media strategy to distribute your content on social media.\n\nIn addition to sharing your content, you can also repurpose it into new formats and create original content specifically for each platform.\n\nPosting on social media is pivotal to amplifying your brand's reach and delivering your content to your customers where you know they spend their time. Popular social networks include:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTikTok\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nSnapchat\n\nYouTube\n\nWhen launching a business account on any of the social networks above, adjust your content to the platform.\n\nOn Instagram, for example, users want aesthetically pleasing visuals.\n\nWith feeds, IGTV, Stories, you have a lot of room to play with. TikTok, on the other hand, appeals to a younger demographic that wants trendy, funny, and creative short-form videos.\n\nDo some market research to discover which platforms your buyers are on, and mold your content to their expectations.\n\nContent strategy is more than planning and maintenance.\n\nIt takes time, organization, and creativity to grow a successful content marketing strategy.\n\nFrom building the foundation of your content marketing plan to adding tools to better manage your content, setting up your strategy won't be a hassle if you follow the steps and explore the resources here.\n\nEditor's note: This post was originally published in September 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness."
