        "text": "The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) describes generally accepted knowledge about software engineering. Its 15 knowledge areas (KAs) summarize key concepts and include a reference list for detailed information.\n\nFor version 3.0, editors received and replied to comments from approximately 150 reviewers in 33 countries. The Computer Society and its volunteers will continue to use the transparent and open consensus process that is an integral part of SWEBOK to continue improving it. SWEBOK has also gained international recognition as ISO Technical Report 19759.\n\nThe SWEBOK Guide\n\ncharacterizes the contents of the software engineering discipline\n\npromotes a consistent view of software engineering worldwide\n\nclarifies the place of, and sets the boundary of, software engineering with respect to other disciplines\n\nprovides a foundation for training materials and curriculum development, and\n\nprovides a basis for certification and licensing of software engineers.\n\nSWEBOK V3.0 is the most recent version of the internationally respected Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge. Imagined as a living, changing document, and thoroughly updated, the guide has been developed and created by leading authorities, reviewed by professionals, and made available for public review and comment, continuing its 20-year reputation as the most authoritative, fundamental, and trusted definition of the software engineering profession.\n\nThe following principles underlie the development approach for this project:\n\ntransparency: the development process is itself published and fully documented;\n\nconsensus-building: the development process is designed to build, over time, consensus in industry, professional societies and standards-setting bodies, among practicing software developers and in academia.\n\nwide distribution: the Guide will remain free at least in one format to ensure as wide a distribution and dissemination as possible.\n\nBe sure to register to receive notifications to get notified when a new version is available.\n\nThe committee in charge of the 2004 SWEBOK Guide knew it had to plan for revisions, and in fact outlined a process for doing so. The reasons for doing so, included:\n\nPractices change. New tools, methods, and types of software make good practice in software engineering an ever-changing target. Topics that were once experimental may have now reached the state of generally accepted knowledge. And even though the Guide focuses on the most widely accepted and long-lasting of practices, it’s possible for the environment that software operates in to change significantly because of business and job changes. For example, it has become clear in just the past few years that good software practice must pay increasing attention to security. Economics can also affect what methods become best practices in software engineering.\n\nOther viewpoints emerge. Other Computer Society products—notably the Certified Software Development Professional (CSDP) exam and the Software Engineering 2004 curriculum guide—offer slightly differing views of the body of knowledge. So it makes sense to take the opportunity to examine them and better align the SWEBOK Version 3 with them where it makes sense. For example, it seems reasonable that there should be a core set of references for these products, so part of the work on the SWEBOK Version 3 will establish that core set. The comparison among these efforts has also suggested the need for new knowledge areas and the revision of others.\n\nThe body of knowledge grows. Since 2004, many of the books cited in the first SWEBOK Guide have been revised and new articles have been added to the body of knowledge. The SWEBOK Version 3 should account for these changes.\n\nThese factors drive the need for a new version of the SWEBOK Guide on a regular basis.\n\nLearn a bit more about the evolution of SWEBOK through our webinar: Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge v3.0 Intro, Usages, and Ongoing Work.\n\nConsensus on a Core Body of Knowledge Is Crucial\n\nIn spite of the millions of software professionals worldwide and the ubiquitous presence of software in our society, software engineering has relatively recently reached the status of a legitimate engineering discipline and a recognized profession.\n\nIn engineering, the accreditation of university curricula and the licensing and certification of practicing professionals are taken very seriously. These activities are seen as critical to the constant upgrading of professionals and, hence, the improvement of the level of professional practice. Recognizing a core body of knowledge is pivotal to the development and accreditation of university curricula and the licensing and certification of professionals.\n\nAchieving consensus by the profession on a core body of knowledge is a key milestone in all disciplines and has been identified by the IEEE Computer Society as crucial for the evolution of software engineering towards professional status. The Guide, written under the auspices of the Professional Activities Board, is part of a multiyear project designed to reach such a consensus. The ongoing SWEBOK project and its next milestone—the SWEBOK Version 4.0—will continue to redefine “accepted knowledge” and add new areas.\n\nFocus on Generally Accepted Knowledge\n\nThe software engineering body of knowledge is an all-inclusive term that describes the sum of knowledge within the profession of software engineering. Since it is usually not possible to put the full body of knowledge of even an emerging discipline, such as software engineering, into a single document, there is a need for a Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge. This Guide will seek to identify and describe that subset of the body of knowledge that is generally accepted, even though software engineers must be knowledgeable not only in software engineering, but also, of course, in other related disciplines.\n\nWhat do we mean by “generally accepted knowledge”?\n\nTo better illustrate what “generally accepted knowledge” is relative to other types of knowledge, the figure below proposes a draft three-category schema for classifying knowledge.\n\nCategories of Knowledge\n\nThe Project Management Institute in its Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge defines “generally accepted” knowledge for project management in the following manner:\n\n“Generally accepted” does not mean that the knowledge and practices described are or should be applied uniformly on all projects; the project management team is always responsible for determining what is appropriate for any given project.\n\nThe Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge is now an IEEE Standard, IEEE 1490-2003.\n\nThe Industrial Advisory Board of the SWEBOK Guide better defines “generally accepted” as knowledge to be included in the study material of a software engineering licensing exam that a graduate would pass after completing four years of work experience. These two definitions should be seen as complementary.\n\nKnowledge Area Editors are also expected to be somewhat forward-looking in their interpretation by taking into consideration not only what is “generally accepted” today, but what they expect will be “generally accepted” in a 3 to 5 year timeframe.\n\nSoftware Engineering Body of Knowledge and Curriculum are Not the Same\n\nSoftware engineers must not only be knowledgeable in what is specific to their discipline, but they also, of course, have to know a lot more. The goal of this initiative is not, however, to inventory everything that software engineers should know, but to identify what forms the core of software engineering. It is the responsibility of other organizations and initiatives involved in the licensing and certification of professionals and the development of accreditation criteria and curricula to define what a software engineer must know outside software engineering. We believe that a very clear distinction must be made between the software engineering body of knowledge and the contents of software engineering curricula.\n\nView the SWEBOK table of contents to get an overview of topics.\n\nThe document you are about to download is protected by US and international copyright laws, and is made available to you exclusively for your own individual, non-commercial purposes.
