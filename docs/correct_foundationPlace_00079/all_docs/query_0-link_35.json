CONTROL CHART – CYCLE TIME © COPYRIGHT 2019 CRITICAL SOFTWARE 35\n\n36. © COPYRIGHT 2019 CRITICAL SOFTWARE ACHIEVEMENTS & RESULTS\n\n37. © COPYRIGHT 2019 CRITICAL SOFTWARE 37 QUANTITATIVE – Avg. Cycle Time (Team) From T0, we have improved by 28% the Team Cycle Time. What we changed: - Weekly Backlog review with Team to close DONE issues and unblock others - Refined work stages which now exclude pending on others (Outflows, Risks, PLANNING issues) - Defined WIP limit for all work stages (used Team Capacity) - Improved some processes, accepting more risk!\n\n38. © COPYRIGHT 2019 CRITICAL SOFTWARE 39 QUANTITATIVE - BACKLOG ISSUES 517 Backlog items on 08.11.2016 (T0), now 320, we reduced the Backlog by 38%. What we changed: - Perform weekly 1h Top-N Oldest meeting to progress old backlog issues … - Started monitoring creation/resolution trend of Backlog - Started monitoring Team’s Throughput\n\n39. © COPYRIGHT 2019 CRITICAL SOFTWARE 40 QUANTITATIVE – Avg. Age Chart Monitors avg. days unresolved issues are open … If we consider Initial value since 01.10.2016 (T0), we reduced by 61% the average age of work items!\n\n40. We realized many of the Benefits that Kanban advocates! ❖ Team Cycle Time: 28% improvement ❖ Avg. Age of work items: 61% improvement ❖ BACKLOG size reduced from 517 to ~320 work items ❖ We now have WORK VISIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, CONTINOUS IMPROVEMENT ❖ Team refuses to return to “old working methods” ❖ We are loving it, and still improving … ☺ © COPYRIGHT 2019 CRITICAL SOFTWARE 41\n\n41. ❖ Facilitate Kanban adoption => start with no WIP limits (proto- Kanban) ❖ No roles, no prescribed process, IT domain => factors that make it easier to adopt Kanban ❖ Retros and Metrics push team to better use the Board and follow policies => peer pressure and visibility! ❖ JIRA integrates all work items, multiple projects, provides control charts, good tool to start a Kanban journey … but also has some limitations ❖ Invest in Formal Kanban training => speeds up your Kanban change © COPYRIGHT 2019 CRITICAL SOFTWARE 42 Lessons!?\n\n42. © Copyright Critical Software.
