        "text": "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recently released the longawaited secure software development framework (SSDF) attestation form. This action automatically restarted the clock on the Office of Management and Budget’s requirement that all critical software must be attested within 90 days and all other software must be attested within 180 days of the finalized form.\n\nConcurrently, CISA launched the repository for software attestations and artifacts\n\n(RSAA), a web portal where CISA expects federal agency representatives and\n\nsoftware producers alike will “be able to review and upload software attestation\n\nforms, artifacts, and make organization-specific annotations to entries in\n\naccordance with their job responsibilities.”\n\nWhat happens on the first business day following the 90- and 180-day waiting\n\nperiod, June 10 and Sept. 9, respectively, is now in the hands of acquisition teams\n\nand authorizing officials. The SSDF attestation requirement forced on industry will\n\neither be ridiculed as another form of compliance theater or heralded as a pathway\n\nto an accelerated issuance of an authorizations to operate (ATOs) and greater cyber\n\nresiliency across the massive swath of government procured products and services.\n\nUnlike the Federal Risk Authorization and Management Program (FedRAMP)\n\nprogram that predominantly focuses on cloud service providers, OMB has made it\n\nclear that SSDF attestations cover all software including firmware, embedded and\n\ncloud service offerings. The software that powers anti-lock brakes in a forestry\n\nservice pickup, that powers the microwave in the Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nhospital break room, that powers the palm readers to access classified areas, and\n\neverything else in between now must be attested to following the SSDF before the\n\ngovernment will buy. The hope is that by adopting this broad definition of software\n\nthe government’s buying power alone will profoundly influence and reshape the\n\ncybersecurity behaviors of all software producers.\n\nIn fact, even those software producers that already have offerings listed in the\n\nFedRAMP marketplace likely have additional work to do to achieve SSDF\n\ncompliance before they can attest. Specifically, the FedRAMP moderate and high\n\nbaselines, largely based upon the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s\n\nSpecial Publication 800-53, do not explicitly require the supply chain risk\n\nmanagement family’s provenance control, SR-4. However, the SSDF extensively\n\nfocuses on provenance, with each of the four SSDF groupings including explicit\n\ntasks that can only be satisfied by creating and securely managing trusted telemetry\n\nto establish an irrefutable set of provenance data.\n\nThe SSDF definition for provenance is pulled straight from NIST SP 800-53: “The\n\nchronology of the origin, development, ownership, location and changes to a\n\nsystem or system component and associated data. It may also include personnel\n\nand processes used to interact with or make modifications to the system,\n\ncomponent or associated data.”\n\nThe time has arrived for acquisition teams and authorizing officials (AOs) across\n\nthe federal landscape to collaboratively decide how important cyber resiliency\n\nactually is to the constituents they serve. At first blush, a vendor filling out a PDF\n\nform, self-certifying compliance and shoving the data into a bespoke repository\n\nhosted by CISA could appear to offer little in the way of cyber resilience. This is\n\ntrue only if acquisition teams and authorizing officials let this happen.\n\nAOs now have a clear pathway to achieving something they’ve wanted for\n\ndecades: more input earlier in the acquisition cycle, or “shifting security left,” as it\n\nis colloquially referred to. AOs have been afforded the opportunity to define and\n\nestablish resilience on “Day 0” of an acquisition instead of trying to bolt it on after\n\nthe fact like they largely do today. Under the auspices of Executive Order 14028,\n\nImproving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, and through the software producer’s own\n\nSSDF attestation, AOs can now collaborate with acquisition teams and stipulate\n\nthe types of provenance data they want to access to prior to the RFP’s publication\n\nin the Federal Register.\n\nIn some cases a software bill of materials (SBOM), a provenance mechanism that\n\nis generated at the end of the build process, may be sufficient. In other cases, AOs\n\nmay desire access to a more robust set of trusted telemetry captured across the\n\ntotality of all software build processes in so-called compliance pipelines, from\n\ncode commit through artifact creation. In both situations, any software producer\n\nattesting SSDF compliance must have this provenance data to comply with SSDF\n\ntask Protect the Software 3.1: “Securely archive the necessary files and supporting\n\ndata (e.g., integrity verification information, provenance data) to be retained for\n\neach software release.”\n\nOMB cannot allow CISA to measure success of the SSDF attestation requirement\n\nsolely through the number of PDF forms submitted. Instead, the success and value\n\nderived from the government through software producer SSDF attestations should\n\nbe measured by monitoring and reporting on how many requests for proposals now\n\nask for specific types of software provenance data. AOs and acquisition teams\n\nmust be educated and expected to more closely collaborate and define what level\n\nof provenance data they seek through the RFP process. After all, once the software\n\nproducer submits their SSDF attestation form, producing the trusted telemetry is as\n\nsimple as taking existing metadata, zipping it up and uploading it into the RSAA.\n\nThe Biden administration has invested significant time and energy into\n\ncybersecurity, publishing well over a thousand pages of guidance related to\n\nsecuring the software supply chain and linked explicitly to CISA’s secure by\n\ndesign initiatives. In 2023, the Justice Department reported it was party to 543\n\nsettlements and judgments exceeding $2.68 billion under the False Claims Act. It’s\n\ntime for AOs and acquisition teams to use the tools they’ve been given and\n\ndemand access to provenance data artifacts in their RFPs. Any software producer\n\nthat responds that they cannot provide the data or that assembling the data is too\n\ncomplicated and time consuming after filing their SSDF attestation has likely run\n\nafoul of the False Claims Act. Come Sept. 9, 2024 when all software requires\n\nattestation, industry will be watching to see if SSDF attestation is headed towards\n\ncompliance theater, or if federal employees have started using these SSDF\n\nattestations to achieve the true goal of EO 14028.\n\nJason Weiss is the chief operating officer of TestifySec and a former chief software\n\nofficer for the Defense Department\n\nCopyright © 2024 Federal News Network.
