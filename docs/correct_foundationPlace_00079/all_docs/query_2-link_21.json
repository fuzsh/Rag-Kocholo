We bring together the people trying to solve the world’s most urgent health challenges with those who are able to fund their work. This funding paves the way for innovations in health technology and more sustainable health systems. All with the single goal of saving more lives, in more places.\n\n“We have to create a healthier, more equitable future for everyone. By investing in 8 billion lives and by using a flexible, innovative, partnership-driven approach, our goal is to overcome the health challenges of today and ensure healthy lives tomorrow.”\n\nProf. Dr. Thomas Zeltner, Founder and Chair of the Board"
