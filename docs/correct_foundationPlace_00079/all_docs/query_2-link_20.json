Many records are distributed across multiple websites or have yet to be digitized. The current GLO Automation System is outdated, delaying record publication. If unable to access records electronically, users must call or visit a BLM public room, creating a frustrating experience for the American public and industry and government officials who need to make decisions related to public lands.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, BLM is taking an agile approach to:\n\nIncrease the number of land records available online\n\nEnhance search functionality on the GLO website\n\nRedesign the public-facing web application to improve efficiency and accuracy of retrieved data and improve document images\n\nAcross three phases, BLM is working to:\n\nDecrease staff processing time by 80% by applying machine learning to records indexing, including optical character recognition and natural language processing\n\nCreate a land records ecosystem by integrating GLO with other BLM applications\n\nOperationalize GLO on BLM’s Mission Services Platform, which includes enterprise software for secure and streamlined processes for the public\n\nEnforcing the nation’s antitrust laws, protecting competition across the economy\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE-ANTITRUST DIVISION (DOJ-ATR): Improving antitrust enforcement with modern technology\n\nInvestment start: January 2024.\n\nChallenge: The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice enforces the laws that prevent and prohibit practices that deprive American consumers, taxpayers, and workers of the benefits of a free market system. As a result, their cases are essential to our economy and our democracy. The size and complexity of corporate communication has grown considerably since the COVID-19 pandemic, and much of communication shifted from email to chat-based applications. ATR’s current tooling and methods will not be able to keep up with these changes without improving the speed, convenience, and efficiency of working with datasets that extend beyond email.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, ATR will:\n\nRapidly acquire and deploy updated review platforms with artificial intelligence (AI) enabled\n\nExpand their data ingestion and analysis pipelines to leverage AI tools\n\nImprove their internal IT service management, increasing the capability of their case management systems\n\nSimplify the public complaints process, and hire technologists to maintain and grow these solutions\n\nBetter access to critical DOL data for developers, journalists, researchers, and agencies\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL): Data modernization\n\nInvestment start: March 2021.\n\nChallenge: DOL provides commonly requested data on mission support, enforcement, benefits, employment, and training to developers, journalists, researchers, and other federal agencies. Currently, DOL faces issues with availability and accessibility of this critical data and needs to modernize its enterprise data infrastructure accordingly. Doing so will also enable an evidence-based decision-making approach and more efficient distribution of resources across mission areas.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, DOL is working to:\n\nAdd enterprise-standard predictive analytics and reporting capabilities to its IT platform\n\nImplement enterprise data management capabilities\n\nEnhance the application programming interface and public-facing data portal to ensure timely, secure delivery of information to the right DOL staff and customers\n\nIntegrate duplicative data services to reduce associated operations, maintenance, and human capital expenses\n\nSecuring economic reports and worker protections against cyber threats\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL): Enhancing security of DOL data and applications\n\nInvestment start: July 2023.\n\nChallenge: DOL users currently access critical services and data, such as economic reports, retirement plan violation complaints, and worker protections, through a traditional “castle and moat” approach that focuses on external threats. DOL recognizes the critical role of a trust-based modern architecture in protecting its millions of stakeholders, securing its digital assets against cyber threats, and allowing access only to authorized users—in the office, on the road, or at home.\n\nApproach: DOL is currently enhancing the security of its data and applications through the implementation of an enterprise zero trust architecture. With TMF support, DOL is accelerating the implementation and deployment of a secure access service edge solution to provide connectivity, consistent security, and optimized user experience to its employees, partners, and the public.\n\nFaster permanent labor certifications and smoother immigrant visa processing\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL): PERM visa modernization\n\nInvestment start: August 2022.\n\nChallenge: Annually, DOL processes nearly 120,000 requests for permanent labor certifications (PERM) across 73,000 unique employers. Processing delays can affect the worker’s ability to remain in the U.S. and the employer’s ability to retain skilled talent. Employers face a fragmented sign-in and verification process that requires manual staff workarounds and mailed documents. This system causes inconsistent case processing times, unnecessary administrative costs, and fraud and security risks.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, DOL is transforming three processes:\n\nFor PERM filers to submit applications\n\nFor PERM analysts to review applications\n\nTo submit PERM labor certification decisions to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of State\n\nTo do this, DOL is working to:\n\nEliminate manual and paper-based processes, reducing the adjudication cycle time by about 45 days, with an annual cost savings of $1.5 million for PERM filers and an annual cost avoidance of $2.2 million\n\nIntegrate a new PERM labor certification process into DOL’s Foreign Labor Application Gateway digital platform, which uses Login.gov and enables secure and efficient sharing of labor certification data between agencies\n\nEnable DOL PERM analysts to create and issue correspondence to filers, automate the audit selection process for integrity reviews, and access data that protects job seekers\n\nStreamlining support for injured workers\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL): Ensuring injured and ill workers receive services and benefits faster\n\nInvestment start: April 2024.\n\nChallenge: The Integrated Federal Employee Compensation System (iFECS) allows all federal agencies to file claims. iFECs, operated by DOL’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP), is the backbone and system of record for the Disability Management Portal (DMP) and Employees’ Compensation Operations and Management Portal (ECOMP). The system provides services to more than 2.5 million workers, with over 200,000 new cases processed in FY23. It was built nearly 20 years ago and consists of 98 applications running on legacy architecture, with elaborate and archaic workflows. This adds significant friction to case management which can overwhelm claims examiners, delay processing, and interrupt tasks. This project will mitigate the cybersecurity, operational, and financial risks of processing sensitive federal employee health records and annual claims.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, DOL will:\n\nReduce claim adjudication time and improve customer interactions to enable beneficiaries to receive proper services and return to work faster\n\nProvide robust modern cybersecurity controls that increase the security of beneficiary health data\n\nAdopt a modern cloud-based architecture and incrementally deploy automated features and workflows\n\nHelping employees obtain benefits they’ve earned\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (DOL-EBSA): Improving ability of America’s workers to find lost retirement benefits\n\nInvestment start: November 2023.\n\nChallenge: EBSA helps over 153 million workers, retirees, and their families who are covered by private employment retirement plans, group health plans, and other welfare benefit plans that together hold approximately $12.8 trillion in assets. Balancing proactive enforcement and compliance assistance, EBSA helps plan participants and beneficiaries understand their benefits and rights under the law and connects them to lost or forgotten retirement benefits. Since 2021, EBSA has recovered more than $4.2 billion for such “missing” participants. In addition to EBSA’s existing efforts, Congress enacted the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act 2.0 in 2022. It requires EBSA to establish an online public “lost and found” registry, which would allow individuals to search for unclaimed retirement savings and benefits.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, EBSA will establish an online public “lost and found” registry, which will:\n\nServe as a centralized location for workers and their beneficiaries to search for their unclaimed, lost, or forgotten retirement savings and benefits and get information on how to obtain them\n\nEnable EBSA to meet the Congressional deadline to make the portal available to the public by January 1, 2025\n\nSafer identity management for engaging foreign partners\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS): Increasing capacity to safeguard identity data\n\nInvestment start: May 2024.\n\nChallenge: DOS relies on maintaining trust for diplomatic interactions with foreign governments and partners. DOS leadership and IT system users face significant challenges with the current environment of multiple, unsynchronized Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) systems. User management occurs at the system level which has led to disjointed identity management efforts across the State enterprise. Many of the systems do not use phishing-resistant multifactor authentication, which helps prevent unauthorized use by adding an additional layer of user authentication. From an enterprise perspective, this decentralized environment creates a significant vulnerability that advanced, persistent threat actors seek to exploit.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, DOS will use zero trust architecture to:\n\nCreate a consolidated identity trust that manages identity and access in one place\n\nAutomate onboarding and off-boarding workflows\n\nThis investment will:\n\nProvide agency users with a consistent credential management experience\n\nStrengthen DOS’ ability to uphold information security standards\n\nEnsure compliance with federal mandates for ICAM\n\nEmpowering staff to better serve global diplomacy with GenAI\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS): Increasing diplomacy through generative AI\n\nInvestment start: May 2024.\n\nChallenge: In the fast-paced realm of global diplomacy, every moment counts. DOS operates more than 270 diplomatic posts worldwide. In 2023 alone, DOS produced an average of 6,300 diplomatic cables daily, alongside countless media summaries and structured reports. To achieve this, DOS’ staff sift through high volumes of data, including news reports, trade analyses, diplomatic communications, and more.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, DOS will scale safe, secure, and responsible generative AI (GenAI) to allow its staff to rapidly filter insights from the DOS data environment. DOS will use human-centered design principles to:\n\nModernize existing processes for seamless integration\n\nCreate responsible GenAI guidance and training\n\nDevelop enterprise-wide and targeted GenAI communications\n\nPrepare an interagency playbook on implementing responsible GenAI across a government organization\n\nThis investment will:\n\nEmpower DOS’ global staff to work faster and easier, with better information\n\nAllow diplomats to focus more on face-to-face engagements in support of American interests\n\nBetter service and consumer protection for air travelers\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (DOT): Protecting aviation consumers and streamlining regulated entity interactions through human-centered design\n\nInvestment start: September 2023.\n\nChallenge: During COVID-19, the number of aviation consumer complaints increased dramatically, with 400% more complaints in 2022 than the average number of complaints received in each of the five years prior to the pandemic. This highlights the urgent need for a system that better serves consumers, automates processing tasks, streamlines operations, and provides staff with better tools. DOT’s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection (OACP) needs an updated consumer complaint and case tracking application that collects, analyzes, and stores data received from airlines, ticket agents, and airports.\n\nApproach: This investment will allow for better support for air travelers and better enforce aviation consumer protection requirements, like tarmac delays, non-discrimination, denied boarding due to oversale, baggage issues, refunds, and reimbursements due to flight delays and cancellations.\n\nWith TMF support, OACP is working to:\n\nStreamline and personalize consumer complaint submission and increase automation\n\nCreate intuitive tools for the aviation industry that reduce manual steps, increase analyst efficiency, and expedite data publication\n\nEnsure security and privacy protection of aviation consumer data\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (DOT-FAA): Improving mission support with modernized applications\n\nInvestment start: April 2023.\n\nChallenge: FAA seeks to modernize its legacy applications used to deliver mission support, which rely on outdated technologies and frameworks.

It also manages a portfolio for over 43 million existing borrowers. Using StudentAid.gov, FSA borrowers learn about, apply for, and manage their federal student aid. Currently, borrowers cannot review all activities –including form submissions and status– in a single location, and their loan information is spread across FSA and federal loan servicer sites. As a result, borrowers are unsure where to find their loan information and next steps. In one year alone, FSA’s contact centers received 700,000 calls about applications or case status.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, FSA will:\n\nCentralize and merge loan information under the My Activity feature on StudentAid.gov\n\nImplement data and software technology that will lower agency costs over time\n\nThis investment will:\n\nIncrease the borrowers’ ability to manage their federal student aid\n\nLower customer care calls, wait times, emails, and chats\n\nSave FSA customer care costs each year\n\nSecuring student and borrower data\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION (ED): Zero trust architecture\n\nInvestment start: September 2021.\n\nChallenge: An increasingly hostile cyber threat environment makes it crucial for the Department of Education to update its security approach.\n\nApproach: With TMF support, ED is working to:\n\nStand up an enterprise-wide program management office dedicated to zero trust\n\nEnable a zero trust program that includes strategy, architecture, design, and an implementation roadmap\n\nEstablish a catalog of services with secure access service edge and security orchestration, automation, and response technologies\n\nAdopt an advanced architecture across cloud-computing environments\n\nEnabling faster review of cases of employment discrimination\n\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION (EEOC): Charge and case management system modernization\n\nInvestment start: October 2019.\n\nChallenge: EEOC investigates charges of job discrimination. Currently, its charge and case management program runs on an outdated backbone system that relies on expensive proprietary technologies. It requires use of manually entered alphanumeric activity codes, rather than plain language automated workflow, to record case information for the over 200,000 inquiries reviewed by the agency each year.

Across three years, a cross-functional team at GSA employed agile methodologies. GSA:\n\nCreated a set of standard target technologies for all future application migrations\n\nGenerated various playbooks that guided the modernization of ten additional GSA applications and remain accessible to all agencies\n\nThis investment:\n\nAllowed GSA greater flexibility in recruiting talent\n\nIs expected to lower operations costs, improve quality of applications, and establish a repeatable process for modernizing legacy applications that can be used across government\n\nExploring cloud-based authentication and collaboration products\n\nGENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (GSA): MAX.gov transition\n\nInvestment start: September 2021. Final update to TMF Board: April 2023.\n\nChallenge: MAX.gov is a suite of tools that facilitates collaboration, information sharing, data collection, business intelligence, and authentication tools and services. MAX.gov was at a critical juncture in which dozens of agencies relied on the system for mission critical operations, but its outdated technology affected scalability.\n\nApproach & Outcomes: The MAX.gov Transition Project Management Office within GSA’s Technology Transformation Services was charged with creating modern cloud-based authentication and collaboration products for government organizations on a fee-for-service basis.\n\nWith TMF support, GSA reexamined its approach and came to an agreement with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to stop the MAX.gov transition efforts due to unviability as a cost-recoverable service, low desirability in the agency customer marketplace, and infeasibility to build and maintain a custom environment for agency partners. OMB has since worked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to take over the transition effort, and USDA is now hosting MAX.gov for agency partners.\n\nLaying the foundation for human resource functions across government\n\nGENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (GSA): NewPay payroll and work schedule and leave management Software as a Service\n\nInvestment start: February 2019. Final update to TMF Board: July 2021.\n\nChallenge: Federal payroll operations commonly rely on decades-old legacy software, which is costly and difficult to maintain.\n\nApproach & Outcomes: With TMF support, GSA created a minimum viable product using Software as a Service (SaaS). The goal was to lay a new foundation for an enterprise solution for human resource (HR) functions across government, including payroll and work schedule and leave management.\n\nGiven uncertain timing of agency migrations to the new tool and lack of appropriations for planning and migration activities in FY19 and FY20, GSA reduced the scope and funding required for their TMF investment.\n\nBy the end of the project, GSA:\n\nDesigned and configured the NewPay payroll solution for 65 pay plans\n\nCompleted verification testing for 12 of the most common plans, at a reduced cost of less than $8M\n\nStood up initial payroll capabilities for Title 5 employees\n\nProvided a tool that demonstrates how federal HR standards and regulations can be applied for a commercial SaaS solution in a federal environment\n\nModernizing systems that support grant, subsidy, and loan programs\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (HUD): UNISYS mainframe migration\n\nInvestment start: August 2018. Final update to TMF Board: August 2022.\n\nChallenge: Previously, HUD’s mainframe and five most critical business systems were on premises in an antiquated mainframe environment, with COBOL applications that were expensive to maintain. These systems support 30,000 users for over 100 HUD grant, subsidy, and loan programs.\n\nApproach & Outcomes: With TMF support, HUD modernized the codebase to Java and accelerated the migration of these five business systems to the cloud. This investment:\n\nImproved security, reduced infrastructure, and increased shared services with other agencies\n\nEnabled faster completion of functional and technical enhancements due to reduced costs of maintaining and updating the platform\n\nSaves $8 million annually, allowing funds to transform additional legacy systems\n\nSecuring this investment led HUD leadership to allocate additional internal funds to accelerate the project and reduce the amount needed from TMF, while achieving the full outcomes of the original proposal.\n\nSupporting efficient inspection and certification of fruits and vegetables\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA): Agricultural marketing service specialty crops system modernization\n\nInvestment start: January 2020. Final update to TMF Board: March 2023.\n\nChallenge: USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Specialty Crops Inspection Division has billing, inspection, and certificate generation and issuance processes that support inspection and certification of over 10.7 billion pounds of processed fruit and vegetable products and 49.9 billion pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables. This includes fruit and vegetables for school lunches and military combat rations. AMS was managed through a combination of inefficient manual, paper-based processes and outdated legacy IT systems.\n\nApproach & Outcomes: With TMF support, USDA moved to a cloud-based solution that uses existing commercial products and offerings. This system enables AMS Specialty Crops inspectors, frontline managers, and others to securely gather and store field evaluation data, interface with business applications, and process customer order and billing information.\n\nThis investment:\n\nEnsured that perishable agricultural items move more efficiently through the inspection process, for consumers to receive the freshest commodities possible\n\nFacilitated a cultural transformation in the Specialty Crops Inspection program, streamlining, standardizing, and modernizing underlying processes\n\nTMF funding accelerated the project into a single effort, reducing project development and implementation time by an estimated two years.\n\nFor a deep dive on this investment, read our case study.\n\nA shared enrollment process for assistance to farmers and ranchers\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA): Farmers.gov customer experience portal\n\nInvestment start: July 2018. Final update to TMF Board: May 2021.\n\nChallenge: USDA’s farm production and conservation mission area includes the work of the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Both FSA and NRCS provide financial and technical assistance to farmers and ranchers through related conservation programs. In an effort to consolidate systems and improve user experience, USDA aimed to update and modernize conservation financial assistance and payment operations systems across FSA and NRCS.\n\nApproach & Outcomes: With TMF support, USDA:\n\nDeveloped a proof of concept that integrated disparate enrollment processes into a consolidated Farmers.gov citizen experience portal\n\nDocumented both current and proposed processes\n\nIdentified and developed four robotics process operations demonstration tools\n\nMoving USDA’s mission critical applications to the cloud\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA): Infrastructure optimization and cloud adoption\n\nInvestment start: November 2018. Final update to TMF Board: April 2020.\n\nChallenge: In 2018, USDA had mission critical applications with performance issues and security challenges, alongside a decentralized IT infrastructure that was costly to maintain and upgrade. Ten applications were hosted on costly mission area-specific data centers, resulting in poor enterprise adoption of cloud services and lack of expertise to maintain them.\n\nApproach & Outcomes: With TMF support, USDA worked with the GSA Cloud Centers of Excellence, marking the beginning of continuous cloud-enablement across USDA.\n\nThis investment:\n\nMigrated the Emergency Watershed Protection application to the cloud, improving functionality and generating cost savings\n\nConducted application rationalization efforts and set an example of how cloud migration could be tackled across the agency\n\nGenerated buy-in, leading the Food and Nutrition Service to secure internal funding to migrate five applications\n\nEnabled USDA to consolidate and leverage its cloud expertise across the enterprise\n\nDefinitions\n\nProject status:\n\nActive: agency is working toward completing TMF project milestones\n\nInactive: agency has completed their TMF project milestones or ended the project early, and given a final presentation to the Board\n\nTransfer status: percentage of total investment dollars transferred from TMF to the agency\n\nRepayment status: percentage of total expected repayment transferred from the agency to TMF\n\nSchedule delay: whether there is an overall delay in expected final project completion date\n\nCost overruns: whether the project incurred unexpected costs beyond the TMF investment amount\n\nARP funding: whether the investment is made, partially or in full, with American Rescue Plan funding\n\nTotal TMF investment amount: total dollar amount of TMF funds expected to be transferred to the agency incrementally, as project milestones are completed\n\nTMF spend to date (obligated): amount of TMF funds obligated by the receiving agency on the project to date"
