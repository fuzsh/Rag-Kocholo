        "text": "The software, standards, and protocols that form our digital infrastructure are critical to a free and open internet, and much of it has been built by volunteers. But free, public code—which we refer to as open source software—needs regular upkeep and maintenance, just as physical infrastructure does, and because it doesn’t belong to any one person or party, it is no one person’s job to maintain it. Without maintenance, we see the digital equivalent of a crumbling road or a collapsing bridge. Building toward a more diverse and well-funded ecosystem for critical digital infrastructure, the Ford Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation came together in 2018 to fund thirteen research projects that fill gaps in understanding of how digital infrastructure is built, maintained, and sustained.\n\nIn some cases the findings of these projects open up further questions, while in others they suggest interventions that could strengthen community practices.\n\nRead more about the research projects below.\n\n2020 Digital Infrastructure Research RFP\n\nTo continue to advance this agenda, Ford Foundation, Sloan Foundation, Mozilla, Omidyar Network and Open Society Foundations launched a 2020 Digital Infrastructure RFP to further study the maintenance of digital infrastructure. Learn about selected research projects here.\n\nWhat we’ve learned\n\nThe first round of research that began in 2019 asked crucial questions and yielded a number of insights that are helping to advance the field. Read more about the research projects here. Also dig into the research and findings in the reports, one-pagers, and videos. Researchers gathered for a number of convenings in the summer of 2020 to discuss their findings and the importance of this work. Recordings of these convenings can be found here and here.\n\nContact info:\n\n[email protected]\n\nNote: We are not soliciting grant proposals at this time."
