The SANS cloud security and DevSecOps faculty are real-world practitioners with decades of application security experience. The concepts covered in our courses will be applicable to your software security program the day you return to work:\n\nSEC522: Application Security: Securing Web Apps, APIs, and Microservices\n\nSEC540: Cloud Security and DevSecOps Automation\n\nSANS maintains an Application Security CyberTalent Assessment that measures secure coding skills and allow programmers to determine gaps in their knowledge of secure coding and allows buyers to ensure outsourced programmers have sufficient programming skills. Organizations can learn more at https://www.sans.org/cybersecurity-assessments/application-security/\n\nDeveloper Security Awareness Training\n\nThe SANS Security Awareness Developer product provides pinpoint software security awareness training on demand, all from the comfort of your desk. Application security awareness training includes over 30+ modules averaging 7-10 minutes in length to maximize learner engagement and retention. The modules cover the full breadth and depth of topics for PCI Section 6.5 compliance and the items that are important for secure software development.\n\nThe TOP 25 Errors List will be updated regularly and will be posted at both the SANS and MITRE sites\n\nCWE Top 25 Software Errors Site\n\nMITRE maintains the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) web site, with the support of the US Department of Homeland Security's National Cyber Security Division, presenting detailed descriptions of the top 25 Software errors along with authoritative guidance for mitigating and avoiding them. That site also contains data on more than 700 additional Software errors, design errors and architecture errors that can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. CWE Web Site\n\nNearly a dozen software companies offer automated tools that test programs for these errors.\n\nHow Important Are the Top 25 Software Errors?\n\nWe asked several of the participants why they thought this effort was important enough to merit a significant amount of their time and expertise. Here are a few of their answers. More are at the end of the announcement.\n\nJust wanted to commend the depth of the CWE/SANS Top 25. The code examples are particularly excellent. I have asked all my developers to read one of these each day for the next 25 days. I'm taking my own advice as well, and even though I'm still reading some of the \"easy\" ones (like SQL injection), I still find that I am learning new things about old topics.\n\nMark E. Haase\n\n- OpenFISMA Project Manager, Endeavor Systems, Inc.\n\nThe Top 25 provides much needed guidance for software developers focusing on eliminating software security defects in their products. If you're involved with software development at your organization and are looking to improve your product security posture, you need to read this.\n\nRobert Auger\n\n- Co Founder of The Web Application Security Consortium\n\nIt's great to see the CWE/SANS Top 25 list continue to be maintained and mature. Relentlessly spreading the word about the most common security defects in programming is a vital need. The state of security in our software would without a doubt be much improved if everyone who touches software development reads and thoroughly understands this. Kudos.\n\nKenneth R. van Wyk\n\n- KRvW Associates, LLC\n\nContributors to the 2021 CWE Top 25:\n\nIn alphabetical order: Adam Chaudry, Steve Christey Coley, Kerry Crouse, Kevin Davis, Devon Ellis, Parker Garrison, Christina Johns, Luke Malinowski, Rushi Purohit, Becky Powell, David Rothenberg, Alec Summers, and Brian Vohaska.\n\nMembers of the NIST NVD Team that coordinated on the Top 25 include Christopher Turner, Robert Byers, and Vidya Ananthakrishna."
