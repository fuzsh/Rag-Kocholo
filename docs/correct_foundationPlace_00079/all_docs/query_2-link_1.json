        "text": "Critical Software is today celebrating its twentieth anniversary. Established in 1998, when NASA became its very first client, the company has gone on to provide systems and software services for critical applications across the globe.\n\nToday, Critical Software employs more than 600 talented individuals in offices across Portugal, the UK, Germany and other locations throughout the world, working in industries as diverse as aerospace, transport, energy, maritime and defence.\n\nThis year, Critical’s highlights have included achieving its strongest financial results to date and securing an Investors in People silver accreditation, recognising the company’s unique work environment and culture. The company also unveiled new offices in Portugal and, subject to examination and approval from the relevant authorities, announced the formation of a new joint venture with the BMW Group called Critical TechWorks.\n\nGoncalo Quadros, CEO and one of Critical Software’s founders, said: “We have achieved things we could not have imagined when we started our journey. Over twenty intense years, our business and engineering expertise has continued to grow, fuelled by the passion of our people.”\n\n“Our greatest achievement is the unique culture we have shaped, and our talented community that live and breathe it. It is this foundation that has seen us overcome challenges, create new opportunities and, ultimately, build our company. As we celebrate our twenty years, it is the dedication of this community that will continue driving us to even greater success in the future.”\n\nTo celebrate the landmark occasion, Critical has organised parties across all of its offices, including special breakfasts, a range of exciting workshops, employee gifts and lots more besides!\n\nCritical Software's 20th Anniversary"
