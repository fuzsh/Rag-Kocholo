        "text": "Base Knowledge\n\nThe Recommended Basic Knowledge are those that derive from the contents and competences of the curricular units foreseen in the study plan and previously attended by the students and with syllabus contents, competences and techniques inherent to this curricular unit, such as:\n\nIntroduction to Music Technologies;\n\nPhysical Acoustics and Psychoacoustics;\n\nMusical Acoustics and Organology;\n\nHardware Applications.\n\nTeaching Methodologies\n\nThis course unit is practical, enabling the acquisition of a capacity for performance and manipulation of dedicated tools. Each syllabus presented will be followed by a practical exploration, enhancing knowledge from discovery and handling. The evaluation will contemplate the performance and acquisition of knowledge, being measured from a set of proposed practical works. In addition, the performance and operational agility demonstrated in the classes will be considered, valuing not only the autonomy achieved (which results from the evaluation of performance in classes, attendance, interest) but also the weighted average of the practical work proposed and carried out by the students throughout of the semester:\n\naverage of practical work performed: 80%\n\nattendance, punctuality, autonomy: 20%\n\nLearning Results\n\nKnow and know how to use a set of computer applications that allow recording, editing, inserting different effects, mixing and mastering a phonogram. This process presupposes the mastery of the inherent techniques, from the capture to the conclusion of the process, in the form of an audio file mastered in the desired format. To this end, some reference computer applications will be made available (Digital Audio Workstation, effects plug-in and addressing software) that students should know how to use correctly.\n\nProgram\n\n1. THE CONTEMPORARY STUDIO\n\nThe. the contemporary studio: the computer at the center of the action;\n\nB. computer hardware: settings, operating system(s) from the user’s perspective;\n\nç. the concept of DAW (Digital Audio Workstation);\n\nd. communication and interconnection protocols (hardware and/or software: USB, Thunderbolt, MADI, Dante);\n\nand. usage and performance criteria in recording/editing environment (introduction).\n\n2. CAPTURE AND RECORDING\n\nThe. DAW recording: microphone signal; gain adjustment and signal flow definition; dynamic range and headroom setting;\n\nB. editing and mixing of multitrack audio files: fade and crossfade; automation criteria;\n\nç. effects: compression, equalization and reverb. Associated parameters and usage criteria. Plugin concept;\n\nd. Reference DAW: Reaper, Avid Pro Tools and Logic Pro.\n\nCurricular Unit Teachers\n\nGrading Methods\n\nContinuing Evaluation\n\n- Individual and/or Group Work - 80.0%\n\n- Attendance and Participation - 20.0%\n\nInternship(s)\n\nNAO\n\nBibliography\n\nBARTLETT, B., & Bartlett, J.
