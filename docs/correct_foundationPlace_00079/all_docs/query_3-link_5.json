The Focus section below describes what is in and out of scope, and Governance section describes how our operations are consistent with OSSF policies with links to more detailed documents.\n\nSource. Randall Munroe. Licensed under CC BY-NC 2.5\n\nOpen Source Software has long suffered from a \"tragedy of the commons\" problem. Organizations large and small make use of OSS every day, but many projects are struggling for the time, resources and attention they need.\n\nThis is a resource allocation problem - and we can help solve it together. We need ways to connect critical projects we all rely on with organizations that can provide them with support.\n\nWhether it is dedicated help from specialized experts or simply grant money or cloud credits, we recognize that no two projects are the same, and support can come in many shapes. We intend to work with upstream maintainers to understand what help and support they need, and then develop scalable processes to make this help available.\n\nTo the best of our efforts, the goals of the working group are:\n\nIdentify critical open source software (OSS) projects.\n\nSecure those projects.\n\nFor more details, see our MVSR\n\nSecuring Critical Projects: List of Critical Open Source Projects, Components, and Frameworks - current version\n\nLeads: Amir Montazery and Jeff Mendoza\n\nContributors: David Wheeler, Caleb Brown, Michael Scovetta, Georg Kunz, David Edelsohn\n\ncriticality_score - this attempts to estimate criticality using the algorithm described in \"Quantifying Criticality\" by Rob Pike; you can see the Hacker News Discussion. A known challenge is that it emphasizes activity, and some critical projects aren't active.\n\nLead: Caleb Brown\n\nHarvard research - Census II Preliminary Census II\n\npackage-feeds\n\nLead: Caleb Brown\n\npackage-analysis\n\nLead: Caleb Brown\n\nAllstar is now a part of OpenSSF Scorecard\n\nLead: Drives work forward\n\nContributor: Available for taking work and completing\n\nSecuring Critical Projects: List of Critical Open Source Projects, Components, and Frameworks is our current (in progress) list of critical OSS projects.\n\nFor our purposes, a critical OSS project is an OSS project that can have an especially large impact if it has a significant unintentional vulnerability, or if it is subverted in either its source repository or distribution package(s). There are literally millions of open source software (OSS) projects today, making it difficult to create a focused list of \"critical OSS projects\".\n\nThe list of critical OSS projects was developed for the Great MFA Distribution Project by the OpenSSF Securing Critical Projects Working Group (WG). This OpenSSF working group has been specifically working on this problem!\n\nThere are many ways to identify \"critical\" projects, so the Securing Critical Projects WG combined the results of several different analyses (the analyses are also called \"Selection Criteria\"), The WG then used human group review of this combined set of top candidates to create a final defensible list. The analyses (\"selection criteria\") for identifying candidate critical OSS projects included:\n\nOpenSSF Criticality Score: A top OpenSSF criticality score value. This metric prefers projects that are extremely active on specific forges. Such projects are likely to be important (at least to the participants). However, this is not a perfect measure; some projects will score low here and yet be very critical. Also, it currently only considers GitHub-hosted projects. As of 2021-11-23 the projects with the top scores are node, kubernetes, rust, and spark.\n\nCensus Program II: Harvard preliminary analysis, uses SCA & dependency data. This tends to emphasize lower-level libraries that are depended on, transitively, by many.\n\nOSTIF Managed Audit Program: Programs OSTIF has recommended for audit. These were selected earlier from research sources, focusing on securing the most critical projects. You can see the OSTIF Managed Audit Program (MAP25)\n\nTop Google Project: Featured on Google Open Source page and widely adopted.\n\nTop Microsoft Project: Featured on Microsoft Open Source page and widely adopted.\n\nTop Linux Foundation Project: Featured on Linux Foundation Project page and related to supply chains.\n\nSecure Supply Chain Tool: Directly related to supply chain security (identified by WG)\n\nSurvey Response: Response to public survey\n\nLanguage implementation: Identified by community as a widely-used language implementation\n\nCommunity Addition: Separately identified by the community as important.\n\nPreviously subverted: If software has been previously attacked & it made headlines, it must be critical enough to attack.\n\nEvery method for identify critical OSS projects has its strengths and weaknesses; we believe the combination of analysis combined with human review is better than trying to do any one of them. For example, high criticality score tends to emphasize very busy projects; human review can remove projects that are busy but for whatever reason are less critical. Some projects are very important yet not active; by using other measures (not just the OpenSSF criticality score) we can still identify them.\n\nWe have no doubt that other OSS projects will be added to the critical OSS projects list over time. If you're interested in helping to do that, please join the working group.\n\nRelated work to quantitatively identify critical projects\n\nVulnerabilities in the Core: Preliminary Report and Census II of Open Source Software by Frank Nagle, Jessica Wilkerson, James Dana, and Jennifer L.

Having more reported vulnerabilities does not mean that the software is necessarily more vulnerable; it often means that more people are looking for vulnerabilities & that there's a robust process for processing them. However, if so many people are searching for vulnerabilities in a product, that suggests it's an important (critical) project)\n\nOSTIF's list of critical projects for Managed Audit Program (link to more info here.\n\nCore Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Open Source Software Census II Strategy by David A.
