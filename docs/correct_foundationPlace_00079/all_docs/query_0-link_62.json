        "text": "International Workshop on Recent Advances in the DependabIlity AssessmeNt of Complex systEms\n\nCo-located with DSN 2017\n\nCritical systems are becoming more and more complex and heterogeneous, integrating previously\n\nseparate systems and including design solutions ranging from the introduction of software Off\n\nThe Shelf (OTS) to the adoption of loosely-integrated and composable services. Innovative\n\ndependability assessment solutions and certification processes are thus needed to deal with\n\nsuch complexity, calling for new solutions for the efficient, automated, and possibly continuous\n\nassessment and certification.\n\nThe RADIANCE workshop aims to discuss novel dependability assessment approaches for complex\n\nsystems and to promote their adoption in real-world systems through industrial and academic\n\nresearch. RADIANCE aims to promote and foster discussion on novel ideas, constituting a forum\n\nwhere researchers can share both real problems and innovative solutions for the assessment of complex systems.\n\nTopics include, but are not limited to:\n\nSoftware Assessment to cope with increasing System Complexity\n\nAssessment of integrated systems including software OTS and legacy software\n\nAgile development in critical systems: assessment challenges and approaches\n\nNatural language requirements for software design and maintenance\n\nCertification of Complex and integrated Systems\n\nDynamic and evolving systems: new needs for verification, validation and certification\n\nAutomated verification and validation of critical systems\n\nModel-driven approaches for the assessment of dependable and secure systems\n\nDependable and secure cloud systems and virtualized environments\n\nAssessment of micro-services and related applications\n\nThreats and methodologies for the Internet of Things\n\nExperimental assessment of dependability and security\n\nDependable and Secure Services\n\nTools and demos for the assessment of complex systems\n\nOpen issues, practical experiences and real-world case studies\n\nProgram Committee:\n\nLuciana Arantes - University of Pierre et Marie Currie, France\n\nDanilo Ardagna - Politecnico di Milano, Italy\n\nFrancesco Brancati - Resiltech s.r.l., Italy\n\nJavier Camara - Carnegie Mellon University, USA\n\nDavid D'Andres - Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain\n\nBaldoino Fonseca - Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil\n\nValerio Formicola - U. of Illinois, USA\n\nJeremie Guiochet - LAAS-CNRS, France\n\nChristian Kreiner - Graz University of Technology, Austria\n\nPaolo Lollini - University of Florence, Italy\n\nJoao Lourenco - NOVA University of Lisbon, Portugal\n\nFumio Machida - NEC Corporation, Japan\n\nPaulo Maciel - Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil\n\nHenrique Madeira - University of Coimbra, Portugal\n\nIstvan Majzik - Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary\n\nEliane Martins - IC-University of Campinas, Brazil\n\nRegina Moraes - FT-University of Campinas, Brazil\n\nRoberto Natella - CINI/University of Naples, Italy\n\nGanesh Pai - NASA Ames Research Center, USA\n\nSebastiano Peluso - Virginia Tech, USA\n\nNuno Silva - Critical Software S.A., Portugal\n\nVladimir Stankovic - City University of London, UK\n\nOrganization Committee:\n\nAriadne Carvalho, State University of Campinas\n\nNuno Antunes, University of Coimbra\n\nAndrea Ceccarelli, CINI-University of Florence\n\ncontact us at: radiance@devasses.eu"
