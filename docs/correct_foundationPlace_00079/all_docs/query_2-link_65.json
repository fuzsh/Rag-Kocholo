The education should be multidisciplinary, but provide a firm grounding in one or more of the fields that contribute to biotechnology, such as engineering, biophysics, biochemistry, genetics and cell biology. Faculty and students participating in this program should be drawn from several departments, but should have a focus on engineering. The faculty should be conducting research relevant to the understanding and utilization of biological processes for biotechnological applications. In addition to scientific, theoretical and practical knowledge, programs are expected to provide training in communications skills, career development and an understanding of regulatory, commercialization and IP issues in bringing a biotechnology product to the market.

Accordingly, multi-department applications which partner biological sciences with quantitative and computational sciences (e.g., data science, computer science, statistics, mathematics, informatics, engineering) are encouraged. Training should include the use of theory, simulations, data sciences, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other bioinformatics and computational approaches to address the full spectrum of basic research areas in the biomedical sciences, including for example, the fundamentals of analysis and interpretation of molecular sequence and structure, molecular function, cellular function, physiology, genomics, and genetics. In accordance with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science [PDF], training should also include aspects of fair and ethical data use, data sharing, and data security and confidentiality. NIGMS encourages programs to make use of resources and expertise available in the private sector to develop student skills and career paths in areas including efficient computer code development and use of emerging technologies and platforms.\n\nGenetics:\n\nPrograms in this area should emphasize broad, multidisciplinary training in the principles and mechanisms of genetics and related sciences. Training in a variety of areas such as classical genetics, molecular genetics, population and behavioral genetics and developmental genetics should be offered. Programs may also include training and research opportunities in related disciplines such as biochemistry, cell biology and statistics. Programs are generally expected to include faculty members in disciplines other than genetics.\n\nMolecular Biophysics:\n\nPrograms in this area should provide multidisciplinary training that focuses on the application of the concepts and methods of the physical sciences to explain biological function in terms of molecular structure, dynamics, and organization from single molecules to supramolecular structures. These programs should bring together faculty and students from departments such as chemistry, physics, and engineering who have an interest in quantitative, biologically-related research with faculty and students in biological science departments whose orientation is mechanistic and structural biology.\n\nMolecular Medicine:\n\nPrograms in this area should provide training that combines rigorous didactic training in the basic biomedical sciences with exposure to concepts and knowledge underlying the molecular basis of disease. The goal is to train a cadre of scientists prepared to work at the interface of basic biomedical science and clinical research, an area sometimes referred to as translational research. Trainees should have dual mentors in basic and clinical science, and exposure to the concepts of medicine. Training faculty should be broadly drawn from multiple departments and disciplines and thesis research topics should reflect a broad range of interdisciplinary opportunities in the basic biomedical sciences. This training opportunity should be primarily designed for Ph.D. candidates.\n\nPharmacological Sciences:\n\nPrograms in this area should incorporate a quantitative and systems approach to pharmacology. Individuals should receive training that will enable them to conduct research in the development of therapeutic agents. It should also provide training in regulatory sciences that includes the study of pharmacometrics and the principles of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADME-Tox). Thesis research opportunities should be available with faculty members in a variety of disciplines, such as biochemistry, physiology, molecular biology, cell biology, chemistry, medicinal chemistry and toxicology, as well as pharmacology. Students trained in this program should be able to contribute to the design and evaluation of therapeutic agents and strategies based upon the competence they have acquired through specialized training in the pharmacological sciences, both through their individualized research area and their understanding and being conversant with the overall drug discovery and development process.\n\nSystems and Integrative Biology:\n\nPrograms in this area should provide training directed toward building the broad research competence required to investigate the integrative, regulatory and developmental processes of higher organisms and the functional components of these processes. The training program should bring together varied resources, approaches and thesis research opportunities with faculty mentors of such disciplines/departments as physiology, biomedical engineering, the behavioral sciences, biochemistry, systems biology and cell and developmental biology. Graduates of the program should be well versed in quantitative approaches to biology.\n\nTrans-Departmental Basic Biomedical Sciences:\n\nPrograms in this area should support training in two or more of the T32 areas listed above, or may include other emerging area(s) within the NIGMS mission. The intent is to support a program in multiple disciplines with common training objectives and core courses or training activities that are specifically designed to achieve the transdisciplinary objectives.\n\nTraining in the transdisciplinary area is designed to increase efficiencies and broaden the scope and geographic distribution of NIGMS training funds and is open only to:\n\ninstitutions that currently do not have an NIGMS-funded institutional predoctoral T32 training program including MSTP (with the exception of Behavioral-Biomedical Sciences Interface or Biostatistics), or\n\ninstitutions with current NIGMS-funded predoctoral T32 training programs that propose to merge two or more of their existing NIGMS-funded predoctoral training programs in basic biomedical sciences disciplines into a single program.\n\nMedical Scientist Training Program (MSTP, leading to combined clinical and research doctorate degrees):\n\nThe MSTP supports the integrated dual degree training that leads to the award of both clinical (that is, M.D., D.O., D.V.M., D.D.S., Pharm.D., etc.) and research doctorate degrees (Ph.D.) that implements effective and evidence-informed approaches. With the dual qualification of rigorous scientific research and clinical practice, graduates will be equipped with the skills to develop research programs that accelerate the translation of research advances to the understanding, detection, treatment, and prevention of human disease, and to lead the advancement of biomedical research. MSTP assures selected trainees a choice of a wide range of pertinent graduate programs in the biological, chemical, and physical sciences that, when combined with training in medicine, lead to a dual degree. Programs are encouraged to provide a breadth of doctoral research training opportunities consistent with individual institutional strengths. In addition to the above disciplines, support of trainees in other disciplines such as computer sciences, social and behavioral sciences, economics, epidemiology, public health, bioengineering, biostatistics, and bioethics is encouraged. Proposed MSTP programs should be flexible and adaptable in providing each trainee with the appropriate background in the sciences relevant to medicine yet be rigorous enough to enable graduates to function independently in both basic research and clinical investigation.\n\nLeading Equity and Diversity in the Medical Scientist Training Program (LEAD MSTP, leading to the combined clinical and Ph.D. degrees):\n\nThe Leading Equity and Diversity in the Medical Scientist Training Program is part of NIH’s efforts to broaden participation of institution types with NIH funded dual-degree training programs (i.e., a Ph.D. combined with a clinical degree, such as M.D., D.O., D.V.M., D.D.S., Pharm.D., etc.) and have historically not been well represented among NIGMS-funded MSTPs.\n\nThis program is limited to dual-degree training programs at (1) Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), (2) Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and (3) institutions within Institutional Development Award (IDeA)-eligible states. When appropriate, NIGMS encourages applications using a partnership model to further and advance the goals of the program.\n\nThese awards support the development of outstanding academic physician-scientists in the areas of anesthesiology, clinical pharmacology, innate immunity, inflammation, sepsis, and trauma and burn injury. They provide support for a period of 3 to 5 years of supervised research and study to clinically trained professionals who have the commitment and potential to develop into productive, independent investigators.\n\nThe F32 fellowship is for individuals who seek postdoctoral research training in areas related to the scientific programs of the institute.\n\nRequests for general information about individual postdoctoral fellowships at NIGMS should direct inquiries to:\n\nFor postdoctoral fellowship information specific to the NIGMS scientific divisions listed below, contact the indicated program officer:\n\nGenetics and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology\n\nApplicant's grant number last digit 0-2: contact Dr. Xu\n\nApplicant's grant number last digit 3-5​: contact Dr. Sesma\n\nApplicant's grant number last digit 6-9: contact Dr. Rigas​\n\nRequests for general information about institutional postdoctoral training awards should be directed to:\n\nNIGMS staff members who manage specific training programs are listed below.\n\nAnesthesiology\n\nPrograms should provide multidisciplinary research training to help develop individuals with the skills and expertise to explore problems relevant to anesthesiology, including the fundamental mechanisms of anesthetic action. The goal is to provide rigorous postdoctoral research training with an emphasis on hypothesis-driven laboratory or clinical research. Trainees, most of whom would hold the M.D. degree, will be expected to spend at least 2 years in the training program and should have the opportunity to acquire fundamental knowledge and research techniques in such disciplines as biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, molecular biology, neurobiology, pharmacology or physiology. For trainees with the Ph.D. degree, the research and training should be specifically designed to promote a research career addressing problems in anesthesiology.\n\nClinical Pharmacology\n\nIndividuals in these training programs should receive experience in the methodology and in the conduct of clinical and basic research to qualify them to investigate the effects and mechanisms of drug actions in humans. Trainees, who would usually have the M.D. degree, should have the opportunity to acquire fundamental scientific knowledge and learn research techniques in areas such as basic pharmacology, biochemistry, physiology, biostatistics and other biomedical subdisciplines.\n\nMedical Genetics\n\nTraining programs should provide advances and specialized research training in the principles of genetics with the goal of understanding human genetic disorders. Trainees should be drawn from diverse backgrounds and should be offered opportunities for conducting research with faculty who represent a variety of approaches to genetics ranging from molecular genetics to human population genetics. For holders of the M.D. or other professional degrees, the program should provide training and research opportunities in areas of basic genetics. This training should build on, and complement, the trainee's clinical background. For holders of the Ph.D. degree, the research and training should emphasize the application of the trainee's basic genetics background to problems in human and medical genetics.\n\nInjury and Critical Illness\n\nSupport for multidisciplinary research training is offered to individuals holding the M.D. or Ph.D. degree who seek to improve the understanding of the body's systemic responses to major injury and to foster the more rapid application of this knowledge to the treatment of trauma and burn-injured victims and/or critically ill patients. The supervisory staff of the training program should include trauma surgeons, burn specialists and critical care specialists as well as basic scientists. Trainees, most of whom would hold the M.D. degree, will be expected to spend at least 2 years in the training program and to apply such basic disciplines as physiology, biochemistry, immunology, microbiology, cell biology, molecular biology, biomedical engineering or behavioral sciences to the study of injury and/or critical illness.\n\nThese awards provide institutional support to partnerships between a research-intensive university and one or more partner institutions that have a historical mission and a demonstrated commitment to providing training, encouragement, and assistance to students from population groups underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce. The grant supports postdoctoral trainees who are engaged in cutting-edge research at the research-intensive university and who also participate in teaching at a partner institution, thus helping improve the research environment and also providing diversity in courses available to students at these institutions.\n\nThe IPERT supports creative and innovative research educational activities designed to complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation's biomedical research needs. Each IPERT program must address the NIGMS goals of creating a highly skilled and diverse biomedical workforce. The programs can be designed to support stages of research career development from the undergraduate to the faculty level and must be ancillary or complementary to those research training and research education programs in which they currently participate, regardless of the source of support. While the balance of activities in a single application may vary, an IPERT application must effectively integrate two core elements: courses/workshops for skills development and mentoring activities.\n\nThis program is intended to enable and encourage the scientific community to create and disseminate training modules that will effectively contribute to the advancement of the biomedical research workforce. NIGMS intends to fund training modules in distinct subject areas that are currently relevant to biomedical scientists. The subject topics are described through “Notices of Special Interest (NOSI)” published annually the “Related Notices” section of the notice of funding opportunity.\n\nThe senior fellowships (F33) are for established independent investigators.\n\nRequests for general information about the senior fellowships supported by NIGMS should be directed to:\n\nThis program provides support for both mentored and independent research from the same award. The award provides up to 5 years of support consisting of two phases: the initial phase (K99) provides 1-2 years of mentored support to highly promising, postdoctoral research scientists, followed by up to 3 years of independent support (R00) contingent on the scientist securing an independent research position. Applications are accepted for research and training aligned with the NIGMS research priorities. NIGMS encourages postdoctoral trainees to apply by their third year of postdoctoral training.\n\nThe Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers (MOSAIC) program is part of NIH’s efforts to enhance diversity within the academic biomedical research workforce, and is designed to facilitate the transition of promising postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds, for example individuals from groups underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce at the faculty level, into independent research-intensive faculty careers. The program has two components: an institutionally-focused research education cooperative agreement (UE5) and an individual postdoctoral career transition award (K99/R00) to enhance diversity. The objective of the MOSAIC Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity (K99/R00) is to enhance workforce diversity by facilitating a timely transition of promising postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds (e.g., see Notice of NIH’s Interest in Diversity) from their mentored, postdoctoral research positions to independent, tenure-track or equivalent research-intensive faculty positions.\n\nThe NIGMS Postdoctoral Research Associate Training (PRAT) Program’s overarching goal is to provide high quality postdoctoral research training in the basic biomedical sciences to a diverse group of postdoctoral fellows in NIH Intramural research laboratories, and to prepare them for leadership positions in biomedical careers. Research projects proposed should focus on areas within the NIGMS mission. In addition to the laboratory experience, the PRAT program provides a structured training environment with extensive career and professional development, mentoring, and networking opportunities planned and supported by the program.\n\nThe purpose of this program is to support research that will enhance the evidence base for effective, high-impact, scalable interventions, and to improve our understanding of the factors contributing to success, including the social and behavioral factors, involved in the advancement of individuals pursuing independent academic biomedical research careers. Investigators may also apply for the Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) (R35) in this research area.\n\nThis program is jointly supported by NIGMS and the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Science of Science: Discovery, Communication, and Impact in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).\n\nThe SoS:BIO program supports a portfolio of research to provide scientific analysis of important aspects of the biomedical research enterprise and efforts to foster a diverse, innovative, productive and efficient scientific workforce from which future research discoveries and scientific leaders will emerge.​\n\nThese awards support the career development of quantitatively trained investigators from the postdoctoral level to the senior faculty level who make a commitment to basic or clinical biomedicine, bioengineering or bioimaging research that is relevant to the NIH mission.\n\nNRMN is developing a national network of motivated and skilled mentors from various disciplines linked to mentees across the country–both from BUILD institutions and elsewhere–for individuals at the undergraduate to early career faculty levels and spanning biomedical disciplines relevant to the NIH mission. It is also developing best practices and training opportunities for mentors, as well as networking and professional development opportunities for mentees. NRMN is a part of the NIH Common Fund consortium Enhancing the Diversity of the NIH-Funded Workforce. Consortium contact: Alison Gammie.\n\nThe CEC coordinates activities and will evaluate the efficacy of the training and mentoring approaches developed by BUILD and NRMN awardees. These findings will have implications for recruiting, training and mentoring of diverse groups nationwide, and the CEC will disseminate effective approaches to the broader research and mentoring communities. CEC is a part of the NIH Common Fund consortium Enhancing the Diversity of the NIH-Funded Workforce. Consortium contact: Alison Gammie.\n\nThis NIH-wide program provides supplemental funds to principal investigators holding NIGMS research grants, to improve the diversity of the research workforce by supporting and recruiting students and postdoctoral fellows from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities and individuals from economically or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds that have inhibited their ability to pursue a career in health-related research.\n\nThis NIH-wide program provides supplemental funds for career development (K) or first-time research project grant (RPG) awardees whose progress is likely to be hindered by a critical life event such as childbirth, adoption, or primary caregiving responsibility for an ailing immediate family member."
