        "text": "Location intelligence is the insight gained from visualizing and analyzing geospatial data. Layering location-specific data—such as demographics, traffic, environment, economics, and weather—on a smart map or dashboard reveals unique insights. Leaders use location intelligence to better understand where and why things are happening and plan what to do next.\n\nRevealing risks and solutions\n\nIn this example near Miami, mapping data reveals where older adults live in buildings (in yellow) susceptible to flooding (in purple).\n\nDecision-makers have access to unprecedented amounts of business data. Putting that data in the context of location is how we make sense of it and put it to work. Location is the common thread connecting disparate data sources and breaking down silos.\n\nCreating real-time awareness\n\nBuilding digital twins of systems or networks, like this example of the Port of Rotterdam, uncovers opportunities to increase operational efficiency.\n\nThe challenges we face in business and government are tied to location. Geography pulls together all key information about issues such as infrastructure modernization, sustainability, climate change, environmental management, and social equity.\n\nMapping our changing world\n\nSea surface temperature is one example of a key indicator that can be mapped to understand climate change impacts and inform severe storm prediction.\n\nLocation intelligence is made possible by geographic information system (GIS) technology, which allows users to manage, visualize, and analyze geospatial data. Location intelligence software—such as GIS smart maps, apps, and dashboards—makes it easy to share location-based insights with executives and decision-makers. Analysts and data scientists use sophisticated location technology as an essential business intelligence tool to combine and investigate all kinds of data."
