His main research interests focus on experimental evaluation of dependable computing systems, including security evaluation and benchmarking, focusing on a wide range of systems, including CPS. He has participated in tens of projects funded by the European Commission and by the Portuguese Government and coordinated several of those projects. He was Vice-Chair of the IFIP Working Group 10.4 Special Interest Group on Dependability Benchmarking from the establishment of the group in 1999 until 2002. He was Program Co-Chair of the IEEE/IFIP DSN-PDS 2004 and LADC 2009, Conference Coordinator of the IEEE/IFIP DSN 2008, and has organized several Workshops and scientific events. Henrique Madeira also served as Vice-Rector at the University of Coimbra from 2009 to 2013 and was co-founder of the company Critical Software, SA.\n\nDependable Industrial Internet of Things\n\nThursday, April 12, 9:00AM, PÃ¡tio das NaÃ§Ãµes\n\nðŸ“· photos\n\nSpeaker biography:\n\nChenyang Lu is the Fullgraf Professor at Washington University in St. Louis. His research interests include Internet of Things, embedded real-time systems, and cyber-physical systems. Professor Lu's current work focuses on real-time cloud, industrial cyber-physical systems and Internet of Medical Things. In the area of real-time cloud, he led the development of RT-Xen, a real-time hypervisor scheduler that has been incorporated in the popular Xen hypervisor. In the area of industrial cyber-physical systems, his research advanced real-time wireless networks and cyber-physical co-design for dependable wireless control systems. In the area of Internet of Medical Things, he piloted one of the world's first large-scale wireless sensor networks for clinical monitoring. Professor Lu served as Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks from 2011 to 2017 and currently chairs the IEEE Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems (TCRTS). He received the Ph.D. degree from University of Virginia in 2001. He is a Fellow of IEEE.\n\nFrom Rags to Riches - Distributed Economic Model Predictive Control in Industry 4.0\n\nFriday, April 13, 9:00AM, PÃ¡tio das NaÃ§Ãµes\n\nðŸ“· photos\n\nSpeaker biography:\n\nFrank AllgÃ¶wer is director of the Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control and professor in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
