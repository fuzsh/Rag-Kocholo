        "text": "Portugal, with its competitive talent pool, notable quality, capability and cost advantages, has become an obvious partner for Airbus.\n\nEstablished on 1 January 2022, as a wholly owned Airbus subsidiary, Airbus Atlantic is a new global player, number 2 in the aerostructures field with 13,000 employees in 5 countries and 3 continents. Airbus Atlantic has a plant in Santo Tirso, referred to as Airbus Atlantic Portugal, near Porto. It is specialized in fuselage metallic sub-assembly activities for the Airbus A350 and the A320 Family, with already more than 100 employees and is continuously growing.\n\nWhen Airbus identified the need to create a new centralised, specialised Global Business Service Centre, Lisbon in Portugal came out as the clear \"hotspot\" for Europe fulfilling all the requirements: available experts/talents, demonstrated local GBS industry footprint, accessible, attractive, stable, GDPR compatible and a favorable labour environment.\n\nAirbus Global Business Services (Airbus GBS) operations started in July 2021. Headquartered in Lisbon, Airbus Portugal S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Airbus SAS, already has more than 850 experts at work on managing administrative, transactional, reporting and IT services, mainly in support of Airbus' Finance, HR, Procurement, IM, Engineering, Communication, Customer Services, Legal and Compliance.\n\nAs a centre of excellence under the full control of Airbus in Europe, Airbus GBS ensures control and security of our critical data and processes. By mutualising services in a single organisation cross-divisions, Airbus GBS will align company standards worldwide, connect processes end-to-end and coordinate tools in order to improve the efficiency of support services. It will deliver sustainable quality of service and increase the internal customers’ experience through operational excellence and long-term cost efficiency.\n\nAirbus continues to increase its direct local footprint through its subsidiaries, Airbus GBS in Lisbon and Airbus Atlantic in Santo Tirso, and its supply chain with the continuous successful deployment of numerous suppliers. Over the last 3 years, Airbus has been expanding its cooperation with Portugal, identifying new areas of work to build on. Thanks to this fruitful and collaborative work, Portugal is now building a real cluster of Tier 1 & 2 Aerospace companies with a reputation for a highly educated and reliable workforce.\n\nCurrently, out of 70 Portuguese aerospace companies, over half provide products and services for Airbus production and support, research and development, and a broad range of services that support Airbus operations. Airbus procurement in Portugal is ramping up with an expansion in the range of goods and services sourced from the country.\n\nAirbus’ trusted suppliers, Mecachrome and Lauak Group, have both recently invested in new factories locally, which combined with the indigenous supply chain, such as OGMA, Caetano and Critical Software, led to the emerge of Portugal as a new European Aerospace Industrial hub.\n\nPortuguese industry is moving closer to international aerospace projects, serving the country’s national interests with high-value jobs creation and reinforcing the common European Defence industrial base.\n\nAirbus works hand in hand with Portuguese companies on multiple European Research and Development projects.\n\nPASSARO (caPAbilities for innovative Structural and functional teSting of AeROstructures) is a EU Clean Sky 2 project started in July 2016. It comprises eleven partners from Portugal and Spain working in close collaboration with Airbus Defence and Space pursuing common technology objectives, such as the promotion of the innovation of the Aircraft Industry at European level.\n\nThe research and technology project FUSE-IT, led by Airbus CyberSecurity, is a European cluster for software innovation and is part of the EUREKA programme, an intergovernmental network for Research & Development & Innovation (R&D&I) cooperation, involving Portugal and other countries globally. Airbus CyberSecurity and its partners have developed the so-called Smart Secured Building System that links four typically independent building management modules such as energy, facilities, ICT and security. The technology has been successfully tested in the Centro Hospital São João (CHSJ), Portugal, one of the FUSE-IT partners.\n\nThe EU Horizon 2020 project SATIE (Security of Air Transport Infrastructures of Europe) kicked-off in May 2019, in Porto, at ISEP-GECAD premises – the largest unit of the School of Engineering of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto, which takes an important part in the project. The project aims at improving cyber-physical attack resilience of European airports paving the way to a new generation of Security Operation Centre that will be included in a comprehensive airport security policy. Airbus CyberSecurity, Portugal and 9 other European nations are working on the project today.\n\nAirbus counts three major Portuguese customers and operators: Tap Air Portugal, Hi Fly and SATA Azores Airlines.\n\nTAP Air Portugal was one of the very first customers for Airbus when the airline took delivery of their first A310 airplane in 1988. Today, Airbus is Portugal’s leading provider of commercial aircraft with a total in-service fleet of over 100 aircraft operating an all-Airbus fleet (including Azores Airlines and Hi-Fly).\n\nTAP alone flies over 80 Airbus aircraft and still has 24 new Airbus aircraft to be delivered in the coming years. With a comprehensive portfolio of A319, A320ceo/neo, A321neo, A330ceo/neo models, TAP benefits from a guaranteed product commonality of Airbus aircraft family.\n\nIn the frame of its fleet renewal and modernization program, TAP became the launch operator of the new generation widebody A330neo, renowned for its unbeatable operating economics, increased range and new Airspace comfortable cabin for passengers. In November 2018, A330neo entered TAP’s operational service, significantly expanding its network of long-haul routes. TAP was also one of the first airlines to operate the A321LR on transatlantic routes, enhancing its capabilities on the mid-market, saving 25-30% fuel compared to previous generation aircraft.\n\nAirbus and Hi Fly, the leading wide-body aircraft wet lease specialist, have been closely working together since 2006. Operated by two affiliated airlines in Portugal and Malta, Hi-Fly has an all-Airbus aircraft portfolio comprising the A320ceo, A330neo and A340.\n\nAzores Airlines, the SATA Group airline operating in the Autonomous Region of the Azores, is an Airbus customer comprising an Airbus fleet of A320ceo/neo, A321neo families, flying international routes."
