The funding runs over five years from 1 July 2023.\n\nThe funding supports projects. These projects address the physical and social impacts of disasters on our communities. Disasters that can be caused by climate change and other natural hazards.\n\nHow are we involved?\n\nWe administer the DRF. We do this in partnership with states and territory government agencies responsible for emergency management.\n\nWe consult with stakeholders to develop the guidelines for each DRF round.\n\nWe establish the application process.\n\nWe support the assessment of applications by an expert panel.\n\nWe manage the process to establish funding agreements. These agreements are between states and territories and the Australian Government.\n\nWe work with states and territory Lead Agencies on project reporting requirements.\n\nDRF objectives\n\n1. Increasing the understanding of natural hazard disaster impacts. Using this understanding to reduce disaster impacts in the future.\n\n2. Increasing the resilience, adaptability, and preparedness of:\n\nGovernments,\n\ncommunity groups and,\n\naffected communities, to reduce impact of natural hazards and avert disasters.\n\n3. Reducing the exposure to risk, harm and/or severity of a natural hazard’s impacts including:\n\nreducing the recovery burden for governments,\n\ncohorts at a higher disaster risk,\n\nand/or affected communities.\n\nFor more detail on our objectives, please read our Program Guidelines under key documentation below.\n\nDisaster Ready Fund Round One - funding delivered\n\nRound One provided $200 million of Australian Government investment for 187 projects in 2023-24.\n\nSuccessful projects under Round One of the DRF were announced on 7 June 2023.
