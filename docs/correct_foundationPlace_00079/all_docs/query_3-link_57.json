        "text": "Effective anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) policies and measures are key to the integrity and stability of the international financial system and member countries’ economies. Money laundering (ML) and related underlying crimes (the so-called “predicate offenses” or “predicate crimes”), as well as terrorist financing (TF) and the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or proliferation financing (PF) are crimes with economic effects—they can threaten the integrity and stability of a country’s financial sector and a country’s external stability more generally. They can result in destabilizing “hot money” resulting from inflows and outflows, as well as in banking crises, ineffective revenue collection, broader governance weaknesses, reputational risks for international financial centers, and loss of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs). In an increasingly interconnected world, the harm done by these crimes is global, affecting the integrity and stability of the international financial system. AML/CFT policies and measures are designed to prevent and combat these crimes and are essential to protect the integrity and stability of financial markets and the global financial system.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the Fund has helped shape AML/CFT policies globally, and within its members’ national frameworks. Financial integrity issues are covered (as relevant) in all of the Fund’s functions: surveillance, lending, and capacity development. Staff gives policy advice on macro-critical AML/CFT issues in in Article IV consultations, covers AML/CFT issues relevant to the financial sector’s soundness and stability as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs), and inputs into the design and implementation of financial integrity-related measures in Fund-supported programs. The Fund also has an extensive capacity development program on AML/CFT and delivers bilateral, regional, and thematic technical assistance to the membership. Further, the Fund also actively contributes to the global AML/CFT architecture, through participation in standard setting and assessment of countries against the international AML/CFT standards, coordination in CD delivery, and collaborations on policy dialogue and analytical work. The IMF’s work on AML/CFT is guided by its AML/CFT strategy which is reviewed by IMF’s Executive Board on a five- year policy review cycle. The 2023 Review of the AML/CFT Strategy was endorsed by the Executive Board of the IMF in November 2023.\n\nWhat is ML/TF/PF?\n\nWhile Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing activities differ in many ways, they often exploit the same vulnerabilities in financial systems and the broader economy that allow for anonymity and opacity in transactions.\n\nMoney Laundering is the processing of assets from criminal activity to obscure their illegal origins. The money laundering offense should apply to all serious offenses, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offenses. At a minimum, it should apply to the 21 categories of offenses designated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in its glossary, including, inter alia, participation in organized crime, fraud, drug trafficking, corruption and bribery, and tax crimes.\n\nTerrorism Financing involves the raising and processing of funds to supply terrorists with resources. While ML and TF differ in many ways, they often exploit the same vulnerabilities in financial systems that allow for an inappropriate level of anonymity and opacity in the execution of financial transactions.\n\nFinancing of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destructions is a requirement on countries to implement targeted financial sanctions to comply with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions on the proliferation of WMD and its financing. This requirement is similar in its approach to the targeted financial sanctions applicable in the context of the fight against terrorism and terrorism financing but has a narrower application: it addresses exclusively the freezing without delay of funds or other assets of persons or entities designated by the UNSC as being involved in illicit proliferation of WMD and domestic cooperation."
