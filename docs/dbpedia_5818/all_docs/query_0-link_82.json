        "text": "Greg Joseph\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n9 min read\n\n·\n\nDec 14, 2019\n\n--\n\n(When a British documentary miniseries titled “Unknown Chaplin: The Master at Work” aired, I contacted actor-comedian Dick Van Dyke, a student of film comics and close friend of Stan Laurel of the legendary early-movie comedy team Laurel and Hardy, for his insights. The observations by Van Dyke, who starred in a critically praised Carl Reiner movie, “The Comic,” said to be loosely based on Buster Keaton, and perhaps Laurel, are timeless. From September 1983.)\n\nBy Gregory N. Joseph\n\nNINETY-FOUR YEARS after Charlie Chaplin’s birth and six years after his death, his greatest cinematic creation — The Little Tramp, that rumpled but beloved Everyman — remains a curiosity to audiences and critics alike.\n\nTo this day, Chaplin’s appeal continues to intrigue, as suggested in an interview with actor Dick Van Dyke, a film devotee and comedian who perhaps more than any other contemporary performer is most closely identified with silent film comedy.\n\nVan Dyke, the popular, rubber-faced, pratfalling inciter of guffaws on Broadway and the big and small screens, morphed into a pensive, serious student of what makes for funny in a wide-ranging discussion about film humor, discussing comics from Chaplin and his friend Stan Laurel to Richard Pryor and the casts of the comedy troupes Monty Python and “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nOf late, Chaplin’s creative genius has been the subject of much renewed interest, due largely to a collection of excellent, suprisingly revealing three hour-long documentaries on the man who over the years has become an ubiquitous and at times controversial and divisive cultural presence, his complex personal life and political leanings at times overshadowing his breathtaking talent and comedic legacy.\n\nThe documentaries, “Unknown Chaplin: The Master at Work,” recently produced for Britain’s Thames Television, unmask a serious and determined side of Chaplin worlds apart from the flip, feckless, in-the-moment innocent audiences fell in love with on the screen, but rather a shrewd, demanding, streetwise producer and director whose wellspring of humor was anything but spontaneous and not the least bit accidental.\n\nIn Chaplin’s 1931 film “City Lights,” for example, often described as his greatest cinematic achievement, it is reported that he kept the movie crew waiting for weeks while he thought over a single scene. The storyline of the picture could hardly have been simpler: The Little Tramp befriends a blind girl only to lose her when she regains her sight.\n\nFor “The Gold Rush” — a 1925 picture containing the famous routine where The Little Tramp as starving prospector elegantly dines on an old shoe — Chaplin built an entire mining town set, then used only a few shots from it for the finished film.\n\nAlso included in “Unknown Chaplin” are outtakes from some of Chaplin’s films and home movies showing that even at play, Chaplin was busy creating and hoarding ideas for future use, often years later.\n\nWhen Chaplin died on Christmas Day 1977 in Vevey, Switzerland, The New York Times reported that “no motion picture actor so captured and enthralled the world.” He made more than 80 movies from 1914 to 1967.\n\nIndeed, when one thinks of film comedy, Chaplin inescapably comes to mind.\n\nYet Van Dyke tends to lean more toward his friend Laurel, the skinny half of the legendary comedy team Laurel and Hardy, and Buster Keaton. Keaton (and some say Laurel as well), in fact, served as the basis for Van Dyke’s 1969 film, “The Comic,” a tragicomedy about the life of a fictional screen comedian named Billy Bright.\n\nYears after Oliver Hardy’s death in 1957, Van Dyke said Laurel was still writing skit after skit for himself and Hardy, and storing them away in shoe boxes.\n\nVan Dyke and Laurel became acquainted several years before Laurel’s death in 1965. Van Dyke, then riding the crest of popularity with his classic sitcom and always a fan of Laurel’s (he once did a skit as Laurel on the show) tried for months to find the old comic.\n\nNo one in Hollywood seemed to know where he was. Van Dyke finally found him — listed under “Stan Laurel” on Ocean Avenue in the Santa Monica phone book.\n\nWhen Laurel died, Van Dyke delivered the eulogy at his funeral. Laurel willed his famous bow tie to Van Dyke.\n\nHe said he isn’t sure what makes a film comedian appeal to audiences, and once put the question to Laurel.\n\n“He told me, ‘I don’t know what makes people funny or what comedy is, either. All I know is what makes me laugh — and I’ve been lucky enough that other people have laughed at it too.”\n\nVan Dyke explained that Laurel and Hardy, Keaton, and even a lesser comic like Charley Chase, made him laugh — but Chaplin didn’t.\n\n“For some reason, as a kid, I never laughed at Chaplin. I don’t know why,” Van Dyke explained.\n\n“His movement, his body control and his grace absolutely amazed me, but for some reason, I didn’t laugh. The older I get the more I appreciate his talent and brilliance, but there was something about The Tramp that didn’t make me laugh — it could make me cry.\n\n“My theory is that Keaton and Laurel were much better technicians, but you weren’t always aware of their technique — you were too busy laughing at their performance.\n\n“For some reason with Chaplin, he made a show of his technique, for which he was highly lauded all of his life.\n\n“He reminded me of Marcel Marceau today. He’s a marvelous technician, a classical mime, as is Chaplin. I think people went to see him for that reason, at least I did. But I never got a belly laugh out of him.”\n\nVan Dyke was asked to assess screen comedians, and agreed to do so, adding, “Remember, I’m speaking as member of the audience now and not as another comedian”:\n\nLaurel and Hardy: “I think what they had was that wonderful relationship between the two of them. When you went to see them, you suspended reality, put aside all your problems and left them outside. Stan always told me his favorite comedian was Ollie, that he ruined more takes just breaking up and laughing at him. I think those of us in the audience sensed that unique friendship.”\n\nBud Abbott and Lou Costello: “Almost anybody you talk to who knows comedy will say that Bud Abbott was the epitome of the good straight man. It’s always said that for every 100 comedians, there is one straight man. He made Costello funny.”\n\nJackie Gleason and Art Carney: “Back in the 1950s, when Garry Moore had a daytime television show, Chuck McCann and I wrote a sketch, a kind of a generic Laurel and Hardy thing, called ‘The Vacuum Cleaner.’ It was a classroom experience. First we did the sketch as Laurel and Hardy, then as Gleason and Carney on the old ‘Honeymooners’ show. It was amazing. We didn’t have to change a move, a word or a piece of business — it was just exactly the same.”\n\nBob Hope and Bing Crosby: “The original ‘Road’ films, where they broke some cinematic ground, were very funny. Some of them were a little bit too contemporary for their times. I don’t think they hold up that well — some of the jokes — but they were funny then.”\n\nJack Benny: “I always laughed at him. He wasn’t perhaps that visual a performer. He was greatly consistent, always stayed within that character of his all those years. I did a guest shot on his TV show once. He played Sherlock Holmes and I played seven other characters — the butler, the maid, everybody. I was working my butt off and all Benny did was look at the audience and they were screaming. I didn’t get a laugh. Nobody was looking at me. They were looking at Benny — at his character, his look.”\n\nGeorge Burns: “In the old days, when he was with Gracie Allen, I didn’t think he was funny at all. But like Bud Abbott, he was obviously one of the great straight men. Now he’s built a whole new character, a whole new attitude — 40 years of failure. His success in his own right shouldn’t come as any surprise to those familiar with his work with Gracie.”\n\nThe Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields: “I didn’t laugh at the Marx Brothers, I don’t know why. I guess it was the same reason I didn’t laugh at Fields. You had to have some prior knowledge, some life experience, to understand what they meant, what they were doing. You had to have lived a good 25 years to appreciate their humor, their anger and puckishness. It’s adult entertainment, really. You had to be an adult to understand why Fields, for instance, might not have liked children.”\n\nThe Three Stooges: “That kind of schtick I never appreciated, coming out of nothing for nor reason. Laurel and Hardy, when they did it, always had a reason.”\n\nWoody Allen and Mel Brooks: “I thought Mel’s ‘Silent Movie’ was uneven, but I enjoyed it. Mel has always been much broader and more interested in visual comedy than Woody. Woody is intellectual and draws from his own neurotic Jewish background as an intellectual. I thought Mel’s ‘History of the World, Part I,’ was tasteless. There were a few funny moments in it, but that was it. Woody is a lot more self-disciplined as a writer than Mel, who is so explosive that sometimes he forgets to editorialize as a comedian. I just don’t feel that Mel has anything to say, nothing in particular to say despite being a very bright man. Woody used to write for New Yorker magazine and is very reminiscent of S.J. Perelman.”\n\nRichard Pryor: “He’s genius. He makes me laugh very, very hard. When the shock value of the language he uses wear off, he’ll stop using it — and he’ll still be around. I’m waiting for the day when he doesn’t have to do that kind of thing. He’s absolutely brilliant.”\n\nThe original “Saturday Night Live” cast: “The original show with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd was truly funny. The show lost some of its originality when those first cast members started to leave. I think Belushi, in particular, had tremendous range and could do anything. It’s hard to think of him as a romantic lead, but in the movie ‘Continental Divide,’ he was quite good. There’s no one rule of thumb on whether or not comedians make good actors, but some make excellent ones — Gleason’s proven that.”\n\nMonty Python: “When I was in England back in the 1960s, I thought their insanity was just brilliant. They still are, but much of their recent stuff is really tasteless. It’s really needless to do much of what they do, just to be different.”\n\nSid Caesar: “I just finished a TV movie with him — he’s one of my idols. I really think he’s a comedic genius. For me, he was the greatest comedian to come along in my generation. He had all the technique plus his own peculiar brand of humor. He stopped appearing, he told me, because people stopped doing the kinds of things he was interested in doing. He just wasn’t interested in the kind of pap that came along. Then too, network policies changed and he didn’t feel he would be given the time to polish and rewrite he needed.”\n\nWhen Van Dyke gave the eulogy at his friend Stan Laurel’s funeral on Feb. 26, 1965, as part of it he read “A Prayer for Clowns,” one of Laurel’s favorite poems:\n\nGod bless all clowns.\n\nWho star in the world with laughter,\n\nWho ring the rafters with flying jest,\n\nWho make the world spin merry on its way.\n\nGod bless all clowns.\n\nSo poor the world would be,\n\nLacking their piquant touch, hilarity,\n\nThe belly laughs, the ringing lovely.\n\nGod bless all clowns.\n\nGive them a long good life,\n\nMake bright their way — they’re a race apart!\n\nAlchemists most, who turn their hearts’ pain,\n\nInto a dazzling jest to lift the heart.\n\nGod bless all clowns."
