        "text": "Charlie’s second drunken party scene has two great gags: he’s offered a strange dessert, and then tries to eat a bald man’s head which, in fairness, resembles the dessert to a quite implausible degree. When offered the correct dish after trying to spoon up the pate, he refuses. It now has unfortunate associations.\n\nFor some reason, Chaplin’s makeup has gotten really crude in this film, and in particular this part of the film. His hair turned white back around THE GOLD RUSH, so there seems no reason for his eyebrows to have abruptly turned so cartoonish, so Grouchoesque.\n\nThen he swallows a whistle. I haven’t asked any of my accompanist friends if this gag would be too hard to play live. I guess anything can be managed, with sufficient prep time and good reflexes. But it is a sound gag, and there aren’t so many of those in earlier Chaplins. Also, though, it’s using the resources available to a cheap pit orchestra. The sounds of the film are pretty well all musical. Even the gunshots would be achievable using standard movie theatre equipment.\n\nThis is another of Chaplin’s obsessive “swallow metallic objects” gags, harking back to the childhood trauma of almost choking to death on a coin. Probably made more memorable since Hannah Chaplin’s home-schooled Heimlich solution was to hold little Charlie upside down and pummel him: effectively, a re-birthing experience.\n\nCharlie’s whistle disrupts a music recital, then calls an unwanted cab, then attracts a whole assorted sled team of dogs.\n\nAnd in the morning, Charlie is ejected, but not before one of his startling gay jokes — CITY LIGHTS as pre-code film? The drunk millionaire, awakening sober, is astonished to find an unfamiliar male bedmate. Chaplin makes sure the suspicion is crystal-clear by patting his chum affectionately on the cheek.\n\nOUT.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Harry Myers’ essentially serious-looking face is used to brilliant comic effect when he’s sober. He LOOKS tragic, but IS funny. Oddly enough, though his drunk act is very skilled. it’s his miserable sober guy that really makes me laugh.\n\nThis ejection puts Charlie back in his tramp clothes — he’s spent a day wandering about in rich man’s togs (somehow obtained the night before last, fitting his unusual frame to perfection). Now, dropping by the blind girl’s place (where she lives with her grandmother in picturesque Dickensian poverty courtesy of designer Charles “Danny” Hall) he overhears a doctor offering a diagnosis: the girl is sick. Chaplin lets his camera move, in an elegant creeping POV shot that edges round an obstructing wall to get a better view. A very atypical move for him.\n\nThe girl being unable to work sends Charlie off to earn some cash. As a street sweeper. Cue dung joke. A pretty good one. Worth hiring an elephant for the day.\n\nAlbert Austin appears, a little plumper than in his Mutual days. I only identified him by his cookie-duster, which isn’t even real. More food jokes — Austin accidentally eats soap. He’ll be back later, as a burglar.\n\nVirginia unwittingly unravelling Charlie’s undershirt is one of the few jokes using her blindness directly. We learn that Charlie times his visits for when granny’s away, to enable him to keep up the millionaire illusion. Granny is a remarkably trusting lady.\n\nAnd now we learn of the new cure for blindness, and also that the rent’s due. And, bang on cue, Charlie loses his job — spending too much time at lunch with his charity case. This crisis leading, very swiftly, to the celebrated boxing sequence…\n\nTO BE CONTINUED"
