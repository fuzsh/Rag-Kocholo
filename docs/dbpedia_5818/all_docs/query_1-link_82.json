        "text": "In this dissertation, through a detailed analysis of the work and personae of Vaslav Nijinsky, Charlie Chaplin, and Marcel Duchamp, I identify and examine the manner in which these male artists dared to invoke the cultural categories of effeminacy and male homosexuality as codified in France and America during the 1910s and 1920s. In the aftermath of the trials of Oscar Wilde (1895), the emasculating trauma of World War I, and the birth of the New Woman or la garconne, Nijinsky, Chaplin, and Duchamp were key players in redefining the parameters of \"acceptable\" masculinity in the French and American avant-garde. Employing a lexicon of complementary as well as contradictory corporeal signifiers in circulation in a variety of visual and textual media, their collective artistic output from this period forms a complex matrix of non-traditional masculinities: the muscularly overdeveloped male dancer who was bisexual in his private life and whose early stage roles comprised a kind of bisexual performativity in their emphasis on the gracefulness, etherealness, and submissiveness traditionally associated with the feminine (Nijinsky); the comedic actor with a weakness for barely pubescent young women whose diminutive and cowardly tramp persona resorted to all kinds of unmanly antics in order to outwit his burly, brutish male antagonists (Chaplin); and the consummate bachelor artist adored by men and women alike whose work addressed the themes of urination, cross-dressing, and anal eroticism ail of which, from a medical perspective, were symptomatic of sexual pathologies (Duchamp). In writing the case histories of these three seemingly unusual men, I assert that their concurrent visual exploration of non-traditional masculinities and male sexuality formed the foundation of and functioned as the catalyst for a broad-based aesthetic project that continues to influence and haunt the avant-garde in our fin de siecle ."
