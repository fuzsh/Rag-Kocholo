        "text": "He was a “Captain of Industry” and a “Robber Baron”. Andrew Carnegie was born in Scotland on November 25, 1835. Carnegie grew up poor. The family left Scotland for the United States. They left because of a lack of business in the textile mill and the potato famine in Ireland. The Carnegie's moved to Pittsburg to be closer to other family members. His family didn’t have the money to send him to school and graduate. He began working at a textile mill at age twelve. Andrew Carnegie was thirteen when he came to the United States with his family.They settled in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and Carnegie went to work in a factory, earning $1.20 a week. Carnegie found a job as a telegraph messenger. He was 16 when he decoded the dot-dot message and\n\nAndrew Carnegie was a Scottish immigrant, born in 1835. His first foray into the world of work was as a bobbin boy, at the age of 13, where he earned $1.20 per week. Carnegie quickly gained skills and proved his work ethic, until he landed a job with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and was promoted to superintendent by the age of 24 (Carnegie.org, 2015). From there, Carnegie’s vision and success grew exponentially, and now his name is often mentioned alongside the likes of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Cornelius Vanderbilt (Biography.com, 2017).\n\nin the twenties when a man by the name of Charlie Chaplain who was known for his &quot;tramp&quot; look, dominated the silent movie business. He was considered one of the most talented actors of the 20’s. Also during the 20’s radio was the popular for of listening to music and listening to the news. In the later 1920’s the television was created which now aloud people to see a picture in their home for entertainment, but the television did not surpass the radio entertainment wise, because most people were unable to afford it.\n\nWe have all seen it done before, either in real life or in the movies. A situation is funny because of the misinterpretation of someone's actions or the complete conflict of what a situation seems to be and what it really is. People come into contact with sight gags all the time. One might be trying to be sneaky and hide something and then when someone looks, one pretends to be doing something else not to get caught. One could also pantomime using an umbrella as a baseball bat. These are both basic forms of sight gags.\n\nImagine being a kid, losing your father to alcoholism, experiencing your own mother breaking down on stage, and having to live place to place. Having been born to two troubled parents, Charlie Spencer Chaplin started his career at a young age and built himself up. Starting his career in The Eight Lancashire Lads, Chaplin was able to let his name be known to dignitary people. His enthusiasm to rise up from the gutters amazes me, as not many can do as much as he did for himself.\n\nCharlie Chaplin, or the “Little Tramp”, led a life many referred to as a Cinderella story. Chaplin was the son of a poor London family, who were entertainers. As a child, at an early age, he also performed, and made his stage debut in 1894. He began his career when he played a paperboy in the film Sherlock Holmes. He also worked as a mime in Vaudeville theatres in London, until he left for America. When Chaplin arrived in the States, he joined the Karno Pantomime Troupe, and toured with them for six years. This experience led him to branch out on his own, making his own films. One of these films was City Lights. Many say that this film and others, lead him to be one the most successful film stars of his time. “Chaplin dedicated himself to perfecting every scene during both the writing process and on set, sacrificing his personal life during production” (Eggert, 2006).\n\nHe stayed with them up until 1913, and then in the May of 1913, Charlie signed a contract with Adam Wessel, who was also interested in Keystone Films. Charlie signed with him for a $125 a week and then on December 29, 1913, Chaplin signed with Keystone Films for $150 a week. Chaplin made his first feature film, in the January of 1914, “Making a Living”. Charlie worked with the Keystone Films throughout 1914, until November when he signed a contract with Essanay Films, where he made $1,250 a week, and where he also had to make 14 films, during the year of 1915. Chaplin’s first movie where he was not just featuring was “The Tramp” where he was the “tramp”. His character was a small man, with a black moustache and a funny\n\nThe recording I listened to was the poem “Charlie Parker” performed by Jack Kerouac and Steve Allen. This performance is accompanied by a musical rendition that relates to the poem’s content, as the poem is about musician Charlie Parker. Kerouac is performing this poem in memoriam of the musician. Kerouac describes Charlie Parker in an affluent manner to attest to his musical reverence, such as calling him “a great musician”. The sound of the poem and the meaning are greatly intertwined with one another. The sound is musical and whimsical in nature, as the music playing compliments the poem performance. The meaning of the poem is about the great musician Charlie Parker and a testament to his life. So the music that accompanies this meaningful\n\nCharlie was born in April 16th 1889 in England. Even though his early life wasn’t the happiest compared to other children, he found his unknown talent at the age of five of making people laugh. His mother and father were also entertainers but became obstructed with problems and troubles in their lives. From that point, Charlies career of becoming an actor was getting closer but his parents were getting worse. At the time he moved to America from London to perform with his half brother, and Charlie got picked up by a studio. His career skyrocketed to success; making many films, achieve many awards, enjoying live. He became one of the highest pay weekly for an actor at the time. While he became an actor, people, especially girls, became attracted to him which led to Charlie having relationships with many other girls. He achieved everything he could have dreamed for, fame, fortune and the ability to do what he wished with his life. He even started his own studio and produced his own films to gain all the profit he could, but that led to problems making him flee from the country because of accusations of helping communism. He left the country to save not just his life but also his wifes’. He lived the rest of his life; traveling. enjoying his life with his loyal wife; and writing books until his death in 1977 (age 88). Charlie Chaplin was a great comedian actor of the 20th century bringing smiles to peoples faces and making people laugh all over the world."
