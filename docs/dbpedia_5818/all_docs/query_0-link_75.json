        "text": "THE king of silent film Charlie Chaplin has left an indelible mark on British cinema by stretching the boundaries of film and satire time and time again.\n\nHis own private life was imbued with controversy and tragedy. Here's what we know about the man famous for playing The Tramp, whose appetite for the silver screen would last a lifetime.\n\nWho was Charlie Chaplin?\n\nInimitable artist Charlie Chaplin was a multi-talented performer who wowed international audiences over nearly seven decades.\n\nHe was born Charles Spencer Chaplin in London on April 16, 1889.\n\nHis parents both worked in the creative industries - his father as a vocalist, his mother as an actress and singer.\n\nBut his fortunes were to change at the age of just ten, when his dad's death and mum's illness left him and brother Sydney to fend for themselves.\n\nWith a gift for performing, he quickly realised he could make a living from his knack for acting alone.\n\nHe made his professional debut as a member of a group called The Eight Lancashire Lads, where his tap dancing skills made him a serious hit.\n\nAt 12, Charlie started appearing in different productions of Sherlock Holmes before starting a career as a comedian in vaudeville.\n\nThis eventually led him to the US in 1910 with the Fred Karno Repertoire Company, where US audiences also loved him.\n\nReturning there two years later he was offered a motion picture contract, and there his prolific film career began.\n\nWhat were Chaplin's first silent films?\n\nIn his first five years in comedy between 1912-17, Chaplin's impressive output included:\n\nThe Floorwalker\n\nThe Fireman\n\nThe Vagabond\n\nOne A.M\n\nThe Count\n\nThe Pawnshop\n\nBehind the Screen\n\nThe Rink\n\nEasy Street\n\nThe Cure\n\nThe Immigrant\n\nThe Adventurer\n\nAfter this flurry Chaplin began his own studios in the heart of Hollywood in 1917.\n\nHis first film A Dog’s Life was followed by The Bond, a film made for the US government to popularise the Liberty Loan.\n\nShoulder Arms, a comedy released in 1918 dealing with the war, was an instant box office hit.\n\nFurther films included The Kid (1921), where he worked with child actor extraordinaire, Jackie Coogan.\n\nReturning to Europe on vacation he was given a hero's welcome, touring around London, Paris and Berlin.\n\nChaplin first turned his hand to writing and directing in Woman of Paris (1923), followed by The Gold Rush (1925), The Circus (1928), and his first sound-era film City Lights (1931).\n\nTo keep his famous Tramp character intact he kept the character silent in City Lights, despite the new era of sound.\n\nThe film, whose entire score he composed himself, was met with rapture.\n\nWhat was his last speech from the Great Dictator?\n\nIn The Great Dictator (1940), Chaplin played a dual role as a Jewish barber and Hynkel, the dictator leader of Tomania.\n\nHis final speech included the lines: \"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor.\n\n\"That's not my business.\n\n\"I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.\n\n\"I should like to help everyone if possible.\n\n\"Jew - Gentile - Black Man, White.\"\n\nThe satire, also Chaplin's first true sound-era film, became his most commercially successful film.\n\nWhen the film was released in France in 1945, it became the most popular film of the year, with admissions of 8,280,553.\n\nLater however, he appeared to regret the levity, stating in his 1964 autobiography that he would not have made the film had he known about the true extent of the Nazi concentration camps at the time.\n\nWhat were his later films?\n\nChaplin was made an exile after his visa was rescinded because of allegations around his morals and politics.\n\nHe settled in his later years in Corsier sur Vevey, Switzerland, where he rented studios to continue making films.\n\nThroughout his filmmaking he continued to busy himself with the political landscape of his time.\n\nIn A King in New York he was the first filmmaker to explore the political intolerance to overtake the United States during the Cold War.\n\nHe also directed Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952) and a A King in New York (1957).\n\nHe created his final picture A Countess from New York in 1966, starring Sophia Loren and Marlon Brando.\n\nIn the film, Chaplin appears as a ship steward, while his son Sydney and three of his daughters have bit parts.\n\nWhat about his private life?\n\nCharlie Chaplin married a total of four times, every time to actresses much younger than him.\n\nHe married 16-year-old Mildred Harris in September 1918, but soon tired of marriage.\n\nHarris gave birth to a son on July 7, 1919, but the child died just three days later.\n\nThey split in April 1920, with Chaplin explaining in his autobiography that they were \"irreconcilably mismated\".\n\nWhile making Goldrush (1925), Chaplin married for a second time, again to a teenage actress.\n\nLita Grey, who was also just 16 to his 35, was set to star in the film and found out she was pregnant with his child.\n\nChaplin, who could have been charged with rape under California law, married Lita quietly in Mexico on November 25, 1924.\n\nTheir first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr, was born on May 5, 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on March 30, 1926.\n\nThis too proved an unhappy marriage, and in November 1926, Grey left the family home with their children.\n\nIn Grey's application of divorce she accused Chaplin of infidelity, abuse and of having \"perverted sexual desires\" - all claims that were leaked to the press.\n\nThe scandal caused an uproar, with Chaplin's lawyers agreeing to a cash settlement of $600,000 – the largest awarded by American courts at that time.\n\nChaplin met American actress Paulette Goddard in 1932, later moving into his home in Beverley Hills.\n\nThey married in secret in China in June 1936.\n\nHowever, aside from referring to Goddard as \"my wife\" at the October 1940 premiere of The Great Dictator, neither Goddard nor Chaplin publicly commented on their marital status.\n\nOn June 4, 1942, Goddard was granted a Mexican divorce from Chaplin.\n\nFourth time round, Chaplin claimed to have found true love with 18-year-old Oona O'Neill. Chaplin was 54 years old when they married.\n\nThey remained together until Chaplin's death, and had eight children over 18 years: Geraldine Leigh, Michael John, Josephine Hannah, Victoria, Eugene Anthony, Jane Cecil, Annette Emily, and Christopher James.\n\nIn total, Chaplin had eleven children, including his first who died in childbirth."
