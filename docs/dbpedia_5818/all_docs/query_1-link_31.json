        "text": "Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin KBE was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, \"The Tramp\", and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry.\n\nHe appeared on an episode called I Am Charlie Chaplin.\n\nSince he was met in 1894, he would have been 5 years old when the trio met him.\n\nHe is voiced by Ian Ho.\n\nChaplin worked on movies from 1914 until 1967. Brad comments \"Charlie made movies a hundred years ago\" which establishes it being later than 2013.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nChaplin met Helen Keller, but the series hasn't made reference to that.[1]\n\nReferences[]"
