        "text": "The High Court battle between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp has produced allegations of terrifying domestic violence, drug binges and even lurid tales of defecation in a bed. And yet, if you go back almost a century, you’ll find that it isn’t the first time a Hollywood marriage has been dragged publicly through the mud.\n\nCharlie Chaplin – a man, coincidentally, on whose persona Depp riffed in his 1993 film Benny & Joon – was sued for divorce in the Superior Court of Los Angeles in 1927. His second wife, Lita Grey, accused him of pulling a gun on her and trying to force her into having an abortion. The split eventually opened the window on Chaplin’s behaviour towards a number of underage girls.\n\nCharles Spencer Chaplin was born in London on 16 April 1889, and moved to America in 1913. The former vaudeville performer soon became a rising star of the Keystone Films company. Off-screen, he just as quickly gained a reputation as a voracious womaniser. After five years in the US, 16-year-old Mildred Harris became his first wife. Chaplin targeted the child actress, courting her with flowers and gifts, and married her only because of a false pregnancy scare and the fear of a scandal.\n\nWhen she did give birth a year later, it ended in tragedy. Norman Chaplin was born with malformed intestines and died after 72 hours. Chaplin walked out on his young wife two days after their son’s death. They divorced in November 1920, with Mildred citing that Chaplin was “short-tempered, impatient and treated me like a cretin”. They reached an out-of-court settlement, and Chaplin’s first wife was awarded $200,000 and a share of the multi-millionaire actor’s property.\n\nThe relationship was just a dress rehearsal for the way Chaplin groomed, married and abused his second wife Lillita Louise MacMurray, whom Chaplin first set eyes on when she was just six. He later spotted the same 12-year-old amid a crowd of extras on the set of The Kid in 1920. His behaviour was that of a paedophile from the start. He called Lillita his “age-of-innocence girl” and asked a set decorator to paint her in the style of Joshua Reynolds’s famous 18th-century portrait The Age of Innocence.\n\nChaplin helped her land small roles – including one in 1921’s The Idle Class – and persuaded the teenager to change her name to Lita Grey, after a silver-grey kitten he had given her. “He’d try to create people. He enjoyed being the first person in a girl’s life,” Grey told the LA Times in 1989. In 1924, he cast her as the lead female in The Gold Rush. Chaplin was determined to seduce her and finally did so in the steam room of his Beverley Hills mansion. He was 35; she was 15.\n\nAt the time, Chaplin talked about of his love for “young girls”, declaring that there was “something so virginal in their slimness – in their slender arms and legs”. When asked by Vanity Fair in 1926 to describe his ideal woman, he replied: “I am not exactly in love with her, but she is entirely in love with me.” There is even a credible theory that the story of Chaplin and Lillita influenced Vladimir Nabokov when he was writing the novel Lolita, about a middle-aged professor’s affair with his child step-daughter. Publisher George Weidenfeld said that Nabokov met Chaplin socially and was a great admirer of his silent films.\n\nGrey was infatuated with Chaplin and easy prey to his manipulation. When Grey collapsed on the set of The Gold Rush, the truth came out: the girl was pregnant. In her memoir, My Life with Chaplin, Grey recalled that a family member took a shotgun and marched to Chaplin’s mansion to confront him. Her uncle Edwin McMurray, a lawyer, followed up with a warning that if Chaplin did not marry the girl, the family would bring charges of statutory rape.\n\nAt five o’clock in the morning on November 24 1924, in the Mexican village of Empalme, Chaplin married Grey in a small ceremony he hoped would be far from the public eye. A couple of resourceful reporters managed to find out about the secret wedding and claimed that Chaplin quipped, “Well, boys, this is better than the penitentiary but it won’t last.”\n\nThe goodwill didn’t even last a day. On the train back from Mexico, after having failed at gunpoint to make her get an abortion, Grey claimed that Chaplin called her a “whore”, before pushing her on to the platform of the observation carriage and suggesting that she jump to her death. “The whole thing was ridiculous from the start,” Grey said in 1960. She recalled Chaplin telling her that he would make her “so damn sick of me that you won’t want to live with me”.\n\nAlthough they had two children in quick succession (Charles Jr in May 1925 and Sydney in March 1926), Lita became weary of his cruelty and philandering, and filed for divorce in January 1927. While Depp and Heard’s marital bust-ups are being played out in an era of live blogs and running social-media commentary, the truth of Chaplin’s messy, brutal break-up was kept largely hidden. When Judge Walter Guerin granted Grey a divorce on August 2 1927, awarding her a record settlement of £625,000 (around £38 million today), he ruled that all “sensational matters” be deleted from the lawsuit account, which was awarded on the sole ground of cruelty.\n\nChaplin was assured that all the papers about the case would be sealed in a bank vault and never made public. “With the final settlement, the Chaplin divorce case disappeared from the newspapers for good,” Charles Chaplin Jr declared confidently in his 1960 memoir My Father, Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin Jr was just 42 when he died two years later from alcoholism – long before fate revealed the twist up its sleeve. All the sensational revelations spilled out into the open in 2015, when the 50-page legal document from Grey’s legal team surfaced for auction at Parade Antiques in Plymouth. (“We got it from a person in America who was told to clear out old documents at the [disused] bank,” said owner John Cabello.)\n\nGrey had filed for divorce on the grounds of “serial infidelity, cruelty and grievous mental suffering”. Chaplin’s behaviour created headlines around the world. Grey confirmed that Chaplin tried to use a pistol to force her to have an abortion, and how he had delayed reporting Charles Jr’s birth until months later, to make it look like the child was conceived in wedlock.\n\nShe claimed that Chaplin had read obscene books to her – including novels by DH Lawrence – and forced her to engage in “a perverted, degenerate and indecent act”. At the time, oral sex was a criminal offence in California, and Grey made clear that she had been made to perform fellatio. She stated that Chaplin had shouted that “all married people do those kind of things… you are my wife and you have to do what I want you to do”.\n\nAmong the other allegations were that Chaplin, who was taking up to eight showers a day while living with Grey, asked his wife to take part in a threesome with another woman and installed a listening device in her bedroom.\n\nWhat eventually forced Chaplin to cave in and pay such huge damages was that Grey also threatened to name five married actresses who had enjoyed “intimacy” with him during the marriage. The film studios did not want these revelations in the public domain and it’s perhaps no coincidence that a grateful industry honoured Chaplin’s “versatility and genius” with a special Academy Award in 1929.\n\nAlthough she left the court a rich woman, things did not go well for Grey subsequently. “Mother suffered two serious breakdowns in later years, and during the first all the bitterness of the marriage relived itself in terrifying fantasy. For a long time, she could not bear classical music in general and would flee the room in anguish when she heard Wagner, my father’s favourite composer,” wrote Charles Chaplin Jr. Grey lost most of her fortune in ill-advised nightclub and property deals. For a time, she was forced to support herself and her children by working as a sales assistant at Robinson’s department store in Beverly Hills. Grey married a further three times before she died of cancer in 1995.\n\nChaplin once boasted that he’d had sex with more than 2,000 women, and one of his party tricks was reportedly to use his skills as a mimic to pretend to be a number of leading Hollywood ladies in the throes of an orgasm. Grey described him as “a human sex machine”, claiming it was the cover for a man who was “full of insecurities”, the result of his “notoriously deprived background” in London.\n\nThis analysis was shared by Chaplin’s biographer Peter Ackroyd, who wrote: “The roots of his deeply dysfunctional behaviour with women went all the way back to his childhood, for the truth was that he had never really recovered from being abandoned by his mother, when he was just a little boy, for the best part of a year.”\n\nChaplin’s eye for young girls was well known in Hollywood after the divorce but there was no shortage of available starlets. When child fashion model Paulette Goddard first met Chaplin she was knowing enough to tell him that she was 17 – she was actually 22 at the time – and he began a romance with her that culminated in a secret marriage in China in 1936, the year in which she starred in his masterpiece Modern Times. Chaplin did his best to keep their relationship private, and when it ended, in June 1942, Goddard obtained a quickie divorce in Mexico and received a generous settlement to keep details of their life together secret.\n\nThe 54-year-old was married again within a year, this time to teenager Oona O’Neill, whom author JD Salinger had earlier pursued. She was 17 when she met Chaplin and gushed to a friend about “what blue eyes he has!” In My Autobiography, Chaplin described meeting O’Neill as “the happiest event of my life”. We know from Eugene O’Neill’s published correspondence that the Nobel-winning author of the play Long Day’s Journey into Night disapproved of his then 18-year-old daughter’s elopement to a small village near Santa Barbara to wed Chaplin in June 1943. “Chaplin’s wife had charged him with ruining young girls, with every form of perversion… he was guilty as everyone knows,” O’Neill confided in one letter. Father and daughter rarely spoke afterwards, and the playwright disinherited Oona.\n\nYou can imagine O’Neill’s reaction when he heard, only a year later, that Chaplin was being charged by the FBI for violating the Mann Act, and accused of transporting 23-year-old actress Joan Barry across state borders for sex. There was also a paternity suit from Barry. Although Chaplin was eventually acquitted, he was ordered to pay maintenance until the child’s 21st birthday. His fondness for young women was now openly reported in newspapers. Time magazine described his penchant for affairs “with a succession of pretty young protégées” and there was little sympathy for Chaplin’s complaints that Barry’s attorney, Joseph Scott, was “trying to make [him] look like a monster”.\n\nNewspapers carried detailed reports of the summary by Scott, who described Chaplin as a “pestiferous, lecherous hound”, adding that “this fellow doesn’t lie like a gentleman, he lies like a cheap Cockney cad. That man goes around fornicating with the same aplomb that the average man orders bacon and eggs for breakfast. He is a hoary headed old buzzard with the instincts of a young bull… a master mechanic in the art of seduction.”\n\nThe publicity began to harm Chaplin’s career. Just seven years after being feted for his anti-fascist triumph The Great Dictator, he saw his black comedy Monsieur Verdoux flop disastrously in 1947. When Chaplin sailed for England in 1952, to promote his next film Limelight, about a washed-up comedian, the US authorities seized their chance and sent him a telegram revoking his US re-entry permit unless he could prove his “moral worth”.\n\nIn April 1953, he surrendered his permit, declaring, “it is not easy to uproot myself and my family from a country where I have lived for forty years without a feeling of sadness. But since the end of the last World War, I have been the object of lies and vicious propaganda by powerful reactionary groups. Under these conditions I find it virtually impossible to continue my motion-picture work and I have therefore given up my residence in the United States.”\n\nHis banishment from America was roundly celebrated in newspapers. The bluntest verdict was delivered by the Right-wing, Pulitzer Prize-winning Chicago Tribune columnist Westbrook Pegler, who said the US was ridding itself of a “filthy character who is a menace to young girls”.\n\nThe Chaplins settled in Manoir de Ban, a 37-acre Swiss estate overlooking Lake Geneva, and he lived in seclusion there, returning to the US once, in April 1972, to accept an honorary Oscar. “I feel as if I were the object of a complete renaissance – as if I were being reborn,” Chaplin, with Oona at his side, said. The couple had eight children together, the last of whom was born when Chaplin was 73. Christopher, his 11th and final child, was 15 when Chaplin died on Christmas Day 1977 at the age of 88. Chaplin’s wife lived another 14 years, during which time she slid into alcoholism and was reported, not least in Jane Scovell’s 1998 biography, to have had affairs with Ryan O’Neal and David Bowie.\n\nChaplin left a brilliant cinema legacy. He combined slapstick with pathos, created art out of physical comedy and exemplified humanity’s struggles against adversity in his portrayal of the “Tramp” character. As recently as 2012, Harvey Weinstein co-hosted a dinner to honour Chaplin’s services to the movie industry, and the disgraced film tycoon declared Chaplin to be “one of my idols, certainly”.\n\nWeinstein is now in prison, of course. Looking at his behaviour, and the furore surrounding the allegations in the Heard and Depp case, it’s hard to believe that Chaplin’s career would have survived that shocking divorce in 1927 had it taken place in our era of #MeToo scrutiny."
