        "text": "Yes Charlie did his own stunts, though in a couple of films when he was on a horse going really fast that may have been a stunt double he was not a great fan of horses, he was very light on his feet, Nijinsky ( greatest male ballet dancer of 20th century) admired Chaplin’s movements and called them balletic. Charlie admired Nijinksy as well, the scene in “Sunnyside” where he is dancing with Wood Nymphs is paying homage to Nijinsky’s ballet “Afternoon of a Faun”,\n\nAlthough W. C Fields is quoted as saying that he was “the best ballet dancer in the world.”, secretly he was extremely jealous of Charles Chaplin, whom he had known when he was younger, for achieving worldwide fame and adoration. Coincidentally W.C. Fields would also died on Christmas Day - December 25, 1946\n\nOne A.M. is pure tour de force, but if you look at the stairs as he goes up them they have foam underneath, when he falls down the stairs and pulls the carpet with him you can see the foam as well. But all the climbing and falling was him. Charlie did say though “One more film like this and it’s good bye Charlie” or words to that effect.\n\nThe skating in his film The Rink (1916) and Modern Times (1936) was all him, he had great skills on skates, he did a play called Skating circa 1909 (co written by his brother Sydney) when he was with the Fred Karno Troupe in England and that is where he really honed his skills as a skater.\n\nOne of the the trick that I think saved him was his ability to take a fall, way back to his Keystones you could see when he fell back he did not take the whole fall on his tailbone, he kind of pulled his legs back and rolled with it, kind of a signature move of his.\n\nEven at the age of 68 in King in New York he still exhibits some of these light as air movements.\n\nAnne"
