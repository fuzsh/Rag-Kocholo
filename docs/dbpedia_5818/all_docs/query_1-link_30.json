        "text": "Marilyn Monroe continues to fascinate the world more than 61 years after her death in 1962, and her life is once again taking over the big screen in the film, Blonde, starring Ana de Armas.\n\nThe fictional retelling, based on a novel by Joyce Carol Oates, explores some of Marilyn's romantic relationships, including her marriage to Arthur Miller. But the film also reimagines some of the starlet's more obscure connections, including those with Charlie Chaplin's son, Charlie \"Cass\" Chaplin, Jr., and actor Edward G. Robinson's son, Eddy Robinson, Jr.\n\nWhile the film suggests that Marilyn was in a romantic throuple with the two men, this is not based in fact. And several critics have voiced their disapproval of the portrayal after seeing it on the big screen. Ana de Armas was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, and SAG Award for Best Actress, but didn't win any (an Academy Award nom is still pending, though!). And the film is not up for any Oscars.\n\nStill, everyone has a lot of questions about the film and particularly, they want to know if Marilyn really was involved with Cass and Eddy. So, here's everything to know about what went down with these three.\n\nWho is Cass Chaplin?\n\nCharlie Chaplin, Jr., or Cass Chaplin, was the oldest son of iconic Hollywood actor Charlie Chaplin. He was born to Lita Grey and Charlie Chaplin on May 5, 1925, in Beverly Hills, California, according to IMDB.\n\nCass grew up to pursue acting like his famous father. He married twice, first to Martha Brown (a nurse) and then Susan Magness. He had one daughter with Magness, Susan Maree, who was born on May 11, 1959.\n\nCass died on March 20, 1968, in Hollywood, California, at the age of 43.\n\nWho is Eddy Robinson, Jr.?\n\nLike Cass, Eddy was also an actor who followed in his famous father's footsteps. Eddy was born on March 19, 1933 in Los Angeles, California, according to IMDB,\n\nUnlike Cass, Eddy had a much more successful acting career, even starring alongside Marilyn in the famous film, Some Like It Hot. He married three times, to Nan Elizabeth Morris, Ruth Elaine Menold Conte and Frances Chisholm.\n\nEddy died on February 26, 1974, in Los Angeles, California, at just 41.\n\nHow does the Blonde portray their relationship?\n\nIn case you haven’t seen it yet, the film shows Marilyn meeting Cass and Eddy at an acting class. After some dancing and flirting, they have a threesome that somehow turns into a throuple, complete with an unplanned pregnancy and abortion. (Note: None of this is based in reality. But more on that in a sec.)\n\nThere is also a massive factual error during a scene where Eddy informs Marilyn that Cass’ has died. In reality, Cass died six years after Marilyn's own death, Vulture reported.\n\nWas Marilyn ever in a relationship with Cass Chaplin?\n\nYes. There is some evidence to suggest that Marilyn and Cass were briefly involved with each other, at least according to Anthony Summers, who wrote a biography on Marilyn's life titled, , per RadioTimes.\n\nSummers' book claims that Cass introduced Marilyn to his family in 1947, bringing her to their home for lunch, according to The Cinemaholic. Cass also discussed his relationship with Marilyn in his book, My Father, Charlie Chaplin, per RadioTimes.\n\nThe older Charlie Chaplin was apparently a big fan of Marilyn. “‘Oh, she’s a beauty,’ Dad [Charlie Chaplin] used to tell me. ‘What a figure! I admire your taste, son, very much,’” Cass wrote in his book, per RadioTimes. “‘Just watch out, son,’ he [Chaplin] said. ‘Don’t fall in love yet. You have that education to take care of first.'”\n\nSummers claims Cass didn't take his dad's advice, and was “enamored [of Monroe] for many months.” A close friend of Cass Chaplin said that \"Marilyn would stay the night with Charlie. She would cram into a single bed with him, while brother Sydney slept in his bed in the same room,\" Summers wrote in the biography.\n\nThings eventually ended, but they stayed friends.\n\nWas Marilyn ever in a relationship with Eddy Robinson?\n\nSummers also says that Marilyn and Eddy actually met through Cass, but that they only dated for a short time (and not at the same time). Apparently, things started heating up while she filming Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Eddy was just 19 years old at the time, while Marilyn was around 27, per RadioTimes.\n\nThere's no evidence that they were in a throuple.\n\nDespite the way Blonde portrays their relationships as occurring simultaneously (they literally call themselves \"The Geminis\" in the movie), there's nothing to suggest this was actually the case.\n\nSome experts have also weighed in: \"There is no evidence of a three-way between Chaplin Jr. and Robinson Jr.,\" Scott Fortner, a Marilyn Monroe historian and collector said, per .\n\nSo, there you have it."
