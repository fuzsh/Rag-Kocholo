        "text": "A common way to visualize a black hole is as a two-dimensional sheet stretched into a funnel. Go too far down, and you’ll find yourself unable to climb back out. Try to picture the funnel in three dimensions, though, where material falls inward from every direction toward a central point.\n\nIn some ways, black holes are incredibly simple. They’re said to have “no hair,” meaning all distinctive features seem to wash away when they form. Each one can be characterized by only its mass, electric charge and angular momentum — making them rather like elementary particles.\n\nBut although they look simple from the outside, black holes are deeply mysterious on the inside. Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicts that the curvature of space-time becomes infinite in a black hole singularity, but this isn’t physically possible. These objects show that the theory must be incomplete. Physicists think that they’ll have to come up with a quantum theory of gravity to understand black hole singularities.\n\nHow do black holes form?\n\nBlack holes form when matter or energy is packed together densely enough. Just how densely? To form a black hole, Earth would have to shrink into a sphere smaller than a pingpong ball.\n\nAlthough such tiny black holes might have formed during the Big Bang (these are hypothetical entities known as “primordial black holes,” which might comprise the universe’s missing dark matter), the ones observed in the universe today are larger. They typically form when stars at least 10 times more massive than the sun run out of fuel. With outward radiation pressure no longer able to counteract the inward lurch of gravity, the star’s core inwardly collapses — an event usually accompanied by a dramatic explosion called a supernova.\n\nLess certainty surrounds the formation of supermassive black holes, like the 4-million-solar-mass black hole named Sagittarius A* [pronounced A-star] that Reinhard Genzel, Andrea Ghez and their teams studied in the center of the Milky Way. These behemoths probably formed within the universe’s first billion years, as galaxies took shape around them. But whether they started as stars that gravitationally collapsed into black holes and then grew astronomically, or formed from the direct collapse of huge pockets of plasma — or in some other way — remains an open question. In the coming years, the James Webb Space Telescope’s observations of very distant and very young galaxies could solve the puzzle.\n\nWhat did Roger Penrose figure out about black holes?\n\nRoger Penrose made his key contribution in 1965, not long after the discovery of superluminous objects called quasars. These objects were so bright that researchers hypothesized that they might be the gleam of material falling into ultra-compact, supermassive objects. This renewed interest in the decades-old question of whether black holes were just a mathematical artifact of Einstein’s theory, or if they actually form in the universe.\n\nPenrose showed that they can. In fact, he showed that they inevitably do.\n\nUp until then, researchers had tied themselves in knots trying to figure out whether objects like the “Schwarzschild solution” of Einstein’s equations — the simplest kind of black hole, worked out on paper by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 — were really possible in nature. Such theoretical solutions had only been studied under the simplifying assumption that the material doing the gravitational collapsing is a perfect sphere. The question was whether the resulting singularity was simply an artifact of that perfect spherical symmetry — something possible on paper, but preposterous in nature.\n\nPenrose showed that, as he put it in his 1965 paper, “deviations from spherical symmetry cannot prevent space-time singularities from arising.” In other words, even when a star is distorted, it will still collapse down to a point. He showed this by introducing the notion of a “trapped surface,” as well as a now-famous diagrammatic scheme for analyzing how the surface sits inside space-time. Unlike a regular surface, which can have light rays shooting away from it in any direction, a trapped surface is a closed two-dimensional surface that — even when distorted so it’s no longer a sphere — only allows light rays to go one way: toward the center point.\n\nPenrose found that the dimensions of space and time switch roles inside a trapped surface. Time is the direction pointing toward the center, so that escaping a black hole is as impossible as going back in time. Penrose, together with Stephen Hawking, soon showed that a similar analysis applies to the entire universe: A singularity would have inevitably existed when matter and energy were densely packed together in the Big Bang.\n\nHow do we observe black holes?\n\nWe detect their invisible presence in several ways. Gravitational wave detectors sense black hole collisions by measuring the resulting stretching and squeezing of space-time. The Event Horizon Telescope uses a global network of telescopes to view, at astonishingly high resolution, the bright ring of light just outside a supermassive black hole’s event horizon. But such direct observations have only happened in the past five years.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, astronomers began observing the enormous amount of energy released by the distant objects called quasars. The researchers suspected that quasars were actually supermassive black holes that were pulling in huge amounts of gas and dust. Around the same time, telescopes detected X-rays coming from stars that shouldn’t have been able to produce the radiation on their own. The researchers ultimately concluded that invisible companion black holes must be sucking away the stars’ matter and generating the light.\n\nAs for the black hole at the center of our own Milky Way, the first hint of its presence was detected in 1931, when the pioneering radio astronomer Karl Jansky observed a radio signal coming from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. Then in 1974, the radio astronomers Bruce Balick and Robert Brown pinpointed the bright and compact object in the galactic center that became known as Sagittarius A*. Further observations in the 1990s built more evidence for the presence of super heavy objects in galactic centers, but better technology and clever new observing strategies were needed before astronomers could definitively show that these central anchors were supermassive black holes."
