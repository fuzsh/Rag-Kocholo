Cloth. 8vo, publisher's black cloth with gold lettering on spine and lettering stamped on front cover; illustrated with tables, diagrams, and several formulae; vi, [vii-viii] + 172 pages. Near Fine / None / Archival mylar added. Item #8110\n\nSir Joseph John Thomson OM PRS (1856 â€“ 1940) was a British Nobel Laureate in Physics (awarded April, 1906) credited with the discovery of the electron, the first subatomic particle to be discovered.\n\nThis volume is an expansion of six lectures by Prof. J. J. Thomson given at the Royal Institution during the Spring of 1906--very near the time of his Nobel Prize given \"in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.\"\n\nThe volume is a clear account of the development of the corpuscular, or, electronic subatomic theory of matter to explain the passage of electricity through metals and gases. The last two chapters deal with the properties of model atoms built up of corpuscles, and evidence tending to demonstrate that the number of the corpuscles in an atom is about the same as its atomic weight in terms of hydrogen.\n\nThe first British edition was published in London by Archibald Constable and Co,, Ltd. in the same year as this First American edition, 1907.\n\nPrinting and the Mind of Man, 386, & The Scientific 100 where \"Joseph J. Thomson and the Discovery of the Electron\" is listed as #31 (pp.152 - 155).\n\nTight, clean copy with unfoxed pages. Light wear and a few specks to the cloth."
