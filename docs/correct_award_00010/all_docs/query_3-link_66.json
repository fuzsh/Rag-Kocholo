        "text": "Interesting J.J. Thomson Facts: Joseph John Thomson was born in Manchester, England and was the eldest son of a bookshop owner. He showed great academic promise at an early age and was admitted to Owens College at the young age of 14. In 1876 he entered Trinity College, University of Cambridge where he received his B.A in mathematics in 1880. He became a Fellow of Trinity College in 1881 and received his MA with honors there in 1883. His Master's thesis, Treatise on the motion of vortex rings, described the mathematics of William Thomson's vortex theory of atoms. He published several important papers on mathematical and experimental electromagnetism. He theorized the electromagnetic mass of a charged particle and demonstrated that speed increased the mass of a charged particle. On 12 June 1884 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society and on December 22 of that year became Cavendish Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge. In 1887 he measured the heat generated by cathode rays and found that they were 1000 times lighter than the hydrogen atom and that their mass was the same as that of the atom from which they were generated. In 1888 he published Applications of dynamics to physics and chemistry in which he stated the mathematics of the transformation of energy. In April 1897 he discovered that cathode rays could be defected by a magnetic field and that their fluorescent path was the same regardless of the material or gas used. This finding suggested that cathode rays were of the same form independent of their origin. He published many papers laying down the mathematical models for James Maxwell's theories in electromagnetism. In 1906 he demonstrated that hydrogen had only one electron per atom. He designed instruments to pas cathode rays through a magnetic field and he was the first to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of cathode rays. In 1908 he was knighted for his contributions to science and in 1912 he received the Order of Merit."
