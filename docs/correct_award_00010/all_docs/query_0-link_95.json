        "text": "Hyderabad: In 1918, he became Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he remained until his death. Joseph John Thomson died on 30 August 1940 at the age of 83. His ashes rest in Westminster Abbey, near the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and his former student, Ernest Rutherford.\n\nAwards and Recognition\n\nPlaque commemorating J. J. Thomson's discovery of the electron outside the old Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge\n\nAdams Prize (1882)\n\nRoyal Medal (1894)\n\nHughes Medal (1902)\n\nNobel Prize for Physics (1906)\n\nElliott Cresson Medal (1910)\n\nCopley Medal (1914)\n\nFranklin Medal (1922)\n\nIn 1991, the Thomson (symbol: Th) was proposed as a unit to measure the mass-to-charge ratio in mass spectrometry in his honor.\n\nJ J Thomson Avenue, on the University of Cambridge campus, is named after Thomson.\n\nIn November 1927, J.J. Thomson opened the Thomson building, named in his honor, in the Leys School, Cambridge.\n\nEducation & Career\n\nHis early education was in small private schools where he demonstrated outstanding talent and interest in science. In 1870 he was admitted to Owens College at the unusually young age of 14.\n\n.He moved on to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1876. In 1880 he obtained his BA in mathematics (Second Wrangler in the Tripos and 2nd Smith's Prize). He applied for and became a Fellow of Trinity College in 1881.\n\nThompson received his MA (with Adams Prize) in 1883. Thomson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 12 June 1884 and served as President of the Royal Society from 1915 to 1920.\n\nOn 22 December 1884 Thomson was chosen to become Cavendish Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge\n\n.The appointment caused considerable surprise, given that candidates such as Richard Glazebrook were older and more experienced in laboratory work. Thomson was known for his work as a mathematician, where he was recognized as an exceptional talent.\n\nHe was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1906, \"in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.\" He was knighted in 1908 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1912. In 1914, he gave the Romanes Lecture in Oxford on \"The atomic theory\".\n\nSome of the books written by him are:-\n\nThe Structure of Light (1907)\n\nThe Corpuscular Theory of Matter (1907)\n\nRays of Positive Electricity (1913)\n\nThe Electron in Chemistry (1923), etc"
