In 1897 he was the first to suggest the subatomic particle (electron) though this study of the properties of cathode rays.\n\nThomson was also a remarkable teacher and headed up the famous Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. Six of his research students won Nobel Prizes in Physics (Charles Glover Barkla, Niels Bohr, Max Born, William Henry Bragg, Owen Willans Richardson and Charles Thomson Rees Wilson) and two won Nobel Prizes for Chemistry (Ernest Rutherford and Francis William Aston).\n\nThomson's son also became a Nobel Prize winner, George Paget Thomson won in 1937 for work also on Electrons.\n\nBorn: December 18, 1856\n\nBirthplace: Manchester, England\n\nStar Sign: Sagittarius"
