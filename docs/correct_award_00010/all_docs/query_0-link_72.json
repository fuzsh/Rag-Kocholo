A pioneer of nuclear physics, Thomson's groundbreaking discoveries revolutionized our understanding of the atomic world. Born in 1856, Thomson is best known for his momentous discovery of the electron. In his experiments on cathode rays at Cambridge University in 1896, he demonstrated that these rays were composed of particles with a negative charge and were significantly smaller than an atom. These minute particles were later named electrons. Thomson's remarkable contributions to science earned him numerous accolades throughout his career. In 1906, he was awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize for Physics for his revolutionary work on electrical conductivity in gases. Two years later, he received knighthood as recognition for his outstanding achievements. This monochrome portrait showcases Thomson's intellectual prowess and determination as he gazes intently into the camera lens. His profound impact on scientific knowledge during the early twentieth century cannot be overstated. As we admire this timeless image captured by an unknown creator from Heritage Images, we are reminded of Sir Joseph J Thomson's indelible mark on history and how his pioneering spirit continues to inspire generations of scientists worldwide.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
