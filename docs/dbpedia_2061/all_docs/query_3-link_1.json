        "text": "Taylor Swift is a queen of the modern pop world. But when she joins forces with other artists, especially ones at the top of their game, the songs are automatically a cultural event. Big or small, artists who work with Swift always seem to pair with her voice perfectly — which is probably why she’s done a number of duets throughout her career.\n\nFrom her first-ever recorded duet with Colbie Caillat on her mainstream breakthrough album Fearless to a handful of remix features with artists such as Ed Sheeran, Kendrick Lamar and Haim, Billboard has rounded up a whopping 32 collaborations Swift has under her belt. We will note that there could be more or less depending on how you define a collaboration. She’s worked with a number of hit-making producers, from Jack Antonoff to Max Martin. She also has a few notable uncredited vocalists and backing vocalists throughout her catalog, including Imogen Heap on “Clean” and Marcus Mumford on “Cowboy Like Me.” There are a couple of live tracks — “Should’ve Said No” with Jonas Brothers and “Big Star” with Kenny Chesney. And we will never forget her teenage-friendly rap track “Thug Story” with T-Pain. But to keep it concise, this list includes only studio-recorded tracks with collaborators credited as a feature.\n\nNow, this ranking was no easy feat. With more than 200 entries on the Billboard Hot 100, there’s no doubt Swift is a hitmaker. But even Swifties can agree that some songs simply bop harder than others. “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” with Zayn, for example, is both fresh and focused — and has a Grammy nomination to show for it. “ME!,” featuring Panic! At the Disco frontman Brendon Urie, on the other hand … well, let’s just say it’s not our favorite. (The music video was fun, though.)\n\nCheck out where every single one of Swift’s collaborations lands on Billboard‘s ranking below."
