        "text": "More Post Malone\n\nAfter a leaked list of the features set to be included on Post Maloneâs forthcoming debut country album, F-1 Trillion, made waves on Countrytown last week, the singer has finally revealed what we can expect from his new LP.\n\nUnveiling the official tracklist via a dramatic full-page layout in partnership with The Tennessean, the rapper-turned-country star has honoured the genre heâs entering and is having a little fun with his album rollout.\n\nNow that weâve seen the official tracklist â which Post Malone also shared on Instagram with the caption âAugust 16thâ, reminding fans of the albumâs release date â we know that the leak was accurate when it came to the artists listed, but the order was all over the place. While many of the songs include features, three solo songs are also on the record: What Donât Belong To Me, Right About You, and the album closer, Yours.\n\nPost Malone opens F-1 Trillion with Wrong Ones, a collaboration with Tim McGraw.
