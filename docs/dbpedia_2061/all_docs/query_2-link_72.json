        "text": "Lil Wayne has unleashed a new compilation album, I Am Music, featuring some of the biggest songs from his decorated catalog — check it out below.\n\nThe project was released by surprise on Friday (March 31) and comes equipped with 18 tracks spanning Wayne’s almost 30-year career. Among them are hits like “A Milli,” “6 Foot 7 Foot,” “Go DJ,” “Fireman” and “Lollipop” — the latter of which earned Weezy his first diamond plaque last year.\n\nHis latest single, the DMX-sampling, Swizz Beatz-produced “Kant Nobody,” is also included, along with heavyweight collaborations with Eminem (“Drop the World”), JAY-Z (“Mr. Carter”), Drake (“She Will,” “Right Above It” and Kendrick Lamar (“Mona Lisa”).\n\nThe compilation shares its name with the New Orleans native’s 2009 I Am Music Tour, which came in support of his Grammy-winning sixth album Tha Carter III.\n\nStream I Am Music below:\n\nI Am Music is Lil Wayne’s first full-length release since Trust Fund Babies, the joint project he released — to an underwhelming reception — with Rich The Kid in October 2021.\n\nDespite having a rather quiet 2022 on the music front, the Young Money leader has plenty in store for the year ahead. His next album is expected to be the sixth entry in his flagship Tha Carter series, which he first teased at Drake’s October World Weekend festival in Toronto last summer.\n\nSince then, Tunechi has fueled the anticipation by teasing studio sessions with the likes of Juelz Santana and Wyclef Jean, both of whom he’s released hits with in the past.\n\nWhile a release date has yet to be announced, Tha Carter 6‘s arrival could coincide with Wayne’s Welcome To The Carter Tour, which takes him across North America between April 4 and May 13.\n\nWeezy’s classic 2006 mixtape Dedication 2 is also set to make its debut on streaming services this year, DJ Drama announced earlier this month.\n\n“It wasn’t original music, so it couldn’t go on streaming platforms, and I just feel like today, in 2023, if we going to do it, let’s do it, and it might take a little bit of time and be done,” Drama said during an interview with the Rap Radar Podcast.\n\n“We are dropping Dedication 2 on streaming platforms this year, and it’s gonna have some new music along with it. That’s pretty exciting.”"
