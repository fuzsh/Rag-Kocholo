        "text": "In summary: “If After The Fall can continue to write songs of this calibre, then hopefully we’ll continue to hear music from them for quite some time.” It’s been what seems like much longer then the three years since we heard from Sydney siders ‘After The Fall’ who you may remember from songs such as ‘Mirror Mirror’, ‘The Fighter’ and […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nSelf described as “that old guy with a beard”, Jamie Hay is a name that would be well familiar amongst those into the local Aussie punk rock scene, with past bands including Conation, A Death In The Family, Fear Like Us. For some, myself included, your very first introduction to “that old guy with a beard” could very well be […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nWhilst music has always been a lifelong passion of NRL legend Eric Grothe Jnr, retiring from the NRL at the end of 2010 allowed full devotion to his band Shinobi which he fronts as vocalist and guitarist. The songs that he had been progressively writing over the course of the last 12 or so years now finally get their moment […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn 25 words or less: “a powerful assault of anthemic modern rock meets metal, high on blistering guitar solos, massive choruses, intricate arrangements and topped off with a quality sound/production that belies their independent status.” Whilst the name Moments Apart may be a new entity in the Melbourne music scene, the members thereof will certainly not be new to those […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn 25 words or less: “Expect Twelve Foot Ninja’s Silent Machine to be one of the most talked about albums over the coming months in Australian music.” Melbourne’s Twelve Foot Ninja are not a band to do things by halves. In the lead up to the release of this, their debut album Silent Machine, the band have embarked on a campaign they […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn 25 words or less: Melodic power metal at it’s finest from one of Australia’s premiere metal bands. Australia has some truly world class metal bands that more than hold their own on the world wide stages Just on four fingers, you have Voyager from Perth, Lord from Sydney and Melbourne’s duo of Eyefear and Black Majesty. Whilst Voyager have […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nCertainly no “strangers” to us here at May The Rock Be With You, we’ve been patiently awaiting the full length album release Persona Non Grata from these Sydney rockers for a little while now. Having seen them earlier this year supporting the like of The Darkness and Calling All Cars, Strangers deliver a brand of rock that is devoid of […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn Summary: “I’ve already played ‘Diamond Days’ through a number of times and it’s an album that I will happily continue to listen to…” It’s always a daunting task for any member of a band to step out and go solo, especially when taking the vocal lead, but even more so when you’re the co-founder and drummer in one of […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn 25 words or less: With summer on the horizon and a sun drenched film clip to match, While We’re Young just screams summer anthem. By no means a stranger to the Australian Country Music scene, Newcastle born and bred Morgan Evans looks set to finally capitalise on his musical journey over the past five years, with new EP While […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn 25 words or less: To me this is a fresh but classic rock sounding album and I dig it. It is so awesome to hear this kind of sound coming from Australia, to me this is a fresh but classic rock sounding album and I dig it. Redcoats out of Melbourne have released this, their debut self-titled album today […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn summary – “If you think you know Grinspoon, you probably don’t. This new album is fresh, it’s rockin’ and it’s relevant.” When you’ve been a band for seventeen years, it must be tough to keep yourself motivated, to come up with something fresh, yes many bands go through the ‘what do I want to be today?’ phase, but Australian […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nFollowing hot on the heels of their EP release earlier this year, Melbourne four piece The Hiding return with a two track single/EP titled Lonely Diaries. The bands first EP delivered an anthemic, textured style of pop rock and for fans of The Hiding, as I certainly am, you will be pleased to know that style hasn’t changed. Lantern Lights […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nAs I learnt recently when interviewing Sydney singer/songwriter Wes Carr about his new musical endeavour, when Native American Indians used to dream of a Buffalo, it meant that they would return to their heritage and back to their roots again Well after winning Australia Idol back in 2009, the years that have followed since have been about Wes Carr discovering […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nWhilst Perth, Australia may not be spoken of by us East Coast Aussies as having a thriving rock scene, with the tyranny of distance involved, I guess we have to put that down to perhaps our own ignorance and failure to explore what Perth has to offer as far as a rock scene. I guess we can’t argue with the […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn a career now spanning nearly 25 years and having made a huge impact on the rock scenes both in their native New Zealand and current home here in Australia, Shihad recognise this in pretty much the best way possible, with the release of a 38 song double disc titled The Meanest Hits and armed with a new single Right […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nI personally love getting new music, and I don’t mean ‘oh awesome the new Bon Jovi record is out!’ I’m talking about new bands I’ve never heard of, I get to make my own mind up, I have no preconceived ideas or notion of what they will sound like and I dig that. Today, I get presented to me Fait […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn 25 words or less: ‘The Brightest Light’ is fresh, it’s new, it’s diverse, it’s rockin’ and King Cannons may just be your new favourite band. I’ve been excited about this pending release from the second I heard ‘Take The Rock’ from King Cannons’ debut EP back in 2010… yeah, that long I personally have been waiting for this debut […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nThird albums are generally an interesting enough prospect in themselves for both band and fan, but combine that with some lineup changes, releasing said third album via a new record label and on the back of all six band members making the commitment to basically drop everything and head to Sweden with the determination to come back with a career […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nThe Delta Riggs have been kicking around now for the best part of around 5 years or so, and on this, their latest EP, this really shows, for this is one heck of a great rock ‘n’ roll release from one very tight, highly capable band. With fellow bands like Stonefield and My Dynamite currently blazing the trail of Aussie […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nMelbourne four piece The Hiding have recently released their debut EP, which given the comparative success of the anthemic, textured style of pop rock that they play, it’s an EP with a potential massive reach not only here in Australia, but undoubtedly the USA. Million Miles Away opens the EP with it’s boundless energy and electro rock tinges, whilst 6 […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn 25 words or less: Great songs, perfect harmonies, and an overall well-made modern country rock record. You should know by now that we cover a wide range of Rock music here at May The Rock Be With You, and one of my personal favourite genres is the new breed of ‘Country Rock’. Gone are the days of the traditional […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn 25 words or less: “This is the best album that The Black Crowes never released and for that, I am thankful that I now have a follow up to Shake Your Money Maker.” Being Melbourne based myself, I’m somewhat shamed to say that I’ve only been witness to one My Dynamite live performance, in what must be their 3 […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nRelocating from their native Perth, to Melbourne, the undisputed “rock capital” of Australia, Gasoline INC may have endured some relatively hard times navigating their way through the maze of the newly adopted Melbourne scene, but undoubtedly their new EP The Wanted One should be the beacon that lights their way. Ok, so did that beacon comment sound corny?…well, I was […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIn 25 words or less: “With enough rock chops to mix it with the hard rockers, they have enough catchiness and hooks for those who simply appreciate catchy rock.” Sydney rockers Neon Heart have been plying their craft for a few years now and on this their second EP, they deliver five tracks of some pretty addictive kick ass rock. […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nIt’s as hard to believe that 14 years has passed by since Cold Chisel’s last studio album, Last Wave Of Summer, as it is to then ponder that it’s now been some 28 years since the album before that, Twentieth Century, when Cold Chisel “broke up”. No Plans, the newly released seventh studio album from arguably Australia’s most iconic rock band, […]\n\nRead more ›\n\n“Hoodlum Shouts” – well there’s a band name that if you haven’t heard their music before, would conjure up many different possibilities as to the style of music they play. Hailing from the nation’s capital Canberra, throughout this, their debut full length album, the Hoodlum Shouts deliver nearly 50 minutes of brooding Australiana punk country tinged alternative rock that has […]\n\nRead more ›"
