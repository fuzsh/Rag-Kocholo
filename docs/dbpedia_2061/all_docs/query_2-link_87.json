        "text": "While RIIZE might be a more recent addition to the K-pop scene, you wouldn’t be able to tell.\n\nRIIZE took the industry by storm last September with their debut single \"Get A Guitar.\" The catchy, retro-synth pop song sold over a million copies in the first week of its release.\n\nFrom their debut in 2023, RIIZE was determined to carve out a space for themselves in the expansive K-pop landscape by performing \"emo pop\" — emotional ballads that still manage to be danceable, evoking the sounds of older gen groups like Got 7 and Super Junior — while also experimenting with other genres. The brightly alluring \"Love 119\" and disco whirlwind \"Talk Saxy\" allowed RIIZE to continue their ascent, and netted the group Favorite New Artist and Rookie Of The Year honors at multiple Korean award ceremonies last year.\n\nOn June 17, they'll release RIIZING - The 1st Mini Album. The compilation record features all of the rookie group's releases plus an additional song \"Boom Boom Bass,\" and demonstrates their versatility and willingness to experiment with genres. With their output compiled, it's easy to see that RIIZE's youthful energy and distinct personalities truly shine.\n\nLearn more: 11 Rookie K-Pop Acts To Know In 2024: NCT Wish, RIIZE, Kiss Of Life & More\n\n\"We wanted to reflect on how far we’ve come from our debut days and growing as artists,\" Anton tells GRAMMY.com over a video call from L.A. \"[The album is] a culmination of our journey and experiences as young adults who are pursuing their dreams.\"\n\nIt’s clear that RIIZE are enjoying the ride they're on together. They laugh at each other's jokes and finish each other's sentences, demonstrating that there's deep friendship behind their already tight harmonious connection. The group is in the midst of an international fan-con tour that runs through the summer — an experience that will, likely, deepen their already close bond.\n\nIn an interview, RIIZE’s Sungchan, Anton, Wonbin, Sohee, Eunseok and Shotaro offer a track-by-track breakdown of RIIZING - The 1st Mini Album, including the creative process behind each song, how they keep themselves motivated, and their musical dreams for the future.\n\n\"Siren\" is your pre-debut song and was one of your most anticipated releases. Can you share a bit about the creation process and how it felt to release this song to the world?\n\nShotaro: We have a lot of fond memories when we think of \"Siren\" as it reminds us of our trainee days. We recorded the song while we were still rookies and shot the video in L.A. I remember being in the studio and encouraging each other to give our best deep voices to make our voices shine.\n\nEunseok: I think a large part of why people like \"Siren\" so much is the rhythmic drum beats and soft piano riffs that creates this high rush vibe. The chorus is my favorite, and was the most fun to sing as it’s very addictive to sing along to.\n\nYour most recent song, \"Impossible\" is a house track about being determined and never giving up. Were you nervous at all venturing into a new genre?\n\nAnton: Growth and youth is a huge part of our music, and that’s something we sought to achieve with \"Impossible.\" House music is a genre that is not usually seen in K-pop, but this is something we wanted to experiment with. So we learned firsthand from long-time house music creatives and input their suggestions into the recording. It was a new experience that allowed us to deep dive into a genre we wouldn’t normally be familiar with.\n\nSohee: The recording was a little difficult at first, because the vocal keys were a bit higher than our usual pitch. But I feel like we successfully encapsulated the genre very well.\n\nYour new song — the special addition to the EP — is called \"Boom Boom Bass.\" It's a disco-influenced track about playing bass guitar; does anyone in RIIZE have experience playing that instrument?\n\nWonbin: We do have experience playing the bass guitar. Getting to recreate those moments in the studio was awesome, and you can hear the excitement in our voices. The song also showcases a totally different side of us that fans haven’t seen before: it’s disco but funk and still pop.\n\n\"Love 119\" is one of your most successful songs. Can you take me back to the day you recorded it?\n\nSungchan: \"Love 119\" captures the feeling of falling in love for the first time in a dreamy and melancholic manner. We decided to recreate that in the studio and put a lot of our emotions into it by channeling good energy.\n\nWonbin: The song samples a beloved Korean song, \"Emergency Room,\" released by the band called IZI in 2005. The song captures the distinct charm of emotional pop, offering a different appeal compared to \"Get A Guitar,\" \"Memories,\" and \"Talk Saxy.\"\n\nShotaro: We aimed to create choreography that many people could follow. While brainstorming in the practice room with Wonbin, he and I came up with dance moves like the \"1-1-9\" gesture, that you see in the video. The song has a really bright vibe, making it fun for us to perform.\n\nCan you detail the creative process behind \"Talk Saxy\"?\n\nSohee: We started creating \"Talk Saxy\" right after performing at KCON L.A. in July last year and we learned the choreography almost immediately.\n\nWe wanted to embody a more confident and breezy sound but still within our niche genre of emotional pop. It took a few weeks of practice to get the perfect take and I think the song helped expand our musical sound by a large mile.\n\nRead more: 9 Thrilling Moments From KCON 2023 L.A.: Stray Kids, RIIZE, Taemin & More\n\nOne of your more recent singles, \"9 Days,\" focuses on your journey as a band. Did you find yourselves feeling nostalgic in the studio?\n\nSungchan: \"9 days\" has a more natural feel because while we were making the song, we had to reference back to our trainee days in practice. The lyrics are a very detailed description of our trainee days and who we were before debuting.\n\nAnton: I would say we had a fun time in the studio because it felt like we were finally telling our story ourselves and being able to share that with our fans is the best.\n\n\"Honestly\" reminisces about past love. What, or who, were you thinking about while recording it?\n\nWonbin: I think we really aimed to capture the theme of putting yourself first and saying a final goodbye to someone you thought the world of. That resonates throughout the song, especially in the lyrics. It’s an emo pop ballad at its core.\n\n\"One Kiss\" was RIIZE's first foray into emo pop and sets you apart from other groups as you highlight your vulnerability. How did you go about finding that sound?\n\nAnton: I see \"One Kiss\" as a song made with our fans in mind, we had a hands on approach with making the video as we wanted it to come from our hearts.\n\nSohee: I would not say we have found our sound yet as we are still growing and experimenting. We hope to create more good songs like \"One Kiss\" in the future.\n\nYou’re in the midst of a fan-con tour, what has been your favorite city to tour so far?\n\nShotaro: We love every city equally, we started off in Korea and felt right at home. In Japan, we had so much eye contact with the crowd as they were very hands on. Previously, in Mexico, the crowd's energy was infectious and awesome.\n\nWhat are your plans for the second half of this year?\n\nSungchan: We plan on finishing off our fan-con tour by the end of August. Our fans can expect to see us at end of the year award shows with bigger and better performances from last year.\n\n11 Rookie K-Pop Acts To Know In 2024: NCT Wish, RIIZE, Kiss Of Life & More\n\nIn 2005, South Korean producer and songwriter Bang Si-Hyuk (aka \"hitman\" Bang) founded Bit Hit Entertainment. Only eight years later, he finished assembling what would come to be the label’s groundbreaking boy group, BTS. The rest is history, now chronicled in \"HYBE: We Believe In Music,\" the first full-floor K-pop exhibit at the GRAMMY Museum, which runs through Sept. 15.\n\nFollowing the success of Bit Hit’s premier act, and that of other artists under acquired labels SOURCE MUSIC and PLEDIS Entertainment, the company eventually evolved to become HYBE in 2021. \"I think HYBE is very special in that they have gone beyond being just a K-pop company,\" says Kelsey Goelz, curator of the exhibit. \"They have many different sub labels. They’ve come to America and gotten involved in the music business here, and then they’re also working in AI and gaming.\"\n\nBut beyond its global presence, one of K-pop’s ever-captivating elements is the sheer amount of blood, sweat, and tears that goes into making it possible, even when HYBE artists like ENHYPEN, SEVENTEEN, and LE SSERAFIM make it look easy. There’s a core humanity to this work ethic and dogged tenacity — to the level of artistry in general — that speaks to K-pop fans around the world.\n\nWhile HYBE’s growth shows no signs of slowing down yet, the GRAMMY Museum exhibit takes a look back on the entertainment company’s legacy thus far. Read on for the five things we learned from the \"HYBE: We Believe In Music\" exhibit.\n\nAll photos Courtesy of the Recording Academy™️/photo by Rebecca Sapp, Getty Images© 2024.\n\nIn A Decade, BTS Built Themselves IntoA Global Phenomenon\n\nLet’s start with a history lesson: despite being around for almost a decade, HYBE’s story begins in earnest with the formation of one of K-pop’s breakthrough acts, BTS, in 2013. (At that point, the company was still a standalone label.) Led by rapper RM, the seven boys hopped off a yellow school bus with a bratty, adolescent attitude — and that’s where the GRAMMY Museum’s exhibit picks up.\n\nThere’s a lot that happened between then and their seven Billboard No. 1s. Luckily, a wallpapered timeline breaks down all the major global highlights: the first U.S. tour, their UNICEF campaign, a landmark performance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and the announcement of BTS as TIME’s 2020 Entertainer of the Year, to name just a few.\n\nSitting in the middle of the museum floor is a glass case of polaroids — in them, Jin, Suga, j-hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook toss up peace signs while sporting novelty hats designed to look like BTS’s lightstick. Nostalgic and deeply silly, these photos date back to 2017 and 2018, serving as a reminder of the colossal strides BTS has taken in the intervening years.\n\nLearn more: Breaking Down Every Solo Act From BTS: Singles, Debut Albums & What's Next For The Septet\n\nIt Takes A Village To Make A K-Pop Music Video\n\nWhen K-pop music videos are delivered to fans, they’re already finished products. Behind the curtain, it’s hard work to make them polished and perfect. Collected ‘fits and accessories throughout the exhibit get you up close and personal with creative details; then, to showcase the costumes in action, they’re paired with screens that play the finalized MVs.\n\nEach customized artifact is an expression of its respective group’s individuality, from ENHYPEN’s King of Pop-inspired \"Sweet Venom\" ensembles to BOYNEXTDOOR’s slouchy cabbie caps. Other standouts include belts and chains from &TEAM’s angsty \"Samidare,\" fromis_9’s opera-ready \"#menow\" jewels, and chunky necklaces featured in ILLIT’s runaway single \"Magnetic.\"\n\nEverything Comes Back To The Music\n\nHYBE’s proffered ethos is \"we believe in music\" — this motto gives the special exhibit its name, while also serving as a mission statement.\n\nIn a series of recorded interviews on view in the exhibit, HYBE’s idol songwriters share their process for and perspective on making music. The main takeaway: Inspiration comes in different forms. While writing, BTS’s j-hope pictures ideas as tree branches that sprout outward, while RM sees his rap verses as a realized world to live inside.\n\nLiterally, too, their lyrics mark the passage of time. If you’ve ever wondered why Suga circles back to motifs across the years, the rapper has all the answers for you here.\n\nThere’s also a conversation with WOOZI of SEVENTEEN, one of the K-pop industry’s most prolific idol composers with more than 150 credits to his name. It’s a penchant for plain language, he says, that makes the lyrics he writes really sing; the band’s beloved B-side \"Hug,\" for example, gets its potency from everyday words and phrases. TOMORROW X TOGETHER’s Yeonjun likewise fills visitors in on the origin story behind co-written \"Maze in the Mirror,\" a misty reflection of their tough trainee days.\n\nThis isn’t to say they haven’t had help, of course. Nearby, clips of HYBE producers Pdogg, BUMZU, and ZICO, settled in their respective studios, walk us through how the instrumentals for songs like BTS’s \"ON\" and SEVENTEEN’s \"Lilili Yabbay\" came to be. Peruse at your leisure — for those curious about the creation of K-pop’s biggest hits, this corner of the exhibit could easily take up the better part of a trip.\n\nFans Make K-Pop Special\n\nTo some fans, K-pop is more than just the music. As a sincere few explain in an exhibit video, K-pop is something that has profoundly touched their lives, providing the basis for genuine friendships and community. Fans get to give a little bit of this positive energy back to their idols, particularly through online platforms like HYBE’s Weverse, where users can interact directly with artists. \"I don’t think there’s another genre like K-pop that allows and enables that communication,\" Goetz, the curator, tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nIn true form, the GRAMMY Museum offers an interactive experience. At the exhibit’s opening event, fans posed next to their idols (digitally) in a photo booth, yelled K-pop’s national anthem into prop mics, and hit the dance floor with perfect renditions of LE SSERAFIM’s \"Perfect Nights\" choreography.\n\nBefore heading out, visitors could leave a mark of their own on the exhibit: after writing a message to their favorite artist via pastel Post-its and baby No. 2 pencils, fans loudly and proudly displayed them on the walls.\n\nHYBE’s Story Is Just Getting Started\n\nAccording to another timeline, the story so far has three chapters. There was the era of Big Hit Entertainment, when BTS came into the picture; then, the establishment of HYBE, with its many labels. Finally, as the U.S. and Latin America enter the fold, we’re in the end game. Representing this future is L.A.-based girl group KATSEYE, a collaboration with Geffen Records and the most recent inclusion to HYBE’s roster.\n\nBut K-pop hasn’t entirely let go of its \"K\" just yet, if the special guests for the exhibit’s launch were any indication. As the sun set over the GRAMMY Museum’s rooftop terrace, rookie boy group TWS kicked things off; before performing high-energy five songs back to back, the six boys charmed the audience by cutely cruising through a moderated conversation in English and Korean.\n\nAs the exhibit reveals, there’s a reason HYBE — and K-pop — went global in the first place. On top of the spectacle, their success has everything to do with the work that goes into making the effort seem effortless. Audiences root for real people, and that's what makes them keep coming back.\n\nMore K-Pop News\n\nHeld from July 26-29 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and Crypto.com Arena, KCON 2024 showcased an array of performances from K-pop stars, with notable acts including NCT 127, ENHYPEN, Taemin, ZEROBASEONE, and g.o.d. The event marked its largest success yet, attracting fans worldwide both in-person and through digital platforms.\n\nKCON, the biggest K-pop show in the world, has come a long way since its inception in 2012 at Irvine's Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre with around 10,000 attendees. Over a decade later, the music festival and convention event has expanded globally, but Los Angeles remains special as its origin. This year, KCON proclaimed its biggest success yet, stating, \"Over 5.9 million fans from more than 170 countries enjoyed KCON L.A. 2024 both at the festival site and through digital platforms.\" It was also broadcasted for the first time on the CW network in the U.S., and by its usual broadcaster Mnet in Korea and around the world.\n\nThis year's KCON featured a varied lineup for performers. The finale headliners were NCT 127, who last attended KCON L.A. in 2017 in their early days. They were joined by ENHYPEN and Taemin as nightly headliners. Rookie groups like ZEROBASEONE and Boynextdoor proved to be crowd favorites, while Y2K icons like g.o.d surprised the whole audience with 2000s hits. Despite fewer female performers, dynamic sets from NMIXX, Somi, and StayC made a significant impact.\n\nIt was generally a big year for rookie acts, with a variety of Korean, Japanese, and Filipino newer boy bands and girl groups making appearances throughout the weekend. As more senior artists hold solo tours, with many touring simultaneously to KCON, there was ample time to meet newcomers.\n\nEven L.A.-based Katseye, Hybe X Geffen Records' new girl group that features members from around the world, had a moment as the openers for the final night, performing live in front of fans for the very first time.\n\nRead on for memorable highlights, performances, and other insights from the annual event.\n\ng.o.d Ascend To New Heights\n\nAlthough the styles of the '90s and early aughts are trending, it was perhaps a bit of a surprise — to the crowd and artists alike — that one of Korea's early boy band greats could get the whole stadium up out of their seats, clapping, and swaying along to the R&B stylings of g.o.d.\n\nFormed in 1999, the quartet took the stage in suits and began their set with the ballad \"Road\" followed by \"Lie.\" While many fans came out specifically to see them, bearing banners and light blue balloon-shaped light sticks in support, it was the group's comfortable affability that made them one of KCON's most talked-about acts.\n\nBy having fun and being earnestly engaging, they won over a crowd largely made up of people unfamiliar with their discography. When they performed \"Sky Blue Balloon,\" a song dedicated to their fans, everyone clapped and sang along. As they turned on their phone flashlights (\"Give us 1% of your phone battery!\" quipped Cali-native Joon Park), the audience basked in the poignant closer \"One Candle,\" a song well-known in South Korea as a democratic anthem, creating a warm, memorable glow.\n\nZEROBASEONE Lead Rookie Power\n\nWhen they performed at the 2023 event, ZEROBASEONE, or ZB1, were charming newcomers who had just come together during K-pop competition show, \"Boys Planet.\" While ZB1 are not technically rookies anymore, they're still relatively new kids on the block compared to many senior acts. Despite their relative youth, at KCON LA 2024, they were one of the biggest draws for fans in attendance. Throughout the weekend, it was near impossible to move a foot or two without spotting one or two (or 10!) dedicated \"Zeroses\" cheering them on with a light stick that looks surprisingly similar to a rose-shaped engagement ring.\n\nFor fans lucky enough to attend multiple nights of KCON LA 2024, ZB1 performed both on Friday, July 26, and Sunday, July 28, showcasing fan favorites like \"Sweat,\" \"Crush,\" and \"In Bloom.\" They also shared a teaser for their new EP, Cinema Paradise, which will drop in August.\n\nAlong with ZB1, it was a big weekend for some other newer boy bands: Boynextdoor’s catchy, witty performances were some of the most-talked about, while TWS’s earworm hits had the whole arena singing along.\n\nENHYPEN Fulfill Dreams And Enhance Fantasies\n\nComing to KCON right after touring in the U.S. earlier this year could have meant repeat performances for ENHYPEN's \"Engenes\" to witness, but instead, the vampiric septet charmed with new energy just days after releasing their latest EP, Romance: Untold, on July 12.\n\nSurprising the crowd with the English version of that album's single \"XO (Only If You Say Yes)\", ENHYPEN ran through some of their biggest hits, seducing listeners with \"Bite Me\" and charming them with the picture-perfect \"Polaroid Love.\"\n\nThey also, along with Zico and Taemin, hosted one of KCON's unique \"Dream Stages,\" coming together with fan dancers to perform the English version of last year's smooth \"Sweet Venom.\"\n\nRead more: Meet ENHYPEN, K-Pop's Latest Breakout Boy Group\n\nA Welcome Return For NCT 127\n\nSeven years since their last KCON LA performance, NCT 127 appeared triumphant as both openers and closers on the third night of the show. They kicked the night off (literally) with their 2020 hit \"Kick It,\" and returned at the end of the night to perform their new song \"Walk,\" before renditions of hits \"Lemonade,\" \"2 Baddies,\" and \"Fact Check.\"\n\nIt was a moment of glory for the team, who had spent much of their biggest musical eras without touring during the pandemic. Now that concerts are back, they've been touring heavily. When their planned world tour, \"Neo City – The Unity,\" became an Asia-only tour, it felt like there would be no moment for Stateside fans in 2024. When they were announced as late-addition special headliners, NCTzens rapidly bought up tickets.\n\nWith the 127 members and their U.S. fans (plus many from overseas) reunited, the atmosphere was one of euphoria and exuberance as the members boisterously dominated the stage, making jokes and playfully engaging in a way that felt comfortable and assured in their performing prowess. It may not have been a full NCT 127 concert in LA, but it's clear that the stars and many fans are waiting for that.\n\nJeon Somi, Hyolyn & BIBI Shine\n\nWhile groups are the bread and butter of K-pop, soloists have their own flair, and this year the fiery spotlight fell on the women. During the final night, the powerful dynamism of BIBI, Jeon Somi, and Hyolyn took over. Although BIBI's real set was the first night, she performed a expletive-free version of her hit revenge track \"Bibi's Vengeance\" before embracing Hyolyn.\n\nHyolyn, a soloist and member of girl group Sistar, forwent her own songs for the concert event and instead put her own sultry spin on LOONA's \"So What\" with a team of fierce dancers.\n\nJeon Somi rounded out things with her truly addicting dance tracks \"Fast Forward\" and \"DUMB DUMB,\" along with the emotive \"The Way.\" She then revealed the name of her new upcoming song, \"Ice Cream\" and charmed the crowd by teaching them a call-and-response chant: \"Come get your ice cream,\" shouted one side of the arena. \"Too hot!\" returned the other before Somi realized with a laugh that the lyric actually was \"Too cold!\"\n\nRead more: 10 K-Pop Rookie Girl Groups To Watch In 2023\n\nFiery Covers Galore\n\nOne of the special things about KCON is the emphasis put on historic K-pop songs and events, with remakes and covers being a major part of every KCON. This year was no different, beginning with the first day's concert featuring P1Harmony's cover of BTS's \"Fire.\"\n\nIn 2016, when BTS performed \"Fire\" at KCON LA, the air was palpable with the feeling that something big was taking place. That set has often been cited as the moment many K-pop fans and music watchers realized BTS was on the brink of global superstardom. It was a fitting tribute to have P1Harmony, who had a major year on the festival and touring circuit, open up KCON LA with their own spin on the song the very first night of the event.\n\nOther acts also put their own spin on both recent hits and older classics throughout the nighttime concerts. The third night featured an homage to girl groups: along with Hyolyn covering LOONA, ZB1 covered Red Velvet's \"Psycho\" and STAYC covered (G)I-DLE's \"Queencard.\"\n\nThe Unsung Hero: The KCON Stage\n\nA rather unsuspecting, warehouse-style room next to the main convention floor was the secret sauce that brought a special touch to revitalize the decade-plus event by making it a true day-long music festival.\n\nWhile KCON LA had previously tried smaller nighttime concerts, concerts occasionally on the convention floor, and long-time had a meet-and-greet stage, this year's daytime KCON Stage that almost all artists visited was the sort of concert fans dream of.\n\nWhile the headlining M Countdown concerts were certainly the highlights of KCON LA 2024, the KCON Stage provided an intimate moment for artists and fans to get up-close and personal. Kicking off each morning with auditions for the Dream Stage performances with Taemin, ENHYPEN, and Zico for their respective night's events, the KCON Stage featured concert sets from a variety of artists throughout the day. Each day's KCON Stage performances were a bit more relaxed and raw compared to the highly choreographed made-for-TV nighttime shows.\n\nNMIXX, whose \"Run for Roses\" and \"Dice\" got the second night's crowd basking in their glory, was one such moment. The KCON Stage gave them a chance to bring some summertime fun with a bubble-blowing rendition of \"Love Me Like This.\"\n\nEven acts who are popular K-pop crowd pleasers but not part of the lineup for KCON's main concerts, like A.C.E and AleXa, had sets during the day. They, along with other acts like POW, Bibi, and Craxy, had KCON convention-goers perking up their ears at these unexpected concert moments.\n\nMore K-Pop News\n\nOn July 20, K-pop boy group ATEEZ stepped foot onto one of their largest stages yet for their first U.S. stadium show. The scene at Los Angeles’ open-air BMO Stadium was a far cry from the group's L.A. performance in 2019 — their first tour stop ever — at the petite Globe Theater, a former movie palace with a tenth of BMO’s capacity.\n\nEven then, as a five-month-old rookie group, fans (called ATINYs) saw a remarkable promise in Hongjoong, Seonghwa, Yunho, Yeosang, San, Mingi, Wooyoung, and Jongho. In the years since, ATEEZ has developed a growing presence in the States, even being the subject of a first-of-its-kind GRAMMY Museum pop-up. If the BMO Stadium performance was any indication, ATEEZ have officially hit their stride.\n\nRead more: Inside The GRAMMY Museum's ATEEZ & Xikers Pop-Up: 5 Things We Learned\n\nThe nearly sold-out July 20 show felt like a level up, and not just because of the size of the venue. \"As we performed, I really felt like ATEEZ has grown so much,\" singer Yunho said near the end of the night. He’s not wrong: they’re undoubtedly more confident than ever. Perhaps that’s because the octet made history earlier this year as the first K-pop boy group to perform at Coachella. Regardless, ATEEZ's growth in both production and showmanship was palpable.\n\nIf you missed ATEEZ’s two nights in L.A., don’t worry: K-pop’s resident pirate kings (more on that title later) have more up their billowy sleeves. In the spirit of their never-ending grind, the Towards the Light: Will to Power tour has nine more North American stops, including New York’s Citi Field. Read on to find out why you won’t want to miss these fast-rising K-pop idols.\n\nThe Members Are As Good Apart As Together\n\nATEEZ’s motto is \"eight makes one team\" for good reason. Individually, their talents and tastes are prismatic, yet complement each other perfectly — a fact that comes into startling clarity midway through the show, when the group breaks off into units and solos.\n\nEqual parts erotic and controlled, trap banger \"IT’S You\" gives Yeosang, San, and Wooyoung room to deploy their enigmatic charms as a trio; ATEEZ’s purveyor of belted high notes, Jongho, dips into his deeper register on solo ballad \"Everything\"; diametric duo Hongjoong and Seonghwa spit fire about the rapport that arises from their differences on red-hot cypher \"MATZ\": \"M-A-T-Z like allergy, we don’t really fit together / Yeah, yeah, but on stage, reacting to that synergy.\"\n\nThen there’s the wistful \"Youth\" from dance class pals Yunho and Mingi. The two go way back — something they reminded audiences of by acting out a fictionalized version of a real phone call they shared the day before auditioning for KQ Entertainment. \"Imagine us taking the stage together someday,\" Yunho said. \"Sounds amazing, right?\"\n\nRead more: ATEEZ Are Here To Win The Hearts Of K-Pop Fans\n\nATEEZ Know How To Turn Up The Drama\n\nATEEZ's lore runs deep. In their conceptual universe, what began as a swashbuckling tale of pirates in search of treasure evolved into an anarchic manifesto about toppling the world order. Recently, in a Wild West turn, they’ve been masquerading as cowboys dedicated to the daily hustle.\n\nEvery ATEEZ performance has a story; on this tour, the theme is light. But, as always in ATEEZ’s oeuvre, that light can’t exist without a darkness seeking to quash it. The way they convey this narrative — acting, stage decoration, extras — is a masterclass in drama, fit for the theater as much as a stadium.\n\nWatch: Global Spin: Watch Ateez Represent South Korea With Kinetic Performance Of \"The Real\"\n\nThey’re In Their Element Onstage\n\nThe success of ATEEZ’s storytelling is bolstered by the group’s unearthly stage presence. In that regard, Seonghwa led the pack, moving like a man possessed. Whether crawling on his knees, rolling his eyes back, or slinging a sword to symphonic backing, the lithe dancer never let the air-tight facade slip — except, of course, when it came time to offer a couple of warm words to fans.\n\nLike Seonghwa, the rest are also shockingly versatile. San effortlessly switches between agile body rolls and thigh caresses in the dangerously sensual \"Cyberpunk,\" then vigorously glides his arms through air at the climax of \"Say My Name,\" a gesture that has only grown in power and potency over time.\n\nATINYs Do Their Best To Match ATEEZ’s Energy\n\n\"There [are] more than 20,000 singers in here,\" Hongjoong said as the lead-in to the soaring \"Dance Like Butterfly Wings.\" \"Can you show me your singing?\"\n\nSing they did: All night, the crowd brought an energy as fierce and passionate as ATEEZ, especially when barking at charismatic rapper Mingi, much to his apparent enjoyment.\n\nBut the single noisiest moment came during \"Guerilla.\" At a certain point, Yunho shouted a ferocious \"Make some noise!\" as a cue and ATINYs know it’s time to warm up their vocal chords; while Jongho belts some of his highest notes yet, fans roared \"Break the wall!\" at the top of their lungs, loud enough to rise above the stadium enclosure.\n\nFan chants and cheers are a mainstay of K-pop shows in South Korea, but due to differences in concert etiquette and language barriers, most don’t make their way overseas. ATEEZ and their fans broke that wall, and built a bridge in its place.\n\nIt’s A Full Circle Moment In Their Career\n\nThat ATEEZ chose to drop anchor in Los Angeles for their first U.S. stadium show feels especially momentous. The band has history in Southern California, having trained at L.A.-based dance studios Movement Lifestyle and Millenium Dance Center prior to their debut. (\"Our second hometown!\" San said during the show.)\n\n\"Even though it was six years ago, it feels like just yesterday,\" Hongjoong said in his encore speech. \"It’s absolutely an honor to be right here, now, in such a big venue.\"\n\nThat’s a short time to come as far as they have, without slowing pace. \"But, you know, it doesn’t stop,\" Hongjoong continued. \"We will keep going to the next step and the next step, with you. Let’s keep making moments to shine even brighter, together.\" And if these three hours are any indication, ATEEZ has a light that won’t soon be dimmed.\n\nMore News About ATEEZ"
