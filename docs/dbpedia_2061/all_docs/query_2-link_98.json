        "text": "Plastician has revealed full details of Plasticman Remastered, a retrospective of his releases under his old Plasticman alias.\n\nSpeaking to FACT earlier this year, Plastician explained that “I re-opened the original .flp Fruityloops files in the same versions of the software they were built in at the time and bounced them as wavs completely flat. I’ve not added any new effects or eq to any of them. They all contain exactly the same sounds and mix settings as they did in the early ’00s, even as basic as they are I felt it would be wrong to change anything.”\n\nThe compilation will be released on July 14. A deluxe version of the album will be available exclusively on the Terrorhythm Bandcamp page, and will include 4 exclusive unreleased tracks – ‘Cha VIP’ (which will be available immediately for anyone who pre-orders the album), ‘The Lift VIP’, and two previously unreleased originals, ‘Deep’ and We Like The Dark’, a collaboration between Plastician and Skream which dates back to 2002.\n\nFollowing Plasticman Remastered, Terrorythm will release three remix EPs, with artists such as Wen, Inkke, Kahn & Neek and Starkey remixing Plasticman tracks. Volume 3 will also be released as a limited 12″ white label.\n\nArtwork comes from Sean Knowles.\n\nPlasticman Remastered Tracklist:\n\n1. Venom\n\n2. Shockwave\n\n3. Hard Graft\n\n4. The Lift\n\n5.
