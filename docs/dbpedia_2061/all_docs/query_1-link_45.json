        "text": "1 minute read\n\nIt's a “Runaway” hit.\n\nTeam Bon Jovi are re-releasing their 1984 debut album, “Bon Jovi,” as “Bon Jovi Deluxe Edition.” The re-release is streaming now with nine never heard before bonus tracks, six versions of “Runaway” and four live tracks from a formerly released 1985 Tokyo concert.\n\nThere's also a new limited-edition anniversary “Bon Jovi” LP and cassette.\n\n“We can’t believe it’s been 40 years since we released Bon Jovi — the record that changed our lives forever,” said the band on social media.\n\nOne of the “Runaway” versions on “Bon Jovi Deluxe Edition” is a stripped-down and raw Jon Bon Jovi solo on electric guitar.\n\nJon Bon Jovi was knocking around Jersey Shore nightclubs when he wrote “Runaway” with George Karak in 1983. The song was recorded at the Power Station, owned by Tony Bongiovi, Jon’s cousin. Bongiovi assembled an all-star band that included Roy Bittan of the E Street Band, and Hugh McDonald — who would later join Bon Jovi on bass.\n\n“Runaway” found its way onto the former WAPP 103.5-FM “The Apple,” part of an unsigned band contest. Jon Bon Jovi had a hit record, but he didn’t have a band so he formed Bon Jovi.\n\nThe early years were a struggle until they broke through to the big time with 1986's “Slippery When Wet.”\n\nUpcoming for the band is “Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story,” the first-ever docu-series on the band’s history with “full cooperation from all past and present members.” The series debuts April 26 on Hulu.\n\nJon Bon Jovi will be honored as the 2024 MusiCares Person of the Year with a benefit and tribute concert Feb. 2 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, two nights before the 66th annual Grammy Awards at the Crypto.com Arena.\n\nMore: Bon Jovi's early years in Sayreville, Asbury Park: A look back\n\nMore: 'It's My Life': Docu-series on the band Bon Jovi is coming to Hulu\n\nSubscribe to app.com for the latest on the New Jersey music scene.\n\nChris Jordan, a Jersey Shore native, covers entertainment and features for the USA Today Network New Jersey.
