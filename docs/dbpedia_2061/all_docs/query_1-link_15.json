        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nOn this day in 1994, California trio Green Day released their third studio album and major-label debut, Dookie. “Longview,” the lead single, came out that day as well, and debuted on MTV on Feb. 22. The rest is pop-punk history for Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tre Cool. The next singles “Basket Case,” a remake of Kerplunk standout “Welcome to Paradise,” and “When I Come Around” all becoming alt-rock radio staples. The album’s detailed Where’s Waldo-meets-Mad Magazine cartoon cover art, created by artist Richie Bucher, was also a coveted poster and T-shirt design. It is diamond-certified by the RIAA for shipments of more than 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, and has sold an estimated 20 million worldwide. Dookie won Best Alternative Album at the Grammys in 1995. In the fall of 2023, the band released an expanded 30th anniversary edition of Dookie featuring live recordings, demos, and outtakes.\n\nRead More: Welcome to paradise: Finding identity and inspiration in Green Day’s Dookie\n\nAlso, in:\n\n1963 - 17-year-old Neil Young performed his first professional gig at a country club in Winnipeg.\n\n1964 - The Beatles started a seven-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\".\n\n1964 - Indiana Governor Matthew Walsh bans the Kingsmen's version of \"Louie Louie,\" calling it \"pornographic\" and making a federal case out of it.\n\n1965 - At the Arthur Smith Studios in Charlotte, North Carolina, James Brown recorded \"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\".\n\n1967 - At Abbey Road studios in London, The Beatles started work on Sgt.
