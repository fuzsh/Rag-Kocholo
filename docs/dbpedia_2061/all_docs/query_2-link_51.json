This isn’t a clean edit of “Even Better Than the Real Thing”, but rather a mix of the song which starts 26.5 seconds before the end of the previous track, and continues for the full length of the fourth track on the album. The U2 portion of the mix ends at the end of the fourth track and does not continue into the fifth track.\n\nThe mix here is The Perfecto Mix of “Even Better Than the Real Thing” but it has been altered slightly and runs a bit faster than other releases of the mix. The mix starts at the end of the track before it and the vocal actually starts with the third track and finishes on the fourth, with the word “Higher” being strung across both tracks. This mix uses the full Perfecto Mix and not the Radio Edit for this mix.\n\nThe mix is a two disc set, remixed by Simon Walsh and Charlie Brook. Brook used to mix for Pete Tong as well, and this compilation was done in conjunction with the BBC. This release was issued in the UK, on cassette and CD.\n\nLiner Notes\n\nConcept and compilation by Mark Goodier and Ashley Abram. All tracks mixed by Simon Walsh and Charlie Brook at Wise Buddah.\n\nRelated Promotional Videos\n\nRelated News"
