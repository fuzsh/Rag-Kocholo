Records.\n\nThe album was recorded mostly in sessions between August and September 1970. Its sound is in a similar vein as the band's more widely known later recordings, such as 1973's Dixie Chicken and 1978's Waiting for Columbus. The record features Little Feat's initial line-up, with Roy Estrada on bass. It was the first of eight albums by the band before its first break up in 1979. The cover shows the mural Venice in the Snow, painted by the L. A. Fine Arts Squad in 1970, in Venice, Los Angeles. In 2007, the album was released as a gold CD through the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab.[citation needed]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nSource:[5]\n\nLittle Feat\n\nLowell George – lead, rhythm and slide guitars, lead vocals (all songs except where noted) and backing vocals, harmonica\n\nBill Payne – keyboards, lead (\"Snakes on Everything\" and \"Takin' My Time\") and backing vocals, piano\n\nRoy Estrada – bass, backing vocals\n\nRichard Hayward – drums, backing vocals, additional lead vocal on \"Crazy Captain Gunboat Willie\"\n\nAdditional\n\nRuss Titelman – percussion, backing vocals, piano on \"I've Been The One\"\n\nRy Cooder – bottleneck guitar on \"Willin'\" and \"Forty Four Blues / How Many More Years\"\n\nSneaky Pete Kleinow – pedal steel guitar on \"I've Been The One\"\n\nKirby Johnson – string and horn arrangements\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
