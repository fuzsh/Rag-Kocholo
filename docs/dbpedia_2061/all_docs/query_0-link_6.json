Drake, Diddy, Pharrell, Kelly Rowland and a recharged Nas ride with Rawse, and with swirling, dense beats spurring the headliner's unmatched confidence, Rich Forever blows like a hurricane. It's not his first victory lap, and it won't be his last. \"Get it straight off the boat, yeah, my life is a movie/Got a three-story mansion, big saltwater Jacuzzi,\" he announces. He's still inventing brash new ways to say, \"Fuck you.\"\n\nDisco never died. It was just hiding out in Brooklyn, where this 17-piece club orchestra crafted its debut set of glitter-caked grooves. In a year when we lost such giants of the genre as Donna Summer and Robin Gibb, there is something reassuring about how faithfully tunes like \"Cocaine Blues\" and \"Starlight\" channel the sleek, sexy sound of Studio 54 at its peak, down to the last high-hat and brass flourish. \"A knife, a fork, a bottle and a cork/That's the way we spell New York,\" vocalist Adeline Michèle sings. Up-all-night civic pride rarely sounds so fun.\n\nThe son of country-rock renegade Steve Earle has grown into a songwriter to rival his dad. His fourth LP is his strongest yet, a set of love-scarred folk-blues travelogues delivered with exactingly shaky phrasing and an undertow of Stax-Volt horns. “Down on the Lower East Side” gets New York-jazzy, and “Won’t Be the Last Time” is honky-tonk weepy. Earle’s bloodline follows him everywhere, and guides him, too; as he declares in the record’s first line: “I hear my father on the radio singing, ‘Take me home again.'”\n\nAs young stars like Adele and Katy Perry cover her songs, Raitt continues what she’s been doing, more or less, for 40-plus years: Pick a bunch of smart, tender tunes by great writers (Slipstream includes a pair by Bob Dylan), add one or two of her own, and sing them in a soulful ache, dotted by her casual slideguitar punctuations. Adele praised Raitt’s “stunning voice,” and if you want to hear proof, pay attention to the ballads “You Can’t Fail Me Now” and “Not ’Cause I Wanted To,” where heartache falls as softly as snow.\n\nEvery time Nas puts out a new record, someone says it’s his “best since Illmatic.” This one actually might deserve that title. Cut in the wake of his divorce from Kelis, his 10th album is honest in a way that’s rare for hip-hop – from “Bye Baby,” where Nas struggles to make sense of the failed relationship, to “Daughters,” where he confronts his parenting lapses. Always a master storyteller, he leavens these personal moments with plenty of richly detailed street drama, delivered over soul-flavored hard-knock beats that are like comfort food for East Coast rap heads.\n\n“I don’t want a world of broken things,” Mayer sings on his fifth album. Steeped in California country rock and Seventies sensitivity, Born and Raised has its share of soft, soothing attempts to make us all whole again (“Love Is a Verb”). But the dude with the Benetton soul and the David Duke dick made more news by addressing his own spotty past and busted-up sense of self: “It sucks to be honest and it hurts to be real,” he sings over tender, Claptonian guitar on “Shadow Days.” It’s a shot at redemption that’s as on target as anything he’s done.\n\nBest Coast’s Bethany Cosentino is still besotted with the glorious sulk of Sixties girl-group pop and the awesomeness of California living (“Why would you live anywhere else?” she wonders on the surf-rock title track). But with L.A. producer/pop historian Jon Brion on board, the tales of boredom, touchy friendships and shaky relationships on her second record open up and brighten up – half of them even break the three-minute mark. And with less reverb-y guitar haze to hide behind, her voice comes into its own as one of indie rock’s mightiest.\n\nAt 78 years old, the dapper Canadian sage came back to whisper his heavier-than-ever poetry about sex and spirituality, complete with bedroom scenes like “I’m naked and I’m filthy/And there’s sweat upon my brow.” As a man who never really sounded young he was well into his thirties when he dropped his classic debut album in 1967 – Cohen adapts to this uncharted age with a lifetime’s worth of grace and wit. Best lines: “I dreamed about you, baby, you were wearin’ half your dress/I know you have to hate me, but could you hate me less?”\n\nGreen Day took a vacation from sweeping rock operas and spent 2012 banging out hot, hook-mad punk rock like it was 1994 all over again. The first installment in their ¡Uno!–¡Dos!-¡Tré! album trilogy flails and bashes and rants like a spiky dervish – from the Clash-disco of “Kill the DJ” to the mod-Who blood rush of “Carpe Diem.” Billie Joe Armstrong blitzes past his 40th birthday without losing the bullshit-calling rage that keeps a man young, cranky and always on the lookout for girls who think “Won’t you be my bloody valentine?” is a cool pickup line.\n\nDoes sandal-wearing late-Sixties revivalism seem a little hokey in 2012? Well, that’s exactly what makes the 10-member troupe of L.A. neo-hippies’ second LP such an achievement. They’re not just convincing, they’re musically on fire, spooling out tuneful hymns like they’re passing out free joints in the parking lot at a Dead show. Frontman Alex Ebert sings earnestly about love and spirituality, letting his mind wander pleasantly over the band’s homespun harmonies and easy-going folk-psych instrumentation. There’s gospel country, spaced-out chorales and back-to-the-land jamming; it’s a cosmic campfire singalong, broadcasting live from a magical place where the Age of Aquarius never ended and every Jesus beard in the house is completely unironic.\n\nBruce Springsteen‘s 17th album is rock’s most pointed response to the Great Recession: a song suite explicitly for the 99 percent, as largehearted, and as righteously wrathful, as any album he’s made. Wrecking Ball rages at corporate oligarchy and economic injustice. “Gambling man rolls the dice, working man pays the bill/It’s still fat and easy up on banker’s hill,” he bellows in “Shackled and Drawn.”\n\nIt’s Springsteen’s most walloping and adventurous release in decades. He and producer Ron Aniello merge the sweep, heft and rumble of the classic E Street sound with modern flourishes: mariachi horns, electronica grace notes and, in the gospel-flavored “Rocky Ground,” a rapped verse nearly as stirring as Springsteen’s chorus courtesy of Michelle Moore, a previously unknown backing vocalist. In places, the master salutes his protégés: “Death to My Hometown” winks at the Dropkick Murphys, with pennywhistles piping over a burly Celtic reel; the title track, an ode to the late Giants Stadium and an F.U. to Father Time, wails like Arcade Fire.\n\nBut Springsteen’s vision is his alone, and its scope – musically, politically, morally – is vast. In “We Are Alive,” Springsteen’s “we” includes striking 19th-century railroad workers, 1960s civil rights martyrs and Mexican migrants. Then there’s the capacious, whiplashing “We Take Care of Our Own,” an infuriated protest about the failure of America’s social compact, and the campaign theme for the newly re-elected president. “There ain’t no help, the cavalry stayed home,” Springsteen laments. But ultimately, Wrecking Ball holds out hope: that, someday, “the promise, from sea to shining sea” will be kept."
