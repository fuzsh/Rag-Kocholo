        "text": "Travis Scott's record label, Cactus Jack released their debut compilation album the night after Christmas titled JACKBOYS.\n\nThe short seven-song project contains verses and hooks from every artist of Cactus Jack Records including Travis and his artists Don Toliver and Sheck Wes, and DJ & producer Chase B. The album starts with a remix of the Scott single, \"HIGHEST IN THE ROOM\", but this time featuring help from Hispanic supernova, Rosalia, and a verse from Atlanta rapper, Lil Baby.\n\nFans received a more refined project with it clocking in at 21 minutes in total despite a 21-song track list surfaced on the internet over the past week. Surprisingly, artists like Pop Smoke, Quavo, Offset, Young Thug, and Luxury Tax made appearances on the album.\n\nExpectedly, Mike Dean, longtime friend and collaborator of Travis Scott, mixed and mastered the project. The cover artwork was shot by film director, Harmony Korine. Korine is the director of the films The Beach Bum and Spring Breakers.\n\nAlong with the album, Travis Scott released a collection of merch available for a limited time."
