        "text": "Music lovers were disappointed when Drake failed to deliver For All The Dogs to us at midnight on Friday (August 25). Even with that letdown, the industry still turned out plenty of exciting new releases, including a debut LP from rising R&B sensation Fridayy. The singer shared 14 songs with us on his self-titled effort, including the previously released \"Don't Give It Away\" with Chris Brown and \"When It Comes To You.\"\n\nBesides the Breezy collaboration, Fridayy also linked up with a selection of other artists throughout his tracklist. He opens with \"Came Too Far\" featuring Maverick City Music and My Mom. That joint effort is immediately followed by Adekunle Gold's appearance on \"Done For Me.\" The Philadelphia-born creative held his own on several other titles before teaming up with Fireboy DML on \"You,\" and Byron Messia on \"Mercy.\"\n\nFridayy's Debut Album Accompanied By \"Stand By Me\" Visual\n\nAlong with the album's arrival on DSPs, the \"GOD DID\" collaborator also shared a new visual for \"Stand By Me,\" the project's third song. It finds him singing alongside striking employees and perfectly captures the energy fluctuating around the entertainment industry at this time. \"If I say I'm standing for you / You know that I'm 'a standing ten toes,\" the 26-year-old sings of his own loyalty.\n\nCheck out Fridayy's latest visual for \"When It Comes To You\" from his self-titled project above. If you're a fan of R&B, check out the singer's full debut LP on Spotify/Apple Music.
