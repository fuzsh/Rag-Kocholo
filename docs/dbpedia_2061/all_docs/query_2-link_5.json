In fact I think the first CD/LP \"Little Feat\" in this set actually sounds better than the original vinyl - probably because it has been (unlike the other 4CDs) remixed by Bob Kovach.\n\nI too have Little Feat's more expensive 4CD (remastered) compilation 'Hotcakes & Outtakes' box and enjoy hearing and comparing the selection of tracks on it that are also on this 'Original Album Series', but listening to both box sets (with their different masterings) I'd say the bottom line is you can't have too many versions of the Warner Brothers recordings made by Lowell George's Little Feat and that this 'Original Album Series' Box cannot be beaten on value for money (or musical content).\n\nThree titles (I think) have been released as MOFI CDs- Their first ST album, Sailin Shoes and Waiting For Columbus.\n\nWaiting For Columbus is available in 3 CD versions- the original release, then a remaster from around 2002 that to my ears sounds quite good and includes several tracks not found on the 2LP version and earlier CD, and also the MOFI which does not include the extra tracks.\n\nAs has been stated already several times, the Lowell George era LF is essential music and all CD releases sound at least pretty good."
