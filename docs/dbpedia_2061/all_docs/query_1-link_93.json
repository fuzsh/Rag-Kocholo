        "text": "by Vincent Lane\n\nEem Triplin delivers tales of love and loss through his trademark rasp and melodies that cut straight to the soul. Sipping Henny and spitting game, the 23-year-old artist and producer masters the art of the gentle flex with “FIJI,” his new single. Produced by Eem, along with GRAMMY-winning producer Dahi (Kendrick Lamar, SZA) and AJ Thomas (Cruza’s producer), “FIJI” ambles along with liquid keys and tinkering percussion, providing a bed for Eem’s mischievous vocals and devil-may-care, double time rhymes: “Ever since she got her heart broke/Gigi never wanna see me/Outside takin’ shots/Drinkin’ Hennessy like it’s the Fiji/If you down, take around/Baby, you could call me when you need me,” he lilts. The song arose out of an in-studio collaboration between Eem, Dahi, and rising R&B group Cruza, whose singer Adam Kain contributes a softly sung verse that illustrates the yearning that belies Eem’s hedonistic lifestyle.\n\n“FIJI” arrives as Eem Triplin is featured on New Music Dailyon Apple Music, as the playlist’s current cover star, alongside a brand new interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “FIJI” is the first glimpse of Eem Triplin’s upcoming debut album, releasing this fall. Earlier this year, the Johnstown, PA-born artist earned acclaim for his single “stephanie,” along with its music video, carrying over momentum from his breakout year in 2023.\n\n2023 was a year of leveling up for Eem Triplin, as he performed several sold out dates, shut it down at festivals like Rolling Loud Miami and Clout Festival and Splash! Festival overseas, and released STILL PRETTY, his debut EP. Spanning 7 tracks, and featuring production contributions from DJ Dahi, the STILL PRETTY EP features fan favorite singles like “WALKED IN,” “TELL ME I’M RIGHT,” and “What Da Opp Said.” After touring as direct support for LUCKI and $NOT earlier in the year, Eem played his first-ever headlining show in his hometown of Johnstown, Pennsylvania in July, as 1,500 fans greeted him with an ecstatic reception–many fans lined up hours early to get a great spot, and others enthusiastically crowd-surfed as Eem did his thing on stage. Eem then set out on his debut, headline tour STILL PRETTY North American Tour – selling 11,000 tickets across 21 shows (90% sell out). Eem closed out the year by releasing two new songs, “YEAH YEAH” and “Allocate.”"
