        "text": "Mutts Across America Program Makes Surprise Donation in Every State\n\nMiranda Lambert’s MuttNation Foundation has joined forces for the fourth consecutive year with Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ: TSCO), the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the United States, to donate more than $250,000 to animal shelters across the nation. Through MuttNation’s Mutts Across America program, one outstanding shelter or foster-based rescue in every state – plus Washington, D.C. and a “Wildcard” pick – is being honored with a surprise $5,000 grant.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240807716422/en/\n\nMiranda Lambert’s MuttNation Foundation & Tractor Supply Company Award More Than $250,000 in Grants to 52 Animal Shelters (Photo: Business Wire)\n\n“Mutts Across America is such a great program because it gives us the chance to highlight an amazing shelter in every state and thank them for the hard work they do throughout the year,” shared Lambert. “We especially love honoring the shelters that work with the dogs that are hardest to get adopted. We’re so proud to have such a strong and supportive partner in Tractor Supply sharing our values and goals to help as many shelter pets as possible live their best lives.”\n\nSince the initiative was developed 10 years ago by Lambert’s mother and MuttNation co-founder, Bev Lambert, Mutts Across America has supported more than 500 shelters with over $2 million in grants. Tractor Supply began partnering with MuttNation in 2021.\n\n“Caring for pets and animals is a calling we hold close to our hearts at Tractor Supply,” said Kimberley Gardiner, chief marketing officer at Tractor Supply. “Pets are an incredible source of joy for us Out Here, which is why we’re honored to support these shelters that are saving lives and providing care to animals in need alongside Miranda. Her dedication to this cause shines through all of MuttNation’s programs, and it’s a privilege to recognize shelters across the country that share this mission as well.”\n\nEach year, MuttNation conducts extensive research to carefully choose the organizations that will be honored and, again this year, is recognizing some of the outstanding shelters that help seniors, special needs dogs, large dogs and pit mixes; the “Love Harder” dogs that are easy to love but hardest to get adopted. There is no application process for Mutts Across America, and the recipients are given no advance notice before receiving the award.\n\nIn addition to the Mutts Across America partnership, MuttNation and Tractor Supply started the Relief For Rescues Fund in 2023 to help shelters and shelter pets recover from natural disasters. To date, the fund has generated nearly $1 million and provides year-round support from disasters such as floods, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes – as well as in other emergency situations.\n\nTractor Supply is the exclusive retailer of MuttNation pet products, with a percentage of all sales going to the MuttNation Foundation to promote and facilitate its mission.\n\nLambert will celebrate MuttNation’s 15th Anniversary with the Music For Mutts benefit concert on October 5 at Ascend Amphitheater in Nashville; Tractor Supply is a concert sponsor. The full lineup for the event featuring Miranda Lambert & Friends will be announced in the coming months. Tickets are on sale now at MuttNation.com.\n\nThe 2024 Mutts Across America grant recipients are:\n\nMuttNation Across America Presented by MuttNation and Tractor Supply Company SHELTER NAME STATE SHELTER NAME STATE Crossing Paths Animal Rescue Alabama Beaverhead Animal Shelter Montana Heart Fur Animals Alaska The Good Life Rescue Nebraska Lost Our Home Arizona Nevada Humane Las Vegas Nevada Good Shepard Humane Society Arkansas Motley Mutts Rescue New Hampshire Lange Foundation California Eleventh Hour Rescue New Jersey Animal Rescues of the Rockies Colorado Lap Dog Rescue of NM New Mexico All Paws on Deck Connecticut Rescue City New York Laila's Legacy Animal Rescue DC Crisis Dog NC North Carolina Brandywine Animal Rescue Delaware Journey Home Animal Rescue North Dakota Good Karma Pet Rescue So.
