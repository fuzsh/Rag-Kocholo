        "text": "Apple Music is a streaming service that allows you to listen to over 100 million songs. Its features include the ability to download your favorite tracks and play them offline, lyrics in real time, listening across all your favorite devices, new music personalized just for you, curated playlists from our editors, and much more. All this in addition to exclusive and original content.\n\nYour iTunes library is still yours. You can access your entire collection from Apple Music or from iTunes for macOS or Windows.\n\nApple Music is already on your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV 4K, Mac, and HomePod speakers — and you can listen with CarPlay or online at music.apple.com. Apple Music is also available on Windows and Android devices, Sonos speakers, Amazon Echo, Google Nest, smart TVs, and more.\n\nThat all depends on which offer you choose. (1) Students can choose the Apple Music Student Plan at $5.99 per month. (2) An individual monthly subscription is just $10.99 per month after your free trial. (3) The Apple Music Family Plan, which allows you to share your account with up to five people and gives each member a personal account, is just $16.99 per month. (4) The Apple Music Individual Plan and the Apple Music Family Plan are also included in Apple One, which bundles up to five other Apple services into a single monthly subscription. Apple One plans start at $19.95 per month.\n\nApple Music Classical is included with Apple Music Student, Individual, and Family Plans.\n\nStudents get the same Apple Music features and benefits as individual members. Once your student status with your college or university is verified, you get student membership pricing for up to four years, as long as you remain a student. After four years, your membership will continue at the individual member price.\n\nDolby Atmos is an audio technology that creates an immersive listening experience in which sound comes from all around you.\n\nApple Music subscribers using the latest version of Apple Music on iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV 4K can listen to thousands of Dolby Atmos music tracks using any headphones. When you listen with compatible Apple or Beats headphones or most Bluetooth headphones, Dolby Atmos music plays back automatically when available for a song. For other headphones, go to Settings > Music > Audio and set Dolby Atmos to Always On. You can also hear Dolby Atmos music using the built‑in speakers on a compatible iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or iMac, or by connecting your Apple TV 4K to one of the following: HomePod speakers set up as the default speakers, a Dolby Atmos–compatible sound bar, a Dolby Atmos–enabled AV receiver, or a television that supports Dolby Atmos audio. For the full list of compatible devices, please see support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182.\n\nLossless audio compression reduces the original file size of a song while preserving all of the data perfectly. Apple Music is making its entire catalog of more than 100 million songs available in lossless audio at different resolutions. In Apple Music, “Lossless” refers to lossless audio up to 48kHz, and “Hi-Res Lossless” refers to lossless audio from 48kHz to 192kHz. Lossless and Hi-Res Lossless files are very large and use much more bandwidth and storage space than standard AAC files.\n\nYou can listen to lossless audio using the latest Apple Music app on an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV 4K. Turn on lossless audio in Settings > Music > Audio Quality. You can choose between Lossless and Hi-Res Lossless for cellular or Wi-Fi connections. Note that Hi-Res Lossless requires external equipment such as a USB digital to analog converter.\n\nFor a full list of compatible devices, please see support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183.\n\nYes. With an Apple Music Family Plan, up to six people in the family can enjoy all the features and the full catalog of Apple Music. To get started, just set up Family Sharing on your iOS or iPadOS device, Android phone, or Mac and invite family members to join.\n\nNew subscribers can get three months of Apple Music free with an eligible device. To redeem the offer for iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV, set up your new device. To redeem the offer for AirPods, HomePod, or Beats headphones or speakers, connect or pair your eligible device to an iPhone or iPad running the latest version of iOS or iPadOS. To redeem the offer for Apple Watch, connect or pair your eligible device to an iPhone running the latest version of iOS. You’ll have three months to redeem the offer after the first activation of the eligible device.\n\nApple Music Classical is a companion app for Apple Music subscribers. Included with Apple Music plans for Individual, Family, and Student subscribers as well as Apple One, at no additional cost, Apple Music Classical is a dedicated classical music service designed by and for all types of classical music listeners. Classical music experts will delight in the largest collection of its kind, excellent search capability, and the high-quality audio that classical music deserves. If you’re new to the genre, you can discover classical music through curated playlists, intuitive browsing, and detailed descriptions of works.\n\nClassical music is different from contemporary genres. Works have multiple movements and tracks; famous pieces have hundreds of recordings with different orchestras, conductors, and soloists. Apple Music Classical is tailored to the needs of classical music lovers — with a unique approach to search, browse, library, and recommendation features. Listeners can also dive deeper with background information about artists, composers, and works.\n\nYou can download the Apple Music Classical app from the App Store or Google Play. It’s available for iPhone and iPad with iOS or iPadOS 15.4 or later, and for Android smartphones with Android 6 (Marshmallow) or later.\n\nYou’ll also need Apple Music installed on the same device — it’s usually preinstalled on iPhone and iPad.\n\nApple Music Classical is included with all Apple Music plans at no extra charge — there’s no separate subscription. If you’re not yet an Apple Music subscriber, it’s easy to sign up from Apple Music or Apple Music Classical.\n\nApple Music Classical has a shared library with Apple Music, which means that the classical tracks, albums, and playlists added in either app are instantly available in the other. You can listen on all your devices and in the car with CarPlay — online or offline.\n\nNo, Apple Music Classical is classical only, but it does include lots of film and other crossover genres with classical music. Apple Music Classical users can also listen to more than 100 million songs on Apple Music through their subscription."
