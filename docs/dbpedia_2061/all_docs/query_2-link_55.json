        "text": "Morrissey took his brave stance against the plundering of pop catalogs in 1987, when the rise of the compact disc sent the phenomenon into overdrive, allowing labels both big and small to rely on revenue generated by old recordings. This wasn't something new, though. Reissues and greatest hits compilations existed long before then, and the modern recording industry had always relied on hits that continue to shift units long after they fell off the charts. For decades, it seemed like this practice was so ingrained that there would never be a music business without it.\n\nThat turned out not to be the case. In 2016, repurposing old tunes for new product is no longer a vital part of the industry and, with its absence, our view of the past is slowly shifting. Yes, copious repackaging could be a mercenary practice, but music fans also benefitted tremendously by record labels’ need to recycle the past. In fact, we often don't grasp how deeply the practice has affected our collective view of music history.\n\nTo be sure, there are plenty of prominent reissues still grabbing music press headlines. Limited-edition vinyl re-pressings of classic titles are on constant churn, vying for attention alongside hefty double-disc expansions of Led Zeppelin's catalog, a bumper crop of 20th anniversary editions of alt-rock hits, as well as exquisitely packaged labors of love by boutique imprints. But underneath this flash, there's been a decline in the scope of reissues over the last 15 years, not to mention a steady erosion in the sheer number of titles hitting the stores. Greatest hits collections, once a staple of the holiday season, have essentially disappeared. Another subset of the record industry that has all but vanished is the cross-licensed multi-artist compilation, the kind of genre-defining collection Rhino Records made its specialty in the 1980s and '90s. Whereas albums were often given thorough single-disc expansions featuring unreleased tracks, single mixes, and the like, it's now either feast or famine, with noteworthy classics blown up into $100 boxes, or entire catalogs getting shoved into a chintzy cardboard box.\n\nIn the digital era, once a catalog enters a streaming service or an MP3 store, there's no need for a reissue and, therefore, there's no reason for a label to mine the vaults, searching for old music to make new again. Users can assemble their own personalized greatest hits playlists or just scan through an act's most accessed songs. All of this endless manipulation of the past seems to serve the same need as purchasing tidy pre-assembled collections of hits and rarities, but in practice, the end results are quite different.\n\nA released album—whether it arrives via vinyl, cassette, CD, or MP3—is something that can be passed along or excerpted, but it will always exist as a common point of reference. Playlists, as wonderful as they often are, are not a substitute for an official compilation. They exist in their own walled gardens and, even if they're shared, they're subject to the whims of users and licenses; there's no guarantee that the playlist heard in January will be the same one heard in July. When we lose this commonality, we start to lose the vernacular that makes pop music, in all its forms, a shared experience.\n\nBut despite the popularity of album-based rock, the practice of repackaging old tunes as new never quite faded away. It lasted because it served a practical purpose: giving people a bunch of songs they already loved in one convenient package. And after the late '60s, recycling older material usually arrived in the form of greatest hits albums.\n\nBecause labels returned to this well so often—indeed, many greatest hits records were products of contractual obligation—it makes sense to disparage such hit parades. Look in any used record bin and you'll find supporting evidence for this argument in the form of sequels to original compilations (Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, More Greatest Hits!) or the relentless march of branded collections like Universal's 20th Century Masters or Sony's Essentials, product lines unveiled at the turn of the 21st century, when it seemed like CDs would never die.\n\nAs crass as these titles are, they also served a consumer need that wound up benefiting the artist. Look at the RIAA's list of biggest-selling albums: Perched at the top is the Eagles' Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975, a 1976 collection that rivals Michael Jackson's Thriller as the most popular LP in American history. Thriller was a phenomenon, moving most of its units in the years surrounding its release, but the Eagles comp is the very definition of a catalog success, selling millions of copies year after year. It also redefined the perception of the L.A. group, whose first four albums were spotty and not necessarily blockbusters; \"Desperado,\" a song that later permeated pop culture to such a degree that it served as a punchline on “Seinfeld,” didn't chart at all upon its initial release, but it was an anchor on Their Greatest Hits.\n\nThat Eagles collection wasn't an isolated incident, either. Without Legend—a 1984 compilation masterminded by Stiff Records founder Dave Robinson when he was the head of Island—Bob Marley may not have turned into such an enduring crossover pop icon. And even such album-oriented artists as Elton John, Billy Joel, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers count compilations as their biggest sellers. These greatest hits albums sand away the artists’ quirks—Elton's moody meditations are excised, Billy doesn't seem as pugnaciously ambitious, Petty's orneriness and abiding love of '60s garage rock are diminished—but by focusing on the hits, they crystallize the essence of each star. Over time, those greatest hits albums—purchased as a package, repeated incessantly on the radio—formalized each act's conventionally-accepted canon and, in turn, cemented their enduring public personas.\n\nSimilarly, our understanding of certain styles of music is beholden to reissues, where collectors and archivists assembled our messy past into compelling, sensible stories. Often, the credit for the first major various artists reissue is given to Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, the 1952 project that collected regional 78s recorded between 1927 and 1932. Anthology was a feat of research—Smith culled it from his prodigious library, assembling songs according to region and theme, a process that helped turn this vast stack of records into interwoven narratives. Smith's achievement had considerable cultural impact, not only preserving the past but also changing the course of the present. Without it, protest singers and collegiate harmony groups may not have been able to score the soundtrack of the '50s and early '60s. Anthology created the canon and its own context; it enshrined certain songs and, by doing so, suggested to Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, and many other musicians what folk music should be.\n\nOther collections of old 78s had considerable impact during the early years of long-players because they made discovery of the past easy. The 1961 Robert Johnson collection King of the Delta Blues Singers influenced a generation of baby boomers, as evidenced by its placement on the cover on Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home. Recordings squirreled away on shellac were accessible again; they could be found in record stores, purchased, and passed along.\n\nSuch archival reissues demonstrated there was a dedicated market for older music, but perhaps a better indication for how the industry could profit from quick repackages of the past was Art Laboe's Oldies but Goodies series, which debuted in 1959 with a record of doo-wop hits. It proved so popular that it generated a tribute hit via Little Caesar & the Romans' 1961 smash \"Those Oldies but Goodies (Remind Me of You),\" and by the time the series reached its 15th volume in 1985, various artists albums became a staple of the record industry.\n\nThese collections were safe, easy bets for record labels big and small. Easy usually means cheap, and there's little question that throughout the '70s and into the '80s, such collections were often trashy exercises in nostalgia, released by cut-rate labels who peddled their wares on television, where the idea was to get suckers to pay more placing an order on the telephone than they would shell out in a store.\n\nK-Tel, the most famous of these labels, became the byword for this whole underbelly of the music industry, its very name conjuring shoddy, careless products assembled with no thought in mind other than a quick buck. The label was indiscriminate, packaging oldies for every demographic in every country: For some reason, Canadians were the only ones who got the nonsensical Pinball Rock, but K-Tel bundled plenty of hits under the 20 Original Hits, 20 Original Stars umbrella, scoured up some old novelties for Goofy Greats, targeted dancers with Disco Double and Disco Rocket, and served soft rock fans Emotions.\n\nK-Tel's sleaze wound up countered by the impish geeks at Rhino, who eventually set the standard for archival pop music reissues. Starting as a record shop in the shadow of UCLA, Rhino became a label in 1978 and, after a series of marginally popular novelty singles, they turned their attention toward resuscitating their favorite out-of-print records. The imprint had good taste and, better still, good timing, arriving just before the compact disc transformed the economics of the business.\n\nWhen the popularity of the CD skyrocketed in the back half of the '80s, Rhino was poised to take advantage of a new market thirsty to repurchase old favorites in better fidelity. It wasn't the only boutique label specializing in older music: The German imprint Bear Family began exhaustively chronicling American roots music in 1975, and Mosaic started releasing vinyl box sets of classic early jazz recordings in 1983, both specializing in scholarly, complete overviews.\n\nMeanwhile, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab took a different route, cherry-picking the best of the best of classic albums and reissuing them in the best-possible audio—a strike against the increasingly shoddy vinyl pressings of the '70s. Labels were fine with licensing popular titles, including Steely Dan's Katy Lied and Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, because it was essentially an addendum to the market; they were appealing to people who already had the record and cared about quality. Even Capitol allowed the Beatles, the most reliable cash cow in the industry, to have their catalog released as a Mobile Fidelity box in 1982.\n\nInitially, major label CD reissues were rushed to market, struck from safety masters originally intended for vinyl, but by the late '80s the majors started to co-opt the innovations of Rhino, Bear Family, Mosaic, and Mobile Fidelity, turning out archival releases that were thoroughly researched, rich in rarities, and sterling in sound. Like so many other times in the music business, independents pioneered new territory and found where the cash reserves lay—and then the majors followed suit. In turn, audiences benefitted from this trawl through the vaults. B-sides and unreleased songs turned familiar, alternate mixes and full concerts were unearthed, lost albums became canon.\n\nIndividual artists certainly gained from this boundless expansion. Bob Dylan's 1985 five-LP Biograph pioneered the concept of the career-spanning, rarities-laden box set, a blueprint that was followed by major labels once the CD boom exploded in the late '80s. The watershed moment arrived in 1988, when Eric Clapton's sprawling career was summarized in the four-disc Crossroads, a set filled with unreleased—often unbootlegged—material. Crossroads won two Grammy awards and sold over three million copies, opening the floodgates for major label reissues. The next year, David Bowie licensed some of his catalog to Rykodisc, a Massachusetts-based indie who developed an innovative campaign for their reissue campaign: Each of the albums was freshly remastered and expanded with bonus tracks of rare alternate versions and unreleased cuts, a concept that had yet to be exploited.\n\nFor instance, it's possible to line up Quentin Tarantino's '90s filmography against the Rhino series and determine what he was listening to for each movie: Reservoir Dogs' K-Billy Super Sounds of the '70s—the fictional radio station pumping out a steady stream of '70s oldies throughout the film—lines up with Have a Nice Day; almost all of Pulp Fiction's surf songs can be found on Rhino's 1994 set Rock Instrumental Classics, Vol. 5: Surf; and Jackie Brown’s soundtrack is rooted in Soul Hits of the '70s—Didn't It Blow Your Mind, whose first volume arrived in stores in 1991.\n\nAll of the songs in those films could have been dug up by Tarantino, or any other voracious listener, on their own, but the manageable packages help jump-start exploration while also codifying the past. Usually, an era doesn't truly take place until we remember it, and while the collective memory always trumps individual curators, it certainly helps to have touchstones like hits compilations to goose things along. The audience for these compilations disappeared because it was served by individualized listening, but that means there are songs that fade from popular consciousness because they aren't gathered in a convenient set. Similarly, all the rarities buried in the vaults—the unreleased songs, the alternate mixes, the demos—are likely to remain there because, without this stream of revenue, there is simply no reason to dig deep.\n\nUndoubtedly, modern listeners gain much from the history that’s just sitting on streaming services, waiting to be accessed. Amateur curators and music journalists are taking the time to trawl through the past to assemble shareable playlists that serve the same needs as old reissues. In some respects, this is an improvement over the old way of doing things—after all, it's now possible to augment a collection of big '70s hits with cuts by Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, or Paul McCartney and Wings, all artists who were unavailable for previous comps due to licensing restrictions—but the digital past is notoriously mutable.\n\nTake “The Bomb in the Heart of the Century,” a terrific Spotify playlist of music from the year 1950 assembled by Michael Daddino a few years ago. Celebrated among music critics, this playlist is strikingly similar in breadth and ambition to a classic Rhino compilation. But within months of its debut, some of its featured songs were dropped from the service. Why bother with an archival project through a streaming service if it can all disappear without notice?\n\nThe myth of the Celestial Jukebox—that idyllic stereo in the sky that provides instant access to all recordings ever made—lies upon the assumption that because music is theoretically available for all to hear, the past is preserved and easy to access. Reality isn't quite so simple. Since the dawn of recording, our musical history has always been inherently tied to the existence of physical, sellable product: The initial release created the history, and the reissue facilitated the writing of history, whether it was through carefully constructed archival projects or the existence of re-pressings of popular titles. Pink Floyd saw its catalog jump from EMI to Columbia back to Capitol/EMI, each getting somewhat ballyhooed and publicized reissues each time, the ad campaigns and endcap placements keeping the titles prominent; now they are just there, waiting to be called up by the user, if they care. When Van Morrison chooses to revive his catalog at this point, stories are shared on social media, then the music fades back into the vast digital chasm.\n\nCommerce remains a dirty word within the canon of pop music—greedy record companies are continually painted as the villain by artist and fan alike, a middle-man standing in the way of the art. But there's no way around it: Recorded music is, by design, a product. Music, whether it's popular or underground, is recorded, packaged, marketed—and, if it's successful either commercially or artistically, it often is re-packaged and re-marketed, its value proven through its repeated entry into a competitive marketplace. Histories, criticism, collectors, and fans help create canon, but what we know about pop music is beholden to that marketplace. A hit isn't a hit if it doesn’t sell records the first time it's on the charts, and it's not part of the enduring popular consciousness unless it continues to sell, even in meager numbers. The way we understand our past is through the albums available in the bins and through reissues—the old records that have become new again."
