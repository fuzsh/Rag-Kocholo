        "text": "Horror-themed metalcore icons Ice Nine Kills will release their sequel album The Silver Scream 2: Welcome to Horrorwood, this October, just two weeks before Halloween. Available now is a video for the debut single, \"Hip to Be Scared,\" which features a guest appearance by Papa Roach frontman Jacoby Shaddix.\n\nThe song's title is a cheeky reference to the 1986 Huey Lewis and the News hit song \"Hip to Be Square\" and there's even a brief nod to the main melody from the pop-rock standout. \"Hip to Be Scared\" is another one of Ice Nine Kills' signature blend of cinema and metal (cinemetal?), where soaring vocal lines from frontman Spencer Charnas and Shaddix take listeners on a picturesque journey with spoken word dialogue to help connect things to the world of film.\n\n\"True to horror franchise tradition, there is always a sequel... The Silver Scream 2: Welcome To Horrorwood follows in the bloody footsteps of its predecessor, paying tribute to 13 more of the most gruesome tales to ever grace the silver screen,\" offered Charnas, who continued, \"In this latest INK offering, the last album and video series is portrayed as a work of fiction. The new story line thrusts the band into a brutal 'real world' slaying. The only traces of the crime are 13 songs left behind by the suspected killer...\"\n\n\"We can’t wait to share this next chapter with you, and to welcome you to the sinister state of mind that will soon be known the world over as, Horrorwood, added the frontman. \"The first stop on the tour is 1980s New York City’s 'greed is good' scene, where a certain hot shot investment banker has a rather violent dirty secret...,\" he trailed off.\n\nWatch the music video for \"Hip to Be Scared\" below the lyrics (via Genius) and view the artwork for The Silver Scream 2 further down the page.\n\nThe Silver Scream 2: Welcome to Horrorwood drops on Oct. 15 on Fearless Records. Pre-save the album here.\n\nNEW MUSIC PLAYLIST: Keep up with each week's new songs by following Loudwire's 'Weekly Wire' Spotify playlist, featuring 50 tracks with updates each Friday afternoon.\n\nIce Nine Kills, \"Hip to be Scared\" Lyrics\n\n[Verse 1: Spencer Charnas]\n\nIn the wealthiest sections\n\nA killer complexion is often a great alibi\n\nValentino couture mixed with violence and gore\n\n\"Well, I guess I'm a pretty sick guy\"\n\nWith my beauty routines and a fridge full of spleens\n\nSome might say it's extreme but it's time to say goodbye\n\n[Chorus: Spencer Charnas]\n\nSo to hell with good intentions\n\nSo to hell with where I'll go\n\nBut the devil makes exceptions\n\nFor all American psychos\n\n[Interlude: Spencer Charnas]\n\n\"Patrick, where are you going?'\n\n\"I'm just leaving\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"I have to rеturn some video tapes\"\n\n[Verse 2: Spencer Charnas]\n\nYou'll find no еscape once you're captured on tape\n\nI'm aware it's a bit avant-garde\n\n\"[?] fuckin [?] face to pieces\"\n\nKept only craving without ever grieving\n\nBut wait, let me give you my card\n\n\"That's bone\"\n\nThere is no real me, just a stark entity that cannot be redeemed\n\nSo it's time to say goodbye\n\n[Chorus: Spencer Charnas]\n\nSo to hell with good intentions\n\nSo to hell with where I'll go\n\nBut the devil makes exceptions\n\nFor all American psychos\n\nHold my calls\n\nI'll kill them all\n\nSo to hell with good intentions\n\nFor all American psychos\n\n[Skit: Spencer Charnas & Jacoby Shaddix]\n\n\"Do you like Ice Nine Kills?\"\n\n\"Not really\"\n\n\"Their early work was a little bit too scene for me but when The Silver Scream came out I think they really came into their own commercially and artistically. The whole album has a refined melodic sensibility that really makes it a cut above the rest\"\n\n\"Hey Paul\"\n\n[Verse 3: Spencer Charnas]\n\n\"You've reached the offices of?, please leave a message?\"\n\nEric, Hello\n\nAs my lawyer, you know I'm psychotic but I've crossed the line\n\nI've killed Rufus, then Mika, Jose with a knife\n\nBut I don't think I'm gonna get away with it, this time\n\n[Chorus 2: Spencer Charnas & Jacoby Shaddix]\n\nTo hell with good intentions\n\nTo hell is where I'll go\n\nBut the devil makes exceptions\n\nFor all American psychos\n\nHold my calls\n\nI'll kill them all\n\nSo to hell with good intentions\n\nFor all American\n\nAmerican Psychos\n\nIce Nine Kills, \"Hip to be Scared\" Feat.
