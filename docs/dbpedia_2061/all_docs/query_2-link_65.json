        "text": "Travis Scott has released a new compilation album, ‘Jackboys’. Listen to it below.\n\nThe seven-track record spotlights artists on Scott’s Cactus Jack Records label, including Sheck Wes (of ‘Mo Bamba’ fame), Don Toliver and DJ Chase B. Quavo, Offset, Young Thug and Pop Smoke also appear. The tracklist also includes a remix of Scott’s latest single, ‘Highest In The Room’, featuring Rosalía and Lil Baby. Stream it here:\n\nScott had announced the release of ‘Jackboys’ – and accompanying merchandise – in November. On Christmas day, he posted a video trailer and confirmed the album’s release this week. “WHOLE GANG IS DELIRIOUS. JACKBOYS PACK THIS WEEK? SHALL THE FANS EAT !!!!!! UNBUCKLE YOUR SEAT BELTS,” he declared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday (December 27), he confirmed the record’s imminent release. He also posted its cover art – a photo shot by Harmony Korine, director of Spring Breakers, Gummo and other films – and announced the album’s availability in digital, CD, cassette and vinyl formats on his official store.\n\nRecommended"
