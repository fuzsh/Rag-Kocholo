        "text": "Dylan Marlowe has confirmed he'll release his keenly anticipated debut album, Mid-Twenties Crisis, on September 27, with the fast-emerging artist today dropping his new single, âDevil On My Shoulderâ, to help celebrate the news of his forthcoming project.\n\nIn addition to already-released singles, âBoys Back Homeâ with Dylan Scott, âBat Outta Hell (with a Boat on the Back)â, âYou Did It Tooâ and âDevil On My Shoulderâ, Mid-Twenties Crisis will feature the previously teased break-up anthem, âHeaven's Sakeâ.\n\nExcitingly, Alabama hitmaker Riley Green will provide a set of guest vocals on âStick to My Gunsâ, which we imagine pivots around a double-entendre relating to staying true to yourself and enjoying some hunting - something both Dylan and Riley are known to love.\n\nAlso appearing on the tracklist are never-heard-before offerings such as the wittily named âHeart Brakesâ, âHang It Upâ, âShop Radioâ, âI Never Missâ, âThere Goes Thatâ and âThe Fenceâ.\n\nWe're glad to see that âHungover in a Deer Standâ has made its way onto Mid-Twenties Crisis, with Dylan Marlowe sharing a snippet of the electric-guitar-propelled earworm earlier in the year. HARDY's rock-tinged influence can be heard on the track, with ERNEST jokingly pledging to Venmo Dylan Marlowe $100 if HARDY wasn't a co-writer on the song - with Dylan later sharing that ERNEST stuck to his word.\n\nWhen announcing the new record, Dylan Marlowe offered fans a special message delving into what the album means to him, âMid-Twenties Crisis. This record has been three years in the making...I hope you can listen to this record and relate, roll your windows down, rock out and get in your feels all at the same timeâ.\n\nThe title-track, which is a play on the phrase âmid-life crisisâ, appears to be a particularly special one for the Georgia prodigy, with Dylan Marlowe taking to socials earlier in July to explain how the idea for the song - which he wrote alone - came about.\n\nDylan Marlowe shared, âThis is the realest song Iâve ever written. My record was finished, me and Joe Fox were working on final mixes and I couldnât come up with what I wanted to name the album. We were coming up on the final days of having to turn it in and I had nothing. This is my first record so I wanted the title to be specialâ.\n\nHe expanded, âSo I prayed for at least 2 months straight every day âGod what do you want me to name this recordâ and finally one morning a few days before we had to turn it in this idea slipped into my mind around 4am. I knew it was perfect for what I had been going through but then decided a title like that needed a song, and a song like that needed to be written by myself. So with one day to spare I sent Joe the work tape I made from the bus on the road, and sang the vocal as soon as I got home before me and [my wife] Natalie Marlowe went to Alaska last week. Iâm so proud of this song and I hope it relates with you guys as wellâ.\n\nâDevil On My Shoulderâ is an infectious, turbo-charged jam in the mould of previous hits such as âDirt Road When I Dieâ and âYou See Mineâ, and it's safe to say we're looking forward to hearing the rest of the record, with Dylan Marlowe hopefully planning on dropping another single or two before the September 27th release date."
