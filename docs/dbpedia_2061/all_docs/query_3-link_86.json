        "text": "Nobody has been able to deny or question Carlos Santana’s position as one of the best guitarists in the world.\n\nFor more than four decades, Carlos has been a groundbreaking visionary whose renowned signature sound has transcended music genres. With his riveting guitar playing and fusion of rock ‘n’ roll and Latin American jazz, he has forever evolved throughout the years, collaborating with artists such as Steven Tyler, Alicia Keys, Rob Thomas, Shakira and Chad Kroeger.\n\nCelebrating the premiere of our most recent Song Around The World featuring Carlos Santana, here are a few Santana songs you must definitely add to your playlist.\n\nTito Puente composed “Oye Como Va” in 1963 but it was popularized by the psychedelic rock of Santana in 1970.\n\nPart of what makes Santana’s guitar riffs on “Oye Como Va” so memorable are the nuances he throws in: a classic Carlos “hammer/pull” trill during the second and third melodies, and a series of slides up and down the high “E” string throughout.\n\nSource: Ultimate Santana\n\nWatch Cindy Blackman Santana, Becky G, Tito Puente, Jr., Tal Wilkenfeld, Rubén Rada, along with 20 other musicians from around the globe, join together for this energetic, classic, feel-good groove.\n\nOye Como Va ft. Carlos Santana & Cindy Blackman Santana | Playing For Change | Song Around The World\n\nMichael V. Rios is an internationally recognized visual artist whose art has been featured on such legendary albums as Santana's Supernatural, Steve Winwood's About Time and Poncho Sanchez’s Latin Spirits. Michael's visionary, multilayered approach to his art is deeply influenced by global cultures, music, rhythm and a celebration of life.\n\nMichael has generously allowed Playing For Change to utilize his original painting entitled Afro Cuban Beats II to coincide with the release of PFC's Song Around The World version of “Oye Como Va!” This exclusive and limited shirt release is a beautiful representation of the life, vibrancy, soul and interconnectivity of the drum!Read our featured entry in the Rolling Stone Magazine about “Oye Como Va.”\n\nAmigos is the amalgamation of Carlos Santana’s many musical styles throughout his career in the 70s. The genres vary between Latin rock, jazz, salsa and a little bit of flamenco.\n\nMany fans will recognize the rumor that “Europa” was written for a girl who was lost in a bad drug addiction. The song was also an incredibly popular trademark which started to lead Santana to a more jazz fusion style.\n\nCarlos Santana - Europa (Earth's Cry, Heaven's Smile) Live at Montreux 2011\n\nProduced by Brent Dangerfield and Santana, this first album was recorded at Pacific Recording Studios under the Columbia Records label, producing the two solid and most popular singles, “Jingo” and “Evil Ways.”\n\nThis song was originally recorded by Willie Bobo in 1965; it was written by Bobo's guitarist, Sonny Henry. Bobo was a Latin jazz percussionist who was a big influence on Santana and played on some of their tracks in the late '70s. \"He was one of the first guys who tried to merge Latin music and blues together on record,\" Carlos Santana said in ”The Guitar Greats” by John Tobler and Stuart Grundy. \"He did it before us, because we were doing it on the street, and he was already doing it on records.\"\n\nSource: Song Facts\n\nSantana - Evil Ways, 1969 \"Woodstock\" Festival\n\nDid you know? While Carlos Santana was the frontman of Santana Blues, the band had been offered to open up for The Who and Howlin’ Wolf, however, it was not possible due to Carlos' sickness at the time.\n\n9. Maria Maria (feat. The Producer G&B)\n\nAlbum: Ghetto Blues, The Product G&B, 2001\n\nReleased on November 23, 1999 as a single from the album Supernatural, the character of the song “Maria” is described as someone who is living a challenging life and is trying to figure out ways to make it better.\n\nAll in all, “Maria Maria” was an extraordinary hit around the globe and was named one of the top Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.\n\n12. Put Your Lights On (feat. Everlast)\n\nAlbum: Supernatural, 1999\n\nEverlast wrote this song and sang lead. The term \"Put Your Lights On\" basically means \"watch out,\" and is frequently addressed to the \"sinners.\" When Everlast (Erik Schrody) left House Of Pain, he gave up alcohol and nicotine, then converted to Islam. The song has a religious meaning to him, and even includes the Muslim prayer \"La Ilaha Il Allah,\" which translates to \"There is only Allah.\" Everlast wasn't sure if he should leave that part in, but Santana, who is also very spiritual, wanted it in there.\n\nSource: Song Facts\n\nSantana - Put Your Lights On, feat Everlast"
