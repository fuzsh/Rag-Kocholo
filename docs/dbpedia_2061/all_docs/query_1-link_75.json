        "text": "When Does 'Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version)' Come Out? All The 'Debut (Taylor's Version)' Clues So Far\n\nWill Taylor Swift's debut album be her final re-recording? Here's all the latest theories and easter eggs for Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version)\n\nThe countdown to Taylor Swift’s final re-recording is officially on... 'Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version)' is coming, but when will it be released?\n\nIf the theories are true, Taylor Swift will soon be reclaiming her Reputation, and she will also soon own her own name too. 'Taylor Swift (Taylor’s Version)' – also known amongst the Swifties as 'Debut (Taylor’s Version)' – could possibly be the last re-recording to be released.\n\nFor the Swifties who joined the fandom when Taylor was fully in her Pop Star Era, 'Debut (TV)' might not sound as exciting as '1989 (TV)' or 'Rep (TV)', but for the Day One country fans, it has the potential to be one of her best re-recordings of the whole bunch. While we’ve already heard her sing them as surprise songs on the Eras Tour, fans can’t wait to hear what the iconic country bops will sound like with Taylor’s matured voice.\n\nSeeing as the 'Debut (TV)' easter eggs have now started to trickle in, here's everything we know about 'Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version)' so far.\n\nRead more: How To Listen To Capital (Taylor’s Version)\n\nTaylor Swift (Taylor’s Version) release date: When will Debut (TV) be released?\n\nSince she started the Eras Tour, Taylor has released two re-recorded albums: 'Speak Now (TV)' and '1989 (TV)'. The latest theories point to 'Reputation (TV)' being announced and released while she’s on tour, which means there's a strong possibility that 'Debut (TV)' will be announced/released at some point before the Eras Tour ends in November 2024.\n\nPotentially re-releasing her very first studio album right at the end of her record-breaking, career-spanning Eras era? It doesn't get more perfect than that!\n\nWhen exactly that will be, however, remains to be seen... While all signs appear to have been hinting at Taylor releasing 'Reputation (TV)', she instead surprise announced a brand new album called 'The Tortured Poets Department', which was released on April 19th.\n\nNow, fans are theorising that 'Debut (TV)' could be released at the end of 2024 to coincide with Taylor's December birthday, or maybe even early 2025. Assuming that 'Rep (TV)' comes first, of course...\n\nWe'll update this article as soon as more theories emerge.\n\nTaylor Swift (Taylor’s Version) easter eggs: What has Taylor teased about Debut (TV) so far?\n\nThe 'Debut (TV)' easter eggs have been few and far between throughout the past few months, but Taylor appears to have finally started dropping hints. She's also blending them in with the 'Rep (TV)' easter eggs, prompting the hilarious 'Debutation' meme.\n\nSo far, Taylor has mostly hinted at 'Debut (TV)' through her outfits. Back in October 2023, she was pictured wearing a Shania Twain 'Any Man Of Mine' t-shirt paired with green socks, appearing to officially mark the start of the 'Debut (TV)' easter eggs.\n\nIn January 2024, Taylor appeared to drop the biggest 'Debut (TV)' easter egg so far when she and Keleigh Teller went to the Golden Globes in the full Debut-era colour palette. Fans clocked it right away, and even noted the butterflies adorning the wall behind them in a photo shared by Keleigh on Instagram.\n\nAt the start of the European leg of the Eras Tour, Taylor also added a brand new '1989' two-piece costume which allows her to mix and match colours. One of those colour combos is green and blue which look like the exact same shades as the debut album cover.\n\nTaylor has now worn the Green x Blue combo twice – in Lyon (Night 2) and Warsaw (Night 2). She's also worn it as a Blue x Green combo in Zurich (Night 1).\n\nTaylor Swift (Taylor’s Version) vault songs: What songs will be in the vault?\n\nBefore she was signed to Big Machine Records, Taylor used to perform at local venues and hand out demo CDs that included all the songs she had written when she was a young teenager. Some of those ended up on her debut album, some of them didn't.\n\nOG Swifties who have those CDs have since uploaded the majority of the unreleased demo songs to YouTube, but whether or not Taylor plans to re-record them as vault tracks remains to be seen.\n\nThe most popular unreleased tracks that fans are dying to see turned into vault tracks include: 'I'd Lie', 'Dark Blue Tennessee', 'Welcome Distraction', 'Nashville' and 'Sweet Tea and God's Graces'.\n\nFans are also hoping that Taylor will re-record 'I Heart ?', which was released as part of the 'Beautiful Eyes' EP.\n\nWill 'Crazier' be on Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version)?\n\nIn June 2024, Taylor sent fans into meltdown after she performed her 2009 track 'Crazier' from the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack as a surprise song on The Eras Tour. While she was singing it, the light-up bracelets in the crowd reportedly flashed green – the colour assigned to Taylor's debut era.\n\nBut will it end up as a vault track on the re-recorded album? It's not completely out of the realm of possibility...\n\nDespite being released in 2009, 'Crazier' was not written specifically for the film. Taylor actually wrote the song long before that, and sent it to Disney after they asked if she had a song \"that was perfect to fall in love to\" and \"sort of a country waltz\".\n\nTaylor has not yet confirmed when she wrote it, so it's unclear if it's a song from her debut era or her 'Fearless' era.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see whether or not Taylor decides to include it in the 'Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version)' release. If not, here's hoping she re-releases it as a single some point down the line.\n\nTaylor Swift (Taylor’s Version) vault songs: How many vault songs will there be?\n\nAs much as fans are hoping that Taylor will go all out with the 'Debut (TV)' vault and re-record as many of her old unreleased songs as possible, it's possible that she might just stick with the pattern she's established with her re-recordings.\n\n'Fearless (TV)' and 'Speak Now (TV)' both had 6 official vault tracks, while '1989 (TV)' had 5. 'Red (TV)' included 9 tracks in the vault, but only 6 of those were previously unheard songs.\n\nFans can probably expect to see at least 6 vault tracks on 'Debut (TV)' – unless Taylor switches it up completely!\n\nTaylor Swift (Taylor’s Version) vault songs: Who will Taylor collaborate with?\n\nSeeing as 'Debut (TV)' is Taylor's full-blown country era, fans are expecting the vault to feature some of the biggest and most iconic names in country music.\n\nOver the years, Taylor has spoken highly of the country artists she admires, and those who have inspired her throughout her career. In turn, they've frequently praised and supported her.\n\nSo far, Taylor has already featured Keith Urban, Maren Morris and Chris Stapleton on tracks from the vault. She's also previously collaborated with folk-country duo The Civil Wars ('Safe & Sound (Taylor's Version)') and The Chicks ('Soon You'll Get Better').\n\nBut who could appear on the 'Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version)' vault tracks? Here's all the latest names and theories...\n\nShania Twain\n\nTaylor has dropped two major Shania easter eggs so far. One is the aforementioned 'Any Man Of Mine' t-shirt, and the other is the TikTok she shared wayyy back in September 2021. In the viral 'Mama said that it was ok' clip, she cites Shania as her main influence and inspiration as a country artist moving into pop music. (Shania then duetted that video and credited Dolly Parton in her own version.)\n\nWith two Shania Twain name drops, fans are suspecting that she might be included on 'Debut (TV)'s vault...\n\nKenny Chesney\n\nDay One Swifties will know how much of an important part Kenny Chesney played in Taylor’s early success, and how the two are still great friends. The story of how Taylor and Kenny's friendship began was also recently included in Taylor's TIME Person of the Year profile. The two have appeared as surprise guests at each others shows, but collaborating with Kenny on the album that started it all would surely be a great way to end her re-recording era, right?\n\nTim McGraw\n\nTim, alongside Faith Hill, has been a major supporter of Taylor's from her early days right up to now. Taylor has previously featured on one of Tim's songs ('Highway Don't Care') but he's yet to feature on one of hers. And how perfect would it be if he was featured on the re-recording of the album featuring her debut single that was named after him?!\n\nFaith Hill\n\nTaylor credits Faith as being a \"wonderful mentor\" to her when she was just starting out. Taylor opened for Tim and Faith on their Soul2Soul II tour back in 2007, and Faith has made surprise appearances at Taylor’s Speak Now World Tour and the Reputation Stadium Tour. Could they finally be about to collaborate on a track together?\n\nKelsea Ballerini\n\nTaylor and Kelsea's friendship goes way back to 2008, when Kelsea first met Taylor at a Meet & Greet. As both of their stars rose within the country music industry, they eventually ended up hanging out together at various award shows and performing together on stage. Kelsea also appeared as a special guest on Taylor's 1989 World Tour in Nashville. Taylor has always supported Kelsea and Kelsea has always spoken highly of her. Joining forces with someone she inspired at the start of her career would be a really sweet way to end her re-recording journey.\n\nKelly Clarkson\n\nOk, so Kelly Clarkson is not a country artist but she can master any genre she sings. If Debut (TV) is the final Taylor's Version album released, fans are hoping that Kelly is somehow involved because she publicly suggested that Taylor should start re-recording her albums way back in July 2019, following the selling of her masters. Kelly recently revealed that Taylor sends her flowers after she releases a new Taylor's Version album, and the two collaborating on a track together on the final one to be released would be an incredible moment.\n\nOther names that have popped up include George Strait and Brad Paisley, both of whom Taylor supported on tour while promoting her debut album.\n\nBut we'll have to wait and see if Taylor adds any collaborators to her Debut (TV) vault tracks!\n\nRead more about Taylor Swift here:\n\nTaylor Swift re-recordings: All the release dates of the Taylor’s Version albums in order\n\nWhen does Reputation (Taylor's Version) come out?
