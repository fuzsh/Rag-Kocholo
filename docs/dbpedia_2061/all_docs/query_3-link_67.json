        "text": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- Wake Forest University continues to stand out thanks in large part to its remarkable $30 million in cash gifts to Athletics this past year, contributing to a four-year total of $131 million—a 19% increase from the previous four years.\n\nThis support highlights the university's blend of world-class academics, an unrivaled campus experience, a close-knit learning environment, and Power 4 athletics within a rapidly growing metro area. When the Demon Deacons triumph on the field or court, the entire Deacon Nation revels in the shared pride and excitement of their success—especially those who have championed the achievements of students at Wake Forest's beautiful Reynolda campus.\n\n\"I am deeply grateful to our loyal and generous Deacon Club members, parents, alumni athletes, fans, and friends,\" said Vice President & Director of Athletics John Currie. \"In a time of seismic change in intercollegiate athletics, your unwavering support is more crucial than ever. Your contributions have not only helped us set new records but have also enabled the young men and women on our beautiful Reynolda campus to excel both competitively and academically. As we navigate these transformative changes, we remain committed to being careful stewards of the hard-earned dollars you have entrusted to us. Your support fuels strategic investments in academics, technology, health, strength training, summer school, and top-notch facilities, ensuring we continue to provide a World Class Student-Athlete Experience at Wake Forest.\"\n\nHere's a summary of the remarkable giving that helped Wake Forest collectively achieve outstanding successes from the past year:\n\nInnovative \"In Her Wake\" Initiative Launches & Hits $25 Million Milestone En Route to $100M Goal in Support of Demon Deacons Women's Athletics:\n\nAs one of seven schools in the Atlantic Coast Conference with 10 NCAA Championships, including a title just over a year ago by the Demon Deacons women's golf program in May 2023, Wake Forest University has a proud and storied tradition of intercollegiate athletics. Women's athletics and the broad-based success of those programs have helped Wake Forest become the fastest-growing brand in the Power 5 since 2019 with 2.7 million fans worldwide.\n\nBack in February, on National Girls & Women's in Sports Day, Wake Forest Athletics announced a $100 million initiative to further transform opportunities for female student-athletes. Specifically, this effort enhances scholarships, personal development, and investments for women's sports programs.\n\nWith that, following the tremendous leadership and generosity of Wake Forest Athletics' International Leadership Circle members and the benevolent support of countless other Demon Deacon fans, the \"In Her Wake\" initiative has surpassed its first milestone, eclipsing the $27 million mark! These extraordinary efforts include 25 new scholarships and three named coaching positions.\n\nIgnited by the 50th Anniversary of Wake Forest Women's Athletics Celebration in the 2021-22 academic year, Wake Forest philanthropic efforts for women's programs have soared. During the celebration, Wake Athletics raised $4.1 million, allowing for a launching pad to raise another $25 million+ in the following two years —a staggering increase of nearly 520%. This remarkable growth underscores the incredible support and commitment from the Wake Forest community towards empowering Demon Deacon female student-athletes.\n\nThose interested in learning more or in supporting the In Her Wake initiative can visit this website. Truist and other lead investors have already committed over $25 million to the In Her Wake initiative this past year, as Wake Forest Athletics aims to surpass $100 million by 2029.\n\nMAKE A GIFT: https://deaconclub.com/pages/in-her-wake\n\nSPREAD THE MESSAGE: https://app.godeacs.com/InHerWake\n\nRecent Impactful In Her Wake Initiative Investments:\n\nWomen's Basketball:\n\nWomen's basketball will embark on their first international trip to Croatia and Greece later this summer.

The Shah family made this latest multimillion-dollar commitment in the spring of 2023 and it was announced in January 2024 after he authorized the University to announce it. This gift focuses on intensifying Wake Forest's strategic pursuit of basketball excellence in a highly competitive landscape and provides head coach Steve Forbes and his staff a broader means to invest in Wake's student-athlete experience, sports performance, medicine and wellness, innovation, and advanced technology. Previously, Mit Shah provided the lead investment for the $12 million Shah Basketball Complex and helped drive the creation of the Chris Paul Family Men's Basketball Clubhouse. The Shah Basketball Complex is renowned as one of America's foremost practice, training, and player development facilities, featuring 40,000 state-of-the-art square feet dedicated solely to Wake Forest Basketball.\n\nFollowing a generous multi-million dollar gift from Pam ('79) and Jeff ('78) Kentner and their family, Wake Forest Athletics was proud to unveil a state-of-the-art video board for Deacon Nation ahead of the 2024 baseball season.\n\nSupport from Far & Near:\n\nThis year, Wake Forest Athletics witnessed an extraordinary level of engagement from our community, with more than 5,000 individual donors stepping up to support Wake Forest Athletics.

Total giving to sport-specific excellence funds increased by 10 percent in FY24.\n\nFacility Investments:\n\nIn August 2023, Wake Forest dedicated the McCreary Football Complex ahead of the football season marking the latest tally in $175 million invested in world-class athletics facilities over the last 10 years.\n\nIn the continued effort to provide a World Class Student-Athlete Experience and bring Value to the Wake Forest Community, a new track surface was installed this spring by Beynon inside Kentner Stadium on Wake Forest's Reynolda Campus.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWake Forest Athletics remains focused on building upon this success and ensuring a world-class experience for all Demon Deacon student-athletes.
