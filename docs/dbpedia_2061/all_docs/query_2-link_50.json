        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nThe latest installment in the NOW That’s What I Call Music! franchise is here, and the new compilation album features the best K-pop artists of 2024.\n\nReleased on May 17, NOW That’s What I Call K-Pop is the first NOW! album to include the K-Pop genre since the franchise started in the UK back in 1983 (the first U.S. compilation album was released in 1998).\n\nThe new album features 20 tracks from artists including Stray Kids, Seventeen, Twice, NCT 127, NCT Dream, Tomorrow x Together, Enhypen and Le Sserafim. It’s selling quickly too: as of this writing, the NOW! K-pop album is sold out on vinyl on both Walmart and Amazon (though both sites say it’s being restocked).\n\nLike most K-pop releases, this album comes with bonus collectibles, including photocards of all 20 featured artists, plus additional group images in a collectible booklet or fold-out photo spread. Here’s where to buy NOW That’s What I Call K-Pop on CD and vinyl online.\n\nHere is the full tracklist of songs and artists from NOW That’s What I Call K-Pop:\n\nTrending\n\n1. STRAY KIDS – LALALALA\n\n2. SEVENTEEN – God of Music\n\n3. TOMORROW X TOGETHER – Sugar Rush Ride\n\n4. TWICE – I GOT YOU\n\n5. NCT 127 – Fact Check\n\n6. aespa – Drama\n\n7. ENHYPEN – Bite Me\n\n8. LE SSERAFIM – UNFORGIVEN (feat. Nile Rodgers)\n\n9. ITZY – UNTOUCHABLE\n\n10. NMIXX – DASH\n\n11. (G)I-DLE – Queencard\n\n12. RED VELVET – Chill Kill\n\n13. NCT DREAM – Broken Melodies\n\n14. FIFTY FIFTY – Cupid (Twin Version)\n\n15. fromis_9 – #menow\n\n16. Kep1er – Giddy\n\n17. STAYC – Bubble\n\n18. tripleS – Rising\n\n19. RIIZE – Get a Guitar\n\n20. ZEROBASEONE – In Bloom\n\nNOW That’s What I Call K-Pop is considered a “special edition” in the NOW! discography. As for the rest of the franchise, it’s hard to believe that new compilation albums are still being released. The latest version is NOW That’s What I Call Music 90, which was released May 2."
