        "text": "Thank you for reminding me about that one. I was record shopping in 1972 and bought the first PPL because I liked the cover. Glad I did.\n\nJust bought the CD on Discog. A bit expensive, but for this album it is worth it. Its also my birthday month, so it's my present to myself.\n\nI noticed the songs on the Record Day store release don't match what I downloaded (many, many years ago) from archive.org .\n\nRock n' Roll Doctor\n\nTwo Trains\n\nThe Fan\n\nOn Your Way Down\n\nSpanish Moon >\n\nSkin It Back >\n\nFat Man In The Bath Tub\n\nOh Atlanta\n\nWillin'\n\nCold Cold Cold >\n\nDixie Chicken >\n\nTripe Face Boogie\n\nThe liner notes say the Rhino version is the full show with some alternate second versions of songs.\n\nAs \"essential\" as Waiting for Columbus may \"be\", it doesn't hold a candle to the energy of Electrif Lycanthrope. I loved that recording from the days of the bootleg, although it is not strictly the same and some \"sweetening\" and/or remixing went on to the official one that was not on the original boot, and was overjoyed when it was released officially. I remember seeing the boot on the merch table at a Little Feat show even. But my advice is save your money on the official live WFC and invest it in EF instead. It is miles and miles above WFC in performance. WFC sounds like over production in action and while clear and clean, sounds like it has had all the energy sucked out of it. I just bought the 2 CD version for the extra tracks but it just served to remind me how disappointed I was in it when it originally came out on vinyl.\n\nOther than that, my favorite has long been Feats Don't Fail Me Now, and I think Hoy Hoy was a fantastic compilation, it even includes one or two tracks from the same Ultrasound session as of EF.\n\njb\n\nColumbus is essential, in my opinion. The band dynamics had changed a bit from 1974 to 1977. And, you’ve the Tower Of Power horns. What’s not to like?\n\nRegarding Electrif Lycanthrope, it was remixed from the multitrack tapes. I’m not sure what you mean by “sweetening”. That would indicate extra stuff or fixes, which isn’t the case. Columbus, on the other hand, Lowell redid his vocals and guitar, in spots.\n\nSpanish Moon is better on Waiting For Columbus than the studio version similar to how The Fan is better on Electric Lycanthrope than the studio version. Waiting For Columbus is also worth it for the Mick Taylor cameo on A Apolitcal Blues. However, I prefer the energy on Electrif Lycanthrope more and I do prefer the studio versions to some of the live versions on Waiting For Columbus.\n\nWFC sounds overproduced to my ears, like all of it was redone in the studio to make up for lack of passion or something in the original recording. EL on the other hand sounds like Little Feat on a really great night, and not the later, \"weather report\" styled band that Lowell George said he had come to hate. So, make your choice, its clear to me which it should be, or get both and compare for yourself.\n\nThe \"sweetening\" of the official EL I was referring to in my earlier post takes the form more of a possible remix vs the original TAKRL release which tends to bury the piano parts in favor of the lead guitar and the drums and percussion sound a bit more subdued compared to what I was used to. Also sounds like they used a couple of alternate takes compared to the original. Still, its miles beyond what you hear on WFC as far as the band seeming to enjoy what they are playing and really putting some soul into it vs phoning it in during one more night of touring.\n\nPlus you get to hear George change \"bag of reds from your neighborhood dealer\" to \"barbeque ribs from...\" in The Fan, apparently in deference to the radio audience. So funny and so classic.\n\njb"
