        "text": "List of top 100 RIAA-certified album artists and top 50 RIAA-certified digital single artists\n\nThis is the list of the highest-certified music artists in the United States based on certifications of albums and digital singles (but not physical singles) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[1] RIAA certifications are based on wholesale shipments rather than retail sales. Since 2016, the RIAA album certification has also included on-demand audio/video streams (1,500 streams = 1 album unit) and track sale equivalent (10 track sales = 1 album unit).[2] Additionally, awards are only presented if and when a record company applies for certification. Therefore, the total certified units for a given artist may be incomplete or out of date.\n\nThe RIAA began its certifications in 1958, therefore, popular artists from earlier eras are generally not represented on this list. As of February 10, 2024 , the Beatles have the highest total certified albums and Drake has the highest total certified digital singles. Eminem is the only act in the top 20 of both lists.\n\nList of artists with the top 100 highest-certified albums as of July 23, 2024[3] Rank Units\n\n(millions) Name Nat.
