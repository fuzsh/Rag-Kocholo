        "text": "When Black Pumas made their self-titled debut in 2019, the Austin duo set off a reaction almost as combustible and rapturous as their music itself. Along with earning a career total of seven Grammy Award nominations, singer/songwriter Eric Burton and guitarist/producer Adrian Quesada achieved massive success as a live act and delivering a transcendent show Burton aptly refers to as “electric church.” As they set to work on their highly awaited sophomore album, the band broadened their palette to include a dazzling expanse of musical forms: heavenly hybrids of soul and symphonic pop, mind-bending excursions into jazz-funk and psychedelia, starry-eyed love songs that feel dropped down from the cosmos. In creating the follow-up Chronicles of a Diamond, Black Pumas made a point of tuning out any sense of anticipation from the outside world. “I knew the first record was good when we finished it, but I had no idea people would respond like they did,” says Quesada. “This time around there was a lot of pressure and expectation that we hadn’t felt before, which was overwhelming at times, but we did our best to tune that out and focus on trusting ourselves like we always have.” As a result, Chronicles of a Diamond wholly echoes an essential intention behind its creation. “More than anything I wanted to make something we’d be thrilled to play live 200 days a year,” says Burton. “I wanted to be able to laugh, cry, bob my head, do the thing: it was all very much a selfish endeavor.”\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nA hard-working Canadian roots rock outfit from Victoria, British Columbia, Current Swell formed in 2005 around the talents of Scott Stanton, Dave Lang, Ghosty Boy, and Chris Petersen. Employing an eclectic blend of blues-rock, folk, surf, indie rock, reggae, and ska, the band has drawn comparisons to everyone from Jack Johnson and Blitzen Trapper to Xavier Rudd and the Black Keys. Current Swell built their fan base from the grassroots level, performing at house shows, beaches, and wherever else the wind blew them, all the while developing a strong internet presence that's earned them devoted fans both regionally and internationally. They released their debut studio album, So I Say, in 2005, followed by Trust Us Now (2007) and Protect Your Own (2009), the latter of which spawned the hit single \"Young and Able.\" 2012's Long Time Ago, the band's first worldwide release, resulted in a world tour that saw the group land festival dates in Europe and Australia. 2014's Ulysses was produced by Nathan Sabatino (Dr. Dog, White Rabbits) at Vancouver's Greenhouse Studios and featured the single \"Rollin'.\" Recorded in Nashville and Vancouver with Grammy-winning producer Jacquire King (Tom Waits, Kings of Leon, Norah Jones), When to Talk and When to Listen, the group's third Nettwerk Records release and fifth outing overall, dropped in early 2017.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nThe Victoria four-piece—brothers Nelson and Morgan Bankes on vocals and guitar, lead guitarist Carson Cleaver, and drummer Gray Oxley—formed in a pool hall one Friday night in 2017. Less than a week later, they played their first gig. Delivering a dynamic set list ranging from Otis Redding to Talking Heads, the former high school classmates were overwhelmed by an undeniable musical chemistry. Within three days of the first show, they had written a handful of original songs, including an early version of \"See Me Run\", the EP’s soulful, swelling closing track.\n\nThe result is In Waves, a six-track shot of dopamine spilling over with irresistibly catchy melodies, exhilarating vocals, and joyous indie-rock instrumentation. Produced and recorded by indie legend Steve Bays (Hot Hot Heat, The Zolas, Mounties), the EP is the culmination of the band's wide-ranging influences--from Elvis to The Strokes, Paul Simon to The Pixies—coming together in a way that defies sonic parallels, yet remains welcomingly familiar. The first release has the pretty grittiness of The Lumineers, the free-wheeling energy of the late-aughts indie bands, and the powerhouse belting of blues-rock contemporaries like Marcus King. Yet the sum of these parts is something fresh, exciting, and uniquely vibrant within the current sea of sleepy vocals and sedated guitar tones. The Bankes Brothers sound like the youthful high of a late-night romance and the blissful stagger home the next morning.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nSurf Hat are a psych-surf group from Squamish, BC, Canada. Their debut record “Surf Hat” has gathered hundreds of thousands of streams and they have established a rapidly growing fan-base across North America.\n\nThe classic power-trio lineup delivers the verby, jangly surf-rock guitar style of modern bands mixed with the sweetly harmonized vocals of beloved classics. Picture Allah-lahs meeting The Ventures or The Beatles.\n\nSurf Hat are looking to take their signature sound on the road for the next million years or so. Surf Hat released their sophomore album “Surf Hat Ranch” in March 2024.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nForged through pain, suffering and countless hardships, this band of misfit toys chose to utilize playing high energy rock shows as therapy… Mainly because it was the closest thing to therapy they could afford ultimately proving that tough times don’t last but the people do. These good time rock and rollers might break a heart or two but promise to put it back together in 4 chords or less. If Friday was a band, it would be Trophy Dad.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nWhile his 17-year residence recently came to a sudden stop with the sad shuttering of Smiths Pub, Bill Stuart is prepared to bring eclectic, all-vinyl sets for your mood manifestations. Not a beat-juggling scratch whiz or floor filler, this simple substance selector of the sonic pansexual is also one half of BDSM (Bill & Don’s Sound Machine with db Chessa) and occasionally digs in the Crates of Wrath with Dan Reid. He has zero problem with your requests, so long as said song can be found in his ever-rotating boxes of waxy wonders.\n\nKnown for a creatively languid style that swings lyrically from highly personal alt-rap to morbid horrorcore, Earl Sweatshirt helped launch Odd Future into hip-hop prominence around the turn of the 2010s and soon became one of the most unique rapper/producers around. After he made his solo debut in 2010 with the acclaimed mixtape Earl, his first two albums, Doris (2013) and the seriously (and descriptively) titled I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside (2015), charted in the upper reaches of the Billboard 200. By the time he released his third LP, Some Rap Songs (2018), Earl had either produced or appeared on tracks by most of the Odd Future affiliates, including Tyler, The Creator and Frank Ocean, as well as similarly left-field artists such as Danny Brown and Denmark Vessey. His fourth album, the tightly focused Sick!, arrived in 2022, and he surprise-released Voir Dire, a record made collaboratively with producer the Alchemist, in 2023.\n\nBorn Thebe Kgositsile in Chicago, Illinois, Earl Sweatshirt was known as Sly Tendencies until 2009, the year the Los Angeles-based rapper and producer was invited by Tyler, The Creator to join Odd Future. In March 2010, at the age of 16, he debuted with Earl, a mixtape that garnered critical acclaim, but he was subsequently sent to a Samoan boarding school by his mother. Upon his 2012 return to L.A., determined to build on the success of the tape, he eased himself back into the scene with a number of collaborations, most notably appearances on Odd Future's The OF Tape, Vol. 2 and Frank Ocean's Grammy-winning Channel Orange.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nInstrumental Artist of the Year at the 2022 Western Canadian Music Awards, Astrocolor blend elements of jazz, psychedelia, and electronica – resulting in an experimental genre of their own cosmic invention, aptly dubbed “AstroJazz.”\n\nAstrocolor’s catalogue has over 10 million streams on the major platforms and regular national radio airplay in Canada from flagship CBC shows including Drive and Afterdark. The band’s dynamic live show has brought them to notable festivals including Bass Coast, Burning Man, Shambhala, Rifflandia, Laketown Shakedown, and the Victoria International Jazz Festival.\n\nThe new album \"Moonlighting – AstroJazz Vol.1\" was Executive Produced and mixed by GRAMMY-winner Steve Christensen, Best known as Khruangbin’s longtime producer and studio collaborator. Christensen added his revered touch to the spacious soundscapes the band has been celebrated for.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nJungle is an English modern soul musical collective founded by childhood friends, Tom McFarland and Josh Lloyd-Watson. Jungle was formed at the beginning of 2013, choosing to put an aesthetic emphasis on the music’s surrounding artwork and videos, and not on the pairs' own identity, (McFarland and Lloyd-Watson came to be known as J and T). Throughout the following year Jungle developed its nature as a collective by working with different artists across diverse disciplines. To perform the music live, Jungle expanded to a seven-piece band, fronted by J and T. Their debut album Jungle was released through XL Recordings on 14 July 2014. The album was met with great critical acclaim and was later shortlisted for the 2014 Mercury Prize. Their 2nd album, For Ever, was released on 14 September 2018.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nDRAMA is the multicultural collaboration between producer Na’el Shehade’s chic Chicago house-infused production style, and vocalist Via Rosa whose soulful delivery is inspired by the improvisational nature of jazz and playful patterns of hip-hop and bossa nova. The duo play to the complementary dynamics of their unlikely pairing by blurring the lines between R&B and dance-pop, heartbreak and bliss.\n\nMusical collaborations include Flight Facilities, Poolside, Jamila Woods, Tensnake and with Gorgon City for their global dance hit, “You’ve Done Enough”. Since a chance meeting nearly 10 years ago led to the creation of DRAMA, the duo has bootstrapped a subtle rise on their own terms, self-releasing several EPs and mapping multiple tours and playing some of the biggest festivals with Midwestern grit.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nA sonic alchemist, Murge weaves the eclectic and the electric to create dancefloor-centric beats that fill the space and lift the crowd. Unorthodox sounds intertwine to create an expansive aural journey filled with fresh, earthy bass and neoteric instrumentals. Championed by the legendary Sasha and signed to Emacipator’s Loci Records, Murge’s influences are wide ranging and free flowing; from the Cosmic era of disco to psychedelic jazz, from Latin rhythms fused with the elasticity and inclusiveness of world-inspired music.

From then on, Saundra's career path was set in motion. To date, Saundra has performed, written and appeared in and for various musical endeavors and high profile professional settings. Her credits include work for recording sessions, international music releases, tv appearances, film and most prominently, live shows as part of several successful and well-known touring acts and bands.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nWhen can I say that I’ve grown? It’s from this question that Nicky MacKenzie's soulful new EP MORALS was born. The seven tracks are an exploration of the emotional landscape the 23-year-old Canadian singer-songwriter has traversed since her debut album. In that time, MacKenzie has left her hometown, navigated shifting relationships, graced the stages of huge festivals, and played intimate shows. All the while, she’s been coaxing new songs and sounds out of this mercurial space, constantly pushing the boundaries of her artistry.\n\nMORALS establishes MacKenzie as a skillful songwriter capable of both poignant restraint and irresistibly catchy pop melodies. Her kinetic vocals weave hypnotic R&B melodies into lush arrangements, drawing inspiration from the likes of Charlotte Day Wilson, Daniel Caesar, and Hozier. The EP moves from the quiet, introspective crackle of “Lost and Found” to powerhouse pop offerings like \"I Should Go\" and \"No Man's Land,\" a dynamic, Dua Lipa-esque ride erupting with vibrant brass. Tracks “Grown” and “Comfortable” examine the space between adolescence and young adulthood, questioning what it will feel like to finally arrive in a place of self-reliance.\n\nBy focusing on the universalities that shape us—breakups, self-doubt, nights out—MacKenzie leaves space for her audience to unpack their own experiences. There is both grit and grandeur on MORALS, showcasing an indelible talent for crafting soul-moving songs that linger in the heart, body, and mind.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nPosh Coat is a wardrobe full of leather, faux fur and silk, paired with your favourite flared jeans and Chuck Taylors.

The band soon amassed a devoted underground following, thanks in part to a series of “experiential concerts” with such themes as Zombie Prom and Judgment Day, then found breakout success with their critically acclaimed 2012 debut album Voyeur. After signing to Elektra Records, Saint Motel saw their fanbase grow exponentially with the release of My Type EP, a 2014 effort whose platinum-certified title track became a top 10 alternative radio hit. In 2016, they flipped the script once again with saintmotelevision—a first-of-its-kind full-length accompanied by virtual music videos for all ten of its tracks, making it the world’s first-ever virtual-reality album. In addition to touring with acts like Arctic Monkeys, Imagine Dragons, Band of Skulls, and Weezer, Saint Motel have also spent much of the last half-decade bringing their captivating live show to leading festivals like Coachella, Lollapalooza, and Bonnaroo.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nUnder the late-night glow of a lunar muse, Hotel Mira crafted their latest anthem “Dancing with the Moonlight.” The single, produced by Steve Bays (Fur Trade, Hot Hot Heat) and mixed by Tony Hoffer (Phoenix, The Kooks) arrives at streaming services on April 6th through Light Organ Records.\n\n“Dancing with the Moonlight” is the third Hotel Mira single to be released following the breakthrough success of 2020 debut full-length Perfectionism. While other recent tracks were rooted in vocalist/songwriter Charlie Kerr’s acoustic workshopping over IG Live, “Dancing with the Moonlight” took feverish, happenstantial shape at Bays’ Tugboat Pl. facility in New Westminster, BC. Kerr initially strummed its melody out as a possible bridge to another song, but the band and Bays quickly saw potential in transforming the earworm hook into its own wild beast. During an all-night session, and under the auspices of “how can we make this as unpredictable and energetic as possible,” this all manifests via zipline synths, sleek disco strings, and the frantic and fiery coup-de-grace of Clark Grieve’s speaker-blowing guitar solo.\n\n“Dancing with the Moonlight” follows the singles “Fever Pitch” (#6 on the Mediabase Can-Alternative radio chart) and “Eventually”, and continues Hotel Mira’s push towards a to-be-detailed sophomore album. The band tour the American southwest this April, with additional North American dates scheduled for May and June.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nVox Rea features Kate Kurdyak (lead vocals/piano/guitar/violin) and Lauren Kurdyak (vocals/piano/percussion). The two sisters released their debut album, To Bring You My Heart, on 604 Records in 2017 under the name “The Katherines.” The album garnered over a million spins on Spotify with songs featured on playlists including New Music Friday, Pop All Day, Hot Hits Canada, Indie Pop Chillout and the Canada Viral 50 chart. Their songs were also featured on TV shows Orphan Black, Reboot, and The Order. The album attracted media attention from Vice, MTV, the Vancouver Sun and the National Post. The band also performed on morning shows in Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver.\n\nAfter a hiatus to study philosophy in the mountains, the band resurfaced under the moniker, Vox Rea, in the fall of 2020. The new name’s intentional ambiguity allowed for an identity beyond the stereotype of being labelled a “girl-band” and represents the reclamation of their creative control. Every part of the project – the music, the image, and the message – is created by the band. Vox Rea focuses on art as an experience as opposed to a product and their music chronicles the odyssey of a group of artists trying to come to terms with their generation’s place in the human story. Themes of addiction, self-doubt, lust, identity, independence and grief form the undercurrent of lyrics that are deeply introspective. Hell bent on creating a meaningful life amidst the siren songs of consumerism and efficiency, Vox Rea believes in the revolutionary power of art.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nEmerging from Victoria (British Columbia, Canada) in 2024, these 4 musicians sculpt their music with the high standards and taste of expert craftsmen. The band captures the mythic spirit of Arcade Fire, the drama of Muse, and the mischievousness of Arctic Monkeys.

Welcome to The Underground.”\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nHaving dabbled in the art of DJing since he was 15, Bryan Capistrano (DJ Boitano) has been able to apply his love for all things music into his career.

Additionally, he has been the music mix producer of Victoria’s Canada Day Fireworks for the past several years.\n\nSpotify\n\nGrammy-nominated singer-songwriter and rising global superstar Jessie Reyez released her debut studio album ‘Before Love Came To Kill Us’ via FMLY / Island Records to critical acclaim in March 2020.

They became fast friends but took several years to work on music individually before joining forces as Flyana Boss (a tongue-in-cheek spin on Diana Ross).

In 2023, Flyana Boss began releasing songs at a faster clip, pairing singles together for the EPs Boffum and Vitamin FB.

The videos spawned countless imitators and earned the pair more than a million followers on the app. As the year went on, the duo parlayed the success of \"You Wish\" into a remix featuring Missy Elliott; another string of singles including \"Bitch Imma Star,\" \"Big One,\" and \"UFHO\"; and their live debut, first as an opener for Janelle Monáe before embarking on headlining shows in 2024.\n\nSpotify Apple Music Instagram\n\nSonReal is the moniker of Canadian singer, songwriter, rapper and visual artist Aaron Hoffman.
