        "text": "On March 25, Southern California metal masters Night Demon will release a special compilation album - titled Year Of The Demon - via Century Media Records. Comprised of the band's five standalone 7\" singles from 2020, this 10-track collection features original songs, cover tunes, and previously unheard live recordings. For a first preview of the record, Night Demon has launched a new single - a cover version of Cirith Ungol's classic \"100 MPH feat. Tim Baker (Cirith Ungol)\". Preorder Year Of The Demon here.\n\nJarvis Leatherby (Vocals / Bass) comments: \"2020 was certainly the 'Year Of The Demon' in so many ways! Never in our wildest imagination would we be releasing (5) 7\" singles in a calendar year, and nowhere in our fans' imagination would one of the hardest touring bands of the last decade be sidelined (along with the rest of the world) by this virus that demonized our lives. We are proud to finally release these songs as a complete collection and include the rare B-sides that only saw the light of day on the collector's record player. Here's to 2022 and the future bringing us all something more to hope for. We have a lot more to come this year!\"\n\nWhen the world came to a gut-wrenching halt in March 2020, Night Demon's extensive touring plans were derailed; however, their creative flame burned brighter than ever. In the spring and summer of 2020, the band unleashed a series of five standalone, limited 7\" singles, which their loyal legions voraciously devoured; all physical product sold out instantly. Aside from the original songs (which were also released on digital/streaming platforms), the single recordings were exclusive to the 7\" vinyl pressings; they have never been made available to the public for purchase in any other format - until now, with Year Of The Demon.\n\nFor Night Demon fans that are ravenous for fresh material - 2022 truly is \"the year of the demon.” In addition to the compilation due out in March, the band is excited to reveal that they are presently working on a new studio album, with a scheduled release date of November 4th, 2022. Stay tuned for more details coming soon.\n\nYear of the Demon format details:\n\n-Digital Album\n\n-Ltd.
