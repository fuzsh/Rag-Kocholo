        "text": "ELUCID has announced a new album, REVELATOR, which is set to come out on October 11 via Fat Possum. Today, he’s shared a new single, ‘INSTANT TRANSFER’, featuring his Armand Hammer bandmate billy woods. Check it out below.\n\n‘INSTANT TRANSFER’ was recorded “in Los Angeles at The Alchemist’s studio about to catch a flight to Australia,” ELUCID recalled in a press release. “With much momentum behind me/us and even more on the horizon, I knew a purpose. I knew every step was ordered to that purpose.”\n\nREVELATOR features another collaboratios with billy woods called ‘Bad Pollen’, as well as guest appearances from wCreature and Skech185. Additional producers on the album, which follows 2022’s I Told Bessie, include August Fanon, Child Actor, The Lasso, and DJ Haram. “I wanted to get as freaky as I could at this moment,” ELUCID said. “I wanted people to hear things, maybe for the first time, or in a way they haven’t for a long while.”\n\nREVELATOR Cover Artwork:\n\nREVELATOR Tracklist:"
