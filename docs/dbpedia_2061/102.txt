Disclosure‘s debut album will be called Settle, and released on June 3 through PMR.

We found out the album’s release date yesterday evening, and a press release sent out today reveals the record’s title. A new single from the album, ‘You & Me’ featuring Eliza Doolittle, will be released on April 28. Past singles ‘Latch’ (feat. Sam Smith) and ‘White Noise’ (feat. AlunaGeorge), which peaked at #2 in the UK singles charts, will also feature on Settle. ‘You & Me’ will be debuted on radio this Friday, April 19, through Annie Mac’s Radio 1 show, and will be released through iTunes on April 28.

The duo have been releasing records since 2010, but came into their own in 2012, with a series of well-received releases (‘Latch’, ‘Tenderly’, EP The Face and their remix of Jessie Ware’s ‘Running’) establishing them as one of the UK’s most talked-about acts.
