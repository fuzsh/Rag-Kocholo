        "text": "Jan. 24, 2024\n\nJim Harris\n\nManaging Editor Arkansas Wildlife Magazine\n\nConditions Turn Right in Nick of Time\n\nThe water and frigid weather arrive for strong finish to waterfowl season.\n\nIt was nearly a season-long wait, but the habitat conditions that Arkansas waterfowlers were waiting for finally arrived. The snow cover to the north (not to mention all over Arkansas for a few days) and bitterly cold weather, the thaw that followed, plus the heavy rain of the past several days around the state all have made waterfowl conditions perfect to conclude the state’s 60-day hunting season next Wednesday.\n\nAnecdotal reports received by AGFC staff at midweek were that hunting was wrapping up exceptionally well throughout the state. In two aerial surveys, one in early December and another in the first week of January, mallards and total duck numbers in the Arkansas Delta were at significantly low levels, partly because of the extreme dry conditions seen throughout the region over fall and early winter. That changed drastically beginning with the winter storm that arrived on Jan. 15.\n\nThe duck hunting success was not only in the Delta but even in southwest Arkansas and on Millwood Lake, where a report said that while hunters were having to break ice to launch and load up earlier this week, they reported a fair amount of wood ducks, few mallards and teal.\n\nThe Arkansas Game and Fish Commission’s plans to fly its third and final aerial waterfowl survey has run into some roadblocks with the weather of the past week and a half.\n\nThe weather hasn’t been cooperative for flying our aerial surveys but (the biologists) were able to start getting up in the air at the end of last week,” Brett Leach, the AGFC’s waterfowl program coordinator, said Wednesday. “Birds were concentrated with how frozen we were, and during that time, those hunters who scouted and braved the elements did very well where they could find open water.\n\n“We are finally getting favorable conditions across the state with all the rain we are getting and should have a strong finish to the season. With the warm up and additional water across the landscape, birds will start dispersing into the new habitat being provided.”\n\nWebb’s Sporting Goods in DeWitt reported, “Looks like we are going to finish out a strong duck season for 2023-2024. We have a lot of migratory birds in the area of DeWitt. Got a little bit of a rise on both the Arkansas and White rivers; plenty of ducks (are) being killed and limits reached. Geese are still abundantly available in the area as well.”\n\nYouth under 16, veterans and active military will have a special waterfowl hunt day on Saturday, Feb. 3.\n\nAlso, the Light Goose Conservation Order, which allows for hunting for snow and Ross’s geese with liberal regulations (no limit, no slugs for shotguns, electronic calls, etc.), begins Thursday, Feb. 1; breaks for the special hunt day on Feb. 3; and resumes on Sunday Feb. 4. That will coincide with what has become an annual affair based out of Mack’s Prairie Wings in Stuttgart: The 6th Annual World Championship Snow Goose Conservation Hunt, which is run by the Arkansas Waterfowl Association and Mack’s on Feb. 4. Click on the previous sentence for all the details.\n\nFor waterfowl hunting on national wildlife refuges run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through Jan. 31, please refer to the 2023-24 Arkansas Waterfowl Hunting Guidebook.\n\nYouth planning to hunt Feb. 3 may apply for a variety of permitted hunts for their special day. Permits on private rice fields are available to youths for that Saturday through the AGFC’s Waterfowl Rice Incentive Conservation Enhancement program. Also, the youth blind at Steve N. Wilson Raft Creek Bottoms WMA and the three blinds at Sheffield Nelson Dagmar WMA Conway George Tracts are available, along with the Red Cut Slough units at Cypress Bayou WMA near Beebe and the blinds at Freddie Black Choctaw Island WMA West Unit in southeast Arkansas. Youth who win a WRICE permit may bring three other youths to hunt, or a mentor 16 years of age or older may accompany the youth to call and retrieve ducks. The application period runs from 3 p.m. Thursday to midnight Sunday this week.\n\nVeterans and active military hunters will not be eligible for the WRICE permits, but they can hunt Raft Creek Bottoms or Red Cut Slough (pick up a permit at the visitor kiosk) or any other WMA, as well as other public or private lands, from 30 minutes before sunrise to sunset on Feb. 3.\n\nArkansas’s regular waterfowl season will conclude at sunset Wednesday, Jan. 31. Hunting in the state’s Wildlife Management Areas will last all day Jan. 31, and areas such as Steve N. Wilson Raft Creek Bottoms WMA and Red Cut Slough of Cypress Bayou WMA that typically do not offer Wednesday hunting during the season will be open to hunt on the final day until sunset. Hunters will still need to pick up permits at those locations on Wednesday at the access areas or visitor kiosks. They’ll also be required to complete the data cards on the permits and turn them in at the conclusion of their hunt.\n\nVisit https://www.agfc.com/en/hunting/where-hunt for a clickable map of WMAs available to hunt in Arkansas.\n\nYouth under 16, veterans and active military will have a special waterfowl hunt day on Saturday, Feb. 3.\n\nAlso, the Light Goose Conservation Order, which allows for hunting for snow and Ross’s geese with liberal regulations (no limit, no slugs for shotguns, electronic calls, etc.), begins Thursday, Feb. 1; breaks for the special hunt day on Feb. 3; and resumes on Sunday Feb. 4.
