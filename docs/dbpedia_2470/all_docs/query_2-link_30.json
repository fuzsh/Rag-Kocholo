        "text": "I have been searching for George Leach Junior since last august to no avail.\n\nHis parents were George Leach Senior (fish and game dealer) and Catherine Shiels from Runcorn Cheshire.\n\nHe had 2 younger brothers, Kieren Edward known as Eddie who is my grand dad and a 3rd brother that I only discovered of because a codocil had his name mentioned in it. I have actually found his grand daughter only in the last couple of weeks and have been in regular contact with her but she was unaware that he had siblings and said that he was \"disowned\" by his family.\n\nMy Aunt from Eddie's branch had given me the names of George's daughters - except they were actually the 3rd son's daughters! She knew that great grannie's will was to be divided 3 ways but she didn't know who the 3rd person was. William's grand daughter was unaware of any money that he was to inherit.\n\nI have an Ann Leach born 1930 circa apparently belonging to George Leach born circa 1896 but have been unable to find him or even his wife or even the daughter. George was from Nelson Lancashire.\n\nWould appreciate any pointers so that I can lay this branch of the family to rest!\n\nFurther I wonder whether it is possible to find out whether a will's wishes are carried out?\n\nAlly x\n\nGeorge Leach was the eldest living son of Catherine or Kate Shiel(d) and George Leach Snr (1860) and was born in Nelson Burnley on Manchester Road.\n\nI have him down as living with his family on the 1911 census as a 15 year old hair apprentice and from there the trail seems to run cold.\n\nI have researched his brother Kieran Edward known as Eddie Leach and who was my grand father. Elusive and he had a mistress and was an undischarged bankrupt according to his mistress cum business partner. She scattered his ashes in Margate with his \"brother\" but we dont know which brother.\n\nI found the younger brother's family quite by chance on the Genes Reunited site last year and since then we have corresponded and I have met his youngest daughter and his grand daughter. His daughter remembered meeting Eddie but was unaware that there was an older brother.\n\nFrom what I can gather, Eddie is the one that pinched his brothers' rightful ownerships to their inheritance left by their mother when she died youngish of cancer. The younger brother never had any money - he apparently was well known for saying that Eddie did him out of his inheritance.\n\nGeorge was apparently the executor of his mother's will but that was only because he was over the age of 21 when she died.\n\nAny suggestions of where to look would be gratefully appreciated. I am assuming that he didn't die in WW1 because he was named in his mother's will and she died in 1920. And then, rightly or wrongly, I have presumed he was too old for WW2. There are 7 exact records for a George Leach but I have no idea whether he stayed in the Lancashire area after the 1911 census or whether he moved down to Coventry or Rugby like his younger brother Bill did.\n\nSorry its a tad long winded. I feel so frustrated that I cannot get any further with this brother.\n\nRegards\n\nALLY WHITTAKER"
