        "text": "As I said, Dr. Walsh treats the whole patient. She remembers things about me and my life, and she watches for ways or treatments that may improve my life. I think she is an excellent doctor!\n\nDr Walsh is a very caring Dr. I feel that she really listens to my challenges and works to find the best resolutions, including me in all options, and we decide together which things to utilize in finding the best things to help me.\n\nDr. Jessica Walsh is absolutely a Class Act. She spent so much personal time with me. She educates me each time we see each other. I trust her with my life and she's pulled me through some tough times. She truly is wonderful and very thorough.\n\nDr Walsh is the best! She listens to my concerns and addresses them directly. She monitors my symptoms and helps me deal with them. Can you hire more doctors like her?\n\nDr Walsh is amazingly talented and focused on the role of my care. She has helped me more than I can ever say. Thank you for your dedication to your profession.\n\nShe is the BEST in the business. She gives Healthcare a good name in a day and age when others don't. She is so knowledgeable, yet takes time and listens to me. I do not know what I would do with my medical problems if it were not for her and her staff!\n\nShe is very caring, and extremely thorough. She listens and asks questions that are thought out and pertinent to me. I am so glad this department reached out to me since I m at risk for psoriatic arthritis and because of that and the results of the imaging and tests she ordered, I am not ignoring symptoms I've had and getting help.\n\nShe is very caring of my conditions and is looking for solutions to solve them, but she talks it all through with me as how we should proceed so I trust her call.\n\nI have had the good fortune to have been Dr Walsh's patient for several years and she took me back after my 2.5 year stay in California. I trust her completely and feel fortunate to have her expertise available.\n\nI had a much better experience with Dr Walsh, Dr Krutko, and their teams than another provider at UH rheumatology. I felt like I was a part of the decision making process. I felt that they had a genuine concern in accurately identifying what the issue was. Everything was explained clearly and concisely.\n\nNot sure. It was a tough travel for 2 70 year olds to travel four hours one way to be told wait until October, don't take your infusions and we will see what happens. So far I am not feeling good about my experience. If I don't hear anything back from the doctor soon about my scans and blood tests then our trip will be bad and probably not worth the travel from Idaho Falls to SLC."
