Despite the fact that deregulation of Wnt signaling underlies numerous developmental disorders and cancers, including nearly all colorectal cancers, many of these mechanisms remain poorly understood. The long-term goal of research in the Ahmed Lab is to elucidate the mechanisms that activate Wnt signaling during animal development using a Drosophila model and to use this knowledge to identify control points in the pathway susceptible to therapeutic targeting in Wnt-driven diseases.\n\nWebsite | Email | PubMed Articles | Geisel Profile\n\nalix_ashare.png\n\nAssociate Professor of Medicine, and Microbiology and Immunology\n\nOffice: Borwell 508E\n\nPhone: 603-650-5533\n\nMy research focuses on the role of lung macrophages in the development and persistence of inflammation in the lung. A major focus of my laboratory is the investigation of potential mechanisms underlying regional heterogeneity of lung inflammation in patients with inflammatory lung diseases, with an emphasis on the investigation of differences in alveolar macrophage function in patients with cystic fibrosis and asthma. Our work involves primary human immune cells isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis and asthma, as well as healthy volunteers and chronic smokers. Currently, my laboratory is particularly interested in how the lung environment impacts resident and recruited macrophage phenotype and function and how these changes in the immune cell may contribute to the non-resolving inflammation seen in patients with CF. In addition to our work in inflammatory lung diseases such as CF, we are investigating the relationship between impaired lipid homeostasis in lung macrophages and viral immunity in individuals who use electronic cigarettes.\n\nEmail | Website | PubMed\n\nMagdalena Bezanilla.jpg\n\nErnest Everett Just 1907 Professor of Biological Sciences\n\nOffice: LSC 231\n\nPhone: 603-646-2314\n\nMy research aims to understand how molecules within cells impart geometric information ultimately leading to cell shape determination.

Current studies in the lab are focused on elucidating molecular mechanisms that govern the innate immune induction of biofilm growth in the lung. Translating the laboratory's bench studies to the bedside, our team collaborates with physicians in Otolaryngology and Pulmonary Medicine to examine viral-bacterial interactions in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of patients with chronic lung disease. We use a combination of live-cell imaging, microbiological, cell biological and cutting-edge genomics approaches with the long-term goal of identifying new therapeutic targets to disrupt and/or prevent the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections that are so devastating to people with CF.\n\nEmail | PubMed Articles | Geisel Profile\n\nta_yuan_chang.png\n\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Cell Biology\n\nOffice: 304 Vail\n\nPhone: 603-646-5183\n\nAcyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) is a membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It catalyzes the formation of cholesteryl esters from cholesterol and long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A. Cholesteryl ester is the storage form of cholesterol. The first gene encoding the enzyme ACAT1 was identified in our laboratory. We have also purified this protein to homogeneity and characterized it biochemically. In many neurodegenerative diseases, the cholesterol-rich microdomains in the membranes of various cell types are disrupted. We have shown that in mouse models for Alzheimer's disease and for Niemann Pick type C disease, inactivating ACAT1 can divert the cholesterol storage pool, such that the \"mobilized cholesterol\" can repair the disrupted cholesterol-rich microdomains. Future investigations are directed to develop novel ACAT inhibitors to ameliorate Alzheimer's disease, Niemann-Pick type C disease, and atherosclerosis. We will also use biochemical and biophysical approaches to identify the active sites and regulatory sites in ACAT1 and to investigate the mechanistic consequence of inhibiting ACAT in macrophages, neurons, microglia, and astrocytes.\n\nWebsite | Email | PubMed Articles | Geisel Profile\n\nbrock_christensen.jpg\n\nProfessor of Epidemiology, and Molecular Systems Biology\n\nOffice: 660 Williamson Translational Research Building\n\nPhone: 603-650-1827\n\nDr. Christensen's research is focused on combining advances in molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics with the powerful techniques of modern epidemiology and statistics to characterize epigenetic states in human health and disease.

To study these processes, we develop technologies to trace pattern of cell divisions which recovers the lineage of each cell.

In all cells, RNAs perform a variety of functions, including synthesizing proteins. While messenger RNAs (mRNAs) provide the instructions for producing a protein, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) \"read\" the information in that message and supply the necessary amino acid building blocks. To function properly, these transfer RNAs must fold into the correct three-dimensional shape, a process that requires the RNA to be chemically modified. Owing to their high cellular abundance and stability, tRNAs have been commonly considered to be housekeeping molecules. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that tRNAs are highly regulated, and that even small changes in their abundance or their nucleotide modification levels can have profound effects, leading to aberrant translation, changes in protein expression, and disease states. The tRNA epitranscriptome and the functional tRNA pool have emerged as important regulatory layers in the translation of the human genome. However, our current understanding of the functional tRNA pool is limited. Therefore, the focus of the Orellana Lab is to study the causes and effects of tRNA dysregulation in human disease and to use this knowledge to develop tRNA-based therapeutics and diagnosis.\n\nWebsite | Email | PubMed Articles | Geisel Profile\n\nkelli_pointer_photo.jpg\n\nAssistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and Member of Dartmouth Cancer Center\n\nOffice: 662 Rubin Building\n\nDr. Pointer is a physician-scientist who completed her MD and PhD in the Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of Wisconsin. She completed her Radiation Oncology residency at the University of Chicago as a Holman Research Fellow. She joined Dartmouth as an Assistant Professor this year and is excited to be a part of the MCB program and mentor students. Dr. Kelli Pointer's research group focuses on ways to overcome radiation resistance in cancer treatments by using preclinical and translational research approaches. The main focus of her laboratory is on glioblastoma, which is the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumor. Despite combination therapy with radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery patients with glioblastoma still have poor prognoses. Her lab focuses on identifying biomarkers and pathways of radiation resistance in these tumors that can be targeted and ultimately translated into clinical practice. One focus of her lab is on mesenchymal transformation that paradoxically occurs during radiation treatment and causes resistance, including changes in the tumor microenvironment. Her lab also focuses on understanding the tumor-normal brain interface. The research in her laboratory is translational.

However, the forces that govern the composition of the gut microbiota are poorly understood. Our work focuses on a mechanistic, ecological, and evolutionary understanding of how interbacterial interactions between members of the dominant Gram-negative bacteria in the gut, the Bacteroidales, modulate the composition of the microbiota. The Bacteroidales utilize a contact-dependent toxin-delivery system known as the type VI secretion system (T6SS) to kill neighboring cells. We study the impact of this pathway on the microbiota and how bacteria adapt to defend against T6SS-mediated antagonism, using a combination of bacterial genetics, biochemistry, metagenomics, and germ-free mouse models. We are also interested in understanding why Bacteroidales abundance is depleted in individuals with cystic fibrosis, with the goal of improving health through restoration of these bacteria.\n\nEmail | Website | PubMed Articles\n\nphoto_.jpeg\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nDepartment of Medicine\n\nDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology\n\nOffice: Borwell 606W\n\nPhone: 603-650-6899\n\nOur research aims to identify how innate immune pathways drive the development of autoimmunity and contribute to disease pathogenesis.
