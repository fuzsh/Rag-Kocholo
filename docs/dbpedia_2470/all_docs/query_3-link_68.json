Franklin was born at home on Dec. 18, 1932, in Chapman Township, Snyder County, a son of the late Frank A. and Mary Jane (Arbogast) Leach. He was married to the former Vivian M. Mengle, who survives. They celebrated 62 years of marriage. He attended Arnold’s grammar schoolhouse. Franklin retired from Hempt Bros., Camp Hill, and also worked for Chapman Township and later served one term as a township supervisor. He was a member of Richfield Mennonite Church. Franklin enjoyed gardening, woodworking, camping, traveling and spending time with his family, especially his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In addition to his loving wife, Franklin is survived by one son and daughter-in-law, Donald E. and Marjorie Leach, of Mifflinburg; three grandchildren, Daniel E. Leach and his wife, Brandy, Jean L.
