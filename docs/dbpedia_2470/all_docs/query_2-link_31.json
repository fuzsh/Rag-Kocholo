Ven also co-founded the Waste Industries Full Circle Project, a charitable giving effort through which Waste Industries engages in its substantial corporate philanthropy efforts.\n\nJohn Spegal\n\nJohn is the Chief Operating Officer at Advanced Disposal. He is a recognized leader in the industry by his peers, personally engaging in many important industry initiatives. John currently serves on the National Waste and Recycling Association Board of Trustees and has been actively involved in industry wide issues that impact the association and the entire industry. In the mid 1990’s, John was instrumental in the development of a strategy for the privatization of one of the largest cities in North Carolina, which has become a model for the industry. John is also a leader in his community, founding and supporting literacy programs for solid waste drivers and volunteering with local organizations, like the Humane Society, Habitat for Humanity, and K9s for Warriors.\n\nJim VanWeelden\n\nJim retired this year from Republic Services as Senior Vice President.He is considered one of the architects of the modern waste disposal business, entering the industry at a young age, helping his father with the family disposal business. He was the original champion for being a good neighbor; it was important for landfill operators to be responsible members of the community. Jim was active in his community, too. He dedicated time to the Boys Club, coached AAU basketball teams, and is actively involved in his church.\n\nMichael Paine started with his company in 1972 working the family farm and supporting their family hauling company. With a great deal of focus and hard work, the hauling company grew and began to thrive in the 1970s. He worked on the routes during the day and then courted new customers and worked on the equipment into the evening. He became the President in 1989 and vowed to maintain the focus on customer service that put Paine’s on the map. Some 27 years later and after vast growth, Paine’s still treats each and every customer with the same care as it did 87 years ago.\n\nBill Meyer has devoted his entire professional life to the trash business. In 1974, Bill and his father purchased Able Disposal, a two-truck operation at the time, located in Chesterton, Indiana. He knew it would be an ideal place to grow his company and raise a family. Bill single-handedly built Able Disposal, growing the company into a 50-truck operation with approximately 100 employees. Able Disposal became the largest independently operated company in northwest Indiana, before it was acquired by Republic Services. Bill continued with Republic setting a mark for performance and excellence in area operations.\n\nThroughout his career, Kevin Walbridge has held senior leadership roles in the private and public sectors at National Serv-All, Waste Management, Browning-Ferris Industries, Republic Services, and Progressive Waste Solutions. Kevin serves as a member of the NWRA Board of Services Governors and currently serves on the NWRA Board of Trustees. He has also served as Chairman of Environmental Research and Education Foundation. He was one of the ﬁrst advocates for the use of alternative fuels to power our waste and recycling trucks and is a tireless advocate for industry safety.\n\nLast year, our industry lost one of its giants when Charles Walton, founder of Wastequip, passed away at the age of 83. Chuck Walton was a visionary in the waste industry because he recognized the opportunity to consolidate the fragmented waste equipment manufacturing sector of the waste industry. Walton invested his life savings, combining it with $10 million he raised from venture capital ﬁrms in Cleveland, to found Wastequip in 1989. During his nearly 20 years with Wastequip, Walton completed 24 acquisitions and started 4 businesses.\n\nThomas K. Blackman\n\nTom Blackman began his career in 1966 throwing cans for his father’s company in Santa Ana, California. After the family business eventually became part of Waste Management, Inc., Tom rose through the ranks and led Waste Management’s operations in eight Western states. Tom’s heart was always in California, where he eventually returned to start Metropolitan Waste Disposal, now CalMet, with his partner and fellow Hall of Fame enshrinee, Art Kazarian. Tom’s visionary leadership led to advances in e-Waste recycling, green waste processing and the deployment of wide-scale CNG trucks. In 2014, after a valiant battle, we lost Tom to cancer. However, his legacy lives on by the example he set as a family man, as a leader in his industry and community, as a partner and as a friend.\n\nGeorge Fink\n\nGeorge Fink retired in 2014 after 41 years with Volvo Construction Equipment of North America. George started in the business at the age of 14 picking up trash at the local drive-in movie theater. With that early job, the seeds were planted for George’s career interest in waste management, and, of course, having the proper equipment. Under George’s visionary leadership, Volvo has become a major supplier to the waste industry. George is legendary for his focus on customers and colleagues and his private motto: “It is what it is, do what’s right.” Throughout his career as a valued partner to the waste industry, his focus has not only been on delivering productive and cost-effective solutions, George has also been a tireless advocate for safety.\n\nGarry E. Mosier\n\nFor decades, Garry Mosier has pioneered and advanced safety in our industry. Whether he is serving on national standards and steering committees in his work at continuous improvement of safety systems and technologies, or building world-class safety programs and cultures at leading waste companies, his focus on continuous improvement is legendary. Many may know Garry for the “Garbage Gus” campaign targeting child safety. As Garry says, if one child was kept safe thanks to Garbage Gus, all the effort was worth it. For 24 years, Garry was a regional group safety director for Waste Management, Inc., until he took on the challenge of building the safety program at Republic Services, Inc. for 12 years. He is now Vice President of Operations for Alliance Wireless Technologies, a leader in vehicle electronic safety technology. His commitment to innovation and advancement of our industry is reflected not only by his career accomplishments, but also in his ongoing work in developing the patented technologies for Alliance Wireless’ 3rd Eye Cam driver enhancement technology.\n\nBruce Ranck\n\nThe history of the waste and recycling industry over the past 40-plus years could have been much different without Bruce Ranck’s vision and leadership. He started in the business in college, and over a career that has spanned more than 45 years and ultimately led to being Chief Executive Officer of BFI. Bruce is truly an industry icon, and three words are often used to describe Bruce’s career: “Integrity” “Pioneer” and “People.” Early on, he made safety a priority, championing frequent training, ongoing education and advancement, especially for front-line employees. He pioneered many areas that are hallmarks of our industry today: recycling, landfill-gas-to-energy technologies and modern medical waste systems. His pioneering of standardizations for safety were credited with substantial reductions in injuries and accidents during his tenure set the pace for the entire industry and are standard practices today.\n\nIzzie Abrams\n\nIzzie Abrams, has held numerous positions in the waste industry since 1972 in both the United States and Canada, including Canadian Waste Services, Dual Removal Systems, and Triwaste Services, which whom was the founder and President of. Izzie has been involved in industry organizations throughout his entire career, including the National Solid Wastes Management Association, Environmental Industries Research and Education Foundation, Detachable Container Association and the Ontario Waste Management Association (OWMA) and served on their organizational Boards. Izzie is also the past chair of the NSWMA Haulers Association and past Chair and Secretary/Treasurer of OWMA. In his “free time,” Izzie has a dedicated record of service to the Beth Tzedec Congregation and Foundation, the United Way of Toronto, United Jewish Appeal, Ben Gurion University and other groups.\n\nCharles C. Appleby\n\nCharlie Appleby is one of the founding organizers of Advanced Disposal Services at its inception in 2000 and serves as the company’s chairman and chief executive officer. As part of the company’s management team, he has grown the business to become the largest privately-held solid waste business in the United States and the 4th largest overall. Under his leadership, the company grew from a 3-truck operation to operating in 17 states and the Bahamas with 91 collection operations, 42 landfills, 25 recycling facilities and 72 transfer stations. In addition to his waste-industry background, Charlie retired after 31-years of military service, as a Colonel in the Florida Army National Guard, who was selected for promotion to Brigadier General. During this period, he received numerous decorations and achievements, including the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, the Florida Cross, Senior Parachutist, Ranger and Pathfinder awards. At the 2013 NW&RA Executive Roundtable Conference, Charlie was awarded the elite Distinguished Eagle Scott Award by the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nTom Brown\n\nTom Brown’s 35-year career in the waste and recycling industry began at Waste Management. Steadily rising the ladder at WM, Tom climbed to Regional President of the Western Carolinas and East Tennessee regions before joining IESI in 1997 and supervising its growth into the third largest solid waste company in North America. Tom continued to rise, becoming President and COO of Progressive Waste Solutions before his retirement. Tom also has been a dedicated servant to the industry, chairing the National Solid Wastes Management Association’s Texas Chapter chair for 10 years and served on an advisory committee for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. He was instrumental in preserving free choice for waste industry customers in Dallas, leading the industry’s fight against flow control as head of the Dallas Flow Control Task Force and then in federal court. He earned the NSWMA Special Governor’s Award in 2009 and was recognized as NSWMA’s Member of the Year in 2011 for his leadership relating to the Dallas flow control issue.\n\nJohn M. Curotto\n\nWith 31 years in service to the waste industry, John Curotto is now president of The Curotto Can Company in Sonoma, California. As a fourth-generation waste hauler now leading his family business John will tell you it’s easy to get sidetracked on neat engineering, or employee engagement—or any of the myriad distractions in business—but that the folks at The Curotto Can are focused on making a product to exceed customers’ expectations. Working alongside his father, John Senior, John was instrumental in developing his company into the nation’s largest single automation collection system, resulting in increased efficiency and worker safety and reduced contamination for a cleaner product. He has been a leader both in service and innovation. John was instrumental in the industry’s adoption of the Automated Front Loader. Additionally, John has offered his service to the National Waste & Recycling Association Future Industry Leaders Alliance, the National Waste and Recycling Supplier Advisory Board, DCA, CRRC and EREF. He has also served in leadership positions with the WASTEC Strategic Planning Committee and the National Waste & Recycling Association Suppliers Advisory Board.\n\nJoseph Garbarino\n\nJoseph Garbarino has dedicated an incredible 65 years to the waste and recycling industry. Today he is Chairman of the Board and Co-Owner of Marin Sanitary Service in San Rafael, California, but Joseph has wielded a heavy hand in helping shape the face of the modern waste industry. He is credited with developing several technological improvements for refuse trucks and waste facilities, but perhaps most notably, he developed the nation’s first countywide residential curbside recycling program and opened the country’s first curbside Materials Recovery Facility in 1980. Today, MRFs are an indispensible component in managing America’s waste streams. He has also been a leader on the renewable energy front, partnering with the Central Marin Sanitation Agency to use food waste in anaerobic digestion systems to generate electricity and increase landfill waste diversion to 75 percent. Joseph’s service to his community includes serving on the Marin County Waste Management Committee and dedicating space at Marin’s recycling facility to educational efforts, hosting 2,500 schoolchildren and community group members each year. Joseph is a decorated professional, receiving the John P. Moscone Award from the California Refuse Removal Council in 2004, the Governor’s Environmental Economic Leadership award in 2008, and the “Heroes of Marin” innovation award from Pacific Sun in 2012.\n\nMarvin Goldenberg\n\nMarvin Goldenberg was founder, owner, president, and CEO of Trucks and Parts of Tampa. He founded the company in the 1970s but draws his roots in the industry back to the company he started in Indiana in 1950. Marvin’s induction to the Hall of Fame is backed by his foresightedness on two major industry fronts. First, Marvin emphasized “being green” long before “being green” was a thing. He hated the term “junk yard” and was among the first to make an effort to manage waste and contaminants. He was rewarded for these efforts with a National Beautification Award for business, which he received from Lady Bird Johnson in 1966, and he was also recognized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the state of Florida for an emphasis on safety and the environment. Secondly, but equally importantly, Marvin recognized the value of sustainably managing older vehicle fleets, and he raised the bar on both the refurbishing and marketing of used refuse trucks. It’s not a stretch to say he is the father of the rental waste collection truck industry, and he helped build his company into the industry leader.\n\nRichard Van Hattem\n\nRichard Van Hattem planted seeds that both grew into successful business ventures and changed the course of the waste industry for the better. He founded the one-truck operation National Scavenger Service in Chicago in 1972, and it became one of the region’s largest independent haulers until its combination with Allied Waste Services in the 1990s. Recognizing the value of recycling, Rich built a Materials Recovery Facility next to a Chicago transfer station, helping better manage the community’s needs and waste stream simultaneously. The merger of NSS and Allied Waste was one of the first instances of vertical integration of landfill, transfer station and collection assets in the company’s history and served as a model for future growth and acquisitions. As Allied Waste grew into the country’s second-largest waste company, Rich held a series of increasingly senior positions, eventually earning the position of Vice President of Governmental Affairs before his retirement in 2006. Rich also was active in the Environmental Industry Associations, serving as a member of the Board of Trustees for nearly 10 years. An active member of the NSWMA Illinois Chapter, he received the NSWMA Distinguished Service Award in 2003 and has served as a mentor to many of the industry leaders, including some current CEOs.\n\nEllen Harvey\n\nWhen Ellen Harvey joined E.L. Harvey & Sons in 1989, she already had a long history of designing and developing corporate educational programs starting with a B.A. degree in Education and a M.A. degree in Education Administration. At E.L. Harvey, she became the Executive Vice President of Public Relations, working with local, regional, and national media to favorably promote her company and the waste management industry. As an NSWMA member, she designed and implemented the “Waste 101 Program” gaining national recognition for building the industry’s image. Ellen received a Special Governor’s Award in 1994 for this program. In 2006, she received a Distinguished Service Award for founding and organizing the EIA Women’s Council, serving for two terms as Chair, and helping to build a place for women in the industry.\n\nGary Hater\n\nA recurring theme in Gary Hater’s career is a unique ability to acquire knowledge from a wide variety of fields, bring that knowledge into the waste industry, and create full-scale applications that protect the environment, are innovative, and make good business sense. He has ten patents ranging from biodegradation systems, treatment methods for contaminated soil, gas collection operations at bioreactors, and unique anaerobic composters. As a Senior Director at Waste Management, he has partnered with university solid waste management researchers and served on a variety of government research and development committees at the state and federal levels. Gary was a critical player in questioning U.S. EPA test methods for determining methane emissions from solid waste facilities.\n\nArt Kazarian\n\nIn the 1940s, at the age of six, Art Kazarian entered the family recycling business rolling over-issue newsprint for sale to flower shops. By the 1960s, he was collecting and selling fiber to paper mills and by the 1980s, he had built wastepaper recycling operations in California, Texas, Hawaii, Arizona, Oregon, Washington, and Georgia. Art developed the first privately-owned transfer station in Orange County, California in 1982 and later, on a handshake and cocktail napkin, developed a transfer station in Downtown Los Angeles with Waste Management, Inc. He formed a joint venture, Mottra Corp., with Tom Blackman, Jr. in the early 1990s and expanded ownership to waste collection, disposal, and recycling facilities, including organics recycling facilities, C & D diversion operation, electronics recycling business, and medical waste management company.\n\nBill Wilkerson\n\nBill Wilkerson has made significant contributions toward the development of the solid waste industry’s first solar compactor and is a leading expert in the application and calculation of return on investment of compactors and balers. His experience as a high school football coach for 10 years before working for Marathon Equipment Co. provided him with unique sales and management skills. He quickly moved from a Regional Sales Manager to his current position as Vice President of Sales for Marathon Equipment Co. and Bayne Premium Lifters, part of the Environmental Solutions Group. Bill served two terms as Chair of WASTEC from 2007 to 2012 and was named Member of the Year in 2009. He has been instrumental as a participant on WASTEC’s Z245 Subcommittees on Balers, Mobile Equipment, Compactors, and Facilities.\n\nDon Williamson\n\nDon Williamson started his waste industry career in 1979 helping a friend collect waste on Saturdays while in college. Soon after, he became President of the company building it from 50 customers to more than 40,000 customers and 50 trucks. He has been a leader in the waste industry showing small hauling companies how to survive. As a regular presenter at WasteExpo, he has shared his knowledge. In 1995, when a large national company came to Minnesota and eliminated seven out of eight small companies, Don managed to survive and the large company moved out. In the process, he nearly doubled the size of his company. Don has served on the NSWMA Board of Governor’s since the 1980s, including serving as the Minnesota Chapter Representative and Chair of the Board. At the end of 2012, he stepped down from the EIA Board of Trustees after five years of service.\n\nLee Brandsma\n\nIn 1973, Lee Brandsma entered the waste industry as a residential and commercial route driver for his father-in-law at Groot Industries and became the Chief Operating Officer in 1980 at the age of 26. Brandsma and his partner, Larry Groot, built the company from 20 trucks and 35 employees to more than 400 trucks and 650 employees, from 2 to 5 operating locations, 4 transfer stations, and a single-stream materials recovery facility (MRF). They also own a materials transport business and a mobile document destruction operation. Groot Industries started the first curbside recycling program in northern Illinois in 1986, the first single-stream MRF in the Midwest in 1997, and was the first to run its entire fleet on biodiesel in 2007. In 2009, working with Mack Trucks, the first 20 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles came off the production line and Groot Industries built and operated a CNG fueling station open to the public that same year. In the last 3 years, the company has received awards from the Illinois Recycling Association, Clean Cities Coalition, and the Energy Solutions Center. Brandsma served as the NSWMA Illinois Chapter chair from 1985 to 1987, chair of NSWMA’s Waste Haulers Council from 1987 to 1989, vice-chair of NSWMA from 1992 to 1993, and chair of EIA from 1994 to 1996. He was a board member of the NSWMA Foundation now the independent Environmental Research and Education Foundation from 1994 to 2000.\n\nSusan Eppes\n\nIn 1991, Susan Eppes joined Browning-Ferris Industries as a Manager for Safety and Loss Control Services designing and developing award-winning safety and health training videos, modifying facility design elements to reduce accidents and injuries, and managing technical loss control support at landfills, medical waste processing facilities, and recycling operations. By 1997, she had moved up to become the Director of Safety and Health for 400 solid waste locations, 100 landfills, 30 medical waste facilities, and 98 recycling plants across the U.S. She held the same position for Recycle America at Waste Management, Inc. from 2000 to 2002 establishing health and safety program goals, evaluating program implementation, serving as the principal corporate resource for federal and state legislative and regulatory safety issues, and representing the company on safety matters before official government proceedings. In 2002, Eppes founded her own health and safety consulting firm, EST Solutions, providing services in ergonomics, OSHA and DOT compliance, fleet safety, processing equipment review, and start-up safety. Eppes is currently chair of WASTEC’s full ANSI Z245 Committee and also chair of the subcommittees on MRFs and transfer stations. She helped develop NSWMA’s “Be Safe, Be Proud” safety videos and is updating NSWMA’s Safety Manual. She regularly presents at WasteExpo and other conferences and has written numerous articles on safety.\n\nGeorge Fennell\n\nGeorge Fennell founded Fennell Container Company in 1973 and built the business from a barn on a dirt lot with one employee to become the largest privately-owned, solid waste company in South Carolina. The company operated the first, privately-held transfer station. Over the years, Fennell created several other companies, including Fenn-Vac, Inc. in 1983 to manage industrial and hazardous waste; Fennell Waste Systems, Inc. in 1991 providing collection services in upstate South Carolina; and, with industry partners, ECO Services of Memphis in 1991 and ECO Services of South Carolina in 1993. In 1995, Fennell merged his companies with Republic Industries and then helped merge and acquire many other companies. In 2002, he re-entered ownership in the waste industry with his son, Scott, and started Carolina Waste & Recycling LLC, now the largest commercial collection firm in the Charleston market. In 2008, he opened a landfill under the company name Carolina Landfill LLC for industrial waste and, in 2009, built a new transfer and recycling station, Carolina Processing & Recycling LLC. In 2011, Fennell was named Lowcountry Philanthropist of the Year and has served on the boards of many organizations, including the Detachable Container Association, South Carolina Trucking Association, NSWMA, Charleston County Solid Waste Advisory Commission, and Executive Association of Greater Charleston.\n\nDwight Schaubach\n\nDwight Schaubach, Chairman and CEO of Bay Disposal & Recycling, Inc., started Feather-n-Fin, a chicken and seafood restaurant, in 1969. Having experienced difficulty in getting the restaurant trash collected, he launched Bay Disposal in 1975, which grew into one of the largest private hauling companies in Virginia before it was sold in 1989. Schaubach started the first medical waste treatment company in Virginia in 1985, helping to write the initial medical waste regulations for the state. Incendere, with one incinerator, ultimately grew to collecting medical waste from Florida to New York while tripling its incinerator capacity. Schaubach got back into the solid waste business with Area Container. He was also a partner of ECO Services of South Carolina. Early in 1996, Area Container, ECO, and Incendere were merged into Republic Industries. In 2000, Schaubach took advantage of the name Bay Disposal, which now includes two MRFs and a soon-to-be-opened recycling facility. Bay Disposal & Recycling is, once again, one of the largest, independently-owned, waste companies in Virginia. He also owns a significant portion of a 64-acre construction and demolition landfill in Virginia Beach. Schaubach has served as president of both the Detachable Container Association and NSWMA’s Virginia Waste Industries Association. He was named Entrepreneur of the Year for 2011 by Old Dominion University. In addition, he has generously supported, with both his time and resources, numerous civic and charitable organizations over the years.\n\nBruce J. Parker\n\nOver the years, Bruce J. Parker has held a number of positions at the Environmental Industry Associations (EIA), starting as in-house counsel in 1981 and becoming General Counsel in 1985. In 1992, Parker’s position expanded to include Deputy for Policy Development and Implementation and, in 1994, Executive Vice-President for Federal Legislative and External Affairs. In 1997, EIA’s Board of Trustees unanimously appointed Parker to President and Chief Executive Officer of EIA and Executive Vice-President of NSWMA. After a 30-year career, he will retire at the end of 2012. During his tenure as CEO, Parker worked with members to develop a strategic plan to create a more stable financial organization, increase the association’s presence at the national and state levels, and enhance the industry’s image with the media, all of which were successfully accomplished. Parker has testified on behalf of the association before Congressional committees and state legislatures. He has written many articles on key issues ranging from unfair competition to global warming, recycling, and sustainability.
