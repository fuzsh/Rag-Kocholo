        "text": "Thomas L. Leach, age 83, of Marshall passed away Sunday, September 17, 2017 in Kalamazoo, MI surrounded by his loving family. He was born January 24, 1934 in Homer, MI the son of George and Ruth (Kenyon) Leach. Thomas was a graduate of Homer High School, class of ‘52. During his senior year, he was awarded the Athlete of the Year Award playing football, baseball, track and basketball. The day he graduated, Thomas took his final test in the morning and by noon he was working at Permabilt Manufactured Homes. He worked his way up in the company to Vice President of Operations. Thomas retired in 1999 after 47 years of employment. During his employment with Permabilt, he was drafted in the United States Army, proudly serving as a Corporal and Paratrooper from 1953 to 1955. While at a dance hall with their friends, Thomas was introduced to Margaret Bowers. They were married in Litchfield, MI on October 22, 1955. Thomas assisted in several community projects. He helped build the Homer Football press box as well as the Marshall Postal Museum. Thomas was a true outdoorsman. He enjoyed fishing and was always up to go out in the boat. He also enjoyed hunting deer, pheasants, and racoons. Thomas grew up on his mother and father’s farm, milking cows before he went to school. He even rented out to a neighboring farmer by the week. After he was married, they resided on several other farms, doing chores for part of the rent. Thomas started farming heavily with his son Doug, while he was employed with Permabilt. They would be working sometimes until 2:00am because he didn’t want his son working alone that late. Thomas was a hard worker. He loved his garden, it was his pride and joy. He also enjoyed bowling and playing cards.\n\nLeft to cherish his memory is his loving wife, Margaret of 61 years; children, Kim (Lori) Leach of Grand Ledge, MI, Douglas (Anne) Leach of Homer, MI, Mary Ann (Clint) Lovell of Delton, MI, Matt Leach of Marshall, MI; 7 grandchildren; 3 great-grandchildren; 6 step-grandchildren; 10 step-great-grandchildren; brother, Michael (Shirley) Leach; sisters, Patricia (Verser) White and Kathleen (Tony) VanDenberg. He was preceded in death by his parents and brother, Curtis Leach.\n\nFamily will receive friends at the Craig K. Kempf Family Funeral Homes, Marshall Chapel on Thursday, September 21, 2017 from 2:00pm to 4:00pm & 6:00pm to 8:00pm. A funeral service will be held at the funeral home at 1:30pm on Friday, September 22, 2017 with Celebrant Jacob Washburn officiating. Memorial contributions may be directed to American Alzheimer’s Association. back to top"
