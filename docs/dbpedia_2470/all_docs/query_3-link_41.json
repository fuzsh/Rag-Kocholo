        "text": "Curtis was born and raised in Boulder County, and except for attending college and graduate school out of state, he has lived and worked in Boulder County all his life. Curtis became interested in a career in public safety while in high school serving as a volunteer cadet with the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nAfter graduating from Fairview High School, he attended the University of Puget Sound where he completed a Bachelor of Arts in American Politics and Government, with a minor in Communication. After Curtis graduated from the University of Puget Sound, he enrolled at The American University in Washington DC, where he completed a Master of Arts in Public Administration with an emphasis in Law Enforcement Management.\n\nIn 1993, Curtis returned to Boulder, where he began his career with the Boulder Police Department. He served in a variety of progressively responsible roles during his 27 years with the department, including Patrol Officer, Detective, Patrol Sergeant, Professional Standards Supervisor, Commander, and Deputy Chief. In February of 2021, Curtis had the opportunity to join the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office as a Division Chief.\n\nCurtis Johnson was elected to Boulder County Sheriff in November 2022, and sworn into office in January 2023, for a four-year term.\n\nSheriff Joe Pelle is a Colorado native, growing up in Boulder. He has 43 years of public safety experience and has served 5 terms, (20 yrs.), as the elected Sheriff of Boulder County. Joe became interested in a police career at an early age and was a member of the Sheriff’s Explorer Post as a teenager. In January of 1980 he went to work full time as a deputy sheriff. He then led a long career at the Sheriff’s Office and Boulder Police Department holding progressively responsible positions in various assignments, until he ran for sheriff in 2002 and took office in January 2003.\n\nJoe has a Master’s Degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Colorado, and a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice with a minor in Public Administration from Metropolitan State College. He has attained numerous professional certifications.\n\nSheriff Pelle has led a full-service public safety agency of approximately 450 employees and hundreds of volunteers through 20 years of change and challenges. There have been major improvements in facilities, staffing, training, and equipment over the course of those years. The department and the community have been especially challenged with natural disasters including several major fires and a historic flood. We have weathered those well and have had tremendous community support.\n\nSheriff Pelle is most proud of the establishment of “Character First” as the working motto and bulwark of the Mission and Vision statement of the Sheriff’s Office.\n\nJoe has been married to his wife Stephanie for the past 43 years. He has two grown-married children and 4 grandchildren in the area. He is looking forward to his retirement which becomes official January 10, 2023. He is looking forward to spending a lot of time with his family and hobbies.\n\nWas elected Sheriff in 1990, having stepped forward as a candidate on the Democratic Party’s ticket following Brad Leach’s decision to retire. He was re-elected in 1994 and 1998.\n\nGeorge moved with his family to Boulder, from Michigan in 1951. As a child George delivered the Daily Camera, his route included the Court House. “I vividly remember taking the elevator up to the fifth floor and slipping the evening paper through the bars of the jail for Sheriff Everson”.\n\nHe attended Boulder High School, and graduated from the University of Colorado in 1971 with a bachelor’s degree in Sociology.\n\nGeorge started as a jail deputy in 1972, in less than a year was promoted to detective. He worked through the ranks serving as detective sergeant, patrol lieutenant, captain of detectives, patrol, and the jail division.\n\nWas the first Democrat to hold the position in nearly two generations. He moved quickly to restore confidence in the organization, and gradually earned the public’s trust. He was re-elected to four subsequent terms before retiring in 1990.\n\nBrad was 29 years old at the time and had six years of experience in law enforcement. He was a Boulder Police officer, but had to resign to run for sheriff. He worked in the District Attorney’ Office as Chief Investigator, and prior to that, had worked as a patrol deputy for the Adams County Sheriff’s Office. He started his career with the Boulder Police Department as a member of the “Special Police” in their Reserve organization.\n\nJoined the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office in 1963 as a “jailer”, having had prior experience in law enforcement. Born in Lindsey, Nebraska, in 1907, he became a charter member of the Nebraska Highway Patrol in 1937. There after, he served as chief of Police in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, and as a deputy with the Scottsbluff County Sheriff’s Department.\n\nSupported by the retiring Art Everson, he was elected to the Office of Sheriff in 1966 on the Republican ticket.\n\nMarvin Nelson was defeated after one term, following his defeat, Marvin Nelson served as deputy U.S. Marshal and worked as a private investigator and salesman.\n\nHe died in Boulder in 1982, and is buried in St. Edward, Nebraska.\n\nWas born in Northwood, Iowa, and moved with his family to Longmont in 1917. He was employed with George Richart’s trucking company when Richart was elected Sheriff in 1932, and was appointed as deputy shortly after Richart took office. Arthur ran for Sheriff in 1942 as a Republican following Sheriff Richart’s retirement.\n\nWhen Everson took office in January 1943, he inherited an organization starved by Depression-era economics and depleted by the demands of a nation at war. He holds the distinction of having served as Sheriff longer (24 years) than anyone else in the organization’s history.\n\nThe Theresa Foster Homicide Case, sparked the need for improved techniques and training in forensics. Sheriff Everson and Boulder Police Chief Myron Teegarden established the “Boulder Crime School” in 1949.\n\nIn 1966, after serving the citizens of Boulder County for 34 years Sheriff Everson retired from law enforcement.\n\nHe died in 1984 and is buried in Longmont’s Mountain View Cemetery.\n\nWas born on the family farm near Niwot, as a young man he worked in the coal and feed business, and then established a trucking firm. A solid reputation led to his selection as President of the Colorado State of Independent Truckmen’s Association.\n\nSheriff Richart took the reins of the Sheriff Office during the depths of the Depression, also like his predecessor, enforcing Prohibition constituted a significant part of his job. With Boulder County’s population reaching 35,000 Sheriff Richart appointed several “special deputies”, the forerunners of the Sheriff’s Posse of the 1960’s and the present day Sheriff’s Reserve.\n\nSheriff Richart served five two year terms, and then retired to Longmont, where he entered the real estate business with his son-in-law. He also served as Longmont’s Mayor from 1948-1949.\n\nAfter the death of Margaret Ann Richart on 13 March 1964, George married Mildred Louise Knaus Norrish on 24 October 1965. Mildred still lives in Longmont.\n\nGeorge and his first wife Margaret are buried in Longmont’s Mountain View Cemetery.\n\nThe election of 1922 was hotly contested, there were six announced candidates, including Sheriff Euler and two of his deputies. Robert V. Blum, a native of Longmont and prominent local businessman, was prevailed upon by the Democratic Party to run for Sheriff. In addition to his occupation as a clothier and president of the Commonwealth Industrial Bank, Blum served at various times as president of the Chamber of Commerce, Chief of Longmont’s Fire Department, and president of the local school board.\n\nIn 1926, Sheriff Blum and his deputies conducted more than 300 raids and liquor investigations, and never carried a weapon on duty. By 1927 the Office had a staff of six deputies.\n\nSheriff Blum stood for re-election to an unprecedented sixth term in 1932, but was defeated by Republican George Richart. He returned to Longmont and was selected to represent Boulder County in the State Legislature.\n\nHe died in Long Beach, CA. in 1956. Mr. Blum and his wife Kate are buried in Longmont’s Mountain View Cemetery.\n\nA Longmont druggist and member of the firm of Capp and McCreery, was elected to office in 1908. Sheriff Capp was undoubtedly a busy man. A decision by the county’s electorate in 1907 to enact a local ban on the sale, production and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages (3.2 beer being excepted) went into effect in 1909, anticipating national Prohibition by seven years. More significantly, a protracted coal miner’s strike (1910-1914) put hundreds of local miners out of work and was the source of much tension and violence.\n\nEvidently having had his fill of the violence, Sheriff Capp chose not to run for re-election, and retired to private life.\n\nTragically, he was accidentally killed in Boulder Canyon in 1927, trying to save a young man who had come into contact with a high voltage power line.\n\nWas born in New Sharon, Maine where his father Zachariah served six years as Franklin County’s undersheriff and six years as sheriff.\n\nWarren Dyer prospected briefly in the Black Hills of Dakota Territory in 1877 before moving on to Hastings, Nebraska, where he was appointed Adams County’s undersheriff. In 1880 he re-located to Breckenridge, Co. and resumed his prospecting, and served as Summit County undersheriff for two years. After a brief stay in Denver, Warren and wife Mollie relocated to Lyons and served as town alderman until he was elected Sheriff in 1893 on the “People’s Party” ticket.\n\nSubsequent to his service as sheriff Mr. Dyer served as magistrate of Boulder’s “Police Court” and became a local real estate developer.\n\nHe and his Wife are buried in Boulder’s Columbia Cemetery.\n\nHe was elected Sheriff in 1863, but absented himself from office in order to take a Captain’s commission with the Third Colorado Volunteer Cavalry, called upon by Territorial Governor John Evans in 1864 to suppress Indian uprisings. In his capacity as Captain of Company D, Nichols participated in the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, on November 29, 1864.\n\nFollowing his return, Nichols was elected to the Territorial Legislature, and was forced to give up his position as Sheriff. He served two non-consecutive terms in the Legislature and was instrumental in bringing the University of Colorado to Boulder.\n\nHe served as Lieutenant Governor from 1893-1895 and was a member of the Board of Commissioners for the Colorado State Penitentiary for 19 years.\n\nWilliam A. Corson was appointed the first Sheriff of Boulder County by Territorial Governor William Gilpin following the establishment of the Territory of Colorado in 1861. Drawn to the area by the reports of the discovery of gold, William Corson soon found that the value of the gold extracted was exceeded by the labor invested, and he eventually settled upon ranching in the Boulder Valley as his principal occupation.\n\nState records also reflect the fact that in 1865, William Corson served as the clerk of a company of volunteer Colorado Cavalry. County records indicate that he served as County Assessor in 1864 and as the Clerk and Recorder from 1867-1870."
