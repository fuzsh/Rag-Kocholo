        "text": "Transcription of obituary published in the Minutes of Conference\n\nFRANK LEACH: born in Oldham in 1896 in humble circumstances; the hard life of his early days quickened in him a lively concern for social righteousness and justice. He served in the Army in the First World War, but having been discharged on medical grounds he worked in Germany for two years with the Y.M.C.A., ministering to the material and spiritual needs of the soldiers. On return to civilian life he volunteered for further service with the Y.M.C.A., but another call came to the Christian Ministry, in the Primitive Methodist Church.\n\nOn his acceptance Mr Leach was sent to Hartley College, thereafter beginning his ministry in South Wales. Among the circuits in which he subsequently worked mention must be made of the Durham Coast; from this circuit two men, having been greatly influenced by Mr Leach, entered the Ministry. In the Durham Coast Circuit, and in others, he was involved in amalgamation and rebuilding schemes, tasks to which he gave himself with zest and joy. In his last circuit, Morley, Mr Leach is remembered as a friendly and homely man and one whose preaching still proclaimed the social Gospel as he had learned it and preached it in his early days. From Morley also comes the recollection of one who greatly encouraged his young colleagues.\n\nOn his retirement in 1960 he returned to the Shaw and Royton Circuit and later went to live in his native Oldham. It was whilst on his way to an appointment that he met with an accident; after some weeks in hospital he seemed to have made sufficient recovery as to be ready to return home, but there was a change for the worse and death came on 10 April 1969 in the seventy-third year of his age and the forty-seventh of his ministry.\n\nFamily\n\nFrank was born on 12 May 1895 at Oldham, Lancashire, to parents James, a cotton mule minder (1911), and Elizabeth Alice.\n\nAt the time of the 1911 census Frank was working as a cotton mule piecer.\n\nHe married Maggie Hill (1899-1956) in the summer of 1926 at Oldham, Lancashire.\n\nFrank died on 10 April 1969 at Oldham, Lancashire.\n\nCircuits\n\n1920 Derby II\n\n1921 Hartley\n\n1923 Docking\n\n1924 Leytonstone\n\n1926 E London Mission\n\n1928 Blackwood\n\n1931 Aberavon\n\n1933 Presteign\n\n1936 Chesterfield\n\n1939 Newcastle, Staffs\n\n1942 Burton, Parker\n\n1945 Horden\n\n1946 Durham Coast\n\n1948 Goole, Carlisle Terrace\n\n1949 Workington\n\n1954 Morley Ebenezer\n\n1958 Morley\n\n1960 Shaw (Sup)\n\nMethodist Minutes 1969/204\n\nW Leary, Directory of Primitive Methodist Ministers and their Circuits, 1990\n\nCensus Returns and Births, Marriages & Deaths Registers"
