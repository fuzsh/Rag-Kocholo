Minnesota ex rel. Olson, County Attorney, 283 U.S. 697 (1931,) with Associate Justice Pierce Butler, a Minnesotan, dissenting. George Leach served as mayor during a period of popularity of the Ku Klux Klan in Minnesota and he was a target for their ire and that of the Citizens' Alliance, the Committee of Thirteen, and the American Protective League because of his opposition to the installation of a large electropower dam across the Mississippi River in an attempt to entice the Ford Motor Company from building an assembly plant in St. Paul, his appointment of a Roman Catholic as his secretary, his having once dined with the Knights of Columbus, his prohibition of Minneapolis police officers from joining the Klan, and his investigation of Klan activities at the University of Minnesota.
