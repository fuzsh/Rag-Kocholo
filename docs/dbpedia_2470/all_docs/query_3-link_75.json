        "text": "George S. “Bud” Richards passed away on May 14, 2017, in his home with his wife Dorothy, their five children and other family members at his side. Memorial services will be held in both Arizona and Iowa. Service details are pending.\n\nGeorge is survived by Dorothy, his wife of 66 years; his sister, Ilah Mae Raaz, of Grand Terrace, Calif.; daughter, Georgia (Tom) Tucker of Windermere, Fla.; son, Marshall of Phoenix, Ariz.; daughter, Vicki (Chris) Meinecke of Maquoketa, Iowa; daughter, Kimberly (Scott) Woodruff of Kansas City, Mo.; son, Mark (Cyndi) of Mooresville, N.C.; his brother-in-law, Dr. Edwin Running of Arvada, Colo.; 10 grandchildren; 11 great-grandchildren; and eight nieces. He was preceded in death by his parents, George and Ida Richards; his parents-in-law, Edwin and Margaret Running; brother-in-law, Quentin Raaz and niece, Barbara (Raaz) Leach.\n\nGeorge was born November 11, 1929 in Carroll, Iowa. He was the younger of George E. Richards and Ida Kehoe’s two children, growing up with this sister, Ilah Mae Raaz, in Jefferson, Iowa. He graduated from Jefferson High School in 1947, and attended Upper Iowa University where he was a member of the football, basketball and track teams. He excelled in all sports and was coached by the legendary Dr. John “Doc” Dorman, who coached at Upper Iowa for over 50 years. It was also during this time as a college student athlete, that George met Dorothy Running of Oelwein, Iowa. They were married on New Year’s Day in 1951.\n\nFollowing college graduation in May, 1951, George began his coaching career in Farmersburg, Iowa, coaching all sports at this Clayton County school. This experience was followed by head high school football coaching positions at Fayette, New Hampton and Estherville. George served as Upper Iowa University’s head basketball coach and assistant football coach from 1960-61. He concluded his football coaching career as the Upper Iowa head football coach from 1974 to 1976, accepting no compensation, wanting only to give back to the institution that provided him so many great opportunities. George and his son, Marshall, are both members of the Upper Iowa University Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\nGeorge and Dorothy purchased an independent insurance agency in Fayette, Iowa in 1962, and spent the next 30 years raising their family, involving themselves in their children’s activities in school and sports and enjoying small town Iowa life. George especially enjoyed woodworking, golfing with friends and spending time at their cabin on the Mississippi River, where the family enjoyed boating, swimming, water skiing, fishing and good times with friends. They sold the insurance business in 1990 and moved to Park City, Utah, and then to Phoenix, Arizona in 2004, continuing to enjoy their growing extended family and new friends.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to either of these organizations: George Richards Endowment Football Fund, Upper Iowa University, P.O. Box 1857, Fayette, IA 52142 or Aegis Homecare, 2304 E. Geneva Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282."
