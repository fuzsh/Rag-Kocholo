        "text": "Leach History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nThe name Leach is rooted in the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture. It is a name for someone who worked as a doctor. Throughout the Middle Ages, doctors were known as \"leaches\" as the practice of bleeding sick people was the generally accepted manner of curing them. There are countless people in the Middle Ages who died thanks to the common cold; not because the virus killed them, but because they bled to death on the advice of their physicians. Bleeding was accomplished by placing a dozen or so leaches on the person who was ill so that they could remove the poisons that were making them ill, hence the name \"leach\" for the occupation of doctor. It is small wonder that illness was so feared in the medieval period; many people died from illnesses that would not have otherwise killed them because their doctors were weakening them through loss of blood.\n\nSince the 1970s, Hirudo medicinalis, better known as the European medicinal leech has been routinely used to drain blood after reconstructive surgery, particularly in finger reattachment and reconstructive surgery of the ear, nose, lip, and eyelid.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Leach family\n\nThe surname Leach was first found in Oxfordshire where the earliest records of the family were found as Edmund le Leche and William le Leche who were both listed in the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273. A few years later, Robert le Leche was listed in the Writs of Parliament of 1307. 1\n\nFurther north in Scotland, many records were found including: Henry Leche held a tenement in Glasgow in 1325. \"Henry Leche, is later referred to in a safe conduct by Edward III of England in 1348 as \"Hector medicus David de Bruys.\" From another reference to him in 1369, he turns out to be a MacBeth, perhaps one of the family of hereditary doctors of that name so famous in West Highland history. Wilham de Lech or Leche was burgess of Aberdeen, 1362. He may be William Leche, merchant of Aberdeen, whose goods were plundered in England, 1370, when his ship was driven ashore in Kirklee Rode, Suffolk.\" 2 They also settled in Monteith where they gave their name to Leitchtown.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Leach family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Leach research.

As the English language changed and incorporated elements of other European languages, even literate people changed the spelling of their names. The variations of the name Leach include: Leach, Leech, Leche, Leitch, Leich, Leetch and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Leach family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early Leach Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLeach World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Leach is the 686th most popular surname with an estimated 42,279 people with that name. 3 However, in Australia, the name Leach is ranked the 731st most popular surname with an estimated 5,307 people with that name. 4 And in New Zealand, the name Leach is the 637th popular surname with an estimated 1,124 people with that name. 5 The United Kingdom ranks Leach as 432nd with 14,866 people. 6\n\nMigration of the Leach family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Leach family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 50 words (4 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nLeach migration to the United States +\n\nMany English families tired of political and religious strife left Britain for the new colonies in North America. Although the trip itself offered no relief - conditions on the ships were extremely cramped, and many travelers arrived diseased, starving, and destitute - these immigrants believed the opportunities that awaited them were worth the risks. Once in the colonies, many of the families did indeed prosper and, in turn, made significant contributions to the culture and economies of the growing colonies. An inquiry into the early roots of North American families has revealed a number of immigrants bearing the name Leach or a variant listed above:\n\nLeach Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nLawrence Leach, who settled in Salem in 1628\n\nLawrence Leach, who landed in New England in 1628 7\n\nMargaret Leach, aged 15, who arrived in New England in 1635 aboard the ship \"Planter\" 7\n\nMargaret Leach, aged 22, who landed in New England in 1635 aboard the ship \"Susan and Ellin\" 7\n\nRoger Leach, who landed in Virginia in 1635 7\n\n...

The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts.
