The site encompasses a 10-acre area where reports state that an estimated 300 cubic yards of waste asbestos-containing material generated at NAWS China Lake was disposed of in three slit trenches from 1979 to 1981. Some of the asbestos-containing material was reportedly discarded in plastic bags, although much of it was reported to have been loose when it was buried.\n\nArsenic, chromium, and lead were identified as chemicals of concern for soil in the 2004 remedial investigation report, and hexavalent chromium and heptachlor epoxide were identified as chemicals of concern for groundwater at IRP Site 9/10. Additional investigation was completed as part of the 2018 remedial investigation addendum at IRP Site 9 and 10 to accomplish the following: confirm that there were no releases of contaminants to groundwater, provide a more current groundwater dataset, update the previous human health risk assessment, and update previous environmental risk assessments.\n\nBased on the results of the remedial investigation addendum, one additional round of groundwater monitoring was recommended to further evaluate whether concentrations of organic and inorganic compounds in IRP Site 9/10 groundwater are remaining stable or are decreasing. An evaluation of the existing soil cover at both sites was also recommended. Finally, an evaluation and potential removal action was recommended for any surface bulk waste debris at IRP Site 9/10 that is found to contain asbestos.\n\nFieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend future actions.\n\nIRP Site 10 – Salt Wells Disposal Trenches\n\nIRP Site 10 is located in Salt Wells Valley, east of the Propulsion Laboratory Operable Unit. The site consists of 10 trenches adjacent to IRP Site 9. From 1960 to 1980, these trenches reportedly received solid wastes as well as some liquid waste from nearby propulsion laboratories.\n\nArsenic, chromium, and lead were identified as chemicals of concern for soil, and hexavalent chromium and heptachlor epoxide were identified as chemicals of concern for groundwater at IRP Site 9/10. Additional investigation was completed as part of the 2018 remedial investigation addendum at IRP Site 9 and 10 to confirm that there were no releases of contaminants to groundwater, provide a more current groundwater set, and update the previous human health risk assessment and environmental risk assessments.\n\nBased on the results of the remedial investigation addendum, one additional round of groundwater monitoring was recommended to further evaluate whether concentrations of organic and inorganic compounds in IRP Site 9/10 groundwater are remaining stable or are decreasing. An evaluation of the existing soil cover at both sites was also recommended. Finally, an evaluation and potential removal action was recommended for any surface bulk waste debris at IRP Site 9/10 that is found to contain asbestos.\n\nFieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend future actions.\n\nIRP Site 19 – Baker Range Waste Trenches\n\nIRP Site 19 is located in the northwestern portion of the China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site was an open disposal site from 1944 to 1983 and reportedly received approximately 3,000 cubic yards of solid waste before it was subsequently covered by soil. No hazardous waste disposal was documented at the site.\n\nNo chemicals of potential concern were identified in soil or groundwater during the 2006 preliminary assessment and 2012 site inspection. A work plan is being generated for a data gaps study.\n\nFieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend future investigations and actions under CERCLA.\n\nIRP Site 20 – Division 36 Ordnance Waste Area\n\nIRP Site 20 is located in the Division 36 area of the central China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site was used from 1960 to 1979 for disposal of range and inert ordnance wastes, which were reportedly buried in two trenches. The total volume was estimated to be 600 cubic yards. The locations of the two trenches were never verified during subsequent site visits.\n\nNo chemicals of potential concern were identified in soil during the 2006 preliminary assessment and 2012 site inspection. Groundwater at the site was too deep to be evaluated. A geophysical investigation was completed at the site, and the results indicated that no further delineation was required.\n\nIRP Site 20 was removed from the Landfill Operable Unit plans for further investigation based on the results of the geophysical investigation. The Navy will be pursuing no further action based on previous investigations indicating no burial of waste at the site.\n\nIRP Site 21 – CT-4 Disposal Area Background\n\nIRP Site 21 is located in the CT-4 area in Salt Wells Valley at the end of the CT access road. The site consists of a trench that received approximately 2,000 cubic yards of waste between 1956 and 1979. The disposal area was closed in 1979, all waste was removed, and the area was re-graded. The NAWS China Lake Explosive Ordnance Disposal detachment inspected the material as it was removed. Reports of hazardous material disposal could not be corroborated. During site visits in 1996 and 1999, IRP Site 21 appeared free of debris, and no evidence of hazardous materials was found.\n\nNo chemicals of potential concern were identified in soil by the 2002 preliminary assessment. While groundwater was not evaluated, previous data do not confirm that it is even present below the site.\n\nPrevious investigations concluded that no further action was warranted at the site because all disposed waste was removed in 1979. No further action was recommended for IRP Site 21 in the 2015 basis for no further action determination report and agency concurrence was received in February 2015. Additional investigation will be completed in 2021 in accordance with the basewide per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances site inspection.\n\nIRP Site 22 – Pilot Plant Road Landfill\n\nIRP Site 22 is located in the southeastern portion of the China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site was a landfill that received most of the household wastes generated by on-base housing, and small amounts of industrial material, from 1944 to 1965.\n\nNo chemicals of concern were identified for soil or groundwater by risk assessments included in the 1996 and 2000 remedial investigations. A data gaps investigation concluded that reduced frequency or reduced monitoring may be pursued based on the lack of site impacts over the last 50 years. Before any monitoring occurs, replacement of dry wells may be necessary because of declining groundwater levels.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend future, additional CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 23 – K-2 South Disposal Area\n\nIRP Site 23 is located in the south-central portion of the China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley, along North Knox Road, south of the Aircraft Survivability area. The site consists of three trenches that received range waste from 1950 until 1981. Unopened 1- and 5-gallon cans of chlordane were reportedly received at this site. Navy personnel interviewed during a 1996 site reconnaissance confirmed that some of the chlordane in the 1- and 5-gallon containers had been placed at IRP Site 23.\n\nBased on the 2006 preliminary assessment and 2012 site inspection report, arsenic, chromium, and polychlorinated biphenyls were identified as chemicals of potential concern for soil, and trichloroethylene was identified as a chemical of potential concern for groundwater. A 2018 data gaps investigation confirmed chlorinated solvent concentrations at the site, indicating a low-level release to groundwater that may require further evaluation and delineation.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 24 – K-2 North Disposal Areas\n\nIRP Site 24 is located in the K-2 Range in the northeastern portion of the China Lake Complex, east of the Aircraft Survivability area within the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of two trenches excavated in a natural drainage that received range waste from 1950 to 1981. Previous reports indicated that at least several 1- and 5-gallon cans of chlordane were emplaced at this site and others in the 1970s. The site received an estimated 500 to 1,000 cubic yards of waste. No chemicals of potential concern were identified for soil by the 2006 preliminary assessment and 2012 site inspection. Groundwater was not evaluated since it is not likely present at the site based on the shallow bedrock nearby. A geophysical investigation at the site found no features that warrant further delineation.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend future, additional CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 25 – G-2 Range Disposal Area\n\nIRP Site 25 is located in the G-2 Range in the southern portion of the China Lake Complex, east of G-2 Tower Road within the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of three trenches that received inert range waste from 1944 to 1958 and is also referred to as AOC 241. An estimated 600 cubic yards of waste were disposed of at the site. No chemicals of potential concern were identified for soil or groundwater by the 2006 preliminary assessment and 2012 site inspection. An ecological risk screening has not yet been completed. A geophysical investigation at the site found no features that warrant further delineation.\n\nThe Navy is conducting more work in the area as part of the larger AOC 241. The site is also being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 26 – G-2 Range Ordnance Waste Area\n\nIRP Site 26 is located in the southern portion of the China Lake Complex south of George Road within the Indian Wells Valley. The site, also known as Point of Interest 110, consists of two trenches that received an estimated 500 cubic yards of inert range waste from 1950 to 1979. No chemicals of potential concern were identified for soil or groundwater by the 2006 preliminary assessment and 2012 site inspection. An ecological risk screening has not yet been performed.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 27 – NAF Disposal Area\n\nIRP Site 27 is located northwest of Armitage Field in the Indian Wells Valley. The site is an inactive landfill that received an estimated 2,000 cubic yards of waste materials in five slit trenches between 1945 and 1978. No chemicals of potential concern were identified for groundwater by the site inspection, and soil was assessed not to be of concern because the wastes are buried. Volatile organic compounds and helium were identified as chemicals of potential concern in soil vapor at the site.\n\nThe Navy is conducting a site inspection for IRP Site 27, which will summarize the results of surface soil and groundwater sampling and analysis completed in April 2015 and soil gas and groundwater sampling and analysis completed in July 2017. Additional data collection was recommended based on the results of the site inspection.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 29 – C-1 East Disposal Area\n\nIRP Site 29 is situated within the Indian Wells Valley in the northwestern portion of the China Lake Complex. The site is a disposal area where ordnance and other materials were buried from the early 1950s through the late 1970s. Initial investigations documented a possible one-time disposal of chlordane and lead-based paint, although this was not confirmed by subsequent investigations. A 2018 focused feasibility study identified cadmium, lead, and radionuclides as chemicals of concern for soil but identified no chemicals of concern for groundwater.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future, CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 30 – C-1 Range West Disposal Area\n\nIRP Site 30 is located within the Indian Wells Valley in the southern-central portion of the China Lake Complex. The site is an ordnance landfill thought to have received inert and live ordnance waste from 1950 to 1979. The site contains an area of noticeable disturbance, which is surrounded by signs indicating burial of ordnance. The volume or type of ordnance could not be identified. No chemicals of potential concern were identified for soil or groundwater at IRP Site 30 by the 2006 preliminary assessment and 2012 site inspection.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 34 – Lauritsen Road Landfill\n\nIRP Site 34 is a disposal area located east of North Lauritsen Road in the Indian Wells Valley. The site is a relatively large landfill that received solid and liquid wastes from 1944 to 1955. An estimated 2,000 cubic yards of material were disposed of at the site.\n\nArsenic and manganese were identified as chemicals of potential concern for soil; hexavalent chromium, metals, volatile organic compounds, and one semivolatile organic compound were identified as chemicals of potential concern for groundwater; and chloroform and trichloroethylene were identified as chemicals of potential concern for soil vapor. A geophysical survey was conducted in December 2018 with the goal of delineating the disposal trenches at the site. The results of the survey conclusively identified a significant number of disposal trenches either fully or partially covered.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 37 – Golf Course Landfill\n\nIRP Site 37 is located south and east of the golf course and south of Knox Road in the Indian Wells Valley. The site was used from 1945 to 1964 for disposal of general refuse, construction waste, and demolition debris. The 2004 remedial investigation confirmed that waste was primarily dumped on the surface of the ground and was not placed in trenches or buried. An estimated 1,200 cubic yards of waste were deposited in the landfill. No chemicals of concern were identified for soil or groundwater in the 2018 remedial investigation addendum.\n\nThe combined remedial investigation and remedial investigation addendum concluded that IRP Site 37 should no longer be considered a landfill because no burial of waste was observed. The geophysical survey did not identify disposal trenches, all waste appears to be limited to surface piles, and some of the construction debris exposed at the surface contains asbestos. There is no indication of a release of contaminants to surface soil, subsurface soil, or groundwater.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 40 – Randsburg Wash No. 1\n\nIRP Site 40 is located approximately 1 mile north of the main administration buildings for the Randsburg Wash/Mojave B Complex. The site consists of three open trenches where solid waste from Randsburg Wash operations were reportedly buried from 1950 to 1975. Materials disposed of in the trenches consisted primarily of inert ordnance and range wastes. No chemicals of potential concern were identified for soil by the 2012 site inspection, and groundwater was not evaluated because it is expected to be very deep.\n\nA geophysical survey was conducted between December 2018 and January 2019 that showed that the largest trench, which was partially open, also contains more areas of adjacent buried waste. The survey also found a second area of disposal south of the open trench.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will provide recommendations for future, additional CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 41 – Randsburg Wash No. 2\n\nIRP Site 41 is located in Randsburg Wash, north of the main administration buildings. The site contains a trench where waste was reportedly buried in the 1950s and 1960s. The total quantities of waste oil and solvents disposed of were estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000 gallons each.\n\nNo chemicals of concern were identified in the 2004 remedial investigation. An attempt was made to install one monitoring well, but no groundwater was encountered to a depth of 275 feet below ground surface, and the borehole was abandoned. The remedial investigation concluded that reports of waste disposal in prior reports for IRP Site 41 were not accurate. Rather, it concluded that these wastes were disposed of in a nearby trench at AOC 154.\n\nA no further action status was finalized in December 2014, and therefore IRP Site 41 is considered closed. Further action is being conducted at AOC 154.\n\nIRP Site 67 – Lane Haven Dump\n\nIRP Site 67, the Lane Haven Dump, is located outside of the main China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site was used to dispose of trash from the Lane Haven Trailer Court from 1964 to 1981. The Navy acquired the property in 1981, and the dump may have been used later to dispose of drums of oil. The pit is uncovered, and interviews revealed that unauthorized dumping at the site had been an ongoing problem because the area was unsecured and readily accessible.\n\nNo evidence of drum disposal was found on the site during a 2000 site visit. No chemicals of potential concern were identified for soil during the 2012 site inspection. Groundwater was not investigated since it is expected to occur at a depth greater than 250 feet below ground surface. A geophysical survey was conducted in December 2018 with the goal of confirming that the dump was removed or to locate its actual location. The results of the survey showed no areas of significant burial at the site that would indicate a waste disposal trench or dump.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nIRP Site 84 – Salt Wells Burn Area\n\nIRP Site 84 is located in the Salt Wells Valley east of the Propulsion Laboratory. The site is not well documented historically, but it is believed that the area was used to stage and then burn waste materials from explosive tests. The operating dates are unknown. It was originally investigated in July 2003 as part of the remedial investigation conducted at the Propulsion Laboratory Operable Unit. It was subsequently moved to the AOC program for additional studies. Based on the results of the additional work, the Navy converted AOC 235 into IRP Site 84.\n\nDuring the 2018 site inspection, metals in soil and hexavalent chromium, chlorinated solvents, and molybdenum in groundwater were identified as chemicals of potential concern. The site inspection concluded that further evaluation in the form of an additional remedial investigation or feasibility study is warranted.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 32 – Armitage Field Asbestos Dumps\n\nAOC 32 was reportedly located directly west of the airfield along Range Access Road. The site is a reported disposal area covered with soil that contains asbestos from demolition materials disposed of in the early 1980s. A December 2000 site reconnaissance discovered that a building and parking lot may be covering the burial area. In April 2005, another potential burial site was discovered but quickly ruled out. No samples have been collected at the AOC. The only remaining suspected location of the disposal area is beneath the building and parking lot.\n\nBased on known information, the site was recommended for low priority for future evaluation. Although the site is currently considered part of the Landfill Operable Unit, the Navy is investigating it as part of a site inspection at IRP Site 80. A geophysical investigation will be conducted at AOC 32 within the parking lot to evaluate whether potential burial trenches or debris are present within the parking lot. If a potential disposal site is identified, then surface and subsurface soil samples will be collected for analysis of asbestos.\n\nThe results of the site inspection will inform the next steps at the site. The field activities were planned for 2020, with no reported results yet available.\n\nAOC 59 – B-Range Trichloroethylene Burial\n\nAOC 59 is located in the North Range area near the western boundary of the base. The site consists of a shallow trench that previously held several 55-gallon drums, most containing fluid that appeared to be motor oil. The Navy removed all drums as part of a range cleanup effort. Additionally, miscellaneous trash was present inside the trench, and there are areas of stained soil. All debris was also removed along with the drums. This area was once believed to be the location of buried trichloroethylene containers.\n\nTotal petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and arsenic were identified as chemicals of potential concern in soil in the 2006 preliminary assessment report. An attempt was made at three separate locations to install temporary monitoring wells to collect groundwater samples, but drilling equipment encountered bedrock that it was unable to penetrate before groundwater was encountered during all three attempts.\n\nBased on previous studies, a 2010 report recommended AOC 59 no longer be considered high priority for future investigation. Although the site is currently considered part of the Landfill Operable Unit, the Navy is investigating it as part of a site inspection at IRP Site 80. Surface and subsurface soil and soil gas samples will be collected.\n\nThe results of the site inspection will inform the next steps taken at the site. The field activities were planned for 2020, with no reported results yet available.\n\nAOC 64 – Building X (Area ER)\n\nAOC 64 is located in the central portion of the main base just south of Water Road. The site consists of scattered surface debris and an area of disposal trenches, along with a septic system, associated with Building X in Area ER. Area ER is the self-contained facility constructed in 1945 to develop the atomic bomb fuze and for drop tests. This area was active from 1945 to the 1980s. After World War II, all the buildings were eventually used for other projects.\n\nThe chemicals of potential concern identified at the site include total petroleum hydrocarbons, dioxins, pesticides, and radionuclides in soil as well as tetrachloroethene, perchlorate, and radionuclides in groundwater. The geophysical survey indicates that buried debris is still present in the old trenches at the site. The 2010 technical memorandum recommended further investigation, focusing on identifying whether the buried debris is responsible for the localized solvent detections in groundwater.\n\nAlthough AOC 64 is currently considered part of the Landfill Operable Unit, the Navy planned to investigate AOC 64 as part of a site inspection at IRP Site 80. However, it was removed from the list of AOCs for the site inspection and will be addressed within the framework of the Navy’s radiological program, which is not part of the ERP.\n\nAOC 85 – CT Main Site Trenches\n\nAOC 85 is located in a series of drainages at the edge of a playa in Salt Wells Valley. The site is an abandoned landfill suspected to have received X-ray and photographic chemicals and other industrial wastes in the 1940s and 1950s. No significant burial was apparent during the 2018 site inspection. The chemicals of potential concern identified at the site include metals in soil and total petroleum hydrocarbons, chloroform, and metals in groundwater. Several metals were also identified as chemicals of potential environmental concern in the site inspection report.\n\nA geophysical survey was conducted in December 2018 with the goal of defining any suspected disposal trenches at the site. The results of the survey showed no significant anomalies that would indicate a disposal trench, although some areas of shallow buried waste were identified in areas of surface debris.\n\nThe Navy conducted a site inspection for several of the AOCs under the Landfill Operable Unit. It was decided that further evaluation as part of a remedial investigation or feasibility study is warranted for this site. The site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 99 – G-2 Dump\n\nAOC 99 is located near the eastern-central portion of the main base. The site was initially reported as an abandoned dump where debris was exposed at the surface. Dates of waste disposal are unknown. Various metals were identified as both chemicals of potential concern and chemicals of potential environmental concern for soil and groundwater.\n\nAOC 99 is now being used for range operations and no longer falls under the CERCLA guidelines for evaluation. AOC 99 is recommended for removal from the IRP and transfer to the range sustainment program, where further evaluation may be required in the future.\n\nAOC 102 – G-4 Track Dump\n\nAOC 102 is located in the northern portion of the main base. The site is an asbestos landfill that is well covered with soil and is marked with signs. The cover is a soil mound that directs water away and minimizes potential infiltration. The dates of disposal and the contents of the trench are unknown. An attempt was made to measure the depth to groundwater in a well during the 2005 investigation, but no water was encountered down to a depth of 300 feet. The only chemical of potential concern identified during the preliminary assessment was total petroleum hydrocarbons in soil.\n\nThe 2006 preliminary assessment recommended AOC 102 as a low priority for future evaluation. Although AOC 102 is currently considered part of the Landfill Operable Unit, the Navy is investigating AOC 102 as part of a site inspection at IRP Site 80. Further soil sampling will take place to assess potential soil impacts on the site.\n\nThe results of the site inspection will inform the next steps taken at the site. The field activities were planned for 2020, with no reported results yet available.\n\nAOC 113 – K-2 Housing Waste Dumps\n\nAOC 113 is located in the eastern portion of the main base near the Aircraft Survivability area. The site is a single open trench that was used to bury concrete rubble from demolition in the housing area. Dates of waste disposal are unknown. Various metals were identified as chemicals of potential concern and chemicals of potential environmental concern in soil during the 2018 site inspection. Based on the location of AOC 113, it was concluded that it would be unlikely that groundwater would be encountered in the area.\n\nThe Navy conducted a site inspection for several of the AOCs under the Landfill Operable Unit. It was decided that further evaluation as part of a remedial investigation or feasibility study is warranted for this site. The site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 118 – K-2 West Disposal Trenches\n\nAOC 118 is located in the eastern portion of the main base near the Aircraft Survivability area. The site consists of two debris areas with partially buried wastes and an aircraft disposal site. Dates of waste disposal are unknown. Various metals were identified as chemicals of potential concern and chemicals of potential environmental concern in soil during the 2018 site inspection. Based on the location of AOC 118, it was determined that encountering groundwater in the area would be unlikely.\n\nA geophysical survey was conducted in December 2018 with the goal of identifying whether any disposal trenches exist at the site or if the debris is surficial. The results indicated that there are no areas of significant waste burial at AOC 118, which confirms the initial assumptions.\n\nThe Navy conducted a site inspection for several of the AOCs under the Landfill Operable Unit. It was determined that further evaluation as part of a remedial investigation or feasibility study is warranted for this site. The site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 122 – LB Dump\n\nAOC 122 is an open trench near the live bombing administration area, located in the North Range area. Dates of disposal are unknown. Total petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and acetone were identified as chemicals of potential concern in soil by the 2006 preliminary assessment.\n\nThe preliminary assessment recommended that AOC 122 be considered a low priority for future work. Although AOC 122 is currently considered part of the Landfill Operable Unit, the Navy is investigating AOC 122 as part of a site inspection at IRP Site 80. Further soil sampling will occur to evaluate the extent of potential soil impacts.\n\nThe results of the site inspection will inform the next steps taken at the site. The field activities were planned for 2020, with no reported results yet available.\n\nAOC 124 – LB West Dump\n\nAOC 124 consists of an aircraft debris dump within the active live bombing range, located in the North Range area. Dates of disposal are unknown. Cadmium and zinc in soil were identified as chemicals of potential concern during the 2018 site inspection. Groundwater was not evaluated but is expected to be around 50 feet below ground surface. Antimony, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc were identified as chemicals of potential environmental concern in soil.\n\nA geophysical survey was conducted in December 2018 with the goal of identifying whether any disposal trenches exist at the site or if the debris is only on the surface. The results indicated that areas of waste burial at AOC 124 are both associated with and nearby an observed pile of debris.\n\nThe Navy conducted a site inspection for several of the AOCs under the Landfill Operable Unit. It was determined that further evaluation as part of a remedial investigation or feasibility study is warranted for this site. The site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 131 – Old AEC Trench\n\nAOC 131 is reportedly located in Salt Wells Valley, near the CT area. The site was a suspected buried disposal trench. The dates of operation are unknown, but most likely it was operational in the 1940s. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified in soil or groundwater in the 2006 preliminary assessment report.\n\nThe reported disposal trench could not be located after multiple interviews, reviews of aerial photographs, a search of documents, and two separate geophysical surveys. Therefore, the preliminary assessment recommended no further action for AOC 131. The site was included in the work plan for IRP Site 80 but will likely not be part of the site inspection because of the lack of evidence that the trench exists. A request for a no further action designation is planned for AOC 131.\n\nAOC 154 – Randsburg Wash Land Site Trenches\n\nAOC 154 is located in Randsburg Wash, northeast of the main administration area. The site consists of two large disposal pits or trenches that were the main disposal site for operations in Randsburg Wash from the early 1950s until use was discontinued in 1980. Approximately 3 cubic yards of waste per week were reportedly disposed of in this area. It was also reported that the waste piles were burned regularly.\n\nMore recent investigations have suggested that waste disposal attributed to trenches at IRP Site 41 may actually have occurred at AOC 154 because no evidence of disposal was found during investigation of IRP Site 41. As a result, the Navy, with state concurrence, closed IRP Site 41 and focused on the waste disposal identified at AOC 154. A geophysical survey supported by limited surface and subsurface soil sampling has identified a single, relatively large trench at AOC 154.\n\nTotal petroleum hydrocarbons, total cyanide, arsenic, and perchlorate were identified in the 2006 preliminary assessment report as chemicals of potential concern in soil. Assessment of groundwater has been problematic because the depth to groundwater at the site is believed to be up to 500 feet below ground surface. The site was part of a geophysical survey conducted between December 2018 and January 2019 to help with delineating the trench.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 173 – Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track Film Dump\n\nAOC 173 is reportedly a covered, 5-acre dump located in the eastern portion of the main base just south of the Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track control and administration building. Dates of waste disposal are unknown. Minor staining was observed at the site during the site reconnaissance conducted in January 2001. Several burn areas, a small area of black tar, and several scattered areas of metal debris were also observed.\n\nGroundwater was not encountered in a soil boring that went to 105 feet below ground surface and was therefore not sampled. The need to drill deeper using alternative methods was not warranted based on the analytical result for soil samples and the geophysical survey and exploratory trenching at the site. Total petroleum hydrocarbons and acetone were detected in soil and identified as chemicals of potential concern in the 2006 preliminary assessment report.\n\nThe preliminary assessment recommended the site as a low priority for further investigation. Although AOC 173 is currently considered part of the Landfill Operable Unit, the Navy is investigating the site as part of a site inspection at IRP Site 80. Samples will be collected to evaluate surface soils for dioxins, furans, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at the area of burned soil. The results of the site inspection will inform the next steps taken at the site. The field activities were planned for 2020, with no reported results yet available.\n\nAOC 206 – Sierra View Dump\n\nAOC 206 is located adjacent to the south base boundary along Inyokern Road. The site was reportedly used for disposal of industrial and construction debris from 1947 to the mid-1970s. Currently, an open pit is present and industrial, construction, and demolition debris is visible. Wastes include asbestos, construction debris, industrial waste, metal scrap, oil and grease, paints and thinners, wood scrap, and target debris. The analytes identified as chemicals of potential concern during the site inspection included arsenic in soil, and arsenic, manganese, and molybdenum in groundwater. Lead and zinc were identified as chemicals of potential environmental concern in soil.\n\nThe Navy conducted a 2018 site inspection for several of the AOCs under the Landfill Operable Unit. It was determined that further evaluation as part of a remedial investigation or feasibility study is warranted for this site. The site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 211 – Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track Dump West\n\nAOC 211 is located in the southwestern portion of the base just west of the Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track control and administration building. The site consists of disposal trenches and burn areas used to dispose of industrial wastes from research and development at the Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track from the 1960s to the 1980s. Total petroleum hydrocarbons, the explosive compound TNT, bromoform, acetone, dioxins, arsenic, and perchlorate were detected and identified as chemicals of potential concern in soil in the 2006 preliminary assessment report. Dioxins and perchlorate were detected and identified as chemicals of potential concern in groundwater.\n\nThe site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 228 – Baker 3 Tower\n\nAOC 228 is located near the western boundary of the main base in Baker Range. The site includes a burned building, an associated underground storage tank, and a dump north of the building site. Historical information suggests the likely presence of unexploded ordnance in the dump. A septic system was reported but not located. The area was active in the 1940s and 1950s. Total petroleum hydrocarbons, benzene, furans, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and metals were detected and identified as chemicals of potential concern in soil in the 2006 preliminary assessment report. Total petroleum hydrocarbons, semivolatile organic compounds, dioxins, metals, and perchlorate were detected and identified as chemicals of potential concern in groundwater.\n\nThe preliminary assessment recommended AOC 228 as medium priority for further investigation. Although the site is currently considered part of the Landfill Operable Unit, the Navy is investigating it as part of a site inspection at IRP Site 80. Further soil and groundwater samples will be collected from around the site to better gauge the level of contamination.\n\nThe results of the site inspection will inform the next steps taken at the site. The field activities were planned for 2020, with no reported results yet available.\n\nAOC 239 – CLPP Chemical Lab Dump (also Identified as AOC 161)\n\nAOC 239 is located near the crest of the hill between the Indian Wells and Salt Wells Valleys, north of the China Lake Propulsion Laboratory gate. The site is a buried dump, possibly containing waste debris from chemical laboratories. The dates of disposal are unknown. AOC 239 was identified as the same location as AOC 161 during the April 2004 site visits. Based on drilling for this investigation, groundwater is not believed to exist in the unconsolidated soil beneath this AOC.\n\nThe chemicals of potential concern and chemicals of potential environmental concern identified during the site inspection at AOC 239 included explosives, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and metals in soil. Groundwater was not encountered even though drilling was completed to 80 feet below ground surface.\n\nThe Navy conducted a site inspection in 2018 for several of the AOCs under the Landfill Operable Unit. It was determined that further evaluation as part of a remedial investigation or feasibility study is warranted for this site. The site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 241 – G-Range Control (Temporary)\n\nAOC 241 is located in the playa in the central portion of the main base. The site was built as a temporary ground range control facility for testing live and inert weapons while the G-1 and G-2 permanent facilities were under construction. The facility reportedly was most likely used for only a few years, possibly between 1945 and 1952. Recent information suggests that AOC 241, or portions of the AOC, are the same location as IRP Site 25.\n\nTotal petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, cyanide, pesticides, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, and metals were identified in the 2006 preliminary assessment report as chemicals of potential concern for soil. Total petroleum hydrocarbons, carbon disulfide, metals, and chloride were identified in the preliminary assessment report as chemicals of potential concern for groundwater.\n\nThe preliminary assessment recommended AOC 241 as medium priority for further investigation. Although the site is currently considered part of the Landfill Operable Unit, the Navy is investigating it as part of IRP Site 80. Further soil samples from both the surface and subsurface will be collected from around the site to better gauge the level of contamination.\n\nThe results of the site inspection will inform the next steps taken at the site. The field activities were planned for 2020 , with no reported results yet available.\n\nAOC 242 – Baker 3 Film Dump\n\nAOC 242 is located near the western boundary of the main base in Baker Range. The site is an unlined open trench. Surface photographs date the trench to the 1940s and 1950s. The trench contains boxes of film, empty 55-gallon drums, wood debris, and trash. The chemicals of potential concern identified during the 2018 site inspection at AOC 242 included arsenic and manganese in soil, and total petroleum hydrocarbons and metals in groundwater. Lead, molybdenum, vanadium, and zinc were also identified as chemicals of potential environmental concern in soil at AOC 242.\n\nThe Navy conducted a site inspection for several of the AOCs under the Landfill Operable Unit. It was determined that further evaluation as part of a remedial investigation or feasibility study is warranted for this site. The site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nAOC 243 – Area R East Trenches\n\nAOC 243 is located in Area R near the intersection of Pole Line Road and Water Road. The site consists of three specific disposal trenches designated Trenches 1, 2, and 3. The trenches were first identified as part of the 1996 preliminary assessment investigation for the Area R OU. Based on historical aerial photographs, the trenches were in use as early as 1949, and Trench 2 was filled in by 1979. Trenches 1 and 3 remain partially open.\n\nThe chemicals of potential concern identified during the 2018 site inspection at AOC 243 included thallium in soil and hexavalent chromium in groundwater. Chemicals of potential environmental concern identified in soil included cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc.\n\nThe Navy conducted a site inspection for several of the AOCs under the Landfill Operable Unit. It was determined that further evaluation as part of a remedial investigation or feasibility study is warranted for this site. The site is being included in a data gaps work plan for the Landfill Operable Unit sites. Fieldwork will be completed in the winter of 2020 and 2021 and documented in a draft technical memorandum anticipated to be available in the summer of 2021. The technical memorandum will recommend additional, future CERCLA actions.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCollapse All Expand All\n\nIRP Site 4 – Beryllium-Contaminated Equipment Disposal Area\n\nIRP Site 4 is located in a remote area of the Salt Wells Valley portion of the China Lake Complex. The site consists of an area where beryllium-contaminated equipment reportedly had been burned and buried. The Navy conducted experiments on beryllium-based propellants at the China Lake Propulsion Laboratory from the early 1960s until 1965. Approximately 900 cubic yards of burned scrap equipment and materials were disposed of at the site. IRP Site 4 includes only the area where this waste was reportedly buried. The site was abandoned after the experiments ended.\n\nBeryllium was the only chemical of potential concern at IRP Site 4 based on past site use and conclusions of the 1997 and 2002 preliminary assessments, although beryllium was not found to be a chemical of potential concern or chemical of potential environmental concern for soil by additional site inspections conducted in 2012.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the no further action decision and indicated that a determination letter for the site is being developed. The Navy is currently awaiting the joint agency no further action determination letter.\n\nIRP Site 5 – Burro Canyon Open Burn/Open Detonation Facility\n\nIRP Site 5 is located in the central portion of the China Lake Complex off G-2 Tower Road in the Indian Wells Valley. IRP Site 5 consists of an area where hazardous waste chemicals were transported to and burned with other propellant, explosive, and pyrotechnic material from 1968 to 1979. It has been estimated that 1,200 cubic yards of these waste materials were incinerated at IRP Site 5. Burro Canyon is managed under a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Part B permit (non-CERCLA) and continues to be used to treat explosive hazardous waste. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for IRP Site 5.\n\nThe Navy has deferred IRP Site 5 from the IRP since the site is under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act interim status. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act corrective action will be initiated for this site, if necessary.\n\nIRP Site 6 – T-Range Disposal Area\n\nIRP Site 6 was an open burn facility for propellant, explosive, and pyrotechnic wastes and contains six distinct areas with pits, trenches, and aboveground tanks used for open burning. Past operations included disposal of wastes in trenches or pits. This range site was used from 1946 to 1975.\n\nThe remedy published in the 2006 record of decision for IRP Site 6 focuses on consolidation of waste piles and debris and placement of an engineered cover over Areas 1, 2 and 3. Perchlorate, barium, and the explosive RDX are the chemicals of concern for soil at IRP Site 6. Groundwater was assessed and is not present at the site.\n\nConsolidation and construction work at the site began in November 2010 and work for Areas 1, 2, and 3 was completed in February 2012. After additional contaminated waste was discovered at Area 4, a removal action was undertaken to construct another engineering cover for both soil in Area 4 and for excavated soil from the Propulsion Laboratory Operable Unit.\n\nOngoing activities at IRP Site 6 include implementation of land use controls and maintenance programs to ensure the engineering covers are functioning correctly. A post-closure maintenance plan was prepared for the site to outline requirements for monitoring cover settlement, inspecting the integrity of the covers and surrounding drainage controls, reporting any cover impacts that may require repairs, and describing repair procedures.\n\nThe remedy in place at IRP Site 6 will continue to be evaluated in five-year reviews. The next five-year review is planned for 2022.\n\nIRP Site 12 – Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track Road Landfill\n\nIRP Site 12 is located near the southern boundary of the main China lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site includes a 15-acre landfill that received approximately 100 tons of solid waste per year from 1952 to 1979. The landfill was closed in 1979 by capping it with a native soil cover. No chemicals of concern or chemicals of environmental concern were identified for soil at IRP Site 12 by 2000 remedial investigation risk assessments, and arsenic, the single chemical of concern, was identified for IRP Site 12 groundwater.\n\nA third five-year review was completed in 2016 and included document and data review, site inspections, personnel interviews, regulatory agency comments, and report development. The report noted that no activity considered inconsistent with use as a closed landfill was present and concluded that the remedy at IRP Site 12 was protective of human health and the environment. The report further recommended that the Navy conduct annual site inspections during the next five-year review period. Annual inspections will continue, and the next five-year review will be completed in 2022.\n\nIRP Site 14 – ER Range Septic System\n\nIRP Site 14 is located within the Indian Wells Valley in the southern portion of the China Lake Complex. The site is described as the ER Range septic system, which includes five septic tanks, a leach field, and piping from the buildings to the tanks and leach field. From 1950 to 1981, etching process fluids, cooling tower fluids, and sanitary wastewater were reported to have been discharged into the septic system from the adjacent laboratory buildings. Etching wastewater is residual material collected from the etching process, which used chromic acid to produce a pattern or design on metal. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil or groundwater at IRP Site 14 by the site inspection.\n\nThe Navy initiated a 2012 supplemental site inspection, which included IRP Site 14. The risk assessments did not identify any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for the site.\n\nIn January 2014, the regulatory agencies requested further testing for hexavalent chromium in soil and groundwater. Surface and subsurface soil samples and groundwater samples were collected in May 2019, and the results will be published in a technical memorandum. Additional investigation will be completed in 2021 in accordance with the basewide per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances site inspection.\n\nIRP Site 16 – G-1 Range Septic System\n\nIRP Site 16 is located in the southern portion of the China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site is a septic system that from 1950 to 1981 received sanitary waste from buildings in the G-1 Range complex, primarily photo-processing waste from the range telemetering ground station. The septic system was abandoned in 1981 when the buildings were connected to the City of Ridgecrest sewage treatment plant. Over the 31 years of operation, the system’s maximum flow of sanitary wastes was estimated to be 1,800 gallons per day. Photo-processing waste that may have contained metals, volatile organic compounds, and cyanide was released at a rate of approximately 30 gallons per day. The 1997 preliminary assessment and 2002 site inspection did not identify any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for soil or groundwater at IRP Site 16.\n\nThe Navy initiated a supplemental site inspection in 2012, which included IRP Site 16. The risk assessments did not identify any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for the site.\n\nFurther soil and groundwater sample collection was requested by the regulatory agencies in January 2014. In May 2019, additional samples were collected and analyzed for cyanide and metals in soil and volatile organic compounds, metals, cyanide, hexavalent chromium, nitrates, sulfate, thiocyanate, and coliform in groundwater. The results will be published in a technical memorandum. Additional investigation will be completed in 2021 in accordance with the basewide per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances site inspection.\n\nIRP Site 17 – G-2 Range Septic System\n\nIRP Site 17 is located in the southern portion of the China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of a septic system that received wastewater from a former range operation building and other surrounding buildings from 1950 to 1981. An estimated 4,600 gallons per day of wastewater were received by the system, 100 gallons per day of which were explosive and photographic laboratory wastewater. The septic system was abandoned in 1981 when the buildings were connected to the City of Ridgecrest sewage treatment plant. The 1997 preliminary assessment and 2002 site inspection did not identify any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for soil or groundwater at IRP Site 17.\n\nThe Navy initiated a supplemental site inspection in 2012, which included IRP Site 17. The risk assessments identified vanadium as a subsurface chemical of potential concern for the site, and trichloroethene and several metals as chemicals of interest for groundwater. No unacceptable risk to ecological receptors was identified.\n\nIn January 2014, the regulatory agencies requested further sample collection. In May 2019, surface soil samples were collected and analyzed for perchlorate and explosives. The results did not detect any explosives, although perchlorate was detected in all three samples. The 2020 technical memorandum for the additional sampling recommended that IRP Site 17 be designated with no further action status for soil. Additional investigation will be completed in 2021 in accordance with the basewide per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances site inspection.\n\nIRP Site 18 – China Lake Propulsion Laboratory Leach Fields\n\nIRP Site 18 is located just east of the China Lake Propulsion Laboratory main gate in the main China Lake Complex. The site consists of six AOCs located within 3 miles of each other. The main features are leach fields and cesspools that received a wide variety of wastewater chemicals from 1950 to 1981. Based on the 1997 and 2002 preliminary assessments, diethylphthalate, cadmium, lead, selenium, silver, and thallium were identified as chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern in soil at IRP Site 18.\n\nThe Navy initiated a supplemental site inspection in 2012, which included IRP Site 18. The risk assessments identified metals as chemicals of potential concern and chemicals of potential environmental concern for soil at the site but designated no further action for groundwater based on its absence at the site.\n\nIn January 2014, the regulatory agencies requested further soil sampling within the sludge bed. Samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, explosives, perchlorate, total nitrogen, and metals. Based on the data collected, further sampling will be conducted to evaluate the extent of diethylphthalate and metals in soil at IRP Site 18, although no further action status was warranted for groundwater. Additional investigation will be completed in 2021 in accordance with the basewide per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances site inspection.\n\nIRP Site 28 – Old DPDO Storage Yard\n\nIRP Site 28 is located in the Indian Wells valley in the main south-central portion of the China Lake Complex. The site consists of a large unpaved area used to store a variety of items. Transformers were reportedly stored at the site from 1965 to 1970. Since then, the area has reverted to desert habitat. The potential sources of contamination at IRP Site 28 include leakage from transformers stored at the site or possible widespread application of waste oil for dust suppression. The chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern identified for IRP Site 28 during the 1997 and 2002 preliminary assessments and 2005 site inspection included polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins, furans, and metals. Groundwater has not been investigated at IRP Site 28.\n\nThe Navy initiated a supplemental site inspection in 2012, which included IRP Site 28. Based on the data collected, the supplemental site inspection recommended further sampling to evaluate the extent of contaminants at IRP Site 28. The Navy is conducting a remedial investigation at IRP Site 28 to better define the nature and extent of contamination in both soil and groundwater. The results of the remedial investigation will inform further actions.\n\nIRP Site 31 – Public Works Pesticide Rinse Area\n\nIRP Site 31 is in the Indian Wells Valley, approximately 2,400 feet south-southeast of the NAWS China Lake main gate. The site consisted of a small unpaved area where, from 1945 to 1980, rinse water contaminated with pesticides and herbicides and concentrated solutions of pesticides and herbicides were reportedly discharged directly onto the ground. The system was improved in 1980. Pesticides, primarily chlordane, and arsenic were identified as chemicals of potential concern for soil at IRP Site 31 and were addressed by removal actions. No chemicals of potential concern were identified at IRP Site 31 for groundwater based on phase I remedial investigation sampling.\n\nThe additional removal action was conducted at IRP Site 31 in 1999. Based on the analytical results, the 2000 removal action report concluded that no further removal action was necessary. During meetings and site tours conducted at the site in January 2014, the Navy and the regulatory agencies identified the need for additional data.\n\nThe Navy sampled groundwater at IRP Site 31 in spring 2016 to confirm that the site had not contaminated shallow groundwater, and a small number of soil samples were also collected. The spring 2016 data report recommended considering no further action status for groundwater at IRP Site 31. The data also confirmed residual soil contamination in the area, warranting further evaluation. The Navy is currently preparing a remedial investigation work plan for the site, with field activities planned for 2021. The results of the remedial investigation will inform further actions.\n\nIRP Site 32 – Golf Course Pesticide Rinse Area\n\nIRP Site 32 is located within the Indian Wells Valley in the northern portion of the main base adjacent to the western side of the golf course. The site consisted of a small unpaved area where rinse water contaminated with pesticides and herbicides was reportedly discharged directly onto the ground from the mid-1960s to 1980. An estimated 1,000 gallons of rinse water may have been discharged onto the soil each year. In 1980, a concrete pad, drain, and underground reinforced concrete vault used for containment were installed at IRP Site 32. Pesticides were identified as human health chemicals of concern for soil at IRP Site 32 and were addressed by a removal action. No chemicals of concern were identified at IRP Site 32 for groundwater based on phase I remedial investigation sampling.\n\nThe Navy and regulatory agencies identified additional data needs at the site during meetings in January 2014. The Navy therefore sampled groundwater at IRP Site 32 in spring 2016 to confirm that the site had not contaminated shallow groundwater. The new data verified the lack of pesticides or other organic chemicals in groundwater but found elevated concentrations of metals in several wells. The data also found elevated concentrations of pesticides in soil at the site. The Navy is currently preparing a remedial investigation work plan for the site, with field activities planned for 2021. The results of the remedial investigation will inform further actions.\n\nIRP Site 35 – Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track Accidenta\n\nIRP Site 35 is located within the Indian Wells Valley, west of Armitage Field in the main China Lake Complex. This location is the site of a Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track accident. In 1961, an experimental propellant that included 4 pounds of beryllium accidentally detonated in the gun barrel of the artillery test equipment. Residual dust and the contaminated equipment were reportedly removed from the ground surface and buried at what is now IRP Site 35. The depth of the burial pit is unknown. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil at IRP Site 35 during the 1997 and 2002 preliminary assessments and 2012 site inspection. Groundwater was not evaluated but is expected to be greater than 150 feet below ground surface, based on area well data.\n\nThe Navy submitted no further action status documentation for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the no further action decision and indicated that a determination letter for the site is being developed.\n\nIRP Site 36 – Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track Storage Sheds\n\nIRP Site 36 is located within the Indian Wells Valley, west of Armitage Field in the China Lake Complex. IRP Site 36 was a storage facility for sheds that from 1956 to 1962 stored hazardous chemicals including nitric acid, furfuryl alcohol, aniline, and dimethyl hydrazine. According to records, some were occasionally spilled. The total volume of spills reported was less than 300 gallons, and it has been theorized that 70 percent of these chemicals volatilized on the soil surface. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil at IRP Site 36 during the 2006 preliminary assessment and 2012 site inspection. Groundwater was not evaluated but is expected to be greater than 150 feet below ground surface based on area well data.\n\nThe Navy submitted no further action documentation for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board requested a remedial investigation and additional sampling of both soil and soil gas before a no further action determination could be made. As a result, a remedial investigation will be completed under a future contract.\n\nIRP Site 38 – Cactus Flat Disposal Trenches\n\nIRP Site 38 was reportedly located in the northwestern corner of the China Lake Complex. The site consists of two trenches where, according to early reports, approximately 1,000 cubic yards of inert waste generated during explosives test programs were disposed of from 1968 to 1979. However, according to NAWS China Lake employees interviewed during 1996 and 1999 visits, only one trench, called Excavation No. 2, received wastes. The waste from Excavation No. 2 was hauled off site in 1990. No evidence of hazardous material disposal was observed at the site during the 1996 and 1999 site visits. The 1997 and 2002 preliminary assessments and 2012 site inspection did not identify any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for soil or groundwater at IRP Site 38.\n\nAs a result of historical waste removal and re-grading, the exact location of a historical disposal area has never been identified, and no samples have been collected. As a result, the 2012 supplemental site inspection concluded that no further action is warranted at IRP Site 38. In January 2014, the Navy and regulatory agencies agreed to move forward with a no further action determination, and the site may be included in a future no further action record of decision.\n\nIRP Site 39 – CGEH-1 Geothermal Waste\n\nIRP Site 39 is a former disposal pit located in the Coso Range. In the 1970s, geothermal drilling muds and oily liquid waste were disposed of in an open pit adjacent to an exploratory geothermal well in the Coso Range. The pit and exploratory well were properly closed in 1979, and the well was reportedly sealed in accordance with state requirements. Soil and groundwater samples were not collected at IRP Site 39 because the initial 1997 preliminary assessment found no evidence for releases of contaminants. Therefore, no chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were evaluated or identified.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the no further action decision and indicated that a determination letter for the site is being developed.\n\nIRP Site 42 – Randsburg Wash No. 3\n\nIRP Site 42 is located 20 miles east of the main administration buildings for the Randsburg Wash/Mojave B Complex. IRP Site 42 consists of an unlined pit where about 30 partially filled 55-gallon drums of an unknown fuel were burned in the mid-1970s. The burning was a one-time event, and the site was not used for any subsequent disposal. The pit contained the empty, burned drums. There was no evidence of staining or residual contamination. The 1997 and 2002 preliminary assessments did not identify any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for soil at IRP Site 42. Groundwater was not evaluated but is expected to be very deep based on data for other Randsburg Wash IRP sites.\n\nThe Navy initiated a supplemental site inspection in 2012, which included IRP Site 42. The risk assessments did not identify any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for the site.\n\nThe Navy is currently conducting a site inspection at the site to characterize the nature and extent of contamination, update the risk assessment, and identify future actions. The site inspection report will recommend further steps.\n\nIRP Site 43 – Fire Division Carrier Deck Fire Facility\n\nIRP Site 43 is located in the central portion of the main China Lake Complex within the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of a large concrete pad, known as the Mini-Deck, that was used as a platform where a fire on an aircraft carrier deck could be simulated during firefighting test operations. The Mini-Deck was used intermittently for firefighting tests from at least 1965. Trainees were required to extinguish the fire using aqueous film forming foam. From 1979 to 1987, an estimated 300,000 gallons of wastewater consisting of a mixture of water, uncombusted fuels, and aqueous film forming foam were discharged to an unlined evaporation pond. In 1987, a lined holding pond was constructed and was subsequently removed in 1992.\n\nA 2004 remedial investigation report recommended no further action status and moving the site from the CERCLA program to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act program even though the chemical of concern naphthalene had been identified in soil and naphthalene and benzene had been identified in groundwater. Since the report was finalized, the Navy has chosen to proceed with remedial action for soil and groundwater at IRP Site 43. A 2006 feasibility study recommended a combination of monitored natural attenuation, industrial controls, bioventing, and biosparaging.\n\nMore monitoring wells were installed in spring 2016, and it was concluded that the current site chemicals of concern, benzene and naphthalene, as well as other petroleum-related constituents have persisted at the site. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances was also discovered at the site, so continued groundwater monitoring was recommended.\n\nBecause of the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, IRP Site 43 is being re programmed to include a remedial investigation and feasibility study for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and a proposed plan and record of decision that will include all contaminants at the site.\n\nIRP Site 48 – Weapons Survivability Holding Ponds\n\nIRP Site 48 is located within the Indian Wells valley in the east-central portion of the China Lake Complex. The site consists of two unlined holding ponds that received all the wastewater and fuel generated at the Weapons Survivability Laboratory from 1976 to 1985. Several tests per year that used jet fuel in quantities of up to 300 gallons were carried out at the Weapons Survivability Laboratory. The ponds were still in use from 1985 until 1991 but were lined with concrete. In 1993, the liners were removed, and the areas were backfilled. The soil and groundwater beneath the two former unlined holding ponds were investigated as IRP Site 48. The 1997 preliminary assessment did not identify any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for soil or groundwater at IRP Site 48.\n\nThe Navy is conducting a site inspection at IRP Site 48 to fill data gaps. Surface and subsurface soil samples and groundwater samples will be collected to better delineate the nature and extent of contamination.\n\nThe Navy will develop a site inspection report for IRP Site 48 from the results of the 2020 field investigation and after all analytical data have been received. The report and results will be used as a basis for recommending further actions at the site. Additional investigation will be completed in 2021 in accordance with the basewide per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances site inspection.\n\nIRP Site 52 – Area R Warhead Firing Arena\n\nIRP Site 52 is located in the main China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of a firing arena used as an explosive test area starting in at least 1949. Before 1978, tests that involved firing at drums of jet fuel may have occurred, though these tests could not be confirmed during personnel interviews. Except for the potential use of fuel drums before 1978, no other hazardous materials beyond general ordnance would be expected at IRP Site 52. Soil and groundwater samples were not collected at IRP Site 52 because the initial 1997 preliminary assessment found no evidence for releases of contaminants. Therefore, no chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were evaluated or identified.\n\nAlthough IRP Site 52 was included in the 2018 draft site inspection work plan, the Navy agreed to remove the site from the CERCLA program and place it under the NAWS China Lake Resource Conservation and Recovery Act program because base personnel indicated that the site was still being used for testing.\n\nIRP Site 53 – Area R Laser Laboratory Leach Line\n\nIRP Site 53 is located in the main China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of a laboratory building, a septic tank, and an associated leach line. In 1970, the building was used as an infrared electronics, optical, and chemical laboratory. The building was converted to office use in 1976 and is still an active facility. Initial reports indicated that wastewater containing hazardous materials may have been discharged from the laboratory. Soil and groundwater samples were not collected at IRP Site 53 because the initial 1997 preliminary assessment found no evidence for releases of contaminants, resulting in no identification or evaluation of any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the no further action decision and indicated that a determination letter for the site is being developed.\n\nIRP Site 54 – Area R Slit Trenches\n\nIRP Site 54 is located in the restricted Area R Test Range in the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of two slit trenches reportedly excavated to receive spent Celotex bundles and scrap lumber from tests at the Area R Warhead Firing Arena beginning in 1967. Celotex is a nontoxic, biodegradable material made primarily from cellulose, with minor amounts of starch and bound by paraffin wax. The materials in both trenches were burned at least twice to create space for additional disposal. Photo-processing chemical bottles were found floating in reddish water and were removed in the late 1980s. The site has not been used since 1988. Dioxins and furans were identified as chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for soil at IRP Site 54. No chemicals of potential concern were identified for groundwater.\n\nThe Navy initiated the supplemental site inspection in 2012, which included IRP Site 54. Results of the human health risk assessment identified dioxin in surface and subsurface soil as a potential risk. The ecological risk assessment did not identify any unacceptable risk to ecological receptors. The Navy plans to collect additional samples under a remedial investigation to evaluate the release of dioxins and furans at the site. As part of a remedial investigation at the site, sampling will occur for groundwater, surface and subsurface soils, and suspected asbestos-containing material in the trenches. After the conclusion of fieldwork, a remedial investigation report will recommend further steps.\n\nIRP Site 59 – Armitage Field Warehouse 56 Storage Yard\n\nIRP Site 59 is located in the Armitage Field complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of a warehouse constructed to store tires and brakes. Between 1952 and 1983, materials were stored in the yard west of the warehouse. Some NAWS China Lake employees have said that the yard was also used to store 55-gallon drums containing solvents, hydraulic fluids, and motor oil. Soil and groundwater samples were not collected at IRP Site 59 because the initial 1996 preliminary assessment found no evidence for releases of contaminants, resulting in no identification or evaluation of any chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the no further action decision and indicated that a determination letter for the site is being developed. Additional investigation will be completed in 2021 in accordance with the basewide per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances site inspection.\n\nIRP Site 60 – B-2 Spotting Tower 3 Quonset Hut\n\nIRP Site 60 is located in the western portion of the China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley, near the base boundary. The site is a former hut used as a control tower during flight tests on the B-2 Range. The hut was reportedly buried when the site was abandoned. The foundation for the hut is all that is believed to remain. A pile of wood, tar paper, plaster, particle board siding, and scrap metal found in the wash is believed to be the remains of the hut. No chemicals of concern or chemicals of environmental concern were identified at IRP Site 60.\n\nAs a result of previous investigations, the 2000 supplemental preliminary assessment recommended that IRP Site 60 be classified as an area of no suspected contamination. Although the Navy has pursued a no further action determination, the Regional Water Quality Control Board has requested that groundwater data be collected before no further action status can be considered. Therefore, additional data and potential closure under a no further action record of decision will be pursued.\n\nIRP Site 61 – B-3 Tower Dump\n\nIRP Site 61 is located in the southwestern portion of the China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of a dump used to dispose of miscellaneous debris from about 1952 to 1953. An empty 55-gallon stainless steel drum was also present at the site. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil or groundwater at IRP Site 61.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board stated it was not appropriate for the Navy to base closure rationale on information provided in the unpublished 2005 site inspection report. It was considered not appropriate since the document had not been submitted for review and approval by the Regional Water Quality Control Board. The site may become eligible for no further action status after agency review of the 2005 site inspection report.\n\nIRP Site 62 – B-4 Startup Area\n\nIRP Site 62 is located at the end of the B-4 Range access road and the B-4 track in the Indian Wells Valley. IRP Site 62 consists of an area used as a small machine shop in the early to mid-1950s and as a full-scale machine shop from at least 1980 to 1997. Two Points of Interest were identified within the footprint of IRP Site 62. These are Point of Interest 57, the machine shop, and Point of Interest 58, the oil and gasoline storage shed. Point of Interest 58 consisted of three sheds that were built in 1953 but destroyed by 1987. The location of the sheds is uncertain. Various metals were identified as chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern for soil at the site, and various radionuclides were identified as chemicals of potential concern for groundwater at the site.\n\nThe Navy initiated the supplemental site inspection in 2012, which included IRP Site 62, and confirmed the site risk associated with the site chemicals of potential concern and chemicals of potential environmental concern.\n\nFurther sampling was recommended under the supplemental site inspection to evaluate the extent of metals contamination in surface soil. No further evaluation was recommended for subsurface soil, while further sampling of groundwater was recommended. The Navy will work with the regulatory agencies to define the path forward for IRP Site 62.\n\nIRP Site 63 – Dempsey Dumpster Station\n\nIRP Site 63 is located near the southern boundary of the main China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley. The site consists of a concrete pad that was used to rinse dumpsters. The Dempsey Dumpster Station was used from approximately 1944 to 1965 to rinse out dumpsters after the contents — which potentially including pesticides, oils, paints, and thinners — were dumped at the Pilot Plant Road Landfill. Chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern identified in IRP Site 63 soil include mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, dieldrin, and lead. Groundwater was not investigated at the site. Area well data indicates that groundwater may be greater than 70 feet below ground surface.\n\nIn May 2019, the Navy collected additional surface and subsurface soil samples at IRP Site 63 to address data gaps and undertake further assessments in support of site closure. Based on these results, the recommended approach for IRP Site 63 is to delineate the lateral extent of pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls in the surface samples only.\n\nIRP Site 65 – G-2 Range Gun Mounts\n\nIRP Site 65 is located within the main China Lake Complex in the Indian Wells Valley, northeast of the intersection of Water Road and Pole Line Road, near the China Lake playa. The site is a paved area with concrete pads used for mounting large-diameter guns and missile launch mechanisms, used since 1962 or possibly as early as 1955. Small amounts of hazardous materials were reportedly used to clean and maintain weapons at the site. The gun emplacements have been in this area since at least 1976, and perhaps as early as 1965. Before 1991, small amounts of chlorinated solvents, light oil, hydraulic fluids, and grease were reportedly used to clean and maintain weapons at the site. After 1991, the weapons were steam-cleaned on site, and solvents were not used. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil or groundwater at IRP Site 65.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board requested further groundwater sampling for volatile organic compounds and perchlorate, as well as further information on the weapon steam-cleaning process. The site may be included under a future remedial investigation for sites requiring additional data.\n\nIRP Site 66 – HANS Test Site\n\nIRP Site 66 is located in the Indian Wells Valley, approximately 2,000 feet east of G-2 Tower Road on Burro Canyon access road in the central portion of the main China Lake Complex. The HANS Test Site was constructed in the late 1970s to evaluate the effects of burning composite materials, and especially carbon fibers. Jet propellant 5 was used during these tests and was reportedly contained within an unlined dirt-bermed area at the site. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil at IRP Site 66. Groundwater was not investigated but is expected to occur at a depth greater than 150 feet below ground surface.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board requested the Navy proceed with a remedial investigation for soil sampling at the site to delineate the extent of total petroleum hydrocarbon contamination. The site may be included under a future remedial investigation for sites requiring additional data. Additional investigation will also be completed in 2021 in accordance with the basewide per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances site inspection work plan, which is currently being prepared.\n\nIRP Site 73 – Randsburg Wash Black Powder Assembly Building\n\nIRP Site 73 is located in the Randsburg Wash/Mojave B Complex along an unnamed road northeast of the main administration buildings. The site was used to assemble flash charges for explosives testing from 1952 to 1962. The flash charges contained magnesium powder and black powder consisting of potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal. Black powder loses its explosive potential on contact with water, so the building was hosed down after each charge was assembled. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil at IRP Site 73. Groundwater was not investigated but is expected to occur at a depth greater than 240 feet below ground surface.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the no further action decision and indicated that a determination letter for the site is being developed.\n\nIRP Site 74 – Randsburg Wash Central Site Old Leach Field\n\nIRP Site 74 is located in the Randsburg Wash/Mojave B Complex at the intersection of the Randsburg Wash access road and Gun Line Road. The site consists of a leach field that received discharged sanitary and industrial wastewater from six facilities from 1951 to 1993. Between 1993 and 1996, a paved road was constructed through the leach field. Signs reading “Do not drive in posted area” were posted at the site. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil at IRP Site 74. Groundwater was not investigated but is expected to occur at a depth greater than 240 feet below ground surface.\n\nIn May 2019, the Navy collected additional surface and subsurface soil samples at IRP Site 63 to address data gaps and undertake further assessments in support of site closure. A technical memorandum presenting the results of the investigation is being prepared. Additional investigation will be completed in 2021 in accordance with the basewide per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances work plan, which is currently being prepared.\n\nIRP Site 75 – Randsburg Wash Gas Station\n\nIRP Site 75 is located near the main administration buildings of the Randsburg Wash/Mojave B Complex. The site consists of a gas station constructed in approximately 1951. A 1,500-gallon gasoline underground storage tank and a 300-gallon waste oil underground storage tank were used at the site. The waste oil underground storage tank was removed in 1991 and the gasoline underground storage tank in 1992. The gasoline pumps on the service island and associated piping were also removed at approximately that same time. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified at IRP Site 75. Petroleum constituents at IRP Site 75 were addressed under the NAWS China Lake UST Program, and the site was closed.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board requested the Navy proceed with a remedial investigation for soil gas sampling at the site, explicitly to delineate the extent of contamination in the vapor phase. The Navy will work with the regulatory agencies to establish a path forward for closure of IRP Site 75 under the CERCLA process.\n\nIRP Site 76 – Randsburg Wash Gun Line\n\nIRP Site 76 is located in the Randsburg Wash/Mojave B Complex, east of the main administration area at the end of Gun Line Road. The site consists of an area used by the U.S. Marine Corps from 1943 until 1947 as a firing and bombing range. In 1947, the Navy took over the area, and the site was used to fire bombs from gun emplacements and rocket launchers. The site is now used infrequently and is maintained on a stand-by basis. Before 1978, the guns were cleaned by applying solvents with a brush and then wiping the guns down with rags. After 1978, solvents were no longer used to clean the guns, and the guns were steam-cleaned at a separate facility. No chemicals of potential concern were identified for soil, but lead was identified as a chemical of potential environmental concern for soil at IRP Site 76. Although not investigated at IRP Site 76, groundwater is anticipated to be 240 feet below ground surface or deeper.\n\nIn accordance with a 2017 work plan, the Navy planned to collect additional samples at IRP Site 76 to further assess the site and address data gaps in support of site closure. Surface and subsurface soil samples were to be analyzed for volatile organic compounds and metals. Because of unresolved explosives concerns at IRP Site 76, the field investigation and sampling were not completed. A remedial investigation will be conducted under a future contract.\n\nIRP Site 77 – Sludge Pit\n\nIRP Site 77 is located near the City of Ridgecrest sewage treatment facility in the Indian Wells Valley in the southern portion of the China Lake Complex. The site consists of a pit that was dug in 1986 to temporarily hold oily sludge. Based on the pit’s dimension, it contained an estimated 2,700 gallons of oily material. Interviews with site personnel indicated that the oily material was “road slurry” or “cooking oil.” No other substances were reportedly held in the pit, and the oily material was reportedly removed by vacuum truck shortly after the Navy discovered it, and the pit was filled with native soil. The surface soil at IRP Site 77 has since been disturbed by construction associated with sewage treatment plant operations. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil or groundwater at IRP Site 77.\n\nSubsurface soil samples and groundwater samples were collected to evaluate whether a release had occurred from the sludge pit that might pose a threat to human health or the environment. The 2012 supplemental site inspection concluded that site conditions and analytical data indicate that no further action is warranted at IRP Site 77.\n\nThe Navy submitted documentation for no further action status for finalization in 2015. In February 2018, comments from the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board requested the Navy proceed with a remedial investigation for groundwater sampling at the site, explicitly to further evaluate the presence of total petroleum hydrocarbons and molybdenum. The site may be included in a future remedial investigation for sites requiring additional data.\n\nIRP Site 78 – Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track Old Photographic Laboratory Sumps\n\nIRP Site 78 is located in the southwestern portion of the China Lake Complex within the Indian Wells Valley, near the Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track Control Building. The site consists of sumps that may have been used to discharge photographic wastes from a film processing laboratory between 1955 and 1963. Interviews with site personnel during the preliminary assessment indicated that film was never developed at the Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track, but later interviews did not support the earlier statement. Sometime between 1985 and 1988, the pipeline to the sumps was disconnected and redirected to a septic tank. After this re-routing, no wastes were drained into the laboratory sumps. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified for soil. Groundwater was not investigated but is expected to occur at a depth greater than 150 feet below ground surface.\n\nIn May 2019, additional samples were collected at IRP Site 78 to further assess the site and address data gaps in support of site closure. Four surface and four subsurface soil samples were collected and analyzed for metals, volatile organic compounds, and cyanide. A technical memorandum presenting the results of investigations is in Navy review. The Navy will work with the regulatory agencies to establish a path forward toward no further action.\n\nIRP Site 79 – K-2 1000 Meter Gunnery Range\n\nIRP Site 79 has been deferred from the IRP and from CERCLA, and further action will be taken under the Navy Master Materials License. These actions will include decommissioning the testing areas impacted by depleted uranium in accordance with the Navy Master Materials License requirements.\n\nIRP Site 80 – AOCs and Basewide Programs\n\nIRP Site 80 represents the AOCs that have been identified at NAWS China Lake to date. Although the number of AOCs requiring further action under the IRP is still being evaluated, the majority of the AOCs are in the preliminary assessment and site inspection stage of the remedial process. Several AOCs have been included in OUs and are being addressed along with the IRP sites that are included in them. IRP Site 80 is also used to conduct per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances investigations and support the basewide groundwater monitoring program for programming budgets.\n\nIRP Site 81 – Sandquist Asbestos Dump\n\nIRP Site 81 is located near a former Public Works construction camp, just north of the Supersonic Naval Ordnance Research Track access road. The site is a dump that accepted waste generated at NAWS China Lake only. Limited observations during a preliminary site walk conducted on May 30, 2017, indicate that materials such as inhomogeneous concrete slabs and piles of soil and sand were disposed of on the surface of the site. No chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern have been identified at IRP Site 81 because the preliminary assessment and site inspection for IRP Site 81 have not been completed.\n\nThe ongoing preliminary assessment includes an on-site and off-site reconnaissance of the site. Fieldwork for the site inspection was completed in 2019 and included sampling soil for chemicals of potential concern, including asbestos and typical chemicals associated with surface debris sites. The site inspection report is being prepared and will be published in 2020 or 2021. Both human health and environmental risk assessments will use data from the report, and the results of the investigation will guide future actions.\n\nIRP Site 82 – Skytop Bay 5\n\nIRP Site 82 is located in the eastern portion of Salt Wells Valley and consists of a building within the Skytop test complex. Live and inert ordnance and rockets were burned inside a building at the facility. The building was constructed of steel rebar and wire mesh to contain potential exploding ordnance or rockets during tests. Various types of rockets were routinely tested or detonated inside the building. The chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern identified in the 2018 site inspection risk assessment include dioxins, cadmium, manganese, nickel, copper, and the explosive RDX in soil. Groundwater was not evaluated because groundwater has not been encountered at this site.\n\nBased on the site history and the results of this sampling, the Navy recommended that IRP Site 82 be considered a high-priority for further evaluation. The Navy is currently conducting a remedial investigation at the site with the objective of filling data gaps and updating risk assessments. Additionally, the presence or absence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances will be confirmed at other areas of IRP Site 82, as these compounds were detected during the limited site inspection sampling conducted previously. The remedial investigation fieldwork will be completed in 2020, and the results of the investigation will guide future actions.\n\nIRP Site 83 – Charlie Range Polychlorinated Biphenyl Transformer Dump Site\n\nIRP Site 83 is located in the western portion of the main base, part of Charlie Range. The site was used to store miscellaneous equipment used on Charlie Range. A transformer maintenance site, which was operated in the 1970s, was in the southwestern corner of the compound. A former range employee noted an area that was used for emptying transformers. Potential wastes include polychlorinated biphenyls, waste oils, and solvents. The 2018 site inspection risk assessment identified arsenic, polychlorinated biphenyls, hexavalent chromium, dieldrin, cadmium, and manganese in soil and delta-BHC in groundwater as chemicals of potential concern or chemicals of potential environmental concern.\n\nBased on the results of the previous investigations, the Navy recommended that IRP Site 83 be considered a high priority. Although it is likely that the pesticide compounds detected at IRP Site 83 are a result of routine application, as has been observed at many sites at NAWS China Lake, the polychlorinated biphenyl results indicate that a release occurred. The Navy is currently conducting a remedial investigation at the site. Groundwater as well as surface and subsurface soil will be sampled. The remedial investigation fieldwork will be completed in 2020, and the results of the investigation will guide future actions.\n\nIRP Site 86 – Former Housing Area\n\nIRP Site 86 is a former Navy housing area demolished in the 1990s that now consists of two dirt lots totaling 16 acres. When the housing was demolished, asbestos-containing materials were containerized and disposed of at appropriate off-site facilities, except for some roofing materials that remained on site. Initial sampling took place in May 2018, and further sampling occurred in June 2018. Neither event found any asbestos fibers in any samples. In July 2018, ambient air was sampled at a nearby Child Development Center, where once again no asbestos was detected.\n\nA preliminary assessment report and site inspection work plan for asbestos-containing material are being completed. Fieldwork is planned for 2021.\n\nIRP Site 87 – Former Housing Area\n\nIRP Site 87 consists of eight non-contiguous dirt lots totaling 723 acres that were once Navy housing areas. Like IRP Site 86, the structures were demolished in the 1990s. At the time, asbestos-containing materials were containerized and disposed of at appropriate off-site facilities, except for some roofing materials that are still on site. The sites have not been investigated for asbestos.\n\nA preliminary assessment report and site inspection work plan for asbestos-containing material are being completed. Fieldwork is planned for 2021.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCollapse All Expand All\n\nUST 1 â NAF Gas Station\n\nUST 1 is the site of a former 10,000-gallon tank located at the NAF Gas Station, at the northern end of the airfieldâs fire station. The gas station was constructed around 1945. The tank was removed in 1992, and monitoring wells were installed. Free product was initially reported in two wells near the former tank. Passive free product skimming devices (well socks) were installed at these wells in the 1990s, and by May 2003 only a petroleum sheen was reported in one of the wells.\n\nMonitoring of NAF Gas Station wells continued after 2003, and additional light non-aqueous phase liquid was recovered on an as-needed basis. The total volume of light non-aqueous phase liquid recovered from the former NAF Gas Station wells between 1997 and September 2014 is estimated at 41 gallons. From December 2016 to April and May 2018, light non-aqueous ph"
