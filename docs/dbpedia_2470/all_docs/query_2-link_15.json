King Gill, a basketball player and former member of the Texas A&M football team, was in the stands during the Dixie Classic as the Aggies faced top-ranked, undefeated Centre College. Outgunned and with nearly all players injured, Coach Dana X. Bible called Gill down to the sideline. Gill suited up and stood ready to play throughout the game, forever becoming “the 12th Man” in what was one of the greatest upsets in college football history, with the Aggies winning 22-14. This willingness to serve is tradition at Texas A&M and in 2022, we’ll celebrate the centennial of the 12th Man!\n\n12th Man Centennial\n\nThe 100th anniversary of the birth of Texas A&M’s world-famous 12th Man tradition will be celebrated across Texas A&M Athletics throughout the 2021-22 school year.
