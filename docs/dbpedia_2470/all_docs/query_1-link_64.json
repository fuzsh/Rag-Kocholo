        "text": "The following list publicly identifies up to 100 taxpayers who are delinquent on Rhode Island personal income tax and whose cases are not on appeal.\n\nUsing the best available information, the Rhode Island Division of Taxation has sent formal notice, by regular and certified mail, to each taxpayer on the list, letting the taxpayer know — 30 days in advance — of the Tax Division's intent to publish the taxpayer's name and account information. Each taxpayer on the list, having been notified, has chosen not to pay the delinquency and not to enter into a reasonable agreement to pay the outstanding debt in reasonable installments.\n\nThe list contains each delinquent taxpayer's name, address, and the amount of the delinquency — including interest and penalty. Interest has been accrued through March 13, 2023.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Tax Division at Tax.Collections@tax.ri.gov.\n\nName Address City, State and ZIP Code

You will be provided with the exact amount — including accrued interest — which you must pay in order to have your name removed from this list. If you are unable to pay in full, you may apply for an installment agreement, under which you agree to a reasonable plan to pay your outstanding debt in stages, over time. A fully executed installment agreement in good standing will allow us to remove your name from this list.\n\nThis list includes balances from active accounts receivable that are not on an installment agreement. This list includes transactions recorded at the Tax Division by the date indicated on the listing. Transactions made subsequent to that date will be reflected in the next updated list.\n\nAlthough state law authorizes the Tax Administrator to publish the names of 100 tax delinquents on this list, there may be times when fewer than 100 are included. This may occur for various reasons. For example, when a taxpayer's account information is removed from the list as promptly as possible after that taxpayer pays the outstanding debt, the number of delinquent taxpayers remaining on the list can fall. The Tax Division cannot add others to the list without first following a series of legal and administrative requirements — including the statutory requirement that the taxpayer be given advance notice, in writing, by regular and certified mail.\n\nAuthority to publish this list can be found in Rhode Island General Laws § 44-1-34, which was enacted in 2003 and revised and expanded in 2011.\n\nFrom time to time, the Tax Division removes from the list the names and account information of various taxpayers. By law, the Tax Division cannot disclose why a specific taxpayer's name and account information have been removed. (Please see Rhode Island General Laws § 38-2-2, 44-1-14, and 44-30-95(c).) In general, a taxpayer's name and account information may be removed from the list for various reasons: the taxpayer may have paid the outstanding debt, for example, or entered into an installment agreement. Also, as a general rule, the Tax Division may remove names and related information for various other reasons — such as the death of a taxpayer, or a taxpayer's entering into bankruptcy or receivership.\n\nThe list is updated periodically.\n\nLast update April 15, 2024"
