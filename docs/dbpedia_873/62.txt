Muscat: Joyalukkas jewellery is having a banner year with back to back showroom launches, a brand-new brand ambassador in Kajol Devgan and several awards, including an 8th consecutive Superbrand win under its belt. Never one to disappoint, Joyalukkas is giving back to its loyal supporters with a grand gold coin giveaway in time for the Festival of Lights.

Golden Diwali at Joyalukkas is offering free gold coins on a minimum purchase of jewellery. Customers can also take advantage of guaranteed gold rate protection upon 10% advance payment on the jewellery of their dreams until October 17, as well as enjoy low making charges.

“For Joyalukkas Group, Diwali 2017 is truly a time of thanks, giving,” said Joy Alukkas, chairman & MD, Joyalukkas Group. “We’re not only celebrating 30 years of being the world’s favourite jeweller and an ever-growing presence across the globe, it’s also our first major campaign featuring Kajol Devgan. Golden Diwali is our way of thanking the millions of patrons who have made each achievement, each new showroom possible.”

Making the promotion even more special is a limited edition festive collection featuring a glittering selection of antique gold and temple jewellery, playful floral inspired Rangeen pieces, as well as traditional mangalsutra sets and contemporary designs in diamond, gold and precious stones.

The Joyalukkas Golden Diwali promotion is available across the brand’s over 130 showrooms in the UK, USA, GCC, India and Asia until October 21.
