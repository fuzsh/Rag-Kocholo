        "text": "✨Power Of Branding✨ I remember feeling perplexed after the class 12th result! 🤷♀️ Deciding what to pursue in undergrad and where to pursue it was a tough decision to make. Someone suggested that I get into \"Delhi University\" without even a second thought, regardless of which campus or course I chose. This experience taught me the value of the name that Delhi University carries with itself. Honestly speaking, the campus and especially the course do make a lot of difference in the long term, but in the short term, it was all about just getting into the \"University of Delhi\". I am not in any way devaluing this prestigious institute of Delhi, but rather emphasizing the importance of the course and the modules that you choose while you make it to Delhi University. Similarly in marketing, Your audience often makes decisions based on the preconceived notion of your brand, rather than getting into the pros and cons that a particular brand comes with. That is where \"Brand Value\" takes over all your doubts. It is all about how you position your business in the market 🔆 Your audience is ready to make a decision!! But are you ready to establish your business as a valuable brand? 💭 I am open to listening to some interesting insights if any of you think otherwise. Comment below or connect with me in my DM at Rachita Malhotra📍 #delhiuniversity #marketing #branding #personalbranding\n\nI must commend Pia Baker 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾for her outstanding work. Pia and I began our illustrious careers in brand marketing at Unilever back in 2003. Her track record as a superstar in this field is undeniable. 👊🏾 As an educator, I strive to provide my students with practical assignments that mirror the responsibilities of an ABM (Associate Brand Manager). Although it's been several years since I've been actively involved in a corporate setting, my extensive network proves invaluable 😤. Recently, I engaged Pia and other esteemed former colleagues to gather insights into the current projects undertaken by ABMs in the consumer packaged goods industry. Pia's recommendation to have students conduct a trend analysis 📈on a specific industry was particularly enlightening 💫. Let me tell you 🤗, my second-year MBA students exceeded expectations with their exceptional work! They conducted insightful 🧠analyses on industries such as running 🏃🏽 , remote work 👩🏽💻 , contraception methods 🧑🧑🧒🧒, autonomous vehicles 🚙, and beauty products 💋💄foundations. See 👀my attachment. For students who seek genuine real-world experiences, I am the professor you need🙋🏽♀️. However, if you shy away from challenging tasks and high expectations (informed by my collaborations with top marketers globally), then perhaps my approach may not suit you ❌. There's no room for idle tasks in my curriculum. Every assignment 📝 is designed to prepare students for a successful career 💰. I provide the platform; it's the student's responsibility to articulate 🗣️the invaluable experiences gained under my guidance. #nocomparison #imabeast #teachingmyyoungerself #wishidknown #interviewing #experiences #marketing #caumarketing #parmethod\n\nWhat is the best college for Marketing in India? Established in 1991, it is the only residential institute in the Asia-Pacific region, dedicated to creating leadership in Strategic Marketing and Communication. It is a Fulbright Affiliate Institute as well as an approved and accredited partner of the Chartered Institute of Marketing, UK. Well, well, well If marketing is your cup of tea MICA | The School of Ideas is the place where you need to be. In this week's episode of the Mba series Saarthak and I engage in an insightful conversation shedding ample light on the nuances of the PGDM program offered here. The 3 key takeaways from our hour long discussion are: 1) The unique GE a) Enact a skit on a recent happening of great significance b) Draft a whatsapp circular for senior citizens helping them out with instructions for using UPI. These are just a few of the many unique group exercises that applicants are put through during the evaluation stage. 2) Academic Rigor The second year is relatively difficult and students might as well miss out on the luxury of having a weekend to themselves.Also, the optionals offered here allow a student to specialize in a very specific niche like say brand management and advertising. 3) Placements Marketing strategy and Brand management are a couple of domains where close to half the batch lands a job. Obviously with Sales and research roles to follow. For all this and a lot more on marketing, all you need to do is click on the link below https://lnkd.in/gFranx6z PS: The campus is spread over 19 acres in the suburbs of Ahmedabad. 19 Acres is a little too much:) PPS: The college also happens to organize one of the biggest marketing festivals of the country Micanvas! Mica is truly all things marketing! #cat2024 #mba2024 #indianjobs\n\n🎓 Excited to share that I have successfully completed the \"Brand Management\" course offered by Indian Institute of Management Bangalore on the SWAYAM MHRD portal! This course was an incredible journey, guided by the brilliant Prof. Preeti Krishnan Lyndem (Ex-IIMB Visiting Faculty). Her expertise and engaging teaching style made complex concepts easy to understand and apply. I am deeply grateful for her dedication and the knowledge she showcased. Through this course, I explored various facets of brand management, such as: • The importance of brand equity and how it adds value to products. • Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) and its strategic advantages. • Real-world examples like Starbucks brand journey and Toyota Motor Corporation's rebranding efforts in Europe. • Key models like the AIDA model and the CBBE pyramid by Kevin Lane Keller. The experience was truly enriching and eye-opening, providing practical insights that I can apply in my career. A big shout-out to SWAYAM MHRD for democratizing education and making such high-quality courses accessible to everyone for free. It's empowering to see education being made available to all, breaking down barriers and fostering growth. 🌐 If you're looking to upskill or just eager to learn something new, I highly recommend checking out the courses on SWAYAM MHRD. You won't be disappointed! #BrandManagement #Brand #IIMB #Swayam #NPTEL #Gratitude #ProfessionalGrowth #LinkedIn\n\nI’m a big believer in continuously adding to my skill set and challenging my notions of what makes for effective brand and marketing practices. Just as people and the world are always changing, so must the ways businesses interact with them. From April through last week, I took on the Marketing Week Mini MBA with Mark Ritson. A cheeky, experienced and insightful marketing and brand pro with a mouth like a sailor and a treasure trove of case studies, Mark Ritson led a course that was exactly what I hoped for. It was packed with deep dives into important (often neglected) areas of brand management, relevant and valuable data, and learnings that I was immediately able to apply in my day-to-day work. Not only was there lecture and reading material, but we also had an opportunity to test our mettle in a five-year brand simulation — which was a satisfying and humbling experience, to say the least. One of the things I appreciated most was Mark's urging throughout the course for us to develop our own conclusions about the information we were presented with. Not to take it at face value, but to really sit with it. On completing the course, not only do I feel more confident in my abilities, but more grounded in my personal perspective on the elements of effective brand strategy/management and their potential as a force for growth. I highly recommend the program, and will be returning to claim a seat for the Mini MBA in Marketing as soon as I’m able 🧑🎓 You can learn more about the course here: https://lnkd.in/gbz-cVfh #brandmanagement #marketingeducation #MWminimba\n\nSpoke at Deshbandhu College Today! Be it talking to teachers or presenting something on stage. I would mess it up! Stammering had killed my self esteem. Fast forward to 12th of October. I was speaking on stage in front of 150 people. Didn't stammer a bit. Answered all questions with clarity and valuable insights. I shared the panel with my two great friends Palakh and Sachin. And we had soo much funn! I'm grateful to the Marketing Society of Deshbandhu College for having me onboard as a speaker! Mind you, they brought Royal Enfield as a sponsor for this event. That was cool. Loved this on stage appearance to bits! Looking forward to more such opportunities :) PS. While on the campus tour, I realised Deshbandhu is one of the better maintained colleges in all of DU!\n\nDear Connections I'm excited to share my recent participation at the International Conference on Management Research (ICMR'2023) organised by the DoMS, IIT Madras, where I presented my paper on \"Influencer Marketing & Sustainable Brand Awareness: Consumer Behaviour for FMCG Products.\" This research delved into the intricate details of influencer attributes, uncovering how specific traits significantly influence consumer attitudes and perceptions in the dynamic FMCG sector. From trustworthiness to relatability, each attribute played a crucial role in shaping consumer decision-making. Furthermore, we delved into the profound impact of various celebrity attributes on consumer attitudes. Surprisingly, authenticity and relatability emerged as key drivers, significantly shaping consumers' perceptions of FMCG products. Understanding these dynamics provides a strategic roadmap for companies aiming to establish authentic connections with their audience. I express my sincere gratitude to SP Jain School of Global Management - Dubai, Mumbai, Singapore & Sydney, and my mentors Sanjukta Srivastava and Monica Chaudhary for their collaborative efforts in this research endeavor. Their expertise and guidance have been quite instrumental in my learning journey. A big thank you to Indian Institute of Technology, Madras for providing a platform to explore and share insights on these critical aspects of marketing. As these insights become the compass guiding my professional journey, I'm excited about shaping tomorrow's marketing narrative. The roadmap ahead involves applying these learnings, not merely as knowledge but as a catalyst for positive change in the realms of sustainable brand building and ethical consumer engagement. #InfluencerMarketing #ConsumerBehaviour #FMCG #BrandAwareness #Sustainability #IMCRConference #IITMadras"
