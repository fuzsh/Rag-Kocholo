Behind every brand, there is a rich history and a unique set of circumstances that have shaped its identity and contributed to its success. These background stories have become an integral part of the brand, and they serve as an essential tool for building brand loyalty and connecting with customers. There are various brands that you think you know about, but do you really know them? In this series of articles, we will be telling you unknown stories behind the known brands.\n\nHailing from the town of Thrissur, Joy Alukkas embarked on a journey that transcended borders, with the UAE becoming the crucible of opportunity for this brand. In 1988, driven by positive reports about the Dubai market and the absence of home-grown styles for the expatriate Indian population, the first “Joyalukkas” store was established in Abu Dhabi.\n\nChallenges faced by the Mr. Alukkas, prompted strategic moves, marked by the renaming of the business to “Joyalukkas”. Despite the odds, the audacious goal of envisioning 100 showrooms across 10 countries, with a staggering turnover of $1 billion by 2010, materialized by 2008, marking the onset of a remarkable four-decade journey where “Joyalukkas” not only endured but thrived.\n\nToday, “Joyalukkas” stands tall as a premier privately-owned jewellery brand and a global powerhouse meticulously crafted by Joy Alukkas. Pioneering the corporatization of the jewellery industry in the early nineties, Joy transformed an unorganized sector into a platform that influenced industry giants like Kalyan, Malabar, and GRT. “Joyalukkas”, with its private ownership, has been a trailblazer in organized retailing since 1988, showcasing sustained double-digit growth over 35 years.\n\nThe brand succeeds because it prioritizes customers, adjusting while staying true to its core beliefs. The vision includes opening bigger, more luxurious showrooms in India, expanding to new areas, and a strong dedication to hospitality. The decision to separate international and Indian operations shows a strategic blend of business and personal values, leading to a network of 160 showrooms in 11 countries.\n\nIn this volatile and ever-changings world, Mr. Joy Alukkas and “Joyalukkas” Group stand as a beacon of adaptability, resilience, and unyielding determination. Their journey continually raises the bar for themselves and those around them, symbolizing not just a jewellery brand but a testament to the enduring spirit of visionary entrepreneurship. With a global footprint and a commitment to trust quality, and innovation, “Joyalukkas” remains a shining jewel in the crown of Indian jewellery retail."
