        "text": "The company\n\nFounded in 2007, Rasvihar is a family-owned customized jewellery manufacturer based in Chennai, India. With an extensive design bank of over 10,000 unique designs, each offering multiple variants, they boast a collection of 40,000 to 50,000 exquisite jewellery products. Customers have the option of visiting the store and personalizing their chosen design with their choice of metal, gemstones, or style.\n\nWhat sets Rasvihar apart from others in the industry is their streamlined design process and commitment to ensuring timely delivery within 14 days. Their specialized team of 17 members, comprising 10 studio-based professionals and 7 skilled artisans, seamlessly executes these custom designs with an integrated manufacturing setup.\n\nThe challenges\n\nEmbracing remote work: The COVID-19 lockdown imposed its share of difficulties, instilling an urgency to transform their archaic practices. One significant obstacle was the necessity to physically be present in their office to process anything, access order statuses, or address pending orders with vendors. This reliance on a physical presence hindered their ability to adapt to remote work and caused unnecessary delays in fulfilling customer demands.\n\nManual data analysis: Manual data analysis was another hurdle for Rasvihar. With thousands of documents, discerning which vendor produced how many pieces of a particular product or identifying their top-performing customers for strategic planning led to a lack of data insight to improvise their decision-making process.\n\nScaling routine operations: As Rasvihar upscaled, routine operations like shipping and customer information management became increasingly challenging to handle. The limitations of paper-based processes were now standing in the way of their progress, stifling their ambition for greater efficiency and success.\n\nThe solution\n\nAmidst the lockdown, Akshat Jain began exploring digital solutions to address their challenges. After experimenting with other tools, he stumbled upon Zoho Creator, due to its affordable pricing and feature-rich capabilities. The company developed a comprehensive application called Rasvihar Order Management to streamline their entire business process.\n\nThey also partnered with Incquet Solutions, a seasoned Zoho Creator Partner. With its expertise in assisting businesses through various technologies, Incquet Solutions helped Rasvihar with complex integrations. The app integrated different modules to automate the process, including:\n\nInquiry system\n\nThis module serves as the entry point for potential customers expressing interest in their designs. When an inquiry is received from any platform, this module allows them to promptly record and manage all details related to the lead.\n\nQuotation tool\n\nWhen a lead shows interest in a particular design, the quotation module allows them to swiftly create and send quotations. Zoho Creator's flexibility to integration lets them fetch live metal prices from association websites. This helps ensure accurate and competitive pricing for customers. By eliminating manual price updates, Rasvihar can promptly respond to inquiries, enhancing customer satisfaction.\n\nSales order processing\n\nThis module serves as a vital link in their order management process. When a customer confirms an order, this module captures all relevant details, including product specifications, quantities, and delivery preferences. The information is seamlessly communicated to the production team, ensuring a smooth workflow from order confirmation to delivery.\n\nVendor management\n\nThe vendor management module is the central hub for managing interactions with vendors. It allows Rasvihar to assign orders to specific vendors, track the production status, and ensure timely deliveries. With nearly 40 data points recorded during this process, Rasvihar gains valuable insights into vendor performance and production efficiency. This module ensures seamless collaboration with suppliers, streamlining the procurement process and ensuring delivery within a 14-day time frame.\n\nInvoicing system\n\nThe invoicing system simplifies the billing process by generating accurate invoices. With it, the accounting team can effortlessly create and send invoices to customers, including all relevant details, such as product prices, quantities, and payment terms. By automating the invoicing process, Rasvihar minimizes errors, saves time, and maintains a seamless flow from order completion to payment.\n\nShipping module\n\nThis module streamlined their logistics and delivery process. When an order is ready for shipment, this module automates coordination with shipping companies through an API integration. With just a click, shipment details are sent to the courier company, and Rasvihar receives an immediate docket number in response. This automated process eliminates the need for manual communication, enhancing their customer service by providing real-time tracking information and a seamless experience for their customers.\n\nBenefits & ROI\n\nThe adoption of Zoho Creator brought significant benefits to Rasvihar's operations. Firstly, it enabled them to achieve end-to-end order management within a single, user-friendly app. This streamlined approach allows the entire team to efficiently track, manage, and analyze orders from the initial inquiry to successful shipment.\n\nSecondly, a powerful CRM tool, built using Zoho Creator, allows Rasvihar to track valuable data on leads and customer retention. This data-driven approach facilitates targeted marketing efforts, leading to enhanced customer engagement and loyalty.\n\nLastly, the app's comprehensive dashboard provides insightful business analytics, and empowers management to set targets, assess performance, and identify areas for continuous improvement. This improved their decision-making process and significantly contributed to Rasvihar's overall success.\n\nLooking forward\n\nRasvihar has exciting plans to enhance its operations, including integrating Zoho Creator with Shopify, their ecommerce backend. This smart integration focuses on streamlining product inventory management and automatically processing orders between the two platforms. This will help them avoid manual data entry, boost efficiency, and ensure smooth and seamless transactions for their valued customers."
