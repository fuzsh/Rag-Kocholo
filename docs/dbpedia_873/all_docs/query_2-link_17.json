        "text": "Walkaroo, India’s one of leading footwear brand has announced Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan as its new brand ambassador and is set to launch an ambitious integrated marketing campaign to highlight its extensive range of products. This development marks a significant step in Walkaroo’s strategy to enhance its brand presence and connect more effectively with consumers across India.\n\nThe decision to appoint Dhawan as the face of Walkaroo aims to strengthen the brand's appeal among younger and fashion-conscious audiences. Dhawan’s dynamic personality and modern style are expected to resonate with the younger generation, reinforcing Walkaroo’s commitment to staying relevant in a competitive market.\n\n“We are very happy to have Varun Dhawan join us in our commitment towards promoting a healthier and active lifestyle through walking. His youthful energy and stylish persona resonate perfectly with our brand image,” said V Noushad, Managing Director, Walkaroo International Pvt Ltd.\n\n“This brand resonates with individuals across all age groups and is a renowned household name. With its campaign, ‘Walk, Walk, Walk; Walk with Walkaroo’, the brand encourages people to adopt walking as a simple remedy to stay active and healthy,” Dhawan commented on his appointment.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023-24, Walkaroo reported a remarkable turnover of Rs 2,140 crore. The company has built a robust distribution network with 700 dealers and over 100,000 retail outlets across India, showcasing its extensive market reach and operational strength. This new partnership with Dhawan is expected to further bolster Walkaroo’s market presence and drive continued growth.\n\nHonasa Consumer Ltd, renowned for its popular FMCG brands such as Mamaearth and The Derma Co, has reported a robust financial performance for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 2024. According to a regulatory filing released on Friday, the company has achieved a significant 62.9 percent increase in its consolidated profit after tax (PAT), which now stands at Rs 40.25 crore. This marks a substantial improvement from the PAT of Rs 24.71 crore reported in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, highlighting a strong upward trend in profitability.\n\nIn addition to the impressive growth in PAT, Honasa Consumer also demonstrated a notable increase in revenue. For the quarter ending June 2024, the company’s revenue from operations grew by 19.28 percent, reaching Rs 554.05 crore. This increase is substantial compared to the revenue of Rs 464.48 crore recorded during the same period last year. This revenue growth underscores the company's effective market strategies and the growing popularity of its brands, contributing to its overall financial success.\n\nDespite these positive financial indicators, the company’s total expenses for the quarter saw an increase as well. The total expenses rose by 17.42 percent, reaching Rs 520.38 crore. This rise in expenses reflects the company's ongoing investment in its operations and expansion strategies, which are essential for sustaining growth and enhancing market presence.\n\nMoreover, Honasa Consumer’s total income for the June quarter witnessed a 20 percent increase, amounting to Rs 572.77 crore. This growth in total income further reinforces the company's strong financial performance and its ability to effectively manage its revenue streams despite rising costs.\n\nOn the stock market front, however, Honasa Consumer’s shares experienced a decline. On Friday, the company's stock closed at Rs 473.60 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), marking a decrease of 4.58 percent from the previous day’s closing price.

This launch marks HUFT's ambitious move to revolutionize pet nutrition and secure its position as a category leader in the expanding market.\n\nWith the Indian pet food market projected to reach between $1.8 billion and $2 billion by 2030, reflecting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.5 percent, the introduction of Hearty is timely. The product's launch aligns with a broader trend of increasing awareness among Indian pet parents about the importance of health and nutrition for their pets. Hearty's introduction is expected to tap into this growing demand, particularly in metropolitan Tier I and Tier II cities where pet ownership is on the rise.\n\nHUFT has strategically positioned Hearty as a premium product, yet priced it competitively to expand its market reach. The brand's growth trajectory is already impressive, having expanded nearly 2.5 times faster than the market in the last fiscal year. HUFT aims to capture a 10 percent share of the Indian pet food market by FY25, with a target to become a Rs. 500 crore brand within the first three years of Hearty's launch.\n\nThe Hearty line is distinguished by its incorporation of Indian super herbs such as Ashwagandha, Tulsi, Moringa, Giloy, and Turmeric, known for their health benefits. This unique blend, along with a high content of real meat (60 percent) and fresh ingredients (up to 40 percent), sets Hearty apart from other products in the market, which often rely on by-products and contain less than 10 percent fresh content. The formula focuses on four key components essential for canine health: premium proteins and Omega fatty acids, fiber from high-quality vegetables and grains, and a diverse blend of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.\n\nSamarth Narang, CEO, HUFT stated, “The pet food market in India is growing at a CAGR of 10.5 percent every year. Currently, it stands at 800 million Dollars. This has been largely dominated by age-old foreign brands and at Heads Up For Tails we realised the need to have an Indian brand that can be a market disruptor in a large sense. It took us many years to perfect the hearty recipe. Prioritizing health and nutrition for pets Heads Up For Tails aims to capture 10 percent share of the Indian market by FY25. There haven't been any major innovations in the past decade in the Dry food industry and we feel there is a greater need to change that. With Hearty, Heads Up For Tails has manufactured the machinery to change the way how kibble has been made over the past many decades. This allows us to deliver a much better product that does not compromise on quality and also since it is manufactured and packed in India, it helps us deliver the freshest batch to the end customer. Heads Up For Tails aims to be a 500 CR brand in the first 3 years of its launch.”\n\nRashi Narang, Founder, HUFT added, “India has been experiencing double-digit growth year after year with increasing demand for affordable yet specialized pet food products. Hearty is not just another dry food brand; it represents our pledge to provide pets with the nutrition they deserve. Our meticulous research, careful ingredient selection, and thoughtful packaging all reflect our dedication. Hearty is a testament to our promise to deliver excellence to our pets. Heads Up for Tails has grown in Food sales by over 46 percent compared to last year. Last FY Heads Up For Tails crossed the highest-ever Food Sales in this respective category closing the year at 650 Million Food Sales. This year, it is already on track to cross this figure and is positively aiming to cross the 1000+ Million Mark in Revenue for Food Sales through Heads Up For Tails.”\n\nSince its launch in June, Hearty has seen over 50 percent month-on-month growth and is expected to continue this trend as HUFT aims for significant market share growth. The brand's focus on pet food, which currently contributes to about 43 percent of HUFT's overall business (60 percent including treats), underscores its strategic importance in the company’s growth plans.\n\nWith Hearty, HUFT is not just meeting the evolving needs of Indian pet parents but is also setting new industry standards, reaffirming its leadership in the pet care industry.\n\nHonasa Consumer Ltd has announced its financial performance for the quarter ending June 30, 2024.

Since its establishment in 1854, Timex has proudly embodied the spirit of American ingenuity, revolutionizing the centuries-old watchmaking industry by creating quality, accessible watches, and establishing a legacy of innovation.\n\nThe brand's history is rich with moments of challenging the status quo, from making timekeeping accessible to the masses with innovations like brass movements and mass assembly lines, to moving watches from the pocket to the wrist with the introduction of the “watch that made the dollar famous.” Timex continued to break new ground by transforming women’s timepieces into fashionable accessories rather than just heirlooms. The brand’s innovative spirit was evident when they tested their watches live on television, invented the first NASA-certified smartwatch, launched it into space, and introduced the first sports watch—a tradition that continues today as Timex remains a prominent player in the sports watch category.

GCPL plans to invest Rs 500 crore in GPC over five years, with Godrej Agrovet Limited (GAVL) serving as the manufacturing and R&D partner. Operations are expected to commence in the second half of FY 2026.\n\nSudhir Sitapati, MD and CEO of GCPL said, “We started the year with healthy volume growth in our key geographies of India and Indonesia. In India, we delivered an organic volume growth of 8 percent and reported volume growth of 10 percent. The performance was broad-based across Home Care and Personal Care. In Indonesia, we continue to deliver robust performance with 7 percent volume growth. In organic terms, Africa, USA, and the Middle East sales declined by 10 percent in constant currency terms while 25 percent in Rs terms due to depreciating Naira. However, offtakes continue to remain strong. This translated in organic consolidated revenue declining by 1 percent while in constant currency terms sales was up by 11 percent. Our quality of profits has been improving consistently over the last few quarters with reported consolidated gross margin improving by 230 bps year-on-year. Our EBITDA margin, too, improved by 310 bps year-on-year.\"\n\nSitapati added, \"Today, we are announcing the formation of Godrej Pet Care (GPC), a subsidiary of GCPL. Pet foods is already a Rs 5,000 crore category with many decades of late teens growth ahead. To give a perspective, only ~10 percent of Indians own a pet of which only 10 percent feed packaged food and that too only 40 percent of the time. Calorie conversion in India is only 4 percent. China, which was remarkably similar to India 15 years ago, has 20 percent pet ownership with a calorie conversion of 25 percent. While the opportunity is clear, we believe that our right to win as a group is high. GAVL, our group company, is the market leader in animal feed and has a good understanding of pet foods R&D, with competitive advantages in supply chain. GCPL will invest the entire capital of Rs 500 crore in GPC over a period of 5 years, post which we see GPC becoming cash flow positive. GAVL will be our manufacturing and R&D partner. Lead times to set up capex are long, and we hope to commence manufacturing in the second half of next year.\"\n\nBusiness Update – India\n\nPerformance Highlights: Q1 FY 2025 India organic sales grew by 6 percent, volume grew by 8 percent, EBITDA grew by 8 percent, and net profit without exceptions and one-offs grew by 5 percent.\n\nHome Care: Grew by 8 percent with stable low-single-digit growth in Household Insecticides, double-digit volume growth in Air Fresheners, and strong double-digit volume growth in Fabric Care.\n\nPersonal Care: Grew by 6 percent with stable volume growth in Personal Wash, strong double-digit growth in Magic Handwash, and double-digit growth in Shampoo Hair Colour.\n\nBusiness Update – Indonesia\n\nSales grew by 11 percent in constant currency terms and 3 percent in Rs terms.

The company's e-commerce segment performed robustly, showing significant growth in digital sales compared to the previous quarter.

The combined entity targets annual sales of 1 trillion KRW (approx. Rs 6000 crore) through a series of investments.\n\nAs the first step under the One India initiative, Lotte Wellfood revealed plans to establish a new ice cream production facility for Havmor in Pune, Maharashtra, with an investment of Rs 400 crore. This expansion will extend the company's reach from western to south-central India.\n\nChang-Yeop Lee, CEO of Lotte Wellfood stated, “With the launch of One India, we aim to solidify Lotte's brand presence and secure growth momentum in the Indian market. Our long-term vision includes substantial investments in India, a key emerging market with the world's largest population and robust economic growth. The merger of our Indian subsidiaries is a strategic move to enhance management efficiency and maximize synergy. Beyond strategic growth, our focus is on strengthening the local Lotte brand through diversified product portfolios and the integration of logistics and production bases.

Both brands will retain their identities for seamless operations. The merger is expected to be completed by the second half of this year, with the integrated entity launching early next year.

Our foray into the aerospace business, following the acquisition of MPPL (Maini Precision Products Ltd), is showing promising signs with its strong performance in the first quarter.\"\n\nThis statement underscores the company’s strategic diversification and its successful initial steps in new business areas.\n\nIn Q1FY25, Marico Limited reported revenue from operations of Rs 2,643 crore, reflecting a 7 percent year-on-year increase. The growth was driven by a 4 percent volume increase in the domestic business and a 10 percent constant currency growth in the international business. The overall FMCG volume trends in India showed gradual improvement, with rural areas showing more promise than urban. Both Home and Personal Care (HPC) and Foods segments saw growth, with the premium segments outperforming the mass segments.\n\nDomestic revenue reached Rs 1,962 crore, marking a 7 percent year-on-year increase. This was supported by price hikes in the Coconut Oil portfolio, which offset the residual impact of pricing cuts in the Saffola Oils portfolio. Over 90 percent of Marico's key portfolios either gained or maintained market share and penetration on a moving annual total (MAT) basis.\n\nDuring the quarter, Marico executed Phase 1 of Project SETU in six states, expanding direct coverage in urban and rural markets. The initial results were promising, and the company plans to scale up Phase 1 markets and expand into more states during FY25.\n\nThe international business maintained its double-digit constant currency growth, with each key market contributing to the broad-based growth. Gross margin expanded by 230 basis points year-on-year, and advertising and promotion spending increased by 13 percent. EBITDA margin stood at 23.7 percent, up 50 basis points, with EBITDA growing by 9 percent. The profit after tax (excluding one-offs) rose by 12 percent due to a lower effective tax rate, while reported PAT growth was at 9 percent.\n\nMarico expects gradual growth in its core domestic categories through initiatives to enhance profitability and expand direct reach under Project SETU. The company aims to grow its Foods portfolio at a 20-25 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to double FY24 revenues by FY27. The digital-first portfolio is projected to achieve an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of Rs 550-600 crore by the end of FY25 and double FY24 ARR by FY27.\n\nThe international business, which has shown resilience despite macroeconomic challenges, is expected to maintain double-digit constant currency growth. Marico aims to deliver revenue-led earnings growth in FY25, driven by improved domestic volume growth, favorable pricing cycles, and healthy international business momentum.\n\nSaugata Gupta, MD and CEO of Marico stated, “The new fiscal has started on a promising note for both the domestic and international businesses with revenue growth visibly turning a corner. We expect to sustain the improving trajectory in the core domestic business on the back of consistent market share and penetration gains coupled with the ongoing initiatives to revive growth in traditional trade and expand direct reach under Project SETU. We will also maintain a steadfast focus on the profitable scale-up of the Foods and Digital-first brands. The international business has been veritably consistent over the last few years and is expected to maintain its double-digit constant currency growth momentum. We will aim to deliver on each of the key performance parameters and drive healthy revenue-led earnings growth in the near and medium term.”\n\nThis comprehensive approach to growth and market expansion underscores Marico's strategic vision for its retail and international businesses, setting a robust foundation for sustained performance in the coming years.\n\nAllcargo Group, an India-born global logistics conglomerate, has appointed Ketan Kulkarni as Deputy Managing Director of Gati Express and Supply Chain Pvt.

This collaboration is aimed at advancing Mars Wrigley India's sustainability goals by reducing carbon emissions and enhancing its renewable energy usage. The partnership supports the company's target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAs part of this initiative, CleanMax will implement a combined total of 6.2 MWp of offsite and onsite solar projects tailored to the energy needs of Mars Wrigley India's manufacturing facilities. A notable project includes a 4 MWp offsite solar installation, which will supply renewable energy to Mars's plant in Pune through CleanMax's Akot Farm in Maharashtra. Additionally, onsite solar projects will contribute to Mars Wrigley India's energy independence and reinforce its commitment to sustainable operations.\n\nTamer Kadry, Country General Manager at Mars Wrigley India stated, “At Mars Wrigley India, sustainability is at the core of our operations. Our collaboration with CleanMax marks a pivotal step in our journey towards achieving our 2050 net zero emissions goal.

We continue to innovate and uphold sustainable practices from our factories to the end use of our products, ensuring minimal to no negative impact on the environment.”\n\nThe renewable energy projects are expected to significantly impact both the environment and local communities. These projects will reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 119,000 tCO2e over their lifespan and will produce around 9.3 GWh of renewable energy annually. This energy production is comparable to the environmental benefit of planting approximately 400,000 trees.\n\nMars Wrigley India’s efforts align with its broader sustainability commitments, as outlined in the Mars Sustainable in a Generation Plan, which supports various UN Sustainable Development Goals. This plan includes initiatives to expand renewable energy usage, promote water conservation in agriculture, eliminate deforestation, and advance circular economy principles in product packaging.\n\nKuldeep Jain, MD of CleanMax said, “Joining hands with Mars Wrigley India in their sustainability efforts is a moment of pride for us.

The move marks a significant step in the company's strategy to reach a revenue target of Rs 650 crore by 2028.\n\nGaurav Sekhri, Managing Director of both Fratelli Wines and Tinna Trade India, which is facilitating the listing through a reverse share swap, provided insights into the company's strategic direction. Sekhri explained that Tinna Trade, a farm commodity trader listed on the BSE, acquired Fratelli Wines Pvt Ltd in March through a share-swap deal.\n\nDespite India's low per capita wine consumption, Sekhri highlighted significant changes over the past decade. Consumption has shifted from predominantly rural areas to urban centers, with cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, and Vijayawada now showing increased interest in wine.\n\nFratelli Vineyards reported a gross turnover of about Rs 247 crore in FY24, with 70 percent of the revenue coming from luxury, super-premium, and premium segments. The company achieved a 25 percent growth rate over the past four years, compared to the industry average of 15 percent. Sekhri pointed out that Fratelli's strongest areas are the luxury segment, with wines priced above Rs 2,000, and the ready-to-drink wine-in-a-can category. The company's EBITDA margin stood at 13 percent, amounting to Rs 28.6 crore.\n\nThe company has made notable strides in its luxury segment, launching products like Sette and J'noon, which have set new standards in pricing and quality for Indian wines. Over the past four fiscal years, Fratelli's gross revenue has nearly doubled, with a significant recovery starting in FY22 following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFratelli currently produces around five lakh cases annually and plans to increase this capacity to 15 lakh cases. The company operates four wineries across Maharashtra and Karnataka, with a total capacity of 4.7 million liters. Sekhri emphasized that Fratelli is the first in Asia to produce white wine from red grapes (Sangiovese Bianco).\n\nSekhri explained the rationale behind the company's decision to list Fratelli Wines via IPO, noting that it was increasingly difficult to justify maintaining a trading business alongside the wine operations. The share swap with Tinna Trade will allow Fratelli Wines to become a publicly listed entity, marking the end of Tinna Trade's trading activities.\n\nAccording to spirits consultancy IWSR, India's wine market is projected to grow at 10 percent annually until 2027. The consumption of wine increased by 19 percent in volume in 2022, while other beverage categories also saw notable growth.\n\nV-Mart Retail Ltd. has announced a notable financial turnaround for the first quarter ending June 2024, reporting a profit of Rs 12.14 crore.

This increase reflects the retailer's successful strategies and growth in its business operations.\n\nV-Mart's total expenses for the June quarter amounted to Rs 781.40 crore. Breaking down the revenue sources, the company earned Rs 774.50 crore from its core retail trade activities. In addition, it garnered Rs 11.58 crore from its digital marketplace, Limeroad, indicating a growing presence in the online segment.\n\nDespite the positive earnings report, V-Mart Retail's stock saw a decline on Monday. The shares closed at Rs 3,248.80 each, marking a decrease of 5.26 percent from the previous close. This drop in stock price contrasts with the company's strong quarterly performance, reflecting the broader market dynamics and investor sentiment.\n\nThe significant improvement in V-Mart's financial results highlights the company's effective management and growth strategies during the quarter. It also underscores the challenges and fluctuations in the stock market, even when a company delivers impressive earnings and revenue growth.\n\nSAJ Food Products Pvt. Ltd has announced that the Calcutta High Court has granted an ex-parte injunction preventing Parle Biscuits from selling and marketing their new biscuit product under the brand name \"TOP GOLD STAR.\"\n\nBisk Farm has been using the \"TOP GOLD\" mark for one of its biscuit products since 2005 and has secured statutory protection through trademark and copyright registrations. SAJ is the sole entity registered and/or applied for the \"TOP GOLD\" mark with the Trademark Registry. Recently, it was observed that Parle launched a new product in the same category under the name \"TOP GOLD STAR.\"\n\nBisk Farm asserted that it is the prior and only registered user of the \"TOP GOLD\" mark in Class 30 as of this date. Parle's use of \"TOP GOLD STAR,\" with 'TOP' and 'GOLD' in larger font and 'STAR' in smaller font, is structurally, phonetically, and deceptively similar to Bisk Farm's \"TOP GOLD\" mark and is used for identical goods, i.e., biscuits. Bisk Farm argued that this constitutes a clear act of passing off and approached the Calcutta High Court to restrain Parle Biscuits from using the \"TOP GOLD STAR\" mark.\n\nOn 19th July 2024, Hon'ble Justice Krishna Rao issued a stay order preventing Parle from selling and marketing their product under the \"TOP GOLD STAR\" brand name until 27th August 2024.\n\nVijay Singh, MD of Bisk Farm stated, “We have a distinguished history of introducing distinct biscuits, each marked by its own unique identity, all of which have been well-received by consumers. We are determined to protect our intellectual property rights and brand integrity which has been carefully built over two decades by our late founder K.D.Paul. We are thankful to the honorable court for issuing an ex-parte protective order against this action of trademark infringement by Parle.”\n\nFlipkart's fashion vertical head, Arief Mohamad, is set to exit the company, with his role being assumed by Myntra's CEO, Nandita Sinha. Sinha, who successfully led Myntra to achieve EBITDA-level profitability earlier this year, will now oversee the fashion division of Flipkart, Myntra's sister company. Despite Sinha's leadership, both Flipkart and Myntra, owned by Walmart, will continue to operate independently.\n\nA Flipkart group spokesperson confirmed the change stating, “Nandita has been instrumental in driving the growth of numerous businesses within the Flipkart ecosystem. Under her leadership, Myntra has solidified its position in the fashion industry, while also paving its path for the next phase of growth. Flipkart Fashion and Myntra will continue to operate independently under Nandita’s leadership as she guides the broader strategic direction for Fashion.”\n\nSinha, a Flipkart veteran with over eight years at the firm, took the helm at Myntra in January 2022. Mohamad, who has been with Flipkart for nine years, has led various verticals, including mobile business customer growth, and loyalty.\n\nMohamad’s departure follows a series of senior leadership changes at Flipkart under group CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy. On May 24, the sources reported that Flipkart had appointed Prathyusha Agarwal as vice president and head of Shopsy, following the exit of senior vice president Adarsh Menon. On May 20, It was reported that Anuj Rathi was appointed as the new CEO of Flipkart's travel booking unit Cleartrip, succeeding former CEO Ayyappan R and former CFO Aditya Agarwal.\n\nOther senior vice presidents, including Amitesh Jha, who led the marketplace and categories, fintech and payments head Dheeraj A, and growth and retention head Bharath Ram, have also left the company in recent months. In January, Flipkart was implementing performance-based staff reductions across all verticals, impacting 5-7 percent of its workforce, including vice presidents in engineering and product.\n\nBSH Home Appliances Pvt.

This funding has reduced the size of the public issue from Rs 185 crore to Rs 148 crore.\n\nAs reported in Financial Express on August 5, 2024, Baazar Style Retail undertook a private placement of 9,56,072 equity shares to Volrado Ventures Partners Fund II at Rs 387 per share, which includes a premium of Rs 382 per share.\n\nAccording to the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) filed in March 2024, the public issue consists of a fresh issue of up to Rs 185 crore and an offer for sale of up to 16.88 million shares by the promoter group and other selling shareholders, with a reservation for eligible employees.\n\nFounded in Fiscal 2014, Baazar Style Retail has expanded rapidly from 2 stores in one state to 153 stores across 1.39 million square feet in 140 cities across 9 states as of December 31, 2023. It has been the fastest-growing value retailer from 2017 to 2023 in terms of store count and revenue, with the highest EBITDA margin for Fiscal 2023 according to a Technopak Report.\n\nThe company’s brand, ‘Style Bazaar,’ has built a strong customer base through a diverse product range, fostering loyalty and recognition. Its growth is attributed to a cluster-based expansion model, high-street stores, a wide product assortment, and strategic location selection, particularly in Eastern India, which is noted for its rapid growth in value retail.\n\nAxis Capital Limited, Intensive Fiscal Services Private Limited, and JM Financial Limited are serving as the book-running lead managers, with Link Intime India Private Limited as the registrar of the issue.\n\nTitan, the leading jewelry retailer and watchmaker, announced a 5.42 percent decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 715 crore for the quarter ending June 2024. This compares to a net profit of Rs 756 crore for the same period last year.\n\nDespite the profit drop, Titan saw a 12.64 percent increase in sales, reaching Rs 12,223 crore, up from Rs 10,851 crore in the corresponding quarter, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nTotal expenses for the quarter rose by 12.75 percent to Rs 12,413 crore.

The segment experienced a 20 percent retail growth in the first six weeks of the quarter, which included Akshaya Tritiya. However, Titan noted that “Q1 saw multiple forces coming together that impacted topline. A steep rally in gold rates (20 percent increase over Q1FY24), election-led restrictions in many markets, very few wedding dates, and an unprecedented heat wave across the country weighed on overall consumer demand.”\n\nThe company expanded its international footprint with a new Tanishq store in Muscat, Oman, bringing its total to 17 international stores. In India, Tanishq opened 11 new stores, Mia added 19, and Zoya opened three, including its first locations in Chennai and Pune.\n\nRevenue from Watches & Wearables rose 12 percent to Rs 1,023 crore.
