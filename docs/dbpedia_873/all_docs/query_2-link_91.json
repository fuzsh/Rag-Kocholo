This is why, it is important to be aware of a few factors.\n\nPurity of Gold\n\nHigher the purity of gold, the more valuable it will be. Before you make a purchase, make sure you learn about its purity. In the Indian market, gold jewellery is typically sold in 18-karat, 22-karat, or 24-karat purity. Hence, check accordingly.\n\nHallmark\n\nThis is another important factor that plays a crucial role in choosing gold jewellery. Always look for a hallmark stamp which indicates the purity and authenticity of the gold.\n\nCertification\n\nIf you are planning to buy gold as an investment, you should ask for a certification of authenticity from agencies like the Bureau of Indian Standards. It provides the guarantee of purity and authenticity which in return makes it easy to sell or exchange gold in future.\n\nOther Factors\n\nOther than the above-mentioned factors, pay attention to design, making charges, and the reputation of the seller to ensure you make the right decision.\n\nMaking Charges for Jewellery\n\nMaking charges of jewellery refer to the cost of the labour and the skills involved in its crafting. It also includes the additional cost associated with the design and production. In India, the making charges for jewellery are not fixed and can vary based on factors such as the intricacy of the design, the quantity of gold used, and the proficiency of the artisans.\n\nWhile some jewellers may quote lower making charges, others may charge a premium amount for their experience and reputation. As making charges are an additional expense on top of the jewellery’s price, it is recommended to compare prices from different jewellers and ensure that you are paying a fair price for the jewellery.\n\nTips to Buy Jewellery Smartly\n\nIf you want to purchase jewellery wisely, here are some tips that you must keep in mind. This will help you make a purchase with care and consideration.\n\nSet a Budget\n\nThis is the first and foremost step before you start shopping for jewellery. Considering how much you can afford, you must set a budget and stick to it. This will help you avoid spending more than you are willing to.\n\nDo your research\n\nTo begin with your jewellery shopping, you must do your part of the research to ensure that you get your hands on the right product. Familiarise yourself with the type of jewellery, its quality, pricing, and styles. Also, look for reputable jewellers with good reviews and ratings to get an incredible purchasing experience.\n\nLook for deals and discounts\n\nFor making a smart purchase, this is the most crucial tip to keep in mind. You must always look for deals and discounts before you go ahead and shop. During certain times of the year, some jewellers offer sales or promotions and are able to negotiate a lower price. This will help you get the best value for money for your purchase.\n\nInspect the jewellery\n\nThis is another tip that is generally neglected by most buyers. Before you finalise your purchase, inspect the jewellery for defects or damages. Look for the clasps, settings, and stones to ensure that it is in good condition.\n\nFinal Word\n\nThe right piece of jewellery can transform your look and make you feel even more beautiful than you already are.
