        "text": "Following on from Annabell Parry’s fantastic talk at INSEC last week titled ‘A jewellery market update’… Annabell highlighted the value of gold and its effect on the jewellery retail market. We wanted to raise awareness of the Cartier LOVE Bangle - the standard yellow gold plain brushed bangle created in New York in 1969 – an iconic piece of jewellery still around today! Retailing at £3,000 in 2008 and £5,250 in 2014, the same bangle today would cost £7,050 to replace! Do you or your client own one of these? Today, the yellow gold LOVE bangle set with 10 brilliant cut diamonds totalling 0.96 carats will cost £16,400 – a value over some single policy thresholds! The diamond-paved LOVE bangle set with 2 carats of diamonds retails for £42,400. We see so many of these bracelets, but are they valued correctly? As values change, it is so important you get all your jewellery valued, especially if you haven’t had an update in the last two years. If not, you could find that you or your clients are underinsured. Annabell is one of our amazingly talented and knowledgeable Jewellery and watch specialists. Doerr Dallas Valuations has the largest jewellery & watches specialist team of any valuation business and covers the UK, Ireland, Europe, UAE or anywhere we need to go!
