        "text": "SPREADING JOY Part 2 Continues…. Every chapter of the book is interconnected, and the book forms a cohesive whole. You will not be able to grasp chapter 7 unless you thoroughly read chapter 4 and every chapter segues seamlessly into the next. Through story narrations I and Thomas Scaria laughed, became teary eyed, got bouts of anger, learnt history, and last but not the least relearnt once again that ‘everything is possible’ through sheer persistence. The stories touch on different aspects such as the growth of the jewellery industry through the 20th and 21st centuries as well as the evolution of the brand Joyalukkas and Joy Sir’s journey and learnings. All these elements have been integrated into the story to make the book an engaging read.The narration is true to Joy sir’s style. Being attuned with his business and talking passionately about it ,is Joy sir’s biggest strength. On the last day of interviews, Joy sir asked me if I have learned anything from him. I would say a thousand times ‘A Lot’. Just like him, I deeply believe that one needs to have deep passion about his/her craft and always have a forgiving not forgetting attitude. I and Thomas Scaria relived the crucial junctures of his extraordinary journey. Through this book, which is published by HarperCollins Publishers India ,Harper Business we are excited to extend the invitation to all of you to feel inspired too. Thank you notes: I have lot to thank my coauthor Thomas, who complemented my soft spot for sentiment and a good story with his logic and attention to detail. I couldn’t have moved an inch without his mastery of history and his in-depth understanding of the industry and the protagonist. A special note of thanks to Sachin Sharma Anantha Padmanabhan who believed in the story from day one.
