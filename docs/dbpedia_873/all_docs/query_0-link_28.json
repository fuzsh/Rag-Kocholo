        "text": "As of January 2022, India’s gold and diamond trade contributed ~7% to India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The gems and jewellery sector has employs ~5 million. Based on its potential for growth and value addition, the Government declared the gems and jewellery sector as a focus area for export promotion.\n\nThe Government has undertaken various measures recently to promote investment and upgrade technology and skills to promote ‘Brand India’ in the international market. The Government has permitted 100% FDI in the sector under the automatic route, wherein the foreign investor or the Indian company do not require any prior approval from the Reserve Bank or the Government of India. The Indian Government also signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in March 2022, this will allow the Indian Gems and Jewellery industry to further boost exports. CEPA will provide the industry with duty-free access to the UAE market. India’s Gems Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) aims to triple its exports to the UAE post the CEPA.\n\nIndia’s gems and jewellery market size was at US$ 78.50 billion in FY21. Growth in exports is mainly due to revived import demand in the export market of the US and the fulfilment of orders received by numerous Indian exhibitors during the Virtual Buyer-Seller Meets (VBSMs) conducted by GJEPC.\n\nIn FY24, India's gems and jewellery exports were at US$ 22.27 billion, a 14.94% decline compared to the previous year's period. Exports of gems & jewellery at stood at US$ 2074.85 million in April 2024.\n\nIn the coming years, growth in the gems and jewellery sector would largely be contributed by the development of large retailers/brands. Established brands are guiding the organised market and are opening opportunities to grow. Increasing penetration of organised players provides variety in terms of products and designs. Also, the relaxation of restrictions on gold import is likely to provide a fillip to the industry.\n\nThe improvement in availability along with the reintroduction of low-cost gold metal loans and likely stabilisation of gold prices at lower levels is also expected to drive volume growth for jewellers over the short to medium term. India has 450 organised jewellery manufacturers, importers & exporters and is the hub for jewellery manufacturing. These players have benefited greatly due to the increasing liberal policies by the government. The demand for jewellery is expected to be significantly supported by the recent positive developments in the industry. India’s gems and jewellery industry is expected to reach US$ 100 billion by 2027."
