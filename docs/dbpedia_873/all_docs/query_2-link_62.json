Gold has traditionally been associated with wealth and prosperity, whereas jewelry has long played a significant role. India is the world's second-largest consumer of gold due to its cultural significance, particularly during religious and socially significant celebrations like weddings, festivals, and other occasions. For instance, the bride typically wears hefty gold jewelry during the wedding ceremony and weddings (across all communities and religions) as a symbol of her family's wealth and status.\n\nMoreover, the market has grown significantly as a result of the high demand for weddings. In fact, the Indian wedding industry is thought to be worth USD 50 billion, with jewelry accounting for a significant portion of this total. Similarly, people buy gold jewelry during festivals like Diwali, Dussehra, and Akshaya Tritiya because they believe days like these to be lucky. As a result, demand for gold jewelry (and gold prices) rises during such auspicious occasions. According to the World Gold Council, during the holiday season in 2020 compared to 2019, the demand for gold increased by 35%. Hence, such factors will spur the growth of the market during the forecast period.\n\nSignificant India Jewelry Market Trends\n\nThe rise in online sales is an emerging trend in market growth. Online jewelry sales are rising as more people choose to buy jewelry online due to its convenience and a large selection of goods. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend and led to an increase in online shopping. One of the top jewelry brands, Tanishq, for instance, reported a 106% increase in online sales in 2020, with the online channel accounting for 13% of its total sales.\n\nMoreover, the competitive pricing on e-commerce platforms, which enables customers to compare prices and make informed decisions, is another factor contributing to the increase in online sales. In the upcoming years, the trend is also expected to persist, with a noticeable shift in the market's emphasis on online sales. In conclusion, the trend of online jewelry sales is being driven by the convenience and wide range of products available online. Hence, such factors will boost the market growth and trends during the forecast period.\n\nMajor India Jewelry Market Challenge\n\nThe high gold prices are major challenges impeding market growth. Given that gold is the primary component of Indian jewelry, it can be challenging for jewelers to offer customers jewelry that is affordable given the ongoing fluctuations in gold prices. As jewelers struggle to keep their prices for their products competitive during times of high gold prices, sales of gold jewelry suffer. The high price of gold also causes a shift in consumer purchasing patterns, favoring lighter, more affordable jewelry, which has an impact on sales of traditional heavy gold jewelry.\n\nAdditionally, it is anticipated that during the forecast period, the price of gold will increase due to inflation and economic unpredictability, causing fluctuations in gold prices. Given that Indian consumers still favor gold jewelry, this poses a significant challenge for the country's jewelry industry. Hence, such factors will likely hinder the growth of the market during the projection period.\n\nGet a detailed analysis of drivers, trends, and challenges Request Free PDF Sample !\n\nIndia Jewelry Market Segmentation\n\nBy Type\n\nThe market share growth by the gold segment will be significant during the forecast period.
