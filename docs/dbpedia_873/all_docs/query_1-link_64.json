He also added that “I believe in ‘sharing a touch of joy’ whenever the situation demands it or when we come across a cause that we feel can be bettered in any way possible.”\n\nThe 10th anniversary celebrations were inaugurated by Superstar Shri. Suresh Gopi at Taj Gateway. Joyalukkas Group also honoured individuals for their contributions to the society, with the awards being handed by Superstar Shri. Suresh Gopi. Shri. Tony Chammany, Mayor of Cochin Corporation inaugurated the Blood Donation Campaign and Shri.Hibi Eden, MLA unveiled the Joyalukkas Foundation Souvenir at the event.\n\nJoyalukkas Foundations operation is managed by its own team of employees who have volunteered their services towards the cause. “Our philosophy of ‘Share a touch of joy’ is what guides me and my team,” said Jolly Joy Alukkas, Director, Joyalukkas Group who spearheads the Joyalukkas Foundation activities.\n\nThe Foundation has contributed towards various causes spanning education, medical, city projects, blood donations, airfare for amnesty seekers, homes for underprivileged, financial assistance and more. The contributions have also extended to causes like ‘CRY OF THE POOR’ project in Africa. The Foundation is also associated with various NGOs to assist their work. “The reason we are celebrating the Joyalukkas Foundation’s 10th Anniversary is so that we make people aware of our various CSR activities which hopefully attract like minded people to join us in this noble cause or this awareness will help us reach out to more people who are in dire need of some form of assistance,” said P.P. Jose, Executive Director, Joyalukkas Group."
