        "text": "NEW DELHI, Oct. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Spreading Joy captures a phenomenal entrepreneurial story that provides rare insights into a predominantly fragmented and unorganized industry.\n\nPublished by Harper Business\n\nHardback | Non-Fiction | 256 pp | INR 699\n\nAvailable wherever books are sold | Releasing worldwide on 29th October 2023\n\n\"Joy Alukkas is the perfect embodiment of the tireless entrepreneurial spirit that shaped the United Arab Emirates. His vision and leadership have built Joyalukkas into a brand that is loved and respected across the world and contributed to the long-standing commercial and cultural ties between the UAE and India. It is certain that his story, through his autobiography, will be applauded globally.\"\n\n- H.E. Dr Thani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of State for Foreign Trade, UAE\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\nThrissur, on the coast of Kerala, is known as India's 'gold town'. It was here that Puthussery Alukka Joseph Varghese moved into jewellery retail from his umbrella business in the late 1950s. One of his fifteen children, Joy Alukkas, seemed to have inherited his father's entrepreneurial spirit. In 1986, the quest for his personal El Dorado took Joy to the modern 'city of gold': Dubai.\n\nGetting to know the lay of the land, including aspects of procurement, staffing, sales, and other regulations, exacerbated by the language barrier, was a challenge that could dampen any entrepreneur's spirit, but Joy persisted and opened the first 'Alukkas' jewellery store in Abu Dhabi, followed soon after by another in Dubai. Just as business was taking off, the Gulf War broke out in 1990, disrupting every aspect of life and forcing Joy to return to India. Not only did a resilient Joy go back to the Gulf some months later, but he also re-established the Alukkas footprint, opening stores within and around the UAE. In the next two decades, he expanded his business to eleven countries with more than 160 outlets and revolutionized the gold-retailing business with innovations such as the use of the karat meter, the first billing software in the industry and board rate for gold price, to mention a few. Throughout the years, the ethos of his business has remained the same: to be the 'customer's favourite jeweller'.\n\nSpreading Joy not only captures a phenomenal entrepreneurial story but also provides rare insights into an industry that has predominantly been fragmented and unorganized. Aspiring entrepreneurs, irrespective of the industry they operate in, will find this book of immense value as they build their dream organizations.\n\nJoy Alukkas says, \"Our brand, Joyalukkas (single-owned largest jewellery retail in the world) has not been an overnight success. The legacy started by my father, Alukka Joseph Varghese, in 1956 marks 35 years of strong impression in UAE this year. Over these years, we continue to receive love, trust, recognition and applause from our customers and business associates across the globe. 2023 will be ending on yet another exciting note, as I feel more than ready for the very first time to share the journey of my trials and tribulations, and how with consistency and perseverance all that resulted in the bestowed glory today. My book Spreading Joy is dedicated to my father. I hope that my autobiography truly uplifts each one of you reading it and encourages you to develop a never-give-up attitude. I would like to sincerely thank HarperCollins for releasing the book worldwide.\"\n\nThomas Scaria and Nidhi Jain, co-authors of Spreading Joy say, \"'Joy Sir', as we fondly refer to him, cooperated fully in the writing of this book, and gave us total creative freedom. Nothing was off-limits. He encouraged everyone who contributed to speak honestly. He was himself remarkably candid. His family, friends, competitors, and colleagues together gave us an unexpurgated view of the passion, perfectionism and artistry that shaped his approach to business and resulted in the creation of the brand Joyalukkas. We have done our best to do justice to his story and portray the extraordinary life of an extraordinary man.\"\n\nSachin Sharma, Associate Publisher, HarperCollins says, \"In the Indian subcontinent, there are more than 180,000 independent jewellery retailers. Most of them are in their second or third generation, managing mostly one or two stores. How did Joy Alukkas create one of the largest jewellery store chains in the world? Not only that but how did he manage to become his 'customer's favourite' jeweller? Spreading Joy is an extraordinary tale of grit, resilience and above all, a happy-go-lucky entrepreneurial spirit. This is a book that will inspire you to make your big leap in business and life.\"\n\nPRAISE FOR THE BOOK\n\n\"I have witnessed the growth of Joy and the Joyalukkas group over the decades. With dedication, credibility and humility, he has worked very hard to shape Joyalukkas into a global entity. I am sure his autobiography will inspire not only this generation but also the ones to come.\"\n\n- Yusuff Ali M.A, Chairman and MD, Lulu Group International\n\n\"Joy Alukkas's autobiography is a compelling read that offers valuable insights into leadership, brand-building and the single-minded pursuit of a goal through consistency, grit and determination.\"\n\n- L.V. Navaneeth, CEO, The Hindu Group\n\n\"I have known Joy for quite some time. His success in establishing his brand Joyalukkas across eleven countries is a remarkable feat of leadership. I am sure that many entrepreneurs across the globe will be curious to read how the man himself has been standing tall in such fierce competition for so many decades. Much success.\"\n\n- Nikhil Kamath, Co-Founder, Zerodha\n\n\"Torchbearer of the brand Joyalukkas, Joy is recognized as a great visionary leader in the UAE. 'Spreading Joy', the title of his book simply denotes the love that customers have for his brand across the globe. I wish nothing less than great success for his book.\"\n\n- Abdul Hamid Ahmad, CEO and Editor-in-Chief, Gulf News\n\n\"Joy Alukkas has garnered immense admiration for his remarkable journey in the jewellery business. His unwavering determination, meticulous attention to detail, and supreme self-confidence have propelled him to become one of the leading gold retailers in the world. We extend our best wishes to him, and we are sure this autobiography will inspire generations of readers across the globe.\"\n\n- Malayala Manorama\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\n\nJoy Alukkas is the founder and chairman of the eponymous global retail brand Joyalukkas Jewellery.
