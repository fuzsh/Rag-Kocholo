        "text": "The gems and jewelry sector plays a big role within the Indian economy, contributing around 7% to the country’s GDP and 15% to India’s total merchandise export. It employs over 4.64 million people, which is predicted to succeed in 8.23 million by 2022. one among the fastest-growing sectors, it's extremely export-oriented and labor-intensive.\n\nBased on its potential for growth and value addition, the govt declared the gems and jewelry sector as the attention area for export promotion. The government has undertaken various measures recently to market investment and upgrade technology and skills to market ‘Brand India’ within the international market.\n\nThe pandemic had resulted in widespread disruption of worldwide supply chains and caused a big slowdown in international demand and therefore the G&J sector, by virtue of being within the luxury goods category, may take an extended period to revive to pre-COVID levels.\n\nThis sector, while contributing a serious portion to India's export basket also plays a critical role in terms of employment generation. With around 5 million people working during this sector, embodying an enormous pool of skilled manpower, the world may be a major driver of the Indian economy. However, there exists an enormous potential for higher growth in terms of increased output, higher value addition, and therefore the possibility of moving up the worth chain.\n\nWe plan to analyze a number of the factors affecting the industry today and therefore the need for critical policy drivers for unlocking truth potential. The industry in its present form is fragmented and unorganized, leading to a scarcity of knowledge on workers and units. a serious focus area should thus be the initiation of reforms for better organization of the industry.\n\nDue to the highly unorganized market, workers who are the core of the Indian G&J sector can't be given due focus in terms of providing essential living facilities; and migration of such workers are often fatal for the industry when things normalize. Lack of social sector schemes for such fringe workers is making things worse and can dissuade people from staying back or fresh ones from joining the world .\n\nThere are more than 5.5,000+ Jewelry Companies in India and over 18,000+ Jewelry Companies in the United States.\n\nMajor players operating in the Indian gems and jewelry market are expanding their product portfolio and are customizing jewelry as per consumer demand. Malabar Gold Private Limited, Titan Company Limited, Kalyan Jewellers India Private Limited, PC Jewellers Limited, and Gitanjali Gems Limited are a few of the leading market players.\n\nThe top 10 Jewelry companies in India are the following:\n\nTitan Company Ltd (Tanishq)\n\nHari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd\n\nKalyan Jewellers India Ltd\n\nKiran Gems Pvt Ltd\n\nMalabar Gold Pvt Ltd\n\nPC Jeweller Ltd\n\nAsian Star Company Ltd\n\nRajesh Exports Ltd\n\nTribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri Ltd\n\nVaibhav Global Ltd\n\nLet's have a look at the list of Jewelry Companies in India with their key decision-maker contact Information."
