The Oak Bay Avenue location opened in 1961 (a year after the Douglas Street location) and, although not quite in Oak Bay, immediately became the social centre for Oak Bay students out cruising on Friday and Saturday evenings.

It allows farmers and ranchers to socialize and compete with their produce and livestock. Victoria began its tradition of agricultural exhibitions in 1861 when it began holding annual fairs at different locations throughout the city. In 1883 a permanent building was constructed in Beacon Hill Park where a provincial fair was held every second year, alternating with New Westminster. The pressures of urban growth in the late 1880s thwarted expansion plans in the Park and, wanting to host an annual fair, it was decided to relocate beyond the city limits. Land was purchased at \"The Willows\" in Oak Bay where a magnificent exhibition hall was constructed in 1891. The Willows Fair continued into the 1940s. see Willows Fair, Horse Show Pavilion Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAlbert's Barber Shop\n\n2006 Oak Bay Avenue (1932... city directory) Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAlfred White confectioner\n\n2205 Oak Bay Avenue (1932... city directory)\n\nPrevious location of Harry Edwards, baker Subsequent location of Henry Usher, confectioner\n\nPhotos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAline's ladies' ready-to-wear\n\n1179 Newport Avenue (19481949 phone books) Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAllenby Street\n\nsee Street/Place Names section\n\nAnderson Hill (Blueberry Hill)see Street/Place Names section\n\nAndre's Tea Room\n\n2225 Oak Bay Avenue (19471948 city directories) Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAnnandale\n\n1897 \n\n1587/95 York Place 1897/98 home of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper1\n\nOak Bay Archives\n\nAnnandale\n\nClick on image to view enlargement\n\nsee Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper Profile under development\n\nAnscomb, The Honourable Herbert\n\n18921972 reeve of Oak Bay (19251927) / mayor of Victoria (19281931) / cabinet minister in the provincial government (19411952) Herbert Anscomb was born in England in 1892 and emigrated to Canada in 1911. Arriving in Victoria he found work as a bookkeeper with the Victoria Brewing Company. Before long he was managing the company, although a tea-totaller himself. In 1925, at the age of 33, he became the youngest reeve of Oak Bay where he served for 3 years. In 1928 he became mayor of Victoria and served in this capacity until 1931. He entered provincial politics in 1938 and served in the wartime coalition government of John Hart. After the war he served as Finance Minister and developed the reputation as an ultra conservative, introducing the first provincial sales tax in 1948.1 Although disillusioned by the hypocrisy in politics, Anscomb served conscienciously in the political arena for 27 years as \"one of the last of the real conservatives.\" Herbert Anscomb is remembered in Oak Bay by Anscomb Place\n\nAnscomb Place\n\nsee Street/Place Names section\n\nArden\n\n1176 Beach Drive 1902 home of Ada (Pemberton) and Hugo Beaven Ada Beaven was Joseph Despard Pemberton's daughter.

The Sappers built roads and bridges, and enforced British law upon rumbunctuous American goldseekers in the Fraser canyon. At the end of his service, in 1863, Argyle opted to accept a land grant of 150 acres at Rocky Point in Metchosin where, in 1867, he became the keeper of the Race Rocks lighthouse until his retirement in 1888. On July 10, 1871 he purchased the Willows Hotel, Oak Bay's first commercial establishment, then located on Cadboro Bay Road at Willows Road (Eastdowne). see Willows Hotel\n\nAristocrats, Victoria ice hockey team19131917, 19191922 Victoria team denied 1914 Stanley Cup in Oak Bay arena\n\nVictoria Aristocrats\n\nProfessional ice hockey began in Victoria in 1912. The first game was played between the Victoria Senators and the New Westminster Royals in Oak Bay's Patrick Arena on January 2, 1912. This was the first hockey game in Canada played on artificial ice.\n\nThe Victoria Senators changed its name to the Victoria Aristocrats for the 1913/14 season and won the Pacific Coast League championship, earning the right to challenge the Quebec Bulldogs (the then-current Stanley Cup holders). With home ice advantage at Oak Bay's Patrick Arena, the Aristocrats won the championship but were denied the Stanley Cup as it was deemed, by eastern authorities, to be an exhibition series. But the Aristocrats are recognized as having won the \"World Ice Hockey Championship\" in 1913.\n\nDuring World War I the arena was commandeered by the Canadian government, so the team moved south after the 1916/17 season and became the Spokane Canaries. After the war the team returned to the Oak Bay arena and was once again called the Aristocrats until re-named the Cougars starting from the1922 season until the league folded in 1926. see Victoria Senators, Victoria Cougars Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nArnold's Bakery\n\n2522 Estevan Avenue(...19641970... phone books)\n\n2863 Foul Bay Road(...19641970... phone books)\n\nPhotos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nArmstrong Avenue\n\nsee Street/Place Names section\n\nAshdowne Road\n\nsee Street/Place Names section\n\nAshdowne, Miss V E nursery school\n\n2164 Oak Bay Avenue (...1944... phone book) see Greater Victoria Nursery School Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAshton and Farrow plumbers2205 Oak Bay Avenue (1918... phone book) Oak Bay Branch of Victoria plumbing company\n\nPrevious location of Avenue Meat Market Subsequent location of Harry Edwards, baker\n\nPhotos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAuto Livery & Taxi\n\n1196 Newport Avenue (...1925... phone book) Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAvenue Confectionery\n\n2205 Oak Bay Avenue (19261929 city directories)\n\nPrevious location of Henry Usher, confectioner Subsequent location of Usher's Confectionery Store\n\nPhotos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAvenue Dress Shop\n\n2259 Oak Bay Avenue (19601970... phone books) Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAvenue Electric\n\n2047 Oak Bay Avenue (19481956 phone books)\n\n2006 Oak Bay Avenue (19571960 phone books) Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAvenue Meat Market\n\n2205 Oak Bay Avenue (1915... city directories)\n\nSubsequent location of Ashton & Farrow, plumbers\n\nPhotos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nAvenue Theatre\n\n19141921\n\n2009 Oak Bay Avenue(1914  1917 city directories)\n\n2013 Oak Bay Avenue (1918  1921 city directories)same location an early motion picture theatre\n\nOak Bay Archives\n\nAvenue Theatre\n\n\"...one of the best and most up-to-date\n\ntheatres of its kind in B.C.\"\n\n 1913newspaper ad\n\nBut despite recognizing and embracing the film industry in its infancy, the success of the Avenue Theatre was short-lived.
