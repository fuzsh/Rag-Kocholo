        "text": "These guidelines are designed primarily for North American healthcare providers who are looking for an up-to-date summary for BLS and ALS for adults as well as for those who are seeking more in-depth information on resuscitation science and gaps in current knowledge. The BLS care of adolescents follows adult guidelines. This Part of the 2020 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care includes recommendations for clinical care of adults with cardiac arrest, including those with life-threatening conditions in whom cardiac arrest is imminent, and after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest.\n\nSome recommendations are directly relevant to lay rescuers who may or may not have received CPR training and who have little or no access to resuscitation equipment. Other recommendations are relevant to persons with more advanced resuscitation training, functioning either with or without access to resuscitation drugs and devices, working either within or outside of a hospital. Some treatment recommendations involve medical care and decision-making after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or when resuscitation has been unsuccessful. Importantly, recommendations are provided related to team debriefing and systematic feedback to increase future resuscitation success.\n\nAs with all AHA guidelines, each 2020 recommendation is assigned a Class of Recommendation (COR) based on the strength and consistency of the evidence, alternative treatment options, and the impact on patients and society (Table 1(link opens in new window)). The Level of Evidence (LOE) is based on the quality, quantity, relevance, and consistency of the available evidence. For each recommendation, the writing group discussed and approved specific recommendation wording and the COR and LOE assignments. In determining the COR, the writing group considered the LOE and other factors, including systems issues, economic factors, and ethical factors such as equity, acceptability, and feasibility. These evidence- review methods, including specific criteria used to determine COR and LOE, are described more fully in “Part 2: Evidence Evaluation and Guidelines Development.” The Adult Basic and Advanced Life Support Writing Group members had final authority over and formally approved these recommendations.\n\nUnfortunately, despite improvements in the design and funding support for resuscitation research, the overall certainty of the evidence base for resuscitation science is low. Of the 250 recommendations in these guidelines, only 2 recommendations are supported by Level A evidence (high-quality evidence from more than 1 randomized controlled trial [RCT], or 1 or more RCT corroborated by high-quality registry studies.) Thirty-seven recommendations are supported by Level B-Randomized Evidence (moderate evidence from 1 or more RCTs) and 57 by Level B-Nonrandomized evidence. The majority of recommendations are based on Level C evidence, including those based on limited data (123 recommendations) and expert opinion (31 recommendations). Accordingly, the strength of recommendations is weaker than optimal: 78 Class 1 (strong) recommendations, 57 Class 2a (moderate) recommendations, and 89 Class 2b (weak) recommendations are included in these guidelines. In addition, 15 recommendations are designated Class 3: No Benefit, and 11 recommendations are Class 3: Harm. Clinical trials in resuscitation are sorely needed.\n\nSurvival and recovery from adult cardiac arrest depend on a complex system working together to secure the best outcome for the victim. The main focus in adult cardiac arrest events includes rapid recognition, prompt provision of CPR, defibrillation of malignant shockable rhythms, and post-ROSC supportive care and treatment of underlying causes. This approach recognizes that most sudden cardiac arrest in adults is of cardiac cause, particularly myocardial infarction and electric disturbances. Arrests without a primary cardiac origin (eg, from respiratory failure, toxic ingestion, pulmonary embolism [PE], or drowning) are also common, however, and in such cases, treatment for reversible underlying causes is important for the rescuer to consider.1 Some noncardiac etiologies may be particularly common in the in-hospital setting. Others, such as opioid overdose, are sharply on the rise in the out-of-hospital setting.2 For any cardiac arrest, rescuers are instructed to call for help, perform CPR to restore coronary and cerebral blood flow, and apply an AED to directly treat ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT), if present. Although the majority of resuscitation success is achieved by provision of high-quality CPR and defibrillation, other specific treatments for likely underlying causes may be helpful in some cases.\n\nThe primary focus of cardiac arrest management for providers is the optimization of all critical steps required to improve outcomes. These include activation of the emergency response, provision of high-quality CPR and early defibrillation, ALS interventions, effective post-ROSC care including careful prognostication, and support during recovery and survivorship. All of these activities require organizational infrastructures to support the education, training, equipment, supplies, and communication that enable each survival. Thus, we recognize that each of these diverse aspects of care contributes to the ultimate functional survival of the cardiac arrest victim.\n\nResuscitation causes, processes, and outcomes are very different for OHCA and IHCA, which are reflected in their respective Chains of Survival (Figure 1). In OHCA, the care of the victim depends on community engagement and response. It is critical for community members to recognize cardiac arrest, phone 9-1-1 (or the local emergency response number), perform CPR (including, for untrained lay rescuers, compression-only CPR), and use an AED.3,4 Emergency medical personnel are then called to the scene, continue resuscitation, and transport the patient for stabilization and definitive management. In comparison, surveillance and prevention are critical aspects of IHCA. When an arrest occurs in the hospital, a strong multidisciplinary approach includes teams of medical professionals who respond, provide CPR, promptly defibrillate, begin ALS measures, and continue post-ROSC care. Outcomes from IHCA are overall superior to those from OHCA,5 likely because of reduced delays in initiation of effective resuscitation.\n\nThe Adult OHCA and IHCA Chains of Survival have been updated to better highlight the evolution of systems of care and the critical role of recovery and survivorship with the addition of a new link. This Recovery link highlights the enormous recovery and survivorship journey, from the end of acute treatment for critical illness through multimodal rehabilitation (both short- and long-term), for both survivors and families after cardiac arrest. This new link acknowledges the need for the system of care to support recovery, discuss expectations, and provide plans that address treatment, surveillance, and rehabilitation for cardiac arrest survivors and their caregivers as they transition care from the hospital to home and return to role and social function.\n\nSynopsis\n\nLay rescuer CPR improves survival from cardiac arrest by 2- to 3-fold.1 The benefit of providing CPR to a patient in cardiac arrest outweighs any potential risk of providing chest compressions to someone who is unconscious but not in cardiac arrest. It has been shown that the risk of injury from CPR is low in these patients.2\n\nIt has been shown previously that all rescuers may have difficulty detecting a pulse, leading to delays in CPR, or in some cases CPR not being performed at all for patients in cardiac arrest.3 Recognition of cardiac arrest by lay rescuers, therefore, is determined on the basis of level of consciousness and the respiratory effort of the victim. Recognition of cardiac arrest by healthcare providers includes a pulse check, but the importance of not prolonging efforts to detect a pulse is emphasized.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nAgonal breathing is characterized by slow, irregular gasping respirations that are ineffective for ventilation. Agonal breathing is described by lay rescuers with a variety of terms including, abnormal breathing, snoring respirations, and gasping.4 Agonal breathing is common, reported as being present in up to 40% to 60% of victims of OHCA.5 The presence of agonal breathing is cited as a common reason for lay rescuers to misdiagnose a patient as not being in cardiac arrest.6 In patients who are unresponsive, with absent or abnormal breathing, lay rescuers should assume the patient is in cardiac arrest, call for help, and promptly initiate CPR. These 2 criteria (patient responsiveness and assessment of breathing) have been shown to rapidly identify a significant proportion of patients who are in cardiac arrest, allowing for immediate initiation of lay rescuer CPR. Further, initiation of chest compressions in patients who are unconscious but not in cardiac arrest is associated with low rates of significant adverse events.2 The adverse events noted included pain in the area of chest compressions (8.7%), bone fracture (ribs and clavicle) (1.7%), and rhabdomyolysis (0.3%), with no visceral injuries described.2\n\nProtracted delays in CPR can occur when checking for a pulse at the outset of resuscitation efforts as well as between successive cycles of CPR. Healthcare providers often take too long to check for a pulse7,8 and have difficulty determining if a pulse is present or absent.7–9 There is no evidence, however, that checking for breathing, coughing, or movement is superior to a pulse check for detection of circulation.10 Thus, healthcare providers are directed to quickly check for a pulse and to promptly start compressions when a pulse is not definitively palpated.9,11\n\nThis topic last received formal evidence review in 2010.3\n\nSynopsis\n\nAfter cardiac arrest is recognized, the Chain of Survival continues with activation of the emergency response system and initiation of CPR. The prompt initiation of CPR is perhaps the most important intervention to improve survival and neurological outcomes. Ideally, activation of the emergency response system and initiation of CPR occur simultaneously. In the current era of widespread mobile device usage and accessibility, a lone responder can activate the emergency response system simultaneously with starting CPR by dialing for help, placing the phone on speaker mode to continue communication, and immediately commencing CPR. In the rare situation when a lone rescuer must leave the victim to dial EMS, the priority should be on prompt EMS activation followed by immediate return to the victim to initiate CPR.\n\nExisting evidence suggests that the potential harm from CPR in a patient who has been incorrectly identified as having cardiac arrest is low.1 Overall, the benefits of initiation of CPR in cardiac arrest outweigh the relatively low risk of injury for patients not in cardiac arrest. The initial phases of resuscitation once cardiac arrest is recognized are similar between lay responders and healthcare providers, with early CPR representing the priority. Lay rescuers may provide chest compression– only CPR to simplify the process and encourage CPR initiation, whereas healthcare providers may provide chest compressions and ventilation (Figures 2–4).\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nCPR is the single-most important intervention for a patient in cardiac arrest, and chest compressions should be provided promptly. Chest compressions are the most critical component of CPR, and a chest compression–only approach is appropriate if lay rescuers are untrained or unwilling to provide respirations. Beginning the CPR sequence with compression.2–4 Nationwide dissemination of chest compression–only CPR for lay rescuers was associated with an increase in the incidence of survival with favorable neurological outcome after OHCAs in Japan, likely due to an increase in lay rescuers providing CPR.5 Chest compressions should be provided as soon as possible, without the need to remove the victim’s clothing first.\n\nThe optimal timing of CPR initiation and emergency response system activation was evaluated by an ILCOR systematic review in 2020.1 An observational study of over 17 000 OHCA events reported similar results from either a “call-first” strategy or a “CPR-first” strategy.6 In the current era of ubiquitous mobile devices, ideally both the call to activate EMS and the initiation of CPR can occur simultaneously.\n\nFour observational studies7–10 reported outcomes from patients who were not in cardiac arrest and received CPR by lay rescuers. No serious harm from CPR was found in patients when they were later determined not to have been in cardiac arrest.1 This is in contrast to the significant risk of withholding CPR when a patient is in cardiac arrest, making the risk:benefit ratio strongly in favor of providing CPR for presumed cardiac arrest.\n\nIn some observational studies, improved outcomes have been noted in victims of cardiac arrest who received conventional CPR (compressions and ventilation) compared with those who received chest compressions only.5,11,12 Other studies have reported no difference in outcomes for patients receiving conventional versus compression-only CPR.11,13–21 Given the potential benefit of conventional CPR, if lay rescuers are appropriately trained, they should be encouraged to concurrently deliver ventilation with compressions. A thorough review of the data concerning the ratio of compressions to ventilation when performing conventional CPR is discussed in Ventilation and Compression-to-Ventilation Ratio.\n\nThese recommendations are supported by the 2020 ILCOR Consensus on CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR).1\n\nIntroduction\n\nHigh-quality CPR is, along with defibrillation for those with shockable rhythms, the most important lifesaving intervention for a patient in cardiac arrest. The evidence for what constitutes optimal CPR continues to evolve as research emerges. A number of key components have been defined for high-quality CPR, including minimizing interruptions in chest compressions, providing compressions of adequate rate and depth, avoiding leaning on the chest between compressions, and avoiding excessive ventilation.1 However, controlled studies are relatively lacking, and observational evidence is at times conflicting. The effect of individual CPR quality metrics or interventions is difficult to evaluate because so many happen concurrently and may interact with each other in their effect. Compression rate and compression depth, for example, have both been associated with better outcomes, yet these variables have been found to be inversely correlated with each other so that improving one may worsen the other.1–3 CPR quality interventions are often applied in “bundles,” making the benefit of any one specific measure difficult to ascertain. As more and more centers and EMS systems are using feedback devices and collecting data on CPR measures such as compression depth and chest compression fraction, these data will enable ongoing updates to these recommendations.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe provision of rescue breaths for apneic patients with a pulse is essential. The relative contribution of assisted ventilation for patients in cardiac arrest is more controversial.\n\nThere is concern that delivery of chest compressions without assisted ventilation for prolonged periods could be less effective than conventional CPR (compressions plus breaths) because the arterial oxygen content will decrease as CPR duration increases. This concern is especially pertinent in the setting of asphyxial cardiac arrest. Much of the published research involves patients whose arrests were presumed to be of cardiac origin and in settings with short EMS response times. It is likely that a time threshold exists beyond which the absence of ventilation may be harmful, and the generalizability of the findings to all settings must be considered with caution.1\n\nOnce an advanced airway has been placed, delivering continuous chest compressions increases the compression fraction but makes it more difficult to deliver adequate ventilation. Simultaneous compressions and ventilation should be avoided,2 but delivery of chest compressions without pausing for ventilation seems a reasonable option.3 The use of SGAs adds to this complexity because efficiency of ventilation during cardiac arrest may be worse than when using an endotracheal tube, though this has not been borne out in recently published RCTs.4,5\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlong with CPR, early defibrillation is critical to survival when sudden cardiac arrest is caused by VF or pulseless VT (pVT).1,2 Defibrillation is most successful when administered as soon as possible after onset of VF/VT and a reasonable immediate treatment when the interval from onset to shock is very brief. Conversely, when VF/ VT is more protracted, depletion of the heart’s energy reserves can compromise the efficacy of defibrillation unless replenished by a prescribed period of CPR before the rhythm analysis. Minimizing disruptions in CPR surrounding shock administration is also a high priority.\n\nCurrently marketed defibrillators use proprietary shock waveforms that differ in their electric characteristics. These deliver different peak currents even at the same programmed energy setting, making comparisons of shock efficacy between devices challenging. Energy setting specifications for cardioversion also differ between defibrillators. Refer to the device manufacturer’s recommended energy for a particular waveform.\n\nTechnologies are now in development to diagnose the underlying cardiac rhythm during ongoing CPR and to derive prognostic information from the ventricular waveform that can help guide patient management. These still require further testing and validation before routine use.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn addition to defibrillation, several alternative electric and pseudoelectrical therapies have been explored as possible treatment options during cardiac arrest. Transcutaneous pacing has been studied during cardiac arrest with bradyasystolic cardiac rhythm. The theory is that the heart will respond to electric stimuli by producing myocardial contraction and generating forward movement of blood, but clinical trials have not shown pacing to improve patient outcomes.\n\nOther pseudoelectrical therapies, such as cough CPR, fist or percussion pacing, and precordial thump have all been described as temporizing measures in select patients who are either periarrest or in the initial seconds of witnessed cardiac arrest (before losing consciousness in the case of cough CPR) when definitive therapy is not readily available. Precordial thump is a single, sharp, high-velocity impact (or “punch”) to the middle sternum by the ulnar aspect of a tightly clenched fist. The force from a precordial thump is intended to transmit electric energy to the heart, similar to a low-energy shock, in hope of terminating the underlying tachyarrhythmia.\n\nFist (or percussion) pacing is the delivery of a serial, rhythmic, relatively low-velocity impact to the sternum by a closed fist.1 Fist pacing is administered in an attempt to stimulate an electric impulse sufficient to cause myocardial depolarization. Cough CPR is described as repeated deep breaths followed immediately by a cough every few seconds in an attempt to increase aortic and intracardiac pressures, providing transient hemodynamic support before a loss of consciousness.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe traditional approach for giving emergency pharmacotherapy is by the peripheral IV route. However, obtaining IV access under emergent conditions can prove to be challenging based on patient characteristics and operator experience leading to delay in pharmacological treatments.\n\nAlternatives to IV access for acute drug administration include IO, central venous, intracardiac, and endotracheal routes. Intracardiac drug administration was discouraged in the 2000 AHA Guidelines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care given its highly specialized skill set, potential morbidity, and other available options for access.1,2 Endotracheal drug administration results in low blood concentrations and unpredictable pharmacological effect and has also largely fallen into disuse given other access options. Central venous access is primarily used in the hospital setting because it requires appropriate training to acquire and maintain the needed skill set.\n\nIO access has grown in popularity given the relative ease and speed with which it can be achieved, a higher successful placement rate compared with IV cannulation, and the relatively low procedural risk. However, the efficacy of IV versus IO drug administration in cardiac arrest remains to be elucidated.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nThe peripheral IV route has been the traditional approach to vascular access for emergency drug and fluid administration during resuscitation. The pharmacokinetic properties, acute effects, and clinical efficacy of emergency drugs have primarily been described when given intravenously.3–6 The IV route has precedence, is usually accessible, and affords a potentially more predictable drug response, making it a reasonable initial approach for vascular access.\n\nThe paucity of information on the efficacy of IO drug administration during CPR was acknowledged in 2010, but since then the IO route has grown in popularity. IO access is increasingly implemented as a first-line approach for emergent vascular access. A 2020 ILCOR systematic review7 comparing IV versus IO (principally pretibial placement) drug administration during cardiac arrest found the IV route was associated with better clinical outcomes compared with IO in 5 retrospective studies.8–12 There were significant concerns for bias, particularly due to the fact that need for IO placement may indicate patient or arrest characteristics that are also risk factors for poor outcome. Subgroup analyses of IV versus IO route from 2 RCTs were also included in this systematic review. In these, no statistically significant effect modification by route of administration was identified. Point estimates favored IV access except for the outcome of ROSC in the PARAMEDIC2 trial, where the effect of epinephrine was similar regardless of route.13,14 Site specificity may also be an issue with IO administration, because IO access was nearly always pretibial in these studies. On the basis of these results, the writing group concluded that establishing a peripheral IV remains a reasonable initial approach, but IO access may be considered when an IV is not successful or feasible. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of drugs delivered intravenously as compared with intraosseously (tibial and humeral).\n\nDrug administration by central venous access (by internal jugular or subclavian vein) achieves higher peak concentrations and more rapid circulation times than drugs administered by peripheral IV do,15–17 but there are currently no data comparing clinical outcomes between these access routes. Central access is associated with higher morbidity, takes time to perform, and may also require interruption of CPR. Current use of this approach is largely in the hospital and may be considered by skilled providers when IV and IO access are not successful or feasible.\n\nEndotracheal drug administration is regarded as the least-preferred route of drug administration because it is associated with unpredictable (but generally low) drug concentrations18–20 and lower rates of ROSC and survival.21\n\nRecommendations 1 and 2 are supported by the 2020 CoSTR for ALS.22 Recommendations 3 and 4 last received formal evidence review in 2010.20\n\nSynopsis\n\nEpinephrine has been hypothesized to have beneficial effects during cardiac arrest primarily because of its α-adrenergic effects, leading to increased coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure during CPR. Conversely, the β-adrenergic effects may increase myocardial oxygen demand, reduce subendocardial perfusion, and may be proarrhythmic. Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials, enrolling over 8500 patients, evaluated the efficacy of epinephrine for OHCA.1,2 A systematic review and meta-analysis of these and other studies3 concluded that epinephrine significantly increased ROSC and survival to hospital discharge. Epinephrine did not lead to increased survival with favorable or unfavorable neurological outcome at 3 months, although both of these outcomes occurred slightly more frequently in the epinephrine group.2 Observational data suggest better outcomes when epinephrine is given sooner, and the low survival with favorable neurological outcome in the available trials may be due in part to the median time of 21 minutes from arrest to receipt of epinephrine. This time delay is a consistent issue in OHCA trials. Time to drug in IHCA is generally much shorter, and the effect of epinephrine on outcomes in the IHCA population may therefore be different. No trials to date have found any benefit of either higher-dose epinephrine or other vasopressors over standard-dose epinephrine during CPR.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nThe suggestion to administer epinephrine was strengthened to a recommendation based on a systematic review and meta-analysis,3 which included results of 2 randomized trials of epinephrine for OHCA, 1 of which included over 8000 patients,1,2 showing that epinephrine increased ROSC and survival. At 3 months, the time point felt to be most meaningful for neurological recovery, there was a nonsignificant increase in survivors with both favorable and unfavorable neurological outcome in the epinephrine group.2 Any drug that increases the rate of ROSC and survival, but is given after several minutes of downtime, will likely increase both favorable and unfavorable neurological outcome. Determining the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable neurological outcome at the time of arrest is currently not feasible. Therefore, continuing to use a drug that has been shown to increase survival, while focusing our broader efforts on shortening time to drug for all patients so that more survivors will have a favorable neurological outcome, seems the most beneficial approach.\n\nThe existing trials have used a protocol of 1 mg every 3 to 5 minutes. Operationally, administering epinephrine every second cycle of CPR, after the initial dose, may also be reasonable.\n\nOf 16 observational studies on timing in the recent systematic review, all found an association between earlier epinephrine and ROSC for patients with nonshockable rhythms, although improvements in survival were not universally seen.3\n\nFor shockable rhythms, trial protocols have directed that epinephrine be given after the third shock. The literature supports prioritizing defibrillation and CPR initially and giving epinephrine if initial attempts with CPR and defibrillation are not successful.3\n\nThe recent systematic review3 found no difference in outcomes in trials comparing vasopressin alone or vasopressin combined with epinephrine to epinephrine alone for cardiac arrest, although these studies were underpowered.\n\nMultiple RCTs have compared high-dose with standard-dose epinephrine, and although some have shown higher rates of ROSC with high-dose epinephrine, none have shown improvement in survival to discharge or any longer-term outcomes.4–11\n\nThese recommendations are supported by the “2019 AHA Focused Update on Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support: Use of Advanced Airways, Vasopressors, and Extracorporeal CPR During Cardiac Arrest: An Update to the AHA Guidelines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.”12\n\nSynopsis\n\nPharmacological treatment of cardiac arrest is typically deployed when CPR with or without attempted defibrillation fails to achieve ROSC. This may include vasopressor agents such as epinephrine (discussed in Vasopressor Medications During Cardiac Arrest) as well as drugs without direct hemodynamic effects (“nonpressors”) such as antiarrhythmic medications, magnesium, sodium bicarbonate, calcium, or steroids (discussed here). Although theoretically attractive and of some proven benefit in animal studies, none of the latter therapies has been definitively proved to improve overall survival after cardiac arrest, although some may have possible benefit in selected populations and/or special circumstances.\n\nRecommendations for the treatment of cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia, including the use of calcium and sodium bicarbonate, are presented in Electrolyte Abnormalities. Recommendations for management of torsades de pointes are also presented in Torsades de Pointes.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nAdministration of amiodarone or lidocaine to patients with OHCA was last formally reviewed in 20181 and demonstrated improved survival to hospital admission but did not improve overall survival to hospital discharge or survival with good neurological outcome.1,2 However, amiodarone and lidocaine each significantly improved survival to hospital discharge in a prespecified subgroup of patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, potentially arguing for a time-dependent benefit and a group for whom these drugs may be more useful. Other antiarrhythmic agents were not specifically addressed in the most recent evidence review and merit further evaluation. These include bretylium tosylate, which was recently reintroduced in the United States for treatment of immediately life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias but without any new information on its effectiveness or safety.3 Sotalol requires administration as a slow infusion, rendering it impractical to use in cardiac arrest.4 Similar limitations also apply to procainamide, although it has been given by rapid infusion as a second-line agent in cardiac arrest, with uncertain benefit.5 The efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs when given in combination for cardiac arrest has not been systematically addressed and remains a knowledge gap. The role of prophylactic antiarrhythmic medications on ROSC after successful defibrillation is also uncertain. Though not associated with improved survival to hospital discharge, lidocaine decreased the recurrence of VF/pVT when administered prophylactically after successful defibrillation and ROSC.6 The “2018 AHA Focused Update on Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Use of Antiarrhythmic Drugs During and Immediately After Cardiac Arrest: An Update to the AHA Guidelines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care”1 concluded that lidocaine use could be considered in specific circumstances (such as during EMS transport) when treatment of recurrent VF/pVT might be compromised. There is no evidence addressing the use of other antiarrhythmic drugs for this specific indication.\n\nTwo randomized trials from the same center reported improved survival and neurological outcome when steroids were bundled in combination with vasopressin and epinephrine during cardiac arrest and also administered after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest.7,8 However, nonrandomized studies of strictly intraarrest corticosteroid administration, in addition to standard resuscitation, show mixed outcomes.9,10 Due to the only studies suggesting benefit being from a single center with a bundled intervention, and observational data having conflicting results, whether steroids are beneficial during cardiac arrest remains unclear. At least 1 trial attempting to validate the findings of Mentzelopoulos et al is ongoing (NCT03640949).\n\nSince last addressed by the 2010 Guidelines, a 2013 systematic review found little evidence to support the routine use of calcium in undifferentiated cardiac arrest, though the evidence is very weak due calcium as a “last resort” medication in refractory cardiac arrest.11 Administration of calcium in special circumstances such as hyperkalemia and calcium blocker overdose is addressed in Electrolyte Abnormalities and Toxicity: β-Adrenergic Blockers and Calcium Channel Blockers.\n\nClinical trials and observational studies since the 2010 Guidelines have yielded no new evidence that routine administration of sodium bicarbonate improves outcomes from undifferentiated cardiac arrest and evidence suggests that it may worsen survival and neurological recovery.12–14 Use of sodium bicarbonate in special circumstances such as hyperkalemia and drug overdose is addressed in Electrolyte Abnormalities and Toxicity: Sodium Channel Blockers, Including Tricyclic Antidepressants\n\nMagnesium’s role as an antiarrhythmic agent was last addressed by the 2018 focused update on advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) guidelines.1 RCTs have not found it to improve ROSC, survival or neurological outcome regardless of the presenting cardiac arrest rhythm,15–18 nor useful for monomorphic VT.19 There are anecdotal reports and small case series attesting to magnesium’s efficacy in the treatment of torsades de pointes (See Torsades de Pointes).\n\nRecommendations 1 and 5 are supported by the 2018 focused update on ACLS guidelines.1 Recommendation 2 last received formal evidence review in 2015.20 Recommendations 3 and 4 last received formal evidence review in 2010.21\n\nSynopsis\n\nAlthough the vast majority of cardiac arrest trials have been conducted in OHCA, IHCA comprises almost half of the arrests that occur in the United States annually, and many OHCA resuscitations continue into the emergency department. IHCA patients often have invasive monitoring devices in place such as central venous or arterial lines, and personnel to perform advanced procedures such as arterial blood gas analysis or point-of-care ultrasound are often present. Advanced monitoring such as ETCO2 monitoring is being increasingly used. Determining the utility of such physiological monitoring or diagnostic procedures is important. High-quality CPR, defibrillation when appropriate, vasopressors and/or antiarrhythmics, and airway management remain the cornerstones of cardiac arrest resuscitation, but some emerging data suggest that incorporating patient-specific imaging and physiological data into our approach to resuscitation holds some promise. See Metrics for High-Quality CPR for recommendations on physiological monitoring during CPR. More research in this area is clearly needed.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nPoint-of-care cardiac ultrasound can identify cardiac tamponade or other potentially reversible causes of cardiac arrest and identify cardiac motion in pulseless electrical activity.1,2 However, cardiac ultrasound is also associated with longer interruptions in chest compressions.3 A single small RCT found no improvement in outcomes with the use of cardiac ultrasound during CPR.4\n\nNo adult human studies directly compare levels of inspired oxygen concentration during CPR. A small number of studies has shown that higher Pao2 during CPR is associated with ROSC, but this is likely due to differences in patients or resuscitation quality.5–7\n\nObservational studies have found that increases in ETCO2 of more than 10 mm Hg may indicate ROSC, although no specific cutoff value indicative of ROSC has been identified.8\n\nArterial Po2 and Pco2 values are dependent on cardiac output and ventilation and therefore will depend on both patient characteristics and CPR quality. One small study found wide discrepancies in blood gases between mixed venous and arterial samples during CPR and concluded that arterial samples are not accurate during resuscitation.9\n\nIf an arterial line is in place, an abrupt increase in diastolic pressure or the presence of an arterial waveform during a rhythm check showing an organized rhythm may indicate ROSC.\n\nRecommendations 1, 3, and 5 last received formal evidence review in 2015.10 Recommendation 2 last received formal evidence review in 2015,10 with an evidence update completed in 2020.11 Recommendation 4 last received formal evidence review in 2010.12\n\nSynopsis\n\nOHCA is a resource-intensive condition most often associated with low rates of survival. It is important for EMS providers to be able to differentiate patients in whom continued resuscitation is futile from patients with a chance of survival who should receive continued resuscitation and transportation to hospital. This will aid in both resource utilization and optimizing a patient’s chance for survival. Using a validated TOR rule will help ensure accuracy in determining futile patients (Figures 5 and 6). Futility is often defined as less than 1% chance of survival,1 suggesting that for a TOR rule to be valid it should demonstrate high accuracy for predicting futility with the lower confidence limit greater than 99% on external validation.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nThe BLS TOR rule recommends TOR when all of the following criteria apply before moving to the ambulance for transport: (1) arrest was not witnessed by EMS providers or first responder; (2) no ROSC obtained; and (3) no shocks were delivered. In a recent meta-analysis of 7 published studies (33 795 patients), only 0.13% (95% CI, 0.03%– 0.58%) of patients who fulfilled the BLS termination criteria survived to hospital discharge.3\n\nThe ALS TOR rule recommends TOR when all of the following criteria apply before moving to the ambulance for transport: (1) arrest was not witnessed; (2) no bystander CPR was provided; (3) no ROSC after full ALS care in the field; and (4) no AED shocks were delivered. In a recent meta-analysis of 2 published studies (10 178 patients), only 0.01% (95% CI, 0.00%–0.07%) of patients who fulfilled the ALS termination criteria survived to hospital discharge.3\n\nThe BLS TOR rule, otherwise known as the universal TOR rule (arrest not witnessed by EMS providers; no shock delivered; no ROSC), has been prospectively validated in combined BLS and ALS systems.4 Although the rule did not have adequate specificity after 6 minutes of resuscitation (false-positive rate: 2.1%) it did achieve better than 99% specificity after approximately 15 minutes of attempted resuscitation, while still reducing transportation by half. A retrospective analysis found that application of the universal TOR at 20 minutes of resuscitation was able to predict futility, identifying over 99% of survivors and patients with good neurological outcome.5\n\nIn intubated patients, an ETCO2 measurement less than 10 mm Hg indicates low to no blood flow. Several small studies provide evidence showing that an ETCO2 less than 10 mm Hg after 20 minutes of ALS resuscitation is strongly but not perfectly predictive of futility.6–9 These small observational studies suffer from high risk of bias. Alternative ETCO2 thresholds and timepoints have been proposed. The use of ETCO2 alone to predict patient outcome needs to be validated in a large prospective study.\n\nA recent systematic review found that no sonographic finding had consistently high sensitivity for clinical outcomes to be used as the sole criterion to terminate cardiac arrest resuscitation.10 Although some findings demonstrated higher ranges of sensitivity and/or specificity, studies examining the use of point-of-care ultrasound during cardiac arrest demonstrate varying results and are hindered by significant bias. There is considerable heterogeneity between studies in terms of timing and application of point-of-care ultrasound as well as inconsistent definitions and terminology in terms of cardiac motion. Further there is little research examining the interrater reliability of ultrasound findings during cardiac arrest.11,12 In addition, see Adjuncts to CPR for ultrasound as an adjunct to CPR.\n\nNo studies were found that specifically examined the use of ETCO2 in cardiac arrest patients without an advanced airway. It is not known whether ETCO2 values during bag-mask ventilation are as reliable as those with an advanced airway in place. Because of the lack of evidence, there is nothing to support using any cutoff value of ETCO2 for decisions about TOR in a nonintubated patient.\n\nRecommendations 1, 2, 3, and 5 are supported by the 2020 CoSTRs for BLS and ALS.13,14 Recommendations 4 and 6 last received formal evidence review in 2015.15\n\nIntroduction\n\nAirway management during cardiac arrest usually commences with a basic strategy such as bag-mask ventilation. In addition, it may be helpful for providers to master an advanced airway strategy as well as a second (backup) strategy for use if they are unable to establish the first-choice airway adjunct. Because placement of an advanced airway may result in interruption of chest compressions, a malpositioned device, or undesirable hyperventilation, providers should carefully weigh these risks against the potential benefits of an advanced airway. The 2019 focused update on ACLS guidelines addressed the use of advanced airways in cardiac arrest and noted that either bag-mask ventilation or an advanced airway strategy may be considered during CPR for adult cardiac arrest in any setting.1 Outcomes from advanced airway and bag-mask ventilation interventions are highly dependent on the skill set and experience of the provider (Figure 7). Thus, the ultimate decision of the use, type, and timing of an advanced airway will require consideration of a host of patient and provider characteristics that are not easily defined in a global recommendation. Important considerations for determining airway management strategies is provider airway management skill and experience, frequent retraining for providers, and ongoing quality improvement to minimize airway management complications.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany alternatives and adjuncts to conventional CPR have been developed. These include mechanical CPR, impedance threshold devices (ITD), active compression-decompression (ACD) CPR, and interposed abdominal compression CPR. Many of these techniques and devices require specialized equipment and training.\n\nMechanical CPR devices deliver automated chest compressions, thereby eliminating the need for manual chest compressions. There are 2 different types of mechanical CPR devices: a load-distributing compression band that compresses the entire thorax circumferentially and a pneumatic piston device that compresses the chest in an anteroposterior direction. A recent systematic review of 11 RCTs (overall moderate to low certainty of evidence) found no evidence of improved survival with good neurological outcome with mechanical CPR compared with manual CPR in either OHCA or IHCA.1 Given the perceived logistic advantages related to limited personnel and safety during patient transport, mechanical CPR remains popular among some providers and systems.\n\nACD-CPR is performed by using a handheld device with a suction cup applied to the midsternum, actively lifting up the chest during decompressions, thereby enhancing the negative intrathoracic pressure generated by chest recoil and increasing venous return and cardiac output during the next chest compression. The ITD is a pressure-sensitive valve attached to an advanced airway or face mask that limits air entry into the lungs during the decompression phase of CPR, enhancing the negative intrathoracic pressure generated during chest wall recoil and improving venous return and cardiac output during CPR.\n\nThere are many alternative CPR techniques being used, and many are unproven. As an example, there is insufficient evidence concerning the cardiac arrest bundle of care with the inclusion of “heads-up” CPR to provide a recommendation concerning its use.2 Further investigation in this and other alternative CPR techniques is best explored in the context of formal controlled clinical research\n\nSynopsis\n\nECPR refers to the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass during the resuscitation of a patient in cardiac arrest. This involves the cannulation of a large vein and artery and initiation of venoarterial extracorporeal circulation and membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (Figure 8). The goal of ECPR is to support end organ perfusion while potentially reversible conditions are addressed. ECPR is a complex intervention that requires a highly trained team, specialized equipment, and multidisciplinary support within a healthcare system. The 2019 focused update on ACLS guidelines1 addressed the use of ECPR for cardiac arrest and noted that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of ECPR in cardiac arrest. However, ECPR may be considered if there is a potentially reversible cause of an arrest that would benefit from temporary cardiorespiratory support. One important consideration is the selection of patients for ECPR and further research is needed to define patients who would most benefit from the intervention. Furthermore, the resource intensity required to begin and maintain an ECPR program should be considered in the context of strengthening other links in the Chain of Survival. Additional investigations are necessary to evaluate cost-effectiveness, resource allocation, and ethics surrounding the routine use of ECPR in resuscitation.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nThere are no RCTs on the use of ECPR for OHCA or IHCA. Fifteen observational studies were identified for OHCA that varied in inclusion criteria, ECPR settings, and study design, with the majority of studies reporting improved neurological outcome associated with ECPR.2 For ECPR use in the in-hospital setting, all studies were assessed as having very serious risk of bias (primarily due to confounding) and the overall certainty of evidence was rated as very low for all outcomes.2 In 3 studies, ECPR was not associated with beneficial effects for short- or long-term neurological outcomes,3–5 while 1 study6 did report associated short- and long-term neurological outcome benefit. Despite many studies reporting favorable outcomes with the use of ECPR, the vast majority of the studies are from single centers with varying inclusion criteria and settings, with decisions to perform ECPR made on a case-by-case basis. While there is currently no evidence to clearly define what should constitute “selected patients,” most of the studies analyzed included younger patients with fewer comorbidities. More data are clearly needed from studies of higher methodologic quality, including randomized trials.\n\nThese recommendations are supported by the 2019 focused update on ACLS guidelines.1\n\nSynopsis\n\nA wide-complex tachycardia is defined as a rapid rhythm (generally 150 beats/min or more when attributable to an arrhythmia) with a QRS duration of 0.12 seconds or more. It can represent any aberrantly conducted supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), including paroxysmal SVT caused by atrioventricular (AV) reentry, aberrantly conducted atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ectopic atrial tachycardia. A wide-complex tachycardia can also be caused by any of these supraventricular arrhythmias when conducted by an accessory pathway (called pre-excited arrhythmias). Conversely, a wide-complex tachycardia can also be due to VT or a rapid ventricular paced rhythm in patients with a pacemaker.\n\nInitial management of wide-complex tachycardia requires a rapid assessment of the patient’s hemodynamic stability. Unstable patients require immediate electric cardioversion. If hemodynamically stable, a presumptive rhythm diagnosis should be attempted by obtaining a 12-lead ECG to evaluate the tachycardia’s features. This includes identifying P waves and their relationship to QRS complexes and (in the case of patients with a pacemaker) pacing spikes preceding QRS complexes.\n\nA wide-complex tachycardia can be regular or irregularly irregular and have uniform (monomorphic) or differing (polymorphic) QRS complexes from beat to beat. Each of these features can also be useful in making a presumptive rhythm diagnosis. An irregularly irregular wide-complex tachycardia with monomorphic QRS complexes suggests atrial fibrillation with aberrancy, whereas pre-excited atrial fibrillation or polymorphic VT are likely when QRS complexes change in their configuration from beat to beat. Conversely, a regular wide-complex tachycardia could represent monomorphic VT or an aberrantly conducted reentrant paroxysmal SVT, ectopic atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter. Distinguishing between these rhythm etiologies is the key to proper drug selection for treatment. While hemodynamically stable rhythms afford an opportunity for evaluation and pharmacological treatment, the need for prompt electric cardioversion should be anticipated in the event the arrhythmia proves unresponsive to these measures or rapid decompensation occurs. A more detailed approach to rhythm management is found elsewhere.1–3\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nBefore embarking on empirical drug therapy, obtaining a 12-lead ECG and/or seeking expert consultation for diagnosis is encouraged, if available. If a regular wide-complex tachycardia is suspected to be paroxysmal SVT, vagal maneuvers can be considered before initiating pharmacological therapies (see Regular Narrow-Complex Tachycardia). Adenosine is an ultra–short-acting drug that is effective in terminating regular tachycardias when caused by AV reentry. Adenosine will not typically terminate atrial arrhythmias (such as atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia) but will transiently slow the ventricular rate by blocking conduction of P waves through the AV node, afford their recognition, and help establish the rhythm diagnosis. While ineffective in terminating ventricular arrhythmias, adenosine’s relatively short-lived effect on blood pressure makes it less likely to destabilize monomorphic VT in an otherwise hemodynamically stable patient. These features make adenosine relatively safe for treating a hemodynamically stable, regular, monomorphic wide-complex tachycardia of unknown type4 and as an aid in rhythm diagnosis, although its use is not completely without risk.5,6\n\nIV antiarrhythmic medications may be considered in stable patients with wide-complex tachycardia, particularly if suspected to be VT or having failed adenosine. Because of their longer duration of action, antiarrhythmic agents may also be useful to prevent recurrences of wide-complex tachycardia. Lidocaine is not included as a treatment option for undifferentiated wide-complex tachycardia because it is a relatively “narrow-spectrum” drug that is ineffective for SVT, probably because its kinetic properties are less effective for VT at hemodynamically tolerated rates than amiodarone, procainamide, or sotalol are.7–10 In contrast, amiodarone, procainamide, and sotalol are “broader-spectrum” antiarrhythmics than lidocaine and can treat both SVT and VT, but they can cause hypotension. Since the 2010 Guidelines, a new branded bioequivalent formulation of amiodarone has become available for IV infusion with less hypotensive effects than the older generic formulation.11 There are few direct comparisons of efficacy between amiodarone, procainamide, and sotalol themselves,12 which the writing group felt were insufficient to favor one of these drugs over another, apart from cautioning about their use in patients with long QT, amiodarone in suspected pre-excited arrhythmias, or giving these drugs in combination without prior expert consultation. Any of these drugs can also worsen wide-complex tachycardia, converting it to an arrhythmia that is more rapid, less hemodynamically stable, or more malignant, such that availability of a defibrillator is encouraged when these drugs are administered.13\n\nVerapamil is a calcium channel blocking agent that slows AV node conduction, shortens the refractory period of accessory pathways, and acts as a negative inotrope and vasodilator. Its effects are mediated by a different mechanism and are longer lasting than adenosine. Though effective for treating a wide-complex tachycardia known to be of supraventricular origin and not involving accessory pathway conduction, verapamil’s negative inotropic and hypotensive effects can destabilize VT14 and accelerate pre-excited atrial fibrillation and flutter.15 Similar concerns may also apply to other drugs commonly used to treat SVTs, such as diltiazem and β-adrenergic blockers, which are not addressed in this recommendation and require evidence review.\n\nThe combination of adenosine’s short-lived slowing of AV node conduction, shortening of refractoriness in the myocardium and accessory pathways, and hypotensive effects make it unsuitable in hemodynamically unstable patients and for treating irregularly irregular and polymorphic wide-complex tachycardias. Adenosine only transiently slows irregularly irregular rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation, rendering it unsuitable for their management. The drug’s hypotensive and tissue refractoriness–shortening effects can accelerate ventricular rates in polymorphic VT and, when atrial fibrillation or flutter are conducted by an accessory pathway, risk degeneration to VF.16 Thus, the drug is not recommended in hemodynamically unstable patients or for treating irregularly irregular or polymorphic wide-complex tachycardias.\n\nThis topic last received formal evidence review in 2010.17\n\nSynopsis\n\nPolymorphic VT refers to a wide-complex tachycardia of ventricular origin with differing configurations of the QRS complex from beat to beat. However, the most critical feature in the diagnosis and treatment of polymorphic VT is not the morphology of rhythm but rather what is known (or suspected) about the patient’s underlying QT interval. Torsades de pointes is a form of polymorphic VT that is associated with a prolonged heart rate–corrected QT interval when the rhythm is normal and VT is not present. The risk for developing torsades increases when the corrected QT interval is greater than 500 milliseconds and accompanied by bradycardia.1 Torsades can be due to an inherited genetic abnormality2 and can also be caused by drugs and electrolyte imbalances that cause lengthening of the QT interval.3\n\nConversely, polymorphic VT not associated with a long QT is most often due to acute myocardial ischemia.4,5 Other potential causes include catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, a genetic abnormality in which polymorphic VT is provoked by exercise or emotion in the absence of QT prolongation6 ; “short QT” syndrome, a form of polymorphic VT associated with an unusually short QT interval (corrected QT interval less than 330–370 milliseconds)7,8 ; and bidirectional VT seen in digitalis toxicity in which the axis of alternate QRS complexes shifts by 180 degrees.9 Supportive data for the acute pharmacological treatment of polymorphic VT, with and without long corrected QT interval, is largely based on case reports and case series, because no RCTs exist.\n\nIntroduction\n\nManagement of SVTs is the subject of a recent joint treatment guideline from the AHA, the American College of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm Society.1\n\nNarrow-complex tachycardia represents a range of tachyarrhythmias originating from a circuit or focus involving the atria or the AV node. Clinicians must determine if the tachycardia is narrow-complex or wide-complex tachycardia and if it has a regular or irregular rhythm. For patients with a sinus tachycardia (heart rate greater than 100/min, P waves), no specific drug treatment is needed, and clinicians should focus on identification and treatment of the underlying cause of the tachycardia (fever, dehydration, pain). If the patient presents with SVT, the primary goal of treatment is to quickly identify and treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable (ischemic chest pain, altered mental status, shock, hypotension, acute heart failure) or symptomatic due to the arrhythmia. Synchronized cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic regular narrow-complex tachycardia. The available evidence suggests no appreciable differences in success or major adverse event rates between calcium channel blockers and adenosine.2\n\nIn patients with narrow-complex tachycardia who are refractory to the measures described, this may indicate a more complicated rhythm abnormality for which expert consultation may be advisable.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAtrial fibrillation is an SVT consisting of disorganized atrial electric activation and uncoordinated atrial contraction. Atrial flutter is an SVT with a macroreentrant circuit resulting in rapid atrial activation but intermittent ventricular response. These arrhythmias are common and often coexist, and their treatment recommendations are similar.\n\nTreatment of atrial fibrillation/flutter depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient as well as prior history of arrhythmia, comorbidities, and responsiveness to medication. Hemodynamically unstable patients and those with rate-related ischemia should receive urgent electric cardioversion. Hemodynamically stable patients can be treated with a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy. Rate control is more common in the emergency setting, using IV administration of a nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) or a β-adrenergic blocker (eg, metoprolol, esmolol). While amiodarone is typically considered a rhythm-control agent, it can effectively reduce ventricular rate with potential use in patients with congestive heart failure where β-adrenergic blockers may not be tolerated and nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists are contraindicated. Long-term anticoagulation may be necessary for patients at risk for thromboembolic events based on their CHA2 DS2 - VASc score. The choice of anticoagulation is beyond the scope of these guidelines.\n\nThe rhythm-control strategy (sometimes called chemical cardioversion) includes antiarrhythmic medications given to convert the rhythm to sinus and/or prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation/flutter (Table 3). Patient selection, evaluation, timing, drug selection, and anticoagulation for patients undergoing rhythm control are beyond the scope of these guidelines and are presented elsewhere.1,2\n\nThe management of patients with preexcitation syndromes (aka Wolff-Parkinson-White) is covered in the Wide-Complex Tachycardia section.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBradycardia is generally defined as a heart rate less than 60/min. Bradycardia can be a normal finding, especially for athletes or during sleep. When bradycardia occurs secondary to a pathological cause, it can lead to decreased cardiac output with resultant hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion. The clinical manifestations of bradycardia can range from an absence of symptoms to symptomatic bradycardia (bradycardia associated with acutely altered mental status, ischemic chest discomfort, acute heart failure, hypotension, or other signs of shock that persist despite adequate airway and breathing). The cause of the bradycardia may dictate the severity of the presentation. For example, patients with severe hypoxia and impending respiratory failure may suddenly develop a profound bradycardia that leads to cardiac arrest if not addressed immediately. In contrast, a patient who develops third-degree heart block but is otherwise well compensated might experience relatively low blood pressure but otherwise be stable. Therefore, the management of bradycardia will depend on both the underlying cause and severity of the clinical presentation. In 2018, the AHA, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Rhythm Society published an extensive guideline on the evaluation and management of stable and unstable bradycardia.2 This guideline focuses exclusively on symptomatic bradycardia in the ACLS setting and maintains consistency with the 2018 guideline.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPost–cardiac arrest care is a critical component of the Chain of Survival. What defines optimal hospital care for patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest is not completely known, but there is increasing interest in identifying and optimizing practices that are likely to improve outcomes. The systemic impact of the ischemia-reperfusion injury caused by cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation requires post–cardiac arrest care to simultaneously support the multiple organ systems that are affected. After initial stabilization, care of critically ill postarrest patients hinges on hemodynamic support, mechanical ventilation, temperature management, diagnosis and treatment of underlying causes, diagnosis and treatment of seizures, vigilance for and treatment of infection, and management of the critically ill state of the patient. Many cardiac arrest patients who survive the initial event will eventually die because of withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in the setting of neurological injury. This cause of death is especially prominent in those with OHCA but is also frequent after IHCA.1,2 Thus, much of postarrest care focuses on mitigating injury to the brain. Possible contributors to this goal include optimization of cerebral perfusion pressure, management of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, control of core body temperature, and detection and treatment of seizures (Figure 9). Cardiac arrest results in heterogeneous injury; thus, death can also result from multiorgan dysfunction or shock. In light of the complexity of postarrest patients, a multidisciplinary team with expertise in cardiac arrest care is preferred, and the development of multidisciplinary protocols is critical to optimize survival and neurological outcome.\n\nKey topics in postresuscitation care that are not covered in this section, but are discussed later, are targeted temperature management (TTM) (Targeted Temperature Management), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in cardiac arrest (PCI After Cardiac Arrest), neuroprognostication (Neuroprognostication), and recovery (Recovery).\n\nIntroduction\n\nTTM between 32°C and 36°C for at least 24 hours is currently recommended for all cardiac rhythms in both OHCA and IHCA. Multiple randomized trials have been performed in various domains of TTM and were summarized in a systematic review published in 2015.1 Subsequent to the 2015 recommendations, additional randomized trials have evaluated TTM for nonshockable rhythms as well as TTM duration. Many of these were reviewed in an evidence update provided in the 2020 COSTR for ALS.2 Many uncertainties within the topic of TTM remain, including whether temperature should vary on the basis of patient characteristics, how long TTM should be maintained, and how quickly it should be started. An updated systematic review on several aspects of this important topic is needed once currently ongoing clinical trials have been completed.\n\nSynopsis\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent in the setting of cardiac arrest.1–4 Patients with cardiac arrest due to shockable rhythms have demonstrated particularly high rates of severe CAD: up to 96% of patients with STEMI on their postresuscitation ECG,2,5 up to 42% for patients without ST-segment elevation,2,5–7 and 85% of refractory out-of-hospital VF/VT arrest patients have severe CAD.8 The role of CAD in cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythms is unknown.\n\nWhen significant CAD is observed during post-ROSC coronary angiography, revascularization can be achieved safely in most cases.5,7,9 Further, successful PCI is associated with improved survival in multiple observational studies.2,6,7,10,11 Additional benefits of evaluation in the cardiac catheterization laboratory include discovery of anomalous coronary anatomy, the opportunity to assess left ventricular function and hemodynamic status, and the potential for insertion of temporary mechanical circulatory support devices.\n\nThe 2015 Guidelines Update recommended emergent coronary angiography for patients with ST-segment elevation on the post-ROSC ECG. Emergent coronary angiography and PCI have also been also associated with improved neurological outcomes in patients without STEMI on their post-ROSC resuscitation ECG.4,12 However, a large randomized trial found no improvement in survival in patients resuscitated from OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm in whom no ST-segment elevations or signs of shock were present.13 Multiple RCTs are underway. It remains to be tested whether patients with signs of shock benefit from emergent coronary angiography and PCI.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nSeveral observational studies have demonstrated improved neurologically favorable survival when early coronary angiography is performed followed by PCI in patients with cardiac arrest who have a STEMI.5,14–17 This led to a Class 1 recommendation in the 2015 Guidelines Update that has not been contradicted by any other recent studies. This recommendation is consistent with global recommendations for all patients with STEMI.\n\nMultiple observational studies have shown an association between emergent coronary angiography and PCI and improved neurological outcomes in patients without ST-segment elevation.5,7,14,15,18 A meta-analysis also supported the use of early coronary angiography in patients without ST-segment elevation.19 However, a large randomized trial found no improvement in survival in patients resuscitated from OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm in whom no ST-segment elevation or signs of shock were present.20 In addition, while coronary artery disease was found in 65% of patients who underwent coronary angiography, only 5% of patients had acute thrombotic coronary occlusions. Multiple RCTs are underway, but the role of emergent coronary angiography and PCI in patients without ST-elevation but with signs of shock remains to be tested. The use of emergent coronary angiography in patients with hemodynamic or electric instability is consistent with guidelines for non-STEMI patients.21–23 The optimal treatment of hemodynamically and electrically stable patients without ST-segment elevation remains unclear. This area was last reviewed systematically in 2015 and requires additional systematic review after the completion of currently active trials (NCT03119571, NCT02309151, NCT02387398, NCT02641626, NCT02750462, NCT02876458).\n\nEvidence suggests that patients who are comatose after ROSC benefit from invasive angiography, when indicated, as do patients who are awake.4,14,18 Therefore, invasive coronary angiography is reasonable independent of neurological status.\n\nThis topic last received formal evidence review in 2015.24\n\nSynopsis\n\nNeuroprognostication relies on interpreting the results of diagnostic tests and correlating those results with outcome. Given that a false-positive test for poor neurological outcome could lead to inappropriate withdrawal of life support from a patient who otherwise would have recovered, the most important test characteristic is specificity. Many of the tests considered are subject to error because of the effects of medications, organ dysfunction, and temperature. Furthermore, many research studies have methodological limitations including small sample sizes, single-center design, lack of blinding, the potential for self-fulfilling prophecies, and the use of outcome at hospital discharge rather than a time point associated with maximal recovery (typically 3–6 months after arrest).3\n\nBecause any single method of neuroprognostication has an intrinsic error rate and may be subject to confounding, multiple modalities should be used to improve decision-making accuracy.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nThe overall certainty in the evidence of neurological prognostication studies is low because of biases that limit the internal validity of the studies as well as issues of generalizability that limit their external validity. Thus, the confidence in the prognostication of the diagnostic tests studied is also low. Neuroprognostication that uses multimodal testing is felt to be better at predicting outcomes than is relying on the results of a single test to predict poor prognosis.3,4\n\nSedatives and neuromuscular blockers may be metabolized more slowly in post–cardiac arrest patients, and injured brains may be more sensitive to the depressant effects of various medications. Residual sedation or paralysis can confound the accuracy of clinical examinations.5\n\nPrognostication of neurological recovery is complex and limited by uncertainty in most cases. Discordance in goals of care between clinicians and families/surrogates has been reported in more than 25% of critically ill patients.6 Lack of adequate communication is one important factor, and regular multidisciplinary conversations may help mitigate this.\n\nOperationally, the timing for prognostication is typically at least 5 days after ROSC for patients treated with TTM (which is about 72 hours after normothermia) and should be conducted under conditions that minimize the confounding effects of sedating medications. Individual test modalities may be obtained earlier and the results integrated into the multimodality assessment synthesized at least 72 hours after normothermia. In some instances, prognostication and withdrawal of life support may appropriately occur earlier because of nonneurologic disease, brain herniation, patient’s goals and wishes, or clearly nonsurvivable situations.\n\nThese recommendations are supported by the 2020 CoSTR for ALS,4 which supplements the last comprehensive review of this topic conducted in 2015.7\n\nUse of the Clinical Examination in Neuroprognostication\n\nSynopsis\n\nClinical examination findings correlate with poor outcome but are also subject to confounding by TTM and medications, and prior studies have methodological limitations. In addition to assessing level of consciousness and performing basic neurological examination, clinical examination elements may include the pupillary light reflex, pupillometry, corneal reflex, myoclonus, and status myoclonus when assessed within 1 week after cardiac arrest. The ILCOR systematic review included studies regardless of TTM status, and findings were correlated with neurological outcome at time points ranging from hospital discharge to 12 months after arrest.4 Quantitative pupillometry is the automated assessment of pupillary reactivity, measured by the percent reduction in pupillary size and the degree of reactivity reported as the neurological pupil index. Benefits of this method are a standard and reproducible assessment. Status myoclonus is commonly defined as spontaneous or sound-sensitive, repetitive, irregular brief jerks in both face and limb present most of the day within 24 hours after cardiac arrest.8 Status myoclonus differs from myoclonic status epilepticus; myoclonic status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus with physical manifestation of persistent myoclonic movements and is considered a subtype of status epilepticus for these guidelines.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nIn 17 studies,9–25 absent pupillary light reflex assessed from immediately after ROSC up to 7 days after arrest predicted poor neurological outcome with specificity ranging from 48% to 100%. The specificity varied significantly on the basis of timing, with the highest specificity seen at time points 72 hours or more after arrest.\n\nThree studies evaluated quantitative pupillary light reflex15,26,27 and 3 studies evaluated neurological pupil index15,28,29 at time points ranging from 24 to 72 hours after arrest. Absent pupillary light reflex as assessed by quantitative pupillometry (ie, quantitative pupillary light reflex=0%) is an objective finding and, in 1 study of 271 patients, had high specificity for poor outcome when assessed at 72 hours after arrest.15 Neurological pupil index is nonspecific and may be affected by medications; thus, an absolute neurological pupil index cutoff and a specific threshold that predicts poor prognosis is unknown.15,28,29\n\nEleven observational studies9–11,14,16,17,19,21,22,30,31 evaluated absence of corneal reflexes at time points ranging from immediately after ROSC to 7 days after arrest. The specificity for poor outcome ranged from 25% to 100% and increased in the studies evaluating corneal reflexes at time points 72 hours or more after arrest (ranging from 89% to 100%). Like other examination findings, corneal reflexes are subject to confounding by medications, and few studies specifically evaluated the potential of residual medication effect.\n\nIn 2 studies involving 347 patients,21,32 the presence of status myoclonus within 72 hours predicted poor neurological outcome from hospital discharge to 6 months, with specificity ranging from 97% to 100%.\n\nObtaining EEG in status myoclonus is important to rule out underlying ictal activity. In addition, status myoclonus may have an EEG correlate that is not clearly ictal but may have prognostic meaning, and additional research is needed to delineate these patterns. Some EEG-correlated patterns of status myoclonus may have poor prognosis, but there may also be more benign subtypes of status myoclonus with EEG correlates.33,34\n\nSix observational studies16,19,30,35–37 evaluated the presence of myoclonus within 96 hours after arrest with specificity for poor outcome ranging from 77.8% to 97.4%. There were methodological limitations in all studies, including a lack of standard definitions, lack of blinding, incomplete data about EEG correlates, and the inability to differentiate subtypes of myoclonus. The literature was so imprecise as to make it potentially harmful if undifferentiated myoclonus is used as a prognostic marker.\n\nHistorically, the best motor examination in the upper extremities has been used as a prognostic tool, with extensor or absent movement being correlated with poor outcome. The previous literature was limited by methodological concerns, including around inadequate control for effects of TTM and medications and self-fulfilling prophecies, and there was a lower-than-acceptable false-positive rate (10% to 15%).7 The performance of the motor examination was not evaluated in the 2020 ILCOR systematic review. The updates made to the 2015 recommendations are based on concerns that the motor examination is subject to confounding and has an unacceptably high false-positive rate and, thus, should not be used as a prognostic tool or as a screen for subsequent testing.\n\nThese recommendations are supported by the 2020 CoSTR for ALS,4 which supplements the last comprehensive review of this topic conducted in 2015.7\n\nUse of Serum Biomarkers for Neuroprognostication\n\nSynopsis\n\nSerum biomarkers are blood-based tests that measure the concentration of proteins normally found in the central nervous system (CNS). These proteins are absorbed into blood in the setting of neurological injury, and their serum levels reflect the degree of brain injury. Limitations to their prognostic utility include variability in testing methods on the basis of site and laboratory, between-laboratory inconsistency in levels, susceptibility to additional uncertainty due to hemolysis, and potential extracerebral sources of the proteins. NSE and S100B are the 2 most commonly studied markers, but others are included in this review as well. The 2020 ILCOR systematic review evaluated studies that obtained serum biomarkers within the first 7 days after arrest and correlated serum biomarker concentrations with neurological outcome. Other testing of serum biomarkers, including testing levels over serial time points after arrest, was not evaluated. A large observational cohort study investigating these and other novel serum biomarkers and their performance as prognostic biomarkers would be of high clinical significance.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nTwelve observational studies evaluated NSE collected within 72 hours after arrest.10,13,21,23,38–45 The maximal level that correlated with poor outcome ranged from 33 to 120 μg/L with specificity for poor outcome of 75% to 100%. The evidence is limited because of lack of blinding, laboratory inconsistencies, a broad range of thresholds needed to achieve 100% specificity, and imprecision. As such, an absolute value cutoff of NSE that predicts poor prognosis is not known, though very high levels of NSE may be used as part of multimodal prognostication. There is research interest in evaluating serial measures over the first days after arrest as a prognostic tool instead of using a single absolute value.10,46\n\nThree observational studies40,47,48 evaluated S100B levels within the first 72 hours after arrest. The maximal level that correlated with poor outcome ranged broadly depending on the study and the timing when it was measured after arrest. At values reported to achieve 100% specificity, test sensitivity ranged from 2.8% to 77.6%. The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the broad range of thresholds across the studies required to achieve 100% specificity. The ILCOR review also evaluated 1 study each evaluating glial fibrillary acidic protein44 and Tau49 and 2 studies evaluating neurofilament light chain.50,51 Given the low number of studies, the LOE was low, and these serum biomarkers could not be recommended for clinical practice.\n\nThese recommendations are supported by the 2020 CoSTR for ALS,4 which supplements the last comprehensive review of this topic conducted in 2015.7\n\nUse of Electrophysiological Tests for Neuroprognostication\n\nSynopsis\n\nElectroencephalography is widely used in clinical practice to evaluate cortical brain activity and diagnose seizures. Its use as a neuroprognostic tool is promising, but the literature is limited by several factors: lack of standardized terminology and definitions, relatively small sample sizes, single center study design, lack of blinding, subjectivity in the interpretation, and lack of accounting for effects of medications. There is also inconsistency in definitions used to describe specific findings and patterns. EEG patterns that were evaluated in the 2020 ILCOR systematic review include unreactive EEG, epileptiform discharges, seizures, status epilepticus, burst suppression, and “highly malignant” EEG. Unfortunately, different studies define highly malignant EEG differently or imprecisely, making use of this finding unhelpful.\n\nSSEPs are obtained by stimulating the median nerve and evaluating for the presence of a cortical N20 wave. Bilaterally absent N20 SSEP waves have been correlated with poor prognosis, but reliability of this modality is limited by requiring appropriate operator skills and care to avoid electric interference from muscle artifacts or from the ICU environment. One benefit to SSEPs is that they are subject to less interference from medications than are other modalities.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nFive observational studies35,52–55 evaluated the role of electrographic and/or convulsive seizures in neuroprognostication. The studies focused on electrographic seizures, though some studies also included convulsive seizures. Although the specificity of seizures in the studies included in the ILCOR systematic review was 100%, sensitivity of this finding was poor (0.6% to 26.8%), and other studies that were not included in the review found patients with postarrest seizures who had good outcomes.36,56,57 Additional methodological concerns include selection bias for which patients underwent EEG monitoring and inconsistent definitions of seizure. The term seizure encompasses a broad spectrum of pathologies that likely have different prognoses, ranging from a single brief electrographic seizure to refractory status epilepticus, and this imprecision justified the more limited recommendation.\n\nSix observational studies21,55,58–61 evaluated status epilepticus within 5 days after arrest and evaluated outcomes at time points ranging from hospital discharge to 6 months after arrest. The specificity of status epilepticus for poor outcome ranged from 82.6% to 100%. Interestingly, although status epilepticus is a severe form of seizures, the specificity of status epilepticus for poor outcome was less than that which was reported in the studies examining the seizures overall (as above). Additional concerns include the inconsistent definition of status epilepticus, lack of blinding, and the use of status epilepticus to justify withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies leading to potential self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\nSix studies21,35,54,59,62,63 evaluated burst suppression within 120 hours after arrest. One additional study64 subdivided burst suppression into synchronous versus heterogeneous patterns. Definitions of burst suppression varied or were not specified. Specificity ranged from 90.7% to 100%, and sensitivity was 1.1% to 51%. The lack of standardized definitions, potential for self-fulfilling prophecies, and the lack of controlling for medication effects limited the ability to make a stronger recommendation, despite the overall high specificity. Additional focus on identifying subtypes of burst suppression, such as the synchronous subtype (which appeared to be highly specific in a single study), should be investigated further. Burst suppression can be caused by medications, so it is particularly important that providers have knowledge about the potential effects of medication on this prognostic tool.\n\nFourteen observational studies9,13,15–17,23,59,64–70 evaluated bilaterally absent N20 SSEP waves within 96 hours after arrest and correlated the finding with outcome at time points ranging from hospital discharge to 6 months after arrest. Specificity ranged from 50% to 100%. Three studies had specificity below 100%, and additional methodological limitations included lack of blinding and potential for self-fulfilling prophecies. While the studies evaluated SSEPs obtained at any time starting immediately after arrest, there is a high likelihood of potential confounding factors early after arrest, leading to the recommendation that SSEPs should only be obtained more than 24 hours after arrest.\n\nDischarges on EEG were divided into 2 types: rhythmic/periodic and nonrhythmic/periodic. Nine observational studies evaluated rhythmic/ periodic discharges.16,45,52–54,61,63,66,69 The specificity of rhythmic/periodic discharges ranged from 66.7% to 100%, with poor sensitivity (2.4%–50.8%). The studies evaluating rhythmic/periodic discharges were inconsistent in the definitions of discharges. Most did not account for effects of medications, and some studies found unacceptably low specificity. Nonetheless, as the time from the cardiac arrest increased, the specificity of rhythmic/periodic discharges for poor outcome improved. There is opportunity to develop this EEG finding as a prognostic tool. Five observational studies52,53,64,66,69 evaluated nonrhythmic/periodic discharges. Specificity for poor outcome was low over the entire post–cardiac arrest period evaluated in the studies.\n\nTen observational studies16,30,53–55,62,65,71–73 reported on the prognostic value of unreactive EEG. Specificity ranged from 41.7% to 100% and was below 90% in most studies. There was inconsistency in the definitions of and stimuli used for EEG reactivity. Studies also did not account for effects of temperature and medications. Thus, the overall certainty of the evidence was rated as very low.\n\nThese recommendations are supported by the 2020 CoSTR for ALS,4 which supplements the last comprehensive review of this topic conducted in 2015.7\n\nUse of Neuroimaging for Neuroprognostication\n\nSynopsis\n\nNeuroimaging may be helpful after arrest to detect and quantify structural brain injury. CT and MRI are the 2 most common modalities. On CT, brain edema can be quantified as the GWR, defined as the ratio between the density (measured as Hounsfield units) of the gray matter and the white matter. Normal brain has a GWR of approximately 1.3, and this number decreases with edema. On MRI, cytotoxic injury can be measured as restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and can be quantified by the ADC. DWI/ADC is a sensitive measure of injury, with normal values ranging between 700 and 800×10−6 mm2 /s and values decreasing with injury. CT and MRI findings of brain injury evolve over the first several days after arrest, so the timing of the imaging study of interest is of particular importance as it relates to prognosis.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nTwelve studies23,24,31,38,66,74–79 evaluated GWR on head CT. Whole-brain GWR (GWR average) and GWR in specific regions were evaluated. The specificity was 85% to 100%, and only 1 study reported a specificity that was not 100%. Many of the studies evaluated head CTs that were obtained within the first 24 hours after arrest, though some studies included head CTs obtained up to 72 hours after arrest. There were methodological limitations, including selection bias, risk of multiple comparisons, and heterogeneity of measurement techniques, such as anatomic sites and calculation methods. Thus, a specific GWR threshold that predicts poor prognosis with 100% specificity is unknown. Additionally, the optimal timing for obtaining head CT after arrest to optimize the GWR as a prognostic tool is unknown.\n\nFive observational studies11,23,74,80,81 investigated DWI changes on MRI within 5 days after arrest. The studies evaluated MRI qualitatively for “high signal intensity” and “positive findings,” but the definitions of positive findings differed between studies and, in some studies, examined only specific brain regions. Specificity was 55.7% to 100%. The imprecise definition and short-term outcome in some studies led to significant uncertainty about how to use DWI MRI to predict poor prognosis. In the correct setting, a significant burden of DWI MRI findings or DWI MRI findings in specific regions of interest may be correlated with poor prognosis, but a broader recommendation could not be supported.\n\nThree observational studies82–84 investigated ADC on MRI within 7 days after arrest. The studies were designed to determine thresholds that achieved 100% specificity, though the ADC and brain volume thresholds needed to achieve that specificity varied broadly. While quantitative ADC measurements are a promising tool, their broad use is limited by feasibility concerns. Additionally, there are relatively few studies, and per other imaging features, there was heterogeneity of measurement techniques, including in sites and calculation methods. A specific ADC threshold that predicts poor prognosis is not known.\n\nThese recommendations are supported by the 2020 CoSTR for ALS,4 which supplements the last comprehensive review of this topic conducted in 2015.7\n\nSynopsis\n\nCardiac arrest survivors, like many survivors of critical illness, often experience a spectrum of physical, neurological, cognitive, emotional, or social issues, some of which may not become apparent until after hospital discharge. Survivorship after cardiac arrest is the journey through rehabilitation and recovery and highlights the far-reaching impact on patients, families, healthcare partners, and communities (Figure 11).1–3\n\nThe systems-of-care approach to cardiac arrest includes the community and healthcare response to cardiac arrest. However, with more people surviving cardiac arrest, there is a need to organize discharge planning and long-term rehabilitation care resources. Survivorship plans that address treatment, surveillance, and rehabilitation need to be provided at hospital discharge to optimize transitions of care to the outpatient setting. For many patients and families, these plans and resources may be paramount to improved quality of life after cardiac arrest. Survivorship plans help guide the patient, caregivers, and primary care providers and include a summary of the inpatient course, recommended follow-up appointments, and postdischarge recovery expectations (Figure 12).\n\nCardiac arrest survivors, their families, and families of nonsurvivors may be powerful advocates for community response to cardiac arrest and patient-centered outcomes. Enhancing survivorship and recovery after cardiac arrest needs to be a systematic priority, aligned with treatment recommendations for patients surviving stroke, cancer, and other critical illnesses.3–5\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nApproximately one third of cardiac arrest survivors experience anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress.6–9 Fatigue is also common and may be due to physical, cognitive, or affective impairments. Family or caregivers may also experience significant stress and benefit from therapy.10–17\n\nCognitive impairments after cardiac arrest include difficulty with memory, attention, and executive function.18–22 Physical, neurological, and cardiopulmonary impairments are also common.3 Early evaluation for cardiac rehabilitation and physical, occupational, and speech language therapy may be helpful to develop strategies to recover from, overcome, or adapt to impairments.3,23–25\n\nCommunity reintegration and return to work or other activities may be slow and depend on social support and relationships.26–29 Patients need direction about when to begin driving and when to return to intimacy.30,31\n\nRescuers may experience anxiety or posttraumatic stress about providing or not providing BLS.23,32 Hospital-based care providers may also experience emotional or psychological effects of caring for a patient with cardiac arrest.34 Team debriefings may allow a review of team performance (education, quality improvement) as well as recognition of the natural stressors associated with caring for a patient near death.35\n\nThese recommendations are supported by “Sudden Cardiac Arrest Survivorship: a Scientific Statement From the AHA.”3\n\nSynopsis\n\nSevere accidental environmental hypothermia (body temperature less than 30°C [86°F]) causes marked decrease in both heart rate and respiratory rate and may make it difficult to determine if a patient is truly in cardiac arrest. A victim may also appear clinically dead because of the effects of very low body temperature. Lifesaving procedures, including standard BLS and ACLS, are therefore important to continue until a patient is rewarmed unless the victim is obviously dead (eg, rigor mortis or nonsurvivable traumatic injury). Aggressive rewarming, possibly including invasive techniques, may be required and may necessitate transport to the hospital sooner than would be done in other OHCA circumstances.1 The specific care of patients who are victims of an avalanche are not included in these guidelines but can be found elsewhere.2\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nPatients with accidental hypothermia often present with marked CNS and cardiovascular depression and the appearance of death or near death, necessitating the need for prompt full resuscitative measures unless there are signs of obvious death. Along with providing standard BLS and ALS treatment, next steps include preventing additional evaporative heat loss by removing wet garments and insulating the victim from further environmental exposures. For patients with severe hypothermia (less than 30°C [86°F]) with a perfusing rhythm, core rewarming is often used. Techniques include administration of warm humidified oxygen, warm IV fluids, and intrathoracic or intraperitoneal warm-water lavage.3–5 For patients with severe hypothermia and cardiac arrest, extracorporeal rewarming allows for most rapid rewarming when available.6–11 Severe hyperkalemia and very low core temperatures may also predict resuscitation futility.12,13\n\nWhen the victim is hypothermic, pulse and respiratory rates may be slow or difficult to detect,13,14 and the ECG may even show asystole, making it important to perform lifesaving interventions until the victim is warmed and/or obviously dead. Because severe hypothermia is frequently preceded by other disorders (eg, drug overdose, alcohol use, trauma), it is advisable to look for and treat these underlying conditions while simultaneously treating hypothermia.\n\nThe hypothermic heart may be unresponsive to cardiovascular drugs, pacemaker stimulation, and defibrillation; however, the data to support this are essentially theoretical.15 If VT or VF persists after a single shock, the value of deferring subsequent defibrillations until a target temperature is achieved is uncertain. There is no evidence to suggest a benefit from deviating from standard BLS protocol for defibrillation.\n\nEvidence in humans of the effect of vasopressors or other medications during cardiac arrest in the setting of hypothermia consists of case reports only.11,16,17 A systematic review of several animal studies concluded that use of vasopressors during hypothermic cardiac arrest did increase ROSC.18 No evidence was identified at the time of prior review for harm from following standard ACLS, including vasopressor medications, during hypothermic cardiac arrest.\n\nThis topic last received formal evidence review in 2010.1\n\nSynopsis\n\nSevere exacerbations of asthma can lead to profound respiratory distress, retention of carbon dioxide, and air trapping, resulting in acute respiratory acidosis and high intrathoracic pressure. Deaths from acute asthma have decreased in the United States, but asthma continues to be the acute cause of death for over 3500 adults per year.1,2 Patients with respiratory arrest from asthma develop life-threatening acute respiratory acidosis.3 Both the profound acidemia and the decreased venous return to the heart from elevated intrathoracic pressure are likely causes of cardiac arrest in asthma.\n\nCare of any patient with cardiac arrest in the setting of acute exacerbation of asthma begins with standard BLS. There are also no specific alterations to ACLS for patients with cardiac arrest from asthma, although airway management and ventilation increase in importance given the likelihood of an underlying respiratory cause of arrest. Acute asthma management was reviewed in detail in the 2010 Guidelines.4 For 2020, the writing group focused attention on additional ACLS considerations specific to asthma patients in the immediate periarrest period.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nTension pneumothorax is a rare life-threatening complication of asthma and a potentially reversible cause of arrest.5 Although usually occurring in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, cases in spontaneously breathing patients have been reported.5–7 High peak airway pressures resulting from positive-pressure ventilation can lead to pneumothorax. While difficulty ventilating an asthmatic patient in extremis is more likely due to hyperinflation and high intrathoracic pressure, evaluation for tension pneumothorax remains important.\n\nThe acute respiratory failure that can precipitate cardiac arrest in asthma patients is characterized by severe obstruction leading to air trapping. Because of the limitation in exhalational air flow, delivery of large tidal volumes at a higher respiratory rate can lead to progressive worsening of air trapping and a decrease in effective ventilation. An approach using lower tidal volumes, lower respiratory rate, and increased expiratory time may minimize the risk of auto-PEEP and barotrauma.8\n\nBreath stacking in an asthma patient with limited ability to exhale can lead to increases in intrathoracic pressure, decreases in venous return and coronary perfusion pressure, and cardiac arrest.9–11 This can manifest as increased difficulty ventilating a patient, high airway pressure alarms on a ventilator, or sudden decreases in blood pressure. Brief disconnection from the ventilator or a pause in bag-mask ventilation and compression of the thorax to aid exhalation may relieve hyperinflation.\n\nThis topic last received formal evidence review in 2010.4\n\nSynopsis\n\nCardiac arrest occurs after 1% to 8% of cardiac surgery cases.1–8 Etiologies include tachyarrhythmias such as VT or VF, bradyarrhythmias such as heart block or asystole, obstructive causes such as tamponade or pneumothorax, technical factors such as dysfunction of a new valve, occlusion of a grafted artery, or bleeding. Like all patients with cardiac arrest, the immediate goal is restoration of perfusion with CPR, initiation of ACLS, and rapid identification and correction of the cause of cardiac arrest. Unlike most other cardiac arrests, these patients typically develop cardiac arrest in a highly monitored setting such as an ICU, with highly trained staff available to perform rescue therapies.\n\nThese guidelines are not meant to be comprehensive. A recent consensus statement on this topic has been published by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons.9\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\nCase reports have rarely described damage to the heart due to external chest compressions.10–14 However, other case series have not reported such damage,8 and external chest compressions remain the only means of providing perfusion in some circumstances. In this case, the risk of external chest compressions is far outweighed by the certain death in the absence of perfusion.\n\nVF is the presenting rhythm in 25% to 50% of cases of cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery. Immediate defibrillation by a trained provider presents distinct advantages in these patients, whereas the morbidity associated with external chest compressions or resternotomy may substantially impact recovery. Sparse data have been published addressing this question. Limited data are available from defibrillator threshold testing with backup transthoracic defibrillation, using variable waveforms and energy doses.15–17 First shock success over 90% was observed in most of these studies, though pooled results from 15 studies found a defibrillation success rate of 78% for the first shock, 35% for the second, and 14% for the third shock.18 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Task Force on Resuscitation After Cardiac Surgery9 and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery18 recommend 3 stacked defibrillations within 1 minute, before initiation of CPR. This departure from standard ACLS is likely warranted in the post–cardiac surgery setting because of the highly monitored setting and unique risks of compressions and resternotomy.\n\nIn post–cardiac surgery patients with asystole or bradycardic arrest in the ICU with pacing leads in place, pacing can be initiated immediately by trained providers. Available hemodynamic monitoring modalities in conjunction with manual pulse detection provide an opportunity to confirm myocardial capture and adequate cardiac function. When pacing attempts are not immediately successful, standard ACLS including CPR is indicated. This protocol is supported by the surgical societies,9,18 though no data are available to support its use.\n\nNo RCTs of resternotomy timing have been performed. However, good outcomes have been observed with rapid resternotomy protocols when performed by experienced providers in an appropriately equipped ICU.1,4,8,19–25 Other studies are neutral or show no benefit of resternotomy compared with standard therapy.3,6,26,27 Resternotomy performed outside of the ICU results in poor outcomes.1,3 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons recommends that resternotomy be a standard part of the resuscitation protocols for at least 10 days after surgery.9\n\nNo randomized RCTs have been performed comparing open-chest with external CPR. Two small studies have demonstrated improved hemodynamic effects of open-chest CPR when compared with external chest compressions in cardiac surgery patients.3,4\n\nMultiple case series have demonstrated potential benefit from mechanical circulatory support including ECMO and cardiopulmonary bypass in patients who are refractory to standard resuscitation procedures.24,28–34 No RCT has been performed to date.\n\nThis topic last received formal evidence review in 2010.35 These recommendations were supplemented by a 2017 review published by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons.9\n\nSynopsis\n\nEach year, drowning is responsible for approximatel"
