        "text": "A. Daniel McKenzie (25 March 1924 – 15 August 1989) was a Progressive Conservative party member of the House of Commons of Canada. McKenzie was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and became a communication supervisor by career. He won the seat for the Winnipeg South Centre electoral district in the 1972 federal election and won successive terms in the general elections of 1974, 1979, 1980 and 1984, becoming member for Winnipeg—Assiniboine when riding boundaries were rearranged in 1976. In October 1987, during his last term, \"Fighting Dan\" became somewhat infamous for an incident where he shoved fellow MP John Nunziata (Liberal - York-South Weston) in the House of Commons. He was objecting to Nunziata's sitting in the Prime Minister's seat during a session of Committee of the Whole House. McKenzie will also be remembered as one of the proponents of the plan to annex the Turks and Caicos Islands into Confederation. McKenzie left federal politics in 1988 and did not campaign for another term of office in that year's federal elections. He served consecutive terms in the 29th through 33rd Canadian Parliaments.\n\nArthur Harry Brightwell (born 4 August 1932) was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1984 to 1993. He was a veterinarian by career.Born in Matheson, Ontario, he attended the Ontario Veterinary College in Guelph, Ontario where he graduated in 1956.He campaigned in the 1984 federal election where he won the Perth electoral district for the Progressive Conservative party. He served there for the 33rd Canadian Parliament. When riding boundaries were altered in 1987, Brightwell campaigned in the Perth—Wellington—Waterloo electoral district in the following 1988 federal election. He was re-elected, but by a slim two percent margin over Liberal candidate Mike Stinson. After serving in the 34th Canadian Parliament he lost the riding to John Richardson of the Liberal Party in the 1993 federal election.\n\nAndrew Wesley Stuart (February 11, 1902 – November 29, 1984) was a Canadian commercial fisherman and politician from the Province of New Brunswick. Known by Wes, he was born at Deer Island, New Brunswick, the son of Andrew Holmes Stuart and Laura Gertrude Thompson. Raised in a place where fishing was a major part of the economy, in addition to fishing for a living, he worked as a government fishing industry inspector. In the 1945 Canadian federal election, Stuart was elected as the Liberal Party's candidate for the riding of Charlotte. He was reelected in 1949, 1953, and again in 1957. Wesley Stuart lived on the bank of the St. Croix River and as was common for residents, he frequently travelled across the border to Maine. A proponent of free trade between Canada and the United States, in 1951 Stuart received much publicly in both countries for his statements in the House of Commons of Canada on cross-border smuggling. Time magazine reported that he declared he had \"been a smuggler all his life—and intended to keep on being one,\" adding that he \"never came through [the border] in my lifetime that I did not smuggle something.\" Stuart's straight talk met with wide approval by his constituents and in the ensuing federal election, he won his third term in office with the largest majority of his political career. In the 1958 electoral sweep by the Progressive Conservatives under John Diefenbaker, Stuart lost his seat to Caldwell Stewart. While remaining active in politics, he was the runner up to Louis Robichaud in a bid for leader of the provincial Liberals later in 1958 and went on to serve as the New Brunswick Liberal Party President from 1960 to 1963. On October 23, 1924, he married Julia Marguerite Graham (1899–1961) . The couple had three children (Janet Saint, Roy Graham \"Bud\" Stuart, and Jacqueline (Jackie) Smith). Wesley Stuart died in 1984. He and his wife are buried in the St. Andrews, New Brunswick Rural Cemetery.\n\nAbner Reid McClelan (January 4, 1831 – January 30, 1917) was a Canadian senator and the tenth Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. Born in Riverside-Albert, New Brunswick, the son of Peter McClelan and Lucy (Robinson) McLelan, he was educated at Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy in Sackville, (now Mount Allison University). He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 1854 and served until confederation in 1867 when he was called to the Senate of Canada for the senatorial division of New Brunswick. A Liberal, he resigned in 1896 when he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. He served until 1902. McClelan died in Moncton, New Brunswick in 1917."
