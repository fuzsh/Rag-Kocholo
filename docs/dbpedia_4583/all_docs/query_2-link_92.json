Sherman and the Duke of Wellington. Some figures are represented by a small collection of letters, others by a single item. The Autograph letters have not yet been fully described; researchers wishing to trace correspondence should contact the Rare Books Department.\n\nSPECIAL COLLECTION: BRITISH AND CANADIAN ARMIES IN CANADA, 1758-1891\n\nFor a century after the American Revolution and the peace of 1783, the military in Canada concerned itself almost exclusively with defence against the United States. During the War of 1812 successful defence against the United States was mostly attributable to the British regular regiments and the Royal Navy. In 1838 the regular garrison of British North America numbered over 13,000 men, but fell off to only about 3,000 in 1855 because of the high cost of maintaining such a force. The Militia Act of 1855 set up a new force of volunteers, not more than 5000 strong, which would be uniformed and armed and would undergo a short period of annual training. This volunteer force is the origin of the modern Canadian Army (Militia). The first Militia Act of the Dominion of Canada, passed in 1868, set up a Department of Militia and Defence and divided the country into military districts.\n\nRARE BOOK DEPARTMENT\n\nOriginals, 1758-1891, 16.5 cm (CH250.S227, CH99.S117/CH249.S226, CH6.S42, CH8.S45, CH345.S305, CH292.S252, CH335.S295\n\nThis collection of miscellaneous military documents can be broken down into three series: military administration and records; finances and supplies; and staff. Military records include reports of losses in the War of 1812 and in the Rebellion in Upper Canada, a copy of a report to the Duke of Wellington on the military administration of North America, 1825, and a document on the reconstruction of a monument to Sir Isaac Brock, 1840. Two volumes of army orders for Québec cover the period 1786-1796, while one for the Montréal Garrison Artillery spans 12-22 April, 1870. Finances, supplies, provisions and wages are the subject of a group of warrants, orders, receipts and documents, 1759-1858, while correspondence between the Canadian Army, the Department of the Interior, and David Ross McCord discusses compensation to members of the Red River Expeditionary Force, 1891. Staffing is documented by a census of the Montréal militia and of the Light Infantry and Grenadier Companies of the 1st Battalion, 1812, as well as by appointment letters, 1841.\n\nSPECIAL COLLECTION: MILITARY PAPERS, 1710-1918\n\nFor most of its history, Canada has been defended by either French or English regular troops working in conjunction with local militia units. It was only in 1871 that the last British regulars left central Canada and the first Canadian regular army units were formed. Canadian forces were involved in the supression of the Northwest Rebellion of 1885, the Boer War of 1899-1902 and the First World War, 1914-1918. Although during the First World War the Canadian Corps was technically part of the British army it was commanded by a Canadian, Sir Arthur Currie and enjoyed some measure of autonomy. Until 1917, when conscription was instituted by the Borden government, the Canadian forces were made up entirely of volunteers.\n\nMcCORD MUSEUM\n\nOriginals, 1710-1918, 16 cm (M12953)\n\nThis collection primarily contains official documents pertaining to Canadian military history. These include orderly books, 1782-1783; general orders, 1786-1789, 1830-1851; roll book of No.3 Co. 3rd Victoria Rifles, 1875; correspondence of military officials concerning the career of Quarter Master Sergeant William Clarke, 1827-1841, legal dispositions and records of conviction of persons who aided deserters, 1798-1799; the rules and regulations of the Royal Montreal Cavalry, 1831; and the journal of the No. 3 Canadian General Hospital (McGill), 1915. The official financial records include warrants and correspondence authorizing the payment of soldiers, 1766-1786, 1806-1811; and a supply contract, 1794. Other papers include a diary of Marguerite Gault, 1914.\n\nSPECIAL COLLECTION: NAPLES, UPRISING OF 1647\n\nAfter 1503, Naples was ruled by Spain through a Viceroy. The seggi or municipal administration was dominated by the aristocracy, but there was a small popular representation. While the uprising of July 1647 was provoked by the high cost of living and by taxes, and ostensibly lead by a fisherman named Masaniello, it was in fact organized by Giulio Genoino, a lawyer who wanted the people's voice on the seggi to be equal to the patricians. The rebels attacked prisons and armouries, looted the houses of the nobility, and lynched unpopular persons. After a few days, a settlement was negotiated by the Cardinal Archbishop.\n\nRARE BOOK DEPARTMENT\n\nOriginals, 1740, 204 pp (H105.Bd282)\n\nThis manuscript account of the uprising Racconto della sollevazione di Napoli accaduta nell'anno 1647, was written in 1740.\n\nSPECIAL COLLECTION: NETHERLANDS ARMY, 1814-1815\n\nRARE BOOK DEPARTMENT\n\nOriginals, 1814-1815, 4 cm (H40.N)\n\nThese documents, largely in Dutch, concern the participation of Dutch troops in the Allied army before and at the battle of Waterloo.

In 1759 the British embarked upon the decisive campaign of the war, the seizure of Québec City. The commander of the French defenders of the city was the Governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, although the key military commander was the Marquis de Montcalm. The British forces under James Wolfe captured the city after a battle on the Plains of Abraham where both Montcalm and Wolfe received mortal wounds. In 1763 the loss of the French empire in North America to the British was officially recognized by the Treaty of Paris.\n\nMcCORD MUSEUM\n\nOriginals, 1757, 1759, 2 cm (M22060)\n\nThis small collection consists of two documents: a manuscript journal, 8 May 1759-18 May 1760, of an officer in the 78th Highlanders includes a description of James Wolfe's campaign of 1759 and Lord Amherst's descent of the St. Lawrence, 1760, and a confirmation of a military order of the Marquis de Vaudreuil written by the Marquis de Montcalm, 25 July, 1757.\n\nSPECIAL COLLECTION: WAR OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, 1775-1781\n\nIn 1775, an American army under the command of General Robert Montgomery captured Montréal on behalf of the thirteen American colonies. Montgomery joined with General Benedict Arnold to lay seige to Québec city, however the attack ended in failure and by June of 1776 the Americans were driven from Montréal. The colonies issued their Declaration of Independence in 1776 and finally, after years of battle, England acknowledged the independence of the United States by the Treaty of Paris in 1783.\n\nMcCORD MUSEUM\n\nOriginals, Copies, 1776-1778, 3 cm (M22061)\n\nThe bulk of this collection consists of financial and administrative correspondence of American and British paymasters or commissary agents, mainly from their respective military commanders, George Washington, John Burgoyne, Friedrick von Riedesel and Guy Carleton. Other material in the collection is related to the American capture and occupation of Montréal including copies of the articles of capitulation, 1775 and letters from Benedict Arnold, concerning military intelligence information, 1775 and a directive to Col. J. Livingston instructing him to force his soldiers to pay their rent to Mlle de Ramezay, 1776.\n\nRARE BOOK DEPARTMENT\n\nCopies, 1775-1776, 174 pp (CH14.S50)\n\nThis is a transcript of a journal recording events in Canada between July 1775 and June 1776 relating to the Revolution.\n\nSPECIAL COLLECTION: WAR OF 1812, 1812-1815\n\nIn 1812, the United States of America declared war on Great Britain, claiming that the latter had violated her neutrality. Most of the battles between the two countries took place in Canada and the northern United States. Canadian militia units participated in the war, along side the British regulars. Sir George Prevost, 1767-1816, was the governor-in-chief of the Canadas and the military commander in chief during the war. Sir Issac Brock, 1769-1812 was the military commander of Upper Canada and the provisional Lieutenant-Governor until his death at Queenston Heights in 1813. Other military officers included Major General Edward Baynes, the adjutant general and the commissary general, W.H. Robinson.\n\nMcCORD MUSEUM\n\nOriginals, Copies, 1812-1815, 6.25 cm (M22077)\n\nThe War of 1812 collection contains administrative and financial records of British and Canadian military forces.

Robinson, which consist of payroll estimates and returns, 1812-1815; general accounts, 1811-1818; receipts issued for money and supplies, 1814; and a letter from Issac Brock requesting a saw, 1812. The records concerning military actions include two journals which describe land and sea battles in Upper Canada, 1813; and a letter written by Issac Brock to George Prevost describing his military situation the day before the Battle of Queenston Heights, 1813.\n\nSPECIAL COLLECTION: WELLINGTON, ARTHUR WELLESLEY, DUKE OF, 1769-1852\n\nArthur Wellesley was born in Dublin in 1769.

It's first commander was V.I. Smart, a McGill professor of railway engineering. The McGill C.O.T.C. was formally connected with the 148th (McGill) Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and associated with a number of other units. During the Second World War, the contingent's role was reduced to training officers for the Canadian army. Overall the McGill C.O.T.C. provided military training for more than 12,000 men.\n\nUNIVERSITY ARCHIVES\n\nOriginals, Printed Materials, Photographs, 1914-1966, 1.2 m (M.G. 4006)\n\nThe records of the C.O.T.C. fall into two groups, administrative and historical.\n\nThe administrative records consist of minutes, with some appended reports and correspondence.

One series, covering 1914-1917, consists of newsclippings on C.O.T.C. and the 148th Ballalion. A second and more formal series begins in 1914 and continues through to 1939. Besides press clipping, these scrapbooks contain photographs, orders, invitations, copies of pamphlets, and other records such as the log book of the Ski Camp, 1935-1936. These scrapbooks were the model for the 8-volume Historical Record of the C.O.T.C. during World War II. These volumes contain a running chronology, orders, press extracts and clippings, statistics, photographs and personal reminiscences. The last volume is a service record of all C.O.T.C. members.

The Montréal branch held three fund raising campaigns during the war and was responsible for local relief activities. Sir Herbert Ames, the president of the Montréal branch, was also the honorary secretary of the national fund. The national fund raised and distributed almost fifty million dollars before being terminated in 1937.\n\nMcCORD MUSEUM\n\nOriginals, Printed, 1899-1924, 50 cm (Unaccessioned)\n\nThe administrative and financial records of the Canadian Patriotic Fund, Montréal branch relate to their fund raising and relief activities in Montréal.

His military career began in Upper Canada, where he was gazetted to the Queen's Rangers in 1799. Thence he rose, by purchase, to the rank of lieutenant (1802) and captain (1804) in foot regiments. In 1807 he graduated from the Royal Military College, and in the same year he joined Wellington in the Peninsular Campaign, where he earned promotions as major (1809) and lieutenant-colonel (1811). In 1815 he was created K.C.B. Following Napoleon's return from Elba, Wellington appointed Hardinge as British military commissioner to Prussian headquarters. During the final confrontation with Napoleon, Hardinge commanded a Prussian division, and lost his left hand in the battle of Quatre Bras.\n\nHardinge was elected Tory M.P. for Durham in 1820. He continued his association with Wellington as clerk of ordnance, and when Wellington became Prime Minister in 1828, Hardinge was appointed Secretary of War. He served as Irish Secretary for a short period in 1830, and again in 1834-1835 under Sir Robert Peel. In 1841 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and resumed the duties of Secretary of War until 1844, when he was named Governor-General of India. His victory in the First Sikh War (1845) won him his peerage, but his real achievements in India lay in the areas of economic development, particularly the introduction of railways and tea cultivation, of public education, and of enlightened cultural policy, especially towards the preservation of artistic monuments. Hardinge retired from India in 1848. On the death of Wellington in 1854, Hardinge succeeded his old friend as commander in chief of the forces. He was named field marshal the following year.\n\nRARE BOOK DEPARTMENT\n\nOriginals and Copies, 1803-1856, 6 m and microfilm (Large MSS)\n\nHardinge's papers are divided into two series: manuscripts and correspondence. The manuscripts comprise about 550 documents, reports, memoranda, etc. relating to Hardinge's work as a career soldier and administrator. The Indian phase of his career is the least well covered. Many of these documents were written by others, such as the Duke of Wellington or Lord John Russell, though they contain Hardinge's marginal notes. Papers on the British Army cover such topics as religious services for soldiers, 1823-1844; the organization and reform of military supply departments, 1822-1830; an inquiry into British military education, 1822-1829; and the organization of the Medical Department, 1812-1828. Material on the Home Army covers the period 1814-1850 while material on Ireland, 1816-1843, concern not only the militia, but also more wide ranging economic, social and political issues, such as the commutation of tithes. Papers on British North America, 1815-1844, concentrate on defence of the St. Lawrence Valley and the Maritimes, with special emphasis on canals (Rideau, Lachine, Welland). The strength, distribution, health problems and pay of troops in India, 1846-1847; the fortification of Aden, 1825-1847; and military matters pertaining to the West Indies, Bermuda, Australasia, South Africa, Mauritius, China, the Iberian peninsula and the Crimea are also discussed. It should be noted that the Australian papers also contain a considerable body of civilian population statistics. Hardinge's files also contain materials on military finance, particularly army estimates, 1826-1844; half-pay and pensions, 1812-1832; pay and allowances, 1827-1841; and the finances of the War Office, 1803-1847. Finally, a section of miscellaneous papers includes addresses by {Hardinge, memorials of civil and military officers, cases of military discipline, proposals for new weaponry, and some documents on the reorganization of the government in 1827. The only items of personal interest concern the duel between Wellington and Lord Winchelsea, in which Hardinge was Wellington's second.\n\nThe Hardinge correspondence is of much the same character as the manuscripts. It comprises over 2,000 letters, the largest blocks falling in the periods 1828-1831, 1842-1844, and 1852. There is a particularly substantial body of letters from Wellington and Lord Londonderry.\n\nSupplementing these papers is a microfilm of Hardinge materials in Cambridge University Library. These place more stress on the Indian period, with a large number of letters from Sir Robert Peel.\n\nJOHNSON FAMILY, 1754-1886\n\nBorn in Ireland, William Johnson (1715-1774) came to America in 1738. In 1752 he inherited Admiral Sir Peter Warren's estates in the Mohawk valley of New York and in 1755 was named as the superintendant of Indian affairs for New York. He was knighted for his military exploits during the Seven Years War. His son, Sir John Johnson (1742-1830) a prominent loyalist, organized and led the King's Royal Regiment during the American War of Independence. After the war he came to Canada where he became a large landowner and seigneur of Argenteuil. In 1783 he was given the post of Superintendant General of Indian affairs in British North America. In 1787 he was named to the Legislative Council of Quebec and in 1796 to the Legislative Council for Lower Canada. In 1773, John Johnson married Mary Watts; they had eleven children including John, Maria and James. John, who became a military officer, lived in Chambly, Québec. Maria married Major-General Barnard Bowes who had her brother, Brigade Major James Johnson under his command during the Peninsular War. Both men were killed in the course of the campaign.\n\nMcCORD MUSEUM\n\nOriginals, 1754-1886, 8 cm (M21410)\n\nThe bulk of the Johnson papers consists of correspondence received by Maria Johnson Foord Bowes from her husband Major General Barnard Foord Bowes and her brother Brigade Major James Johnson describing battles in the Peninsular War (1811-1812). Also included are several items of interest from other members of their family: a letter from Col.

A pocket diary records his experiences in 1918 and a copy of a photograph album shows scenes around Mons in 1914. Printed souvenirs, Christmas cards, certificates and medals supplement these documents. Other photographs show Kelly and his family, and the McGill Observatory.\n\nMcKAY, WILLIAM, 1772-1832\n\nEntering the North West Company in 1790, William McKay had become a partner by 1796. After being in charge of the posts at Lake Winnipeg (1799) and Portage La Prairie (1805) he retired from the fur trade in 1807. He became a member of the Beaver Club in Montréal and in 1808 married Eliza Davidson. He fought in the War of 1812 and led the British forces to victory at Prairie-du-Chien. After the war he became a lieutenant-colonel and was appointed the Superintendant of Indian Affairs at Drummond Island, Upper Canada (now Michigan). Captain Thomas Anderson served under McKay at Drummond Island as a storekeeper, clerk and interpretor. Drummond Island was occupied by British troops in 1815 but returned to the Americans in 1828.\n\nMcCORD MUSEUM\n\nOriginals, Copies, 1810-1878, 8 cm (M22066)\n\nThe William Mackay papers mainly consist of military records such as commissions, 1813-1814, correspondence with Lt.

The other portion of his papers is made up of notebooks pertaining to his tenure as Superintendant of Indian Affairs at Drummond Island from 1816 to 1823.\n\nMcKEE, JOHN, fl 1855-1865\n\nA Baltimore businessman, John McKee was arrested by the American government in 1863 on the charge of shipping goods to the Confederacy. He was imprisoned in Fort Lafayette, which was located in the harbour of New York. Although he was released from prison in the spring of 1864 his former fellow prisoners continued to write to him, asking for provisions, his aid in business matters and giving news of prison life. Soon after, he moved to Montréal and by 1865 was a general shipping and commission merchant in Liverpool.\n\nMcCORD MUSEUM\n\nOriginals, 1855, 1863-1865, 20 cm (Unaccessioned)\n\nThe bulk of the John McKee papers reflects the experience of prisoners of war in Fort Lafayette, New York with some material which document his private life. They consist of correspondence to John McKee and to a family friend, Mrs Henry Barling, from prisoners of war such as George M.D. Stoll, J. William Davis and John T. Prichard, 1864. Prisoners' writings and a manuscript entitled \"Fort Lafayette Life, 1863-1864 by a Young Lady\" provide more details of prison life. There is also correspondence from his daughter, Mary T.

TRAVEL AND EXPLORATION\n\nMONTECUCCOLI, RAIMONDO, 1608-1681\n\nRaimondo Montecuccoli was one of the outstanding strategists of the 17th century. Born in Modena, Italy, he began his military career in Germany, in a regiment of Imperial dragoons. His successes in various engagements in the Thirty Years' War brought his rapid advancement to the rank of field marshall. In 1657, the Emperor sent him to Poland to help reinstate King John Casimir, and in the following year he joined the Elector of Brandenburg to help the King of Denmark. His most famous campaign, however, was waged against the Turks in Transylvania (1661-1664). From 1672 to 1675 he commanded the Imperial Forces against the French under Turenne. Turenne's death gave Montecuccoli the ultimate victory, but he retired immediately due to ill health. He passed the remainder of his life in Vienna, devoting himself to his studies and to composing his memoirs published in 1708.\n\nRARE BOOK DEPARTMENT\n\nOriginals, n.d.
