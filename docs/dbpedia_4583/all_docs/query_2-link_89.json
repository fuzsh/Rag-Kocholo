The remaining part of the total thrust is derived from…\n\nturbojet (engineering)\n\nturbojet, jet engine in which a turbine-driven compressor draws in and compresses air, forcing it into a combustion chamber into which fuel is injected. Ignition causes the gases to expand and to rush first through the turbine and then through a nozzle at the rear. Forward thrust is generated as a\n\nturbopause (atmosphere)\n\natmosphere: Vertical structure of the atmosphere: …and heterosphere, is called the turbopause.\n\nturboprop (engineering)\n\nturboprop, hybrid engine that provides jet thrust and also drives a propeller. It is basically similar to a turbojet except that an added turbine, rearward of the combustion chamber, works through a shaft and speed-reducing gears to turn a propeller at the front of the engine. The first\n\nturboramjet\n\njet engine: Turboramjets: As noted above, the ramjet provides a simple and efficient means of propulsion for aircraft at relatively high supersonic flight speeds. It is, however, quite inefficient at transonic flight speeds and is completely ineffective at subsonic velocities. The turboramjet has been developed to overcome…\n\nturboshaft (engineering)\n\njet engine: Turboshaft engines: The helicopter is designed to operate for substantial periods of time hovering at zero flight speed. Even in forward flight, helicopters rarely exceed 240 kilometres per hour or a Mach number of 0.22. (The Mach number is the ratio of the velocity of…\n\nturbosupercharger (device)\n\nsupercharger: …brought the introduction of the turbosupercharger, or simply turbocharger, a centrifugal blower driven by a small gas turbine powered by the exhaust gases from the engine cylinders.\n\nturbot (fish)\n\nturbot, (Psetta maxima), broad-bodied European flatfish of the family Scophthalmidae. A highly valued food fish, the turbot lives along sand and gravel shores. It is a left-sided flatfish, with its eyes normally on the left side of the head, and it is scaleless, though its head and body are studded\n\nTurbot War (Canada and Spain [1995])\n\nexclusive economic zone: Examples of international disputes involving EEZs: …to conflicts such as the Turbot War, which was a bloodless dispute between Canada and Spain. In 1995 a Spanish fleet was fishing for turbot 28 miles (45 km) beyond Canada’s EEZ, which was a disputed area where Ottawa attempted to extend its jurisdiction. Turbot populations in the area were…\n\nTurbotrain (transportation)\n\nturbo train, high-speed passenger train powered by a gas-turbine engine similar to that used in jet aircraft. Unlike conventional trains, the turbo variety does not have a separate locomotive; its turbine power unit is small enough to be built into a passenger car. A typical turbo train consists of\n\nTurbott Wolfe (work by Plomer)\n\nWilliam Plomer: His first novel, Turbott Wolfe (1925), caused a scandal because it touched upon miscegenation and dared to criticize the supposed benevolence of whites toward blacks, even casting some white characters in the role of villains. I Speak of Africa (1927), a collection of short stories, exacerbated his reputation.…\n\nturbulence (physics)\n\nturbulence, In fluid mechanics, a flow condition (see turbulent flow) in which local speed and pressure change unpredictably as an average flow is maintained. Common examples are wind and water swirling around obstructions, or fast flow (Reynolds number greater than 2,100) of any sort. Eddies,\n\nturbulence inversion (meteorology)\n\ntemperature inversion: A turbulence inversion often forms when quiescent air overlies turbulent air. Within the turbulent layer, vertical mixing carries heat downward and cools the upper part of the layer. The unmixed air above is not cooled and eventually is warmer than the air below; an inversion then…\n\nturbulence, atmospheric (meteorology)\n\natmospheric turbulence, small-scale, irregular air motions characterized by winds that vary in speed and direction. Turbulence is important because it mixes and churns the atmosphere and causes water vapour, smoke, and other substances, as well as energy, to become distributed both vertically and\n\nturbulence, primordial (astronomy)\n\nnebula: Turbulence: …always show chaotic motions called turbulence. This is a well-known phenomenon in gas dynamics that results when there is low viscosity in flowing fluids, so the motions become chaotic eddies that transfer kinetic and magnetic energy and momentum from large scales down to small sizes. On small-enough scales viscosity always…\n\nturbulent flow (physics)\n\nturbulent flow, type of fluid (gas or liquid) flow in which the fluid undergoes irregular fluctuations, or mixing, in contrast to laminar flow, in which the fluid moves in smooth paths or layers. In turbulent flow the speed of the fluid at a point is continuously undergoing changes in both"
