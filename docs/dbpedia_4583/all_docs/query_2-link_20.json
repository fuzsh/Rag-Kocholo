The length and breadth of the new country made it difficult to unite the Loyalist descendants in the common cause of keeping the Loyalist history alive and telling it to their countrymen and to the world. In 1913, the various provincial societies met in Toronto to discuss their future. Col. George A.S. Ryerson strongly advised the delegates that the best solution rested in uniting local and provincial societies into a Dominion of Canada association. This advice was unanimously approved by the delegates, including, Dr. W.O. Raymond, New Brunswick; the Rev. Canon Alfred Brown, Halifax; Mr. George H. Ham, Montreal; Sir John Beverley Robinson, Edgewater, New Jersey; His Honour Hedley Clarence Taylor, Edmonton; Mr. H.S. Seaman, Winnipeg; Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, Vancouver; Lieut. Col. George Alexander Shaw, Sir Alien Aylesworth and Lieut. Col. William Hamilton Merritt, all of Toronto.\n\nThe meeting was chaired by Col. Ryerson, and drafted a constitution, to incorporate local and provincial societies into a united body, drawing up a set of by-laws for the purpose. An Act (Chapter 146, 4-5, Geo. V, 1914), May 27, 1914, was passed by the Parliament of Canada. The Prime Minister was Robert Borden. The Act incorporated “The United Empire Loyalists’ Association of Canada”, authorizing its operation in all Provinces and Territories of Canada, and to be controlled under a central body, based in the City of Toronto, Province of Ontario.\n\nA copy of the Charter can be read here.\n\nFor more information and details, see The UELAC: Its Beginnings and Evolution\n\nThe history is split into these five chapters:\n\nCommemorating the Loyalists in the 19th Century\n\nThe Founding of the UELAC\n\nGrowth of the Association – Branches\n\nBiographies of the Petitioners to form a Canadian UEL Association\n\nPresidents of UELAC.\n\n“The Story Continues…” at the UELAC 2024 Conference\n\nJune 6-9, 2024 at Cornwall, Ontario\n\nThe conference has three main groupings of events:\n\nPre-Conference day-tours: Tues June 4 to Thurs June 6\n\nUELAC Conference: Evening Thurs June 6 through Sunday June 9\n\n240th Anniversary of New Johnstown & The Royal Townships: Fri June 7 through Sun June 9\n\nUELAC has scheduled Sat daytime for conference attendees to visit and learn.\n\nAnd so “The [Loyalist] Story Continues….”\n\nThursday 6 June, Reception\n\nPresident Carl Stymiest UE will “open” the conference with welcome remarks.\n\nTime to enjoy finger foods, reconnect with old friends and make new ones.\n\nSaturday 8 June.

What I mean to say is that history is nothing more than an amalgamation of tangible artifacts and facts that together make a coherent narrative about that which is said to have happened once upon a time. Heritage, on the other hand, is that which we choose to emphasize and remember about our history. Heritage is our history preserved. In other words, heritage is what we believe matters about the past in the present. As such, we don’t preserve history simply because it is history, but rather because it is our history and it continues to hold meaning in the present. But how do we communicate the meaning of history to new and younger audiences? How do we ensure that our history continues to hold heritage-value in the present and into the future? These and other matters will be discussed in the context of the UELAC at this year’s keynote address.\n\nSunday 9 June.

Part One of Two\n\ncopyright Stephen Davidson UE\n\nThe accounts of Loyalist refugees are stories of survival – escaping from the persecution of neighbours, from rebel prisons, and from the attacks of Patriot soldiers. For many Loyalists, they only lived to share their wartime experiences of the American Revolution because of the intervention of doctors, nurses, orderlies, and apothecaries who treated their wounds in military hospitals. Their survival depended upon the skills of those who had the best understanding of 18th century medicine and medical procedures.\n\nSome of the health care workers who helped the wounded and poor in health have their names recorded in the transcripts of the Royal Commission on the Losses and Services of American Loyalists. Others are listed in the Book of Negroes. An examination of these primary sources allows us to learn more about an often-neglected aspect of Loyalist history.\n\nFrom September 1776 to November 1783, New York City served as the headquarters of the British military forces. In addition to its commissary, barracks, and munitions magazines, the king’s army also had a hospital on Manhattan Island. One of the first doctors on the General Hospital’s staff was 35 year-old Dr. James Boggs of Monmouth County, New Jersey.\n\nJoining the staff in July 1777, he described his position as being a “mate” of the hospital. Boggs’ daily rate of pay was 7shillings 6 pence, a sum that did not change when Sir Guy Carleton later made him the “assistant surgeon on the staff” in September of 1783. (He also worked in a field hospital for a time in 1779 when he was the surgeon’s mate with the 2nd Battalion of the New Jersey Volunteers.)\n\nGiven the number of battles and skirmishes that were fought within a hundred mile radius of New York City, Boggs would have been busy treating soldiers, sailors, and Loyalists who had suffered musket wounds, stabbings, and cannon blasts. After the evacuation of New York, the Loyalist doctor continued to be part of the royal army’s medical staff in Halifax, Nova Scotia — a position he held until 1810. He died there in 1832 at the age of 91.\n\nPeter Brown was another loyalist physician and surgeon who had practised in Newark, New Jersey where he earned as much as £400 a year. At the outbreak of the revolution, he was compelled to serve as the surgeon for a rebel militia for five days. Thanks to a British officer who could vouch for Brown’s loyalty, Sir William Howe, then commander of Britain’s forces in North America, had the Loyalist appointed to the General Hospital. After serving in its wards until the end of the revolution, Brown settled in Windsor, Nova Scotia. There, he saw to the medical needs of the soldiers stationed at Fort Edward. He died on April, 8, 1787.\n\nA native of Worcester, Massachusetts, Dr. William Paine had his medical training recognized when the British made him the “apothecary to the army in America“. (Similar to today’s pharmacist, an apothecary was someone who prepared and sold medicines and drugs.) Little wonder, then, that the Patriots of Massachusetts denounced him as a traitor\n\nPaine served in a variety of locations. He was in South Carolina for a time as he “was the only person able to do Business of the Hospital in that Climate, owing to the sickness of the others.” He then served as doctor for the British garrison in Rhode Island before being posted to the General Hospital in New York. In 1781, at the age of 31, Paine was ordered to travel to Lisbon, Portugal with Lord Winchelsea as the latter’s personal physician.\n\nA year later, Sir Guy Carleton made Paine “physician to the army” at the military hospital in Halifax. At the end of the war, the doctor received a rather desolate land grant on Passamaquoddy Bay, and so he decided to settle in Saint John, New Brunswick instead. As well as continuing in his profession, Paine became involved in colonial politics. He served in the House of Assembly as an elected member and its clerk – and later became the Deputy-Surveyor of the King’s Forests.\n\nHowever, the loyalist doctor never lost his homesickness for Massachusetts. In 1787, he obtained permission from the British war office to return to the colony of his birth. Six years later, he was living in Worcester once more. He died there on April 19, 1833 at age eighty-three.\n\nDr. Samuel Clossy emigrated from Ireland to New York in 1763 in the hopes of working at the city’s hospital. Instead, he became the head of the Department of Anatomy at the medical school established by Kings College. His anatomy lessons required bodies he acquired by digging up bodies from either the “potter’s field” or the Negro burial ground. Later, his loyalist political views forced him to find sanctuary in New Jersey.\n\nWhen the British army occupied New York in the fall of 1776, Clossy returned to work in the military hospital, serving on staff until 1780. He was paid 5 shillings per day as a “Mate to the hospital“. Clossy returned to Ireland and died there on August 22, 1786 at age 62. As pointed out by the writer Andy McPhee, “Clossy would not live to witness the anger and violence of the Doctor’s Riot of 1788, a riot prompted by the practice of body snatching.”\n\nDr. John Watson immigrated from Scotland to New Castle, Delaware in 1767. For his first ten years of practise, he “remained quiet and unmolested“. His public “sentiments in favour of the British Government” led to his being “insulted as a Tory“. When Sir William. Howe landed his British forces in nearby Maryland, rebels forced Watson to join a Patriot regiment as its surgeon. “This he was obliged to do or go to Prison. He told a friend that he hated the Rebels and meant to make his escape to the British Army.”\n\nWatson was able to escape, joining Howe on August 24, 1777. “He remained with the British all the War. … He was made mate of the Hospital with an appointment of 5 shillings per day.” Three years later, Sir Henry Clinton made Watson as the “apothecary to all the Hospitals in America“, giving him wages of 10 shillings a day.\n\nAt Watson’s compensation hearing in London in 1784, a British officer testified that the doctor was “a very active man and believes he was always ready to give every service in his power. He remembers his being made apothecary to the Hospital at New York and believes it was from his good behaviour.”\n\nThe British military hired Loyalist medical staff members for its other hospitals within its North American colonies during the revolution. Their stories will be recounted in next week’s Loyalist Trails.\n\nTo secure permission to reprint this article contact the author at stephendavids@gmail.com.\n\nConstruing Congress’s Hasty, Ill-fated 1775 Decision to Invade Canada\n\nby Gene Procknow 21 May 2024 Journal of the American Revolution\n\nJust sixty days after the start of armed hostilities at Lexington Green, the Continental Congress’s decision to invade Canada resulted in one of the worst defeats in the War for Independence. While exact casualty figures are difficult to discern, likely half of the American forces sent north were killed in battle, wounded, captured, or died of disease. The attacking Rebel Army retreated disease-ridden and in disarray, resulting in the Northern Army’s combat ineffectiveness. Before the invasion, the Canadians did not firmly commit to open hostilities against British rule or even send delegates to the First or Second Continental Congresses. Why did a newly formed Congress authorize an invasion of the rebellion-reticent Canada?\n\nHistorians posit several explanations for the Rebel offensive, such as the initial expression of manifest destiny, the first in a long line of American wars of liberation, or a rage militaire overcoming sagacious Congressional judgment. While these reasons place the Canadian incursion decision in an insightful historical context, they look backward using information from subsequent eras and perspectives. A forward look at the period’s events, from the outbreak of combat to Congress’s invasion order, reveals a series of misjudgments based upon faulty intelligence, overestimating threats, a lack of strategic military foresight, and insufficient Congressional control over the military.

Hagist 23 May 2024 in Journal of the American Revolution\n\nWhen Bryan McSweeny stepped ashore on Staten Island in August 1776, it must have looked like a paradise. He had spent the previous three years in Jamaica, in a tropical climate that was often fatal to Europeans; now, he saw a verdant landscape and felt temperatures similar to his native town of Macroom in County Cork, Ireland. But unlike peaceful Jamaica, which had avoided the violence of the recent Carib War, Staten Island was the staging point for a new British military offensive in the rebellious American colonies.\n\nMcSweeny was a private soldier in the 50th Regiment of Foot. He had volunteered for the army in 1768—during peacetime and for most of the American Revolution the British Army was an all-volunteer force—and now had eight years of soldiering under his belt including his three years in Jamaica. The regiment was ordered from that island to join the massive military buildup on Staten Island. But the disease-prone Caribbean climate had taken its toll, and the 50th was now under strength with many men unfit for service. There were other regiments on Staten Island that had been in North America for several years and also needed more men. Rather than add a newly-arrived regiment that was not fit for service into the order of battle, the army’s commander, Gen. William Howe, directed that the regiment be drafted.\n\nDrafting, during this era, meant transferring soldiers from one regiment to another.

Our company drilled for the first time.\n\n15 March. Today Second Lieutenant von Ciriacy, of the Colonel’s Company, transferred to Quesnoy’s Company, and Second Lieutenant [Johann Gottlieb] Hirsch, of Quesnoy’s Company, came in exchange to Colonel Seybothen’s Company.\n\n17 March. I sent two letters to Germany.\n\n19 March. I participated in church parade in the city.\n\n20 March. I went on watch at the East Wharf.\n\n22 March. During the evening, after tattoo, I went with a strong command. It was drawn from all the regiments which lay here in New York and consisted of four hundred men under the command of the Scottish Major Kleevlington and Captain Tannenburg of the Hessians. We were carried in boats across the North River to the province of New Jersey. Then we marched almost the entire night, at the quickest pace and as silently as possible, mostly through forests. Toward three o’clock in the morning we reached Hackensack, a large and beautiful settlement consisting of about two hundred houses. This village was attacked and all houses were immediately broken into and everything ruined; doors, windows, boxes, and chests, everything lumped together and plundered. All the males were taken prisoners, and the townhall and some other splendid buildings were set on fire. We took considerable booty, money, silver pocket watches, silver plate and spoons, as well as furniture, good clothing, fine English linen, good silk stockings, gloves, and neckcloths, as well as other expensive silks, satins, and other materials. This village of Hackensack lies sixteen English miles from New York and has rich inhabitants.\n\n23 March. At daybreak we again marched out of Hackensack. We wished to proceed two miles further to Pollingtown, a small city where we hoped to capture a rebel command of two hundred men. However, because we were betrayed by spies and the rebels came against us from all sides, we had to begin the return march. They would have taken all of us prisoners, because they were five or six times stronger than we were, if Colonel [Andreas] Emmerich of the English had not joined us with four hundred light infantry and jaegers. On the previous day they had been transferred across the North River beyond Kingsbridge and were to have supported us during the attack on Pollingtown. [Colonel Emmerich] covered our flank as soon as he had joined us, and we slowly pulled back under a steady fire, which last more than six hours. During this time we threw away or discarded most of our furniture booty. At eight o’clock in the evening we again arrived at New York, after the enemy had followed us to the water of the North River. From this expedition we had dead three Scots, eleven English and Hessians; and Private Br, of our regiment, made prisoner.\n\nOn this day my life was exposed to many hundreds of bullets. My booty, which I had been fortunate enough to retain, consisted of two silver pocket watches, three silver buckles, one pair of women’s white cotton stockings, one pair of men’s summer stockings, two men’s and four women’s shirts of fine English linen, two fine tablecloths, one silver food and tea spoon, five Spanish dollars and six York shillings in money, eleven complete mattress covers of fine linen, and more than two dozen pieces of silk fabric, as well as six silver plates and one silver drinking cup, all tied together in a pack which, because of the hasty march, I had to throw away.\n\n25 March. Private [Konrad] Hassfurther, of Quesnoy’s Company, had to run a gauntlet of two hundred men eight times because of a quarrel with a Hessian officer.\n\n28 March. I went on the naval-stores watch. This was an English warehouse where there were many barrels of rum, salted meat, and other victuals.\n\n(to be continued)\n\nAdvertised on 24 May 1774: “A Negro runaway….or English punishment?”\n\nWho was the subject of an advertisement in a colonial American newspaper 250 years ago today?\n\n“RUN away … a negro man about 27 years of age.”\n\nAn advertisement in the May 24, 1774, edition of the Connecticut Courant offered a reward for the capture and return of an unnamed “negro man about 27 years of age” who liberated himself by running away from Thomas Moses, his enslaver. Moses provided a description, declaring that the “negro man … lisps in his speech” and wore “a brown coat and red waistcoat, a white holland shirt, a new castor hat, a new pair of leather breeches, [and] a pair of blue stockings.” He also took other clothing with him, items that he could use to vary his appearance or sell in his efforts to make good on his escape. Moses stated that he would present ten dollars to “Whoever shall take up said negro and return him to me” or five dollars to whoever would “secure him in any of his majesty’s goals [jails] and send me word so that I may have him again.” In a nota bene, he warned, “All persons are hereby forbid to harbour said negro on penalty of law.”\n\nThe first half of that advertisement appeared at the bottom of a column that featured an editorial with a headline that proclaimed, “JOIN OR DIE!!!” A more extensive version first ran in the May 16 edition of the Newport Mercury as a combination of news and opinion. An abbreviated version, the first paragraph, then circulated in other newspapers as printers followed the common practice of reprinting items from one publication to another. The shorter version featured an additional exclamation mark for emphasis. The editorial commented on the Boston Port Act and Parliament’s intention “to reduce its spirited inhabitants to the most servile and mean compliance ever attempted to be imposed on a free people.” This new legislation was “infinitely more alarming and dangerous to our common liberties, than even that hydra the Stamp Act.” While directed at Boston in retaliation for the destruction of tea the previous December, the Boston Port Act, according to the anonymous author, was also “a direct hostile invasion of every province on the continent.” The people of Boston “nobly stood as a barrier against slavery.” Now residents of other towns needed to do the same “to stand … for the relief, support, and animation of our brethren in the insulted, besieged capital of Massachusetts-Bay” because “nothing but unity, resolution, and perseverance, can save ourselves and posterity from what is worse than death — SLAVERY.”\n\nConnecticut Courant (May 24, 1774).\n\nTwice in a single paragraph, the author of the editorial invoked slavery as the consequence of Parliament’s treatment of the colonies.

Moy (Anthem Press, 2024. $110.00)\n\nReview by Kelsey DeFord 20 May 2024 Journal of the American Revolution\n\nDaniel R. Moy’s Antiquity and Loyalist Dissent in Revolutionary America attempts to analyze ideological warfare between Whigs and Tories, with particular attention to ancient Greco-Roman and Mediterranean influences. Moy, currently a lecturer at the University of Virginia Frank Batten School, published this version of his thesis for the doctorate degree he received in 2012. British colonists were fascinated with the rise and fall of the Greco-Roman empires of Sparta, Athens, and Rome. Curriculum at universities was responsible for this; most taught classical humanism and Latin, important components for being a “gentleman” in society. Some English colonists believed the British Empire reflected the legacy and ideologies of great republics. By the 1760s there was a divide, with early resistance challenging legitimacy of the monarchy. Yet, Moy argues that Whigs and Tories alike used classics to support both resistance and reconciliation.\n\nTories used antiquities and literature such as Cicero and the Catiline conspiracy, and Moy shows that this is further illustrated in J. Hector St. John De Crèvecoeur’s American Belisarius. Tories used antiquities to question Whigs’ civic virtue, as this was the foundation upon which Rome was built. To Tories, Whigs represented an unchecked and corrupt mob which previously led to Rome’s fall.

More importantly, our misappropriation of “puritan” has allowed scholars to ignore and the public to misunderstand religion. The price we pay in the present is a stunted and politicized understanding of the past. Instead, I propose we choose more accurate terms, accepting that “puritan” is almost never what we intend.\n\nThe term “puritan” emerged during the sixteenth century in debates over the nature of the Church of England. Supporters of the church’s modest reformation derided opponents who wanted a more vigorously reformed church as “puritan.” These critics sought to impose Calvinist style discipline on their communities. As a result, the label entered popular use as a taunt against those seen as rigid and judgmental. Unsurprisingly, the subjects of the term “puritan” never embraced the epithet.\n\nThis period in English history when godly reformers worked within the established church in hopes of its reformation lasted until the 1630s, when Archbishop William Laud’s persecutions dashed these hopes.

I do have to say that I do agree with many of his rather amusing observations and let’s be honest, there are plenty which are used today which make little sense, so here we go:\n\nA lady says to her husband, whom she thinks not such good company as he might be, “Come, leave off reading, my dear”.

Simcoe Branch: “The Northern Brigaden” by Gavin Watt 29 May 7:30\n\n“The Northern Brigade Later in the Revolution” The Northern Brigade would be supported by a few British Regular regiments and the 84th’s first battalion. The brigade included these loyalist regiments – Royal Yorkers, Butler’s Rangers, Jessup’s Loyal Rangers and Roger’s 2nd Bn, King’s Rangers.\n\nSir John Johnson was the brigadier general of those loyalists as well as the Superintendent General of Northern Indians with the Six Nations’ and Seven Nations of Canada’s departments and their large numbers of rangers. Johnson had a very heavy responsibility.\n\nGavin Watt will likely never retire form his avocation, military history. To those of us with Loyalist interests, his presence has been keenly appreciated. Gavin is the founder, and was Officer Commanding, of the recreated King’s Royal Yorkers from 1975-2006, and until 2017 continued his valued involvement. Gavin has researched extensively the military actions and people of the American Revolution, and authored or co-authored several books.

How dark? A candle was needed to see outside at noon! It began around 9am when smoke crossed the western skies and merged with clouds from the ocean.\n\nThe mix of smoke and clouds resulted in total darkness by 1030 am. Rivers and streams smelled of soot. Boston smelled like a coal-kin. Panic ensued in many communities, sent children home from school, left work, and went to church to pray. It stretched from Portland, Maine, to New Jersey.\n\nIn New Jersey, General George Washington included it in his diary: “Heavy & uncommon kind of Clouds–dark & at the same time a bright and reddish kind of light intermixed with them–brightning & darkning alternately,” Washington wrote. “This continued till afternoon when the sun began to appear. The Wind in the Morning was Easterly. After that it got to the Westward.”\n\nWhat was it? Not climate change.\n\nMany thought it was judgment day or a rebuke for mankind’s sins. Some thought it was an eclipse, but later studies pointed to massive fires in western Canada. The resultant smoke pushed east by the prevailing winds mixed with clouds did the trick. image\n\n21 May 1780 Johnstown, NY.

Robe à la Française, 1740-60, silk satin w/silk & metallic-thread Today we rarely think of creating clothing meant to last a decade, let alone centuries.\n\nRiding Habit Jacket, 1760-70. Unusual because it is made in fustian (cotton weft/linen warp) twill, not wool.Perfect for a UK summer.\n\nSeveral years ago, while researching at Bowen Textile Collection at Uof New Hampshire library with consulting curator Astrida Schaeffer I viewed an elegant cream silk damask dress, mid-18thc+ This is the real deal, boxed, w/o conservation or preparation – yet breathtaking in its beauty\n\nAn open robe from the 2nd half of the 18th century. The silk is c.1760s, but the gown was remodelled c. late 1770s to early 1780s. Carnations are seen in the pattern – a flower currently blooming in the UK.\n\nSmall bed cover of silk patchwork, Kent, the silks made c. 1680-1700, and made up c. 1700-1720\n\nThis patchworked bed cover was made by Priscilla Redding. She was born in Deal Castle, where her father was governor. There are few surviving early accounts about quilt makers, but hers is one of them. In her diary she wrote about her life and recorded family births and deaths.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nMany parts of Jamestown Settlement’s re-created Susan Constant, Godspeed and Discovery share names with animals or parts of animals. As you look at the images you can also read Henry Mainwaring’s descriptions of the various parts of the ship, from “The Seaman’s Dictionary.”\n\nA beautiful Teabowl and saucer from the Meissen factory, 1725-30, hard-paste porcelain, perhaps by Johann Gregorius Höroldt\n\nCirca 1790 musical tall case clock made and owned by Daniel Burnap (1759-1838) of East Windsor, Connecticut, can play six different tunes, still in working order! On view at @TheWadsworth\n\nMudlark: Can you see the weave of 400 year old cloth pressed into the back of this lead cloth seal? Seals like this were attached to bolts of woollen cloth to prove it was of quality and the relevant taxes had been paid. They often have the initials or symbols of the alagner or cloth merchant on one side, but if you turn them over, they sometimes also also have, the impression of the warp and weft of the cloth itself.\n\nLast Post: WEIRMEIR, Arnold Vernon, 19 April, 1930 – 19 May, 2024\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of our beloved father Arnold V.
