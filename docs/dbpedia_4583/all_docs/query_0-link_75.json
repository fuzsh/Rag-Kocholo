Amherst Gazette Steam Printing House, 1885\n\nHistorical Record of the Posterity of William Black\n\nby Cyrus Black (1811 1900 )\n\n*Chignecto Project Electronic Edition, March 1999.*\n\nEdition used: Historical Record of the Posterity of William Black, Amherst, N.S.: Amherst Gazette Steam Printing House, 1885.\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe object in compiling these pages is that the present and future generations may have a knowledge of their ancestors. An effort has been made to procure the name of every descendant of William Black, Esq., who, with his family, came from Yorkshire, England, to this country in the year 1775.\n\nThe difficulties encountered in the prosecution of this work, entailing research over more than a century, are such that we feel obliged to appeal for sympathy, which few, except those engaged in a similar work, have the power to bestow. Documentary information was not to be found, and many of the descendants are widely separated. In order to procure a correct knowledge of facts, many families have been visited in various parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, many have been solicited by letter, and very many others interrogated on the street and at their homes. Yet with all the effort put forth it is impossible to get the whole of the names required, though the success has been excellent. Wherein there are failures the writer claims forbearance.\n\nThe names given in the Black connection are so numerous that it appeared requisite to define the relationship held to the first William Black. The reader, therefore, will find that in the introduction of his grand-children the names are in small capitals.\n\nIt was at first intended that this History should be limited to William Black’s descendants; but the work is enlarged by notice of many of the first emigrants from Yorkshire and their families, and also of Loyalists from the United States, and others from the British Colonies, as then existing, to whom were granted large tracts of land.\n\nThe work lays no claim to literary merit, the object being to give concise statements of facts.\n\nThe record is brought down to 1883.\n\nThe persons to whom the writer is indebted for assistance in the work are too numerous to mention; but he desires to express special obligations to R. B. C. Weldon, Esq., of Boundary Creek, Westmorland County, Rufus S. Purdy, Esq., of Wentworth, and S. Hiram Trueman, of P.E. Island.\n\nHISTORICAL RECORD OF THE FAMILIES OF THE NAME OF BLACK.\n\n__________\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nWilliam Black was born in Paisley, Scotland, in the year 1727.\n\nHis father was a public officer, and possessed an independent fortune. His leisure was largely employed in the chase, and he kept a good pack of hounds. Until William was twenty-one years of age he had turned his attention to little else than the recreation of following the hounds. Soon after this he engaged as travelling salesman for a large manufacturing concern. In one of his tours he met an English lady in Huddersfield, England–Elizabeth Stocks–whom he married. About the same time he engaged in the linen and woollen drapery business.\n\nBy the spelling of the name Stocks, in the will of Thomas Stocks, STOKES, his sister–Mrs. Black–and her heirs were deprived of twenty thousand pounds of the property, which went to a maiden lady named Stokes, who was a connection of Mrs. Stocks. Mrs. Black’s portion was thus reduced to fifteen hundred pounds.\n\nMrs. Black, as well as her husband, moved in the higher circles of fashion and refinement. She was accustomed to follow the hounds. When she came to Nova Scotia, she brought the scarlet riding habit and the cap she used to wear when engaged in the chase; also, dresses of embroidered white satin and other rich and costly materials for which she found but little use in the new country.\n\nA few years after his marriage William Black’s mind was drawn toward Nova Scotia, as a most desirable country.\n\nAt that time there were rich agricultural districts in the province untenanted in consequence of the expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia in the year 1755. An unbroken stillness had for several years reigned over the ruins which showed the sites of the former dwellings of those expelled.\n\nIn the year 1758 Governor Lawrence, who was then Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, had given invitations to the inhabitants of the New England colonies, inviting such as might be disposed to do so to come over and occupy those lands, offering them liberal inducements.\n\nThese people were more readily induced to leave New England and come to Nova Scotia by the liberal agreement, ratified by the Governor, that they should have the unrestricted liberty of exercising all their civil and religious rights, there being at the time some restrictions to religious liberty laid on some of the denominations residing in New York, Virginia, and other of the then British Colonies (now constituting the United States). Governor Lawrence therefore issued a proclamation securing full liberty of conscience and worship to all denominations of christians. These worthy people in coming to Nova Scotia found themselves relieved from burdens they had borne at home.\n\nAmong those who came from New England was a small Baptist Church which emigrated en masse from Massachusetts to Sackville (then Nova Scotia), now New Brunswick, in the year 1763. They brought their pastor with them and the church was soon after considerably enlarged.\n\nMichael Franklin, who at that time was Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, engaged several families to emigrate from Yorkshire, England, to Nova Scotia in the year 1772. These people arrived in Cumberland on the 21st May, having been detained a few weeks in Halifax. Others came in 1773 and in 1774 from the same place and settled in different parts at the head of the Bay of Fundy.\n\nOur object at present is to speak of William Black and his descendants, yet we shall refer to many other prominent families.\n\nMr. Black (then of Huddersfield, England) after some careful reflection respecting a removal to America, prudently concluded to see the country before removing his family thither. In accordance with these views he reached Halifax May, 1774, thence came to Cumberland. Here he saw those who had emigrated from New England residing at Amherst, where he purchased an estate, a part of which are the farms now owned by Mr. George Black, his sons, and Mr. Rupert Black. William Black returned to England in the autumn of 1774 and in the following April chartered a vessel in which he brought his family, consisting of his wife, four sons, and a daughter. He also brought a nurse girl who married a son of one of the emigrants. He also brought some stock of improved breeds. He was detained at Halifax two weeks when he again embarked for Cumberland. Mrs. Black received some injuries in getting on board the vessel at Hull which are supposed to have hastened her death, which took place about a year after her arrival in America. She was highly esteemed as possessed of an elevated mind and many christian virtues. Their eldest son, John, was sixteen years old when they arrived at their new home in America.\n\nAt this time the population of Halifax was estimated at 3,000 inhabitants, and that of the province at 12,000. This was about 25 years after the first settlement of Halifax.\n\nThe several families who came from Yorkshire bore the following names;–Dixon, Wells, Trueman, Weldon, Bowser, Chapman, Freeze, Ripley, Shipley, Fawcett, Keillor, Trenholm, Read, Donkin, Oxley, Smith, Atkinson, Dobson, Pipes, Anderson, Harrison, Johnson, Robinson, Lusby, Foster, and others, whose numerous descendants are spread over the land to which their fathers emigrated.\n\nMost of these families are too well known to require any eulogy from the writer; suffice it to say they have become household names through the country, and are generally esteemed for their sobriety, industry, and religious principles. Let it be remembered that those who now, in the year 1882, are accounted old men, are the grand-children of those emigrants from Yorkshire.\n\nCharles Dixon purchased over two thousand acres of land in Sackville, where he settled, on which some of his posterity now reside. William Wells and William Trueman settled at Point de Bute, then called Prospect, Ripley and Shipley at Nappan, Thomas Bowser and John and William Fawcett at Sackville, New Brunswick. William Freeze purchased what is now known as the Keillor property at Amherst, also, a large area of land on the southwest of the same and now owned by several parties. At that time the marsh produced broadleaf and other wild grasses, except one small stack of English, and Mr. Freeze, and most others thought it was destined to remain the same. He, therefore, sold and removed to Upper Sussex, now Penobsquis, New Brunswick, purchased a large block of land on the river, with low lands adapted to produce a large quantity of English hay. His posterity have filled, and some of them now fill responsible situations in Kings County. William Donkin lived several years at Westmorland, near Fort Cumberland, and removed thence to River Philip. George Oxley settled at Amherst, but subsequently removed to Wallace. John Weldon first settled at Hillsboro, N.B., and removed to Dorchester in 1780. Mr. Read first settled at River Hebert, and subsequently moved to Nappan. Thomas Lusby and Thomas Robinson jointly bought lands lying in Amherst between Laplanche street and the mill brook, including the brook. Mr. Lusby built a mill on the brook. Some of the descendants now live on the property. The Robinson portion is all out of the name.\n\nThe most of these people were of the Methodist denomination. In their accustomed zeal special meetings were held at Amherst in 1779, when Mr. Black, his wife, four sons and daughter all professed to have entertained a hope in the merits of the Saviour and united with the Methodist Church. Thomas S., the youngest son, some years after, became a Baptist, as will be noticed in chapter 5, William became a faithful and very successful Methodist Minister, and John also became a local preacher. Most particular notice will be taken of the descendants of these persons, beginning with the eldest.\n\nThe names of the children of William and Elizabeth Black, who came with their parents from England, are John, William, Richard, Thomas Stocks, and Sarah. Mr. Black married a second wife, Elizabeth Abber, by whom he had seven children, namely: Elizabeth, Mary, Nancy, Jane, James, Alexander, Joseph A., and George Mason. After his second marriage he purchased a large estate in Dorchester, New Brunswick, where he lived the latter part of his life with his son Joseph, and where he died in the year 1820 at the advanced age of 93 years. Some of his grand-children now live on portions of this same farm, other portions of it having been sold and gone out of the name.\n\nMr. Black held the Commission of Justice of the Peace for Cumberland, and in 1779 was appointed Judge of the Common Pleas. To him, Edward Barron, and Charles Baker, were the Court House grounds, at Amherst, deeded, in trust for the County of Cumberland, by Mr. William Freeman, in the year 1788, those three men being then prominent Justices of the County.\n\nWilliam Black, Esquire, survived his second wife several years. He, at the age of 88 years, rode on horseback from Dorchester to Amherst, then thirty miles to visit his sons residing there. He was a remarkably well proportioned man, and retained an erect and dignified bearing to old age.\n\nBoth secular and religious interests suffered severely in Cumberland in consequence of the Revolutionary War which had broken out, some of the New England settlers sympathizing with their friends that revolted. In 1776, by the influence of disaffected persons in the country, the garrison at Fort Cumberland was besieged by a force from Machias. They disarmed those who were friendly to the Government, and forbade them to stir off their farms under penalty of imprisonment or death. The number of men in the garrison being small they did not attempt to come out to relieve the country until they were reinforced by the arrival of a frigate from Halifax. In the night the flashes and reports of the cannon and musketry at the fort were watched and heard by Mr. Black’s family at Amherst, only a few miles distant.\n\nVarious and numerous were the difficulties these English emigrants encountered in this their new country, in which Mr. Black shared, to perhaps a more limited extent than many others. Both the men and the women were robust and vigorous, and remarkably adapted to the settlement of a new country. Here we will leave them and notice their posterity.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nJohn Black, as before noticed, was the eldest son of William Black. He married Barbara Donkin, and settled at River Philip. He was a Methodist local preacher, and was always ready to every good work. He secured the assistance of others, and was principal himself, in procuring a grave-yard and a site on which a church was built, mainly by means furnished directly by himself. In this church he used to preach to the inhabitants on Sundays, and industriously worked on his farm during the week. He succeeded in clearing up a large area of intervale and upland, which became, in time, a very valuable farm. He was a Justice of the Peace for Cumberland.\n\nJohn Black had six sons and five daughters, whose names were Elizabeth Stocks, James, Joseph, William Donkin, Nancy, Margaret, Matilda, John, Mary, Amos, and Horatio Nelson.\n\nELIZABETH STOCKS, the eldest daughter of John Black, was married to Joseph Oxley. They settled on the River Philip. Mr. Oxley was a Justice of the Peace, and was several times elected a member for Cumberland of the Nova Scotia Assembly. He was a man of few words, yet he discharged his public duties with credit to himself and honor to the public.\n\nTheir children consisted of five sons and four daughters. Two sons and three daughters died when young. Those remaining were Cuthbert Collingwood, George Provost, Mary, and James Black. Mrs. Oxley died in the year 1866, aged 79 years. Her husband, Joseph Oxley, died in 1868, aged 90 yearS.\n\nCuthbert Collingwood, eldest son of Joseph Oxley, married Olevia Schurman, of River Philip, in which place they were comfortably settled. Mr. O. died in 1859, aged 61 years, leaving a wife and one son, named Leander. Mrs. Oxley and son now live at Oxford.\n\nGeorge Provost Oxley was named for the Lieut.-Governor of Nova Scotia. He for several years was engaged in shipbuilding at Pugwash and removed thence to Halifax, where he opened a store and was for several years engaged in mercantile pursuits, after which he moved to Liverpool, England, and was engaged there in a shipping office. His wife, Eliza Ann, died in 1857, aged 43 years, leaving one son and one daughter named Martin Gay Black and Mary Elizabeth. He, George P. Oxley, returned to Pugwash, bringing his daughter with him. He died in 1875, aged 65 years.\n\nHis son remained in Liverpool, England, where he is the principal physician in a hospital. He married Emmie Lloyd and has one son named George Provost.\n\nMary Elizabeth, the only daughter of George P. Oxley, was married to Rev. Alexander S. Tuttle, a Methodist minister. They have three children named George R. Martin, and Emmie Lloyd.\n\nJames Black Oxley, the youngest son of Joseph Oxley, entered into business as a merchant in Halifax where he conducted a large and prosperous trade for many years. He died in 1876 aged 58 years. His wife’s maiden name was Helen Macdonald, of Halifax. Their children’s names are Frederick Henry, James McDonald, Rufus Black, Harold, and Affie Morrison. Five others died when young.\n\nFrederick Henry married Elizabeth Wilmot Black, daughter of Samuel G. Black of Windsor.\n\nJames Macdonald Oxley married Mary, daughter of J. B. Morrow, who possessed abundant means and was always ready to do good. Mr. Oxley is a lawyer.\n\nRufus B. Oxley married Maria Keith, of St. John, N.B. The above three live in Halifax.\n\nMary, the only surviving daughter of Joseph Oxley, was married to Cyrus Bent of Pugwash, where they settled and still live. Mr. Bent is engaged in trade. He is a Justice of the Peace and much respected. They have one son and three daughters, named Edgar, Matilda C., Bessie, and Lillie.\n\nEdgar, the only son of Cyrus Bent, is Post Office Inspector. He married Emma McNutt. They have five children named Maude, Fred, Annie, Charles and Greta.\n\nMatilda C., the eldest daughter of Cyrus Bent, was married to John Cooper. Mr. Cooper died in 1881, leaving a widow and four children. Their children’s names are Edgar, Carl, Mary, and William, and reside at Spring Hill, where Mr. Cooper had lived for several years previous to his death.\n\nBessie, another daughter of Cyrus Bent, was married to Rev. Robert A. Daniel, a Methodist minister. They have four children named Lillian, Mary, Jane, and Henry.\n\nJAMES BLACK was the eldest son of John Black. When young men, he and his brother William D. engaged in mercantile pursuits in Halifax. Several years after this William D. left the business with his brother and opened a store in Amherst and James continued the business in Halifax for many years.\n\nWhen somewhat advanced in life he removed to Pugwash where he owned very valuable real estate in the business portion of the village. He married Sarah Hare of Halifax. He died in 1875, aged 76 years, leaving a wife and two children.\n\nMary Ann, one of the daughters, was married to John W. Webb, son of Rev. William Webb. Mrs. Webb died, leaving two children. One of them, a son, died when young. The daughter’s name is Annie. Mr. Webb married his second wife, Rebecca Black, daughter of George M. Black, of Dorchester, by whom he had eight children. They live in Windsor. For further particulars see chapter 13. The other daughter of James Black was never married.\n\nJOSEPH, second son of John Black, settled at Pugwash. At the age of 51 years he received injuries from a threshing machine, from the effects of which he died in the year 1849. His wife’s name was Sarah Pineo, a sister of the late Hon. H. G. Pineo. He left three sons and four daughters. Their names are Rufus F., Henry, Martin, Caroline, Adelaide, Anna, and Loniza.\n\nRufus F., the eldest son of Joseph Black, married Harriet Parker, daughter of Rev. Maynard Parker, of Pugwash. They have eight children, named Amos, Rufus, Joseph, Peter, Cyrus, Annie, Mary, and Hattie; another died when young.\n\nAmos married Mary Augusta Freeman, daughter of Daniel Freeman, of Amherst. They lived in Boston, where Mrs. Black died in 1881, aged 30 years.\n\nCyrus, son of Rufus F. Black, lives in the United States, where he married a Miss Bing.\n\nMary, daughter of Rufus F. Black, was married to a man by the name McCollum. They had two children. Mrs. McCollum died in 1881.\n\nCaroline, daughter of Joseph Black, was married to Allan Dewar, of Pugwash. They had one child, who died while young.\n\nAdelaide, daughter of Joseph Black, was married to Thomas Webster. They have three sons and one daughter, named Joseph, Telyson, Leonard, and Florence. Annie, daughter of Joseph Black, is married in the United StateS.\n\nWILLIAM DONKIN BLACK, third son of John Black, when a young man, opened a store, in company with his brother James, at Halifax. After a few years he left this store with James, and opened one at Amherst. He also built the first part of what is now the Cumberland Hotel. His dwelling was a neat and commodious two-story house, equal, perhaps superior, to any dwelling-house in Amherst at that time.\n\nSlightly digressing, it may be noticed that in the same year in which this house was built by W. D. Black, seven other young bachelors built comfortable dwelling houses at Amherst. The brick house now occupied by the Bank of Nova Scotia was built by Dr. Carritte, father of our esteemed townsman, Dr. T. W. Carritte. The first part of what is now Lamy’s Hotel was built by Rufus Freeman. W. F. Black built on the farm now occupied by T. Ansley Black. Samuel Holsted built the house now occupied by John A. Embree. William B. Embree built a house in what is now called Warren. Samuel Gourley built the house now occupied by A. S. Blenkhorn, Esq., and William Dickey built a portion of the house now occupied by Sheriff McLean. These were built about the year 1823 and were at that time quite a noteworthy acquisition to a small settlement like Amherst.\n\nThe same William Donkin Black married Olevia Freeman, daughter of William Freeman, of Amherst. They resided at Amherst several years, when Mr. Black purchased a farm at River Philip, whence he removed and where he resided until called away by death in 1846, aged 52 years.\n\nSome years after, his widow was married to Joseph Avard, Esq., of Bristol, Westmorland, New Brunswick. Mr. Avard died some years after this, and Mrs. Avard died in 1881, aged 81 yearS.\n\nThe names of the children of the above William D. Black are Rufus Freeman, Horatio Nelson, Alexander Augustus, Hibbert Crane, Matilda, Josephine, Mary, and Eliza.\n\nRufus Freeman Black is a Justice of the Peace and has a store at River Philip. He has also an interest in a store at Truro, where he now lives. He married Amelia Trueman, daughter of the late Harmon Trueman, Esq., of Point de Bute, Westmorland. Their family consisted of four daughters and one son, named Ida, Louisa, Albert, Emeline, and Mary. Louisa died in 1882.\n\nHoratio Nelson, another son of William D. Black, married in New Orleans, and had a small family. He died, leaving two children, named Matilda and William.\n\nAlexander A., the third son of William D. Black, married Emeline Pineo, daughter of Hon. H. G. Pineo. He died in 1868, aged 40 years, leaving a widow and three sons–Ernest, Arthur, and Alexander. He was a Justice of the Peace. His widow was subsequently married to Alexander Wilson.\n\nHibbert Crane, youngest son of William D. Black, married Margaret McLeod, daughter of Rev. A. McLeod, D.D., a Methodist minister, who was for some years editor of the “Provincial Wesleyan” newspaper, but who is now residing in the United States. Dr. McLeod was for many years a travelling minister in the lower provinces. Hibbert C. Black had five children. Two daughters died when young. The names of the survivors are Walter, Charles, and William. They reside at Pugwash, where Mr. Black carries on an extensive lumbering and general business.\n\nMatilda, the eldest daughter of W. D. Black, was married to Thomas Thompson, of Oxford, Nova Scotia. Mr. Thompson was a Justice of the Peace. He died in 1881. They had two sons and four daughters, whose names are Stanley, Edith, Mary, Eliza, Arthur, and Margaret.\n\nJosephine was married to Henry Cochrane, of Newport, where they reside. They have one son and one daughter, named Ernest and Bessie. Henry Cochran and his father are merchants and keep the post office.\n\nMary was married to Charles Avard, son of her mother’s second husband. They reside at Bristol, N.B., and have two small children, a son and a daughter, named Francis Ivey and Josephine.\n\nEliza, the youngest daughter of W. D. Black, was married to George Hewson. They reside at Oxford and have four children whose names are Harvey, Edgar, Louise, and Maria Olivia. Mr. Hewson is one of the wealthiest men of his age in Cumberland County.\n\nNANCY, second daughter of John Black (the eldest son of William Black), was married to Robert Colon Read. They settled at Pugwash. They had three sons and four daughters, named Mary Jane, who died at the age of 18 years, James Black, John, Stephen, Sarah, Margaret, and Leanora. Mr. Read was a Justice of the Peace.\n\nMr. Read was very ingenious in wood-work. He possessed a remarkably retentive memory. At one time he made a tour in the United States and Texas, and it was exceedingly interesting to hear his graphic description of his travels. He sometimes entered into particulars respecting the towns he passed through, the number and quality of the hotels in each, their cost, the number of rooms, etc. These statements were made with such precision that one could scarcely avoid envying him of his memory.\n\nWhen viewing the Table Lands in Texas he imagined it to be the most desirable place under heaven in which to live, and some years after succeeded in persuading his wife, his son Stephen and wife, and his youngest daughter to remove thither, and accordingly took them and went in the second search of that happy land. He, however, searched in vain. Places that he now visited presented to him a different appearance from that of the previous visit. In the few years that had elapsed since his first visit new settlers had come in, the lands being occupied by mixed races of people among whom Mr. Read and his family thought it far from desirable to locate, and apart from this he found it difficult to discern the place which he had so highly valued on his former visit. The result was, that, through the entreaty of his wife and family, he left those previously admired Table Lands, returned to Pugwash and settled himself comfortably upon a farm, having the satisfaction of knowing that not he alone but his wife and family had seen much to remember. After this last visit Mr. Read’s references to the Table Lands of Texas were not in the glowing terms of former days.\n\nRobert Colon Read died in 1875, aged 81 years.\n\nJames B., eldest son of R. C. Read, married Mary DeWolfe, of Pugwash. He died a few years ago. Their family consists of five children, named Caroline, Clarence, Hibbert, Annie, and Alice. Caroline was married to James Albert Brown, who is a prosperous farmer living at Pugwash. Their children’s names are Stanley Read, Joseph Rupert, and Minnie DeWolfe. The latter two are twins. Annie was married to Thomas A. Moore. They live in Halifax and have two children named Louisa DeWolfe and William McCallum.\n\nJohn, second son of R. C. Read, married Charlotte Hewson. They have one son and two daughters, named Joseph, Bessie, and Abey.\n\nStephen married a Miss Crowe, of Boston. They have one son, and live in Montana, U. S.\n\nSarah, daughter of R. C. Read, was married to Jesse, son of Joseph Black, of P.E. Island. The family own and reside on the farm in Pugwash that R. C. Read purchased on his return from Texas. They had three sons, named Albert, Edgar, and Rufus. Jesse Black died in 1881, aged 58 years.\n\nMargaret was married to William DeWolfe, of Pugwash. Mr. DeWolfe died in 1870. Their family consisted of two sons and one daughter, named Barton, Minnie, and Allison. Minnie died while a youth.\n\nLeanora, the youngest daughter of R. C. Read, was married to a Mr. Bateman, of Boston, who died in 1875, leaving one son.\n\nMARGARET, the third daughter of John Black (son of William), was somewhat advanced in life when she was married to a Doctor Patterson. After a few years of married life she died, aged 55 years, leaving no offspring.\n\nMATILDA, fourth daughter of John Black, was married to Rev. Robert H. Crane, a Methodist minister. Mr. Crane was highly esteemed both for his piety and zeal. He was stationed on several circuits in Nova Scotia and was finally appointed on circuits in Jamaica and St. Vincent. He died in St. Vincent in the year 1839, aged 45 years, leaving his widow a stranger in a strange land. She had, by universal reputation, been a helpmeet for a minister of the Gospel. Her sound mind and penetrating judgment were brought to the test in removing with her children to her native home; yet she vigorously surmounted the difficulties, and took up her abode at Halifax, where she remained several years, after which she purchased a residence at Pugwash, where she resided until removed by death in 1879, aged 79 years.\n\nMrs. Crane had three sons and four daughters, three of whom died when young. The names of the others are, Miriam Matilda, Rebecca Fisher, Mary Anna, and James Hibbert.\n\nMiriam Matilda was married to Rev. William C. McKinnon, a Methodist minister of good ability. Mrs. McKinnon died in 1862, aged 33 years. She left two sons, named William Charles and John Robert. One of these died in 1876, from injuries received when coasting, while attending school at Sackville Academy. The other is with his grand-uncle, Amos Black, Esq., Horton.\n\nRebecca F., daughter of Rev. R. H. Crane, was never married. She died in 1851.\n\nMary Anna was married to Capt. George Eaton, of Pugwash, son of Levi Eaton, Esq. A few years after their marriage a company of persons embarked at Pugwash for Aukland, New Zealand. They consisted, in part, of Levi Eaton and his family, George Eaton and his wife, Rev. William Hobbs (a Baptist minister), and his wife, with others. Capt. Eaton, a few years after his arrival at Aukland, was lost at sea and his widow soon after removed to her mother’s at Pugwash. They had a son, named Robert Crane, and a daughter who died when young.\n\nMrs. Eaton was subsequently married to Augustus, son of George Carter, of Pugwash, where they reside. They have one son and a daughter, named John W. and Nettie.\n\nJames Hibbert, only son of Rev. Robert H. and Matilda Crane, died in 1853, aged 25 years.\n\nJOHN, the fourth son of John Black, died in 1824, aged 31 years. He was never married.\n\nMARY, youngest daughter of John Black, was married to John Schurman. They lived at River Philip, where Mr. Schurman had previously settled. They had five sons and two daughters, whose names are John William, Sarah, Alexander, Amos Black, Matilda, Cuthbert Colby, and Samuel. Mrs. Schurman died at Oxford in 1877, aged 73 years. She had been a widow for several years.\n\nJohn W., her son, married Olivia Donkin, of River Philip, where they reside. They have three sons and four daughters, named Frank, May, Alice, Eliza, George, Maggie Harrison, and Robert Donkin.\n\nAlexander married Fannie Bulmer, daughter of Frederick Bulmer. They live at Truro; have four young children, named Richard Upham, Frederick, Alexander Morton, and Mary.\n\nSarah, daughter of John and Mary Schurman, was married to William Henry Donkin. They live at River Philip. They have three daughters and one son, named Annie, Walter, Maggie, and Effie.\n\nAmos B. Schurman was never married.\n\nCuthbert Colby married Sarah Davison. They reside at Spring Hill, and have two children, named Rupert and Mary.\n\nSamuel, the youngest son of the first named (John and Mary Schurman) married a Miss Shaw. They have seven children.\n\nAMOS, the fifth son of John Black, married Charlotte Lusby, daughter of Luther Lusby, Esq., of Amherst. He lived on the homestead at River Philip for many years. Afterwards, he sold the farm, and removed to Grand Pre, Horton, having purchased a farm there, where he now lives. They have no children. Amos Black was, when in Cumberland, a Justice of the Peace, and in King’s County he also received that commission.\n\nHORATIO NELSON, the youngest son of John Black, when young, went as a clerk in a store at Halifax, where his health failed and he died in the year 1829, aged 19 years. He was possessed of natural ability of a superior order.\n\nRufus F. Black, of Truro, is prospering in his business there, principally in flour, West India produce, and groceries. He has closed his store at River Philip, where his principal business in that place is collecting accounts.\n\nThus is brought to a close the sketch of the descendants of John, son of William Black, who, at the age of 71 years, came from his home in River Philip to Amherst on business, where he became ill and died in the year 1830.\n\nPosterity of John Black, 1st.\n\nLiving Dead Total\n\nChildren, 2 9 11\n\nGrand Children, 28 19 47\n\nGreat Grand Children, 96 14 110\n\nGreat Great G.

In the memoirs of Rev. William Black, written by Rev. Dr. Ritchie, the following incident is related:–\n\nMr. Stocks, accustomed, it appears, to spend many of his leisure hours in angling, brought home one day a live trout, and, for the amusement of his juvenile nephew, threw it into a trough of water that stood in the yard. William, after witnessing for some time, with no small degree of satisfaction, the gambols of his finny captive, stooped down, incautiously, to take a drink at the mouth of the spout by which the water was conveyed, and fell headlong into the trough. The position in which he fell precluded the possibility of using an effort to extricate himself from his condition of imminent peril. In a very short time he must inevitably have been drowned had not a female domestic, happening to come to the door just in time to rescue him from the arms of death, seen his feet above the water and ran to his relief. His appearance, when taken out of the water was ominous; for some time he lay motionless and insensible, and serious apprehensions were entertained by his afflicted friends that the vital spark was extinct. To their inexpressible joy, however, their fears were soon dissipated.\n\nHis pious and excellent mother watched over him with the tenderness of a mother’s love. While his father was on his first visit to America his mother frequently took him aside to talk and pray with him, explaining to him how, at the age of sixteen, she was convicted of sin and experienced forgiveness.\n\nIn the early part of the year 1779 a revival of religion took place at Amherst. Social religious meetings were held frequently, and encouraging results followed. The family of Mr. Black shared in the benefits resulting from this work, for William and the rest of the family began a different life from that previously pursued. In his experience William mentions several of those worthy old Englishmen who were a benefit to him in his distress of mind on account of sin. He mentions William Wells, William Freeze, Thomas Scurr, and others, likewise Mrs. Oxley and Mrs. Donkin.\n\nShortly after this the mind of William Black became particularly impressed with a desire to be useful to his fellowmen by preaching the Glad Tidings to them. He, however, remained at Amherst with his father until he had attained to his majority, which was in the autumn of 1781. William Black left his father’s home in Amherst on the 10th November, 1781, under the guidance of his Heavenly Father, directing his steps to the Petitcodiac River. He preached in various places, and returned in eighteen days, having preached twenty-four times, feeling sure that his labor had been abundantly blessed. He had received a good common education, enabling him to deliver his message with freedom and force.\n\nAbout this time a “Newlight” preacher–Henry Alline–attracted a large share of attention. The force of the religious influence which he exerted has never been erased, but can still be clearly traced in many parts of the Lower Provinces. This man, who resided in Falmouth, had, for several years, been living a miserable existence for fear of death, under the terrors of the law. At the age of twenty-seven light of the Glad Tidings broke into his previously dark mind, and he obtained strong faith in the merits of Christ as his Saviour. Comparing this with the depression he previously experienced, “Oh! the astonishing wonders of His grace,” he exclaimed, “and the ocean of redeeming love. Millions and millions of praise to His name! and oh! the unspeakable wisdom and beauty of the glorious plan of life and salvation.” Mr. Alline visited Amherst and many places in the Lower Towns, then so called. He attracted large congregations, and the usual result of his preaching was a revival of religion. In 1783 he went to New Hampshire, where he died the next year, at the early age of 36 years, and his works follow him.\n\nAs previously noticed, William Black about this time had begun his itinerant work, for which he possessed special qualifications. He was soon the honored means of gathering a large number into the Methodist society at Amherst and other places at the head of the Bay of Fundy. In 1782 Henry Alline made a second visit to these places. The result was that many united with him, among whom were seventy that belonged to Mr. Black’s church.* The slight clashing which occurred between these good men in consequence of a difference of opinion on the doctrines of the Bible, was regretted by many mutual friends.\n\n[As stated in “Memoir of Rev. W. Black.”]\n\nRev. William Black was very highly esteemed by the people generally, and particularly by the body of christians to which he belonged–so much so that he went by the title of Bishop Black and the Father of Methodism in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. He was allowed the privilege of residing in Halifax for many of the last years of his life, the Conference kindly acceding to his desire in the matter. His ministry was exceedingly successful, as may be learned by his memoir.\n\nThough this venerable servant of the Lord is dead he yet speaketh. On the 10th November, 1881, just one hundred years had passed since he left his father’s home in Amherst, shouldered his knapsack and proclaimed salvation in the name of Jesus to the inhabitants of Sackville and many other places on the Memramcook and Petitcodiac Rivers, when he had no Conference to support him. He went forth at heaven’s call, by which he was guided as he walked the footpaths through the wilderness and forded the streams or crossed them on a single log, sometimes finding the flesh weak while the spirit was willing. We will not pause to picture the dangers and difficulties he encountered through the opposition of men who ought to have welcomed the Glad Tidings and the messenger who bore them.\n\nHe may be correctly styled the pioneer itinerant of Methodism in the three Lower Provinces, now embraced in the vast Canadian Dominion. The subsequent growth of the Methodist churches in these Lower Provinces has been such that they now show a membership of about seventeen thousand and a proportionately large number of adherentS. Rev. William Black was social in his manner and judicious in his measures. His labors were widely diffused and in scarcely any instance without apparent results in which all good men will rejoice.\n\nMr. Black preached for seven and a half years before he was ordained. Mr. Wesley did not ordain any until about seven years before his death. The first to whom he administered the rite were Thomas Coke (whom he sent out to superintend the work in America) and two others, in 1784. Previously to this, Mr. Wesley’s ordinations were by the national church. In the year 1787 Mr. Wesley ordained James Wray, and sent him out to superintend the cause in Nova Scotia. In 1789 Mr. Black, with John and James Mann, attended a Conference in Philadelphia, where they were ordained by Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury. It was thought by some of the ministers that Wray sought with English determination to enforce certain rules in a thinly settled country which could not in all cases be carried out, and some differences had arisen. Harmony was soon restored, however, and Wray wrote to Dr. Coke to relieve him of the responsibility of Superintendent by appointing another. Mr. Black was immediately appointed Superintendent of the work in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland. He accepted the charge, but not without hesitancy.\n\nThe first Methodist Meeting House opened in Sackville, N.B., was by James Mann in the year 1790.\n\nMr. Wesley died in the year 1791.\n\nThe Rev. William Black married Mary Gay, daughter of Martin Gay of Westmorland. His children consisted of three sons and two daughters, named Celia, Martin Gay, William Anderson, Samuel, and Mary.\n\nMrs. Black died in 1827, aged 73 years. Mr. Black, in 1828, married, as his second wife, Mrs. Calkin, widow of Elisha Calkin, of Liverpool, N.S. He lived to the age of 74 years and died in the year 1834.\n\nHis widow returned to Liverpool, where she had ten children by her first husband, and where she resided till her death. She was highly esteemed for her many excellencies and christian virtues.\n\nCELIA, the eldest child of Rev. William Black, was married to James Hamilton, a wealthy merchant, of Halifax. Mrs. Hamilton died in 1861, aged 76 years. Mr. Hamilton died in 1856, aged 77 years. They had a numerous family, several of whom died in infancy. The survivors were William, James Martin, Ebenezer Gay, John Barry, Mary Ann, and George Alfred.\n\nWilliam married a lady from the United States; she had no children.\n\nJames Martin married Elizabeth Mary Gill, of Newfoundland. He died in 1865, aged 55 years. His wife died in Brooklyn, in 1858, aged 52 years. They left one daughter.\n\nEbenezer Gay, another son died in New Jersey in 1881, aged 65 years.\n\nJohn Barry, another son, died in Cadiz, Spain, in 1852, aged 28 years, leaving one daughter. His wife’s name was Bohannan.\n\nMary Ann, daughter of James Hamilton, died in 1862, aged 44 years. She was never married.\n\nGeorge Alfred, the youngest son, resided in Providence, R.I., where he died in the year 1872, aged 47 years.\n\nOf this large and wealthy family but few representatives reside in Halifax or in any part of Canada.\n\nMARTIN GAY BLACK, the eldest son of Rev. William Black, married Fannie Smith, daughter of Doctor Rufus Smith, of Westmorland, N.B. They had six sons and seven daughters, named Eliza, Rufus Smith, Alexander Anderson, Fannie, Celia, Matilda, Martin Gay, Amelia, Louise, William, Samuel H., Sophia, and Charles. Charles died when quite young.\n\nMartin Gay Black was universally acknowledged to possess sterling principles, was a warm supporter of the Methodist church, always ready to support the missionary cause and other benevolent institutions. He was for many years one of the foremost merchants in Halifax, firm in his principles, and was generally esteemed by his acquaintances.\n\nOn one occasion a respectable gentleman living in Cornwallis purchased from Mr. M. G. Black a stock of goods, and, on his return to Cornwallis, found with regret that his buildings had, in his absence from home, been consumed, leaving him in a condition not able to meet his engagement. He, therefore, proposed to return the goods. Mr. Black generously replied that he needed the value of the goods more than before, and authorized him to sell them and pay him when he found it convenient to do so.\n\nHis mode of trading is shown by the following:–On one occasion a woman in his store bought some small articles. The price asked by Mr. B. for one article did not please her. She made use of her persuasive powers, that women alone possess, when finally, after long resistance, he yielded to her entreaties to sell a shade lower. When this woman went to the door to go away Mr. B. asked if there was not something wrong in the dealings? She said, No. Mr. B. then said that she had persuaded him to reduce his price on a certain article, which was contrary to his custom, but he had laid the amount on other articles that she purchased, and, said he, I now hand you the extra charge, but never try to beat me down again. This, though a small matter, serves to show the systematic manner in which he conducted his affairs.\n\nMrs. Black died in 1859, aged 68 years, and Martin Gay Black in 1861, aged 74 years.\n\nRufus Smith, the eldest son of Martin Gay Black, is a medical doctor and stands high in his profession in Halifax, where he resides. He married Theresa Ferguson, only child of John Ferguson, Esq., of Halifax. They had a family of two sons and six daughters. One of the sons died in infancy. The names of the others are Fanny Theresa, Mary Elizabeth, Jane Millar, John Ferguson, Louisa Pinkney, Laura Matilda, and Edith Sophia.\n\nJane M., daughter of the above Dr. Rufus S. Black, was married to Rev. Jabez A. Rogers, who is a prominent Methodist Minister. They had six children, named Charles Melville, William Arthur, Gertrude Evelyn, Eleanor Theresa, Alfred Seymour, and Bertha. The eldest two died while young, in 1880, at Amherst, where Mr. Rogers was then stationed.\n\nJohn Ferguson Black, son of the above Dr. R. F. Black is a medical doctor.\n\nAlexander Anderson, the second son of Martin Gay Black, married Mary Ann Leishman. They had two sons, each of whom died at the age of 8 years. Mr. A. A. Black also died in 1855, aged 42 years.\n\nEliza and Louise, daughters of Martin Gay Black, were never married.\n\nMatilda, daughter of M. G. Black, was married to Rev. Charles DeWolfe, a Methodist minister, who was appointed to several important circuits, and was for several years a professor in the Mount Allison institution at Sackville, N.B. He received the title of Doctor of Divinity from Acadia College. Mr. DeWolfe was emphatically a man of peace, was highly esteemed by all classes of christians, and by people generally.\n\nAfter Dr. DeWolfe became supernumerary he and Mrs. DeWolfe lived a few years at Shelburne with their daughter, Mrs. White. They then removed to Windsor, where Mrs. DeWolfe died in 1873, aged about 53 years. The Doctor then removed to Wolfville, his native place, where he died in 1875. They had one son and three daughters. Two died in infancy. The names of those living are Fanny and Louisa. Fanny was married to N. W. White, of Shelburne. He is a lawyer and a member of the Nova Scotia Legislature, is also a member of the Executive Council.\n\nMartin Gay Black, jr., another son of Martin Gay Black, married Mary Mitchell, of Chester. They had five sons and three daughters; one died in infancy, another at the age of 12 years. The names of the remainder are Fannie S., John B., Mamia M., Henry B., Wm.

Black, was married to Lemuel A. Wilmot, who at that time was a prominent lawyer of New Brunswick, and resided in Fredericton. He, for several years, was Attorney-General of that province, and was subsequently elevated to the Supreme Court Bench, and thence to the Lieutenant-Governorship of the province.

She died in Philadelphia, in 1873, aged 83 years.\n\nJonathan C., the eldest son of Samuel Black, while young, went to Sackville, N.B., for the purpose of getting a knowledge of farming. There he married Elizabeth Scurr and was very comfortably settled in a house which he built, scarcely second to any in Sackville. He died in 1857, aged 43 years, leaving a widow who, after several years, was married to James Ayer, of Sackville. Mrs. Ayer died in 1865, aged 51 years.\n\nJonathan C.

Black, is married and has four children, named Ella May, Ida Louise, Rebecca Victoria, and Clarence William. He lives in the State of Pennsylvania.\n\nWilliam, the second son of the above named Samuel Black, was never married. He resided during a portion of his life at St. John, and also lived in the U. States, at Halifax, and at River Philip. He died in Boston, aged 50 years, in the year 1870.\n\nJames N. Crane, the youngest son of Samuel Black (son of Rev. William Black), married Elizabeth Hopson, of Philadelphia. They had three sons and three daughters, named Edwin Crane, Florence Lillie, James Darst, Maggie Hopson, and Carrie Rebecca. Charles, another son, died at the age of 20 years. James N. C. Black was, for many years, a merchant at St. John, N.B., also in Philadelphia, where he now resides.\n\nRebecca Darst, the only daughter of the first named Samuel Black, moved to the United States with her mother, where she died in Philadelphia in the year 1867, aged 46 years.\n\nMARY, the youngest child of Rev. William Black, was married to John Alexander Barry, of Halifax. They lived in that city, where Mr. Barry was engaged in mercantile pursuits for many years.\n\nMr. Barry was once elected a representative of the Nova Scotia Legislature for Shelburne, which then embraced Yarmouth and Shelburne. He was possessed of more than ordinary speaking talents, and made use of these talents fearlessly in the Legislature, to the gratification of many, and, of course, to the annoyance of others. In order to carry his points he was, at times, regardless of consequences. In the year 1832, when debating in the legislative chamber, he disregarded a call to order, and refusing to apologise, was imprisoned, but was shortly after released without the apology.\n\nTheir family consisted of a son and four daughters, named Celia, Anna, Elizabeth, Housial, and another, who, with her brother, went to Liverpool, England. Housial was there for a few years in the employ of J. S. DeWolfe, after which he became a member of the firm.\n\nMrs. Barry, after a protracted illness, died in the year 1833.\n\nMr. Barry was a dealer, to some extent in glass and chinaware, and made purchases of these from a gentleman in New York whose daughter he became acquainted with and married. But there were conditions in the marriage contract by which they were to live alternately one year in Nova Scotia and one in New York. They lived one year in Nova Scotia and a son was born, then a year in New York, and Mrs. Barry refused to return to Nova Scotia. A daughter was born. There was much dissatisfaction on account of Mrs. Barry refusing to carry out the marriage contract, and a separation was about to be formed when a difficulty arose about which should have the children. Mrs. Barry refused to give them up to their father, and he brought a law-suit in the State of New York, to obtain them, and succeeded; but before he could get charge of them, Mrs. Barry had escaped with the children to another State that was not governed by New York laws. Mr. Barry then brought suit in the United States Court, which he conducted in person and gained. Then a compromise was made under which he was to have the son and she the daughter. After this he lived at Liverpool, N.S.\n\nIn the year 1782, when the American colonies were recognized by the British Parliament as independent states, the many who had refused to take up arms against Britain were required to seek homes elsewhere, and before winter thousands of families took ship to seek them in the wilderness of Nova Scotia, which included New Brunswick until 1784, when they were constituted separate provinces.\n\nSeveral of these loyalists removed to Shelburne, among whom was Robert Barry, the father of John A. Barry, who was highly esteemed, particularly by the Methodists. A large number of the loyalists went to Parrtown–now St. John–and in the autumn of 1783 over five hundred framed houses were erected there.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to get a correct list of the posterity of Rev. William Black, a large number having removed to England and the United States of America.\n\nWe give what is probably below the number of great grand-children and great, great g.children:\n\nPosterity of Rev.

He was born in England in the year 1762, and was 13 years old when he arrived with his father at Amherst, Cumberland. He first settled at River Philip where he bought 500 acres of land from Rodger Robinson. There he remained several years, and moved thence to Amherst, and settled on the farm his father bought on his first visit to Cumberland in 1774. Here he lived the remainder of his life. While at River Philip two of his children died when young. His youngest son and some of his grandsons now live on the old Amherst farm.\n\nAbout the year 1804 arrangements were made by Richard Black, Thomas S. Black, and Samuel Holsted, by which a large block of land was purchased at Amherst. The conveyance was to Richard Black, who sold to his brother, Thomas S., 540 acres for 180 pounds, and to Samuel Holstead 750 acres for 190 pounds, each choosing his lot.\n\nRichard Black was one of the strong supporters of the Methodist denomination, to which he belonged, and, when its number in Amherst was small, he was always found ready with means to support the cause as far as his duty dictated. The partial loss of his hearing in the latter part of his life operated very materially against his comfort. As long as health permitted, however, he attended religious meetings, and, in order to hear, invariably took his seat at the desk or in the pulpit, beside the minister, of whatever denomination of christians he was.\n\nHe married Sally Chapman, who was also from Yorkshire. Their family consisted of eleven children*, named William, Thomas, Maria, Joseph, Sarah, Richard Asher, John Chapman, Ann, George, and Mary. Two others died when young. The family were of particularly large physique and very muscular. The writer once heard one of them say he was the smallest of seven brothers and weighed 185 pounds and was six feet in height.\n\n[*Ed. Note: The way it is above is exactly as it is in the original. Numbers 11 and 12 may be the “two others” who died when young.]\n\nMrs. Black died in 1820, aged 53 years. Richard Black married again Elizabeth Smith of Parrsboro. He died in the year 1834 aged 72 years. His second wife had no children, and died in 1861, aged 84 years.\n\nWILLIAM, the eldest son of the above Richard Black, married Mary Bent of Amherst, daughter of John Bent.
