[1]\n\nTupper studied at Horton Academy (now Acadia University) before obtaining a medical degree at the University of Edinburgh in 1843. He established a medical practice at Amherst, Nova Scotia, and later at Halifax in 1859, also serving at the city and provincial hospitals. He was president of the Medical Society of Nova Scotia in 1863 and was the first president of the Canadian Medical Association from 1867 to 1870.\n\nHe was married to Frances Amelia Morse on October 8, 1846. The October 24, 1846 edition of the New Brunswick Courier reported: \"m. Amherst, N.S., Thursday, 8th inst., by Rev. George Townsend, Charles Tupper, Esq., M.D. / Frances Amelia Morse eldest d/o Silas H. Morse, Esq. Deputy Prothonotary Cumberland Co.\"\n\nThey had three sons and three daughters: Orin Stewart, Charles Hibbert, William Johnston, Emma, Elizabeth Stewart (\"Lilly\"), and Sophy Almon.\n\nTupper Family, 1896\n\nIn 1855 Tupper entered politics and defeated Joseph Howe in Cumberland County. He sat in opposition until 1857 when the Liberals were defeated. He became Provincial Secretary and initiated discussions with other jurisdictions regarding the Intercolonial Railway. The Conservatives were defeated for a short time but returned to power in 1863. The following year, on May 11, 1864, Tupper took over as Premier of Nova Scotia. He was a strong proponent for both Maritime and British North American union. Tupper was the lead delegate at the Charlottetown, Québec and London conferences but was unable to win approval for the Quebec Resolutions in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly.\n\nIn 1867 he entered federal politics and was Nova Scotia's only representative in favour of Confederation.\n\nTupper was successively president of the Privy Council (1870-72), minister of inland revenue (1872-73), and minister of customs (1873). He served as minister of public works (1878-79) and minister of railways and canals (1879-84). He became high commissioner to Britian in 1884, but returned to Ottawa to serve as minister of finance (1887-88).\n\nLapel button, probably for 1896 election\n\nTupper became Prime Minister 1 May 1896. Tupper and his colleagues had introduced remedial legislation to protect the educational rights of the French-speaking minority in Manitoba. Tupper and the Conservatives were badly defeated in the general election in June. He resigned on July 8, having served only ten weeks as prime minister, the shortest tenure in Canadian history. He continued in Parliament as leader of the Opposition but was defeated in the election of 1900. On retirement he lived in Bexleyheath, England.\n\nSir Charles Tupper is buried at St. John's Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Phillip Buckner, “TUPPER, Sir CHARLES,” in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 14, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed February 11, 2019, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/tupper_charles_14E.html.\n\nThe Canadian Encyclopedia online https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-charles-tupper\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada (People- Sir Charles Tupper) http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-4000.80-e.html\n\n1861 census, Ward 3, Halifax, Halifax, Nova Scotia, page 1, line 14, page 2, line 14, page 3, line 14, page 4, line 14,\n\n1871 Census of Canada, Ontario, District: 77, Ottawa city, sub-district C, St. George's Ward, Div. 2; citing Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada: RG1; digital images.
