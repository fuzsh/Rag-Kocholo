Norris graduated from Clay High School and in 1985 from Harvard College, where he majored in social studies.\n\nHe also attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.\n\nNorris's limp is a result of an accident in his early childhood when he was severely injured while playing soccer with his sisters.\n\nWhen the ball rolled into the street, Norris's leg was crushed by an oncoming police car, who was unable to see the young Norris running into the street.
