        "text": "Award-winning Breaking Bad actor Dean Norris told Yahoo Finance’s The Final Round that for a moment, he was tempted by Wall Street over Hollywood.\n\n“I didn’t come from a whole bunch of money, so when I was graduating Harvard, it was easy to get job interviews. I graduated 1985. The crash was 1986. Investment banking was the thing if you came out of Harvard,” explained Norris. “They would fly you down, and you’d stay in a nice hotel, get up and chit-chat a little bit about commodities – then I would put on a t-shirt, go out, and do an audition.”\n\nDoes he regret not entering the Wall Street world?\n\n“No,” said Norris. “I thought about it later, [but] when you’re that age, the chance of becoming a successful actor seemed rather distant. After I got into L.A., I was glad I did what I did.”\n\nIt was a professional decision that certainly has worked to his benefit.\n\nIn Breaking Bad, Norris played DEA agent Hank Schrader, the brother-in-law of schoolteacher turned drug kingpin, Walter White, on the critically-acclaimed television drama, Breaking Bad. The unusual pastime of his character – brewing beer in his garage – is now the impetus behind Norris’ latest venture: Schraderbräu, a recreation of the once-fictional brew.\n\n“Somebody came to me early on, and was talking about possibly doing a beer. I thought, ‘okay,’ and then it didn’t go anywhere,” he explained. “Then I thought, if someone is going to do it, I might as well do it myself, because I’d mainly be the person promoting it. So I went to Sony, struck a deal with them for the licensing, found a great partner...and we timed it because we knew we had some things coming out, a little thing in about a month.”\n\nThat ‘little thing’ is El Camino, a film continuation the show coming to Netflix.\n\n“I couldn’t tell you a single thing about it,” says Norris. “But you’ll find out in about a month.”\n\nOlivia Balsamo is a writer and producer at Yahoo Finance.
