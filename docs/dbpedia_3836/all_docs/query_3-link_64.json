        "text": "Breaking (bad) news: Dean Norris is joining the cast of Law & Order: Organized Crime Season 4, TVLine has learned exclusively.\n\nThe Breaking Bad alum will play Randall Stabler, Elliot’s older brother, in a multiple-episode arc. As we exclusively reported in November, two of Det. Stabler’s siblings will appear in the upcoming season. Randall, who left the family when he was young and now is a successful real estate developer, has a long-standing tension with Elliot resulting from an event involving their father.\n\nThe other sibling we’ll meet, Joe Jr., is the youngest brother. He spent 15-ish years in the Army before being dishonorably discharged (though he hasn’t said exactly why). He’s now employed by a British wine merchant, but there’s something about the work that makes him ashamed to come face-to-face with Elliot, his hero.\n\nLaw & Order: Organized Crime will return on Thursday, Jan. 18, at 10/9c. (Here’s when your other NBC favorites will be back.)\n\nIn addition to playing Hank Schrader for all five seasons of Breaking Bad, Norris’ TV credits include Under the Dome, The Big Bang Theory, Scandal, Superstore, Better Call Saul, Claws and United States of Al. He also worked with Organized Crime star Meloni in the 2014 film Small Time."
