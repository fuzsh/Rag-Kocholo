Norris then studied at Harvard College, graduating in 1985 with a major in Social Studies. He also attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for one year.\n\nNorris started his career in the 80's, appearing in action films like Lethal Weapon 2 (with Jenette Goldstein, Nestor Serrano and Mark Rolston) and Hard to Kill (with Carlos Gomez).

Some of the shows he appeared in were Grey's Anatomy (with Billy Mayo and John Koyama), Nip/Tuck, The West Wing (with Stephen Root and Janeane Garofalo), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, JAG (with Scott Lawrence), NCIS (with Pauley Perrette), ER (with Eriq La Salle), The Unit (with Dennis Haysbert, Max Martini, Michael Irby, Shaun Duke, Don McManus, John Noble, and Conor O'Farrell), and Castle (with Stana Katic).\n\nNorris gained recognition when he starred on the AMC TV series Breaking Bad as DEA agent Hank Schrader.
