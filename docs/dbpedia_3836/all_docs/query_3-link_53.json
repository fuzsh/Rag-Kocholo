        "text": "Schraderbräu is the mythical home-brew of Walter White’s DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Dean Norris has made the iconic Schraderbräu a reality by producing his silky smooth German Lager for Breaking Bad fans and craft beer enthusiasts to enjoy. Hank’s special Märzen has been artfully lagered to perfection featuring a deep malty richness and beautiful copper color.\n\nBest known for his role as Hank Schrader in the hit TV series Breaking Bad, Dean Norris is an award-winning actor with over 160 film and TV credits to his name. As an avid craft beer aficionado and home-brewer, Dean’s longtime dream has been to bring Schraderbräu out of Hank’s garage and into your fridge.\n\nSchraderbräu Beer is produced at Figueroa Mountain Brewing Co., an award-winning, family-owned and operated brewery in Buellton, CA specializing in world-class traditional and German-style lagers. Founded in 2010 by father and son team Jim and Jaime Dietenhofer, the brewery has amassed an impressive 23 GABF Medals and 6 World Beer Cup awards in less than a decade. The FMB team has taken every detail into account to ensure our Märzen is handcrafted to perfection."
