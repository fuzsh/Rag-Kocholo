        "text": "Carl Richards’ Post\n\nCreator of the Behavior Gap\n\n8mo\n\nThis week on 50 Fires... Breaking Bad’s Dean Norris on living within your means! Being a successful actor is no easy feat, and learning how to navigate the tumultuous waves of the entertainment industry’s financial landscape takes discipline and even frugality. Actor Dean Norris shared how his early obsession with saving money molded his successful acting career. Way before he landed the role of Hank on Breaking Bad, he understood the critical importance of living within his means so that he could continue to pursue acting. Money can offer freedom, but it requires a delicate dance of respect and control, especially in a career that’s as unpredictable as acting. I can't wait to hear what you think of this episode!\n\nLike Comment\n\nTranscript\n\nMoney was just a function of how many months I could go without working, you know, So as long as I kept on 8. My frugality combined with the more money making allowed me to have ** number more months of not having to work. You know, I'm saying so I never bought a car that I couldn't afford and never bought a house I couldn't afford, like like without even worrying about it, you know, I'm saying. So I thought that was a, it ended up being, for me at least, a pretty good way of living life. So interesting that you thought of that early on, like literally came up with the framework yourself of yeah, I think about money in terms of how much I how, how, how many months I can go without working. Right.\n\nSee more comments\n\nTo view or add a comment, sign in"
