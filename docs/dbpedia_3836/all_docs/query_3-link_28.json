        "text": "“Ghosts” is adding two new cast members ahead of its fourth season.\n\nDuring the show’s panel at San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that Dean Norris will guest star in Season 4 as Samantha’s father. In addition, Mary Holland will recur as Patience, the Puritan ghost who made a shocking return to the Woodstone mansion in the Season 3 finale to kidnap Isaac.\n\nNorris’ character is named Frank. He is described as “kindly and well-meaning, Frank arrives at Woodstone for his first visit in years, along with his new girlfriend. Frank and Sam have struggled to stay close since Frank divorced Sam’s mom when Sam was 10. On the surface, Frank and Sam are cordial, but deep-down Sam resents her father for being largely absent from her life. After decades of insisting ‘everything was fine,’ Sam is finally compelled to confront these feelings when a new ghost at Woodstone forces her into an awkward conversation with her dad.”\n\nPatience is the ghost of a Puritan woman who died in the late 1600s. Per the character description, “While alive, she was exceedingly severe and judgmental even by Puritan standards. As such, she was expelled from her village for ‘being a bit too much.’ After being dead a couple hundred years, Patience was inadvertently abandoned by Revolutionary War ghost Isaac underground near the mansion and has become a feral creature ‘roaming the dirt’ since 1895.”\n\nNorris is best known for his role as Hank Schroeder in the hit AMC drama series “Breaking Bad.” He appeared in the show throughout its five-season run and reprised the role of Hank in the prequel series “Better Call Saul.” Norris’ recent credits include “Law & Order: Organized Crime,” “Unfrosted,” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm.”\n\nHe is repped by Innovative Artists and Constellation Media Group.\n\nHolland has previously appeared in comedy films like “Nightbitch,” “Between Two Ferns: The Movie,” and “Senior Year.” In television, she has been on shows like “The Big Door Prize,” “Star Trek: Lower Decks,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “New Girl,” “The Good Place,” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.”\n\nShe is repped by CAA, Atlas Artists, and Ziffren Brittenham.\n\n“Ghosts” Season 4 will debut on Oct. 17 at 8:30 p.m. ET/PT on CBS. The series stars Rose McIver, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Brandon Scott Jones, Richie Moriarty, Danielle Pinnock, Asher Grodman, Román Zaragoza, Sheila Carrasco, Rebecca Wisocky and Devan Chandler Long.\n\nBased on the British series of the same name, the American version of the series was developed by Joe Port and Joe Wiseman, who both serve as executive producers on the series. Additional executive producers are: Richie Keen, Matthew Baynton, Jim Howick, Simon Farnaby, Laurence Rickard, Ben Willbond and Martha Howe-Douglas, Alison Carpenter, Debra Hayward, and Alison Owen of Monumental Television and Angie Stephenson of BBC Studios). “Ghosts” is produced by CBS Studios in association with Lionsgate Television and BBC Studios Los Angeles Productions."
