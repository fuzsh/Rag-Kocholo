Better yet, he will be portrayed by an actor who is known for playing gritty roles.\n\nDean Norris cast on Law & Order: OC\n\nDean Norris is set to play Randall Stabler, Stabler's older brother in Season 4 of Law & Order: OC.

In the movie, Meloni played Al Klein, a used car salesman and the father of the lead character, while Norris played Ash Martini, Klein's sales partner.\n\nNorris himself is eager to tackle the recurring role of Randall Stabler on Season 4 Law & Order: Organized Crime, and to work with Meloni again. \"Very excited to be working with my old bud Meloni. Gonna be a fun Winter Spring in NYC,\" he posted on his Instagram page on December 13, officially confirming his casting on the show.\n\nDean Norris' TV shows\n\nYou most likely recognize Norris as DEA Agent Hank Schrader in Breaking Bad. He revived the character for its prequel series, Better Call Saul, for Season 5 in 2020. His other roles include Howard Fox is Season 5, Episode 20 of NBC's Superstore, Colonel Richard Williams on Season 10 of The Big Bang Theory, Fenton Gackland on Season 7 of Scandal, and councilman James Rennie in the sci-fi series Under the Dome.\n\nRELATED: Fans Are Freaking Out Over \"Bearded Stabler\" & Chris Meloni's Mysterious OC Set Pic\n\nWhat else to know about Law & Order: Organized Crime Season 4\n\nSeason 4 of Law & Order: OC will premiere Thursday, January 18 at 10/9c on NBC and stream next day on Peacock.\n\n“I’m pleased to continue my four-decade relationship with Universal Television and NBC,” executive producer Dick Wolf said in a statement in news of the show returning. “All six shows being picked up again is the ultimate accolade to our incredible casts, producers, and writers. I'd also like to thank our loyal fans who have kept our NBC shows on the air for what will be a cumulative 84 seasons.”\n\nAs of right now, no changes in the casting lineup have been announced with the recurring characters.
