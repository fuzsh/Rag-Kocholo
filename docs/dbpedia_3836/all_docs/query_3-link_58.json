        "text": "Breaking Bad alum Dean Norris has joined the Season 4 cast of Law & Order: Organized Crime in a major recurring role, Deadline has confirmed.\n\nNorris will play Randall Stabler, the older brother of Christopher Meloni’s Elliot Stabler, in a multi-episode arc. The casting was first reported by our sister site TVLine.\n\nAs TVLine previously reported, the upcoming fourth season will introduce Stabler’s brothers Randall and Joe Jr.\n\nRandall, who left the family when he was young and now is a successful real estate developer, has a long-standing tension with Elliot resulting from an event involving their father.\n\nAs previously reported, John Shiban replaces Sean Jablonski as showrunner for Season 4 of the NBC police procedural, which is slated for a midseason return. Premiere date TBA.\n\nStarring Meloni, Law & Order: Organized Crime is executive produced by Dick Wolf, John Shiban, Paul Cabbad, Meloni, Arthur W. Forney and Peter Jankowski.\n\nThe series is produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, in association with Wolf Entertainment.\n\nNorris portrayed Hank Schrader on all five seasons of Breaking Bad. He most recently was seen in a supporting role in Chuck Lorre’s comedy series United States of Al, which ran for two seasons on CBS. His other TV credits include Claws, Better Call Saul, The Big Bang Theory, Under the Dome, Scandal and Get Shorty. He also appeared with Meloni in the 2014 film Small Time."
