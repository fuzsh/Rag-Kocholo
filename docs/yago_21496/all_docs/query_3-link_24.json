        "text": "LOS ANGELES — An incurable tinkerer, Warren Beatty was at work again last weekend, shooting a scene for a 40-year passion project whose status is almost as mysterious as its subject: the industrialist Howard Hughes.\n\nBy habit, Mr. Beatty often returns to an almost finished film to pick up some detail, even a small one — say, the image of a dog walking past a door. This time he was back, working on a picture, still untitled, that he began in 1976 and for which he is the writer, director, producer and star.\n\nThat film, so far invisible and largely shot nine months ago, may be nearing completion and could be ready for release this year.\n\nWhen it finally reaches an audience, the film could crown a storied career for a wily Hollywood operator — in his prime, Mr. Beatty was nicknamed the Pro — who became known for bedding starlets, pursuing Oscars and defying the conventional wisdom with wildly unconventional pictures like “Reds” and “Bonnie and Clyde.” Or it might become a bizarre footnote to his foibles, alongside misfires like “Ishtar” and his last major acting effort, “Town & Country,” released 14 years ago.\n\nIf, in fact, this filmmaker-star, still baby-faced at 77, ever stops tinkering with a film that features stars like Lily Collins; Matthew Broderick; Martin Sheen; Mr. Beatty’s wife, Annette Bening; and Mr. Beatty himself as Hughes. Reached through his hilltop office on Tuesday — he runs his production company out of a nondescript professional building behind a strip mall near Mulholland Drive — Mr. Beatty declined to discuss his progress on the movie. As ever, it was a charming turndown.\n\n“I would appreciate if you would say Mr. Beatty good-naturedly declined to comment,” he said.\n\nMr. Beatty’s project has proved almost as elusive as Hughes, who died in April 1976. But that was not before he had captured the attention of Mr. Beatty, who, a few years earlier, had observed secretive comings and goings around Hughes’s rooms at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Eleven days after Hughes’s death, the trade publication Variety reported that Mr. Beatty was at work on a biopic.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
