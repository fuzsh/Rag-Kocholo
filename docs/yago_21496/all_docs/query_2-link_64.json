        "text": "Heaven Can Wait | 1978\n\nHeaven Can Wait location: The mansion: Filoli Estate, Woodside, California\n\nConfusingly, this is not a remake, not of Ernst Lubitsch’s 1943 Heaven Can Wait, but of the 1941 Here Comes Mr Jordan.\n\nFootballer Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty) is whisked away before his allotted time by overenthusiastic Buck Henry. It’s up to angel Mr Jordan (James Mason) to sort things out.\n\nThe sumptuous mansion in which Pendleton finds himself ensconced is the Filoli Mansion, Canada Road, Woodside, off Highway 280 between San Francisco and San Jose, California.\n\nThe mansion, whose name derives from the family motto: ‘Fight, Love, Life’, was seen in the opening credits of TV soap Dynasty, featured in Wayne Wang’s Joy Luck Club and was more recently seen as Michael Douglas’ home in David Fincher's The Game."
