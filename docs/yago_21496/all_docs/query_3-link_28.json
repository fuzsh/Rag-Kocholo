        "meta_description": "Warren Beatty. Actor: Ein Mann kämpft für Gerechtigkeit. Since starring in his first film, Fieber im Blut (1961), Warren Beatty has been said to have demonstrated a greater longevity in movies than any actor of his generation. Few people have taken so many responsibilities for all phases of the production of films as producer, director, writer, and actor, and few have evidenced so high a level of integrity in a...",

        "text": "John F. Kennedy wanted Beatty to play him in Patrouillenboot PT 109 (1963), after learning that director Elia Kazan had said that if anybody were to play JFK, it should be Beatty since they had so much in common. As Kazan stated, \"Warren had everything Jack had: looks, intelligence, cunning and a commanding eye with the girls. Warren also suffered from lower back trouble.\" Kennedy himself suggested Beatty to Warner Bros to play him. Jack L. Warner asked Beatty to fly over to Washington to meet JFK and talk about the movie with him, but Beatty did not want to make the trip, nor play the part. He found the script too weak and that there was a surprising lack of action. His assessment turned out to be right: Cliff Robertson played the part and the movie flopped. Months later, JFK and Beatty met and Kennedy had to concede that Beatty's decision not to make the movie had been right. Beatty and Kennedy remained very good friends up until Kennedy's death in 1963. Coincidentally, Beatty and John Kennedy Jr. dated two of the same women: Daryl Hannah and Madonna. Beatty was also once linked to Jacqueline Kennedy, though in a 1997 interview he denied they ever consummated it. Christina Onassis, Jackie's stepdaughter from her post-widowhood marriage to Aristotle Onassis, dated Beatty as well.\n\nBeatty first espied future long-term lover Julie Christie at the 1966 Royal Command Performance of Königin der Wildnis (1966) in London, which he attended with his then-girlfriend Leslie Caron. Caron and Beatty were situated near Christie in the reception line for Queen Elizabeth II, and Beatty first saw her in person when he turned to watch the Queen shake hands with her. Beatty inveigled his friend Richard Sylbert to tell her to call him. She did, he flew up to the San Francisco location of the Petulia (1968) shoot and, after a rocky start, they became lovers. She made her first public appearance with Beatty at a sneak preview of Bonnie und Clyde (1967) for the Hollywood elite. It took them several months to rid themselves of their then-current lovers before they came together in a committed relationship, although they usually maintained separate households for the length of their long romance. Most of those who knew them said they shared a passion for the truth. Beatty told his friends he had asked Christie to marry him, but she refused as she did not want children. While filming Shampoo (1975) in 1974, Beatty bought his dream house and brought Christie over to view it. When she realized he had already assigned several rooms as nurseries, it dawned on her that their ideas for the future were too far apart to be able to maintain their relationship. She ended her long affair with him by phone in the fall of 1974. His longest and most lasting relationship until he married Annette Bening, the mother of his four children, Beatty considered Christie his wife and told the press in 1971 that he would pay her alimony if they split up, if she wanted it. They did, but she didn't. When he was awarded the Irving Thalberg Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in 2000, Christie was one of the friends and co-workers who appeared in a filmed tribute to him."
