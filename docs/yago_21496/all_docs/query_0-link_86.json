        "text": "Preview:\n\nGlen Powell’s attached to star in ‘Heaven Can Wait’.\n\nStephen Gaghan is writing the script.\n\nThe story has been brought to screens before, most famously by Warren Beatty.\n\nJust when you thought Glen Powell couldn’t add another project to a growing To Do list, he goes and does just that.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, confirming a story from Puck, Powell is now attached to a new movie version of ‘Heaven Can Wait’, which has been brought to screens several times in the past.\n\nWhat’s the story and history of ‘Heaven Can Wait’?\n\nThis story originated in a 1938 play by Harry Segall, which finds a boxer sent to Heaven by mistake, who argues that he should be sent back to Earth. Trouble is, his body has been cremated, so instead his soul is transported into the form of a pompous financier who is about to be murdered by his wife.\n\nDirector Alexander Hall, working from a script by Sidney Buchman and Seton I. Miller, was the first to adapt the play into a movie, 1941’s ‘Here Comes Mr. Jordan’.\n\nMost famously, Warren Beatty directed and starred in his own adaptation, which restored the original title, but switched the main character to an NFL quarterback who dies prematurely due to an antsy angel and returns to Earth in the body of a recently murdered millionaire. Beatty directed the film with Buck Henry and co-wrote the script with Elaine May.\n\nThe result was nominated for nine Oscars including best picture, with the movie scoring a win for best art direction.\n\nMost recently, Chris Rock took on the idea, starring in 2001’s ‘Down to Earth’, which saw the main character an aspiring black comic who gets a second shot at life by being placed in the body of a wealthy white businessman.\n\nWho is making the new version of ‘Heaven Can Wait’?\n\nStephen Gaghan, who has written the likes of ‘Traffic’ and wrote and directed ‘Syriana’ (he probably wants to forget he was most recently responsible for the Robert Downey Jr.-starring ‘Dolittle’), is behind the script for the new version.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Gaghan has found a new take on the story, though the basics –– a person gets a second chance after an unexpectedly early death –– remain intact.\n\nRelated Article: Glen Powell, Anthony Mackie and Laura Dern Starring in ‘Monsanto’\n\nWhat else is Glen Powell attached to?\n\nPowell is producing and providing the introduction for documentary ‘The Blue Angels’ due on screens on May 23rd and will then be seen in disaster movie follow-up ‘Twisters’, out on July 19th.\n\nHe’s also on board for Edgar Wright’s adaptation of ‘The Running Man’ and John Lee Hancock’s based-on-truth legal drama ‘Monsanto’, among several others.\n\nWhen will ‘Heaven Can Wait’ be in theaters?\n\nThe movie, which is being produced by Paramount, hasn’t got a director attached yet, so news on a release date is unlikely for a while.\n\nList of 'Heaven Can Wait' Movies and Remakes:\n\n'Here Comes Mr Jordan' (1941)\n\n‘Heaven Can Wait' (1943)\n\n‘Heaven Can Wait' (1978)\n\n‘Down to Earth' (2001)"
