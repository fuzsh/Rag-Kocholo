Heaven Can Wait was nominated for a total of eight Academy Awards and ended up winning the Oscar for “Best Art Direction / Set Decoration.”\n\nThe tech specs for the Blu-ray include a 1080p HD video presentation remastered from the original negative under Warren Beatty’s supervision, presumably in the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. While the audio presentation (likely in the original Mono) has not yet been detailed, but stay tuned for an update on that. The release will come with a digital code (copy) of the film.
