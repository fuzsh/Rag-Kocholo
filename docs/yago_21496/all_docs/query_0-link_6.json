An overanxious angel plucks him to heaven only to discover that he wasn't ready to die, and that his body has been cremated.

        "text": "Anchored by a great premise, the film directed by its star (and, as I recently learned, Shirley MacLaine's brother) Warren Beaty and Buck Henry is a sports movie with some charm and an interesting concept that Hollywood has managed to wring out later on, but which unfortunately attempts to tackle too many ideas and clichés in a somewhat uneven way. When our protagonist dies and we get into the murder plot and so on, the sports part becomes so secondary that when it is reintroduced, it felt a little forced to me. Nonetheless, our characters are great, and there are some amusing moments. I must confess that the idea with the plane and everything in the sky was also rather clever.\n\nAll in all, although its handling of the romantic and sporty aspect feels a bit messy, there's enough to love here to warrant a watch.\n\nTODAY SCHEDULE\n\nSecret Agent\n\nYoung and Inocent\n\nPhantom of the Paradise\n\nHeaven Can Wait\n\nCurious to see a movie with such an absurd premise remain as lowkey as this does. personally prefer the screwball antics and energy of elaine may's A New Leaf which I think would've lent themselves well to some of the sillier elements here (like the thwarted murder subplot) but there's still much to like. Beatty especially is very charming and every time he enters a new body but doesn't change his appearance/performance as a good-hearted, can-do football bro (like in the big boardroom scene) it's quite funny watching everyone else react to him. the ending is also very cute. Good movie.\n\nWhen the soul of promising quarterback Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty) is taken from the afterlife too early by an overcautious angel, he has to find a new body in order to achieve his ambitions of playing in the Super Bowl, falling in love in the process, in this fantasy comedy co-starring Julie Christie, James Mason, Charles Gordon, Dyan Cannon, Buck Henry and Jack Warden.\n\nThe film is an adaptation of the 1938 play by Harry Segal which had been previously filmed in 1941 as Here Comes Mr Jordan, and definitely feels like a throwback to the classic era. Like the comedies of the golden age, the film makes the most of a witty high concept script and a starry cast…\n\ntold Harris I had to watch all of the Beattys before getting to Bulworth, which I guess just means this + Dick Tracy, but still. eager to delve into whatever the Beatty/Dick Tracy web special nonsense everyone indulges. this is the kind of shit we used to make in this country before someone would post a 19 minute long Youtube video about the interior logic of its afterlife system – stop asking questions about this kind of shit, IT'S JUST LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY. I love Charles Grodin AND I love Buck Henry.\n\n“Haven't you learned the rules of probability and outcome? Aren't you aware that every question of life and death remains a probability until the outcome?”\n\nThe concept alone is something that we have all seen a dozen times but it is still absolutely genius. A man who died unexpectedly, is given the chance to come back as a different person. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThe film is directed by Warren Beatty and the fantastic comic screenwriter, Buck Henry. Having seen, Beatty’s second film : ‘Reds’, it is apparent that Beatty’s direction evolved and matured a lot shortly after this. The films direction is good but nothing spectacular.\n\nThis is Beatty’s and Henry’s directional debut and it is very apparent at…"
