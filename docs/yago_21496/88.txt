Warren Beatty and Buck Henry – 1978

Heaven Can Wait is an impressive comedy with yet another great performance from Warren Beatty. The film marks his first directing credit – and it’s a strong debut. The film is based on the play Heaven Can Wait by Harry Segall – which was made into the film Here Comes Mr. Jordan in 1941. It might be the wrong thing to say – but this is better.

The supporting cast in the film is phenomenal: Julie Christie, James Mason, Jack Warden, Charles Grodin and co-director Buck Henry – and they all do great things with their roles. However, Heaven Can Wait is Warren Beatty’s movie and he’s charismatic as hell.

Worth a watch!
