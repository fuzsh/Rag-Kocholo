HE AROSE!\n\nHALLELUJAH! CHRIST AROSE!\n\nSPEAKING TO YOURSELVES IN PSALMS AND HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS,\n\nSINGING AND MAKING MELODY IN YOUR HEART TO THE LORD; – EPHESIANS 3:19\n\nMARKER PLACED BY THE BAPTIST HISTORY PRESERVATION SOCIETY- MAY 16, 2007\n\nLocated at the Sixth Avenue Baptist Church – corner of 6 Avenue and Lincoln Place, Brooklyn, NY 13"
