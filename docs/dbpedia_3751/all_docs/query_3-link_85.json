        "text": "Robert Lowry turned 100 years old Monday, July 31.\n\nHe was born in Dunbar, South Carolina to parents Leloa and John Lowry. However, Robert grew up in Waynesboro after the family moved to Georgia.\n\nBeginning at the age of 18 Robert served in the U.S. Army and traveled to England, France and Japan. In his early twenties, he moved to Miami, Florida where he worked in the construction industry.\n\nHe moved back to Waynesboro approximately a year ago to live closer to family, including his nieces, Jean Jenkins, Bobbie Rivers, Mary Scott and Shannon Scott, and his nephew, Probate Judge Ashley Moore.\n\nSince moving back, Robert has become fond of visiting with new friends at the Burke County Senior Center. He also rides the stationary bike at the center every other day for 5-25 minutes. When asked if he rode a bicycle in Florida as part of a regular exercise routine, he is quick to point out that even seniors can benefit from beginning a new exercise regimen.\n\n“Nooooo,” he said laughing about his previous exercise routine. “It’s never too late.”\n\nBorn in 1923, he said he has witnessed a lot of societal changes. The most surprising changes in his eyes, involve the advancement of Black Americans. Robert recalls vividly the days the U.S. struggled with desegregation.\n\nBlessed with a remarkable mind, Robert also recalls a funnel cloud that touched ground in the mid-1920s. He felt fortunate his home was not affected by the tornado.\n\nAs far as the secret to living a long, healthy life, Lowry has no answers. However, he suspects a diet that includes fruits, vegetables and meats may have contributed.\n\n“I never thought I would be 100 years old,” he said laughing. “It’s nice to be 100, but it’s bad to be old.”\n\nJudge Moore said his uncle was determined to celebrate his centennial birthday. Just months ago, Robert mentioned to him that 99 1/2 just “wouldn’t do.”\n\n“Determined; that is him without a doubt,” Moore said."
