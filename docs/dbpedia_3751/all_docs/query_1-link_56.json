        "text": "Professor Shane J. Wood says his hero and mentor, Robert A. Lowery, always told him to write “to add to the conversation.”\n\nNow Wood, who is on the faculty at Ozark Christian College in Joplin, Mo., and 17 other authors from across the world are doing just that in compiling “Dragons, John and Every Grain of Sand: Essays on the Book of Revelation.”\n\nThe book honors Lowery, professor of New Testament and dean of Bible and theology at Lincoln Christian University and Seminary in Lincoln, and one of the preeminent voices on Revelation.\n\nThe book, from College Press (Joplin, Mo.), is due later this year.\n\nWood says the work will try to do what Lowery has done his whole professional life: make Revelation, or the Apocalypse of John — the last book of the New Testament — more accessible to the public and wipe away some of the anxiety and mythology that has grown up around it.\n\n“In the 30-plus years of (Lowery’s) teaching, Revelation has been widely abused,” says Wood, a former research assistant of Lowery’s at Lincoln Christian. “He has always preached responsibility in teaching Revelation.”\n\n“It wouldn’t honor Bob Lowery,” adds Fred Hansen, one of the book’s contributors and instructor in New Testament at Lincoln Christian, “to go off and write a massive tome that’s inaccessible to the general public.”\n\n‘It wasn’t hard to say yes’\n\nThe project also carries an emotional weight: Lowery was diagnosed last summer with carcinoid tumors, a slow-spreading, incurable cancer.\n\nAccording to Lowery’s blog, a recent scan showed no growth of additional tumors and no growth of the tumors already on his liver. He continues to receive monthly injections to help minimize the cancer’s symptoms.\n\nLowery’s condition prompted Wood and others to move quickly last fall to compile a list of contributors, including colleagues, former teachers and students and other scholars, to the festschrift, or “writing party,” a book written in honor of someone, usually commemorating some career hallmark and more prevalent in academia. (See information below.)\n\nThe project was unveiled publicly in a video presentation at Ozark Christian in February following a convention where Lowery delivered a lecture.\n\nAlthough there are essays by noted New Testament experts, other authors, including Lowery’s colleague, R. Neal Windham, professor of New Testament and Christian spirituality, had to step out of their areas of expertise.\n\n“Deep down, I was elated to be asked and scared to death,” admits Windham, who studied under Lowery at Lincoln Christian.\n\n“His health story spurred me on. I dropped everything (to take this on.) I just wanted to do my best.”\n\n“It wasn’t hard to say yes to the project,” says Gary Hall, professor of Old Testament at Lincoln Christian, who team-teaches a course with Lowery there.\n\nHall, whose submission looks at Revelation from an Old Testament perspective, shares something else with Lowery: in late 2000, he had his left kidney removed after a tumor was discovered on it.\n\nAt the same time Lowery got his diagnosis last year, Hall had surgery to remove his remaining adrenal gland as well as a small tumor near his right kidney. This spring, Hall started chemotherapy after a CT scan showed two enlarged lymph nodes in his chest.\n\n“We have had many conversations about health, treatments, our doctors, death, etc.,” Hall says. “We have prayed and cried and laughed together.”\n\nSomething for everyone\n\nWood, who has spent part of this summer as a doctoral candidate at the University of Edinburgh, decided to divide the book into three sections: general studies in Revelation, difficult passages and applying Revelation to the church.\n\nThe public, Wood says, is afraid of Revelation because of all the imagery — a dragon with its tail sweeping stars out of the sky, a beast with seven heads and 10 horns — and the apocalyptic warnings advanced by authors such as Hal Lindsey (“The Late Great Planet Earth”) and Edgar C. Whisenant (“88 Reasons the Rapture Will Be in 1988”), and by the “Left Behind” series.\n\n“It’s polarizing,” Wood admits. “(Lowery) has empowered people to handle the book on its own.”\n\nPart of the motivation of the project, Wood adds, was to perpetuate Lowery’s legacy, solidified by the professor’s own book, “Revelation’s Rhapsody: Listening to the Lyrics of the Lamb,” from 2006.\n\nHansen, who hosts a weekly luncheon with Lowery for Lincoln Christian students, says one of the most valuable lessons Lowery has taught is that Revelation interpretations shouldn’t be ethno-centric. Those who believe that social security numbers are “marks of the beast” should mind, notes Hansen, that such numbers only came into existence in the United States after World War II. The idea of “rapture,” Wood adds, dates only back to the 1800s.\n\n“Scripture is for all people at all times and places,” says Hansen, who adds that Lowery has always showed the timeliness and timelessness of Revelation.\n\nDespite the honorific intentions of the book, Hansen says none of the writers felt hamstrung by the process.\n\n“We had plenty of freedom to reach conclusions (not necessarily in line with Lowery’s),” Hansen says. “That doesn’t dishonor Bob. He’d welcome further conversation. He’d admit that he’s still learning, and that’s a model for all of us.”\n\nPart of the title of the book — “Every Grain of Sand” — is taken from the Bob Dylan song, one that Lowery has quoted often through the years.\n\nNow, in a moment of urgency, Shane Wood says its lyrics take on new meaning.\n\n“The song reminds me that even in times of bewilderment and in moments of perceived clarity, God is still moving, he is still in control and he can see how his plan works out far beyond what I can comprehend,” he says. “I trust God’s hand. I trust his decision not to intervene in (Lowery’s illness), and I trust that God will provide comfort and peace to those that seek him in times of need like this.”\n\nSteven Spearie can be reached at spearie@hotmail.com or 622-1788.\n\nWhat is a “festschrift?”\n\nThe term “festschrift,” a German word translated to mean “writing party,” is an honorific book, usually confined to academia.\n\nIts essays or chapters are penned by the honoree’s colleagues and former students, as in the case of “Dragons, John and Every Grain of Sand: Essays on the Book of Revelation,” honoring Robert A. Lowery, a longtime professor of New Testament and dean of theology at Lincoln Christian University and Seminary in Lincoln.\n\nWhat makes the project more unusual, says Gary Hall, professor of Old Testament at Lincoln Christian, is that the contributors are from a wider circle, including world-renowned experts in the field of Revelation.\n\n“It speaks of (Lowery’s) reputation beyond the Lincoln Christian circle,” Hall says.\n\n“It’s a unique collection of writers,” adds R. Neal Windham, professor of New Testament and Christian spirituality at Lincoln Christian. “Some of these guys are as well-known as anyone.”\n\nFestschriften are most common at a retirement or a landmark birthday, Hall says. The collections are often an avenue to publishing essays that might otherwise get overlooked and can provide significant research on the subject.\n\n“It’s probably one of the highest honors one can give someone,” Hall says.\n\nWhile some festschriften can “get super-technical,” Windham says, he sees this collaboration as more accessible to the general public.\n\nThree other festschriften have honored past professors and administrators at Lincoln Christian, Hall says.\n\n— Steven Spearie"
