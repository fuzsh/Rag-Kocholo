He was 57 years old.\n\nMr. Lowery's career spanned more than 30 years in films, including “The Mark of Zorro,” “Young Dr. Lincoln,” “Drums Along the Mohawk,” “The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond,” “Charlie Chan in Reno,” and “Free, Blonde and 21.”\n\n“For a while there it seemed like he was in a picture every week,” said a friend, who added that. Mr. Lowery was often mistaken for Clark Gable by autograph seekers.\n\nMr. Lowery was married to and divorced from the actresses Jean Parker and Barbara Farrell.\n\nMr. Lowery, who was born ln Kansas City, Mo., got his start in the entertainment world as a singer with orchestras and an actor in little theater groups."
