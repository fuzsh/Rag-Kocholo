        "text": "Robert \"Bob\" Lowery, a Texas father who vanished in a national forest in Wyoming, died by suicide, a coroner said Wednesday.\n\nLowery, 46, disappeared after he flew to Jackson Hole on Aug. 19 and took a ride-sharing car service to Wilson, a town near multiple national forest trailheads. His body was properly identified, and the cause of death was confirmed to be suicide, the Teton County coroner, Dr. Brent Blue, said Wednesday.\n\nLeigh Lowery, his sister, told NBC's \"Dateline\" that he resigned from his real estate job and was going on various camping trips before he started a new job. His family grew worried after he stopped contacting his two minor children.\n\nLowery's remains were found Sept. 28 in Bridger-Teton National Forest, the same forest where authorities found Gabby Petito's body Sept. 19. Volunteer rescue teams with a dog found a set of remains and a black Nike duffel bag on a steep, wooded slope, the Teton County Search and Rescue said at the time.\n\nPetito's disappearance, covered by national news outlets, helped highlight Lowery's case, authorities have said. At least two people contacted police with new information about the last place he was possibly seen the weekend before his body was found.\n\n\"The new information put Lowery on the Black Canyon Trail, wearing a black baseball cap with a gold P, and carrying a black duffle bag with the Nike logo,\" authorities said."
