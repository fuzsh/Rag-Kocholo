        "text": "Some Books About Alaska 1994\n\nIntroduction\n\nJuvenile\n\nAdult Fiction\n\nAdult Non-fiction\n\nIntroduction\n\nOur new title, Some Books About Alaska 1994, marks a change in the Alaska Historical Collections' annual publication. Since 1969 it has listed the Alaska-Arctic related publications received by the Alaska Historical Collections of the Alaska State Library. With few exceptions, the Alaska State Library no longer purchases Alaskan adult fiction or children's materials. Furthermore, we have cut back on our purchase of non-fiction publications. Thus, the title change from Some Books About Alaska Received in....reflects this modification in our collection development policy.\n\nThe books listed herein are not necessarily held by the Alaska State Library. Please consult your local library or the WLN (Western Library Network) for libraries holding these titles.\n\nWe are continuing this publication because we feel strongly that an annual annotated list of books is of value to libraries in Alaska. We also think that this list should be as complete as possible for titles that appeared in 1994. Every attempt has been made to have each title reviewed by a librarian. Several Alaskana Librarians from around the state assisted in this compilation. Especially helpful have been Bruce Merrell of Anchorage Municipal Libraries and Nancy Lesh of the Anchorage Consortium Library. I have tried to include titles that have been reviewed, but a few include the note \"Not available for review.\" I would also like to thank Hearthside Books of Juneau for allowing me to review their children's books and Kay Myers of the Anchorage Municipal Libraries who contributed her expertise.\n\nDesignations found in the listing:\n\nFirst Purchase Recommendation:\n\nAs in past years, we are using this feature to designate those books which the committee felt were most worthy of consideration for first purchase by small and medium-sized libraries and school library-media centers. Each library must, of course, make its own decision on whether to purchase these titles, comparing each to the library's book selection policy. Our choices are necessarily subjective, but we have attempted to include titles of general interest and to omit those which are highly specialized. We also have not marked materials of local interest only, but have noted regional publications which we felt were outstanding.\n\nASD Alaska State Depository :\n\nA small selection of titles produced by the Alaska State Government as well as non-state publications received for distribution by the Alaska State Documents Program at the Alaska State Library are listed. Approximately twenty titles are noted here to alert readers to publications that may not appear in bookstores. After the bibliographic information, these titles are designated as \"ASD\" which means that they were distributed to the Alaska State Depositories and thus may be reviewed at libraries participating in the program. The address and/or contact within the agency is included with the citation. Thanks to Patience Frederiksen, Government Publications Librarian, Alaska State Library, for her assistance with the selection and annotation of these titles.\n\nMany titles are available through interlibrary loan, and libraries are encouraged to review titles before making the decision to purchase. Please check the Western Library Network (WLN) either on-line or through LaserCat to find the closest library from which to request an interlibrary loan.\n\nPublications are available from the publisher of the work or other indicated source. Many bookstores in Alaska also offer these titles, many times at a discount to libraries. The Alaska State Library does not offer books for sale. Also, remember that all prices are subject to change and that those prices listed here may no longer be accurate. In some cases, we have received the book as a gift and do not know the price.\n\nAlaska materials can be elusive, being published in limited quantity with little publicity. We will appreciate receiving information for current, especially locally produced titles not included here. Please send comments and inquiries to the following address: Alaska Historical Collections, Alaska State Library, PO Box 110571, Juneau, AK 99811-0571.\n\nKathryn H.
