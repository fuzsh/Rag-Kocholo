Cushing),\n\nShall We Gather At The River?\n\nHow Can I Keep From Singing?\n\nMarching to Zion (tune)\n\nLowry combined his pastoral work with a professorship in rhetoric at his alma mater, and later served as the University's chancellor. From 1868 he acted as hymnals editor to Biglow and Main, the country's leading publisher of gospel and Sunday School music; under his supervision more than 20 hymnals were produced by the firm, many of wide and enduring popularity.\n\nDespite his protestations that preaching was his main vocation and that music was merely a sideline, it is as a hymnwriter that Lowry is chiefly remembered, ranking with such as W. H. Doane and Ira D. Sankey as one of the originators of a musical tradition that has lasted until the modern era of revival.\n\nContents 1 Life 1.1 Early life 1.2 Ministry 1.3 Later years and death 2 Hymn writer 3 Assessment and legacy 4 Notes and references 4.1 Notes 4.2 References 4.3 Sources 5 External links\n\nHe married Anne Rhees Loxley in 1854.[3]\n\nChildren:\n\nHarry Moore Lowry 1857–1927\n\nWheaton Smith Lowry 1859–1943\n\nBenjamin Loxley Lowry b.Apr 1861-d.24 Oct 1862 (Listed under Ben Lonley Loury in the Mt.
