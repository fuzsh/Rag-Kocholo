        "text": "Robert Lowry (March 12, 1826 â€“ November 25, 1899) was an American professor of literature, a Baptist minister and composer of gospel hymns.\n\nLowry studied theology at the University at Lewisburg (now Bucknell University) and on graduating, in 1854, became ordained as a Baptist minister. He had charge of churches in a number of places including New York; Brooklyn; West Chester, Pennsylvania; and New Jersey.\n\nIn 1869 he returned to Lewisburg as a faculty member (having previously served as a professor of literature) and later went on to become its chancellor.\n\nFrom 1880 until 1886 he was president of the New Jersey Baptist Sunday School Union.\n\nHe is most remembered as a composer of gospel music and a hymn writer, and also worked as a music editor at the Biglow & Main Publishing Company. He was responsible for around 500 compositions, including \"Nothing But the Blood,\" \"Low in the Grave He Lay\" (words and music),\" \"Shall We Gather At The River?,\" and \"How Can I Keep From Singing?\" He also wrote the music and refrain for \"Marching to Zion\" (words by Isaac Watts).\n\nDespite his success as a hymn writer, it was as a preacher that Lowry would have preferred to be recognised. He once stated: \"Music, with me has been a side issue... I would rather preach a gospel sermon to an appreciative audience than write a hymn. I have always looked upon myself as a preacher and felt a sort of depreciation when I began to be known more as a composer.\"[1] But, however, it is as a hymn writer that he remains renowned.\n\nLowry was married with three sons and died in Plainfield, New Jersey on 23rd November 1899. He is interred in Hillside Cemetery.\n\nLowry was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and served as the second national president, preceded by Joseph Benson Foraker, Governor of Ohio.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Works\n\n2 Bibliography\n\n3 References\n\n4 External links\n\nWorks\n\nVolumes he edited include:\n\nHappy Voices (1865)\n\nGospel Melodies (1868)\n\nBright Jewels (1869)\n\nPure Gold (1871)\n\nRoyal Diadem (1873)\n\nTemple Anthems (1873)\n\nTidal Wave (1874)\n\nGood as Gold (1880)\n\nOur Glad Hosannas (1882)\n\nJoyful Lays (1884)\n\nGlad Refrain (1886)\n\nBibliography\n\nButterworth, Hezekiah.
