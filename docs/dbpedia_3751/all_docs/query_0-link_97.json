        "text": "Chapter 1. Creating Tradition\n\n1. The principal early account of the campfire discussion is found in Nathaniel Pitt Langford, The Discovery of Yellowstone Park: Journal of the Washburn Expedition to the Yellowstone and Firehole Rivers in the Year 1870 (1905; reprint ed., Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1972), ix-xvii, xix-xx, 117-118. See also Hiram Martin Chittenden, Yellowstone National Park: Historical and Descriptive (1895; rev. ed., Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1933), 69. In 1994 Death Valley National Monument was redesignated a national park and expanded to include more acreage than Yellowstone.\n\n2. With Yosemite the federal government divested itself of responsibility for management of the reserved lands, whereas the Yellowstone Act called for the national government's involvement in park management. In addition to the commitment to federal rather than state management, the sheer size and scope of Yellowstone and the 1872 act's more fully developed national park policy statementmandating for the first time preservation as well as usemake Yellowstone the true benchmark for the national park concept. For a discussion of the authorization of the Yosemite lands as a state-managed park, see Alfred Runte, Yosemite: The Embattled Wilderness (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1990), 18-21; and Richard A. Bartlett, Nature's Yellowstone (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1974), 195-197.\n\nArtist George Catlin's 1832 proposal that the federal government establish a large \"magnificent park\" on the American plains had no influence. In contrast, an 1865 suggestion by Montana's acting territorial governor, Thomas Francis Meagher, that Yellowstone become a national park, may be seen as part of the background of the park movement. The term \"national park\" was not used in the Yellowstone Park Act itself, but was used during debates over passage of the act. Aubrey L. Haines, Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment (Washington, D.C.: National Park Service, 1974), xxi, 45, 113, 121, 126. Catlin's proposal is mentioned in Roderick Nash, Wilderness and the American Mind (1967; 3rd ed., New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982), 100-101.\n\n3. Haines, Yellowstone National Park, 58-59, 93-98, 109-110, 114, 120-121, 126-128, 153-155; Aubrey L. Haines, The Yellowstone Story: A History of Our First National Park (Yellowstone National Park: Yellowstone Library and Museum Association 1977), I, 153, 164-166, 172; Alfred Runte, National Parks: The American Experience (1979; rev. ed., Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1987), 44-46; and Runte, Trains of Discovery: Western Railroads and the National Parks (1984; rev. ed., Niwot, Colorado: Roberts Rinehart, 1990), 13-20.\n\n4. Cooke made his remarks in a letter to Northern Pacific official W. Milner Roberts, October 30, 1871. Haines, Yellowstone National Park, 109-110.\n\nbetween Cooke and Langford \"evidently led to some understanding between them concerning the usefulness of Yellowstone exploration in the grand scheme of Northern Pacific Railroad publicity.\" Similarly, Richard Bartlett, in Nature's Yellowstone (p. 208), states that \"the evidence, though fragmentary, is sufficient to credit the inspiration for the creation of Yellowstone National Park to officials of the Northern Pacific Railroad.\" See also Robin W. Winks, Frederick Billings: A Life (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 285-287; and Runte, Trains of Discovery, 13.\n\nIn fact, the evidence is slim that the altruistic campfire discussion occurredand even if it did, it likely reflected the Northern Pacific's aspirations. The Washburn-Doane Expedition left no written record of such a discussion. Nathaniel Langford's original account of the expedition, taken from his field notes, did not even mention the conversationnor was it mentioned in any of the known diaries or notes written by other participants. Not until thirty-five years later, when he compiled a diary and published it in 1905, did Langford produce his account of the campfire discussion, including a suspicious amount of detail in light of the length of time elapsed. By then, with several new parks created, the national park idea had attained greater popularity; thus, recognition for having helped conceive the idea may have had special appeal to Langford. At about the time Langford's new account appeared, another expedition member, Cornelius Hedges, added to his diary a brief reference to the campfire meetingaltogether a curious rush to amend the record. With such meager historical documentation, the campfire story cannot be proved or disproved. Whether or not it is rooted in historical fact, the story achieved legendary status. Haines, The Yellowstone Story, I, 105, 130, 137-140, 164-165; and Louis C. Cramton, Early History of Yellowstone National Park and Its Relation to National Park Policies (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1932), 19. See also Runte, National Parks, 41-42; and Bartlett, Nature's Yellowstone, 198-208. Ferdinand Hayden's role in establishing Yellowstone's boundaries is mentioned in Runte, National Parks, 46; and Nash, Wilderness and the American Mind, 112.\n\n6. Keith R. Widder, Mackinac National Park, 1875-1895, Reports in Mackinac History and Archaeology no. 4 (Mackinac Island State Park Commission, 1975), 6, 41-46.\n\n7.

Dilsaver and William C. Tweed, Challenge of the Big Trees of Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks (Three Rivers, California: Sequoia Natural History Association, 1990), 70-73. In Trains of Discovery (p. 1) Runte characterizes the close ties between the western railroad companies and the national parks as a \"pragmatic alliance.\" National parks promised profits for the companies, and without railroad support many of the major parks \"might never have been established in the first place.\" Richard J. Orsi, in \" 'Wilderness Saint' and 'Robber Baron': The Anomalous Partnership of John Muir and the Southern Pacific Company for Preservation of Yosemite National Park,\" Pacific Historian 29 (Summer-Fall 1985), 136-152, emphasizes the conservation concerns as well as the economic interests of Southern Pacific officials in the company's support of national parks.\n\nAs examples of the size of some of the larger parks, at the time of their authorization, Sequoia comprised 161,597 acres; Yosemite, 719,622; Mt. Rainier, 207,360; Crater Lake, 159,360; Mesa Verde, 79,561; and Rocky Mountain, 229,062. With additions and deletions of park lands, the size of the parks would vary over time. Information on original acreage provided by Renee C. Minnick, National Park Service.\n\n8. Hillory A. Tolson, Laws Relating to the National Park Service, the National Parks and Monuments (Washington, D.C.: National Park Service, 1933), 50, 65; Runte, Yosemite, 45-47, 54-55; Dilsaver and Tweed, Challenge of the Big Trees, 64-73. Dilsaver and Tweed note (p. 73) a \"corporate greed\" factor in the creation of the Sierra parksa reference to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company's support of both the Sequoia and the Yosemite legislation, which would enhance the company's tourism and agricultural interests. Orsi, in \" 'Wilderness Saint' \" and 'Robber Baron' \" (p. 148), credits the Southern Pacific executive and \"devoted lover of wilderness\" Daniel K. Zumwalt with increasing the size of Yosemite and Sequoia as originally legislated. See also Roderick Frazier Nash, The Rights of Nature: A History of Environmental Ethics (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), 35. Forest and watershed protection as a factor in the 1885 establishment of New York's Adirondack Forest Preserve (later State Park) is discussed in Frank Graham, Jr., The Adirondack Park: A Political History (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1978), 70-71, 76-77, 88-91; and Nash, Wilderness and the American Mind, 104-105, 116-121.\n\n9. In National Parks: The American Experience (pp. 14-47) Alfred Runte discusses \"monumentalism,\" a term used to describe the urge to create national parks in areas of the most grand and unusual scenery. He also examines the \"cultural nationalism\" factor in the park movement, asserting that Americans looked to the monumental scenery of the parks as an affirmation that their young nation was not inferior to Europe. A history of the early national park years is also found in William C. Everhart, The National Park Service (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1972), 3-21.\n\n10. Platt and Sully's Hill are discussed in John Ise, Our National Park Policy: A Critical History (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1961), 139-142. See also Palmer H. Boeger, Oklahoma Oasis: From Platt National Park to Chickasaw National Recreation Area (Muskogee, Oklahoma: Western Heritage Books, 1987). Ise (p. 139) asserts that Sully's Hill was \"unworthy\" of being a national park. Similarly, Horace M. Albright, the second director of the National Park Service, viewed Platt and Sully's Hill as \"totally lacking in national park qualifications. . . . established because of the parochial enthusiasm of local politicians.\" Horace M. Albright, as told to Robert Cahn, The Birth of the National Park Service: The Founding Years, 1913-1933 (Salt Lake City: Howe Brothers, 1985), 5; see also 223.\n\n11.

Steen, The U.S. Forest Service: A History (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1976), 98-100. Robert W. Righter, in \"National Monuments to National Parks: The Use of the Antiquities Act of 1906,\" Western Historical Quarterly 20 (August 1989), 281-301, analyzes the sometimes deliberate use of the national monument designation as a first step toward creating national parks.\n\n12. Much later, and with the precedent of size long established, President Jimmy Carter would use the Antiquities Act to establish vast national monuments in Alaska.\n\nToday, units of the national park system have approximately two dozen different designations including national parks, national monuments, national preserves, and national recreation areas, plus a bewildering variety of designations for historic and prehistoric sites. Throughout this study the terms \"national park\" and \"park\" are used interchangeably to refer to units of the national park system, whatever their individual designation, unless otherwise specified.\n\n13.

Soon after creation of the National Park Service, its first director, Stephen T. Mather, expressed an interest in the dunes along Lake Michigan's shoreline as a possible national park. However, Mather seems to have been primarily interested in the area's recreational potential for serving Chicago, his hometown.

Recreational tourism in national parks would come to include a great diversity of activitiesfor instance, sightseeing, automobile touring, camping, museum going, attending campfire talks, fishing, horseback riding, wilderness hiking and camping, motorboating, snowmobiling, even downhill skiing.\n\n19.

Linda Wedel Greene, in Yosemite: The Park and Its Resources (Denver: National Park Service, 1987), details the extensive early development in the valley. See for instance I, 114-163.\n\nNow considered a farsighted statement of national park principles, Olmsted's 1865 report was quickly suppressed, apparently by men who did not fully agree with its philosophy or who feared it might draw funding from their own projects. The report disappeared and was not rediscovered until the early 1950s. It is reproduced in Frederick Law Olmsted, \"The Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Trees: A Preliminary Report (1865),\" with an introduction by Laura Wood Roper, Landscape Architecture 43 (October 1952), 12-25.

A detailed history of road construction in Yellowstone is found in Mary Shivers Culpin, The History of the Construction of the Road System in Yellowstone National Park, 1872-1966 (Denver: National Park Service, 1994), I. Use of the U.S. Army to manage Yellowstone or other early national parks does not seem to have been influenced by the army's experience in operating Mackinac National Park.\n\n27.

Examples of similarities in leasing provisions of national park enabling legislation are found in Tolson, Laws Relating to the National Park Service (1933), 49 (Sequoia and General Grant), 102 (Mount Rainier), 112 (Crater Lake), 123-124 (Wind Cave), 138-139 (Glacier), 155 (Rocky Mountain), 172 (Hawaii), and 189 (Lassen Volcanic).\n\n28.

National Park Conference, 1915, Proceedings, 19-20. The kind of development designed by Daniels and future generations of national park landscape architects helps account for the distinctly different appearance of many national park villages when compared to typical American towns having little control over development.\n\n32. Samuel P. Hays discusses Gifford Pinchot and the U.S. Forest Service's interest in gaining control of the national parks in Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1959), 195-198.\n\n33. Most parks had mandates similar to Yellowstone's to preserve natural conditions. As with the leasing provisions, in some legislation the wording was taken verbatim from the Yellowstone Park Act. See for example Tolson, Laws Relating to the National Park Service (1933), 49 (Sequoia and General Grant), 102 (Mount Rainier), 155 (Rocky Mountain), 172 (Hawaii), and 189 (Lassen Volcanic).\n\n34.

National park historian Richard Bartlett depicts predator control in the parks as having been a \"spillover from the ranching frontier.\" The war against predators indeed reflected practices on private and public lands throughout the country, practices that would soon be underwritten by the Bureau of Biological Survey.

Keiter, in his \"National Park Protection: Putting the Organic Act to Work,\" in David J. Simon, ed., Our Common Lands: Defending the National Parks (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1988), 81, states that the Organic Act \"sets forth an impressive, unambiguous resource preservation mandate.\" Alston Chase, in Playing God in Yellowstone: The Destruction of America's First National Park (Boston: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1986), 6, comments that the National Park Service's \"sole mission is preservation.\" Similarly, John Lemons and Dean Stout, in \"A Reinterpretation of National Park Legislation, Environmental Law (Northwestern School of Law, Lewis and Clark College) 15 (1984), 41-65, argue that the Organic Act's primary mandate is to preserve park resources: \"the purpose of natural parks is to preserve pristine ecological processes\" (p. 53); and \"the most basic fiduciary duties of the [National Park Service] are to reduce development and promote preservation of resources\" (p. 65). By contrast, Alfred Runte, in National Parks: The American Experience (1979; 2nd ed. rev., Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1987), emphasizes the parks' tourism and economic potential as key motivating factors for the legislation establishing the National Park Service.

Similar to this version of the national parks' purpose, Congress would declare in a law passed in 1978 that the parks were to be protected and managed in a manner that avoids \"derogation of the values and purposes for which the parks were established.\" Redwood National Park Expansion Act, sec. 101b, Public Law 95-250, 16, United States Code.

Although the correspondence reveals no specific evidence, it may be that inclusion of \"historic\" objects was intended to cover the kinds of resources protected by the 1906 Antiquities Act, which authorized creation of national monuments. By the Organic Act, the National Park Service would be mandated to administer those national monuments then under the jurisdiction of the Interior Department.\n\n39.

Expressing similar concerns about adverse development, McFarland wrote of the need for a statement to \"form a bar against any possibly strained construction which might be damaging to the parks.\" J. Horace McFarland to Walter L. Fisher, December 19, 1911, JHMcF.\n\n42. Olmsted proposed that the independent board be similar to those used with local park systems around the country; it should be advisory, as opposed to executive, and serve as a check against misuse of the parks by ensuring a \"harmonious continuity of policy.\" Shortly before passage of the Organic Act, Olmsted's proposal was rejected because of the Interior Department's uneasiness about the board's potential power. Less than two decades later, with the Historic Sites Act of 1935, Congress authorized a national park advisory board. Legislative draft appended to letter from Frederick Law Olmsted to J.

Led by Cornell and Yale, a few universities had begun to develop programs in the applied science of land and resource management. Increasingly, the federal and state bureaus involved in game, fish, and forest management looked to such programs for advice and for new personnel. See A.

Transfer of the National Park Service's wildlife biologists to the Biological Survey began in early December 1939 and was made official on January 1, 1940. Annual Report of the Secretary of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1940 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1940), 165; National Park Service, \"National Parks: A Review of the Year,\" American Planning and Civic Annual (1940), 34. The Bureau of Biological Survey had just been transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior. In 1940 the survey would be merged with the Bureau of Fisheries to become the Fish and Wildlife Service, now known as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n2. Horace M.

On his death, Mather left Albright and Cammerer $25,000 each, partly because he hoped the money would ensure their independence of thought as Park Service leaders. Swain, Wilderness Defender, 193. In \"The National Park Service and the New Deal\" (p. 316), Swain depicts Cammerer as a \"relatively weak director,\" whom Secretary Ickes did not care for. In contrast to this perception, Cammerer adroitly used his talented staff to promote Park Service programs under the New Deal. George Collins, a longtime, highly placed Park Service employee, recalled that Cammerer \"used Mr. Demaray and Mr. Wirth, Ben Thompson, Hillory Tolson and others to his highest and best advantage, and to theirs as well. The service had a growing reputation of efficiency and ability. I think you have to credit [Cammerer] a lot for that.\" George L. Collins, \"The Art and Politics of Park Planning and Preservation,\" interviews by Ann Lage, 1978 and 1979, Regional Oral History Office, University of California, typescript, 86, NPS-HC. Ickes' disregard for Cammerer is discussed in Thomas H. Watkins, Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold Ickes, 1874-1952 (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1990), 552-555.\n\n6. Arthur E.

In his October 11 memorandum, Albright mentions Wright's belief that the survey should be conducted under Park Service direction. A stronger statement that Wright was \"very anxious\" that it be a Park Service projectis found in Joseph Dixon to Horace M. Albright, March 7, 1929, Horace M. Albright files, MVZ-UC.\n\n7.

Albright, November 23, 1928, Entry 17, RG79. Albright had earlier stated to Mather that two important benefits from the survey would be \"widening the scope of our educational work . . . and [securing] material for the development of our museums and general educational activities.\" Albright to the Director, October 11, 1928. Negotiations on the survey were stalled briefly in the winter of 1929 owing to the proposal's being \"unduly emphasized as a special achievement\" of the Education Division. The division apparently sought too much credit. Dixon to Albright, March 7, 1929.\n\n8. Ben H. Thompson, \"George M. Wright, 1904-1936,\" George Wright Forum (Summer 1981), 1-2; Horace M.

It was not mentioned in a list of such reserves compiled in 1942; see Charles Kendeigh, \"Research Areas in the National Parks,\" Ecology 23 (January 1942), 236-238. And the natural resource management office at Death Valley has no record that the canyon ever received this designation. Today the improved and maintained dirt road up Titus Canyon is probably the most popular and heavily traveled four-wheel-drive road in the park. But a current bighorn management plan calls for closing the Titus Canyon Road during the hot season so that bighorn will have undisturbed access to the spring.

The idea of the Tioga Road as a convenient means of crossing the mountains had also received support from a special executive committee of the Sierra Club, which studied the proposal in 1934. The committee reported that \"the function of the Tioga Road must be not only to enable travelers to reach the Tuolumne Meadows and the eastern portion of the park readily and with comfort, but also to care for those who desire to use this highway as a trans-Sierra road.\" See \"Relocation of Tioga Road: Report of the Executive Committee of the Sierra Club on the Proposed Relocation of the Tioga Road, Yosemite National Park,\" Sierra Club Bulletin 19, no. 3 (1934), 88.\n\n39.

Related to this issue are Vint's earlier comments about the Yosemite concessionaire's proposal for a \"ropeway\" (or tram) to be built to take visitors from the valley floor to Glacier Point. An extended debate in the early 1930s focused mainly on how much the ropeway would intrude on park scenery, rather than on its potential impact on natural resources per se. Vint summed up his comments on the ropeway by noting the acceptability of roads as an alternative: \"Roads have precedents in national parks while ropeways do not.\" Roads would \"not be a new type of development. We know something of the effect of roads and can predict or visualize the result more easily.\" To Vint, the ropeway was a mechanical intrusion, different from that generally accepted in national parks. Given Vint's and the park superintendent's opposition to the ropeway proposal, a road was built, but not a ropeway. See Thomas C. Vint to the Director, November 21, 1930, Entry 17, RG79.

The Park Service itself would acknowledge in 1963 that the reserves were \"dormant\" and that many of the areas had \"remained 'on the shelf,' awaiting a more favorable period for their utilization.\" This statement came at the very time Park Service leaders were withholding genuine support for the proposed Wilderness Act because they did not want restrictions placed on their administrative discretion to control national park backcountry.
