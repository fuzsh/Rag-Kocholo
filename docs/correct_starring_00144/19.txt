Edward Scissorhands is an American feature film of the dark fantasy and romance genres. It was directed by Tim Burton and written by Burton and Caroline Thompson. It was produced by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and released theatrically in the United States on December 14th, 1990. The movie stars Johnny Depp as the titular Edward Scissorhands - an artificial human created by an aging inventor who has scissors for hands. Left behind after the inventor dies, the social misfit is adopted by the Boggs family, which consists of Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs, played by Dianne Wiest, her husband Bill Boggs, played by Alan Arkin and their children, Kim and Kevin Boggs, played by Winona Ryder and Robert Oliveri respectively. Edward Scissorhands strikes up a romantic attachment to Kim, much to the resentment of Kim's bullying boyfriend Jim, played by Anthony Michael Hall.
