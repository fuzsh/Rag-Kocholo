It was directed by Tim Burton and written by Burton and Caroline Thompson. It was produced by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and released theatrically in the United States on December 14th, 1990. The movie stars Johnny Depp as the titular Edward Scissorhands - an artificial human created by an aging inventor who has scissors for hands. Left behind after the inventor dies, the social misfit is adopted by the Boggs family, which consists of Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs, played by Dianne Wiest, her husband Bill Boggs, played by Alan Arkin and their children, Kim and Kevin Boggs, played by Winona Ryder and Robert Oliveri respectively. Edward Scissorhands strikes up a romantic attachment to Kim, much to the resentment of Kim's bullying boyfriend Jim, played by Anthony Michael Hall.\n\nPlot[]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nCharacters\n\nEdward Scissorhands\n\nKim Boggs\n\nPeg Boggs\n\nJim\n\nJoyce\n\nKevin Boggs\n\nHelen\n\nMarge\n\nOfficer Allen\n\nEmseralda\n\nBill Boggs\n\nThe Inventor\n\nTinka\n\nCissy\n\nGeorge\n\nSuzanne\n\nMax\n\nLocations\n\nItems\n\nCrucifix\n\nScissors\n\nRanks & titles\n\nOfficer\n\nVocations\n\nInventor\n\nNews broadcaster\n\nPolice officer\n\nPsychiatrist\n\nReporter\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n1990s\n\n1990\n\nArtificial human\n\nCastle\n\nChristmas\n\nCorpse\n\nDisfigurement\n\nDogs\n\nLaboratory\n\nNeighborhood\n\nScientific experimentation\n\nSmoking\n\nTopiary\n\nCast[]\n\nActor Role Johnny Depp Edward Scissorhands Winona Ryder Kim Boggs Dianne Wiest Peg Boggs Anthony Michael Hall Jim Kathy Baker Joyce Robert Oliveri Kevin Boggs Conchata Ferrell Helen Caroline Aaron Marge Dick Anthony Williams Officer Allen O-Lan Jones Esmeralda Vincent Price The Inventor Alan Arkin Bill Boggs Susan Blommaert Tinka Linda Perri Cissy John Davidson Host-TV Biff Yeager George Marti Greenberg Suzanne Bryan Larkin Max John McMahon Denny Victoria Price TV newswoman Stuart Lancaster Retired man Gina Gallagher Granddaughter Aaron Lustig Psychologist Alan Fudge Loan officer Steven Brill Dishwasher man Peter Palmer Editor Marc Macaulay Reporter Carmen J.
