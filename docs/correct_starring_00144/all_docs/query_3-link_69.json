        "text": "The inspiration for Edward Scissorhands goes back to Tim Burton’s childhood in suburban Burbank. When he was growing up he found the tendency for the people around him to live life on the surface unsettling and alienating. Because everyone was so concerned about how things looked on the surface, it was very difficult for anyone to be different. Burton’s struggle to deal with this world of conformity was the inspiration for Edward Scissorhands. He says of this character:\n\nThe idea actually came from a drawing I did a long time ago. It was just an image that I liked. It came subconsciously and was linked to a character who wants to touch but can’t, who was both creative and destructive. … It was the feeling that your image and how people perceive you are at odds with what is inside you.\n\nEdward Scissorhands is Tim Burton’s most autobiographical film but most of his films feature characters who are outsiders. Burton uses filmmaking as a means of communicating all the feelings that used to be hidden inside him.\n\nWant to know more about Burton and his filmography? Watch this short video essay on his career.\n\nThe special effects and make-up artist, Stan Winston, who worked on Edward Scissorhands was only able to understand what Burton was trying to achieve when he realised the film was a fairy tale. Up until that point, he had been trying to use logic to understand the story.\n\nFairy tales are used to teach life lessons and values. Fairy Tales are also about magic and transformation."
