        "text": "It's been 25 years since Edward Scissorhands first shuffled across our screens. 25 years since it broke our little hearts. 25 years since we wondered why everyone went about ignoring the haunted house at the end of the pastel street.\n\nTo celebrate one of Johnny Depp's finest performances (how we yearn for those days), here are 25 facts you probably never knew about the movie:\n\n1. Soft spoken Edward says only 169 words throughout the entire film.\n\n2. The Cure's Robert Smith was not only Edward's hair inspiration but was also invited to create the soundtrack. He was busy recording his 1989 album Disintegration at the time, so the job went to Danny Elfman, who has since scored all but two of Burton's studio films (that's Ed Wood and Sweeney Todd, by the way).\n\n3. Director Tim Burton's hero Vincent Price was intended to have a bigger role as The Inventor, but his emphysema and Parkinson's meant that the part had to be cut significantly.\n\nHe would make only one more on-screen appearance, playing opposite Eric Stoltz, Jennifer Connelly and Dermot Mulroney in the 1992 TV movie The Heart of Justice.\n\n4. In the scene where The Inventor is reading an unfinished Edward an excerpt from the poetry book, the page he reads off of clearly had no text written or printed on it.\n\n5. Burton credits Dianne Wiest (who played Kim's mother, Peg) with getting the film moving after giving it \"her stamp of approval\" by being the first actor to sign up to the project.\n\n6. The boy jumping onto the Slip & Slide as Edward and Peg Boggs drive through town early in the film was Nick Carter of Backstreet Boys fame.\n\n7. Gary Oldman, Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Jim Carrey, William Hurt and Robert Downey Jr were all considered for the film. Cruise was a favourite of the studio, but didn't like the bittersweet ending. Writer Caroline Thompson wanted John Cusack for the role.\n\n8. Michael Jackson repeatedly lobbied for the starring role, but Burton ignored his calls. We're ok with that.\n\n9. Drew Barrymore was considered for the role of Kim Boggs, and Thompson was keen for Laura Dern to take the role.\n\n10. The first draft of the Edward Scissorhands script was written as a musical.\n\n11. Winona Ryder dropped out of The Godfather: Part III to appear in the film, paving the way for Sofia Coppola's \"memorable\" performance as Ryder's replacement.\n\n12. Edward's character (and name) originated with a drawing Burton did as a disaffected teenager in Burbank, although when Thompson came to flesh out the idea, she took inspiration from an amiable dog she had once owned. She has a thing for animals, and went on to write the scripts for Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey and Black Beauty.\n\n13. Thompson also credits her mother for inspiring Peg Boggs. \"I don't think the story would have had the shape it did if my mother hadn't been prone to bringing strangers home to live with us,\" she told Buzzfeed. \"It didn't seem unusual to me that [Peg] would say, 'I'm taking you home!' That's exactly what my mother would have done.\"\n\n14. The film's iconic topiary weren't real. They were made from welded steel armature wrapped with chicken wire and artificial greens, which were light enough to pick up and move around.\n\n15. As fanatical Christian neighbour Esmerelda, actress O-Lan Jones not only played the organ on-screen herself, but also arranged the music.\n\n16. According to Burton, Johnny Depp's costume was made from latex, leather, tape and bits of an old sofa. The actor refused any cooling agent, despite the Florida sun, and during the scene when Edward runs back to his home he collapsed from heat exhaustion.\n\n17. The town of Lutz, east of Tampa, Florida, was chosen as a stand-in for Burton's hometown of Burbank. Edward Scissorhands was shot in a real neighbourhood, with 50 houses rented and painted while the residents were temporarily relocated to a nearby motel.\n\n18. After twenty or so takes of the scene in which the Boggs' neighbours feed Edward giant spoons of their home cooking, Depp was violently sick.\n\n19. The Edward Scissorhands look was a real commitment for Depp. For four months he spent two hours in make-up, 45 minutes being sewn into his costume and a further hour with the hairdresser every day.\n\n20. Depp was able to take his scissor hands home to practice with ahead of shooting. Those hands were created by make-up/effects man Stan Winston of The Thing, Jurassic Park and Batman Returns fame.\n\n21. Burton told Conan O'Brien that he finally knew he had \"made it\" as a director when he heard about Edward Penishands, the porn spoof of Edward Scissorhands. That said, he was disappointed each hand in said film featured only one penis and not five.\n\n22. This was Depp and Burton's first collaboration. 2012's Dark Shadows is their latest, the eighth so far.\n\n23. Edward Scissorhands only came about because Burton and Thompson were both represented by the same agency, and no one knew what to do with them.\n\n24. Thompson dated \"a very famous mime in Washington\" (her words) who her friends and family wrongly assumed was the inspiration for Edward."
