        "text": "Trick or treat! Lock your doors and board up your windows – it’s time to grab some candy and settle in for a sensationally spooky ceremony of cinema…\n\nCorey Hogan\n\nBoo! Just kidding. But seriously, it’s that time of year again – Halloween, a holiday of Gaelic, Welsh and Christian origin and influence. Originally dedicated to remembering the dead; the holiday has evolved to encompass all things nerve-shredding, blood-curdling, bone-chilling and downright terrifying.\n\nHolidays are always thematically rich, thus, much like Christmas, the spooky season has a way of inspiring filmmakers to craft twisted, artistic and often brilliantly imaginative stories; some of which have cemented themselves into pop culture legend and are now essential annual viewing. After a lengthy binge-watch, I settled on five that best capture the wicked spirit of the year’s freakiest festivity.\n\n1. Trick ‘r Treat (2007)\n\nDirector: Michael Dougherty\n\nStarring: Anna Paquin, Brian Cox & Dylan Baker\n\nWhile not a particularly amazing film, Trick ‘r Treat earns a spot for its original narrative inventiveness and sheer atmosphere – you’d be hard pressed to find a film overflowing with Halloween decadence more than Michael Dougherty’s debut horror anthology. Set amidst a typically American neighbourhood on All Hallow’s Eve, it intertwines four genre-specific stories – Dylan Baker’s school principal reveals his child-killing tendencies, Anna Paquin’s self-conscious virgin is stalked by a vampire (again), Brian Cox’s holiday-hating shut-in is haunted in an other-worldly home invasion, and four curious kids uncover the mystery surrounding a school bus massacre taking place thirty years ago that very night. Though a little too comical and OTT to be taken seriously or truly terrify, Trick ‘r Treat is an entertaining blend of horror sub-genres that makes for ideal Halloween party viewing.\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMoiNyyXSwU\n\n4. To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)\n\nDirector: Robert Mulligan\n\nStarring: Gregory Peck, Robert Duvall & Frank Overton\n\nA slightly unconventional pick on an otherwise spooky list – Robert Mulligan’s adaptation of Harper Lee’s ground-breaking novel is, on the surface, a courtroom drama for the most part. Admittedly, only a small part around the end of the film actually takes place on Halloween, but there are countless underlying horrors surrounding the town of Maycomb, Alabama that make this endearing classic too rich to exclude.\n\nEvents unfold through the eyes of the Finch children in the early 1930’s, as their father Atticus (Gregory Peck), a town lawyer, is appointed to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman, much to the outrage of the racist locals. The exposure to aggravation, hatred and evil that cause a loss of innocence in the children, as well as the mystery besieging the reclusive Arthur “Boo” Radley (Robert Duvall) create an unnerving tone throughout; though its ultimately uplifting messages of acceptance and speaking out against prejudice still resonate strongly today, and cement its position among cinema’s finest. Plus, Scout Finch’s ‘Ham’ costume is one for the ages.\n\nHalloween in Maycomb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FROgIia2cb8\n\n3. The Tim Burton Theory: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), Corpse Bride (2005) & Frankenweenie (2012)\n\nDirector: Henry Selick, Tim Burton & Mike Johnson\n\nStarring: Chris Sarandon, Johnny Depp & Winona Ryder\n\nIt may be cheating to include three films in one spot, but Tim Burton’s trio of gothic, Halloween-themed stop-motion animated features go hand in hand as frightful fun for the whole family – albeit, probably a little too dark for younger children. Incredibly detailed hand-crafted figures and sets are brought to life (and death) by Burton’s twisted storytelling and Danny Elfman’s madcap scores; though perhaps most interesting is the popular theory connecting each film (and other Burton originals, including Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands) via their main character and their pet dogs.\n\nVictor, the young boy who reanimates his deceased dog in Frankenweenie, is the younger version of Victor from Corpse Bride (who reunites with his dog in the Land of the Dead), who eventually passes away and becomes Jack Skellington of The Nightmare Before Christmas (now the owner of a ghostly canine). There are, of course, numerous holes that prevent this from becoming much more than a theory, but it does add an extra level of intrigue to some sumptuously eerie animations.\n\nThe Tim Burton Theory: http://screennamemissing.tumblr.com/post/70270352326/all-of-tim-burtons-original-films-are-connected\n\n2. Donnie Darko (2001)\n\nDirector: Richard Kelly\n\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone & Drew Barrymore\n\nBrilliant and complex, Richard Kelly’s mind-bending masterpiece works on every level it is brought to – deeply unnerving supernatural horror, coming-of-age high school tale, pitch-black family comedy, intricately philosophical time travel puzzle, bleak apocalyptic thriller – Donnie Darko has enough substance to fill multiple movies, and appeal for every generation of viewers. On October 2, 1988, Jake Gyllenhaal’s troubled teen is warned by the elusive Frank (cinema’s most iconic bunny) that the world will end in roughly 28 days. With its sinister atmosphere, fully realised characters, fascinating story and superb soundtrack and score, Donnie Darko is a cult classic and Halloween staple. The famous Director’s Cut is essential to understanding what exactly is going on, but the theatrical version remains ideal for its purely genius ambiguity.\n\nThe Halloween Party (“Love Will Tear Us Apart”): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ3819f5kS8\n\n1. Halloween (1978)\n\nDirector: John Carpenter\n\nStarring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence & Tony Moran\n\nCould it really have been anything else? So prominent it was allegedly responsible for the decline in use, and eventual removal of the apostrophe from the word Hallowe’en, John Carpenter’s magnum opus is the original slasher flick (save maybe Psycho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). The deceptively simplistic plot finds Jamie Lee Curtis’ innocent teen stalked by an insane asylum escapee who returns to his home town on Halloween with little motive other than a significant blood thirst. A monumental mask, screeching score and influx of the “scream queen” formed a blueprint for future horror filmmakers, and today Halloween’s legacy stands tall. Spawning seven sequels and two Rob Zombie re-imaginings, an induction into the National Film Registry for cultural preservation, and endless discussion, analysis and debate amongst film critics and professionals – it remains the ultimate Halloween movie.\n\nClassic trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHuOtLTQ_1I\n\nHappy Halloween from Hooked on Film!\n\nImages courtesy of Buena Vista International, Warner Bros, Universal Pictures, iamag.co, Walt Disney Motion Pictures Studios & Umbrella Entertainment\n\nMuch like how the world unknowingly overlooked artist Margaret Keane, so too has her Tim Burton-led biopic been mostly forgotten by critics and audiences alike.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nReview by Cherie Wheeler\n\nFrom meek and mild, to the mouse that roared – Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) was once the quintessential kept woman of the 1950s; a wife and mother oppressed by fear, and dominated into submission, with no way to independently survive in a society monopolised by men. It is for this reason that she allows her charming, yet egomaniacal husband Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz) to claim her dark and intriguing portraits of children with disproportionately sized, orb-like eyes, as his own. For years Margaret upholds this façade, and becomes a social hermit locked away in her secret studio, meanwhile Walter is catapulted to a height of fame akin to that of Andy Warhol as sales go through the roof.\n\nIt completely and utterly baffles me that this film has endured such apathy from all fronts. Adams may have taken home a Golden Globe, but the Academy chose to omit Big Eyes from every potential category. In Australia it has suffered release delays, as well as poor takings at the box office, and so I am left to ask; what the hell is going on here, as in my opinion, Big Eyes may just be Amy Adams’ greatest film yet.\n\nThe Times (UK) refers to her performance in this film as “quietly extraordinary” and honestly, I could not have expressed it better myself. Her performance may not be an overt explosion of emotion like Lupita Nyong’o’s Oscar-winning, harrowing screams in 12 Years A Slave, but her understated, highly convincing depiction of Margaret Keane is just as, if not more, impressive. Whilst Waltz is credible in his representation of Walter’s demise into a raving lunatic consumed by greed, I was often left to question the character’s motivations, and the scale of his emotional responses, which detracted from the film as a whole.\n\nNot since Ed Wood (1994) has Burton ventured into the biopic domain, having established his idiosyncratic style in fantastical films such as Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Corpse Bride (2005). The subject matter of Big Eyes is relatively ordinary by comparison, but Burton never exploits a scene in order to impose his style; instead he allows the story to speak for itself, then dusts it off with a few eccentric touches to give the film an edge. He creates a very glamorous, almost fairy tale-like version of San Francisco in the late 50s through the use of highly structured, symmetrical shots combined with a rich colour palette, and there is also a cheeky nod to Edward Scissorhands (1990) with a copycat shot that shows a neat, suburban street lined with near identical homes.\n\nFrom the very first shot of the film Burton had me hooked; the camera slowly zooms out of the tear-stained eye of one of Margaret’s most iconic paintings to gradually reveal the entire portrait in a beautiful long take – then BAM – a machine sputters to life, and copy after copy of the same painting is spat out into a nice, fat pile, and instantly, the magic of the moment is lost. I’m not sure if I’m reading meaning that was never intended from Burton, but there seems to be quite a few Hitchcock references in the film; an opening credit sequence commencing on an eye, closely followed by a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge (Vertigo), interjected by Amy Adams with Janet Leigh-like blonde hair, driving down a long highway with a distressed expression (Psycho)… well, intentional or no, I dig it.\n\nMy only real disappointment in this film is the score from long time Burton accomplice Danny Elfman. He employs some funky, percussive jazz chords here and there, but for the most part, his composition is filled with an obvious selection of instruments arranged in a most generic way. Burton clearly wished to avoid burdening the film with his customary flamboyance, most likely due to his personal affection for Margaret’s work (he has previously asked her to recreate Helena Bonham Carter and his Chihuahua on canvas), however I feel that the score was stripped a little too bare.\n\nOverall, I think Big Eyes is a triumph for Burton, and a refreshing departure from his usual work. I have always loved his style, but it was beginning to become a bit monotonous with recent productions such as Dark Shadows failing to bring anything new to the table. Although a little too Hollywoodised at times, I am still inclined to award Big Eyes with four stars, as despite the minimal attention it has been paid, it is certainly worth a watch.\n\nBig Eyes is available in Australian cinemas from Thursday March 19th\n\nImages courtesy of Roadshow Films\n\nIn celebration of Johnny Depp’s birthday this month, I have put together a list of his top 10 films. As most people know, audiences first began to recognise Johnny Depp in the late 1980s when he appeared in television series 21 Jump Street. His first ever role was in the 1984 horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street, but he did not start taking on leading roles in feature films until 1990 when he first collaborated with Tim Burton in Edward Scissorhands. Since then Depp has worked with Burton in seven other films (Ed Wood, Corpse Bride, Sleepy Hollow, Dark Shadows, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd: Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Alice in Wonderland) and has become well-known for bringing weird and whacky characters to life. Now in his fifties, Depp has reached the heights of celebrity and has been nominated for 3 Academy Awards (Pirates of the Caribbean, Finding Neverland, Sweeney Todd), but has never won once. This year he starred in scifi flop Transcendence, but hopefully he will redeem himself in either Into The Woods, which is a musical inspired by the fairytales of the Brothers Grimm, or in mystery thriller London Fields. Both are due to hit cinemas at the end of the year. In addition to this, Depp has another 4 films in the pipeline, including a fifth instalment of Pirates of the Caribbean and a sequel to Alice in Wonderland.\n\nTop 10 Johnny Depp films (in chronological order)\n\n1. Edward Scissorhands. 1990.\n\nDirected by Tim Burton\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest and Alan Arkin\n\nEdward Scissorhands revolves around a young man (Johnny Depp) who was created by an ingenious inventor, but was never finished, and has now been left with scissors for hands. Edward lives a secluded life in a rundown, yet fantastical, medieval home, until he receives a house call from local Avon representative, Peg (Dianne Wiest). Horrified by his living standards, Peg takes Edward home to live with her. Edward receives mixed reactions from Peg’s family and neighbours; some find him to be a disturbing freak of nature, whereas others are fascinated by him. As he struggles to assimilate into the suburban lifestyle, Edward falls in love with Peg’s daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder), who is unsure of her feelings toward this strange, young man.\n\n2. What’s Eating Gilbert Grape? 1993.\n\nDirected by Lasse Hallstrom\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio and Juliette Lewis\n\nBased on the novel by Peter Hedges, What’s Eating Gilbert Grape follows a family that is simply trying to survive in day to day life. Despite his youth, Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) is the major bread winner for the Grape family, and has been dumped with the responsibility of managing the household. Burdened by an obese mother who is unable to control her depression, a mentally disabled little brother (Leonardo DiCaprio), financial hardship and the recent loss of his father, Gilbert has very little time to think about his future or himself. All of this changes, however, when Gilbert meets Becky (Juliette Lewis), a young woman passing through his humdrum town. (Basically the American version of The Black Balloon but made 15 years earlier)\n\n3. Ed Wood. 1994.\n\nDirected by Tim Burton\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Martin Landau and Sarah Jessica Parker\n\nHailed as the “worst director of all time,” Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) was an eccentric filmmaker who produced a variety of low budget films in the 1950s. In this film Burton mostly explores Wood’s relationship with Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), who was most well known for his portrayal of Dracula in the 1930s. By the time Lugosi crosses paths with Wood in the 50s, however, he is a lonely, old man with a drug addiction and next to no prospects in terms of movie work. In Ed Wood the pair bond over their mutual hopelessness, both in life and the film industry, and become determined to produce a film together that will lift them up to the heights of fame and success. Whilst Ed struggles with the trials and tribulations of attempting to make an independent film, he must also deal with his unusual obsession with cross-dressing and angora sweaters, as well as his strained relationship with his girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker).\n\n4. Dead Man. 1995.\n\nDirected by Jim Jarmusch\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Crispin Glover, John Hurt, Robert Mitchum and Gabriel Byrne.\n\nIn the late 19th century, accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) packs up his entire life in Cleveland to go to a small American town in the middle of nowhere for a job opportunity. By the time he arrives, however, the position, which was promised to him, has been filled by another. Before William has the chance to decide whether or not he will stay in this most uncivilised town, he finds himself in a situation where he is forced to murder a man out of self defence. With a price now on his head, William goes on the run with the assistance of a native American called Nobody (Garry Farmer) and becomes an outlaw of the wild west.\n\n5. Donnie Brasco. 1997.\n\nDirected by Mike Newell\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.\n\nDonnie Brasco is based on the life story of Joseph Pistone; a family man who joined the FBI, and agreed to perform some undercover work in order to receive some much needed funds for his wife and children. Joseph assumes the identity of Donnie Brasco, a diamond specialist who deals on the black market, and uses this cover to infiltrate a notorious mafia group in New York. Joseph/Donnie befriends one of the longest standing members of the criminal gang, Lefty Ruggerio (Al Pacino) and uses him as his introduction to the group. As the case unexpectedly drags on and on, and Joseph spends more and more time undercover, Donnie starts to take over his entire personality, and soon neither his wife or the FBI know whose side he is really on.\n\n6. Pirates of the Caribbean. 2003-2011.\n\nDirected by Gore Verbinski\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley\n\nOf the four Pirates of the Caribbean films that have been released, the first in the series, The Curse of the Black Pearl, would certainly have to be the best of the lot. Johnny Depp stars in all of the films as Captain Jack Sparrow, a flamboyant and witty pirate who seeks a life of freedom in which he can pillage, plunder and sail the seven seas on his beloved ship, The Black Pearl. In the first installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, Jack has been betrayed by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leads a crew of cursed men upon Jack’s ship. When Barbossa kidnaps the governor’s daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) in belief that she holds the key to ending his curse, Jack sees an opportunity. He manipulates the humble black smith and lover of Elizabeth, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) as part of an elaborate plan to reclaim The Black Pearl. Despite his hatred of pirates, Will cooperates with Jack as he wishes to rescue his precious Elizabeth, but little does he know of Jack’s true motives.\n\n7. Once Upon A Time in Mexico. 2003\n\nDirected by Robert Rodriguez\n\nStarring: Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp and Willem Dafoe\n\nIn the third and final film in Robert Rodriguez’s Mexico trilogy, Johnny Depp plays a supporting role as corrupt CIA Agent Sheldon Sands. Sands recruits the protagonist of the series, El Mariarchi (Antonio Banderas), to kill Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo (Willem Dafoe) and El simultaneously seeks revenge on a Mexican general for the death of his beloved Carolina (Salema Hayek). Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes and Danny Trejo also feature in this bloody action/thriller.\n\n8. Secret Window. 2004.\n\nDirected by David Koepp\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp and John Turturro\n\nJohnny Depp plays Mort Rainey, a famous author of mystery novels who is going through a messy divorce, and is consequently suffering from a serious case of writer’s block. Mort locks himself up in his cabin in the woods, determined to overcome his mental block, but all of his attempts to free his mind backfire. Soon his imagination starts to take over to the point where he cannot tell what is reality versus what is fantasy. On top of all of this, an intimidating Texan man who calls himself John Shooter (John Turturro), is claiming that Mort has plagiarised his life’s work from him. John demands that Mort rectify the situation, but of course Mort is completely baffled by his accusations. It is not long before John takes to unsettling forms of violence in order to get what he wants from Mort.\n\n9. Finding Neverland. 2004.\n\nDirected by Marc Foster\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet\n\nJohnny Depp’s Scottish accent is flawless in this portrayal of the life of Peter Pan creator J M Barie. The film is set in 1903 during the year in which Barie came up with the concept of Neverland and wrote the stage play for Peter Pan. At the time Barie was struggling to maintain his reputation for being an extraordinarily talented playwright following a production which received dismal reviews. His image was further tainted when he became acquainted with widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four sons. He gradually began to spend more time with the Davies family than his own wife, becoming both a father figure and playmate to the Davies boys. The family became Barie’s inspiration for the story of Peter Pan, particularly the youngest son, Peter Llewlyn Davies, who has experienced difficulties in enjoying his childhood since the death of his father.\n\n10. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nDirected by Tim Burton\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman\n\nDespite the limited singing abilities of the majority of the cast members, this sinister musical is a must-see. Based on the original Broadway production, the film follows the character of Benjamin Barker who returns to London after fifteen years in exile in order to seek revenge on Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who is responsible for stealing Barker’s wife and framing Barker for a crime he did not commit. Barker opens a barber shop, which he uses as a front for the many murders he commits on his pathway to revenge, and assumes the identity of “Sweeney Todd”. He finds an accomplice in Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who sells meat pies below his barber shop and assists him in hiding the evidence of his killings.\n\nSpecial Mentions:\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas. 1998\n\nBlow. 2001.\n\nThe Libertine. 2004.\n\nPublic Enemies. 2009.\n\nImages courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, Madman Entertainment, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Roadshow Entertainment, Buena Vista International, Sony Pictures, Miramax & Warner Bros"
