        "text": "Edward Scissorhands, a suburban fantasy film about a Pinocchio-like man who has shears of metal for fingers, officially began three months of production Thursday with the arrival of its stars and director. The film, scheduled for Christmas release, is being directed by Tim Burton, who made Batman and Beetlejuice. Edward Scissorhands, a 20th Century Fox production, stars Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker and Academy Award-nominee Diane Wiest.\n\nThe majority of the film will be shot in Pasco and Hillsborough counties, with about two weeks of work at Universal Studios in Orlando. Filming is expected to be completed June 14. The set is closed to the public and media. Burton and his troupe discussed their movie at a news conference Thursday at Saddlebrook Resort and Conference Center.\n\n\"It comes from my love of fairy tales and folk tales. I'm trying to make the link between that (fairy tales) and real life a little clearer,\" said the director whose inventiveness has won high praise.\n\nBurton would not disclose the film's budget except to say, \"It'll be less than Batman.\" The top-grossing movie last year, Batman cost $35-million to make and took in more than $240-million.\n\nBurton, dressed in a black T-shirt and black leather jacket, said Edward Scissorhands would be a departure from his earlier films, which have relied on special effects and radiantly pretty, bizarre settings. \"It's a new step for me. I'm going for a little more substance than I've had in my films.\"\n\nDepp, the star of television's 21 Jump Street and the new John Waters movie Cry-Baby, will play Edward Scissorhands. Ryder, Depp's fiancee, plays Depp's romantic interest in the movie. Ryder appeared in Heathers and Burton's Beetlejuice.\n\nWiest, who plays Ryder's mother, said she was impressed with the screenplay but there was another lure. \"I had never played an Avon lady before,\" she said. Wiest's character discovers Edward Scissorhands while selling cosmetics door-to-door.\n\nShooting sites for Edward Scissorhands are secret. Most will be in suburban and rural areas near Tampa.\n\nA few miles from Saddlebrook, film construction crews have erected the \"entrance\" to a residential subdivision called \"Castlegate.\" They have painted several homes blue, yellow, rose and green in the Carpenter's Run subdivision in Land O'Lakes. As many as 40 houses might be painted and their roofs sprayed with glitter to portray the suburban tract where Ryder, Wiest and father Alan Arkin live."
