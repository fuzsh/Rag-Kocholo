        "text": "Major Spoilers ahead.\n\nAs the month celebrating love and romance comes to an end, I realize I have yet to write about my personal favorite movie. Even casual friends and acquaintances who know me will tell you, if asked, Edward Scissorhands is, always has been, probably will be my favorite movie for life. Why? It’s not an epic like Lawrence of Arabia or Star Wars, sharp as a tack writing like Casablanca, an adaptation of a personal and profound drama like Joy Luck Club or RainMan. It actually has quite a few flaws. There are glaring plot holes, continuity errors, editing errors that become more easy to spot the older you get, or in my case, after about the hundredth time watching. It’s also not exactly the most original adaptation of a mash up between Phantom of The Opera and Frankenstein in suburbia. It has a pretty unclear timeline, somewhere between the 70’s in aesthetics, art design and costuming but very nineties in it’s references, technology, and attitudes from the younger cast. Why is this my favorite film? Perhaps for a simple reason. Throughout my life, it keeps finding me. Throughout my life I have had other films and fandoms I’ve been obsessed with and adored, Disney movies, sci-fi, historical dramas, on and on. Still, even at times I shelved Edward in the back of my mind, he never completely left my consciousness.\n\nThe movie came out in December 1990. I was only about 3 going on four. How can I possibly remember going to see this in theaters? It’s a faint memory. Seeing a film with such dark themes does no leave you easily, (Dad was an artist who didn’t believe in censorship) and two, I have a vivid memory of going into a video store that used to be in a strip mall on Baseline and Rural in Tempe, seeing the gigantic poster of the film and being disappointed when Dad explained the movie was not out on video yet. A very nice blonde lady at the register showed me they were actually working on building and casing the new tapes soon, the man filling in the cassettes shooting a kind smile at me. Knowing the movie would be out soon comforted me.\n\nWe were allowed to rent a good number of movies but had to really work hard to earn a copy of a movie to own. Back then, a video tape was practically your big birthday or Christmas gift, so renting was one of our only options. The one way we could watch Edward frequently was a surprisingly high number of times it was rerun on television. Anytime it was on for the next probably decade, I would drop whatever I was doing to watch it, even if there was as little as 10 minutes left. It would then haunt me for a good week or so. The score would be stuck in my head, especially “Ice Dance.” I would yearn for a sequel which at least gave Edward a happier ending, friends, a family, even if just one person could keep him company once in a while, like Kim’s granddaughter. This would later come true in a graphic novel series.\n\nStill, other movies, plays, series, events in my life would occur that took my interests into different eras. I tried being a complete “not like other girls” type to avoid being the ditzy stuck up cheerleader teen who Kim is at the beginning and doesn’t see or appreciate until those like Edward until too late. This is why Kim is one of my all time favorite movie heroines. She starts off as your basic All-American suburban teen. Blonde, beautiful, a cheerleader, clearly popular, teen angst attitude with her family, bubbly with her friends, and dating a jock bad-boy type and turned off by oddball nerds, even when they are genuinely kind. Pretty basic right? However, Johnny Depp’s brilliant wordless acting and Winona’s subtle and underrated arc show Kim, like Edward, is much more than meets the eye. From the moment Edward gazes wide eyed, beaming at Kim’s photos on the mantle, we see a man whose innocence allows him to see not just a beautiful face, but can sense he sees the light in her waiting to brighten. From the way the photos move from a princess like girl, to playful and innocent, to angelic, we see what Edward in his innocence sees, the good in others. This however turns out to be part of his downfall as well. Unaware of the dark side of the world he has just entered itself, he is unaware of Kim’s surroundings. He sees her potential, not yet who she is fully.\n\nThat is the plight of nearly all of the main characters. Everyone either turns out they have a darkness in themselves or their lives they are naive about and need to see. Perhaps that is why most of the neighborhood is at first welcoming to Edward. He represents a mystery, uniqueness, darkness, even truth missing in their lives. Kim has a reverse journey with Edward. She at first is repelled by him for obvious reasons and a first meeting that goes horribly wrong. There is still a running meme of why on Earth the family thought putting Edward in a room with a waterbed was a good idea. That is one of the obvious plot devices for a joke I agree is fair. Kim goes from being uncomfortable around this “weirdo” to seeing him for what he truly is when everyone else abandons him. To be fair, her being the one who asked Edward to risk his life and reputation for her against her better judgement is her greatest mistake, even a bit cruel, but does she not pay for it in the end? Just when she realizes what a kind, protective, amazing person he is, she has to live with loosing him and keeping his life a secret, even from her family until her last days.\n\nWinona Ryder was mainly known as Lydia up until this point. For her to play a character who she described as the type who “bullied” her in school, she did a remarkable job of making the audience feel compassion for a character who could have been quite one-dimensional. She breathed life into Kim. You believe as soon as she comes on screen she is every bit as much a shallow/hormonal/normal teen as she appears and wanting nothing to do with Edward. No easy task considering she and Johnny were dating at the time. You also believe her shifting feelings for him that feels absolutely earned rather then rushed or forced. A few quick awkward glances at first between them, the way realization of his feelings dawns on her when he’s on TV, her genuine concern for him when he’s arrested, her shock when she realizes how far he actually went for her, to her fierce life risking protection of him. It’s a natural and subtle stream of acting that proves quality acting is about what you do with the brief time you have. She makes every second count.\n\nIf Kim’s journey is about ascension and growth into every bit the loving innocent Edward believed she was, the opposite is true for her increasingly abusive boyfriend, Jim. At first Jim is also the All-American ideal jock, meets bad boy with a heart of gold charming macho man. The first red flag we see in Jim is his quick backstory of a neglected/spoiled/son of an overly strict suburbanite Dad. He also tends to have a dark sense of humor where instead of protective mode, he laughs at others (even his girlfriends) dinner humiliation, and Edward getting shocked on live TV. The costuming of the Jim is also fascinating. As iconic as Edward’s leather and buckle costume is, the costuming of each character says a great deal. Jim is often in black leather attire at night with Kim and their friends. During the day, especially with Kim’s family, he is very much dressed “the boy next door”, white collar shirts, pastels etc. Slowly his colors begin to turn a sickly green and finally a garish black and yellow stripes (reminiscent of Freddy Kreuger) with a leather jacket embroidered “Dad, Mom” literally revealing the true colors of a personality now fully separated.\n\nThe costuming of each character seems to reveal their change and journeys. Kim goes from the same pastels and colors as most of the other suburbanites in her neighborhood, perfectly blended in. She’s even more revealing with her ruffly crop tops and skirts, even much more of a “little girl,” very much the type Jim would find appealing and easy to control. As she grows, her clothes become more grown up, more natural in tone and color, more elegant and even tom boyish then revealing. By the end, while everyone is in gratuitous, crayon level pastels, she is literally the only character in an angelic white.\n\nFor most of the film, Edward was basically disguised as a white and grey suburbanite. By the end he too sheds this facade. The Yin to Kim’s yang, he has gone back to himself, and a darker but sadly more aware version of himself, done and disillusioned with the idea of “fitting in.” Something I hadn’t noticed until the 2015 rerelease on blu-ray for it’s 25th anniversary was Edward has the inventors military medal on his left shoulder, also bearing what looks to be a family crest. Showing the inventor too saw a certain amount of nobility in Edward.\n\nThis also reveals the inventor was in some kind of war. Based on Vincent Price’s costuming, the look of the mansion, and Edward’s “immortality,” it’s possible this could have been as early as World War I. The inventor probably saw horrors few have seen in their lifetime. The inventor also seems like a mad scientist, genius recluse type. Why did he leave no one else knowledge of himself or Edward? Why did he have no other neighbors, friends, or family? It’s safe to interpret the inventor was a passionate but very bitter and disconnected man, a text book curmudgeon. Given the neighborhood he lives near by, is he entirely blameless? He could probably see the writing on the wall of a cookie cutter, materialistic, plastic world on the horizon and wanted to create someone like Edward to preserve some semblance of innocence, creativity, chivalry, depth, and nobility disappearing in his eyes. Like many geniuses, they are more focused on improving humanity through creativity than day to day connection, feeling disillusioned or heartbroken by it.\n\nThe other option to deal with this reality is the Boggs family. They are one of the few families in the neighborhood who try to be genuine and kind, but they too realize Edward does not fit in with them. Peg who welcomed him into their home realizes she was naive and quick to act kind rather then be kind. She admits she didn’t pause to think just how much a world like theirs would never fully embrace someone as offbeat, dark, and honest as Edward. Would Edward have fit in had he been brought in with more gradual care? Who knows. Perhaps not, given the times. Her husband Bill (beautifully played by the late-great Alan Arkin) is also well meaning, wants a simple quiet life of a nice house, barbecues, and doles out bits of wisdom. He is also at times oblivious to the dark news around him (e.g. doesn’t blink when Edward reveals he was “assaulted” by their neighbor). He has a very bored and passive air about him a great deal of the time, but more present when the stakes are high. He is very old school “either/or” by the book on ethics guy, not really circumstantial when it comes to doing the right thing. This may seem harsh on his character, but this may also come from a very defeatist attitude about his own life. As simple and pleasant as it appears, perhaps this is his way of dealing with the dark side of suburban life, that boredom and plasticity may be the price you pay for peace. What makes the Boggs family different is they are aware of and accept this, rather sadly by the end.\n\nThis is Edward’s arc. From the moment Edward steps into the Boggs living room, we notice something Edward doesn’t. He breaks out into a big childlike smile as he walks into one the most brightly lit and cleanest rooms he’s probably ever seen. What he doesn’t see that we the audience do, and are told by a cheeky Danny Elfman music cue, is this is one of the most sterile, lifeless, plain living rooms ever created, but is seen as ideal in that time. Edward sees this as a palace of love, warmth, and color. Edward’s journey brings up an age old question, what is the difference between innocent and naive? As precious as innocence itself is, it is also often used interchangeably and mistakenly with naive, or even foolish.\n\nEdward proves to Kim, and us the audience, by the end that he may have been uneducated, as hilariously over explained by the psychiatrist when Edward is arrested, but he is not naive to who people are. He senses right away Esmeralda is a judgmental and dogmatic bully. He is visibly uncomfortable with Joyce trying to seduce him without his consent, and knows the best course of action is to leave. He knows Jim taunts him about his feelings for Kim. He knew that Kim asked him to break into Jim’s house. He also knows there is more to Kim than a typical teen.\n\nWhen pushed to his limit, he goes on the offensive and acts out his rage, even if unwisely. The psychiatrist may over explain his circumstances (a parody/homage of the psychiatrist from Psycho explaining Norman Bates to the characters and the audience), but he is not wrong. Edward has not been completely without guidance, but very much so. He hasn’t been taught about our “reality” with all of its assumptions, gossip culture, boredom, cognitive laziness, exaggerations, deceptions, lies, moral ambiguity, shallowness, lack of respect for privacy and, commodifications of people and their talents, morbid curiosities until no longer “useful.” This is summed up in how overly complicated we make the world when it really could be quite simple. Despite all of this, the psychiatrist, when asked by the police man, insists Edward will be fine. Something that sort of turns out to be true. In the end, Edward is “fine” in the most basic sense.\n\nThis brings me to the minor characters. Even they have their moments to shine. The Policeman who secretly spares Edward is an underrated gem of a character. He turns out to be as compassionate as the Boggs family towards Edward. He offers him some comforting words as he leaves the prison, sharing his concern for him and encouraging him to be careful. When cornering Edward, he secretly fires his weapon into the air instead of at him. He tries to turn the crowd away without lying to them. This is something of a trope in some horror films, especially Stephen King stories, where a black character catches on more quickly to what’s going on and, as a result, is more protective of the outcast monster. This is also seen in Joker where black characters are among the few to show Arthur moments of compassion. I will delve into that for the blog on that one. Minorities know full well how painful it feels to be “other’d” and outcast. We know what it’s like to when seeing someone bullied or misunderstood.\n\nWhile the film has editing and continuity flaws, there is not a character or story beat/moment wasted. Every character with a line, in the background, all turns out to have a pay off. There are no lulls or fillers of any kind. The set up of a comic tone in the beginning turns out to show it’s dramatic and dark side by the end. The neighbors once exciting and playful gossip is revealed to be the harmful, time filling, lie spreading it truly is. The whimsical, topiary are gigantic, sad, and frightening reminder of the artist who has fallen from grace due to false accusations and self-serving fair weather friends and fans, often the story of countless artists in today’s world.\n\nThis is perhaps why the three leads Johnny, Winona, and Anthony all were playing against the types of roles they were known for at the time. Johnny was eager to break out of his stereotypical 80’s teen heartthrob roles. Winona Ryder was the “not like other girls” underdog outcast goth type, who wanted to show she had range. Anthony Michael Hall was the scrawny, unpopular nerd from 16 Candles and The Breakfast Club. Here he showed he could play the bad guy bully, often the most cruel to those who remind them of themselves. Perhaps Jim was very much a nerdy kid who bulked up as a way to prove himself and get a girl like Kim without dealing with his insecurity. He takes it out on Edward, the very person who reminds him of what he probably can’t face in himself, and ends up destroying him in the end.\n\nTim Burton’s free thinking is why this is a fairy tale and a personal drama, not bound by the rules of logic, and surprisingly grounded in reality. Even little touches/Easter eggs such as a hard to spot “Bland High” banner above Kim’s mirror shows Tim’s brilliant eye for detail that make movies like this a gift that keeps on giving. Tom Cruise was lobbied for the part of Edward by the studio. His need to know the logistics of Edwards “biology,” and push for a happy ending etc, made Mr. Burton decide he wasn’t right for the role.\n\nThe brilliant feminine touches by well rounded, flawed, imperfect but still admirable female characters is clearly due to Caroline Thompson’s screenwriting and understanding of women (also obvious in Secret Garden, Nightmare Before Christmas, The Addam’s Family). Tim also has consistently shown an admiration and respect for strong female leads who are still a blend of the beautiful, bright, and brave, but have more to learn, are vulnerable, and flawed. This is why he is one of my favorite directors. Lydia, Selena Kyle, Kim, Sally, Wednesday, the real life Margaret Keane from Big Eyes etc. He has a respect for women that doesn’t just make them perfect Mary Sue bad asses, sexualized men in women’s bodies, or “Born Sexy Yesterday” to infantilize and titillate. These characters are real and feminist without sacrificing the flaws and femininity that makes them real.\n\nI’ve had countless dreams of being in an Edward Scissorhands type world where snow is mystical and can cover a whole town with one large block of ice. Wintering is recent term coined by author Katherine May. It focuses on the importance of rest and retreat in hard times. That is perhaps why the snow is such a profound metaphor in the film. The fact that it “never snowed” as Kim shares the story with her granddaughter. The town is constantly in light and color. Even the streetlights in the neighborhood seem to have and oppressive cruelty to them in the night scenes, like an interrogation light, always on, always watching. The town is full of people constantly working, gossiping, gardening, tending to keep up a facade of being busy, to keep this American dream like neighborhood surviving instead of thriving. The bored fill in their spare time getting groomed and styled in absurd ways to feel unique. Some argue Edward’s creations are creepy and weird, but he merely does exactly what is requested of him by the neighbors themselves. This is a reflection of their “creepiness.” Jim Carrey shared recently he believes the word “depressed” truly means “deep rest”, the body’s way of saying let go of or stop trying to hold up an Avatar of what you think you should be, take a deep rest and awaken to a more honest and authentic self.\n\nIt’s when Edward discovers ice sculpting that his creations become truly beautiful. I remember my Mom pointing out how much Edward’s Angel sculpture resembles Kim, something quite easy to see now. His greatest work is entirely his own, inspired by the best of his experiences in suburbia such as children playing, Kim, animals etc and leaving the rest. The snow reminds the town to “winter” in order to find their true selves. The last thing Kim says is “Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.” Something her world would have found foolish, a way to keep in touch with her innocence, is something she remembers to do all her life. Perhaps Edward did at least save Kim from becoming another bored or worse (abused) housewife. Innocence I believe is a combination of Inner Sense. What’s it’s not is childish temper tantrums because of wanting material or toxic positivity. What separates it from naivety is it senses what is going on, good or bad. Those who claim it is naivety are actually afraid of the truth it is there to reveal. This is why the people like Edward are feared. He is honest and revealing about people, good or bad. He is not different for the sake of it, he simply is. Kim perhaps is cold to him at first because she too is resistant of the truth of how bored she already is and wants a more honest, unique, and kind life for herself and her loved ones.\n\nThe “winters” of my life often lead me back to this film. While I yearned for a happy ending for this movie for so long (something the studio wanted as well) I came to accept and love the more honest, bittersweet ending for what it is. Perhaps it inspired more real life happier endings for many like Edward and Kim, myself included. When it comes to our favorite stories, let’s hope we’ll always keep dancing in them, even if that dance changes or slows with age."
