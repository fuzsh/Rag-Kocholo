        "text": "Ready to feel old? Edward Scissorhands is 25.\n\nTim Burton’s wonderful film premiered on December 6, 1990, and has delighted pretty much everyone who’s watched it ever since.\n\nIt’s a simple story beautifully told and speaks to anyone who has ever felt like an outsider – everybody, in other words.\n\nIn Edward Scissorhands (starring Johnny Depp as the title character), Burton completed a remarkable hat-trick of three amazing movies in three years, following up 1988’s Beetlejuice and 1989’s Batman.\n\nMORE : Johnny Depp admits he doesn’t want to win an Oscar. Ever…\n\nHas there been a better three-year director’s streak? Perhaps, but you’d have to go back a long time to find it: Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho – all directed by Alfred Hitchcock – were released in 1958, ’59 and ’60 respectively.\n\nIt’s still Burton’s best film, and the combination of Winona Ryder dancing under falling ice flakes with Danny Elfman’s mesmerising music will always make us cry.\n\nTo celebrate 25 years of weeping in front of Edward Scissorhands, here are 25 facts about the film\n\n1. The original plan was to make Edward Scissorhands a musical. Burton and Depp would later team up on Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007).\n\n2. The film was spawned from a drawing of the character that Burton drew when he was a teenager. The name ‘Edward Scissorhands’ was there with the drawing.\n\n3. Tom Cruise could have been Edward Scissorhands. Studio 20th Century Fox wanted Cruise in the role, and Burton even met with the actor, later saying: ‘He certainly wasn’t my ideal, but I talked to him. He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best.’\n\n4. The character of Edward is based on the dog of the film’s screenwriter, Caroline Thompson.\n\n5. Thompson based the character of Peg Boggs (played by Dianne Wiest), who takes Edward home with her from his mansion on the hill, on her own mother, who often brought home strangers.\n\n6. Edward says 169 words in the entire film.\n\n7. Edward Scissorhands was the first collaboration between Burton and Depp. In total, they have worked together eight times.\n\n8. The decision to use real scissors for Edward’s hands, rather than sharp bits of metal, was made by special effects legend Stan Winston.\n\n9. The haircuts given to the dogs in the movie were real.\n\n10. But the amazing animal-shaped topiary was not real. They were crafted from chicken wire rather than actual cutting, with the greens punched in to fill the shapes.\n\n11. Winona Ryder pulled out of The Godfather: Part III and appeared in Edward Scissorhands instead.\n\n12. Gary Oldman was offered the role of Edward but turned it down. He would play Ryder’s love interest a few years later in Dracula (1992).\n\n13. Edward Scissorhands was filmed in a real neighbourhood in Florida.\n\n14. The film marked the last screen appearance of horror legend Vincent Price.\n\n15. Edward’s haircut is based on Robert Smith’s from The Cure. Burton asked Smith to perform the film’s soundtrack but he declined.\n\n16. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys makes a brief appearance in the film as a boy on a water slide outside a house.\n\n17. The film is based on a 70-page treatment in prose written by Thompson in three weeks.\n\n18. The scene in which Edward bursts the water bed was not in the original script.\n\n19. In Depp’s first film role in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), he was a victim of Freddy Krueger, who also had blades for fingers.\n\n20. Depp and Ryder were a couple during filming. They were engaged for three years before splitting, Depp famously changing his ‘Winona Forever’ tattoo to ‘Wino Forever’.\n\n21. In the scene where Edward runs back to the mansion, Depp collapsed from heat exhaustion because of the high temperatures and his leather outfit. He refused to take the cooling agent offered to the rest of the cast because he wanted to stay in character.\n\n22. 20th Century Fox was anxious that Edward’s appearance might put off moviegoers, so held back imagery until after release.\n\n23. Wiest was the first actor to sign on for the movie, and championed it so much that others followed, something Burton has acknowledged.\n\n24. Depp has reprised his role on one occasion, providing the voice of Edward in an episode of Family Guy in which he appears as a babysitter.\n\n25. Depp has a fossil named after him because of Edward Scissorhands. The Kootenichela deppi, an ancestor of lobsters and scorpions, was named after him in 2013 after its fossil records revealed it had claws that resembled Edward’s scissor hands.\n\nMORE : Twitter comedian is invited on TV to talk about Edward Snowden.
