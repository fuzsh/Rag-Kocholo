        "text": "There’s no movie star in the world as popular and well-known as Tom Cruise. The actor, who just this July entered into his 60s is still able to bag roles in the top movies of Hollywood. His successful and well-met reprisal of Pete “Maverick” Mitchell in the much-awaited Top Gun: Maverick just shows how strong his aura as an A-list actor is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving a reputation for being able to get the best out of his characters in his movies, Cruise is also known for demanding certain standards from any director that plans on recruiting him as the movie’s star cast member. But when he was almost cast for Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands, the actor didn’t get in, and apparently, it’s because of this one hilarious reason.\n\nA Must-Read: “We looked at that over and over, in rushes”: Tom Cruise Still Mesmerized By Henry Cavill’s Arm Loading Scene in Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Cavill Claims it Was a Total Fluke\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere’s Why Tom Cruise Didn’t Get The Edward Scissorhands Role\n\nTom Cruise, despite not saying it, is pretty well known for having acted in movies where he gets to be the face of the movie. While there may be a few exceptions, like his time acting in Tropic Thunder, it’s a prerequisite that the 60-year-old actor demands of directors waiting to line him up.\n\nIt definitely showed that he wanted to maintain that standard for himself even in the late 80s and 90s, back when he was nearing an agreement with Tim Burton to star in his fantasy romance movie Edward Scissorhands.\n\nCaroline Thompson, who worked as a writer in the 1990 movie, revealed that the Collateral star was sort of disqualified from becoming the face of Burton’s movie because the latter felt that Cruise was too inquisitive about a lot of things. Such as the logistics of the story, not to mention that he also wanted a much happier ending for Edward and Kim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated: “He wasn’t three-dimensional”: Top Gun: Maverick Star Glen Powell Initially Refused Playing Hangman, Was Convinced By Tom Cruise For the Role Despite Finding Him Boring\n\nOne of the much more hilarious reasons why Cruise never got into the movie, as Thompson recalls, was also because the former literally asked how Edward goes to the bathroom, or how he eats and drinks!\n\nThe creative differences were pretty large, and Tim Burton just didn’t want an actor that demanded too much and asked too many questions. Thus, as history shows us, Johnny Depp got the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read: “Tom Cruise keeps on ruining our filming”: 69 Year Old TV Legend Jenny Agutter Accuses Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Star of Purposefully Landing His Helicopter on ‘Call the Midwife’ Set\n\nTom Cruise’s Inquisitive Questions Has Twitter Rolling On The Floor\n\nTim Burton’s reasons for omitting Tom Cruise from the lead role in Edward Scissorhands are honestly hilarious, but also fair because actors have to respect the director’s vision.\n\nRelated: “God, he pushed me to do this thing”: Tom Cruise Nearly Got Top Gun: Maverick Star Glen Powell Killed, Forced Him To Go Skydiving Alone After Taunting Him\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn’t news, but it’s too hilarious of a topic to not revisit once in a while for the internet to have a chuckle. The topic went trending once again just earlier today, and it’s got Twitter laughing with its mouth open-\n\nA lot to ask! –\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the standard is today! –\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess Tim Burton forgot to detail the practicality of the suit-\n\nHe’s dedicated!-\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s no doubt that the Mission: Impossible star won’t be too fazed, or regretful, of his decision to demand answers from Burton for that role, he’s literally one of the world’s top movie stars!\n\nSource: Twitter"
