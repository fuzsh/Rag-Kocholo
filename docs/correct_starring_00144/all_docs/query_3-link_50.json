        "text": "Grew up… alone. Edward is the creation of a lone inventor who passed away before completing him. Technically unfinished, Edward does not have normal hands– instead, he is cursed with sharp objects in place of fingers.\n\nLiving… alone in a gothic mansion at the edge of a small town. Too shy to introduce himself to others, Edward has been alone since his inventor passed away. However, when kind Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs discovers him, she decides to try to bring him out of his shell.\n\nVisiting… the Boggs’ family home. The pale, quiet, scissor-handed man baffles the local community, as well as some of the Boggs children he's living with.\n\nProfession… town hedge-trimmer. Despite the many drawbacks of his unique anatomy, Edward has decided to put his talents to good use. The entire neighborhood is impressed with his hedge-sculptures, with one woman even urging Edward to open his own salon.\n\nRelationship Status… infatuated with Peg’s teenage daughter, Kim. At first, Kim is frightened of Edward’s lack of social graces and freakish, sharp hands. As he tries to get closer to her, she does her best to push him away.\n\nChallenge… getting Kim to fall in love with him. Normal hands aren't the only thing that he’s lacking— his soul, too, is incomplete. He sees through Kim’s rebellious insecurity and tries desperately to court her in the only way he knows how: obeying her every wish.\n\nPersonality… shy, doleful, and artistic. A born outsider, Edwards longs for nothing more than to be normal. Despite his strange appearance and perceived misbehavior, he carries a heart of gold. In the words of a psychologist, \"His work—the garden sculptures, hairstyles and so forth—indicate that he’s a highly imaginative… uh… character. It seems clear that his awareness of what we call reality is radically underdeveloped.”"
