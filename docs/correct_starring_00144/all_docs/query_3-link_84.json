        "text": "Tim Burton is one of the most unusual and unique directors of our time. He brings characters to life by putting them in a habitat they don’t belong. His movies “Alice in Wonderland”, “The Corpse Bride”, “Charlie and the chocolate factory”, and “Edward Scissorhands” all demonstrate how one of a kind his movies are. Using cinematic techniques, Tim Burton points out the misfit character and shows how different they are then everyone else. His use of camera angles, lighting, and sound give the viewers a different perspective on the movies, and help pick out the individual character.\n\nThe most appealing films are those that keep audiences guessing, surprise them at the most unexpected times and break conventional film boundaries. Edward Scissorhands (1990) directed by Tim Burton, is a feature film that does exactly that. It blends a fairy tale story with a gothic horror film, to engage the viewer right from beginning until the resolution. It tells the tale of Edward, who was the creation of an inventor who died before he could give Edward proper hands, and was left with scissors as hands. When he was taken from his gothic mansion, into a “normal” suburban community, he was at first welcomed, but then heartbreakingly rejected when things went wrong. The character of the “monster” is an\n\nOne very important editing technique Burton uses in his films is flashbacks. Burton uses flashbacks in order to build structure for the mood and feelings of the audience. An example of a flashback is in the film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Burton uses flashbacks in the beginning of the film in order to educate the viewer about the connection and relations that the Bucket family has had with Wonka and his factory. The flashbacks showed Grandpa Joe working for Wonka before the terrible tragedy that is the closing of the factory. The flashbacks educates you about how Wonka treated his workers, the amazing things he did, and how the factory shut down. After viewing, you start to feel sad for Wanaka because Grandpa Joe described him as a great and marvelous man with incredible ideas and inventions, but jealousy got to the competitors forcing them to steal ideas and inventions Wonka created, forcing him to shut down the factory. Burton also uses flashbacks to build structure for the mood and feelings of the audience in the film Big Fish. He uses flashbacks to give you a glimpse of the relationship Will has with his father. The flash backs told and showed the stories of Edward Bloom and his adventures. They explained all the stories that will was told and gave you a clue on what the relationship between them was like. A lot of what Edward said was true and because of that, the flashbacks make the audience reconsider\n\nEdward Scissorhands, written by Tim Burton, tells the tale of a young man who is lovable, childlike and sensitive, bewildered by the humanity around him, yet is terrifying- someone who has scissors, the deadly weaponry, for hands. Many viewers may read this film as a “Tim Burton” type of fairytale which includes both an alternative aspect and romance. However, through the presentation of mise-en-scene in this film, Burton drives in a much more serious subject of social criticism by establishing two different understandings of life in the movie.\n\nThe film Edward Scissorhands is a contemporary archetype of the gothic genre exploring themes such as unrequited love, social rejection and human creation as defined by Tim Burton. Feature films explore different ideals that can be categorized into different genres that create expectations among audiences about characters, settings, plots and themes. Edward Scisscorhands directed by Tim Burton in the year 1990 is described as both a dark romantic fantasy and a gothic horror film. The film tells a story about Edward Scissorhands, the creation of an elderly inventor who dies before he can give Edward his normal hands in place of his scissor hands. Edward is taken from the mansion he lives in by a suburban family in an attempt to live a\n\nEdward Scissorhands The film that I watched is 'Edward Scissorhands'. Tim Burton produced it in 1990. Johnny Depp plays the main character. Johnny Depp has starred in 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. The main genre of the films Depp has featured in is Neo-Gothic fantasy. In this essay I will be illustrating how Tim Burton, The director, creates sympathy towards Edward and why the community turns against him. The story of the film begins with an inventor who lived in a Gothic mansion on top of a hill. This inventor created an android. This Creature was called Edward Scissorhands because he had temporary hands made from scissors. Unfortunately, the inventor died before he was able to give his Christmas present\n\nIn my essay I am going to reference two films, Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Vincent (1982), directed by Tim Burton. Edward Scissorhands, is Tim Burton’s take on the Frankenstein story. We can clearly see the influences that have appealed to Tim Burton in the classic Frankenstein (1931) was not the character’s monstrousness appeal but the sense of sad sorrow that audiences sympathized to in Boris Karloff’s performance. Whereas in Tim Burton’s vision, we see a “Special” character as the Frankenstein Monster, in the similar way that we call people with disabilities Special. And then we have Vincent, a short stop-motion animation. The short film itself is an entertaining aspect of a suburban boy named Vincent who recites Edgar Ellen Poe and categorizes with Horror film star, Vincent Price. With similarities to Edward Scissorhands, the main character is a chance for Tim Burton to represent himself on the screen as a tortured boy, outsider and artist. I am going to discuss how cultural and psychological concerns are represented through characterization, art direction, cinematography, and sound. I will support my discussion by analyzing a reflection on both the similarities and differences between the two films, and whether a distinctive “Burton” signature (aesthetics, cultural and psychological concerns) is evident.\n\nTim Burton once said, “My parents suffered from that ideal of a perfect nuclear family. They found that a difficult pressure, I think”. Tim Burton is a famous filmmaker who sometimes incorporates his life into his films. Tim was an odd child in that he liked being alone and spending his time in a graveyard. In his childhood, he was the outsider in a “perfect” world. People can judge him on his odd and different childhood. That is what he tries to teach in his films. In both Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Edward Scissorhands, Burton reveals that society wrongly judges those who do not fit in."
