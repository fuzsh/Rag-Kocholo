AboutLilongwe

Lilongwe is the largest city and capital of Malawi; located with the central region of the country. The city is distinctively divided into New town and Old town. The former is made up mainly of offices and hotel; whereas the latter is a typical African town with markets, bus stations, cafes and restaurants (certainly worth a visit).

Also of interest is the Lilongwe Nature Sanctuary which lies between the Old and New towns houses Lilongwe Wildlife Centre; Malawiâ€™s only sanctuary for rescued, orphaned and injured wild animals.
