        "text": "Water For People drills and repairs boreholes and rehabilitates gravity-fed piped water systems to expand water access in Malawi. We support community associations that manage water kiosks and water points, which helps ensure long-term sustainability of water services. We train these associations on topics like maintenance and repair and creating sustainable fees for water service. Water For People also established a mobile mechanics program to help provide timely repairs for water systems. This program has been so successful that it is being replicated across the country.\n\nWater For People is increasing coverage of sanitation services through what’s known as a Community-Led Total Sanitation model. This approach creates demand for better toilets by sharing the dangers of open defecation and encouraging community members to change their behavior. Because we approach sanitation services through a market-based approach, we also work to make sure business environments are supportive to sanitation entrepreneurs. For example, Water For People supports the city of Blantyre’s first Pit Emptier’s Association, which brings together local pit emptiers to increase their bargaining power and share their learnings.\n\nIn schools, Water For People increases access to water and sanitation facilities and promotes good hygiene practices among students. To ensure girls can attend and stay in school once they get their periods, school facilities include areas that provide girls privacy during menstruation and incinerators to dispose of sanitary products."
