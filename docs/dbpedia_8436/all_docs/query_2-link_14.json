        "text": "Home > > Malawi\n\nRepublic of Malawi\n\nDziko la Malawi\n\nMalawi is located in south-eastern Africa and this small to medium-sized country extends mostly on the western shores of the lake of the same name, also known as Niassa. The central and northern part of the country is characterized by rather rugged mountains that descend from the border with Zambia to Lake Niassa, while in the south the plain takes over; the economy is still based mainly on agriculture.\n\nGovernment type Presidential republic\n\nArea 118,484 km² (45,747 sq mi)\n\nPopulation 17,564,000 inh. (2018 census)\n\nPopulation 20,271,000 inh. (2024 est.)\n\nPopulation density 171 inh/km² (443 inh/mi²)\n\nCapital Lilongwe (1,200,000 pop.)\n\nCurrency Malawian kwacha\n\nHuman development index 0.512 (169th place)\n\nLanguages English, Chichewa (official), regional languages\n\nLife expectancy M 65 years, F 70 years\n\nBoundaries:\n\nZambia WEST\n\nTanzania NORTH\n\nMozambique EAST and SOUTH\n\nADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS OF MALAWI\n\nMalawi is divided into 3 geographical regions and 28 districts; the most populated district is that of the capital, with more than double the population compared to the second in the ranking, while the district of Mzimba, in the north-western area of the country, is the one with the largest and only area above 10,000 square kilometers.\n\nThere are two large cities in the country near one million inhabitants, the capital Lilongwe and Blantyre; the other inhabited centers are much smaller in size, apart from Mzuzu and Zomba; observing the second map, a greater concentration of the major urban centers in the central-southern area of the territory can be seen."
