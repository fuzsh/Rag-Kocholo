        "text": "A wealth of biodiversity\n\nNamed after the Lilongwe River, the largest city of Malawi, Lilongwe City, lies within a biologically diverse region of the country. The city is surrounded by a large expanse of savannah woodland which is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species. An important part of the city’s ecosystems constitutes the aquatic systems which traverse the city’s landscape. Significant of these, is the Lilongwe River, the largest river in Malawi. The city’s aquatic systems have been known to play an important role in providing critical ecosystem services to the city as well as harbor and provide a refuge for biodiversity.\n\nA Nature Sanctuary, which is located within the boundaries of the city, also provides a natural environment for many wildlife species within the city, including a number of threatened plants species. Started in the early 20th century as a small village on the banks of the Lilongwe River, Lilongwe City has experience rapid development and growth rates in recent times, and has become one of the fastest growing cities in Africa. The city’s rapid growth and development has increased the competition for space for development and biodiversity, and placing biodiversity and ecosystems in this city under severe threat."
