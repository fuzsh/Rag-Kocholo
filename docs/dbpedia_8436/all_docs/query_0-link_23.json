        "text": "Things to See and Do\n\nVisit the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre. This 0.4 sq-mile wilderness area is Malawi’s only sanctuary for orphaned, injured and rescued wild animals, and plays an active role in conservation. Please note: This is not a zoo, so there is no guarantee to see any specific animals on the tour, but you will get to walk through a beautiful wilderness area and learn about the center’s goals and animal conservation in Malawi. Alternatively, you can wander the woodland trails and use the playground, picnic area and cafe.\n\nVisit the Market in the Old Town. The main market near the bus station in Old Town is a pocket of chaotic activity with all sorts of things on sale: bicycle parts, live chickens, vegetables, underwear, knock-off jewelry, live guinea fowl, secondhand tires - the list goes on..... Visitors that like to immerse themselves in new cultures will enjoy exercising their bargaining skills and swapping stories with the locals. After an hour in this market, the chaos of city life beyond its walls will seem like a calm retreat.\n\nBe aware! Pickpockets operate in the crowds and some visitors with large bags have been targeted as well. Make sure to travel light to avoid unwanted attention and don’t bring any valuables. Be aware that pickpockets operate in the crowds. What’s more, some visitors with large bags have been violently robbed, so travel light to avoid unwanted attention and don’t bring any valuables, such as a camera.\n\nExplore the parliament building. This is the home of the national parliament. It moved in 1994 from Zomba to the extravagant palace of former president Banda on the outskirts of Lilongwe and now occupies this shiny new building near Capital Hill. Apply for a free guided tour by filling in a form at the gate two days beforehand (and only on weekdays). The tours visit the offices, exterior and the debating chamber (when not in use).\n\nDiscover the marble and granite Kamuzu Mausoleum. This is the final resting place of Malawi’s ‘president for life’, Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda. Banda ruled from 1961 to 1994 and died in 1997, aged almost 100. Between four pillars inscribed with the initials of his most prices principles - unity, loyalty, obedience and discipline. Guides at the entrance will show you around in exchange for small tip.\n\nThe World War I Memorial is set in the same compound as a statue of Hastings Kamuzu Banda. A tour to the top can get you a good view of Lilongwe; Capital Hill, Parliament, even Bingu Stadium and the wilderness and greenery that defines Lilongwe.\n\nTo experience Malawi’s economic heart, visit the public gallery of the Tabacco Auction Floors. Located 4.3 miles north of the city center, east of main M1 road to Kasungu and Mzuzu, the warehouse auction season is from April to June when bales leaf tobacco is presented to market.\n\nTake a stroll through the Nature Sanctuary. Located on the opposite side of the road from the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre, the Nature Sanctuary is a small woodland area with a circular walking trail leading past the Lingadzi River. If you like birding, the nature sanctuary is the perfect spot to visit early or late afternoon. There’s wildlife that roams around the sanctuary including vervet monkeys, bushbucks and crocodiles, to name a few. The big draw is the 200 species of birds.\n\nA great way to see everything Lilongwe has to offer is a guided tour of the area.\n\nLake Malawi\n\nLake Malawi is the gem in the heart of the country.. This is the ‘inland sea’ of the otherwise land-locked Malawi. This expansive body of crystal clear freshwater bordered by beaches of golden sand is not only beautiful but it boasts water sport opportunities for those looking for something beyond sun, sand and swimming. As one of the first Europeans to set eyes on the Lake Malawi over 150 years ago, the missionary-explorer Dr. David Livingstone christened it the ‘Lake of Stars’.\n\nIt is the fifth-largest freshwater lake in the world by volume, the ninth-largest lake in the world by area, and the third-largest lake in Africa. Lake Malawi is home to more species of fish than any other lake in the world, including at least 700 species of cichlids. The Mozambique portion of the lake was officially declared a reserve by the Government of Mozambique on June 10, 2011, while in Malawi a portion of the lake is included in Lake Malawi National Park.\n\nBecause of its rich fish harvest, the Lake plays an important part in the economy. Fishing villages are dotted along the shore and the traditional industry and practices are an attraction to visitors. Access to the Lake is possible along much of its length but it is often necessary to take a short detour off the main roads in order to reach the beaches. Despite the villages, there are still very long stretches of totally uninhabited golden sand lakeshore, lapped by crystal clear waters.\n\nThe distance between Lilongwe and Lake Malawi National Park is 73 miles. The road distance is 130 miles."
