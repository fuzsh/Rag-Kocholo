        "text": "Decolonial Approaches to Development – syllabus\n\n(SDIS3000 / 3 credits)\n\nThis course examines the critiques emerging from the Global South of Western Eurocentric epistemologies that have been, and continue to be, the foundation for development practice today. The course seeks to recenter the perspective of indigenous epistemologies and voices of local communities from beyond the lens of western knowledge and mainstream development agencies. It engages students experientially from bottom-up, constantly centering self-reflexive approaches of learning in ways that raise critical questions and open spaces for reframing issues such as sustainability, growth, and poverty.\n\nEach module opens with a review of mainstream perspectives on the key issues to be engaged in the module. Carefully prepared excursions, short trips, and site visits that engage diverse alternative epistemologies and perspectives follow. The goal is to critically examine the limits of Western/Eurocentric frames in prompting human dignity and social justice in countries such as Malawi.\n\nInclusive Development Practice in Southeast Africa – syllabus\n\n(SDIS3500 / 3 credits)\n\nThis course centers socioeconomic class, gender and sexual identity, and place of residence in national and local development policy formulation, implementation, and its outcomes, comparatively, in Malawi and Zambia. How does development practice and the practice of development generate social inequality? What can be done to eliminate or mitigate skewed livelihood outcomes in countries such as Malawi and Zambia? What policies can be implemented to enhance equitable development outcomes for women, youth, the elderly, and rural residents? This course delves deeper into trends and patterns across space, class, and time, in the key sectors of development, and the policies and projects through which inequality could be eliminated or mitigated.\n\nResearch Methods and Ethics – syllabus\n\n(ANTH3500 / 3 credits)\n\nThis course equips students with the knowledge and skills for conducting research ethically and successfully in contexts such as Malawi. Beyond the research methods, this course draws on decolonial perspectives to open possibilities for students to consider a wider array of social research questions and methods. Research questions that students frame and research methods they choose to employ will be shaped and informed by the cultural and socio-political context of the chosen research context. The course builds into the learner a critical perspective but also empowers the learner to make decisions that are sensitive to the rights of research subjects.\n\nIndependent Study Project in Development Practice – syllabus\n\n(ISPR3000 / 4 credits)\n\nThe Independent Study Project (ISP) is an academic project that is designed to provide students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of decolonial approaches to sustainable development in Malawi. A central aspect of the ISP is the collection and use of primary data. The ISP does not involve extensive library research that could be done in the United States, but rather takes advantage of the student’s presence in Malawi with access to materials and information sources available on-site. A local advisor, who specializes in the student’s particular field of interest, is designated for the student by the academic director (AD). All topics must be finalized and approved by the AD, and advisors must be selected and confirmed before the project commences.\n\nAs part of the RME course, meetings will be held throughout the semester with the AD and academic tutors of the program to finalize the topic, select an appropriate advisor, define a clear topic and a research question, and identify potential sources of information. Allowing for travel and time to write, edit, and print the final paper, this does not offer a great amount of time for actual field study. For this reason, the topic must be very specific and well-focused. At the end of the course, the student must submit a paper and make a presentation of their fieldwork. The ISP advisor and academic director then evaluate the project in writing. The AD will submit a grade and narrative evaluation of the project to SIT, and in turn, these assessments are then forwarded to the student’s home university."
