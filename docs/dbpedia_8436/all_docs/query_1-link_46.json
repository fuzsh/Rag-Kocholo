        "text": "The Fulbright English Teaching Assistant (ETA) Program in Malawi is sponsored and administered by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) of the United States Department of State. The program is managed in country by the Public Diplomacy Section (PDS) at the U.S. Embassy in Lilongwe.\n\nThe Fulbright ETA Program aims to strengthen educational and cultural relationships between the United States and Malawi and provides the opportunity for recent graduates of various fields with interest in teaching to work in local educational institutions. Malawi offers a rewarding experience for those seeking to work in and gain cultural exposure to a developing country, where their contributions will make a lasting difference.\n\nRegardless of educational and work experience, Fulbright ETAs will not be full-fledged professors and will be expected to co-teach alongside their local colleagues. This program is a professional development opportunity to advance teaching skills, serve as a cultural ambassador, and have a positive experience in the host country.\n\nMalawi is known as the “warm heart of Africa” for its welcoming people. It is famous for Lake Malawi, the fourth-largest freshwater lake (by volume) in the world and home to hundreds of endemic fish species. UNESCO-acclaimed Chongoni Rock-Art Area in Malawi features the richest concentration of rock art in Central Africa. Malawian diversity is evident through the many languages spoken here. However, Chichewa and English are the two national languages.\n\nWelcome to the Warm Heart of Africa! Lilongwe, the capital city of Malawi, is a wonderful place in which to live and work. The climate is agreeable year-round, people are friendly, traffic is calm, and personal security threats are relatively rare. Although we live in a comparatively “quiet” city by African standards, there are a variety of activities that keep our non-work hours filled. Outdoor sports/recreation, community festivals, and home entertaining play key roles in Lilongwe.\n\nLOCATION: Malawi is a small landlocked country in Africa, south of the equator between latitude 9 degrees 45' and 17 degrees 16' south and between longitudes 33 degrees 35' east. Malawi is 46,066 square miles in area of which 9,425 square miles are Lakes Malawi, Malombe, and Chilwa. Among the smallest countries in Africa, Malawi is approximately the size of Pennsylvania. The country is bordered to the north and north-east by the Republic of Tanzania and to the east, south and south-west by the Republic of Mozambique. The Republic of Zambia forms the Western border.\n\nCAPITAL AND MAJOR CITIES: Lilongwe was declared the capital in January 1975. All government ministries are in Lilongwe, but the bulk of media, academic, and commercial sectors remain in the southern cities of Blantyre and Zomba. Mzuzu is the largest city in the north.\n\nAREA AND CLIMATE: The country is dominated by Lake Malawi which runs along much of the eastern border. The lake is 568 kilometers long and 16 kilometers wide, accounting for 20 percent of Malawi's total surface area. Malawi has a varied topography with mountains and rivers which have a direct effect on its climate.\n\nMalawi has two main seasons, the dry and the wet. The wet season extends from November to April, and rainfall can reach between 635mm and 3050mm. From May to August, it is cool at night and dry. In September, it is hot and dry, with October and November being the hottest months.\n\nThe predominant vegetation of Malawi is the savannah woodland. Ever-green forests are found where ground water is plentiful as in river valleys and on mountains. Grasslands are found on high plateaus and river-basins.\n\nPOPULATION: Malawi has a population of over 20 million people with several ethnic groups. The Chewa are found in the central region. The Yaos are mostly found along the lakeshore districts of the central and southern regions. They are also found in Dedza, Machinga, Zomba, Blantyre, and Chiradzulu.\n\nLomwes are mainly found in the Shire Highlands areas of Thyolo and Mulanje while the Nkhonde, Lambya, Tonga, and Tumbuka are found in the north. The Ngoni are found in both the northern and central regions.\n\nCULTURE: Malawian culture is very friendly and very formal. Initially, Malawian values and traditions may seem counterintuitive for visitors from the United States and will likely challenge American assumptions about independence and individuality. In Malawi, a traditional male dominated hierarchy is respected. Speaking out of turn or speaking one’s opinion too vociferously is highly discouraged. Public shame in front of community and colleagues is to be avoided at all costs. On the other hand, the informal community “safety net” to support those in need is gracious and often automatic. A popular Malawian proverb states: “A single head does not carry a roof,” signifying that people are encouraged from an early age to work together and rarely take the initiative to solve problems alone."
