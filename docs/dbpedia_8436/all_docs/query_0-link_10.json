        "text": "Although Lilongwe holds little of interest for most travellers, it’s quite central to the country and not an unpleasant place to spend a night, so most visits to Malawi will pass through here at least once.\n\nLilongwe consists of two contrasting parts, the smart, modern Capital City and the streets and markets of the Old Town:\n\nTo the south of Lilongwe, the Old Town is almost indistinguishable from other small African towns. Here you’ll find a real mix of commercial, residential and industrial buildings. The numerous shops, markets, cafes and restaurants found here sell nearly everything imaginable.\n\nPlanned and built mainly in the late 60s and 70s, Lilongwe’s new town, to the north, the Capital City or City Centre, is the most modern and developed area of Malawi’s capital. Broad avenues bordered by flowerbeds lead along high, shiny white buildings – mainly banks, hotels, embassies and offices. This area hasn’t got a lot of character, but one can’t argue that it isn’t very clean and tidy.\n\nClose to the City Centre, Capital Hill holds more than a dozen office blocks, mainly containing government ministries. Public access is normally not possible, yet occasionally guided tours may be arranged.\n\nTop 2 hotels to stay in Lilongwe\n\nLilongwe has accommodation options to suit most tastes and budgets. At the upper end of the price scale, Latitude 13 is the most luxurious place in town, though there are many more on the affordable side. Ask us for more details of what's where, and what's likely to suit you best!"
