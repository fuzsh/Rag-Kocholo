        "text": "Lilongwe, city, capital (since 1975) of Malawi. Lilongwe, which was named for a nearby river, is located on the inland plains and is the one of the largest cities in the country. It became a colonial district headquarters in 1904. The emergence in the 1920s of a major tobacco industry in the surrounding areas, along with its location at the junction of several major roadways, increased Lilongwe’s importance as an agricultural market centre for the fertile Central Region Plateau. In 1965 Malawi’s first president, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, selected it as an economic growth point for northern and central Malawi. Lilongwe’s development as the new national capital began in 1968.\n\nThe city is spread between two centres: the old city, which functions as a service and distribution centre, and Capital Hill, 3 miles (5 km) away, which houses the government buildings and embassies (except for the country’s judiciary, which is centred in the city of Blantyre). Development projects of the 1970s and ’80s included a new international airport, rail connections to Salima (east) and the Zambian border (west), industrial areas in the northern part of the city, and an agricultural program for the fertile tobacco lands of the Central Region Plateau. Pop. (2008) city, 674,448."
