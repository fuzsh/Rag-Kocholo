        "text": "Lilongwe, which derives its name from the river that dissects the city from west to east, is the capital city of Malawi and has been the seat of government since 1975 following the move of the Capital from Zomba. Lilongwe has developed from a small settlement on the banks of the Lilongwe River to become Malawiâ€™s largest city with over 1 million residents. It is a cosmopolitan city with inhabitants from all over Malawi, Africa and the rest of the world who have made Lilongwe their home. In addition to being the centre of Government administration, Lilongwe is important for industry, distribution, services and trade. It is also the gateway to Malawi at the intersection of road, rail and air connections to the region\n\nUrban governance and development fall under the Lilongwe City Council which was created by law under the Constitution of the Republic of Malawi. The Mayor is the political head of the Council while the Chief Executive Officer heads the administrative arm of the Council. Lilongwe City has 27 wards and 4 parliamentary constituencies and each is represented by a councillor and member of parliament respectively. The City Council has 5 ex-official non voting members representing interest groups across the City. The Council also has a chaplain. The Council is mandated to provide a wide range of municipal services to its residents and to mobilise resources for services delivery and to make bylaws."
