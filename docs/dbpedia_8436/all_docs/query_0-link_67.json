        "text": "Lilongwe\n\nMalawi\n\nInformation about Lilongwe\n\nThe capital and largest city in Malawi is Lilongwe. The location of the city is near the boarders with Mozambique and Zambia. It’s a tiny fishing village on the banks of the Lilongwe River, the city’s namesake. Lilongwe is a green city with grassy areas and trees between buildings.\n\nVisit Lilongwe Wildlife Center, a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation center. They will show you rescued animals and they offer self-guided hiking trails throughout the area. At Kumbali Cultural Center you can see traditional Malawian dancing and drumming complete with a traditional Malawian dinner. Do some shopping at Old Town Mall and visit art galleries, buy imported food and wine or poke around in the book store. Mamma Mia’s Italian Restaurant and Serendipity Café are located here also if all that shopping makes you hungry.\n\nIf you’re thirsty you’re in luck as drinking is a popular pastime in Lilongwe! Carlsberg is the only beer brewed in Malawi and you can purchase it in a variety of different brews. Other popular drinks include Malawi Vodka, Gin, Rum and Brandy. Locals like to mix these spirits with Fanta cola. Check out Diplomats Pub for some cold drinks, music and a game of pool."
