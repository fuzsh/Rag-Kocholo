The city is named after the Lilongwe River, on the banks of which it has existed for centuries as a small fishing village. Lilongwe was the British Colonial administrative center in the beginning of the 20th century. It was so chosen due to its desirable location near Lake Malawi and other important commercial cities.

This capital city is undoubtedly emerging as the economic capital of the nation, being the processing, selling and buying center of the tobacco industry in Malawi.
