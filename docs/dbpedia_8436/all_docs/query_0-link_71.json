Additionally, Lilongwe serves as a major trading center, with markets and businesses catering to both local and international customers.\n\nThe city’s infrastructure has seen substantial improvements over the years, with ongoing projects aimed at enhancing transportation, housing, and public services. The road network within Lilongwe is well-developed, and public transportation options, including minibusses and taxis, are readily available, ensuring efficient mobility for residents and visitors.\n\nLilongwe’s urban landscape is a blend of modernity and tradition.
