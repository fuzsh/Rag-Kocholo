We have primary and secondary classes in school, so you can come here from reception (age 4) all the way to IB (age 18). There are three classes per year group and usually about twenty people in each class.\n\nOur school is a great and exciting place that has children from over 40 different nationalities. Each year we celebrate our different nationalities with a parade of flags. Our school is a happy and busy place that we think is the best in the whole of Malawi!"
