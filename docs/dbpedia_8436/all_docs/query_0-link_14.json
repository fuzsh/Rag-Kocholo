        "text": "Lilongwe is the capital of Malawi, a country in southeastern Africa. The country’s president and lawmakers work in Lilongwe. Malawi’s highest court meets in the city of Blantyre. Blantyre and Lilongwe are the two largest cities in Malawi.\n\nFarmers from surrounding areas sell their crops in Lilongwe. Malawi’s main crop is tobacco. Large amounts of tobacco are traded in Lilongwe. Many people in the city work in government offices, schools, or hotels.\n\nGreat Britain took over what is now Malawi in the late 1800s. The British founded Lilongwe in 1902 as a government post. Malawi became an independent country in 1964. Lilongwe became the capital in 1975. It was chosen to be the new capital because it lies in the center of Malawi. Population (2008 census), 674,448."
