Yehenara, Empress Xiao Ding Jing (1868 â€“ 1913), is better known as the Empress Long Yu. Xiao Ding Jing was the Qing Dynasty Empress Consort of the Guangxu Emperor of China. Empress Xiao Ding Jing came from the Manchu Yehenara clan and was also a cousin of Guangxu Emperor, who reigned from 1875 to 1908. She was also a niece of the Empress Dowager Cixi. She was de facto regent of China from her husband's death in 1908, when her adopted son, the child Puyi (1906-1967) (known as the Last Emperor of China) was emperor until the office of emperor was officially abolished in 1911. However, the imperial family continued to enjoy their titles, and to reside in the Forbidden City and to run it as if they still held power. She was 46 years old when she died.
