        "text": "Yeah, so I know it’s really weird to be writin’ bout Emperors when we’re talkin’ bout Cixi, but we gotta know about them a li'l bit more ‘cause it certainly explained why she was able to be in power for quite some time.\n\nWhy Emperor Tongzhi had no successors.\n\nTongzhi wasn’t really good at his studies, and when he grew up he didn’t really wanna rule the empire, either. He was like his dad, the Xianfeng Emperor, and he loved to have the sexytiemz. His teacher encouraged him and they would like, totally go off and have sex wit’ prostitutes.\n\nCixi was so not down wit’ that, and so she and Ci'an thought that they should totes marry him off so he couldn’t mess around. They picked 4 wimminz, and Cixi’s niece was one of them, and basically, Cixi thought her niece’s milkshake brought all Emperors to the yard.\n\nBut surprise, surprise, Tongzhi picked a fatter Manchu woman who would later be known as Empress Xiaozheyi. Cixi was like, totes upset 'cause she wanted to exert influence and power through her niece, but Ci'an told her to chill and said it was totes okay if he married the Manchu girl, and all the other girls could be deputies.\n\nEven after he got married, he didn’t even have sex wit’ any of his wives, 'cause the palace had some dumb rule that a woman had to lie down stiff on the Emperor’s bed and he had to do all the work. Obviously Tongzhi didn’t like this and went to have sex wit’ more prostitutes, and he contracted syphilis, and what peeps called “plum poison.”\n\nHe was examined by all the court physicians, but no one dared tell the truth. So, Cixi brought her “Uncle” Ronglu in, and when he told her the truth, it was too late. Tongzhi died like, soon after. Some historical sources state that he had smallpox, though, but I’m more inclined to believe in this explanation.\n\nChoosin’ The Next Puppet uh, I mean… Emperor\n\nSo who’s gonna be the next dude under Cixi’s thumb? She and Ci'an had a discussion, and Ci'an was all, “Y'know, since Yixin helped us ditch your husband’s advisors, you should totes nominate his son, Zaichen.” Yixin couldn’t agree wit’ the Empress 'cause it would so obviously be a blatant grab for power, and so he recommended Tongzhi’s nephews. Cixi didn’t like this 'cause it meant that she would be the new Emperor’s grandma and be out of power.\n\nInstead, she chose the son of Prince Chun I, called Zaitian. He was only 4 which meant she could still rule from behind the curtain. No one said anything, 'cept for Wu Kedu, the court historian. He killed himself in a show of protest.\n\nShe didn’t give a shit and continued rulin’. The new Emperor, Guangxu disagreed wit’ Cixi and she didn’t want him in her way. So, she made Guangxu marry her niece, who became Empress Longyu. They didn’t love each other. Emperor Guangxu also had 2 other concubines and he was the emperor wit’ da fewest concubines, yo.\n\nAnyway, Emperor Guangxu wanted to have a Hundred Days of Reform, and Cixi was conservative as hell. In 1898, Cixi plotted wit’ her “uncle” Ronglu to overthrow him. The Emperor was away supervising a military parade.\n\nBut there ain’t no such thang as privacy, and so the Emperor got to know of the plot. He talked to his homies, Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao and Tan Sitong.\n\nTan Sitong went to Yuan Shikai and told him to kill Ronglu and put Cixi under house arrest, but Yuan Shikai betrayed them. So Cixi got to know 'bout this counter-ploy and put Guangxu under house arrest, first. Lady Zhen, his concubine, was also imprisoned.\n\nWhen Cixi was tryna flee Beijing in 1900, she ordered Lady Zhen to get into the well. Lady Zhen refused and like, started arguing wit’ Cixi. Fed up, Cixi asked the eunuch to push her down and she eventually drowned.\n\nCixi also announced to errbody that Guangxu was like, so not fit to be Emperor in 1898, in an edict. By then, Guangxu couldn’t do nothin’. Weng Tonghe, his tutor and Kang Youwei were exiled. Tan Sitong was executed.\n\nAll this lasted till 1908 and Guangxu was seriously freakin’ fed up with Cixi, or the “Old Buddha,” as she was called. He wrote in his diary that he was totally sure that Cixi would die before him, and he would kill Yuan Shikai and Li Lianying, her eunuch.\n\nLi Lianying brough the diary to her, and she was so pissed off after readin’ it. She was like, “No way in hell am I gonna die before him.” She asked Li to take poisoned food towards him, and soon after, he died on the same day. Cixi died two days later, and chose Puyi to be the next and last Emperor."
