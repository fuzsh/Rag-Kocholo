        "text": "What if someone were to ask you, ‘What is the most remarkable achievement you accomplished at the age of three?’ While many might share stories of playing with neighborhood kids, a three-year-old boy named Aisin-Gioro Puyi would recount his reign as the Emperor of China.\n\nIn the cinematic masterpiece ‘The Last Emperor’ by Bernardo Bertolucci, the director employs a diverse array of film techniques to capture the transformation of China during the 20th century through the lens of the last emperor’s narrative. From the era of imperial China to the birth of the People’s Republic of China, the nation and its people undergo constant change. As viewers, we are transported into Puyi’s memories. Through the film, Bertolucci skillfully presents Puyi’s decline, both in his political standing and personal life, to emphasize the idea that society should be led by ordinary individuals rather than solely by members of the imperial family.\n\nThe movie underscores that Puyi’s personal journey is deeply influenced by the historical context in which he lived. Various film techniques are employed to convey the broad spectrum of Puyi’s life experiences. For example, flashbacks are used to connect the audience with Puyi’s personal life. The first scene, set in 1950, depicts the Red Guards imprisoning Puyi, accusing him of betraying his country by collaborating with the Japanese during the Sino-Japanese war. During his imprisonment, Puyi attempts suicide in a restroom, and the film transports the audience back to 1908 when he was summoned to the Forbidden City by Empress Dowager Longyu. This flashback is pivotal, as it raises questions about how Puyi ended up incarcerated, despite his role as the Emperor of China. The use of flashbacks creates tension and encourages viewers to empathize with Puyi, understanding the circumstances that led to his imprisonment. Bertolucci’s narrative choice, shifting between the present story and earlier time periods in Puyi’s life, allows us to comprehend the failure of the Chinese imperial system, which ultimately led to his confinement.\n\nIn highlighting the ultimate reform of the imperial system, the film delivers a scathing critique of imperial governance, revealing the imperial court’s lack of wisdom in running the country. The film portrays Puyi’s reluctance to ascend to the throne, depicting him as a mere puppet. In the movie’s opening, following the death of the Guangxu Emperor, Empress Dowager Longyu summons the three-year-old Puyi to the Forbidden City. Puyi’s immediate accession to the throne is accompanied by an eerie fog that conveys his lack of control in this situation. This scene is significant, illustrating how the Chinese imperial system was fundamentally flawed, as a three-year-old boy had no business governing the nation due to his lack of wisdom and control.\n\nAdditionally, the film underscores Puyi’s isolation at various life stages. This isolation is conveyed through the recurring use of music. The movie pairs significant setbacks and changes in Puyi’s life with an elegant piece of music titled ‘The Last Emperor.’ For instance, when fifteen-year-old Puyi learns of his mother’s death, he pleads with the guards at the Forbidden City’s front gate to open it, but they remain unresponsive. Later in the film, while living in the Japanese residence outside Beijing, Puyi is informed of his wife Wanrong’s departure for urgent medical treatment. Once again, he seeks to exit his residence, but the guards ignore him. The elegant music accompanying Puyi’s moments of despair underscores the sense of isolation he experiences, despite his position as Emperor.\n\nTo illuminate the flaws in the Chinese imperial system, Bertolucci employs fictional scenes to provide deeper insight into the imperial family. For instance, the presence of a cricket in the film serves as a symbolic choice. When Puyi ascends the throne, his servant presents him with a container housing a cricket. Puyi opens the container, and the cricket emerges, bowing to him. Later in the movie, as Puyi becomes an ordinary citizen during the People’s Republic of China, he returns to the Forbidden City and encounters a young boy guarding the throne. Puyi informs the boy that he was the last emperor of China, but the boy doesn’t believe him. In response, Puyi retrieves the same container from beneath the throne and hands it to the boy. As Puyi sits on the throne and observes the boy, the container is found empty, and Puyi seems to vanish. These scenes involving the cricket are clearly fictional choices.\n\nDrawing from Robert Rosenstone’s History on Film/Film on History, we find that the film director’s combination of fact and fiction in these scenes deepens our comprehension of the narrative. This blending of fact and fiction allows us to understand the complex relationships influencing Puyi’s personal and political conflicts.\n\nAfter witnessing the film techniques in ‘The Last Emperor,’ it becomes possible for the audience to perceive Puyi as a metaphorical cricket trapped in a cage. In Chinese culture, crickets symbolize prosperity and longevity because they lay numerous eggs before their death. Puyi can be likened to a newly hatched cricket when the Guangxu Emperor passes away, and he is placed within a metaphorical cage, trapped under the imperial system. This metaphor of the cricket underscores the imperial system’s downfall, as it helps the audience connect the historical subtext to Puyi. Puyi’s struggle to perpetuate the longevity of the imperial family as the last emperor of China underscores the idea that governance should not be limited to members of the imperial family but should involve ordinary people.\n\nThe film delves deep into Puyi’s narrative and life experiences, raising the question: What does Puyi’s life signify within the broader narrative of China? As China transitions from an imperial state to a communist nation, Puyi undergoes a transformation from the last emperor to an ordinary citizen of the People’s Republic of China. During the cultural revolution, as society eradicates imperialist and bourgeois influences, Puyi encounters Red Guards berating a group of intellectuals and officials. Among them, he recognizes Ruocheng Ying, the governor of the detention camp where he was once imprisoned. Puyi approaches Ruocheng, highlighting his role in helping Puyi adapt to an ordinary life during his time in the camp. However, the Red Guards disregard Puyi’s defense, subjecting Ruocheng to harassment and violence on account of his perceived lack of support for the communist party. This scene illustrates that Puyi is not alone in facing accusations as an enemy of his own country. Many government officials like Ruocheng are also impacted by the changes in China. The film portrays a wide range of lives affected by the shifts in the political system, emphasizing the privilege and loss that many experienced due to the downfall of the imperial system.\n\nDuring this tumultuous period in Chinese history, the nation’s narrative becomes increasingly intricate as it grapples with political instability within a short span of time. This instability makes it challenging for people to articulate their experiences fully. Puyi, renowned as the last emperor of China, is one of the few individuals who directly lived through the significant changes in China, making him a guiding figure who helps the audience navigate the complex narrative of modern China. Although ‘The Last Emperor’ showcases Puyi’s failures and setbacks as the reasons behind his imprisonment, by viewing the story through his perspective, we gain insights into the intricate events that can shape a person’s life and understand that when confronted with events beyond one’s control, one must focus on what they can influence."
