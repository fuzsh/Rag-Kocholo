        "text": "Anonymous asked:\n\ndo you know what weddings were like for princes and princesses in the qing dynasty?\n\nMost of this is based on information about Emperor Guangxu’s wedding to Empress Longyu. Obviously the emperor’s wedding is a lot more elaborate, but weddings of princes and princesses should be somewhat the same.\n\nSources: 1, 2, also Vietnamese book: Những người đàn bà của hoàng đế, Hướng Tư (2003), NXB Văn hóa – Thông tin\n\nNormal people’s weddings during the Qing dynasty would consist of the following six ceremonies:\n\nProposal 纳采 nacai\n\nAsking for the bride’s name and birthday 问名 wenming\n\nVisit the fortune teller (to ensure that bride and groom’s birthdates are compatible 纳吉 naji\n\nPrepare and send wedding gifts 纳征 nazheng\n\nChoosing a ceremony date 请期 qingqi\n\nWedding ceremony 亲迎 qinying\n\nFor the emperor, this is reduced down to basically :\n\nnacai\n\nnazheng (for the emperor, it is called dazheng 大征, because the emperor’s marriage is referred to as the “great marriage” 大婚 dahun)\n\nwedding ceremony combined with the investiture of the empress (in the cases of Shunzhi, Kangxi, Tongzhi, Guangxu who came to the throne before they were married)\n\n(The whole things to do with asking for the birthdate and checking whether it’s compatible is pretty redundant considering if you are chosen to marry the emperor, you have already gone through the xiunv selection process which is pretty much the same thing.)\n\nTimeline for Guangxu’s marriage:\n\n2nd day 11th month 14th year of Guangxu era: proposal (nacai)\n\n4th day 12th month 14th year: sending wedding gift (dazheng)\n\n26th day 1st month 15th year: announce the betrothal to Heaven and Earth and the ancestral shrines\n\n27th day 1st month 15th year: the empress enters the palace (fengying 凤迎, 凤 phoenix refers to the empress), investiture of the empress and wedding ceremony\n\n2nd day 2nd month 15th year: ceremony of the empress paying respects to Empress Dowager Cixi (chaojian 朝见)\n\nIn normal weddings, the groom and/or his parents would present the betrothal/wedding gifts to the bride’s family himself, and then on the wedding day, the groom would go to the bride’s home to pick her up. However, as the emperor is considered too high and mighty to do any of that himself, for all these ceremonies, he would appoint several representatives consisting of one main commissioner (正使 zhengshi) and at least one deputy commissioner (副使 fushi) to carry out these tasks for him. These commissioners would be chosen among the princes or high-ranking officials close to the emperor.\n\nLegend of Ruyi: Fu Heng being the zhengshi at Qian Long’s wedding to Ruyi, because nothing says fuck you true love like getting the brother of your dead first wife to be your proxy at the wedding to your second wife, whom your first wife hated and spent her last breaths more or less cursing. No wonder Fu Heng looks so happy.\n\n(This appointment was historically accurate, but considering Langhua and Ruyi’s relationship in this drama, this is such an asshole move. Fu Heng was the zhengshi at the investiture of the Step Empress into the position of Imperial Noble Consort as well.)\n\nNacai (proposal)\n\nDuring the proposal ceremony, the commissioners will present betrothal gifts to the bride’s family. For Guangxu’s marriage, betrothal gifts consisted of four horses with saddles; ten suits of armour; one hundred bolts of brocade in yellow, red, orange, indigo, blue; and two hundred bolts of fabric, along with gold and silver household items. The horses and armour represent the Manchurian history of conquering China through martial prowess.\n\nAfterwards, an engagement banquet is held at the bride’s house, prepared by the Imperial Tea Kitchen of the palace and at the expense of the imperial palace as a thank you to the bride’s family for raising her.\n\nDazheng (sending wedding gifts)\n\nWedding gifts will consist of gifts to members of the bride’s family, as well as items for the bride’s use after marriage.
