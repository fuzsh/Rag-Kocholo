She ruled China for decades and brought a medieval empire into the modern age.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, in a nationwide selection for royal consorts, Cixi was chosen as one of the Emperor’s numerous concubines and sexual partners. When he died in 1861, their five-year-old son succeeded to the throne. Cixi at once launched a palace coup against the regents appointed by her husband and made herself the real ruler of China – behind the throne, literally, with a silk screen separating her from her officials who were all male.\n\nIn this groundbreaking biography, Jung Chang vividly describes how Cixi fought against monumental obstacles to change China. Under her the ancient country attained virtually all the attributes of a modern state: industries, railways, electricity, telegraph, and an army and navy with up-to-date weaponry. It was she who abolished gruesome punishments like ‘death by a thousand cuts’ and put an end to foot-binding. She inaugurated women’s liberation, and embarked on the path to introduce parliamentary elections to China. Jung Chang comprehensively overturns the conventional view of Cixi as a diehard conservative and cruel despot.\n\nCixi reigned during extraordinary times and had to deal with a host of major national crises: the Taiping and Boxer Rebellions, wars with France and Japan – and the invasion by eight allied powers including Britain, Germany, Russia and the United States. Jung Chang not only records the Empress Dowager’s conduct of domestic and foreign affairs, but also takes the reader into the depths of her splendid Summer Palace and the harem of Beijing’s Forbidden City, where she lived surrounded by eunuchs – with one of whom she fell in love, with tragic consequences. The world Jung Chang describes here, in fascinating detail, seems almost unbelievable in its extraordinary mixture of the very old and the very new.\n\nBased on newly available, mostly Chinese, historical documents such as court records, official and private correspondence, diaries and eye-witness accounts, this biography will revolutionise historical thinking about a crucial period in China’s – and the world’s – history. Packed with drama, fast-paced and gripping, it is both a panoramic depiction of the birth of modern China and an intimate portrait of a woman: as the concubine to a monarch, as the absolute ruler of a third of the world’s population, and as a unique stateswoman.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJung Chang is the bestselling author of Wild Swans (1991, which the Asian Wall Street Journal called the most read book about China), and Mao: The Unknown Story (2005, with Jon Halliday), which was described by Time magazine as ‘an atom bomb of a book’. Her books have been translated into more than 40 languages and sold more than 15 million copies outside mainland China where they are both banned. She was born in China in 1952, and came to Britain in 1978. She lives in London.\n\nAlso by Jung Chang\n\nWILD SWANS: THREE DAUGHTERS OF CHINA\n\nMAO: THE UNKNOWN STORY\n\n(with Jon Halliday)\n\nList of Illustrations\n\nCixi dressed as Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy.\n\nOld Beijing Streets.\n\nA caravan of camels passing in front of a Beijing city gate.\n\nCixi carried by eunuchs.\n\nPrince Chun, who was married to Cixi’s sister.\n\nPrince Gong, Cixi’s right-hand man.\n\nViceroy Zhang Zhidong.\n\nLi Hongzhang (Earl Li) with Lord Salisbury and Lord Curzon.\n\nGeneral Yuan Shikai, later first President of the Republic of China.\n\nJunglu entertaining Western visitors.\n\nAnson Burlingame heads the first Chinese delegation to the West.\n\nCharles ‘Chinese’ Gordon.\n\nSarah Conger with Cixi and other ladies of the American Legation.\n\nSir Robert Hart with his Western band of Chinese musicians.\n\nPainting by Cixi.\n\nPanel showing Cixi’s calligraphy.\n\nPainting and calligraphy by Emperor Xianfeng.\n\nCixi playing Go with a eunuch.\n\nAirbrushed photograph of Cixi.\n\nPortrait of Emperor Xianfeng.\n\n‘Lootie’, a Pekinese given to Queen Victoria.\n\nEmperor Tongzhi as a child, playing with his half-sister.\n\nPortrait of Emperor Guangxu.\n\nPortrait of Empress Zhen.\n\nThe harem at the rear of the Forbidden City.\n\nThe front and main part of the Forbidden City on the occasion of Emperor Guangxu’s wedding.\n\nThe audience room in the Forbidden City.\n\nThe Summer Palace.\n\nPortrait of Cixi by Katharine Carl.\n\nKatharine Carl in Chinese costume.\n\nCixi in the snow with Louisa Pierson, Der Ling and Rongling.\n\nYu Keng, Louisa Pierson and family with Prince Zaizhen in Paris.\n\nRongling, ‘the First Lady of modern dancing in China’.\n\nHsingling dressed as Napoleon.\n\nA Chinese courtesan.\n\nChinese children sent to America for education.\n\nPearl, Emperor Guangxu’s favourite concubine.\n\nGrand Tutor Weng.\n\nCixi in a temple with Empress Longyu.\n\nSir Yinhuan Chang.\n\nKang Youwei.\n\nLiang Qichao.\n\nJapanese banknote showing Itō Hirobumi.\n\nThe Boxers in 1900.\n\nAllied forces entering the Forbidden City.\n\nCixi waving to a foreign photographer.\n\nPostcard of the imperial locomotive.\n\nGirls with bound feet.\n\nConvicts in cangues.\n\nCixi putting a flower in her hair.\n\nCixi smiling.\n\nCixi on a barge on the lake of the Sea Palace."
