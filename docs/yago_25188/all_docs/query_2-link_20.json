        "text": "16 commercial vintage cardboard photos reproduced from the original photos shows the members and ceremonies of The Qing dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of China. Includes images of the last Emperor of China Aisin-Gioro Puyi and Empress Xiaokemin, empress of Puyi, other important members of dynasty (Prince Chun, Empress Dowager Cixi, Empress Xiaodingjing, etc.), noblesse, ceremonies, etc. Photos are in very good condition.\n\nThe Qing dynasty, officially the Great Qing, also called the Empire of the Great Qing, or the Manchu dynasty, was the last imperial dynasty of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 with a brief, abortive restoration in 1917. It was preceded by the Ming dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China. The Qing multi-cultural empire lasted almost three centuries and formed the territorial base for the modern Chinese state.\n\nZaifeng (12 February 1883 – 3 February 1951), formally Prince Chun of the First Rank or simply Prince Chun, was a Manchu noble of the Qing Dynasty. He was the father of Puyi, the last Qing emperor, and served as Prince-Regent during his son's reign from 1908 to 1911. Zaifeng was a younger half-brother of Puyi's predecessor, the Guangxu Emperor.\n\nAisin-Gioro Puyi (7 February 1906 – 17 October 1967), of the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan, commonly known as Henry Pu Yi, was the last Emperor of China and the twelfth and final ruler of the Qing dynasty.\n\nLady Gobulo, Empress Xiaokemin (Lady Gobulo, Empress Hsiao-ko-min; 13 November 1906 – 20 June 1946), better known as Empress Wanrong (Empress Wan-jung), was the empress of Puyi, the last Emperor of China and final ruler of the Qing Dynasty. She became empress of the puppet state of Manchukuo when Puyi was installed as its nominal ruler during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Her English name is Elizabeth.\n\nEmpress Dowager Cixi (Empress Dowager Tzu-hsi; 29 November 1835 – 15 November 1908), of the Manchu Yehenaraclan, was a powerful and charismatic woman who unofficially but effectively controlled the Manchu Qing dynasty in China for 47 years, from 1861 to her death in 1908."
