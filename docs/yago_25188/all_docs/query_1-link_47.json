        "text": "Instalment 41 (1908)\n\nScene 1: At the Imperial Palace\n\nThe Empress Dowager Cixi is discussing the twelve year preparation period for the drafting of a Chinese constitution with the new cabinet. The emperor is also present. As a first step towards the establishment of the constitutional monarchy, Yuan Shikai proposes to immediately set up a central consultative committee on state affairs, as well as a consultative board and provincial and community assemblies on all levels. The Chun Prince Zaifeng disagrees and this leads to a fierce discussion between the two. The Guangxu emperor sarcastically comments on Yuanâs deviousness: âI understand what you actually intend to do.â (Only two years ago, Yuan had recommended a twelve year preparation period in order to be agreeable to Cixi who wished to postpone the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. Now, he hopes to make sure that the power cannot fall into the hands of the emperor anymore but immediately goes to the assemblies). Finally, Zhang Zhidong is allowed to speak. According to Zhang, the administrative measures for an introduction of constitutionalism should indeed be taken. Cixi personally wishes to attract the people to the monarchy by pursuing a measured attempt at reforms. She strives to secure that military upheavals â such as have been organised incessantly by the revolutionaries in the recent past â will not be able to purge the Manchu dynasty. During the conversation, one notices that Cixiâs health is poor.\n\nScene 2: In the Imperial Palace Gardens\n\nCixi, who is taking a walk accompanied by Zhang Zhidong, is talking to a surprised Zhang about who could possibly be made an heir to the throne in case the young Guangxu emperor should pass away. Zhang advocates an adult emperor who would profit the country. Cixi, however, seems to favour an underage emperor who could be considered a direct descendant of her own son, the Muzong emperor, who had died early. In the end, Zhang Zhidong understands Cixiâs hint; namely, that one should estimate for an early death of the Guangxu emperor and start to think about a possible heir to the throne! It seems that the emperor has little time left to live. Cixi feels too tired to exercise her 999 steps, which used to be her firmly established custom.\n\nScene 3: At Yuan Shikaiâs residence\n\nIn Yuan Shikaiâs house, Li Lianying, who has been sent by Cixi as an emissary, congratulates Yuan to his 50th anniversary. Yuan asks Li an apparently simple question: who walks ahead when a minister accompanies Cixi on a walk. Li replies that Cixi naturally walks ahead and that the minister follows her while guarding an appropriate distance. Yuan asks further: if the Guangxu emperor was to accompany Cixi on such a walk, who would be going ahead? (The word âto goâ can also be used as a euphemism denoting death in Chinese). Thus, Yuan is indirectly trying to inquire about Cixiâs and the emperorâs health in order to estimate who will probably die first and who will ultimately hold the power. Li Lianying avoids answering the sensitive question.\n\nScene 4: In Cixiâs bed chamber\n\nEmpress Longyu is kneeling in front of Cixiâs bed. Cixi is very ill. First, Cixi expresses her empathy to Longyu who has suffered for years from an unhappy marriage with the emperor, but insists that Longyu should always fulfil her matrimonial duties as the emperorâs wife. As the principal wife of the disem-powered emperor she is supposed to visit him occasionally, even though she bears hatred against him. Cixi reminds Longyu that in future, Longyu will be the Empress Dowager and as such committed to supporting an underage emperor. (This is a clear sign that the emperorâs death is imminent).\n\nScene 5: At Yingtai, the emperorâs place of seclusion\n\nLi Lianying brings a blanket to the coughing emperor who is living secluded at Yingtai. Li cared for the emperor when he was only a child. On this visit, Li actually wants to bid the emperor farewell. When he informs the emperor that Cixi is gravely ill, the emperor now sees a chance to assume power. He immediately tries on his imperial gown and has all the musical clocks play the same melody: the music which was played at his enthronisation. Then he complains to Li about his wretched and helpless days at the Imperial Court where he was only allowed to play the role of a marionette. At the end of the visit, the emperor promises Li that he will remain Chief Eunuch once the emperor has taken over government again! Li is very grieved because he knows very well that this promise is only an illusion. A few hours later, the empress Longyu and Xiao Dezi find the emperorâs corpse at Yingtai. Longyu leaves Yingtai in shock.\n\nScene 6: Members of the Imperial Family are kneeling outside of Cixiâs bed chambers / inside the bed chambers the last audience is taking place\n\nCixi, whose death is imminent, appoints the Chun Prince Zaifeng, whose son Puyi will be made the new emperor, to be the Prince Regent. Her last admonition to Zaifeng orders him to shorten the length of the preparations for a Chinese constitution. Also, he should treat Yuan Shikai friendly at least, even if he continues to see Yuan as an outsider. On the deathbed, Yuan promises Cixi that he will destroy the revolutionary troops and âdefend the Qing dynasty for ten thousand yearsâ. Li Lianying can only sneer at Yuanâs remarks. Cixi commissions Zhang Zhidong to choose an honorary title for the deceased Guangxu emperor as well as a reign title for the new emperor."
