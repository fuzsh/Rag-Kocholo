        "text": "Guangxu Emperor (1871 — 1908), named Zaitian, revered as Emperor Dezong of Qing, was the penultimate emperor in both the Qing Dynasty and the history of China.\n\n​\n\nHis entire life was controlled mainly by his aunt, Empress Dowager Cixi.\n\nGuangxu Emperor only obtained power for a few years, during which he participated in a failed war and implemented a short-term but advanced reform.\n\nHe was not afraid of losing his power or the throne; however, the Guangxu Emperor and his followers could not apply the unprecedented transformation.\n\nYoung Guangxu Emperor Restrained by Empress Dowager\n\n​\n\nZaitian’s birth father was a noble prince, the son of the Daoguang Emperor; his birth mother was the sister of Empress Dowager Cixi.\n\n​\n\nWhen Zaitian was four years old, the current emperor, Empress Dowager Cixi’s only son, passed away and left no heir.\n\n​\n\nCixi still wanted to keep reigning the empire, so she needed a young puppet emperor who was easy to manipulate.\n\n​\n\nTherefore, she decided to take her sister’s boy, the four-year-old Zaitian as her adoptive son and supported him as the new emperor.\n\nAfterward, Zaitian left his birth parents and started to live in the Forbidden City.\n\n​\n\nCixi didn’t only take Zaitian as her means to obtain power; she also loved him as her nephew and adoptive son and raised him as her heir.\n\n​\n\nShe assigned Zaitian to the most knowledgeable teacher, though she decided what to teach him.\n\n​\n\nWhen Zaitian, now the Guangxu Emperor, turned 18, he married his queen, a girl that Cixi assigned.\n\n​\n\nAfterward, Cixi gave him back the authority and let him make political decisions on his own.\n\nThe Decimated Army and the Lost Dignity of the Guangxu Emperor\n\n​\n\nA few years later, the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 — 1895) erupted, and the Guangxu Emperor decisively supported the decision to fight.\n\n​\n\nHowever, the Qing Empire's navy, which was Li Hongzhang's private troop, the Beiyang Fleet, suffered defeat after a series of intense battles.\n\n​\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor wanted to move the capital city to a safer place and continue to fight against Japan. Still, Cixi insisted on suing for peace and then signed the unfair Treaty of Shimonoseki that included the cede of vast territories and a great deal of war indemnity.\n\n​\n\nThis huge failure meant the Self-Strengthening Movement (1861 — 1895) had failed thoroughly, and Qing became a semi-colonial and semi-feudal empire.\n\n​\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor faced the sea where Qing’s main force had perished and wailed sadly, feeling extremely miserable that he couldn’t defend his country as the monarch.\n\nGuangxu Emperor and His Thorough Reform Movement\n\n​\n\nThe day after the Qing Empire signed the harmful treaty with Japan, around 1300 scholars suggested that the lagged Qing required fundamental, more radical reforms.\n\n​\n\nThe Guangxu Emperor strongly supported these ideas and tried harder to seek changes.\n\n​\n\nThree years later, supported by some officials, the Guangxu Emperor implemented the Reform Movement of 1898.\n\n​\n\nThis reform included changing Qing’s Manchu clothes and hairstyle, establishing constitutions, parliament, modern armies, new schools, encouraging private business and industry, free communication, cutting off Manchu privileges, etc.\n\n​\n\nThese policies required transferring political and military power away from Cixi and Manchu nobles, a fundamental reform of the Qing Empire’s nomadic aristocratic system.\n\nThe Failed and Imprisoned Reign of Guangxu Emperor\n\n​\n\nWhether these reform officials and the Guangxu Emperor were capable or too naive to implement those policies, as many historians argued, they had tried their best to make a considerable change.\n\n​\n\nGuangxu Emperor Zaitian, as a feudal emperor occupying centralized power, was prepared to give up his paramount power in exchange for a better country.\n\n​\n\nThroughout the Qing Dynasty, he was the first and only monarch who put the country's dignity and prosperity before his power and put civilians' interests before the nomadic Manchu nobles'.\n\n​\n\nHowever, this reform displeased the entire ruling class, including Empress Dowager Cixi, Qing's nomadic nobles, and many conservative officials who were removed from power.\n\nHence, Cixi initiated a coup, imprisoned the Guangxu Emperor, and executed some reformist officials.\n\n​\n\nThis movement lasted only 103 days.\n\n​\n\nBesides strong opponents from conservative nobles, the Guangxu Emperor and his reform officials also lacked political and administrative experience.\n\n​\n\nThey had implemented numerous aggressive and hasty policies aimed at reforming the old and decaying system within a limited time, many of which were neither feasible nor realistic given the circumstances.\n\n​\n\nAfterward, Cixi regained all the power, dramatically damaging her relationship with the Guangxu Emperor.\n\nShe also tried to nominate another heir to replace Guangxu but failed because of strong opponents among the ruling class and foreign forces in Qing.\n\nTragic Love Story of the Guangxu Emperor\n\n​\n\nGuangxu Emperor didn’t like his queen, the girl Cixi chose for him. This queen, respected as Empress Longyu, got the crown only because she was Cixi’s niece.\n\n​\n\nGuangxu Emperor also got two imperial concubines when he was 18; one named Zhen was the love of his life.\n\n​\n\nShe was a beautiful, active, open-minded girl who completely understood and supported Guangxu’s ideology and introduced some officials to assist his reform.\n\n​\n\nHowever, her involvement in politics strongly displeased Cixi; in some gossip, Zhen was punished (possibly beaten) and locked up by Cixi after the reform failed, and Guangxu was imprisoned.\n\n​\n\nIn 1900, despite the Guangxu Emperor’s strong opposition, Cixi declared war against the Eight Power Allied Force, and the Qing kept losing.\n\n​\n\nBefore the Eight Power Allied Force occupied Beijing, Cixi escaped westward. But before she left Beijing, she commanded to kill Zhen, who was cruelly thrown into a well in the royal palace and drowned.\n\n​\n\nThis well is now a tourist site inside the Forbidden City.\n\nWhen Cixi was old and sick, the Guangxu Emperor was poisoned to death under her command because of his “rebel” policy and the potentiality to jeopardize Qing’s Manchu aristocratic dominance.\n\n​\n\nGuangxu Emperor passed away one day before Cixi was gone.\n\n​\n\nGuangxu Emperor Zaitian was an unlucky and pathos emperor in the history of China.\n\n​\n\nHe was not afraid of wars or losing power or the throne; he tried to implement a fundamental reform that could bring significant changes to his country.\n\n​\n\nUnlike his ancestors and his aunt, he stepped out of the cage and started to think from a bigger perspective; however, he and his followers’ incapability made the unprecedented reform encounter a complete failure.\n\n​\n\nGuangxu Emperor never stopped trying and learning but still ended up being a victim of the wheel of history."
