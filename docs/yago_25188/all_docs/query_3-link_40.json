(For the People's Republic of China, the URAA took effect on January 1, 1996. For the Republic of China (ROC), the URAA took effect on January 1, 2002.[1])\n\nTo uploader: Please provide where the image was first published and who created it or held its copyright.\n\nYou must also include a United States public domain tag to indicate why this work is in the public domain in the United States.\n\nNote that this work might not be in the public domain in countries that do not apply the rule of the shorter term and have copyright terms longer than life of the author plus 50 years.
