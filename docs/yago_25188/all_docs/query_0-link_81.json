        "text": "For the 1975 Hong Kong film, see The Empress Dowager.\n\nEmpress dowager (also dowager empress or empress mother) (Chinese and Japanese: 皇太后; pinyin: huángtàihòu; rōmaji: Kōtaigō; Korean: 황태후 (皇太后); romaja: Hwang Tae Hu; Vietnamese: Hoàng Thái Hậu (皇太后)) is the English language translation of the title given to the mother or widow of a Chinese emperor, Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese king in the Chinese cultural sphere.\n\nThe title was also given occasionally to another woman of the same generation, while a woman from the previous generation was sometimes given the title of grand empress dowager (Chinese and Japanese: 太皇太后; pinyin: tàihúangtàihòu; rōmaji: Taikōtaigō; Korean: 태황태후 (太皇太后); romaja: Tae Hwang Tae Hu; Vietnamese: Thái Hoàng Thái Hậu (太皇太后)). An empress dowager wielded absolute power over the harem and imperial family and sometimes even for important issues that were necessary, the emperor or officials went to empress dowager to consult. Empress Dowager's position was second after the emperor, but she was ahead of him in respect, because the emperor lowered his head in front of her to show his respect and stood in front of her with respect and politeness, even was precise in the way he spoke and faced her. Numerous empress dowagers held regency during the reign of underage emperors. Many of the most prominent empress dowagers also extended their control for long periods after the emperor was old enough to govern. This was a source of political turmoil according to the traditional view of Chinese history.\n\nThe title dowager empress was given to the wife of a deceased emperor of Russia or Holy Roman emperor.\n\nBy country\n\nFor grand empresses dowager, visit grand empress dowager.\n\nEast Asia\n\nChinese empresses dowager\n\nHan dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Lü (241–180 BC), empress consort of Emperor Gaozu of Han (256-195 BC, r. 202-195 BC)\n\nEmpress Dowager Dou\n\nEmpress Dowager Wang\n\nEmpress Dowager Deng\n\nEmpress Dowager Liang (116–150), empress to Emperor Shun of Han (115–144, r. 125–144)\n\nEmpress Dowager He (d. 189), second empress consort of Emperor Ling of Han (156–189, r. 168–189)\n\nJin dynasty\n\nEmpress Wenming (217–268), wife of Sima Zhao (211–265)\n\nNorthern Wei dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Feng, empress consort of Emperor Wencheng of Northern Wei (440–465, r. 452–465)\n\nEmpress Dowager Hu, (d. 528), concubine of Emperor Xuanwu (483–515, r. 499–515)\n\nLiu Song dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Xiao Wenshou (343–423), stepmother of Emperor Wu of Liu Song (363–422, r. 420–422)\n\nTang dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Wu, more commonly known as Wu Zetian\n\nEmpress Dowager Xiao\n\nEmpress Dowager He\n\nLiao dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Xiao (d. 951?), concubine of Yelü Bei\n\nEmpress Dowager Chengtian\n\nEmpress Dowager Xiao Noujin (980–1057), concubine of Emperor Shengzong\n\nSong dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Xie (1210–1283), empress consort of Emperor Lizong of Song\n\nYuan dynasty\n\nEmpress Gi (1315–1369), one of the primary empresses of Toghon Temur\n\nQing dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Xiaoduanwen (1599–1649), consort of Hong Taiji (1592–1643), second Khan of the Later Jin dynasty (r. 1626–1636) and first Emperor of the Qin dynasty (r. 1636–1643)\n\nEmpress Dowager Xiaozhuang (1613–1688), consort of Hong Taiji\n\nEmpress Dowager Renxian (1641–1718)\n\nEmpress Dowager Cihe\n\nEmpress Dowager Chongqing\n\nEmpress Dowager Ci'an\n\nEmpress Dowager Cixi, de facto ruler of the Qing dynasty for 40 years\n\nEmpress Dowager Longyu (1868–1913), wife and empress consort of Zaitian, the Guangxu Emperor, abdicated on behalf of Puyi\n\nJapanese empress dowager\n\nFurther information: Empress of Japan#List of empress dowagers\n\nIn the complex organization of the Japanese Imperial Court, the title of \"empress dowager\" does not automatically devolve to the principal consort of an Emperor who has died. The title \"Kōtaigō\" can only be bestowed or granted by the Emperor who will have acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne.\n\nThe following were among the individuals who were granted this imperial title:\n\nEmpress Dowager Yoshiko (欣子皇太后, Yoshiko kōtaigō, 1779–1846), widow of Emperor Kōkaku\n\nEmpress Dowager Eishō (英照皇太后, Eishō kōtaigō, 1834–1898), widow of Emperor Kōmei\n\nEmpress Dowager Shōken (昭憲皇太后, Shōken kōtaigō, 1849–1914), widow of Emperor Meiji\n\nEmpress Dowager Teimei (貞明皇后, Teimei kōtaigō, 1884–1951), widow of Emperor Taishō\n\nEmpress Dowager Kōjun (香淳皇后, Kōjun kōtaigō, 1903–2000), widow of Emperor Shōwa\n\nKorean empress dowager\n\nEmpress dowager Myeongheon (1831–1903), wife and widow of Heonjong of Joseon.\n\nEurope\n\nHoly Roman dowager empresses\n\nEleonora Gonzaga, wife to Emperor Ferdinand III, was empress dowager from 1657–1686.\n\nAlthough never referred to as a dowager, Empress Matilda was controversially the Holy Roman Empress and continued to be referred to as \"empress\" long after the death of her first husband Henry V, and her subsequent remarriage.\n\nDespite having abandoned the throne of Sicily for her son Frederick II, Empress Constance widow of Henry VI retained her title as empress dowager till her death.\n\nRussian dowager empresses\n\nDowager empresses of Russia held precedence over the empress consort. This was occasionally a source of tension. For example, when Paul I was assassinated, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg), for whom this tradition was started, often took the arm of her son Tsar Alexander I at court functions and ceremonies while his wife Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) walked behind, which caused resentment on the part of the young empress. The same thing happened decades later when Emperor Alexander III died, and the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) held precedence over Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse), which put an enormous strain on their already tense relationship. The power struggle culminated when the Dowager Empress refused to hand over certain jewels traditionally associated with the Empress Consort.\n\nThere have been four dowager empresses in Russia:\n\nEmpress Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg) (1759–1828) Empress Consort of Paul I of Russia (r. 1796–1801)\n\nEmpress Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) (1779–1826) Empress Consort of Alexander I of Russia (r. 1801–1825)\n\nEmpress Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia) (1798–1860) Empress Consort of Nicholas I of Russia (r. 1825–1855)\n\nEmpress Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) (1847–1928) Empress Consort of Alexander III of Russia (r. 1881–1894)\n\nEmpress Elizabeth Alexeievna was briefly and concurrently, along with her mother in-law Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, a Dowager empress. She is therefore often forgotten as an Dowager Empress.\n\nSouth Asia\n\nIndian empresses dowager\n\nQueen-Empress Victoria (1819–1901, r. 1837–1901) was widowed in 1861, before her accession as Queen-Empress of India. Her son, her grandson and her great-grandson all died before their wives, and their widows were known as empresses dowager in this Indian context. Had George VI, the last Emperor of India, died before the independence of India was proclaimed in 1947, his widow would have been known as the dowager empress of India. However, George VI did not die until 1952, some years after India's formal independence and the renunciation of the title Emperor of India by the British monarch (which took place formally in 1948).\n\nQueen-Empress Alexandra (d. 20 Nov. 1925), widow of King-Emperor Edward VII (r. 1901–1910)\n\nQueen-Empress Mary (d. 24 Mar. 1953), widow of King-Emperor George V (r. 1910–1936)\n\nQueen-Empress Elizabeth (d. 30 Mar. 2002), widow of King-Emperor George VI (r. 1936–1947)\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nVietnamese empresses dowager\n\nNotes: The parentheses show the dates of birth and the dates of death.\n\nĐinh-Early Lê dynasties\n\nEmpress Dowager Dương Vân Nga (952–1000): In 979, her husband Emperor Đinh Bộ Lĩnh died after an assassination, her son Prince Đinh Toàn ascended to the throne, she became empress dowager and handled all political matters. But later she dethroned her son and ceded the throne to Lê Đại Hành and married him. Once again she took the title of empress consort. Because she was an empress twice with two different emperors, she is called \"Hoàng hậu hai triều\" (Two-dynasty Empress).\n\nLý dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Thượng Dương (?–1073): While she could not give birth to any sons, her husband's concubine Lady Ỷ Lan gave birth to a prince, called Lý Càn Đức. After husband's death, she became empress dowager and declared that she will \"buông rèm nhiếp chính\" (regent) for the new seven-year-old emperor, but the mother of the new emperor Lady Dowager Ỷ Lan vehemently opposed and forced her to the death. Her tenure of being an empress dowager is one year.\n\nEmpress Dowager Ỷ Lan (c. 1044–1117): After dethroning and killing the empress dowager, she became empress dowager and kept all political powers\n\nEmpress Dowager Chiêu Linh (?–1200): Empress of Emperor Lý Thần Tông. Her son was appointed as crown prince, but later he was dethroned from the seat of crown prince to a normal prince due to an event. Her husband's concubine Lady Đỗ Thụy Châu gave birth to a prince and he was appointed as crown prince later. After her husband's death, the crown prince ascended to the throne, she became empress dowager.\n\nEmpress Dowager Đỗ Thụy Châu: After her son ascended to the throne, she became the co-empress dowager with Empress Dowager Chiêu Linh.\n\nEmpress Dowager An Toàn (?–1226): She was famous for misusing authority during the reign of her son Emperor Lý Huệ Tông. Her daughter-in-law, Empress Trần Thị Dung joined Trần Thủ Độ plotting to overthrow the Lý dynasty and replace by Trần dynasty. Trần Thủ Độ forced her son to abdicate and be a monk at the pagoda, her son did as Trần Thủ Độ told and ceded the throne to her granddaughter Lý Chiêu Hoàng, who is the only empress of Vietnamese history, thus, she became grand empress dowager. But later Trần Thủ Độ forced Lý Chiêu Hoàng to get married with his seven-year-old nephew Trần Cảnh and ceded the throne to Trần Cảnh. At that point, An Toàn was no longer an empress dowager.\n\nEmpress Dowager Trần Thị Dung (?–1259): She became empress dowager after her daughter Lý Chiêu Hoàng ascended to the throne. But later, Lý Chiêu Hoàng ceded the throne to her husband Trần Cảnh. Trần Thị Dung was no longer empress dowager.\n\nTrần dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Tuyên Từ (?–1318): A concubine and younger sister-in-law of Emperor Trần Nhân Tông, she is younger sister of the proper Empress Bảo Thánh. In 1293, Emperor Trần Nhân Tông ceded the throne to his son with Empress Bảo Thánh, Trần Anh Tông, some months later her sister Grand Empress Bảo Thánh died, she became the only surviving consort of Grand Emperor Trần Nhân Tông. 1308, Grand Emperor Trần Nhân Tông died, she became empress dowager. 1314, Emperor Trần Anh Tông ceded the throne to his son Trần Minh Tông, she became grand empress dowager.\n\nNguyễn dynasty\n\nEmpress Dowager Từ Dụ (1810–1902),born Phạm Thị Hằng, was a Vietnamese empress, the wife of Emperor Thiệu Trị (1807–1847, r. 1841–1847) and mother of Emperor Tự Đức.\n\nEmpress Dowager Từ Cung (1890–1980), mother of the last Vietnamese Emperor Bảo Đại.\n\nSee also"
