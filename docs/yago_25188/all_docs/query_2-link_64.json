        "text": "Ever since, students of the end of the imperial dynasty have puzzled over why she appeared so willing to do so. Now Jia Yinghua, a 60-year-old historian and former government official, has discovered the answer: she was bribed with 20,000 taels, or 1700lb, of silver, and warned she might end up being beheaded if she refused.\n\n\"What happened is so sensitive it has taken more than 100 years before it can be revealed,\" said Mr Jia, who assembled his latest work, The Extraordinary Life of the Last Emperor, from the secret archives at Zhongnanhai, the Chinese leadership compound, and from interviews with relations of the imperial courtiers.\n\nPuyi, whose life was featured in the film The Last Emperor by Bernardo Bertolucci, is still a figure of public fascination in China. \"He was unique,\" said Mr Jia. \"He lived through three dynasties. The entire tumult of China's last century can be summed up in him. He went from emperor to gardener, and in his last years he hung a picture of himself with Chairman Mao on his bedstead.\"\n\nDowager Longyu was Puyi's adoptive mother\n\n\"The time of his abdication was a time of corrupting and buying government officials,\" said Mr Jia.\n\nThe imperial court in the last days of the Qing dynasty was a shadow of its former self. Foreign countries, particularly Britain, had humbled the Qing in battle, carved out rich territories and extracted huge payments.\n\nOutside the Forbidden City, uprisings were sweeping the land as citizens called for a republic.\n\nIn order to stabilise the situation, the court appointed Yuan Shikai, a general with influence over a powerful northern army, to be prime minister.\n\nYuan Shikai played a key role in forcing the abdication of Puyi (Rex Features)\n\nBut according to Mr Jia, Mr Yuan was determined to remove the last emperor from power, by turns cajoling, threatening and then bribing key figures at court.\n\nNot only did he bribe Puyi's adoptive mother, but he also corrupted her closest eunuch, Xiao Dezheng, and Prince Yikuang, one of the most powerful men at court, said Mr Jia.\n\nThe eunuch, meanwhile, received a similar sum, equivalent to more than Â£1 billion in today's money. He used it to build a house in Tianjin stuffed with treasures looted from the palace.\n\nIn return, the eunuch told the Dowager Empress that she would be rich if she signed the abdication papers. \"And if she refused, she would end up like Louis XVI during the French Revolution: beheaded,\" said Mr Jia.\n\nMr Yuan did not stop there. He put pressure on the court by masterminding a series of threatening letters.\n\n\"He had a good relationship with the Russian embassy and he asked them to write a letter saying if you do not sign the papers, the Western powers would force it through anyway,\" said Mr Jia, citing the archives at Zhongnanhai.\n\nMr Yuan also secretly authored a telegram from 44 army commanders calling for the empire to dissolve, according to the notes of his aide, Zeng Yujun.\n\nAfter abdicating, Puyi was forced to leave the Forbidden City and briefly became a puppet ruler for the Japanese in a corner of North East China that they had conquered."
