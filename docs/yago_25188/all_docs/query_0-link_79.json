        "text": "Ng Chin-fung and Nam Fung to perform with Chin Fung Cantonese Opera Troupe in December\n\n****************************************************\n\nRenowned Cantonese opera performers Ng Chin-fung and Nam Fung will lead the Chin Fung Cantonese Opera Troupe in performing three classic repertoires - \"Lust is the Worst Vice\", \"Time to Go Home\" and \"Emperor Guangxu Paying Homage to Concubine Zhen at Night\" - in December.\n\n\"Lust is the Worst Vice\" will be staged at 7.30pm on December 5 (Friday) at the Auditorium of Tsuen Wan Town Hall. The story begins when Huang Zinian composes a poem to warn his stepmother, Madam Chen, after discovering she has committed a misdeed. Irritated by Zinian, Chen blinds him with poison and drives him away. Ziliang, sympathising with his elder brother Zinian, helps him by secretly stealing some property from the family. Unfortunately, this is discovered by Chen who accuses Zinian of theft. Learning of the arrest of her fiancÂˆm, Zeng Chuyun approaches the judge, Zhang Dachuan, to redress the wrongs done to Zinian. However, being fond of Zeng and jealous of Zinian, Zhang tortures Zinian cruelly in order to extort a confession. Zhang is regretful for what he has done after being rebuked by Zeng and agrees to retry the case.\n\nThe second performance, \"Time to Go Home\", will be staged at 7.30pm on December 6 (Saturday) at the Auditorium of Yuen Long Theatre. The story begins with Wen Pingsheng, who is in love with Zhao Pinniang. Wen's cousins decide to devise a plot to separate the couple. They deceive Wen's mother, Lady Fang, into believing that Zhao's illness will endanger her husband's life. Fang compels her daughter-in-law to live apart from her son. Unwilling to see Wen torn between his mother and her, Zhao makes a sacrifice by feigning death. Wen returns home after defeating the enemy. When he finds his wife's tombstone, he is overwhelmed with grief and faints. Unable to bear parting from him, Zhao tries to comfort her unconscious husband. In the meantime, the cousins arrive and confess their plot. Wen reunites with Zhao in the end.\n\nThe final performance, \"Emperor Guangxu Paying Homage to Concubine Zhen at Night\", will be staged at 7.30pm on December 17 (Wednesday) at the Auditorium of Sha Tin Town Hall. The story takes place towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. The young Guangxu ascends the throne, but the real power is held by the Empress Dowager Cixi. Guangxu loves the Imperial Concubine Zhen and wants to make her an empress. Cixi objects, and makes her own niece Longyu an empress. Powerless to resist, the frustrated Guangxu can only heap affection on Lady Zhen. Outside the palace, the country is so weak that Western powers are foraging uncontested. Visionary Chinese patriots advocate strengthening the country's navy to ward off any foreign attacks from the sea. However, Cixi siphons off funds for the navy to build the Yiheyuan Palace. This angers Guangxu, and the people's angry protests begin to boil over. In a secret plot with Lady Zhen, Guangxu summons Weng Tonghe and Kang Youwei to carry out political reforms. They secretly send Yuan Shikai to wrest military power from Ronglu in Tianjin, planning to return to the capital with an army to overthrow Cixi's despotic rule so Guangxu can take back his ruling power. But the plot fails due to Yuan's betrayal. Weng et al are executed, while Guangxu and Lady Zhen are put under house arrest. With the help of eunuchs, the two communicate with each other secretly. When the army of the Eight-Nation Alliance marches into the capital, Cixi flees with Guangxu. Before they leave, she orders Lady Zhen to throw herself into a well. When the national crisis is over, Guangxu returns by moonlight to the well where Lady Zhen killed herself, secretly mourning for her while reiterating his love.\n\nThe performance brings together many renowned Cantonese opera virtuosos. In addition to Ng Chin-fung and Nam Fung the cast also includes Liu Kwok-sum, Man Po-sum, Wan Yuk-yu, Ko Lai, Tam Wing-lun, Yam Dan-fung, Chan Leung-sing and Wong Sze-long.\n\nThe performances by Chin Fung Cantonese Opera Troupe are presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. Tickets ranging from $100 to $280 are now available at URBTIX. Half-price tickets are available for senior citizens aged 60 or above, people with disabilities and their minders, full-time students and Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) recipients (limited tickets for full-time students and CSSA recipients are available on a first come, first served basis.)\n\nA post-performance talk (conducted in Cantonese) will be held at 7.30pm on December 29 (Monday) at AC2, Level 4, Administration Building, Hong Kong Cultural Centre.
