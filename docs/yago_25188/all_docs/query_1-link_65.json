        "text": "Lying at the center of Beijing, the Forbidden City, called Gu Gong in Chinese, used to be the imperial palace of the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911). It is called the Palace Museum now. It lies 1 kilometer north of the Tian'anmen Square, with its south gate, the Gate of Devine Might (Shenwumen), facing the Jingshan Park.\n\n960 meters long from south to north and 750 meters wide from east to west, the world's largest palace complex covers a floor space of 724,250 square meters, having 9,999 buildings. The rectangular city is encircled in a 52-meter-wide, 6-meter-deep moat and a 10-meter-high, 3,400-meter-long city wall which has one gate on each side. There are four unique and delicate Jiao Lou (corner towers) overlooking the city inside and outside on the four corners.\n\nGenerally, it was divided into two parts, the northern half, or the Outer Court where emperors executed their supreme power over the nation and the southern half, or the Inner Court where they lived with their royal family. Until 1924 when the last emperor Puyi was driven out of the Inner Court, 14 emperors of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and 10 emperors of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) had reigned here. Being the imperial palace for about 500 years, it houses numerous rare treasures and curiosities. It was listed by the UN as World Cultural Heritage in 1987 and is the hottest tourist magnets in China.\n\nConstruction of the palace complex started in 1407, the 5th year of the Yongle reign of the third emperor of the Ming Dynasty, and was completed 14 years later in 1420. It was said that a million workers including 100,000 artisans were driven into the long-term hard labor. Stones needed were quarried from Fangshan, suburb of Beijing. It was said a well was dug along the road every 50 meters in order to pour water onto the road in winter to slide huge stones on ice into the city. Huge amount of timbers and other materials were all freighted from faraway provinces. Ancient Chinese people fully displayed their wisdom in building the Forbidden City. Take the grand red city wall for example, the ladder shaped wall has an 8.6 meters wide bottom and a 6.66 meters wide top. The shape of the city wall totally frustrate attempt to climb onto the wall. The bricks of the wall are said to be made from white lime and glutinous rice while the cement is made from glutinous rice and egg whites, and these incredible materials make the wall extraordinarily strong.\n\nSince yellow is the symbol of the royal family, it is the dominant color in the Forbidden City. Roofs are built with yellow glazed tiles; decorations in the palace are painted yellow; even the bricks on the ground are made yellow in special process. However, there is one exception. Wenyuange, the royal library, has a black roof. The reason is that it was believed black represented water then and could extinguish fire.\n\nWumen (The Meridian Gate)\n\nThe Meridian Gate, Wumen in Chinese, is the southern entrance of the Forbidden City. Since Chinese emperors believed that they were sons of Heaven and should live in the center of the universe, and they believed the Meridian Line went through the Forbidden City, the gate was named so. The grand gate, consisting of five openings, is the largest gate and main gate of the Forbidden City, 35.6 meters high and surmounted by five pavilions, named Wufenglou (Five Phoenix Tower). In Five Phoenix Tower, there are drums that were used to announce emperors' departure to the Temple of Heaven and bells which to announce their departure to the Ancestral Temple. Both toll to announce that the emperor was going to receive his ministers in Taihedian (Hall of Supreme Harmony).\n\nThere were strict rules to follow when people enter the Forbidden City. Entering through the central opening was the emperors' exclusive privilege, while their empresses were allowed to go through the opening once on their wedding day. The top three in the national examinations, presided by emperors on the final stage, would be honored to strut through the arched hole after receiving emperors' interview. The east opening was for the ministers while the west opening was for the royal family. The other openings were for petty officials.Ordinary people were forbidden to enter the city.\n\nIn the ancient time, emperors would bestow foods to ministers on days of important Chinese solar terms. On the first day of October on solar calendar every year, emperors would issue next year' calendar. After wars, Emperors would receive captives themselves here. Also on the left side of the Imperial Way, which goes through the central opening, baculine penalty would be executed on those who offended emperors.\n\nTaihemen (Gate of Supreme Harmony)\n\nBehind Wumen (the Meridian Gate), one can see five bridges and the courtyard beyond. Further north in the center, it is Taihemen, the Gate of Supreme Harmony.\n\nThe river is called the Inner Golden River and the bridges called the Inner Golden River Bridges. The central bridge is reserved for emperors exclusively. The two flanking it are reserved for royal family members while the two outside are for ordinary officials. The bridges are well decorated with marble balustrades carved with motifs of dragon and phoenix. The river serves as fire hydrant as well as decorations.\n\nThe courtyard beyond covers a space of 10,000 square meters. There are no trees on the square since in ancient China emperors considered themselves Son of Heaven, born to reign over the country, so they should occupy the highest position. Nothing was allowed to overwhelm the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the highest building in the Forbidden City and trees were no exception.\n\nThe ground in the palace was laid in a very special way -- seven layers lengthwise and eight layers crosswise, totaling fifteen layers to protect assassins from digging tunnels into the palace. And the bricks were specially made to sound nice when walking on. The rooms on each side were said to serve as warehouses for storing such items as fur, porcelain, silver, tea, silk, satin and clothes.\n\nTaihemen, north of the square, is the main gate of the Outer Court and fairly grand. The gate is guarded by a couple of gilded bronze lions which were aimed to show imperial dignity. The east one is male, with its front right paw put on a ball, meaning imperial power extended worldwide. The lioness on the west puts its front left paw on a lion cub, indicating prosperously growing family.\n\nThe gate is an important place where emperors' wedding ceremonies were usually held.\n\nTaihedian (Hall of Supreme Harmony)\n\nEntering Taihemen, you will see Taihedian (Hall of Supreme Harmony) across the spacious square, which covers a space of 30,000 square meters. Sitting on a three-tier marble terrace, the grandest timber framework ever in China will overwhelm anyone.\n\nThe hall was first built in 1406 and later repaired many times. As the heart of the Forbidden City, the so-called Golden Carriage Palace, used to be the place where emperors received high officials and practiced their rule over the nation. Also grand ceremonies would be held to celebrate new emperor's ascending to the throne, emperors' birthdays and wedding ceremonies and other important occasions such as Winter Solstice, the Chinese New Year and dispatching generals into war fields.\n\nAlong the three-tier terrace stairs, there are 18 bronze Dings, a kind of ancient Chinese vessel, to represent 18 provinces of the nation then. On the terrace, which was luxuriously balustraded, a bronze crane and a bronze tortoise can be seen. They were put there to expect everlasting rule and longevity. The marble Rigui, an ancient timer in the east and the Jialiang, an ancient measuring vessel in the west were put there to show that emperors were just and fair. In front of the hall, there are a couple of gilded bronze vats, which were used to hold water in case of fire.\n\nSince the Hall of Supreme Harmony was the symbol of imperial power, it was the highest structure in the Ming and Qing dynasties in the nation, no other buildings allowed higher than it. The heavily glazed hall is 35.02 meters high and 37.44 if rooftop decoration counted, and 63.96 meters in width and 37.2 meters in length respectively. There are totally 72 pillars standing in six rows to support the roof. Gates and windows were embossed with clouds and dragons.\n\nInside of the hall, the floor was paved with special bricks which were fired long and then soaked in tung oil to be polished. As a symbol of imperial power, the sandalwood throne, standing on a two-meter high platform, is located in the center of the hall and enclosed within six thick gold-lacquered pillars painted with dragons. The golden throne is carved with dragons all over. Around the throne stand two bronze cranes, an elephant-shaped incense burner and tripods in the shape of mythical beasts. The hall is heavily painted with dragons, having an aura of solemnity and mystery. In the middle of the ceiling is the design of two dragons playing with pearls. They were made of glass and painted with mercury. The pearl was said to be able to detect any usurper of the imperial power. If anyone who was not the descendant of the Emperor Huang Di usurped the throne, it would drop down and strike him to death.\n\nZhonghedian (Hall of Central Harmony)\n\nZhonghedian, the Hall of Central Harmony, was originally built in 1420 and restored in 1627 and again 1765. It is square in shape rather than rectangular as the other two in the Outer Court. It is the smallest in the three main halls in the Outer Court. It served as a restroom when emperors were going to present ceremonies held in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on their way there. Here they would interview their ministers of rite. Annually before their departure to important sacrifice rites held at Temple of Heaven, Temple of Earth and etc., emperors would browse elegiac addresses in the hall. Before their departure to the Temple of Ancestor Farmer, they would also inspect seeds and farming tools they would use in the ceremony. In the Qing Dynasty, it was prescribed that the imperial genealogy should be revised every ten years. The ceremony of presenting the revision to the emperor and His Majesty's approving would also be held here.\n\nInside of the hall, visitors can see there is one golden unicorn on each side of the throne in the center of the hall. The couple of golden unicorns, called luduan in Chinese, were believed capable of traveling 9,000 kilometers a day and speaking many languages. Since the divine beast foresees faraway, it was put beside the throne to indicate emperors' wisdom and brilliantness. They used to be sandalwood burners. Beside the throne, there are also two sedan chairs, which were used as emperors' vehicles to shuttle around in the Forbidden City.\n\nBaohedian (Hall of Preserving Harmony)\n\nBaohedian, the Hall of Preserving Harmony, sits on the northern end of the three-tiered marble terrace, similar in style but a bit smaller than the Hall of Supreme Harmony and larger than the Hall of Central Harmony. It was first built in 1420, rebuilt in 1625 and renovated in 1765. In the Ming Dynasty, emperors usually change their clothes here before ceremonies of conferring empress or crown prince. In the Qing Dynasty, imperial banquets usually would be given here. To celebrate a princess's marriage, emperors would invite high officials, the bridegroom and his father, and their relatives who served the imperial government to a banquet. Every year, on New Year's Eve, banquets would be held to feast and honor margraves, Mongol princes and civil and military officials.\n\nIn 1789, middle of the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Qianlong removed Palace Examination, the highest level and final stage of the nationwide imperial examination system, from the Hall of Supreme Harmony to this hall. Emperors would read papers of the top ten candidates to honor them.\n\nIn rainy days, visitors will have chance to see the spectacular scene of a thousand dragons draining water. There are 1,412 marble stone dragon heads under the columns of the three-tiered terrace on which the three main halls are seated. Chinese artisans smartly combined drainage system with architectural art. Once you get a chance to the Forbidden City, please notice the holes in dragons' mouths. However, the ones in the corners have no holes.\n\nHuge Stone Carving\n\nBehind the Hall of Preserving Harmony, in the middle of the stairway, is a huge piece of marble carving of nine dragons playing with pearls. It is the biggest stone sculpture in the Forbidden City. It was originally sculpted in the Ming Dynasty and re-sculpted in the Qing Dynasty. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, anyone who was caught touching this holy stone would be punished by death penalty! The huge stone was hauled into the palace all the way from Fangshan, about 70 kilometers away from Beijing city proper. The hard transportation took about a month and 20,000 men and thousands mules and horses. The 16.57 meters long, 3.07 meters wide and 1.7 meters thick stone weighs about 250 tons.\n\nQianqingmen (Gate of Celestial Purity)\n\nQianqingmen (Gate of Celestial Purity) is the main gate of the Inner Court. In front of the gate, there is a square which runs 200 meters long from east to west and extends only 30 meters from north to south. The square separates the Outer Court and the Inner Court and integrates them.\n\nIn the Qing Dynasty, it was the place where emperors, sitting on the throne set in the middle of the gate, heard reports and made decisions. The huts standing left and right are duty rooms and waiting rooms for ministers waiting for interviews, etc.\n\nOutside of the gate, against the red wall are ten gilded bronze vats, shining.

Every item similar with that of the Hall of Supreme Harmony is smaller than the latter. However, it is the largest structure in the Inner Court since it is superior to any other structures in the Inner Court. It was built in 1420 and rebuilt in 1798. Ming emperors and the first two Qing emperors live inside the palace and attended to daily state affairs. They also read, signed documents, interviewed ministers and envoys. Banquets and rites occasionally would be held here too. In 1722 and 1785, Banquet for A Thousand Seniors was held here twice. Old men over 60 from the nation presented the events.\n\nMoreover, in the Qing Dynasty, no matter where the emperor died, his coffin should be set in the palace for a few days to hold memorial ceremonies. Later the coffin would be moved to Jingshan, and then buried in the mausoleum on a selected day.\n\nIn the middle of the palace, the throne is seated on stairs, surrounded by decorations like cloisonne incense burners, long red candles, and big mirrors, which were placed beside the throne to ward off evil spirits. On the columns surrounding, there are two pairs of couplets written by Qing emperors. Over the throne hangs a plaque engraved with four Chinese characters, which were written by Emperor Yongzheng and means Justice and Brightness. From Emperor Yongzheng, crown princes' name would be written on duplicate documents and a copy would be hidden in a box behind the plaque. The other copy would be carried by the emperor.

The two timers used to be the reference of the Drum Tower and the Bell Tower. In addition, the palace also holds 25 imperial seals. Since Emperor Qianlong hoped that the Qing Dynasty could last 25 reigns to exceed the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-256BC), the longest dynasty in China. However history disappointed him, the Qing Dynasty only lasted ten reigns.\n\nKunninggong (Palace of Earthly Tranquility)\n\nKunninggong (Palace of Earthly Tranquility) was first built in 1420 and restored in 1655.

However, in the Qing Dynasty, the bridal emperor and empress only lived in the East Warmth Chamber of this palace for a few days. Later the emperor would move to the Hall of Mental Cultivation. The empress would move to other palace. The emperor's bridal chamber (the East Warmth Chamber) was painted red and there were palace lamps pasted with red Double Happiness to heat up happy atmosphere. The delicate and exquisite embroidered bed curtain and quilt both features a hundred playing children. The emperors all expected more children to show imperial family's prosperity.\n\nIn the West Warmth Chamber, sacrifice would be held every day.

In the center of the front hall, emperors summoned their ministers to consult state affairs. On the bookshelf behind the throne, there used to be books prepared for a new emperor to show him how to reign. In the East Warmth Chamber, the notorious Empress Dowager Cixi attended to state affairs behind curtain here. The chamber is now displayed same as her time. She ruled China behind a yellow curtain for 48 years here under her policy of quislism. In the West Warmth Chamber, emperors from Yongzheng to Xianfeng interviewed their ministers to consult or give secret orders. The small house in the west end is named Sanxitang (Hall of Three Rare Treasures), since Emperor Qianlong collected and held three outstanding calligraphy masterpieces by Wang Xizhi, Wang Xianzhi, and Wang Xun, three masters in Chinese calligraphy. There still hang plaques written by Emperor Qianlong.\n\nThe lobby extending between the center of the front hall and the rear hall connects them. There are five imperial bedrooms, one in the center and the other four flanking it. The courtyards east and west of the rear hall, are temporary lodgings of empresses and concubines respectively when they were granted interview and bed time with Emperors. They were forbidden to come here without the emperors' permission.\n\nOn February12th, 1912, under the heavy blow of the Revolution of 1911 led by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, Emperor Dowager Longyu presided over the final cabinet meeting of the Qing Dynasty, and was forced to decide abdication and sign the imperial abdication declaration here.

Every palace has its own courtyard, the front hall and the rear hall, and annexes. They were the residences for emperors' women. Since in feudal China, emperors were polygamists, it was exaggerated that an emperor had 3,000 wives. Since polygamied emperors usually had at least dozens of ladies, these palaces were necessary to lodge them.\n\nChuxiugong (Palace of Gathering Elegance) is the most famous one among the six since the notorious Empress Dowager Cixi lived here for a long period. When hierarch Cixi was in power, although she was behind the throne, she spent huge amount of money to decorate the palace, making it the most luxurious one to celebrate her 50th birthday in 1884.
