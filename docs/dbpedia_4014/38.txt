One day in 1944 at the Birkenau concentration camp in German-occupied Poland, Ilse and Ruth Scheuer saw their father for the last time.

“You two are young, maybe you will survive,” Jakob Scheuer told them. He raised his hands toward their heads and, in a voice choked with emotion, gave them a Hebrew blessing:

“May God bless you and watch over you. May God shine His face toward you and show you favor.”

Mr. Scheuer was soon gassed. Ilse, 20, and Ruth, 17, were separated from their mother and never saw her again. Their brother, Ernst, died at another concentration camp, in Germany, shortly before the end of the war.

The sisters survived. They remained close, each marrying other German refugees, and for decades lived near each other in Birmingham, Ala., where they died 11 days apart — Ilse Scheuer Nathan at her home on Aug. 23 at 98, Ruth Scheuer Siegler in a hospital on Sept. 3 at 95.

“Aunt Ilse’s passing made my mother ready to go,” Dan Siegler, one of Mrs. Siegler’s two sons, said in a telephone interview. “She had a will to live, but she was tired.”
