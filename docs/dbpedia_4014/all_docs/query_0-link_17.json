Described in the press as a \"Death Ship\", a \"wreck practically falling apart\", it managed to reach the shores of Palestine despite the British Navy embargo and saved hundreds of lives, including the life of my mother, Toni Katz.\n\nThe Dora\n\nPhoto: Het Volk, July 14 1939\n\nThis page was originally based on Chaya Brasz's article \"Dodenschip Dora; Een oude kolenboot redde honderden Joden ondanks Nederlandse tegenwerking\" (\"The \"Death Ship\" Dora: the coal ship that saved hundreds of Jews\"), which has been condensed and edited for clarity. Additional information was gathered from several books and online articles listed in the reference section; from articles published in the contemporary press and finally, from the recollections of my mother and from organizers and passengers who sailed on the Dora.\n\nMossad LeAliyah Bet\n\nFollowing Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the increasingly harsh anti-Jewish measures in Nazi Germany made the need for Jewish immigration more and more urgent. At the same time, it became increasingly difficult for refugees to obtain visas for any destination. As for Palestine, then under British mandate, Great Britain announced in late 1938 that it would reduce Jewish migration to Palestine to a total of 75,000 over the next 5 years.\n\nIn response to the newly enacted restrictions implemented by the British government with its \"White Paper\", a new branch of the Haganah, Mossad LeAliyah Bet, was created in late 1938, with the goal of organizing illegal immigration to Palestine.\n\nAn organization was quickly put in place in several European countries to support this effort, with the center of operations set in Paris. This organization had to raise funds, collect intelligence, acquire (i.e. charter) ships, transform and equip ships to transport large numbers of immigrants: install beds and other necessities, set up sophisticated radio systems, supply them with large quantities of food, water and fuel, hire crews, transport immigrants to ports of departure, arrange sailing permits, all of this while avoiding the suspicion of local authorities and evading detection by the British Navy.\n\nIn its first year of operations, Mossad LeAliyah Bet managed to launch 10 ships from Mediterranean and Black Sea ports and bring so-called \"illegal\" immigrants to the shores of Palestine despite the British embargo.\n\nSeveral groups provided operational and logistical support through each stage. First were \"guides\" (madrichim), who accompanied the ships during the crossings. They were young people who had gained sailing experience on rowboats on the River Yarkon, and had to be ready to act as emergency captains whenever problems arose with the official crews, often veteran Greek seamen. One such sailor was Amiram Shochat, who would take part in the voyage of the Dora and was by then already a veteran of these illegal expeditions.\n\nAnother group consisted of members of Shai (\"Sherut Yediot\"), the Haganah Intelligence Service, who gathered information about the British police anti-immigration plans, often from Jews who worked in their offices, and supplied the Mossad with the routes to evade the British.\n\nAnother crucial group was the Haganah radio communication wing, with members operating on the ships, at disembarkation points, and at the Haganah center in Tel Aviv. With efficient transmitters and receivers installed on each ship sailing to Palestine, they were able to coordinate between ship and shore, allowing the vessels to receive precise information on British naval movements and dodge the coastal patrols. Temporary communication stations were also set up on the landing beaches to guide the ships.\n\nLastly, there were the several disembarkation crews who brought the refugees from ships to shore, then helped them fan out to various settlements, while armed groups were on the lookout for the British forces. Several Haganah units were involved in the landings. Disembarkation was handled by Palyam units with seagoing experience.\n\nGenerally, the ships approached as close as possible to shore, allowing those who knew how to swim to make their own way to shore. The others were carried in boats or on the backs of helpers. Palmach units guarded the beach, while Gadna (Youth Corps) and HIM (Guard Corps, composed of older Haganah members) patrolled the wider area, and dispersed the immigrants among different Jewish settlements. Since success depended on preventing discovery by the British, great importance was placed on how quickly the immigrants were swallowed up in the settlements. In many cases, the Haganah supplied them with the appropriate identity papers.\n\nThe Refugee Situation in the Netherlands\n\nSince Hitler's takeover of power in Germany in 1933, the Netherlands had taken in approximately 15,000 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria. After Kristallnacht at the end of 1938, the Dutch government allowed 150 chalutzim to enter the country, on condition that they would leave the country within a year. By that time, there were a little over 1,000 young people in Hachshara - agrarian training in preparation for emigration to Palestine - in the Netherlands. Gertrude van Tijn, the head of the Emigration Department of the Committee for Jewish Refugees, reported to the Joint (American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, aka JDC) at the end of November that approximately 4,000 legal refugees had entered the Netherlands since Kristallnacht. By February 1939, she estimated that there were 23,000 German-Jewish refugees in the Netherlands, while the government put the number to 30,000.\n\nTwo organizations provided support to Jewish refugees from Germany: the Deventer Association (\"Vereniging tot Vakopleiding van Palestina Pioniers\": \"The Association for Professional Training of Palestine Pioneers\"), and the Committee for Jewish Refugees. They obtained entrance visas for young refugees, then placed them among Dutch farmers and in the Werkdorp (\"work village\") Nieuwesluis in Wieringer , Werkdorp Wieringermeer , where they received agricultural and professional training for immigration to Palestine.\n\nFollowing the sudden influx of German refugees in Holland after Kristallnacht and the decision of the British Government to pressure the Greek Government to halt immigration to Palestine, the Haganah decided to create a new immigration route in Northern Europe. As early as December 1938 or January 1939, they started to discuss the possibility of shipping a group of 300 chalutzim from Holland, 150 from Belgium, and another 100 from France from a North European port.\n\nSeveral agents of Mossad leAliyah Bet arrived from Palestine to Europe to organize \"Operation North\" (×××¦×¢ ××¦×¤××), the clandestine departure of German Jewish refugees from Holland. In charge of the operation was Gideon Rufer (Gideon Raphael), in charge of logistics was Gustav Horn from Kibbutz Hazorea. From the central office of Mossad leAliyah Bet office in Paris, Shmarya Tzameret, a 23 year-old American-born member of Kibbutz Beit Hashita, was tasked with organizing the Dora trip. Other agents involved in the planning of the operation and purchase of the Dora included Ze'ev Shind, Yehuda Berginski, Danny Sheind, Amiram Shochat and Zvi Spector, who would lead the Dora during the trip.\n\nCopenhagen: June - July 1939\n\nMossad officials, led by Yehuda Berginski, spent several months looking for a suitable ship that could sail from the North Sea, through the Atlantic Ocean and across the Mediterranean up to Palestine with hundreds of passengers.\n\nThey eventually found a Greek family willing to embark on the adventure: Pierre and Constantin Atychides, two Greek brothers who had previous smuggling experience during the Spanish Civil War. They would purchase a ship (with Mossad money), equip it and sail it all the way to Palestine.\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations, Gideon Ruffer and Shmarya Tzameret finally arranged the purchase of the SS Tjaldur in Copenhagen on June 21st, 1939.\n\nThe Tjaldur\n\nBuilt in 1898 in Glasgow under the name VEGA, then renamed Tjaldur in 1904, it was a relatively small steamer (584 gross tons, 199 feet by 30 feet, 11.5 knots) that had previously sailed between the ports of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. Originally a passenger ship, it had later been converted into a merchant ship that transported various goods, including cattle. However, it still held a certificate to transport passengers and was deemed suitable for the operation as its mechanics were in good shape.\n\nAfter the purchase, the ship was renamed the Dora and would sail under Panamanian flag. In Copenhagen, it was outfitted to transport passengers by adding 175 iron bunk beds on multiple levels, life jackets, a second kosher kitchen, lavatories, and showers. On the deck, a wooden room was constructed to accommodate a doctor, a nurse, and a small hospital. The engines were cleaned, and a sophisticated radio system was installed that would help communications with the Haganah headquarters.\n\nDuring the outfitting the ship, disputes with the crew and tensions between the Dutch and the Palestinians emerged, posing a potential threat to the operation. At a critical juncture, Chaim Weizmann, the Zionist leader, had to intervene and restore peace among the organizers.\n\nIn July, following approximately three weeks of renovations and repairs, the Dora was finally ready and departed from Copenhagen, bound for Amsterdam.\n\nJust as the Dora started to move, the captain's son, who was supposed to conduct the voyage on behalf of the ship's owners, tripped and broke his leg, so the Dora had to return to Copenhagen so he could be taken to a hospital. After the delay caused by this mishap, the Dora finally left Copenhagen, passing through the Kiel Canal, which was under Nazi control. .\n\nAs the Dora left, Tzameret and Costa took a train to Antwerp to hire additional crew and purchase more lifeboats. On his end, Gideon Rufer announced that the pioneers in Amsterdam were ready to go. Once the Dora arrived in Amsterdam, the plan was to get more coal and food and be ready to leave in a few hours without being noticed.\n\nIn a closed meeting of Hechalutz members from the work village of Wieringermeer, seventy-three candidates had learned that they had been selected to leave via illegal aliyah and would sail in nine days. In preparation for their voyage, they had been moved to temporary accommodations in Beverwijk, Assendelft, and Heemskerk, small villages close to Amsterdam, where they were to remain in hiding until their departure.\n\nThe trip, first discussed in December 1938, and in planning for half a year , had been delayed for so long that Shmarya Tzameret had to reassure the Dutch Government that the chalutzim would soon leave Holland as planned.\n\nIn Antwerp, the situation was worse: 150 people who had crossed the Belgian border illegally had been there for more than six weeks. The police arrested them every day, after which they were released, because they promised they to leave the next day, as soon as the ship would enter the harbor. Around the same time, the Belgian government passed a law to the effect that illegal refugees had to be sent back.\n\nDavid Cohen, the Chairman of the Refugee Committee, was kept in the dark about the plans for the Dora because he was known to disapprove illegal activities. Other members and associates of the Committee however, such as Gertrude van Tijn, were willing to cross the line into illegality, and would provide their help and support throughout the entire duration of the operation. Since funds from the Joint could not be used for \"illegal\" enterprises, Gertrude's Dutch associates fronted the Â£3,000 (approximately $240,000 in 2018) needed to cover expenses for the trip.\n\nAmsterdam: July 13 - July 16\n\nThe Dora arrived in the Amsterdam harbor on Thursday July 13th. Gideon Rufer went to the shipbroker on the Geldersekade canal to purchase the provisions needed for the trip. He took along with him Flip Cohen, a young Dutch passenger who spoke Hebrew to be his translator.\n\nUri Kochba (Walter Koch, head of the Hechalutz movement) said:\n\n\"I was sent to the bakery, and had them bake special kosher bread that would stay good for a long time. We* ate that onboard until it became moldy. After that, we switched to biscuits.\"\n\nNote: *the source for the quote must be incorrect. As far as I know, Uri Kochba did not board the Dora. He was arrested in the Netherlands in 1940. However, others have documented that the passengers did survive on biscuits and salty water towards the end of the trip.\n\nThis is when he met Amiram Shochat for the first time, one of the three people from the Haganah who had organized the trip of the Dora. Amiram warned him in Hebrew: \"Don't talk to anyone in the crew\". The Danish crew didn't know about the illegal nature of the trip, and were not supposed to know.\n\nAccording to Yekutiel Fekete, the crew was composed as follows: The owner and captain of the ship was a 70-year-old Greek who hated the English and claimed \"The British Empire will collapse and the English will go back to being fishermen and coal miners. This will be their fate.\". Maybe his hatred for the British was part of the reason he agreed to serve on the Dora. The first officer was a younger Greek driven by greed, who had brought his wife on a voyage. The second officer was named Danny, a hardworking man who did all the work and treated us and the immigrants well. The third and fourth officers were Amiram Shochat from Tel Aviv, for whom this was the third voyage, and Zvi Spector from Jerusalem, who was on his first mission. The official wireless was a Spanish exile from the Civil War, while Yekutiel Fekete was the wireless operator in charge of connecting with the Haganah.\n\nEverything seemed to be going well until emissaries from the Refugee Committee came to inspect the ship. Gertrude van Tijn and one of her colleagues from the Committee, Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-Jewish banker residing in the Netherlands who was financing part of the trip, came to satisfy themselves that the Dora was fit for the voyage. Siegfried Kramarsky, along with Salo (Salomon) Jakob FlÃ¶rsheim - another banker and philanthropist - and a few other members of the Refugee Committee, had paid the 115,000 guilders (approximately $1.1 million in 2018) the trip would cost, and felt responsible for the success and safety of the trip.\n\nThey arrived just as coal was being loaded, so the ship was covered in a cloud of soot. They had expected a passenger ship; when they saw the decrepit hulk of the Dora, they were shocked. They questioned aloud whether the Dora was capable of carrying a large number of passengers through the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and to Palestine and considered withdrawing their support, then refused to let the chalutzim board the ship.\n\nThe members of the Refugee Committee were mostly wealthy, assimilated Jews who represented the Jewish Community to the government. Their idea of what a ship should look like didn't fit with the reality of illegal immigration. They were also upset by all the delays so far and concerned by the issues these delays would cause with the Dutch Government, as they had given their word that the chalutzim would be leaving without delay. They had some contempt for \"Ostjuden\", the people who had organized the trip, saying \"Ostjuden don't keep their word\". They also suspected that the paperwork for the ship might be fakes acquired on the black market, and blamed the Haganah for the poor condition of the ship.\n\nShmarya Tzameret was astonished by what he heard from these assimilated, law-abiding Jews who, with their haughty attitude, made decisions regarding the chalutzim. In his report to the Mossad LeAliyah Bet, he noted that these people were so removed from the problems of the Jewish people. After the remark about the OstJuden, he only spoke English.\n\nHe spoke to Gertrude van Tijn who supported the illegal scheme and whom he saw as a woman of great intelligence, and asked her to try to convince Kramarsky. Tzameret explained to her why the trip had been delayed so many times, told her that the Dora was a solid ship which had passed the inspection by the official authorities, and that the insurance papers were in order. In the end, the Refugee Committee gave in and agreed to let the trip continue.\n\nThe Dora in Amsterdam.\n\nPhoto: De Telegraph July 15, 1939\n\nRead All About It!\n\nSoon after, new complications arose. The dock workers who had brought the coal aboard the Dora had noticed the bunk beds in the holds, and had alerted the editors of the Communist Party's newspaper about the \"scandalous\" conditions aboard that \"Death Ship\". The next day, the Volksdagblad (\"the People's Daily\") published a long article accusing the Dutch government of forcing Jews to leave in unsafe condition aboard a \"wreck of a ship\" with \"slave trade quarters\" sail, which, they were sure, would drown with the hundreds of refugees aboard. Other newspapers started to write about the \"Ship of the Dead\". In the Amsterdam harbor, photographers aboard small boats circled around the Dora.\n\nThe Dutch government's official position was that it knew nothing about the preparations regarding the Dora's departure, and clearly wanted to keep it that way. Feeling overwhelmed with the sudden influx of Jewish refugees from Germany, it was willing to close its eyes on any irregularities to facilitate the removal of at least some of them. Rufer met Hendrik van Boeijen, the Minister of the Interior, who approved the operation and ensured that officials turned a blind eye to what was happening.\n\nAs a result of the reports in the press, the harbormaster received the order to inspect the Dora. Shmarya Tzameret met with the harbormaster and revealed the reason for the trip, and after the Dora had gone through a new inspection by the Dutch authorities, the harbormaster gave his authorization to sail, but made a list of minor improvements needed before the Dora could leave.\n\nTo Gertrude's relief, Dutch marine inspectors visited the ship and pronounced the Dora seaworthy, on condition that some minor repairs be made and that additional lifeboats be brought aboard in Antwerp.\n\nSince there were only 350 beds and 300 people were supposed to board from Amsterdam, Tzameret told the harbormaster that only 50 more people would be boarding from Antwerp.\n\nThe Dutch government declared the following day that they weren't expelling any refugees, and that they would all leave from their own free will. The Communist Volksdagblad nevertheless denounced the apparent collusion between the authorities and the Refugee Committee in sending a \"second St Louis\" on a \"death journey\".\n\nWith the boat deemed seaworthy by the Amsterdam naval authorities, preparations for embarking the hundreds of chalutzim dispersed over various villages and communities now went under way.\n\nJacob Oppenheimer, a pioneer with the Mizrachi Kibbutz Dat veEretz (Religious Zionist), recalled:\n\n\"The Dutch immigration police wanted to get rid of us, but they were afraid of the publicity. The relationship with England wasn't too good, and the British of course didn't want any immigration. So in 1939, all of a sudden we were brought to Heemskerk (15 miles from Amsterdam), where we had to wait for a couple of weeks. Of course, we knew where we were going. On July 14th, I was brought to the house of Dr. Pinkhof in Amsterdam. I was very religious and couldn't travel on Shabbat. His house wasn't far from the harbor, so on Saturday, they came and picked me up and took me straight to the Dora.\"\n\n\"It was a small ship, full of people, but we never felt unsafe on the ship. The only danger we feared would come from the British.\"\n\nFlip Cohen was with another group of chalutzim in Beverwijk, a town about 15 miles from Amsterdam. He remembered:\n\nOn Saturday, I ordered some taxis. We went with the whole group. That evening, I was home for a just little while. My mother said, \"Are you leaving today?\" We said: \"See you in Eretz Israel\". I took my backpack and left.\n\nApart from my younger brother Samuel, I never saw them again. I came back to the Netherlands in 1945 as a soldier with the Jewish Brigade. I found Samuel in the Portuguese Israelite Hospital. He was just back from Bergen Belsen. All the others had been murdered.\n\nThe chalutzim were shuttled with busses all day Saturday from their hiding places to the harborside Lloyd hotel, which served as a refugee center, and was surrounded by the police.\n\nRaphael Kochavi wrote:\n\nAfter finally giving the signal to move, we boarded the buses that were waiting for us at the farm entrances. It was July 15, 1939.\n\nAt night, we arrived at the spacious customs hall at the port. Surrounded by Dutch security personnel, all the illegal immigrants gathered together.\n\nLloyd Hotel, Amsterdam.\n\nPhoto: Utrechts Volksblad 18.07.1939\n\nThe leaders of the Jewish Refugee Committee and organizers of the trip, including Gertrude van Tijn, Siegfried Kramarsky, Salomon FlÃ¶rsheim and Ru Cohen came to send off the refugees and wish them good luck. After fiery speeches, a Hatikvah concluded the ceremony.\n\nThe Handelskade\n\nAlso present were the heads of the immigration police from The Hague and from Amsterdam who had come to control the boarding with 35 civil servants and policemen. All passengers under the age of 21 had to sign a form attesting they were embarking of their own free will. Behind a police cordon, the chalutzim, in groups of ten or twenty, boarded small launches that took them to the Dora, waiting a hundred yards from the quay. .\n\nKochavi remembers differently: instead of launches, he describes the immigrants boarding the Dora directly from the pier:\n\nIn order to go in the belly of the ship, we had to go down a slippery sloping ramp onto a narrow deck. We were instructed in Hebrew to move on to the cargo hold which was illuminated by dim lights.\n\nThe Dora in Amsterdam.\n\n\"Authorities, shipping inspectors and others go on board for a final inspection before the departure signal.\"\n\nPhoto: Het Volk, July 17, 1939\n\n\"In groups of ten or twenty, the refugees go onboard, escorted by policemen.\"\n\nPhoto: Het Volk, July 17, 1939\n\nPassengers boarding The Dora\n\nPhoto: Photo: De Sumatra Post, 24 July 1939\n\n\"The Dora did not leave until 5 o'clock at night, three hours later than planned. They had been waiting for seven refugees from Enschede who were coming by car and had gotten lost.\"\n\nThese were the seven members of the Enschede Hachscharah Agudas Yisroel: Rosa Appel, Elie Daube, Heinemann Gutmann, Issy Hirsch, Saul Lampelz, Bernhard Rosen, Rubin Rottenberg, and Adolf Sanders.\n\nPhoto: Het Volk, July 17, 1939\n\nAt dusk, the Dora was moved to the Handelskade (the pier). The police cordoned off the pier to keep the press away, but the authorities were afraid that the Communists would come to demonstrate. Everybody knew what was going on, and when a young woman without papers managed to move through the police cordon, they just let her go aboard without any trouble. A high degree of complicity between the authorities and the organizers was evident. As Zvi Spector, the Haganah chief of the operation, was about to board, the commanding officer of the Dutch immigration police raised a glass and proposed three toasts â to Queen Wilhelmina, to the success of the voyage, and to an independent Jewish state.\n\nThe Dora in Amsterdam.\n\n\"The Dora crew hastened to cover the name of the ship with tarpaulin, apparently to prevent anyone knowing which ship was moving across the IJ through the nocturnal darkness.\"\n\nPhoto: Het Volk July 17, 1939\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday, July 16, 1939, the Dora sailed from Amsterdam with about three hundred passengers. Most were Jewish refugees from Germany, including about 75 students from Wieringen. Some were Dutch Zionists who had undergone agricultural training in other Hachsharot. All were adults, mainly young men. One of the forty or so women was in her sixth month of pregnancy.\n\nGertrude bade an emotional farewell to the passengers and to Tzameret, who was to travel by train to meet the ship in Antwerp. The goodbyes between Tzameret and the Refugee Committee on the other hand were not particularly cordial. Kramarsky announced that he planned to go to Antwerp to ensure that the lifeboats requested by the Amsterdam harbormaster were brought on board, and that too many passengers wouldn't go aboard. Tzameret and Rufer tried to tell him this wasn't necessary, but to no avail.\n\nAntwerp: July 17\n\nThe Dora in Antwerp.\n\nPhoto: Het Handelsblad, 18 July 1939.\n\nThe Dora arrived in Antwerp on July 17th. Shmarya Tzameret wrote in his report: \"I spoke to a high-level Dutch civil servant who said that he wasn't interested in the plans of the Haganah, and that the only concern of the government was that the ship would disappear with the refugees as soon as possible.\" Tzameret had ordered that the passengers from Antwerp should board the Dora as soon as possible, but didn't tell Kramarsky, and continued the negotiations with people from the Refugee Committee. When Kramarsky arrived in Antwerp, he was furious to find out that a hundred and fifty people planned to board the ship, instead of the fifty that had been previously agreed upon. He again threatened to withdraw financial support.\n\nKramarsky later met with Tzameret in Antwerp, and angrily argued with him about the condition of the Dora and that there weren't enough beds onboard. Tzameret explained that beds were put side to side, two by two, so they could fit three people. He added that the refugees who were in Belgium illegally had no other option but to board the ship and leave under any conditions: otherwise, they would be sent back to concentration camps in Germany. But the Refugee Committee had given its word to the Dutch government that no more than fifty additional people would board the Dora, and threatened to take 100 chalutzim off in Antwerp and send them back to the Netherlands. Shmarya Tzameret, to Kramarsky's fury, boarded all 170 new passengers regardless.\n\nSiegfried Kramarsky went to the harbormaster and demanded that one hundred people be taken off the ship. The harbormaster, a devout Christian who saw the return of the Jewish people to the Promised Land as a Biblical fulfillment, became a spokesman for the chalutzim. He told Kramarsky not to worry, that it wasn't such an imposition if the refugees suffered a little for a couple of weeks if it meant that they would reach the coast of the Promised Land. Kramarsky then threatened to call the Dutch Government and ask them to take diplomatic action. This angered the harbormaster who refused to talk to the Dutchman any further. As last resort, Kramarsky went to the ship and tried to convince the chalutzim to not go on the trip, but the passengers explained that they were happy with the situation on the ship, so he finally gave up and drove away, seething.\n\nIn the meantime, unannounced, the Belgian Security Agency had sent a tugboat which started to move the Dora to Vlissingen, and the Dora left Antwerp on July 17th.\n\nVlissingen: July 18 - July 19\n\nThe Dora was now moored on the waterways of Vlissingen, where it remained for two days.\n\nNew problems arose: Kosta was demanding more money for the trip, one of the engine mechanics had missed the ship, and a newly hired Belgian radio operator didn't show up after having found what the actual goal of the trip was.\n\nIn the meantime, the Haganah in Paris decided that the Dora would not pick up the hundred refugees in Le Havre in France after all because there had already been too many delays, putting the entire expedition at risk. Yekutiel Fekete mentions in his recollections of the trip another reason: the ship was already full and there was no room for any more passengers.\n\nKosta and Tzameret found a new radio operator, a Spanish Communist who used to smuggle weapons to Spain during the Civil War and was now stranded in Antwerp without papers after his ship had left without him. Kosta, the Spaniard and the mechanics took a taxi to Vlissingen, but were turned away : the Greek didn't have a visa, and the Spaniard didn't have a passport. The four of them would have to leave Antwerp the next morning on a motorboat for Vlissingen.\n\nIt was now July 18th and Tzameret wanted the Dora to leave as soon as possible. He was concerned that the Dutch press in Vlissingen and the Refugee Committee would find out that the Dora was back in Dutch waters, and that the Dutch government might decide under public pressure to prevent the departure because there were too many people aboard.\n\nAt 5 a.m., Tzameret observed the Dora from the Vlissingen dike through his binoculars. There were fishermen and a little boy on the dike. The kid said: \"You see the ship? That's a 'death ship', a ship full of Jewish refugees from Germany that will sink, for sure.\" It was as if everybody in the Netherlands knew about the Dora, even the children.\n\nMeanwhile, more articles appeared in the local press about the \"mysterious refugee ship\". While the Dora was anchored off the coast of Vlissingen, a journalist from the Daily Herald had come aboard. He wrote that the passengers slept on the deck on straw mats, and had told him they were going to Bangkok, or Siam. The news drew the attention of the British government, and the British representative Nevile Bland made inquiries at the Foreign office in the Netherlands, pointing out that immigration to Palestine was illegal. The Foreign Office responded that the ship had given as its destination Siam, and that they weren't aware of any another destination.\n\nAfter having spent almost two days anchored in Vlissingen for no apparent reason, the Utrechts Volksblad explained that the delay had been caused by the captain waiting for the arrival of a crew member whom he could not miss and who could only get on board today. What that journalist saw from the shore with binoculars was \"not an encouraging spectacle\", and that \"the hundreds [...] now on this ship, are compressed on a much too small space.\"\n\nFollowing the reports in the press, Louis de Visser, Chairman of the House of Commons and a member of the Communist Party, raised questions at the end of July for Prof. Gerbrandy, the Minister of Justice. He asked him if he had forced the Jewish Committee to take such action, argued that the refugees shouldn't leave if they couldn't secure a destination, and that they should be allowed back to the Netherlands if needed. Minister Gerbrandy denied having had any knowledge of the Dora. In the meantime, the government representative for refugees, B.G.A. (Bernardus Gerhardus Albertus) Smeets, unhappy about the conditions on the Dora, sent a letter to the Justice Ministry, dated July 22, 1939, in which he accused the Jewish Committee of \"irresponsible behavior\":\n\n\"What I understand makes me ask if the government shouldn't have just prevented the ship from leaving. It was too crowded. Refugees are sleeping under sails on the upper deck, on straw. One storm and they will be gone. There isn't enough safety equipment, four little boats for 20 people each. In Amsterdam the ship was already overloaded, and in Antwerp another 100 refugees were added. [...] You should realize that illegal immigration with ships has already been causing much trouble everywhere. Ships that aren't allowed into harbors, that are at sea for months, that have the plague on board - for example the odyssey with the St Louis, which was actually a comfortable ship, while the Dora...\"\n\nOn July 20th, in London, the \"Daily Herald\" published an article with two photos of the Dora. The Herald's reporter described having gone on board the Dora and reported:\n\n\"... Her holds packed with human cargo, she was a passenger ship carrying 500 Jewish refugees to a destination that nobody seems to know... The Greek captain was silent about the ships' destination. He said he had \"sealed orders\".\n\nThe harbormaster said \"We accept no responsibility for that ramshackle ship. She got her certificate of seaworthiness in Amsterdam - so good luck to her.\"\n\nHere is what he saw:\n\n\"The Dora has two lifeboats on each side, each capable of taking 15 passengers. Should she meet disaster, the poor state the lifeboats are in leaves little hope of even 60 escaping in them. It would not take a hurricane to sink the Dora either. Her portholes are only secured with old rubber bands.\"\n\nNone of the passengers seems to mind the dangers and discomforts. \"What does it matter,\" one of them said to me, \"as long as we find freedom again?\" If the land to which they are going refuses to take them, they will have to return to their port of embarkation.\"\n\n\"Where are we going to?\" somebody answered when I questioned him. \"To Siam.\" \"To Bangkok.\" said another.\n\nPassengers later recalled the lack of space on the Dora. My mother said that they had slept on wooden planks, three people lying head to foot, with about 30cm (12\") per person, while Gershon Jonas remembered that \"the ship was very crowded, we slept on the floor.\"\n\nOn the way to Palestine: July 19 - August 12\n\nOn Wednesday, July 19, at around 11:15 a.m., the Dora left Vlissingen and at long last began its voyage to Palestine. According to Gertrude van Tijn, the ship was \"overloaded, ill-equipped, not very well provisioned\", but was finally on its way, starting its four-week voyage across the English Channel, the Atlantic and then the Mediterranean, where it would have to avoid the British blockade to unload its human cargo on the shores of Palestine.\n\nThe ship was manned by a multinational crew, composed mainly of Greeks and Danes. Officially, the chief captain was the elder Arteshides, however the officer who would in fact in charge during this voyage was a Danish captain. The rest of the crew was from France, Algeria, as well as one Jewish immigrant from Russia who was a waiter in the officers' dinning room. The radio operator was a Spaniard, and the doctor on board from among the passengers turned out to be a morphine addict.\n\nThree Haganah members went along: the ship manager, Tzvi Spector (23), the emergency captain, Amiram Shohat (23), and in charge of the radio connection with the Haganah HQ, Yekutiel Fekete (24).\n\nThe passsengers were organized according to their group affiliations, with leaders for each group.\n\nAccording to Regina Merkel, there were two kitchens: one kosher and one non-kosher.\n\nThe following day, the Dora was spotted sailing past the Isle of Wight in the English Channel, as reported by the \"Lloyds List and Shipping Gazette\" .\n\nThe Dora then entered the Atlantic Ocean and sailed southward, towards the Gulf of Biscay. A region known for rough seas, fierce weather and high waves, the Dora experienced violent storms during which many of its passengers became sea-sick.\n\nThe Dora continued, maintaining eye contact with the coasts of Spain and Portugal. Raphael Kochavi recalled \"At night, Lisbon lights twinkled in the distance\". Around that time, he also remembered sighting a ship flying the swastika flag.\n\nOn July 29th, the Dora entered the Mediterranean Sea and crossed the Strait of Gibraltar. The Lloyd observation station, tasked with watching Gibraltar, reported its entry to the Palestine C.I.D (Criminal Investigation Department) and the British ordered the ship to identify itself. At the first signs of danger, the Greek Captain would send the refugees below deck into the hold of the ship, lest they be seen by British lookouts. The Greek declared it was a Panamanian ship on its way to Siam. The British accepted this explanation because ships with illegal immigrants never came through the Strait of Gibraltar, instead came from the French Riviera, the Italian Coast, or the Coast of the Black Adriatic Sea.\n\nThe Dora then passed along the shores of Algiers and Tunisia which, as Yekutiel Fekete recalled, \"shone in full magic under the full moon\", then sailed on from there between Sicily and Malta, and on towards the island of Crete.\n\nThe Dora then went past the Suez Canal, and sailed on towards Turkey.\n\nTurkey\n\nYekutiel Fekete wrote:\n\n\"The journey is getting longer. The wireless connection to Eretz Israel has not yet been established. There is a shortage of food and water. It's hot, very hot. It's impossible to stay in the belly of the ship and everyone is huddled on the decks and sleeps there. Impossible. No patience. The shortage of water and food is worsening. The decision was made to anchor in a small port on the coast of Turkey and stock up on water and food. Coal is also needed, but not available.\"\n\nGershon Jonas: \"There was a leak in the water pipes and no more food. [...] At one point, we drank only boiled salt water mixed with tea and ate only biscuits.\"\n\nThe Dora reached the southern coast of Turkey. It was now full moon, which made a secret landing in Palestine impossible anyway. The Dora radioed the Haganah in Palestine, and the crew was ordered to drop anchor off the Turkish coast at Finike* and wait until the new moon. (* Others mention Antalya; Hillel Yarkoni mentions the port of Mersin. Maybe the Dora made several stops in Turkey.)\n\nHillel Yarknoni wrote: \"The ship entered the port of Mersin in Turkey to get some supplies, mainly water and food.\"\n\nThe Dora would spend approximately one week in Turkey, waiting for the appropriate conditions to attempt the final leg of the trip. The Turkish police paid a visit to the Dora and declared that passengers were not allowed to disembark. Hillel Yarkoni wrote: \"Under the threat of guns, none of the people onboard were permitted to leave the ship.\".\n\nThe police did allow a boat to bring drinking water and watermelons to the Dora. Fekete recalled: \"Food, water and especially plenty of watermelons were purchased\".\n\nThe exact sequence of the next events is somewhat confusing as recollections about the final part of the trip vary.\n\nAccording to Yekutiel Fekete, the ship then left Turkey and sailed for a day or two. As the Dora left the bay, it crossed path with the Tiger Hill, another illegal immigrant ship carrying over 1400 refugees:\n\n\"The illegal immigrants on board both ships are huddled on the side facing the other ship. The ships lean sideways at a dangerous angle, passing next to each other. A spontaneous rendition of the 'Hatikvah' bursts from the mouths of the immigrants.\"\n\nAccording to Yekutiel Fekete, the original plan had been to use a smaller ship to bring the passengers to the shore while the Dora would safely return to the high sea, reducing the risk of the expensive ship being captured by the British. By now, the wireless connection with the Haganah had been established and brought the news that the small ship was not available after all. The Haganah crew on board discussed with the shipowner how to proceed with a direct landing of the illegal immigrants to shore, when and where to sail to arrive on a dark night without a moon, while waiting for instructions from the Haganah.\n\nRebellion on the Dora\n\nSoon after the Dora resumed sailing, a rebellion broke out and the Dora stopped moving. The sailors, armed with kitchen knives, demanded additional payment, because the trip taken longer than the two weeks originally agreed upon. In addition, the new plan calling for the Dora to land the passengers directly on the coast meant added risk of being seized by the British and extended the duration of the voyage even further.\n\nThe rebellion ended quickly, although explanation on how it was resolved varies. According to Yekutiel Fekete, negotiations and passengers collecting money resolved the issue. Hillel Yarkoni simply noted that \"the Danish captain's calm helped restore order\", without mentioning money changing hands, while my mother remembered that a show of force on the part of the Haganah had put an end to the rebellion.\n\nGershon Jonas: \"In Turkey, the Greek Captain got cold feet. He thought the British would capture his ship, or that he would be arrested. We had been at sea for two weeks, and another week in Turkey when the Greek sailors said, 'We only got paid for two weeks, and weâve been three weeks on the way. We won't continue until we get more money.' Four hundred dollars was collected from the Jewish passengers.\"\n\nJust to be safe, the first captain, who had joined the rebellion, was locked up with his wife for the rest of the trip.\n\nFinally, on August 11, 1939, the Dora received the signal that the coast was clear and that they could attempt to land. To evade detection and look inconspicuous like any dilapidated cargo ship, all passengers were sent down to the belly of the ship and the deck portholes closed.\n\nSoon after, a new danger arose. About 80 kilometers south of Cyprus, an aircraft carrier accompanied by destroyers appeared. A destroyer approached the Dora, illuminating it with its spotlights. Asked to identify itself and its destination, the Dora replied it was just a regular cargo ship headed to a Lebanese port.\n\nOthers described the event differently: \"A British warship appeared 300 meters away, but the warship left soon after without having detected the Dora. Looking southward in the darkness of the night, the olim could see the lights from Tel Aviv, while the searchlights of the police boat almost touched the ship. Everyone on board was quiet.\"\n\nThe Landing - August 12th\n\nThe following day the Dora finally arrived near Eretz Israel. Sailing in the evening along the coast, it adjusted its speed to reach the designated landing beach by nightfall.\n\nThe landing had been set to take place on the beach of Shefayim, a kibbutz about 15 kms north of Tel Aviv. The location had been chosen for being both approachable, close to a Jewish settlement and far from British military and police installations.\n\nThe Haganah was in charge of disembarkation, and the man responsible on behalf of the Mossad was David (Davidka) Nameri, a kibbutznik from Ashdot Ya'akov.\n\nMordechai Naor describes the landing of another ship, the Poseidon, in 1938. I assume the process was similar for the landing of the Dora and helps convey how much effort and coordination was required to ensure the success of the final phase of the trip:\n\nOn the shore, several groups from the Haganah were gathered to assist with the landing of the passengers:\n\nTeams of rowers to transfer the immigrants to shore;\n\nA \"water-team\" - to assist them from the boats to the beach;\n\nGuides - to bring them to a rendezvous;\n\nA communication team between the shore and the Haganah center in Tel Aviv;\n\nA group to transport the immigrants to the different settlements, and\n\nA first aid unit.\n\nIn addition, there also was an armed patrol, illegally armed, to warn of any police activity and prevent it, if necessary.\n\nAll night long its passengers were brought ashore and quickly dispersed to adjacent settlements.\n\nMordechai Naor later details the disembarking of the Artemisia, a small (less than 100 passengers) early illegal vessel (1937). Again, I assume a similar procedure was in place for the Dora, although at a larger scale.\n\nThat entire day was taken up with meticulous last-minute preparations for debarkation. The passengers were split up into groups of ten, each group having as its leader one of its members. Men were placed alongside the ladders to supervise the descent. Lifebelts were assembled in one spot in the event there might be a need for them. The boats were checked last of all. Everything was ready for a smooth debarkation. A few hours remained until nightfall, so the ship kept at a safe distance from the shore. Only after it became dark, and the prearranged signals were visible, did the ship drop anchor at a distance of 200 yards from the beach.\n\nThe first boat was (sent) to assay the situation on shore and return with rowers. The six best swimmers from among the pioneers were equipped with lifebelts and lowered into the boat, then pulled for shore. After twenty minutes the boat returned with the rowers in it, and it was full speed ahead with debarkation. The immigrants were ferried to shore, group by group, according to the prearranged schedule. After two hours the last boat returned and the crew members took their posts without delay. The anchor was lifted and the ship sailed away.\n\nThe Dora dropped anchor and a boat was sent from the ship to the shore. (According to another source: \"First, Tzvi Spector swam to the shore to make sure the path was clear.\") The boat returned with members of the naval unit of the Haganah. They got on the ship, all the boats were lowered and, group by group, the transfer of the illegal immigrants began.\n\nThe immigrants climbed down using rope ladders and got into small boats, with the young men from naval unit of the Haganah rowing them to land, then bringing the boats back to the Dora for the next group. As they got close to the beach, the refugees jumped from the boats into the water and walked the last few tens of meters in the shallow water, to the soft sand.\n\nYoel Golomb, took part in the landing of the Dora and helped the immigrants come ashore. He recalled:\n\n\"During the month of September*, a ship with Olim came into shore, and we brought the Olim to Shefayim at night, in complete secrecy. That was an unforgettable experience. We unloaded the Olim, men, women, and children who climbed down the side of the ship on rope ladders. We then brought them into shore. This seemed like a simple operation but [...] we were informed that a British naval vessel had been sighted and was approaching; we managed to get all the lifeboats back onto the deck, except one which we tied to the ship. The ship was named Dora and [...] came from Holland. The ship turned and headed back to Europe, and we swam to shore. [...] A message was received from the Dora sometime afterwards, saying that it was neither captured nor detained.\"\n\n*Note: actually August.\n\nGershon Jonas: \"We jumped in the water, the children were taken by boat, and we got to the shore. Haganah soldiers were on land with rifles... I had never seen that before!\"\n\nYekutiel Fekete described the \"exemplary\" organization on the shore to manage the landing and dispersal of the passengers of the Dora:\n\nOn the beach there is a field phone connected to one of the houses where a wireless transmitter is set up to maintain contact with the ship. The members of the naval company take care of transporting the immigrants from the ship to the shore. Groups of guards are blocking a section of the beach to delay the possible arrival of the British police. Some men have flooded dirt roads so that cars cannot pass, others are responsible for the rapid dispersal of groups in the surrounding communities.\n\nAt the same moment, in Tel Aviv, the head of Mossad leAliyah Bet and Golda Meir followed the arrival of the Dora. Francine Klagsbrun:\n\n\"Shaul Avigur, the head of Mossad leAliyah Bet, and a co-worker slipped into Golda Meirâs apartment on Hayarkon Street. [...] He had decided to monitor the landing of the Dora from the shortwave radio center in the Meyerson (Meir) apartment.\n\nWhen the Dora reached its destination, the commander on the ground, David Nameri, signaled its arrival. The signals were relayed to the wireless in the Meyerson apartment, where Avigur could receive and send coded messages to the ship. In one heart-stopping moment for everyone in the flat, a British police boat with searchlights ablaze almost spotted the immigrant ship as it neared the coast, but the ship stayed hidden in the blackness of the night. When all seemed safe, it dropped off its passengers, who silently made their way on foot to Kfar Shmaryahu, a nearby agricultural village. The captain lifted anchor and sailed westward into the dark, to begin another mission. \"In the early morning hours,\" Avigur reported years later, \"we said goodnight to our hosts, Golda Meir and Leah Biskin, and went about our business.\"\n\nGershon Jonas: \"The Jewish settlements surrounding the shipâs landing area had a festival; they invited the British and got them drunk. Just an empty ship left on shore the next morning was what the British patrol encountered the next morning.\"\n\nBrach Habas mentions (p.89) that Shai, the Haganah's secret information service, \"staged criminal decoy operations in settlements in the coastal area, drawing the police away from the vicinity of debarking immigrants. They obtained advance information concerning patrol-boat movements and were able to intercept messages sent by British spies to the roving patrols. These instructions, as well as the orders given the border police and the lookout towers, greatly facilitated debarkation proceedings. Shai agents kept close track of the wireless communications betwen the lookout towers and the roving patrols. The young men even knew the signals intended for police airplanes and warships.\"\n\nYoel Golomb: \"The rope that tied the (row)boat to the ship broke and the boat was 'lost at sea'. Davidka Nameri [...] chose me and another fellow to go out looking for the missing boat. [...] We could see the boat far out in the water. I swam out and [...] I managed to get it back to shore, and we buried it in the sand.\"\n\nAt 2 a.m., the Dora announced that everybody had unboarded. The Haganah telegraphed Uri Kochba that \"the delivery was successful and the mother is healthy\". Back in the Netherlands,Gertrude van Tijn was notified by telegraph of the successful landing. She passed the message on to minister Van Boeijen, who could finally breathe a sigh of relief: the Netherlands had gotten rid of 300 refugees without damaging its relationship with Great Britain, and it hadn't cost the treasury a penny.\n\nAfter landing, the new immigrants were first concentrated in Kfar Shemariahu, and were later distributed in various absorption centers.\n\nOne on the immigrants, Gina Elsoffer, recalled receiving a fake ID card to help her blend into ther new environment. Likewise, my mother had mentioned being given feake ID papers - although I always understood that this had happened upon her landing on the beach,\n\nYekutiel Feteke got off the Dora and was replaced by another wireless operator, Shlomo Lavi. Zvi Spector too got off the ship, replaced by Amiram Shochat. The ship then went out to sea and sailed west. At first, the ship had been intended to bring the members of the Zionist Congress from Marseilles to Israel. Then the plan was changed and the ship sailed to Algeria. There, the defense personnel got out of it and returned to Israel.\n\nThree weeks later, Germany invaded Poland, marking the beginning of World War Two, and with it the wholesale destruction of Jewish life in Europe.\n\nAccording to the agreement with the Arteshides brothers, the Dora was supposed to do a second trip, but this agreement was not honored. Only after legal battle some of the money that had been paid in advance to the Greek family was paid back.\n\nThe Dora was later captured by the Germans and was at their service between 1941-1942. On December 21st 1942, it was sunken by a British warship near the Djerba harbor in Tunis.\n\nThe Dora in the News\n\nAlthough it was supposed to be kept secret, the departure of the Dora was widely reported in the Dutch, Belgian and British press, and it's a wonder that this unwelcome scrutiny didn't lead to the interception of the Dora by the British Navy.\n\nBetween July 14 and August 28, no less than 100 articles and dispatches about the Dora appeared in the press in the Netherlands, including several front-page stories. . In Belgium, more than 40 articles appeared in July. The British press also reported on the departure of the Dora, with at least eight articles, with more mentions appearing in France and as far as Melbourne, Australia. Finally, the Jewish press published dispatches in Palestine and in the USA.\n\nNottingham Evening Post. July 17, 1939.\n\nThe Scotsman. July 19, 1939.\n\n\"From the shore hundreds of men and women, and also cattle, could be seen on deck\".\n\nDaily Herald. July 20, 1939.\n\nThe Belfast NewsLetter. July 21, 1939.\n\n\"Jewish refugees face a new future - Departed from Amsterdam with a Panamean coal ship.\"\n\nDe Sumatra Post, July 24, 1939.\n\nDramatis Personae\n\nTransporting 480 refugees from Northern Europe to Palestine on the eve of WW2 and bringing them safely to the coast of Palestine despite the British blockade required complex planning, difficult negotiations, and the covert coordination of hundreds of refugees spread over multiple hiding places over two countries. The Dora would not have succeeded in reaching the shores of Palestine without the work and dedication of the many people involved.\n\nHere is a list of some of the key people who, with their courage, skills, and generosity, helped save the lives of almost 500 refugees on the eve of WW2.\n\nThis section is in memory of the people who made it happen and who deserve our thanks as descendants of the passengers of the Dora.\n\nThe Passengers\n\nAccording to records from Mossad leAliyah Bet, the Dora carried 480 passengers to its destination. A few sources mention slight variations: Gertrude van Tijn, who took part in the rescue operation, cites 310 passengers in Amsterdam, including 50 pupils from Werkdorp Nieuwesluis, with an additional 157 passengers in Antwerp, for a total of 467, while some authors have rounded the number to 500.\n\nTwo lists of passengers have been found so far: one from Amsterdam, with 183 names, and one from Antwerp, with 171 additional names, for a total of 354. The difference between the 480 given by Mossad can mostly be explained by the fact that the lists from Amsterdam were compiled by Zionist groups and only include passengers who belonged to their groups. Refugees, who were not affiliated with any Zionist organization, were not included in those lists. The Antwerp list contains a mix of chalutzim and refugees. It appears to have been compiled by the Belgian authorities, and may be comprehensive.\n\nTo date, 382 (80%) names are known out of the estimated 480 passengers.\n\nList 1: List of Passengers who boarded the Dora in Amsterdam on 16 July 1939 (from the HeHalutz lists).\n\nSource: Dutch National Archive (Courtesy Rina Offenbach, Director BeNetivei Haapalah, Illegal Immigrant Database and Information Center, Atlit Detention Camp, Israel.)\n\nI compiled the Amsterdam list below from 18 pages of names from several Pioneering organizations:\n\n\"Left on the SS Dora\": 7 names, handwritten list, no indication of group\n\nStichting Joosche Arbeid Werkdorp Nieuwesluis: 76 names, dated August 1 (after the departure of the Dora), typewritten.\n\n\"List of foreign students who left during the month of July\": 36 names, including last address and nationality\n\n\"Dath WaÃ¤retz\": 26 names, dated August 7, typewritten.\n\n\"Dath WaÃ¤retz, left on the Dora\": 22 names, with 4 more names crossed out, handwritten list.\n\nDeventer Association: 54 names over 4 typewritten pages, covering 32 locations. Include date and city of birth and nationality.\n\nWerkdorp Wieringermeer: 76 names over 2 typewritten pages. Include date and city of birth and nationality.\n\nVereeniging \"Dat Waarez\" (Amsterdam): 7 names, including date and city of birth and nationality. Typewritten.\n\nVereeniging \"Dat Waarez\" (Bevervwijk): 20 names, including date and city of birth and nationality. Typewritten.\n\nEnschede: Hachscharah Agudas JisroÃ«l: 7 names, including date and city of birth and nationality. Typewritten.\n\nFraneker (Kiboets Misrachi): 3 names, including date and city of birth and nationality. Typewritten.\n\nLaren Bergstichting: 2 names, including date and city of birth and nationality. Typewritten.\n\nThe last seven lists follow a similar format an were most likely prepared by the same person, presumably from the Hechalutz organization. The other lists are all different and were most likely created by their respective groups. Some names are appear on more than one list.\n\nThis list doesn't include all the passengers who boarded from Amsterdam for several reasons:\n\n183 names appear on the Amsterdam lists. However, contemporary reports from the press and later accounts from organizers put the total number of passengers in Amsterdam at about 300, with Gertrude van Tijn citing 310 passengers.\n\nThe Amsterdam lists were compiled by several Zionist pioneer organizations, mainly Hechalutz, Mizrachi, Deventer and the Werkdorp Wieringermeer. Hence, passengers not affiliated with these groups don't appear on those lists.\n\nA large of number of refugees, i.e. people not affiliated to any Zionist organization, boarded the Dora in Amsterdam. A list of the refugees, if it ever existed, hasn't surfaced yet.\n\nSeveral reports mention the presence of children on the Dora (Yoel Golomb, Gershon Jonas, and Flip Cohen - although Cohen mentions them boarding in Antwerp). These too are don't appear in the lists that were drawn by the pioneering groups.\n\nOver the years, several people have contacted me with information about relatives who boarded from Amsterdam whose names don't appear these lists, confirming that the available lists are not comprehensive. These name appear in a separate list further down.\n\nNote: Four names on these lists were crossed out, without further explanation. My assumption is that these are people who may have decided at the last minute to not board the Dora, or were unable to do so.\n\nAlthough incomplete, the Amsterdam list includes interesting demographic data on the passengers:\n\nGender:\n\nMen: 80% (146)\n\nWomen: 20% (36)\n\nNationality:\n\nGerman: 69% (126)\n\nDutch: 9% (16)\n\nPolish: 8% (14)\n\n\"Stateless\": 7% (13). (It is not clear if these \"stateless\" passengers were of Polish or German origin.)\n\nHungarian: 3% (6)\n\nCzechoslovak: 1% (2)\n\nDanzig: 0.5% (1)\n\nEngland: 0.5% (1)\n\nUnknown: 1.5% (3)\n\nOrganizations:\n\n76: Werkdorp Wieringermeer\n\n59 (or 60): Deventer Association, distributed over several locations, the largest group (15) from Jeugdherberg (youth hostel) \"De Assumburg\" in Heemskerk, about 20 miles from Amsterdam\n\n29: Mizrachi (religious Zionist) Kibbutz Dat veEretz (××ª ×××¨×¥, \"Religion and Country\") in Beverwijk\n\n7: Enschede Hachscharah Agudas Yisroel\n\n3: Kibbutz Misrachi (religious Zionist) in Franeker\n\n2: Berg-Stichting, Laren (Jewish orphanage)\n\nA few individuals came from additional locations: Markelo, Almen, Zenderen, Zeddam and Delden.\n\nFor the list of additional passengers who boarded from Amsterdam, see further down under \"Additional Passengers\".\n\nNote: Dates of birth are given as they appeared on the original lists with the following format: dd.mm.yy. In a few cases, the dates are incorrect (i.e. \"3\" instead of \"8\"). These dates are marked with an asterisk (*).\n\nTotal: 180\n\nList 2: List of Passengers who boarded the Dora in Antwerp, 19 July 1939\n\nSource: The Foreign Police in Belgium ARA; Foreign Police files, A177.761 (via Janiv Stamberger)\n\nThe list contains 171 names: 108 men and 63 women.\n\nThe names are listed in the same order as that from the original passenger list. The last eight names, starting with Mordohe Deresiewicz, are not in alphabetical order, suggesting these passengers were last-minute additions to the list.\n\nThe Antwerp list only contains names and dates of birth. All additional information (place of birth and nationality) is derived from other sources and is indicated by square brackets (\"[]\").\n\nAdditional Passengers\n\nThis list includes the names of additional Dora passengers not included in either the Amsterdam or Antwerp lists. It is assumed that most, if not all, of these passengers boarded in Amsterdam, as the Antwerp list seems to be comprehensive.\n\nSince there were an estimated 300 to 350 passengers in Amsterdam, but the existing lists contain only 183 names, there may have been 120 to 170 passengers in Amsterdam who did not belong to pioneering groups. These were either refugees, teenage orphans, possibly some wealthy individuals or families, leaders of various Jewish organizations, and people with connections.\n\nTo date, 32 of these unaffiliated passengers have been identified, with an estimated 100 to 150 more still unknown. 24 of those boarded from Amsterdam. For the remaining 8, the port of departure is not known.\n\nA few passengers mentioned the presence of about 10 teenage orphans on the Dora. To date, only one has been identified, Johanna Jacob.\n\nList 3: Additional passengers who boarded in Amsterdam (not on the Hehalutz Lists)\n\nList 4: Additional passengers who boarded in Antwerp - not on the Antwerp list\n\nThe Antwerp list, which seems to have been compiled by the Belgian authorities, was assumed to be comprehensive.

It is assumed that they were had planned to leave on the Dora but did not for unknown reasons. Their fate is unknown.\n\nList 7: People who planned to board the Dora\n\nAccording to some of the organizers, the Dora was supposed to pick up another 100 passengers from Le Havre in France. Aside from a couple of brief mentions, there are no details about the composition or the size of such group, their location, or their eventual fate.\n\nIt is of course impossible to know how many people wanted to board the Dora but were not able to secure a place. We know however of two stories\n\n50th Anniversary\n\nIn 1989, former passengers of the Dora gathered to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their Aliyah.\n\n50th Anniversary of the Dora\n\nFrom the collection of Amnon Rimon\n\n50 years ago, on a single day, a group of about 50 people left the Werkdorp in order to reach what was then Palestine \"illegally\" and on adventurous routes on the Dora, under the nose of the English Mandate government! In retrospect, this was literally the last moment to escape Nazi hell before war broke out.\n\nThe time we were in the Werkdorp shaped our youth and was decisive for many of us on the rest of our lives, wherever they settled afterwards. The Dutch government gave us asylum for a while & the opportunity to just learn. We have not forgotten the Dutch people, and we still owe them thanks and sympathy to this day. Personal relationships and friendships among us also last to this day.\n\nWe also want to commemorate those who were not as fortunate as we were and fell victim to Nazi terror during World War II.\n\nThis year's anniversary is a celebration for all of us. Let's enjoy it to the fullest!"
