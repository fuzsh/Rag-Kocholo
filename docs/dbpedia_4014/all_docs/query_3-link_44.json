Discounts available for students, seniors, and veterans.\n\nInfo: (804) 748-5203 or https://www.swiftcreekmill.com\n\nRun For Your Wife is a classic farce: fast-paced and filled with ridiculous situations and pratfalls. The play is set in the homes of John and Mary Smith and John and Barbara Smith, in the conveniently located London neighborhoods of Wimbledon and Streatham, in the Spring of 1982. Location is very important, as John Smith, a taxi driver, has a strict schedule to keep in order to balance his two households. John, you see, is a bigamist. He’s also a master scheduler who should be giving workshops in time management.\n\nAll goes well, until the day he gets mugged and ends up in the hospital where his two addresses cause confusion, leading to a police investigation. John’s injuries are not serious, but the fallout turns his life upside down, and provides fodder for a series of events that are so outrageous this play, by Ray Cooney, ran in London for nine years.\n\nWe don’t have to travel all the way across “the pond” to get in on the fun. Jeffrey Meisner plays the role of the hapless husband, with Emma Mason as his first wife, the steadfast and practical Mary, and Katherine S. Wright as his second wife, the alluring and somewhat ditzy Barbara. To help manage the comings and goings on stage, a single living room was designed to represent the two households. The décor is green on the left side (Barbara’s home) and red on the right (Mary’s home) with a sofa in the middle that blends both red and green. At times, characters onstage are in close proximity, or even pass one another, but they are in two different households in two different locations. And do you know what? It works! Tom Width’s design is simple yet functional.\n\nThe timing is fast-paced and masterful. While not a work that requires the audience to think deep thoughts, it does require the viewers to pay attention; it’s sort of the comedic version of a tennis match. As Tom Width states in his Director’s Notes, “if things slow down, the characters will realize just how crazy their behavior is and stop doing what they’re doing!”\n\nJeffrey Meisner steered the ensemble towards inevitable doom with a solid performance (oh, and London cabbies must have been well paid in 1982 to be able to afford two households!), but my favorite character was the Smith’s neighbor (and tenant?) Stanley Gardner, played by Kenny Putnam. Putnam wrung every possible bit of comic effect from each of his lines and even gave us a well-timed roll over a sofa. There is also a running joke about Stanley being gay, not intended to be offensive, if you accept that sexism and idiocy are acceptable devices in a farce. Similarly, Sarbajeet Das plays Bobby, Barbara’s over-the-top flamboyant new neighbor. Matt Bloch and Matt Hackman bring balance, in the form of somewhat more subtle humor, as the two detectives investigating John.\n\nRun for Your Wife may not be your cup of tea if you are easily offended or insist on political correctness, but if a flat-out farce is among your preferred forms of entertainment, then look no further, this is your show.\n\n———-\n\nJulinda D.

Lewis\n\nAt: The Firehouse 1609 West Broad St., Richmond, RVA 23220\n\nPerformances: May 8-26, 2024\n\nTicket Prices: $0-$35\n\nInfo: (804) 355-2001 or firehousetheatre.org.\n\nChandler Hubbard, local actor (Corpus Christi, The Altruists, Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play, and Stupid F!%king Bird) and playwright (Animal Control reviewed here in April and July 2019)and Molly House) has done it again! And by “done it again” I mean that he has taken as subject matter “real-life subjects and their accompanying emotions – anger, blame, justice, and ultimately compassion. Sometimes it’s difficult to decide whether to laugh or cry” https://wordpress.com/post/jdldancesrva.com/1249). By “done it again” I mean that Chandler’s work delivers a surprising play that “presents many sides of a story, demonstrating how difficult it is to judge others. It makes subtle parallels between the behavior of people…[and] mostly it reminds us that even the most unlikely person may be deserving of compassion” (https://wordpress.com/post/jdldancesrva.com/15140). I am not saying that Roman À Clef is anything like Animal Control, but that Chandler has a unique vision, a wonderful way with words, and – together with his production team – an insightful and humorous eye for presenting his words and vision to an audience.\n\nRoman À Clef is a family play, but not a family-friendly play. First, in English, the title means “novel with a key,” a French phrase for a literary device in which real people, places, and things are given fictitious names, blurring the line between reality and non-reality, fact and fantasy, fiction and non-fiction. In Roman À Clef, a theater company rehearses a play that is about the fictitious playwright’s real family. But, one wonders, how much is based on reality?\n\nSharon Ott ably directed the three-acts of shenanigans, all of which were executed by a stellar cast. Andrew Bryce, in his Firehouse debut, leads the ensemble as Jack, the director of the fictional play, whose work blurs the line between fact and fiction and creates new perspectives and reveals new dimensions of family trauma. eventually – inevitably?—it is revealed that the reason Jack’s cast can never satisfy his unattainable demands is because he has not yet put to rest his own demons. Even the title of Jack’s play, Apple, Tree: Far From, Not is a pretentious portent of things to come.\n\nAmong the well-cast cast members of the play-within-a-play and Jack’s family are a mix of familiar and new faces: newcomer Reese Bucher, Lukas D’errico (Firehouse debut), Richmond newcomer Alex Harris, Tippi Hart (a VCU professor of theater movement in her first full Firehouse production), Keaton Hillman, Kelli Kennedy, Donna Marie Miller, Landon Nagel, and Tatjana Shields (Firehouse debut).\n\nWhile this was a true ensemble, there were a few who stood out to me. Reese Bucher as Spawn, a newcomer in the character she played as well as on this stage, brought a genuine freshness and energy that that exploded off the stage and landed like glitter on her cast-mates. Likewise, Keaton Hillman in the role of McKnight, whom I’ve had the pleasure of watching develop as a theater artist on various Richmond stages over the years, gave a seamless performance in a role that seemed to have been written expressly with him in mind. Not to mention, seeing his lanky frame rocking bootie shorts and a propeller beanie was hilarious.\n\nThere were also some striking performances from the ranks of the more seasoned cast members. Kelly Kennedy strikes an interesting balance between frailty and perseverance, equal parts victim and victor as Jack’s mother Lois. Tippi Hart as the stage version of Jack’s mother, Queenie, is lovable but confused, looking kind of like a drag queen in the early stages of dementia. And Donna Marie Miller convincingly plays Jack’s sister Fiona as the family conciliator, the one who tries to smooth things over at all costs.\n\nThe problem is, there is no smoothing over the family trauma that fuels Jack’s family and bleeds into his present. The masks we wear are symbolically represented in Chris Raintree’s stunning set. It starts off as a cartoon caricature of a home, centered around the kitchen – the metaphorical heart of every home. In act two, the mask is removed to reveal the real kitchen of Jack’s childhood home, and begins to cover the source of his family’s dysfunction. Hubbard calls this act “A Family Home (without a family). For the third act, the mask is returned, but there are cracks in it, and bits of reality peak through. This is “A Performance, A Reckoning. All of it. All together. Now.”\n\nAnd that title pretty much sums it up. There isn’t much more to say, other than: Hubbard has created a masterful piece of theater. His words tell hard stories with beauty, and humor, and truth. Roman À Clef is immersive; details matter, from the script to the costumes to the set to the character’s names (e.g., McKnight, Bishop, Queenie, Kingston, Spawn, Rookie). Sharon Ott’s direction tapped into the trauma and helped dissipate the energy in a way that made it palatable for an audience, the ensemble appeared to be committed to the work, and Chris Raintree’s set design captivated us in ways that words alone could not convey. Chandler Hubbard’s Roman À Clef manages to tap into areas many shy away from, and makes us glad he went there – and invited us to join him.\n\n———-\n\nJulinda D.

Costumes Designed by Johann Stegmeir.\n\nDeliberate yet unhurried movement. Intentional and diverse motivations. Splayed fingers, reaching, seeking, claiming, and declaring. These are words that describe my overall response to the latest performance of Starr Foster Dance – Curious Intentions.\n\nFamiliar Stranger, one of two new works, is a trio of sometimes fleeting, often exploratory movements. Remember that feeling you get when you pass someone on the street and they remind you of someone from your past, but you can’t quite remember their name? Or when someone touches you, perhaps just brushes against you in passing, and that brief contact stirs a long forgotten memory? Imagine, then, translating those feelings into movement, and you might just get Familiar Stranger. The work premiered with Fran Beaumont, Shannon Comerford, and Madison Ernstes, all performing with a sense of urgency – and sometimes a sinister touch – as they intertwine physically and emotionally. Two moments in time that that stand out are when first Ernstes and later Comerford (I think) are held and swung by the other two; it feels like a moment that could symbolize trust or danger, but – thanks to the dancers’ spiraling upper bodies and tiny hand gestures that are somehow enhanced by Daniel Deckelman’s dramatic thriller score – we’re never sure which way it might go.\n\nA second new work, Adjusting to the Dark, is performed by a large cast – five company members joined by six guest artists – all dressed in modest dark dresses with high necks and long bell sleeves, reminiscent of choir robes or liturgical vestments. The work actually begins with a prayer, a rendition of Ave Maria, and concludes with Jim Perkins’ A Ritual for Saying Goodbye, an appropriately moody medley of what sounds like violin and electronic yearning. A tug of war of pushing and pulling, caressing and enfolding, silent screams, and a focus on small, riveting hand gestures are all supported by a symbiotic collaboration of movement, music, and an interesting use of footlights. The audience is encouraged to look, listen, and think in new ways. What is your darkness, what are the challenges of your life, and how do you adjust?\n\nThe program also included the tri-part Last Call (2016), a three-part work (solo, trio, and a duet that re-introduced returning company member Angela Palmisano, who performed in the trio). In the solo section, Beaumont is elegant, while Ernstes, Mavrophilipos-Flint, and Palmisano take a witty turn in the trio, and Comerford and Huey close with reassuring weight-sharing. The songs accompanying these explorations (self-described by Foster as “whimsical” and as a juxtaposition of gracefulness and awkward gestures, lyrical grace and protective gestures in a review I wrote for The Richmond Times Dispatch, Sept. 30, 2016, https://richmond.com/entertainment/dance-review-starr-foster-dance-project-fifteen/article_7c259614-bb43-533d-9bd0-c6e0c4d85600.html) are “Mon Dieu” (My God) and “Le Foule” (The Crowd), sung by Eith Piaf, and “Au Suivant” (Next), performed by Jacques Brel.\n\nThe company also performed Sisterhood (2022), inspired by a story written by Judith Bice and first performed for Foster’s Page to Stage II show, part of a series Foster plans to continue in December. (The company is currently accepting flash/sudden poetry submissions for Page to Stage III.) Sisterhood a duo about a toxic, dependent, love/hate sibling relationship, was performed by Madison Ernstes and Molly Huey. The dancers’ identical brown dresses only emphasize the inequality of their relationship. Michael Jarett has added some stunning lighting, including tree patterns on the floor that lead us to where the Barbies are buried. Chilling and presumably authentic, Sisterhood makes me glad I’m an only child.\n\n———-\n\nJulinda D.

Broad St., RVA 23220\n\nPerformances: March 15-April 7, 2024\n\nTicket Prices: $40\n\nInfo: (804) 390-3390; http://www.virginiarep.org\n\nThis is a rare (for me) re-review. I first saw this production of Zero Hour at the Weinstein Jewish Community Center nearly a year ago (“Jason Marks is Zero Mostel,” RVArt Review, April 6, 2023, https://jdldancesrva.com/2023/04/06/jason-marks-is-zero-mostel/). But, humor me. Don’t read or re-read that review until after you read this one, and I’ll do the same. I won’t go back and re-read that first review until I finish writing this one.\n\nWith this VaRep partnership, while the location is different, Debra Clinton is still the director, and Jason Marks is still Zero Mostel. This time, the story and the script were familiar, but the production was just as fresh and vital as it had been the first time. This did not feel like a re-run; Mostel was such a complex and dynamic person that there was still much to learn that I had missed the first time, or that I saw with new eyes after the passage of time – and world events.\n\nJason Marks dives so deeply into the character that it is easy to forget he is an actor – we are spending an evening with Zero Mostel. Samuel Joel “Zero” Mostel was born February 28, 1915 (my birthday, but 4 decades before me) in Brooklyn, NY (as was I).\n\nAs a comedian, Mostel rose in stature to become a headliner at New York’s Café Society, a popular night spot and as an actor, Mostel specialized in comic roles: he was, perhaps, best known for his portrayal of Tevya in Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway.\n\nSomewhere along the way, during the presidency of Harry S. Truman, the USA became embroiled in blacklisting activities. After World War II, the USA and Russia became involved in a “Cold War,” and People – particularly actors and other creatives – who were suspected of being members of or sympathizing with the Communist Party – were brought before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) where they were questioned and expected to name names. Many citizens were tried, and many actors were blacklisted or prevented from working in film, television, or on stage. Mostel (or maybe I should say the playwright, Jim Brochu) mentions a few well-known names who were caught up in this wide-ranging net, including the renowned choreographer Jerome Robbins and the comedian and actress Lucille Ball, TV star Phil Silvers, screen writer Ring Lardner, Jr., and screen writer Martin Berkeley who is described in Zero Hour as “the Babe Ruth of stool pigeons.”\n\nOther victims of the Red Scare: Orson Wells, Burgess Meredith (credited, in the script, with the line, “hold onto your tits, it’s Zero Hour!”), Arthur Miller, Charlie Chaplin, Lena Horne, Langston Hughes, Pete Seeger, Gypsy Rose Lee, Artie Shaw, Dashiell Hammett, and the list goes on and on and on…\n\nThere are many memorable moments in Zero Hour, both dramatic and historic. The one-hander paints a vivid picture of Mostel’s journey “from blacklist to White House in 10 years.” We learn of Mostel’s tumultuous love affair with his second wife, Kate. A former Radio City Music Hall Rockette, Mostel’s Orthodox Jewish parents did not accept Kate because she wasn’t Jewish, and his parents never met Kate or their two grandchildren.\n\nThen there’s the horrible bus accident in 1960 that nearly ended his life as well as his career, leaving him crippled and in pain. But he stubbornly avoided amputation, and went on to star in Waiting for Godot, Rhinoceros, and the Broadway musical, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Marks shares all of this and more with a wild and vivid mixture of humor, sarcasm, and melodrama while his character is being interviewed by an invisible rookie reporter. “Why do I call you putz?” Mostel asks the report early in the interview, “because I don’t know your name!”\n\nMostel warms up to his interview as we warm up to him. The interview takes place in Mostel’s West 28th Street painter’s loft. In addition to being a prolific and popular performer, Mostel was also a visual artist whose abstract paintings have been sold at auction and displayed in galleries and museums. My notes from the show list 5,000 paintings, 15 Broadway shows, and 25 movies.\n\nZero Hour is an engaging tour de force that is equally entertaining and educational. And now, I feel, is the time to go back and read what I said about Zero Hour the first time I saw it:\n\n“Zero Hour is one of the funniest shows I’ve ever seen and it appears to have been a perfect vehicle for Jason Marks.” – Yes, I still hold this opinion!\n\n“Zero Hour is a skillful balance of biography and entertainment. For those unfamiliar with Zero Mostel, it is informative, and for those who were already fans, it might reveal a few unknown nuggets.” – Again, I second that first impression.\n\n“All of this, and more, is lovingly and capably captured by Marks under the director of Debra Clinton. Clinton, in the Director’s notes, paid homage to Mostel’s individuality – his commitment to standing up for what he believed even to the detriment of his career – “his honesty, passion, and empathy.” – ditto\n\nAnd finally, I often find it weird to read things I’ve written previously, but this holds true. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it: Sometimes it was hard to tell where Marks ended and Mostel began. I am sure playwright Jim Brochu who originally starred in his own play, would approve of Marks’ interpretation.” There are a FEW opportunities remaining to see this production of Zero Hour. I suggest you go see it. You won’t be sorry.\n\n———-\n\nJulinda D. Lewis is a dancer, teacher, and writer who was born in Brooklyn, NY and now lives in Eastern Henrico County.

Scheuer\n\nWorld Premiere: March 19, 2024, Richmond Ballet, Richmond Ballet Studio Theatre, Richmond, VA\n\nThe Background\n\nThe four choreographers selected for The New Works Festival are each given 25 hours to work with their cast. The result is a 10-minute original work, either a full ballet, an excerpt of a longer ballet, or a work-in-progress.\n\nThe New Works Festival was started in 2008 as a way for choreographers – both new and established – to introduce their creative ideas to the Richmond Ballet dancers and audiences.\n\nThis year, one of the choreographers was Ira White. The home-grown dancer and now rehearsal assistant and choreographer is an 11-year member of the company (three years with the apprentice company, RBII, now re-branded as the Studio Company, and eight years with the main company) and got his start as a member of the Richmond Ballet’s Minds In Motion Youth Program.\n\nThe Review\n\nThe program opened with the heart-thumping “restlessness of the soul” of Emily Adams “Ghost at the Party.” The ensemble was led by Jack Miller, Izabella Tokev, Aleksey Babayev, and Christian Renforth. The women’s corseted dresses with filmy skirts paired with the men’s bare chests lent an air of romanticism as well as mystery to this ballet by Emily Adams, a Principal with Battel West (Salt Lake City, UT).\n\nFrom there, we ventured to Last Touch, by Andrea Schermoly,123 Resident Choreographer of the Louisville Ballet (KY). Set to the “Adagietto” movement of Gustav Mahler’s Fifth Symphony,” the ballet features a beautiful opening and a moving, organic duet.\n\nRicardo Graziano, a Principal dancer with the Sarasota Ballet (FL) brought us One Step Closer, a surprisingly lyrical ballet set to two etudes by Philip Glass. Eri Nishihara and Christian Renforth led the ensemble in this satisfyingly pared down leotard ballet.\n\nRichmond Ballet’s own Ira White earned a standing ovation with his jazzy Triple Step, set to selections by Alex da Kid Gil Scott-Heron, Jamie xx, Yussef Dayes, Venna, and Charlie Stacey. The upbeat, colorful, and flirtatious work visually borrowed from a 1950s sock hop and dynamically reminded me, nostalgically, of the phenomenal group works of Talley Beatty and Donald McKayle.\n\nAll costumes were designed by Emily Morgan, and lighting by Nathan W. Scheuer, both talented members of the Richmond Ballet team.\n\nThe Richmond Ballet’s annual New Works Festival did not disappoint, and it is highly likely that we will see more from one or more of the 2024 choreographers. For many of us, after all, the New Works Festival was our introduction to Ma Cong. He presented Ershter Vals for the 2009 New Works Festival and will become the company’s the Artistic Director when Stoner Winslett completes the transition to Founding Artistic Director on July 1.\n\nThe Author\n\nJulinda D.

Lewis\n\nAt: The Basement, 300 East Broad St, RVA 23219\n\nPerformances: March 14-30, 2024\n\nTicket Prices: $22\n\nInfo: https://5thwalltheatre.ludus.com/index.php or https://www.5thwalltheatre.org/\n\nUnaffordable housing. Gentrification. Homelessness. These are serious issues that Philip Ridley has addressed in a two-act dark comedy, a satire that crosses the line from morality to immorality again and again and again.\n\nJill and Ollie are expecting their first child, but they reside in a drug and crime ridden neighborhood – Red Ocean Terrace. One day they receive a miracle; a hand-delivered letter offers the too-good-to-be-true deal of a free house. The house is in need of renovation, and therein lies the thick of the plot. The young couple accidentally discovers an unorthodox method of renovating their house, room by room. This involves Ollie driving the streets in search of anonymous homeless “renovators” – the “vermin” of the title. (For an explanation of the “radiant” part, you’ll need to see the show to figure it out.)\n\n5th Wall’s Creative Producer, Kaitlin Paige Longoria, plays the role of Jill and Matt Mitchell is Ollie. Longoria wears a child-like dress with short socks and a bow in her hair, while Mitchell wears a button down shirt and – I think – khakis. Jill is a bit manipulative, and Matt somewhat of a push-over. They both look fresh, clean cut, and innocent, and speak clearly in standard English, all of which makes their nefarious renovation activities all the more creepy.\n\nMiss Dee, their ersatz realtor/benefactor, who represents a government program for Social Regeneration Through the Creation of Dream Homes, knows entirely too much about them. Ollie seems to protest briefly, but then both he and Jill all too easily accept that Miss Dee seems to have psychic abilities. But it’s worse than that. Miss Dee’s red coat subtly or not-so-subtly reminds us of Satan, and at the end she addresses the audience with a stack of contracts and offers for us to accept.\n\nEmily Adler, who plays the snide and omniscient Miss Dee, also briefly takes on the role of Kay, one of the homeless “renovators.” This scene brought me near tears, as Kay, after sharing the testimony of her traumatic childhood and life on the streets, gladly offers herself as a sacrifice, giving Jill a kiss on the cheek before heading off to meet her demise at the end of Ollie’s “magic wand.” Whew!\n\nAs disturbing as it was, I was able to follow the story and found a certain clarity and logic until the end, when Jill and Ollie held a garden party – “the birthday party from hell,” for their son’s first birthday. During the party, they enact the roles of all the guests – their nearby neighbors – using different body language and accents for each couple. This section was simultaneously hilarious and even more disturbing than the main storyline that led up to it. It was as if the characters morphed and time-travelled from a Get Out situation to a Monty Python platform, from a classic morality play to a really bad Saturday Night Live skit.\n\nRadiant Vermin is performed with a minimalistic set designed by Daniel Allen. A simple white wall – wainscotting or molding, I think it’s called – and a trio of matching white boxes with hinged lids that hold the few simple props, such as some candle sticks and party hats. There is no other furniture and we depend on the actors to create the changes of scene.\n\nBoth Ollie and Jill frequently speak directly to the audience, as does Miss Dee at the end. Ollie and Jill share the task of narrating the story, starting after the birth of their first child, then going back in time in an extended flashback with breaks to inform the audience of the changes in time and location.\n\nDuring the garden party, Ollie experiences a mental breakdown and when they are alone Jill begins to see and hear things, and is eventually overcome by a choking sensation that we can attribute to her conscience. Ollis is also briefly overcome by this choking, but neither of them is willing to give up their pursuit of more and more material things, even if it costs them everything.\n\nRadiant Vermin leaves much to the audience’s imagination, and Longoria and Mitchell prove to be pretty effective story tellers. Director Morrie Piersol successfully lures us in so that we barely realize when we begin to support the atrocities committed by this oh-so-ordinary couple and we feel uncomfortable – and rightly so – when this is brought to our attention. I could hardly believe two hours had passed at the end of the show. If you have a strong moral compass, this show may not be for you. But if you are intrigued by the weird or enjoy psychological thrillers, or – like me – have a penchant for reading about mass murderers, this might just be your cup of tea.\n\n———-\n\nJulinda D.

Lewis\n\nPresented By: Richmond Shakespeare\n\nAt: Cramer Center for the Arts, The Steward School, 11600 Gayton Rd., RVA 23238\n\nPerformances: March 7-24, 2024\n\nTicket Prices: $22-$47 [Adults $47; Seniors 65+ with ID $42; Military with ID $22; Students $22]\n\nInfo: (804) 340-0115 or http://www.richmondshakespeare.org\n\nWhat happens after “happily ever after?”\n\nSondheim and Lapine’s extravagant musical, Into the Woods (1987), has a lot going on. For one thing, there is a large cast of characters drawn from various Grimm’s fairy tales, from Little Red Riding Hood to Jack (of the magic beans and giant fame). There are princesses in towers (Rapunzel) and elsewhere (Cinderella) and princes who do not live up to expectations for “happily ever after” – Cinderella’s prince and Rapunzel’s prince, who are brothers with lustful, wandering eyes for the purpose of this plot. There are peasants and royalty, a wicked witch, a wolf with pedophilic tendencies, and a little girl with an implied eating disorder. There is a narrator that the other characters, in a rare show of solidarity, throw under the bus – and that’s just for starters. And just in case you were wondering – as you should have been – despite the Disney inspired costumes and light-hearted, guffaw-inducing moments that pepper Act 1, this is not a family-friendly show. Half the lead characters meet untimely deaths in Act 2. The bloody demise of those who are smushed by the giant’s foot is indicated by a red wash on the background, and sometimes accompanying sound effects.\n\nBe careful what you wish for.\n\nAt the center of the main plot we find The Baker and The Baker’s Wife (Durron Marquis Tyre-Gholson and Maggie Marlin-Hess). The childless couple wish more than anything for a baby, but soon discover that their barrenness is the result of a witch’s curse that goes back a generation when The Baker’s father helped himself to the witch’s garden. Tyre-Gholson (who, much to my surprise, is making his Richmond Shakespeare debut) deftly establishes himself as a reluctant hero. He tries on the cloak of an alpha male, but it doesn’t fit him well, yet we find ourselves cheering for him and his persistence in the face of probable defeat as he sets off on a life changing scavenger hunt in the woods. Marlin-Hess, similarly, achieves a delicate balance. She is, at once, the supportive wife of the baker, a woman with an independent mind and a resolute disposition (think, by any whatever means necessary), who holds an emergent passion that finds unforeseen fulfillment in the woods.\n\nThe prettier the flower, the farther from the path.\n\nInto the Woods is very much an ensemble show, with strong leads and strong voices singing what I would characterize as challenging music, but some characters nevertheless stand out. My hands-down favorite is Little Red Riding Hood (Gracie Berneche) who wrings every last drop of humor and drama from each line she speaks. Now, normally, it is bad manners to mention an actor’s size, but in this case, Berneche’s stature is key to her role. Constantly referred to as a “little girl,” this Riding Hood makes a running joke of scarfing down the goodies she’s supposed to be taking to Grandma’s house. She deliberately talks with her mouth full, and creates one of the show’s funniest physical comedy moments as she and The Baker’s Wife juggle sweets and cakes as Riding Hood tries to fill her basket – a basket, by the way, that she commandeered from The Baker’s Wife. Berneche’s childlike allure makes it all more creepy when The Wolf (Terence Sullivan) peppers her with sexual innuendo, while diverting her from the path to her grandmother’s house in the woods. The dual role of The Wolf/Cinderella’s Prince emphasizes the lustful, narcissistic nature of both characters as they seduce, respectively, Little Red Riding Hood and The Baker’s Wife, in the woods. Sullivan’s dual roles are masterfully delicious and shiver-inducing – perhaps playing on the appeal of the bad boy. But also, the wolf’s ears, tail, and leather jacket are one of the best, most fun costumes, as well.\n\n“You’re so nice. You’re not good, you’re not bad, You’re just nice. I’m not good, I’m not nice, I’m just right. I’m the witch.\n\nGoing back to the idea that this is an ensemble, it seems both appropriate and anathema that The Witch (Susan Sanford) had the star’s turn during the closing bows. The Witch, after all, is the only character that has the ability to fill in any of the backstory. At the same time, she does not have the most lines or greatest stage time. But Sanford’s rich vocals and The Witch’s makeover from old hag to bewitching diva, are worthy of recognition. Speaking of which, The Witch’s Act 2 costume and the costumes and wigs of Cinderella’s Stepmother (Hannah Zold Story) and Stepsisters Florinda (Katherine S. Wright) and Lucinda (Kylee Márquez-Downie) reminded me of drag queens – but without the expected sassiness. The Witch loses her powers and Florinda and Lucinda have their eyes pecked out. These characters’ journey into the woods do not bring about the desired results.\n\nSlotted spoons don’t hold much soup.\n\nIn my humble opinion, Jack’s Mother (Lauren Leinhaas-Cook) was decidedly more evil than The Witch. She certainly wouldn’t win any awards for mother of the year. She berates and belittles Jack, then defends him when it’s time for him to face the consequences of his actions. These are the actions of an enabler. This role gives Leinhaas-Cook an opportunity to enjoy being nasty, and we don’t feel any great loss at her accidental demise. Let’s face it, Jack (Lukas D’Errico) would never be able to grow up under her nagging eye. In the end, he’s left looking for someone to take care of him, because his mother never taught him how to be an adult. She just sent him off on fruitless and self-serving quests into the woods. The Witch, who had whisked away Rapunzel (Sara Dabney Tisdale) from her parents at birth was no model mother, either. Locked away in a tower in the woods, Rapunzel ended up the single mother of twins, lost her Prince, her mind, and eventually her life as well. Apparently, one does not develop good life coping skills living in isolation in the woods.\n\nCareful the things you say…children will listen.\n\nWhile Act 1 is a quest to find fulfillment of all the characters’ wishes, Act 2 shows us what happens after “happily ever after.” With Act 1 running approximately 90 minutes, it almost seems as if the show is over at the end of Act 1. But wait, there’s more. Act 2 shows us the consequences of getting what you wished for. There is a fantastic scene in which the surviving characters – after much of the slaughter and bloodshed – all point the finger of blame at each other: The Baker, The Baker’s Wife, The Witch, Jack, Jack’s Mother, Little Red Riding Hood (who is never at a loss for snarky comments, with accompanying facial expressions and body language). It’s a comedy. It’s a parody. It’s a satire. It’s a musical. It’s a morality play. It’s a metaphor for Life. Into the Woods is where life happens. Some emerge triumphant, some do not emerge at all. As 2010 Internet sensation Antoine Dodson once said, “Hide yo’ kids, hide yo’ hide yo’ husbands ‘cause they’re rapin’ everybody out here.” Go see Into the Woods, but leave your kids at home.\n\n—–\n\nJulinda D.

RIDE’S AMERICAN BEACH HOUSE*\n\n“If one of us is brilliant, maybe it’s not you,” or\n\nFour Queer Women Lift-off on the Eve of Sally Ride’s Historic First Space Flight\n\nA Theater Review by Julinda D. Lewis\n\nBy: Yes, And! Theatrical Company\n\nAt: The Firehouse 1609 West Broad St., Richmond, RVA 23220\n\nPerformances: March 7-23, 2024\n\nTicket Prices: $37 general admission\n\nInfo: Email: yesandrva@gmail.com; Website: yesandrva.org; Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/yesandrva/\n\nWhen I say that Liza Birkenmeier’s 4-character, one-act play, DR. RIDE’S AMERICAN BEACH HOUSE is weird, please understand that is an observation, not a judgment. There is a reason why the Yes, And! Theatrical Company – now in its second year of production –- chose this play. I suspect it has something to do with exploration (inner, and self, more than space) and identity (woman as subject, not object, as well as gender and sexuality), and history (personal history as well as the history of Dr. Sally Ride and the American space program).\n\nSet on a rooftop in St. Louis in June 1983, on the eve of the launch of the Challenger space shuttle that carried Dr. Sally Ride, the first American woman to go into space, DR. RIDE’S AMERICAN BEACH HOUSE is both non-linear and non-conforming. Two long-time friends, both poetry majors who have apparently simultaneously run into a writing block, come to the rooftop for the weekly meeting of The Two Serious Ladies Book Club. The club is named for a novel by Jane Bowles in which two women explore – depending in which review you read – “living outside themselves” or descend in debauchery. After forming the book club, however, our leading ladies, Harriet (Ashley Thompson) and Matilda (Rachel Marrs) realize they don’t really like to read, so they spend the time drinking beer and talking.\n\nOne day, their complacent little world is shaken up when (a) Harriet shares a harrowing tale of a sexual encounter with a stranger – a bearded biker, no less – and (b) Matilda invites a new friend, Meg (Kasey Britt) whose insight sheds new light on the friends’ sexual tension and life in general, and (c) their lives are all shifted by the imminent space launch that is the main topic on their rooftop radio.\n\nHarriet is high strung and annoying, but about two thirds of the way through we find out she has good reason to be, and in spite of her irksome character, we cannot tear ourselves away from the story she weaves throughout. Perhaps Harriet’s calling was not for poetry, but for fiction or drama…Matilda, who has a husband and a sick child at home, would rather spend her time with Harriet, and is given to bursting out in song – revealing that Rachel Marrs has a stunningly beautiful singing voice and can even attempt a decent Irish step or two.\n\nMost intriguing, however, is Meg. Back stories and character development are not a main point of DR. RIDE’S AMERICAN BEACH HOUSE, so we know that Meg works at a hospital across the street from where Harriet and Norma live, and may – or may not –- be a nurse. She does, however, provide some music therapy for Harriet in the midst of her breakdown, which leads to one of this play’s most delightful moments.\n\nThe fourth character is Norma (Jacqueline Jones) – who is either Harriet’s landlady or neighbor. At any rate, it seems that Norma is the caretaker of the Ivan Brock House, named for fictional poet and the house where Harriet lives. Norma is concerned with three things: safety, money, and Harriet’s leaky air conditioning unit. Jones’ two or three appearances are all too brief, as Norma, who seems to be on the far right of some spectrum or another, shares complaints and almost incidentally drops pearls of wisdom and insight on the younger women.\n\nDR. RIDE’S AMERICAN BEACH HOUSE is directed by Kelsey Cordrey with a light touch, a good dose of wit, and a loving respect for words. Cordrey and the cast make us see or at least ponder connections between barbecue and beer, a beach house and a rooftop, an astronaut launching into space and an ordinary person (is there such a thing?) exploring the unexplored landscape of their life. It’s only about 90 minutes long, and the first few minutes are rather slow going, but about midway through – and even more so afterwards – it becomes clear that there is more to explore here than at first meets the eye.\n\nCordrey explains at least part of the “why” in her director’s note: “Pretty much every queer person I know has felt the urge to “go away” before. To escape to a place, whether literal or figurative, what would be more. More accepting, more fulfilling, more exciting, or more loving”.\n\nAdam Dorland has designed a simple but effective rooftop setting with a couple of chairs, some stacked crates that serve as a table, an HVAC unit, and lots of brick wall constructed at an angle that juts slightly off the edge of the stage. Candace Hudert’s sound design is mostly subtle, and makes use of the ubiquitous 1980s boom box and cassette tapes – remember those???\n\nIf you like your theater to have a clear beginning, middle and end, and to tie up all the loose ends with a happy ending, DR. RIDE’S AMERICAN BEACH HOUSE won’t fulfill those needs. If you like theater that asks questions and challenges you to think about why things are the way they are, then this is your kind of play. And if you’re undecided, or not sure, I would urge you to give it a try and discuss it after – maybe with three friends, over a bottle of wine or some beers.\n\nFUN FACTS ABOUT DR. SALLY RIDE\n\nSally Kristen Ride (1951-2012) was a physicist and the first female American astronaut\n\nSally Ride was married to Steven Hawley (1982-1987) and had a long-term partner, Tam O’Shaughnessy (1985-2012)\n\nDr. Ride did not publicly reveal her sexuality until her death, in a carefully worded obituary she wrote before she died\n\nIn 1972, while an undergraduate at Stanford University, Sally Ride played tennis great Billy Jean King in a mixed doubles exhibition\n\nOne morning, at breakfast, in 1977, while she was a doctoral student at Stanford University, Sally Ride read an article in the student newspaper that NASA was opening up applications to women for the first time, so she applied\n\nDr. Ride’s younger sister, Bear, is a Presbyterian minister – she is also queer\n\nSally Ride was a Trekkie\n\nSally Ride and her partner Tam O’Shaughnessy co-authored several science books for children\n\nIn 2013 Sally Ride was posthumously awarded the nation’s highest honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom; President Barack Obama presented the award to Tam O’Shaughnessy Source: https://today.ucsd.edu/story/20-things-you-might-not-know-about-sally-ride\n\n*ONE FINAL FUN FACT\n\nThe Astronaut Beach House is a two-story building located in Cape Canaveral, FL use to house astronauts prior to their launch.

Lewis\n\nPresented by HATTheatre\n\nAt: HATTheatre, 1124 Westbriar Dr., Richmond, VA 23238\n\nPerformances: March 2-15, 2024\n\nTicket Prices: $30 General Admission. $25 Seniors/Students/Military. $20 Youth\n\nInfo: 804-343-6364 or https://hattheatre.org\n\nSet on the Brooklyn Bridge where five strangers go to seek solitude and solace, FROM UP HERE (2012) is a uniquely moving and relatable one-act musical.\n\nThere’s Henry (Doug Schneider), an older man, a widower who comes to the bridge to reminisce about his beloved wife of forty years. They met on the bridge by accident – literally. Emily (Elise Cumbia) is a sensitive young woman struggling with the news of an unnamed but apparently life-threatening illness. Her illness – likely some form of cancer – makes her reconsider her commitment to her boyfriend. Emily’s long-term boyfriend Dan (Erik DeMario) is a photographer whose current project, taking impromptu photographs of strangers on the Brooklyn Bridge, is instrumental in creating intersections between these strangers.\n\nJill (Alanna Wilson) is a kind young woman who discovers she is pregnant after a rare one-night stand with a man who subsequently ghosted her. And finally, there is Alan (Aaron Hoffman) is a harried businessman who seems always on the brink of calamity, leaving him little time for human interaction.\n\nSince it’s Sunday, I’ll take a page from my preaching friends and offer just three points about this play, and then you’ll be free to go see it for yourself.\n\nFirst, each and every one of these characters is likeable. They are people we care about, and even though this one-act musical runs for under 90 minutes, we feel that we get to know the character of each of these people. It doesn’t matter what happened before we met them – or before they met each other. What matters is that now we know them, and we care about them.\n\nSecond, each and every one of these actors can sing, but I (who am NOT a singer or musician) was especially impressed by Erik DeMario and Elise Cumbia. DeMario, at times, reminded me of an opera singer. It comes as no surprise to find, in DeMario’s bio, that he has performed with the Virginia Opera, VCU Opera, and the Richmond Symphony, among other companies. Cumbia’s clear tone reflects her background in musical theatre and no doubt serves her well with her work with her church choir.\n\nSeveral times all five share the stage, singing the show’s motif: “This isn’t the end. This is the beginning.” This isn’t the end of life – despite the implications that, at some point, each has considered jumping off the bridge. No, it isn’t the end of life, but the beginning of a new phase of life, and during the course of a year, they help each other through the trials and tribulations that have led them to this point.\n\nAnd finally, because I promised three points, FROM UP HERE seems different from most musicals. For one thing, it’s just one-act. In my experience, musicals tend to run longer than non-musical productions. Also, as I mentioned earlier, FROM UP HERE reminded me somewhat of an opera. The songs were not catchy, sing-along tunes, but seemed designed with the intention of moving the narrative. And then, this musical is not high school bullies or rivalries or romance. It is about change and choices and consequences. Why did author Lambert – a Texas born actor and writer who, after living and working in New York, now lives and works in the UK – set this musical very specifically on the Brooklyn Bridge? Perhaps it was because the Brooklyn Bridge is a kind of suspension bridge, and each of these five characters is suspended between their past and their future.\n\nThe play is set against a backdrop of a painting that strongly suggests the Brooklyn Bridge. As one who, for many years, walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and back every Saturday morning for exercise (followed by pancakes), it would take a feat of engineering to produce an accurate rendering of the historic bridge.\n\nLambert’s script calls for four musicians or instruments (piano, reed such as flute, clarinet or saxophone, violin + glockenspiel, and cello) but notes that the music can be performed with only a piano. The artistic team for this production decided to use piano and violin, with musical director Leilani Fenick and violinist Kristen Presley seated upstage center. The music was wonderful, as the two not only accompanied the songs but also supplied the soundscape, such as telephone ringtones. Somehow, inexplicably, having the musicians so present made me feel less intrusive as an audience member, less voyeuristic, and more like a participant observer.\n\nFrank Foster’s direction elicits an authenticity from each character that helps lure in the audience, and once there, we are fully committed. FROM UP HERE, which could allude to the nearly 120 feet the bridge soars above the East River or the nearby Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, is a surprisingly unexpected treat: a delightful, warm, and relatable musical that leaves a lingering impression.\n\n———-\n\nJulinda D.
