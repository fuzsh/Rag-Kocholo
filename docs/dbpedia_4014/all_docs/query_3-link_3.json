He also won two European titles and was a 32-time German champion in various classes. His greatest and later best-known moment came in 1956 at the Melbourne Olympics when he earned the first German gold medal after World War II together with Meinrad Miltenberger in the K2 over 1,000 metres. After his active career Scheuer worked as a coach for both the youth and seniors. For his sporting achievements he was awarded with the Silver Laurel Leaf by the German president, and the Golden Badge of Honor by the German Canoe Federation."
