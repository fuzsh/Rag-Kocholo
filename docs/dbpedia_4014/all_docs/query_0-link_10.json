        "text": "The Haggadah, which is reproduced here, was written and illustrated by Moshe ben Nathan HaKohen, a disciple of Rabbi Moshe Sofer, also know as Chatam Sofer, Pressburg’s famous rabbi. He dedicated it to his master, who, in turn, presented it to his wife Sarl, as stated on the title page of the Haggadah.\n\nThe manuscript artist completed the Haggadah in the summer of 1816.\n\nThe Chatam Sofer married Sarl, who was a daughter of the celebrated Rabbi Akiva Eger—then rabbi of Maerkisch-Friedland and later rabbi of Posen—in 1812. It was the second marriage for both. He was widowed, she—a widow with two small daughters. The wedding took place in Eisenstadt, Burgenland, the birthplace of Rabbi Akiva Eger, where relatives of the bride resided. The couple had a large family. Sarl died in 1832.\n\nThe Chatam Sofer was born in Frankfurt on the Main in 1762. He studied in his hometown under Rabbi Nathen Adler and Rabbi Pinhas Horowitz and was also a student of Rabbi Tevel Scheuer and his son Michel in Mayence.\n\nAfter serving as rabbi of Dresnitz, Moravia, and Mattersdorf, Burgenland, he was chosen rabbi of Pressburg in 1806 and held this position until his death in 1839.\n\nHe was known throughout the Jewish world, both for his vast erudition and exceptional piety. Recognized as the greatest rabbinic authority of his time, Halachic enquiries were addressed to him from far and near. He led the struggle against those who sought to reform Judaism and left his imprint on large segments of Hungarian Jewry. His numerous disciples spread his teachings in the communities they served. Inspired by his love for the Land of Israel and his support for the Jews living there, a number of his disciples settled in the Holy Land.\n\nDuring the one hundred years after his death—until the destruction of the community in the Nazi era—his post of rabbi and Rosh Yeshiva of Pressburg was occupied first by his oldest son and subsequently by his grandson and great-grandson.\n\nThe Chatam Sofer’s writings included responsa, novellae on the Talmud, sermons and sacred poetry.\n\nIt was his custom to conduct the Seder until late into the night, many times until one or two o’clock in the morning, translating and explaining the Haggadah word for word for the benefit of the children.\n\nHis wife had before her the beautiful Haggadah, written by Moshe ben Nathen HaKohen, with which her husband had presented her.\n\nThis Haggadah features in addition to the text, a German translation—in Hebrew mashait script—with explanatory notes. It is illustrated with several full-page pictures.\n\nOn the page following the title page, the scribe wrote in circles that the Haggadah belonged to Sarl, the wife of Rabbi Moshe Sofer, adding praises for both.\n\nThis Haggadah, a reproduction of which was first issued in Germany in 1924, was used in Pressburg and, probably, also written there—hence our title ״The Pressburg Haggadah, 1816״.\n\nThe present facsimile edition was published by the Diskin Orphan Home of Israel for its friends and supporters in appreciation of their generosity. We are indebted to the Haggadah collector Mr. Maurice H. Orodenker of Philadelphia and to his wife Edith for having made available a copy of the original facsimile edition to Rabbi Munish Weintraub, director of the Diskin Orphan Home, who made great efforts to have this Haggadah published.\n\nTovia Preschel"
