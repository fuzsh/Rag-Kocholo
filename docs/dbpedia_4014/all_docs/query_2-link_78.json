        "text": "Shadows are intriguing phenomena. They do not have mass or energy. So, they are unable to have some basic characteristics of the objects of which they are shadows: they cannot move by themselves and they cannot experience the same kind of changes. At first sight, any theory of perception can skip this optical phenomenon or look at it only as a side-effect. Actually, in order to be seen objects must be illuminated and one of the consequences of this is that they project a shadow over the surrounding space. Is that all? In this paper I will argue that, from a phenomenological point of view (or at least from a Husserlian oriented phenomenology), shadows, with their specific hyletic data, must be considered as an element of the process of constitution of spatial-temporal objectivities. In other words, shadows no less than other predicates, like extension or hardness, although in a different manner, belong to the a priori structure of those objectivities. This means that their ontologica...\n\nExperiencing the landscape and skyscape in which for example an astronomically relevant ancient site is located allows for a deep exploration of possible meanings of embedded alignments. In Skyscape Archaeology phenomenology of the landscape is commonly used. Following from this approach and similar to the phenomenology of nature inspired by Goethe, a deep and detailed engagement with a site and standing stones can offer the opportunity to tap into meanings so far overlooked. The following will illustrate how the experience of shadows cast by and on a standing stone at Gardom's Edge can add to an archaeoastronomical narrative. During the summer solstice the stone seems to lose its shadow or embody it in stone. When looking at anthropological evidence, the shadow can be an essential part of any living being. It becomes clear that a monument with a lost shadow has gained an added dimension of power and liminality; thereby possibly constraining its position within the landscape. Using this example, a more general phenomenology of shadows will be developed that can allow other researchers to find their way into a deeper and richer engagement with a site or monument. Ultimately, it will allow another avenue towards skyscape archaeology.\n\nOptics is perhaps the ruling science of the Gothic mode. Themes of light and darkness, obscurity and illumination, flourish in the genre, resonating with Edmund Burke’s explorations in his 1757 Philosophical Enquiry, which was contemporary with the rise of the Gothic novel, and with the central symbol of Enlightenment itself (with which Gothic narratives always contend in various ways). Gothic monsters come with conventions that help act as genre markers; one of the most familiar of these conventions is an optical one: the vampire’s lack of reflection in mirrors. Vampire fictions continually play with the attributes of the vampire as passed on from folklore or established as conventions in prior narratives; the aversion to sunlight or garlic, the vulnerabilities to sacred symbols, and so on, are all discarded, modified, or rationalized in various ways in each incarnation.1 Given the centrality of optics in Gothic narratives, one such attribute, the motif of non-reflection, is likely...\n\nIn this paper, the archetype of the Child is considered as a psychological presence that fosters creativity and relationality for individuals and groups. The capacity for integrating the shadow aspect of human nature is a crucial psychological solution for reducing harmful biases and projections that negatively impact the subtle and emergent potential of the archetypal presence of the Child, along with the experience of actual children. A working hypothesis is that attentive listening to the voice of the divine child within each person supports processes of personal growth and spiritual transformation, in so doing mending the woundings of colonization and traumas inflicted by families and cultural systems. A Jungian perspective reveals a wound: the forgetting, through abuse or neglect, of the human relationship with the divine child archetype. The problem, from a Jungian perspective, becomes perilous, psychologically speaking: A person cut off from the child has no access to the bri...\n\nVolume two of react/review: a responsive journal for art and architecture explores the spiritual, monstrous, cosmological, and otherworldly within or as forms of political action or resistance. Considering how spiritual themes are entangled with political action or resistance invites new attention to a range of subtle distinctions between manifestations of the “spirit,” whether as methodology, content, and/or the effect of a work. Reproducibility, with its attendant notions of mimicry, copying, and dissemination, also emerges as a key analytic in the contributions to this journal. These ideas are reflected in DJ Morrow’s balloon recreation of Goya’s Saturn Devouring his Son, which appears on this volume’s cover. Like the original on which it is based, Morrow’s piece engages with the monstrous and the political in a moment of crisis. However, its playful use of an everyday medium simultaneously veils and unveils the violence of the scene, demonstrating the power of mimicry to produce new configurations of the macabre and otherworldly. Relatedly, processes of aesthetic reproduction addressed in this compilation also reveal class, race, gender, and cultural identity as factors shaping the form in which the “spirit” emerges in the shadow of political action. Contributing authors address the modern and contemporary eras, engaging with a range of topics from Black life in the Bay area and anti-racism, to monsters in Spanish art, anti-totalitarian politics, cosplay, and the aesthetics of queer Chicana zines, as well as National Socialist black metal bands. Contradictory and subversive ways of knowing and being emerge through these studies as they integrate the supernatural and immaterial into art historical discourse, allowing us to recognize the spirit in the shadow."
