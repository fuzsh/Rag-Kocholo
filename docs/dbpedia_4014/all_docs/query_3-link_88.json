Dame Fortune has smiled on Wesley W. Mitchell, formerly employed in charge of the Chicago & Northwestern railway depot lunch counter here, his inheritance of an estate of $50,000 recently being followed by his marriage to Miss Frances Kuhl, of this city, which was celebrated at St. Boniface church at noon today. The announcement of the marriage will come as a surprise to friends of the couple as it had been quietly arranged and not made public. Mr. Mitchelll arrived in the city a few days ago and immediately following the ceremony, with his bride departed for Chicato where they will remain for a brief visit and then go to Los Angeles, Cal., to make their future home. It was a quiet wedding at St. Boniface church at high noon, only members of the family of the birde being present. Rev. Father Peil officiated and the bridal couple was attended by Miss Josephine Kuhl and John Auermueller. At the home of the bride's parents a dinner was served and Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell immediately left the city. The bride is a daughter of Mrs. Michale Kuhl, 1412 Clark street, and is well known in social circles of the city. For several years she was employed as stenographer in the office of Ex-Lieut. Governor Emil Baensch and later by the Julius Lindstedt company. She is an accomplished young lady endowed with a charming personality and won a wide circle of friends who will rejoice in her new found happiness. Mr. Mitchell is well known in this city, having made his home here for a year in 1899, when he was employed by the C.& N.W. Railway Company in charge of the lunch counter at the depot and his marraiage to Miss Kuhl is the outcome of a friendship formed at that time. In leaving here Mr. Mitchell took up his home at Kankakee, Ill., remaining in the employ of the railway company until a short time ago when, through the death of a relative, he inherited a large fortune of $40,000 to 50,000. During the past few months he has traveled extensively, making his headquarters at Milwaukee. He is a young man of excellent character and business ability. At Los Angeles where he is about to take up his home, he will represent the Metalic Mfg. Co., in which he is interested as a stock holder. Many friends will extend congratulations and well wishes for the future happiness of Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell.

The groom had lost his wife some years ago leaving him with children. ******** Mohrhusen-Fischer. MARRIED: On Wednesday, July 12, 1882, at Manitwooc, Wis., by Emil Baensch, Justice of the Peace, Luebbe T. Mohrhusen, of Manitowoc, and Bertha Fischer, of Reedsville. The wedding was strictly private, being only attended by the relatives and a few intimate friends of the parties. About a year and a half ago, Mr. Mohrhusen became a widower, and his three little boys, one of them a mere baby, became motherless. During the serious and fatal illness of his wife, Miss Bertha Fischer nursed her with an unselfish devotion. And when death claimed its victim, she remained as housekeeper and has ever been like a loving mother to the motherless children. Under such circumstances, the marriage just consummated, can not fail to bring to both parties the peaceful happiness of a complete home. Especially will this be the case with Mr. Mohrhusen, who seems fond of home life, and whose zeal for the proper education of his children is much to be commended. The many congratulations that have poured in on him ever since the important event, show that the well wishes his many friends will accompany his future course in life.

Manitowoc Lake Shore Times, Tuesday, June 20, 1882 P. 4 ***** Matrimonial The latest social event of interest in this village was the wedding of Mr. John L. Moore of Crete, Nebraska and Miss Laura A. Hamilton of Two Rivers which took place at the residence of Mrs. H.C. Hamilton on Washington Street last Saturday afternoon. The ceremony which was performed by Rev. C.B. Stevens of Manitowoc, in the presence of a large number of invited guests, most of whom being relatives of the bride, was brief, yet complete and beautiful, the contracting parties standing, the while, beneath an exquisite marriage bell, made of delicately tinted flowers. The reception rooms and parlors were all abloom with the rarest blossoms of the season and the walls were tastefully decorated for the occasion with ferns and running vines. It really seemed to bad to think that the bride must so soon leave the home that her own hands had helped to render so beautiful. After the ceremony was performed and the supper partaken of, the parties proceeded in carriages to the steamboat landing, where a large number of friends and associates of the bride had gathered to bid her adieu and give her their Godspeed as she left forever the home of her childhood to follow the fortunes of her husband. Mr. Moore is a young man of much more than ordinary ability and is now doing a successful manufacturing business in the West and we believe him to be in every respect worthy of the good fortune he has had in the selection of a wife - Chronicle Manitowoc Tribune - Thurs., Aug. 10, 1876\n\nMOORE: Joseph A. m: 15 Nov. 1903 (co. mar. index v.7 p.272) to: Elizabeth Larson\n\nMOOS: See SHEBESTA\n\nMORAN: John m: 22 May 1859 (co. mar. index v.2 p.215) to: Mary Wats\n\nMORAN: John m: 18 Jan 1871 (co. mar. index. v.4 p.50) to: Ellen Doolin (Moran on state microfiche/Moron on co. mar. index)\n\nMORAN: Martin Martin Moran, conductor, was born in New York City in 1854.

Meeme On Sunday, July 18, Thomas Morris and Margaret Taugher, both of Newton were married in Meeme. The marriage was crowded with both the young and the old. After the marriage was over, the bride's brother delivered a most eloquent address. It was inferior to Mr. John Carey's in the point of patriotism but it tended to show what he knew of the Methodist ministry, for which profession he had been at college this last five years. After the address, the groom treated the crowd which was a large one, then they all gayly proceeded to the residence of the bride's father, headed by the Sheboygan band. Mr. Morris, being one of the temperance society, they all dressed in their uniform and formed a line of procession, marching from the church to the wedding house, where there was a gay and happy time the remainder of the afternoon and night. Happiness, peace and plenty attend them, is all we can wish friend Thomas and his young bride. Manitowoc Tribune - Thurs., July 22, 1875 ***** MARRIED FIFTY YEARS Mr. and Mrs. Thomas E.

Owing to inability of the children to be home for the anniversary today, the formal celebration has been deferred until later, but neighbors and friends showered Mr. and Mrs. Morrisey with well wishes today. Mr. and Mrs. Morrisey have been the parents of eighteen children, ten girls and eight boys, thirteen of whom are living as follows: Dr. Wm. Morrisey, Reedsville; Michael and Patrick, Washington; Prof. Martin of Leopolis; Mrs. Wm. Cunningham, Grimms; Mrs. Thomas Joyce of Wrightstown; Mrs. James O'Connell, Kasson; Mrs. James Mul?ins of Green Bay; Mrs. Henry Lemke, of Appleton; Mrs. Daniel Cavanaugh, Reedsville; Mrs. Lawrence Laughlin, Chicago; Mrs. Maurice Norberg, Chicago; Miss Lillian of Reedsville. Born in Ireland, July 5, 1843, Mr. Morrisey came to Manitowoc in 1850, his family locating in Maple Grove where he has since been a resident. Mr. Morrisey has always been a staunch republican and recalls that his first vote was cast for Abraham Lincoln for president. As youth and man, Mr. Morrisey used to walk to Manitowoc to do his shopping and get his mail, this being the only means of transportation many times though Mr. Morrisey's father owned the first ox team and the first team of horses in Manitowoc county. Mr. Morrisey recalls many trips made by ox team with his father from their home to Manitowoc which occupied all night and all day in making. He has always been a lover of horses and for years was known for the spirited animals he owned. Mr. Morrisey says that he has never held public office because, his father used to say \"An honest man has no business holding office\" and he accepted the statement. Mrs. Morrisey is a native of New York state, born there in 1852 and with her family settled at Meeme. The first child of Mr. and Mrs. Morrisey was carried in arms by the parents to Rapids for baptism. In early days Mr. Morrisey was known as Porcupine Morrisey because of a pompadour he wore. He has had but one photograph taken in forty-five years. Two sisters of Mr. Morrisey reside in the county, being Mrs. Dan Tracy, this city and Mrs. Lawrence Gill of Kasson. Mr. and Mrs. Morrisey for several years past have made their home at Reedsville. They have a large circle of friends in this city who tender congratulations on the anniversary.
