        "text": "R. Alta Charo\n\nRU-486, a drug that interferes with uterine implantation of fertilized eggs, is a safe and effective alternative for early abortions. But it is not available in the United States. In fact, it is unavailable everywhere except France. The reason is not its cost, its side effects, or lack of consumer interest.\n\nIn fact, RU-486 is a captive of the abortion debate that has recently engulfed a number of tangentially related issues, such as appointment of the new director for the National Institutes of Health, the reconstitution of an Ethics Advisory Board to oversee federal funding of in vitro fertilization research, and the federal funding of fetal tissue transplant research for relief of Parkinson's disease symptoms. RU-486 is but the latest addition to this list.\n\nLike the birth control pill, RU-486 has encountered strong resistance from moralists who fear it will trivialize sex, life, and human relations by “bolster[ing] the comparison between taking the drug and swallowing an aspirin” (Glasow, 1990i). These objections often contain statements of concern over women's health or the potential for contraceptive genocide in developing countries. But it is the moral opposition of a minority of Americans that underlies the so far effective campaign to keep this drug from coming to market. “When pro-lifers have the opportunity,” wrote Richard Glasow, education director for the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), “they should emphasize how RU-486 both cheapens the value of human life even more than surgical abortion and contributes to a general decline in moral standards” (Glasow, 1986).\n\nRU-486 is available in France during the first 49 days of amenorrhea for the purpose of terminating a pregnancy, provided that (1) it is taken under a physician's supervision and in conjunction with a follow-up dose of prostaglandin derivative; (2) there is no contraindication to mifepristone (adrenal insufficiency, long-term administration of glucocorticoids, clotting disorders) or to prostaglandins (asthma, severe hypertension); and (3) it is taken in accordance with French abortion law, which requires a one-week waiting period between the request for an abortion and the procedure.\n\nAnecdotal reports of only 90 percent effectiveness and some side effects (including two cardiac complications) were made by Meredeth Turshen of Rutgers University at an October 1990 meeting of the American Public Health Association (Contraceptive Technology, 1990). Turshen reported on conversations with French government researchers unaffiliated with Roussel whose preliminary data had not yet been peer-reviewed or published (Contraceptive Technology, 1990; Voelker, 1990). This was consistent with comments by an inquiry commission chaired by French researcher de Vernejoul that concluded that the prostaglandin follow-up to RU-486 administration posed potentially life threatening complications (Le Quotidien du Médecin, 1990).\n\nPeer-reviewed studies, however, show that RU-486 is safer than suction techniques for early abortion. According to a 1990 study by researchers affiliated with the drug's manufacturer and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, pregnancy terminations reach 98.7 percent effectiveness when 600 milligrams (mg) of mifepristone is followed three days later with a 0.5-mg intramuscular injection of the prostaglandin analogue sulprostone. Side effects were minimal.\n\nOf 2,115 French women using the drug in 1988, in various dosages of prostaglandin analogues, failures included persisting pregnancies (1.0 percent), incomplete expulsions (2.1 percent), and the need for hemostatic procedure (0.9 percent). The average time to expulsion ranged from 4.5 hours to 22.7 hours depending upon the dose of prostaglandin, and on average uterine bleeding continued for 8.9 days (range, 1 to 35 days). Use of the drug was characterized by transient abdominal bleeding after receiving prostaglandin, but few other side effects. One woman of the 2,115 received a blood transfusion. Incomplete abortions were completed by suction technique (Silvestre et al., 1990).\n\nBesides being safer than suction abortions and causing few side effects, RU-486 is relatively inexpensive. An abortion performed by a private physician in the United States costs $500 to $1,000. Clinics usually charge $200 to $300 (Abrams, 1988). In France, the cost of an abortion using RU-486 is approximately $233. This includes the RU-486, the prostaglandin, and three medical visits. Roussel receives $44 for the RU-486. French social security covers 75 percent of the cost, so the client pays $58 (Aubény et al., 1990).\n\nIn France, more than 100 women a day (accounting for a third of all abortions) take RU-486 (Herman, 1989). More than 40,000 women in France (Herman, 1989) and 4,000 women in Britain, China, the United States, and elsewhere have also tried it on an experimental basis (Greenhouse, 1989a). China currently allows women to use RU-486. The drug will probably not, however, play a leading role in the country's contraception and abortion services. Other countries use the drug only on an experimental basis, although it is hoped that it will become widely available in Britain and Scandinavia by mid-1992. It may also become available in other European countries. Although the drug is effective only within the first seven weeks following conception, experts estimate that it could replace one-half to two-thirds of the 30 to 40 million surgical abortions performed annually worldwide (Stein, 1988).\n\nThe prospects for RU-486 in the United States are dim. At best, it could be available by 1997, but that would require several actions that do not seem very likely to occur. A U.S. pharmaceutical company would have to open negotiations almost immediately to obtain the rights to produce and market the drug in this country. Soon thereafter, the firm would have to begin the process of obtaining Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. No U.S. company has yet been willing to take on the expense, an estimated $50 million, and difficulty of obtaining FDA approval, especially in light of concerns about FDA's ability to withstand pressure from the Bush administration and to review the drug dispassionately. Another obstacle is the drug's 5 percent failure rate, which is perceived as a significant potential liability. Finally, and most importantly, marketing this drug in the United States would undoubtedly be a public relations nightmare. Boycott threats at the retail and investment level are real—and so far, effective.\n\nIt seems that only a small, single-product company could withstand these pressures. Family planning and feminist health groups have discussed starting a company devoted to bringing RU-486 to the market, but no concrete progress has been made. Ironically, the biggest stumbling block is the drug's French manufacturer, Groupe Roussel Uclaf, which has refused to license it in the United States. At least six groups of financiers have expressed serious interest in forming a company for U.S. development and distribution, and a coalition of interested feminists, lawyers, and researchers have combined under the name “Reproductive Health Technologies Project” to develop wider public support for the drug. Roussel and its German parent company, Hoechst, however, fear an organized retail and investment boycott in the United States, and not only will not license the drug in the United States but even hesitate to supply it for research on nonabortion applications.\n\nThe company's fears are not groundless. The lives of Roussel executives and their families have reportedly been threatened. Organized campaigns to boycott Roussel products, to block investment in Hoechst, and to seek out potential product liability claims against both have dogged the companies ever since Roussel announced it had developed an “abortion pill.”\n\nReassurance from the U.S. government may be a precondition to persuading Roussel to license the drug here. The company refused to market the drug in France without a direct order from the French Ministry of Health. Roussel has announced it will license RU-486 only to companies in countries whose governments have specifically requested the drug. In the United States, such a request is unlikely, despite the drug's other possible applications in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, breast cancer, menangioma, endometriosis, and even obesity (Carey, 1990; Ullman et al., 1990). “It would be a tragedy to deny cures to Americans with life threatening diseases because of an ideological agenda,” says Congressman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) (Carey, 1990). But that is just what may happen unless there is a surge of support in the United States for the drug's abortion applications. “[Roussel] wants a groundswell of doctors who will run interference for them,” says one researcher. “Then the company, with a Gallic shrug, can tell antiabortion protestors that it was forced to distribute the drug” (Carey, 1990).\n\nFor the moment, limited clinical trials have been completed in the United States; for example, small-scale trials were conducted at the University of Southern California (USC) under the auspices of the New York-based Population Council. Progress toward FDA approval will be slow, however, because the prostaglandins used in the United States in conjunction with RU-486 are different from those used in the European protocols. Even with new trials, once the studies are completed the patent on RU-486 will be close to expiring. Once that happens, the question of licensing (although not FDA approval) becomes moot.\n\nIn the end, it appears that American women are going to be denied this safe, effective form of early abortion for at least the next decade. As shown by the early history of the controversial birth control pill, it appears that in the United States there is a need for much patience.\n\nThe purpose of this case study is to trace the network of political, economic, and historic forces that have converged to slow the introduction of RU-486 into the U.S. market. It is a study of the absence of a decision, that is, the absence of FDA consideration of the drug, the absence of a U.S. license issuance, and the near absence of any government hearings. It is also a story of perceptions: the perception that RU-486 will trivialize abortion, that the abortion controversy makes any new contraceptive or abortifacient commercially risky, and that contraceptive development proceeds without full regard for women's health and safety.\n\nOne persistent theme in this story is that members of the women's health and family planning communities, the pharmaceutical industry, or the antiabortion movement have publicly questioned the sincerity of the public statements made by each other. The NRLC, for example, has consistently complained of distortions in press coverage and scientific journals (Andrusko, 1991). As a result, there is no single authoritative source of information on the motivations of those who have worked to promote or to discourage the development of the so-called abortion pill. It is therefore difficult to present the “truth” about why RU-486 is not likely to be on the U.S. market in the near future."
