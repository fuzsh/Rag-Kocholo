        "meta_description": "Despite its international fame during the Middle Ages, our knowledge of the empire of Mâli remains patchy. Perhaps the most significant lacuna is that its capital has not yet been reliably identified. This paper offers a new hypothesis about the location of the imperial capital of Mâli in the 14th century. It is based on the observation that the rulers of Mâli, like those of other medieval African polities, strengthened their power by controlling the interface between opposite merchant networks. In doing so, they tended to establish their political legitimacy through the use of titles and displays of political and religious power befitting their different clients and subjects. Taking this economic, religious and political duality into consideration allows us to posit that the capital of Mâli lay outside the royal domain. Though it has not yet been probed by archaeology, the city’s hypothetical location proposed in this arricle corresponds to available Arabic descriptions.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nMâli: An overview\n\nThe king as two: Dual political structures and legitimacies\n\nThe capital of Mâli: Thinking with its duality to rethink its location\n\n42 LEVTZION, Nehemia; HOPKINS, J. F. P. (ed., transl.) – Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West Afric (...)\n\n“The city of BYTY is extensive in length and breadth. Its length would be about a barîd [20 km] and its width the same. It is not encircled by a wall and is mostly scattered. The king has several palaces enclosed by circular walls. A branch of the Nîl [=the river] encircles the city on all four sides. In places this may be crossed by wading when the water is low but in others it may be traversed only by boat” .\n\n55 LEVTZION, Nehemia ; HOPKINS, J. F. P. (ed., transl.) – Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West Afri (...)\n\n“They are uncouth infidels. If [he] wished he could extend his authority over them but the kings of this kingdom have learnt by experience that as soon as one of them conquers one of the gold towns and Islam spreads […] the gold there begins to decrease and then disappears […]. When they had learnt the truth of this by experience they left the gold countries under the control of the heathen people and were content with their vassalage and the tribute imposed on them” .\n\n15This sounds like an oblique admission that the best the kings of Mâli could hope for was to broker commercial ties between “Infidels” and Muslims. This should not be seen as a way of downsizing their sovereignty over an immense territory stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Niger bend in the east; on the contrary, such a tremendous effort was necessary to counter any temptation their northern and southern clients might have had to bypass them and “go private”, as well as to head off any moves by competing regional powers to usurp their role.\n\nThe imperial capital of Mâli: Downstream, not upstream, from Ségou\n\n18Fig. 5. Proposed location of Mâli City (after FAUVELLE, François- Xavier – Les Masques et la mosquée. Paris: CNRS Éditions, 2022, p. 278).\n\n19I must add that like all other hypotheses on offer, this one has a serious drawback: there are no known archaeological sites in the region between the Niger, the fala of Molodo and the fala of Boki Wéré. Yet, to my knowledge, no archaeological assessment has ever been carried out in the area, and the political situation as of this writing (the early 2020s) has prevented me from even visiting. Once an archaeological reconnaissance is finally undertaken, I suspect that it will uncover a sparse (over 20x20 km), diversified site made up of several components (an Islamic urban settlement with a mosque, a royal palace, other religious and funerary sites); banco structures, unfortunately largely eroded; and an urban mound likely to yield discriminant artefacts such as glazed ceramics, coins, beads, metal objects, and other imports and exports. It is possible that parts of the former multipolar city might have been destroyed by development that has taken place since the colonial period or have been looted. Finally, readers should be warned that both Malian law and international regulations strictly forbid anyone to carry out excavations without first receiving permission from the country’s authorities."
