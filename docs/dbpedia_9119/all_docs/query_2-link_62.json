        "text": "Caravan routes have passed through Mali since A.D. 300. The Malinke empire ruled regions of Mali from the 12th to the 16th century. The rulers of Mali came to be called Mansa; meaning emperor, or master. Mansa Musa (1307-1332) became the most accomplished and famous of all the emperors of Mali. He was the grandson of Sundiatas half brother. Musa ruled Mali at its peak, a time of great prosperity when trade tripled. During his rule he doubled the land area of Mali by uniting smaller city-states. At its height during the 14th century, Mali was a larger kingdom than all of Europe at the time and only smaller than the Asian kingdom of Genghis Khan at the time.\n\nAs Mali's power waned, Songhay, which had been an important trade center, asserted its independence and rose to power, making Gao its capital. Under the Songhay king Sunni Ali Ber, who came to power in 1464, Songhay became dominant and overtook Tombouctou and Djenne. Later, a leader named Askia Mohammed Toure extended the Songhay kingdom farther than Ghana or Mali had before and brought an organized system of government to the area. From the early 15th to the late 16th century, Songhai was one of the largest African empires in history. This empire bore the same name as its leading ethnic group, the Songhai. Its capital was the city of Gao, (on the Niger River, east of Tombouctou) where a small Songhai state had existed since the 11th century. Its base of power was on the bend of the Niger River in present-day Niger and Burkina Faso.\n\nMorocco conquered Tombouctou in 1591 and ruled over it for two centuries. Subjugated by France by the end of the 19th century, the land the territory took the name of Soudan Français in 1894. The name was changed into Sénégambie et Niger in 1902 and became a colony in 1904.In 1906 the name was changed into Haut-Sénégal et Niger but in 1920 the original name of Soudan Français was reintroduced. In 1946 became part of the French Union. In 1959 it was joined with the Republic of Senegal in the Mali Federation. On June 20, 1960, it became independent under the name of Sudanese Republic. However, Senegal seceded from the federation on Aug. 20, 1960, and the Sudanese Republic then changed its name to the Republic of Mali on Sept. 22.\n\nMuch of our knowledge about the Mali empire is based on oral history and the manuscripts of Ibn Batuta who traveled in the Western Sudan in the fifties of the 14th century but almost no visual documents exist about its mediaeval history. On the maps of Catalan navigators, the socalled portulans, the north of Western Africa appears in the beginning of the 14th century. The oldest picture of a Malinese king is on the map of Angelino Dulcert (1339). On this map a king is depicted, sitting on his throne, on his head a turban his right forefinger raised and in his left hand a sceptre. The legend Rex Melly identifies him as the king of Mali. This picture is copied in different ways on later portolans. On the map of Abraham Cresques, called the Atlas Catalan (1375, now in the national library of Paris), the king is definitely black and the turban is exchanged for a golden crown. Of course we should be very careful to accept that this picture actually depicts an African king because crown and regalia resemble too much the European regalia of the time. Nevertheless, the author seems to be quite sure that there was an important king in this region (which he calls Ginyia), and near a city called tombukh (Tombouctou), somewhat north of a lake in the Niger River (called Rio de Oro in contemporary literature).\n\nA copy of this map, made by Mecia de Viladestes in 1413, identifies the black king as REX MUSAMELI, in whom we may recognize the Malinese king Mansa Musa (1307-1332).\n\nThe King of Mali on the Atlas Catalan (1375)\n\nThe kanaga mask can be interpreted in various ways by the initiates, the dancers and the witnesses. For some, it represents the bird kommolo tebu, for others a crocodile, a cow, an antelope, or the blacksmith-sculptor himself. All depends on the interpretation of the dancer's attributes (headdress, purse, cane, costume ) and in the way in which the mask dances. The deeper meaning of the kanaga mask apparently pertains both to God, the crossbars being his arms and legs, and to the arrangement of the universe, with the upper crossbar representing the sky and the lower one the earth. Then inert and secular, the mask became the attribute of a dressed up dancer which gave it life and word. Because of this it is only through the movement, and through the dancer more particularly, that the mask finds its effectiveness.\n\nThis kind of mask is allotted to the male initiation society awa, closely related to ancestors' cult and dama ceremonies. For the Dogon, these ceremonies give access to the universal vital force and to the reincarnation of the departed. The symbolic system of interpretation by the initiate reveals the creator, indicated by the dancer's gesture in the sky and the ground 18th / 19th century.\n\nBy Ordonnances n°s 56 and 57 of 20th of October 1973 the seal and the arms of the republic were officially adopted. (see text below)\n\nThe colour of the background is described now as being light-blue, the vulture dark grey, the mosque light light grey, the bows-and-arrows black and the sun yellow.\n\nThe seal of state is also circular with a lion rampant in the middle, surrounded by a garland of sorghum and rice and a buffalo´s head in chief. And as a legend the same words as for the arms.\n\nThere is no picture of this seal available.\n\nThere may be some confusion about the meaning of the charges of the arms. In the decree of 1973 the bird is described as a legendary vulture but clearly a dove is depicted which would symbolize the peace between the arab and black communities living together in Mali. The rising sun symbolizes the longing for a free Africa. The Djenné Mosque is interpreted as a symbol of the many cities of Mali but also can be intrepreted as the symbol of Islam.\n\nThe colors of the first arms are the pan-african colors of which the green symbolizes nature, the yellow purity and national treasures and the red valiance and the blood spilled for independence.\n\nThe lion rampant on the seal refers to the leadership of a legendary king of Mali named Sundiata. Sogolon-Djata, or Sundiata - meaning The Hungering Lion- was born into the royal Keita clan of the Malinke people. The lion was the symbol of the Keita clan and Sundiata became known in legend as the Lion King. He is credited with uniting a weak and scattered people and ushering in a period of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe sorgum and rice symbolize the main crops of Mali and the buffalo´s head the cattle breeding.\n\nAssemblée Nationale\n\nAfter of the proclamation of independence, one of the first institutions of the Republic put in place, was the Assemblée Territoriale, this assembly seeing the light of day following the adoption of the Framework Law in 1956. Before,the country reached its national sovereignty, its representatives sat in the national assembly and the French Senate. Following the pluralist elections of 1957, the Assemblée Territoriale was made up of 35 deputies from the Union Soudanaise, section of the Rassemblement Democratique Africain (US-RDA), the party of Modibo Keïta, and 5 deputies from the Parti progressiste soudanais (PSP), of Fily Dabo Sissoko. In 1958, the Assemblée Territoriale was established as the Constituent Assembly of the Sudanese Republic which became the Assemblée Constituante de la République Soudanaise which bacame the Assemblée Législative de la République du Soudan It is this Assembly which, by Law No. 60-35 / ALRS, proclaimed the independence of the Sudanese Republic under the name of \"Republique du Mali\". After that, the Assemblée Législative de la République Soudanaise changed its name to become \"Assemblée Nationale du Mali \"."
