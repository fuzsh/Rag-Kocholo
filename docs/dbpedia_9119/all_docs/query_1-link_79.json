        "text": "Discuss the factors that account for the development of any two African kingdoms in the pre-colonial period.\n\nThere are several factors that were responsible for the rise and expansion of the medieval empires of ancient Ghana and Mali, the most important of which was trade. In order to maintain their boundaries – and even expand them – what became just as important as the trade and the affluence it provided was the methods of regional control, the administration systems that were in place in each empire, and the individuals who ruled these empires.\n\nThe empire of ancient Ghana was the oldest of the two empires, being in existence from possibly as early as the fourth century A.D. and diminishing by the thirteenth century A.D. Labelled as ancient Ghana to differentiate it from the geographically different modern Ghana, it was called Wagadu by its ancient rulers and became a nation of importance and influence by the eighth century. It was known as Ghana as that was the name taken by its ruler – ‘Ghana’ meaning warlord. The ruling people – the Mande speaking Soninke from the eighth century onward – extended the empire to a size of almost 100,000 square kilometres: from the Senegal River in the west to the Niger River in the east and south; to the north the empire was bordered by the Sahara desert.(Crowder, 1977, p. 29)\n\nGhana’s capital was Kumbi Saleh, but also in Ghana’s control was the southern Berber town of Audoghast, which was the southern terminus of the trans-Saharan trade route. This trade route was established before Christian times, but began to flourish as Muslim trans-Saharan trade expanded after 750 A.D. and involved the purchase of gold from the Ghanaians in return for salt from North Africa and beyond. The purchase of gold was fed throughout Europe, and “Ghana, ‘the land of gold’, is referred to by all Arab geographers who had anything to say about the Sudan.” (Ade Ajayi & Crowder, 1985, p. 135) It is from these Arab geographers – such as al-Bakri and al-Fazari – and archaeology that any knowledge of the Ghanaian Empire is known. Al-Bakri, the Andalusian chronicler writing in the eleventh century in Cordoba, gained most of his information of Ghana from first-hand accounts of those that traded or travelled across the Sahara.\n\nThe Ghanaian Empire profited from the trans-Saharan trade routes because of its location – it was importing gold from the Wangara area to the south for trade with North Africa, and salt from the north was bought for exporting south. Gold was hugely important to North Africa and traded beyond those shores for coinage; just as important was salt for those in the south where it was a rare commodity. In a silent trade the Ghanaian merchants traded the salt for the gold which had been mined by the Mandingo natives. (Fage, 1962, p. 21) Ghanaian merchants made a profit on both ventures, but trade was just as financially advantageous to the Ghanaian kings who taxed the import and export of goods through their lands:\n\n“He took through his agents a certain weight of gold or its equivalent value as import duty on ‘every donkey-load of salt that enters the country’, and twice as much again on ‘every donkey-load of salt that goes out.’”(Davidson, 2005, p. 91)\n\nAs well as an import-export tax, the Ghanaian rulers exerted a production tax on gold. This was similar to a modern-day diamond production system and restricted the availability of gold on the open market. The effort to maintain the value of gold was such that citizens were only allowed to keep gold dust as the nuggets belonged to the king.(Ade Ajayi & Crowder, 1985, p. 135)\n\nTrade between North Africa and the sub-Saharan Sudan regions was not restricted to just salt and gold; West Africans bought other items such as cloth, copper, pottery which symbolised their increase in affluence. The trans-Saharan trade also involved slaves transported from the Sudan to the Muslim countries in North Africa. As Muslims could not be enslaved by other Muslims, and West Africa was not yet totally Islamic in faith, the North African countries turned to the Ghanaians for a source of religiously allowable slaves. Citizens of Ghana could start specialised trades with the import of rarefied commodities: builders, smiths, craftsmen became prevalent thanks to the growth of new internal markets. With smiths came iron and steelwork and the development of weapons. This along with the taxes imposed on trade and production allowed the kings to maintain well-equipped, large armies to protect trade routes, crush dissenter rebellions, protect state boundaries and conquer weaker neighbours.(Crowder, 1977, p. 28)\n\nThe wealth of Ghana attracted North African Muslims, and despite the kings retaining their native religion, Ghana had a liberal attitude to Muslims. With Muslim explorers and scholars came literacy, and with literacy came the administration system that made Ghana so efficient at collecting taxes. Islam also helped trade because it put a universally recognised social and cultural setting that put foreign merchants at ease, and promoted the virtues of honesty and frugality that was essential to business. With Islamic scholars came Islamic craftsmen, and there is archaeological evidence of stone buildings of the era at Kumbi Saleh.(Ade Ajayi & Crowder, 1985, p. 666)\n\nThe task of keeping good relations with the North African traders didn’t just fall to the administrative system employed by the Ghanaian kings, it fell to the kings themselves. Part of their duties as sovereign or ‘kaya maghan’ – ‘lord of gold’ – was to organize trade within the kingdom and ensure the trade routes were kept open and profitable. As well as this they were the senior religious leader of the country despite not converting to Islam. It was the development of trade through more complex trade routes in Sudan that contributed to their decline. Despite this the Soninke kings ruled with good order for more than two centuries and enjoyed a steady government, the strength of which came from the king who held a “middleman position which made Ghana strong and prosperous. It was this that gave its rulers gold and glory.”(Davidson, 1998, p. 29)\n\nMali, then called Kangaba, was one of the many nations that managed to gain independence from Ghana after the Almoravid invasion of 1076/7 A.D. It was this invasion that weakened the Ghanaian empire to its dissolution. Mali became the major power in Africa in the fourteenth century but its first appearance is after the battle of Kirina in 1240 A.D. when the Kangaba led by Sundiata, one of the most renown of Mali’s rulers, beat Sumanguru, king of a rival empire building tribe from Takrur. Sundiata then spent the next twenty years building the empire of Mali from the state of Kangaba.(Davidson, 2005, pp. 98-99)\n\nMali repeated the achievement of Ghana but on a much larger scale – both geographically and in terms of success. There are many similarities between the development between the two empires but also subtle differences. In Mali there were three different periods of success – under Sundiata 1235-60 with the founding of the empire; under the freed ‘slave of the court’ turned emperor Mansa Sakura 1298-1308; and under Mansa Kankan Musa 1312-27 when the empire was extended. Once again historians are reliant on Islamic scholars for information on Mali, the most detailed and important being Ibn Khaldun who wrote at the end of the fourteenth century.(Davidson, 1998, p. 41)\n\nBy beating Sumanguru at the battle of Kirina, Sundiata had allowed the north to be opened up for expansion. Over the next hundred years the Mali emperors extended their borders east along the Niger River conquering Jenne and Timbuktu, west to the Gambia, and created one of the largest empires in the contemporary world that had a developed, complex network of trade routes that linked the Sahara desert, the savannah and the forest, incorporating a huge area full of natural resources. Mali dominated “the entire northern reaches of the Middle Niger so as to maintain effective control over any settlements that may serve as entrepots for the gold trade.”(Ade Ajayi & Crowder, 1985, p. 325)\n\nJust like Ghana, Mali was near the gold mines of Bure and Bambuku; but unlike Ghana it was also in control of kola forests, the Akan forests and the copper and salt enriched areas to the east of Taghaza. This hugely profitable system of trade allowed the emperors, or Mansa, to have a sizable disposable wealth. This led to large numbers of domestic serfs, and the trade allowed them to purchase horses and have the substantial military advantage of a numerous, effective cavalry that could subjugate its lesser neighbours. This vast, multi-ethnical empire was held together by a system of indirect rule much similar to Ghana’s, but unlike Ghana this was an empire united by Islam. Unlike the Ghanaian emperors, the Mali Mansa’s were Muslims who undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca.(Hallett, 1978, pp. 147-9)\n\nIn 1298 the throne was seized by slave-born Sakuru. The strength of the Mali nation was such that it didn’t dissipate but actually expanded under his leadership. Ibn Khaldun says “under his powerful government the possessions of the people of Mali were expanded, and they overpowered the neighbouring nations.”(Davidson, 2005, p. 100)\n\nSakuru despite his success only ruled for nine years; however, he established a power-base that his successor, Mansa Kankan Musa, would use to extend further and become the most renown of all emperors of Mali. On his succession the trade was already under his control, with the wealth and power that came with it he brought the area of Middle Niger under his rule and enclosed Timbuktu and Gao. Under the Mali rule Timbuktu became a major cultural centre of the world, famed for its library and writings, its Islamic universities where poets and scholars from the Islamic world centred themselves. Mansa Kankan Musa brought a large part of the western Sudan under his rule, making trade a safe operation, but he was known for more than just trade – with the help of Arabian architects he introduced brick building and built mosques in Timbuktu and other major cities and saw himself as a patron of Muslim arts and scholarship. This had a domino effect on government efficiency due to the rise in literacy levels. This efficient administration service allowed the Mansa, just like his Ghanaian counterpart, the ability to introduce one system of law and order that had local variations. This part of ancient Mali’s history “was afterwards remembered as a golden age of prosperity and peace.”(Davidson, 2005, pp. 100-1)\n\nDespite his enthusiasm for his Islamic faith, and mirroring the policy of the Ottoman Empire, different religions were tolerated as the pan-ethnic empire was not solely Islamic. This was, as John Iliffe says, “Because Islam was not only a religion but a social order, Africans necessarily adopted it only gradually.”(Ilffe, 2009, p. 53)\n\nAccording to Basil Davidson its success was also a reason for Mali’s failure – it had showed the peoples of West Africa what could be done with a growing kingship, central government, coupled with metal-working and trade, and because its rulers were not strong or skilful enough after Mansa Suleyman, and fell into decline after Gao rebelled in 1400. By 1431 Tuareg nomads had seized Walata and Timbuktu and Takrur had also rebelled, the time of the Mansa was over.(Davidson, 1998, p. 44)\n\nGhana and Mali were the first of the West African empires, and they should be considered as empires because as Michael Crowder says “other nations paid tribute to them.”(Crowder, 1977, p. 26) They were distinct from other previous empires because they were built on foundations of government not solely based on the military but also on trade, re-enforcing its ideology with an efficient administrative system, and because of their stability and longevity that only ended because they had shown the rest of West Africa the way forward.\n\nBibliography:\n\nAde Ajayi, J., & Crowder, M.
