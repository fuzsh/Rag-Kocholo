        "text": "The contemporary written sources, such as the accounts of Al-Umari and Ibn Khaldun, do state that Mali had a capital, and they even give brief descriptions of it. In J.F.P. Hopkins' translation of al-Umari's account of Mali, the name of the capital is given as \"BYTY\", while in Hopkins' translation of Ibn Khaldun's account of Mali and its history the capital is given as \"BNY\", in both cases providing the consonants of the name. These words (\"BYTY\" and \"BNY\") given for the capital by those authors are probably a big part of why Niani was thought to be the most likely candidate.\n\nI think these more recent articles are really just reflecting on how archaeologists have failed to locate the capital's archaeological remains in the expected location. François-Xavier Fauvelle's article cited in the opening post states that:\n\n\"The identification of Niani-on-Sankarani (which we will call it to distinguish it from other similar names) rested firstly on the conjunction of two onomastic connections: on one hand between the toponym Niani and the name Yani' indicated in a 17th century chronicle of Timbuktu – an rather distant source both in time and space – and on the other between the name of the Sankarani and that of the watercourse (Sansara) which, according to his own account, Ibn Battuta crossed in order to reach the capital. It was also discovered a little later that the name of this village is not completely incompatible with that of the capital indicated by the Arabian authors of the 14th century, to the point that the name of Niani was sometimes substituted, through a kind of philological coup, for the original term in the various editions of these texts (for example Cuoq, 1985: 262, 264). This is to forget the fact that, while the restitution \"Nanî\" is possible, the script of the Arabic manuscripts in question, unvocalised and without diacritical marks, may also be transliterated in the forms \"Binî\", \"Butî\", \"Tatî\", and \"Yity\", among a host of other possibilities (Collet, in press). While toponymic games are never risk-free, their relevance here is still more diminished by the fact that, in the absence of any accurate geographical location for the kingdom, the area in which we must search the capital is enormous: nothing less than the whole area of the Mandinka language. We might as well seek out a \"Villefranche\" on the map of France! But here, Niani‑on-Sankarani has the advantage of being located in the heart of what is called \"Vieux Mandingue\", the central region of the Mandinka area in which a chiefdom is settled which, on the basis of oral traditions, proclaims itself the heir of the ancient kingdom. In short, it is at the crossroads between complacently‑-sought philological sources and regional political claims that the Niani hypothesis – and soon the \"Niani solution\" – has taken shape.\"\n\nBut there isn't any convincing alternative to Niani given in Fauvelle's article. Perhaps it is the case that the name \"Niani\" that is applied to a certain location nowadays, could, in earlier times, have been used to refer to a slightly different location, which is where the actual archaeological remains of the capital might be found if they are ever found. In other words, the name Niani could have persisted through the centuries and shifted to somewhere slightly different from where the actual original geographical location of the capital was.\n\nAs for Sorotomo, it is of course possible that during an earlier period or a later period than when Mali was at its apogee, it had some other capital than the one referred to in the contemporary written sources. It is also possible that Sorotomo was not the capital of the Mali empire but just the capital of some important province or constituent kingdom within the Mali empire.\n\nPerhaps it is the case that the name \"Niani\" that is applied to a certain location nowadays, could, in earlier times, have been used to refer to a slightly different location, which is where the actual archaeological remains of the capital might be found if they are ever found.\n\nInteresting to see this reason because I've bumped into it in North America. I researched locations of indigenous North American settlements within a narrow timeframe (1600-1800) and defined region (Great Lakes) and found the written record, oral history, and archeological findings all over the map. One oral record put a village on the opposite side of a peninsula when compared to both a European map and written account. Another site is an archeological dig that focuses on ancient inhabitants and ignores the written evidence of a more recent village. I also found 2 parks named in honor of indigenous people but the parks' properties are not on any record of indigenous settlements. Basically I came away from the research realizing that the accounts don't always agree and pinning an exact coordinate for a historical inhabitation is muddy work. So I could image this happens elsewhere when researching \"lost\" cities like the capital of Mali.\n\nWith this doubt in mind, I am curious to know which sites have been assumed to have been the capital of Mali Empire?\n\nHas LIDAR been used on suspected Mali sites?\n\nArchaeologists used LIDAR to find or redefine ancient sites in Mesoamerica with great results."
