        "text": "Africa in my kitchen\n\nListen to the podcast: Link\n\nReposted from @234Pantry on Instagram\n\nMalian proverb: The hyena chasing two antelopes at the same time will go to bed hungry.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a few weeks, but we are back, and in Mali to try out Fakoye.\n\nThe Republic of Mali was part of the Mali Empire that existed between the 13th and the 17th centuries. Present-day Mali actually gets its name from the ancient empire. Mali is a landlocked country; it shares its borders with Algeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, Guinea, Senegal, and Mauritania. Its population is about 19 million and the capital and largest city is Bamako. Most inhabitants live in the southern savanna part of the country; a big chunk of the north extends into the Sahara Desert.\n\nForensic evidence indicates that people existed in Mali before 5000 BC. In 1235 AD, the Mali Empire was formed, consisting of present-day Senegal, Mali, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, and parts of Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Ghana. The Mali empire was very prosperous; Mansa Musa ‚Äì one of the emperors of the empire ‚Äì remains one of the richest men of all time. Djenne and Timbuktu were major cities in the empire known for trade and learning. The empire declined in the 17th century.\n\nIn the late 1800s when almost all African countries became European colonies, France took control over present-day Mali and named it part of French Sudan. After independence in 1960, the name was changed to the Republic of Mali.\n\nIf you‚Äôre ever in Mali, there are a variety of things you may be lucky to try. There‚Äôs Tiguadege Na, which is lamb or chicken cooked in peanut sauce. Alabadja is white rice and ground meat cooked in butter sauce. Poulet Yassa is a marinated chicken dish made with onions, mustard, and lemon, typically served over rice. Yassa originated in Senegal, but is very much part of Mali‚Äôs cuisine.\n\nOur pick from Mali is Fakoye, a dark sauce from the northern part of the country. It‚Äôs a slightly thick, earthy sauce. The major ingredient is the fakoye leaf, also called mloukhiya, molokhia, corete, ayoyo or ewedu. In English, it is called jute leaf. It is a green vegetable and is high in vitamins A, C, B6, potassium, manganese, zinc, and iron.\n\nTo make fakoye, the leaves are dried and ground into powder.\n\nA key ingredient for making this dish is the fakoye spice blend. Dear people, finding this spice is harrrrrrrddd where I live. I asked a few bloggers what I could use as a substitute and the one response I got back was that they couldn‚Äôt think of a suitable substitute. I couldn‚Äôt find what the blend is made of, but I scoured a few sites and came up with a few things. I won‚Äôt lie, I have no idea if the mix and proportions of spices I used was accurate, but it tasted pretty good.\n\nYou should probably make fakoye if you can find the right spice blend for it. If you can‚Äôt but you‚Äôd love to make it anyway, here‚Äôs what I did. If you know about the spice blend and I totally massacred it here, I am sorry ‚òπ.\n\nFor the spice blend, a mixed a teaspoon each of Aniseed, cumin, cinnamon, black pepper, onion powder, and ground cloves. You also need soumbala powder, also known as ground dawadawa or locust beans. I had it in pellet form, so I used that instead. Traditionally, fakoye is made with edible shea butter, but I saw recipes where it was replaced with oil or butter. I used ghee.\n\nOur version of Fakoye is loosely based on this recipe by Riiaamcook. Here‚Äôs what you need to make it.\n\nFakoye powder (ground jute leaf)\n\nLamb, chopped into cubes\n\nFakoye spices\n\nShea butter or oil\n\nFresh tomatoes\n\nDates or tamarind\n\nOnions (optional)\n\nGarlic (optional)\n\nSoumbala / dawadawa\n\nSalt and pepper as needed\n\nWe‚Äôve seen Fakoye typically eaten with rice, but Yemi loved the similarity to her beloved Ewedu so much that she actually had this with fufu and stew. (I won‚Äôt even judge.)\n\nIf you listen to our podcast, you‚Äôll know there was a bit of drama a that came with making this, but eating Fakoye is a good time, so we‚Äôve given it a thumbs-up. Happy noshing! üòä\n\nSOURCES\n\nhttps://www.inspirationalstories.com/proverbs/t/malian/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/300867954170268/posts/602639220659805/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malian_cuisine\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corchorus_olitorius\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/272541040_Nutritional_composition_of_Corchorus_olitorius_leaves#:~:text=Jute%20leaves%20are%20important%20sources,and%20E)%20%5B92%5D%20.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corchorus_olitorius\n\nWritten by @234Pantry\n\nBefore you leave, don‚Äôt forget to subscribe for notifications."
