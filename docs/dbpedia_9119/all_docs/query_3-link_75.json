        "text": "African History\n\nAn ancient land of greatness, once perhaps the richest land on earth. It is shaped a bit like a butterfly, leaning to the northwest with a much smaller left than right wing.\n\nIn the far past, Mali, as well as the entire North Africa stretching from the Mediterranean coast far down below in the deep African inland, were interconnected through vast waterways. These waterways consisted of rivers, lakes, springs, and other water systems which made the continent lush and verdant, filled with dense forests, richly green valleys, and wild jungles. Something incomprehensible to us today. Mali even had its own huge lake and it was a fertile and fecund country.\n\nAs temperatures rose and the climate changed so did the lush landscape, leaving most of Mali in extreme drought and much of its fertile lands converted to a desert. Nevertheless, there is something hidden deep in its sand, a reminder of a distant past, remaining deep within.\n\nFor to be able to recognise it you have to be willing to see far beyond. Far beyond today’s extremely superficial world, only then can you discover the “Great Mali”, the Mali within.\n\nThe Lion King"
