        "text": "Developments in Africa\n\n### Tribe vs. Clan-Based\n\nMuch like the Americas before 1450, Africa was largely tribal or clan-based.\n\nrefers to the many different indigenous cultures and communities that exist across the African continent. These communities have a wide variety of cultural practices, beliefs, and languages, and many of them have a long history that predates the arrival of Europeans on the continent. Many tribal African communities have a strong connection to their traditional ways of life and often base their cultural practices and beliefs on their traditional spiritual and religious practices. Some examples of tribal African cultures include the Maasai in Kenya and Tanzania, the Himba in Namibia, the San in Botswana, and the Baka in Cameroon.\n\nMany African cultures are based on a clan or tribe structure, where people are organized into groups based on their family or kinship ties. These clans or tribes often have a shared history, language, and cultural practices, and they may have a traditional system of governance and social organization. In many African cultures, the clan or tribe is an important part of an individual's identity, and people often have a strong sense of loyalty and commitment to their clan or tribe. In some African cultures, the clan or tribe may be involved in decision-making processes and may play a role in resolving conflicts within the community.\n\nKey Definitions\n\nIslam\n\nis a monotheistic religion founded in the 7th century by the prophet Muhammad. It is based on the belief in one God (Allah) and the teachings of Muhammad as recorded in the Qur'an. Muslims follow the Five Pillars of Islam, which are the core religious obligations that must be followed in order to live a good and faithful life. These pillars are:\n\nShahada: the declaration of faith that there is only one God and Muhammad is his prophet.\n\nSalat: the ritual prayer performed five times a day.\n\nZakat: the annual payment of a percentage of one's wealth to charity.\n\nSawm: fasting during the month of Ramadan.\n\nHajj: the pilgrimage to Mecca that must be made at least once in a lifetime. Islam is the second largest religion in the world, with over 1.8 billion followers. It is the dominant religion in the Middle East and North Africa, and has a significant presence in many other parts of the world.\n\nTrans-Saharan Trade Network\n\nThe was a trade route that connected the Mediterranean region with sub-Saharan Africa. The trade network spanned the Sahara Desert and facilitated the exchange of a wide variety of goods, including salt, gold, ivory, and slaves. The trade network was established in ancient times and played a significant role in the economies of both Africa and the Mediterranean region. The trans-Saharan trade network was a key factor in the spread of Islam in Africa and the development of African kingdoms and empires. The trade network declined in importance in the 19th century with the arrival of European colonizers in Africa and the development of alternative trade routes.\n\nIndian Ocean Trade Network\n\nThe was a network of trade routes that connected the East African coast with the Western Indian Ocean, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. The trade network was centered around the Indian Ocean and was an important part of the global trade system during the pre-modern period. The Indian Ocean trade network facilitated the exchange of a wide variety of goods, including spices, textiles, gold, and other luxury items. The trade network also played a role in the spread of religions, such as Islam, and in the exchange of ideas and cultural practices. The Indian Ocean trade network was an important factor in the economic and cultural development of the regions it connected.\n\nAround 1,000 CE and later, many empires did emerge. These kingdoms brought unity, continuity, and complexity to the regions they controlled.\n\nPost-Classical Africa\n\nrefers to the period of African history that followed the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. During this period, Africa experienced significant changes in its political, economic, and cultural systems. The post-classical period saw the rise and fall of several African empires, such as the Kingdom of , the , and the . The post-classical period was also marked by the spread of Islam throughout Africa and the development of a number of important trade networks, such as the trans-Saharan trade network and the Indian Ocean trade network. The post-classical period in Africa ended with the arrival of Europeans on the continent and the start of the colonial period.\n\nThese African societies have many shared characteristics. Family and communal activities were the centerpieces of the clan or village. Music and dancing were a common way of both entertainment but also veneration of the dead. Most Sub-Saharan societies did not have a written language rather passed on their history, literature, and culture through . were storytellers who would make kings famous for generations."
