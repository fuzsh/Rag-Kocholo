        "text": "The Kingdom of Mali flourished in West Africa from about 1200 - 1500 and grew to become one of the richest empires in Africa.\n\nMali began as a small state called Kangaba and was established by the Mandinka people. The Mandinka were farmers and middle-men in the gold trade and had been conquered by the Kingdom of Ghana.\n\nSundiata Keita was born to a noble Mandinka family in the early 1200s. Legends told by oral tradition say his brothers were killed by Ghana's rulers but he was spared because he was crippled.\n\nKeita later led a revolt against the Empire of Ghana. He united several groups and was victorious at the Battle of Kirina in 1235.\n\nKeita then founded the Mali Empire and took the title of Mansa (king or emperor in the Mandinka language).\n\nSundiata Keita commanded a mighty army and expanded the empire by defeating neighboring kingdoms. Eventually he divided the empire into provinces that were ruled by governors.\n\nA series of rulers came after Keita, but it was the 9th mansa who brought Mali into its golden age.\n\nMansa Musa took power around 1312. He was one of the first truly devout Muslims to lead the Mali Empire. He attempted to make Islam the faith of the nobility, but kept the tradition of not forcing it on his people.\n\nMusa went on pilgrimage or hajj to Mecca in 1324. He traveled with an enormous entourage and a vast supply of gold. He made a point of showing off his nation's wealth.\n\nThe lavish display of riches and generosity drew the attention of the whole Islamic world and Europe.\n\nThis was especially true in Cairo, where they camped by the Pyramids of Giza in July 1324. Musa gave so much gold to the poor and others that it supposedly impacted Egypt's entire economy.\n\nIt is estimated that Mansa Musa was the wealthiest person in history.\n\nBack in Mali, the salt plains in the north and the gold mines in the south continued to bring more wealth. Timbuktu became a center of learning and many important scholars visited the country, like Ibn Battuta, the greatest of all Arab travelers and writers.\n\nThe people of Mali were also skilled farmers. The natural environment was ideal for planting cotton, peanuts, grains and other crops, which fed the people.\n\nWealth also came from the slave trade. Mali captured and enslaved people from neighboring groups. However, Mali's constitution, the Kouroukan Fouga prohibited the maltreatment of prisoners and the enslaved.\n\nWhen Ibn Buttata visited Mali in the 14th century, shortly after Mansa Musa's death, he was surprised and impressed by how strictly order was enforced in the kingdom.\n\nSoon after, however, Musa's grandsons fought over his throne. Far-off provinces of the empire broke away while enemies attacked it in its weakened state.\n\nIn 1534, the ruler Mansa Suleyman asked Portuguese colonizers at the coast for help, but they refused. Mali shrank to the original size of Kangaba by 1645.\n\nThe Empire finally collapsed with the rise of the Kingdom of Songhai, but no empire was able to maintain the power and wealth held by the Kingdom of Mali."
