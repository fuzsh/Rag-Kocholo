        "text": "Here are some parts that I have marked in my copy of the book “Forecast: What Physics, Meterology and the Natural Sciences Can Teach us about Economics” by Mark Buchaman.\n\nWill Hutton\n\n1. “Economics is a discipline for quiet times. The profession, it turns out,…. has no grip on understanding how the abnormal grows out of the normal and what happens next, its practitioners like weather forecasters who don’t understand storms.”\n\n-Will Hutton\n\n2. “I think physicists are the Peter Pans of the human race. They never grow up and they keep their curiosity.”\n\n-Isidor Rabi, physicist\n\n3. “As humans, we’re terrible at imagining the likely consequences of positive feedback.”\n\n4. “Beliefs in equilibrium confers a sense of safety and predictability, and reflects a firm belief in the triumph of human logic over nature.”\n\n5. “The history of economics is largely a history of surprises that have emerged out of positive feedbacks.”\n\n6. “Say the word “physics” and most people think of Albert Einstein and the theory of relativity, the famous Higgs boson, or maybe the Hubble Space Telescope taking pictures of strange galaxies across the immense distances of the universe (that’d be astrophysics). Physics explores the very edge of what is known, or what is even possible. It’s Stephen Hawking talking about black holes and warped space-time, or string theorists asserting that pure mathematics suggests our universe has at least eleven dimensions, although most are hidden to us. Indeed, all of this is a part of physics.\n\nBut here’s a little secret: physics is changing, profoundly and rapidly, and most physicists today aren’t working on any of these things. Look in the journals of physics over the past two decades and you’ll find research on the patterns of email use, on the evolution of language, and the way fashions sweep across human populations. You’ll find others on genetic signaling networks, the growth patterns of business firms, the structure of the Internet, and the dynamics of the human heart – or the statistics of financial markets. Physics doesn’t look like it used to.\n\nWhat’s happened is that physicists have been hit by a revelation.”\n\n7. “At the deepest level, physics isn’t at all just about things that are physical. Rather, it turns out to be a science attuned to answering fundamental questions about order, organization, and change, about forms and their natural patterns of transformation – whether the order and form exists in a collection of molecules, galaxies, genes, bacteria, people, or investors interacting in a market. More than any other science, physics is well placed to understand how lots of pieces or parts or components, in interaction, give rise to often-surprising collective patterns or behaviors in an overall system. The pieces, parts, or components don’t have to be electrons or atoms; they might be almost anything.”\n\n8. “Economists are “like weather forecasters who do not understand storms”.”\n\n9. “Market economies are self-propelling and self-referential systems strongly driven by perceptions and expectations, and these systems routinely develop explosive amplifying feedbacks.”\n\n10. “One of the key concepts of disequilibrium thinking is the notion of “metastability”, which explains how a system can seem stable, yet actually be highly unstable, much like the sulfurous coating on a match, ready to explode if it receives the right kind of spark. Inherently unstable and dangerous situations can persist untroubled for very long periods, yet also guarantee eventual disaster.”\n\n11. “The feedbacks that leads to instability and dramatic change.”\n\n12. “Metaphors affect our worldview more than we generally think, and false metaphors can be especially dangerous.”\n\n13. “The notion of a state of balance or equilibrium dates to prehistory and the cosmological assumptions of the earliest religions. The equilibrium of the body has been at the center of medical thinking since the time of the Greek physician Hippocrates, and the Greek physicist and inventor Archimedes used the idea of an equilibrium balance to understand the action of levers and other simple machines. But the idea of equilibrium became more than metaphor after Isaac Newton’s publication in 1678 of Principia Mathematica, or The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, in which he described his theory of gravitation and laws of motion for the planets, as well as for ordinary objects and machines. In Newton’s theory, unbalanced forces acting on any object – a rock, a bird, or a planet – will cause it to accelerate, and this acceleration will continue until the force stops acting, or until other forces come into play to balance against it.\n\nThe result, when forces balance, is equilibrium – a rock resting stably on the ground, or the many pieces of a great bridge locked in a stable and self-supporting structure.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing wrong with this idea of equilibrium; it is a concept of the first order of genius, and explains many things. Think of the atmosphere as a pile of air just resting in equilibrium and you get reasonable numbers for the pressure at the earth’s surface, and how it falls off with increasing height – by a factor of about ten every thirteen miles or so. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, as Newtonian physics came to dominate all science and engineering, sparking the Industrial Revolution, it took on exceptionally elegant mathematical form in the works of Joseph Lagrange and William Rowan Hamilton, among others. Lagrange, in particular, showed that the laws of mathematical physics then known implied a principle of “least action” – that the motions of things in the universe, no matter how complex they appear, always act to minimize a certain quantity. It’s as if the universe itself has a principle of maximum efficiency.\n\nThe French mathematician Antoine Augustin Cournot, like many others at the time, felt sure that a similar mathematical science of society could not be far behind, and applied the idea of equilibrium balance to analyzing supply and demand, pointing out, in particular, the high prices one should naturally expect in the presence of a monopoly. Aside from Cournot, economics was then still dominated by verbal arguments, without any mathematics, but Cournot’s efforts inspired others, especially Leon Walras – the son of a French economist who had some early training in engineering – to change that. In 1874, in a book called Elements of Pure Economics, Walras showed how the notion of mechanical equilibrium could be used as a conceptual template to build an analogous theory of economics, and to give a precise mathematical expression to Smith’s invisible hand.”\n\n14. “Walras tried to show mathematically that the same kind of balance of supply and demand might naturally come to hold in the more complicated case with a vast range of distinct markets in different goods. He thought he had achieved it, writing to a colleague, mathematician Paul Matthieu Hermann Laurent, that “all these results are marvels of the simple application of the language of mathematics to the quantitative notion of need or utility”… You can be sure that the economic laws that result from it are just as rational, just as precise and just as incontrovertible as were the laws of astronomy at the end of the 17th century.”\n\n15. “Stable equilibria are generally more important than unstable.”\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\n\n16. “It often happens that the universal belief of one age of mankind – a belief from which no one was, nor without an extraordinary effort of genius or courage, could at that time be free – becomes to a subsequent age so palpable an absurdity that the only difficulty then is to imagine how such a thing can ever have appeared credible… It looks like one of the crude fantasies of childhood, instantly corrected by a word from any grown person.”\n\n-John Stuart Mill\n\n17. “In his landmark 1830 book Principles of Geology, the French geologist Charles Lyell argued that scientists would never manage to understand geological phenomena – rock formations, the shapes or mountains and valleys, and so on – if they sought to find in these things the traces of some timeless mathematical order. No one was likely to write down some beautiful equations, do the mathematical work, and wind up explaining the shape of the Swiss Alps. The shape of every planetary orbit is an elhpse. Hang a rope between two trees and its shape is always the same, a curve known as a catenary. Geology, Lyell claimed, is different, as accidents – volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods – leave indelible traces on the future. Landscapes emerge from strings of such accidents, from gradual, evolutionary processes acting over long periods of time. The Oxford historian Edward Hallett Carr later suggested that Charles Darwin, building on Lyell’s thinking, introduced the notion of history into a natural science. As he put it, “The real importance of the Darwinian revolution was that Darwin, completing what Lyell had already done in geology, brought history into science. Science was concerned no longer with something static and timeless, but with a process of change and development.”\n\n18. “The classical view of the healthy human organism sees it as achieving an ideal balance or homeostasis in a world of fluctuating demands. With exercise, the heart rate rises to pump more blood and supply more oxygen to the muscles. Hormone levels adjust throughout the hours of the daily cycle. In the absence of any outside changes or demands, the body should rest in calm repose, the heart beating regularly and steadily like a clock. This metaphor for balance and equilibrium has often inspired economists who view a market or economy in similar terms.”\n\n19. “But here’s a surprise: not only does this pattern fail to describe markets, but it also doesn’t even describe the human body. Take a perfectly healthy person at rest and measure the time between his or her heartbeats. It is anything but constant. In a string of studies stretching over twenty years, Ary Goldberger of the Harvard Medical School has shown that the healthy heart has quite vibrant natural fluctuations in the time between beats. These fluctuations also show a long-term memory with subtle links between past and future fluctuations over many hours. These fluctuations aren’t random, but instead reflect an inherent organization in the resting heart: rest isn’t simple rest, but something far richer. Indeed, Goldberger and colleagues have shown the heart actually becomes more clocklike and predictable, and shows less variability in the aged and in patients with heart diseases. The normal healthy resting heart just isn’t quiet and regular; irregularity and long memory are signs of natural health.”"
