        "text": "In order to meet a growing demand, the Institut Coppet designed and implemented a new review entitled “Laissons Faire”. Thanks to Benoît Malbranque, our editor in charge. Our goal for this journal is to offer a relevant publication to challenge the economic misconceptions of our time, and increase awareness about the French Classical Liberal School. This is a new way for us to spread the message of liberty and highlight the lack of liberty-minded politicians in France. At this point, “Laissons Faire” is published monthly for free on our website. A paper version is available for 6 euros on amazon.fr.\n\nIn all periods of history, France has provided the economic science with numerous thinkers having quite unusual intellectual fervor; individuals who have rendered distinguished service in their field. This very fact, which went unnoticed in our own country, was nonetheless reported by foreign economists. A theorist as famous as William Stanley Jevons, for instance, had no problem writing that “The truth is with the French school, and the sooner we recognize the fact, the better it will be for all the world” 2 This sentence is all the more remarkable in a time of growing nationalism, in which Jevons’ England was still considered the Queen of the economists, and was shining in their eyes like the Pole Star.\n\nThe great French tradition emerged with the Scholastics writings of the Middle Ages. The forgotten names of philosophers such as Pierre Abélard remain among the brightest intellectual inspirations, who lead economic reflection toward rigorous scientificity. More significantly, at least in the view of this article, is the case of the first theorists of money: Jean Buridan, woefully overlooked, and Nicolas Oresme, author of a book rich in teachings, as will be discussed in a later article.\n\nThe great effort toward scientificity consisted in the transformation of the part of moral philosophy or political philosophy which once was economics, into an autonomous and rigorous discipline. It nowhere received a greater intellectual impetus than in our country. It is indeed in France that appeared the first treatise “strictly about economic matters” (Oresme’s De Moneta, according to Joseph Schumpeter 3), and the first Treatise on Political Economy in history, in 1615, written by a certain Antoine de Montchrestien.\n\nThe subsequent centuries only confirmed this superiority. A giant leap forward was made in 1695 with the publication of the Détail de la France, by Pierre de Boisguilbert, who was defined as “the origin of free-market economics” 4, and of the Dîme Royale, skillful proposal of tax reform by Vauban (1707).\n\nNonetheless, only few people were willing to accept such revolutionary ideas. The Royal power was not prepared either: the Dîme royale was prohibited by censorship, and Boisguilbert could only promote his ideas by hiding himself, and by publishing anonymously. The substantive work of the Enlightenment philosophers, Voltaire, Diderot, Montesquieu, and many more, helped shaped public opinion, and offered a help of tremendous importance. Only then could the French economists of the eighteenth century, the prescientific elite of our science, plant the intellectual seeds which gave, few decades later, in France and in Scotland, so bountiful harvests.\n\nIt was with the Physiocrats that begun, strictly speaking, the era of scientific economics. They did not appear without having been announced, and if they have seen farther than others, it is only because, as we say eloquently, they were standing on the shoulder of giants. Their predecessors had indeed guided them skillfully and successfully, and it was the works of Jean-François Melon (Essai politique sur le commerce, 1734), of Nicolas Dutot (Réflexions politiques sur les finances et le commerce, 1735), and the thoughts of the marquis d’Argenson (Considérations sur le gouvernement de la France, written in 1734), which rendered possible the later revolution of Quesnay, the Physiocrats, and Turgot.\n\nProfessional and academic economists did not even exist, either in France or in Italy; even in England, the major contributions came from philosophers, such as William Petty or David Hume. François Quesnay was no more an economist. After a certified surgeon’s experience, he was appointed royal physician, and only then started to study political economy. But then, with ease and skill, he systematized a far-reaching economic knowledge, and, after having conceived the optimal analysis tools for the economist’s tasks, he used his bright intuitions to shed light on his century. He was followed by a horde of disciples, and even by some kings of Europe.\n\nWith the emergence of the Physiocratic school the prehistory of economic science drew to a close. They provided a thoughtful perspective on basics economics: value, prices, money, market phenomena, and many more, with a wisdom and sensitivity that we often believe to be only present in Smith and his successors. Not content simply to offer scientific principles to political economy, the Physiocrats invested a great deal of effort for their popularization. It was thanks to them, indeed, that appeared the first reviews and journals of economics. It started with the Gazette du Commerce (1764), continued with the Journal de l’Agriculture, du Commerce et des Finances (1765), and, in the end, appeared the celebrated Éphémérides du citoyen (1765). Directed by Dupont de Nemours, these publications had a decisive impact on the dissemination of free-market ideas in the general public. In the Éphémérides, one even proposed the creation of a Chair in political economy, in Paris. This would have been the first to even appear in the whole world, but this idea was not implemented.\n\nIn the mean time, the precious French legacy was valorized, and vigorously popularized. On the disciplinary side, it was due to the Jounal des Économistes, founded in 1841. Simultaneously, economic principles were transformed into humorous educational stories and pamphlets, by Frederic Bastiat, and even into poetry, as in the now forgotten Barandeguy-Dupont (La bourse, ou Les chercheurs d’or au dix-neuvième siècle, 1856). In the last century, they already had been illustrated with popular novels, like Chinki: Histoires cochinchinoises, by Gabriel-François Coyer (see article in this review).\n\nIt is worth noting that it was in France, also, that grew the roots of the socialist contestation, illustrating the diversity of the economic thought in our country. The eighteenth century had already seen Malby, Forbonnais, and Necker; the nineteenth century brought about Sismondi, Louis Blanc, Considérant, Pecqueur, Leroux, Fourrier, Cabet, Proudhon: they became the main opposition to free-market economists, and influenced Marxism. Like Smith one hundred years before him, Karl Marx has lived in Paris for some time. It was in France that he discovered political economy, and that he wrote his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, his refutation of Proudhon (The Poverty of Philosophy, 1847, answering Proudhon’s The Philosophy of Poverty), as well as the famous Communist Manifesto (1848).\n\nSocialism grew up in France, and it was also in our nation that he received the sharpest and most brutal refutation. Frederic Bastiat, in particular, combated vigorously. On the aftermath of the French revolution of 1848, which gave to the different socialist schools some real prominence, Michel Chevalier, then professor of political economy at the Collège de France, set himself the task of refuting socialist thought once and for all. His brochure, L’Économie politique et le Socialisme, was released in 1849. His rigorous and somehow prophetic criticism of socialism remained for a long time a model of its kind. His argument remains nevertheless silenced since his influence did not reach further than the college de France.\n\nBeyond these ideological struggles, the theoretical depth of French economic thought remained remarkable, and numerous innovative analysis tools emerged. This was for example the case for the mathematical method, which later acquired greater importance. It was a Frenchman, Augustin Cournot, who first initiated this revolutionary move, with his famous Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses, published in 1838. His steps were followed by Léon Walras.\n\nAfter Cournot, Walras continued the mathematization of the economic science. Independently from Carl Menger and W.S. Jevons, he also developed the marginalist theory of value. Founder of the École de Lausanne, he was, according to Joseph Schumpeter, the greatest of all economists, since he was tackling the problem of showing the law of economic evolution and change.\n\nAt the turn of the century, France continued to provide an extremely rich ground for political economy. From one side to the other, the economic thought still rested upon the shoulders of some of our fellowmen. As an example, the first to theorize the “impoverishment theory” — basically saying the poor get poorer and poorer — was French, and it was also from a French economist, the great Paul Leroy-Beaulieu, that this disastrous theory finally received a clear refutation: in 1881, he published a 900-page-long book untitled Essay on the distribution of wealth, and on the tendency of a lower inequality of conditions.\n\nStarting in the early 1880s, the light coming from Paris appeared to be severely fading, and around 1920, it seemed entirely extinguished. The inquiry of explanatory causes would require another article almost as large as this one. Suffice it to point out some of them. First of all, the success of the socialist side, and the rejection of non-Marxist economics as “bourgeoise”, partisan, and thus unscientific. It was then the development of nationalist fever and the worship of government, which later led to the lunacy of fascisms, and the disappearance of both classical liberalism and economic science.\n\nTo this day, the withering away of this intellectual vigor once so superior and glorious is far too real, far too hurting, to be held silent. But it is fruitless and joyless to complain. The French economists only dominated their science to give us practical lessons and rules of action. Let’s listen to them. Let’s be worthy of their example, respectful for their effort, and attentive to their recommendations: it is for sure the best way to celebrate their legacy.\n\nBenoît Malbranque\n\n________\n\n1 Pellegrino ROSSI, Journal des économistes, 1842, t.
