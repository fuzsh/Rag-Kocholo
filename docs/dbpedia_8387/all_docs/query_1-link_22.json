        "text": "In spite of Cournot’s unquestionable influence on contemporary theory, his legacy regarding economic policy and, especially, the regulation of monopolies is mostly unknown. In this paper I explore the several forms of Cournot’s analysis of monopolistic market structures, starting with his theoretical model up to his normative and empirical examination. With the help of little known texts of the author I aim at showing the versatility of his ideas and the richness of his analytical legacy. Against this setup I retrace his influence over three of the most important economists of the end of the XIXth century: Walras, Edgeworth and Marshall. I show that there exists a theoretical representation that constitutes the indisputable reference regarding monopolies that is enriched with normative analyses and leads each one of them to their own specific proposals in regulation and economic policy.\n\nThis paper completes my previous paper \"A Fundamental Reformation of Neoclassical Economics\" with a more global analysis of the mathematical mistakes of the neoclassical theory. During the second half of the twentieth century Microeconomic theory moved increasingly away from price theory, which was gradually displaced by more modern trends such as game theory, behavioral-empirical-experimental economics, industrial organization, neuroeconomics, heterodox economics, etc. This was due to serious shortcomings and (mathematical) mistakes of the traditional theory that is based on Neoclassical economics. The correction of those mistakes entails dramatic changes in the Neoclassical theory and its fundamental outcomes, concerning perfect competition, price determination, value theory, income distribution, social welfare, and other major fields of economics. This reformation results also in an integrated theory in which market works, regardless of the number of firms, i.e. from monopoly to perfect competition. But most importantly, by this reformation traditional price theory regains its self-efficiency, prestige, and dominant position in economics.\n\nPage 1.
