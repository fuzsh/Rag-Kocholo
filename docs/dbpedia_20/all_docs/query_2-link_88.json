        "text": "Tim Keeney@ @t_keenContributor I\n\nPrince, Pie and Pimentel: The 50 Funniest Names in Major League Baseball\n\n0 of 50\n\nGreg Fiume/Getty Images\n\nFrom Rusty Kuntz and Dick Pole to Randy Johnson and Wonderful Monds, baseball has had a knack for providing us with funny names.\n\nWith fantasy baseball season approaching, it's integral for owners to think of a funny team name, and those best team names often stem from actual players.\n\nI've attempted to compile the 50 funniest, ironic, awesome and just random player names of 2011. Enjoy.\n\n50) Prince Fielder\n\n1 of 50\n\nKevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nHis first name is funny. It's Prince. Who names their kid Prince?\n\nHis second name is ironic because he's a fielder over there at first base.\n\nI swear it gets better than this.\n\n49) Jorge Cantu\n\n2 of 50\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nESPN has sort of killed this one with the endless references, but the one liner that comes along with this names makes it pretty good.\n\nTheres no way he can do this. Just no way. Can not.\n\n-Cantu.\n\n48) Marcus Thames\n\n3 of 50\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nYou could always go with Thames' Flames for your fantasy team name.\n\nYou know, if you want to go the corny rhyming route.\n\n47) Shelley Duncan\n\n4 of 50\n\nRob Tringali/Getty Images\n\nGirl's name, man's swing.\n\n46) David DeJesus\n\n5 of 50\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nHis name means \"Of Jesus.\"\n\nCan't get much better than that.\n\n45) Albert Pujols\n\n6 of 50\n\nMarc Serota/Getty Images\n\nJust for the fact that on his ESPN page, it has the pronunciation as \"POO-holes.\"\n\n44) Arcenio Leon\n\n7 of 50\n\nAl Bello/Getty Images\n\nKind of like Arsenio Hall, but with another first name added on there on the end. Just an odd name, really.\n\n43) Josh Outman\n\n8 of 50\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nHe's here for the irony. There's no way that after every strikeout he doesn't yell, \"out, man!\"\n\n42) Clete Thomas\n\n9 of 50\n\nDoug Benc/Getty Images\n\nIt's Clete, the slack-jawed yokel.\n\n41) Jair Jurrjens\n\n10 of 50\n\nMarc Serota/Getty Images\n\nI'm pretty sure Eminem has a line about Jurrjens in \"The Real Slim Shady.\"\n\n40) Hunter Pence\n\n11 of 50\n\nAl Bello/Getty Images\n\nIt's funny to me that you can say, \"how much is Pence worth?\"\n\n-\"Eh, about two cents.\"\n\nOk, not my best.\n\n39) Moises Sierra\n\n12 of 50\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nIt's like if Moises Alou and Ruben Sierra combined to form a super player.\n\n38) Drew Stubbs\n\n13 of 50\n\nNorm Hall/Getty Images\n\nStubbs is a pretty funny name, especially for someone who is as fast as Drew.\n\n37) Delwyn and Delmon Young\n\n14 of 50\n\nJ. Meric/Getty Images\n\nThese names are ridiculously close, but the players aren't even related.\n\nIt's like if there was someone named Icheri Suzuki.\n\n36) Jason Castro/Travis Ishikawa\n\n15 of 50\n\nAl Bello/Getty Images\n\nHave first names ever gone with last names any worse?\n\n35) Fernando Salas\n\n16 of 50\n\nDilip Vishwanat/Getty Images\n\nSalas makes the list because his name is the same forwards as backwards. Awesome.\n\nIf only his first name was racecar.\n\n34) Milton Bradley\n\n17 of 50\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nI'm kind of wondering who has made more money over their lifetime, Milton Bradley the player or Milton Bradley the Company. Funny name, nonetheless.\n\n33) Carlos Santana\n\n18 of 50\n\nRob Tringali/Getty Images\n\nHis name is Carlos Santana. Do I really need to explain how awesome that is?\n\nI just wonder if his girlfriend's name is Maria Maria.\n\n32) Felix Pie\n\n19 of 50\n\nGreg Fiume/Getty Images\n\nMmmm, pie.\n\n31) Chone Figgins\n\n20 of 50\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nHe's Bad to the Chone.\n\nWhat? It's pronounced is Sean? Oh well.\n\n30) Ryan Spilborghs\n\n21 of 50\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nIt's funny for the fact his last name is part \"spill\" and part \"cyborg.\" It's like he's a machine, but he still is clumsy at times and spills things.\n\nIf that doesn't sound like a terrific sitcom, I don't know what does.\n\n29) Phil Coke\n\n22 of 50\n\nPart of the humor lies in the picture, as there is an odd similarity between him and Eastbound and Down's Kenny Powers. And then his last name is coke? Too easy.\n\n28) Drew Naylor\n\n23 of 50\n\nAl Messerschmidt/Getty Images\n\nNames that end in -er are always prime for the 'Naylor? I barely knew her!' jokes.\n\nDoug Fister was an honorable mention for this spot.\n\n27) Grant Balfour\n\n24 of 50\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nThis starts the run of perfect baseball names.\n\nBeing a pitcher and having the last name \"ball four\" can't be good.\n\n26) Mike Minor\n\n25 of 50\n\nKevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nOddly enough, he was able to make it up to the majors last year. Maybe he should change his name.\n\n25) Thomas Diamond\n\n26 of 50\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nAs far as the best baseball-related names go, I think it's a tie between Diamond and this next guy...\n\n24) Anthony Slama\n\n27 of 50\n\nGregory Shamus/Getty Images\n\nI was gonna make some joke about hitting lots of grand slamas until I realized he was a pitcher.\n\nWell, hopefully he doesn't give up a lot of grand slamas.\n\nEven with my terrible jokes, he's got a great baseball name.\n\n23) Jarrod Saltalamacchia\n\n28 of 50\n\nJ. Meric/Getty Images\n\nThat Angelina Jolie film was actually short for Saltalamacchia. Betchya didn't know that.\n\nAlso, has any other 14-letter name rolled off the tongue as well as Saltalamacchia? Terrific.\n\n22) Brandon Beachy\n\n29 of 50\n\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\n\"Brandon, I realize you gave up three homers today, but you don't need to act so beachy.\"\n\nOr, if you want to go a different route with Brandon's name, \"Hmm, what do I want to do today? It feels like a beachy day to me.\"\n\nWordplay at its finest.\n\n21) Lance Broadway\n\n30 of 50\n\nMarc Serota/Getty Images\n\nIt would be at least four times better if his name was Broadway Lance, but it's still a cool name.\n\n20) Marlon Byrd\n\n31 of 50\n\nKevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nNot many people get to have two animals in their name.\n\nI think I would choose Shark Elephant.\n\n19) Blake Hawksworth\n\n32 of 50\n\nNorm Hall/Getty Images\n\nYou know the scene from Mighty Ducks when Gordon Bombay starts quacking at Mr. Ducksworth? \"Thank you very much Mr. Ducksworth. Quack quack quack Mr. Ducksworth.\"\n\nCaaa caaa Mr. Hawksworth. Caa caaaa. Almost as good.\n\n18) Juan Jamie\n\n33 of 50\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nI'm pretty sure that a picture of Juan Jamie doesn't exist, so I used one of Jose Contreras. Just because.\n\nAnyways, the humor in this name is in the pronunciation. You have to pronounce it Juan \"hi-meh,\" possibly in the Inigo Montoya voice from Princess Bride.\n\n17) Diory Hernandez\n\n34 of 50\n\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\nIf I was friends with Hernandez, I would e-mail him at least five times a day and start every single one with:\n\nDear Diory,\n\nToday, I feel...\n\n16) Will Rhymes\n\n35 of 50\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nCoincidentally, this is what Will Smith went by during his rapping days. Or at least he should have.\n\n15) Jordany Valdespin\n\n36 of 50\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nDoes it not seem like his name is a combination between Jordan Valdez and Bethany Aspin.\n\nOkay, I made those names up, but his name seems like some sort of combination of many names. Thinking of those names is the fun of it.\n\n14) Trystan Magnuson\n\n37 of 50\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nWould you ever want to get in a fight with someone named Trystan Magnuson? How tough of a name is that?\n\nI am under the belief that anyone who uses a \"y\" when it should probably be an \"i\" in their name is probably awesome. That's why I want to change my name to Tym.\n\n13) Julio Borbon\n\n38 of 50\n\n12) Adron Chambers\n\n39 of 50\n\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\nAdron Chambers sounds like a place that Harry, Ron and Hermoine had to go through during one of their adventures.\n\n11) Buster Posey\n\n40 of 50\n\nKevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nStraight from Urban Dictionary, a buster is defined as someone who does not keep it real. A poser. I find that quite ironic and funny.\n\nAlso, I'm a fan of \"The Busty Posers\" as a team name.\n\n10) Coco Crisp\n\n41 of 50\n\nThe picture says it all.\n\n9) Al Alburquerque\n\n42 of 50\n\nRonald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nI wonder if people call him Al Al.\n\n8) Justin De Fratus\n\n43 of 50\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nI wonder where this bro pledged in college.\n\n7) Luis Lebron\n\n44 of 50\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nI hear he's a free agent next winter. Uh oh...\n\n6) Antonio Bastardo\n\n45 of 50\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nHis nickname is \"Shawn Kemp's Son.\"\n\n5) Chorye Spoone\n\n46 of 50\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nChorye Spoone is fun to say. As long as it's not pronounced Cory. That would ruin it. The \"ch\" sound has to be in it.\n\n4) Charlie Furbush\n\n47 of 50\n\nNick Laham/Getty Images\n\nHe looks like someone that would be named Charlie Furbush, doesn't he?\n\n3) Trey McNutt\n\n48 of 50\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nYup.\n\n2) Melky Mesa\n\n49 of 50\n\nAl Bello/Getty Images\n\nMelky Mesa. Interesting.\n\n1) Stolmy Pimentel\n\n50 of 50\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nStolmy Pimentel. Seriously. I couldn't make that up.\n\nX"
