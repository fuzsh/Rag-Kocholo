        "text": "Thesis supervision and thesis tutoring\n\nThesis supervision\n\nPhD thesis supervisor\n\nAt the time of making the admission proposal, the academic tribunal of the PhD programme assigns the PhD candidate a thesis supervisor, and this figure will be responsible for the coherence and appropriateness of the activities, impact and innovation in the subject field of the thesis and will guide the planning and adequacy of the research to other projects and activities.\n\nThe designation of a thesis supervisor may fall on any Spanish or Foreign PhD with accredited research experience independently of the university, centre or institution in which they work. At the same time, each PhD programme may establish additional criteria as necessary for the PhD thesis supervisor.\n\nThe supervisor's responsibilities are the following:\n\nTry to ensure that the project is original, innovative and viable, under the terms of the rules, and also that it is coherent with the group or line of the research to which it is linked.\n\nAgree to the plan for the supervision of research work and plan regular meetings. The supervisor informs what documents are required for each meeting (written reports, messages, minutes, handwritten papers etc) to be able to accredit the frequency of the meetings.\n\nAdvise the PhD candidate on the research in general and the preparation of the thesis in particular.\n\nIndicate to the PhD candidate the most appropriate activities for their research when the PhD programme has been identified and sign the activities document.\n\nFacilitate the candidate's participation in the specific and transferrable training activities for the PhD programme in accordance with that established in the commitment document.\n\nSign the commitment and activities document for the PhD candidate.\n\nAssist the PhD candidate in the definition of the PhD research project and the research that will eventually culminate in the PhD thesis.\n\nRevise and sign the research plan for the thesis.\n\nUndertake to regularly supervise in accordance with the commitment document, the research plan for the PhD candidate, and help them to focus the project while it is being carried out.\n\nTry to ensure that the PhD student takes the initiative and achieves increasing autonomy throughout the project.\n\nAssist the PhD candidate to find solutions for different aspects related to their research and establish the specific details and the means required and, where necessary, the experimental design.\n\nLet the PhD candidate know about all the means available to them at the University that are important for their research and help them to access them.\n\nWrite the forms required for the annual review.\n\nRead, correct and comment on the draft thesis before it is deposited, on the conditions that the candidate has provided a copy a reasonable time beforehand.\n\nEnsure that the candidate understands the administrative and academic requirements for the assessment and defence of the thesis as well as the corresponding deadlines throughout the process.\n\nCommunicate health and safety rules to the PhD candidate where necessary.\n\nCommunicate any rule or ethical aspect that may be related to their research.\n\nThe designation of the thesis supervisor may be modified at any time during the PhD programme: whenever there are justified reasons the supervisor may reject supervision of the thesis (in which case the academic tribunal for the programme will suggest a replacement); on petition of the PhD candidate where there are justifications for doing so the academic tribunal of the PhD programme may change the designation of the PhD supervisor.\n\nThesis supervisors outside the PhD programme\n\nThesis supervisors who are not lecturers at the UAB or who have not been appointed as a thesis director must accredit their own PhD qualification and research experience, i.e. specific details of publications, research projects they have worked on and any other information relevant to the lines of research proposed on the PhD programme. Once the above supervisor has been approved, the academic tribunal for the PhD programme may authorise their incorporation into the programme as a possible thesis supervisor (or assign them to a single doctoral thesis).\n\nEach PhD programme must establish which other lecturers, whatever their category as long as they are not included in the programme, are able to supervise the thesis.\n\nJoint supervision of the PhD thesis\n\nThe PhD thesis may be supervised by other PhD holders where there are academic arguments for doing so (such as interdiscplinarity of the subject or national or international programmes) with the prior authorisation of the academic tribunal of the PhD programme. This authorisation may be withdrawn at a later date if, in the opinion of the academic tribunal, the joint supervision is not beneficial to the progress of the thesis.\n\nA PhD thesis may be jointly supervised by up to three PhD holders.\n\nMaximum number of theses per supervisor\n\nEach supervisor may supervise a maximum of five PhD theses simultaneously. The supervision of the PhD thesis concludes at the time the thesis is presented and defended or if the PhD candidate withdraws. In terms of recognition of the teaching and research dedication in situations of joint supervision these should be divided equally.\n\nRecognition of thesis supervision\n\nOne essential way to encourage thesis supervision is by ensuring that this task is recognised and valued: something that the UAB regulations achieve. The approval of the Academic Workload Model for UAB Teaching Staff by the Governing Council on 13 December 2017, significantly improved the system used to calculate and take account of supervision tasks. Article 10.3 stipulates that the supervisor of a doctoral thesis is to have 100 hours recognised per thesis supervised. If supervision is carried out by more than one person, this recognition is shared equally between them.\n\nThesis tutoring\n\nAt the time of application the academic tribunal of the programme will assign the candidate an academic tutor. The academic tutor must be a doctor with accredited research experience, linked to the programme in which has been admitted the doctoral student..\n\nThe academic tutor has the following responsibilities:\n\nEnsure coherence in the tasks of the PhD candidate and supervisor and the research group.\n\nProvide communication between the PhD student and the academic tribunal of the PhD programme.\n\nEnsure the appropriateness of the PhD training and research activity to the programme and the norms of the School for Doctoral Studies.\n\nSign the commitment and activities document for the PhD candidate.\n\nCheck and sign the PhD research plan.\n\nWrite the reports required for the annual review.\n\nThe academic tribunal of the programme can establish, where possible, that the academic tutor can also be the thesis supervisor.\n\nThe designation of the academic tutor may be changed at any time during the PhD course: on the part of the PhD candidate, where there are justified reasons; on the part of the thesis supervisor, where there are justified reasons. In these cases the academic tribunal of the PhD programme has to propose a new tutor.\n\nResearch lines\n\nThe PhD in Medicine programme encompasses various research teams which include the most important aspects of the care and research plan, and are similar to the lines of research in which doctoral students can carry out their research. The objectives and context of each of these lines are summarised below:\n\n1. Cardiology and cardiovascular risk\n\nThis encompasses basic, clinical and epidemiological research that generates new knowledge on the mechanisms of heart and vascular diseases, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic tools and strategies. It also includes ways of applying available drugs and techniques in the prevention and treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease.\n\n2. Dermatology\n\nThis line of research studies and analyses the molecular bases, pathogenic pathways and regulatory pathways of dermatological diseases in order to improve early detection and possible interventions. It is also interested in identifying biomarkers to personalise both treatment and therapy. All areas related to dermatology and genetics associated with dermatology are also of interest.\n\n3. Digestive and hepato-biliary system\n\nThis line of research focuses on everything related to physiology, physiopathology and digestive pathology. It includes both epidemiological and clinical aspects as well as biochemical and molecular aspects. Alterations in motility, absorption, ulcer pathology, inflammation and everything related to the intestinal microbiota are areas of great interest. At the same time, all hepatobiliary diseases, from their causes and mechanisms to biomarkers and treatment, are also studied in this line.\n\n4. Endocrinology\n\nThis includes everything related to the pathogenesis, physiopathology, clinical markers and treatment of all morbidity processes that are specifically linked to the endocrine system, as well as those with diabetes mellitus as a central factor, the understanding of the mechanisms that associate these alterations with cardiovascular risk and morbidity and mortality. Epidemiology and prevention are also a fundamental part of this area of knowledge.\n\n5. Multidisciplinary clinical research\n\nThe multidisciplinary research line includes those projects that do not fit adequately into any of the other lines of the PhD Programme, or because of their multidisciplinary nature, that include areas common to more than one line of research. For example, research on infectious diseases in critically ill patients may include lines of infectious diseases or pneumology. In general, they tend to include researchers from different areas who share knowledge.\n\n6. Infectious diseases\n\nThis line of research is dedicated to improving the strategies used in clinical practice in this field. Once again, it includes knowledge ranging from molecular and cellular causes and mechanisms to epidemiology, clinical and therapeutic management. It also includes part of the study of mechanisms of microbial resistance, taxonomy and the study of both classic and newer diseases, for example, infection in the critically ill , immunocompromised, or transplant patient, AIDS and COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. This line also studies other emerging and imported entities such as Zika virus infection and dengue fever.\n\n7. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\n\nThis line of research deals with diseases affecting the neck, spinal cord, nerves and the musculoskeletal system from the angle of rehabilitation. It will include biological, medical and physical aspects that will offer a better understanding and approach to different types of serious illnesses and traumas. It also includes research aimed at the study and treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain processes of any origin.\n\n8. Nephrology\n\nFrom biology, mechanisms of injury, activity markers, and diagnostics to all the physiopathological aspects of chronic renal failure and renal transplantation are topics of interest in this line of research. Of special interest is the inflammatory pathology affecting the vasculature and glomeruli. Drug-induced nephropathies and hypertension are other major topics of study in this line of research.\n\n9. Neurology\n\nThis is one of the broadest lines of research, including all aspects: epidemiology, molecular bases, aetiopathogenesis, biomarkers, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of an infinite number of large \"mixed bag of illnesses\", among them: headaches, neurovascular pathology, epilepsy, neurodegenerative/mitochondrial, neuromuscular, polyneuropathies, onconeurology and gene therapy.\n\n10. Oncology and haematological diseases\n\nThe oncology and haematology line of research includes and focuses on all aspects of malignancy, from the molecular bases, genetics, epigenetics, cell signalling, cancer epidemiology, from the molecular bases, genetics, epigenetics, cellular signalling, epidemiology of cancer, biomarkers of both malignancy and activity/recurrence, to all the therapies, both conventional - chemotherapy and radiotherapy - and new therapies, such as: immunotherapy treatment, epigenetic modulation, and stem cell transplants in their various types, among others.\n\n11. Respiratory pathology\n\nThis includes all aspects, both basic and clinical, of respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, infections, transplants, pulmonary hypertension and respiratory system disorders (RSD).\n\n12. Imaging Techniques\n\ndes research in radiation therapy, radiodiagnostics and nuclear medicine. It includes technological development and quality control to improve radiotherapy treatment. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments for different tumours. In nuclear medicine this would include research using medical imaging, the former for diagnostic studies, and the latter in theragnostics, which involves the diagnosis and stratification of different tumours.\n\n13. Immunology, allergy and systemic diseases\n\nThis line of research includes the study of molecular and cellular mechanisms, as well as all clinical and therapeutic aspects of alloimmune and autoimmune diseases and autoinflammatory disorders. All studies aimed at finding biomarkers to aid diagnosis and predict clinical activity are welcome. Also everything related to hypersensitivity mechanisms, especially type I, are relevant topics in this line. Basic immunology, clinical immunology, inflammation, drugs and allergy are closely intertwined. Immunosuppressive treatments, immunomodulators, gene therapy, tolerogenic vaccines and CAR T cell type targeted immunotherapy are emerging sub-areas of interest.\n\n14. Minority diseases\n\nThis line of research attempts to bring together knowledge of this group of diseases with a low prevalence (<5/10,000 inhabitants). There are almost 7,000 different \"rare\" diseases, generally poorly diagnosed or with a long diagnostic delay. These include progeria, Fragile X syndrome, Moebius disease, ALS, Fanconi syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Others to be considered are metabolopathies or myopathies. The study of pathogenic mechanisms, molecular bases, diagnostic markers and treatments, generally experimental, are appropriate topics. There is also interest in studying neonatal or family screening techniques and the search for, synthesis, and testing of new drugs – the so-called ‘orphan drugs’.\n\n15. Family and community medicine\n\nThis brings together research on diseases and reasons for consultation prevalent in primary health care, from disease prevention to chronic pathologies, predominantly from the perspective of its applicability to improving the practice of family medicine. In other words, the aim is that the research included in this line will lead to a transfer of knowledge to the whole of routine clinical practice for better care of people's socio-health problems from a biopsychosocial perspective at the primary level of care.\n\nAdmission application\n\nAdmission\n\nThe UAB PhD programs are onsite.\n\nCandidates who wish to access a PhD programme must apply to the academic committee for admissions using the online application form and follow the procedure established by the coordinators or administrative managers responsible for the PhD programme for the proposal of a tutor and thesis supervisor.\n\nYou can find more information about the academic tutor and supervisor of the thesis in the section \"Lines and supervision\".\n\nBefore beginning your application make sure you satisfy the admission requirements, have all the necessary documents which you will need to scan and have seen the admissions calendar.\n\nIf you want to apply for a place on a PhD programme, please note the sections that you must fill in on the application form.\n\nThe applicant must also propose if he wants to do the thesis full-time or part-time.

Supervisors provide written confirmation of this attendance, which is then certified by the coordinator.\n\nHospital sessions\n\nActive participation in the training sessions held periodically in the services of the various hospitals.\n\nThesis supervisors give guidance to students on the most suitable sessions for them. This activity must serve to transfer the knowledge acquired in the sessions and by working on the thesis to clinical practice.\n\nAttendance at a minimum 80% of the training activities recommended by supervisors. Supervisors provide written confirmation of this attendance, which is then certified by the coordinator.\n\nOptional activities:\n\nResearch paper sent to a high-impact scientific journal\n\nMost students on this PhD programme publish their research findings in high-impact journals specialising in the field of health. Students are strongly advised to undertake this activity and add it to their doctoral records.\n\nThey must present the paper and proof of having submitted it to a high-impact scientific journal.\n\nAttendance at seminars or lectures given by experts in the subject area\n\nAttendance at seminars or lectures given by experts in the subject area.\n\nLanguage: Catalan, Spanish, English.\n\nOfficial recognition will be given to seminars or lectures recommended by the supervisor as being of interest to the research project.\n\nStudents must submit the certificate of attendance and a report from the thesis supervisor.\n\nParticipation in workshops or courses on methodological specialisation\n\nOfficial recognition will be given to courses on methodological specialisation recommended by the supervisor as being of interest to the research project.\n\nStudents must submit the certificate of attendance and a report from the thesis supervisor.\n\nTypologies and Research Ethics\n\nThe aim of this set of good research practices is to get an idea of the regulatory framework for activities linked to research and which follow the directives set out in the Statutes of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, based on principles of freedom, democracy, justice, equality and solidarity. This commitment therefore involves orientating the teaching, research and other university activities towards a culture of peace, respect for human rights, social progress, respect for the environment and sustainable development, and the explicit renouncement of research for military ends.\n\n• Good Research Practices: this is a set of points for action, recommendation and commitments when carrying out research.\n\n•Good PhD Practices: is a set of recommendations and commitments that should serve a guide for PhD candidates in their dual role of students and trainee researchers.\n\n• Institutional Biosafety Committee: technical committee made up of experts in evaluating the safety of facilities and activities conducted with biological agents, in identifying any type of potential risk and in ensuring that all regulations relevant to biosafety are met.\n\n• Ethics Committee on Animal and Human Experimentation (CEEAH), establishes mechanisms and procedures to ensure experimentation is complies with prevailing legislation.\n\n• Good Open Acces Practices, good practices of Catalan universities to meet the Open Acces's mandates about publications, as specified on the 'Ley de la ciencia española' and the European Union's Horizon Europe.\n\n• is a European initiative providing access to a complete range of information and support services to researchers wishing to pursue their research careers in Europe or remain connected to research activities in Europe.\n\nInternationalization\n\nForeign residencies\n\nPhD students can progress further in their area of research through stays abroad, which may, when appropriate, come within the framework of bilateral joint-supervision agreements with a foreign university (thesis under joint international supervision) and within the International Doctoral Research Component. Stays abroad can also be made under Erasmus agreements.\n\nStays with Erasmus\n\nYou can make stays abroad (mainly in Europe) with both Erasmus Studies and Erasmus Internships. In the following links you will find the call and the calendars to request them:\n\nErasmus Studies\n\nErasmus Internships\n\nPhD thesis under joint international supervision\n\nOn the proposal of the academic tribunal for a PhD programme, the UAB may make agreements with foreign universities or centres of higher education that are authorised to award PhD qualifications for the purpose of preparing the PhD thesis.\n\nIn that case the PhD student will carry out research under the control and responsibility of a thesis supervisor in each of the institutions in the agreement, and these in turn will each award the PhD qualification on the basis of a single thesis.\n\nJoint supervision agreements may only be signed during the first year of the research work, counted from the day the student is accepted on the PhD programme.\n\nThe period for working on the thesis will be split between the two centres and the minimum stay at the UAB must ne a total of nine months, which may be divided into shorter periods.\n\nSee the detailed application procedure for joint international supervision (in Spanish).\n\nInternational Doctoral Research Component\n\nThe PhD qualification may also include the International Doctoral Research Component, as long as the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\nDuring the training period necessary to obtain the qualification of PhD, the candidate must have been outside Spain for a minimum of three months in a higher education institution or research centre of prestige, and have carried out research or study there.
