Brownson): (Detroit, Michigan)\n\nSarah is just getting around, still quite weak but improving all the time. The baby (Mary Brownson Tentey) is very sweet, looks like mammy (Sarah H. Brownson) very fair with blue eyes turning black. She has the family appetite and Sarah nurses her entirely. Ruthy is overpowering and wears everyone out Jessie has had sole care of her since Sarah has been sick and is pretty much worn out. Sarah wrote Henry just before she was taken sick of the disposition of their father's property. She is anxious to have an answer and to know what woult suit Henry best. They shall all ful better when it is arranged. The baby was named \"Mary\" being born in May and \"Brownson\" for the family name. Father (Augustine F) Hewit was godfather and took everyone by storm.\n\nIII-3a - A.L.S. - 2pp. - 8vo. - {2}\n\n1876 June 3\n\nFreeman's Journal:\n\nAccount of celebration on occasion of Archbishop John B.

She understands all that he told her but feels that she will never rise above the trouble which consumes her; in default of a convent on this earth she will look forward to a convent in heaven. Father M. Dominique had warned her what the decision would be. The day (Perché) leaves France only God will know her suffering if he leaves without her. If she had seen the Father-General earlier, perhaps the decision would not have been the same. Dominique plans to be at Poitiers on the 15th and he will leave on July 4 or 5. She hopes (Perché) will come during that time. To think that she must remain in France after he and Dominique have left causes her great pain.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - (French) - 4pp. - 12mo. - {2}\n\n1876 Jun. 10\n\nBrand, Eugénie: New Orleans, (Louisiana)\n\nto Archbishop (Napoleon Joseph) Perché: Lourdes, (France)\n\nSince Perché's departure death has made many empty places in their family. After the death of Father (Victor) Jamey there died her uncle, Anatole Jamey; her aunt, Mrs. Pauline Ingouf; Lucie Trahant; Trahant's uncle, Flor Boudreaux - the brother of Marie Trahant; and, finally, their grandmother whose good example will accompany them always. She asks Perché to pray to Our Lady of Lourdes to give her enough health to work for her children. Since the birth of her last daughter she has been confined almost constantly to bed. She has had several doctors, including Dr. (Charles) Faget, all of whom say that the only remedy is a very dangerous operation. Others have added that a new pregnancy would endanger her life. She has 4 children living: Paul (Brand), Francis (Brand), Marie (Brand), and Claire (Brand). Sabin (Brand) is still at Donaldson; he comes two days each month. Papa is well but Celina is not.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - (French) - 4pp. - 12mo. - {13}\n\n1876 June 10\n\nMorris, Willie (William): Jackson, Mississippi\n\nto James F. Edwards: Notre Dame, Indiana\n\nHe writes that he is going to Communion tomorrow. He has written to several boys, but only one answered. He will send Edwards a pair of brackets for his room of his own make, and will send some books for the students library. He asks for news of Notre Dame.\n\nXI-1-a - A.L.S. - 4pp. - 8vo. - {1}\n\n1876 Jun. 13\n\nLayton, Tho(ma)s: New Orleans, (Louisiana)\n\nto Archbishop (Napoleon Joseph) Perché: Paris, (France)\n\nLayton sends a clipping from the \"Morning Star\", concerning their recent meeting held in honor of Perché (no enclosure). Father (Gustave A.) Rouxel will bear a more detailed description along with the rough copy of the complimentary letter they intended to write. Their mutual friend, Mr. Girardey, was was very considerate in conceiving and efficient in causing this meeting to be carried into execution. He has given Father (Joseph Anstaett) Anstadt $100 on Perché's account to take a journey for the benefit of his health. He sends Perché a check for 1000 francs on Messrs. Marcuard André & Company, the same being Perché's balance in the (Southern) Bank. Mrs. Layton and Dr. Layton unite in best wishes.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - 2pp. - 4to. - {4}\n\n1876 Jun. 13\n\nManoncourt, Marie: Chalon, (France)\n\nto Archbishop (Napoleon Joseph Perché): Paris, (France)\n\nThey have only just learned from the Bishop of Autun that the ceremony in which she will take the habit of the Dominican (Sisters) has been fixed for the 20th and that Father Lelong will replace Bishop (Adolphe Louis Albert Perraud) Perrault and preach the sermon. Their mothers are desolate about the short space of time that this leaves them to inform (Perché), for they would like very much to have him assist at the ceremonies. An immediate reply will be necessary.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - (French) - 3pp. - 12mo. - {4}\n\n1876 Jun. 14\n\nLaffau, Ch(arles): Paris, (France)\n\nto Archbishop (Napoleon Joseph Perché: Paris, France)\n\nHe thanks (Perché) for his letter, and sends him the address of his son, René Laffau in New Orleans. René does not have the consolation of religion but Laffau counts on (Perché) bringing it to him. He wants his son to return to assist him in his work but he places as a condition that he bring with him his son, Raoul (Laffau). His daughter-in-law does not wish to be separated from her son who is 14 years old. He asks (Perché) to use his influence. He has money for the trip and room in his apartment for his son and his grandson but not for his daughter-in-law and her daughter. Mrs. Legardeur, the mother of his daughter-in-law, is as stubborn as a mule and she dominates her daughter. He wishes he had the money to make a loan to (Perché). He would bring his subscription. (Albin) Rochereau also. He spoke to (Perché) of L. Peychaud of Bordeaux as someone who might be useful to him. Peychaud knows him only as Suez, and he does not wish him to know his name.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - (French) - 4pp. - 12mo. - {6}\n\n1876 June 15\n\nMeany, M. L.: Philadelphia, (Pennsylvania)\n\nto Father (Daniel E. Hudson) C.S.C.: (Notre Dame, Indiana)\n\nShe is rather disappointed in the subject that Father wants her to write for the Ave Maria. She would like to write a few columns in the magazine of some special book reviews that she has on hand. This would appeal to the Catholic readers and increase the scope of Catholic literature. She sent a piece on the Visitation and will send a short write up on The Precious Blood.\n\nX-2-d - A.L.S. - 2pp. - 12mo. - {1}\n\n1876 June 16\n\n(Brownson) Orestes (A Jr.): Dubuque, Iowa\n\nto (Henry F. Brownson): (Detroit, Michigan)\n\nHenry's letter of the 11th. was received with great pleasure at the good news as well as for its kind tone. Orestes hopes that Henry or whoever has the money will send him his share as soon as possible for he is very poor, in fact some of the little girls have no shoes, etc. He has eight children now, the two oldest boys 19 and 13 years of age, work every day in the lead mines, but as yet have not \"struck a lead\"; the other boys is a baby and 5 girls are expensive. With a small part of the sum Henry mentions, Orestes could get a house and farm spot, where he could raise all his vegetables. Therefore, Henry is to excuse his anxiety for his portion of his father's estate as soon as possible. If the Catholics do not raise a monument to their champion (Brownson), without his family mentioning it, Orestes will try to stir them up on the subject, but he does not think it his duty at present to contribute largely to the monument. Sarah (M Brownson Tenney) does not, he hopes, expect more than a third of the estate, unless (Orestes A. Brownson) made a will to that effect. Did he leave a will or testament? As to publishing and editing (Brownson's) books Henry is by all means the person to do that. Henry is eminently qualified and neither Sarah nor Orestes are. Besides they all prefer (Brownson's) works to be edited by one of his children. Orestes does not known what (Brownson) wish in this matter was. Therefore only, expresses his own pride that Brownson's son and his brother can and will carry out their father's views. Orestes desires to know however, how Henry's to be paid for this labor of editing and if it is at the price of (Brownson's) library as Orestes suspects. Orestes wants to know what has become of that library and the household furniture and goods, and if they were sold or were taken as claimed by Sarah when their mother died. When Ned (Edward Patrick Brownson) died, Orestes got a small box of clothes, but when mother died, he got nothing, not even a handkerchief that had been used by the best woman in the world. Orestes hopes Henry will explain everything in his spare time.\n\nIII-3-a - A.L.S. - 2pp - 8vo. - {3}\n\n1876 June 19\n\nRoberts, R. V.: Washington, D. C.\n\nto Father (Daniel E. Hudson, C.S.C.): (Notre Dame, Indiana)\n\nHe includes the second parcels of \"Child Martyrs of Japan\", all in order. He is rather disappointed over the fact that he did not receive an offering for his last set of poems. Financially, he is rather hard pressed and would like some remuneration for his next work. He would like to know how many papers he should write for the Ave Maria so he could be on a set schedule. He will send the poems he has in his scrap book collection for the Ave Maria.\n\nX-2-d - A.L.S. - 4pp. - 12mo. - {1}\n\n1876 Jun. 20\n\nLepargneux(?): Paris, (France)\n\nto Archbishop (Napoleon Joseph Perché: Bordeaus, France)\n\nLepargneux went several times to remind (Perché) of his promise to have dinner with them but the reply made to him at the hotel gives him little hope. If in returning to Paris (Perché) should pass by Nantes, Lepargneux asks him to ask Mr. Fournier, who he is told has two charming nieces, if it would not be possible for one of them to marry a young, great lawyer of Paris. After what (Am.) Lutton said to him, Lepargneux is confident that a union begun under (Perché's) patronage would be most fortunate. In regard to Lutton he never receives any direct news of his success at Philadelphia.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - (French) - 3pp. - 8vo. - {3}\n\n1876 Jun. 21\n\n(Panneau), Cecilia: (France)\n\nto Archbishop (Napoleon Joseph Perché):\n\n(Perché) should have received her letter this morning. She has just spent two hours in a kind of agony. Yesterday, she saw Bishop (Vitale Maria Gonzalves de Oliveira, O.M. Cap.,) of Pernambuco at the Capuchins; he will sup with her, Father Peyramale, and Father Exupère on July 1. Perhaps Father Marie Antoine will be there also. Paule (Pujol) has been suffering so much since Monday that the doctor has forbidden the least movement; Father Emmanuel planned to go see her this afternoon. She has not yet seen Mr. Roger but will do everything possible to do so at the first opportunity. The bishop would like to meet (Perché) and the guardian told her how much the whole community had been charmed and edified by his visit. Her sister, Sister Alphonse (Panneau?), Superioress of the Daughters of the Cross, begs her to thank him for the consolation he gave their whole house. The young lady who played the organ at the Convent and who was so happy to assist at (Perché's) breakfast is Mrs. Mourlan(?). The whole house and also Térèse present their respects. Yesterday, she received a letter from Mr. Mathieu announcing that his wife was returning to Lourdes tomorrow. She has invited her to join them on Saturday for the Christian agape on which occasion (Perché) might like to preside over their small colony.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - (French) - 6pp. - 12mo. - {13}\n\n1876 June 23\n\nChisholm, Father Archibald: Highgate Hill, London\n\nto Father (Daniel E. Hudson, C.S.C.): (Notre Dame, Indiana)\n\nHe read and extract from the Ave Maria in the article \"Catholic Action\" received from Rome through a friend. Has a list of Catholic Converts over a period of 30 years from England. The list includes 360 Clerical gentlemen; 64 aristocrates; 460 gentlemen of standing; 90 ladies of title; 338 ladies, and persons from the United States who are not on the list in America. This list would be worthwhile to publish in the Ave Maria as it would promote the Catholic faith and people would become curious why these learned people were joining the Catholic Faith.\n\nX-2-d - A.L.S. - 3pp. - 32mo. - {1}\n\n1876 June 23\n\nWilliams, John J., Archbishop of Boston: Boston, (Massachusetts)\n\nto Archbishop J(ohn) B(aptist) Purcell: of Cincinnati, O(hio)\n\nFather (Joseph M.) Finotti asks Williams to send his Exeat, saying that Purcell will receive it. He hopes Finotti finds the climate there more favorable than theirs.\n\nII-5-f - A.L.S. - 1p. - 12mo. - {2}\n\n1876 June 24\n\nBellesheim, Father G. Alphonsus: Cologne, Germany\n\nto Father Daniel E. Hudson, C.S.C.: (Notre Dame, Indiana)\n\nHe received the Ave Maria and printed the article of Brownson in the leading Catholic paper. On Good Friday the deposition of the Archbishop will take place. Will forward a few lines of this incident to you.\n\nX-2-d - A.L.S. - 2pp. - 12mo. - {1}\n\n1876 June 26\n\nPombriay, H. de: St. Louis, Missouri\n\nto Father (Daniel E. Hudson, C.S.C.): (Notre Dame, Indiana)\n\nHe tells of the family of DuMont receiving three authentic relics from Rome. He suggests that the Society of St. Martin for the clothing of the poor be publicized in the Ave Maria. It would be commendable to establish a branch of the Association in the United State in conjunction with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. Miss Sherman is rather active in promoting the Indian Missions. Monsignor Caw and Archbishop Morlot through the Holy Father give their indorsement for the promotion of this work. The manuscript will be proof-read by the Globe. Demural Wholby is a good and trustworthy man to do this job. He would like to know what his services would be worth from Hudson's stand point. A synopsis of the biography of M. Dupont is included in this letter, with particulars.\n\nX-2-d - A.L.S. - 4pp. - 8vo. - {1}\n\n1876 June 27\n\nde Goesbriand, Louis, Bishop of Burlington: Burlington, Vermont\n\nto Father (Daniel E. Hudson): (Notre Dame, Indiana)\n\nBishop de Goesbriand thanks Hudson for sending the Ave Maria free of charge.\n\nX-2-d - A.L.S. - 1p. - 12mo. - {1}\n\n1876 Jun. 27\n\nRobert, A(lexander): New Orleans, (Louisiana)\n\nto Archbishop N(apoleon) J(oseph) Perché: France\n\nC.J. O'Hara desires to write to the keeper of the gallery of art in Rome on the subject of a genuine picture of Raphael of which he is the present owner and asks Robert to ask Perché to direct the letter to him.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - 2pp. - 12mo. - {3}\n\n1876 June 28,\n\n(Brownson), Orestes (A. Jr.): Dubuque, Iowa\n\nto (Henry F. Brownson): (Detroit, Michigan)\n\nThe box Henry sent came all right and everything in it is not only of great use to Orestes, but is highly prized as belonging to (his father). Henry is to thanks his wife (Josephine Brownson) for packing the box and trust she has fully recovered from her recent illness. Orestes could not have been more pleased unless the box had been larger. He asks now Henry to tell him all about (Brownson's) estate and what is to be done on Orestes' part if anything and to what he is entitled. He never dreamed of Henry's taking offense at some joking remarks Orestes wrote and hopes this infortunate misunderstanding will not prevent them from cordial and fraternal correspondence. He trusts they shall be just each to other.\n\nIII-3-a - A.L.S. - 2pp. - 12mo. - {1}\n\n1876 Jun. 28\n\nO'Hara, C.J.: New Orleans, L(ouisian)a\n\nto Archbishop (Napoleon Joseph Perché): (France)\n\nAbout three weeks ago O'Hara wrote (Perché) regarding his invention of a combustible bullet. He has since demonstrated its efficiency to the French Consul and Vice-Consul. He asks (Perché) to direct a letter to the curator of the Vatican Gallery of art. He assures (Perché) that in the event of success with either the bullet or the painting that he will not forget (Perchés) financial embarrassment.\n\n- A.L.S. - 4pp.\n\nEnclosure:\n\n1876 Jun. 24\n\nO'Hara, C.J.: New Orleans, (Louisiana)\n\nto\n\nCurator of the Vatican Gallery of ArtRome, Italy\n\nO'Hara believes he has discovered Raphael's long-lost \"Last Supper\". The Count of Turenne was (at New Orleans) not long since and declared it to be Raphael's. It bears the mark of Marc Antonio (Raimondi), Raphael's engraver. It answers in every way to descriptions of the painting. All around the margin there is an irregularity of outline which shows plainly that the picture was rudely cut from its frame. He would act upon any plan that might be suggested for sending the painting to Rome to compare it with the edges still in the original frame. (Enclosed newspaper clippings report the discovery, one being from the New Orleans \"Picayune\" of June 11, 1876.)\n\n- A.L.S. - 4pp.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - 9pp. - 12mo. - {4}\n\n1876 Jun. 28\n\nPanneau, Cecilia: (France)\n\nto Archbishop Napoleon Joseph Perché:\n\nPanneau would like (Perché) to be able to receive the relics of St. Germain at the same time as her letter, but the reliquary is not ready. This morning she received a little money from her notary which she will bring to him. She will also bring him all the letters from Paule (Pujol), which should greatly console Perché as she is so much better than Panneau. She has received by chance, an Agnus Dei of St. Paul which she plans to give to Paule.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - (French) - 4pp. - 12mo. - {2}\n\n1876 Jun. 28\n\n(Panneau), Cecilia: (France)\n\nto Archbishop (Napoleon Joseph Perché):\n\nCecilia just received his letter of the 27th. She arrived to wish a happy feast day to Paule (Pujol). The latter is well and they will leave on Saturday. Mrs. de Peireyra, who has made the whole journey with her, is as anxious as she to see (Perché). It will be a great consolation for Cecilia because her poor Therese has caused her great concern yesterday and today. If (Perché) had told her how bad his cold was, she would have gotten him at Bordeaux a syrup which gave her very satisfying results. She includes the best wishes of Mrs. de Peireyra and all their sisters.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - (French) - 4pp. - 12mo. - {3}\n\n1876 Jun. 29\n\nBonnet, Father: Joursac, (France)\n\nto Archbishop (Napoleon Joseph Perché):\n\nFor some time Bonnet has wanted to be a missionary. When Bishop (William Henry) Elder of Natchez passed through on a trip to France, he applied for mission duty in his diocese but was told a knowledge of English would be indispensable. Elder suggested (Perché) might be able to use him.\n\nVI-2-o - A.L.S. - (French) - 2pp. - 12mo. - {2}\n\n1876 June 29,\n\n(Brownson) Orestes (A. Jr.): Dubuque, Iowa\n\nto (Henry F. Brownson): (Detroit, Michigan)\n\nOrestes has received letter from both Henry and Sarah (M. Brownson Tenney) and although on the same subject, they do not coincide very remarkably. Orestes believes all three are agreed in claiming one third of (Brownson's) estate and are willing all to take one third of the money in hand. Orestes hopes Henry and Sarah will send him a third of that money belonging to the estate they have or that may come into their hands, as soon as possible as he is terribly cramped for means now. Orestes wishes to know all about the $2,000 investment and if he can realize on it now. He asks Henry if it were not better for them, or at least for Orestes, to sell his interests in the copyright. As to the library he cannot believe that (Brownson) died suddenly and left not a book of his once magnificent library that was his own. Henry and Sarah do not agree about the library, the copyrights and the house-hold goods, furniture, clothing etc. Orestes is inclined to think there is room for trouble and wishes all three of them could meet and settle everything peaceably, quietly and without scandal. Sarah speaks of what Orestes got since (Brownson) was in Detroit. This is a mystery to Orestes for he received nothing from (Brownson) while in Detroit. Orestes asks if Henry knows anything about this (Orestes A. Brownson) often made Orestes promises which those aquainted with his hasty disposition never expected him to keep, but he never gave Orestes one dollar with the permission to do what Orestes pleased with it. He always attached a condition that frequently cost Orestes much more than the value of the present. But Orestes has promised himself never more to quarrel with Henry or Sarah, and he trusts these things will be arranged in a just, honorable and legal manner, satisfactory to all. As to editing (Brownson's) works, Orestes would like to try some of them, as Sarah is unwilling Henry should edit them, and Orestes suggests dividing the works but he does not want the Catholic works.\n\nIII-3-a - A.L.S. - 2pp - 8vo - {3}\n\n1876 Jun. 30\n\nHendricken, Bishop Th(omas) F.: Providence, R(hode) I(sland)\n\nto (Patrick V.)
