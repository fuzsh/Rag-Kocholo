        "text": "Formentera\n\nFormentera is the smallest of the Balearic Islands and has so far avoided large-scale development. The easy-going lifestyle here is totally seductive and it has so many beaches that you won’t struggle to find one that you’ll have to yourself all day. Diving is also recommended here, as the pure waters ensure excellent visibility when exploring reefs and underwater caves. Located just south of Ibiza, Formentera is very popular for daytime excursions. Rent a scooter or bike and explore the charming villages, sleepy harbour towns and colourful hippy markets. Taste some Mediterranean food in the laid-back harbour-side restaurants of La Savina, and enjoy the collection of cocktail bars and open-air street cafes in Es Pujols.\n\nExplore Formentera\n\nIbiza\n\nFor many guests on a luxury yacht charter in Ibiza, it’s all about sun, sand, sea and one never-ending party. Ibiza’s beautiful coastline is home to over 80 beaches, with Cala Bassa in San Antonio and Playa d’en Bossa topping most people’s lists, though you’ll find more peace at Santa Eulària d’es Riu. Watersports are also popular in Ibiza and there are natural sites, such as the Cova de Can Marca caves, with their stalagmites and stalactites, that are worth a visit. For a taste of Ibiza’s chilled-out vibe, the old walled city of Ibiza Town, with its maze of narrow streets and cool bars, rarely disappoints.\n\nExplore Ibiza\n\nMallorca\n\nVisit the largest isle of the Balearic Islands, Mallorca, known for its fabulous weather, over 200 beaches and dramatic coastline. Cruise around this popular vacation spot, discover underground lakes, mysterious Dragon Caves and soak up the old Spain in the historic Port d’Alcudia. Tour the azure waters around the Balearic vinyards, and taste the native tipples of Manto Negro and Callet. If you’d like to visit some of its famously picturesque villages, you’ll need to head to the hills and our favourite is probably Valldemossa with its blonde stone houses and 13th-century monastery, hidden away in the lush setting of the Tramuntana Mountains. Coming a close second is Soller, where the art nouveau mansions are incongruous amid the citrus groves and craggy hillsides.\n\nExplore Mallorca\n\nMenorca\n\nThe quieter, shyer sibling to Mallorca, Menorca has retained much of her virgin landscape and traditional Spanish heritage. Menorca is blessed with a stunningly beautiful coastline and boasts more beaches than all the other Balearic Islands put together. Consequently, it’s a veritable Eden for sun worshippers and water sports enthusiasts. Culturally, Menorca is one of the richest islands in the Mediterranean, it’s often referred to as an open-air museum, as it’s studded with ancient ruins, old fortresses and ancient churches from different periods in the island’s tumultuous history.\n\nExplore Menorca\n\nPalma\n\nPalma, the capital of Mallorca, is an architectural and cultural jewellery box. From a 12th-century Moorish-gothic palace to baroque churches and Gaudi’s unmistakeable modernist influence, Palma wears its history of colonisation and development on its facades and is a delight to wander. The pretty port is close to many of the main museums and galleries and its many plazas are perfect for dining alfresco on traditional Mallorcan delicacies. Palma is a fine place to sail, with a coastline that seems to be made up almost exclusively of beautiful beaches, turquoise blue water and multicoloured sealife. There's no lack of ideal anchorage spots and excellent marina facilities whilst you stop off on your travels. The reliable sea breezes off of Palmas coast make for a perfect start as you hop around the Balearics.\n\nExplore Palma\n\nSa Dragonera\n\nThis slither of an island, separated from Mallorca by a narrow channel, is an uninhabited nature reserve that is home to lots of hundreds of species of plant, plus wildlife, including birds of prey and wall lizards – a subspecies endemic to here. The east coast of the small island has lots of secret coves to drop anchor in, while the west coast is guarded by some spectacular cliffs. This uninhabited islet's name derives from Dragon, which is associated to the shape the island has from a specific perspective. The scenic gem of Sa Dragonera is a delightful destination for a day trip from Mallorca, mesmerising visitors with its intact natural landscape. The steep rocky cliffs are home to breeding colonies of Eleonora falcons and Peregrine falcons.\n\nExplore Sa Dragonera"
