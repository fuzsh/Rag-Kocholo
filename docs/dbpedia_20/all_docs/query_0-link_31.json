        "text": "2 Methods\n\n2.1 Patients and samples\n\nA series of 140 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples, from STS patients treated with trabectedin in real-life setting at any line of advanced disease, was selected from a Spanish Group for Research on Sarcomas (GEIS) registry and was the basis of this translational research. All the samples were collected with the informed consent signed from the patients, according to national regulations, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees and the institutional review board of each participant center. Study procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n2.2 Oncology Biomarker Panel\n\nThe HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel (OBP) direct-transcriptomic assay quantitatively measures the expression of 2549 human RNA transcripts (https://www.htgmolecular.com/assays/obp) associated with tumor biology. Among these RNA transcripts, 118 are associated with DDR mechanisms and only these genes were considered for the purpose of this study. For direct transcriptomics, all the samples used in the assay had to have at least 70% of tumor area; samples with less than 70% tumor or with more than 20% of necrotic tissue underwent macro-dissection. All the samples and controls were quantified in triplicate, and no template control was included in each run.\n\nThe RNA-Seq libraries were synthesized through HTG EdgeSeq chemistry. In summary, this method consists of a first step that lysed and permeabilized the sample, which allows the release of the RNA. Then, nuclease protection probes were added to the lysed samples to hybridize with the exposed mRNA and target-captured the transcripts. The S1 nuclease was added to the mix, allowing the production of a stoichiometric amount of target mRNA/nuclease protection probes duplexes. The reaction was blocked by denaturing S1 enzyme by heat. In order to reduce potential biases in the run, the samples were randomized before the inclusion in the HTG EdgeSeq system.\n\nPCRs were set up using each hybridized sample as template and specially designed tags that shared common sequences complementary to 5′-end and 3′-sequences of the probes, as well as with common adaptors that are required for cluster generation on an Illumina sequencing platform. Additionally, each tag contains a unique barcode useful for sample identification and multiplexing. Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, MA, USA) was used to clean the PCR amplification product.\n\nMoreover, the libraries were quantified by quantitative PCR, using the KAPA Library Quantification (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples and controls were quantified in triplicate, and no template control was included in every run. Library denaturation was performed by adding first 2 N NaOH to the library, followed by the addition of 2 N HCl. The PhiX was spiked in at a 5% (concentration of 12.5 pm).\n\nOne demultiplexed FASTQ file per sample was retrieved from the sequencer for data processing. The HTG EdgeSeq host software performed the alignment of the FASTQ files with the probe list, the results were parsed, and the output was obtained as a read counts matrix. The HTG EdgeSeq was run in the VERIP service laboratory of HTG in Tucson (HTG Molecular Diagnostics, Tucson, AZ, USA).\n\n2.3 Data filtering and normalization\n\nNegative control probes were used as quality control to evaluate baseline performance, as previously described by Chadly et al. [[17]]. Briefly, the mean of negative probes for each sample was calculated, and the difference between negative control average and the mean of all negative control probes was obtained (Δmean). Those samples with a Δmean outside the bounds of ±2 standard deviation were excluded from the study. Of 140 sample initially included in the study, seven were removed from the analysis. Data normalization was performed by applying trimmed mean of M-values method (TMM) using edger package from r/bioconductor, adjusting for the total reads within a sample [[18]].\n\n2.4 Differential gene expression analysis\n\nFor differential gene expression analysis, samples were grouped according to PFS, growth modulation index (GMI), or clinical benefit/response of trabectedin. PFS was measured from the date of initial treatment with trabectedin (PFS) to the event of progression or death, whichever occurred first. Clinical benefit was defined as the percentage of patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and/or stable disease (SD). Response was evaluated according to RECIST v.1.1. GMI was expressed as a ratio of intrapatient successive time-to-progression (TTP): GMI = TTP under trabectedin/TTP for the treatment prior to trabectedin.\n\nFor PFS analysis, the low-risk group (better prognosis) was made up of the cases with a PFS value higher than the median (3.2 months) and the high-risk group (worse prognosis) comprised of the samples with PFS lower than the median. For GMI analysis, the low-risk group comprised of samples with a GMI ≥ 1.33 and the high-risk group the cases with a GMI < 1.33. For RECIST response or clinical benefit analysis, samples were grouped as both: cases with response versus cases with stable or progressive disease or cases with response or stable disease versus cases with progression disease (PD).\n\nThe differential gene expression between groups was evaluated by a negative binomial generalized log-linear model, using the edger package and implementing the procedure proposed by Robinson and Smyth [[19]]. The correction for multiple comparisons of Benjamini and Hochberg was applied, and a P-value threshold of 0.05 was set [[20]]. Fold change (FC) values were obtained, along with P-values and adjusted P-values (false discovery rate; FDR) for the 118 genes evaluated. The batch effect was taken into account by adding batch information to the model as a covariable. For data visualization and later analyses, normalized log-TMM values were obtained and the variability due to batch effect was removed using the removeBatchEffect method implemented in limma r package.\n\nAll analyses were performed with r/bioconductor (3.10) running on r version 3.6.0, (https://www.r-project.org/).\n\n2.5 Statistical analysis\n\nThe variables that followed binomial distributions (e.g., patient demographics) were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Categorical variables were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies or as continuous variables as median, range (minimum–maximum). Gene expression levels were indicated as mean ± standard deviation. The comparisons between quantitative and qualitative variables were performed through U of Mann–Whitney nonparametric test. FDR was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. PFS and overall survival (OS) from trabectedin initiation were estimated according to the Kaplan–Meier method. The log-rank test was used to determine the associations between the variables of interest (i.e., gene expression and clinical outcomes). The P-values reported were 2-sided, and the statistical significance was defined at P ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with spss 22.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).\n\n2.6 Construction of a predictive signature based on gene expression\n\nRaw counts were normalized to transcripts per million (TPM), as it is a more appropriate unit to compare expression across samples than normalized counts from other methods such as deseq2 and edger. Of 140 cases included, only one patient with PFS = 0 was removed from the predictive gene signature analysis.\n\nUnivariate Cox regression analysis using the survival package was performed to find individual genes whose expression was significantly associated (P < 0.05) with PFS. Additionally, patients were divided, for each gene, into two groups, using an optimal cutoff from the survminer package which maximized the separation of Kaplan–Meier curves of every group, and only those genes with significantly different curves (P < 0.05) were further retained.\n\nThe remaining genes were used as input to build a gene expression signature using a multivariate Cox regression applying a Lasso penalty to minimize the risk of overfitting with the glmnet package. The penalty parameter was calculated using a fourfold cross-validation (at the minimum partial likelihood deviance) of the complete cohort, randomly dividing 75% and 25% of patients into training and testing sets, respectively, 10 000 times.\n\nRisk scores were calculated by multiplying the expression of every gene with its corresponding Cox regression coefficient, for each patient:\n\nAll analyses were performed in r (version 4.0.3).\n\n3 Results\n\n3.1 Patient demographics\n\nA subset of 140 STS patients treated with trabectedin at line of advance disease with FFPE tumor sample available for RNA expression analysis was included in this translational study. The median age was 51 (17–79) years with 54% (n = 75) being female. Among the 140 STS included, 81% (n = 114) were localized at diagnosis, with 66% (n = 93) and 34% (n = 47) having a somatic or visceral primary tumor location, respectively. Of 140 cases, 59% (n = 83) were grade 3, 24% (n = 33) were grade 2, and 13% (n = 18) were grade 1. The most frequent subtypes were leiomyosarcoma (n = 44; 31%), liposarcoma (n = 32; 23%), synovial sarcoma (n = 14; 10%), and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (n = 14; 10%), while 26% (n = 36) were diagnosed with other sarcoma subtypes. Patient demographics are depicted in Table 1.\n\n3.2 Trabectedin outcome and univariate analysis\n\nWith a median follow-up of 45 months, the median PFS of trabectedin line was 3.5 months, and the median of OS measured from the trabectedin initiation was 12 months. There were 124 out of 140 patients evaluable for response by RECIST with the following distribution: 6 (4.8%) CR, 14 (11.3%) PR, 42 (33.9%) SD, and 62 (50.0%) PD as best response. The GMI was ≥ 1.33 in 40 (29%) cases, < 1.33 in 97 (69%) patients, whereas in 3 (2%) cases, this value was not calculable.\n\nIn the univariate analysis, grade 3 tumors were associated with a worse PFS [3.0 months (95% CI 2.2–3.8) vs 6.5 months (95% CI 2.0–11.0); P = 0.003] and worse OS [10.2 months (95% CI 5.7–14.7) vs 17.5 months (95% CI 13.9–21.1); P = 0.041], and diagnosis of L-sarcoma subtypes was correlated with a better PFS [6.1 months (95% CI 3.6–8.5) vs 3.0 months (95% CI 2.0–4.0); P = 0.001] and better OS [18.2 months (95% CI 13.2–23.1) vs 7.2 months (95% CI 3.7–10.8); P = 0.001]. Somatic location was associated with a better PFS in our series [5.6 months (95% CI 3.2–7.9) vs 2.7 months (95% CI 2.1–3.2); P = 0.006]. Patients receiving trabectedin in first or second line had better PFS [6.3 months (95% CI 1.0–11.5) vs 3.2 months (95% CI: 2.4–4.0); P = 0.001] (Table 2). Visceral location [HR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.3–2.8), P = 0.002] and non-L-sarcoma [HR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.3–2.9), P = 0.001] were independent factors associated with a worse PFS of trabectedin in the multivariate analysis.\n\n3.3 Expression of DNA damage repair genes in STS\n\nThe expression of DDR-related genes was heterogeneous, being DNAJB8 (log2 2.80 ± 1.45) and APEX1 (log2 9.97 ± 0.66) the most underexpressed and overexpressed genes, respectively, among the transcripts analyzed (Table S1).\n\nConsidering the expression of DDR-related transcripts in relation to the clinical variables grouped as: L-sarcomas vs non-L-sarcomas and grade 3 vs grade 1–2, the outcome was as follows: of 118 genes analyzed, only two genes were significantly overexpressed (i.e., BRIP1, DNAJB5) in L-sarcomas, compared with non-L-sarcomas, whereas 16 genes were significantly underexpressed (i.e., DDB2, DNAJA1, DNAJA2, DNAJB2, DNAJC10, DNAJC14, DNAJC16, ERCC3, ERCC6, MMS19, MSH2, PMS2, SMUG1, TDG, and XRCC5) in L-sarcomas, compared with other STS subtypes. Grade 3 tumors showed a significant overexpression, compared with grade 1–2 cases, of APEX2, BRIP1, DNAJC1, DNAJC11, EXO1, FEN1, MSH2, MSH6, NEIL2, NEIL3, PRKDC, RAD21, RAD51, RAD54L, RPA3, TREX1, and XRCC3, whereas ATM and XPC were overexpressed in this latter group, compared with grade 3 tumors (Table S2).\n\n3.4 Differential gene expression and univariate analysis\n\nDifferential gene expression analysis was carried out in 133 cases after data normalization.\n\nTwenty genes were significantly and differently expressed, by multiple comparisons (FDR < 0.05), for the PFS of trabectedin (Table 3 and Fig. S1). High expression of PARP3 (logFC = 1.738; FDR < 0.001), POLL (logFC = 1.767; FDR = 0.002), PMS1 (logFC = 0.764; FDR = 0.003), RAD52 (logFC = 0.875; FDR = 0.003), ATM (logFC = 0.444; FDR = 0.014), NEIL1 (logFC = 0.773; FDR = 0.021), TOP3B (logFC = 1.374; FDR = 0.030), CCNH (logFC = 0.620; FDR = 0.030), XRCC5 (logFC = 0.862; FDR = 0.030), DDB2 (logFC = 0.314; FDR = 0.031), MUTYH (logFC = 0.369; FDR = 0.034), DNAJB14 (logFC = 0.420; FDR = 0.035), and XPC (logFC = 0.512; FDR = 0.037) was associated with longer PFS, whereas the overexpression of DNAJB11 (logFC = −0.378; FDR = 0.003), PARP1 (logFC = −0.442; FDR = 0.007), TDG (logFC = −0.312; FDR = 0.030), TOP3A (logFC = −0.451; FDR = 0.030), PRKDC (logFC = −0.392; FDR = 0.030), DNAJC11 (logFC = −0.309; FDR = 0.030), and RAD23B (logFC = −0.311; FDR = 0.035) were associated with worse PFS.\n\nThe univariate analysis revealed that PARP3 and CCNH overexpression was markedly related to a longer PFS of trabectedin: 7.7 months (95% CI 4.6–10.9) vs 2.8 months (95% CI 2.1–3.6), P < 0.001 and 7.9 months (95% CI 4.8–11.0) vs 2.5 months (95% CI 1.9–3.0), P < 0.001, respectively. On the other extreme, DNAJB11 and PARP1 overexpression was notably related to a shorter PFS of trabectedin: 2.5 months (95% CI 2.3–3.7) vs 8.2 months (95% CI 5.2–11.1), P < 0.001 and 2.5 months (95% CI 1.8–3.1) vs 6.4 months (95% CI 4.0–8.8), P < 0.001, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table S3). The remaining genes with statistical significance for the PFS of trabectedin, as well as their impact in OS from trabectedin initiation, are represented in Table S3.\n\nThe overexpression of BRCA1 gene was significantly associated with worse PFS of trabectedin [2.5 months (95% CI 1.6–3.3) vs 6.1 months (95% CI 2.5–9.7), P = 0.001]; however, neither the expression of ERCC1 [5.2 months (95% CI 2.5–8.0) vs 3.0 months (95% CI 2.2–3.9), P = 0.084] nor of ERCC5 [3.2 months (95% CI 2.3–4.1) vs 4.4 months (95% CI 1.4–7.4), P = 0.182] showed a significant association with PFS of trabectedin (Table S3).\n\nConsidering GMI values, grouped as GMI ≥ 1.33 vs GMI < 1.33, only six genes were differentially expressed with statistical significance between both groups (FDR < 0.05). Patients with a GMI ≥ 1.33 showed significantly higher expression of DNAJC16 (logFC = 1.163; FDR = 0.001), XPC (logFC = 0.799; FDR = 0.004), DNAJB14 (logFC = 0.611; FDR = 0.006), ATM (logFC = 0.523; FDR = 0.008), DNAJC7 (logFC = 0.684; FDR = 0.008), and NEIL2 (logFC = 0.564; FDR = 0.039), compared with those with a GMI < 1.33 (Table 4).\n\nDifferential gene expression reached statistical significance in 20 genes when it was considered obtaining or not clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD vs PD) (Table 5). High expression of PARP3 (logFC = 1.538; FDR = 0.007), POLL (logFC = 1.876; FDR = 0.007), RAD52 (logFC = 0.849; FDR = 0.009), TOP3B (logFC = 1.818; FDR = 0.009), XRCC5 (logFC = 1.073; FDR = 0.009), DNAJB14 (logFC = 0.463; FDR = 0.032), XPC (logFC = 0.559; FDR = 0.036), ATM (logFC = 0.383; FDR = 0.036), MSH5 (logFC = 0.843; FDR = 0.043), and NEIL2 (logFC = 0.467; FDR = 0.043) were associated with clinical benefit of trabectedin, whereas overexpression of RAD21 (logFC = −0.522; FDR = 0.007), MSH6 (logFC = −0.369: FDR = 0.009), DNAJB11 (logFC = −0.336; FDR = 0.011), TDG (logFC = −0.332; FDR = 0.024), XRCC4 (logFC = −0.394; FDR = 0.024), PARP1 (logFC = −0.373; FDR = 0.036), ERCC3 (logFC = −0.242; FDR = 0.036), PRKDC (logFC = −0.380; FDR = 0.043), RAD23B (logFC = −0.315; FDR = 0.043), and TOP3A (logFC = −0.423; FDR = 0.043) were associated with progressive disease after trabectedin. By contrast, no different gene expression was significantly detected, by FDR, when the grouping was responders (CR+PR) vs non-responders patients (Table S4).\n\nRegarding the different analyses performed, only three genes were significantly associated with a longer PFS (Table 3), GMI ≥ 1.33 (Table 4), and clinical benefit of trabectedin (Table 5): ATM, DNAJB14, and XPC (Fig. S2). Further, 14 significantly expressed genes were common for PFS and clinical benefit endpoints: ATM, DNAJB11, DNAJB14, PARP1, PARP3, POLL, PRKDC, RAD23B, RAD52, TDG, TOP3A, TOP3B, XPC, and XRCC5 (Fig. S2).\n\nDifferential gene expression was also determined according to clinical variables with an independent value for PFS in the multivariate analysis: Table S5 (L-sarcomas vs other subtypes) and Table S6 (visceral vs somatic location). PARP3 and PMS1, which were genes associated with a better PFS of trabectedin, were overexpressed in L-sarcomas and in tumors with a somatic location, whereas PARP1, a gene that correlated with worse PFS of trabectedin, was highly expressed in non-L-sarcomas and tumors with visceral location.\n\n3.5 Predictive gene signature of trabectedin activity\n\nUnivariate Cox regression model on a cohort of 139 patients identified eight genes whose expression was significantly associated with PFS of trabectedin. Further selection of genes whose Kaplan–Meier curves displayed significant differences (patients were divided into two groups based on gene expression median value) yielded six final genes. Lasso-penalized Cox regression analysis was performed to construct a predictive gene signature for trabectedin. The six genes identified were as follows: exonuclease 1 (EXO1), cyclin H (CCNH), xeroderma pigmentosum group A-complementing protein (XPA), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), BRCA1, and apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 2 (APEX2).\n\nThe six-gene-based risk score was calculated for each patient, and the optimal cutoff for the risk score (2.146) was determined. An additional univariate Cox regression analysis was performed using risk scores, resulting in a significant association with PFS (Table S7). Time-dependent ROC and Kaplan–Meier curves were used to assess the predictive value of the gene signature. The AUCs (area under the ROC curve) for 3-, 12-, and 24-month PFS were 0.67, 0.65, and 0.65, respectively (Fig. S3). Patients in the high-risk group (higher expression of EXO1, PARP1, BRCA1, and APEX2 and lower expression of CCNH and XPA) showed a significantly worse PFS compared with the patients in the low-risk group (lower expression of EXO1, PARP1, BRCA1, and APEX2 and higher expression of CCNH and XPA), [2.1 months (95% CI 1.8–2.4) vs 6.0 months (95% CI 4.5–7.5), P < 0.001 (Fig. 2)]. PFS rate at 6 months and at 12 months was 16% and 5%, respectively, for the high-risk group and 48% and 25%, respectively, for the low-risk group. In the multivariate analysis, the high-risk group was an independent factor associated with PFS [HR 2.1 (95% CI 1.4–3.2), P < 0.001]; visceral location and non-L-sarcomas maintained the independent value (Table S8).\n\nIn the patients treated with either doxorubicin or gemcitabine, the DDR-related gene signature was also correlated with the PFS of these drugs. The six-gene-based signature failed to significantly predict gemcitabine or doxorubicin activity, in terms of PFS, in our series (Table S9).\n\n4 Discussion\n\nA six-gene predictive signature of trabectedin efficacy was built based on the transcriptomic analysis of 118 DDR-related genes and PFS, in a retrospective series of 139 advanced STS patients. Previously described predictive genes for trabectedin efficacy, as those related to NER machinery, such as ERCC1 and ERCC5, did not show any relevant prognostic role in our series. Rather, other DDR-related genes showed more consistent prediction of trabectedin activity, either in terms of PFS, GMI, and/or clinical benefit. For this study, we decided to focus only in the relevance of DDR-related genes, since the DNA DSBs induced by trabectedin along with the involvement of NER machinery and HR repair genes were previously reported as a potential relevant mechanism of trabectedin activity in STS patients [[13, 15, 21]]. However, the majority of these studies were limited to few DDR-related genes/proteins as potential predictive biomarkers of trabectedin, in consequence many other potential predictive factors from the family of DNA repair genes have been unexplored in this regard. Hence, we aimed to evaluate, in a broader way, the predictive role of a large number of DDR-related genes using HTG EdgeSeq next-generation sequencing (NGS)-adapted molecular profiling. Subsequently, an established six-gene signature was able to markedly separate two significant different populations (favorable or unfavorable signature) for trabectedin efficacy in terms of PFS.\n\nEven when BRCA1 (expression levels or haplotype status) had been previously associated with the clinical benefit of trabectedin [[15, 21]], its predictive role was weaker than the gene signature. Overexpression of XPA gene, another component of the signature and a NER-associated gene, was in line with previous reports that showed a direct correlation between higher expression of NER machinery-related genes and better trabectedin efficacy [[22, 23]]. Besides, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the expression of EXO1, CCNH, and APEX2 had been associated with trabectedin efficacy. EXO1 is an XPG family nuclease that participates in several DDR pathways, such as DNA mismatch repair, HR, and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [[22]]. Of note, the expression of EXO1 was associated with resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin via NHEJ in ovarian cancer, a tumor also sensitive to trabectedin. Nevertheless, the prognostic/predictive value of EXO1 in STS is still unknown [[24, 25]]. Cyclin H, coded by the CCNH gene, is a protein that forms a cyclin-activating kinase-subcomplex with CDK7 and MAT1. This subcomplex is part of the transcription factor II human (TFIIH) protein complex and it is involved in NER, by regulating cell cycling progression during DNA damage [[26]]. As expected in accordance with the role of cyclin H in NER pathway, a high expression of this gene was associated with trabectedin sensitivity in our signature. APEX2 is a weak apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease in the DNA base excision repair pathway and functions in the context of DNA damage by oxidative and alkylating agents. APEX2 also exhibits strong activities of 3′–5′ exonuclease and 3′-phosphodiesterase and that has been described to be necessary for the recovery of B-cell lymphocyte progenitors after chemotherapy [[27, 28]]. Moreover, APEX2 has been identified as a synthetic lethal gene, in BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells [[29]]. APEX2 processes AP sites at replication forks, avoiding the blocking of fork progression and the induction of DSBs, which required BRCA1/2 for repair and DNA synthesis [[29]]. Of note, trabectedin has been described to cause replication impairment and genome instability, via RNA–DNA hybrid-dependent DNA damage, which is important for drug activity [[30]]. Accordingly, it is possible that APEX2 may have a role in resolving replication impairment and genome instability induced by trabectedin, which may justify its association with lack of drug activity in our gene signature. This could also open the option to target APEX2 as a potential therapeutic strategy in combination with trabectedin if this gene is overexpressed. Remarkably, our six-gene signature is in line with previous reports [[13, 15, 16]], wherein the high expression of NER genes (e.g., XPA and CCNH) and the low expression of HR genes (e.g., EXO1 and BRCA1) would help to identify the STS patients that benefit from trabectedin treatment.\n\nFurthermore, several DDR-related genes were significantly associated with trabectedin activity, in terms of PFS, GMI, and/or clinical benefit. Among these genes, PARP3 overexpression significantly associated with a better PFS and clinical benefit following trabectedin. PARP3, initially described in 1999 [[31]], is a poly(ADP ribosyl)transferase closely related with PARP1 and PARP2, and it is highly expressed in skeletal muscle [[32]]. PARP3 is involved in transcriptional silencing and in the maintenance of genomic integrity [[33]], being part of the polycomb group complexes, which are relevant to maintain the silencing of specific critical genes related to development among others. More precisely, PARP3 was shown to interact with core proteins of the polycomb repressive complexes 2 and 3, such as the methyltransferases EZH2 and Suz12, which are relevant in the maintenance of repression through post-translational methylation processes [[33]]. In turn, PARP1 expression, a gene also included in our potential predictive molecular signature, was significantly associated with shorter PFS and lack of clinical benefit after trabectedin treatment. The distinct behavior or PARP1 and PARP3 genes in our study may indicate that these proteins may participate differently in some cellular mechanisms, which could affect the response to trabectedin. Both proteins are relevant for DNA genomic integrity [[34]]; however, it seems that PARP1 overexpression promotes cell cycle entry [[35-37]], whereas PARP3 overexpression interferes with G1/S cell cycle progression [[38]]. Of note, G1 seems to be the cell cycle phase in which cells are more sensitive to trabectedin [[39]]. Accordingly, the effect of the overexpression of each one of these proteins in cell cycle progression may justify, at least in part, the different results for both PARP1 and PARP3 in our study. Noteworthy, PARP3 seems to be overexpressed in tumors that benefit from trabectedin treatment (i.e., L-sarcomas and tumors with somatic location), while PARP1 expression is higher in sarcomas with lower activity of trabectedin (non-L-sarcomas and tumors with visceral location). Therefore, the expression of these genes may be important biomarkers of trabectedin efficacy or resistance, in specific clinical contexts that depend on the histologic subtype or the location of the primary tumor. Besides, the association of PARP1 high expression with worse trabectedin outcome supports the combination of PARP1 inhibitors with this chemotherapeutic agent. In line with these observations, the combination of olaparib with trabectedin has been tested in a phase 1b clinical trial in patients with advanced and non-resectable bone and STS (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02398058). Of 50 patients recruited, 7 had a PR, suggesting that this combination has antitumor activity [[40]]; however, patient selection based on PARP1 and/or PARP3 expression levels should be considered for further clinical trials with this combination.\n\nIn the study presented here, only BRCA1 high expression was significantly associated with shorter PFS and OS, while ERCC1 and ERCC5 expression, which were previously associated with good prognosis to trabectedin [[13, 15, 16]], did not had a significant impact in survival. The different methodology used for gene expression analysis could justify the distinct results obtained in terms of survival observed for these two genes; however, it is important to mention that HTG quantitative nuclease protection assays for gene detections had been reported to have similar sensitivity as qPCR [[41, 42]]. Accordingly, our results may suggest that NER-associated genes ERCC1 and ERCC5 are not robust and reliable biomarkers of trabectedin activity. Their predictive value should accordingly be considered with caution; however, a further study with a larger cohort of cases should validate our data.\n\nAmong the study limitations, it is important to mention that the tumor samples used for this retrospective analysis were collected at the diagnostic time, and gene expression levels could have been altered due to the several lines of previous treatment or during the natural progression of the disease. Moreover, another important limitation is related with its initial hypothesis; for this analysis, only genes related with DDR were selected and studied. This selection excluded, from the molecular signature, genes involved in other cellular processes, which may also predict trabectedin activity. Since we cannot exclude the relevance of other genes beyond DDR, further analysis, considering all the genes included in the OBP assay, is currently ongoing. The absence of an independent validation cohort, or a control cohort treated with any other drug approved for advanced STS, is other limitation of this study. The validation of the predictive value of the gene-based signature in a larger series of cases could also help improve the performance of ROC curves."
