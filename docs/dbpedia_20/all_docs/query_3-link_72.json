        "text": "The way he tells the story, Bailey from Foolish Baseball was sitting on a sofa in his parents’ home, watching a movie, when he saw The Tweet. It deserves the capital letters because it wasn’t just any tweet. This tweet changed Bailey’s life.\n\nIt was 6:30 p.m. on Dec, 28, 2018. Bailey’s phone lit up with a Twitter notification. He swiped the screen, saw The Tweet and said, “No way!” That moment is a freeze frame in Bailey’s memory. It was a full house. His sisters were back from college for the holidays. The family was sprawled across the living room. And the movie, he remembers specifically, was “Black Panther.”\n\n“He wouldn’t want me to tell you this,” Bailey’s mother says now, dunking effortlessly on her 24-year-old son, “but the movie was Paddington 2.”\n\nMoms remember the darndest details. Bailey’s mom also recalls the “stunned and reverent silence” that followed when, in the middle of Paddington’s preposterous adventure, Bailey turned to her on the sofa, his eyes wide, and held out his phone. That’s when she saw The Tweet, too.\n\nAt the time, Bailey was a recent graduate living at his parents’ place, somewhere in the heart of Braves country, and wandering through the post-college haze. He was working weekends at a homeless shelter and spending his free time on his YouTube channel, Foolish Baseball. His Verlander video, a dissection of an “impossible inning” from 2012, had just the right launch angle. It took off. After Verlander’s tweet, Bailey’s channel surged from 800 subscribers to 6,000.\n\n“That’s when I realized, oh, I have something here,” says Bailey, who has since seen the Verlander video sail past a million views. “I’ve got to make more.”\n\nA year and a half later, Foolish Baseball is Bailey’s full-time job. The channel currently has more than 123,000 subscribers and 13.7 million total views. Bailey, who prefers not to publicly reveal his last name, has created 32 “Baseball Bits” video essays — peppered with sarcasm, video-game music and perfectly pixelated graphics — deifying Mike Trout, Willie Mays, Pedro Martinez, Ichiro, Andrelton Simmons (?), Jeff Mathis (??) and Tim Locastro (???).\n\nFoolish Baseball began in, of all places, Hamburg, Germany.\n\nBailey, having majored in history and German studies in college, spent a post-graduate year in Hamburg as part of an exchange program. He attended language school, audited university classes and filled volunteer hours by helping a couple of local baseball clubs. Bailey enjoyed the work so much that upon returning to the United States he wanted to find a job in baseball. But how?\n\nBailey had all the tools but wasn’t sure how to use them. As a self-described “nerdy fan who is on Fangraphs and Baseball Prospectus all day,” Bailey had a knack for numbers and a love for the beautiful absurdity of baseball. He read “Moneyball” when he was 12. In Hamburg, he dived into Out of the Park Baseball simulations and decided to upload them to YouTube. The channel needed a name. Bailey wanted one that fit the tone of his sabermetrically inclined content but also suggested that even he didn’t take it that seriously. He settled on Foolish Baseball, a spin on Keith Law’s book “Smart Baseball”.\n\nWhen he moved back to his parents’ house in the summer of 2018, Bailey worked as the weekend manager at a homeless shelter in his hometown and tried figuring out what was next. He thought about going to baseball’s winter meetings to find an internship. He thought about graduate school. And he thought about ways to get his YouTube channel off the ground.\n\nIn August 2018, Bailey pivoted from Out of the Park tutorials and posted his first “Baseball Bits” video. It was a breakdown of a play at the plate in the 19th inning of a 2011 Braves-Pirates game and a blown call by umpire Jerry Meals. Bailey, the Braves fan, had a different perspective. He titled the video: “The Worst Call in MLB History — Why It Might Have Been Correct”.\n\n“That got a few hundred views,” Bailey said, “and I was like, sick!”\n\nBailey had unwittingly hit on each of the elements that still make his “Baseball Bits” videos sing: an analytical angle, lo-fi design and a sharp sense of humor.\n\nThe design, Bailey says, started due to his artistic and technological limitations. But it laid the groundwork for the rest of the series. He had dabbled in graphic and web design, but his video-editing experience was mostly from creating soccer highlights or making the pregame hype video for his high school’s football team. “Baseball Bits” had a distinctive design language from the jump.\n\n“If you can mute the video, watch it without my voice and still know who it’s from, that’s a good thing on YouTube,” Bailey says.\n\nAmong Bailey’s simple animations, the sprites stand above the rest. They are delightful, bobbing to the Pokémon music in the background. To make them, Bailey finds a player’s headshot and shrinks it to 60 by 60 pixels in Photoshop. Then he takes samples of the team colors and skin tones and traces over the image. It’s trickier for older players, Bailey says, because their headshots are harder to find. When Bailey wanted to make a Mark Belanger sprite, he found a photo of Belanger’s son, who is a spitting image of him. He traced the son’s face, popped an Orioles hat on top and — voila! — Mark Belanger.\n\nSarcasm is a key ingredient in the “Baseball Bits” recipe, and that edge is due in part to the fact Bailey’s gateway to YouTube years ago was sketch comedy — channels like Balloon Shop and Good Neighbor. In college, Bailey did open-mic nights and had a sports radio show. “The kid is a talker,” his mom says. “Always has been.” And since baseball analytics can be dry, humor adds spice.\n\n“If every joke doesn’t land, that’s fine,” Bailey says. “But if it keeps people engaged and thinking, What’s he going to say next? then that works for me. Also, I think baseball is a funny sport. So to talk about baseball without trying to be humorous about it is a fool’s errand in the first place.”\n\nBut “Baseball Bits” wouldn’t work without smart analysis. The basis for the series was that Bailey couldn’t find baseball content he would watch. “It just didn’t exist on YouTube,” he says. He saw a chasm between what the analytics-heavy articles he devoured on baseball blogs and what he saw on YouTube. So, Bailey shaped his video essays to bridge that separation, making analytics accessible to the average fan by blending information and entertainment.\n\n“People that watch sports on YouTube are probably not on the blogs,” Bailey says. “I’m on the blogs all day, but they are not.”\n\nFrom that perspective sprang surprisingly sabermetric yet wildly enjoyable essays: Why Statcast sprint speed data tells us Tim Locastro should be your favorite player and Albert Pujols might be too slow for baseball; how catcher framing adds value for atrocious hitter Jeff Mathis; combining old footage and modern positional tracking to grade Willie Mays’ famous catch, and using defensive metrics to argue that Andrelton Simmons is a future Hall of Famer.\n\n“If you can use analytics to build players up, that makes (viewers) much more likely to accept them than if you start tearing down their heroes,” Bailey says. “You thought this guy was good. But the numbers say he’s historically great.”\n\nIn early March, Bailey branched out. He swung by five spring training camps in Florida — Twins, Rays, Pirates, Tigers and his family’s beloved Braves — and interviewed players at each stop. It was a step toward a new type of content for Foolish Baseball, but it also meant stepping in front of the camera for the first time. At one of the spring training stops, a fan recognized Bailey.\n\n“Hey,” the guy said, “you’re Foolish Baseball!”\n\nBailey was a bit stunned.\n\n“That,” he says, “was very strange to me.”\n\nIn an era when Major League Baseball is desperate to attract younger fans, YouTube creators can play an important role in bringing attention to baseball. That much was made clear with the explosion of Jimmy “Jomboy” O’Brien, whose brilliant video breakdowns made him flash famous in baseball circles this past year. Jomboy now has 550,000 subscribers on YouTube.\n\n“What’s cool is that the different YouTube channels are geared toward different types of fans,” Bailey says. “The type of fans that might be attracted to baseball through a Jomboy video might not be interested in what I do. But vice versa. I’m attracting a lot of nerds, for no other way of putting it.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to overrate my importance to the scene. I think that’s a mistake that a lot of YouTubers make. They look at the numbers on the screen, and that gives them a sense of self-importance that maybe is a little bit unfounded. I get a lot of comments that say, ‘Hey, I was a more casual baseball fan and now you’ve made me a hardcore fan.’ I think that’s where I come in.”\n\nWhile Jomboy has expanded into a full-fledged media company, Bailey is content for now as an independent creator. A few months after the Verlander video, Bailey left his job at the homeless shelter and moved into an apartment. He started receiving sponsorships requests, partnering first with SeatGeek and then with The Athletic this past offseason. At some point, he sat down with his parents to explain Google AdSense, Patreon and YouTube’s algorithm. (His parents tried explaining all of this to his grandparents, and, well, it was like teaching them a foreign language. What about benefits? A retirement plan?)\n\n“Bless his patient heart,” Bailey’s mother says. “He pulled out the spreadsheet like three times and talked me through it.”\n\nBailey expects he’ll eventually loosen some of his privacy restrictions, but for now his family is sworn to secrecy, too. If people ask about Bailey, his parents say something like, “He provides baseball content. He has a YouTube channel.” By now, Bailey’s job is a poorly kept secret among their friends and friends.\n\n“Of anybody in the family, I’m probably going to be the biggest braggart,” Bailey’s dad says. “His mom is much more respectful. His sisters don’t care. But I’m the one who wants to broadcast it over every social media platform.”\n\n“I sit in places and hope that people bring it up,” Bailey’s mom adds, laughing. “But I have promised that I will not be the one that (starts the conversation). It’s been fun to have a front-row seat to watch this turn from what was a cool and quirky hobby into something that’s something else entirely.”\n\nAs for what’s next, with baseball back in business, Bailey wants to blend interviews into his “Baseball Bits” videos, hearing from the player he’s featuring. He posts a new video about once every two weeks, and in the meantime, he’s active on Twitter, where he has more than 30,000 followers. This isn’t the baseball job Bailey left Germany to find. It just might be a better one.\n\n“22-year-old Bailey wasn’t aware this type of career was a possibility,” he says.\n\nAs Foolish Baseball grows, Bailey has more and more requests pour in from viewers. He has a very clear stance about this: He doesn’t take requests. Foolish essay premises come from his curiosity and analytical deep dives on Fangraphs, Baseball Prospectus and Baseball Savant. For the most part, fans of the channel seem to respect Bailey’s position. They stop sending requests.\n\nAll except for one.\n\n“His mom’s hounding him to do one on Greg Maddux,” Bailey’s dad says.\n\n“I pitch that after each video,” his mom says. “I say, ‘OK. That was great. But when is Greg Maddux?’ I won’t be happy until we get a Greg Maddux video.”\n\n(Top illustration: Courtesy of Bailey from Foolish Baseball)"
