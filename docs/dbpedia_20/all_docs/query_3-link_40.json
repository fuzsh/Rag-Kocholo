From its inception, the Foundation has been independent, hence it operates under a financial model of self-funding.\n\nFor this to be successful, the Foundation relies on the contributions and donations of individual shareholders and corporate entities, as well as the fees of the numerous different types of members and partners.\n\nLa The Foundation is a not-for-profit organization, and therefore its operations, structure, and financial framework is in accordance with the “Ley 05/2001” laid out on the 2nd May by the Private Foundations of Catalonia.\n\nRegistered office\n\nThe RCD Espanyol Foundation is registered at the RCDE Stadium, Av. Baix Llobregat, 100 de Cornellà de Llobregat."
