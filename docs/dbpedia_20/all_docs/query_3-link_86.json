        "text": "Abstract The aim of this study was to analyze histological changes in the liver and to determine the role of Alanine Aminotransferase activity (ALT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as biochemical markers of impaired liver function. In order to evaluate the correlation between serum ALT activity, serum CRP and degree of inflammatory activity in the liver, we examined 37 liver biopsy specimens from young adult patients with chronic hepatitis C. Serum CRP levels and ALT activity were determined at the time of liver biopsy in all patients. The activity of ALT correlated with the grade of liver disease (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.378) and macrovesicular steatosis (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.498). We didn’t found any correlation between serum CRP levels and activity and stage of liver disease. This results suggest that ALT activity, in opposition to serum CRP concentration, is a suitable biochemical marker of progression of liver disease in chronic hepatitis C. The Annals of Diagnostic Paediatric Pathology is an international peer−reviewed journal. The focus of the journal is current progress in clinical paediatric pathology in both basic and clinical applications. Experimental studies and clinical trials are accepted for publication, as are case reports supported by literature review. The main policy of the Annals is to publish papers that present practical knowledge that can be applied by clinicians. © © C Co op py yr ri ig gh ht t b by y P Po ol li is sh h P Pa ae ed di ia at tr ri ic c P Pa at th ho ol lo og gy y S So oc ci ie et ty y I IS SS SN N 1 14 42 27 7-4 44 42 26 6 General Send three copies of the manuscript written in English and three full sets of illustrations (two sets suitable for review and one for publication), with a cover letter, including the complete name, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and e-mail address of the communicating author, and a statement that all authors have approved the manuscript, addressed to: Abstract and key words. An abstract of not more than 250 words should begin on page 2. It should be a factual, not descriptive, statement of study objectives, methods, principal results, and conclusions. Use Index Medicus terms from medical subject headings where possible. For the purpose of coding and subject indexing provide up to six key words in alphabetical order immediately following the abstract. Text. The text should be organized into an introductory section, including the background and purpose of the study, and then into sections titled \" Methods \" , \" Results \" and \" Discussion \". In certain circumstances the nature of the report does not lend itself to this format. Underline any words or phrases to be emphasized by italics. Acknowledgments. Grant support and individuals who were of direct help in the reported work should be acknowledged by a brief statement on a separate page immediately following the text."
