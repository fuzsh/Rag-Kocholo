It has been called “An Unexpected Wine Sanctuary in Baja California” by the New York Times and “The Napa of Mexico” by Forbes. Many world renown Chefs have made a name for themselves and have developed the cuisine we know as Baja Med. Valle de Guadalupe has more than 200 wineries producing world recognize wines. Located 20 kilometers of Ensenada Municipality, Baja California, and (70 mi) southeast of the border crossing from San Diego.\n\nEnsenada is a port city on the Pacific coast of Mexico’s Baja California peninsula. At its heart is the harbor and waterfront area with the Malecón promenade. Once a casino, the Riviera de Ensenada is now a cultural center. Migrating gray whales visit the waters offshore. Ensenada is developing scientific research and natural science sectors, with special focus in the marine sciences sectors. Ensenada is claimed to be the city with the highest number of scientists per capita in Latin America. The Center of Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE) conducts research in Earth Sciences, Applied Physics, Oceanography, Communications and Experimental and Applied Biology. Further research is conducted on the campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California, Ensenada (UABC), mainly in Oceanography and education areas although there are groups in Physics, Biology, and other related sciences. Ensenada is the biggest port in the pacific of the northwest in Mexico exporting more than 90 species of fish that are commercially fished in Ensenada; the most important fisheries are tuna, shrimp, California spiny lobster, abalone, sea urchin, sardine, mackerel and seaweed. A large percentage of all catches are exported to East Asia.\n\nThink Mexico, think beer, and the names are easy to recall, Corona, Pacifico, Tecate with a number of darker brews. But Baja California is poised right on the edge of being well known for its microbrewers and they are springing up all over the city of Ensenada producing some of the best beers in Mexico.\n\nIn summary Ensenada, and Valle de Guadalupe are sure to be a foodie’s perfect destination.\n\nHistory\n\nThe community was founded in 1834 by Dominican missionary Félix Caballero as Misión de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe del Norte, making it the last mission established in the California’s. Caballero had to abandon the mission in 1840, under attacks from the indigenous people.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1910, a mixture of Spiritual Christian faiths, mostly Pryguny from Transcaucasia, South Russia, settled in 4 farming colonies near Ensenada, Baja California Norte Territory, Mexico. Guadalupe was the main colony of about 20+ square miles purchased in 1905. Most owned or rented land communally. Not all were ethnic Russians, and were of various folk-Protestant (non-Orthodox) faiths. A few Russian Orthodox immigrants, had no priest or church, lived in Ensenada.\n\nTo make land and loan payments, paid in wheat, the settlers rented as much as 50 square miles from about 10 nearby ranches, north to the border. Most moved to California Norte by World War II to join more prosperous relatives and work in the factories. Some intermarried with Spiritual Christian Dukh-i-zhizniki in California Norte. Most of who remained, intermarried, assimilated and live in Ensenada and Tijuana.\n\nWe have prepared a 5-day experience that will allow you to truly enjoy and taste the Flavors of Valle de Guadalupe and Ensenada.\n\nThis is an overview of what so far has been planned:\n\nApril 24, 2022\n\nEveryone will fly in and meet in the beautiful city of San Diego.\n\nSan Diego Hotel Check In (1 night) (Transportation on own)\n\nWelcome Dinner prepared by Chef Luisteen Gonzalez in one of his restaurants “Puesto”,\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nBreakfast\n\nTransportation depart to Valle de Guadalupe (international border crossing San Diego-Tijuana)\n\nVisit at Olibaja.
