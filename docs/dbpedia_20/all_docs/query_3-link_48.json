        "text": "Try Scorer Vilimoni Waqatabu Delasau (Fiji)\n\nWales 34 Fiji 38\n\nRugby World Cup 2007\n\nStade de La Beaujoire Nantes\n\nITV Commentary Martin Gillingham\n\n“These two teams have met on 8 previous occasions Wales have won all 8 but the last one was very tight indeed 11-10 it was a couple of years ago in Cardiff,q and here’s another chance Fiji really on the ramapage Delasau there looked like a knock on but he’s got another crack at it Delasau it’s a foot race does he get the bounce he does”.\n\nI think I should explain the title of this chapter. Firstly declaring October as mid summer is stretching artistic license to its limits, also, sadly this was not a dream but more like a nightmare and one that occurs fairly regularly for us masochists that follow Welsh rugby.\n\nThe title came to me over an early morning coffee and I was so ridiculously pleased with myself that I couldn’t bear to change it.\n\nThere are two certainties in life, death and taxes, actually make that three, Wales drawing Fiji in any Rugby World Cup tournament pool is another cast-iron certainty.\n\nIf you are Welsh or of a nervous disposition, or even both, please look away now.\n\nThere are people in Llanelli still receiving counselling as a result of the affects of the match that took place on French Atlantic coast.\n\nThis game in Nantes was a riot of rampant rugby and the flying Fijian winger set it alight\n\nIn the final pool game, already having an early try under their belt, Fiji chose to attack from a scrum inside their own twenty-two.\n\nSeru Rabeni produced a magical offload behind his back to midfield partner Seremaia Bai who in turn passed out of the tackle to Vilimoni Delasau, with the winger hacking on despite the ball going to ground.\n\nSeemingly overcrowded out on the touchline, Delasau chipped forward before towering above the covering defenders to collect an impossibly high bounce and touch down to complete a remarkable solo effort.\n\nFiji would eventually go on to win a thrilling game 38-34 thanks to a last-minute pick and drive by second row Graham Dewes and earn a first quarter-final appearance since 1987.\n\nHowever, it was Delasau’s sensational score for which one of the most entertaining games the World Cup has ever seen will always be remembered.\n\nAs Fiji headed to Marseille for a semi final showdown with South Africa Wales headed to the airport but not before sacking coach Gareth Jenkins in the hotel car park.\n\nA late try from Graham Dewes saw Fiji dump Wales out of the World Cup and get a quarter-final against South Africa.\n\nWales’ open style played into Fiji’s hands, big hits and strong running leading to tries from Akapusi Qera, VilimoniDelasau and Kele Leawere.\n\nAlix Popham, Shane Williams, Gareth Thomas and Mark Jones brought Wales back, and Martyn Williams’ 73rd-minute interception try looked the clincher.\n\nBut the islanders rallied, Dewes bullying over from short\n\nIt was Fiji’s first win in nine games against Wales and sees them advance to their first quarter-final since 1987.\n\nWith a record of six wins from 20 games in charge of Wales, coach Gareth Jenkins’ position will now come under serious question.\n\nHis side had aimed to banish their slow-starting blues at the Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes, and in the first minute a superb Stephen Jones break deep in his own half should have led to a try.\n\nJones found the supporting Tom Shanklin, but he delayed his pass to a free Mark Jones, allowing the defence to rally.\n\nStephen Jones put Wales ahead with a penalty and Chris Horsman and Gethin Jenkins had Fiji under pressure at the scrum, but Jones missed with a straightforward kick and Wales continued to spurn overlaps.\n\nSeru Rabeni had already made his mark on Shanklin and Thomas with trademark hits, and another on James Hook in midfield forced a turnover.\n\nThe islanders attacked quickly with a flowing move, the ball coming to Gloucester flanker Qera who stormed over from close range.\n\nWith confidence flying, Nicky Little and Rabeni attacked from their own 22.\n\nThe ball fell to Delasau, who chipped over the top of the defence, a wicked bounce flying over Mark Jones’ head and collected his own kick for the second try.\n\nLittle added two penalties, before a dynamic Qera break from his own 22 ended with Kele Leawere barging over for the third try from close range.\n\nA panicked Wales spurned penalties in front of goal, and were finally rewarded in the 34th minute as a five-metre scrum was walked over for Popham’s try.\n\nFiji relished Wales’ desperate, expansive style, but their discipline fractured with a late hit from Leawere on Popham.\n\nQera was then yellow-carded for aiming a knee into Stephen Jones’ chest on the stroke of half-time, but Hook missed the resultant penalty from in front of the posts.\n\nWales pounced on 14-man Fiji after the break, and after a Martyn Williams turnover in his own 22 Shane Williams danced inside from the wing with a superbly balanced run, beating three defenders and crossing under the posts.\n\nA fine three-quarter move from an attacking scrum saw Hook free Mark Jones with an inside pass.\n\nThe wing found Gareth Thomas, who celebrated becoming the first Welshman to 100 caps by taking his record try tally to 40.\n\nWilliams thought he had sealed the win for Wales\n\nDwayne Peel found acres of space from a line-out to spark the next try, accurate passing along the line sending Mark Jones in at the corner and regaining the lead for Wales, Stephen Jones’ conversion making it 29-25.\n\nThe outsiders found their second wind with some thrilling attacking rugby, two Little penalties putting them back in front going into the final quarter.\n\nWales wheeled on the replacements, but needed a desperate, brave tackle from Thomas on his own line to deny SeremaiaBai a try.\n\nAs Fiji went for the kill, Little floated out a needless pass – and Martyn Williams plucked the ball out of the air for a 65mrun-in.\n\nBut the islanders regrouped once more and, when Delasau was held out inches short, Dewes picked up to cross for a try awarded by the video referee, sealing the biggest upset of the 2007 World Cup.\n\nIt was Wales’ third south sea island embarrassment in World Cups following defeats to the Samoans in 1991 and 1999\n\nWales (10) 34\n\nTries:

He played 17 times for Fiji between 1998 and 2005 and also scored 85 tries for Fiji sevens, but that sunny day in Nantes he lit up the Rugby World Cup.\n\nOn December 10 1988, Wales faced Romania at Cardiff Arms Park, in what appeared, on the face of it, to be an ordinary run of the mill international rugby union match.\n\nBut on a bright winter’s day in the Welsh capital, events unfolded that triggered the onset of the biggest Welsh exodus to rugby league of all time.\n\nA young and highly talented Wales team was about to be ripped apart, and a generation that had given us glimpses of some wonderful rugby, and more importantly, hope for the days ahead, were about to be lost to our friends in the North.\n\nThe band played the wrong Romanian national anthem before kick off, which was perhaps an omen, and things were about to get a whole lot worse.\n\nThe Wales team that day had a few new faces, but on paper looked a side strong enough to see off a Romanian team that could be best described as solid and workmanlike.\n\n15 Tony Clement (Swansea)\n\n14 Glen Webbe (Bridgend)\n\n13 Mike Hall (Bridgend & Cambridge University)\n\n12 John Devereux (Bridgend)\n\n11 Richard Diplock (Bridgend)\n\n10 Jonathan Davies (Llanelli) Captain\n\n9 Robert Jones (Swansea)\n\n1 Mike Griffiths (Bridgend)\n\n2 Ian Watkins (Ebbw Vale)\n\n3 Dai Young (Cardiff)\n\n4 John Wakeford (South Wales Police)\n\n5 Kevin Moseley (Pontypool)\n\n6 Richie Collins (Cardiff)\n\n8 Phil Davies (Llanelli)\n\n7 David Bryant (Bridgend)\n\n16 Paul Thorburn (Neath)\n\n17 Bleddyn Bowen\n\n18 Jonathan Griffiths (Llanelli)\n\n19 Hugh Williams-Jones\n\n20 Kevin Phillips (Neath)\n\n21 Rowland Phillips (Neath)\n\nWales lost 15-9 to Romania, in front of 19,000 fans at Cardiff Arms Park, and apart from a classy John Devereux try, and five points from the boot of Paul Thorburn, who came off the bench as a replacement winger, there was very little to shout about.\n\nAs is often the case in Wales, it was one of the nation’s greatest players who was chosen to be the sacrificial lamb, to bear the brunt of the criticism and rancour in the aftermath of the defeat.\n\nTrimsaran is a Carmarthenshire village that grew up around the coal industry, these days the magnificent Ffos Las racecourse has transformed the place, and although horse racing is relatively new to the area, Trimsaran knows a thing or two about producing thoroughbreds, it is the birthplace of Jonathan Davies one of the greatest talents Welsh rugby has ever produced.\n\nJiffy wanted a debrief with the Welsh Rugby Union, following the disastrous summer tour to New Zealand, where they lost two tests to New Zealand 52-3 and 54-9, however he was given short shrift, and his desire to get this talented team back on track was sneered at by many.\n\nJonathan was captain against Romania, and he took the defeat hard and personally. It seems unbelievable, but he actually feared for his place in the team.\n\nWith a young family to support, along with the uncertainty surrounding his union international future, he signed for Widnes Rugby League team a few weeks after the defeat.\n\nThe same critics that had castigated him days earlier, were now mourning his passing, and beginning to realise what a massive loss he would be to the Welsh team.\n\nJiffy’s wonderful career in league would be a constant sobering reminder to those that did very little to encourage him to stay.\n\nI don’t think anyone, at the time, had an idea of what was to follow, and the large casualty count of players that would be lost to the 13 man game.\n\nThat Wales rugby Union team of 1998 had only months earlier won a Triple Crown, for the first time for nine years, and shared the Five Nations Championship title with France.\n\nThey played a scintillating attacking brand of rugby, and Jiffy at fly half was the orchestrator.\n\nAgainst England at Twickenham Wales had four fly halves in the back line, Tony Clement, Bleddyn Bowen, Mark Ring and Jonathan himself. Adrian Hadley, who was to sign for Widnes, scored two tries that day as Wales ran England ragged.\n\nOn a bright sunny day at HQ Wales were irrepressible, Jonathan Davies, despite a heavily strapped ankle, tormented England flanker Mickey Skinner like a matador wielding his cape around an aged bull.\n\nVictory at home to Scotland included Ieuan Evans “Merlin the magician” try, Wales clawed back a 20-10 deficit to seal the game with two Jonathan Davies drop goals, and won a scintillating contest 25-20.\n\nA gutsy away win in gusty Dublin, 12-9, in a tough narrow contest, included a Paul Moriarty try, and was sealed with Jiffy’s signature finale, a drop goal.\n\nThe win gave Wales their first Triple Crown since 1979, and set them up for Grand Slam showdown in rain drenched Cardiff, a match that ended in the narrowest of defeats for the men in red, by a single point 10-9.\n\nThere was disappointment in the loss, but also for the first time since the magnificent 1970’s, there was a realisation that Wales had a team with the potential, and the talent, to set the rugby world alight.\n\nA ridiculously scheduled tour to New Zealand, described by former Wales captain Dai Young as “the tour of death”, was the beginning of the end for this talented group of players.\n\nIt was absolutely brutal, young Wales flanker David Bryant was the victim of such ferocious rucking the scars on his back didn’t heal for a year.\n\nBryant made his Wales debut in the opening Test, in which Wales were crushed 52-3.\n\n“Painful would be the word I would use to describe it. My lasting memory of the tour was I would come off at the end of the game, and they would take out the stitches I’d had the week before and put stitches in new wounds. I had 28 stitches in the head during the course of that tour.\n\nThe team suffered badly from injuries and had to call up six extra players during the course of the tour. Original tour captain Bleddyn Bowen broke his wrist in the second game and was replaced as skipper by Bob Norster, until he suffered a badly gashed knee, whereupon Jonathan Davies took over the captaincy.\n\nEven All Blacks coach, Alex “Grizz” Wylie was horrified at the schedule the Welsh Rugby Union had agreed to. He went on record as saying he would never have excepted such a fixture for his team.\n\nThe stuffing was well and truly knocked out of a young Welsh side, but that should have been just one of the up’s and down’s that occur in the development of every great side.\n\nThe Welsh Rugby Union’s decision to sack Tony Grey and Derek Quinnell, the coaches, was a massive over reaction, and it lit the blue touch paper for the decline that was about to follow.\n\nJohn Devereux, in an interview with Wales Online said: “We lost a generation, the 1988 tour did the damage. We were building something but that tour tore down all the good work that had been done by Tony Gray and forwards coach Derek Quinnell.\n\n“It was absolutely ridiculous decision, the worst ever, to sack Tony and Derek after it, because they had learned so much from being in New Zealand and knew what they had to do, who knows what would have happened had they stayed as coaches? Maybe players wouldn’t have gone to rugby league.”\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the boys of 98 were something very special, it still rankles with me to this very day that the Welsh Rugby Union robbed us all of the pleasure of watching this team progress, to have them taken away from us piece by piece, player by player, was heartbreaking.\n\nThe relationship between league and union had always been a fractious one, to the extent that it was questionable whether there was a relationship at all.\n\nCheque books and Rolls Royce’s would glide southwards into the valley towns and the West Wales countryside in the dead of night, to entice their prey away from the amateur game, (as union was pre 1995), and for rugby men with families to support, the offers from the northern men in suits were often just too good to turn down.\n\nUnion viewed league with great suspicion, anyone associated with the professional game was persona non grata at every rugby union clubhouse and playing field. Union players suffered life long bans for simply attending a rugby league trial.\n\nIn 1947 George Parsons was picked to play for Wales against France in Paris. He got on the train at Newport but was thrown off due to an allegation of him speaking to a rugby league scout.\n\nWidnes coach Doug Laughton, the man who signed Jiffy, turned up at the Gnoll on a scouting mission to watch the then Wales wing Elgan Rees play.\n\nAn enraged Neath committee man stormed over to Laughton and told him, “You can get out of here and you can take the big thug you’ve brought with you”.\n\nThat big thug was none other than Big Jim Mills. Laughton replied “I’ll go but only after you’ve told him (Mills) to leave”.\n\nI would hazard a guess that the committee man found discretion to be the better part of valor, but the story is an example of how things were between the two codes.\n\nEvery Welsh rugby union generation was resigned to losing a player or two to league, it was the way of the world back then.\n\nTerry Price and David Watkins the architects of Wales 1965 Triple Crown went North\n\nThe 1969 Triple Crown and championship winning team lost Maurice Richards and Keith Jarrett.\n\nEven the golden generation of 1970’s were not spared, John Bevan, Roy Mathias, Stuart Gallagher and Clive Griffiths followed that well trodden path up country\n\nThe list of those great Welsh players who headed to Lancashire and Yorkshire is a who’s who of outstanding talent. Lewis Jones, Billy Boston, John Mantle, John Warlow, Colin Dixon, Clive Sullivan, Terry Holmes, Kel Coslett, Jim Mills, the list seems endless.\n\nJiffy’s success in league gave us all a Jekyll and Hyde sensation, there was huge delight at watching him reach his sporting peak as his genius matured and flourished, but also a hollow empty feeling of what could have been with Wales and the Lions, and when you read the list of those who followed in Jonathan Davies footsteps, you truly realise the extent of Wales’ loss.\n\nHe was presented as a Widnes player on 7 January 1989 after signing for a reported fee of £230,000.\n\nContrary to popular belief it was Adrian Hadley, and not Jonathan Davies who was the first of the Wales 1988 stars to switch to league, signing with Salford for a £100,000 fee, which was a record at the time .\n\nWidnes and Warrington took the lions share of the union emigrees as 13 players left Wales for pastures new.\n\nIt was September 1988 when Adrian Hadley left Cardiff and his job with the Inland Revenue in Llanishen for the much more taxing role with Salford. Four months later Jiffy’s move to Widnes opened the flood gates.\n\nIn April 1989 Moriarty followed the path trodden by Holmes. Paul Moriarty signed for Widnes.\n\nThe following month Llanelli scrum half and fireman, Jonathan Griffiths joined St Helens.\n\nJohn Devereux the wonderfully talented Wales and British Lions centre increased the ever growing Welsh contingent at Widnes when he arrived at the club in October 1989.\n\nIf the Union game in Wales was hoping for a respite when 1990 dawned they couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nAs Valentine’s Day approached prop and cornerstone of the Welsh pack Dai Young moved from Cardiff to Leeds.\n\nLate summer saw a further drain of union talent when Rowland Phillips and Allan Bateman both signed for Warrington in the September of 1990, Mark Jones joined them from Neath at the Wilderspool a month later.\n\nThere was a bit of lull in the exodus before Swansea, Wales and British Lions flanker Richard Webster signed for Salford in September 1993.\n\nThe effect on the union team was there for all to see, Wales were bottom of the 5 Nations Championship five times out of the next seven years.\n\nWhen Wales recovered in 1993/94 and won the 5 Nations championship under the captaincy of Ieuan Evans, two further massive body blows scuppered any opportunity to build on that success when two of the stars of that team in time honoured tradition headed north.\n\nScott Gibbs joined St Helens in April 1994 and five months later Scott Quinnell who was proving to be a revelation for Llanelli and Wales joined Wigan in a deal worth £400,000 over four years. Quinnell’s loss was the hardest to come to terms with as he was the cornerstone of Wales hopes for the future, a massive ball carrier with great hands and at 22 years of age we had not even begun to see the best of him.\n\nBob Norster, the Wales team manager at the time said in his typical understated style ” I cannot pretend it’s anything less than a significant loss for us”.\n\nWe, the fans, still worshiped our heroes from afar, and even got the odd glimpse of their playing talents, albeit very rarely.\n\nThe Rugby League Challenge Cup Final at Wembley, every May, was always broadcast live on Grandstand, and invariably there would be one or two of our old flames featuring. The same could be said when Great Britain hosted Australia, or other Southern Hemisphere opposition, that too was an opportunity to look closely at the team sheets to see which Welshmen might be on display.\n\nIn our dreams we longed to be given the opportunity to see these boys back on the green green grass of home, playing league, union or even tiddlywinks, but we knew in reality that, despite our fervent hopes, the chances of it happening were very slim.\n\nBut then the year of 1995 dawned and all that was about to change.\n\n1995 turned out to be one of the most memorable years in the history of rugby, for Union and league, things would never be the same again.\n\nOn 27 August 1995 Vernon Pugh QC announced that rugby union would become professional, and as a result the rugby road that had been heading North for generations, turned into a one way system with all the traffic heading south.\n\nThe irony in all this is the fact that in 1995 the Wales international rugby league team had the greatest year in their history.\n\nThey won a European Championship, and reached the semi finals of the Rugby League World Cup, but much more than that they captured hearts and minds back home in a rugby union stronghold.\n\nFor once, it didn’t matter a jot whether it was league or union, it was just rugby and it was Jiffy, Devs, The Clamp, Moriarty, Gibbs, Quinnell and co, wonderful players who set the pulses racing, who put their bodies on the line for Cymru. We rediscovered the lost generation, and we all welcomed them with open arms and open hearts.\n\nIn April 1995 the band Take That had a number one hit with “Back for good”, maybe Gary Barlow knew something we didn’t, because in October of that year the pied piper Jonathan Davies, whose move to Widnes started the exodus, began the flood returning back for good from league to union when he signed for Cardiff.\n\nI am actually beginning to wonder if Gary Barlow is in fact a rugby mystic as his further compositions “Everything Changes” and “Never Forget” could well be the perfect soundtrack for that memorable year.\n\nA litre of petrol cost 60p, in Wales and the average house price was £45,335 in 1995, John Major was Prime Minster, and perhaps even more staggering than the Wales rugby union departures, OJ Simpson was found not guilty of murder.\n\nWales played 7 internationals in 1995, winning 6 and losing just one, the one defeat being that memorable World Cup semi final against England at Old Trafford.\n\nThey won the European Championship, after victories over England and France, played two internationals in the USA, and reached the semi final of The Halifax Centenary Rugby League World Cup.\n\nA regulation change in 1995 was the catalyst that set this team on the road to greatness Wales already had a back line to die for but were a bit short in the grunt and grind department. The change allowed players to qualify to play for Wales through their grandparents nationality. This opened the door to bolster the Welsh pack and set the Red Dragons on to great things.\n\nWales international Rugby League season began on 1 February and ended on 21 October.\n\nDuring those 8 months the Welsh team had the time of their lives.\n\n1 February\n\nWales 34 England 14 Ninian Park Cardiff\n\n4 March\n\nFrance 10 Wales 22 Carcassonne\n\n11 June\n\nUSA 10 Wales 66 Philadelphia\n\n18 June\n\nUSA 4 Wales 92 Philadelphia\n\n9 October\n\nWales 28 France 6 Ninian Park Cardiff\n\n15 October\n\nWales 22 Western Samoa 10 Vetch Field Swansea\n\n21 October\n\nEngland 25 Wales 10 Old Trafford Manchester\n\nIn the 7 international matches played, Wales scored 44 tries, with 17 different players touching down.\n\nIestyn Harris 6 Tries\n\nAnthony Sullivan 4\n\nKieron Cunningham 4\n\nAdrian Hadley 4\n\nGareth Davies 4\n\nScott Quinnell 3\n\nRowland Phillips 3\n\nMark Jones 3\n\nKevin Ellis 3\n\nAllan Bateman 2\n\nJason Lee 2\n\nJohn Devereux\n\nDave Williams\n\nIan Watson\n\nGavin Price-Jones\n\nPaul Atcheson\n\nMark Sheals\n\nWales were also fortunate to have some superb kickers at their disposal. Jonathan Davies kicked 17 goals, Iestyn Harris, 12 and perhaps a less likely but talented kicker Adrian Hadley kicked 8.\n\nJonathan Davies the master of the drop goal also landed 2 of his delicacies in 1995.\n\nThe cold statistics are impressive, but this group was about more than fact and figures.\n\nThese boys had come home and you could sense their undiluted joy at being able to play on their fields, in their country, in front of their people, 1995 was a very special year indeed.\n\nAn exclusive extract from my book The Bleus Brothers. Chapter 2 features Guilhem Guirado\n\nIt is midnight in Saint-Denis, and Guilhem Guirado the France captain is still doing the media rounds. He is muddied, bruised and exhausted after the opening game of the 2019 Guinness Six Nations Championship.\n\nNine o’clock kick-offs may be good news for the home supporters who can indulge in a leisurely dinner pre-match but for players it is the final knockings of a very long day.\n\nAs Friday night nudges into Saturday morning, Guilhem can finally grab a shower. After the endless rounds of media commitments, it is time to start the long process of unwinding. Many more hours will pass before he can finally get the kind of sleep a warrior deserves, although sleep may be in short supply after the extraordinary events that have unfolded on the field of play.\n\nThe dark streets of Saint-Denis are illuminated by neon hotel signs, and the dimly-lit bars are nearly empty as the last train takes supporters back to Gare du Nord and central Paris.\n\nAn uneasy quiet descends on the Stade de France, the moonlight reflecting in the icy puddles as the shutters on the food outlets come echoing to a close in the Parisian night with the final Espresso dispensed.\n\nOn a bitterly cold night, the warm red shirts of Wales created a comeback that would have defied Lazarus as they turned around a 0-16 deficit at half-time, to score three second-half tries and earn a 24-19 victory.\n\nIt was Wales’ biggest ever half-time turnaround in a Five or Six Nations match, and the haunted look and sheer desolation on the French faces at full time was painful to see.\n\nEven with Jefferson Poirot in the front row it is difficult to fathom the mystery of how France let such a big lead slip. What might Poirot the detective have said? “There is nothing more amazing than the extraordinary sanity of the insane! Unless it is the extraordinary eccentricity of the sane!”\n\nSelecting the hooker position for this French Hard Men XV was one of the decisions I struggled with the most.\n\nFirstly, by definition, you don’t get a hooker who isn’t hard; when you are dangling in a scrum between two brutes with your arms trapped and head-to-head with the opposition, witty repartee is not going to help you very much.\n\nSecondly, France has had such an embarras de richesses of ‘talloneurs’ – Paco, Dubroca, Szarzewski and Ibanez to name but a few.\n\nI’m sure many will question my choice of Guilhem Guirado as hooker. The numéro deux shirt has been worn by so many wonderful hard men that I really was spoilt for choice. But hardness comes in many different forms and Guilhem Guirado had a mental and physical hardness that very few could match.\n\nHe virtually carried the national team at one of the most disappointing periods in its history, but as hooker and captain, Guilhem never let his personal standards or his level of performance drop for one second which is more than can be said for some of his colleagues in the blue jersey.\n\nGuirado was like a one-man battering ram, running himself into the ground, not only doing all the donkey work expected of a hooker but also becoming a major try scorer.\n\nIn the 2018 autumn internationals, he scored in all three matches of the series against South Africa, Argentina and Fiji, and ended up as France’s top try scorer of the campaign with four.\n\nIn total he scored eight tries for his country, four of which came during the fourteen-day period of those 2018 autumn matches.\n\nA Twitter debate perfectly summed up Guilhem’s situation. The question was asked: “Which player from another Six Nations team would you select for your own country?”\n\nThe overwhelming majority of people voted for Guirado. One user replied: “I would pick Guilhem Guirado just so that he doesn’t have to suffer through playing for France anymore!”\n\nGuilhem was a warrior; he put his body on the line time and time again and he never flinched. At the end of every international, the television cameras would pan in on him in painful close-up as he stared wide eyed with despair. Sometimes you got the impression, rightly or wrongly, that he was the only one that cared.\n\nWhen France lost to Ireland 13-15 at Stade de France in February 2018, Guirado made 31 tackles, a Six Nations record that he jointly holds with Luke Charteris of Wales.\n\nHis durability was incredible. For someone who was always the first to put his body on the line, he had very few absences with injury. When Guilhem went down in a match he would invariably bounce back up and if he stayed down then you knew it was something serious.\n\nArles-sur-Tech is a tiny village, set in a scenic forested valley in the eastern foothills of the Pyrenees, a place where Catalan and French are spoken.\n\nIt is less than one hour’s drive from the Spanish border, a journey that has a major relevance to one of its inhabitants, Guilhem Guirado.\n\nIn stature and appearance, he is exactly how you would imagine a French hooker to look. At 5ft 11ins and 15 stone 8lbs, he is as tough and solid as the local Pyrenean boulders on the field but has the calm, whispering qualities of the meandering Tech river off it.\n\nHe is a private man who puts his love of his family above all else. His grandparents were among the half a million Spanish citizens who fled the violence of the Spanish Civil War and crossed the Pyrenees with the sole aim of finding safety and refuge in France. The exodus was the biggest single influx of refugees ever known in France and was named “La Retirada”, the Spanish for retreat.\n\nGuilhem’s parents were born in Granada. They were both five-year-olds when they arrived in France following that arduous journey with almost nothing to their name.\n\nHe says: “Until I was 15 all I knew was this village where my grandparents had arrived, my favourite memories are from here. I loved being that age; it is here everything really started for me and I found a passion for rugby.”\n\nGuilhem is a man who knows where he is and more importantly where he has come from.\n\nI first met him at the RBS Six Nations launch in 2016 after he had just been announced as the new France captain. He stood out as a man at peace with himself, taking everything in his stride in a calm and measured manner.\n\nThe lovely thing about Guilhem is that the moment he sees you he immediately shows you the latest photos of his children on his mobile phone. We have been through quite a few Six Nations launches and mixed zones together and he is always the same, win or lose.\n\n“To know where you want to go, you need to know about where you came from, and the determination that went before” he says philosophically. When you delve into his family history you get a sense of where that inner strength has come from.\n\n“What I like about rugby is the direct confrontation with an opponent, a physical contest and collisions, tackles.”\n\nBut when he gets home, he puts his bag down and rugby is done and dusted.\n\n“The most important thing for me is my family and the people who are around me, whether they be my parents, grandparents, wife son or daughter.”\n\n“It’s my stability, it’s something that allows me to put things into perspective and to be able to relax and see life in a different way. I’m not only thinking about rugby and that allows me to perform well on the field.”\n\nThe French region of Pyréneés-Orientales was ceded to France by Spain in the seventeenth century.\n\nThis beautiful place, nestled between the Pyrenees mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, is part of Northern Catalonia, also known as French Catalonia.\n\nPerpignan accounts for over a quarter of the population of Northern Catalonia and is the heartbeat of Catalan culture and gastronomy. You will certainly find more red and yellow horizontally striped flags here than Tricolores.\n\nWhile Catalonia is the richest part of Spain, French Catalonia is one of the poorest regions of France.\n\nGuirado is a proud Catalan and to play for USAP was his boyhood dream.\n\nTo play for Union Sportive des Arlequins Perpignanais to give them their full title is a local aspiration akin to the boys on the Copacabana wanting to play for Brazil. For Guilhem it was no different.\n\n“My first game for Perpignan was on 8th August 2006 in a local derby against Narbonne. I remember we played three matches in nine days. I arrived at the club aged 14. I never imagined playing for the first team. By just playing for the juniors, I felt I had reached my pinnacle.”\n\nHe broke his leg at the age of 15, an injury which should have been resolved in a few months but in this instance Guilhem was out of action for over a year.\n\n“I watched my first Perpignan match in May 1998 and my whole life has flowed from it. I always wanted to outdo myself for the club for which I had such a wonderful attachment” says Guirado.\n\nHis final match for USAP ended in a heartbreaking defeat to Clermont, a result that confirmed their relegation to the second division, the ProD2.\n\n“I used that awful feeling to motivate me throughout my career” he says. But there were also some wonderful moments at a club where you sense Guilhem’s Catalan heart still beats strongly.\n\n“Two of my greatest rugby moments were the 2019 Top 14 Final win with USAP and the European Cup quarter final against Toulon which was played at Montjuïc in Barcelona. It was a wonderful Catalan occasion played in front of a packed crowd in the Olympic Stadium and a win for us 29-26.”\n\nAfter nine years, 202 matches and 20 tries at Perpignan, he moved 381 kilometers along the coast to Toulon and became part of the star-studded team that won the European Cup at Twickenham on 2nd May 2015 when they beat Clermont 24-18.\n\nLeigh Halfpenny, Juan Martín Hernández, Drew Mitchell, Juan Smith and Bakkies Botha all played for Toulon that day.\n\nGuirado’s playing career has included Perpignan, Toulon and Montpellier along with an international career that ended in the land of the rising scrum on 20th October 2019 when France were defeated in the Rugby World Cup quarter final by Wales.\n\n“My first memory is the first time I played rugby; it was with all my friends in Arles-sur-Tech and the most beautiful thing is we all got to know each other on the rugby field and today we are still sharing our lives and great moments together.”\n\n“I have been lucky to be able to play for my club that made me dream when I was a kid, the Perpignan team USAP, and finally to be able to play with France a few years later and then to play with Toulon and Montpellier with the best players in the oval world.”\n\nHe won his first international cap for France on 9th March 2008, replacing Dimitri Szarzewski and coming off the bench against Italy at the Stade de France in a 25-13 victory. “I remember my first cap, a special taste, I remember it like it was yesterday.”\n\n“It was a great pride, a huge honour for all that it means for me and for France.”\n\nGuilhem never took for granted the responsibility and honour of putting on the French jersey.\n\n“I think it’s always an honour to play for and represent France, everything goes more quickly, and it is a bit stressful because of the fear of not being up to the mark. You want your family to be proud of you.”\n\n“I like to know what has happened in the past and immerse myself in it because I also have to represent all the former players. There have been some huge players and great hookers who have gone before me.”\n\n“For me this shirt really represents the welcome given to the Spanish exiles. I am French. I grew up in France; it is a country that was ready to give a welcome to my grandparents so of course I think of them.”\n\nGuirado had to battle for a starting place in the French team with William Servat and Szarzewski, two very talented hookers. But he eventually got his first start in the 2010 November international against Fiji.\n\nJacques Brunel, who had worked with Guilhem at Perpignan, became French coach after the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and he named Guirado as his captain for the 2016 Six Nations. His debut as skipper came against Italy at Stade de France, a match that took on an important significance after Paris had suffered several terrorist atrocities during the latter part of 2015.\n\nThere was a nervous eerie build-up to the game, and to see so many armed police and military personnel at a rugby match made for an unusual experience. But on a mild sunny day in the French capital, the national anthem was sung with even more emotion than usual and you could feel the crowd relax as the match progressed.\n\nThe whole occasion, and a win for Les Bleus, brought a much-needed smile to a city that had suffered so much.\n\nFrance won 23-21 through tries by Vakatawa, Chouly and Bonneval although the joy was very nearly curtailed at the very end of the match when a Sergio Parisse drop goal attempt drifted wide.\n\n“In my first match as captain everything went very fast” he says. “Meeting new staff and new players meant an awful lot of pressure.”\n\nGuirado went on to captain France on 33 occasions, winning 12, losing 20 and drawing one.\n\nOn captaincy, he says: “I don’t have a specific style; it is mainly a feeling, a lot of conversations and a lot of questioning and the captain is nothing without the players around him.”\n\nThe Bleus Brothers is available via the link below from Amazon priced £7.99 with free postage\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B45DXBJD"
