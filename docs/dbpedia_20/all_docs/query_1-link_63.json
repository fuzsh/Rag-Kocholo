Montserrat Gudiol began in the world of art in the family studio for the restoration of medieval paintings, and from 1950 she began to paint. That same year she made her solo debut, and only four years later she held her first solo exhibition abroad at the Miami Museum. Since then he has exhibited all over the world. She has been awarded the first Ynglada Guillot prize and the Sant Jordi Cross. She is represented in the MACBA in Barcelona, and in other museums in Madrid, Bilbao, Johannesburg, Flint and Montreal. In 1981 she was the first woman to join the Royal Catalan Academy of Fine Arts of Sant Jordi. Antoni Taulé began his artistic career in the mid-1960s, when he began to devote himself to painting and performing in various public spaces in Sabadell. It was in the 1970s that Taulé devoted himself entirely to painting, characterised by the hyperrealism of his scenes. In them he depicts both the exterior of buildings and classical and modern interiors, a fact that can be explained by his training as an architect. He also painted self-portraits as well as portraits of his relatives and Parisian characters, Paris being the place where he trained and worked in the studio of the renowned Gallic architect Le Corbusier. The artist crossed national borders, acquiring great fame both in Paris and Tokyo, taking part in numerous exhibitions and having his work in important collections, such as those of the Centre National d'Art Contemporain (Paris), the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, the Hastings Foundation in New York and the Can Framis Museum (the latest project of the Fundació Vila Casas in Barcelona).\n\nSetdart Auction House"
