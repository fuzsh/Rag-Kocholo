        "text": "There’s no use in denying the aural ancestry behind the name Lucy Wainwright Roche.\n\nShe’s the daughter of Loudon Wainwright III and Suzzy Roche (of The Roches), not to mention the half-sibling of Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright, so it’s safe to say she flourishes from her folk-friendly family. Lucy has released two albums with her mother Suzzy and one with her half-sister Martha, but she’s also made quite a name for herself with her own solo singer-songwriter career.\n\nIn just a few days, Lucy Wainwright Roche releases her first solo album in five years and third solo album overall, Little Beast. The thirteen songs on Little Beast fuse everything Lucy has learned about folk over the years and you can hear it in its entirety this Friday. Lucy Wainwright Roche stops by the Paramount next Thursday, but for now here’s one of the album’s two lead singles, “Soft Line”!\n\n–Jack Anderson"
