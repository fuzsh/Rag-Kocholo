On a conference call from New York with half-sister Martha Wainwright in Montreal, the extent to which the two had grown up in parallel universes was hitting home more than ever before.\n\nThe women — along with Martha’s brother Rufus — share a wayward father, Loudon Wainwright III. Martha was born in New York in 1976 and raised with Rufus in Montreal by their mother, Kate, member of iconic folk duo Kate and Anna McGarrigle, a.k.a. the McGarrigle sisters. Lucy was born in New York in 1981 and raised by her mom, Suzzy Roche, one-third of folk sister trio the Roches.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nMartha Wainwright and Lucy Wainwright Roche pick up family torch in the Wainwright Sisters Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

Speaking about it now, gosh, that is really weird! It never occurred to me until today.”\n\nIt’s about to get weirder. The two have picked up the torch, forming their own sibling act, the Wainwright Sisters. Their debut album of twisted lullabies, Songs in the Dark, is due on Friday, Nov. 13, followed by a performance at the Phi Centre on Tuesday, Dec. 1.\n\nHearing Lucy talk about her childhood, it is hard not to think that her words could just as easily be coming out of her half-sister’s mouth.\n\n“My dad wasn’t in the house really past the time I was two,” she said. “So it was me and my mom, then there was my mom and her sisters on tour, making records and stuff. We definitely share that common background, growing up with moms and aunts.\n\n“Music was just everywhere: coming home from school, rehearsing; on weekends we would go do shows. It’s similar to how I observe it with Martha’s kids. In this business, kids are around (music) and learn to be around it. It’s all they’ve known.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nShe followed in her mom’s footsteps, releasing her solo debut, Lucy, in 2010.\n\nGrowing up in different cities, Lucy and Martha saw each other sporadically over the years. “We spent parts of summers together, and holidays,” Martha said. “We would see each other four or five times a year, but they were very powerful reunions. We’re sisters, so it was a special occasion because we didn’t always get to see each other. I came down to New York more than she came to Montreal, so I knew her mom better than she knew mine.”\n\nWhile there was always a connection between the two, it was after the death of Kate McGarrigle, in January 2010, that they really became close. The birth of Martha and husband/bandmate Brad Albetta’s first child, Arcangelo, just before Kate’s passing heightened the emotional whirlwind and found Martha looking for support.\n\n“I really leaned on Lucy a lot,” she said. “I really needed her help. She’s great with kids in general, and mine in particular.” (Martha’s second son, Francis Valentine, was born last year.)\n\nLucy had been coming up to Quebec regularly to visit — both in Montreal and at the McGarrigle family’s longtime home in St-Sauveur — so it was only a matter of time before collaborative sparks began to fly.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhen Arcangelo was born, Martha compiled a mix CD of lullabies, including many her mother had sung to her when she was a child. Following Francis Valentine’s arrival, she found herself looking back to that mix, which became the starting point for the Wainwright Sisters’ debut.\n\n“A lot of songs on that CD, five or six of them, are on the album,” she said. “A lot of those songs are about sadness, or have a darkness to them; that became the theme to this record. I asked Lucy to find other songs in that vein — songs that relate to lullabies, for children but essentially bleak in some way.”\n\nIt makes for an intriguing selection of songs, gently swaying on the surface but loaded with prickly lyrics underneath. The Jimmie Rogers-penned opener Prairie Lullaby is marked by haunting harmonies, while Woody Guthrie’s Hobo’s Lullaby broaches homelessness and trouble with police. Loudon Wainwright’s wry Lullaby opens with the line “Shut up and go to bed”; Kate and Anna McGarrigle’s Lullaby for a Doll reflects on “life and all its mysteries”; Terre Roche’s Runs in the Family talks of the problems passed down through generations; and the traditional song Long Lankin is about a monstrous man hanged for murdering an infant (surely sung with a wink to Anna McGarrigle’s husband, former Montreal Gazette film critic Dane Lanken).\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut while these descriptions may sound sinister, the songs are no more so than many popular nursery rhymes and children’s fables, Martha argued, and they may even open up some pertinent conversation topics.\n\n“Kids wind up talking about death,” she said. “When my (first) child was born, my mother died; so obviously he talks about death. Death used to play a bigger part in children’s lives, because more people died (young). Kids went to open-casket wakes and played with dolls that had coffins; it was a way to teach kids about things that would happen in their lifetime and explain the harsh realities of life.\n\n“My intention is not to freak people out. I’ve tried this album with my own kids at nighttime, and it’s soothing — it’s not an annoying kids’ record. It seems to have a mantra-like vibe that calms kids. My son is kind of a kooky guy, so he loves the song about throwing away kids (Rosalie Sorrels’s playfully swaying Baby Rocking Medley). It goes, ‘This is the day we give babies away / with a half a pound of tea,’ and he thinks it’s funny. It doesn’t scare him. … It’s not about the lyrics, it’s about the vibe.”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe album was recorded swiftly and without fuss, over a few sessions in a cottage-turned-studio in St-Sauveur.\n\n“C’est un tout petit chalet,” Martha said. “My grandfather built the house, and on (the property) are four little chalets he built in the ’40s.”\n\nAlbetta served as recording engineer and producer, while the sisters pumped out the tunes in short order.\n\n“We would get together and learn five or six songs on guitar,” Martha said. “We would give ourselves two hours, because we’re completely lazy.”\n\nThe Wainwright Sisters see many similarities between their project and their mothers’ groups, but also differences. At the top of the latter list is the fact that, as opposed to being all-consuming, their partnership is purely for fun.\n\n“I don’t think we put the same pressures on each other,” Lucy said.\n\n“No,” Martha chimed in. “Kate and Anna were always together, musically. They wrote songs together about their lives — that was really intense. And the Roches practised a gazillion hours a day, which Lucy and I have certainly never done. There’s much more lightness (to this).”\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMartha is halfway through recording her fourth album, which should arrive sometime next year and includes her own compositions plus contributions from an eclectic crew including Rufus, British songbird Beth Orton, Toronto author Michael Ondaatje, electro artist Tune-Yards and Irish singer-songwriter Glen Hansard.\n\nIn addition to their show at the Phi Centre, Martha and Lucy will share the stage at the Maison symphonique, Dec. 5 and 6, as part of the renamed Rufus and Martha Wainwright’s Noël Nights — an annual holiday celebration formerly held under the McGarrigle banner.\n\n“(We had to change the name) because we can’t get Anna to f—ing commit,” Martha joked. “She always says, ‘I’m not going to do it,’ then she’s in the corner with an accordion drawing all the attention because she’s so talented.”\n\nAnd if that’s not enough extended family shenanigans for you, that old rascal Loudon will perform at the Christmas shows, and has hinted to his daughters that he may come up a few days early to catch their Wainwright Sisters concert. It’s only appropriate, according to Martha, given that he is the link connecting her and Lucy in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“It’s like (being in) an animal tribe or something,” she said. “The male procreates around, then women fight it out and the children all get along. It’s a bit like being a gorilla. I feel very close to my animal self right now.”\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nSongs in the Dark is released on Friday, Nov. 13. The Wainwright Sisters perform Tuesday, Dec. 1 at the Phi Centre, 407 St-Pierre St. Tickets cost $16.25, available at phi-centre.com.\n\nRufus and Martha Wainwright’s Noël Nights takes place Saturday, Dec. 5 and Sunday, Dec. 6 at the Maison symphonique, with performances by Lucy Wainwright Roche, Anna McGarrigle, Loudon Wainwright III, Emmylou Harris, Robert Charlebois, Jorane, Kid Koala, Daniel Bélanger (Dec. 5) and Louis-Jean Cormier (Dec. 6). All profits go to the Kate McGarrigle Fund, which supports cancer research and teaching at McGill. Tickets cost $73.98 to $139.22, available at placedesarts.com.\n\ntdunlevy@montrealgazette.com\n\ntwitter.com/tchadunlevy\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
