        "text": "THE EVERLY BROTHERS: Songs Our Daddy Taught Us (Ace)\n\nA record that my mother played for me and my brother Rufus. It marked the beginning of my love for country music.\n\nHearing the two voices blending and moving freely between melody and harmony was a genuine revelation.\n\nLOU REED AND JOHN CALE: Songs For Drella (Warner)\n\nThis is dedicated to Andy Warhol and was my first introduction to a concept record. The lyrics really affected me and when Lou Reed died I played it a lot.\n\nPRINCE: Purple Rain (Warner)\n\nPrince’s ability to mix so many genres and his fusing of white and black music is remarkable. He is one of the most intriguing artists ever. This was the soundtrack to my youth.\n\nTHE STAPLE SINGERS: City In The Sky (Stax)\n\nThis group made gospel music accessible. Normally I wouldn’t listen to music with a message but the album is done in such an artistic way and Mavis Staples’s low voice with that full-on abandon is amazing.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And when I saw the repartee that Cohen had with his backing singers, I wanted to be one.\n\nLater his daughter said I should have been but by then I was making my own records.\n\nKATE & ANNA McGARRIGLE: Heartbeats Accelerating (Private Music)\n\nThis was my mum and aunt’s comeback record in 1990 after bringing up their children. I loved the mood of it and that it’s about becoming middle-aged, which is moving"
