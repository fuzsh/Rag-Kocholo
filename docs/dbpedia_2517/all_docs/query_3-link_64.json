        "text": "1.\n\nMiddle of the Lake 03:36\n\nI was never alone in the middle of the lake, I was always outside of my mind And I never dreamed a dream I liked And in the common rooms I cried In Rock & Roll there’s a mighty long fall, there’s a mighty loud call I live my life in the middle of the night, my breath goes up and down counting time By the light of day I fade away And in the commons rooms I cry And Rock & Roll you call my name, you call me to the stage where I sing my little songs of love and pain, winds of change, or simply singing, I’m singing in the rain. You make it worth living this terrible life I was burnt by the sun, frozen in ice I was dead on arrival, missing in action, living a fraction And in the common rooms the toil takes it toll And Rock &Roll can you save my life? Can you make me live forever? Save my life. I sing my songs of love and pain, winds of change or simply singing, I’m singing in the rain.\n\n2.\n\nGetting Older 04:14\n\nI’m getting older, I need your shoulder I need your love and I need your blood I want your honey, I’ll take your money I’ll pay you back, I’ll get the cash. With you my life has begun. I was on the run. We’ve got the time its take to burn out the sun and the hearts desperately undone. I’ve been so afraid. My body’s burnt and laid out on a table at my wake. And the radio’s on It’s playing my song it’s the one that will take us to the end if we defend our love and our souls we mend. Can you hear my words? Can you feel my worth? Can you read my mind and share the rest of time? I was making my own bed, I was picturing my death I was lost in a fire and you saved me with your desire. Can you hear me now? It’s time to take a bow out of this last life born of sacrifice.\n\n3.\n\nLove Will Be Reborn 04:20\n\nI cried only one tear for us today and i will wipe it away before the day breaks and there is love in every part of me I know but the key has fallen deep into the snow so when the spring comes I will find it and unlock my heart to unwind it and love will be reborn and love will be reborn I take the throne and throw away the crown and weave flowers in my hair from all around and the injustices I’ve heard I will swallow and reform the words to birds to undo the sorrow and love will be reborn and love will be reborn Can you hear my heart? It’s calling out your name Can you hear my heart? It’s dying in your flame the city is gone it’s gone it’s no longer there, the walls have fallen down every where and love will be reborn From the ruins there will come a new moon a new born sun (son) we’ll drink the dew from the flowers hands and ride on winged back to the new land and love will be reborn\n\n4.\n\nBeing Right 04:36\n\nI woke up with every good intention I wanted to be a star I wanted to light up the night and drink water from a reservoir It’s a minecraft to living this life and it’s hard not to be alarmed I woke up in a situation I should have done some meditation instead I took your medication and walked over to the police station I want to do right. I want to re-love tonight Being right is not worth it and I see the light on the curtains in the dark There’s a peace-train pulling in the station I finally got me a reservation I’m one breath away from killing you. I want to re-love, re-love I want to do right tonight Being right is not worth it and I see the the light on the curtains in the dark Call me, call me Victoria tonight Call me, call me Gloria for the last time\n\n5.\n\nReport Card 06:06\n\nBaby I was there for every second, I made your little bed, I washed your little head, I made what you were fed but now I walk the empty floors, looking through these empty drawers and everybody knows it’s you I’m looking for If I knew then what I know now then love would not have lived and I could have gotten out. Bring me your report card I want to read it again while I put you empty clothes into an empty bin I can hardly make it through my gin without crying a river and wanted it to end. Jesus is love. Sent from above . But I like the wine and love making passes the time but it ain't you-your little hands, your precious eyes, your growing feet, feeling’ the heat, walking away from me It ain’t me my baby love that conjures up above and captures the secret stone that makes everybody love and I hope you don’t miss me as much as I miss you, cause my heart is always broken and I don’t you to feel the way I do. We’re born and we die alone but until then I want you home and every night you’ll be be under the stars with me. If I seem sad, it’s because I am. Bring me your report card I wanna read it again while I put your empty clothes into and empty bin I can hardy make it through my gin without crying a river and wanting it to end.\n\n6.\n\nBody and Soul 05:16\n\nRun into the chapel, light up every candle, I fall to my knees I say “God please”, what can I do? 90 seconds later, both hands round my neck I plead “Oh Man take your hands off”, what can I do? I’ve got an 800 number I like to call, I’ve got an 800 number I like to call they ask me if you caused the fall Instead I tell them my dream You’re lying, you’re crying I’m holding your hand but I want to let go but you’re dying, I’m screaming. My fingers are slipping oh I want to let go- for my Body and Soul for my Body and Soul 90 days later, run into the castle I grab what I can-I take the can, I take the kids shoes. I’m living the blues I changed my locks, I changed my number. I’m living in a slumber. I started smoking again. I had another dream We’re kissing, we’re touching, I’m touching you you’re touching me oh but I’m bleeding, oh and I’m bruising my fingers are slipping, I want to let go for my Body and Soul my Body and Soul Don’t fuck with my kids you can take my money you can take my house you can take my honey your angry inch packs a mighty punch I got my Body and Soul I got my Body and Soul.\n\n7.\n\nHole In My Heart 03:44\n\nmy eyes were in the dark when i saw you and yours were shining like stars when i saw you we were both a little drunk when i saw you and there were holes in heart when i saw you the doors were all locked when i saw you and the curtains were drawn down when i i was living alone we all live alone i was hitting a wall when i saw you and you were living in the park when i saw you i got naked right away when i saw you and my love was like the rain when saw you. your hands were in your pockets when i saw you and i emptied out my locket when i saw you i was living alone we all live alone do you want to live alone together? do you want alone with me? i put my cards on the table so i could have you so you could lick my wounds and i’ll be your fool now i’m picking up fallen birds from the trees like a queen you give me love (fit me like a glove) on your knees all these honeysuckle trees they make me believe in everything endless dreams of love sing me like a dove, ring me like a bell, play me like a drum crazy love crazy in love.\n\n8.\n\nJustice 04:39\n\nCan you hear me calling from across the room like love birds sing in June like church bells ring at noon. I guess I’m wondering if love can conquer all, if it will catch me when i fall and carry me through the halls of Justice where are you? I’m waiting I was torn and taken away from the light stripped of my human right both hands bound I couldn’t fight when the judges javelin (gavel) fall on my head and my heart a terrible choir will start and carry me through the streets to Justice where are you? I’m waiting you’ll find in the Garden of Eden I’m not sinning, I’m just singing where are you my love? I was almost broken but there is new blood running in my veins I will capture and take the reins and ride on chariots of fire to Justice where are you? I’m waiting you’ll find me in the Garden of Eden. I’m not sinning, I’m just singing where are you?\n\n9.\n\nSometimes 04:10\n\nSometimes every once in a while there’s a vision I want to appear Sometimes every once in a while there’s a sound I want to hear. I know, every once in a while I feel the things I fear sometimes every once in a while you are not near I know I’ll never believe in you again like I never touched your skin like my voice was a little too thin like my love was not that strong How long does this go on? Sometimes every once in a while I get the feeling that I just don’t care Sometimes every once in a while there’s love in the air I know every once in a while you’re bound to break my back but sometimes every once in a while I’ve learned to fight back I know I’ll never believe in you again like i never touched your skin like my voice was a little too thin like my love was always wrong How long does this go on? My love is not easy, it’s like a child, it’s mean and wild. but you break my heart -tearing it apart How long does this go on…\n\n10.\n\nRainbow 04:42\n\nWhy can’t I be a rainbow? And live only for seconds and die forever young. Why do I have to go on? For the the kids and the neighbors, for love and for song. You’ve got me running around loosing ground changing towns like a clown I was kicked I was kicked to the ground Stop playing me like play doh. why don’t you move back to Mars take my car it’s been paid for. I’ve been working hard at changing the stars, I have altered my own ego. Stop bringing me down can’t you hear the sound of angels calling, angels singing Why can’t I be a river? And run forever and empty my heart and my head into the sea (see) me for who I am not the tricks that you play or the grandstand. You’ve got me running around loosing ground changing towns like a clown I was kicked I was kicked to the ground oh yeah. Stop playing me like play doh. why don’t you move back to Mars take my car it’s been paid for. I’ve been working hard at changing up the stars I have altered my own ego. Stop bringing me down can’t you hear the sound of angels singing? The seeds have all been sown I’m growing up to be famous everybody knows from your head to your toes that your shameless you can rain on my parade it’s been rain on for decades stop bringing me down can’t you hear the sound of angels singing?\n\n11.\n\nFalaise de Malaise 03:24\n\nTu n’avais aucun remords seulement le besoin de mon corps. si jamais t’était pour me dire tu ne souffriras pas mon sourire. on n’aurait jamais du s’installer dans l’autre mais ma chaire a vite devenue la votre. C’est ma ville mais c’est ton style de m’arracher les droits et de changer les lois. Come on tell me that you love it was late at night when we fight et que ma vie soit vide, ce remplis de fourmis qui me poursuivent dans la nuit It was crazy in the dark and there were lots and lots of sparks. Des caillots de malheur dans mes veines, du sang dans la laine, des scènes figées dans la peine tire les canons, déchire les chaines. l’orage de toi et moi va être spactaculaire comme les feux d’artifice dans les aires mais ceux qui éclatent a l’intérieur vont bruler now yeux et voler new voeux. Come on tell me that you love it was late at night when we fight et que ma vie soit remplit de fourmis qui me pursuivent dans la nuit je grimpe les falaise de malaise dans la nuit remplit de pluie, remplie la nuit tire les canons, déchire les chaines, rempli mes veines de haine.\n\n12.\n\nThanksgiving 05:01\n\nLord every year we gather here To eat around this table Give us the strength to stomach as much As fast as we are able Bless this food to our use Though communication's useless Don't let me drink too much wine Lord you know how I get ruthless Let us somehow get through this meal Without that bad old feeling With history and memory And home cooking we're dealing Remind us that we are all grown up Adults, no longer children Now it's our kids that spill the milk And our turn to want to kill them I look around and recognize A sister and a brother We rarely see our parents now We hardly see each other On this auspicious occasion This special family dinner If I argue with a loved one, Lord Please make me... The winner All this food looks and smells so good But I can hardly taste it The sense of something has been lost There's no way to replace it After the meal, switch on the game There's just a few more seconds But I'm so tired, I need a nap The guest bedroom bed beckons I fall asleep, I have a dream In it is the family Nothing bad has happened yet And everyone is happy Mother and Father, both still young And naturally they love us We're all lying on a lawn at night Watching the stars above us Lord every year we gather here To eat around this table Give us the strength to stomach as much As fast as we are able\n\n13.\n\nDinner At Eight 04:10\n\nNo matter how strong I'm going to take you down with one little stone I'm going to break you down and see what you're worth What you're really worth to me Dinner at eight was okay before the toasts full of gleams It was great until those old magazines Got us started up again Actually it was probably me again But why is it so That I've always been the one who must go That I've always been the one told to flee When in fact you were the one Long ago, actually in the drifting white snow Who left me? So put up your fists and I'll put up mine No running away from the scene of the crime God's chosen a place Somewhere near the end of the world Somewhere near the end of our lives But till then no daddy don't be surprised If I want to see the tears in your eyes Then I know it had to be Long ago, actually in the drifting white snow You loved me\n\n14.\n\nTell My Sister 04:06\n\nWeather man on the radio Threatens rain, maybe snow he don't know, I need blue skies I've got to go I'm not a cowboy I've never been shot I'm not a convict I've never been caught Tell my sister To tell my mother I'm coming home Home, alone Sunday morning I boarded a plane Leaving London, England In the rain Tell my sister To tell my mother I'm coming home Home, alone Someday I'll be back again To that green and pleasant land Between the Channel and the sea Across the ocean, that's where I want to be But until then, tie me to the ground I've got to let these weary bones rest From runnin' around Tell my sister To tell my mother I'm coming home Home, alone\n\n15.\n\nI cried only one tear for us today and i will wipe it away before the day breaks and there is love in every part of me I know but the key has fallen deep into the snow so when the spring comes I will find it and unlock my heart to unwind it and love will be reborn and love will be reborn I take the throne and throw away the crown and weave flowers in my hair from all around and the injustices I’ve heard I will swallow and reform the words to birds to undo the sorrow and love will be reborn and love will be reborn Can you hear my heart? It’s calling out your name Can you hear my heart? It’s dying in your flame the city is gone it’s gone it’s no longer there, the walls have fallen down every where and love will be reborn From the ruins there will come a new moon a new born sun (son) we’ll drink the dew from the flowers hands and ride on winged back to the new land and love will be reborn\n\n16.\n\nGo Leave 03:54"
