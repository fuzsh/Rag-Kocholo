        "text": "The Wainwright Sisters release their anticipated new album 'Songs In The Dark'.\n\nAlthough they're sisters, Martha Wainwright and Lucy Wainwright Roche didn't grow up together. Aside from genetics, their true bond was a musical one, both growing up in families steeped in songwriting. Both their mothers would sing them lullabies (Kate McGarrigle to Martha and Suzzy Roche to Lucy) - to honour that, 30 years later, Martha and Lucy are singing many of these same songs, some penned by their mothers and father (Loudon Wainwright III) on 'Songs In The Dark'.\n\nThe record also includes songs that shaped their childhoods, made famous by the likes of Woody Guthrie and Jimmie Rogers. When Martha and Lucy grew up and become songwriters of their own, they discovered their physical separation was trumped by their shared musical DNA. On 'Songs In The Dark', this is captured in its elemental essence: dark, mysterious, and beautiful.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's Eric Danton said the sisters' voices, specifically on 'El Condor Pasa', interlock \"so tightly it feels instinctual.\"\n\nA special album - highly recommended\n\nNovember 2015"
