        "text": "The legendary mother-daughter duo returns to The Parkway!\n\nA rare Minneapolis appearance by internationally renowned singer/songwriters Suzzy Roche (The Roches) & Lucy Wainwright Roche, in support of their critically acclaimed 2020 album release, I Can Still Hear You.\n\nNamed 'one of the year's best' by Americana Highways, Folk Alley called it \"an album for our times. Every song shimmers with perfection, even as it reminds us of the ragged ways that we love and the misery and loss of the days in which we find ourselves.\"\n\nThe Chicago Tribute recently raved, \"Their voices intertwined in gorgeous union…mother and daughter had the room in the palms of their talented hands. This was a glittering gem of a show.”\n\nNot to be missed!\n\nSuzzy and Lucy released their last recording I Can Still Hear You in the fall of 2020. The album was largely recorded in the darkest hours of the Covid shutdown in the spring of 2020 in New York City. After starting the recording in Nashville, the mother/daughter team went back to New York just as the city closed up. They set up studios in their bedrooms: Lucy in Brooklyn, Suzzy in Manhattan, and finished the record. Suzzy and Lucy have recorded two albums previously, Fairytale & Myth (Independent Music Award winner) and Mud & Apples (also nominated for IMA).\n\nPraise for I Can Still Hear You:\n\n“Suzzy Roche and Lucy Wainwright Roche’s I Can Still Hear You will be one of the year’s best” — Americana Highways\n\n“One of the best albums of October 2020. The album has a hushed, muted melancholy about it: the goofy joy of classic Roches may be missing, but the family vocal blend and wry intelligence are, thankfully, being passed to the next generation” — Rolling Stone\n\n“I Can Still Hear You is an album for our times. Every song shimmers with perfection, even as it reminds us of the ragged ways that we love and the misery and loss of the days in which we find ourselves.” — Folk Alley\n\n“This mother-daughter duo use their their vocals to repudiate despair, to transcend the mere mortal. These are vocals that take you to the other side of the mountain, where renewal reigns supreme.” — No Depression\n\n\"On 'I Can Still Hear You,' Suzzy Roche and her daughter, Lucy Wainwright Roche, beautifully blend their warm voices and create a delightful musical counterpoint to the dissonance of 2020. 'Love is a thing that does rule every nation,' goes one lyric. Let’s hear it for harmony\" — Associated Press\n\n“Their finest hour yet, it’s a musically gentle listening experience, suffused with both love and sadness and, as the title implies, a reminder that while we may be apart our voices are not silenced.” — Folk Radio UK\n\n“A welcome collaboration from two venerated singer-songwriters. It also serves as a testament to the human spirit in a time of darkness.” — PopMatters\n\nThose familiar with Lucy Wainwright Roche are aware of her bell tone voice, her unshakable melodies, and her knack for wise, wry lyrics. It’s no surprise that Wainwright Roche is the daughter of Suzzy Roche (The Roches) and Loudon Wainwright III, half sibling to Rufus and Martha Wainwright. Lucy has carved out her own career as a touring singer/songwriter and recording artist, with five critically acclaimed solo recordings released on her own label: Eight Songs, Eight More, Lucy, There’s a Last Time for Everything and her most recent Little Beast (Winner of the Independent Music Award for Best Singer/Songwriter.) Other recordings include a collaboration with her sister Martha Wainwright on Songs In the Dark, a collection of lullabies. For over a decade, as a solo act, armed with a guitar, a deadpan sense of humor, insightful songs, and a voice that makes tough guys cry, she’s built a solid following across the US and Europe. As an opening act she has often appeared with such luminaries as The Indigo Girls, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Neko Case, and her brother, Rufus, and she’s one of a few who can step out alone in front of a thousand strangers and play an entire set to a rapt audience.\n\nWebsite // Facebook // Instagram\n\nSuzzy Roche is a singer/songwriter/performer/author and founding member of the singing group The Roches. She has recorded over eighteen albums, written music for TV and Film, and toured extensively for forty years across the U.S. and Europe. She has performed with the experimental theater troupe, The Wooster Group, for over twenty years. Her children’s book Want To Be In A Band (Random House) was published in February 2013. Wayward Saints (Hyperion/Voice) is her first novel and was a selection of the Spring 2012 B&N Discover Great New Writers Program. Her most recent novel The Town Crazy was published in August of 2020.\n\nWebsite // Facebook"
