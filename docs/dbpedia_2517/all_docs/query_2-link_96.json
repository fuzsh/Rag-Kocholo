        "text": "When they were little, the Wainwright sisters shared a dad. All siblings share their parents, half-siblings more so, but theirs was an extreme case: they shared Loudon Wainwright III with the booze, with the road, with – by his own admission – \"every waitress in North America and the British Isles,\" and with the muse that compelled him to turn every fight, every regret and every moment of weakness into a song.\n\nEach summer, Martha's mum, Kate McGarrigle​, would drive down from Montreal to Shelter Island and drop her and her elder brother Rufus off with Loudon for a month. Lucy's mum, Suzzy Roche, brought her up from New York. There were trips to the beach, lemonade stands at the roadside, family and friends stopping in. Looking back, it's amazing how normal it seems.\n\nNot long before Lucy was born, Loudon wrote a song for Martha, Five Years Old, to apologise for not attending her birthday party. Infant Lucy's first gift was Screaming Issue: \"Lucy when I hear you crying I don't know what I can do/You're so miserable lying next to me I can't help you.\"\n\nTheir mothers answered Loudon with songs of their own. Kate McGarrigle wrote Go Leave, telling him he'd be better off with another woman, then Blues In D when he came back. Anna McGarrigle told her sister Kitty Come Home. Suzzy's sister, Terre, came up with Runs In The Family, and the Roches sang it in three part harmony: \"I picked a fight with you/I'm holding the bag/Just like my mama did/Just like her mama did… oh no, it runs in the family.\"\n\nGrowing up, there was always a guitar being strummed and voices being raised together, singing lyrics that stripped sentimentality and delusion bare.\n\nLoudon was the worst offender. \"We had to sit in the audience and hear him talk about this wife, that wife,\" Martha recalls. \"There are songs he wrote about Lucy's mom that could apply to my mother.\" She's ten, Lucy is five. Their father is on stage, singing:\n\nYour Mother and I are not getting along\n\nSomehow somewhere something went wrong\n\nEverything changes, time takes its toll\n\nYour folks fell in love, love's a very deep hole\n\nYour Mother and I will do all we can do\n\nTo work this thing out and to take care of you\n\nFamilies get broken, I know it's a shame\n\nIt's nobody's fault and you're not to blame\n\n\"The music, to me, was helpful, because it's always a hard thing to swallow when your parents break up,\" Martha says. \"Through hearing their songs I felt relieved that they were meant to be together, at least for a small period of time.\"\n\nChildhood was punctuated by musical performances. The Roches appeared on the Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live, but more often in small clubs, getting by. Loudon beat himself up nightly for anyone that would pay to hear it. The McGarrigle Sisters tasted fame, spat it out, and returned to Canada to do things their way. Home alone, Kate sang the kids to sleep: \"Go tell Aunt Rhody/The old gray goose is dead… The goslings are mourning… The old gander's weeping…\" Sweet dreams, my love.\n\nSongs In The Dark, by The Wainwright Sisters, is a collection of deceptively sweet lullabies. Put it on without paying attention and the harmonies lap in and out like the gentlest of swells. They're singing about death, loneliness, desperation and insomnia, inherited maladies and malevolent spirits, but the children will never know.\n\nAt 39, Martha has two small boys of her own: Arcangelo and Francis Valentine. Lucy lives alone in Brooklyn, on the top floor of a converted council block, where the autumn light washes the baby grand, the Gibson acoustic guitar and the family photographs of Roches and Wainwrights in gold. \"Whose piano is that?\" Martha asks. Lucy explains that it's a stray, with two keys that can't be tuned.\n\nWhen Arcangelo was born, not quite six years ago, a friend of Martha's made her a bedtime mixtape. As all parents know, most music for children is cloying, repetitive and quite unbearable. These were songs to soothe the savage breast. In Hobo's Lullaby, Woody Guthrie tells a drifter that when he dies, he'll find no policemen in heaven. A \"hostile baby-rocking song\" finds Rosalie Sorrels dreaming of giving her infant away.\n\nMartha added some heirlooms, including Screaming Issue, Runs In The Family and Lullaby, in which Loudon curses himself for his inability to sleep. Lucy brought an olde English fairy tale, Long Lankin, worthy of the Brothers Grimm, and the spectacularly misanthropic End Of The Rainbow by their close family friend Richard Thompson: \"I feel for you, you little horror… There's nothing to grow up for anymore.\"\n\n\"It's important to share dark and cynical things with your children, because it's your job to let them know what's coming,\" says Martha. \"Also, there's a melancholy that comes in, a sadness that the adults feel, and sometimes the only person that can listen to them openly are their children, staring up at them. You might put it into a beautiful context of music but what you really need to tell them is how hard your life is.\"\n\nArcangelo was born more than two months prematurely, in December 2009, by emergency caesarean section. As she lay on the operating table, anaesthetised from the chest down, Martha couldn't stop talking. \"I was very nervous, because they thought the baby might have spina bifida, and I was like: 'at least now I'm gonna be able to make the Christmas show, it's gonna be great, you really should come' – going on and on, kind of insane,\" she says.\n\nThe Christmas show was a family tradition – for the Roches and the McGarrigles, independently – but this one had a particular significance. Kate McGarrigle was dying, after a long struggle with cancer. Her family and her fans knew that the concert, at London's Royal Albert Hall, would be her last public appearance.\n\n\"She was lying on a couch 10 minutes before going on stage, holding on to her life, in extreme pain,\" Martha says. \"But we put her in an outfit, got her hair done, and she was on stage for the whole show, which was almost three hours long, and sang the best that she had sung in years.\" Afterwards, Kate had a glass of wine, her first in months, and met with well-wishers. The next day, she got on a plane and went home to die.\n\nMartha expressed her grief the way she knew best. On All Your Clothes, from her album Come Home To Mama, she imagined a conversation she could no longer have: \"Where've you been these days?/I thought I saw you underneath the vines… The baby's doing fine/My marriage is failing but I keep trying all the time.\"\n\nOn the new record, she sings Lullaby for a Doll, a song Kate wrote when Martha was tiny that pictures her as a grown-up, with children of her own. \"It's obviously surreal to sing a song that's written about you,\" she says. \"I sound a lot like her when I sing it … It amplifies the truth, that I've felt since she died, that you can end up becoming a lot like your parents.\"\n\nAs a teenager, she pushed her mother away and moved in with her dad. They soon discovered that a rebellious 15-year-old and a 45-year-old in the throes of a midlife crisis are ill-suited to share a one-bedroom apartment in New York.\n\nLoudon wrote a song about it, of course, called I'd Rather Be Lonely: \"Every day you're in my face/How can I get rid of you?\" Martha assumed it was about a girlfriend. Lucy thought it was about her mother. But then one night, with Martha in the wings, he told the audience \"this is about my tedious teenage daughter,\" or words to that effect. She says it's the one time she felt truly wounded by a lyric.\n\nYears later, she got her own back with Bloody Mother F---ing Asshole, the blunt refrain of a more nuanced song about finding her voice in the shadow of her parents and her more accomplished older brother. Kate thought it was directed at her. When Loudon found out the truth, it was his turn to feel wronged.\n\n\"My mother's music was very subtle, and I lack that subtlety. I'm much more like Loudon as a songwriter, which is going for the jugular,\" Martha says. \"I always think 'this is funny' and end up hurting people's feelings. And that's happened over and over. I've paid the price as he's paid the price.\"\n\nThe Wainwrights are often accused of airing their dirty linen in public. Actually, they tie it to the back of a van, like the cans trailing a car after a wedding, and drive around the country sounding the horn. On tour together, and at their regular reunions, they never spare each other's feelings.\n\nLoudon sings That Hospital, which reveals that Martha almost wasn't born (Kate went to get an abortion but couldn't go through with it) and Hitting You, about spanking Martha when she misbehaved on a road trip: \"I knew right away it was too hard and I'd never make it right.\" Rufus does Dinner At Eight, telling his father \"put up your fists and I'll put up mine\" and promising to make him cry for abandoning him as a child.\n\nThere's no original material on Songs In The Dark, but that doesn't mean Martha isn't mining the experience of motherhood for inspiration. Somewhere on her next album, or the one after that, there will be songs that mortify Arcangelo and Francis later in life.\n\n\"I'll basically make the same mistake that my parents did,\" Martha says. \"What else am I going to write about? You can only write so much about marriage, until you get in trouble, and then the other thing that's facing you are the children.\"\n\nHer husband, Brad Albetta​, is also her bass player, accompanist and producer. At London's Union Chapel, in August 2013, three-year-old Arcangelo was given a switched off microphone to play with as his mum performed Stormy Weather. He danced around the stage, sang along, rocked back and forth and threw shapes, like a born frontman, blissfully unaware of what he has inherited.\n\nSongs in the Dark is out now."
