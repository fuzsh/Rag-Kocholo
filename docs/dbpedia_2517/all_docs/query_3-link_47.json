        "text": "Well that would be the same as the transcription disc I lost out on\n\nGoing out looking is an electronic experimental synth thig Kate, Anna, Dane & Pat wrote. It can be found on YouTube from when it was performed at their TV special from the red creek inn in New York in the mid-80s: Link\n\nMan is an island is a Christmas song written but never recorded by Kate & Anna. The only published version is by Emmylou Harris, with K&A on backing. It was provided to her by ex-husband Brian Ahern who carried it around on a cassette for years. Link to Emmy's version . If you can produce a K&A only version that would ver very, very rare.\n\n@guitargal alright I'm ready now. Hold on, it's a long ride.\n\nWell, to start, since you seem to know very little of the McGarrigle family, I will just give a quick short-story of the general facts of their parents background and their childhood.\n\nFrank McGarrigle married Gaby Latremoullie in 1935. At that time they were thirty-six and thirty-one respectively. At the time, Gaby worked in an office and Frank was a purchasing agent for a bush plane company.\n\nMary Anne Gabrielle Latremouille was born in Montreal, the oldest of fifteen children (twelve of whom survived into adulthood - though one of those twelve passed at only twenty-four years old) to Arthur Latremoullie, a french-speaking streetcar conductor originally from St. John New Brunswick, and Laury Coté, who was bilingual and of English-Irish heritage on one side, French on the other. For this reason all Latremoullie children were bilingual - a tradition that prevailed. All the children also sang. Gaby was a smart young woman and the school management wanted her to stay for a higher education, but knew her family could not afford it as Arthur needed her to help support her siblings. In the end the school sponsored an extra year of education before Gaby finally quit school. Gaby always held a strained relationship to her father, partly bitter about him keeping her mother constantly pregnant, partly bitter about the way he acted during the illness and subsequent death of her little sister Ruth (who died of a heart condition at age twenty-four), and partially angry for the way he used her financially when she first started working. Despite this he had a good relationship with his grandchildren and even lived with the family periodically.\n\nFrank McGarrigle was the third of six children born to Jen Gillis and James McGarrigle, growing up in New Brunswick. His father, an early movie-projector in Canada, was distant and was often either on the road working or out drinking. After his mother died when he was only ten years old, Frank and four of his five siblings were raised by two spinster aunts on his father's side. The youngest sibling, Gus, was only six months and sent to live with relatives of his mother in the US.\n\nKate & Anna McGarrigle grew up in the Montreal suburb of St:Sauveur des monts. Though English was the primary language at home - their father barely spoke any French at all - they attended a French school run by the village nuns, and their grandfather was exclusively French speaking, so they became bilingual. They owned a property which is still in the family, called Garden Court - after Garden Court Cottages, their father's cottage renting business that he had at the back of the property. Garden Court Music is the name of Kate and Anna's publishing company that they copyrighted their songs to.\n\nThe family were very poor - For most of the time after they moved away from Montreal (where Jane was born), Frank mostly worked various odd jobs, as his abilities to provide for his family was limited due to bad health that haunted him most of his life. He had a severe, nearly debilitating asthma and unfortunate propensity for lung diseases and respiratory infections, all of which Anna has said she also inherited - as is proven by Anna having suffered several bouts of bronchitis in the last few years, among other health issues. Included in the father's many periods of illness, there was more than one battle with tuberculosis, which was still a common disease at the time. Gaby worked part time to help prop up their fragile economy but it wasn’t enough. Frank died in 1965, choking to death, and Gaby passed away 31 years later in 1996, as described by Anna in her song \"Song for Gaby\" from their 1997 record Matapedia. The lyrics of the song are true to fact, as confirmed by Jane when she outlines her view of those same events in the linear notes for The McGarrigle Hour.\n\nThat was a brief summary of their formative years. If you want to hear about their grandfather putting bombs in the fireplace or his pig head that he carried in a leaky suitcase, or why one of K&A's aunts was named Wilfred, just ask. Also, if you want to know more on the subject of their early lives in detail I recommend Jane & Anna’s biography “Mountain City Girls” (Penguin Random House). If you want photos and career stories, turn to Dane Lanken’s book “Kate & Anna McGarrigle: Songs and stories” (penumbra press).\n\nNow, on to the actual family tree:\n\nFrancis Arthur \"Frank\" McGarrigle (1898) + Mary Anne Gabrielle \"Gaby\" Latremoullie (1904) = Laury Jane (April 26th 1941), Anna Ruth (December 4th 1944) and Catherine Francis \"Kate\" McGarrigle (February 6th 1946)\n\nJane McGarrigle + Dave Dow = Anna Catherine (1968) and Ian Vincent/Vincenzo \"Vinnie\" (1969) Dow.\n\nAnna McGarrigle + Dane Lanken = Lily (1978) and Sylvan Lanken (August 1977)\n\nKate McGarrigle + Loudon Wainwright III = Jack Wainwright (1971), Rufus Wainwright McGarrigle (July 22nd 1973), Martha Wainwright (May 26th 1976)\n\nAnna Catherine Dow + Bob McMillan = Islay (ca 2003) and Gabrielle \"Gaby\" McMillan\n\nVinnie Dow + Kathleen Weldon = ? (1 known child, no name known, born 2020-2021)\n\nMartha Wainwright + Brad Albetta = Arcangelo (2009) and Francis Valentine Wainwright Albetta (2014)\n\nRufus Wainwright (Married to Jörn Wiesbrodt) + Lorca Cohen = Viva Wainwright Cohen (2012)\n\nSylvan Lanken + Vanessa \"Nessie\" ? = ? (One known child, 2020/21)\n\nLoudon Wainwright III + Suzzy Roche = Lucy Wainwright Roche (December 16th 1981)\n\nAs for Chaim, I sadly don't know much. I know he married and had a daughter by the mid-80s, but that's all. He's very private, the McGarrigles never talk much of him in their books really, and so there's not much to be found anywhere.\n\nSome extensive notes to all this:\n\nKate and Loudon married in January 1971, and they seperated in 1976. Dane and Anna married in August 1977 (only a week before Sylvan's birth), and are still married. Jane and Dave married in the spring of 1960 and separated in the late 70s or early 80s. Martha married Brad in 2007 and separated in 2017. Rufus married Jörn Wiesbrodt in 2012 and they are still married. Rufus was never in a relationship with Lorca Cohen, as he is gay, but they had been friends since they were children and agreed to have a child together.\n\nIt is unclear whether Jane's son is actually named Ian Vicent or Ian Vincenzo. In recent videos from Rufus and similar he is named Vincent, but on the 2005/2008 McGarrigle Christmas Album and DVD he is originally credited as both a writer and performer under the name \"Ian Vincenzo\".\n\nKathleen Weldon is the daughter of Peter Weldon, one of the founding members of Mountain City 4 along with K&A McGarrigle and Jack Nissenson.\n\nKate was pregnant at the time she married Loudon in 1971, but suffered a misscarriege at 5 months. According to sources from both sides of the family, it was a boy and they named him Jack.\n\nAccording to Kate & Loudon's divorce papers from the summer of 1979, Rufus legally has double last names (McGarrigle Wainwright), while Martha does not.\n\nKate and Loudon officially separated in 1976, straight after which Loudon entered a relationship with then 20-year-old Suzzy Roche. They broke up ca 1986 and Loudon wrote the song \"Your mother and I\" to their daughter Lucy.\n\nLoudon has four children in total: Rufus and Martha Wainwright, Lucy Wainwright Roche and Alexandra \"Lexi\" Kellie (1996, her mother being his second wife Ritmarie Kellie - he is currently in a long standing relationship with a woman named Susie). Loudon has written songs about or talking to all his four children. About Martha, he wrote That Hospital, Hitting you, and Five years old. About Rufus he wrote Dilated to meet you and Rufus is a tit man. About Lucy he wrote no song but he wrote your mother and I to her, and about Lexie he wrote One year old.\n\nWe know of Islay McMillan's birth year from a very brief appearance as an infant in Rufus concert movie \"Live at the Fillmore\", which is included with certain special CD editions of Rufus album \"Want One\" from 2004. In it, Rufus is seen going up to a flat in San Francisco, where Jane McGarrigle let him in and he subsequently gets to hold a clearly newborn Islay while the mother Anna Catherine watches them."
