        "text": "For many, it’s hard to live up to–or escape–the shadow of one’s parents. This is especially true in the music industry. While having that famous last name opens many doors, finding success and a large audience is a much harder struggle. This is a quick introduction to the children of one of the most interwoven webs in music: the Wainwrights, McGarrigles, Roches, and Cohens.\n\nLoudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle\n\nSometimes dubbed the “clown prince of song,” Loudon Wainwright III was one of many folk artists of the early 1970s dubbed “the next Bob Dylan.” It was during this period that he married Canadian folk singer Kate McGarrigle. While Loudon is a brash, idiosyncratic character, Kate was best known for producing breathtaking harmonies with her sister Anna. The two sang together and wrote indelible folk songs.\n\nLoudon and Kate’s marriage thrust them into the spotlight as the First Family of Folk; yet, it was far from a fairytale, and the family drama that ensued played out in their songs. While the marriage only lasted until 1976, it spawned a wealth of confessional, autobiographical songs, and two amazingly talented future performers: Rufus and Martha Wainwright. Rufus was three years old and Martha newly born when their parents divorced. The children stayed with Kate, who relocated them to her native Montreal.\n\nRufus Wainwright\n\nRufus has been touring since the age of 13, initially as part of the McGarrigle Sisters and Family. He shares his father’s dark sense of humor, and–in true Wainwright-McGarrigle tradition–he draws much from his personal life to craft his songs. In 1996 he was signed to his first record deal and released his debut, Rufus Wainwright two years later. (Sister Martha appears on the album, too.) Since then, he’s issued seven studio albums and two live releases, including a recording of his acclaimed Judy Garland tribute show, Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall. His last studio album was 2012’s Out of the Game, a very personal record addressing both the death of his mother and the birth of his daughter. A greatest hits compilation was released in 2014 entitled Vibrate. One of Rufus’ most successful songs to date remains his cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” (performed in the style of John Cale and Jeff Buckley).\n\nNot limited to pop music, he’s also composed an opera, Prima Donna, and is currently writing his second. Like his father, Rufus makes the occasional film and television cameo, and has a good sense of humor, as seen in his “Rufus Does Gum” sketch for the humor website Funny Or Die. Having been openly gay his entire career, he is a staunch LGBT advocate. In 2012, Rufus married his partner Jörn Weisbrodt, in Montauk, New York.\n\nHere’s Rufus’ official video for “Out of the Game,” which features British actress Helena Bonham Carter:\n\nNPR’s “Tiny Desk Concert” featuring Rufus, from October 2012:\n\nMartha Wainwright\n\nLike her brother Rufus, Martha has also performed and recorded with her mother Kate and aunt Anna McGarrigle. In 1997 she released the self-produced cassette, Ground Floor, followed by a self-titled EP in 1999. After a detour to obtain a drama degree, Martha returned to music with the release of the 2005 LP Martha Wainwright. Since then, she’s released two additional studio albums (most recently, 2012’s Come Home to Mama) and a live album of Edith Piaf covers. She’s also participated on several other compilation LPs. Martha’s songs, like those of her father and brother, have an acerbic wit to them, as well as an autobiographical nature. She is married and had a son in 2009.\n\nHere’s Martha’s official video for “You Cheated Me:”\n\nNPR’s “Tiny Desk Concert” featuring Martha, from November 2012:\n\nLoudon and Suzzy Roche\n\nFollowing his divorce from Kate, Loudon had a relationship with another well-known folk artist, Suzzy Roche–also from a group of singing sisters, the Roches. Suzzy was only just beginning her career at the age of 20 when she and Loudon started their relationship (he was 10 years her senior and already an established name in the music industry). In 1981 they gave the world another musically inclined artist, Lucy Wainwright Roche–the youngest of Loudon’s children.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche\n\nInitially not as involved in the music industry as Rufus and Martha (she began her career as an elementary school teacher), Lucy is now a bonafide folk singer, performing on occasion with both of her parents and half-siblings. Loudon felt it best that Suzzy raise Lucy; the influence of her mother and two aunts, Terre and Maggie (The Roches trio) can be heard in her music, as demonstrated in her song “Monte Rosa Range.” Her first EP, 8 Songs, was released in 2007, followed by 2008’s EP, 8 More. In 2010 she released her first full-length album, Lucy. Her latest release is 2013’s There’s a Last Time for Everything.\n\nHere’s a look at the making of There’s a Last Time for Everything:\n\nThe Cohen Connection\n\nLeonard Cohen, heralded cultural icon and equal parts poet, novelist, artist and singer-songwriter, has led a very full and celebrated life. Volumes have been written about his accomplishments, and he deserves every accolade. But in the midst of his cultural success, he also produced two children with Suzanne Elrod: Adam and Lorca. While growing up under the spotlight of a famous father must be tough, the burden can be shared a bit among siblings who can best relate. A surprise to few would be the friendship between the Wainwrights and Cohens (folk families, Canadian roots, relative proximity in age, etc.).\n\nOf Leonard’s two children, Adam was the one who pursued music. While not a musician, Lorca has pursued the culinary arts, photography, film, and most recently, the world of antiques. But it is her friendship with Rufus Wainwright that has led to the permanent blending of these music royalty bloodlines. For years, Rufus (though gay and married to Jörn Weisbrodt) discussed with Lorca the possibility of having a child together. Finally, it was Kate McGarrigle’s declining health that led to their decision to follow through, as she was able to offer her support of the idea prior to her death in January 2010. Lorca gave birth to Viva Katherine Wainwright Cohen in February 2011. (“Deputy Dad” Jörn, Rufus, Lorca and baby Viva are pictured at the right.)\n\nTime Heals All Wounds\n\nAs for the families, time seems to have healed many of the wounds. Relationships have been reestablished between Loudon and his children. Losing Kate–the matriarch of the Wainwright-McGarrigle legacy–served to bring the family unit closer. During her fight with cancer, and leading up to her final days, Loudon also did his best to reconcile. Rufus, Martha and Kate’s sister Anna helped produce tribute concerts, as well as the album Sing Me the Songs: Celebrating the Works of Kate McGarrigle (which also features Loudon’s sister, Sloan Wainwright, Emmylou Harris, Antony, the Thompsons, and many others). On occasion, Suzzy, Lucy, and Loudon perform together (and sometimes, Rufus and Martha join them, too). And as for Rufus, marriage and fatherhood have mellowed him out, making him more focused and responsible.\n\nTo close out, here is a list of some of the songs that these artists have penned about one another. Some are endearing, some terrifying, but all steeped in perceived truths and a frankly personal nature (this is by no means a complete list).\n\nSongs by Loudon about Rufus:\n\n“Dilated to Meet You”\n\n“Rufus Is a Tit Man”\n\n“A Father and a Son”\n\nSongs by Loudon about Martha:\n\n“Pretty Little Martha”\n\n“Five Years Old”\n\n“Hitting You”\n\n“I’d Rather Be Lonely”\n\n“That Hospital”\n\nSongs by Loudon about Kate:\n\n“Saw Your Name in the Paper”\n\n“Unhappy Anniversary”\n\nSongs by Loudon about Lucy:\n\n“Screaming Issue”\n\n“Your Mother and I”\n\nSong by Kate about Rufus:\n\n“First Born”\n\nSong by Kate about Martha:\n\n“I Eat Dinner”\n\nSongs by Kate about Loudon:\n\n“Blues in D”\n\n“Go Leave”\n\nSongs by Rufus about Loudon:\n\n“Dinner at Eight”\n\nSongs by Rufus about Kate:\n\n“Beauty Mark”\n\n“Candles”\n\nSongs by Martha about Loudon:\n\n“Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole”\n\n“Father Daughter Dialogue”\n\n“You Never Phone”\n\nFor an amazing history of the Wainwright/ McGarrigle connection, click here to read Jim Windolf’s piece from the May 22, 2007, issue of Vanity Fair.\n\nClick on the artists’ names below to visit their official websites:\n\nLoudon Wainwright\n\nKate McGarrigle\n\nRufus Wainwright\n\nMartha Wainwright\n\nSuzzy Roche\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche\n\nAs an added treat, here’s Rufus spoofing himself on Funny Or Die:\n\nThe original version of this post debuted on the Hip Quotient on May 16th, 2014"
