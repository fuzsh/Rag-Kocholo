        "text": "The daughter of folk-music royalty, singer-songwriter Lucy Wainwright Roche joins to talk about her life, family, and multi-decade career in the music industry.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nMy first show was so bad. I was so bad. I was super uncomfortable on stage, not particularly capable. And the second show was at The Living Room. That one was much better because I realized that the best strategy was just to be myself.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nThis is Design Matters with Debbie Millman. For 15 years, Debbie Millman has been talking with designers and other creative people about what they do, how they got to be who they are, and what they’re thinking about and working on. On this episode, a conversation with Lucy Wainwright Roche about her musical family, her career as a singer-songwriter, and her musical tastes.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI really like sad music a lot. Most of the songs I love are really sad.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nHere’s Debbie.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nDespite the fact that Lucy Wainwright Roche comes from music royalty, her father is Grammy Award-winning folk artist, Loudon Wainwright III, her mother was one third of the legendary folk trio, The Roches, and her half siblings are Rufus and Martha Wainwright, she started her career as an elementary school teacher. Eventually, she began singing backup in her brother’s band. And by 2010, she had recorded and released her own CD. When you hear her beguiling voice and listen to her songs, you might conclude she had no choice in the matter.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\n(singing)\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche is here in the studio today to talk about her life, her career, her family, and her music. And maybe she’ll sing a song for us. Lucy Wainwright Roche, welcome to Design Matters.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nLucy, I understand that you’re a rabid Eminem fan and even know every word to “Cleanin’ Out My Closet.” Is that true?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThat is true. No one has ever heard me sing it except for my mother.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWell, would you consider singing it now?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI don’t think I can. I think that would take some real preparation. And maybe I might have to be overly exhausted to do it.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nDarn, too bad you’re not tired today. When did you first discover Eminem, and what was the allure?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI just heard him on the radio, that song, “Mockingbird,” one of the songs about his kid. And many of his songs are so heartbreaking and incredibly fit together. It’s just jaw-dropping to me. And he actually reminds me of my dad, writing wise, a little bit too. Which my dad, I don’t think, would be into.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI could see that.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWhen he talks about his family and his kids, it reminds me of my dad.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYeah, there’s a certain candidness to both of their writing that I can see. I wouldn’t have ordinarily thought that. It would never have occurred to me. But I think you’re right.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWhen he talks about his family and his kids, it reminds me of my dad.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYeah, there’s a certain candidness to both of their writing that I can see. I wouldn’t have ordinarily thought that. It would never have occurred to me. But I think you’re right. Lucy, you were born and raised in Greenwich Village, New York City. Your parents split up when you were two. And I’ve read that you lived with your mom, Suzzy Roche, in a tiny one bedroom apartment, where you had the bedroom and she had the living room. Your mom has said that while it was often financially stressful, you never had the sense you were poor. Have you and your mom always been close?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYes. My mom and I are really enmeshed, you might say. And we talk most every day and text a lot. And we work together too, so we sometimes tour together. And we shared a hotel room when I was a kid and we share a hotel room still.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI can’t even imagine what it must’ve been like to grow up with Suzzy Roche as your mother. I’ve been a fan of their music, a rabid fan, I might say, and I could probably sing many, many songs on the spot. Not that I’m going to, but I’m just letting you know.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWell, that I could do too. We could do that together.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nOh, let’s sing Hammond Song together.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nOkay.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nBut I’ve been a fan of their music since 1979. What is your favorite song?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI would say one of my all time favorite Roches songs is One Season. I love that song so much. It holds up. With every passing year, I relate to it more and more, which I’m not sure is a great sign about me in general. But the song is just, it’s so good.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWell, their music is timeless. I think every single one of their albums still hold up.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, I think so too.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nHow much time do you spend with your dad at this point in your life?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWe also work together. I open for him sometimes, and then sometimes me and my mom and my dad do shows altogether. So it goes and fits and starts with the whole family. So maybe I’ll see him a lot over a space of a couple of months where we’re working, and then not that often. But he’s in New York and so am I, but we’re both on the road. So part of the thing about everybody is just that we’re all… You have to catch each other in the same city at the same time, which is a little hard. But my dad is very good at keeping in touch, so he likes to meet for dinner and he calls. If I don’t see him, we talk on the phone.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI don’t want to spend that much time talking about your family because I want to talk about you and your music and your life. But I thought it would be fun to ask you for one sentence descriptions of your immediate musical family. And we’ll start with Anna and Kate McGarrigle, each individual?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWell, yesterday was, or I think the day before yesterday, was Kate McGarrigle’s birthday. She has passed away now, 10 years ago. This is more than a sentence. Okay, a sentence. I didn’t know her well, but if we’d had the chance to get to know each other, I think we would’ve liked each other.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd what about Anna?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nAnna, I don’t see her often, but when I do, she’s mysterious and lovely.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nMaggie Roche, the late great, brilliant Maggie Roche?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nOh man. One of the most brilliant and loyal people that you could ever know. Also, really loved cheese.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nTerre Roche?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nShe is absolutely fascinating to talk to on any topic, absolutely any topic. Yes, and also just one of my all time favorite people.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nLoudon Wainwright III?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIt’s funny, the thing that comes into my head is that I think he’s a great dad, which I don’t think is something that he’s known for. I don’t think people think that about him. But I would say he’s been a great dad to me. Sometimes that looks different than what you think it might.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nOh, absolutely. Martha Wainwright?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWhen her light shines upon you, it’s the best feeling that there is.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nRufus Wainwright?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWe are very different in our way that we are in the world. But he has this deep, sweet, sentimental thing about him that just keeps everybody very connected in the family.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd then, finally, your mom, Suzzy Roche?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nShe almost always is exactly spot on with whatever she says or does. There’s so many things to say about all of them, but yeah.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI do have to say, and I ordinarily don’t brag on the show, but I have the noted distinction of having seen every single person that I just mentioned in concert.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nReally?\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThat’s so cool. It’s like a collection of cereal box toys and you have them all.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nBut I have never seen you perform all together, other than The Roches. It’s everybody has been solo.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah. Well, we have done that. We went on a cruise altogether and performed on the cruise altogether. That was intense.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd didn’t you also do that when you were in Alaska? Didn’t you all travel together, and then take the audience on buses and trains with you?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWe did, in Alaska, yes, we did.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nHow did that work? Did you just pick people up along the way?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIt’s this thing called Roots on the Rails. These lovely people run these things where musicians come in, and the audience come, and it’s an all expense paid trip. And, oftentimes, they’ll be on trains for a lot of the time, and even sleeper trains. One of the ones that I did, we slept on the train. The one in Alaska, we didn’t sleep on the train, and it involved some buses as well, and some boats. So the audience came with us. There were maybe 45 audience members, and then me, and my mom, and my dad, and my brother, and my Aunt Sloan. Martha couldn’t come because her son was starting kindergarten.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd was your grandmother selling CDs?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nShe wasn’t with us on that, but she used to sell the CDs, when I was a kid, with The Roches. But it was fun. We saw whales. I basically was like, if I see a whale, it was worth it. And I did, I saw a whale.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nHow old were you at that time?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIt was just a couple of years ago.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nOh. So I read that when you were four or five years old, that was when you first graced a stage. It was at the great Bottom Line nightclub in New York City, where Rufus and Martha Wainwright were performing. Talk about what happened?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThey got me up on stage. I think it might’ve been a Christmas show or something, a Roches Christmas show maybe. And I got up, and I was supposed to sing, and I just burst into tears. And my dad had to come and get me off the stage. I remember that he came up to the edge of the stage and lifted me off the stage. And my mom thinks that probably the whole audience thought that it was child abuse because they were like, “Get up on the stage.” But I think I thought I wanted to do it, and then I got out there and I was like, “Oh geez.”\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd were you just shy? Were you afraid?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI think I was just shy. I was very shy as a kid. I did not… Not with the people closest to me but, in school, I didn’t talk and stuff really at all until about second grade. I had a teacher who got me to talk. And then, now, I talk incessantly.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI understand you first tried to play the guitar when you were about seven. Were you trying to teach yourself? Who was teaching you?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nMy mom and my Aunt Terre. My Aunt Terre was going to teach me. And they got a left-handed guitar because I’m left-handed. And I think she tried to teach me “Old McDonald” on the guitar, and I just wasn’t feeling it. And we all gave up. And then it wasn’t until I was in high school that I started to play the guitar. And I play the guitar right-handed. I don’t know if that was part of it. Maybe I’m not that left-handed or something. But, also, seven is young for the guitar because it hurts your fingers.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI’m left-handed also, and I can play five chords on a guitar, but I play with a right-handed guitar as well. And I’ve tried to switch, thinking that I’d be able to play better that way, but I can’t.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, me too, same. And, also, by the way, five chords is all you need.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nNeil Young did it in three.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, you’re ready.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI don’t have the gene. It’s my biggest regret in my life that I don’t have that gene.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nReally?\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYeah. And one of the things that I really wanted to ask you, and I ask every musician that comes on the show this question, how do you write a song?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI often feel in a panic like I’ll never write a song again. So I’m a little bit in that phase right now. And I also often have a blackout about what happens when I write. But that aside, I usually sit with the guitar. And I’ll either get something on the guitar that I like or some kind of melody that goes with it. And, sometimes, I’ll get stand-in words that I just put in to get the shape of the melody, and then I’ll replace them later. A thing that happens to me a lot is I’ll get a verse and a chorus. And then I’ll be like, “Well, I said that.” And then I’ll be like, “Oh geez, I have to finish this somehow.” And it’s hard to get past that initial idea for me. But, oftentimes, you go into a zone and I’m not even sure what happens. But, man, I am so grateful every time it happens. And it’s especially great when you don’t turn on the song that you just wrote. That’s a thing that happens a lot.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWhen you hate it?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, as soon as you do it. My mom says that it’s like a cat who coughs up a hairball, and then jumps back and looks at it like, “Who did that?” And I think that’s a pretty good description. It’s hard to not turn on your work, I think, either partway through or afterwards. After I’ve made a record, I usually do not want to hear it ever again. It’s that same feeling of somehow it just presses your buttons in a way that other people’s stuff doesn’t.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nDo you ever, once a song is finished, ever go back and rewrite lyrics, or change the chorus, or do anything to augment it in some way?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI haven’t ever done that. There’s a song on my new record that I really like still, miraculously. But there is a lyric in it that I wish I had changed. And I haven’t changed it yet, but I would say I feel regret about it.\n\nPART 1 OF 4 ENDS [00:15:04]\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\n… say I feel regret about it. So I’ve thought, well, maybe you could change it. Just because it’s not the official recording, I could change it in shows. So I’m thinking about changing it because every time I get to that part I’m like, “Ugh, I wish I hadn’t written that.”\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWell, Joni Mitchell and Stevie Nicks have changed lyrics. I’ve heard Stevie Nicks changed the lyrics to “Landslide,” which is sort of shocking. And then Joni Mitchell has changed lyrics to “Hejira” with whoever is playing saxophone with her.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nShe’ll say, “Michael Brecker,” or whoever might be playing. She started it, I think, with Michael Brecker.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah. I was listening to a recording of Joan Baez doing “Diamonds and Rust” recently, and I was trying to play for someone this thing that I’d heard her do in a show. And then I discovered that it wasn’t in the original, that she had changed something, and she was doing it in performances but not-\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWhat are the lyrics that she changed?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThe lyrics that she changed are, “If you’re offering diamonds and rust-“\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI’ve already paid.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\n“I’ve already paid,” is the original one. But when I saw her do it more recently, she said, “If you’re offering diamonds and rust, I’ll take the diamonds,” which I thought was really good.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nVery, very good.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nSo that’s a change I could totally get behind.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWell, one of the things that I heard Joni Mitchell say in one of her live recordings was that when you’re standing in front of an audience and they ask you to play a song, she thought it was interesting that nobody ever asks a painter to repaint a painting, but yet we’re always asking performers to redo these songs that are such a part of our lives.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd she jokes nobody ever asked Van Gogh to paint a sunflower again.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThat’s true. That’s true.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nSo I know your family also tried to get you to take piano lessons and you weren’t interested either, but there’s a lot of piano on your records, and I’ve seen you play piano. So when did that take hold?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah. I don’t really play the piano enough to play anything. I wish that I had stuck with lessons. I know. How many times do you hear? I remember as a child, all the adults saying that they wish they had stayed with piano lessons, and I now am an adult who wishes that. I quit because I thought that my teacher didn’t smell good.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nThat’s a good reason. That’s a really good reason.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI thought he smelled bad.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI stopped physical therapy on my thumb because of that, and I really regret it. Yes.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI didn’t just think he didn’t smell good, I thought that he smelled bad. And I refused to keep doing it. And that wasn’t the best decision I ever made. I wish I had, because I love the piano. And on my last record, my most recent record, there’s a lot of piano. And mostly the producer, my friend Jordan Hamlin, she played most of it. And I adore the piano on recordings, so I wish that I had stuck with it more. And I’ve thought about taking lessons now as an adult, and it’s on a list of things I think of doing and don’t. But maybe I will someday.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYou wrote your first songs in high school, but you then gave up music and stated that the last thing you wanted to do was get up on stage and perform. Was that because of your shyness or because of feeling your family vibe?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, I think in high school I did write my first songs. My first song that I wrote was about babysitting. It was about this kid that I babysat for all through high school, and then he and his family moved away and I went to college. And it was about the heartbreak of that. But in high school I got really interested in teaching, and I volunteered a lot in the lower school classrooms at my high school. And I was moving in that direction. And I think I’d been living in the soup of the music thing for so long that I walked towards college, kind of dropping all of that behind me.\n\nAnd when I was in college, I did a lot of booking. And my brother came to play and other people I was fans of came to play, and other family members came to play at college, and I booked them but I wasn’t really interested in performing. And then I think it kind of… towards the end of college I started to notice the absence of that.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYou attended Oberlin College in Ohio and graduated with a degree in creative writing and then went on to get a master’s degree in education from the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan. What made you decide you wanted to become a teacher?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI always loved working with kids. I really just always wanted to do that. And to this day I’m torn about not doing it.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nThere was this wistful look in your eyes as you said this.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI have read that you think there are some similarities in terms of engagement with an audience and with students but now, especially being on the road as much as you are on your own, it must be hard to not have that collective energy around.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, definitely. It’s one of the amazing things about being a teacher, is just the day in and day out-ness of it and the sheer number of hours that you spend with these people. And even though you’re not with their parents, it’s a very intimate thing, dealing with people’s families and children and struggles in school. And you’re a really big, present part of peoples’ everyday lives. And now I’m not like that at all. I’m literally passing through town, and that is what my life is. So it’s really different in that way.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYou taught both in Durham, North Carolina and New York City. How different were those experiences?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWell, in Durham I didn’t have my degree yet and I was teaching mostly preschoolers, so they were really\n\nlittle. And three year olds, most of them are three, I feel like three year olds are really interesting because they sort of get what’s going on and then they also have this total belief that anything could be happening. They’ve been being told all these weird things like, “You grow inside of another human being.” In some cases, “Santa Claus comes down the chimney.” All these things. They’re like, “Oh, okay. Sure.” They’re just-\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nThey believe everything.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah. And they’ve got it kind of figured out, but then it’s also kind of confusing. So that was really fun. Then in New York I taught second grade and then third grade, which is a whole other thing. I love second and third grade. I think it’s a very industrious age. People want to be doing stuff and making books and creating their own thing. And one of the things I loved the most about that time period was I got really into telling stories with them.\n\nWe set out trying to write stories, but some kids are really limited by the physical demands of actually writing. So we started doing storytelling instead, where they would tell stories from their own lives in front of the class. And that was a hoot and so great. And also taking away the writing, the actual physical writing of it, meant that they could get the story structure thing sorted out without that, in case that was a stumbling block for them. So I loved that. I miss that.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWere you bringing music into the classroom as well?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nNot really. I was pretty shy. I was really shy as a teacher. I think I would be a better teacher now because I think, after all these years of doing shows, I’m less shy. The only songs I taught them were the songs that I was taught in elementary school. So I taught them the “Fifty Nifty United States” song, where you list all the states in alphabetical-\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAlabama.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah.\n\nTogether:\n\nAlaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nAnd I remember on the first day, when my teacher taught us that, I just thought, “I’ll never be able to learn that.” And then you do. And I remember on the first day in the second grade class, me singing it for them and them being like, “Well, we can’t do that.” But they all know it.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd they probably still do.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThey probably still do. And there was a song about parallelograms that I learned in elementary school that I taught them. Those were the only songs that I taught them.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWhat made you decide to give up teaching and join what the Wainwright family calls the family business?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIn 2005 my brother, who you might think isn’t paying attention to anyone else, that’s not true, though, about him. He kind of has a covert eye on everybody in a way you might not expect. And he was like, “I think you should come out on the road with me this summer.” And I did. I went on his tour bus and I sang back up with him. I never spoke a word on stage. I was painfully shy during all of that, but it was really fun. Touring on a tour bus is really fun, and living in his life for a minute is really fun.\n\nSo when I went back to teaching after that summer, it had kind of gotten under my skin a little bit. Like, “But I really like that world and I miss that world.” And I think I, after another year of teaching, decided that if I was going to give it a shot, I better just do it. And thinking, well, maybe I’ll come back to teaching. And so then after that next year I left.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nThere are some wonderful versions of you and your brother singing “Hallelujah” on YouTube, which are just gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, that’s we sang. That’s the first one that we ever did together. Yeah.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYour first gig, your first solo gig was opening for your father in 2005 at the Rockwood Music Hall in New York. What was that like?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIt was really bad. My first show was so bad. I was so bad. I was super uncomfortable on stage, not particularly capable, and not doing myself any favors. And the second show was at the Living Room, which also is closed, I think. And that one was much better because in that time I realized that the best strategy was just to be myself.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nThat’s a very fast learning curve.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWell, I think it was such a debacle trying to-\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nDid you cry on stage?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nNo, no, no. Not that time.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYour dad didn’t have to come get you?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah. But I was crying on the inside, and I was behaving like a weirdo. I think I had watched so many performances that I think maybe I thought something else was happening, but really people are best when they’re channeling their real self. And once I figured that out, it got a lot better. That’s not to say that the Living Room, the second show, was fantastic, but it was less… it felt better.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWhen did you start to feel comfortable, fully comfortable and fully yourself on stage?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nProbably within the first year of doing shows. There’s nothing like just doing 30 shows in a row to get your act together. Literally.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nLiterally.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah. And nothing else can do that except for doing the shows.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYou had to really want to do it, though, if that first experience was, as you put it, terrifying and also terrible.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah. I think I wanted to live the shape of the lives of the people who I grew up around. I don’t know if that was the best decision, but that’s what I wanted.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWhy?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWell, I knew full well going into this that this was, in most cases, not lucrative and, in most cases, not super stable. I knew all that. I have no excuse for… I didn’t go into it blind at all, but I definitely have come up against the reality of that, and feeling like, wow, what was I thinking? At the same time, my whole life is built around this now, and amazing things… I’ve gotten to see amazing things that I never would’ve seen. But at the same time, I think one thing about it is, when I started out, all of my peers were\n\nstarting out and they were doing whatever job. Usually not the job they really wanted, but maybe working towards the job they really wanted.\n\nAnd I left teaching and went out to do this. And everybody was sort of like, “Wow, that’s cool.” And then 10 years later, everybody’s life is really developed into a much more stable… they’ve ended up in a certain spot, and I’m still doing the same thing, and it’s a lot less cool-looking.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nBut you’re making music.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThat’s true.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYou’re living a completely creative life.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIt’s true.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYour first album was the eponymously titled Lucy and was released in 2010. And I understand you and your mom were touring at that point to raise money to make the album. Did you self-produce the entire thing?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nMy stepdad, Stewart Lerman, he produced that first record. And my first couple recordings, I made two EPs and then that record. And those recordings were made really in the seat of the family. So Stewart produced them. I worked with him a lot one-on-one. The Roches sang on that first record. I think my dad also sang on that first record. So it was very much totally insulated in the world of the family, which, the two records after that have been really different in that way.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWould you do a song from that album for us now?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nSure. Sure.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd if you can also tell us a little bit about the song you’re going to sing. Your songs are stories.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nOkay. This song is called “Open Season.” I wrote it after I took the F Train out to Coney Island one day in the winter and they happened to be taking down Luna Park, the old amusement park there, without any fanfare whatsoever. I just showed up and they were removing this giant rocket ship that was up.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nThat’s sort of poetic.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI know. I was like, “Better get home and write a song.” This song is a song that a lot of people request. It’s also a song that, whenever I’m in a relationship, people are like, “I really like that song but it’s about So-and-So,” like the person before or whatever. And I’m always like, “No, it isn’t.” So that keeps getting said to me. I don’t know what to make of that. But anyway. Good? Okay.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\n(Singing).\n\nPART 2 OF 4 ENDS [00:30:04\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nThank you. That was beautiful.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThanks.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nLucy, you’ve been described as a master of musical melancholy. Would you say that that is accurate?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWell, I mean that’s a nice compliment because I really like sad music a lot, and I don’t think I’ll ever have the feeling towards my songs that I have towards songs that I love. Most of the songs I love are really sad.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWhat are some of your favorites?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nOh man. Well, there’s a song called “Holy” by Chris Parika that I love so much that’s so sad, I just listened to it today. I can’t listen to it without crying and I really love it. Someone like Patty Griffin has a lot of really sad songs.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYou’ve opened for her, what was that like for you?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIt was great. I’m a big fan and I don’t know her well and I did a few shows with her last year. It was great. Her audience is great, and I got to watch her show every night and she’s so amazing and wonderful, so that was great.\n\nI also love songs that maybe don’t sound that sad but strike me as sad. Like the Paul Simon “Crazy Love” on the album Graceland. It’s almost upbeat, but it breaks my heart, that song, and I really love to take upbeat- sounding songs and turn them into what someone coined, “Sad snoozers.”\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI like “Master of Musical Melancholy” better. I saw that. I wasn’t even going to ask you about that. I don’t think that there’s a better example of you doing that than the song on your album that you released in 2013. The album is titled There’s a Last Time for Everything, which features your really unusual and brilliant cover of the Swedish Pop star Robyn’s “Call Your Girlfriend.” The original is a club beat-heavy pop dance anthem and the entire video of her doing it is of her dancing in a gymnasium.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIt’s such a great video, it’s such a great video.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nBut you perform it with a few chords on an acoustic guitar and a small choir. I was wondering if you would do that for us as well, but also tell us about why you decided to do that song. What is it about that song?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nWhen I was making that record, Jordan, the producer and I, took a drive to see Neko Case in Atlanta. We drove from Nashville to Atlanta kind of in the middle of making the record and we played that song and we both loved that song. And about halfway through the song we sort of both looked at each other and thought, “Could we possibly?” And we did. And I’m so glad we did.\n\nI love that song because it’s so unusual, what she’s saying, the way that she’s saying it is not something that I’d heard quite that way before.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI heard it described, or I read it described as a reverse “Jolene,” the song by Dolly Parton, which I think, “Yeah, that’s actually true.”\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, totally. That’s true. Yeah, I just love it. And then when we tried to do it slowed down, which is my mode that I want to take every song into it kind of really worked. In fact, a lot of people think it’s my song and then when I tell them that it’s a dance song, they’re just totally shocked; because I think when you hear it slowed down, it doesn’t seem like it would be a dance song at all.\n\nIn fact, the other day somebody came up to me at the CD table and said, “Oh my God, the other day I was in the store and suddenly this dance remix version of your song “Call Your Girlfriend” came on the radio and I was like, ‘Oh my God, she’s gotten so big that they’re remixing her songs as dance song.'” And I was like, ” to worry. I haven’t gotten so big as that. That’s the original.”\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nLike Tom’s Diner.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nSo I love that song and I’ll definitely do it for you if you want.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYes, please.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\n(Singing).\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nThank you for that. Lucy, what made you decide to record this album in Nashville?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThe last two I did in Nashville, the first one was in Jordan Brooke Hamlin’s basement. We did that in about a week, and then we decided to make another record together. And at this point Jordan is working out of a studio called Moxe, that is a really beautiful, amazing place. We took a lot longer to make this record. The one before was very quick. This one we made over in chunks over a year and a half or so. Yeah, it was a great experience.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nDoes location impact your songwriting?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYes. There’s a lot of place in a lot of my songs probably because I spend a lot of time driving around, so there’s a lot of wherever I am seeps into the songs. Most of these songs I wrote in New York, some of them I finished in Nashville. But the beauty of the location of the place where we made the record did play into the recording because for example, when I did my vocal, she has this recording room that faces the woods with these big windows. And so you do a take in the morning and it’s beautiful. You do a take at sunset and it just was very pleasurable to sing.\n\nAnd I think I sang in a slightly different way. You know how when you personally make a shift it feels big to you? Probably people who heard the record maybe didn’t notice that. But for me there were a lot of things about this record that were like a shift for me.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYour family has famously written about each other. It started with your father, one of his songs written shortly after Rufus was born as titled “Rufus is a Tit Man.” He also wrote about you several times, one song he wrote with your Aunt Terry after you were born as titled “Screaming Issue,” which is about your plaintive, constant crying. He also wrote, “I’d Rather Be Lonely”, about your sister Martha, who countered with her own song to him “Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole” which I’ve actually seen her perform live and it is just a tour de force.\n\nRufus has written Lucy’s Blue for you. Have you written any songs about any members of your family?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI have, largely I’ve stayed out of any controversy amongst the family in part because my writing can be a bit vague sometimes, so maybe they haven’t noticed. This record has a song that is about my family on it as a whole.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd you’re talking about Little Beast, your new album?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYes. And the song is called “The City,” and I wrote it on a night where the whole family was together in New York. I think it might’ve been my dad’s a record release of his, I was on tour with the Indigo Girls and I had a night off and I had considered flying home to be in this show that my brother and my sister and my other sister who isn’t a performer was going to be in, and my mom, and my aunt, and everybody was going to be in it. And I decided not to go, and it was a hard decision.\n\nAnd so I had a night off in Petoskey, Michigan on the Indigo Girls Tour, and I sat in the hotel and I wrote “The City,” and that is about the family-\n\nPART 3 OF 4 ENDS [00:45:04]\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI wrote “The City,” and that is about the family business, I would say.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nIt’s interesting because the song is about the pressure and uncertainty of life as a touring musician. And after I listened to it, I actually went to your website to see your tour dates and it seems as if you’re on the road all the time. It seems as if you did 200+ shows last year.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, I’m away a lot. I’m trying to shift that a little bit just for…\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nSanity’s sake?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYes.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nSo it’s interesting because it was vague enough where I really thought it was about your life and not the life of your family.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah. Yeah. It’s sort of about the circus of the whole situation and everybody’s writing about each other and how people’s lives and relationships and pain seep into the work that they do and stuff.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nDoes it ever bother you that there’s so much about your childhood and upbringing in a lot of the songs of your family?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nNo. Honestly, it is hard for me to imagine what my concept of my close family members would be if you subtracted the songs because I listened to all those people’s records and usually you don’t have that kind of a window into people’s inner life or work in that particular way. And so it’s hard for me to imagine my dad without knowing his work because he’s talked so much about himself in his work, and so it’s kind of valuable information to have.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYeah. I think the only other thing that comes close is Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors, which everybody loved to sort of read into. Was this about Mick? Was this about Lindsay? Was this about Christine? Was it about Stevie and Mick? Or Stevie and Lindsay?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nTotally.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nBut yet that’s your life all the time. That was one album in the 70s.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nRight. And this is true about music with everyone, not just the family, but everyone has their own relationship to these songs. You take them into a private space and you experience them. So I recently was in LA singing some backup for a show that Rufus was recording for Audible for a project he’s doing with them. And we did one of my dad’s songs, “Your mother and I,” which he wrote about me or addressed to me when my parents were splitting up. And amongst the siblings, we haven’t probably discussed a lot of everyone’s feelings about the songs, but he chose the songs and he was going to sing that song. And during rehearsal he started to sing it and he just burst into tears. We had to stop.\n\nAnd it was interesting because we just all are having our own emotional reaction to everyone’s work, and it’s private also, so you might not know. I wouldn’t have thought that would happen. But it’s also a great thing to be able to appreciate each other’s work where I think we’re different enough that we don’t get in each other’s way, but we can still collaborate, which is a nice balance, I think.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYour third album, your most recent album is titled Little Beasts. It was released last October. I think it is maybe your saddest, but definitely your most extraordinary album yet. I think we really see your evolution as a singer and a songwriter and a performer, and the confidence in your lyrics is just beautiful. The song “Quit With Me” is a duet with Matthew Perryman Jones. It’s about two people who love each other very much, but must break up. The tune, “5th of July” looks back at how you felt during and after the 2016 presidential election. The album is really quite extraordinary and I believe it shows your brilliance in a way that is really singular among the Wainwright Roches.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThank you.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nCongratulations on this release.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWhat made you decide to release this album on your own?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI’ve never worked with a record company. I’ve always just called up the Printing Plant in New Jersey and had the records pressed and sold them. That has been my business model. I sort of live in this funny little section of the music business that’s still alive where people buy records. I think they buy them mostly so that you’ll sign them and you can talk while you sign them. I don’t know how many people put them into a CD player, but owning my own music has been the key to staying afloat for me.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI was wondering if you could do one last song for us before you leave?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nSure.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nMy favorite song on the album is titled “Heroin,” which isn’t exactly about what it sounds like it’s a crafty little song. Can you tell us about it and then play it for us?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nSure. I think this whole record is probably the most personal record that I’ve made, and part of that is that I just decided, lyrically I wasn’t as constrained as I normally am. I let myself say some things that I wouldn’t normally or I didn’t kind of edit things out that I might’ve shied away from before.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAny examples of what you’re talking about?\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, I mean, I think the song “Heroin” is probably one of my most personal songs. It’s completely autobiographical and it’s painful, and I didn’t stop that from existing. Again, it may not show up that way to others, but to me it felt like it was a vulnerable thing for me. The whole record was kind of like that, but definitely that song. I love it when I hear that somebody connected to that song because I mean, I love it when I hear that anybody’s connected to any of the songs. It seems like a miracle and it’s such a great thing, but that song meant a lot to me, and so you hope when you put them out in the world, someone will hear that or it will mean something to someone.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nIt very well may be my favorite of your songs, so there you have that.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThat’s so great. Let me see. But yeah, this song has some place in it. This has some driving in it, some place in it. Have you ever driven on the Million Dollar Highway in Colorado?\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYes.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIt’s so scary.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nIt’s really scary. I’ve driven cross country and there were moments on that road where actually I was driving with someone else and we were taking turns, so when one of us wasn’t driving, we’d be sleeping. And there was a moment where I was like, “Okay, you got to wake up because I can’t do this by myself.”\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, it’s quite harrowing and I like driving, but it was a little bit too scary, which I guess is what the song’s about (singing). I didn’t say this, but actually I’ve gotten some letters from people who are really concerned that I have a heroin addiction thing, which is actually not, I feel like if you really listen to the song, it doesn’t seem like that, but people are worried.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nWell, I mean, it does say the word heroin in it.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nIt’s true.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nI’m sure Lorde got the same thing even though she was not talking about it at all.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, totally.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nAnd then those that did didn’t.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah, right. I don’t think that a lot of people know that the “Needle and the Damage done” is a song about heroin and Neil Young’s struggle with it.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYeah, probably not. But there you have it.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nEveryone’s all, but I guess that’s the mystery of understanding.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nBut I was concerned enough to go and look at the lyrics, not because I was worried, but just because I wanted to know the history of the song and really understand what you were talking about or singing about.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nYeah. My friend said to me that sentence, she said, “It’s like saying Happy birthday heroin. Going back into something you should stay away from.” So she said that, and then I was like, “You’re right.”\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nCool.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nI have a lot of problems, but that’s not one that happens to be not one of them.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche, thank you for making such beautiful work and sharing it with the world.\n\nLucy Wainwright Roche:\n\nThank you so much.\n\nDebbie Millman:\n\nYou can find out more about Lucy’s music and concerts on her website, LucyWainwrightroche.com. It is now the 15th anniversary of Design Matters, and I’d like to thank you for listening all these years. And remember, we can talk about making a difference, we can make a difference, or we can do both. I’m Debbie Millman and I look forward to talking with you again soon."
