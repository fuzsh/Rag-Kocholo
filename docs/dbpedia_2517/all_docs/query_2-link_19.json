While the Wainwright sisters, Martha Wainwright and Martha Wainwright Working On Memoir\n\nThe Wainwright sisters released their debut album just a few weeks ago (Nov. 13), featuring lullabies, folks songs, and some covers. Billboard is premiering a video for their cover of “El Condor Pasa (If I Could),” a track popularized by Simon & Garfunkel on their 1970 album Bridge Over Troubled Water.\n\nOf the new video, Martha Wainwright tells Billboard, “My friend Kathleen Weldon made this video using some footage from a recent road trip out west. She also incorporated my kids in the video, which was really fun. Like this record, this video is a family affair. I think this video represents the song beautifully.”"
