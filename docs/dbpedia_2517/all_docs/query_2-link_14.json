        "text": "Toronto, ON - May 5, 2022 - Last month, singer/songwriter Martha Wainwright released her highly anticipated memoir Stories I Might Regret Telling You and within a week of release, it was included on The National Best Sellers list. To accompany the release of her memoir, Martha released the digital deluxe edition of her latest album Love Will be Reborn earlier this month. A companion to the memoir, the five new tracks are talked about in the memoir, including 4 covers of her family’s songs and a reimagined version of the title track.\n\nSTREAM LOVE WILL BE REBORN DELUXE HERE\n\nToday, she shares the stunning live video of her version of Rufus Wainwright’s “Dinner at Eight” - stream/share the video below.\n\nThe deluxe edition includes moving renditions of “Thanksgiving” originally by Loudon Wainwright III, Martha’s father, “Dinner at Eight” by her brother Rufus Wainwright, “Go Leave” by her mother Kate McGarrigle and more. Diving into recording these tracks Martha explains:\n\n“Recorded at URSA in front of a small audience of friends these are songs that I talk about in my memoir Stories I Might Regret Telling You. They relate to family and its complexity, as well as pain, feelings of loss, and ultimately forgiveness and acceptance. I have heard them my whole life and now I have the chance to sing them. Recorded in a live setting and in a very striped down and exposed way, with my good friend and wonderful piano player Edwin de Goeij, we had only just learned to sing and play them and are exploring with the listener in the moment. A sometimes bumpy and emotional ride, these recordings are about the words and the meaning. The songs speak for themselves and they are songs of our time about modern family and some of the trials of life.”\n\nStories I Might Regret Telling You A Memoir (Martha Wainwright).\n\nThe singer-songwriter’s heartfelt memoir about growing up in a bohemian musical family and her experiences with love, loss, motherhood, divorce, the music industry, and more.\n\nOut March 29, 2022.\n\nBuy Now\n\nBorn into music royalty, the daughter of folk legends Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III and sister to the highly acclaimed, genre-defying singer Rufus Wainwright, Martha grew up in a world filled with incomparable musical legends—Anna McGarrigle, Leonard Cohen, Suzzy Roche, Richard and Linda Thompson, Emmylou Harris—and struggled to find her voice in a milieu in which every drama was refracted through song. Then, in 2005, she released her critically acclaimed debut album, Martha Wainwright, containing the blistering hit, “Bloody Mother F*cking Asshole,” which the Sunday Times called one of the best songs of that year. That release, and the albums that followed, such as Come Home to Mama and I Know You’re Married But I’ve Got Feelings Too, showcased Martha’s searing songwriting style and established her as a powerful voice to be reckoned with.\n\nMartha digs into her life with the same emotional honesty that has come to define her music. She describes her tumultuous public-facing journey from awkward, earnest, and ultimately rebellious daughter, through her intense competition and ultimate alliance with her brother, Rufus, to finding her voice as an artist and the indescribable loss of their mother, Kate. With candor and grace, Martha writes of becoming a mother herself, finally understanding and facing the challenge of being a female artist with children. Stories I Might Regret Telling You is a thoughtful, moving account of the extraordinary life of one of the most talented singer-songwriters in music today."
