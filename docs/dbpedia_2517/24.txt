Martha Wainwright and Lucy Wainwright Roche are back with a new album, Songs in the Dark, which comes out on 13 November. Featuring songs made famous by Woody Guthrie, Jimmy Rodgers, and their father Loudon Wainwright, the record looks back at tunes that shaped the sisters’ childhoods. One of those songs, the gorgeous and dryly humorous “Lullaby”, can be heard below.

“Our dad’s song ‘Lullaby’ is about him and his insomnia,” Martha says. “Leave it to the man to write the lullaby about himself! Its words are pitch perfect and it is a great lullaby for any

child, young or old.”
