        "text": "This paper is part of a research project aimed at investigating and analysing the innovations, changes and influences initiated by the Hellenic Open University of Greece., which is the only one that exclusively offers education through the distance education model and has influenced the way and methodology of providing short or long study programs by higher education institutions. Due to the large offer of distance education programs (hereafter from D.E), there is a concern regarding the implementation practices of this education model by conventional higher education institutions in areas that make up the physiognomy and the pedagogy of the DE. The purpose, goals, and innovative elements of H.O.U. are presented initially. & the changes in offering quality curriculum provision. In addition, its influences in fourteen H.E.I of conventional education in relation to her physiognomy from DE. Finally, indicative groups of questions are recorded, which will be asked to the teaching staff of both the H.O.U and conventional higher education institutions in Greece to study the research results in depth. The research so far has been carried out at a bibliographic level, as well as a study of the information provided by the universities through their web pages. The interviews with the teaching staff are considered necessary so that the practical effect of distance education on conventional structures in the country becomes apparent.\n\nEconomic and social achievements at the end of the 20th century led to the transition to a global economy that underlines knowledge's enormous contribution to its development. Higher education has been transitioning from the traditional learning model to a new one for some time. Implementing the distance education (D.E.) model requires careful planning, mainly when applied to conventional education structures. The Hellenic Open University (H.O.U.) offered and still offers thousands of people the opportunity to study. Still, at the same time, it impacted conventional academic education. This paper presents within the framework of the program \"Funding of research in the H.O.U.\", the research project financed by it and aimed at the investigation and analysis of the innovations, changes and influences that started from H.O.U. and had an effect on the way of offering short or long study programs from higher education institutions. After presenting the reasons why conventional universities provide more and more distance programs, the purpose of the research project and methodology are recorded. Then, the influences traditional higher education has received from distance learning in foreign universities are presented. Then the first results of the research are presented, while the different ways of applying the elements of distance education and often the deficiency of the pedagogical approach are highlighted.\n\nInteraction in distance education is significant, mainly because the learner participates actively in the learning process while the teacher has a facilitating role. Educational activities and Group Counselling Sessions (GCS) identify and define the interaction while promoting knowledge acquisition. They are one of the most critical elements of the educational material intended for distance education and are related to the philosophy of distance education. The paper is presented in the context of the program \"Funding of Research in Hellenic Open University\". It aims to investigate and analyse the innovations, modifications and influences that started from the H.O.U and impacted the way and methodology of offering short or long-term study programs by conventional higher education institutions. Also, the differences or problems from implementing six-month thematic units compared with the annual ones in postgraduate study programs offered by the university. During the first two semesters of the research, the study has been based on the bibliography in the areas related to teaching, learning, educational material, communication, the role of the teacher, and support structures. The findings so far highlight the significant effects and changes that distance education has had on the operation of traditional education structures and the curricula they offer. On the other hand, it is clear from the research that until now, there have been no data on the educational activities or Group Counselling Sessions (GCS) that would enlighten us on the functioning of the six-monthly themes in the framework of interaction. So, the bibliographic research will be accompanied by interviews with teaching staff about the impact of H.O.U on conventional education and the operation of the semester's themes related to annual ones. The results will be essential in improving the existing application of the characteristics of distance education's effectiveness, regardless of the educational structure.\n\nIn this study, the opinions of the undergraduate, graduate and PhD students were taken who study in the special education department about the certificate programs opened by distance education for the individuals with physical, visual and hearing impairment. The Qualitative research method was used in the research. In this context, the researchers prepared the interview questions used in the research. 40 volunteer students from the Department of teaching who were mentally handicapped, MA and PHD programs for the special education have attended the research at the Near East University during 2015- 2016-fall semester. The answers given by the students to the questions within the scope of the research were re-examined with the expert opinion and the results were later interpreted by using the induction technique. According to the results of this research, the provided education by distance education method with 24 hour access without time and space limitation gives great advantage to d...\n\nThe focus of the project undertaken is to comprehend, what is the research magistracy in education in the twenty -fi rst century. Since the 1990s, when the master’s level of training fi rst appeared in the Russian education system, a search was made for its place and role in the system of training highly qualifi ed personnel for the education system. The central problem of the current stage of the master education development is a triple conjunction: understanding the relationship between research and educational activities; the refl ection of the contexts, conditions and limitations of research activity in the fi eld of education; and the creation of new research programs based on humanitarian discourses in the second half of the twentieth century. The conceptual foundations of the project were built in connection with the ideas of T. Kuhn’s “scientifi c paradigms” and I. Lakatos’s “research programs”, which made it possible to establish a correspondence between different education...\n\nThis study examines a) the methods used to structure the pedagogy necessary to underpin distance education delivery used by the Hellenic Open University (HOU); b) the adoption of pedagogical and epistemological conceptual systems HOU uses for the development of its pedagogical practices; and c) the role of information and communication technology (ICT), and the degree of ICTs incorporation into distance education delivery at HOU. This study shows that: a) in terms of providing rigorous course contents, strong framing exists between HOU’s various learning modules; b) in terms of pedagogical practices, there is a strong hierarchical relationship and framing between HOU’s academic staff and tutors, while conversely, framing is weaker between its tutors and students; c) in terms of ICT usage HOU, in general, uses technology for administration, while conversely, and depending on the program of study, it currently only has limited use for student learning.\n\nThis publication focuses on the practice of implementing non-standard approaches to standardized educational processes. The involvement of students in the practical study of the possibilities of using a virtual classroom not only as a basic model for the transfer and testing of knowledge, but also to improve the emotional response and involvement in the educational process. This is due to the inclusion of art therapy technologies, its elements, and individual practice-oriented exercises in the structure of classes, which are inherently training.That is why in this publication we turned to the demonstration of the results of the survey, interviews with the participants of our classes. In particular, not only those with whom we have been working consistently and systematically for more than one year, but also those who study under other programs without the inclusion of the technologies and exercises we offer. In addition, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method of managing th..."
