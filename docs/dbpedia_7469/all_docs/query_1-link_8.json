        "text": "I’ve seen thousands of reviews over the years, but this actually explains “A Deadhead”…\n\n“REVIEW: stella\n\nAs a new fan of the Dead it was years before I realized the importance of the tears streaming down\n\nthe face of the girl beside me. She seemed to be having a religious experience. Now I know why”\n\nAnd a headzup, folks! these next few days are some of this country’s “amateur days”, so keep a\n\nsharp eye out all over!\n\nGrateful Dead\n\nSt. Paul Civic Center, St. Paul, Minnesota\n\nJuly 3, 1978\n\nLow-gen Audience Cassette\n\nSet 1: TDK SA-90; Set 2: Maxell UDXL-II C90) Cassette(Nakamichi DR-1)\n\nBroadcasting superb audience recordings of official releases two weeks running! Longtime\n\nlisteners will know that I do not broadcast commercially-released material, but am not averse to\n\nbroadcasting a worthy audience recording. In 2016, a 5-show, 12-CD box set of the complete\n\nGrateful Dead shows at Kansas City on July 1, 1978, St. Paul on July 3, 1978, Omaha on July 5,\n\n1978, and Morrison on July 7 & 8, 1978. This, folks, is an excellent audience recording!\n\nDisc 1 – Set 1:\n\n1. tuning\n\n2. New Minglewood Blues\n\n3. Loser\n\n4. Looks Like Rain\n\n5. Ramble On Rose\n\n6. Mexicali Blues >\n\n7. Mama Tried\n\n8. Peggy-O\n\n9. Cassidy\n\n10. Deal >\n\n11. The Music Never Stopped\n\nDisc 2 – Set 2:\n\n1. tuning\n\n2. Scarlet Begonias >\n\n3. Fire on the Mountain\n\nDisc 3 – Set 2 cont’d.:\n\n1. Dancin’ in the Streets >\n\n2. Drums >\n\n3. Not Fade Away >\n\n4. Stella Blue >\n\n5. Sugar Magnolia\n\nEncore:\n\n6. tuning\n\n7. Werewolves of London\n\nREVIEW: Packed with goodies\n\nThis show is excellent. Among many highlights is a surging rendition of Peggy-O. Well worth\n\nthe listen. Thanks for the up.\n\nREVIEW: Most like Being there source\n\nFuller sound on the high end than the other sources, which sound like they are stuck right into a\n\nmonitor & biased toward the low mid range. Patch in Fire around 6:00 shows the 2 sources\n\nside-by-side. This one has got to be very close to what it sounded like in the show. Crisp,\n\ncaptures the hall & some limited crowd during songs & great stuff between. Very nice for ’78. I\n\nhave a Red Rocks that is the same tapers & quality.\n\n“Standard” show for ’78. Nice Music No Stop; Chills from Fire and some bubble gum undersea\n\nraging on Dancin’ that will bring a tear to your eye. You can tell they are building up to the Red\n\nRocks meltdown. 4* for overall crystal clear insight into a ’70s Dead experience.\n\nREVIEW: hot show!\n\nThe show itself is sh*t-hot and deserves more recognition. High energy playing from start to\n\nfinish with a first set capped by a fantastic run of tunes and a sick Deal>TMNS to close. They\n\nkeep the energy high for S>F and Dancin, all excellent versions. Post-drumz still sounds plenty\n\njuiced, though maybe they were rushing to beat a curfew? Sweet Stella end jam, nevertheless.\n\nWerewolves is what it is, but they sure sound mighty happy to be there. Don’t snooze on this\n\nshow!\n\nREVIEW: The beats man\n\nThe rhythms on a lot of these tunes: Mexicali, Mama, Peggy, has a really cool groove going on I\n\nhadn’t heard before. Very fun concert and a killer aud mix.\n\nReviews of other recordings(there are just three…):\n\nREVIEW: 4 1/2 stars\n\nummm The Music Never Stopped !\n\nREVIEW: Agree 4.5 stars\n\nfor towering FIRE and one of the best DANCIN’S alone – THIS DANCIN IS OFF THE HOOK.\n\nStella is sick and Sugar Mag is as well. Sound quality is a 2 but lets overlook that for the time as\n\nit is a ’78 audience that has been stepped all over. Mwood, Loser, Ramble on Rose are\n\nEXCEPTIONAL in fact this first set is yet another Minnesota barn burner. Check out Bobby\n\nblow the lyrics of Mama Tried – everyone is ripped. The PEGGY-O is really beautiful and one of\n\nthe best I have heard recently, it is so melodic. Cassidy & DEal are 2 more crushers, Then there is\n\nMUSIC….\n\nREVIEW: red and white,blue swede shoes!!!\n\nwow! what a show,30 years ago,i just got out of high school and was hooked on the dead, and a\n\nfew other impressive tidbits in life.like my sweet jelly roll!!!All my love to you,7 times upstairs\n\nand we cried for more.deep deep love,one day,we’ll do it again. Jam on.\n\nREVIEW: Phil Says at beginning of Werewolves\n\n“Whoever is throwing those firecrackers especially those ones on stage, belongs at a Ted Nugent\n\nconcert, not here.” Brilliant!\n\n“Today’s Dead Tomorrow”, Upcoming Gig Events\n\nAs always, verify with the venue…\n\nRemember, folks, to call the venue to see if they are indeed open in the\n\nfirst place, and the event is going on as scheduled, and what protocols are in place.\n\nDead Set Florida:\n\nMotorworks Brewing, Fri., July 7th, 7:00 – 11:00 p.m.\n\n1014 9th St. W., Bradenton, 896-9892\n\nKettle Of Fish:\n\nStottlemyer’s Smokehouse, Sun., July 9th, 4:00 – 7:00 p.m.\n\n19 East Rd., Sarasota, 312-5969\n\nDana Lawrence:\n\nTruman’s Tap & Grill.
