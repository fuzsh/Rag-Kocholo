        "text": "Online broadcasting, online music services, portable music players, digital receivers, mobile phones and podcasts are different ways to access music and entertainment. All these platforms represent a whole new scenario for media and forces radio to change the business and communication model, transforming the radio concept we used to know. MP3 players for instance, or devices such as mobile phones are shifting the balance of power away from radio as tastemaker toward consumers' ability to select, hoard and arrange their music. Multimedia is changing radio discourse. Radio listening gave way to online navigation and interaction. To where does all this lead us? The proposed abstract will focus on the transfiguration of audio contents, both in terms of journalism, entertainment and advertising, as well as the mutation of the listener in direction of a relation between the one who listens to radio and is also a web user of radio websites, presenting the concept of R@dio, as a definition for the new broadcasting context in the 21st century.\n\nThis dissertation concentrates on the changing form of the music commodity over the last two decades. Specifically, it traces the transition from music on compact discs to music as a digital file on computers/mobile devices and the economic, industrial, aesthetic and cultural consequences this shift has for how we produce, present, and consume music. As computers became viable sources for the playback of popular music in the 1980s and 1990s, the roots of the digital music commodity took hold. Stripped of many of their previous attributes (i.e. album art, compressed sound, packaging, etc.), recordings as digital files were initially decontextualized commodities. On computers, music underwent an interface-lift, gradually getting redressed with new features (i.e. metadata, interfaces, digital “packaging”). This dissertation focuses on five technologies – Winamp, Metadata, Napster, iTunes and Cloud Computing – that were key to rehabilitating the music commodity in its digital environments. These technologies and the cultural practices that accompanied them gave music new paratexts and micromaterials that ultimately constituted the digital music commodity. Through case studies, archival research, and descriptive analysis, this study makes methodological and intellectual contributions to the field of communication and technology studies as well as to studies of new media and the cultural industries. By teasing out the differences between the commodity aspects of the CD and the digital file, this project offers fresh perspectives on materiality, aesthetics, labour and ownership in an era of digital goods. Digital music’s fluid and ubiquitous nature seems to subvert those who seek to profit from it. But while digital music offers the potential to disrupt the traditional ways of doing business in music, it also affords new forms of control and power. This has not stopped artists, hobbyists and users from carrying out creative experiments that call into question the codes and conventions of the digital music commodity. In doing so, they make visible the promise of digital music: to turn our attention to the commodification process and to force a reconsideration of the role music plays in the contemporary moment.\n\nAbstract: Audio streaming has been a major application, which has become popular in past few years especially amongst youth both in professional and personal lives. Various organizations to develop and deploy their own cloud, and their meeting most of them are in the same cloud, holding a variety of audio codecs to be used for real-time streaming. The concept of cloud computing has been proposed from the device to the cloud computing power, storage, and security unloading resource requirements. Internet audio applications such as real-time streaming is expected to be ubiquitous in the cloud users, they often encounter a diverse range of wireless access technology, wireless networks, roaming and in their closed position and support the work of the deployment. FLAC, MP3 and WAV streams are used for real-time streaming. In this paper, we analyze the various quality parameters, FLAC, MP3 and WAV format audio streams in different environmental conditions, they deliver quality performance Key Words: Cloud, Audio, Streaming, FLAC, MP3\n\nIn this paper, I draw from ongoing research which critically examines the Spotify music recommendation system. It looks towards some of the problems associated with automated music discovery and algorithmic mediations of culture. I engage specifically with questions relating to online music discovery and ask 1) How does Spotify automate music discovery?; 2) How is Spotify incorporating established trends in music consumption into the platform?; and 3) how is this case study emblematic of the emerging politics of algorithmic culture? These questions are considered in relation to Bolter & Grusin’s (2000) notion of re-mediation, where I argue that the Spotify platform is a remediation of the music technologies and established music trends that came before it. By applying Lev Manovich’s (2001) principles of new media objects to the digital music commodity, this thesis traces the history of music technologies, and considers some of the ramifications for music becoming digital."
