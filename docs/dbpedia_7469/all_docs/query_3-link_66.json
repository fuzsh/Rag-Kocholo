        "text": "[Local Artists] Ringling College Graphic Design Senior Finds a Home\n\nAiham Kara Hawa was a small boy in 2011 when protests erupted in Syria. Then the bullets started flying. “Some nights you could hear gunshots,” he remembers. By mid-2012 things had gotten so bad that he, his mother and two siblings fled to Lebanon, then Egypt. They tried to establish themselves there for a year, but Egypt too found itself mired in political upheaval and widespread violence. By the time his father tried to join them in Egypt, the country had stopped accepting refugees from Syria, so the family reunited in Turkey. They learned Turkish, Kara Hawa and his siblings enrolled in Turkish schools and his parents found work, but their relative peace and stability in Turkey would be replaced by a different struggle. “By the time we got to Egypt I knew I was gay,” says Kara Hawa, “and that got me in a lot of trouble with my family.” To protect himself, he told his family it was just a phase. By 16, he had already fled a warzone in Syria and avoided the fallout of a coup in Egypt—now he had to flee to be himself. “I felt isolated and defeated,” he says.\n\nThen he heard about United World College, a charity with 18 schools and colleges around the world that offer two-year residential programs for people aged 16-19. Graduates attain an IB diploma and can specialize in any number of subjects—Kara Hawa applied and got a full scholarship to the Maastricht campus in the Netherlands. “I had the time of my life,” he says, “everything was new and liberating.” He studied graphic design and in 2016 when it came time to pick from among hundreds of colleges and universities affiliated with UWC, he chose a little art and design school in Sarasota. “I applied, Ringling gave me a scholarship and I’ve been here ever since,” he says. But getting here and staying has had its own obstacles.\n\nIt took two visa applications before he was approved. Then in 2018, the embassy closed in Syria and his visa renewal looked unlikely. Asylum would be his only path to remaining in the US in a protected, long-term status, but there were no lawyers around that could take his case pro bono. In his desperation, he turned to GoFundMe to try and raise money for one. “I never thought it would work,” he says, “but in one week we raised $9000.” Last summer he interviewed at an immigration office in Miami and just last month, on March 16th, learned his asylum application was approved. “Now I’m technically an asylee,” he says, “I have a driver’s license, a work permit, and in a year I can apply for a green card and work towards citizenship.”\n\nKara Hawa is poised to graduate amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, but the pandemic hardly seems to register as a concern. “I think what happened in Syria prepared me for this,” he says, “and [COVID-19] is easier to live through than a warzone.” With internet, water, electricity and safety, he has a lot to be grateful for. “I just try not to take it for granted,” he says. After graduation he has something else to be grateful for: his first career with a design firm. “It’s so rare for people from my background to get this far,” he says, “but so many people have been supportive of my journey and I’m so excited to make Florida my home.”\n\nPhoto by Matthew Holler.\n\nFor more about Aiham Kara Hawa.\n\n[Art Online] Art Center Sarasota Brings Art to the Community\n\nWhen Art Center Sarasota had to close suddenly in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the center’s staff quickly went to work to find ways to make the art a virtual reality. The center had just installed four ground-breaking exhibits when it shut its doors. “The artists in our curated and juried exhibits were extremely disappointed that they wouldn’t get the audiences they expected to see their work,” says curator Nathan Skiles. Curator Dustin Juengel says that solo exhibiting artists “spend over a year creating a new body of work just for their exhibit here. To give these artists some of the attention they deserve, we decided to make video tours of all the galleries.” With this challenge, exhibitions coordinator Danielle Dygert went to work videotaping every piece of art in the building. She created gallery tours of each gallery, collected voiceovers from the solo artists and edited it all into four separate tours. The juried show tour is especially creative as she held the camera on each piece, assigned a number and included a gallery guide on Art Center Sarasota’s website that informs viewers of the artist, title and price of each piece. Elizabeth Goodwill, the center’s education director, gathered her team to design online educational programs for adults and children. They created “Art Café,” currently offering free interactive art activities that features art projects, creative challenges and art inspirations from staff members. Her team is also working on designing interactive art classes and artist demonstrations. Goodwill is also preparing online discussion groups, including the popular “Salon d’Art,” and a new discussion group based on New York Magazine art critic Jerry Saltz’s book, How to be an Artist. The team is also working on projects specifically for children in the event that the center’s Creative Kids Summer camp is not available this year. “One of the bonuses of creating all of this online content is that it can be utilized even after the pandemic is over,” says Goodwill. “Individuals, senior centers and anyone who is homebound can enjoy doing art projects, see our galleries or listen to talks whenever they need a diversion or a lift.” “I am so impressed with the creative and technical skills of my team,” says Lisa Berger, Art Center Sarasota’s executive director. “This was truly a group effort on the part of the entire staff. Using video conferencing we were able to meet regularly to brainstorm and maintain the comradery and collaborative efforts we have when we are all together in person.\"\n\nVisit the exhibits online and access lessons online.\n\n[Change to the Season] Asolo Rep Announces Changes to 2020-21 Season\n\nAsolo Rep announced today that one of the plays originally named as part of its 2020-21 season has been taken out of the lineup. Originally scheduled to perform in the Cook Theatre in March/April 2021 “Trayf,” by Lindsay Joelle, has been canceled. The change was made for budgetary reasons related to show cancellations this season due to the COVID-19 virus. \"The change was a heartbreaking one to make, but we realized we needed to remove “Trayf” from the schedule to ensure that we could meet the production needs of the other seven plays on the season roster,” said Michael Donald Edwards, Producing Artistic Director. “At this time, we remain open to the possibility of replacing it with a different production in the Cook Theatre during the 2020-21 season, and we very much look forward to producing “Trayf” in a future season.\" Celine Rosenthal, originally named as the director of “Trayf,” will now direct “Grand Horizons” in place of Giovanna Sardelli.\n\nAsolo Rep 2020-21 Season\n\nBILLY ELLIOT THE MUSICAL: November 18 – January 2. Ken Ludwig’s THE THREE MUSKETEERS: January 13 – March 13. GRAND HORIZONS: January 20 – March 15. OUR TOWN: February 10 – March 27. HOOD: April 9 ­– May 1. KNOXVILLE: May 14 – June 5.

All of the musicians have been trained by PMP, and many are alumni of the Winter Residency program presented on the USF Sarasota-Manatee campus, so they are familiar to our community and audiences! A kind of wonderful full circle of training-to-performance, all here in our area!\n\nWith invaluable support from our sponsors, donors, and members, Perlman Suncoast produces at least three week-long PMP Alumni visits annually, with many events, including all school visits, remaining free of charge. This year, despite postponing our April events, we were able to reach a record number of audience members up and down the Suncoast!\n\nLast November, the PMP Alumni ensemble named the Sara Quartet joined us. They delighted audiences in two school auditoriums, four music classrooms, and eight community venues over the course of a very busy week. From the string students in the master class at Booker High School at the crack of dawn (7:30am!) to the 1200 people in lawn chairs at Marie Selby Botanical Gardens on a sunny Sunday afternoon, the Sara Quartet brought smiles to the young and young-at-heart!\n\nAs for the impact on a more personal level, our local students were excited to see and meet the Sara Quartet and teachers shared glowing reports about how much the visits meant to their students. As for the community performances, the positive energy and buzz of excitement from our audience members seemed to grow with each event - a testimonial to the musicians' exceptional talent, skills, and charm.\n\nSo with that in mind, you are in for a treat as we bring you our \"Notes\" for this week! Scroll down to find this week’s Perlman Suncoast Presents: In Your Home, linking you to a recording of the Sara Quartet performing live during a broadcast radio interview with Russell Gant in the Classical WSMR Radio studio. Included with this interview is a performance of two movements from Dvorak's \"American Quartet.\" The Sara Quartet plays these pieces so sweetly, we feel sure this beautiful music will brighten your day!\n\nAs a quick reminder, Perlman Suncoast will be participating in the 2020 Giving Challenge taking place next week, April 28-29, noon to noon (24 hours ONLY). Gifts $25-$100 are eligible for a 1:1 match thanks to the generosity of The Patterson Foundation. All gifts will support presenting Perlman Suncoast education outreach programs like the ones featured in today's email. -- Also worth noting, part of the Cares Act expands charitable giving tax deductions.

When she and her brother, Bruce Cassidy, Jr., were teens, they participated in 4-H and Quarter Horse shows throughout high school and college. Sherry enjoyed spending time in equestrian activities, and it helped her to overcome her shyness. It was a family affair that the entire family enjoyed, including her parents, Bruce Sr. and Cynthia Cassidy.\n\nAs time passed and the Cassidy’s settled in to the Bradenton/Sarasota area from Ohio, finding a horse-centered organization to give back to was an easy choice. The family was introduced to the Sarasota Manatee Association for Riding Therapy (SMART) in 2011 by the Manatee Community Foundation. They have been partnering with SMART for nearly a decade now, covering veterinary bills, adopting horses, and supporting programs. They even donated “Buddy Cassidy”, a beautiful Paint Horse that quickly became a favorite with SMART’s riders, children and adults with special needs who find connection and healing through these majestic animals.\n\nSMART’s brand-new executive director, Rebecca Blitz, hasn’t met the Cassidy’s yet. In fact, she hasn’t met any of her donor partners or volunteers, but it’s not for a lack of desire. When she took the reins at SMART on April 1, it was more than two weeks into one of the most challenging periods of our lives—the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Having already canceled SMART’s major fundraiser of the year in March, Blitz has quickly found herself in need of some horse-loving angels who can help support the herd of fifteen animals who continue to need feed, care and veterinary services, even though the facility is closed to protect the health of students and volunteers.\n\nResponding to the call for help was an easy choice for the Cassidy’s, whose Concession Charities 501(c)(3) organization had just come off of their successful Archie Griffin Celebrity Golf Classic fundraising event at The Concession Golf Club in early March to help organizations that support young people. Concession Charities last week provided SMART with a $20,000 check to help care for their horses, which will cover just about a month and a half of feed, boarding and veterinary services.\n\n“Not knowing how long this situation will last is what’s most scary about what we’re facing,” Blitz explained. “This gift from Concession Charities gives us a bit more time to find additional support to care for our horses so that they can be ready to bring a sense of peace and normalcy to our students when they return to ride. We are truly grateful.”\n\nBecause their biggest fundraiser of the year was canceled in March, SMART could use more donations to help keep horses healthy and ensure that their programs are up and running as soon as possible once our community is safe. The organization could also benefit from additional volunteers when they reopen to help out around the barn to support those who currently give their time to care for the horses and may need to shelter at home for a bit more time once restrictions are lifted.\n\nTo keep up-to-date with videos on daily happenings at SMART, join Rebecca Blitz on their Facebook feed at Facebook.com/SmartRiders. For volunteer information, visit SmartRiders.org or call 941-322-2000. And consider making a donation from noon to noon, April 28 through April 29, at GivingPartnerChallenge.org, where The Patterson Foundation will be providing a 1:1 match for donations from $25 up to $100 per individual donor.\n\nFor more info on SMART.\n\n[The Giving Challenge] The Ocean's Future is In Our Hands and Yours\n\nOn April 28-29, from noon to noon, we will once again participate in the community-wide day of giving known as the Giving Challenge.

From April 28 at noon to April 29 at noon all gifts from $25 to $100 will be matched 1:1. The 2020 Giving Challenge is presented by the Community Foundation of Sarasota County with giving strengthened by The Patterson Foundation.\n\nTo raise awareness about the important work The Players does all-year, they have started a social media campaign called #myplayersstory. With a 90-year history, The Players has shared numerous performances with the public, but the impact made by donors behind the scenes is personal. Through the #myplayersstory campaign, the community is sharing how The Players has made a difference in their life whether through a performance, volunteering, or education. Please visit Instagram and Facebook (@PlayersCentre) to read stories directly from Players volunteers. The Players Centre holds a special place in the heart of this community, and it’s abundantly clear when reading the words of The Players Centre family.\n\nIn addition to these heartfelt stories, check out some musical numbers and scenes from past shows. The quality and joy in the performances illustrates the commitment to live theatre The Players has provided for 90 years.\n\nCOVID-19 forced The Players to close multiple shows and The Players Studio. The financial losses are huge for a non profit community theatre. The Giving Challenge comes just in time to help overcome this crisis and remain prepared to continue The Players mission to entertain, educate and engage through high quality live theatre.\n\nDonate to The Players Centre.\n\n[Recognition] Sarasota Forest Champion \"Canopy Meg\" Selected for Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability Celebration of 50th Anniversary of Earth Day\n\nGlobe-trotting forest champion \"CanopyMeg\" -- Dr. Meg Lowman, Executive Director of the Sarasota-based TREE Foundation -- has been selected by Arizona State University's Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability as the special guest speaker during its month-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. ASU ranks top in the U.S. and fifth in the world in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and as an internationally-recognized thought-leader on global sustainability though forest conservation, Dr. Lowman will discuss the TREE Foundation's international mission to create 10 canopy walkways around the world using the Myakka River State Park canopy walkway, which the foundation built in 1999, as the model. The free, hour-long talk is part of the school's Wrigley Speaker Series and will be broadcast via Zoom and available to thousands of participants across the globe on Tuesday, April 28, 2 p.m., Mountain Standard Time. Online registration is required at https://asuevents.asu.edu/content/moved-online-life-treetops-adventures-woman-field-biology\n\nDr. Lowman was also featured in the Miami Herald on Earth Day, April 22, in an opinion essay she co-authored with famed oceanographer and marine activist Dr. Sylvia Earle. The op-ed marks the launch of the TREE Foundation's Mission Green initiative to save the planet by saving forests. The op-ed is found at https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article242176696.html.\n\nAn Adjunct Professor at ASU's School of Sustainability, Dr. Lowman's talk will also highlight whole-forest exploration and how research is used to create sustainability practices on local and global scales, such as designing canopy walkways to encourage ecotourism for local income instead of logging. The Myakka River State Park canopy walkway serves as a model for forest research and education across the globe.\n\nWrigley Lectures are typically presented in person on the ASU campus. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, ASU restructured the event as a virtual one with the potential to engage thousands more participants. The event will be re-broadcast in entirety on ASU's social media on Thursday, April 30 at 4 p.m., and again at 5:30 p.m., both in Mountain Standard Time.

While they run a very lean organization, you can imagine the devastating financial impact of this major event being cancelled. That’s why the organization was so thankful when they received $5,000 in matching funds to aid during the 24-hour Giving Challenge on April 28 & 29. During this online campaign, each gift up to $100, will be matched through giving strengthened by the Patterson Foundation, and will provide the funds necessary to keep Key Chorale strong and vital. Additionally, the first $5000 raised will be matched by the Huisking Foundation on behalf of Key Chorale.\n\nFunds raised through the Giving Challenge will help to get Key Chorale through this period when no revenues are coming in. “We are committed to being here for you and our community after this health crisis has passed. We vow to keep our entire community singing and to add beauty, hope, and healing to our world through music,” says Key Chorale’s Artistic Director, Joseph Caulkins. April and May are typically busy months for Key Chorale’s important community outreach with Visible Men Academy, an at-risk school for K-5 boys, in which Key Chorale brings music to 100 students who wouldn’t have a music program otherwise. Spring music sessions were cancelled due to school closures. Off-Key Chorale, for those living with Parkinson’s, and Where Are My Keys? Chorale, a choir for those dealing with memory loss, had to cancel their spring rehearsals. In the meantime, Key Chorale has moved to YouTube and launched its Come Together Choir, Online Choral Rehearsals, with more than 350 registered from all over the country – and beyond. These episodes help singers to feel connected and to continue to experience the transformative power of music in a time when we all need it more than ever.\n\nFor more info.\n\n[Frontline Support] Mattison’s Partners with Local Businesses to Deliver over 600 Meals to Frontline Heroes\n\nMattison’s has partnered with local businesses to provide meals for local healthcare workers and first responders who are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 30th, Mattison’s has prepared and delivered 620 meals to those helping keep everyone healthy and safe.\n\nChef Paul Mattison’s states, “This is a very trying time for many businesses but no one has it more difficult than the healthcare workers and first responders who are dealing with this unimaginable situation daily and often in close proximity to those who have the virus or may be contagious. We want to help in any way we can to show them how much we support and appreciate what they are doing. Feeding people is what we know how to do and what we do well so when we asked ourselves, what can we do to help, it was a no-brainer.”\n\nPartnering with local businesses to sponsor the meals seemed like a good way to allow them to be involved, making it as simple as saying yes to be a sponsor.

Many businesses are helping in other ways and we applaud everyone’s efforts to help our community deal with this terrible situation.”\n\nMattison’s will continue providing meals as long as they have the product to share.

During its initial “response” phase, the foundations have focused on strengthening the health and social safety net for those who are most susceptible to the devastating impacts of COVID-19. Many donors and funding partners such as Truist Foundation and the Selby Foundation have directed gifts through the initiative to leverage additional funding and realize a greater strategic impact.\n\n“BB&T/SunTrust, now Truist, stands ready to partner with our community businesses and organizations and face the COVID-19 challenges together,” said Mark Irwin, SVP and Market President for Manatee & Sarasota Counties, Truist. “The Truist Foundation grants, together with matching grants from Gulf Coast and Barancik Foundation’s COVID-19 Response Initiative, will help community organizations like All Faiths Food Bank address basic needs in our area and provide relief and rebuilding to those impacted.”\n\nFor those who wish to contribute much-needed funds to All Faiths Food Bank, it is important to note that the Food Bank can purchase five meals for every $1 given.
