Lfittnri tD 9>(3nr> edllreH AUGUST 8, IMS HELP FOR THE AFFLICTED A VICTORY won over great personal affliction is not only a victory for the person concerned but an immensely powerful inspiration for others similarly affected. Recently the remaining eye of the little American boy Mike Sibole was re- moved to save his life. At once 76-year-old Helen Keiler, blind and deaf since childhood, wrote a letter of encouragement to his parents. Of abl the messages of sympathy re- ceived by Mr. and Mrs. Sibole, none would be more comforting than Helen Keller's. What she wrote with warm assurance was that a joyful and rich life was still within the reach of their son. Her words will inspire not only the grieving hearts of the Siboles hut all parents who share the wsponsibitity of guiding an afflicted child to the fullest and most useful life, possible. The knowledge that another person has successfully overcome a similar dif- ficulty is Lhc most potent form of en- couragement. The legless R.A.F. hero Douglas Bader has time and again offered similar personal encouragement to amputees. The refusal of polio-stricken Australian singer Marjoric Lawrence to be beaten by her illness has been an inspiration to countless fellow sufferers. When Helen Keller wrote her letter of encouragement to the Siboles she was obeying the deep sense of rcsponsibilitv which those who have triumphed over affliction invariably have towards those who need help. Their example must inspire not only those to whom it is immediately applic- able, but all who hear of it. It is true that the afflicted can, with wise and loving care, develop a com- pensatory extra strength of spirit. Qui to give them the opportunity, the more fortunate must help.

You'll know when you have someone of your own.\" \"But il isn't as if 1 haven't met anyune yet. How did yon know that Bruce waj different?\" Susan laughed, anil a Hush rati into her pretty cheeks. \"Weil, he said he loved me, ol course\" Margcit frowned in dissatisfaction. \"Oh, dear, I don't know how to explain,\" Susan cried, \"it's different, that's all- Bruce was different, perhaps because, he asked me tn marry him.\" \"And supposing you didn't want to marry him?\" Margot uJted. \"Supposing he thought you were all right for him, but yuu knew he wasn't all right lor you?\" \"Darling, you're being a goose,\" said Susan, laughing. \"I just can't explain. Ynu can't possibly mistake it when it happens.\" All that had been nearly a year ago; soon afterwards Susan had married Bruce and at the wedding Margui had met Gjl Antony, who was Brute's best man. She had thought immediately that he was something rather special: tall, with a lean, humorous fare; as they stood in the rhanccl he had narrowed his grey eyes at her in a tiny, secret smile Afterwards he had said: \"You're chief bridesmaid and I'm best man; Wc must see this through together,\" and brr heart had skipped I heal in an entirely new kind of excite- ment. \"Tell me about Gil Antony,\" she said when Susan went up to change. \"Who is he? Where does he live? Why have 1 never seen him before?\" Susan grinned at her in the mirror. \"Do you like him?\" \"Oh. so-so,\" said Margot airily. 'Tvc only just met him. But tell me about him.\" \"He lives ottt erf town, in the country; that's probably why you haven't run into him before. With his mother.\" Margol giggled. \"Is that a warning?

Don't go falling in love with hhn,\" she added. \"He doesn't bother much with girls.\" \"Mrs. Antony?\" Margot suggested. \"Maybe, or perhaps he just isn't interested. 1 don't know.\" \"He's been giving me some very interested looks.\" Margot said. \"Well, enjoy yourself. But don't say I haven't warned you.\" Silly ol Susan, Margot thought as they went downstairs. She wasn't in the least likely to fall in love with Gil. He was welcome to go on living with his mother, but il was nice to have an attractive escort for die day. The thing was to make the most of the occasion and enjoy herself, as Susan had re- commended. After the Hotter ol confetti and good wishes which had wafted Susan and Bruce nn their way, Margot had fuund Gil beside her. \"Now what shall we do? We're alt dressed up in our best rlothes. Have you any ideas? 11 They had driven in Gil'i car through a countryside bridal with may; they'd had dinner at some palatial hotel, then they had danced. \"How well ue dance together,\" he said. \"We must do morr of this.\" Meaning nothing, she knew, except that he was happy, and they were enjoying themselves on Susan's wedding day. But all the same, her bean had given that little skip of excitement. She had silently scolded herself for it. There was no need to be like that; it was just a case of the best man doing his dutv bv the bridesmaid. If she had been quite unattrac- tive, he would have been just as attentive, in the circum- stances, probably. She hadn't expected to see him again. When at last he took her home she said, \"Thank ynu for a lovely time,\" and he said, \"I've enjoyed it, too.\" And he got into the car and whirled off, with no more hints about continuing their acquain- tance in the Future. She had stood at the gate, watching the tail-lights disap- pear, not quite certain for a moment how she felt. But the next day she hadn't given him a thought, beyond remembering that he had been charming to her. Just when had she de- rided she was in love with Gil? Susan hadn't really been very helpful. All this mysterious business about knowing you were in love, as though you sud- denly beheld a vision! There had been nothing like that about her affair with Gil, if you could call it an affair. During that week he had rung her up and suggested anniher trip in the car, and she had been pleased and happy about it, and they had spent another delightful evening together, and after that Gil had somehow become part of her life. The (rouble was that without reabsng what you were doing you drifted into a situation: Gil ringing her up, Calling for her, being asked to rotne in for a meal; becoming so frequent a visitor that nobody any longer made special pre- parations for him. He would drop in on his way from the roUcge, and if she didn't happen to be about he would sit quietly reading until she appeared, and when she did appear he would jusl glance up with that quiet smile. \"Hallo, Margot, f thought I'd drop in. Do you feel like doing anything tonight?\" Ol course, they teased her about him; you got used to being teased when you had brothers. Margot's \"steady,\" they called him. And she would say, \"Oh, don't lie silly. There's nothing like that about it.\" ''But, my good girl, he's here every other minute. Don'l tell me this is une of those good old platonic friend ships?\" At first it had all been fun. \"Purely platonic,\" she would assure them blithely- It was a little difficult to decide at what point it had become unsatisfactory and baffling. Perhaps after it ceased to be quite so platonic, after that night when Gil had kissed ber; a June night with a huge gulden moon and the garden sweet with roses. He said, as he usually did. \"Well, good-night, and thank you for everything.\" Then quite suddenly he took her in his arms and kissed her. \"Margol,\" he murmured, and somehnw it was quite natural and extraordinarily cnmfonablc to stand there with her cheek against his. Then he said, quite briskly, \"Good-night, darling,\" got in the car, waved a hand, and drove off. Su where did that get you? she wondered as she thoughtfully hung up her dance-dress. She had known, or supposed, that one day he would kiss her, and she'd had the leeling that it would murk a step forward in their relationship. Now he had kissed her, and nothing was different. \"Good-night, darling,\" he had said, just as he usually said it, and she was queerly conscious of something missing. Surely as she stood in his arms he should have said, \"I love you, Margot.\" Perhaps he didn't. But, if not, why come to see het every day? How could you tell when a man was in love with you? And it was perhaps then, at that moment, that she kites* that she wanted him to be in love with her. \"Sn 1 must be ill love with him,\" she reflected, sitting up in lied clasping her knees, suddenly smiling to herself, thrilled and excited, like arty girl in love, Oh, hut after this everything would be different, must be different. She could hardly wait for the muincnt when she would see him again, when he would kiss heT and this time say, \"I luvc you, Margot.\" So it was most definitely disconcerting to find that nothing was different. Gil came. They went out together. Sometimes he kissed her, sometimes he didn't. Not a ripple broke the calm of their relationship. He took her nut to the pink-washed house where he lived with hii mother. Mrs. Antony was quite charming to her. \"Sweet,\" Susan liad said, and she had been right. Mrs, Antony was slight and grey-haired, but still oddly girlish, in darks and a rugged tweed jacket, her hands dirty from gardening, \"Gil talks so much about yuu,\" she said, and Margol noticed that she had the same way as he had of narrowing her grey eyes in a smile. Perhaps Mrs. Antony was the answer; you could imagine that any son would dote on her. Yet Mrs. Antony was brisk and cheerful, obviously not at all the snrt of person whn would expect or want to be adored or spoilt. \"I've always hoped that Gil would marry a nice girl,\" she said when diey were alone together for a moment, \"A man should have a home of his own.\" \"But what about you?\" said Margot, feeling that she was being pushed into a false position, yet fumbling after an explanation. \"Oh, don't worry about me,\" said Mrs. Antony. \"I'm not a lonely sort of person. I always have too much to do.\" \"But \" Margot began, then Gil came in, and there was no opportunity again for finishing that sentence, even if she had known how she meant to finish it.

He hasn't asked nic to marry him. He hasn't ever said thai he loves me,\" She thought not, for Mrs. Antony now, like everybody else, assumed that Margot was going to marry Gil. Naturally. What else would one expect after all these mouths of devoted attention? Margot couldn't imagine a future without him. 'lint hr must say something,\" she thought, fran- ti,.,IU \"He must say, Margot, I love you, darling Marry me_' \" You couldn't just drift dumbly, There must come a moment when yuu looked at each other and said, \"I love you,\" And. of course, everybody assumed that titat moment had long since come and gone. Aunt Ella came to tea one day. \"Now, n&ftft all thin f hear?\" she said roguishly, i suppose we shall be having another wedding in the family iiion?\" Margot turned starlet. They were all looking at her; Mother, the boys, Mrs. Han nam, the reetor's wiir, who had happened to drop in. They were all waiting Iot her to smile and mention a date. But how could she, when Gil had never mentioned marriage? 1 don't know why you should think that. I'm not even rngaged yet,\" she said shortly. Then she hurried out of the room, aware of the astonishment in their eye*. Mother said afterwards, \"Margot, this affair with Gil. It's hern going on fur a long rime now.\" \"Mm,\" she said glumly. \"Darling, I don't want to interfere, but I don't think it's good when an affair just goes on and on and on. Static. Are you in love with Gil?\" Marcot shook her head. \"I don't know — yes, J think »o. Oh, I don't know.\" She wanted to pour out all her miserable uncer- tainty hut mother had eloped with father when she was seventeen. So how could she understand? Bui maybe she did understand a little, lor she laid l tentatively: ''iiome men never do come to the point. I mean-taling a pretty girl out is pleasant, and they never get any farther, and lime goes on. The thing is, Margot. if yoo'rr going to give Gil up, don't leave it ido bite,\" Give him up? The thought hadn't occurred to her, but there it was now, a possibility. Freedom and release, perhaps. But the thought brought no sense of freedom and release, onlv a dreariness so immense that she realised sadly how much she loved i id But, nevertheless. Mother was right.

Anyhow. I made him the centre- piece of a jumbled, window display, and I thought that perhaps* one of his old flames might happen up Third Avenue and take him to her hnsom for the sake of I^H). Ur had never had the slightest dif- ficulty with the ladies, aside from getting sufficient money to many them. Uncle Ambrose was on view for ten days before 1 riuticrd anyone give him a second glance, and, of all people, it was an extremely pretty girl. She was a fluffy, blue- eyed brownette, freckled just enough to he cute, and she was staring at Uncle Ambrose with an awed curiosity that surprised me. Then she drifted on after a false start, as though she hated to tear her- self away. She was bark again that evening, hrr eyes flickering around the win- dow before they came tn rest on Uncle Ambrose, and then she settled into a tcn-minnlc trance. When she had gone f went out on the side- walk to test the full effect of my relative, but somehow he didn't do a thing to mc — or anyone else but thai freckled kid. She took to stopping by on her way to and from work, and I would - August K, 1956 spy on her affair with the aid photo. It began to give me the creeps. Barbara, I said to myself, stop being so inquisitive. There's no mystery. But seeing her standing there, as before a shrine, told rne that something was queer. She was young and fresh as a flower, with a way of looking about her that made me think she came from out uf town, so I was leaning in the doorway when she rame by that evening. \"Hello,\" I said. \"Could you be from upstate?\" \"Yes, Maple Grove,\" uodded Frecktrs. \"How did you know?\" \"Tm a small towncr. myself,\" I told her. \"Would you like to come in and have a closer look at that picture? 1 ' She blushed. 'Td like to buy it. f'vr been trying tn make myself do it all week.\" All at once she looked older and rather miserable. \"I must have him,\" she said in an exhausted sort of voice. \"Do you know who he is?\" \"Now, how should ! know?\" I shrugged. \"Just some old-timer uff somebody's mantelpiece. Let's discuss him over a cup of tea. I'm just aliout to close up and make sutne.\" But Freckles, whose name turned out to be Jennie, had nothing in say regarding Uncle Ambrose. She was aching to talk, though, and lo- calise 1 have a romantic nature in spite of twenty years In the waiting- room of spinsterhood 1 listened to the old, old story that was so new and vexatious to her. Jennie didn't want to wither away in MapJe Grove, so she had come to the city to grasp at a dream. The boy she left behind was Bill, who was tied by tradition to his father's drugstore, which he would inherit in the due course of human events. \"I thought 1 was entitled to try for a wealthy husband who would provide furs, jewels, a big house, and foreign travel,\" she said, gazing at Uncle Ambrose, \"and I allowed myself a year tn get them. If 1 failed, I'd go home.\" \"Well, I'm ort my seventh month, And I — I think I'm about to realise my hopes. But the trouble is, Miss flarhara, that Bill is the one 1 really love. It's terrible! I thought things like that onlv happened in books.\" \"Where do you think authors gel their plots?\" I asked. \"Yon can do what they do — make the ending to suit yourself. If you're going now you may have the picture with- out charge. Only I'm wondering why you want it,\" \"He fascinates me,\" Jennie said softly. She was smiling, but it seemed to be only a mask for some- thing iroubled and uneasy. I mid her to drop in any time and she said ihr would, but as 1 let her out into Third Avenue 1 was pretty certain that I would never see her again. I was wrong, of course. One week later she marched in, bright and shining 3iid lovelier than ever. \"I'm going home tomorrow morning,\" she said happily, \"and here's why. 1 could have had the minks and the diamonds and all that. Miss Barbara, but I've suspected for some time — and found nut lor sure the other night — lhal marriage didn't go with them. \"That's why I've needed the pic- lure.

You must be- lieve that money isn't everything.* 1 — I might never have made my decision withnut the strFngth he gave me.\" Then from a briefcase she drew Uncle Ambrose and kissed him, but to me he just looked glowering and cantankerous. And as I watched Jennie's rapt young face I remem- bered: SuLker' are that way bri .wise they want to be. So there was no point in telling her that Uncle Am- brose died in gaol after robbing a bank of forty thousand dollars. | Copyright) Page 7 National Library of Australia http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page4808079 K aft mm r . f ^SINISTER Opening instalment of a swift-moving and eolorfal mystery serial set in the Yosemite Valley V WHEN I filed application card Form 5000- AB I did not gnrss that, in addition to applying for a posirirm as a ringer in our National Park Service, I was elbowing myself into participation in a scries of events so extraordinary — indeed, so melodramatic — that few individuals have experienced their like — or, if ihcy did experience them, managed to come through ihrni a jive. 1 could not foresee, when I passed my civil- service examination and was appointed to * ose- mite National Park, that I should encounter such er centric, baffling, or ruthless charac- ters as the stately Chinese gentleman, Li Stow Yen; the incredible and aristocratic Mrs. Lrtitia Potwin, from Boston's Black Bay; her chauffeur-secrctary-maid, Miss Joan d'Arcy Vanderlre; the fat, bubbling, liquid-cyi*d Levan- tine Greek, Zaharadns; or the dwarfish Johannes van der Poot, of Holland. To say nothing of the huge effeminate wrestler, Nature Boy Nusstrr. 1 found that I had to buy my own uniforms at a cost of nearly 150 dollars; that my salary was 3410 dollars a year; 'hat it was ordained I should work a forty-hour week, with overtime for such extra hours as I spent usefully. My duties included fire protection, insect con- trol, protecting scenic wonders of the flora and fauna of ih<- park, protecting the visiting public from one another and the results of their natural vagaries, and answering questions sensible and absurd with courtesy and correctness. There were 70 of us — ■ 23 regular rangers and 4? of us seasonal boys— to oversee and police 757,617 acres o( the awf -inspiring, incredibly beautiful and almo.tl untamed terrain. On the day I first made the acquaint- ance of Mrs. t/*titia Potwin, f was sta- tioned in Camp 14 on the floor of the valley. Here I registered newrumen and assigned sites upon which they might park their trailers, for this was largely a house-trailer camp. I was engaged in some trivial chore whrti an imperative female voice called •-Ranger!\" Now we rangers, even of such brief experience as 1. are not given to feeling surprise, much less tn exhibiting surprise, at the appearance, antics, aberrations, or mental idiosyncracies of those who come to dispart themselves in these areas which have been set apart by act of Congress for the conservation of \"the scenery and the natural and historical objects and wildlife . . for the enjoyment of the same in nidi manner and by such means as will leave them un- impaired for the enjoymrnt of future generations-\" Bin I admit I stared with undisguised amaremcnt at what I saw. The means of transportation of these new ar- rivals consisted of a car of expensive make and conservative design, to which was attached an ri- pe naive trailer of approximately the dimensions of a Pultmau sleeping-car. The front seat of the automobile was occupied by two women. One was a lady unmistakably a lady — of mature years. In a more mellow age than this the complimentary word which would have been applied tn her is \"portly.\" She was clothed in dignity. Her face, domin- ated by a great nose, was aristocratic in a granite sort of way. And she was dressed as if she were going to a fashionable aftemnon-tea at the height of the social season. 'Hie driver of the car was much younger and definitely more pleasing to the eye. Her dress was a rhauffenr's uniform of blue with a visored cap which sat sedately upon hair which was closer In red than auburn. Her face was rather on the lean side with high cheeklwnes and flat planes beneath. Her eyes were not blue, as one would have expected, but dark brown. It was the sort of face you looked at once care- lessly and then turned hack to quickly for a second look to try to determine just what was there to be seen. \"Yuung man,\" said the elderly lady, \"you are a ranger?\" \"I am a ranger,\" said I. The massive lady fixed me with severe cyes. \"Your appearance,\" she said, \"is creditably spruce. You have my approval.\" \"Tltank ynu, madam,\" 1 answered. \"Ami sour manners, what lirtle I have seen of ihcm, are good,\" she said, as if awarding an accolade. \"How may I assist you?\" I asked. \"We wrre told to come here to rrgister and to be assigned spare for our trailer.\" \"If you will come with tne,\" I suggested, \"we will select a space and then register you by name and location, in case of mail or telegrams.\" 'There will he none,\" she said grimly. \"Our whereabouts is unknown to friends and acquaint- ance* . . .

These persons come thousands of miles ostensibly to gait at wonders of nature. Do they ever look at them?\" \"Why, yes, madam.\" In spite of regulations, I was ironical. \"They even,\" said 1, \"buy picture postcards ol them.\" Miss Vanderlee emerged from the trailer. Her voice was brittle as she quoted, \" 'To him who in the love of Nature holds communion with her visible forms, she speaks n various language.' It may be that a fat woman in slacks with a hot doii in her hand ueis more out of goggling at Niagara or the Grand Canyon or Glacier Point than the aesthete in a flowing lie and nibbling a violet.\" \"You are impertinent,\" snapped Mrs. Potwin, \"It's part of my job,\" Miss Vanderlee said, and dis- appeared within the trailer. She thrust her bead out I he door. \"Somebody has to rap you over the knuckles or you get out of hand.\" This seemed to me to be disrespectful language to be addressed by an employee to her mistress, and I rxpcrterl swift results. But Mrs. Potwin ignored it. Instead, she asked me, \"What sort ol language, ranker, does Nature speak to this riffraff?\" \"A good language,\" I answered, choosing my words with discretion. \"And this, madam, is not precisely riffraff. These are citizens on holiday, possibly a long- anticipated-anu-saved-for holiday. At first glance they may seem grotesque or crude. But, at your leisure, madam, study their faces. They are the faces nf men and women who, by diligence and economy and good citizenship, have earned the right to relax for a few days, and lay aside their cares and their inhibitions. These funny people, madam, are the backbone of our country.\" I stopped, embarrassed, fearing lest I bad overstepped the bounds. Mrs. Potwin glared at me a moment. Her fare did not relax its grimncxs even when she spoke. \"Young man,\" she said harshly, \"you're nol such a fool as you look. And I'm not such a fool as I talk.\" Suddenly her eyes widened as a tall, spare gentleman in a meticulously tailored gabardine suit emerged from the neighboring trailer. He had a fare of great dignity, thin, with high cheekbones and unmistakably Oriental ryes. \"Mr. Li!\" she exrlaimed.

She won't get up to it at night or push its pram in the afternoon. That is much more than you can say for Mrs. Marlene Brown. You can tell from ihe way Sir Laurence spoke that he look the Nanny for granted. He could no more imagine a baby without a Nanny than a baby with- out a name. I bis idea is common in polite English society. I lived in London once and I shall never furget the Nannies pushing enormous prams around the parks.

The stem is the silhouette — the head of the rose the hat. (See illustrations of this theme on pages 16 and 17.) The hats are dcep-set-on-thc-hcad \"real\" ones, often outrageous extravaganzas of itowers, and their airy bulk is the focus of the new look. Below the hat the dress, suit, or coat is often understated, slender (not skimpy), with ease about the waistline. The latter may be natural, high-lifted, ot unmarked. The blouscd-at-the-back line and the Empire-line are two definite new looks. The Empire is my favorite, and will be most women's, because it suits every figure, excluding only the really bulky. Colors include the light sparkling pink of vin rose, rose-red, coral, lots of soft, vague apricots and blonds, and a subtle parma-violel. Dior makes navy high-fashion. It is also used a Little by fialenciaga, but most of the other designers ignore it. Black-and-white is worn in Paris from 5 o'clock onwards. Flower-prints, often with .i rose as the motif, beautify every collection. Polka dots are sprinkled with a lavish hand throughout the couture. Pure sky-blue with a white accent is again an irresistible spring color alliance. (See our cover,) There are more narrow than wide skins for day, and lots of waist-length jackets. Coals are a fashion in themselves. They have lots of style, can be in silk, wool, or cotton, and are worn A.M. and P.M. White organdie accents foam for day and evening. The Path collection leads in this one, and Madame Path has suits and dresses with delectable 1890 ruchings. There Is a special kind of English beauty, even when French-designed, about numbers of the new ball gowns. Many are done in delicate flower-prints creating • the atmosphere of gentleness and waltzing beneath a crystal \" chandelier. The delicately whittled slenderaess of the Empire-line ball gown has effortless elegance. Accessory notes at random: In Paris the evening hat is a decided \"must\" . , . above-elbow gloves are worn softly rtlchcd — day or night . . . shoes are narrow and pointed — classic pumps or bared, airy sandals. Lots of colored kid shoes by day; at night, satin ones — their color matched to the dress. All in all, spring fashions haven't an ounce of hard chic; in fact, this season chic means prettiness. (See pages 22, 23.) The clothes are worldly and elegant for certain, but they also have a lovely soft new turn — and, more important, they create a delightful feeling of femininity. Not all are easy fashions to wear, but find your own particular style and it will give you lots of pleasure and flattery in return, fi, 1956 Page 11 National Library of Australia http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page4808083 f PRINTS The American look for Spring!

STREET HAT PARADE 0 Givenchy, ihe youngest audi most spirited of the Parisian couturiers, refused to show hie spring collection to the Press. Later he relented, but he staged his hat showing in a street. THE display caused quite a stir in Paris, where sensations are usually too numerous to attract much attention. Crowds of voluble Parisians gathered round ash- blond model Ghislaine Arsac, and stared as she displayed his ultra -chic collection. The kindest comment on the styles came from a fat lady. \"What a pity.\" she said, \"the model is so beautiful.\" • Inspired try an Oriental bowl, • Vairy-flost of lulle. Tm.

All melon shades are very new worn with black. \"JJOYV would you suggest I brighten last season's plain bladk crepe frock?

Reauty in brief: SPRING LOOK OF COSMETICS liy CAROLYN EARLE • This spring make-up colors keep the pretty, mail look of (be pastel pinks, and there is also a renewed interest in (he high-style look of yellow-j-retl shades. LIPSTICK color is always an indi- vidual choice, and quite a lew wearers seem to have a true instinct for selecting the one that suits best. The beauty of the rosy-into-crimson innings is twofold, In the first place, what manufacturers call the \"blood tones\" are easier for the majority of people to wear. And secondly, these tonings have a way of making the wearer's complexion look clear and bright. One of the main things to remember here is that there are many, varied depths of pink, and careful choice is needed. The same applies to pink face pow- ders. Probably the one closest to your natural coloring is right for you. fhcre is no sense in playing around with high-style cosmetics unless you can carry them olf successfully. The yellow-red combination make-up is somrwhat harder to wear. Very dark shades of make-up must be worn warily after the age nf 40.

A peep at the preparations of the rover of (his \"Vogue\"- Like ga7£ttc were slightly dis- illusiomng. The photographer was photographing a sleek model in a wide, filmy bat.
