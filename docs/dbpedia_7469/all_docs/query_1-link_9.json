        "text": "WSLR-LP has been broadcasting for over 13 years in Sarasota focusing on local issues. We produce over 112 hours of locally produced programming each week at the station – much of it is music programming, but we also produce local news and public affairs programs covering issues like the local environment, politics, community arts, food & nutrition and minority issues. We have in depth interviews with movers and shakers, but we have also covered stories that don’t receive much attention from other media outlets – the voices of the homeless, stories of police abuse, minority perspectives on local issues, gentrification, and more. WSLR is steadily growing into a vital community resource for independent news, views, art, and culture. We are connecting people and organizations through access to the public airwaves, and we are helping to build a more local, diverse and participatory media.\n\nPopulation(s) Served\n\nWSLR strives to educate the community to 'be the media'. We have a three hour training that all new programmers must complete before going on the air. This is in addition to sitting in with experienced program hosts and fulfilling volunteer requirements. We have facilitated two week-long Radio Summer Camps for middle school students where the students actually produce and broadcast a radio show. We have welcomed interns from area High Schools and Colleges to learn more about broadcasting. We frequently provide tours to local school groups and other community groups (e.g. cub scouts). We also offer media classes in audio editing, citizen reporting and podcasting.\n\nPopulation(s) Served\n\nWSLR now operates the Fogartyville Community Media and Arts Center, a 120 seat performance space. WSLR seeks to promote broad participation in civic and cultural life by presenting live concerts, sponsoring screenings of independent films, hosting community conversations, facilitating workshops, and hosting speakers that further our goal of promoting peace, justice, sustainability, equality and social and economic justice. Concerts feature nationally-touring independent artists in different genres often with a local opener to give our local musicians added exposure in a listening room setting. We often partner with other local non-profits to present events of interest to the community.\n\nPopulation(s) Served"
