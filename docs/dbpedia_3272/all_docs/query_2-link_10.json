        "text": "13. Luis Henrique, FW\n\nClub: Botafogo\n\nAge: 21\n\nEstimated transfer value: €6m\n\nA winger who just qualifies for this list (he turns 22 in December). Back at Botafogo after falling short of expectations with Marseille in France, he has responded well in his club's title challenge.\n\nStrengths: He's fast, powerful, direct and also able to cut in from the left on to his stronger right foot and shoot at goal. He's well-suited to Botafogo's game plan.\n\nHow he can improve: He's yet to develop the subtlety to break down defences that don't give him the space he needs to build up acceleration.\n\n12. Mycael, GK\n\nClub: Athletico Paranaense\n\nAge: 19\n\nEstimated transfer value: €1.2m\n\nMycael is the latest in his club's outstanding production line of goalkeepers. First choice for the national team at U20 level this year and the hero of the recent Pan-American Games.\n\nStrengths: Tall, athletic and brave, Mycael seems to have almost all of the fundamentals, and his time with the national team has given him experience of the big occasion.\n\nHow he can improve: The decision of when to come and when to stay on his line is a challenge for every young keeper, but Mycael's main obstacle is the difficulty of getting a game at a club that has so many options.\n\n11. Marlon Gomes, CM\n\nClub: Vasco da Gama\n\nAge: 19\n\nEstimated transfer value: €4m\n\nA key member of the Brazil U20 team and a leading product of Vasco's impressive youth development work. He helped the team win promotion back to the first division last year.\n\nStrengths: A midfielder who is sharp, mobile and technically adept, he can play central or wide, and stands out for a pass-and-move game that is surprisingly mature. Has a touch of Manchester United's Mason Mount about him.\n\nHow he can improve: He needs to show that he is not too lightweight to compete at the top level. Has been hampered by the turbulence of his club's fight for first division survival this year, with coaching changes and new signings impacting his growth.\n\n10. Alexsander, CM\n\nClub: Fluminense\n\nAge: 20\n\nEstimated transfer value: €4m\n\nInjury took him out of the U20 World Cup and also interrupted his momentum just as he was becoming vital for Fluminense. He will surely have a key role to play in the side next year.\n\nStrengths: Alexsander may not be the most glamorous of players, but his all round virtues make him a coach's dream. He first appeared for his club at left-back, featured off the main striker for Brazil's U20s, then settled in as a midfielder, where his versatility and intelligence enabled him to cover the forward runs of Marcelo and also link up with the attack.\n\nHow he can improve: His versatility could be a problem if it prevents him from consolidating a firm identity. But the main headache has been an injury that interrupted his momentum and kept him on the bench in the closing stages of the Copa Libertadores.\n\n9. Luis Guilherme, FW\n\nClub: Palmeiras\n\nAge: 17\n\nEstimated transfer value: €7m\n\nA winger of huge potential, he picked up big-game experience this season and big things are expected in 2024.\n\nStrengths: A left-footed winger who plays on the right. He has searing acceleration, tight dribbling skills, intimidating power and a creative left foot.\n\nHow he can improve: He needs to improve his right foot. At the moment if he can't beat his marker for pace, he can be neutralised by showing him out towards the touchline.\n\n8. Gabriel Moscardo, DM\n\nClub: Corinthians\n\nAge: 18\n\nEstimated transfer value: €1.5m\n\nA tall, well-built central midfielder who has made a name for himself since being introduced to the first team at the end of June. He looks a little like a prototype of Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice.\n\nStrengths: Strong on the ball, he can carry it forward and has the ability to play crisp, forward passes and link the team together.\n\nHow he can improve: His defensive positioning is still raw, drawing him into rash challenges. In such a key zone of the field picking the right pass is understandably a challenge for a player still finding his way in an unconvincing team.\n\n7. Victor Hugo, CM\n\nClub: Flamengo\n\nAge: 19\n\nEstimated transfer value: €3m\n\nIn a bad year for the Rio de Janeiro giants, one of the positives has been the emergence of this tall, elegant left-footed midfielder. Hugo played his best football so far under Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli.\n\nStrengths: Not necessarily the most immediately eye catching of players, Hugo is a central midfielder able to take responsibility on the ball. He turns well, keeps possession ticking over and has the capacity to break into the penalty area, where he also offers a threat in the air.\n\nHow he can improve: He is not the quickest and the defensive side of his game could be improved, but his main problems come from the turbulent atmosphere at his club, with three coaches plus a stand-in already this year. The depth of the squad also makes it hard for him to get a game if he falls out of favour.\n\n6. Lucas Beraldo, CB\n\nClub: Sao Paulo\n\nAge: 19\n\nEstimated transfer value: €6m\n\nA centre-back who won a first-team place this year and established himself en route to winning the Brazilian Cup.\n\nStrengths: He has an undoubted touch of class on the ball, and his left-foot helps open up possibilities for playing a pass out of defence.\n\nHow he can improve: Beraldo can fall into the trap of the centre-back who looks better than he is. Is he strong enough physically to defend at the highest level? It is interesting that Nottingham Forest's search for a left-sided defender saw them choose Murillo, who has fewer games under his belt, over Beraldo. But Liverpool have also been linked recently.\n\n5. Pablo Maia, CM\n\nClub: Sao Paulo\n\nAge: 21\n\nEstimated transfer value: €7m\n\nHis second full season in the Sao Paulo first team has been a triumph for Maia, who has shown excellent progress anchoring the midfield in the side that won the Brazilian Cup.\n\nStrengths: He contributes when his side have possession by positioning himself behind the ball, making himself available to receive it and play probing passes forward.\n\nHow he can improve: Maia needs to impose his presence on the game more to win the ball back.\n\n4. John Kennedy, ST\n\nClub: Fluminense\n\nAge: 21\n\nEstimated transfer value: €4m\n\nA live-wire striker who decided the Copa Libertadores with a late goal and came up big in the previous knockout rounds. He made his Fluminense debut as a 17-year-old before the COVID-19 pandemic -- and it seems it has taken him years to become an overnight sensation.\n\nStrengths: A quick, mobile and direct striker who excels on the shoulder of the last defender, posing questions and looking to fire off shots before the keeper has settled. And as his winner in the Libertadores final showed, he can also start moves with his back to goal.\n\nHow he can improve: The red card he picked up for celebrating his Libertadores goal may have been a little harsh, but it was also naive and serves as an example of a difficult temperament which has not been easy to handle. How will he fare away from the understanding embrace of coach Fernando Diniz?\n\n3. Marcos Leonardo, ST\n\nClub: Santos\n\nAge: 20\n\nEstimated transfer value: €17m\n\nIf Pele's old club do not suffer an unprecedented relegation in the first season after the death of the great man, then much of that will be down to Leonardo. Despite missing a few rounds of the campaign to star in the U20 World Cup, his goals have kept Santos afloat. But he will surely not be around next year for a repeat performance.\n\nStrengths: Leonardo is a squat, penalty-area operator who is adept at finding space and whose finishing can be both clinical and explosive. Has the air of a young Sergio Aguero.\n\nHow he can improve: His many suitors may be considering if he is too much of a luxury player, and if he offers enough outside the penalty area. He really needs to improve his all-round contribution.\n\n2. Vitor Roque, ST\n\nClub: Athletico Paranaense\n\nAge: 18\n\nEstimated transfer value: €40m*\n\nOff to Barcelona soon, perhaps as soon as January, Roque has already played in a Libertadores final, been top scorer in the South American U20 Championships and made his senior Brazil debut. He is undoubtedly one of the country's biggest hopes, not least because he plays in a position which has surprisingly been a problem for the national team for a number of years.\n\nStrengths: Brazilian football has been producing plenty of strikers who operate in wide spaces, but there has been a real dearth of centre-forwards who combine mobility, physicality and technique. Roque seems to tick all of these boxes. He is strong and quick, has penalty area presence, can run at defences from deep and is one of the top scorers in the Brazilian Championship this season.\n\nHow he can improve: He can give a platform for his midfielders, but there is -- understandably -- room for improvement with his back to goal. But the main thing that might be categorised as a weakness is the unknown. How will he fare in top-class European football when he is up against quicker and better defenders?\n\n1. Endrick, FW\n\nClub: Palmeiras\n\nAge: 17\n\nEstimated transfer value: €72m*\n\nAnother breathtaking talent who will be on his way to Real Madrid for €72m in the middle of next year when he turns 18. A stocky left-footed support striker, Endrick came to the world's attention with a series of incredible goals in a national U20 competition when he was 15. And he was just handed his first senior call-up to the Brazil national team.\n\nStrengths: His natural talent is clear, but there is much more. He has a sense of audacity, a willingness to try things, the vision to make them happen quickly and a devastating burst of acceleration. But he also has a rare appreciation of space which means that he can attack the penalty area and score guided headers and tap-ins as well as the wonder goals that have made his name. He looks like a truly special talent."
