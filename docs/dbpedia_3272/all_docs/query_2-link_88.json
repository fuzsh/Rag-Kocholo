        "text": "Possibly the biggest upset of the 2024 Summer Olympics Women’s Football Tournament was staged in the semifinal, as a largely underwhelming Brazil side put four past world champions Spain to pour cold water over their hopes of a dream debut. Here is how they did it:\n\nForbes2024 Paris Olympics: Sophia Smith Leads USWNT To Final Against Brazil\n\nLow Expectations\n\nIn all honesty, Brazil were pretty fortunate to be in the semifinal based on their performances in the four previous matches. They scraped through the group stage as one of the better third-placed finishers despite winning just one game, and it was a mistake at the back from France that allowed them to score the winner in a quarterfinal in which they were second-best for the most part.\n\nHaving been knocked out of the group stage at the last World Cup, Brazil were fortunate to avoid a similar fate once more, though it would not have been quite such a shock this time. Not only were they drawn into a very tough group, but they also took a much-changed squad to France as new head coach Arthur Elias placed a lot more faith in domestically-based players.\n\nHowever, he struggled to find the right formula in terms of tactics and player selection in the tournament. Brazil chopped and changed formations and personnel from match to match, in part trying to suit their opponents but also trying to find the right combination for themselves, which continued to prove elusive.\n\nSo, it was an uncertain Brazil side that reached the semifinal against the world champions, but there was one big absence. Legendary forward Marta–still among Brazil’s very best players even at the age of 38–was suspended having picked up a direct red card in the final group game against Spain of all teams. The Seleção’s attack looked rather clueless without her in the quarterfinal, so even they themselves could hardly have dream of scoring four goals in the semifinal.\n\nForbesParis Olympics 2024: Women’s Soccer Semifinals\n\nFinally, there were few positives Brazil could take from the two sides’ last meeting just a few days ago. They went into the final group game needing a result to be sure of a knockout berth, whereas Spain had the luxury of already having sealed a spot and therefore fielded a heavily rotated XI.\n\nDespite the state of play, it was La Roja who dominated proceedings while Brazil adopted an incredibly defensive approach and barely kept a fifth of possession in the first half. That led to Marta getting sent off while trying to clear the ball from the edge of her own box, and Spain eventually forced their way through a dogged defense in the second half to win by two goals.\n\nA Front-Footed Approach\n\nElias and his coaching staff seemed to have learned from their mistake in the final group game, as they set their side up very differently from the quarterfinal. Even though they were against a first-choice Spanish side now, Brazil adopted a fully player-oriented approach and pressed high up the pitch in a 3-4-1-2 formation, perfectly countering Spain’s 2-3-2-3 shape in possession.\n\nThey tried to disrupt the world champions’ build-up right from the goalkeeper and enjoyed instant success beyond what even they might have hoped for. Less than six minutes in, Catalina Coll’s rushed kick under pressure ended up hitting her own defender and rebounding into the net, giving Brazil a shock lead.\n\nCritically, Brazil did not let up after the opener. They continued to press high and unsettle Spain’s possession-play, restricting them to just seven shots and zero big chances in the first half while managing nine and three respectively themselves.\n\nSpain’s Weakness\n\nWhile Brazil deserve credit for a brilliant performance, Spain only have themselves to blame for this defeat. They were far too shaken and lost composure after conceding early on, while their failure to address the defensive weakness that nearly cost them the quarterfinal against Colombia ultimately cost them the match.\n\nHaving won all three group games with just one goal conceded, La Roja looked in a very strong position to become the first team to go win the Olympics right after winning the World Cup. Their campaign was very nearly derailed in the quarterfinal, though, as they conceded 12 minutes in and only went on to equalize deep into stoppage time before ultimately prevailing on penalties.\n\nBrazil seemed to draw inspiration from Mayra Ramírez’s performance in that game, as she caused all sorts of problems to Spain’s center-backs with her intelligent movement in behind and strong physical presence. Elias’ squad lacked an imposing striker in her ilk, so he opted to use an incredibly narrow front three instead and overload Spain’s center-backs. Brazil then targeted their attacks with balls in behind the Spanish defines, either via a flank or directly down the middle.\n\nThey were able to find a lot of joy through this approach, creating loads of presentable chances besides the three other goals they scored.\n\nGoing For Gold\n\nHaving qualified for their first Olympic gold medal match since 2008, Brazil’s women’s national team have a great opportunity to get their hands on the most coveted prize for the first time in their history.\n\nTheir opponents, the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT) led by Emma Hayes will be no pushovers, so they will have to come up with another special performance on Saturday. They will not be short of motivation as that will be Marta’s last final for Brazil before she retires at the end of the year, so the whole squad will be committed to giving everything to ensure she can bow out on an unforgettable high.\n\nTactically, though, that promises to be another incredibly interesting fixture. Brazil might be better off avoiding such a front-footed approach against the USWNT, whose electric front-three will thrive in an open and end-to-end game. Instead, a low-block-and-counter strategy might be the best way to frustrate Hayes’ side and capitalize on any counterattacking opportunities they may concede.\n\nEither way, it promises to be a thrilling end to the 2024 Summer Olympics’ Women’s Football Tournament."
