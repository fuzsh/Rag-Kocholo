        "text": "Brazil finalized their squad for the 2024 Copa America in early June after coach Dorival Junior made some initial decisions that raised a few eyebrows among Selecao fans.\n\nEstablished players from the Premier League, including Richarlison and Casemiro, have not been included, but 17-year-old Endrick will feature at his first international tournament.\n\nEndrick continued his solid form for Brazil in June ahead of the Copa America with a game-winning goal in his side's 3-2 victory over Mexico in front of more than 80,000 fans in College Station, Texas.\n\nManchester City goalkeeper Ederson was earlier removed from the squad due to the eye injury he sustained in the Premier League win over Tottenham. Three new players were then added to the final roster, including Juventus defender Bremer, as Dorival finalised his plans.\n\nThis year's finals will offer a chance for Brazil to reclaim their standing as the best side in North and South America. The Selecao endured a difficult end to 2023 as they lost three consecutive 2026 World Cup qualifiers, including at home to world champions Argentina.\n\nHowever, a win over England at Wembley Stadium and a thrilling draw with Spain during the March international break gave some new impetus to the group and suggested improvements are forthcoming under Dorival, who was confirmed as the new permanent head coach in January.\n\nAlthough Brazil are not quite at the level of previous major tournaments — for one thing, star forward Neymar has missed out with injury — they will still be one of the leading contenders for glory at this summer's tournament in the United States.\n\nHow many players are in Copa America 2024 squads?\n\nTeams had the opportunity to name provisional squads of up to 55 players for pre-tournament training camps and friendly matches. These groups had to be a minimum of 35 players and contain at least four goalkeepers.\n\nThe final rosters, which had to be confirmed by June 15 (except for Paraguay, who had until June 18), comprise a maximum of 26 players. At least three of these players must be goalkeepers, and they must all be selected from the provisional squad, except in exceptional circumstances.\n\nBrazil Copa America squad 2024\n\nThe below table has been updated with the names on the Brazil roster and caps are correct as at the time of the squad announcement.\n\nPositionPlayerClubAgeCapsGKBentoAthletico-PR (BRA)242GKAlissonLiverpool (ENG)3163GKRafaelSao Paulo (BRA)340DEFBremerJuventus (ITA)274DEFDaniloJuventus (ITA)3256DEFYan CoutoGirona (ESP)213DEFGuilherme AranaAtletico-MG (BRA)276DEFWendellPorto (POR)302DEFBeraldoPSG (FRA)202DEFEder MilitaoReal Madrid (ESP)2630DEFGabriel MagalhaesArsenal (ENG)266DEFMarquinhosPSG (FRA)2984MIDAndreas PereiraFulham (ENG)283MIDEdersonAtalanta (ITA)240MIDJoao GomesWolves (ENG)232MIDBruno GuimaraesNewcastle (ENG)2620MIDDouglas LuizAston Villa (ENG)2613MIDLucas PaquetaWest Ham (ENG)2644MIDPepePorto (POR)271FOREndrickPalmeiras (BRA)174FOREvanilsonPorto (POR)240FORRodrygoReal Madrid (ESP)2322FORGabriel MartinelliArsenal (ENG)229FORRaphinhaBarcelona (ESP)2722FORSavinhoGirona (ESP)201FORVinicius JuniorReal Madrid (ESP)2328\n\nCan Brazil replace players on Copa America roster?\n\nOnce the final roster has been made official, changes can only be made due to injury or illness up until the team's opening match of the tournament.\n\nCONMEBOL's tournament regulations state: \"In case of serious injury or detection of pathological clinical elements of any player, after the submission of the squad list, and which prevents the player from playing in the tournament, the replacement of such player by another player included in the provisional squad list will be allowed up to 24 hours before the first match of the team in the competition, subject to the approval of the CONMEBOL Medical Commission.\""
