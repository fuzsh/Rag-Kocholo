        "text": "The Worse the Clubs Were Last Season…. the more they travel pre-season\n\nChild abuse in football clubs… “Not one for us” say the police\n\nBy Tony Attwood\n\nThe Mirror summed it up on the first of this month. “Man Utd’s injury crisis worsens as four players hand Erik ten Hag huge headache,” they proclaimed, containing, “Manchester United’s pre-season tour of the United States has been punctuated by injuries to key players, including the summer’s headline signing Leny Yoro.”\n\nThe story is circulating that Will Fish was taken off on a stretcher during Manchester United’s pre-season friendly with Liverpool. The headline story from the local paper is that Manchester United’s injury problems “continued to mount after the player came on as a half-time substitute alongside Rhys Bennett, with Erik ten Hag replacing both of his starting centre-backs at the break.”\n\nAnd we know Leny Yoro will be out for three months with an injury gained against Arsenal previously.\n\nOf course, Arsenal were hit with last season in a similar way with Jurriën Timber getting hurt before he had hardly started and missing virtually the entire season.\n\nBut who gets the most injuries? And come to that why? The BBC has helpfully charted which club had the most individual injuries. This doesn’t take account of how long the player was out for.\n\n*Max out together is the largest number of players who were out through injury at any one time.\n\nThe differences in this table are enormous. Fulham had just on half the number of injuries as Chelsea across the season. Chelsea, Newcastle and Brighton all lost over three times as many player-days through injury as West Ham – and in fact over half the clubs in the league lost players for more than twice as many days as West Ham.\n\nLuton, Man U, Newcastle and Chelsea all had 11 players out at the same time at once stage of the season while Manchester City and West Ham Unoited never got above four. (West Ham came ninth last season, with an average injury record they could have been relegated!)\n\nSo what causes this massive disparity in numbers? It is hard to say, for certainly none of these numbers relate to the league position of clubs last season (the table as you will have noted is in the order of where clubs finished in the league as shown in the first column on the left.)\n\nAnd we get the same disparity between teams when we look at the number of separate injuries each team has. Manchester United gained double the number of separate injuries as Manchester City, and almost double the number as Arsenal – and Man U are already building up their numbers for this season (they have seven men out, only Brighton have more).\n\nBut there is a link between two statistics – of sorts. And it is one we would expect. The number of injuries a club gets in a season is related roughly to the number of times a team is fouled per game. It is by no means an exact relationship since it still doesn’t explain Manchester United’s high number of injuries but there is a tendency.\n\nUnfortunately such a link is pretty obvious – indeed we might have expected it to be stronger!\n\nDays lost through injuries and the one below from Give Me Sport reveals the problem that we have – although as we start to combine data it becomes clear there is no one individual agreed count for injury data.\n\nClub Total Injuries Games Missed Through Injury Current Injuries Chelsea 54 309 8 Newcastle 38 258 8 Brentford 21 255 6 Manchester United 35 233 11 Liverpool 34 221 3 Tottenham Hotspur 37 182 6 Brighton & Hove 20 159 9 Aston Villa 12 123 8 Crystal Palace 12 116 6 Arsenal 21 114 1 Bournemouth 11 114 7 Everton 15 97 3 Fulham 24 92 1 Burnley 10 86 6 Sheffield United 6 86 10 Manchester City 16 59 0 Luton Town 17 58 8 Nottingham Forest 10 50 1 Wolverhampton Wand 9 33 5 West Ham United 6 22 3\n\nSo we seem to have no pattern that relates injuries to success except a fairly general one that says the fewer injuries a club gets and the fewer days players are out, the better it is for the club – which is obvious.\n\nWhat we probably can conclude is that to a degree injuries are linked to style of play, but only to an extent. What may help reduce the number of injuries is having attackers who pass the ball quickly before they get tackled, having a training regime that particularly focuses on the slow build-up of strength, and having a squad that can be used when a player is suffering from a slight strain,, so that such players are not risked, but instead allowed to recover fully.\n\nCertainly, it would seem that unless we simply accept that injuries are random, we would have to focus on training methods, style of play with fast passing probably resulting in fewer injuries by avoiding being tackled.\n\nBut there is a real oddity in all this. One might expect that the clubs that are fouled the most are also the clubs that get the most injuries. But this is not the case.\n\nThat couldn’t possibly mean that some players feign injury to get a free kick could it?"
