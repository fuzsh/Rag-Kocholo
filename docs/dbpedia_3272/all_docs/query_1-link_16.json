        "text": "At the end of the day, it's all about winning trophies right?\n\nWinning a major piece of silverware is the hardest thing to do in football - just ask Harry Kane...\n\nThe England captain's defeat in the Euro 2024 final means the 30-year-old has lost all six finals he's featured in for club and country.\n\nKane is still yet to lift any silverware in his career - even after joining serial winners Bayern Munich from Tottenham last year.\n\nHowever, others make it look easy, with Lionel Messi adding another honour to his collection after claiming his second Copa America.\n\nWith that in mind, talkSPORT.com looks at the top ten most decorated players of all time...\n\nRyan Giggs - 34 trophies\n\nThe only player on this list who won the majority of his silverware while playing in England - the Welsh winger's longevity was astounding!\n\nGiggs is the most decorated player in United's history having won 34 trophies in a career which saw him make 963 appearances for his only club over 24 years.\n\nNotable trophies won:\n\nPremier League: 13x (1992–93, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1996–97, 1998–99, 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2012–13)\n\nFA Cup: 4x (1993–94, 1995–96, 1998–99, 2003–04)\n\nLeague Cup: 4x (1991–92, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10)\n\nChampions League: 2x (1998–99, 2007–08)\n\nCristiano Ronaldo - 35 trophies\n\nA modern great for Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus, Ronaldo's hunger for success has seen him break into the top ten.\n\nRonaldo has more individual awards than everyone on this list except rival Messi and has won everything, including league titles in England, Spain and Italy - and he has the goal records to match.\n\nBut the 39-year-old still falls slightly short when it comes to team honours despite his record five Champions League titles.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner missed out on the Saudi Pro League title for a second successive season at Al Nassr.\n\nPenalty shootout defeats then ended his ambitions to win the King Cup of Champions as well as Euro 2024 with Portugal.\n\nNotable trophies won:\n\nPremier League: 3x (2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09)\n\nLaLiga: 2x (2011–12, 2016–17)\n\nSerie A: 2x (2018–19, 2019–20)\n\nChampions League: 5x (2007-08, 2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18)\n\nEuropean Championship: 2016\n\nUEFA Nations League: 2018-19\n\nGerard Pique - 37 trophies\n\nThe Spaniard came through the ranks at Sir Alex Ferguson's Man United before returning to Barcelona to help his boyhood club win trebles in 2008/09 and 2014/15.\n\nPique, who hung up his boots in 2022, also played a starring role for Spain in their 2010 World Cup win and their Euro triumph two years later.\n\nNotable trophies won:\n\nPremier League: 2007-08\n\nLaLiga: 8x (2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2018–19)\n\nChampions League: 4x (2007-08, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15)\n\nEuropean Championship: 2012\n\nWorld Cup: 2010\n\nAndres Iniesta - 37 trophies\n\nThe 40-year-old is still going strong in the United Arab Emirates after a spell in Japan with Vissel Kobe.\n\nBut Iniesta will always be celebrated for the pivotal role he played in Barcelona and Spain's dual domination in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nThe midfielder lifted every trophy on offer during a 16-year spell in Barca's first-team and scored a 116th-minute winner for his country against the Netherlands in the 2010 World Cup final.\n\nNotable trophies won:\n\nLaLiga: 9x (2004–05, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18)\n\nChampions League: 4x (2005–06, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15)\n\nEuropean Championship: 2x (2008, 2012)\n\nWorld Cup: 2010\n\nMaxwell - 37 trophies\n\nA surprise name perhaps but the underrated Brazilian defender had the fortune of playing for the Inter Milan side Jose Mourinho inherited before joining Pep Guardiola's all-conquering Barcelona team.\n\nMaxwell was then among the first players to make the switch to PSG following their 2011 takeover by Qatar Sports Investments.\n\nHe was the most decorated active European player at the time of his retirement and Maxwell has since become the club's assistant sporting director.\n\nNotable trophies won:\n\nSerie A: 3x (2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09)\n\nLaLiga: 2x (2009–10, 2010–11)\n\nChampions League: 2010–11\n\nLigue 1: 4x (2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16)\n\nSergio Busquets - 37 trophies\n\nAn unsung hero during the days of Barcelona and Spain's domination, Busquets established himself as the best holding midfielder around.\n\nAfter winning 32 trophies with Barca and a treble with his La Roja, Busquets followed Messi to Miami and added to his tally by securing the 2023 Leagues Cup.\n\nNotable trophies won:\n\nLaLiga: 9x (2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2022–23)\n\nChampions League: 3x (2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15)\n\nEuropean Championship: 2012\n\nWorld Cup: 2010\n\nUEFA Nations League: 2023\n\nHossam Ashour - 39 trophies\n\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah still has a way to go to becoming Egypt's most decorated player - that honour doesn't even belong to Ashour!\n\nThe defensive midfielder made his debut for Al-Ahly in 2003 and helped the club to 39 trophies over the next 17 years.\n\nHe made the switch to Al Ittihad for the final two years of his career in 2020 but failed to add to his glittering collection.\n\nNotable trophies won:\n\nEgyptian Premier League: 13x (2004–05, 2005–06, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20)\n\nEgypt Cup: 4x (2005–06, 2006–07, 2016–17, 2019–20)\n\nEgyptian Super Cup: 10x (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017، 2018)\n\nCAF Champions League: 6x (2005, 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2020)\n\nCAF Confederation Cup: 2014\n\nAfrican Super Cup: 5x (2006, 2007, 2009, 2013, 2014)\n\nHossam Hassan - 41 trophies\n\nThe once-prolific striker has the honour of being both Egypt's most decorated player and the country's record goalscorer.\n\nThe 57-year-old claimed 14 Egyptian Premier League titles during his career, while he was also a three-time African Cup of Nations winner.\n\nNotable trophies won:\n\nEgyptian Premier League: 14x (1984–85, 1985–86, 1986–87, 1988–89, 1993–94, 1994–95, 1995–96, 1996–97, 1997–98, 1998–99, 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2003–04)\n\nEgypt Cup: 5x (1984-85, 1988-89, 1992-93, 1995-96, 2001-2002)\n\nEgyptian Super Cup: 2x (2001, 2002)\n\nCAF Champions League: 2002\n\nAfrican Cup of Nations: 3x (1986, 1998, 2006)\n\nDani Alves - 44 trophies\n\nThe Brazilian became the first player in football history to reach 44 trophies after securing Olympic gold in 2021.\n\nOften regarded as one of the best full-backs of all time, Alves won the bulk of his medals in Spain for Sevilla and then Barcelona.\n\nHe later enjoyed success in Italy with Juventus and at French giants Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nNotable trophies won:\n\nLaLiga: 6x (2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16)\n\nChampions League: 3x (2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15)\n\nSerie A: 2016–17\n\nLigue 1: 2x (2017–18, 2018–19)\n\nCopa America: 2x (2007, 2019)\n\nSummer Olympics: 2020\n\nLionel Messi - 45 trophies\n\nA true icon, Messi has won countless individual trophies to go along with his team's triumphs, including a record eight Ballon d'Or awards.\n\nThe Argentine racked up an incredible 34 trophies during his time at Barcelona, before scooping three more at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nBut the crowning moment of his career came during the World Cup in Qatar, with Messi scoring twice in the dramatic final against France.\n\nNot satisfied with stepping away from the beautiful game, the 37-year-old joined Inter Miami where he quickly got his hands on the Leagues Cup - the first-ever piece of silverware for David Beckham's MLS franchise.\n\nIn July 2024, he captained Argentina to their first back-to-back Copa title this century - which was also a record 16th continental title for La Albiceleste, and ensures Messi stands alone!\n\nNotable trophies won:"
