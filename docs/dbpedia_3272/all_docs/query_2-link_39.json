        "text": "MARSEILLE, France: Brazil will meet the US in the final of the Olympic women’s football tournament after beating world champions Spain 4-2 on Tuesday.\n\nGabi Portilho, Adriana and Kerolin struck in a thrilling semifinal at Stade de Marseille after an own-goal from Irene Paredes had put the two-time silver medalist in front.\n\n“It’s a dream, and dreams come true,” said Kerolin, whose goal in the first of more than 15 minutes of stoppage time helped to hold off a late Spain fightback. “I’m so excited, so excited, so excited and I’m really, really, really impressed by my teammates.”\n\nVictory means Brazil great Marta has the chance to end her glittering international career by competing for gold after being suspended for the quarterfinals and semifinals.\n\nThe 38-year-old Marta has said her sixth Olympics will be her last major tournament with the national team.\n\n“We just knew what we came to do today, and it was a final for us today,” said Angelina, who was leading the Brazil team. “So, we were just very determined and we just came for the win.”\n\nAngelina said the Brazil squad needed to “celebrate a little bit” but quickly focus on the final.\n\n“It was a big win. Again, Spain is an amazing team and we knew that,” she said. “So now we need to rest and we need to study a lot, and see what we can do against the US.”\n\nSpain won’t get the chance in Paris to further cement their place at the top of women’s soccer by adding Olympic gold to the World Cup they won last year.\n\nBut there’s plenty still to play for at the Paris Games.\n\n“We keep fighting for something super nice and it will continue to be the Olympics until the end,” Spain forward Jennifer Hermoso said. “A bronze medal is also very difficult to get.”\n\nParedes’ sixth-minute own goal put Brazil in control and Portilho doubled the advantage in the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time.\n\nAdriana’s header in the 71st underlined Brazil’s dominance. But with the win seemingly assured, there was far more drama to come.\n\nSalma Paralluelo pulled a goal back for Spain with a header in the 85th and almost immediately Alexia Putellas struck the bar with a shot from outside the area.\n\nKerolin made it 4-1 — shooting through Spain goalkeeper Cata Coll’s legs.\n\nParalluelo got her second in the 12th minute of stoppage time, but by then it was too late for Spain to mount a comeback.\n\nBrazil will play the four-time champion US women’s national team in Saturday’s final at Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nSpain play Germany in Lyon for bronze.\n\nBrazil have been twice beaten in an Olympic final by the US — at Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008.\n\nThey secured a place in the final for the third time after making amends for a 2-0 loss to Spain in the group phase of the tournament.\n\nThat was a game that also saw Marta red-carded, and Brazil received confirmation just hours before kickoff in the semifinals that its appeal against her ban had been rejected.\n\nIn the end, Brazil didn’t need their greatest player on this occasion and took a big step toward the final early on after a calamitous mix up in Spain’s defense when Coll — under pressure from Priscila — attempted a clearance that came back off Paredes and into her own net.\n\nBrazil dominated the chances — repeatedly getting through on goal — and made its superiority count just before halftime through Portilho, who slotted into the bottom corner from Yasmim’s cross.\n\nAdriana made it 3-0 after seeing her initial effort hit the bar from six yards and then heading in from Portilho’s nod back across goal.\n\nSpain, who had fought back from 2-0 down to beat Colombia in the quarterfinals, gave their fans hope through Paralluelo’s header. But when Kerolin put Brazil 4-1 ahead, a second for Paralluelo proved to be nothing more than a consolation.\n\n“We showed the world that we have a young team and a team that has a very good tactical understanding, that competes, that will always be like this — competitive,” Brazil coach Arthur Elias said. “Brazil in women’s football is a source of great pride.”\n\nPARIS: From a colorful, sometimes controversial opening ceremony to boxers caught up in a gender row to respectful bows on the gymnastics podium, the 2024 Olympics served up many memorable moments.\n\nAFP Sport looks at 10 of the best:\n\n-- Organizers promised a spectacular opening ceremony and the rain-soaked boat parade on the River Seine ended up making global headlines, but not for the expected reasons.\n\nChurch leaders, conservatives, and even US presidential candidate Donald Trump were left outraged by a scene involving drag queens and lesbian DJ Barbara Butch that appeared to parody Jesus’s Last Supper.\n\nArtistic director Thomas Jolly denied any such intention. He and others involved ended up facing vicious online harassment that led to police complaints.\n\n-- Novak Djokovic stunned Carlos Alcaraz in a memorable men’s final to clinch tennis gold and become only the fifth player to complete the Golden Slam of all four majors plus Olympic gold.\n\nThe 37-year-old celebrated with a roar that echoed around Roland Garros before the tearful Serb clambered into the player’s box to embrace his wife Jelena and two children.\n\n“There is no greater inspiration than representing your country,” said the 24-time Grand Slam title winner.\n\nAlcaraz was also in tears, claiming he “had let Spain down.”\n\n-- Simone Biles may have been the star of the show but she was widely praised for bowing to her arch-rival Rebeca Andrade on the podium.\n\nBiles said it was “just the right thing to do” after she and team-mate Jordan Chiles finished in silver and bronze medal position respectively behind the Brazilian in the floor final.\n\n“Rebeca’s so amazing, she’s queen,” said Biles.\n\nRomanian Ana Barbosu was later awarded the bronze medal after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that Chiles should not have been upgraded from her initial fifth-place finish.\n\n-- World champion Noah Lyles roared to victory in 9.79sec to claim gold in a dramatic men’s Olympic 100m final in the closest finish in modern history — just five thousandths of a second separated him from Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson.\n\n“I’m the man among all of them. I’m the wolf among wolves,” said Lyles whose victory was only confirmed after a photo-finish.\n\n-- Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem won the men’s javelin title, his country’s first individual gold at an Olympics, with a Games record of 92.97m.\n\nIn second place was India’s defending champion Neeraj Chopra.\n\n“Rivalry is there when it comes to cricket matches, other sports, the two countries have a rivalry, but it’s a good thing for the young people in both countries to watch our sport and follow us. It’s a positive thing for both countries,” said Nadeem.\n\n-- Images of Olympic table tennis players from North Korea and South Korea taking a selfie together on the medal podium went viral in South Korea, hailed as a rare show of cross-border unity.\n\nAfter South Korea won bronze and North Korea silver in the mixed doubles behind China, South Korea’s Shin Yu-bin took a group photo after the medal ceremony.\n\nNorth Korea’s Ri Jong Sik and Kim Kum Yong, the South’s Shin Yu-bin and the victorious Chinese team Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha all beamed into Lim’s phone, a South Korean-made Samsung.\n\n“A selfie with both Koreas’ national flags and a Samsung phone,” said the widely read daily JongAng Ilbo.\n\n-- Australian skateboarding sensation Arisa Trew, just 14, won the women’s park event to become her country’s youngest ever gold medallist.\n\nTrew nailed a high-risk and high-speed final round in her trademark pink helmet, bringing the crowd to their feet at a sun-drenched Place de la Concorde.\n\nThe event also featured 11-year-old Zheng Haohao, the youngest athlete ever to represent China at the Olympics.\n\n“Skateboarding in the Olympic Games isn’t much different from skateboarding in my neighborhood. It’s just more spectators,” she told reporters.\n\n-- On a raucous night at Roland Garros, the storied home of the French Open, Algerian gender-row boxer Imane Khelif claimed gold and used her platform to hit back at “attacks” and “bullying” before defiantly declaring “I am a woman like any other.”\n\nTogether with Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, who also fought in Paris, Khelif was disqualified from last year’s world championships after they failed gender eligibility tests.\n\nHowever they were cleared to compete in Paris, setting the stage for one of the biggest controversies of the Games.\n\n“I am fully qualified to take part, I am a woman like any other. I was born a woman, lived a woman and competed as a woman,” said the 25-year-old.\n\n-- Cuban wrestler Mijain Lopez made Olympic history when he became the first athlete to win five consecutive individual golds in the same event, bettering the records of Games icons such as Carl Lewis and Michael Phelps.\n\nThe soon-to-be 42-year-old then placed his shoes in the center of the mat to signify his intention to retire.\n\n“Wrestling has been the love of my life, for all of my life,” he said.\n\n-- Turkish Olympic shooting silver medallist Yusuf Dikec became an overnight sensation for his casual style during competition.\n\nHis eye-catching posture saw the marksman wearing standard glasses, a team T-shirt and with his left hand casually tucked in his pocket.\n\nOther than his pistol, he notably had none of the specialized equipment used by athletes in the hyper-precise event, like headphones, special lenses or a hat.\n\n“The name’s Dikec. Yusuf Dikec,” said a social media post in reference to cinema icon James Bond.\n\nTULSA, Oklahoma: Rianne Malixi beat Asterisk Talley 3 and 2 to win the US Women’s Amateur on Sunday at rain-softened Southern Hills, three weeks after routing Talley in the US Girls’ Junior final.\n\nLast month in the US Girls’ Junior, the 17-year-old Malixi — from the Philippines — beat the 15-year-old Talley 8 and 7 at El Caballero in Tarzana, California, the largest championship-match blowout in tournament history.\n\n“Honestly I love Asterisk. I would love to be friends with her,” Malixi said. “That’s why I just kind of like kept on talking to her. Even those small talks … Developing a relationship with her has been so awesome. She’s just a great player and a great person as well.”\n\nMalixi is the second player to win both events in the same year, joining Eun Jeong Seong in 2016. She has verbally committed to play at Duke, with plans to begin college play in 2025.\n\n“Honestly I just wanted to play good golf. That’s it,” Malixi said about her expectations for the year. “I wasn’t expecting to win the Australian Master of Amateurs in January and then win US Girls’ last month and then this one. I was so surprised. Even though I was playing good golf, I was just not expecting it.”\n\nTalley, from Chowchilla, California, led 1 up Saturday after the first 18 holes of the 36-hole championship match were moved up a day because of expected rain Sunday.\n\nMalixi was 3 up after 26 holes, and Talley took the next three holes to it. They halved the 30th with pars, Malixi won the next three with birdies and closed it out with par halve on the par-5 34th.\n\nTalley teamed with Sarah Lim to win the US Women’s Amateur Four-Ball in May in San Antonio.\n\n“Just to be my first Women’s Am and being able to make it this far was really cool.,” Talley said. “I feel like I can take a lot from this week just knowing that. And I’m still young.”\n\nWASHINGTON: Aaron Rai withstood a 36-hole marathon final Sunday to win the rain-hit Wyndham Championship, taking his first PGA title after American Max Greyserman squandered a four-stroke lead.\n\nThe 29-year-old Englishman sank a birdie putt on the last hole from just inside seven feet in the gloom of twilight to secure the victory at Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\n“Incredible. A dream come true,” Rai said. “I’m extremely grateful. I think it hasn’t sunk in just yet. An amazing achievement.”\n\nRai fired a bogey-free 6-under par 64 after a third-round 68 earlier to finish 72 holes at Sedgefield Country Club on 18-under 262.\n\nThat was good enough for a two-stroke victory over Greyserman, whose four-hole roller coaster run on the back nine in the fourth round ended with heartbreak.\n\n“I had a four shot lead with five holes to go? If you’re doing that in a PGA Tour event, you’re doing something exceptionally well so that’s what I’m going to walk away with,” Greyserman said.\n\n“Stuff happens. I’m just going to walk away with more confidence, look at the positive things and learn from the mistakes.”\n\nJapan’s Ryo Hizatsune and American J.J. Spaun shared third on 265 with US amateur Luke Clanton another stroke adrift.\n\nA tropical storm dumped more than six inches of rain on the course to wipe out play on Thursday and set the stage for finishing the second round early Sunday then completing the last 36 holes at sunset.\n\nRai, who trailed most of the day, sank a 13-foot birdie putt at the par-3 12th to climb within two of Greyserman, who responded by holing out for eagle from the fairway from 91 yards at the par-4 13th hole, leaping to a four-stroke lead at 21-under.\n\nBut the drama was far from done as Greyserman squandered his entire advantage on the very next hole.\n\nGreyserman bounced his tee shot at 14 off a right side cart path and out of bounds, then put his third into the left rough, his fourth into a bunker and made a quadruple bogey to fall level with Rai at 17-under.\n\nGreyserman made a tap-in birdie at the par-5 15th but followed with a four-putt bogey at the par-3 16th, missing twice from inside four feet to leave Rai ahead by one.\n\nRai blasted his approach at 18 just inside seven feet and made the birdie putt for a two-shot edge.\n\nWhen Greyserman couldn’t manage another hole out from the 18th fairway, Rai’s triumph was assured.\n\n“I just did a good job of sticking to what we do well,” Rai said. “It was amazing to finish it off that way on 18.”\n\nRai has won twice on the DP World Tour, the 2018 Hong Kong Open and 2020 Scottish Open.\n\n“Really pleased with how good a job I did just doing what I normally do,” Rai said. “I felt a little bit nervous at times but very proud of staying focused and pretty present throughout.”\n\nThe event was the PGA regular-season finale with only the top 70 in season points advancing to the playoffs that start next week.\n\nThe only player to secure his playoff spot on Sunday was No. 70 Victor Perez of France.\n\n“I knew I needed to do something over this long day,” Perez said. “Felt like I played well.”\n\nAmerican Matt Kuchar, who decided not to finish the 18th hole due to darkness, is assured of not reaching the playoffs for the first time since they began in 2007.\n\nNot since Jack Nicklaus in 1961 has an amateur enjoyed three PGA top-10 finishes but 20-year-old Clanton got his third on Sunday.\n\n“That’s pretty cool,” he said. “It’s awesome being out here. Playing against the best players in the world, it’s pretty sweet.”\n\nClanton played 39 holes on Sunday and is set to compete in the US Amateur starting Monday.\n\nPARIS: Simone Biles stole the show at the Paris Olympics with a captivating comeback that had everyone watching everything she did both in and out of the gymnasium.\n\nAll eyes were on Biles as she won four medals, but the spotlight was bright enough to highlight new names, new faces and some unlikely new stars. The Paris Games will be remembered for breathtaking venues, unprecedented accessibility and Snoop Dogg taking a starring role in NBC’s record-smashing coverage.\n\nParis introduced the world to “The Pommel Horse Guy” and “The Real John Wick” and a meme-making performance by an Australian professor in the Olympic debut of breaking.\n\nFrench swimmer Leon Marchand delivered in his home Olympics with a Michael Phelps-like performance, winning five medals, four of them gold. Ilona Maher angled for a shot on reality TV show “Love Island” after leading the US to a heart-stopping late victory that gave the US its first ever medal, a bronze, in rugby sevens.\n\nNoah Lyles was crowned the fastest man in the world for winning the 100 meters, but after he finished third in the 200 — his first loss in his favorite event since the Tokyo Olympics three years ago — he revealed he had tested positive for COVID-19. Sha’Carri Richardson chased down two competitors in the rain to end her first Olympics with a relay gold after settling for silver in the 100.\n\nThe US won the medal count — 121 of them headed into Sunday’s final day of competition, 37 of them gold — and the Americans again prevailed in men’s basketball and women’s soccer.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the top moments of the Paris Olympics:\n\nBiles soared to gold\n\nBiles returned to the Olympics three years after she pulled out of multiple events at the Tokyo Games for mental health reasons and won four medals, three of them gold.\n\nShe was the most popular attraction in Paris and competed in front of celebrity-packed crowds. Those who couldn’t sit in the stands with Tom Cruise, Spike Lee, Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga tuned in from afar as NBC said 34.7 million viewers across its platforms watched Biles lead the United States to team gold.\n\nNext up for the greatest gymnast in Olympic history is a 30-stop “Gold Over America Tour” for the GOAT.\n\nSwimming struggles\n\nNine days of competition wrapped up with the Americans barely pulling off the lead in the gold-medal standings in swimming, needing a victory in the last race of the Olympics to do so.\n\nThe US finished with just eight golds, its fewest since the 1988 Seoul Games and one ahead of its biggest rival, Australia.\n\n“It’s one of the worst performances in history as a US team,” said Phelps, the most decorated Olympian ever.\n\nThe rest of the world totaled more victories (20) than the US and Australia combined, the first time that’s happened since the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\nTrack troubles\n\nThe 34 medals and 14 golds for the Americans were their best showing in track and field in a non-boycotted Games since the early 20th century, when there were more events and fewer countries.\n\nAnd that came despite the disappointment of Richardson not winning gold in the 100, Lyles losing the 200 after his COVID-19 diagnosis and the men’s 4x100 meter relay fumbling its way to a disqualification.\n\nThe relay performance was so bad that Carl Lewis, a nine-time gold medalist, called for top-to-bottom changes within the American track and field program.\n\nBut the US closed out strong: Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone set another world record in again winning the 400 hurdles, and she then was part of the 4x400 relay team that she and Gabby Thomas led to a runaway win on the final night at Stade de France.\n\nThe American men won gold in the same race in a much closer finish about 15 minutes earlier.\n\nThe 14 golds by the US are the most in a non-boycotted Olympics since 1968.\n\nUSA hoops gets another gold\n\nStephen Curry added more hardware to his legacy as he finally won an Olympic gold medal.\n\nCurry scored 24 points and led the US to a 98-87 win over France in the men’s basketball final. It was the fifth consecutive gold medal for the US — and the 17th in 20 all-time appearances for the Americans at the Games.\n\nKevin Durant, the first four-time men’s gold medalist in Olympic basketball history, scored 15 for the Americans, as did Devin Booker. And LeBron James, wearing metallic gold sneakers, scored 14 for the US as he won his fourth Olympic medal and third gold.\n\nVictor Wembanyama, in his first Olympic final, scored 26 points for France and was in tears after the game.\n\nAmerican women’s soccer team back on top\n\nThe US women’s soccer team won its fifth Olympic gold medal by beating Brazil 1-0 in the final. The Americans had not won gold since the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nThe gold closed out an undefeated run to the title in their first international campaign under new coach Emma Hayes.\n\nAt the final whistle, the US players celebrated as Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the USA.” played in the stadium.\n\nBoxing controversy\n\nWomen’s boxing was dragged into the culture wars over gender misconceptions involving two of the competitors.\n\nImane Khelif of Algeria and Li Yu-ting of Taiwan were heavily scrutinized because of a Russian-dominated International Boxing Association’s decision to disqualify them from last year’s world championships, claiming both failed an eligibility test for women’s competition that IBA officials have declined to answer basic questions about.\n\nKhelif endured intense scrutiny in the ring and online abuse from around the world over misconceptions about her womanhood and still won gold in the women’s welterweight division.\n\nLin won a gold medal in the women’s featherweight division one night later to cap her four-fight unbeaten run through Paris by winning Taiwan’s first Olympic boxing gold medal.\n\n“I’m a woman like any other woman. I was born as a woman, I live as a woman and I am qualified,” Khelif said after her victory.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented step last year of permanently banning the IBA from the Olympics following years of concerns about its governance, competitive fairness and financial transparency. The IOC has called the sex tests that the sport’s governing body imposed on the two boxers irretrievably flawed."
