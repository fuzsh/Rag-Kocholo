        "text": "USMNT vs. Brazil\n\nAllstate Continental Clásico\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nCamping World Stadium; Orlando, Fla.\n\nPre-Game Coverage: 6 p.m. ET on TNT, Telemundo, truTV, Universo, Max, Peacock\n\nKickoff: 7:07 p.m. ET on TNT, Telemundo, truTV, Universo, Max, Peacock, FDP Radio\n\nSocial Media: @USMNT on X and Instagram; U.S. Soccer on Facebook, The U.S. Soccer App\n\nToday’s USMNT Starting XI vs. Brazil: 1-Matt Turner; 3-Chris Richards, 5-Antonee Robinson, 6-Yunus Musah, 7-Gio Reyna, 8-Weston McKennie, 9-Ricardo Pepi, 10-Christian Pulisic (Capt.), 13-Tim Ream, 21-Tim Weah, 22-Joe Scally\n\nSubstitutes: 18-Ethan Horvath, 25-Sean Johnson, 2-Cameron Carter-Vickers, 4-Tyler Adams, 11-Brenden Aaronson, 12-Miles Robinson, 14-Luca de la Torre, 15-Johnny Cardoso, 16-Shaq Moore, 17-Malik Tillman, 19-Haji Wright, 20-Folarin Balogun, 23-Kristoffer Lund, 24-Mark McKenzie, 26-Timmy Tillman\n\nGAME NOTES | FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT BRAZIL\n\nUSMNT Starting XI Cap Numbers (including this match): Christian Pulisic (68), Tim Ream (58), Weston McKennie (53), Antonee Robinson (43), Matt Turner (41), Tim Weah (39), Yunus Musah (37), Gio Reyna (28), Ricardo Pepi (25), Chris Richards (18), Joe Scally (11).\n\nWith an average age of 25 years, 151 days, tonight’s Starting XI is the second youngest lineup the USMNT has fielded in 20 all-time matches against Brazil, coming in behind the XI that began the last meeting on Sept. 7, 2018 (23 years, 111 days).\n\nWith an average of 37.3 caps, tonight’s lineup is the third-most experienced in 71 matches under Gregg Berhalter, ranking behind only the Starting XIs from the 2019 Gold Cup Final against Mexico (43.2) and Semifinal against Jamaica (39.4).\n\nBerhalter makes two lineup changes from Saturday’s match against Colombia, inserting striker Ricardo Pepi for Folarin Balogun and midfielder Yunus Musah for Johnny Cardoso.\n\nPepi earns his first start of the year and just the second in his last 12 international appearances, while Musah earns his second start of 2024.\n\nChristian Pulisic captains the team for the 23rd time tonight, tying Thomas Dooley for eighth on the USMNT’s all-time captains list. The USA is 16W-3L-3D when Pulisic wears the armband.\n\nFour starters have previous senior international experience against Brazil: Tim Ream (Sept. 8, 2015); Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson and Tim Weah (Sept. 7, 2018). Substitute Tyler Adams also appeared in the 2018 match in East Rutherford, N.J.\n\nWeah recorded his sixth international goal and 10th career goal contribution for the USA in Saturday’s match against Colombia.\n\nMcKennie makes his 50th career start, becoming the 43rd player to start a half century of USMNT matches.\n\nMaking his 11th appearance tonight, fullback Joe Scally starts back-to-back games during the same international window for the first time.\n\nWith their starts against No. 5-ranked Brazil, Scally, Pepi and Chris Richards will make their first appearances against a top-five team in the FIFA World Rankings.\n\nGoalkeeper Matt Turner made his USMNT debut in Orlando, saving a penalty kick to keep his first clean sheet in the 7-0 win against Trinidad and Tobago on Jan. 31, 2021 at INTER&Co. Stadium.\n\nPulisic recorded his first career hat trick in Orlando, coming in the 5-1 win against Panama in World Cup qualifying on March 27, 2022.\n\nThough born in Denville, N.J., substitute midfielder Johnny Cardoso grew up in Porto Alegre, Brazil.\n\nThe USA is 7-2-0 all-time in Orlando, winning each of its last seven matches in The City Beautiful.\n\nThis is the USMNT’s first appearance at Camping World Stadium (formerly the Citrus Bowl), since a 1-0 win against Sweden on Jan. 24, 1998, a match where Gregg Berhalter earned his first start in his third international cap.\n\nBerhalter is 43W-15L-12D in 70 matches as USMNT head coach.\n\nThe USMNT is 1W-18L-0D all-time against Brazil, with the team’s only win coming behind Preki Radosavljevic’s goal in a 1-0 victory in the Gold Cup Semifinal on Feb. 10, 1998. The team’s 11-match winless streak against Brazil is currently the longest of any international opponent.\n\nForward Josh Sargent (foot injury), is not dressed for tonight’s match. Six substitutions are allowed in three different moments. Halftime does not count as a substitution moment.\n\nTonight’s match will be officiated by Mario Escobar of Guatemala. The USMNT is 3W-1L-2D in six matches refereed by Escobar."
