        "text": "It may not feel like it yet, but football season is getting closer. The NFL Draft is already behind us and the NFL preseason is just around the corner.\n\nIn one of the most highly anticipated events of the offseason, the NFL officially unveiled the 2024-25 schedule for all 32 teams on May 15. The schedules were revealed during a two-hour television special on NFL Network.\n\nWhile every team already knew their opponents for the upcoming season prior to Wednesday’s reveal, they didn’t know when those matchups would be. Now, NFL fans and bettors alike can start circling critical matchups and primetime games on their calendars.\n\nThe full week-by-week schedule can be found here. The full preseason schedule can be found here.\n\nNow that the full schedule is out, let’s take a closer look at some important dates to know along with early betting odds for key games.\n\nHow is the NFL Schedule Decided?\n\nEvery NFL team faces its three divisional rivals twice – once at home and once on the road – for a total of six divisional games per team.\n\nTeams also play all four teams from a division in the opposing conference (AFC or NFC) and all four teams from another division in their own conference. These matchups are determined on a rotating multi-year cycle.\n\nFurthermore, teams play two opponents in their own conference based on their records from the previous year. The opponent for the 17th game rotates annually and helps ensure that every team plays each other at least once every four years.\n\nThe NFL expanded the league’s schedule to 17 games in 2021, making this the fourth year of teams playing 17 games.\n\nIs the 2024-25 NFL Schedule Out Yet?\n\nYes, the 2024-25 NFL schedule was released at 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 15, 2024. The schedule has dates, times and locations for every upcoming game during the regular season.\n\nFollowing the schedule release, our favorite online sportsbooks began posting moneylines, spreads and Over/Under totals for matchups.\n\nSeveral games were announced before the full schedule was released, including the season opener between the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens along with all five international games.\n\nWhat Time is the NFL Schedule Released?\n\nThe full 2024-25 NFL schedule was released at 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 15.\n\nWhile the schedule release used to happen over social media and several marquee games are still announced that way, it’s quickly become one of the league’s most popular offseason events along with the NFL Draft.\n\nAs mentioned above, certain games were announced ahead of time before the full schedule was released.\n\nWho Has the Hardest NFL Schedule in 2024-25?\n\nThe best way to determine a team’s strength of schedule is by looking at the previous year’s results and future projections based on offseason roster moves and NFL Draft selections.\n\nBased on last year’s records, the Cleveland Browns have the hardest strength of schedule. Their opponents went 158-131 last season, compiling a .547 winning percentage.\n\nThe Browns aren’t the only AFC North team with a tough schedule, however. The Ravens have the second-hardest schedule (.536 opponent winning percentage) based on last year’s results, while the Pittsburgh Steelers have the third-toughest slate (.533). Their division was the only one last year where three of the four teams won at least 10 games.\n\nOn the other hand, the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons are tied for the easiest strength of schedule, as their opponents went 131-158 (.453) last season. Both play in the NFC South, which was the only division without a 10-win team last season.\n\nWhat is the First Game of the 2024-25 NFL Season?\n\nThe season opener will be a rematch of last year’s AFC Championship Game between the Chiefs and Ravens at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. The matchup features the league’s last two MVPs (Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson) in a game that could end up being a playoff preview.\n\nThe game kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET on Thursday, Sept. 5, on NBC. The defending champion Chiefs are early 3-point home favorites at most of our favorite NFL betting sites.\n\nHow Long is the NFL Schedule This Year?\n\nThe 2024-25 NFL regular-season schedule has 18 weeks (each team gets a bye week) and 272 total games over a four-month span from September to early January. Every game can be bet on at online sportsbooks.\n\nThere are also three weeks of preseason games prior to the regular season and four rounds of playoff games (Wild Card Round, Divisional Round, Conference Championship and Super Bowl), stretching the season from August to February.\n\nWho is the Favorite to Win the 2025 Super Bowl?\n\nAfter winning each of the last two Super Bowls and three of the last five, the Chiefs are favored to win Super Bowl LIX in 2025 with +500 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. If Kansas City wins again, it will become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive Super Bowls.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers, who lost to the Chiefs in last year’s Super Bowl, have the second-best odds at DraftKings (+600).\n\nTo see your favorite team’s Super Bowl odds, check out our NFL futures guide here.\n\nUnique Games\n\nThe NFL’s quest to take over every holiday will continue in 2024, as there will once again be games on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Christmas.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, the Detroit Lions will kick off the NFL’s annual Turkey Day tripleheader with a home game against the Chicago Bears. The New York Giants will travel to Dallas to take on the Cowboys in the afternoon, while the night game features the Green Bay Packers welcoming the Miami Dolphins to Lambeau Field.\n\nThe following day, the Las Vegas Raiders will head to Kansas City to face the Chiefs on Black Friday. These teams also faced each other on Christmas last year, so they’re no strangers to meeting on holidays.\n\nThis season will mark Tom Brady’s first year in the broadcast booth. His first game will be the Cowboys’ matchup against the Browns in Week 1. He’ll work with Kevin Burkhardt in the booth for FOX’s No. 1 broadcasting team.\n\nWeek 1 also features the first NFL game ever played in South America when the Packers take on the Philadelphia Eagles in São Paulo, Brazil. It’s the first time since 1970 that an NFL game will take place on a Friday during Week 1.\n\nNFL Netflix Games\n\nThis season will also see Netflix air NFL games for the first time in its history.\n\nThe streaming service will broadcast both of the NFL games on Christmas. The first game of the holiday doubleheader is an AFC showdown between the Chiefs and Steelers at 1 p.m. ET, followed by a playoff rematch between the Ravens and Houston Texans at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThis season marks the first year of a three-year agreement between Netflix and the NFL. Netflix will host at least one Christmas game in 2025 and 2026 as well.\n\nThe deal is part of Netflix’s recent foray into live sports. Netflix will also host this summer’s big boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson.\n\nNFL 2024-25 International Games\n\nThe 2024-25 schedule features five international games — a testament to the sport’s growing presence across the world. The first international game will be played in Brazil in Week 1, followed by three London games in October. The fifth and final international game will take place in Germany in November.\n\nHere’s a look at FanDuel’s odds for each of this season’s international games:\n\nGreen Bay Packers vs. Philadelphia Eagles\n\nWhere: Arena Corinthians (São Paulo, Brazil)\n\nWhen: 8:21 p.m. ET on Sept. 6 (Week 1)\n\nMoneyline: Packers +114, Eagles -134\n\nSpread: Packers +1.5 (-105), Eagles -1.5 (-115)\n\nTotal: Over/Under 48.5 (-105/-115)\n\nNew York Jets vs. Minnesota Vikings\n\nWhere: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, U.K.)\n\nWhen: 9:30 a.m. ET on Oct. 6 (Week 5)\n\nMoneyline: Jets -186, Vikings +156\n\nSpread: Jets -3.5 (-115), Vikings +3.5 (-105)\n\nTotal: Over/Under 42.5 (-115/-105)\n\nJacksonville Jaguars vs. Chicago Bears\n\nWhere: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (London, U.K.)\n\nWhen: 9:30 a.m. ET on Oct. 13 (Week 6)\n\nMoneyline: Jaguars -116, Bears -102\n\nSpread: Jaguars -1.5 (-104), Bears +1.5 (-118)\n\nTotal: Over/Under 46.5 (-105/-115)\n\nNew England Patriots vs. Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nWhere: Wembley Stadium (London, U.K.)\n\nWhen: 9:30 a.m. ET on Oct. 20 (Week 7)\n\nMoneyline: Patriots +250, Jaguars -310\n\nSpread: Patriots +6.5 (-110), Jaguars -6.5 (-110)\n\nTotal: Over/Under 40.5 (-115/-105)\n\nNew York Giants vs. Carolina Panthers\n\nWhere: Allianz Arena (Munich, Germany)\n\nWhen: 9:30 a.m. ET on Nov. 10 (Week 10)\n\nMoneyline: Giants -124, Panthers +106\n\nSpread: Giants -1.5 (-110), Panthers +1.5 (-110)\n\nTotal: Over/Under 40.5 (-110/-110)\n\nNFL Tickets Overview\n\nWhile every sport is best enjoyed in person, there’s something different about seeing an NFL game live. The sights, sounds and smells combine to create an experience that simply can’t be replicated at home. Also, what’s more fun than tailgating?\n\nThe NFL schedule is relatively short with only 17 regular-season games, but it still spans three different seasons. Unless their team plays in a dome, fans can choose whether to catch a game in the summer heat, the autumn chill or the freezing winter.\n\nUnfortunately for fans, fewer games translate to higher ticket prices. Each NFL team is only guaranteed eight or nine home games per season, compared to 41 in the NBA and NHL and 81 in MLB. Given the league’s staggering popularity, many NFL games are sellouts, making tickets hard to come by and increasingly expensive.\n\nTicket prices can also vary greatly depending on the opponent, timing and location in the stadium. Early-season games in better weather tend to be more popular than late-season games in cold weather, by which point one or both teams might be out of the playoff hunt.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s take a closer look at how much an NFL fan can expect to shell out for a ticket.\n\nWhat’s the Average Cost of an NFL Ticket?\n\nAccording to TicketSmarter, the average price of an NFL ticket in 2023 cost $377 — a 60% jump from the average ticket price in 2022 ($235).\n\nTicket prices have been steadily rising for decades, but such a large year-over-year jump is remarkable.\n\nOne explanation is the pent-up demand for all forms of entertainment (not just football) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The public health emergency ending in 2023 caused a spike in dining, travel and sports attendance as life returned to normal. People who had stayed away from those activities for the previous three years rejoined the market and tried to make up for lost time.\n\nThe NFL is also more popular than ever, largely fueled by heightened interest in fantasy sports and sports betting. Attendance and TV ratings both increased in 2023, and the 2023-24 NFL Playoffs were the most-watched playoffs in league history.\n\nThe issue for fans is that there’s only a finite number of seats at every stadium, so demand often exceeds supply, leading to increased prices.\n\nWhich NFL Team Has the Most Expensive Ticket?\n\nPer TicketSmarter, the Las Vegas Raiders have the most expensive ticket in the NFL. Their average ticket price was $582 for the 2023 season.\n\nWhile the Raiders have had a losing record in each of the last two seasons, they benefit from Las Vegas’ massive tourism industry drawing football fans from all over the country. They also play at Allegiant Stadium – one of the newest and nicest stadiums in the NFL.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were second at $578, which makes sense given that they’ve won three of the past five Super Bowls. The Chiefs were extra popular in 2023 thanks to the presence of Taylor Swift, who attended several games to support her boyfriend Travis Kelce.\n\nComing off a Super Bowl appearance the previous year, the Philadelphia Eagles were third in average ticket price at $559.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the Atlanta Falcons had the cheapest average ticket cost at $225. They’ve endured six straight losing seasons since their last playoff berth in 2017.\n\nHow Much Does a Super Bowl Ticket Cost?\n\nThe average ticket to see the Chiefs play the San Francisco 49ers at Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas cost $8,600. Some tickets sold for as much as $37,000 — the highest Super Bowl ticket prices on record.\n\nPrior to that, the highest average ticket price for the Super Bowl was $6,370 for Super Bowl LIV in 2020 — a game that was also played between the Chiefs and 49ers.\n\nRegardless of which teams play in the Super Bowl, tickets are guaranteed to be much more expensive than other games and sporting events due to its importance and enormous popularity."
