        "text": "Liverpool are reportedly â€˜seriously consideringâ€™ testing the resolve of Genoa for Morten Frendrup, who they are long-term admirers of, and he could become the first signing of the Arne Slot reign.\n\nThe Reds have yet to sign a single player under Slot, who has had the whole summer window to do business. Reports regularly suggest moves are coming, but as yet, there has been little movement.\n\nNobody other than Adrian has left permanently, though, so if no moves were to be made, the squad would not be in a bad place.\n\nThat said, Slot will clearly want to make it his own, and moves in the midfield have been cited as the main objective for now, with Frendrup potentially top of the list.\n\nGIVEMESPORT states Frendrup is a long-term target, with scouts having watched his performances over the past few months.\n\nAnd the report also suggests the Genoa man could become â€˜the first signingâ€™ of the Slot era at Liverpool. Indeed, itâ€™s believed the Reds are â€˜seriously consideringâ€™ testing the resolve of the Serie A side with a bid for the midfield general.\n\nGenoa are said to want to make Â£21million from Frendrup, and Liverpool, having not signed anybody yet, should surely have no problems with that sort of outlay.\n\nMORE LIVERPOOL TRANSFER NEWS FROM F365\n\nðŸ‘‰ Liverpool â€˜launch offerâ€™ to sign â€˜worldâ€™s bestâ€™ to â€˜replaceâ€™ Klopp favourite after â€˜interesting twistâ€™\n\nðŸ‘‰ Liverpool: â€˜Specialist priorityâ€™ target from â€˜outside PLâ€™ is â€˜one to watchâ€™ amid three signing reveal\n\nWith the clock ticking down on the transfer window, and no players having come through the door yet, Liverpoolâ€™s desire to give their current midfield crop competition could mean a move for Frendrup is made.\n\nThe caution of Slot to not rush into any transfers is mentioned, so even with the clock ticking down, heâ€™s unlikely to pull the trigger for no reason.\n\nBut after months of watching Frendrup, who scored twice and assisted five times in 37 Serie A games last season, while also showing heâ€™s very capable defensively, Slot could be convinced to make the move.\n\nAlternatively, heâ€™s said to have an eye on Martin Zubimendi, who is said to be the â€˜priorityâ€™ at Liverpool towards the back end of the transfer window.\n\nBut heâ€™ll cost Â£51million, which is Â£30million more than they can get Frendrup for, so financially, that move is not a simple one to say yes to, especially given competition from Manchester United."
