        "text": "RAFAEL DA SILVA (2008 – 2015)\n\nArguably the most successful of the Samba stars to grace the Old Trafford turf to date, Rafael quickly became a fans’ favourite following his arrival from Fluminense. The energetic right-back proved to be a revelation under Sir Alex during an outstanding debut season in 2008/09, in which he was shortlisted for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, and firmly established himself as a regular starter when captain Gary Neville hung up his boots in 2011. Rafael helped the Reds to win three Premier League titles, the League Cup, three Community Shields and the Club World Cup during seven stellar years at the club. He demonstrated his eye for a spectacular goal, with stunning strikes against Arsenal, Liverpool and Queen Park Rangers among the five he scored in his 170 appearances for the Reds, before joining Lyon, in France. Following a year at Turkish outfit İstanbul Basaksehir, Rafael moved back to his native Brazil, where he currently plays for Botafogo in the Brazilian Serie A.\n\nFABIO DA SILVA (2008 – 2015)\n\nThe twin brother of Rafael, Fabio joined United at the same time after impressing club scouts at the 2005 Nike Premier Cup in Hong Kong, where the pair starred for a Fluminense youth team, and moved to Manchester in January 2008 without ever playing for the Fluminense first team. Although he was unable to establish himself in the first team in the same way as his sibling, largely due to Patrice Evra’s consistency in his main position at left-back, Fabio still turned out 56 times for the Reds during his five-year stay at the club. He also played the full 90 minutes in the 2011 Champions League final defeat to Barcelona at Wembley – in the same year he won his only Premier League winners’ medal. After a loan spell at Queens Park Rangers in 2012/13, the versatile defender has since gone on to play for Cardiff City and Middlesbrough and came up against the Reds in the Premier League for both clubs. Fabio now plays for French outfit Nantes.\n\nFRED (2018 - present)\n\nFred joined the Reds from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2018 and has proved to be a hugely reliable performer. The midfielder made his United debut on the opening day of the 2018/19 season and grabbed his first goal a month later, in a 1-1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. Nimble, hard working and with an excellent range of passing, Fred really proved what a talent he is in 2019/20, a campaign in which only two team-mates made more appearances in all competitions. The Brazilian continued to impress in 2020/21 and then, in 2021/22, he produced his best season to date on a personal level. Fred made 36 appearances, scoring four goals and assisting six. What's more, the 29-year-old reached the milestone of 100 Premier League appearances, scoring in his landmark match against Leicester. He also played a pivotal role in key victories over Leeds, Arsenal and Crystal Palace.\n\nALEX TELLES (2020 - present)\n\nAlex Telles moved to Old Trafford from Porto in October 2020, having gaining a reputation as one of the most revered left-backs in world football. Telles hit the ground running at United, and accumulated 24 and 25 appearances respectively in his first two seasons at the club. With a wealth of Champions League experience under his belt, the 29-year-old was a key figure for the Reds as we reached the final of the 2020/21 Europa League. Despite missing the beginning of the 2021/22 season due to injury, Telles established himself as a regular in both the Premier League and Champions League after the turn of the year. Despite being a defender by trade, our Brazilian left-back is also known for his attacking tendencies, and his sublime volley against Villareal in the Champions League was nominated for UEFA's Champions League Goal of the Year."
