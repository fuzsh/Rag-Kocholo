        "text": "PARIS — The United States women’s volleyball team was barely tested in its Olympic quarterfinal against Poland as the defending champions knocked out the World No. 4 team 25-22, 25-14, 25-20 on Tuesday to set up a semifinal clash with Brazil, which is undefeated in Paris.\n\nAndrea Drews was top scorer for the Americans with 13 points and was well supported by Kathryn Plummer and Avery Skinner with 12 points apiece.\n\nAlthough Poland had a healthy lead in the third set, the Americans rediscovered their rhythm with a series of blocks to lift the team and take the lead before sealing the win.\n\n“We definitely have some experienced players who calmed things down a bit. This Olympics, rarely will teams go 3-0, so I’m really pleased with the way we mentally stayed in it despite having a slower start (in the third set),” Drews said.\n\nTokyo Games silver medalist Brazil beat the Dominican Republic in straight sets to advance to the final four.\n\n“We didn’t know what to expect because we knew they are a good team. Their attacking is really good,” Brazil’s Julia Bergmann said after the 25-22, 25-13, 25-17 victory.\n\nWhile the U.S. has dropped five sets in Paris, Brazil charged into the knockouts as the only team not to drop one.\n\n“We’ve dropped a lot and been able to come back on top,” American middle blocker Haleigh Washington said.\n\n“I like a little adversity and I always love playing Brazil. They’re always so competitive, they have a ton of fans here, so the atmosphere is going to be electric.”\n\nTURKEY, ITALY MOVE ON\n\nEuropean champions Turkey reached the Olympic semifinals for the first time by beating China 3-2 in a see-saw encounter.\n\nDespite injuries on the Turkish team, they beat China in a rematch of last year’s Volleyball Nations League final where the European side claimed their first title.\n\nCuban-born Melissa Vargas was Turkey’s lynchpin with a whopping 42 points that included 38 kills as they prevailed 23-25, 25-21, 26-24, 21-25, 15-12.\n\nVargas, who was named the most valuable player at the European Championship last year, fell two points shy of equaling Croatian Barbara Jelic’s record for most points in an Olympic match.\n\n“Today we played with our hearts. We have a lot of injuries and I am so proud of my players. We put everything on the line to reach the semifinals,” Turkey’s Italian coach Daniele Santarelli said.\n\n“We didn’t play amazing volleyball. We have a lot of limits, but anything can happen; we’re going to the semifinals.”\n\nTurkey will play Italy after the world’s top-ranked side beat Serbia in straight sets, 26-24, 25-20, 25-20.\n\nChina won gold in 2016 and outside hitter Zhu Ting said the Paris Games could be her last Olympics.\n\n“I will cherish every match and every opportunity to touch the ball. If I get injured again, these touches could be the last of my career. That’s why I value it so much,” the 29-year-old said.\n\n–Reuters, Special to Field Level Media"
