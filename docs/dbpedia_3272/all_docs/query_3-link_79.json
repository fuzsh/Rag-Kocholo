        "text": "Liverpool and Thiago Alcantara went their separate ways this summer, but based on this clip, there is clearly a lot of love from him towards the club.\n\nAny lingering doubts about potential animosity following the midfielder's injury-ridden final season and a half in the Premier League have been put to rest by the recently retired star.\n\nThiago, 33, surprised many when he hung up his boots after his contract with Anfield expired. His persistent fitness issues worsened during his tenure under Jurgen Klopp, leading him to feel that he could no longer contribute at a high level on the pitch.\n\nRory McIlroy proven correct over LIV Golf warning after controversial weekend\n\nLenny Yoro injury update as Man United fears come true\n\nUpon retiring, Thiago immediately transitioned into coaching. He is currently spending the summer with his former club Barcelona, assisting new coach Hansi Flick, who he previously played for at Bayern Munich.\n\nFOLLOW ALL OF OUR SOCCER COVERAGE\n\nReports suggest that he is playing a crucial role at Barcelona, with his language skills and familiarity with the club proving invaluable as Flick settles in. It will be intriguing to see what unfolds at the end of the summer; it seems inevitable that Thiago will follow in the footsteps of another ex-Liverpool midfielder, Xabi Alonso, and become a head coach.\n\nIn his new role at Barcelona, he has crossed paths with former teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic during pre-season. The pair shared the dressing room at Nou Camp from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIbrahimovic, who hung up his boots at Milan last year, is now dishing out advice as an advisor for the club. In a recent friendly that saw Barcelona face off against the Italian team, the match ended in a 2-2 draw, with Barcelona ultimately losing on penalties.\n\nBarcelona's Robert Lewandowski netted twice, but Luka Jovic and Christian Pulisic levelled the score for Milan. Missed penalties from Jules Kounde and young gun Mikayil Faye sealed the win for Milan.\n\nHowever, Liverpool fans are buzzing over a clip that's gone viral, shared by Milan and 433, showing Zlatan's banter with Barcelona's squad and staff, including Thiago. A highlight of the video is when Zlatan asks \"English? \" and Thiago's heartwarming reply: \"No, no, Scouser.\"\n\nThe clip takes a sombre turn as Thiago seems to touch on his hip issue, likely the culprit behind his retirement, which has also plagued him during his time at Liverpool.\n\nWhile his absence on the field is a loss, Thiago's potential in coaching is undeniable. With his love for Liverpool evident, there's chatter about a possible return to Anfield in the future.\n\nFor the moment, all eyes are on Arne Slot as he takes the reins."
