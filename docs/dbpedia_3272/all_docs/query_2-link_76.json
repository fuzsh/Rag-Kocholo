        "text": "BRASILIA, Brazil -\n\nDeforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest slowed by nearly half compared to the year before, according to government satellite data released Wednesday. It's the largest reduction since 2016, when officials began using the current method of measurement.\n\nIn the past 12 months, the Amazon rainforest lost 4,300 square kilometers (1,700 square miles) of land, roughly the size of Rhode Island. That is a nearly 46 per cent decrease compared to the previous period. Brazil's deforestation surveillance year runs from August 1 to July 30.\n\nStill, much remains to be done to end the destruction, and the month of July showed a 33 per cent increase in tree cutting over July 2023. A strike by officials at federal environmental agencies contributed to this surge, said Joao Paulo Capobianco, executive secretary for the Environment Ministry, during a press conference in Brasilia.\n\nTop climate and environment headlines, all in one place\n\nThe figures are preliminary and come from the Deter satellite sytem, managed by the National Institute for Space Research, a federal agency and used by environmental law enforcement agencies to detect real-time deforestation. The most accurate deforestation calculations are usually released in November.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged \"deforestation zero\" by 2030. His current term ends in January 2027. Amazon deforestation has steeply declined since the end of far-right President Jair Bolsolonaro's rule in 2022. Under his government, forest loss reached a 15-year high.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil. It remains the world's largest rainforest, covering an area twice the size of India. The Amazon absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide, keeping the climate from warming even faster than it would otherwise. It also holds about 20 per cent of the world's fresh water and biodiversity that scientists have not come close to understanding yet, including at least 16,000 tree species.\n\nAt the same time, deforestation in Brazil's vast savannah, known as the Cerrado, increased by nine per cent. The native vegetation loss reached 7,015 square kilometres (2,708 square miles) -- an area 63 per cent larger than the destruction in the Amazon.\n\nThe Cerrado is the world's most biodiverse savannah, but less of it enjoys protected status than the rainforest to its north. Brazil's boom in soybeans, the country's second-largest export, have largely come from privately-owned areas in the Cerrado.\n\n\"The Cerrado has become a 'sacrificed biome.' Its topography lends itself to mechanized, large-scale commodity production, and it has little legal protection,\" Isabel Figueiredo, a spokesperson with the nonprofit Society, Population and Nature Institute told The Associated Press. Both Brazilians and the international community are more concerned about forests than savanna and open landscapes, she said, even though these ecosystems are also extremely biodiverse and essential for climate balance.\n\nTo control deforestation in the long term, monitoring, such as with satellites, and law enforcement are not enough, said Paulo Barreto via email, a researcher with the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment.\n\nNew protected areas are needed, both within and outside Indigenous territory, as well as more transparency so that slaughterhouses document where their cattle are coming from. Cattle ranching is the leading driver of deforestation in the Amazon. Degraded pasture lands also need to be replanted as forest, Barreto said, and there must be stricter rules for the financial sector to prevent the funding of deforestation.\n\n------\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.
