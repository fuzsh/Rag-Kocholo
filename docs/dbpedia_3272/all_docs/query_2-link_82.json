Lautaro Martínez scored in the 112th minute to give Argentina its second straight Copa America title.\n\nThe match was a physical war that saw multiple players on both sides take hits and suffer injuries. Argentina star Lionel Messi suffered a non-contact injury in the 64th minute that forced him to be subbed off. Messi, who has been dealing with a leg issue throughout this year's tournament, is likely playing in his last Copa America and was visibly emotional when he left the game.\n\nIn the end, Martinez notched his fifth goal of the tournament, which led all players this year, to give Argentina the win and provide Messi with another international title in his legendary career.\n\nThird Place: Uruguay Defeats Canada On Penalties\n\n3 of 19\n\nGrant Halverson/Getty Images\n\nUruguay 2 (4-3), Canada 2\n\nUruguay finished third at Copa América 2024 after defeating Canada on penalties following a late comeback Saturday night.\n\nCanada was moments away from clinching third place in the tournament when Luis Suárez evened the score in the 93rd minute.\n\nSergio Rochet then turned aside Canada's third penalty attempt to give Uruguay the edge.\n\nAfter Suárez made a fourth penalty for Uruguay, Alphonso Davies hit the crossbar on Canada's final attempt.\n\nUruguay now earns a podium finish after a strong tournament start saw them outscore opponents 9-1 in the groups stage before eliminating Brazil on penalties in the quarterfinals.\n\nSemifinals: Argentina Beats Canada, 2-0; 10-man Colombia Survives Uruguay\n\n4 of 19\n\nRobin Alam/ISI Photos/Getty Images\n\nColombia 1, Uruguay 0\n\nIf Argentina's win over Canada felt relatively assured throughout, Colombia's win over Uruguay couldn't have been more opposite—or more dramatic.\n\nJefferson Lerma's first-half goal was enough to get Colombia past Uruguay, 1-0, but it couldn't have been much closer.\n\nThat was thanks in large part to Colombia's Daniel Muñoz, who earned himself one of the silliest red cards you'll see with his lack of composure early in the second half:\n\nThat left Colombia to defend with 10 men for basically the entire second half, already a tall task given the amount of chances Uruguay created throughout the match:\n\nIn the end, however, the defense stood tall, and it was Colombia who offered two of the biggest shock misses of the match:\n\nAfter that sort of game, it wasn't shocking when sparks flew following the final whistle:\n\nDrama, from start to finish.\n\nWhat a game. What a tournament. Argentina awaits in the final.\n\nArgentina 2, Canada 0\n\nArgentina were heavily favored coming into Tuesday's matchup with Canada, and it showed.\n\nJulián Álvarez and Lionel Messi each scored for Argentina in their 2-0 victory over Canada, a relatively drama-free result for the defending World Cup champions.\n\nIt was Messi's first goal of the tournament.\n\nCanada were perhaps a bit unlucky to not find the back of the net, creating a number of chances throughout the contest.\n\nGranted, Argentina probably had another goal or two in them as well, just missing several chances to win by an even wider margin.\n\nUltimately, the better team won. Argentina will also be favored against either Colombia, though it should be an even tougher match than Canada were able to provide.\n\nQuarterfinals: Colombia Wins 5-0 over Panama; Uruguay Defeats Brazil in Penalties\n\n5 of 19\n\nCHRIS CODUTO/AFP via Getty Images\n\nColombia 5, Panama 0\n\nColombia stretched its unbeaten streak to 27 games Saturday as team captain James Rodríguez set up two goals and scored on a penalty to lead his team to a 5-0 win over Panama.\n\nThe team is now headed to a semifinal match against Uruguay.\n\nColombia got off to a strong start with goals in the first 15 minutes from Jhon Córdoba and Rodríguez:\n\nGoaltender Camilo Vargas made a save in the 18th minute to keep the sheet clean for Colombia:\n\nLuis Díaz scored in the 41st minute, Richard Ríos tallied in the 70th, and Miguel Borja finished off the win with a penalty in injury time.\n\nPanama attempted to adjust with substitutions in the second half but was unable to overcome the early deficit.\n\nColombia is now headed to the Copa semifinals for the third time in four tournaments.\n\nThose last two instances ended in disappointment after semifinal losses to Chile in 2016 and Argentina in 2021. Colombia will now hope to ride the team's ongoing unbeaten streak to a different result against Uruguay.\n\nUruguay 0 (4-2), Brazil 0\n\nAfter a scoreless 120 minutes, late heroics from goaltender Sergio Rochet led Urugay to defeat Brazil 4-2 in penalties.\n\nRochet blocked an opening penalty from Brazil's Éder Militão to start off the shootout:\n\nBrazil goaltender Alisson Becker also turned aside a penalty, but Manuel Ugarte scored the game-winning penalty to push Uruguay through to the semifinals.\n\nThat wasn't Rochet's first big save of the night. He also came up big in the 34th minute to keep Brazil off the board.\n\nThere were 41 fouls called in Saturday's game, making it the most penalized game of the tournament so far.\n\nFour yellow cards were handed out, while a red card left Uruguay down to 10 men late after Nahitan Nández was sent off.\n\nUruguay prevailed to eliminate the 2019 tournament champions and will now advance to face Colombia in the semifinals.\n\nQuarterfinals: Canada Beats Venezuela in Penalties\n\n6 of 19\n\nBuda Mendes/Getty Images\n\nCanada is making the most of its first-ever Copa América appearance, advancing to the semifinals on Friday after beating Venezuela 4-3 on penalties.\n\nThe two teams were tied at one going into penalty kicks.\n\nCanada broke through first thanks to a Jacob Shaffelburg 13th-minute goal. Credit goes to Jonathan David for warding off his defender off a throw-in and finding Shaffelburg with a great pass for the goal.\n\nImmediately afterward, Shaffelburg honored injured teammate Tajon Buchanan, who suffered a broken tibia during practice this week.\n\nCanada had a few more chances in the first half but could not get a second goal.\n\nIn the second half, Venezuela scored arguably the goal of the tournament in the 64th minute, when Salomón Rondón scored from more than 35 yards out on a fast break, catching Maxime Crépeau off his line.\n\nJon Aramburu deserves great recognition here for starting the fast break and finding Rondón with the long pass downfield.\n\nCanada found itself with two great chances to take the lead back but could not finish.\n\nThe two teams later went to penalties, which were tied at three after five turns apiece.\n\nCrépeau came through with a huge save on Wilker Ángel.\n\nIsmaël Koné then stepped up for the game-winner, sending Canada to the semfinals.\n\nCanada will now get a rematch against Argentina, who beat them 2-0 in group play. That match will take place Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nQuarterfinals: Argentina Defeats Ecuador in Penalties, Moves onto Semis\n\n7 of 19\n\nBuda Mendes/Getty Images\n\nArgentina has qualified for the Copa América semifinals for the fifth straight time and seventh in eight occurrences after defeating Ecuador in penalties 4-2 on Thursday in Houston.\n\nThe two sides went into penalties tied at one.\n\nArgentina struck first in the 35th minute after Lisandro Martínez put in a header that just crossed the goal line. A nifty header from Alexis Mac Allister off a corner kick to the far post set up the goal, and Martínez did the rest.\n\nEcuador had a prime chance for the equalizer after Rodrigo De Paul committed a handball in the box in the 60th minute.\n\nHowever, Enner Valencia's no-look penalty hit the post.\n\nArgentina looked well-positioned for the win, but Ecuador kept fighting and finally broke through in stoppage time when Kevin Rodríguez headed in a John Yeboah cross.\n\nEcuador kept the pressure going and nearly put this one away soon afterward after Alan Minda found Jordy Caicedo with a cross, but his header went wide right.\n\nThe match then went right to penalties, which saw drama early when Lionel Messi's offering for Argentina went off the crossbar.\n\nBut Argentina goalie Emiliano Martínez was the hero, saving Ecuador's next two attempts.\n\nArgentina converted its four remaining penalties courtesy of Julián Álvarez, Alexis Mac Allister, Gonzalo Montiel and Nicolás Otamendi, with the last player clinching the win.\n\nArgentina will play the winner of Venezuela and Canada on Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nGroup D: Costa Rica Defeats Paraguay 2-1, Brazil Draws Colombia\n\n8 of 19\n\nLachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n\nCosta Rica 2, Paraguay 1\n\nCosta Rica jumped out to an early advantage, then maintained the lead to hold onto a 2-1 win over Paraguay on Tuesday night in Austin, Texas.\n\nParaguay was already eliminated entering the match, although its opponent still had a slim chance to move on. In order to advance to the knockout stage, Costa Rica needed a win and a Brazil loss. However, the team also needed to make up a deficit of at least six in goal difference.\n\nIt initially appeared as if the improbable scenario was in play, as a header from Francisco Calvo put the team on the board before the three-minute mark.\n\nCosta Rica jumped out to a 2-0 advantage after just seven minutes due to another goal from Josimar Alcócer.\n\nHowever, the team struggled to generate scoring opportunities and would allow a goal to Paraguay early in the second half. Ramón Sosa delivered a strike into the back of the net off his right foot in the 55th minute, ending Costa Rica's hopes of advancing.\n\nCosta Rica prevented the result from ending as a draw due to an incredible save from Patrick Sequeira.\n\nAlthough both teams were eliminated, Costa Rica still ended the competition on a high note.\n\nBrazil 1, Colombia 1\n\nBrazil was able to prevent a tough loss and avoid potential elimination on Tuesday, as the team nearly recorded a win against Colombia. A Raphinha free kick put Brazil up 1-0 in the 12th minute, jeopardizing Colombia's unbeaten streak.\n\nColombia nearly recorded the equalizer due to a header in the 19th minute, although it was ruled offsides after review.\n\nTensions started to flare between both teams in the first half, as multiple players needed to be separated following a foul from Brazil.\n\nColombia eventually tied the score at 1-1 before the end of the first half following a goal from Daniel Muñoz.\n\nAlthough the match remained scoreless in the second half, both teams had several chances to pull ahead.\n\nBrazil is now set to face off against Uruguay in the quarterfinals, while Colombia will take on Panama to begin the knockout stage.\n\nGroup C: United States Eliminated After Loss to Uruguay, Panama Advances\n\n9 of 19\n\nBill Barrett/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images for USSF\n\nThe United States won't advance to the quarterfinal after falling to Uruguay 1-0 on Monday.\n\nA physical first half left the United States and Uruguay with nothing to show for on the scoreboard. There were a handful of opportunities for both teams to find the net in the first 45, with the United States getting one chance within the first 15 minutes.\n\nLater on in the first half, Uruguay nearly found the net after a questionable play saw the official pull the yellow card but allow the game to continue.\n\nUruguay once again had a solid opportunity to score, this time in the second half, but the United States held strong on defense to keep them out of the net.\n\nExcitement filled the stadium as fans got word that Bolivia had tied Panama, but that energy quickly was erased as Uruguay finally broke the scoreless drought in the 66th minute. The goal came under questionable circumstances as Uruguay appeared to be offside. After the officials reviewed the play, the goal stood.\n\nThe United States couldn't answer Uruguay's sole goal, ending its hopes of advancing to the quarterfinal.\n\nPanama 3, Bolivia 1\n\nPanama needed to better the United States' result to advance to the quarterfinal, so its fate was only partly in its own hands on Monday. But Panama did exactly what it needed to, getting the win over Bolivia.\n\nWith the motivation of advancing to the knockout round for the first time ever, Panama came out of the gates hot, scoring in the 22nd minute to take an early 1-0 lead.\n\nThat goal was just about the only excitement in the first half as Bolivia couldn't answer through the first 45, leaving it with a deficit to overcome in the second half.\n\nAnd Bolivia did just that, matching Panama's goal in the 69th minute\n\nBut the 1-1 tie stood for just a few minutes, as Panama took back the lead in the 79th minute on a goal from Eduardo Guerrero.\n\nAfter taking the lead, Panama put the game out of reach with a goal in stoppage time to make it 3-1.\n\nHaving secured the win over Bolivia, Panama just had to wait for the result of the United States vs. Uruguay, which ended with a loss for the United States and advancement for Panama.\n\nGroup B: Venezuela Routes Jamaica, Ecuador Draws Mexico to Advance\n\n10 of 19\n\nARIC BECKER/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVenezuela already qualified for the quarterfinal ahead of its match with Jamaica, but clinched a Group B victory with its win on Sunday.\n\nThe game got off to a bit of a slow start with the two teams heading into halftime scoreless, but Venezuela quickly changed that in the second half. In the 49th minute, Eduard Bello drilled a header from the right side to give Venezuela a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe goal from Bello seemingly opened up Venezuela's offense, as it found the net less than 10 minutes later, this time off the left foot of Salomón Rondón to make it a 2-0 cushion.\n\nJust for good measure, Venezuela added another goal in the 85th minute from Eric Ramírez.\n\nJamaica had been eliminated coming into the match, but was hoping to leave Copa América with at least one victory, but Venezuela posted a dominant victory to keep that from happening.\n\nMexico 0, Ecuador 0\n\nMuch like Venezuela and Jamaica, there was little action to speak of in the first half between Mexico and Ecuador.\n\nMexico's César Huerta had a golden opportunity for a header after a beautiful cross, but he couldn't place it and the ball soared over the crossbar to keep things even.\n\nMexico again had a pair of shots on goal in the second half, but Ecuador's keeper Alexander Domínguez stood strong in the net to keep the match in a draw heading into the late stages.\n\nIn extra time, Mexico got a few looks at the goal, but never found the net as the match ended in a draw.\n\nHaving drawn with Ecuador, Mexico is now eliminated from the tournament while Ecuador will move on to the quarterfinal.\n\nGroup A: Argentina Handles Peru 2-0, Canada Draws Chile\n\n11 of 19\n\nHector Vivas/Getty Images\n\nArgentina 2, Peru 0\n\nArgentina's match with Peru began somewhat slow with neither team managing to find the net through the first half.\n\nArgentina showed flashes of offense early on, controlling 79.3 percent of the possession and getting six shots with three on goal, but it couldn't break through and score through the first 45.\n\nLeandro Paredes came close to scoring in the first half, but a tremendous defensive effort from Peru meant an even score heading into halftime.\n\nPeru was also responsible for 10 fouls in the first half, hurting its chances of finding a groove on offense.\n\nArgentina quickly found the net in the second half as Lautaro Martínez scored in the 47th minute to give his team a 1-0 lead. The goal for Martínez was his third in as many games.\n\nParedes later had the chance to give Argentina some insurance with a penalty kick, but missed it off the post.\n\nBut the missed penalty kick ultimately didn't come back to hurt Argentina as it managed to find the net once more, again on a goal from Martínez in the 86th minute.\n\nWith just minutes to go, Argentina held strong on defense to win both the match and the group.\n\nCanada 0, Chile 0\n\nCanada and Chile proved to be a physical matchup through the first 45, with 13 fouls between the two teams in the opening half. That physicality led to little offense early on as Canada had two shots on goal and Chile had one.\n\nThe early physicality also proved costly for Chile as Gabriel Suazo picked up a red card after 27 minutes.\n\nThe second half didn't provide much more offense for either side. The match provided much more physicality than it did goal-scoring as there were a combined 23 fouls between the two sides—Canada with 15 of those.\n\nBut all Canada needed was a draw or better, and it now advances to the knockout round.\n\nGroup D: Colombia Shuts out Costa Rica; Brazil Defeats Paraguay\n\n12 of 19\n\nChris Coduto/Getty Images\n\nColombia 3, Costa Rica 0\n\nColombia extended their unbeaten streak to 25 straight matches with a 3-0 shutout of Costa Rica on Friday.\n\nLuis Díaz, Davinson Sánchez and Jhon Córdoba scored as Colombia secured a spot in the Copa América quarterfinals.\n\nColombia looked every bit the squad that has not lost a game since February 2022 as they largely controlled possession through 31 minutes before Díaz scored the eventual game-winner on a penalty kick.\n\nCosta Rica, which is fielding the youngest squad in the tournament, conceded the loss after shocking Brazil with a scoreless tie earlier this week.\n\nSecuring at least one point against Brazil during Tuesday's group stage finale will ensure Colombia finishes atop Group D.\n\nBrazil 4, Paraguay 1\n\nBrazil recovered from an upset draw against Costa Rica by scoring four times in the team's first group stage victory against Paraguay.\n\nVinícius Júnior scored two goals in the first half to put Brazil ahead.\n\nParaguay's Omar Alderete opened the second half with a goal to cut into Brazil's lead.\n\nBrazil's Lucas Paquetá, who missed a penalty earlier in the game, earned redemption by scoring to polish off the victory.\n\nGroup C: Panama Beats 10-man USA; Uruguay Crushes Bolivia\n\n13 of 19\n\nTodd Kirkland/Getty Images\n\nPanama 2, USA 1\n\nPulisic looked as though he may have drawn a foul in the box in the 42nd minute, but nothing was called.\n\nAt halftime, the United States switched goalies after Matt Turner suffered a leg injury.\n\nDespite being down a man, the United States had its chances, perhaps none better than Ricardo Pepi here:\n\nHowever, Panama eventually broke through in the 83rd minute, with José Fajardo delivering the great finish.\n\nThe U.S. got a big break, though, when Panama went down to 10 men in the 88th minute after Adalberto Carrasquilla's tackle on Christian Pulisic.\n\nThe U.S.' best chance after that occurred in stoppage time off a free kick, but the shot went over the crossbar.\n\nPanama possessed the ball for 73.6 percent of the time and had 13 shot attempts to the United States' six. Both are now 1-0-1 in group play.\n\nUruguay 5, Bolivia 0\n\nThe tournament's biggest blowout thus far occurred Thursday as Uruguay crushed Bolivia 5-0, all but assuring the team first place in the group standings.\n\nUruguay had 18 shot attempts (nine on goal) to Bolivia's four (one on goal).\n\nFacundo Pellistri and Darwin Núñez scored in the first half for a 2-0 edge.\n\nThe game remained 2-0 for the first 32 minutes of the second half before Maximiliano Araújo, Federico Valverde and Rodrigo Bentancur scored within a 12-minute span.\n\nNo team had beaten another by more than two goals in this tournament until Uruguay's win. The team has now outscored its opponents 8-1 after taking down Panama 3-1 to begin the tournament.\n\nGroup B: Ecuador Beats Jamaica; Venezuela Takes Down Mexico\n\n14 of 19\n\nCHRIS CODUTO/AFP via Getty Images\n\nEcuador 3, Jamaica 1\n\nEcuador's knockout round hopes remain alive after defeating Jamaica 3-1 on Wednesday in Las Vegas.\n\nEcuador got on the board in the 13th minute. Officially, it goes in the books as a Kasey Palmer own goal, but Piero Hincapié launched an incredibly powerful and accurate cross that happened to deflect off the midfielder and into the net from a near-impossible angle.\n\nEcuador looked as if it would go into the half up 1-0, but the team was given a gift after a handball in the box.\n\nKendry Páez took care of the rest.\n\nIn the second half, Michail Antonio got one back for Jamaica for its first-ever Copa América goal. A corner kick led to a point-blank blocked shot, and then Antonio put in the rebound in the 54th minute.\n\nJamaica could not get the equalizer, though. Ecuador later added one more goal in stoppage time courtesy of a fantastic run from Alan Minda.\n\nEcuador finished with 23 shot attempts to Jamaica's seven, but Jamaica had four shots on goal to Ecuador's three. Jamaica also had 18 fouls and four yellow cards on the evening.\n\nVenezuela 1, Mexico 0\n\nSalomón Rondón's 57th-minute penalty proved to be the match's lone goal, pushing Venezuela into the knockout round.\n\nJon Aramburu drew a foul on Julián Quiñones in the box to set up the goal:\n\nThen Venezuela held on.\n\nRafael Romo made a huge save in the 68th minute to keep it 1-0.\n\nAnother chance rolled on by 11 minutes later.\n\nMexico got a great chance, though, following a handball in the box.\n\nBut Romo came through once again, saving the penalty from Orbelín Pineda.\n\nRomo somehow had time for more heroics in stoppage time before sealing the win.\n\nThis was a heartbreaker for Mexico, which had 18 shot attempts and five on goal but could not come through despite amazing chances.\n\nGroup A: Canada and Argentina Earn 1-0 Victories\n\n15 of 19\n\nHector Vivas/Getty Images\n\nCanada 1, Peru 0\n\nJonathan David's 74th-minute strike gave Canada a 1-0 victory over Peru on Tuesday in Kansas City.\n\nPeru played with 10 men after centerback Miguel Araujo got a red card (following a review) for a dangerous challenge on winger Jacob Shaffelburg.\n\nShaffelburg later found David on a blistering counter attack to set up the game's lone goal.\n\nPeru fired nine shots on goal to Canada's five and had four shots on goal to its opponent's two. However, Canada emerged victorious to put itself in great position to advance to the knockout round.\n\nCanada is making its Copa América debut. Tuesday marked the country's first-ever goal and win in the tournament after Canada fell 2-0 to defending World Cup champions Argentina in the first match.\n\nArgentina 1, Chile 0\n\nArgentina will be moving onto the knockout round after beating Chile 1-0 behind Lautaro Martínez's 88th-minute goal following a corner kick on Tuesday.\n\nThe goal went to VAR review for offside but stood.\n\nThe two teams played in front of a raucous crowd from East Rutherford, New Jersey's MetLife Stadium.\n\nLionel Messi had a great chance in the first half for Argentina, but his shot rang off the post:\n\nSomehow, the score was level at zero at halftime:\n\nBoth teams had fantastic chances in the second half:\n\nBut Martínez's goal proved to be the match's only one, even though Argentina was very close to a second.\n\nArgentina finished with 22 shot attempts (including nine on goal) to Chile's three (all on goal).\n\nArgentina will be back in action on Saturday against Peru, while Chile will take on Group A's second-best team in Canada.\n\nThe quarterfinals begin on July 4.\n\nGroup D: Colombia Starts with Win; Brazil and Costa Rica Play Scoreless Draw\n\n16 of 19\n\nARIC BECKER/AFP via Getty Images\n\nColombia 2, Paraguay 1\n\nColombia is on the board with their first win of the Copa América thanks to a 2-1 victory over Paraguay that they largely controlled.\n\nJames Rodríguez was magic with the ball at his feet in the first half and assisted both of the goals. Daniel Muñoz headed in the first one, while Jefferson Lerma headed in the second one to open up some breathing room.\n\nThat breathing room was important, as Paraguay cut the deficit in half when Julio Enciso found the back of the net in the 69th minute.\n\nParaguay was unable to find the equalizer, though, as Colombia finished the game with 67.6 percent possession. They also had the best chance to score down the stretch with what looked like a penalty kick, but it was overturned upon review.\n\nThe biggest question in the final minutes was whether Paraguay could even see the goal they were moving toward since colored smoke from the crowd hovered over the playing surface.\n\nAlas, Colombia's defense stood strong and preserved the win.\n\nBrazil 0, Costa Rica 0\n\nThe first game of Monday's slate featured plenty of firepower, while the second one did not.\n\nYet Brazil was clearly the superior side statistically despite the 0-0 draw with Costa Rica.\n\nBrazil finished with 73.6 percent of the possession and 19 shot attempts to Costa Rica's two. However, only three of the 19 shots for Brazil were actually on target, so they will surely look back at the result with disappointment.\n\nHad a few more of the shots been better located, they likely would have come away with a win.\n\nBrazil is still in ideal position to advance if they can take care of business in games against Paraguay and Colombia.\n\nStill, defeating Colombia will be easier said than done given the way both teams played in their Copa América openers.\n\nGroup C: United States and Uruguay Secure Comfortable Victories\n\n17 of 19\n\nJohn Todd/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images for USSF\n\nUnited States 2, Bolivia 0\n\nChristian Pulisic's third-minute goal set the tone for a dominant 2-0 victory over Bolivia to kick off the Stars and Stripes' Copa América campaign in Arlington, Texas' AT&T Stadium.\n\nThe USMNT won a quick corner kick early to set up the match's most pivotal moment. Pulisic nudged a quick and short pass to Timothy Weah, who sent the ball back to his teammate. The captain then launched a beautiful shot at the back post for the quick 1-0 advantage.\n\nPulisic then showed respect to the USMNT's set-piece coach:\n\nHe also joined a new list following his 30th goal for the national team.\n\nThe United States kept the pressure up through the first half and finally broke through when Folarin Balogun placed a great shot from the left side of the box to the right corner of the goal following a Pulisic pass in the 44th minute.\n\nThe United States never scored again, but it wasn't for lack of trying, as the team had multiple chances to break through. Ricardo Pepi had the best chance late but got denied by a fantastic Guillermo Viscarra save.\n\nOverall, the United States had 20 shot attempts (eight on goal) to Bolivia's six shot attempts (three on goal).\n\nUruguay 3, Panama 1\n\nUruguay cruised to a 3-1 victory over Panama at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida on Sunday.\n\nMaximiliano Araújo scored a phenomenal goal in the 16th minute thanks to some help from his teammates to put Uruguay ahead.\n\nBoth teams had multiple scoring chances through the first and second half, but neither side could break through again until the 85th minute.\n\nBut with time winding down, Darwin Núñez came through.\n\nMatías Viña added one in stoppage time for Uruguay before Panama got one on the board via Michael Murillo.\n\nUruguay took 20 shot attempts (seven on goal) to Panama's seven shot attempts (two on goal).\n\nGroup B: Mexico, Venezuela Earn Wins\n\n18 of 19\n\nDoug Zimmerman/ISI Photos/Getty Images\n\nVenezuela 2, Ecuador 1\n\nTwo quick goals helped Venezuela open Group B play with a 2-1 victory over Ecuador.\n\nDespite losing captain Enner Valencia on a red card in the 22nd minute, Jeremy Sarmiento put his shorthanded team on the board first:\n\nVenezuela launched a comeback in the second half, as a save by Alexander Dominguez led to a tying goal from Jhonder Cadiz:\n\nVenezuela's Eduard Bello scored 10 minutes later to finish off the comeback.\n\nVenezuela will now continue their bid for their first World Cup qualification by taking an early Group B lead. They are currently the only South American team to never appear in the tournament.\n\nMexico 1, Jamaica 0\n\nMexico opened group stage play with a win, but lost captain Edson Álvarez to injury during Saturday night's 1-0 shutout of Jamaica.\n\nÁlvarez was subbed off with a non-contact injury in the first half.\n\nThe game remained scoreless until the 69th minute, when Mexico's Gerardo Arteaga put a cross from Érick Sánchez in the back of the net:\n\nMexico will hope to receive good news about Álvarez's injury status before Wednesday's match against Venezuela.\n\nGroup A: Argentina Defeats Canada; Peru and Chile Play to a Scoreless Draw\n\n19 of 19\n\nHector Vivas/Getty Images\n\nArgentina began their defense of the 2021 Copa América title in style, beating Canada 2-0 in the opening group match of the tournament,\n\nWhile Argentina boast arguably the greatest soccer player of all time in Lionel Messi, they didn't need him to score in order to get off to a winning start.\n\nAfter a scoreless first half, Julián Álvarez scored in the 49th minute to give La Albiceleste a 1-0 lead, and Lautaro Martínez added an insurance marker in the 88th minute to cement the 2-0 victory:\n\nWhile Messi missed on a couple of golden scoring opportunities, he made a perfect pass to Martínez on his goal, showing that he can impact the game in myriad ways.\n\nPeru 0, Chile 0\n\nA physical match between Peru and Chile ended in a scoreless draw on Friday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.\n\nThe theme and tone of this match was set early:\n\nChile had the match's best scoring opportunity in the 15th minute, when Alexis Sánchez found himself with a point-blank shot for a goal. Unfortunately, he could not finish.\n\nPeru had a nice opportunity off a set piece in the first half, but Chile goaltender Claudio Bravo was there for the save.\n\nBravo was the hero of this match, making another great save in the second half to preserve the draw.\n\nChile possessed the ball 65 percent of the time to Peru's 35 percent. Peru had six shots (three on goal). Chile had eight but only one on goal. The two teams also conceded 18 fouls apiece and combined for four yellow cards (three for Chile).\n\nX"
