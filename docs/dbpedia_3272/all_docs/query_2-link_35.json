Footage of the Paris Games is everywhere in Brazil, at home, at work, on public transportation, in hospital waiting rooms, and it seems like every single member of the Brazilian population is watching the events on their TV, computers and smartphones. And it’s that time of the year when you go into a bakery shop and you see Canoo’s\n\nLalon on and everybody’s caught to the TV and then the baker looks at you and said, well, I think Slovakia is coming with everything they have this year. And then you answer that maybe so, but that you’re rooting for Latvia, as if any one of the two had any idea what they were talking about.

So we won 2 gold with Beatriz Souza in the Judo competition and Rebeca Andrade in the floor competition in artistic gymnastics, as well as five silvers and six bronze. Some were positive surprises, some were negative surprises.\n\nAnd for this week’s episode, we’re going to break it all down with Euan Marshall, Deputy Editor of the Brazilian Report. Hi, Euan.\n\nHi, Gustavo. Great to be here.\n\nAnd we are also delighted to welcome Alexia Massoud to the show. She’s a journalism student at George Washington University and she has been doing some excellent work interning at the Brazilian Report over the past couple of months.\n\nHi Alexia.\n\nHi, thank you so much for having me. So in the first half of today’s show,\n\nwe’re going to look at some of the biggest Brazilian results so far in Paris, how the games are being received in Brazil and what we should be looking ahead to in the remaining days of the events. And then in part two, we’re going to look at what happens before and after the Olympic Games, namely how athletes are funded, how they’re making a living, and where Brazil could be\n\ndoing better. So without further ado, let’s dive in. Irwin, let’s start with you. So I mentioned a little bit about Brazil’s results in terms of medals. And this Olympics for Brazilians is kind of a roller coaster in terms of emotions because we had some unexpected medals coming our way, but we also had athletes that we thought were\n\na lock in terms of their medal potential that fell short of the podium, right?\n\nYeah, I mean, it’s definitely been this, as you say, quite up and down. In Brazil there seems to be this expectation almost from most of the general public that everything’s going to go okay and that all of the Brazilian athletes are going to win gold even though people aren’t really keeping up with these sports. Even when they’re not particularly favorites, they believe that they’re going to go in there with a chance of winning and that hasn’t always been the case and even in with a lot of these athletes who\n\nhaven’t necessarily won gold or even won medals a lot of them have put up excellent performances, season bests, personal bests, national records all that sort of stuff and you know it’s it’s been clouded a little bit i think because maybe Brazil’s medal count isn’t quite as high as it should be and will definitely will get onto that at some point but I think you know the one that everyone is talking about, everyone was\n\ntalking about before it happened and everyone has been basically talking about non-stop since was Hebeken Baradji’s gold medal that you mentioned which happened on Monday morning, quite early on Monday morning in the floor exercise final of the artistic gymnastics and this was just such a spectacular event, I think, for Brazilian fans of sport.\n\nAnd the significance, obviously, of beating Simone Biles, the United States gymnast, potentially the greatest gymnast of all time, getting more points than her, above her on the podium.\n\nAnd also, the first ever to beat Biles on the floor exercise in a major competition, right? So it’s even more of an accomplishment what Hebeke Andrade did on Monday.\n\nWell yeah, I mean I’ve got a couple more facts then just to kind of to bring us in on Hebeke Andrade just to kind of contextualize this a little bit more. I mean that is her sixth Olympic medal in her career which makes her the most kind of successful Olympian in Brazil’s history. That’s also her fourth olympic medal just at this Paris Games which means that she has the equal highest total of\n\nmedals for any athlete who is not a swimmer and that’s also her second gold medal in her history and she won the vault final in the 2020 Tokyo Games but importantly Simone Biles wasn’t competing against her in that particular event, she had pulled out of that competition.\n\nAnd yeah, it’s just, I think, as you mentioned just at the start there, that there is this kind of up and down roller coaster sort of thing with some people doing well, some people doing not so well, and I think maybe on the morning, on Monday morning, just before that\n\nfloor final, there was a bit of maybe pessimism was just starting to creep in with a lot of Brazilian fans thinking, you know, this is the last gymnastics event, it’s probably not going to be a gold again, who knows if Rebeca Andrade can manage this, Simone Biles this, Simone Biles that, all that sort of thing. And then we saw a couple of mistakes from Simone Biles and we saw Rebeca Andrade doing\n\nwhat Rebeca Andrade does, she’s the gymnast, she’s very tight in everything that she does, precise, very elegant and she managed to score high and she managed to win that gold.\n\nAnd can you tell us a little bit more about Hebeke Andrade, who is she? I mean the fact that the biggest Brazilian Olympian ever is a black woman is something that did not go unnoticed in Brazil. Can you tell us a little bit more about her upbringing and how she became this icon of Brazilian sports?\n\nYeah, I mean, I think maybe a year ago you would have a lot more people who were unaware of who Rebeca Andrade was, but she’s no one known. I mean, even, you know, even in the US, the sports press have been bigging her up before this Olympics as being, you know, she’s the only one who can compete with Simone Biles and also making a lot of, drawing a lot of comparisons between the two of them in terms of their background and their upbringing\n\nand I think it’s fascinating because when you have, Rebeca Andrade has one of those stories where she grew up in a very poor neighborhood in Guarulhos just beside the city of Sao Paulo she has seven siblings and she was brought up by a single mother and you know all those stories of, oh yeah, it took her two\n\nhours to get to training, her big sister had to walk her to training took two hours there, two hours back her mother was working as a maid cleaning houses of rich families to pay for Rebecca’s training and what’s kind of spectacular about this is that I mean that’s a story that is just repeated almost constantly when we’re\n\ntalking about Brazilian sportsmen and women that in itself is that is almost the norm when it comes to Brazilian sports and it’s just this constant kind of overcoming obstacles and overcoming adversity which you can really, you know, just in that basic part of her life story of Hebeke Andrade is already really quite apparent.\n\nBut then there’s other things which are potentially even more amazing is that Hebeke Andrade has three times, three times in the space of just a few years, I think it was six years, she had three anterior cruciate ligament surgeries, reconstruction surgeries on her right knee, which one ACL injury like that can be enough to end careers of many sports people. And she had three surgeries, three ACL surgeries, and she’s still at the top of her game, she’s\n\nan Olympic champion. And you know, there’s just, you know, she’s famous in Brazil as well for when she needs to read her scores, she has to put her glasses on because like me she’s slightly visually impaired. So there’s just been so many moments in her life where the odds were just saying, yeah, you’re probably not going to make it as far as you’re going to make it. And she has overcome those odds constantly to become one of the best gymnasts in the\n\nworld and certainly the best in Brazil’s history. And as you mentioned there, I mean\n\nno, anyway, if I can add just something, not just Hebeka, because Brazil’s gymnastics as a team, it won a medal for the first time, it won bronze on the all-around competition and there is something that if it were an Olympic sport, Brazil would certainly win gold, which is the production of memes\n\nand there were a lot of memes talking about the fact that for instance soccer players especially Neymar, if you touch them they start rolling on the ground and then the Brazilian gymnasts, they fell, they opened their eyebrows, they were bleeding, their face was bleeding and then they went there, they performed and they won the bronze medal.\n\nYeah and this is certainly, it’s a lot of these kind of qualities that has really endeared a lot of these athletes to the Brazilian public and especially this women’s gymnastics team. And I mean, you know, Rebeca Andrade, as everyone in Brazil will know at the moment, she’s just absolutely like the darling of Brazil, you know, it’s her country and we’re all living in it, you know, we’re surrounded by memes and little videos of Rebeca Andrade giving\n\ninterviews, you know, famous ones of her being asked, like, what does she think about before she does her routine in the Olympic finals? And she says that she’s thinking about all the recipes that she’s seen on TikTok that she wants to make when she goes back to Brazil. Apparently the night before the floor exercise final, she fell asleep watching Grey’s Anatomy, imagining that she’s a surgeon. I mean, it’s just, as I say, it’s her country at the moment and we’re living in it.\n\nthe significance of the amount of not only black athletes but also black female athletes in Brazil is quite astounding. I mean, Rebeca Andrade won Brazil’s second gold medal at this Olympic Games and the first gold medal\n\nwas won by Beatriz Souza in the judo, another black woman and it’s amazing that you know obviously black women around the world are still a very marginalized population but in Brazil that marginalization of black women is just so much more apparent and for them still to, for that still to be the demographic that is leading you know the the Olympic delegation there’s more women than men for example this year and\n\nthe in the Paris Olympics Brazil team and for them to be winning the medals and kind of bringing home the bacon as it were it’s just yeah hugely symbolic.\n\nNow, you even talked a little bit about the heist of Brazil’s first days in Paris. I’m going to bring Alexia in to talk a little bit about the lows because, especially in the first week of the Olympic Games, Brazil was handed some brutal losses and by coincidence,\n\na bunch of them were handed by Japan, right? So, Alexia, can you tell us a little bit about how Brazilians reacted to that? Some saying that it was Japan’s revenge for us putting cream cheese on sushi.\n\nYeah, so a lot of memes have come and been generated online. There are a lot of memes about the Brazil and Japan rivalry, which isn’t exactly a rivalry, but people are really upset about Brazil losing to Japan time and time again. In the women’s rugby, we lost to Japan twice.\n\nAnd one of the comebacks was Gabriel Medina in that legendary picture, that epic picture of him holding his hand up, floating in the air with his surfboard, photographed by a French photographer. And he won a 9.9. He scored 9.9 on his wave, which was a legendary comeback to beat the Japanese surfer who beat him in\n\nTokyo 2020. So Brazilians went crazy over that and the memes online have just been phenomenal. Some implying that if Capoeira was an event in the Olympics, Japanese would find a way to beat Brazilians. If funk was an event in the Olympic Games, Japan would beat them again. So a lot of memes are going crazy online and it’s been fun to watch.\n\nNow, even Alexia mentioned Gabriel Medina, and he surfed a perfect wave, he was shot in a perfect picture, but that wasn’t enough for him, right? Because he then lost in the semifinals and had to settle for the bronze medal.\n\nAnd I want to bring Medina in because there was some controversy in the surfing competition with a Brazilian surfer who is not in the Olympic Games raising some flags that a judge was cozying up to the Australian surfer that ended up beating Medina in the semifinals. And that also ties with some of the conspiracy theories in Brazil that we have that every time we lose a competition is not because the other team had its merits but because we were robbed by the refs\n\nI mean yeah it’s certainly a lot easier I think to just say that it’s the judges fault or the referees fault and it ties into something that we’ve been talking about already in this show about just you know the expectations for Brazilian athletes are they’re often just quite unrealistic. We see a lot of the coverage that we get on the televised broadcast of the Olympics in\n\nBrazil and as I mentioned earlier, they’re talking up these athletes as in, you know, this is a medal chance, this is a chance of gold, you know, this is, this athlete is going to come away with something here and then even if the athlete gives their personal best as has been the case in some of these events and still maybe finishes fourth or fifth or even lower, even at the bottom of the pile but still is producing a Brazilian record. The comedown has been really quick.\n\nAfter the realization that there’s not a medal coming, there’s not a gold coming, there has always been this kind of quick mea culpa from the broadcasters of being like oh you know i’m sorry we got your hopes up there maybe it wasn’t realistic after all and that does i think that just puts a lot more pressure on these athletes\n\nuh…\n\ni never remember one time i was i never remember one time i was watching uh… a swim uh… swimming uh… qualification and the commentator was like oh the persian swimmer just started amazingly and then the pro swimmer that was bringing some insight was like,\n\nno he didn’t, he started off pretty terribly. So at least some of the broadcasts had these pros to temper down expectations, but even so, like you said, we’re always led to believe that the gold medal is within reach, right?\n\nYeah, exactly, exactly.\n\nAnd Alexia, I mean, we are seeing like everywhere you go, you have a TV on with the Olympics. How important is the Olympics to Brazil, especially if you compare, for instance, to the United States, where you live, you’re a Brazilian, you’re studying in the US, back to Brazil for your internship. So how can you compare the Olympic spirit in both countries, the US being an Olympic juggernaut, and Brazil not quite?\n\nSo, in my opinion, the United States has a lot of infrastructure for athletes. They have a lot of support for athletes. Professional teams are more prominent, and they receive a lot of funding. Especially track and field is one of the sports in the US\n\nthat is highly, highly funded, and there are so many athletes. So the US has a really large delegation in the Olympics. They have the largest delegation, and they’re often able to send all these athletes because of their infrastructure.\n\nSo I think Brazil being highlighted in the Olympics as they have been, so for example, Rebeca Andrade shining light to Brazil and to herself has been a huge way for Brazil to come back to the center stage. So I believe that all the funding and, well, a study came out recently from Ponta Map, which is a data intelligence agency in Brazil, and they have released that the Brazilian government has put in about 43.9 billion reais into sports in the past\n\n20 years and medals have proportionally increased with that funding, so I believe that…\n\nIt’s amazing that it’s not even 1 billion dollars, right? Even if it’s the most that Brazil has ever spent, it dwarfs in comparison to the hundreds of millions and billions that we see in university sports programs across the US. So it’s still a very tiny investment compared to other countries.\n\nI totally agree. You’re completely right. And well, to Brazil, that seems like a large investment or at least larger than it used to be because in the past three years, 2021 to 2023, we’ve invested about 7.3 billion reais,\n\nwhich 20 years ago wasn’t even close. So now the Brazilian government is starting to invest a lot more money into sports, and I think that’s the right way to get closer to some countries like the US, where they stand with sports, for example, because I see tracks everywhere in the US. They’re really common, but here in Brazil I don’t see tracks for people to be able to practice, for the youth to be able to practice sports and get into athletics\n\nthe way that they’re able to do so in the US.\n\nAnd you would notice, right, because you’re a runner yourself.\n\nYeah, I would, for sure.\n\nWhich competitions do you run?\n\nI typically do the 400 meter dash or the 800 meter dash, but in between those two are my favorite distances.\n\nAlexis’ modesty doesn’t let her say that, but she was once a record breaker in her own college, right, Alexis?\n\nYeah, yeah, I held that record for a little bit.\n\nSo, uh.\n\nAnd do you want to pick hope for Brazil,\n\ncome to Los Angeles?\n\nWell, I would totally choose to represent Brazil, just like Thatchian and Weston Webb, who moved to Hawaii when she was little, but chose to come back to represent Brazil and now won silver. I would totally do that.\n\nAnd Alexia, you were talking about the investment that the Brazilian government has put into its sports program. I mean, a lot of that was driven by Rio 2016 when Brazil hosted the Olympic and wanted to have its best results ever. It had at the time, then it was even better in the London games with 21 total medals.\n\nDid we see a return to normalcy after the real Olympic cycle or investments continue to go up even after the Olympics in Brazil?\n\nSo we released an article about that on the website a couple of weeks ago and we saw that a study was published by Fundação Júlio Vargas talking about the legacy left by Rio 2016 and there are still things that are incoming, some infrastructure things that were supposed to have finished by the end of the Olympics but they’re still ongoing and the legacy left was enormous. We made almost 100 billion reais in revenue, which was equal to almost $20 billion at that time.\n\nAnd then also a bunch of jobs generated, almost 470,000 jobs. So the Rio Olympics left a huge legacy for Brazil and we’re still coming off of that legacy.\n\nAnd even going specifically to the grants that we give to athletes, the so-called Bolsa Atleta, can you tell us a little bit more to our foreign audience how it works, because we have different tiers, we have, I mean, the amount you get from the government goes up or down depending on your performance on top-notch competitions, right?\n\nYeah, I mean this is the kind of basic funding mechanism that the Brazilian government will give to sportsmen and women, as you say, called the Bolsa Atleta, which is like the athletic scholarship, sort of like loosely translated as that. And yeah, I think Alexa probably has the more detailed figures on this, but yeah, you do sliding scale of different kind of uh… different umbrellas that you would have for these for these athletes the\n\nones that are closer to potentially you know olympic competition or potentially winning medals in olympic competition will be receiving you know the highest tier of uh… of subsidies per month and whereas those who are maybe just starting out maybe different sports at a lower level uh… the stipend is going to be a lot lower.\n\nAs I say, I think Alexia has a bit more in terms of the actual figures there, but I think the interesting thing is how that’s often not enough. It’s not enough by itself for a lot of athletes because unless you’re the creme de la creme, you’re really going to need a second job or you’re going to need some other sort of funding, whether that be from your own family or whether that be through sponsorships, or whether it be through clubs,\n\nor, you know, and again, in another example, another phenomenon which is interesting in Brazilian Olympic sports is some of that sometimes that funding comes from the armed forces as well, which is something interesting to get into.\n\nBut as I say, in terms of the actual figures there, I think Alexa will have us covered on that.\n\nRight, Alexa, can you tell us a little bit, because you’ve written another article on the funding per Olympic cycle, and you said that the medal count is proportional to the amount spent. Are we spending more, have we spent more for Paris than we did in previous cycles, or after Rio things went down a little bit.\n\nSo the figures for the Olympics haven’t come out yet, but I do think that we’ve been increasingly spending more, as I said before, in the past three years. The total came out to 7.3 billion, I believe. So that has been a large increase over the past few years, and the medals have grown since as well. The study said that at the recent Olympics we’ve gotten\n\n19 medals in Tokyo and this year hopefully we come out with more, at least equal to. But yeah, funding has been increasing and as Euan said before, the BOSATFLETA, which is the athlete scholarship that comes to athletes, is unfortunately not enough for them to be able to support themselves. So they have to find a second job and in addition to their exhausting training, they have to be doing extra things to make that money for themselves. So as for the figures for that, the Bolsa Atleta goes from 410 reais to 16,600 reais,\n\nwhich is in an article written by our reporters of LACRUS, which is 100% worth checking out because it has a lot of figures. So, yeah, that podium tier in the Bolsa Atleta is a minimum of 5,500 and a maximum of 16,600. So the more decorated athletes and the ones that have a larger chance or a higher chance of winning medals are able to get that higher end of the Bolsa Atleta. But still, when you translate it to dollars, it’s really not enough to keep the athletes going.\n\nSo it’s important that they’re able to receive other types of compensation, such as the medals. When they win the medals, the Olympic Committee from Brazil will give them money for those. So for the gold medal, I think the athletes are going to be getting 350,000 reais. And for the silver, 210,000 reais. And for bronze, 140,000. So that will definitely be able to help them out a little bit more, especially because\n\nyou know the funding doesn’t equate the work that they’re doing.\n\nAnd when we’re talking about meadow counts, the projections that the Brazilian Olympic Committee had will probably not be met. In Tokyo, Brazil won 21 total medals. We’re probably not going to get to that point. Both to you, Euan and Alexia, what are main medal chances?\n\nBecause Brazil had some brutal disappointments in this past few days. For instance, the men’s volleyball team was eliminated by the US in what was its worst outing since 1972, that had been consistently a hope for a medal in recent games, two golds and two silvers since Athens, I believe.\n\nFrom where should we expect our medals to come, the remaining ones that we may dream of?\n\nI think one of the events that people have been talking quite a lot about even before the Olympics and now during the Olympics, seeing the team in action has been the women’s volleyball team. They’re on really good form at the moment, they’re looking quite comfortable in all their kind of preliminary games and the looking quite comfortable in all their preliminary games and going into the knockout stage with a decent chance of a medal there and again we keep talking about these women’s teams here I mean in the group stage they were quite underwhelming but the women’s football team will be fighting for a medal at some point, they’ve qualified for the semi-final be fighting for at least bronze and they will be playing two more matches and that after what looked like a really underwhelming first three games in the group stage has turned into a proper, a genuine medal opportunity and so I think there are going to be a good few more medals to come.\n\nthat because, like you said, the first three games were bad to awful. And then Brazil, without Marta, its leading star, won against France for the first time. The French team is pretty damn good. And also, Brazilians, that conspiracy theory that people were trying to rob us was really really on during that game because we had almost 20 minutes of stoppage time, almost a quarter of the game in additional time in the second half and we still held on to a\n\n1-0 lead. We’re not going to have Marta against Spain, so do you think we have a shot at going to the final? I mean, it’s going to be very difficult.\n\nBrazil played Spain’s reserve side in their final group match and they lost that one. That’s where Marta got sent off for what could end up being her final participation with the Brazilian national team. We don’t know whether she will make it back for a potential final or a bronze medal match,\n\nwhether she will be selected.\n\nAnd now, playing against Spain’s first team, you would imagine, everything that Spain has to offer, I think it’s going to be a very difficult prospect for Brazil to go through, but as you said, they managed to beat France in the quarter-final, which is obviously very difficult against a home nation, and it was a very backs-against-the-wall performance, and having to go through that extensive stoppage time which has been a feature of this Olympic Games so far.\n\nIf anyone watched the opening game of the men’s tournament what went on between Morocco and Argentina was basically a lot of it was down to the incredible amounts of stoppage time added on in the second half but Brazil is in with a shout always. I definitely don’t think they’re favourites to make the final but if they don’t make the final they’re going to be fighting for bronze.\n\nSo, you know, that’s somewhere where I don’t think anyone who is keeping up with women’s football expected Brazil to have a medal chance and they’re going to be fighting directly for a medal, whether that be gold, silver or in the third place playoff for bronze. Just hours after we recorded this episode, Brazil did in fact knock out the reigning world champion Spain\n\nin the semi-final of the women’s football tournament 4-2, an amazing game of football that everyone who watched will obviously never forget. And now Brazil is going to go on to the gold medal match against the US. So major chances for medals there. At least, at the very least, it’s going to be a silver for Brazil in the Women’s\n\nFootball.\n\ngoing to play for a shot at the final in the women’s volleyball team. So if Brazil loses, considering that the men’s side was already eliminated by the US, are we going to replace Japan with the US as our main Olympic foe in 2024? Yeah.\n\nOh, also, thanks for correcting me before on the medals. Yes, Tokyo was 21 medals and the year before that was 19. But yeah, so what you said, it’s going to be a tough game, you know, Brazil and the US. Yesterday, Tatchina, Weston Webb lost to the American and got silver in the surf. So maybe the US is creeping up and going to replace Japan. But we had a pretty tight game today with the Dominican Republic in women’s volleyball and Brazil came out 3-0 so maybe that’s promising and you know the Brazilians in the always rooting you know the Brazilian people always rooting in the bench are always just super loud and always there for their players so I think\n\nthat we can come out on top of that. It’s unfortunate that that the men lost to the US, but we can just keep our head up and hope for the best. If anything, they’ll be competing for bronze.\n\nYeah, I mean, we have as Brazilians, we have to sell our teams as the favorites, even when they’re not. Well, with that, I think I’m going to wrap up this episode. Iwan, thank you very much. Alexia, thank you very much.\n\nThanks, Gustavo.\n\nThanks for having me guys.
