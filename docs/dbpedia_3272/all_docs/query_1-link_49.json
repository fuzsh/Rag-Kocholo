        "text": "CC Sabathia, just 20 years old when he made his Major League debut in 2001, thought he would spend his entire career with the Cleveland Indians. Maybe if he hadn’t been such a dominant pitcher, that naive belief would have been realized.\n\nSabathia was at Progressive Field on Aug. 2, one day before he was to be inducted into the Indians/Guardians Hall of Fame in a special ceremony before the Guardians and Orioles play the third of a four-game series on Aug. 3. Sabathia played for three teams during a 19-year career — 7.5 seasons with the Indians, a half season with the Milwaukee Brewers and 11 years with the Yankees.\n\n“It’s surreal, humbling,” Sabathia said. “It’s an honor to be able to be going to the Hall of Fame here, a place where I got drafted. I thought I’d spent my whole career here.\n\n“It didn’t work out like that, but to be able to go into the Hall of Fame, here especially, it means a lot to me.”\n\nSabathia, selected by the Indians with the 20th overall pick in the 1998 draft out of Vallejo High School in Vallejo, Calif., was 17-5 as a 20-year-old rookie. He finished second in the 2001 Rookie of the Year voting to Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. Suzuki played nine seasons in Japan before he batted .350, collected 242 hits, scored 127 runs and stole 56 bases in his debut season in the Majors.\n\n“Ichiro was not a rookie,” Sabathia said Aug. 2 when asked if he was robbed in the Rookie of the Year voting.\n\nAs well as he pitched his rookie year, CC said he often worried about his job security.\n\n“I wasn’t ready to be called up to the big leagues, but if you asked me back then, I should have been called up the year before,” Sabathia said. “So I just remember every single start in my rookie year, after the game, I thought they were sending me down no matter whether I pitched good or bad.\n\n“I was always checking to see if guys were coming off the injured list, all these different things. I was just so concerned with going to Triple-A that by the time I looked up I was 17 and five and it was September, but everything the whole year, 2001, all I was worried about was just trying to stay in the big leagues.”\n\nSabathia was 106-71 with the Indians. He was 19-7 in 2007 and won the American League Cy Young Award. He was going to be a free agent after 2008, so in mid-season, with a record of 6-8, knowing they could not afford to re-sign him, the Indians traded CC to Milwaukee. He went 11-2 with the Brewers and then signed with the Yankees in 2009.\n\n“It was hard (being traded),” Sabathia said. “I mean, I never cried that hard before in my life. And then I got to Milwaukee and I understood it’s still baseball.”\n\nSabathia and his wife, Amber, were married in Cleveland. They had three of their four children here. Those are among his fondest memories. Of his time in an Indians’ uniform, 2007 represents a high and a low.\n\n“I think just the 2007 season, just how well we played,” Sabathia said. “I think all of us being developed together and it kind of coming to a head at one time and just watching the way we played, me winning into Cy Young, us winning the division (96-66).\n\n“I really think we were the best team in baseball. I think if myself and a couple other guys perform better in the ALCS, we have a chance to win the World Series, so just that 2007 season is probably my favorite memory of being here in Cleveland.”\n\nThe Indians lost the 2007 ALCS to the Boston Red Sox, who went on to sweep the Colorado Rockies in the World Series.\n\nThe 2024 version of Cleveland’s baseball team has goals of playing deep into October. It is appropriate Sabathia is becoming a Hall of Famer this weekend. The Guardians at 67-42 have the best record in baseball. Some of the fans that will be at Progressive Field for his induction will be able to tell their children they saw Sabathia pitch masterfully for the Tribe 20 years ago.\n\n“This fanbase is incredible,” Sabathia said. “One, I would have to say sorry, too. I feel like if I pitched better in 2007 (playoffs), we’d have won a World Series and we’re still not looking for that drought to end, so I had to do a lot of growing up and different things, so I would say sorry, but I would also say thank you.”\n\nSabathia won his only start against the Yankees in the 2007 ALDS despite giving up three runs in five innings. He lost games 5 and 7 in the two games he pitched against the Red Sox in the ALCS.\n\nI didn’t know that\n\n… until I read my Snapple bottle cap.\n\nHoney bees navigate by using the sun as a compass. … The first human-made object to crack the sound barrier was a whip. … Giraffes and humans both have seven vertebrae. … The Statue of Liberty wears a size 870 sandal. … A woodpecker can hammer a tree up to 16 times per second. … Human eyes have more than two million working parts."
