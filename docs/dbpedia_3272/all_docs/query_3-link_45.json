        "text": "Introduction\n\nModern soccer is characterized by increasingly high dynamics and the number of direct one-on-one plays, players’ excellent motor and mental preparation as well as technical-tactical skills (Bangsbo and Krustrup, 2008). In top-level soccer tournaments, a team reaching the final plays seven matches in a month. Maintaining top performance throughout a tournament requires from players a high level of aerobic endurance, speed and strength (Hoff and Helgerud, 2004). From the physiological standpoint, appropriate training load control, hydration, supplementation and regeneration of the player’s body are also of great significance (Fowler et al., 2014; Kurdak et al., 2010). Reaching high sport performance in a relatively short time between the end of a competitive season and the start of the World Cup is very difficult for soccer players, who might be tired, overloaded and lack proper recovery after intensive league seasons (Reilly et al., 2008).\n\nThe acyclical character of movements, frequently changing situations and playing pace in soccer require players to generate energy from different sources via the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (Oh et al., 2011; Reilly, 2003). During a soccer game short exercises performed by players at maximal and high intensity (sprinting, striding) dominated by anaerobic energy processes are intertwined with activities of moderate and low intensity (walking, jogging) characterized by aerobic energy processes. However, match playing time, exercise intensity and the percentage of time devoted to the performance of particular activities clearly indicate that soccer match performance is dominated by the aerobic metabolism as indicated by Bangsbo (1994) and Andrzejewski et al. (2013). Low-intensity exercise and rest periods during a match, lasting from a few to more than ten seconds, are necessary for muscle relaxation, body recovery and lactate utilization (Spencer et al., 2005). A high level of players’ aerobic fitness (VO2max) enhances all these reactions and physiological-biochemical processes (Gharbi et al., 2015).\n\nIn soccer, a good measurement of players’ exercise performance is the total distance covered in match play (collectively by a team and by individual players), consisting of distances covered when walking, jogging and running at low, moderate and high intensity in different directions. The analysis of distance covered by the teams taking part in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa showed that top national teams covered in total about 110 km in a single game (Oh et al., 2011), while individual world class players ran from 9.6 to 12-13.5 km per match (Bangsbo et al., 2009; Di Salvo et al., 2007; Djaoui et al., 2014). The covered distance may be also related to the player’s position on the pitch. The longest mean distance in a match is shown to be covered by midfielders (9.83-12.29 km), followed by defenders (9.57-11.41 km) and forwards (9.61-11.38 km) (Di Salvo et al., 2007; Djaoui et al., 2014; Mohr et al., 2003; Oh et al., 2011). Bishop and Girard (2013) noted that players’ activity during a match increased in the last decade, which can be illustrated by the length of distance covered at high intensity. Currently, this may even amount to 25-27% of the total distance covered, depending on the accepted speed threshold (Chmura et al., 2014; Konefał et al., 2014).\n\nThe number, length and frequency of performed sprints as well as development of peak running speed are among the key manifestations of players’ speed abilities. They are based on two strictly and functionally related pillars: motor and cognitive. A player’s speed and effectiveness are determined by their motor skills (moving on the pitch with and without the ball) controlled by neurophysiological processes and cognitive skills (e.g. speed and accuracy of perception, anticipation, decision making and reaction) initiated and controlled by mental processes (Oh et al., 2011). Soccer players from top-level national leagues can cover sprinting distances from 152 to 446 m, depending on their position on the field (Bradley et al., 2009; Di Salvo et al., 2007), while players from the UEFA European League teams, from 167 to 345 m (Andrzejewski et al., 2013). In the English and Spanish top soccer leagues the highest number of sprints per game is performed by forwards (from 12 to 16) and the lowest by defenders (from 8 to 9) (Dellal et al., 2010). It must be stressed that authors of longtime kinematic studies have used different methods and speed thresholds in defining sprints in soccer, i.e. from 6.4 to 8.3 m/s (Andrzejewski et al., 2013; Bangsbo, 1994; Mohr et al., 2003). Dellal et al. (2011) claim that the explosive start of the run, the ability to increase speed over the covered distance and reaching peak speed are among the key components affecting players’ effectiveness during a soccer match. During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, the world champions, i.e. the Spanish national team, reached a peak running speed of 25.52 km/h (Oh et al., 2011).\n\nIt is very difficult for soccer players to maintain their motor skills at a relatively high level for the whole duration of an international soccer tournament. Considering the available literature, soccer researchers have not studied matches of both the group and the knockout stages of a World Cup at the same time yet. From a cognitive point of view, it would be also interesting to investigate whether players from the World Cup winning team differ in terms of their levels of motor abilities from players from other participating teams. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze total distance covered, the percentage of total distance covered at high intensity, total number of performed sprints and peak running speed attained by soccer players in seven consecutive rounds of matches of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Furthermore, the study also compared the performance of the German national team, the World Champion, with other teams.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe study showed that the total distance covered by players per match decreased significantly between the third round of the group stage and the Round of 16. Also the total distance covered, the percentage of distance covered at high intensity and total number of sprints increased significantly between the quarter-finals and the semi-finals. The world champions, i.e. the German national team, covered a significantly longer distance and attained a higher percentage of total distance covered at high intensity than the remaining players.\n\nAccording to Andrzejewski et al. (2014) soccer players can maintain the length of the covered distance at the same level for three consecutive matches in a seven-day macrocycle. A significant reduction in the total distance covered by players between the last match of the group stage and the Round of 16 (0.36 km), may be due to increased fatigue. The high frequency of World Cup matches together with players’ loading after their league seasons do not permit complete recovery (Fowler et al., 2014). The players’ fitness may also be affected by environmental conditions (Hue, 2011; Mohr et al., 2010). High air temperature (e.g. 33°C in Natal, 31°C in Cuiaba) and humidity (e.g. 92% in Fortaleza, 88% in Manaus) contribute to disturbances in players’ water and electrolyte balance and to higher energy expenditure (Edwards and Noakes, 2009; Fowler et al., 2014; Kurdak et al., 2010).\n\nIt is interesting that despite incremental fatigue observed in players in consecutive rounds of the World Cup tournament, a significant increase in total distance covered was noted between the quarter-finals and the semi-finals. It may be explained by the fact that this tournament stage is reached by players who are physically best prepared, resistant to fatigue and equipped with top-level soccer-specific skills. Studies have shown that the distance covered by players in a match is highly correlated with VO2max expressed in ml/kg/min (Hoff and Helgerud, 2004; Metaxas et al., 2006). From the physiological and practical points of view, a greater aerobic capacity allows players not only to cover a longer total distance during a game, perform more sprints, but also to develop better playing dynamics and maintain it for a much longer time during the game (Bangsbo and Krustrup, 2009; Gharbi et al., 2015; Metaxas et al., 2006). This is clearly confirmed by the results of the present studies regarding the distance covered at high intensity and total number of sprints. Improving a players’ fitness level while preparing for top ranked sport tournaments in team sport games significantly increases resistance to fatigue and induces greater match load tolerance. Increased aerobic capacity also improves recovery during rest periods in match play and in parts of low intensity activities (Bangsbo, 1994; Mohr et al., 2010). High aerobic capacity also affects the attainment of the psychomotor fatigue threshold during match performance of high intensity (Chmura et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2011).\n\nThe match strategy for a tournament lasting a few weeks is to ensure a satisfactory level of players’ fitness allowing their team to advance to the knockout stage, and to maintain the highest fitness level for the final rounds of the tournament. This is confirmed in the present study by the measurements of peak running speed between the first and the second rounds of the group stage, and by the highest peak running speed recorded during the third place match and the final. The very high and relatively stable value of peak running speed in the consecutive rounds of the 2014 World Cup was, on average, 2.5 km/h higher than during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa (Oh et al., 2011). Maintaining a high level of peak running speed in the knockout stage is most likely caused by the high rank of the tournament. Playing matches against better opponents and the risk of dropping out of the tournament generate strong motivation in players (Payne et al., 2013). It must be noted that even the slightest decrease in peak running speed, compared to the opponent, may lead to a ball loss and, in consequence, to losing a goal and a match (Yue et al., 2014).\n\nThere has been steady progress in players’ conditioning. During a high-level soccer match, a player performs a sprint every four minutes on the average (Reilly et al., 2008). The higher frequency of sprints (every 2 min and 53 s on the average, and individual player’s record for every 82 s) in the present study points to increasing game dynamics in modern soccer. Considering the best individual players’ results in the present study, a question can be posed whether it is possible for a player to cover a total distance of 13.25 km, including 17% at high intensity (above 19.9 km/h), perform 68 sprints (one sprint every 82 s), and reach peak running speed of 33.52 km/h? Efficient VO2max, anaerobic threshold intensity, exercise economy and ability to repeat anaerobic exercises may contribute to achieving this objective (Chmura et al., 2015). It may be possible with an appropriate players’ genotype, training loads control and strict cooperation between coaches and scientists.\n\nThe World Champions, the German national team, indeed featured a significantly longer total distance covered and distance covered at high intensity in match play than other teams of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The high levels of these variables had a great effect on the German team’s top standing during the last Word Cup. Moreover, the total distance covered by the German team in their seven 2010 World Cup matches collectively was 758.81 km, while in 2014 it was 768.39 km, i.e. 9.58 km longer (unpublished data). The analysis of motor activities of the German soccer players allows to establish a set of standards of motor skills to be pursued by other soccer teams (Chmura et al., 2014) and to improve the development of soccer worldwide.\n\nPractical implications\n\nUpdated kinematic information on soccer players taking part in World Cup matches is highly significant for sport practice. The collected data may have significant implications for conditioning of elite soccer players. After a long and exhaustive competitive season, preparing for top-level tournaments must account for repetitive high-intensity exercises. Performance of sprints every 82 seconds on average, as well as application of training means aimed at developing peak running speed are particularly recommended. A high level of aerobic capacity seems necessary to implement such training loads."
