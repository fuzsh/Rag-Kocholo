        "text": "This is a difficult question as we first have to define the terms we are using. What do you mean by better? Better at what exactly? Better as in who was more talented? Or better as in who had the better career? So it is pretty hard to say because it is so open.\n\nThis is a question that has been in the mouths of people for such a long time and today I am going to answer it. It is amazing how we have been blessed with generational talents whilst having the same name. To really go analyse this question there are a few things that we need to consider. Firstly, we obviously need to look at how talented they were as players. Then I will assess them on their attributes to see. Afterwards, I will look at their career and the trophies they achieve. Finally, I will see who had the better longevity.\n\nI think it is clear that R9 was more talented than CR7, that man had everything as a striker. He could dribble, shoot, pass, score a header and had immense pace. On top of that, he had outstanding skills. Cristiano Ronaldo certainly had a plethora of skills in his locker, especially in his early years but I feel Ronaldo de Lima used them more effectively. The people that think believe Cristiano Ronaldo was better cannot deny that R9 was a better youngster. I think he is the best or at least one of the best youngsters in football history. It is hard to compare them since the latter Ronaldo started off in a less advanced position but it is clear that R9 had a better end product and was just simply better as a youngster than CR7. “El Fenomeno” had the world at his feet as his nickname suggests and it also highlights just how much he burst onto the scene.\n\nIn terms of attributes, I think it is a lot closer in this category. For strength, I will have to give Cristiano the point, as well as his stamina. Finishing I will have to give to R9 because that man was lethal in the box. Dribbling also is another trait I would have to give to the original Ronaldo as he was just so good with his feet and could dribble at such high speeds. Skills is a very difficult one to say as the young CR7 most certainly brought them out more often and R9 could do things virtually unheard of with a ball, so I would have to say they are the same even though I might want to steer towards Cristiano. Freekick’s I will give to CR7 as he has scored many beauties over this career with that famous “knuckleball” technique. Speed is difficult so that one could go either way I am not going to complain if someone thinks one is faster than the other. When it comes to stamina I will give that to CR7 especially towards later in his career as R9 loses it significantly. CR7 is far less injury prone than the original Ronaldo. Composure is a common trait among the best professional footballers and it is clear that both of them possessed this trait so I am unsure about this because Ronaldo de Lima went around the goalkeeper 88 times in his career which is just insane. But Ronaldo has shown to be composed in the most crucial moments so I will leave that up to you. Shooting I will give to CR7 because of the sheer amount of goals he has to his name. Passing wise I would say that R9 holds the distinction as I feel that he had a more playmaker feel to his game.\n\nCareer-wise it is hard to dispute that Cristiano Ronaldo had a better career. Firstly, the difference in trophies is clear. R9 managed to win two Ballon d’Or while CR7 has won the award five times. In total R9 won 17 trophies whilst the Portuguese Ronaldo won 32. R9 has failed to win the Champions League whereas CR7 has won the competition 5 times and is the top goalscorer and top assister in tournament history. The international careers of both have been great and it is hard to say which one is better. Cristiano Ronaldo is the highest international goalscorer in football history and has won the Euros and the Nations League. However, the Brazilian Ronaldo has two World Cups to his name, two Copa America and a Confederation’s Cup. So I think that CR7 has had a more consistent international career which went on far longer than R9 but I would envy R9’s international CV more. Who knows maybe Ronaldo can lift the World Cup in Qatar to put that side of the debate to bed.\n\nStatistics are not everything but they give us some indication of how successful someone is at it is clear that CR7 has the better stats. He is the top goalscorer in football history and has played double the number of games R9 has and has scored more than double the goals. Moreover, it is very clear that the second Ronaldo has longevity on his side. At age 37 he is at Manchester United, maybe for not much longer but R9 at age 34 retired in Brazil. The original Ronaldo suffered an injury problem and later put on a substantial amount of weight which hampered his career in the game.\n\nIn conclusion, you can definitely argue that R9 was the more talented footballer and the better youngster. You argue to some degree that you would prefer his international career. However, what you cannot argue is that Cristiano Ronaldo has had far more success in the game. He has been far more consistent than the Brazilian Ronaldo and has taken the game to new heights. Don’t get me wrong R9 was an outstanding player and if I was a defender I’d rather defend against Cristiano Ronaldo. I don’t know why but something about R9 suggests he would be an absolute nightmare. So to end things I believe that Cristiano Ronaldo ended up becoming better than Ronaldo Nazario."
