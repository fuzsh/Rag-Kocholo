        "text": "JD Vance is speaking in Shelby Township, Michigan today. At a police station.\n\nAnd honestly, that's not a surprise. For those that don't know, Shelby is based in Macomb, aka the home of Reagan Democrats who have slowly been turning GOP for years. And let's just say Shelby police have a rather sordid history with racism.\n\nAnyway, not a surprise, but that he's campaigning in a place that's a guaranteed lock is not a good sign for the GOP.\n\nAnd few people showed upâ€¦\n\nI don't think it was a softball question. Walz/Harris are having a lot of fun and they've brought the joy to Dems. Trump/Vance are just angry (which is true to form.) It was a gotcha question, and Vance recognized it as such.\n\nThough I agree with your assertion that insulting the guy who asked you the question is a losing gambit.\n\nThis Siena College NY poll includes something a bit worrying.\n\nThe question asks \"which of the following two statements is closer to how you feel:\" 1) \"With democracy at stake, the upcoming election is the most important one of your lifetime\" or 2) \"The upcoming election is no more or no less important than every other election, America will carry on regardless of who wins\".\n\nFirst, I think the question is not worded all that well, given it is leading and only provides two options. But the responses broken down by party are interesting.\n\nDemocrats: Democracy at stake = 79%, Carry on = 19%\n\nRepublicans: Democracy at stake = 77%, Carry on = 21%\n\nIndependents: Democracy at stake = 65%, Carry on = 31%\n\nIf those numbers accurately reflect Republicans beliefs about the election, keeping in mind the limitations of the question, then we have to ask to what extent will those Republicans go to try to \"save democracy\" from the Democrats? Given the J-6 insurrection, it is quite worrying. Add to it the possibility of state legislatures overriding the will of the people by providing alternate electors. Even a Kamala win could result in a loss.\n\nDefinitely an easy question. What makes me smile? When Ohio State beats Michigan. Next!\n\nBut they built a party based on grievance. If you are happy for any reason, it means you are (even temporarily) fine with the status quo and thus a traitor to the cause. You have to be seething 24/7.\n\nThen logically they should not be an elected official\n\nHarris/Walz are doing a thing at 3pm. This is just an attempt to get the spotlight.\n\nAlso, Trump is at his home, where he is most comfortable. Signs of insecurity."
