        "text": "ORLANDO (June 12, 2024) - The U.S. Men’s National Team used a first-half free kick from Christian Pulisic to battle back and earn a 1-1 draw against No. 5-ranked Brazil in the 2024 Allstate Continental Clásico. The crowd of 60,016 at Camping World Stadium set a new attendance record for U.S. Senior National Team match in the state of Florida and also saw the USMNT earn its first draw against the five-time World Cup champions.\n\nThe record-breaking crowd saw an eventful and entertaining encounter as Pulisic’s strike erased Brazil’s early goal from Rodrygo, while English Premier League netminders Matt Turner and Allison put on a breathtaking goalkeeping duel. Turner’s 10-save performance earned him Michelob Ultra Man of the Match honors.\n\nThe Allstate Continental Clásico was the second of two friendlies played in preparation for the 2024 Copa América, which will be staged in the U.S. for the second time. The U.S. suffered a 5-1 setback against Colombia on Saturday and faced even tougher opposition in Orlando. But the USA responded, raised their game and secured a noteworthy result.\n\nBerhalter called Saturday’s loss to Colombia a “wake-up call” and sure enough, the USA looked alert, energetic and enterprising from the opening kickoff against Brazil.\n\nThe hosts were quicker and more decisive on both sides of the ball than four days earlier, and nearly took an early lead on a spectacular effort from Yunus Musah after Weston McKennie laid the ball back to him in the fifth minute and he unleashed a 30-yard rocket that beat Allison cleanly before crashing off the underside of the crossbar, grazing the ‘keeper and bouncing clear.\n\nBerhalter’s team was close to the same group that started against Colombia. Only Musah and striker Ricardo Pepi were changes to the starting lineup. But the pace of play was dramatically different, and the U.S. tested Allison a couple more times in the opening quarter hour.\n\nIt was Brazil that struck first, however. Seconds after Turner denied Vinícius Júnior from close range in the 17th, the USA was beaten by a beautiful Raphinha pass and an alert run and finish from Rodrygo.\n\nBut the Americans didn’t fold. Tim Weah forced a save from Allison in the 20th and then Pulisic won a free kick on the edge of the Brazil penalty area four minutes later. Coming off the most productive and consistent season of his club career, the AC Milan star and U.S. captain drew his side level with a smart delivery that beat Allison to the left post. It was the first goal from a direct free kick in Pulisic’s already-glittering USMNT career, and his 29th international tally overall.\n\nThe Seleção began the second half on the front foot and had more of the ball closer to Turner’s goal, but they lacked a finishing touch. Berhalter inserted striker Folarin Balogun and midfielder Johnny Cardoso, a New Jersey native who was raised in Brazil, in the 65th.\n\nBrazil introduced 17-year-old Palmeiras sensation Endrick at the same time, and the match opened up once again. Endrick nearly scored seconds later but Turner was in position, and then Allison made an acrobatic, left-handed save on a free and clear Pulisic in the 68th.\n\nMany friendlies peter out in the closing minutes, but this one was an end-to-end track meet. Turner matched Allison in the 74th with a brilliant parry of a cheeky toe-poke from Rodrygo, then Allison took his turn with a point-blank denial of U.S. substitute Brenden Aaronson. Pulisic set up that play, then missed a left-footer of his own by mere inches in the 86th. Turner stymied Vinícius shortly thereafter, and the U.S. survived one final Brazil flurry to secure the memorable draw.\n\nThe USMNT is now 1-18-1 all-time against Brazil. Following the famous 1-0 win in the 1998 Concacaf Gold Cup semifinals, the U.S. had dropped 11 straight to the Seleção—it’s longest active losing streak against any opponent. Wednesday’s draw ended that run and gives coach Gregg Berhalter’s squad a welcome lift with the Copa around the corner. Ranked 11th by FIFA, the U.S. is now 2-2-1 in 2024.\n\nThe USMNT will now turn its full attention toward the upcoming Copa América, which kicks off June 20. The Americans’ fifth participation in the prestigious tournament will begin with their Group C opener against Bolivia on June 23 in Arlington, Texas, followed by games against Panama on June 27 in Atlanta and then 15-time champion Uruguay four days later in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nGOAL SCORING RUNDOWN\n\nBRA — Rodrygo (Raphinha), 17th minute: Matt Turner’s long clearance was won by Brazil and picked up by Raphinha, who delivered an incisive pass from the right channel toward Rodrygo on the left. The Real Madrid forward made a smart run between U.S. defenders Joe Scally and Chris Richards, took a touch and beat Turner with a perfectly-placed shot inside the right post. USA 0, BRA 1\n\nUSA - Christian Pulisic, 26th minute: Pulisic was fouled by Brazil’s João Gomes right on the 18-yard line and called his own number for the ensuing free kick. Rather than try to bend the ball over the wall, Pulisic simply bypassed it, hitting a low shot that never rose more than a couple feet off the turf and beat Brazil’s Allison at his right post. USA 1, BRA 1 FINAL.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nTonight’s attendance of 60,016 ranks as the highest for a U.S. Men’s or Women’s National Team match in Florida, beating the previous high of 52,033 for the USMNT’s 2-1 win against Nigeria on June 7, 2014 in Jacksonville in the team’s send-off match for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe attendance mark of 60,016 was also the highest for a U.S. Soccer-controlled USMNT match since April 15, 2015 vs. Mexico in San Antonio (64,369).\n\nTonight was the USMNT’s first draw with Brazil. The result snaps a team-record 11-match losing streak vs. Brazil. The USMNT is now 1-18-1 all-time against their South American counterparts, with the team’s only win coming behind Preki Radosavljevic’s goal in a 1-0 victory in the Gold Cup Semifinal on Feb. 10, 1998. The team remains winless against Brazil in 12-straight matches, currently the longest of any international opponent.\n\nChristian Pulisic’s 26th minute goal was the 29th of his international career. He now sits just one goal behind Brian McBride for fifth on the USMNT’s all-time scoring list.\n\nPulisic’s goal tonight was also his first on a direct free kick for the USMNT. He became the first player to score a direct free kick goal against Brazil since Uruguay’s Luis Suárez in 2021.\n\nPulisic captained the team for the 23rd time tonight, tying Thomas Dooley for eighth on the USMNT’s all-time captains list. The USA is 16-3-4 when Pulisic wears the armband.\n\nMatt Turner made 10 saves on the night, his career best for the USMNT. His previous high for saves in a single match was eight, which came against Morocco on June 1, 2022.\n\nTurner’s 10 saves against Brazil were additionally the most for a USMNT goalkeeper in a single match since Tim Howard made 15 saves against Belgium in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\nWith an average age of 25 years, 151 days, tonight’s Starting XI was the second youngest lineup the USMNT has fielded in 20 all-time matches against Brazil, coming in behind the XI that began the last meeting on Sept. 7, 2018 (23 years, 111 days).\n\nWith an average of 37.3 caps, tonight’s lineup was the third-most experienced in 71 matches under Gregg Berhalter, ranking behind only the Starting XIs from the 2019 Gold Cup Final against Mexico (43.2) and Semifinal against Jamaica (39.4).\n\nBerhalter made two starting lineup changes from Saturday’s match against Colombia, inserting striker Ricardo Pepi for Folarin Balogun and midfielder Yunus Musah for Johnny Cardoso.\n\nPepi earned his first start of the year and just the second in his last 12 international appearances, while Musah earned his second start of 2024.\n\nMcKennie made his 50th career start tonight, becoming the 43rd player to start a half century of USMNT matches.\n\nMaking his 11th appearance tonight, fullback Joe Scally started back-to-back games during the same international window for the first time.\n\nThe USA is 7-2-1 all-time in Orlando, winning the seven matches prior to Wednesday night’s draw in The City Beautiful.\n\nTonight was the USMNT’s first appearance at Camping World Stadium (formerly the Citrus Bowl), since a 1-0 win against Sweden on Jan. 24, 1998, a match where Gregg Berhalter earned his first start in his third international cap.\n\nBerhalter is 43W-15L-13D in 71 matches as USMNT head coach.\n\nForward Josh Sargent (foot injury), was not dressed for tonight’s match.\n\n-U.S. MEN’S NATIONAL TEAM MATCH REPORT-\n\nMatch: United States Men’s National Team vs. Brazil\n\nDate: June 12, 2024\n\nCompetition: International Friendly\n\nVenue: Camping World Stadium; Orlando, Fla.\n\nAttendance: 60,016\n\nKickoff: 7:07 p.m. ET\n\nWeather: 83 degrees, partly cloudy\n\nLineups:\n\nUSA: 1-Matt Turner; 22-Joe Scally (16-Shaq Moore, 85’), 3-Chris Richards, 13-Tim Ream, 5-Antonee Robinson; 7-Gio Reyna (15-Johnny Cardoso, 65’), 6-Yunus Musah (4-Tyler Adams, 76’), 8-Weston McKennie; 21-Tim Weah (11-Brenden Aaronson, 75’), 9-Ricardo Pepi (20-Folarin Balogun, 64’), 10-Christian Pulisic (Capt.),\n\nSubstitutes not used: 18-Ethan Horvath, 25-Sean Johnson, 2-Cameron Carter-Vickers, 12-Miles Robinson, 14-Luca de la Torre, 17-Malik Tillman, 19-Haji Wright, 23-Kristoffer Lund, 24-Mark McKenzie, 26-Timmy Tillman\n\nHead coach: Gregg Berhalter\n\nBRA: 1-Alisson Becker, 17- Lucas Beraldo, 4-Marquinhos, 6-Wendell, 2-Danilo (Capt.), 5-Bruno Guimarães (9-Endrick, 65'), 15-João Gomes (18-Douglas Luiz, 45’), 8-Lucas Paquetá (19-Andreas Pereira, 65’), 10-Rodrygo (22-Gabriel Martinelli, 83’), 7-Vinícius Júnior, 11-Raphinha (20-Sávinho, 65’)\n\nSubstitutes not used: 23-Rafael, 16-Guilherme Arana, 21-Evanilson, 26-Pepê, 12-Bento, 13-Yan Couto, 24-Éderson, 25-Bremer, 14-Gabriel, 3-Éder Militão\n\nHead coach: Dorival Júnior\n\nStats Summary: USA / BRA\n\nShots: 12 / 25\n\nShots on Goal: 7 / 12\n\nSaves: 10 / 6\n\nCorner Kicks: 0 / 9\n\nFouls: 14 / 13\n\nOffside: 0 / 1\n\nMisconduct Summary:\n\nBRA – João Gomes (Caution) 14th minute\n\nOfficials:\n\nReferee: Said Martinez (HON)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Walter Lopez (HON)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Christian Ramirez (HON)\n\n4th Official: Bryan Lopez (GUA)\n\nVAR: Oscar Macias Romo (MEX)\n\nAVAR: Oscar Mejia Garcia (MEX)"
