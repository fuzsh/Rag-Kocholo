        "text": "The military detained the rapists and the minister for prisons led a mob to break into the base to try and stop any arrests. Police cleared the rioters but no rioters were arrested and Ben Gvir is still a minister.\n\nisrael is a failed state.\n\nI guess number of rockets fired doesn't count in this meticulous analysis of war crimes. There have been rockets that hit hospitals, kindergartens, schools, and regular civilian houses in Israel. It's just Israel has a sophisticated technology and Hamas has shit for rockets. But let's not for a second forget that tens of thousands of rockets have been launched, so this whole notion that Hamas is somehow better b/c they can't \"genocide\" is quite idiotic. As I said before, if only 5% of those rockets hit its target, Israel would be destroyed.\n\nThen again, arguing who is worse when the other party is Hamas is a damn low bar.\n\nYou can certainly compare the tonnage of munitions dumped on israel vs tonnage dumped by israel and you will find that israel fares worse in that comparison too.\n\nisrael dropped 25,000 tonnes of high grade explosives into Gaza in one month from October to November alone. That excludes mortar and artillery, just bombs.\n\nhttps://aje.io/rgx8bj\n\nThe most modern Qassam rocket has around 40-50kgs of low grade explosive, the others have less. Unless you are telling me that Hamas has fired 500,000 of its best rockets into israel every month, I think your comparison makes israel look worse.\n\nReported impact snapshot | Gaza Strip (7 August 2024) | United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - occupied Palestinian territory (ochaopt.org)\n\n90% of Gazans bombed out and internally displaced (living in makeshift tents)\n\n495K Gazans facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity\n\nanother 745K facing emergency levels of food insecurity\n\n39,677 Palestinians killed in Gaza since this round of hostilities began and another 91, 645 injured\n\nAccess to healthcare, education & drinking water, all severely limited or non-existent, most of the buildings are in ruins, roads destroyed...\n\n...it's pretty sick and twisted to even try to compare the atrocities committed by Hamas with those committed by Israel, against the entire 2.1 million people living in utterly devastated Gaza.\n\nIts because the state of Israel is metamorphosing into the state of Judea. A more radical, theocratic and messianic version of a Jewish state.\n\nI believe this to be one of the reasons, in addition to the horrible war, for over half a million Israelis flight out of the country.\n\nWhat idiotic website is that?\n\nThey simply count jets and go bigger number is better\n\nFound it: https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.php?country1=israel&country2=pakistan\n\nIsrael is a top 10 airforce in the world.\n\nYes 135 MIG21 sure beats having 35 F35s. I am not going into other stuff.\n\nThe Iron Dome helps.\n\nHamas would be able to kill many more civilians and children if Israel was too poor to afford shooting down their missiles.\n\nSo Hamas gets a pass for their failed attempts at killing children, while the Israel military has better capabilities to kill Palestinian children and Hamas does not care about protecting them anyways, the more dead children, the more support college students give Hamas.\n\nThe problem for me is that Israel could have had moral superiority on this issue. Hamas was awful and Israel was fully justified in responding. But they have squandered the moral high ground, which is awful in itself. Which only makes stitching together some kind of peace for the future just that much harder.\n\nI don't think they could have had an adequate response and still have the moral high ground. Those things don't go together. How could they?\n\nAnd I don't know if either side really wants peace.\n\nIn terms of a single event that's clearly true. But there are other events that over time become more of an escalation. For example, the continued illegal occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of parts of it and the oppression of Palestinians there..\n\nYes, curtailing the West Bank settlements is one very simple thing Israel could be doing that would help their public image while also just being the right thing to do.\n\nOn that note, I highly encourage folks to listen to this podcast (I've referred to it in the past). It is hosted by two Israeli Palestinians who live in Israel. They interview many Israeli/Palestinians and other guests.\n\nOne of the last episodes they interview a \"settler\" who proposed an interesting solution to the two-state idea.\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-23-solution-series-part-1/id1714176763?i=1000662661622"
