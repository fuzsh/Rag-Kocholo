        "text": "The competition has witnessed some world-class emerging talents this season\n\nBrazil, the land of Samba, Cachaca, Christ the Redeemer, and, of course, football. For decades, the nation has produced some of the best footballers and continues to do so. It seems the word “exciting” is frequently used when talking about emerging Brazilian talent and for a good reason, so it is not hard to pick 10 young players who fit that description. Brazilian domestic football (Brasileiro Serie A 2023) is flush with exciting prospects. Here we name a handful of youngsters who are likely to become well-known to an international audience soon.\n\nThe top 10 has been chosen from a variety of clubs, with an emphasis on players who are not just on the rise, but who also have something of a “wow” factor to draw in the crowds.\n\n10. Bruno Praxedes - 21 Years Old - Red Bull Bragantino\n\nA creative player with very good technical ability, 1vs1 short-dribbling skills, close ball control, fast direction shifts in possession and vision to make through passes to the teammates providing dynamism to the team’s last offensive third plays. He is a midfielder who sees the game differently from most revealing creativity, cleverness at his off-the-ball movements, great vision and passing ability to orchestrate or provide dynamism to the team’s build-up process with ease and effectiveness.\n\nHe displays a natural technique to take fast decisions in tight spaces/press-resistant players. A player that always tries to find a vertical option in his game, so he is very capable of pushing his team forward to finishing positions.\n\n9. Matheus Nascimento - 19 Years Old - Botafogo\n\nNascimento is a Goal Poacher, he is a very composed finisher capable of scoring with both feet. Possesses very impressive mid-range and long-range shooting skills. He is constantly on the move looking for space and usually tries to make runs off the shoulder of the last defender to go through on goal.\n\nHe perfectly knows how to use his body to shield the ball from defenders thanks to his technique and ball control. Often moves deep into midfield and draws defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for his teammates.\n\n8. Andrey Santos - 18 Years Old - Champeonato\n\nHis awareness of space, teammates and of opponents is already very accomplished. The teenager is constantly scanning and has a seamless level of intelligence that enables him to move in ways that pin spaces for others, create overloads on either side, make room for himself to receive short, and pick holes in both the midfield and defensive lines of the opposition.\n\nOn the same note, his operation speed is excellent. Although he’s not a ‘big picture’ distributor of the ball who has it all mapped out, his speed of thought once he lifts his head coupled with his ability to get the pass off in such little time is such a high-quality trait that allows him to work the ball out of pressure so consistently.\n\nHis defensive intent is a factor that has allowed him to be trusted as a deep midfielder, often positioned in the double pivot of a 4-4-2. Andrey’s eyes light up when a defensive opportunity presents itself ahead of him. His positioning from an attacking sense enables him to counter-press very effectively, and he’s great at latching onto scraps at either end of the pitch.\n\n7. Marcos Leonardo - 19 years Old - Santos\n\nHe is a pacey and determined forward with killer-instinct, interesting technique on the ball and cleverness at his off-the-ball movements, very good agility, coordination and pace. He possesses very impressive mid-range and long-range shooting skills. He is extremely dangerous on the counter thanks to his pace and acceleration. Marcos Leonardo has proven to be clinical in front of the goal and is capable of scoring a variety of finishes off both feet.\n\nDespite not being the tallest, Marcos Leonardo is also a good header of the ball and has scored a decent percentage of his goals via his head. Marcos Leonardo is a very mobile forward, never staying static waiting for the ball to arrive but instead always looking to find half a yard of space so he can be on the finishing end of moves.\n\n6. Ângelo Gabriel - 18 Years Old - Santos\n\nAngelo made his debut at just 15, which made him the second youngest player to play for Santos, Pele is the third. Looking back at his background, Angelo has always played with an older group of players, such as when he was 15, he was playing for the Under 20 side. At 17, he is now becoming a regular name on the team sheet for Santos and it is no surprise that he is starting to attract interest from the European giants.\n\nGabriel is a wide player who dribbles a fair amount as well as makes a high level of progressive runs. With a stronger left foot, Gabriel likes to start on the right wing before cutting inside on his stronger foot. He is a flair player, a quintessentially Brazilian trait. With rich technical gifts and quick feet, dribbling is his biggest strength.\n\nAngelo is already becoming a regular figure in the first team, he is a year ahead of Neymar when he entered the first team, which is a very positive sign.\n\n5. Thiago Borbas - 20 Years Old - Red Bull Bragantino\n\nWhen Borbas began to gain minutes, he was impressed with his sharp and instinctive movement in the box to score goals while he has since moved to the right flank where his vertical runs have been a constant threat for his team. His first touch is excellent, receiving the ball to lay off while also being able to move into the channels and receive possession.\n\nThe 19-year-old is capable of creating his own opportunities as well as making intelligent double-movements when he moves into the nine-space. Borbas would drop into space to receive possession. Borbas is so confident and authoritative when he receives possession in the channels as his decision-making is impeccable, being able to create opportunities for himself and his teammates which is one of the areas of his game that has come to the fore with his experience as a winger.\n\n4. Matheus Franca - 19 Years Old - Champeonato\n\nThe attacking midfielder is also another player who has been watched by the scouts of Real Madrid, who, in recent years, have identified several gems from Brazil. His talent was there for all to see from a young age as he progressed rapidly through various age groups. France relies more on his intelligence, using his pace at just the right moment to run behind the opposition’s backline. He uses that to play incredible passes through balls and move the ball forward.\n\nFranca loves to use the inside channel. He loves to go to the left wing before cutting inside, which puts the ball on his favoured right foot. Even without the ball, he loves to go to the wings and takes on the opposition defender out of position leaving space for his teammates to exploit. Matheus Franca is a rare talent in the Brazilian football system. While almost all players in his position depend on dribbling and speed to get past their opponents, Franca uses passing and intelligence to achieve the same objectives.\n\n3. Giovani Henrique - 19 Years Old - Palmerias\n\nThe winger likes to drop deep when Palmeiras are building out from the back. By doing this he usually drags his direct opponent with him which opens up space for the right-back. Giovani either sticks close to the sideline or operates in the half-space. In the situations in which Giovani sticks close to the sideline, he sometimes carries the ball forward down the line, awaiting the moment that his opponent makes a tackle.\n\nGiovani has a very good kicking technique, and even though his crosses on his stronger left foot are quite inconsistent, he has the potential to become as dangerous with these crosses as Antony. He exploits his explosive acceleration, good close control and changes of directions to get past his opponents when carrying the ball inside. Giovani is a player who excels at finding and recognizing space.\n\n2. Victor Roque - 18 Years Old - Athletico Paranaense\n\nCapable of playing as a second striker or on the wings, Vitor Rogue has delivered some brilliant performances and is already on the radars of several top European clubs. From Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A to the Campeonato Mineiro to the Copa Libertadores, Vitor Roque performed at each level at a young age, and Athletico Paranaense will be hoping Roque’s growth trajectory continues upward.\n\nVitor Roque’s success at the highest level at such a young age is not only due to his talent but also his brilliant awareness. And a great example of it is his off-the-ball movement, especially in the attacking third. Roque is also very fast and, at the same time, has immense physical strength. While Vitor Roque may be getting fans on their feet with his beautiful play, he remains an unfinished product.\n\n1. Endrick - 16 Years Old - Palmerias\n\nEndrick Felipe is the newest and brightest young star from Brazil, tipped to be the next big thing. People can’t stop raving about his abilities. In recent months, he has scored some eye-catching goals that have made the rounds on social media and piqued the curiosity of fans around the globe. Endrick is a forward for Palmeiras who excels in his position. Despite being only 16 years old, he seems to be a considerably better player than many others in his age category and has proven that at the youth level. His physique is also something that must not be overlooked.\n\nThe player is not the tallest but has a strong, powerful build. He is very strong in duels. He can readily detect tackles and enjoys a good challenge. Endrick’s rapid pace and dribbling prowess help him grab attention in the closing third of the game. His rush ahead and drive past many defenders in one go feels like a piece of cake.\n\nHe handles the ball close with excellent control while also using of his pace when necessary; the mix of control and speed is quite effective when handled in a suitable ratio. Endrick carries the full weight of Brazil’s glorious football heritage. When given the opportunity, he does not hesitate to flaunt his prowess to dance around with the ball and trip others up. Endrick makes a strong case for outstanding finishing ability with pinpoint precision and terrific force in his shots.\n\nEndrick is usually in the right place at the right time as a result of his dribbling talents and positional awareness. He is tough to mark and follow, which is where his speed comes in handy. He asks for the passes, makes the appropriate moves, and exposes and exploits pockets of space to generate a goalscoring opportunity in a flash."
