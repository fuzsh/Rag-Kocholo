        "text": "Emily Fox is guaranteed a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games after the USA narrowly defeated Germany in the semi-final.\n\nDespite an injury scare in the quarter-final, our right-back played the full 120 minutes as the clash went to extra time. After a goalless 90 minutes, Sophia Smith needed just four minutes of extra time to find the breakthrough, sneaking a shot around Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\nThe US will now face Brazil in a repeat of the 2008 final. The Americans became back-to-back Olympic Champions that year, courtesy of Carli Lloyd's extra-time winner.\n\nThe gold medal will be decided on Saturday, 10 August at the Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nIn the other semi-final, it was heartbreak for Laia Codina and Mariona Caldentey as Spain lost 4-2 to Brazil in Marseille.\n\nBoth of our Gunners started for Spain, who went behind early due to a flukish own goal from Irene Paredes, but they fought hard to regain a foothold in the game.\n\nHowever, just before the whistle, Brazil doubled their lead through Gabi Portilho, giving the World Cup champions an uphill battle in the second half.\n\nWith a few chances on goal squandered, Spain were soon caught on the break in the 71st minute and Adriana put the match out of reach. A Brazilian own goal in the 85th minute may have given a glimmer of hope but Kerolin soon snuffed that out with a nutmeg finish to make it 4-1.\n\nWith a staggering 15 minutes of added time indicated, Spain did get one more consolation goal through Salma Paralluelo but it proved too late to change their fortunes.\n\nMariona and Codina now face Germany in the bronze medal match on Friday, 9 August in Lyon."
