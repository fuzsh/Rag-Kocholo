        "text": "Former Barcelona and Brazil striker Romario has confirmed he is set to return to professional football over 15 years after he hung up his boots all the way back in 2009. Romario enjoyed a successful playing career, winning the World Cup in 1994 and starring for Dutch side PSV and La Liga giants Barcelona among other clubs.\n\nEdnews informs via goal.com that Romario has now registered himself as a player for America Football Club, where he serves as president and also where his son, Romarinho, plays his football. He's made it clear that playing with his son and for his \"favourite\" team is his main motivation and it's not expected he will feature in any league games. The Brazilian legend will earn a \"minimum wage\" at the club but will return it to America as a donation.\n\nAmerica Football Club currently play in the second division of Brazil's Campeonato Carioca and are preparing for the start of a new sason which kicks off on May 18. It remains to be seen when Romario will make his debut for his latest club."
