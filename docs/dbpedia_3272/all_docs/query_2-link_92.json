        "text": "FT - Brazil power past world champions in hunt for gold\n\nBrazil have beaten Spain 4-2 in the semi-final of the Paris 2024 Olympics to set up a gold-medal showdown with the USA on Saturday.\n\nWorld champions Spain were favourites but it was Brazil who raced into a one-goal lead after a calamitous mix-up from Cata Coll in the Spain goal saw captain Irene Paredes turn it into her own net.\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024 (W)\n\nHayes leads USA to Olympic gold after Swanson’s strike seals win over Brazil\n\n10/08/2024 at 17:37\n\nStrikes from Gabi Portilho and Adriana either side of the interval saw Arthur Elias’ team take a deserved 3-0 lead as the game approached its closing stages.\n\nSalma Paralluelo gave Spain a glimmer of hope with a late header before a breakaway goal from Kerolin on the stroke of the 90th minute restored Brazil’s three-goal cushion.\n\nSpain’s number nine scored a second deep into added time but it wasn’t enough for Montse Tome’s side who will now face Germany in the battle for bronze.\n\nFull time: Brazil 4-2 Spain\n\nThere it is! The full-time whistle blows and Brazil have beaten Spain 4-2 to reach the gold-medal match against the USA. A big upset but a fully-deserved result for Arthur Elias' side.\n\n90+15' Paralluelo looking for hat-trick\n\nWith added time coming to an end Caldentey plays a low ball across from the left that Paralluelo tries to get on the end of but she can't quite get a toe on it. Agonising for Spain.\n\nIt's a corner now for Spain though. Bonmati goes for the curler as its headed clear but its high and wide.\n\n90+11 Goal! Brazil 4-2 Spain (Paralluelo)\n\nSpain have another and it was almost an identical move to their first. A corner from the left is played deep and headed on by Putellas this time on the penalty spot. It finds Paralleulo again whose first effort is blocked but she makes no mistake on the follow up to get her second of the game. Game on?\n\n90+8' Paralleulo stings the palms of Lorena\n\nNunes is running into the corner when there is still around 10 minutes to go. I suppose it's sensible enough with the three-goal cushion.\n\nSpain win it back and manage to slip in Paralleulo on the left of the box. Her low fizzing effort is stopped well by Lorena.\n\n90+4' Spain deflated after fourth goal\n\nAs the lengthy period of added time gets underway, that goal may have just taken the sting out of these closing stages when Spain looked like they might just believe they could mount a comeback. Coll's kicking has been a real Achilles heel in the Spain side tonight.\n\nBrazil legend Marta will surely have one more match in these Olympics after her two-match suspension.\n\n90' Goal! Brazil 4-1 Spain (Kerolin)\n\nAs 15 minutes of added time are announced Coll makes a mess of another goal-kick. She looks to go long but doesn't conect with it and it pings it into her full-back who tries to clear it in a panic. Kerolin intercepts it and is on goal. She makes no mistakes as she pops the ball through Coll's legs for four.\n\n86' Spain hit the crossbar\n\nMoments after the restart Bonmati finds Putellas on the edge of the box. The Barcelona midfielder looks to curl one into the top right corner but Lorena tips it onto the crossbar - great save!\n\nThe keeper is called into action once again as Putellas tries her luck again but she saves well - more straightforward this time. Spain then survive a goalmouth scramble in their box.\n\n85' Goal! Brazil 3-1 Spain (Paralleulo)\n\nSpain's corner from the left is played deep towards the edge of the box. Hermoso heads it on to Paralleulo who heads it towards the back post. Duda Sampaio should head clear but she gets it all wrong and the ball and it ends up in the bottom left corner. Maybe an own goal.\n\n84' Spain pushing\n\nThere is an almighty goalmouth scramble in the Brazil six-yard box but Brazil eventually clear. Moments later Bonmati plays a ball across the six-yard box. Tarciane gets a toe on it towards Lorena who makes a meal of it as it bobbles back to her but she does manage to get a hold of it in the nick of time.\n\nCaldentey tries from range but Duda Sampaio makes a great block.\n\n80' Spain frustrated as game slows down\n\nBrazil's keeper Lorena is down again but this time she may have a case although it is from her on player. As Tarciane looked to shield the ball through to her keeper she stood on Lorena's ankle. The Spain players are fuming with the theatrics on show tonight.\n\n77' Changes all round\n\nLauren Leal is down with cramp now and there is a stretcher to take her off here. Priscila is also set to make way. Gabi Nunes and Kerolin come on. They are running out of players here Brazil so a change of system may be required. Alexia Putellas is on for Spain in place of defender Laia Codina.\n\n72' Goal! Brazil 3-0 Spain ( Adriana)\n\nBrazil break from Spain's corner through Priscila who picks it up on the left just past the halfway line. She drives to the edge of the box before slipping in Adriana on the right of the box who should score but she rattles the bar. The ball lands on the head of Portilho on the left of the six-yard box. She nods it back to Adriana at the back post and she can head home from less than a yard out. A deserved lead for Brazil who could have scored four or five tonight.\n\n71' Hermoso strikes from range\n\nBrazil are start to look a bit leggy now. Hermoso is found on the edge of the box with time to line up an effort from range. She looks to curl it into that top right corner but Lorena can save and turn it behind for a corner. The delivery hits the first man.\n\n68' Lorena down again\n\nBrazil's keeper Lorena is down again. A few boos ring around the ground with plenty suspecting she is up to her time-wasting antics once again. The second goalkeeper Luciana is warming up with a lack of conviction that maybe gives it away.\n\nBrazil's tactics are made evident as the ball falls to Tarciane about 50 yards out. The defender hits it as hard as she can well over the bar. Vitoria is on for Jheniffer for Brazil.\n\n64' Spain build pressure but can't find opening\n\nSpain win yet another corner before they win a foul in a similar position on the left. They need to make these set pieces count sooner rather than later.\n\nLorena gets her palms to it but with enough force to clear. Yaya plays a long ball to Portilho who thinks she's fouled but play is waved on.\n\n59' Spain struggle to find rhythm\n\nDuda Sampaio nearly makes an instant impact as she intercepts while Spain are looking to play out. She finds herself on the left of the box but drags her shot wide. Perhaps a tad ambitious from that angle.\n\nDown the other end Lorena punches clear from a corner - more confident this time from the Brazil keeper. Priscila completes the clearance.\n\n58' Double change for Brazil\n\nUnfortunately for Brazil Ludmila appears to have been forced off - she indicated moments ago that she was struggling with something. Adriana is on in her place. Meanwhile, Duda Sampaio is on for Angelina.\n\n56' Thais gets fortunate\n\nSpain work it down their left before Bonmati plays a low cross into the box. Thais looks to lash it clear but it skews it over her own crossbar. She was very lucky that didn't crash into the back of the net.\n\nSpain suddenly have the momentum as Lorena has a couple of moments of nervous handling. Paralleulo goes close at the back post from a corner but is stretching just too much to get it on target.\n\n53' Another change for Spain\n\nTome has already seen enough from her second half outfit as she withdraws her skipper Paredes. Maybe that mishap moments before was the catalyst for that change.\n\nLudmila then cuts in from the right and unleashes with her left from range. It's a great effort that Coll is forced to tip over the bar. Good save. Ludmila has been so dangerous all evening. From the resulting corner Lauren Leal tips it on at the near post and Jheniffer gets millimetres away from poking home at the back post. So so close again.\n\n50' Should be three!\n\nNealry another disaster for Spain as Paredes and Codina get in each other's way as they look to play it back to Coll. Portilho is through but prods her effort just wide of the left post.\n\nMoments later Priscila has en effort from the edge of the box that goes wide of the upright. Spain hanging on here.\n\n46' Double-change for Spain\n\nSpain get us underway here for the second half in Marseille kicking from left to right.\n\nAthenea del Castillo and Oihane Hernandez are on for Eva Navvaro and Olga Carmona for Spain.\n\nHT - USA progress in earlier semi-final\n\nA reminder that the USA beat Germany 1-0 in extra-time in the first semi-final of the evening to progress to the gold-medal match.\n\nSofia Smith broke the deadlock for Emma Hayes's side in the 95th minute after the two sides had kept each other at bay for the opening 90 minutes.\n\nThe USA will face the winner of this clash in Marseille, which as it stands is looking likely to be Brazil unless we see a major comeback in the second half from the world champions.\n\nHalf-time: Brazil 2-0 Spain\n\nThat late goal from Portilho has left Spain with a mountain to climb in the second half, just as they did against Colombia in the quarter-finals.\n\nIt was nothing more than Brazil deserved having had two or three great chance to double their lead - particularly through Priscila who fluffed her lines when in on goal.\n\nWhile the goal on the stroke of half-time was down to pure brilliance from Brazil, the goal to break the deadlock after six minutes was a moment of madness from Spain.\n\nColl's clearance deflected back off her captain Parades and into her own net despite the keeper having plenty of time. All to do for Spain in the second half!\n\n45+4 goal! Brazil 2-0 Spain (Gabi Portilho)\n\nAs half-time was approaching Brazil have doubled their lead and deservedly so. Yasmin delivers a wonderful sweeping cross in behind the Spain defence from the left-hand side that finds Portilho around the penalty spot. The Brazil forward just opens up her right foot to guide it home into the bottom corner.\n\n45+3' Yellow for Abelleira\n\nSpain look to find themselves in a promising position as Bonmati finds Hermoso on the edge of the box but they are just crowded out by Brazil. The ball is forced wide but the resulting cross goes into a sea of yellow and is cleared.\n\nAs Brazil look to counter Abelleira picks up a yellow card for a tactical pull-back.\n\n45+1' Four minutes of added time\n\nFor the first time in the match Paralleulo is freed in behind but there is no one there as the forward looks to cut the ball across the six-yard box as it's cleared the for the corner.\n\nLorena punches clear before she collects it moments later after Bonmati's disguised pass. 4 minutes to be added on here.\n\n44' Brazil strong in the challenge\n\nBrazil have a corner but Spain do well to clear and it ends up back with Lorena.\n\nBrazil have been noticeably stronger in the tackles tonight. They have been the better team anyway but this bit of intensity off the ball seems to be upsetting the rhythm of Spain so far.\n\n40' Massive chance for 2-0\n\nYaya breaks up play in midfield and plays a sweeping pass in behind in a similar fashion to Ludmila moments before. This time it finds the path of Priscila who is on goal with just Coll to beat but she drags her effort wide of the post. The teenager looks gutted. That was a massive chance to double their lead ahead of the interval.\n\nSpain look really vulnerable on the counter with Brazil's pace in attack and some sublime passing finding the runs being made in behind.\n\n36' Ludmila passing causing problems\n\nTarciane does superbly to sweep round and put the challenge in on Paralleulo. Brazil look a bit more flustered this time by the resulting corner but eventually clear.\n\nLudmila plays another delightful looking through-ball as they look to counter but Coll comes out to clear. Ludmila has shown a superb range of passing so far.\n\n34' Spain pressure but Brazil dangerous on counter\n\nSpain have ramped up the pressure here and have Brazil penned in. But the Brazilians are generally coping with what is being thrown at them. They have some good height and good numbers to defend in and around the box.\n\nOn the counter Brazil are nearly in as Ludmila plays a lovely through ball towards the path of Jheniffer but Carmona just gets a toe on it as she faces her own goal to take it away from the Brazil forward. A vital interception.\n\n31' Great effort from Hermoso\n\nAfter some intricate footwork from Bonmati the ball pinballs around the edge of the box before dropping to Hermoso on the edge of the box who lets fly with a delightful half volley on the left foot. It's a really sweet strike but a decent height for Lorena who parries away well. Better from Spain.\n\n27' Brazil look the more likely\n\nPriscila receives a floated ball in the box and does excellently to take it under control and spin to make room for the shot but Spain do well to block her effort. A really strong start from Brazil who look more likely to get the next goal.\n\nScreams of frustrations can be heard from the Spanish players as a pass goes wayward - they're not it having it their way here so far.\n\n24' Should be two!\n\nTarciane plays a delightful long ball over the top to Ludmila. The wing-back is bearing down on goal on the right of the six-yard box but her lacklustre effort is saved at the near post. She probably should have squared that.\n\nThe ball then falls to Portilho who is ready to let fly in the box but Carmona nicks it off her at the last minute to prevent the strike. Down the other end Spain have a series of corners that come to nothing.\n\n21' Bonmati shoots wide\n\nThe ball drops to Ballon D'or winner Bonmati who works it onto her left foot but she can't quite wrap her foot around it and it drifts wide of the left post.\n\nLorena goes down with an injury which some may be sceptical of with her time-wasting antics in the previous rounds. Luciana is warming up but you feel she won't be called upon just yet.\n\n17' Spain settle into tie\n\nThe Brazilians already showing signs of time wasting not even halfway through this opening period. Spain work it nicely down their left after a spell of possession but Caldentey's cross is cleared.\n\n12' Huge chance for two!\n\nLudmila does really well down Brazil's left to get past Carmona and make it to the by-line. She plays a low ball across the six yard box which Coll parries straight into the path of Portilho who blazes over. A glorious chance to double their lead. A surprising lack of composure from the forward there.\n\n9' Nervy start for Coll\n\nParedes looks to make amends down the other end - not that she was at fault - but she is crodwed out as the free-kick comes in.\n\nAnother really nervy clearance from Coll as she looks to go long but scuffs it down the middle. Brazil work the chance of a shot through Jhennifer but it is safely into the arms of the grateful keeper.\n\n6' GOAL! BRAZIL 1-0 SPAIN (PAREDES - OWN GOAL)\n\nDisaster for the world champions! The ball is played back to Coll in Spain for goal, she has enough time to comfortbaly clear but mishits her clearance and it deflects back off her own captain Parades and into the back of the net. Calamitous start for the favourites here.\n\n3' Frantic opening stages\n\nPriscila puts in a tough challenge on Spain captain Paredes but the referee correctly calls it as a foul. Intentions made clear early on from the Brazil forward!\n\nA bit of hesitancy from Tarciane as the ball is played over the top towards Paralleulo but the ball eventually makes its way into Loreno's arms. Down the other end a masked Coll does well to claim a hooked ball over the top of Spain's defence.\n\n1' We are underway in Marseille\n\nBrazil get us underway here for the second semi-final in Marseille kicking from left to right.\n\nRebecca Welch of Great Britain is the referee for tonight's match.\n\n7:55 - Five minutes until kick-off\n\nWe are just five minutes from this second semi final getting underway. Will the current world champions Spain find their group stage form once again or will Brazil pick up from where they left off against the hosts?\n\n7:50 - Surprise omissions\n\nSpain’s seven goals have come from a variety of sources but Alexia Putellas is the only player to register twice with the Barcelona forward having already scored against Brazil in the Paris Games after her winner against Nigeria. She is dropped to the bench tonight however.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil have found the back of the net just three times so far with the strike partnership of Gabi Portilho and Gabi Nunes bagging two of these. It is somewhat surprising to see Elias disrupt this duo as Nunes drops out.\n\n7:45 - At stake for the winner\n\nThe winner of tonight’s semi-final will progress to the gold-medal match to face the USA following their 1-0 win in the earlier fixture.\n\nVictory will guarantee the winning side at least a silver medal while the bronze will be up for grabs for the losing team as they take on Germany.\n\n7:40 - Spain’s journey to the final four\n\nSpain enjoyed a much more comfortable progression to the knockout stages than Brazil as they topped Group C with a perfect record.\n\nTome’s side kicked things off with a 2-1 win over Japan before beating Nigeria 1-0, meaning their 2-0 victory over Brazil in their final group game sealed the 100% winning start.\n\nWhile Brazil lifted their performance for the knockout stages, Spain’s levels appeared to dip as they came up against the other best third-placed team along with Brazil - Colombia.\n\nLa Roja needed a 97th-minute equaliser from Irene Paredes to send the game to extra-time after trailing by two goals to nil until the 79th minute when Jenni Hermoso pegged one back.\n\nFour penalties out of four from Spain in the shootout were enough for them to avoid the upset and progress to the final four.\n\n7:35 - USA win Tueday's first semi-final\n\nThe USA have beaten Germany 1-0 in extra-time in the first semi-final of the evening to progress to the gold-medal match.\n\nSofia Smith broke the deadlock for Emma Hayes's side in the 95th minute after the two sides had kept each other at bay for the opening 90 minutes.\n\n7:30 - Brazil’s route to the semi-final\n\nAs mentioned in tonight’s preview, Brazil endured a difficult group stage following their opening 1-0 victory over Nigeria thanks to Gabi Nunes’ first-half strike.\n\nA 2-1 defeat against Japan before a 2-0 loss against tonight’s opponents left them in third place in Group C.\n\nHowever, their superior goal difference to Australia meant they narrowly progressed as the second-best of the three third-placed teams.\n\nGiven Brazils’ form and the fact France had topped Group A, it came as a shock when Elias’ side beat the hosts 1-0 in the quarter-finals thanks to Gabi Portilho’s goal in the final 10 minutes of the match.\n\n19:25 - Those line-ups in full\n\nBrazil: Lorena; Thais,Tarciane, Lauren Leal; Ludmila, Alonso Angelina (c), Yaya, Yasmim; Priscila, Gabi Portilho, Jheniffer.\n\nSubs: Kerolin, Duda Sampaio, Ana Vitoria, Gabi Nunes, Adriana, Luciana.\n\nSpain: Cata Coll; Ona Batlle, Irene Paredes (c), Laia Codina, Olga Carmona; Aitana Bonmatí, Teresa Abelleira, Jenni Hermoso; Eva Navarro, Salma Paralluelo, Mariona Caldentey.\n\nSubs: Oihane Hernandez, Laia Aleixandri, Lucia Garcia, Patri Guijarro, Alexia Putellas, Misa, Athenea del Castillo.\n\n19:20 Spain line-up\n\nMontserrat Tome has made four changes to the side that beat Colombia on penalties.\n\nSpain’s first goalscorer from that quarter-final clash, Jenni Hermoso, is one of the players to come into the team in place of Alexia Putellas.\n\nTeresa Abelleira, Laia Codina and Eva Navarro are also brought into the starting 11 while Laia Aleixandri, Patri Guijarro, and Athenea del Castillo make way.\n\n19:17 - Brazil line-up\n\nThere are five changes to the Brazil side that beat France 1-0 with Rafaelle Souza, Duda Sampaio, Vitoria, Adriana, and Gabi Nunes all making way from the starting 11.\n\nArthur Elias brings in Lauren Leal, Ludmila, Yaya, Priscila and the captain for this evening’s game - Alonso Angelina.\n\nIt looks as if Elias has adopted a 3-4-3 as opposed to Brazil's usual 4-4-2 system.\n\n19:15 - Chance at redemption for Brazil in Marseille\n\nGood evening and welcome to live text coverage of the semi-final clash between Brazil and Spain at Marseille Stadium at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nTonight’s fixture will be the second time the sides have met at the Paris Games after Montserrat Tome’s Spain side defeated Brazil 2-0 in their third and final group game to top Group C with a 100% record.\n\nThis was the second defeat of Brazil’s campaign after Arthur Elias’ side lost 2-1 to Japan meaning they progressed only as a best third-placed team.\n\nHowever, it was Brazil who progressed more safely through their quarter-final fixture as they upset the host nation France in a 1-0 win while La Roja needed penalties to make it past Colombia after a 2-2 draw.\n\nAt stake is a place in the gold medal match against USA or Germany and the guarantee of at least a silver medal. Brazil are looking to go one better than the semi-finals they reached at Rio 2016 where they ultimately finished 4th.\n\n- - -\n\ndiscovery+ is the streaming home of the Olympic Games, and the only place you can watch every moment of Paris 2024 this summer\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024\n\nBrazil v USA - Olympic women's football gold medal match as it happened\n\n10/08/2024 at 17:23\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024\n\nSpain 0-1 Germany - Olympic women's football bronze medal match as it happened\n\n09/08/2024 at 15:10"
