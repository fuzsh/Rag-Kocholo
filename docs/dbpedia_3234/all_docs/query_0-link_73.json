        "text": "The 4th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2023)\n\nSoftware pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers. Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA). Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decade. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.\n\nAST continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. This year AST 2023 is the 4th edition of a conference that was formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field.

Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA). Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decade. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud. AST continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. This year AST 2023 is the 4th edition of a conference that was formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on:\n\nlessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice;\n\nexperiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques;\n\nbest practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and\n\ntheoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.\n\nTopics of Interest\n\nSubmissions on the AST 2023 theme are especially encouraged, but papers on other topics relevant to the automation of software tests are also welcome.

Regular Papers (up to 10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references)\n\nResearch Paper\n\nIndustrial Case Study\n\n2. Short Papers (up to 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references)\n\nResearch Paper\n\nIndustrial Case Study\n\nDoctoral Student Research\n\n3. Industrial Abstracts (up to 2 pages for all materials)\n\nInstructions: Regular papers include both Research papers that present research in the area of software test automation, and Industrial Case Studies that report on practical applications of test automation. Regular papers must not exceed 10 pages for all materials (including the main text, appendices, figures, tables) plus 2 additional pages of references.\n\nShort papers also include both Research papers and Industrial Case Studies. Short papers must not exceed 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references. As short papers, doctoral students working on software testing are encouraged to submit their work. AST will have an independent session to bring doctoral students working on software testing, with experts assigned to each paper together, to discuss their research in a constructive and international atmosphere, and to prepare for the defense exam. The first author in a submission must be the doctoral student and the second author the advisor. Authors of selected submissions will be invited to make a brief presentation followed by a constructive discussion in a session dedicated to doctoral students.\n\nIndustrial abstract talks are specifically conceived to promote industrial participation: We require the first author of such papers to come from industry. Authors of accepted papers get invited to give a talk with the same time length and within the same sessions as regular papers. Industrial abstracts must not exceed 2 pages for all materials.\n\nThe submission website is: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ast2023\n\nAll submissions must adhere to the following requirements:\n\nThe page limit is strict (10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for full papers; 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references for short papers; 2 pages for all materials in case of industrial abstracts). It will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).\n\nSubmissions must strictly conform to the IEEE formatting instructions. All submissions must be in PDF.\n\nSubmissions must be unpublished original work and should not be under review or submitted elsewhere while being under consideration. AST 2023 will follow the single-blind review process. In addition, by submitting to AST, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. The authors also acknowledge that they conform to the authorship policy of the ACM and the authorship policy of the IEEE.\n\nThe accepted regular and short papers, case studies, and industrial abstracts will be published in the ICSE 2023 Co-located Event Proceedings and included in the IEEE and ACM Digital Libraries. Authors of accepted papers are required to register and present their accepted paper at the conference in order for the paper to be included in the proceedings and the Digital Libraries.\n\nThe official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM or IEEE Digital Libraries.\n\nThis date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2023. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\nKeynotes\n\nKeynote 1: Lessons from 10 Years of Automated Debugging Research\n\nAbstract\n\nThe last decade or so has seen dramatic developments in automated debugging, including fault localisation and automated program repair. This talk will look back at 10 years of my experience from working on automated debugging, starting from evolving Spectrum Based Fault Localisation, culminating to the latest work on failure reproduction using Large Language Models. We will look at how serendipitous encounters led to new ideas, how getting slightly outside your comfort zone can help you, and how best we can collaborate with industry in order to transfer our research.\n\nBio\n\nShin Yoo is Associate Professor in the School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

To that end, both researchers and tool builders have made considerable efforts to make software testing more efficient and more effective. We have the tools, but where do we put our money? In other words, what do we know about software engineers or software testers that actually write and execute tests? What stimulates them, what blocks them, and what do they need from tools, documentation, production code, or their team?\n\nBio\n\nAndy Zaidman is a full professor at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. He received his MSc and PhD from the University of Antwerp, Belgium. He has been at Delft University of Technology since 2006.\n\nHis research interests include software testing, software evolution and software analytics. He is an active member of the research community and has been involved in the organisation of conferences such as ICSME, WCRE (general chair & program chair), CSMR, VISSOFT (program chair) and MSR (general chair). In 2015 he gave a talk a TEDxDelft “Making Testing Fun”.\n\nIn 2013 he received a prestigious NWO Vidi career grant from NWO, the Dutch science foundation, for his work in the area of software testing and software evolution. In 2019, he received the Vici career grant, the most prestigious career grant from the Dutch science foundation.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @azaidman\n\nSlides\n\nRegistration\n\nPlease refer to the ICSE Registration page."
