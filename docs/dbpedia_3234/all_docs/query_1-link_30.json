        "text": "Discussion\n\nGraves’ disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. [3] Hyperthyroid conditions such as GD were once thought to be protective against thyroid cancer; however, recent studies suggest an increased prevalence of DTC among those with GD. [7] The incidence of thyroid carcinoma associated with GD has been reported to range from 1.8% to 6.5% in recent studies. [1], [6], [8] The annual incidence of thyroid cancer in GD in one study was reported as 175 per 100,000 [4]. Another longitudinal cohort study found the incidence of developing cancer in GD was 4.92 per 1000 person- years [9].The presence of solitary or multiple thyroid nodules is a common finding among those with thyroid disorders. A recent meta-analysis published in 2019 involving 2,582 patients treated with surgery found that the presence of at least one thyroid nodule in patients with GD was associated with higher risk for thyroid cancer (odds ratio 5.3) [10]. A subgroup analysis showed no difference in thyroid cancer risk in patients with GD according to the number of nodules (solitary versus multiple) (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9–2.3) [10].\n\nCorrelation of GD with DTC and the pathogenesis remains controversial. Although the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer in patients with Graves’ disease is not well understood, it is postulated that the probable mechanism of increased prevalence of thyroid cancer in patients with GD is primarily the binding of Thyroid Receptor Ab to thyrotropin receptor, which promotes tumor formation, angiogenesis, and further progression of the invasiveness of cancer [11]. Chronic immune processes appear to be linked to tumorigenesis as the gland microenvironment has higher infiltrating immune competent cells, cytokines, and growth factors, that are essential components of carcinogenesis. Some thyroid carcinomas retain their TSH receptors [12] and TSH-dependent adenylate cyclase [13], therefore likely more responsive to TSI. In vitro studies done from IgG isolated from serum of patients with GD have shown that thyroid carcinoma cells respond to TSI [14]. A study of incidental thyroid cancer among 245 patients with GD found no correlation between increased incidence of TSI ab and prevalence of DTC with an AUC curve of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.64). [15] Another study of 10 patients did not show role of TSI in growth of metastatic lesions [16].\n\nPTC is the most common type of DTC found in patients with GD and is usually mutifocal. [1], [6], [17]A small study of 21 patients with non-occult DTC in GD disease found PTC in 91.4% of patients. A multicenter, retrospective study of 193 patients with GD found classic variant of PTC was most common (57.5%), tall cell variant present in 13.5%, follicular variant of PTC in 25.9% and rate of multifocality was significantly more in patients with GD compared to patients without GD17. Microcarcinomas have been reported to be significantly more frequent in patients with GD (60% vs 37%, p < 0.0001) [18]. In the same study, rate of recurrence/persistent disease at the end of 7.5 years was reported to be significantly higher in DTC/GD group if the tumor was ≥1 cm (24% vs. 12% in the DTC/GD − group).18Mean age of incidence of DTC in association with GD has been reported to occur about a decade earlier in comparison to DTC without GD in prior studies [4], [15]. In our current study patients with GD were diagnosed with DTC at a younger age (mean age 47 years) when compared to patients without GD (mean age 53 years) but it was not statistically significant (p-value of 0.105).\n\nDTC prognosis in GD is controversial with some studies showing GD affects the prognosis of DTC while others indicating that thyroid cancer in GD is not more aggressive than in euthyroid patients. [4], [6], [18], [19], [20] Study of 22 patients with DTC and hyperthyroidism found that patients with DTC had more locally invasive (61.5% vs 11.1%), metastatic to lymph node (61.5% vs 11.1%), metastasis to distant sites(23% vs 0%) rates compared to patients with autonomous thyroid nodules. [18] Among 21 patients with non-occult DTC in GD evaluated between 1982 and 1994 the rate of distant metastases and relapse was higher in patients with GD and the cumulative risk for recurrent or progressive distant metastases was about 3 times higher in GD compared to non-GD (odds ratio = 3.14) [4]. When followed up for a longer time, persistent/recurrent disease was more common in DCT -GD group compared to euthyroid DTC group and the DTC-GD group also had a shorter disease free survival. [19] In contrast, a retrospective study of 509 patients with GD and DTC found that disease free survival was better in patients with DTC and GD at 20 years follow up (99 vs 93%; p < 0.001). [20] A retrospective study of children and young adults with DTC/GD and DTC/-GD found no significant difference in disease burden or extent of metastases, long term disease outcome survival in both the groups. [6] Another analysis of incidentally discovered DTC among patients with euthyroid goiter compared with GD found that there was a trend towards increased extension to extrathyroidal tissues, central and lateral lymph node metastasis among patients with GD however this was not statistically significant. [15] A matched cohort study of surgically treated GD patients found the incidence of aggressive carcinomas in 13% patients with GD vs 20% in control with no difference in outcome. [21] In a recent South Korean study of 262 patients with GD and DTC no difference in thyroid cancer aggressiveness, clinical outcomes or prognosis was observed among those with nodular and non-nodular GD [22].\n\nIn our study, patients with GD had significantly more Stage 1 and 2 DTC compared to patients without GD (p- value 0.009) indicating favorable prognosis. The presence of GD was associated with smaller initial tumor size (p < 0.002). Routine US imaging with aspiration helps early diagnosis of DTC in GD. Our findings indicate that DTC is found earlier when compared to non-GD patients and that can be a result of incidental early detection of DTC due to routine ultrasound imaging. Many patients undergo total thyroidectomies for GD treatment, and we might be detecting early-stage DTC incidentally. A study to look if Thyroid Stimulating antibodies have a role to play in the pathogenesis of DTC in GD would be interesting. Pre-operative assessment and findings of nodules should consider risk of cancer in GD patients. A major limitation of the study is that it represents patients from a single center, has a small sample size and is retrospective."
