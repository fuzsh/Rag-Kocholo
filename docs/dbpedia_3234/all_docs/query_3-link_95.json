        "text": "*\n\nJuly 12, 2023\n\nThe third book in a trilogy series related to the Indian Epics, Kathakali and Shakespeare -SHAKESPEARE MEETS THE INDIAN EPICS: COMPARATIVE THEMES AND INTERPRETATIONS has been published by Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Newcastle, UK.\n\nThis book demonstrates that people writing and creating characters almost 6,000 miles apart, and in different centuries, have a lot more in common than one might expect. It examines the day-to-day themes appearing in the two epics, The Ramayana and The Mahanbharata and some of Shakespeares plays and looks at specific themes and character pairs from the two genres. The book reveals that whatever backgrounds people may have, they ultimately tend to tackle life in very similar ways and this claim is substantiated with many pertinent examples drawn from diverse disciplines such as management, psychology and military rules of engagement. This book along with the other books in the trilogy are positioned as academic books and will be of interest to practitioners of the theatre, students of performing arts and aficionados of the Epics and Shakespeare.\n\nThe other two books in this trilogy have also been published by Cambridge Scholars Publishing - Vignettes Relating to Kathakali and Shakespeare: the Thirasheela versus the Curtain and Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair, the Mozart of Kathakali. So the trilogy consists of firstly a comparison of characters in Shakespeare and the two Indian epics, followed by a detailed study of an individual actor and his links to Sir Laurence Olivier and ends with a comparison of the themes in the two genres. Overall, the trilogy presents a comprehensive examination of how commonalities exist in seemingly uncommon places if an in depth study is done.\n\nYou may view the description, author details and an extract from the book\n\nHardback\n\nISBN: 1-5275-1541-9\n\nISBN13: 978-1-5275-1541-3\n\nRelease Date: 19th June 2023\n\nPages: 386\n\nPrice: £77.99\n\n*\n\nMay 12, 2023\n\nIn ancient India, women competed to win the title of Nagarvadhu, quite literally the town's consort. For certain temple worship (Agamas), dance and music were necessary ingredients. The women artists dedicated to the worshipDevadasis and Maharishad a high rank and dignity in society. Tawaifs were central to Mughal court culture from the sixteenth century. It is also believed that young heirs were sent to courtesans to learn 'tameez' and 'tehzeeb', including the appreciation of good music and literature.\n\nCOURTING HINDUSTAN is a deeply researched, elegantly crafted portrait of some of the most intriguing women figures practising traditional Indian entertainment art forms such as, music, dance and poetry. It relives 2,500 golden years of women being elite traditional performers and how, over the centuries, they have captured the imagination of the country and the world at large, their art and lives being a complex response to social forces and cultural conditions.\n\nCOURTING HINDUSTAN delves into the scintillating world of courtesans who went on to become empresses, queens, prima donnas, pioneer filmmakers, music directors, ace dancers and so much more. Many of them went on to rule kingdoms, enjoyed positions of great power; many were venerated by governments and yet they lived on the fringes of society. In many ways, these were women, first of their kind, to survive an entrenched patriarchal society and break the chains imposed on them, paving the way for generations of women to come and conquer.\n\nAbout the author: Madhur Gupta is one of the leading Odissi dance exponents of his generation. The Indian Express has hailed Gupta as one of the few male artists (in a field mostly dominated by women), who not only pursued Indian classical dance with devotion but also excelled at it. Beginning his initial training in Kathak with a maestro like Pt Birju Maharaj, he was strongly drawn towards Odissi as his life's calling. He has also had the fortune of interacting and learning from masters like Madhavi Mudgal, Bichitrananda Swain and Kumkum Lal. Madhur is currently in advanced training under Guru Sharon Lowen in the Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra style of Odissi. Apart from extensively touring, performing and writing, Madhur also teaches Odissi at Sangeet Vidya Niketan, New Delhi.\n\nTitle: Courting Hindustan: The Consuming Passions of Iconic Women Performers of India\n\nAuthor: Madhur Gupta\n\nPublisher: Rupa Publications India\n\nPrice: INR 295\n\nISBN: 978-93-5702-103-6\n\nPP: 208\n\n*\n\nMarch 19, 2019\n\nVARNA VARNANAM - a compilation of rare Pada varnams and Tana varnams for both music concerts and natya compositions by Dr. Kanakam Devaguptapu, has a Foreword by Guru V.P. Dhananjayan.\n\nCarnatic Music has reached far and wide. Thanks to technology, knowledgeable teachers are able to impart it to all talented youngsters and enthusiasts around the world. Dr. Kanakam also contributes to the popularization of Carnatic music, by imparting the art through skype sessions, in addition to face to face teaching. This publication of rare pada varnams and tana varn̤ams will serve as an additional contribution to the world of Carnatic music. The book is crafted very intelligently to suit the present generation of students and give them a comprehensive in-depth understanding of the language, meaning of the song, correct notation and accurate intonation.\n\nThis author has specified the salient features of selected 'varnams' as under, which will help us know what we can expect from this publication.\n\nThe main focus of the book is to give a comprehensive input about the lyrics and meanings of 26 varnams which will be useful for dance teachers and musicians (concert singers).\n\nOnly two of the compositions are taken from contemporary composers: Suguna Purushottaman and Dr. M. Balamurali Krishna. The remaining 24 varnams are from composers of earlier times, dating back to the 17th century till 20th.\n\n20 varnams are in Telugu, 2 in Tamil, 2 in Sanskrit, 1 in Kannad̤a and 1 in Mal̤ayalam.\n\nThe types of varnams included are: sringara varnams, bhakti varnams, stava varnams, pada varnams, cauka varnams, tana varnams, with lyrics and varnams with anubandham. Details of the same are indicated clearly in the index.\n\nA couple of varn̤ams have anubandham or sampurna caranam. This is a format which has not been in use in recent times. It was in vogue till almost a century ago. The author has included these varnams after consulting very senior musicians, who felt that it is very important to renew the anubandham format, which has almost been forgotten now. For all those varnams where the caranams are incomplete and brief, the anubandham at a later stage helps elaborate the meaning and give a conclusiveness to the composition. Thus the anubandham is a very valuable tool which adds to the lyrical value of the varnam and enhances its thematic beauty.\n\nA couple of varn̤ams have muktayi swara sahityam and anubandham or sampurn̤a caranam. They do not have ettugad̤a swara sahitya. Such varnams can be used for dance programs when the programs are of a shorter duration.\n\nCare has been taken to see that the compositions cover a wide gamut of ragams. Many popular ragas like Sankarabharanam and Tod̤i along with a few not often used ragas like Suddha Bangala have been included. Except for one repetition (Kambhoji), there is no repetition of any other ragam. So, the varnams are in a range of 25 ragas. Thus, all of the varnams bring out different musical flavours!\n\nAll the 26 compositions are taken from 23 different well-known composers (either in their own regions or across South India), from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The two Sanskrit varnams included are taken from Swati Tirunal's works.\n\nThe author has taken efforts to the best of her ability to procure original notations and lyrics, either from printed versions which are at least 50 years old or from manuscripts.\n\n'Varna Varnanam' has been conceptualized, planned, designed, typed out and formatted by Dr. Kanakam herself in order to see that the entire process goes in a smooth manner, with a singular focus of thought, plan and execution.\n\nA summary of the varnam is provided. For a few varn̤ams which were written in a context, she has given the anecdotes as well. This can help the dancer/musician contextualize the varnam to its original situation. Detailed word to word meaning is given for each section of the song. Overall meaning (bhavartham) has been given for each section of the song. The text will be supported with audio recordings of the songs, which will be available for downloading to all those who buy the book.\n\nThe book will be available for purchase in leading book stores from April 10, 2019.
