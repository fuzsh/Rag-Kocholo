        "text": "Announcing a New Open-Access Resource:\n\nIssues 1 and 2 of Music & Musical Performance: An International Journal\n\nWe, the Chief Editors of Music & Musical Performance: An International Journal, are delighted to announce that our journal has now gone online, with two issues full of essays, scholarly articles, and book and recording reviews.\n\nAs its name suggests, Music & Musical Performance is a peer-reviewed journal aiming to shed light on a wide range of topics involving music. It particularly (though not exclusively) welcomes contribution that emphasize the act of making music through performance or composition—and their corollary: the experience of listening to music.\n\nWe welcome submissions from a wide range of authors including scholars, performers, composers, and critics (among others).\n\nIssue 1 consists entirely of a re-launch of articles that appeared in issue 1 (2019) of the short-lived International Journal for Music and Musical Performance. IJSMMP was removed from the Internet, along with many other precious online resources, when the not-for-profit Open Music Library was shut down by ProQuest and Alexander Street, the (for-profit) organizations that had hosted OML and thus IJSMMP.\n\nWe were fortunate to find a new home for our efforts in Digital Commons, and have received great assistance in setting up the new journal from the library system of Florida International University. If you click on the new journal, you will see not just the issue 1 items (from IJSMMP) but also a very full issue 2, including a major set of reflections by soprano Elly Ameling on the performance of art song. We already have enough material for issue 3 and are accepting submissions for issues 4 and 5. We will publish each issue as soon as it is ready. Our general intent is to publish at least one issue a year and to label the issue with the month and year in which it appeared. (There thus will be no “volume” number as such.)\n\nBelow please find the contents of issues 1 and 2, each item given as a hyperlink so you can simply click and read.\n\nM&MP resembles IJSMMP in many ways but is built on a more secure basis. In addition, we have begun to use peer review more regularly than we did with the first two issues. We find it helps us; also, many authors appreciate it they are required by their institution to report which articles or reviews were peer-reviewed.\n\nWe would welcome suggestions for future articles, essays, and reviews. Please get in touch with me or any of the other Chief Editors, or else, if the piece is complete, simply upload it at the journal’s site: https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/mmp/.\n\nAll best,\n\nRob Haskins\n\nfor the Chief Editors, M&MP,\n\nrob.haskins@unh.edu\n\nIssue 1 (September 2022)\n\nArticles\n\nPDFA “Free Artist of Color” in Late-Eighteenth-Century Saint-Domingue: The Life and Times of Minette\n\nBernard Camier\n\nPDF The Other Side of My Heart: Latina Immigrant’s Oral History in Music\n\nLorena Guillén\n\nPDFKinky Friedman and His Influence on Jewish American Music\n\nMara W.
