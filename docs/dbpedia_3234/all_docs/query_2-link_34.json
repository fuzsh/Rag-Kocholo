So I was instrumental to create the different styles of Titles for each of articles which will express the inner meaning of the articles. That had given me a lots of freedom to experiment different kind of styles in Typedesign. Later on few of the design which I had done for the magazine is implemented in digital type design. When I talked about type design I can't forget about that magazine. I belive that it's a turning point of my journey in Type design.
