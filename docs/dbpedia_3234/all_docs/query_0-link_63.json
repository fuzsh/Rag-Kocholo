What do India's opponents look like and what should Rohit Sharma's side watch out for? Dhruva Prasad and VS Aravind explore.\n\n\"Who should be India's No. 4\" is a debate that raged in the build-up and aftermath of the team's 2019 World Cup campaign. Four years have passed since, but the conundrum continues unabated, with the 2023 World Cup also on the horizon.\n\nIndia captain Rohit Sharma had recently said that \"nobody has come and settled themselves in\" for the No. 4 spot. India has tried 11 players at No. 4 in ODIs since the 2019 World Cup, and yet the management, partly due to injuries to key players, seems to be nowhere close to zeroing in on a name.\n\nSportstar's Ayan Acharya and Dhruva Prasad, wrestle with the subject in this installment of Matchpoint Paradox.\n\n#CricketPodcast #Podcast #IndianCricket #CricketNews\n\nCompetitive franchise cricket is no longer a man's world. With the WOMEN'S BIG BASH, the now defunct Kia super league, and the current Hundred putting women's cricket in the spotlight, opportunities for fresh talent to break through and the game to find newer takers are growing by the day. Another addition towards this end is the Women's Caribbean Premier League and the quirky 6ixty tournament currently underway in St Kitts & Nevis.\n\nOne element bringing these developments and India closer is Rajasthan Royals CEO, Jake Lush McCrum. The IPL franchise joins Kolkata Knight Riders as the 2nd Indian franchise to dabble in the CPL, going out as Barbados Royals in this ecosystem.\n\nMcCrum spoke to Sportstar's Shayan Acharya on prioritizing fan experience, what diving into the proposed Women's IPL seems like, and more.\n\n#RajasthanRoyals #WomensCricket #CricketPodcast\n\nIn 1981, India scripted a memorable 138-run victory over England at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai to take a 1-0 lead in the six-Test series.\n\nThe team sheet on both sides had legendary names like Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Ian Botham, Geoff Boycott, and more. There were no centurions in this Test but the match saw four five-wicket hauls and one of those went to Dilip Doshi when he almost singlehandedly took care of the English lineup which batted second.\n\nIn this episode of India's Greatest Cricketing Victories, Sportstar's Vijay Lokapally caught up with the veteran spinner about this match, his playing days, and how far the game has come in India since.

From what this means for the domestic scene, to the standout storyline of MP coach Chandrakant Pandit who fulfilled a long-lasting dream, tune in to this episode for the complete lowdown of the summit clash.\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nMadhya Pradesh wins maiden Ranji Trophy title, beats Mumbai by six wickets in final: https://bit.ly/3a3uBej\n\nChandrakant Pandit: ‘Felt I had to give something back to MP’: https://bit.ly/3ugEw72\n\nChandrakant Pandit's commitment, sincerity impacts everybody around: Jagdale - https://bit.ly/3QWAafb\n\nSame ground, different story for Pandit’s Madhya Pradesh: https://bit.ly/3OR5Osz\n\n#RanjiTrophy | #DomesticCricket | #Cricket | #IndianCricket | #CricketNews\n\nFor a wicketkeeper, taking six catches in your debut Test match is quite an impressive way to get people to sit up and notice you.\n\nSyed Kirmani has always worn his heart on his sleeve and that's brought him accolades and brickbats in equal measure. He was also an important part of a remarkable win India registered against Australia in 1979 in Bombay where Kirmani scored his maiden Test century\n\nIn this installment of India's Greatest Cricketing Wins, the veteran keeper talks about that game, the ups and downs in his career and why talking about his parents always brings tears to his eyes in a candid chat with Sportstar's Vijay Lokapally.\n\nDo listen in.\n\nE01 ft.
