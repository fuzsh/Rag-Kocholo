        "text": "May 21, 2004 22:31 IST\n\nBoard of Control for Cricket in India secretary S K Nair says schemes for providing financial aid to past and present cricketers at all levels are in the pipeline and would be implemented very soon.\n\nParticipating in a function, organized by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, to hand over cheques of Rs. 5000 each to retired Test cricketers and umpires under the monthly pension scheme, he said, \"The BCCI has found ways and means to sell cricket as a product and the Board is determined to channelize it to past and present cricketers at all levels. A scheme for junior cricketers will also be introduced.\"\n\nNoting that 128 past Test players and 26 umpires would benefit by the pension scheme, Nair said, \"The Board had also manifold the payment to the present players on graded payment system, besides the medical scheme. These schemes are unique as for the first time the past cricketers and umpires are recognized and honoured.\"\n\nNair was witness to showering of accolades on BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya for initiating such innovative schemes.\n\nEvery speaker, including former opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth and W V Raman, to name a few, were all praise for the gesture shown by the Board.\n\nSrikkanth said: \"I echo the sentiments expressed by the previous speakers and Nair. However, this a noble gesture to be appreciated.\"\n\nRaman said: \"It is a question of player-friendly attitude of the BCCI of which Dalmiya and Nair are integral part. The BCCI has shown the way for other cricket Boards in the world to emulate.\"\n\nIn all, 14 past Test players from Tamil Nadu, including Cota Ramaswamy, whose whereabouts are unknown to anyone including his family members, and three umpires are beneficiaries of the scheme.\n\nRamaswamy, who played in two Tests against England when India toured in 1936, has been missing since the early 1960s according to his family sources. This is the only case where the amount was returned to the BCCI's overflowing coffers.\n\nSrikkanth (57 Tests, 1981Â—'89), Raman (11, '87-'96), Bharth Arun (2, '86-'87), A G Milkha Singh (4, '59-'61); Robin Singh (1, '88-'89), M Venkataramana (1, '88-'89) and T E Srinivasan (1, '80-'81) received cheques from Nair as also Raghuram Bhat, a Karnataka spinner, who played two Tests.\n\nThree umpires -- K B Ramaswamy and Mohammad Ghouse (each officiated in eight Tests between 1976-'80) and S R Ramachandra Rao (1 Test, 1987) -- also collected their cheques."
