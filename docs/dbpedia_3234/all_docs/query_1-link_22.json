        "text": "Community Involvement:\n\nInteroperability SIG\n\nNomination Statement: In supporting the TOC Alois wants to help to drive interoperability in the continuous delivery space, support building a healthy and growing ecosystem as well as keep aligning with the requirements and challenges of the end user community. His background in standards, community work and open source development provide a solid basis for this role. Currently full-time – and later half-time – situated in Austria allows him to keep a close connection to the European CD community.\n\nAbout the candidate: Alois has been working in the application management market for over ten years. He developed several standards, started the TAG App Delivery in the CNCF as well as the Keptn open source project. The work in Keptn builds on interoperable application lifecycle management event definitions from code creation to retirement from production. He recently got involved in the events SIG in the CDF as it perfectly aligns with the goal he was already pushing with Keptn.\n\nCommunity Involvement:\n\nPart of the Jenkins Meetup group\n\nContributor to Ortelius\n\nNomination Statement: Brad is interested in taking this role as he is a big advocate for open source and DevOps and is trying very hard to kick start the APAC region with open source and CDF. This role would help him achieve that goal.\n\nAbout the candidate: Brad first started hitting the keyboard on an IBM model xt as a kid, where his first programming language was BASIC then moved on through Pacal, Visual Basic, C#, and now a big fan of GoLang. He started his career as a Software Engineer at TripAdvisor and then got into DevOps and moved into Fintech where he led the Cloud Engineering team at Temenos. Brad is an advocate for cloud native and open source technologies. He runs a community group for the CNCF and runs the GitOps working group for Ortelius.\n\nCommunity Involvement:\n\nSpinnaker Contributor\n\ncdCon Speaker\n\nNomination Statement: Gopinath Rebala is an active proponent of Spinnaker and has been part of the Spinnaker community for more than 4 years. In his role as CTO of OpsMx, Gopi helped adopt Spinnaker for continuous delivery in various organizations and scaling Spinnaker for very large deployments. He is currently focused on interoperability of tools in Continuous Delivery and standardization of interactions for adoption at scale. He believes this will enable the usage of machine learning and statistical techniques for improving quality at speed and scale. This overlaps with the work being done by CDF and he can contribute to the development of standards. He is an active member of Spinnaker sigs and started taking an active role in CDF sigs particularly interoperability and best practices.\n\nAbout the candidate: Gopinath Rebala is the CTO of OpsMx, where he has overall responsibility for continuous delivery and data processing architectures to enable machine learning of OpsMx Enterprise for Spinnaker.

I’ve presented at KubeCon about Tekton internal with Christie Wilson, and am currently contributing to Shipwright, built on Tekton.\n\nAbout the candidate: Jason contributes to various container-related projects, and has never heard a joke about his name and the JavaScript Object Notation that didn’t elicit a polite chuckle. He lives in Brooklyn with his wife and kids, and enjoys naps and most cheeses.\n\nCommunity Involvement: Melissa is an international conference speaker and has spoken at various DevOps, Java, and other software development meetup groups. Over the years she has been involved in UNconferences around the world, most notably JCrete in the island of Crete, Greece, and is now part of the organizing team of both JCrete and JAlba in Edinburgh, Scotland. These are informal conferences that serve the purpose of reaching out to the developer community at a more personal level.\n\nHer community-mindedness extends to organizations like DevOxx4Kids. She is involved in the DevOxx4Kids program in Denver, CO, and has volunteered her time for other events like JavaOne4Kids and JCrete4Kids. Her Java Champion and Docker Captain memberships help give her opportunities to teach, share, and inspire fellow practitioners, and she hopes to expand her involvement to the CDF Community as well.\n\nNomination Statement: Given her 20 plus years of development and DevOps experience, Melissa is an ideal candidate to participate in the CDF TOC.
