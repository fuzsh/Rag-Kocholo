Click #TogetherWeCan\n\nWe are living in a world of technological advancements and social media where we often do not get time to know others on a one-to-one basis. We hardly get time to have deeper and meaningful conversations to build long lasting bonds. This #heart2heartconversation begins with this need of connecting with people before taking a deeper dive in various domains of life and career. We all have to juggle with multiple hats in life. The hats of career, health, family, social contribution, travelling to new places, etc. etc. Managing all the hats requires a lot. It needs a lot of hard work, focus, consistency, learning orientation, humility, persistence and more. Manish Biyani is a seasoned entrepreneur leading three businesses. He is the Director of Mobel Furniture with a chain of many showrooms in major cities in eastern part of India including but not limited to Kolkata, Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Siliguri, Imphal, Asansol and Hazaribagh. From opening a 2000 sq ft store more than a decade ago, he has come a long way while leading his team of dedicated people. Now, there are more than 15 stores in various parts of the country, especially in the Eastern part of India. He is also a senior Rotarian who has been contributing to the society through his deep and meaningful work over more than 15 years. He is also a traveller and more. I am privileged to know Manish from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra days when he was a fellow student of Engineering. When I spoke to him after more than two and a half decades, an inspiring story of grit, determination, focus and making contribution to the world that we live in came out in a #heart2heartconversation which I am sure will benefit the viewers. This will also remind us of the need of balancing our time and focus on multiple hats that we all have to manage and, most importantly, it will make you smile and reflect back on the beautiful memories which we all create and cherish. I am humbled to speak with Manish in this serving of a conversation which I am sure you will find meaningful and interesting. #consistency #persistence #entrepreneurship #mentoring #worklifebalnce #family #rotary Rotary International"
