        "text": "Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited is one of the four largest banks in Australia, and the number one bank in New Zealand, serving over 8.5 million retail and business customers, operating in more than 30 markets including Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Region, Asia, UK, Europe and North America.\n\nAs ANZ Bank set out to improve the financial well being and sustainability of customers through its portfolio of services, tools, and insights, it recognized very early on the importance of investing in digital to modernize workloads and differentiate itself from competitors. With their current implementation of Red Hat OpenShift 3.11 approaching end of life, the bank worked with their account team and Red Hat Consulting to develop a roadmap that would enable them to migrate their existing applications to Red Hat OpenShift 4, while minimizing risk and avoiding any major disruption.\n\nTo do this, ANZ Bank used Red Hat Service Interconnect, a solution that enables agile, portable and secure communication across environments. The solution helped the bank to more securely connect applications across environments, enabling developer teams to move them as they were ready, without needing elevated privileges or dependencies on network operations. This resulted in a streamlined migration and improved developer experience, as well as maintaining uninterrupted transactions for the bank’s retail and commercial customers. Digitalizing these workflows has reduced the amount of engineering resources required to complete the project.\n\nING changed the way Australians bank more than 22 years ago by launching the country’s first branchless bank. ING now offers Australians home loans, transactional banking, superannuation, credit cards, personal lending, insurance, and wholesale banking services. Today, ING is Australia’s most recommended bank[1] and fifth largest main financial institution[2]. It’s also Canstar’s Bank of the Year and has been since 2020.\n\nAs a longtime Red Hat customer, ING has used Red Hat solutions to improve automation, drive efficiency and accelerate cloud adoption. Working with Red Hat has allowed ING to accelerate the adoption of a microservices based architecture. ING’s technology department was further faced with the task of integration and operations of traditional and modern cloud based workloads across the bank’s existing ecosystems. Leveraging Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform has supported ING in uplifting its capability that will assist the bank in the adoption of a more efficient hybrid cloud operating environment to drive innovation and address complexity.\n\nSouthern Cross Health Society opened for business in 1961, introducing health insurance to New Zealanders and establishing itself as one of New Zealand’s most trusted brands. Southern Cross was established because its founders believed New Zealanders should have ongoing access to private healthcare options. Over the years, Southern Cross has expanded its community of care and now helps more New Zealanders than ever to look after their health and wellbeing, travel plans, and pets.\n\nOne of the organization’s main objectives was to move away from manual processes and monolithic platforms to provide customers with a better digital experience through online services and mobile applications. They also provide services to their healthcare partners, so centralized integration capabilities are crucial for this purpose.\n\nTo enable this, Southern Cross used a managed service for Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), unlocking access to a modern, microservices platform that enables essential services such as API management and streaming. The fully managed service gave Southern Cross the flexibility and scalability to grow with demand, without having to pump in extra investments or manpower to manage the platform. ARO has also provided huge cost savings for Southern Cross, boosting productivity and reducing the time to market. This has allowed healthcare partners and insurance clients a much-improved experience in handling their insurance policies as most of these processes are now automated.\n\nEstablished in May 2003, a joint venture between the BMW Group and Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd., BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BBA) oversees the research and development, procurement, production, sales, and after-sales services of BMW automobiles in China. BBA is dedicated to providing sustainable premium personal travel services and leads in promoting sustainability across the entire value chain in the Chinese automotive industry.

Leveraging Red Hat's open-source application ecosystem, Southern Asset Management has acquired various software resources, including Red Hat OpenShift, transition from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to Platform as a Service (PaaS). This transition allows the company's developers to focus on business functionality development without the need to address hardware, network, and related hardware and software issues. Additionally, it significantly increased application development efficiency, reduced system maintenance complexity, and enhanced system fault recovery capabilities, providing robust support for the company's in-house construction of a digital/intelligent asset management system.\n\nGuided by the two major national strategies of \"2060 Carbon Neutrality\" and \"Rural Revitalization,\" Chint Anneng actively explores emerging markets and focuses on providing comprehensive solutions for cooperative development, sales, surveying and design, installation, and after-sales operation and maintenance of rooftop photovoltaic systems for rural users. As a household photovoltaic industry company, Chint Anneng has accumulated over 1 million users, with a market share of over 30% in the market.\n\nWith the rapid growth in demand for household photovoltaics, there is a pressing need to enhance Chint Anneng’s digital capabilities in marketing, services, operations, and asset management. The organization then initiated the Chint Anneng Next-Generation Business Operations Platform project to create agile and efficient service capabilities to adapt to rapid business growth and respond swiftly to industry demands – with the goal of expanding globally. It became imperative to adopt a hybrid multi-cloud approach, and collaborating with Red Hat enabled Chint Anneng to facilitate open collaboration between its developers and various cloud vendors, leading the way for innovative development in the photovoltaic sector.\n\nMorgan Stanley has over 80,000 employees worldwide, primarily engaged in investment banking, securities, wealth management, and investment management.

Traditionally focused on providing banking services for micro, small, and medium enterprises, BRI wanted to generate new revenue streams via retail banking and had to adapt to the shifting demands of consumers that were increasingly digital-minded. To attract a younger demographic, BRI launched its BRI mobile banking app (BRImo) in 2019. However, this version of BRImo was unable to be scaled up to keep pace with customer demands.\n\nTo provide fast, efficient, safe and easy-to-access financial services to capture this group of potential customers, BRI turned to Red Hat to modernize its enterprise applications and optimize the BRImo app. The use of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform has allowed BRI to improve the scalability, agility, and responsiveness of BRImo, leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention. These upgrades have led to a 68% YoY user growth for BRImo in 2022.\n\nBank OCBC NISP has adopted Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. Red Hat OpenShift and Ansible Automation are helping increase developer productivity and to help launch products and services on the ONe Mobile application more quickly and scalably. In addition, using Red Hat OpenShift, together with Ansible Automation means Bank OCBC NISP’s IT teams can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time to focus on more high-value activities, which can increase efficiency and productivity. This collaboration helps improve the customer experience for ONe Mobile customers, namely the mobile banking application for Bank OCBC NISP individual customers.\n\nThe ONe Mobile application, which was launched in 2018, is a mobile banking application that helps Bank OCBC NISP's individual customers to grow and manage their finances. As of June 2023, the number of ONe Mobile transactions has increased by 63% and the transaction value has increased by 67% YoY.

Agile methods were adopted company-wide to realize hypothesis-testing business.\n\nIn order to promote agile method correctly rather than self-initiated, Tokio Marine & Nichido selected Red Hat, as their external coach. In expanding agile development structure on a large scale, Tokio Marine & Nichido faced resource issues, which it overcame entering into quasi-agreement with multiple IT vendors and conducting development in a scrum that included a mix of IT vendors and in-house personnel. This has allowed agile methods to expand to 400 people and work on 10 new development projects simultaneously. Through the support of Red Hat Open Innovation Labs, which were designed based on Red Hat's open philosophy, a company culture change involving management and business departments has progressed, contributing significantly to the transformation of the entire group, including local companies overseas.\n\nAgile method is a pillar of Tokio Marine & Nichido's efforts to expand their business domain in order to transform its business model. The company will continue to release agile and high quality products to improve customer satisfaction while providing high quality services in the core insurance business as they have in the past. Also, they believe these products will be a driving force to provide unprecedented services in the pre- and post-insurance areas.\n\nHitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. is a leading manufacturer, distributor and service provider of construction equipment, providing products and solutions worldwide through its global network. In expanding its business, Hitachi Construction Machinery has positioned North America as one of the most important markets, but they faced two challenges – the innovation of the development process within Hitachi Construction Machinery and the shortening development lead time in order to fulfill the local requests. This is because Hitachi Construction Machinery had a mix of legacy and modern systems, and there was a need to radically address many issues in order to promote data connection and data utilization.\n\nHitachi Construction Machinery responded to this challenge by launching the Dealer Network Acceleration (DNA) project to improve operational excellence and dealer experience. To drive this project, they selected Red Hat Open Innovation Labs, which provides organizational learning support to implement innovation quickly and boldly by leveraging digital. The organizational transformation offered by Open Innovation Labs was a deciding factor to adopt Red Hat, as it was important for the business unit to take the lead in implementing innovation to achieve their goals.\n\nExperts from Red Hat Consulting were committed to a result that satisfied each of Hitachi Construction Machinery and it’s subsidiary in Americas, Hitachi Construction Machinery Americas Inc., and worked collaboratively to solve business challenges using Open Innovation Labs' technology and open source methodologies.
