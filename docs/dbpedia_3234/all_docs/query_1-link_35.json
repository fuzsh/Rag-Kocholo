        "text": "I am a tenured Professor of Pathology and Dermatology and a practicing Dermatopathologist with over 15 years of experience. My clinical and research interests include cutaneous adnexal tumors, cutaneous lymphomas, and melanocytic lesions. I have authored/co-authored numerous publications and book chapters, especially in the area of cutaneous adnexal neoplasms. My expertise as diagnostician for cutaneous adnexal tumors is nationally and internationally recognized; therefore, my opinion is often requested in challenging cases.\n\nI was invited to present and chair numerous courses and seminars at national and international meetings and academic institutions, including the meetings of American Society of Dermatopathology (ASDP), International Society of Dermatopathology (ISDP), United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP), College of American Pathologists (CAP), American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP), etc. I am an active member of the American Society of Dermatopathology (ASDP) where I currently serve as the Chair of the Membership Committee. I am also part of the Executive Committee of the International Society of Dermatopathology (ISDP).\n\nI consider myself a passionate teacher and I have been an active educator my entire career. Since 2012, I am the Dermatopathology Fellowship Director and I currently serve as the Chair of Education and Training Committee in the Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. My passion for education was recognized with the 2017 and 2019 Presidentâ€™s Mentorship and Teaching Awards and the 2018 Outstanding Program Director Award. I am also actively involved in the institutional Graduate Medical Education (GME), served as vice-chair and chair of GME Committee and I am currently the chair of the GME Budget Subcommittee."
