        "text": "Founded by Revered Shri Vrajeshji Shastri\n\nAdministered by Shri Girirajji Shastri\n\nJagatguru (Universal Teacher) Shri Vallabhacharji came on earth to promote ancient Indian Vedic Culture, and devotion towards Lord Krishan with true love by path of grace (Pishti Bhakti Marg). Shri Vallabhacharji has shown the entire world the simple path of invaluable devotion. (Path of Grace) Many devotees have felt fulfillment in their lives because they found pleasure in their devotion of Lord Shri Krishna, the supreme master of divine nectar.If a person loves Lord Krishna while keeping raag (attachment), bhoga (utility), and shrinagar(beautification) in mind, no deserving person should remain devoid of love from the Lord. With this, devotees will be graced with spiritual awareness, which will lead to their personal progress and upliftment.\n\nWith pious thought, our revered Shri Vrajesh Kumar Shastri established the Mumbai Shri Gopitnath Spiritual Institute on Shri Vallabhacharyaji’s Birth date in V.S. 2056 A.D. 1999. The purpose of this institute is to promote religion and culture, and to establish a society that does not have much pain and suffering through the devotion of Lord Krishna. Keeping in mind current social problems, the institute will make sure to never discriminate through caste, creed, or social status, and will work on educational, cultural, and health related projects to help those in need.\n\nWith educational projects, they are being carried out in various rural and dalit (backwards) areas by setting up workshops and promoting spiritual upliftment through mythological books. For health projects, the institute has set up various medical camps geared towards regular check ups, eye exams, and blood donation stations. Besides these, if flood or earthquake relief aid is needed, the institute will do it’s best to aid the cause by sheltering poor and lesser children, and giving them a proper education during those times. Besides helping people, the institute is also paying special attention to cows, and helping those that are weak and helpless.\n\nAll the listed community service is being done with the blessings of Vaidyraaj Shri Vithalprasad Shastriji. At the same time there are blessings and inspirations from Shree Vallabhacharyji, ancestry Aacharyas and many Saints as a backbone of the trust.\n\nFuture Plans:\n\nNew construction plans are being made for Shri Gopinath Spiritual Anand Dham. Special attention will be paid to the Tatva Gyan research center, the Shri Gopinath Gyan Mandir, and the publication center.\n\nTrust Introduction:\n\nA gurukul (Sanskrit guru “teacher” or “Master”; kul domain, from kula, “extended family”) is a type of school in India. It is residential in nature, with students living in close proximity to the guru, often within the same house. In a gurukul, students reside together as equals, irrespective of their social standing, and learn daily life lessons from the guru.\n\nThough the Gurukul education system is one of the oldest on Earth, the guru-shishya system existed long before. In this system, students were taught orally, and that knowledge was passed down from generation to generation.\n\nGurukuls, on the other hand, ? ?have existed since the Vedic age. Gurukul were traditional ancient Indian residential school of learning; typically the teacher’s house or a monastery. Upnishads mention many gurukuls, including that of Yagyavalkya, Varuni, and so on. Briguvalli, the famous discourse on Brahman, is mentioned to have taken place in Guru Varuni’s gurukul. Vedic school of thought prescribes an initiation (Upanayanam) to all individuals, including women, before the age of 8 ? ? (or latest by age 12). From initiation until the age of 25 all individuals are prescribed to be students and to remain unmarried.\n\nAt the Gurukuls, the teacher imparted knowledge of religion, scriptures, philosophy, literature, warfare, statecraft, medicine, astrology, art, architecture, logic, grammar, arthashastra (economics and politics), law and mythology. Only students belonging to Brahmin and Kshatriya communities were taught in these gurukuls. However, the advent of Buddhism and Jainism brought fundamental changes in access to education with their democratic character.\n\nThe guru-shishya tradition (parampara) is an allowed tradition in ancient India. The tradition was followed by Vedic thoughts making gurukul one of the earliest forms of public schooling. Education was free (and often limited to the higher castes), but students from well-to-do families paid gurudakshina, a voluntary contribution after the completion of their studies. Mahatma Gandhi, father of India, once said to have described the traditional educational system as a beautiful tree that was destroyed during the British rule.\n\nThis beautiful tree of traditional education system has to be expanded with it branches and to do the same the Founder of the Charitable Trust Pujya Shree Vrajeshkumar Shastri & President Pujya Shree Giriraj Shastri are working hard on it.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nThe Indian education system is generally marks-based -- a system which has led to cases to of depression and suicides among students. However, some experiments have been made to do away with this system.\n\nOutdoor Education in India\n\nOutdoor education is relatively new to schools In India, though it is quite well established abroad. Acceptance is slowly increasing, with a few schools advocating for outbound adventure based programmes to enhance students’ personal growth through experiential learning, and increase awareness about various subjects like the environment, ecology, wildlife, history, archeology, geography and adventure sports.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, Shri Giriraj Shastriji, with vast experience of conducting educational camps, imparting mythological, psychological, spiritual, motivational, life-oriented social and yoga knowledge in current scenario lead to the birth of an idea of imparting good education to all, especially to the needy in traditional format of gurukul but teaching latest subjects mixed with traditional learning’s.\n\nThis very thought shows the birth of a trust known as “SHREE GOPINATH ADYATMIC SANSTHAN” Education at SHREE GOPINATH ADYATMIC SANSTHAN will have broader significance. Education will no longer be a way to gather knowledge but to enrich one’s inner conscience. It will impart a way whereby one imparts knowledge through learning, gathering, and discussing information and skills during the course of life. There will be an array of educational opportunity at the informal level as well as formal level. Education -- which up until now has been described as a basic human right since 1952 and has become a money dwelling unit but with advent of “Shree Gopinath Adhyatmic Sansthan” education -- will actually become a human right for the economically backward.\n\nThe history of education in India has its roots in the ancient ages. The system of Indian education has traveled a long way. Besides the scientific mode of teaching, the relation of master-students will be upheld at “Shree Gopinath Adhyatmic Sansthan”.\n\nAt Shree Gopinath Adhyatmic Trust, education will be taught on a one-on-one basis, making students upright, confident, and self-reliant. It will be ensured that students at “Shree Gopinath Adhyatmic Sansthan” will not only be imparted with knowledge of all the current fields, such as current school learning, but will be mixed with traditional mind space with the latest technology, strict administration, and useful vocational thoughts. Most importantly, education will be imparted in guru-shishya style, perhaps the way of future education.\n\nGurukuls used to be supported by public donations and locals, but now it turns to professionals for the administrative help locals once used to give. Now, gurukuls will still welcome public donations,but also help from the government.\n\nApart from schooling, “Shree Gopinath Adhyatmic Sansthan” ( Charitable Trust) also plans to undertake other activities such as Gaushala, building a sadhna Hall, a library, a community hall, a special section for meditation, yoga execrise & yagna."
