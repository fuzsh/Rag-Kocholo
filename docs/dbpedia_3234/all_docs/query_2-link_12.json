        "text": "Tata Medical Center, a state-of-the-art total comprehensive cancer care center, will host ‘Legends for Hope’ on Saturday 18th November 2017 in association with the Calcutta Cricket and Football Club (CC&FC). The musical evening will see a galaxy of sports stars including Sunil Gavaskar, Bishan Singh Bedi, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Ravi Shastri, Sourav Ganguly, Jhulan Goswami, Mithali Raj, Leander Paes and Virat Kohli come together to help raise funds for the underprivileged children battling cancer at the Tata Medical Center in Kolkata. Also gracing the occasion will be yesteryears’ cricket legends C.D. Gopinath and Madhav Apte who played for India in the 1950s. This event will help raise funds to extend cancer care to the underprivileged patients at the Center.\n\nThe association with CC&FC will mark 225 glorious years of cricket in the presence of eminent cricketers who have pledged their support for the cause. As part of their support, the cricketers will also share personal stories and anecdotes that changed their lives and encourage the audience to come forward and donate.\n\n‘Legends for Hope’ will pay tribute to art, artists, and musical enthusiasts at the CC&FC. The evening will witness a musical extravaganza with performances from The Shillong Choir and Humsufi band. Music maestro Shantanu Moitra, known for his perfect amalgamation of classic and folk music, will present an exclusive musical score for the Tata Medical Center film which will be screened at the event. While renowned commentators Charu Sharma and Boria Majumdar will interact with some of the greatest sports luminaries, internationally acclaimed sand artist Rahul Arya will also create magic with his mesmerizing creation at the event. An anthem titled ‘Oh When The Legends Go Marching In” sung by Usha Uthup will be played across radio stations to create buzz around the event.\n\nEnvisioned by Ms. Geeta Gopalakrishnan, Director – Donor Relations, Tata Medical Center, ‘Legends for Hope’ is an experience designed to reach out to the larger society, and raise funds for underprivileged cancer patients. Commenting on the unique vision behind this, Ms. Gopalakrishnan said, “Imagine the panorama of Indian cricket unfolding. From the oldest living legends like C.D. Gopinath and Madhav Apte to Virat Kohli and the men in blue regaling us with the “aha” moments in their illustrious career. This will create an “aha” moment for Tata Medical Center. The completion of the much-needed expansion of the hospital will bring hope to so many in their battle against cancer. We urge supporters to join us in our efforts to lend a compassionate and uplifting hand to the not-so-fortunate suffering from this disease.”\n\nCommenting on the fund-raiser evening, Dr. Mammen Chandy, Director, Tata Medical Center, said, “Tata Medical Center has been consistently providing the most modern treatment modalities to all types of cancer patients, since May, 2011. We are extremely honored to be working in tandem with all our supporters and we have witnessed their relentless efforts to battle cancer. I firmly believe that each contribution counts and hope that together we can support those affected by this life-threatening disease.”\n\nTalking about this unique celebration at CC&FC, Mr. Arun Lal, Former Indian Cricketer and President, CC & FC, commented, “It’s a matter of pride for us as we cherish the 225 years of our club’s glorious past. Founded in 1792, CC & FC is the oldest cricket club of India and the second oldest in the world. In celebrating 225 years of cricket in India, we as a club, are proud to be associated with Tata Medical Center. Being a cancer survivor myself, I cannot thank Tata Medical Center enough for all the efforts they make towards providing care and treatment for cancer patients. At a personal level, it is a privilege for me to be a part of this awareness drive.”\n\nEstablished in Kolkata in 2011, The Tata Medical Center has treated more than 80,000 patients till date. This state-of-the-art hospital was set up with a strategic alliance and assistance from the Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, which is one of the premier national institutions for cancer prevention, treatment, education, and research with more than 75 years of experience. It has been built on carefully landscaped grounds to emphasize the holistic approach in its crusade against cancer.\n\nTata Steel and Samsung are the principal supporter of ‘Legends for Hope. Among the other goodwill donors who are supporting the event, Anjan Chatterjee, founder of Speciality Restaurants Limited has espoused the cause in a special way.\n\nTata Medical Center, the world class, not-for-profit cancer treatment facility stands as a beacon of hope for the patients in this region with over half of the beds being reserved for the treatment and care of underprivileged patients."
