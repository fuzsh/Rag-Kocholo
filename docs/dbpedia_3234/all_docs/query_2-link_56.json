        "text": "Wondering how to apply for a temporary resident visa to Mexico as a person of colour in a ‚Äúthird world country‚Äù (Kenya) as a citizen of a different third world country (India)? Buckle up! This guide will lay out the dos and donts, with detailed instructions on how best to avoid rejection. Failing that, it will remind you your place in the world.\n\nShed your self-respect\n\nThis is the most important step in this (and any) visa application process. Find a small cardboard box (A dirty shoebox will do) and place your self-respect and expectations of civility and equality in it. If it‚Äôs been a while since your last visa application, your self-respect may have regrown and it may be hard to fit it in the box. You can reclaim your self-respect from the box when the visa process is done, but it‚Äôs best if you just throw away the box.\n\nRead the visa rules carefully\n\nGo to the consulate website and read the visa page. Take care to note the requirements for your type of visa. In case of the temporary resident visa, the consulate requires\n\nProof of residency in the country you‚Äôre applying from\n\nBank account statements for the last six months\n\nDouble-check with the consulate\n\nJust to be sure you don‚Äôt get your hopes up of getting a visa after reviewing the website, contact the consulate, stating the visa you‚Äôre interested in and confirming the documents you plan to apply with. This will almost certainly be met with an automated reply linking you to the very website you got all the information from but if you‚Äôre lucky, you might get a passive-aggressive response from a human linking you to the website instead! üòç\n\nThis is a good reminder to temper your expectations and practise stoicism - remember, nothing in this world is for sure, not least the possibility of your getting a visa despite meeting all the requirements.\n\nYou want privacy? What are you, a terrorist?!\n\nTake a stab in the dark, and send an email to the consulate with all your documents and ask if they‚Äôre in order. You may not know who (or how many people) have access to the email, but it doesn‚Äôt matter - people who have nothing to hide don‚Äôt expect their bank statements and the personal transactions they contain to be private. Privacy is for other people who distinctly don‚Äôt look like you.\n\nExpect the unexpected\n\nYou didn‚Äôt think that the requirements you saw on the website would be everything, did you? No, of course not. You know better than that - There are always hidden requirements! It would be no fun if consulates listed out all of them on their websites or responded to your emails/phone calls with the real list of requirements.\n\nI followed the requirements on the website and emailed the consulate a bank statement for the last six months, generated by the online statement generation tool of my international bank (Standard Chartered) only to be told that I need to submit a statement for the last twelve months. Surprise!\n\nWhat if you switched banks eight months ago and cannot obtain a bank statement from your previous bank? No problem, the consulate has you covered - Just submit a letter from your employer instead, as well as your payslips for the last six months. Just to be sure that you‚Äôre not making up an entire organization, its payroll system, contact information, and address, make sure to include the passport bio-data page of the person who signs the letter confirming that you work for the organization. Easy peasy!\n\nStrengthen your bond with your boss\n\nYou may not have read this in your run-of-the-mill ‚ÄúHow to be a manager‚Äù book, but the true sign of a healthy relationship with your manager is having a copy of their passport bio-data page! After all, nothing says ‚ÄúI trust you‚Äù than sharing personal IDs with your reports.\n\nI reached out to my boss and explained my predicament and how I was running out of time before some upcoming travel plans that would take me out of Kenya, and in the course of a day, she shared a signed letter with the organization letterhead stating my job role and tenure at the org, as well as my salary and her passport details. She also included a photo of passport bio-data page! In unrelated news, my current role at Maisha Meds has been the longest of my career.\n\nEmbrace radical candour\n\nThink you‚Äôre an open book? Consulates have a new free service to aid you in your journey towards simple, transparent living - Doxxing your salary!\n\nRemember that signed letter from my boss, with the organization letterhead? It contained an email. A public-facing email address that we share with external parties, which forwards all emails to five people across the org. See where I‚Äôm going with this?\n\nTo make sure that I did not make up an organization, payslips from the org, a signed letter from my boss and a photo of her passport, the consulate decided to contact that public email address. It included my payslips for the last six months in the very first email and asked for verification.\n\nUnderstandable, really. You can never be too sure of the legitimacy of documents these days.\n\nEncryption, you say? Stamps and signatures on paper are the true sign of security\n\nSpeaking of legitimate documents, don‚Äôt forget to get your bank statements and your payslips doodled on beautified bedazzled certified by professionals - bank managers and your org‚Äôs finance team respectively. Everyone knows that even a truly hardened criminal who has found a way to forge the bio-data page of a passport and set up a fake organization website and Google Workspace to intercept emails sent to its public-facing email address to confirm the legitimacy of their payslips cannot crack the certification rubberstamps of a bank.\n\nTo the consulate‚Äôs credit, it always referred to ‚Äúcertified bank statements‚Äù and ‚Äúcertified payslips‚Äù, but I did not pick up on that until it was explicitly flagged, in the seventh round of correspondence with the consulate. No problem though, all it took was a visit to a bank branch and reaching out to my very accommodating mostly-remote colleague who, recognizing the limited time I had to get a visa before my travel, invited me to drop by their house with printouts of my payslips so they could quickly sign the documents. Download a scanner app, take photos of a lot of pages adorned with signatures and stamps and voil√†, certification complete!\n\nPractise patience\n\nSo you‚Äôve submitted all your documents, and the consulate has finally confirmed that they‚Äôre all in order, but there has been radio silence since then. Time for another reminder that the only thing you can control in this world is your mind (and some of us need medication to have some semblance of control). Never mind that it has been more than a month since you established contact with the consulate. Or that you only have two weeks before your travel plans that will keep you out of the country for a month.\n\nDon‚Äôt even think about emailing the consulate informing them that you don‚Äôt live in Nairobi, the city the consulate is located in, and that you would appreciate their accommodating a visa appointment before your upcoming travel plans. Not unless you want a generic response with a link and a quote from the website stating that the processing of documents can take up to 10 days from the submission of all documents. This time, the word on the website is the law.\n\nKnow your priorities\n\nWhat would you do if a consulate emails you at 1pm informing you that your appointment had been scheduled for 9am the following day? If you answered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd emphatically accept and show up the next day, because I‚Äôd put the rest of my life on hold for the visa appointment anyway‚Äù, you are clearly a person who has accepted your place in the world. I had not, especially as I had already travelled to Rwanda at the time, so I replied that ‚Äú9am tomorrow would not work for me‚Äù and requested an appointment at the end of March, when I expected to be in Nairobi for a few days.\n\nAre we sure that samsara is not about obtaining a visa?\n\nMaybe Lumbini had restrictive visa policies?\n\nAfter following up a second time, the consulate wrote back to inform me that my visa appointment had been scheduled for the first week of April. You‚Äôd think seeking an appointment a full 25+ days in advance for the end of March would ensure that appointments were still open and you‚Äôd be able to get the date that works best for you (hard to imagine a clamour among folks in Kenya to travel to Mexico), but it is not your allotment in life to question the decisions beyond your control. Well, maybe sometimes it is, as I did, asking if the consulate could accommodate my preference for end of March. It worked - I was informed that my appointment had been set for the date I requested.\n\nWas it that simple, you ask? No, of course not. The consulate informed me that because my visa appointment would be a full month after the date it had initially set for me, I would need to submit fresh bank statements and payslips. All certified of course.\n\nWill this ever end?\n\nWe‚Äôre getting there, I promise. Long story short, I made it to my appointment with freshly signed and stamped payslips and bank statements, passport copies, signed letter from my employer (needed a new one, just in case I‚Äôd been fired in the month since I‚Äôd last emailed the consulate), visa application form, passport photos in a specific dimension (which weren‚Äôt needed in the end because a digital photo was taken at the consulate instead).\n\nAfter two in-person visits to the consulate and additional documents to prove my ‚Äúeconomic solvency‚Äù, I finally got a shiny temporary resident visa sticker in my passport!\n\nI hope I‚Äôve demonstrated how easy it is to apply for this visa! All it takes is a little bit of patience.\n\nHappy to share that I‚Äôm working on Jodi Sudoku, an open-source (AGPLv3), Sudoku progressive web app with the goal of implementing multiplayer support using WebRTC!\n\nI‚Äôve been following the adoption of WebRTC (now supported on all major platforms except Safari, infamous for dragging its feet) and the decentralized web for years, but haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to work with it, so I decided to use it in a hobby project.\n\nFrontend\n\nThe frontend code uses the standard React + Typescript setup, with React Router and Redux. So far, the web app features\n\nStarting a new game with a level of difficulty of your choice\n\nKeyboard and mouse/touch input\n\nChanging the mode of entering values into cells - Choose a digit first, and then click a cell to enter the digit, or vice versa\n\nResponsive cross-platform layout, tested on Firefox and Chrome (desktop and mobile)\n\nUndo and redo using redux store history\n\nI‚Äôm a big fan of internationalization and supporting regional languages, so the basic one-player implementation currently supports Kannada, English and Polish using react-i18n.\n\nBackend\n\nThe backend is more esoteric - I‚Äôm interested in using Rails + WebSockets. While I primarily wear the Android hat at work, our backend is built with Rails (a framework I had not worked with before) and I‚Äôm interested in improving my Rails fu through this project and contributing more than just the occasional pull request. Rails has a thin wrapper over WebSockets called Action Cable, and I‚Äôm curious to see how it fares compared to Node ( + socket.io), which seems to be the internet‚Äôs go-to recommendation for scalable WebSockets. WebSockets is a great way to achieve peer discovery (your browser tab discovering peers and finding a way to establish a direct connection despite NAT traversal), required for WebRTC. If there‚Äôs a lot of traffic and Action Cable/Rails struggles under the load, I‚Äôm aware I might need to swap out Action Cable for Node someday, but I think the Rails experimentation will be worth it. Besides, Node feels like home turf and it‚Äôll be fun to try something different :)\n\nMultiplayer\n\nWhat‚Äôs with the idea of multiplayer Sudoku, you ask? Is there any interest in multiplayer Sudoku? I‚Äôm not sure - I found a few multiplayer games on different app stores, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a big community. This project is honestly just an excuse to find a way to play Sudoku with my mum - Playing Sudoku together is a ritual whenever I‚Äôm in Bangalore. With mugs of basil and ginger tea after dinner, and armed with pens at the kitchen table, we pair up (Jodi (‡≤ú‡≥ã‡≤°‡≤ø) is the Kannada word for ‚Äúpair‚Äù) on solving the Sudoku puzzle in the daily newspaper (remember those?), trying to get as many digits as possible but also explaining to each other how we ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù the right digits. I miss that, and I see no reason why that should stop when I‚Äôm not in Bangalore :) I‚Äôd be happy if others find it useful as well.\n\nThe idea is to implement URL-based discovery of peers. Like Jitsi calls, users who open the same link will be able to connect to the server using WebSockets, receive information from the server on the users in the ‚Äúroom‚Äù, and then establish browser-to-browser WebRTC peer connections, making the server connection theoretically unnecessary after that point.\n\nI‚Äôm thinking of building different multiplayer modes\n\nCooperative: all players in a room collaboratively solve the same puzzle together\n\nChallenge (same puzzle): all players in a room individually solve the same puzzle, only aware of the number of empty/filled cells of other players.\n\nChallenge (puzzle of same difficulty): All players in a room solve different puzzles of the same difficulty level, only aware of the number of empty/filled cells of other players. Could be fun to also add a ‚ÄúPeek player‚Äôs board‚Äù feature\n\nTime challenge? Turn-based games? Some dastardly variant of Sudoku?\n\nQ: Privacy and fault tolerance\n\nI‚Äôve encountered a lot of flaky internet connections and I‚Äôd like Jodi Sudoku to be tolerant of and handle edge cases related to flaky connections, users having to refresh their tabs, abrupt drop-offs etc. Given that exploring WebRTC and peer-to-peer systems is one of the goals, it‚Äôs imperative that the server know as little as possible about users, rooms or the type and state of the game in a room.\n\nIf the server knows nothing about the state of the game in a room, who is the source of truth in case of failure? Should all players in a room store the game state locally (in the browser local/session storage), and send the most recent state (via WebRTC) to any player who re/joins a room? What happens if two players disagree on the most recent state of the game? Should rooms have a leader who is responsible for storing the game state and sharing it with users who enter the room? What happens if the leader‚Äôs connection goes down? I have struggled to square the two seemingly contradictory goals of privacy/decentralization, and maintaining a source of truth for fault recovery, and decided to move forward with making the server aware of users, rooms, and game states. Please reach out if you have any suggestions that would keep the server out of the loop after peer discovery.\n\nMy current approach is:\n\nPeer discovery\n\nAbbi enters a room (a room is identified by the link, i.e, judisudoku.app/some-room)\n\nAbbi establishes a WebSocket connection with the server.\n\nAbbi receives the list of users in the room via WebSocket. The list does not have anyone except Abbi. The WebSocket connection with the server is kept open.\n\nIlana enters the room, connects to the server and receives the list of users. The WebSocket connection with the server is kept open.\n\nAbbi and Ilana use a STUN server, bypass their NAT, and establish a peer-to-peer connection.\n\nGameplay\n\nAbbi and Ilana begin a cooperative game, notifying each other via WebRTC and notifying the server via WebSocket.\n\nAbbi and Ilana send messages directly to each other via WebRTC when they enter values into cells. They would also need to passively notify the server of the state changes via WebSocket\n\nThe server passively stores the game state, doing nothing with it.\n\nNew player/rejoin\n\nJaime joins the game late, and is announced to the other users by the server (the updated list of users is shared) via WebSocket\n\nThe server shares the latest state of the game to Jaime via WebSocket\n\nOnce connected to the other users via WebRTC p2p connections, Jaime follows step 7 to participate in the game.\n\nUsing the server as the single source of truth allows users who join a game midway or experience connection issues and rejoin the game to continue the (collaborative) game from the latest state (if other users have made changes). Other multiplayer modes may need to handle failure/rejoin scenarios differently.\n\nNext steps\n\nI realise I‚Äôve defined a lot of lofty technical ambitions for a simple Sudoku webapp, and I‚Äôd like to take this one step at a time. I‚Äôm planning to make small releases to keep up my motivation and get feedback from my target demographic of one - When it comes to hobby projects, I tend to be very excited during the design phase and in the early days of implementation, and lose interest and move on to the next shiny puzzle that needs solving when the problem is more or less ‚Äúsolved‚Äù in my head :)\n\nThe next release will have peer discovery and cooperative game mode.\n\nFor the first time in ten years, I marked one whole year (and counting) living in the same country thanks to Covid, and while I‚Äôve enjoyed liberties in Kenya (open restaurants, only one major lockdown and few restrictions, few cases until recently) that many around the world are still waiting to get back, I find myself longing to escape to Europe.\n\nOf course, the Europe in my mind is completely untouched by Covid, there are no restrictions, all art spaces are active, you can drink a beer by the river, it‚Äôs springtime and sunny, and you can travel as you please, because that‚Äôs how I last saw it :)\n\nTrigger warning: Privileged person whining about the hardships of others\n\nThe relentlessness of Kenyan inequality can be hard to bear at times - I‚Äôve been trying to explore the streets of Kisumu by bike, venturing into neighbourhoods and streets I don‚Äôt usually take. Cycling by the lake wearing my $30 helmet and seeing parts of people‚Äôs houses flooded after heavy rains, and kids collecting water from filthy ditches or the lake in distinct yellow jerry cans while someone else washes their motorbike a few metres away makes me want to give up.\n\nYou‚Äôd think India would‚Äôve inured me to the injustices of poverty and poor infrastructure, but I‚Äôve realised India is quite good at ghettoising its poor, politely tucking them away in long-forgotten parts of towns and cities that are avoided by anyone who can afford to do so, certainly politicians. Or perhaps it‚Äôs more accurate to say the wealthy have managed to outspend, gentrify and shut out the poor from ‚Äútheir‚Äù neighbourhoods. The segregation seems less stark to me here in Kenya.\n\nA few days after I moved into my apartment, someone rang the doorbell - It was a shy young woman, probably in her late teens. She seemed very uncomfortable and struggled to say, ‚ÄúI would be grateful to you if I could have any work to do in your house - cleaning the floor, and doing your dishes and laundry?‚Äù.\n\nWhat was I to say? It looks like it‚Äôs common to have housekeepers in Kenya, but it makes me very uncomfortable, not just because of the risks of catching Covid and the dubious ethics of paying someone to clean up after me, but also I get nervous at the very thought of strangers coming into my private space and having nowhere to hide while they‚Äôre around, possibly for hours (The joys of living with anxiety!). With a lot of guilt and fully aware that I might be cutting off an opportunity for her to make a few hundred Kenyan shillings a week, I declined.\n\nSuch moral conundrums are an everyday occurrence - Last month, I stepped out to get some bananas from a nearby supermarket, and as I walked past an empty plot, I saw a woman sitting at a small folding table with no shade, selling eggs, fried meat and bananas. A child played in the dirt nearby. The sun was setting after a hot day, and the bananas were well on their way to brown. I felt torn - I had stepped out just to get bananas, and I could support the woman and her child by buying bananas from her knowing that the bananas would go bad within a day, or go to the supermarket and buy less ripe ones. I kept walking (with only a tiny bit of hyperventilating), but it was a tough choice. Everyday, very real tests of Kant‚Äôs categorial imperative take their toll. All the bananas I‚Äôve bought since then have been from her though (and the nearly brown bananas must have just been due to a bad day - the bananas have been great since then)! :)\n\nIs it possible to respect your own values and preferences and still find a way to help others that doesn‚Äôt involve paying for things or services you don‚Äôt need, or simply handing people a wad of cash?\n\nI know it‚Äôs pure escapism, but I‚Äôm craving a respite from guilt for a bit. It would be a dream to be in a place where there might still be plenty of inequality but not the kind that leads to extreme starvation or deprives people of basic infrastructure or access to healthcare. Where the crunch of a snail on a bike path getting crushed under my bike wheels despite my best efforts to avoid it is the only source of guilt pangs. Where I‚Äôm not constantly aware of my privilege.\n\nI never thought I‚Äôd think fondly of places where, among many xenophobic incidents, someone called me a terrorist, pointed at my blinking red bike light and made the gesture of a bomb blast :D"
