        "text": "Runners-up to The Parkway's inaugural Bluegrass Battle of the Bands!\n\nA little bit country, a little bit rock & roll -- The Gated Community is a guaranteed good time. Folk rock with a theatrical bent. Music that will have your toes tapping and put a big ol' grin on your face. In a town full of stellar Americana musicians, The Gated Community has distinguished itself as one of Minneapolis' best.\n\nThe band describes themselves as, \"A countryish, bluegrassish band that takes inspiration from all deities. Our repertoire is almost completely original, but also includes a large number of heavily reworked covers — our hope, for legal reasons, is that you won’t be able to tell the difference. The songs address the four universal, Platonic themes of love, art, politics, and science. The instrumentation of the band is eclectic, sometimes accenting the electrical, sometimes the mechanical, sometimes the petrochemical. As Phil Nussbaum once very aptly said, 'The Gated Community. They live where you can’t go.' But we’d still like to take you home with us.\"\n\nThe Gated Community has released three CDs: Power to My Friends (2010), We Can Do Anything (2015), and Country Hymn (2016).\n\nBand members include : Sumanth Gopinath, Teresa Gowan, Rosie Harris, Beth Hartman, Paul Hatlelid, Cody Johnson, and Nate Knutson."
