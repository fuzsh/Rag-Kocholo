Can you put the right number?\n\nOh man I should have picked up Chandni today as I picked up some 18 LPs today and all previous old.pressing. if any of you looking for old collections let me know as I got to know about an uncle in Bangalore who has a shop.full of records in good condition properly.packed. he has collections of Rafi, Lata, Shammi, Amitabh, Rajesh khanna and all\n\nHello rajivaryan 1984 , your uncle contact details ?? please\n\nWhile surfing Amazon saw a new release entitled Together presented by Sony . Placed order and got it . This vinyl weighs 180 gms and spins at 33rpm. The vinyl is good with a nice stereo separation. Previously I bought a vinyl of the Hindi movie Sholay but was not satisfied. But this vinyl is better than what I bought previously. The vinyl records Tabla jugalbandi by ustad Allarakha and ustad Zakir Hussain. I had this in two different formats, cassette and CD but I prefer the vinyl. Actually for some days I had been searching for new vinyls , read about the new releases and even sent messages to our FMs. Sholay disappointed me and I think the EP of the same movie sounds better. But Together helps me to gather enthusiasm to buy some more newly pressed vinyls.\n\nI don't have any connection with the Amazon . I am writing here for those who are yet to buy new vinyls.\n\nI picked one on Amazon today and although this is only my 2nd LP I am truly amazed by the presentation. Does anyone know if the source is analog or digital master. Since it is pressed in 2018, one would guess it is digital, but just want to confirm.\n\nWell you can try out Tangya Records. It is a venture into vinyl manufacturing by music aficionados and they have a few good ones with attention being paid to the quality, the mastering and the cover art. I have got all the three records i.e Colonial Cousins, Indian Ocean and Abida Parveen they have released and by far they are amongst the best out there.\n\nWhere can in ebuy them?\n\nI picked one on Amazon today and although this is only my 2nd LP I am truly amazed by the presentation.

Finally after 4 months of lockdown we have got the test press of Kandisa...Sounds Great!!!\n\nSending you all some videos....we have got tremendous response for the album and you would be amazed by the artwork which we shall release at a later stage. Incase you wish to prebook then pls message me on 9819537755. Kindly ignore if u have already placed your booking. Please note there is no payment required for pre booking.\n\nThanks\n\nTeam Tanagya\n\nAn update from Tanagya Records on the Indian Ocean album.\n\nDear friends\n\nJust an update.

I regret I did not buy more than 1 copy of the CD when it was available.\n\nYa , as per Kaushik , the test pressing has come out great....\n\nIt seems that the vinyl release for Indian recordings i.e film music reissue or some infrequent classical releases have completely dried up. Sony DADC , T Series or Universal none are releasing anything new.\n\nOnly vinyl coming out are the ultra limited issues from the private houses.\n\nSo is this somewhere the end of the road for Indian music on vinyl ..... Any thoughts or insight..\n\nOh man I should have picked up Chandni today as I picked up some 18 LPs today and all previous old.pressing. if any of you looking for old collections let me know as I got to know about an uncle in Bangalore who has a shop.full of records in good condition properly.packed. he has collections of Rafi, Lata, Shammi, Amitabh, Rajesh khanna and all\n\nContact no please\n\nOh man I should have picked up Chandni today as I picked up some 18 LPs today and all previous old.pressing. if any of you looking for old collections let me know as I got to know about an uncle in Bangalore who has a shop.full of records in good condition properly.packed. he has collections of Rafi, Lata, Shammi, Amitabh, Rajesh khanna and all\n\ncontact number plz"
