        "text": "Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, is a Professor in Residence in the Department Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Bioengineering, and he is an attending neuroradiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. He is the Director of the Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Disease (CIND) based at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. He also directs the Neural Connectivity Laboratory (NCL) at UCSF China Basin.\n\nDr. Mukherjee received his PhD in Neuroscience from Rockefeller University, New York in 1994 and his MD from Cornell University, New York, in 1995. He completed his internship in Internal Medicine at New York Hospital - Cornell Medical Center, followed by a residency in Radiology and fellowship in Neuroradiology at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis, Missouri, completed in 2002.\n\nDr. Mukherjeeâ€™s primary clinical research is the study of neurodevelopmental disorders and traumatic brain injury (TBI) using advanced MRI. His research has been focused on technical development, neuroscience and clinical applications of advanced imaging methods for mapping structure and function of the human brain, especially diffusion MRI, which is a popular technique for assessing the development and integrity of white matter and for mapping axonal fiber pathways.\n\nDr. Mukherjee has served as Principal Investigator or Co-Principal Investigator for several NIH grants. His work has also been funded by grants from the Dept. of Defense, the Simons Foundation, McDonnell Foundation, Dana Foundation, Wallace Research Foundation, GE Healthcare and the GE-NFL Head Health Initiative. He has published over 80 peer-reviewed papers.\n\nExpertise:\n\nRadiology, Neuroradiology, Pediatric Neuroradiology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Computational Neuroscience\n\nSpecialty:\n\nNeuroradiology, traumatic brain injury (TBI), neurodevelopmental disorders\n\nProfessional Interests:\n\nBrain development, computational neuroscience, connectomics, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), epilepsy, functional MRI (fMRI), machine learning, magnetoencephalography (MEG), pediatric neuroradiology, traumatic brain injury (TBI), ultra-high field MRI, white matter tractography"
