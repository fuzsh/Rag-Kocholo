        "text": "Pitest (aka PIT) is a state of the art mutation testing system for Java and the JVM.\n\nRead all about it at https://pitest.org\n\n1.16.1\n\n#1329 Prevent version clashes with aggregate goal when plugins use jackson\n\n1.16.0\n\n#1311 - Include unmodifiable collections stored directly to fields in the +funmodifiablecollection filter for defensive code\n\n#1319 - Use environment variables from surefire config\n\n#1322 - Automatically add -ea to enable assertions\n\n#1321 - Expand BuildVerifier interface\n\nApi change in #1321 is backwards compatible, but plugins written against 1.16.0 may not work with earlier versions.\n\n1.15.8\n\n#1310 Filter mutations to Collections.unmodifiable*\n\n#1309 Replace fields in argLines imported from surefire config\n\n#1308 Bump maven vcs versions\n\nThe filtering for #1310 is off by default. To activate it add the filter string +funmodifiablecollection.\n\n1309 adds a new maven property parseSurefireArgLine. This is set to true by default, but surefire argline parsing can now be disabled by setting it to false.\n\n1.15.7\n\n#1305 Coverage not recorded for code in packages name com.sun*\n\nA filter intended to pickup legacy JDK classes in the \"com.sun.*\" package was missing a ', resulting in no code coverage being registered if the code under test happened to be in a package starting with \"sun\".\n\n1.15.6\n\n#1295 temporarily remove dynamic call tracking\n\nInvoke dynamic call tracking for static initializer code will be reintroduced when additional logic to suppress mutation filtering for delayed execution code has been implemented.\n\n1.15.5\n\n#1292 Arg lines taken from surefire config do not have properties replaced\n\n1.15.4\n\n#1288 - New extension point to allow custom coverage export formats\n\n#1289 - Parse argline configuration from surefire configuration\n\n#1274 Follow invoke dynamic calls when detecting static initializer only methods\n\nNote, maven users who have previously needed to duplicate argline parameters between surefire and pitest's jvmArgs and argline parameters may need to adjust their configuration when upgrading. Entries supplied to surefire will now automatically be added to pitest.\n\n1.15.3\n\n#1271 - Double check thread status before marking minion as dead\n\n1.15.2\n\n#1268 - Filter Lombok NonNull checks\n\n#1267 - Expand test api to allow reporting of errors during test scanning\n\n#1267 will ensure that previously hidden errors encountered by the JUnit5 plugin will now be reported. This is a backwards compatible api change. It will have no effect until the JUnit5 plugin is updated to use the expanded api. The updated plugin will not be compatible with earlier versions of pitest.\n\n1.15.1\n\n#1260 Upgrade to ASM 9.6 for Java 22 support\n\n#1261 Do not error on pitest history files < 1.15.0\n\n1.15.0\n\n#1253 suppress coverage stats when history test reduction enabled\n\n#1252 add extrafeatures param for maven to allow features to be added on commandline without overwriting existing list\n\n#1251 expand history interfaces (breaking change)\n\n#1250 improve error message when failing to parse feature strings\n\n#1248 performance tweak - delay test class identification\n\n#1247 legacy code removal\n\nAs a result of the breaking api changes in #1251, the arcmutate kotlin plugin should be upgraded to 1.1.0 when upgrading to pitest 1.15.0\n\n1.14.4\n\n#1246 Priotitise previous killing test when using history files\n\n1.14.3\n\n#1239 Support comma separated excludedGroups (thanks @johnathana)\n\n#1243 Explicitly order classpath in history file to ensure consistency between runs\n\n#1245 Prevent confusing logging of dummy incremental analysis runs\n\n1.14.2\n\n#1221 - Unified percentage calculate (thanks @Vampire)\n\n#1218 - Thread safety for results collection when tests run in parallel (thanks @Vampire)\n\n#1225 - Prevent error when non archive files included on classpath\n\n#1229 - Mutate Iterables to emptyList\n\n#1227/1232 - Fix MethodMutator interface to depend on abstract types\n\n1.14.1\n\n#1215 Apply coverage rewrites when aggregating reports\n\n#1219 Ensure try with resources filtering applied first (thanks @Vampire)\n\n1.14.0\n\n#1213 Filter equivalent divide by -1 maths mutants\n\n#1212 Auto add junit-platform-launcher\n\n#1212 Largely resolves the issue of keeping the pitest-junit5-plugin version in sync with the junit5 version for maven users.\n\nWhen used with 1.2.0 of the pitest-junit5-plugin, pitest will now automatically select a version of junit-platform-launcher which is compatible with the version of junit5 used by the system under test.\n\nIssues remain for gradle users who may still encounter api compatibilities when using 1.2.0 of the pitest-junit5-plugin. These can however now be resolved by manually adding the correct version of junit-platform-launcher to the classpath.\n\nIt is hoped that a future version of the pitest gradle plugin will implement a fix similar to the pitest-maven solution.\n\n1.13.2\n\n#638 Ensure % shows as 100 when all mutants killed (thanks @Vampire)\n\n#1197 Show start up info when logging set to VERBOSE_NO_SPINNER (thanks @Vampire)\n\n#1198 Logging improvements (thanks @Vampire)\n\n#1200 Warn if parallel test execution enabled during coverage collection (thanks @Vampire)\n\n#1199 Switch to System.nanoTime for test timings (thanks @Vampire)\n\n#1207 Support for removal of class level annotations\n\n1.13.1\n\n#1194 Support **. pattern in globs (thanks @Pfoerd)\n\n1.13.0\n\n#1188 Allow mutators to produce multiple distinct mutations\n\n#1190 Provide test prioritiser to interceptors\n\n#1191 Enable mutation of annotations of methods and fields\n\n1.12.0\n\n#1186 New extension points\n\n1.11.7\n\n#1178 Commas in killing test name break csv export (thanks @Bonajo)\n\n#1177 Apply features in a consistent order\n\n#1176 Upgrade to ASM 9.5\n\n1.11.6\n\n#1171 Prevent double instantiation of features\n\n#1170 Update links to https (thanks @romani)\n\n1.11.5\n\n#1167 Fix poor static analysis performance for large methods\n\n#1166 Update pitest web link to https (thanks @romani)\n\n1.11.4\n\n#1161 Prevent duplicate clinit when synthetic clinit present\n\n#1162 Auto add kotlin source dirs to maven when present\n\n1.11.3\n\n#1159 Include only mutated classes in line coverage stats\n\n1.11.2\n\n#1157 Report only target code lines\n\nThe line coverage stats reported on the console included code lines for the entire project, even when filters were applied. This resulted in dramatically low coverage scores.\n\n1.11.1\n\n#1156 Prevent synthetic lines being counted in coverage\n\n1.11.0\n\n#1138 Do not mutate redundant fall through to default switch cases\n\n#1150 New extension points\n\nNote that #1150 includes breaking interface changes which may require updates to third party plugins.\n\n1.10.4\n\n#1134 Add excludedRunners parameter to command line interface and Ant\n\n#1131 Support surefire late property evaluation syntax for arglines\n\n1.10.3\n\n#1128 Bug fix - lines with repeated debug entries double counted\n\n1.10.2\n\n#1125 Bug fix - synthetic lambda methods not treated as code lines\n\n1.10.1\n\n#1124 Fix bug introduced in 1.10.0 where bridge methods treated as valid lines of code\n\n1.10.0\n\n#1067 Improved Quarkus and Roboelectric support\n\n#1116 Option to exclude lines 0 and 1 of all classes\n\n#1118 Detect missing plugins\n\nAs a result of #1067 it is important that mutations are only created for a single class for each JVM. The MutationGrouper extension point has therefore been removed as this allowed this constraint to be violated. Any third party plugins using this extension are no longer supported.\n\nReleases also includes multiple changes to internal data structures. Any third party plugins relying on these structures may need to be updated.\n\n1116 provides a coarse way to exclude auto-generated code not picked up by pitest's other filters. It is disabled by default as it may exclude code that is valid for mutation in some situations, but can be enabled by adding the feature string +nofirstline.\n\n1.9.11\n\n#1105 Aggregator resolves wrong file for out of package kotlin files with same name\n\n#1111 Fix log typo (thanks @wangbo15)\n\n1.9.10\n\n#1106 Do not replace Map.of with Collections.emptyMap\n\n#1109 Relax source file debug check\n\n1.9.9\n\n#1098 Include case values in switch mutation descriptions\n\n1.9.8\n\n#1094 Search for source files outside of package directories\n\nAdds support for languages such as Kotlin where source files may not be within a directory structure which matches their package. Note that if the same filename occurs in more than one location, pitest cannot guarantee to resolve the correct file.\n\n1.9.7\n\n#1091 - Escape class names in coverage XML\n\n1.9.6\n\n#1092 - Upgrade to ASM 9.4\n\n#1091 - Properly escape coverage XML\n\n#1088 - Remove unused dependency distance param\n\n#1085 - Do not produce timestamp reports by default\n\nNote that #1085 changes the default behaviour so reports are no longer written to timestamped directories by default. If you require this behaviour you will need to explicitly enable it.\n\n1.9.5\n\n#1078 - Alter Config Updater interface\n\n#1079 - Avoid JBoss logging by default\n\n1078 is a breaking interface change, but is included in a point release as it is believed there are currently no external clients.\n\n1.9.4\n\n#1063 - Improve filtering of equivalent return mutants\n\n#1064 - Remove legacy return val mutators and old defaults group\n\n#1066 - Expand static initializer filtering\n\n#1070 - Remove jacoco agent if present on argline\n\n1.9.3\n\n#1052 - Support maven argLine property and single string argLines\n\n#1054 - Provide control over auto addition of -Djava.awt.headless=true\n\n#1055 - Option to autoset number of threads\n\n#1056 - Set timeout for socket communication\n\n#1058 - Set defaults for input and output encoding for programmatic api\n\n1054 Moves support of auto adding headless=true (to prevent keyboard focus being stolen on Macs) into a feature. It is enabled by default, but can be disabled by adding -MACOS_FOCUS to the features string.\n\n1055 adds the option to guess the appropriate number of threads for the current machine by adding +auto_threads the features string. This option is disabled by default and designed for local use. It is not recommended for use on a CI server.\n\n1.9.2\n\n#1050 - Check minions are alive to prevent process hangs\n\n1.9.1\n\n#1047 Mitigation for intermittent process hangs\n\n1.9.0\n\n#1035 - Improve coverage memory consumption\n\n#1038 - Support Maven Site Plugin 3.12.0+ (thanks IOs)\n\n#1040 - Faster JUnit 5 coverage calculation\n\n#1040 - Remove dependencyDistance parameter\n\nAs a result of #1040 any external pitest test plugins (eg JUnit 5, TestNG, arcmutate accelerator) must be updated to a compatible version (1.0.0) when upgrading.\n\nHistory files from earlier releases are incompatible and should be deleted when upgrading.\n\nOlder versions\n\n1.8.1\n\n#637 - Support different input and output encodings (thanks @qxo)\n\n#705 - Allow + in file paths (thanks @ali-ghanbari)\n\n#903 - Filter mutants in singleton constructors\n\n#1025 - Rework String Switch filtering\n\n#1027 - Rework assert filtering and remove legacy filter mechanism\n\n#1030 - Filter enum switch junk mutations\n\n1.8.0\n\n#1017 - Improve static infinite loop detection\n\n#1020 - Rework NFA matching library and try with resource filtering\n\n#1022 - Support quarkus test\n\n1.7.6\n\n#1008 Upgrade ASM for initial Java 19 support\n\n#1016 Fail cleanly when no working test plugin supplied\n\n#1015 Move TestNG support out of main codebase\n\nAs a result of #1015 the TestNG plugin must now be configured when using pitest in codebases tested by TestNG. In earlier releases support was included automatically.\n\n1.7.5\n\n#625 / #983 Fixed report aggregation (thanks @therealryan and @aurelien-baudet)\n\n#985 Handle empty surefire excludes\n\n#993 Move rv mutators to external plugin\n\n#994 / #995 Filter equivalent boxed return true mutants in try blocks\n\n#968 / 997 Improve filtering of equivalent empty return mutants\n\n#999 / 1003 New parameter to locate root of multi module projects\n\nAs a result of #993, anyone wishing to use the research orientated RV operators must configure the pitest-rv plugin, however these mutators are not recommended for general use.\n\n1.7.4\n\n#965 - BigDecimal Mutator (thanks @MarcinNowak-codes)\n\n#750 - Support -DskipTests from command line (thanks @marwin1991)\n\n1.7.3\n\n#952 Mutate map return to emptyMap instead of null\n\n#954 Allow mutators to be excluded\n\n#957 Filter equivalent mutations to Boolean.TRUE and Boolean.FALSE\n\n1.7.2\n\n#943 Change default mutators - replace negate conditional with remove conditional\n\n#946 Mutate stream returns to empty stream instead of null\n\n1.7.1\n\n#932 Improve switch mutation descriptions\n\n#934 Configure console output verbosity\n\n#940 Hide internal features\n\n#942 Fix for 3rd party mutation operators not added to client classpath\n\n#939 Improve caching of bytecode retrieval\n\n1.7.0\n\n#923 Internal interface changes\n\n#930 Pluggable mutators\n\nDue to internal changes some third party plugins maybe incompatible with this release.\n\nAll history files should be deleted before upgrading.\n\nThe names of the remove conditionals mutators have changed slightly as a result of #930 and may need to be updated in build scripts if explicitly activated.\n\n1.6.9\n\n#922 Filter equivalent stream.empty mutants in flatMap calls\n\n#921 Guarantee order of mutation operators\n\n#919 Filter junk mutations in java records\n\n1.6.8\n\n#917 - Add method to retrieve all mutator ids for pitclipse and other tooling\n\n#913 - Bump ASM to 9.2\n\n1.6.7\n\n#897 Fix description when replacing value with empty set\n\n#900 Support multiple test engines\n\n#822 Fix regression of NPE when reading classpath manifest\n\n#798 Fix regression of jvmArgs parameter support via maven\n\n#797 Fix regression of line coverage on console\n\nAs a result of #900 the testPlugin parameter is now defunct, but pitest will continue to accept it without error for this release. Pitest will use any test-engines supplied on the classpath, falling back to the built in JUnit4 support when other test engines cannot handle the class.\n\n1.6.6\n\n#891 - Fix history performance\n\n#889 - Do not scan classpath for history when option not supplied\n\n#887 - Fix css for timeouts and memory errors\n\n#888 - Remove defunct max mutants per class perameter\n\n#890 - Remove defunct mutate static initalizers parameter\n\n1.6.5\n\n#882 Avoid running tests when no mutants possible\n\n1.6.4\n\n#862 Update ASM for Java 16\n\n1.6.3\n\n#853 Fix case insensitive feature check\n\n#855 Make coverage data available to interceptors\n\n#857 Pass stderr/out data by line (thanks @kgeilmann)\n\n#858 Fix test not failing when maxSurviving is 0 (thanks @alexkoltz)\n\n#860 Fix junk mutations in try with resources in java 11+\n\n1.6.2\n\n#770 and #746 Fix NPE during coverage stage (thanks @LaurentTho3)\n\n#849 Make feature names case insensitive\n\n#844 Extend feature system to work with listeners\n\n#842 Make report options available to listeners\n\n1.6.1\n\nAutomate release to maven central\n\n#774 Test strength statistic (thanks @alex859)\n\n#798 Enable jvm args to be passed from command line (thanks @yfrolov)\n\n#797 Add line coverage to console (thanks @qxo)\n\n#822 Mitigate NPE on accidental dependency (thanks @szpak)\n\n1.5.2\n\n#749 ANT support for the fullMutationMatrix option (thanks @ayaankazerouni)\n\n#752, #755, #757 Version bumps and legacy code improvements (thanks @AlexElin)\n\n#758 Correctly can for test packages (thanks @nicerloop)\n\n#765 Fix incremental analysis for TestNG (thanks @StefanPenndorf)\n\n1.5.1\n\n#737 Add skipFailingTests flag to command line tool (thanks @szpak)\n\n#739 Fix typo in error message (thanks @vmellgre)\n\n#745 Improve error message when junit not on classpath (thanks @szpak)\n\n#748 Bump asm to 8.0 for Java 14 support\n\n1.5.0\n\n#556 -
