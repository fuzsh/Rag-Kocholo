        "text": "Women and Music in the Early Modern Age July 2nd - 4th, 2021, Queluz Queluz National Palace (Portugal) International Conference Organization : Divino Sospiro – Centro de Estudos Musicais Setecentistas de Portugal Website : The 9th international conference at the Queluz National Palace organized by DS-CEMSP aims to investigate the role of women in the musical and theatrical worlds of the early modern age, with special reference to the 17th and 18th centuries. The conference promotes research into the careers of women as impresarios, singers, actresses, composers, no matter how resounding their activity was in their heydays. Emphasis is also placed on their travels, contacts, and repertoires, and on the strategies adopted by female patronage in order to support the organization (and the memory) of theatrical and musical events throughout the continent. Female performers: singers, instrumentalists, dancers and impresarios. Their roles and repertoires. Female composers, librettists and choreographers. The feminine in music: women as subjects in the musical literature. Women as music and theatre patrons. Political uses of female musical patronage. The importance of music in the education of aristocratic and royal women. The female public. Women as music collectors. Women and music sociabilities.\n\nAnnotated bibliographies of: Reference Works Scores Historical Background of Research on Women in Music Feminist Musicology Women in Opera Women and Gender in Non-Western and Traditional Musics Women in Popular Music Lesbian Musicians and Musicality Women as Composers of Western Art Music (by period/century) Women as Professional Performers Women as Amateur Musicians Our current understanding of women in music began to take shape within the context of second-wave feminist activism of the 1970s, with its mission of promoting women’s voices and perspectives in contemporary arts and in the history of the arts. Female musicians promoted each others’ work through women-centered orchestras, choruses, bands, and ensembles; concerts and festivals of women’s music; female networks for teaching, collaboration, and mentorship; and independent labels for recording and distributing music by women. Composers such as Pauline Oliveros explored and cultivated feminist musical aesthetics. Historical researchers sought to recover female composers previously neglected by historians, and to integrate their lives and works into the music-historical narrative and art music canon. At the same time, the framing of issues in terms of “women and music” created new tensions. Gender-based advocacy, in the form of courses, journals, concerts, festivals, and record labels, raised awareness and created opportunities for women in music, but also threatened to perpetuate women's status as marginal to dominant discourses and institutions. Third-wave feminists of the late 1980s and 1990s pointed out that norms of feminine and masculine roles and behavior vary widely across social contexts, and that there is no universal experience of “women.” Research on women in music increasingly focuses on how gender intersects with other categories such as race, ethnicity, social class, geographic region, political affiliation, and sexual orientation. In any particular time and place, the intersection of all these factors creates the conditions for women’s access to musical training, resources, audiences, publication, and professional careers. Women’s musical activities and contributions have become more visible in musicology as the discipline has deepened its engagement with performers, with popular music, with nonwritten musical activities, and with music as social event and embodied practice. The study of women in music thus takes place within broader theoretical investigations of how music reproduces, affirms, subverts, and transforms cultural norms of gender and sexuality.\n\nThis article celebrates the 400th anniversary of Isabella Leonarda – 17th-century nun, singer & composer – in connection with the Earthly Angels performance and recording project. You can hear some of her music here: https://vaasabaroque.com/play/ In 1601, song-composer Caccini proclaimed the Baroque priorities of his ‘New Music’ as ‘Speech and Rhythm’. In Baroque speech and music, Rhetoric aims to ‘move the passions’. Leonarda’s precise notations contradict 20th-century assumptions that performers choose their own tempo, or that expressiveness requires rubato. Poetic detail, moving passions, vocal effects, contrasts of tempo, expressive gestures: Leonarda does ‘act with the hand, act with the heart’. The composer’s hand notates subtle tempo changes, in which the serene movement of the Divine Hand is reflected in the diverse pulse-rates of a lover’s human heart. Violinists’ and continuo-players’ hands give life to instrumental music, a microcosm of heavenly perfection, yet swayed by the human passions of the Four Humours. All this is guided by Tactus and expressed by gestures. Invisible to her 17th-century listeners, almost unnoticed by musicologists until recently, women’s hands are the heart and soul of Leonarda’s music.
