The saga of the name Barker follows a line reaching back through history to the days of the Anglo-Saxon tribes in Britain. It was a name for someone who worked as a person who stripped trees of bark for tanning. "It is confined to the northern half of England and to the eastern counties north of the Thames. It is very frequent in Yorkshire, and is also well represented in the counties of Derby, Lincoln, and Norfolk." 1

The name evolved from "from the trade or occupation of 'barker,' an obsolete name for the bark-stripper or rather for the man who prepared the bark for the tanner. Later the word was synonymous with 'tanner.' " 2

"A tanner, from his using bark of trees in his trade. In the old ballad of the King and the Tanner in Percy's Reliques, the latter calls himself "a Barker, Sir, by my trade." English Sum. Barcarius and Le Barkere." 3

Alisaundre le Barker, provost of the burgh of Haddington, rendered homage in 1296 [to King Edward I of England].

The Barker Motto +

The motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Motto: Fide sed cui vide

Motto Translation: Trust, but in whom take care.
