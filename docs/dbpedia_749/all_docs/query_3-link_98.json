        "text": "Winner of the 2021 Dorothy Hewitt Award for an Unpublished Manuscript, Hopeless Kingdom by debut author Kgshak Akec was already on my radar when it was longlisted for the 2023 Miles Franklin Award. Deservedly so.\n\nSome years ago, The Spouse was reminiscing about his childhood when he happened to mention that the first time he ever heard anyone speak in a different language was when athletes competing in the 1956 Olympics were billeted near his suburban bayside home, where he had lived until adulthood. By the same age, (and even more so by the time I was ten), I was a veteran of repeatedly moving house within and beyond the UK and ‘foreign languages’ were no big deal — though I certainly knew what it was like not to understand what was being said to me outside my home. (And sometimes inside it. My parents sometimes spoke either French or German at home to keep things private from little ears anyway.)\n\nAnd although Kgshak Akec’s experience of migration and belonging is more complex than mine because her family fled the war in Sudan as refugees, her coming-of-age in a place not her own is a portrayal of an experience very common to many of us not born here in Australia. Migration makes us adaptable, flexible and open-minded about ‘difference’ and most of us are genuinely grateful to the country that’s offered us a secure homeland — but it’s also hard. It is hard for little kids to be uprooted from all that’s familiar, to lose contact with their extended family and friends, to make and lose friends in one school after another, to leave behind favourite toys and play-places, to have to learn new languages and bewildering cultural mores. To always be the one who is ‘different’ where even the playground games are not the same, and to cop teasing and abuse for it. It’s also hard to witness the success and failures of other members of the family on their journey to belong. (I think it’s harder in different ways for teenagers and adolescents, which is also vividly portrayed in Hopeless Kingdom.)\n\nHopeless Kingdom is told in two alternating voices, beginning with Akita when she’s a little refugee kid in Cairo, offset by the narrative of her mother Taresai. Akita’s problems are immediate, and domestic: squabbles at home, and being bullied and unfair discipline at school. She lives in the present tense, as children do. Taresai has more complex problems. She has to learn a new language to negotiate new challenges, and her lack of literacy (because she was denied schooling) makes her dependent on others in a way that it did not before in Sudan. She has to deal with the fallout of her eldest son’s aggression but she also looks to the uncertain future of her family. She sees and interprets the behaviour of all her children as individuals; she has hopes and dreams for them. She struggles to maintain connections with the extended family which isn’t as supportive as it could be, and she has to deal with a husband whose frustrations at being unable to work within his professional expertise causes him to lose his way.\n\nThe novel traverses the years until Akita becomes a young woman finding her own way in the world, and Taresai negotiates the changes imposed by her husband’s return to Sudan, which was only temporarily deferred by another pregnancy. She becomes a working mother, dependent on Akita to help run the household and look after the three younger ones. Taresai learns English, and to read. Powerless to intervene, she sees her son’s behavioural problems escalate out of control and the tragedy that ensues. But as she grows in confidence, she tackles longstanding resentments about the way her education was sacrificed in favour of her sibling’s.\n\nAll of this is achieved by mother and daughter in the context of the racism they encounter and the loneliness of not belonging, but Hopeless Kingdom is not a heavy-handed denunciation of the flaws in Australian society. It ends on a note of hope, expressed so poignantly by Taresai in the Epilogue:\n\nI’ve lived a life.\n\nA life that knows the pain of my darkest nights. Knows the love that burns with the heat of a thousand suns and a hope that orbits mine like the moon orbits this earth. To have lost. To pour love into children I bore, to watch them be, become and live evermore. To have memories line the folds of my brain, stained with feeling in a golden hue. I watch their bodies move with the years, their faces change with the seasons as I come home to a house, with different coloured lights shining out of every window.\n\nAt the start of each day and at the end of each night I realise that there is hope in my kingdom, because I have seen all my wounds turn to scars. (p.345)\n\nI saw an interesting critique of the narrative voice in a review at Goodreads, and I want to address it. The reader thought that there wasn’t enough differentiation between the child’s voice and the adult’s: she thought that Akita’s childhood narrative was far too mature and intellectual. But this criticism overlooks the complexities of the narrative voice. Firstly, this is a middle-class Sudanese family — the father Santino is an architect; and secondly, Akita is an unusually intelligent and mature child. But also, when young Akita is narrating the story in Egypt, her languages do not include English: they are her mother-tongue Dinka and the Arabic which she has acquired at school. Two types of Arabic…\n\nWikipedia tells us that Arabic is a language where two types of the same language are used by a single community: vernacular varieties, which are mother-tongues, and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Classical Arabic.\n\nColloquial dialects vary significantly from MSA, impeding mutual intelligibility. MSA is only acquired through formal education and is not spoken natively. It is the language of literature, official documents, and formal written media. In spoken form, MSA is used in formal contexts, news bulletins and for prayers. (Wikipedia’s page about Arabic language, viewed 1/6/23 and lightly edited to remove footnotes and unnecessary links).\n\nWhen we hear Modern Standard Arabic in translation (as we often did during the Iraq war), it can sound rather florid to our ears because our own English has become more casual. The distinction between written and spoken English has blurred since my days at school. We do not often hear formal English, and people who do not read widely don’t often read literary or formal English either. Readers fed a steady diet of YA sometimes complain that the literary language of the classics is too hard to read but many people my age read them when we were teenagers with no difficulty. I don’t think we were any cleverer than they are, but the language young people are exposed to has changed since then.\n\nAkita is exposed to numerous languages at a formative period of language and literacy acquisition. Formal Arabic is the language that Akita is taught at her Egyptian school, and that the family would have heard on the TV news and encountered in official contexts. OTOH some form of colloquial Arabic would have been spoken in the playground at school, and in the markets where Taresai does her shopping—so the family becomes ‘bilingual’ in Arabic. (Taresai speaks five languages, but until quite late in her migration journey, the family speaks Arabic at home even when the children have become fluent in English.)\n\nSo how does an author render the complexities of these different languages and registers in Australian English?\n\nWhen Akita is narrating the spoken word, the tone is informal and childlike, as playground Arabic would be. She tells us, too, when she lacks the words to express herself. Unreliably, she also tells us sometimes that she says nothing for ethical reasons, or not wanting to lower herself to the behaviour of others. Perceptive readers are entitled to consider whether there might be other reasons that she doesn’t want to admit to. But when Akita is narrating her thoughts and feelings, her language becomes a fluent mixture of formal and informal registers. She is writing a work of literature, and even as a child she knows that written words have to be different to spoken language, but she does not have full command of it. And when she comes to Australia, she carries that formative idea of ‘literary’ language with her and she uses her growing vocabulary to full effect.\n\nI think this capture of the complexities of migrant language acquisition is spectacularly good.\n\nYou can hear Kgshak Akec’s talking about her book at this Totally Lit podcast."
