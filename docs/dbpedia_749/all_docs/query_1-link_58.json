        "text": "The ESPR will introduce a Digital Product Passport (DPP), a digital identity card for products, components, and materials, which will store relevant information to support products’ sustainability, promote their circularity and strengthen legal compliance.\n\nThis information will be accessible electronically, making it easier for consumers, manufacturers, and authorities to make more informed decisions related to sustainability, circularity and regulatory compliance. It will allow custom authorities to perform automatic checks on the existence and authenticity of the DPPs of imported products.\n\nInformation to be included in the DPP will be identified by the Commission, in close consultation with all relevant stakeholders, and will depend on the specific product in question. This information can include:\n\nProduct’s technical performance\n\nMaterials and their origins\n\nRepair activities\n\nRecycling capabilities\n\nLifecycle environmental impacts\n\nMany unsold products in the EU are simply destroyed, a practice that wastes valuable resources. For the first time in the EU, the ESPR introduces measures to address this practice, by introducing a ban on the destruction of unsold textiles and footwear, and opening the way for similar bans in other sectors, if evidence shows they are needed.\n\nIt will require large and eventually medium-sized companies across all product sectors to disclose annual information on their website, such as the number and weight of products they discard, as well as their reasons for doing so.\n\nPublic authorities in the EU spend around €1.8 trillion purchasing works, goods and services.\n\nThe ESPR will help steer these funds in a more sustainable direction, by enabling mandatory Green Public Procurement criteria to be set for EU authorities who purchase the products that it will regulate.\n\nThis has the potential to significantly boost demand for sustainable products, in turn, further incentivising companies to invest in this area."
