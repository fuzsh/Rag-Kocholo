        "text": "English painter\n\nKit Barker (1916–1988) was a British painter.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker was born in London, England, to English father George Barker (1879–1965), a police constable and former Army batman, and Irish mother Marion Frances (1881–1953), née Taaffe, from Mornington, County Meath, near Drogheda, Ireland.[1][2][3][4] His elder brother was the poet George Barker; they were raised at Battersea, London, and the family later lived at Upper Addison Gardens, Holland Park.[5]\n\nBarker served in the British Army from 1942 to 1945. In 1948 he married the writer Ilse Gross (1921–2006), who wrote under the pen name Kathrine Talbot. They had one son, Thomas (born 1962).[6] Barker lived in Cornwall from 1947 to 1948, where he and Ilse were involved with the artists' colony in St Ives.[7]\n\nIn 1949 the Barkers travelled to the USA where Kit lectured at Skidmore College in New York. Kit later taught with Hassel Smith, Elmer Bischoff and David Park at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco (1951–1952). During their time in the USA, the Barkers stayed at Yaddo artists' community in Saratoga Springs, New York.[7]\n\nFrom 1953 Barker lived on Bexley hill, Sussex[7] and travelled extensively in Europe and the US. He died in West Sussex in 1988.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker was a self-taught artist.
