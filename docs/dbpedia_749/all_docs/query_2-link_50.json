        "text": "English Hebraist\n\nSamuel Barker (1686–1759) was an English Hebraist.\n\nLife\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker was the son of Augustin Barker of South Luffenham and Thomasyn Tryst of Maidford, Northants,[1] and inherited the Lordship of the Manor of Lyndon, Rutland by the bequest of his father's second cousin Sir Thomas Barker, 2nd Bt of Lyndon (1648-1706/7).[2] Sir Thomas was a member of the 'Order of Little Bedlam' or Bedlam Club based at Burghley House.[3] Samuel entered Wadham College, University of Oxford in June 1704 and graduated B.A. on 13 February 1707/8.[4]\n\nIn 1717 Samuel married Sarah, only daughter of William Whiston, in whose memoirs he is mentioned.[5] Their interests coincided closely, 'Wicked'[6] Will Whiston being the translator-editor of Josephus. Whiston in later life resided with Samuel at Lyndon Hall[7] and died there. Samuel was the father of Thomas Barker (1722–1809), called 'The father of meteorology', and was therefore the father-in-law of Ann Barker née White, the sister of Gilbert White of Selborne.[8] Gilbert White maintained correspondence with Samuel Barker junr. (grandson of Samuel), who like his great-grandfather Whiston attended Clare College, University of Cambridge.[9]\n\nWorks\n\n[edit]\n\nHe wrote (in Latin) several learned tracts, which were collected and published (1761) in one quarto volume after his death, together with a Hebrew grammar, on which he had long been engaged.[10] John Nichols said of it, 'This was a juvenile production – the produce of the ingenious Author's leisure hours.'[11] It contained:\n\nAncient Hebrew Poesy Restored\n\nOn the Anacreontic songs\n\nOn Greek accents\n\nAncient Ionic writings\n\nOn consonant and vowel letters\n\nOn the pronunciation of the Hebrew language\n\nHe was the author of a letter, dated 7 November 1723, to Joseph Wasse, rector of Aynho, Northamptonshire, concerning a passage in the Sigeion inscription,[12] which may be found in the Biblioteca Literaria of Samuel Jebb and William Bowyer, No. 10 (1724).\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Barker, Samuel\" .
