        "text": "(from Christie's)\n\nThomas Blight, the presumed sitter, came from an old Yorkshire family who had settle in Ireland. He was the son of the Reverend Robert Blight, later Dean of Elphin, and his second wife, Miss Winthrop, and a nephew of John, 1st Earl of Darnley and General Thomas Blighe, who had a distinguished army career; the General bequeathed his estates and fortune to his younger brother the Dean. In 1790 Thomas married Theodosia, second daughter of John, 3rd Earl of Darnley, and his wife Mary, daughter and heir of John Stoyte of Street, Westmeath. He died in 1830.\n\nWard and Roberts, loc.cit., record a portrait of Thomas Cherbury Bligh in 1782, and sittings in October and December that year, and January and March the following year; payment was made in two halves, the final one in 1784.\n\nA note under the entry mentions a portrait attributed to Romney of the sitter at Mancester City Art Gallery, which was purchased in 1901; this has, however, been re-attributed to Joseph Wright of Derby, dating from c.1777-80, the provenance for that portrait is given as the Collection of Charles Hamilton, Hamwood, Dunboye, Co. Meath and quotes another note from Mr. Hamilton's father to the effect that the portrait, together with those of other members of the family, were bought at the Bligh sale at Brittas; Mr. Hamilton senior was the great-grandson of Lady Mary Bligh by her marriage to William Tighe of Rossana, Co. Wicklow in 1736. This provenance could apply to the present portrait.\n\nThe Very Rev. Robert Bligh (?-1778) married his second wife, Frances Winthrop(e), in 1759 and subsequently had four children. The \"History of Parliament\" website states that Thomas Cherburgh Bligh was born \"?1761\" and that he graduated from St. John's Cambridge on 1 June 1780, aged 19.\n\nRef.\n\nhttp://www.bandon-genealogy.com/newspapers_bandon.htm\n\nhttp://thepeerage.com/p3374.htm#i33733\n\nhttp://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/bligh-thomas-cherburgh-1761-1830\n\nWhile testing whether any of Lady Mary Bligh Tighe's descendants might be a possibility for the sitter, I ran across a statement about St. John's, Cambridge \"...it had the added advantage of possessing the largest funds of any Cambridge college for assisting poor but able men to gain a university education.\" It would be interesting to know whether Thomas Cherburgh Bligh qualified for funds described above or if the legacy from Lt.-Gen. Thomas Bligh to his brother, the Very Rev. Robert Bligh paid for his nephews' education. At any rate, it is ironic that Rev. Robert Bligh would be engaged as Curate for Abbymahon ca. 1751-1778 for Â£ 15 per annum, only to have his son purchase a portrait by Romney for Â£ 42 soon after his death in 1778. (In all fairness, Rev. Bligh had other income, e.g., at various times, impropriator of Clondullane, Liatrim, Macroney and Curate of Kilmaloda; from 1768-1778, Dean of Elphin.)\n\nRef.\n\nTitle Patrick Bronte: Father of Genius\n\nAuthor Dudley Green\n\nEdition reprint\n\nPublisher The History Press, 2010\n\nISBN 0752462474, 9780752462479\n\nLength 384 pages\n\nPage 26\n\nI have been researching for 30 years the identities of 514 subscribers to the Italian Opera for the year 1795 listed on an aide-de-memoire fan which I own. I have this portrait the source of which I unfortunately cannot verify at this late stage but I can pass on the information about this particular gentleman. He was Thomas Cherburgh Bligh, of Brittas, County Meath, cousin and husband from 1790 of Theodosia, sister of Lord Darnley. Known to be a querulous Irishman he was constantly looking for arguments, especially with his brother-in-law, the Earl. In 1812 he was tried and bound over to keep the peace and again in 1820, when he was bound over for a further four years. Unable to pay his sureties for his discharge, the hot-tempered Thomas died in the Kings Bench prison. Hope this helps.\n\nI think the answer lies on the ARTUK website. This portrait bears a striking resemblance to Thomas Shrawley Vernon (1759-1825) who portrait is to be found at Hanbury Hall (on the National Trust Website, here: https://www.artuk.org/discover/artworks/thomas-shrawley-vernon-17591825-130508/search/term:jacket-857/page/92/view_as/grid ). See attached for comparison. This identification also makes sense as (a) Thomas Shrawley Vernon was of the Vernon family of Hanbury Hall near Birmingham and its âLunar Societyâ with which Wright had longstanding links); (b) his cousin (from whom he eventually inherited Hanbury Hall https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbury_Hall ) was married to (eventually divorced from) the Marquis of Exeter who was an early patron of Wright of Derby (purchasing âBoys with a bladderâ and its pendant); (c) there is a record in Wrightâs account book of his painting a âDrÃ¶perâ (at least transcribed as such, whatever that means) to a whole length picture for a âLord Vernonâ. Whilst there is a real âLord Vernonâ, this painting cannot be of them, as none were of the right age at the time of sitting. It is, however, not unlikely that Wright would have referred to Thomas Shrawley Vernon as âLordâ given his ancestry and as he was then an heir. More research would probably turn up more. References to the account book entries are pp 17 and 19 in Elizabeth E. Barker. 2009. âDOCUMENTS RELATING TO JOSEPH WRIGHT 'OF DERBY' (1734-97) The Volume of the Walpole Society, Vol. 71 (2009), pp. 1-216\n\n1 attachment\n\nvernonportrait-1.docx (409 KB)\n\nIt would be good to try to make progress with this interesting discussion started almost five years ago.\n\nSimon Gillespie's opinion that the canvas and paint point strongly to Joseph Wright of Derby (as attributed) is very helpful. Among the suggestions received to date, as far as the facial resemblance goes (Wright was an artist known for producing excellent likenesses), I also lean toward Will Pinfold's speculation that this could be Brooke Boothby.\n\nAlthough itâs speculation for the time being, could this be Boothby on his return from Paris in 1776 (aged 32)? Why might Wright have painted Boothby twice in close succession? Itâs tempting to imagine that he might have produced this one (a half-length portrait with a published, bound book, a specific work) and expanded on the theme in Tateâs full-length, reclining homage to Rousseauâs philosophy in the widest sense. Nicolson dated this 1777â1780. The date of Tateâs picture is 1781 (so, between 1 and 5 years apart). (Rousseau himself visited Wootton Lodge in 1766, not 1776 â thereâs a typo on Tateâs website).\n\nOr, as Patty and Richard have considered, Thomas Cherburgh Bligh, perhaps painted on his graduation in 1780?\n\nIâm ready to be judged swiftly for speculating wildly, but itâs as much an attempt to re-start the discussion. It would be good to try to find some basis for some of the earlier ideas too, but each probably needs quite a lot of work!\n\nI am more convinced by the suggestion it is Boothby than any of the other candidates mentioned: it is not just likeness (which we know can be deceptive, though Wright had a great reputation for good ones). It's the colour of the dress, which at the least is a remarkably close coincidence to the full-length Wright portrait; also the inclusion of the book, ditto; and the same somewhat dreamy representation of character. Even Wright had limits to his sitter list, albeit the conclusion may have to remain 'Brooke Boothby (?)'/ or 'thought to be' him.\n\nIf its a question of which of the two portraits came first, then this looks marginally younger than the other (certainly not the other way round) and one could well see that this might have been a preliminary one -albeit fully finished in itself rather than just an apparent study: again, that would be more logical than the other way round. It's an Occam's Razor case: what is the minimum evidence for a rational conclusion? If it is not someone totally unknown to have been painted by Wright (e.g. a name we don't know at all, or one known but connected to a picture now lost without visual record), then what is the highest probability? Boothby certainly looks to be heading the field.\n\nWright as well as Romney, Reynolds, Gainsborough and or any of the other boys in the band would have painted them all once a month if the sitter had the money. So Multiple Portraits usually meant the sitter loved how they were portrayed and they were comfortable with the artist. The Head Shots as it were usually came first, they were considerably cheaper and an easy way for the sitter to see if the artist was getting their likeness and if they got along with the artist. and if the artist got along with them. There has been many a Client Fired by their Artist.,\n\nSticking with Boothby and the 'double portrait', it's a commonplace that 'versions' (i.e. artist replicas, more or less), were often done for sitters as gifts, or by request of third parties. Sometimes one even sees examples of different-scale ones clearly done at the same time, of which the Greenwich full-length of Captain Sir Edward Hughes by Violante Siries and the head and shoulders version (c. 30 x 25) in the NT collection at Tredegar House in south Wales, almost certainly were: Hughes was only briefly in Florence to sit to her in 1761 and the f/l at least had certainly left there by 1762.\n\nhttps://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/14266.html\n\nHowever, if this is Boothby it would -on apparent age - be a fairly conventional first shot before the very unusual horizontal full-length in the Tate (in the same dress, or at least the same colour): in other words, two different portraits presumably done for Boothby, of which he might have kept both or - at least after commissioning the second (Tate) canvas - passed the first on to another family member or friend. Alternatively the Manchester one might have been commissioned of him by an older relative (though I have no idea who among them was then still about) to mark his return from Paris, and -liking it -Boothby then got Wright to do his very idiosyncratic full-length: idiosyncratic, that is (though not unprecedented) as regards Boothby's taste and self-image, rather than Wright's choice of pose.\n\nWhile other similarly parallel 'pairs' would not support the specific identification here, it would be interesting to know if there are examples, be they precedent or subsequent. Though no more than a personal view, I don't see a closer likeness than Boothby (facially, in expression, and taking the dress and book into account) in any of the other names so far put forward. In the absence of related documentation proving anything, a conclusion of any sort can be no more than best guess and 'Boothby (?)' is mine.\n\nThanks and further apology; I'm the one crossing terminological wires over what at least today seems oddly contradictory. So, to interpret Nicholson:\n\n1. 'Mr Boothby' listed at 6 gns c.1762-65, but the entry crossed out and replaced in the same group of sitters at 12 gns, with just that figure again crossed out and recorrected to 6 gns\n\n2. 'Copy of Mr Boothby' done before 1777 at 12 gns\n\nAs Marion earlier pointed out (27/9/ 2019), Boothby returned from Paris in 1776 but had already met Rousseau ten years earlier in England, and become his notable champion.\n\nHe was 22 in 1766 and 37 when the Tate 'grand horizontal' was finished in 1781.\n\nI don't think anyone has yet given Nicholson's identity for the Manchester picture (which he dated c. 1777-80) -though presumably not Boothby (?): that in itself seems a bit odd if only not to dismiss its apparent likeness as misleading.\n\nThat aside, and sticking with him as a 'possible' for the moment, could the three 'pre-Tate' entries really be references to what are probably two 30 x 25s of which no. 1 could be c.1766 and no. 2 the 'copy' at his later higher price? Age difference of 22 to 37 has differing effects in individual cases and the relatively slight one between the 'Manchester image' and 'Tate image' (if both Boothby) also accounted for by the latter being painted either from the portrait of 1766 or its later copy -which would presumably be the Manchester canvas if Nicholson's judgement of its date is correct. That might also explain why at least the clothing colour is the same fifteen years apart, unless it was one Boothby habitually favoured.\n\nWhaley, I'm sorry, but your instructions are all but incomprehensible (and the humorous aside doesn't help). I don't understand why you are trying to take us to page 55 of 'Joseph Wright, Esq. Painter and Gentleman', and not to page 56 directly: that is where the Boothby account is mentioned - https://bit.ly/36jnKFu. Unfortunately it is only a reference note to a section of the book not available in the preview, and on its own is hard to deduce much from. In any case the bond referred to only commenced in 1781, the completion date of the famous portrait at the Tate, so its relationship to any earlier portrait(s), if any, is uncertain - the extracts from the account book given by Nicolson and shared by Richard are more helpful, though still unclear.\n\nWhat you say about Boothby and Rousseau's book is true enough, and the later Tate portrait clearly refers to this. As their catalogue (https://bit.ly/38DdWry) says,\"The key to the work is the vellum-bound volume**, which Boothby is holding. The poet indicates with his left forefinger the name ROUfSEAU [sic], inscribed on the spine.\" [**i.e. the unpublished manuscript, presumably]\n\nBut assuming our portrait is indeed Boothby, it must be earlier, and certainly before he had Rousseau's book published in 1780. So I cannot think that the book held by him is Rousseau's - and if it were, surely its spine and title/author would be visible, as it is in Wright's later (at length) portrait? Our book's author is anonymous: it is just a symbol of learning.\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't have any problem at all with our portrait showing Boothby in his early 20s vs his mid-30s in the Tate work - I think there is significantly more facial weight and age in the latter. My instinct is that the clothing style in ours is also consistent with a date in the 1760s; but I need to do more work on that - and as ever a more expert view would be most welcome.\n\nOsmund, if you can find you way back to that page again, I know it's a lot to ask, lol, but the specific paragraph I was trying to get you too mentions multiple paintings of Boothby by Wright. They seemed to have had an ongoing friendship based on all things enlightenment. And again sorry about not being able to put you straight on that page and paragraph. But, if you have the time Keep reading there is some interesting information.\n\nAs for the symbolism I agree, but, in both Paintings the sitter has a a firm grasp on the book. The usual symbolism of that time period placed the sitters hand on the book as if he was absorbing it by osmosis. In our two paintings Boothby is grasping it like it's a weapon.\n\nIn my mind, and maybe only there, that inks those 2 paintings as a continuing conversation.\n\nAfter six years and 57 comments, it seems unlikely that this discussion will go much further. However, the proposal that the sitter is possibly â or even probably â the young Brooke Boothby (1744-1824; 7th baronet from 1789) surely brings us as close to answering the question in the heading as we can expect to be.\n\nThe traditional identification of the subject as âThe Hon. Thomas Blighâ was not accepted by Benedict Nicolson in 1968 and the name Bligh does not appear in Wrightâs account book. It has been appropriate nevertheless to revisit the possibility that Bligh or another member of his family might be the sitter â albeit without positive conclusion. Numerous other suggestions, none without interest, have followed. However, the only one potentially supported by related documentation is that of Brooke Boothby (first posted by Will Pinfold), based on comparison with the Tateâs large canvas of that sitter reclining in a landscape setting, of 1780-81. In this connection Wrightâs account book records one or more smaller portraits of Boothby painted by the artist in the years before he executed the Tate picture â and the present whereabouts of any such earlier portrait or portraits is otherwise unknown.\n\nAlthough Nicolson dated the Manchester picture c.1777-80, Andrew Graciano has here proposed a date in the late 1760s or early 1770s, confirmed by Alex Kidsonâs view that the portrait belongs to Wrightâs Liverpool years, i.e. 1768-71. This revised dating would indicate that the sitter in our picture, if Boothby, would be in his mid-twenties, whereas the famous Tate portrait shows him at around thirty-six or thirty-seven. An age difference thus of a decade or a little more for the sitter, if the same in the two portraits, would seem to accord with the images.\n\nAll of this should be seen in the context of Brooke Boothby being one of Wrightâs most important patrons, buying paintings in other genres from the artist as well as commissioning portraits, employing him to retouch pictures in his collection and borrowing money from him.\n\nCorrection: Brooke Boothby (subject of the famous Tate portrait) was in fact the 6th baronet and not the 7th as recorded in the DNB, the Oxford DNB and elsewhere (and as thus inadvertently stated in my post of 11/11/2020). Brooke Boothby was born on 3 June 1744 at Ashbourne, Derbyshire. He succeeded as 6th baronet of Broadlow Ash, Derbyshire, on 9 April 1789, died on 23 January 1824, aged 79, in Boulogne and was buried on 13 February that year at Ashbourne. He was succeeded by his younger brother Major William Boothby (born 1745/46) who was to hold the baronetcy for just a couple of months before he died on 17 March 1824. The confusion would seem to have resulted from the similarity of the birth and death dates of the 6th and 7th baronets.\n\nThe NPG has, in addition to the 4th baronet mezzotint mentioned by Sue Evans, two copies of John Raphael Smithâs 1797 mezzotint after Reynoldsâs portrait of Brooke Boothby:\n\nhttps://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp19711/sir-brooke-boothby-6th-bt\n\nThe original painting, dating from 1784, is recorded in David Manningsâs Reynolds catalogue (no.203, as 7th baronet) as being in a private collection.\n\nHill Boothby (1708-1756), friend of Samuel Johnson, was indeed from an earlier generation of Brooke Boothbyâs family.\n\nThe numbering confusion of the Boothby baronets has certainly been compounded by the very close dates of 6th & 7th barts; but the fundamental reason is that what was effectively the same baronetcy was created twice.\n\nThe first time, in 1644, the legalities of the process were not completed because of the Civil War - the patent had the King's signature, but lacked the Great Seal. This led to the would-be 2nd baronet of the first creation petitioning after the Restoration for a fully legal replacement baronetcy, which he received in 1660. He thus became technically the first baronet of the second creation, but was widely still considered the second of the first...and thus it has continued to this day.\n\nIt's a very convincing comparison between the two faces, though there may be a little more than a decade between them if Wright's account books are interpreted that way and the Manchester picture dates from 1765-6 or so. It's certainly plausible as someone in their early 20s and you wouldn't expect much stylistic difference from the Liverpool period which only starts a few years later.\n\nAs with the Tate picture there may be a link with Rousseau who stayed at Wootton Hall, only 5 miles from Boothby's home, for about a year in 1766-7. Rousseau was already a celebrity and had published many of this best known works (Heloise, the essays on Education, the Social Contract) and the book in the picture may be one of those and have been painted in anticipation of a meeting or during the time when they must have met on many occasions. Later Boothby was to publish Rousseau's Confessions after the latter's death, presumably as arranged.\n\nI wonder whether Boothby's distinctive dress in both portraits is influenced by Rousseau's thoughts on the topic. These are often seen as having an influence on women's fashion and encouraging a more 'natural' look, but they may have had some influence on how men dressed as well."
