        "text": "As the First World War progressed more troops were needed for the Western Front. To meet this demand Expeditionary Force A from India was sent to reinforce the British Troops – particularly in France.[1]\n\nMany men who fell during these campaigns are honoured by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Amongst these are 4,742 soldiers from India whose names are recorded on the Neuve Chapelle Memorial in France. In 1964 these names were expanded to also commemorate 210 servicemen of India whose graves at Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery in East Germany could not be maintained.\n\nFirst World War\n\nMedals\n\nNurse\n\nWar Diaries\n\nIncluded in the many records held at the National Archives Kew is the series WO 95 - War Office: First World War and Army of Occupation War Diaries.\n\nIn addition to Battalion war diaries, there may be higher level Brigade and Division war diaries, which may provide information about Battalions not be found in the relevant Battalion diaries, or Battalion diaries may not have survived. The vast majority of war diaries for RFA units [Royal Artillery] were kept at the brigade level.[2]\n\nSome War Diaries, many of which are handwritten, have been digitised and are available (on a pay basis) online from various sources: from the National Archives through the Discovery catalogue[3], from Naval and Military Archive[4], part of Naval & Military Press, which also publishes print and DVD-ROM versions, and through Ancestry which contains the database \"UK, WWI War Diaries (France, Belgium and Germany), 1914-1920\" (selected, and at times, part war diaries only)[5][6](search hints[7][8]) (and another database for Gallipoli). The Ancestry database also contains War Diaries for some Indian, Australian, New Zealand, and other regiments.\n\nSome transcribed war diaries (where the handwriting has been deciphered for you!) edited by Martin Gillott, series title (and publisher) Great War Diaries, for British Army and Indian Army regiments, are available through Amazon.co.uk[9] in Kindle editions which have a Search facility (anyone with Kindle Unlimited can read them for free). (Download of a free Kindle App is available onto a PC, Mac or tablet - you don't need Kindle). The transcribed Indian Army Great War Diaries currently (2017/12) available are 15th Ludhiana Sikhs War Diary 1914-15: Indian Army on the Western Front; 57th (Wilde's) Rifles (Frontier Force) War Diary 1914-15: The Indian Army on the Western Front; 59th (Scinde) Rifles (FF) War Diary 1914-15: Indian Army on the Western Front.\n\nAlso see External links below.\n\nThe Australian War Memorial website[10] contains Australian and New Zealand Army War diaries (available for free).\n\nThere is also a record series, consisting of of printed volumes at the British Library, called \"Indian Army First World War - War Diaries\" IOR/L/MIL/17/5/2421-4246 : 1914-1921, which includes Western Front War Diaries. Includes War Diary [Collection], Army Headquarters India, Indian Expeditionary Force 'A' [France]. GSI, 1914-19. 26 vols IOR/L/MIL/17/5/3086-3149.

The author, a retired Major (late Royal Gurkha Rifles and ex-10GR), 1998), has an authentic feel for the old Indian Army and the times\".\n\n“Well worth tracking a copy, both as a fascinating book and a display of how good military history should be written.“[11]\n\nFor an interview with the author Gordon Corrigan, see below.\n\nTime zones\n\nDuring the First World War, unoccupied France and Belgium were in the same time zone as Great Britain, (Greenwich Mean Time). Germany was one hour ahead (GMT+1), as were the German occupied areas of France and Belgium. Germany first introduced Daylight Saving time Sunday, 30 April 1916, 23:00:00 when clocks were forwarded one hour. France followed on Wednesday, 14 June 1916, 23:00:00 pm when clocks were forwarded 1 hour.
